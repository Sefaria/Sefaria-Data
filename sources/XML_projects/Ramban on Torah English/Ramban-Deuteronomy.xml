<p>(Translator&#x2019;s Note upon Completion of the Commentary)</p>
<p><italic>Therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth,</italic></p>
<p><italic>And with my song will I praise Him.</italic></p>
<p>(Psalms 28:7)</p>
<p>On this day, when Ramban&#x2019;s entire Commentary on the Torah has been made available to the English-speaking Torah-world, I am overcome with profound gratitude to G-d for sustaining me to live to witness this occasion.</p>
<p>As steeped as Ramban was in the spirit and knowledge of the sacred text of the Torah, his original Hebrew work was nevertheless far removed from those people who, because of unfamiliarity with the language, could not consult the Commentary to obtain a conception of this savant&#x2019;s understanding of the written word of G-d. A number of years have passed since the project of translating the Commentary was first started, and it has already been five years since the publication of <italic>Sefer Bereshith</italic> in December, 1971. The warm response of the public to the first and all consecutive volumes is indeed a true and firm indication of the sincere desire of the English-speaking Jew for the &#x201C;Words of the living G-d.&#x201D; For all this I am deeply grateful.</p>
<p>On this occasion, I am pleased to express my thanks and appreciation to Messrs. Henry Petzenbaum and Joseph Salomon of Shilo Publishing House, Inc., for their courage in undertaking the publication of an enterprise of such magnitude which was further complicated by a great variety of problems; for the unfailing attention which they gave to every detail of the work; and for their untiring efforts, performed humbly and quietly, in bringing forth a publication of which it may truly be said that it serves <italic>l&#x2019;hagdil Torah ul&#x2019;ha&#x2019;adirah</italic> (to magnify the Torah and to beautify it). I also gratefully acknowledge herewith the service of Rabbi Noson Scherman for his invaluable suggestions on reading the manuscript of this fifth volume, the Book of Deuteronomy.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I express the hope and prayer to G-d that even as we behold this translation of the Commentary on the Torah making its appearance in the world as a complete entity, which helps to unlock the rich treasure-house of the Five Books of Moses, so may we all be privileged to enjoy the Glory of the Eternal&#x2019;s ways as we further seek the deep understanding of the truth in His Torah.</p>

<intro>
<p>&#x2018;EILEH HADEVARIM&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1">1</xref></sup> (THESE ARE THE WORDS). This book is known to constitute a review of the Torah, in which Moses our teacher explains to the generation entering the Land most of the commandments of the Torah that pertain to Israelites [as distinguished from the priests]. He does not mention anything relative to the law of the priests, neither about their performance of the offerings nor the ritual purity of the priests and their functions [in the Sanctuary], having already explained these matters to them. The priests, being diligent in their duties,<sup><xref rid="fn2">2</xref></sup> do not require repeated admonitions. The Israelites, [i.e., the non-priests], however, are admonished time and again about the commandments that apply to them, sometimes to add further clarification and sometimes only to caution the Israelites with multiple warnings. Thus there are in this book many admonitions regarding idolatry that follow one after another, as well as chastisements and <italic>a sound of terrors</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3">3</xref></sup> casting upon them the fear of all the punishments for the transgressions. Additionally, he proclaims commandments which have not been [previously] mentioned at all, such as the levirate marriage,<sup><xref rid="fn4">4</xref></sup> the law concerning the defamation of a virgin bride,<sup><xref rid="fn5">5</xref></sup> the divorcing of a wife,<sup><xref rid="fn6">6</xref></sup> [the punishment of] plotting witnesses,<sup><xref rid="fn7">7</xref></sup> and others besides. Now all these laws had in fact been declared to Moses, either on Sinai or in the Tent of Meeting within the first year<sup><xref rid="fn8">8</xref></sup> [of the erection of the Tabernacle] before the affair of the spies. Nothing new was revealed to Moses in the plains of Moab [where he held this review of the Torah] except the words of the covenant, as is expressly stated there.<sup><xref rid="fn9">9</xref></sup> It is for this reason that this book does not contain such statements as &#x201C;And G-d spoke to Moses, saying:Command the children of Israel,&#x201D; or &#x201C;Speak to the children of Israel and say to them the following commandment&#x201D; [since no new commandments were given in this book; they had all been previously declared to Moses either on Mount Sinai or in the Tent of Meeting]. These commandments, however, were not written in the preceding books wherein He speaks to those that came forth from Egypt. Perhaps this was because these commandments were obligatory only in the Land even though they affect personal conduct [and do not depend on the Land] such as Scripture mentions with reference to the drink-offerings;<sup><xref rid="fn10">10</xref></sup> or it may be that because these were not of common occurrence, he mentioned them only to the generation, the inheritors of the Land.</p>
<p>Before Moses commenced the explanation of the Torah he began to reprove them, reminding them of their sins, <italic>How oft did they rebel against Him in the wilderness</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn11">11</xref></sup> and how the Holy One, blessed be He, conducted Himself towards them with the attribute of mercy. This was to inform them of His mercies towards them; also, that they be chastised by his words so that they would not revert to their degradation <italic>lest</italic> they <italic>be swept away in all their sins</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn12">12</xref></sup> and [finally] to strengthen their hearts by informing them that He will always conduct Himself towards them with the attribute of mercy, and hence a person should not feel that he will not be able to inherit the Land because &#x2014; since there is no person that does not sin<sup><xref rid="fn13">13</xref></sup> &#x2014; the attribute of judgment would at once be aimed against him and he would be destroyed. Therefore Moses our teacher informed them that the Holy One, blessed be He, is the Merciful One, full of mercy, since the forgiveness and pardon which come from Him, blessed be He, are an assistance and help to people in serving Him, similar to what Scripture says, <italic>For with Thee is forgiveness, that Thou mayest be feared</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn14">14</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1">(1) <italic>These are the &#x2018;words&#x2019;</italic> &#x2014; The fifth book of the Torah thus received its title &#x2014; Devarim &#x2014; from the second Hebrew word of the book. The English title Deuteronomy, meaning a restatement of the law, is derived from the Septuagint &#x2014; the first Greek translation of the Bible &#x2014; which gave it that name because a major part of the book is devoted to such a restatement.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2">(2) Shabbath 20a. People who are known for having the quality of diligence in their work need not be reminded of the duties incumbent on them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3">(3) Job 15:21. Reference is obviously to the words of <italic>tochachah</italic> (reproof, or threat of punishment) mentioned further, 28:15-68.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4">(4) I.e., the duty to marry the widow of a brother who died without issue (further, 25:5-6).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5">(5) Further, 22:13-19.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn6">(6) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, 24:1-3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn7">(7) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, 19:16-20.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn8">(8) In the Tur: &#x201C;In the <italic>second</italic> year,&#x201D; i.e., from the exodus. Both versions are, strictly speaking, correct. It was the year of the erection of the Tabernacle, and the &#x201C;second&#x201D; from the exodus. See also Leviticus 7:38, (Vol. III, pp. 90-91), where Ramban discusses the problem as to where <italic>all</italic> of the commandments were declared to Moses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn9">(9) Further, 28:69: <italic>These are &#x2018;the words of the covenant&#x2019; which the Eternal commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab</italic> &#x2026; In other words, only <italic>the words of the covenant</italic> were newly declared by the Eternal to Moses in the plains of Moab. All the commandments, however, had previously been declared on Sinai or in the Tabernacle.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn10">(10) Numbers 15:2. The law of drink-offering is not connected with the soil, yet it was enjoined only <italic>when ye are come into the Land of your habitations</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn11">(11) Psalms 78:40.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn12">(12) Numbers 16:26.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn13">(13) See Ecclesiastes 7:20.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn14">(14) Psalms 130:4. G-d forgives in order to turn man&#x2019;s heart towards Him in reverence, for, without Divine pardon, man would be in constant fear of being lost in his sin and therefore incapable of revering Him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn15">(15) Further 5:6-18. In other words, the opening expression of the Torah here, <italic>These are the words</italic> &#x2026;, is not a reference to the words of Moses from the beginning of the book on, narrating the historical events of the journey through the wilderness, but primarily a reference to the Ten Commandments and the laws that followed, which Moses introduced with a review of their journey from Sinai to the Jordan followed with an exhortation to obedience.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Devarim</title>
<h1>1</h1>
<p>1. THESE ARE THE WORDS WHICH MOSES SPOKE UNTO ALL ISRAEL. [The reference is] to the commandments which he will mention in the entire book beginning with the Ten Commandments in the section of <italic>Va&#x2019;ethchanan</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn15">15</xref></sup> as Scripture stated, <italic>Moses began explaining this Law, saying</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn16">16</xref></sup> clearly indicating that he is speaking of the Law [which begins with the Ten Commandments in the next section of <italic>Va&#x2019;ethchanan</italic>]. And in that case [we must say] that in the [following] verse <italic>The Eternal our G-d spoke unto us</italic><sup><xref rid="fn17">17</xref></sup> an introductory expression of &#x201C;saying.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn18">18</xref></sup> is omitted. Similarly [there is an omission in the verse] <italic>And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Menasheh: &#x2018;for G-d hath made me forget all my toil&#x2019; &#x2026; And the name of the second he called Ephraim: &#x2018;for G-d hath made me fruitful.&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn19">19</xref></sup> Both verses omit the expression &#x201C;for he [Joseph] said&#x201D; [<italic>that G-d hath made me forget</italic> &#x2026; &#x201C;for he said&#x201D; <italic>that G-d hath made me fruitful</italic>]. And the purport of these verses here is as follows: &#x201C;These are the commandments which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the fortieth year from their departure from Egypt on the first day of the eleventh month <italic>according to all that the Eternal had commanded him for them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn20">20</xref></sup> this being after he had smitten Sihon and Og,<sup><xref rid="fn21">21</xref></sup> in the land of Moab, there Moses began to explain to them this Law, as follows. And he said: <italic>The Eternal our G-d spoke unto us in Horeb, saying:</italic> &#x2018;<italic>Ye have dwelt long enough</italic> etc.&#x2019;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn17">17</xref></sup> And the meaning thereof is that when Moses began explaining the commandments to them, he said to them at the outset of his words: <italic>The Eternal our G-d spoke unto us in Horeb</italic>, after He gave us the Ten Commandments, [ordering] that we conquer the Land at once and that we cross the Jordan. But your sins caused you this and that consequence [as Moses goes on to relate]. The words of this introduction continue until he concludes with the verse, <italic>And thou shalt keep His statutes, and His commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the Land, which the Eternal thy G-d giveth thee, forever</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn22">22</xref></sup> Then Moses called all Israel that were before him and said, <italic>Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the ordinances which I speak in your ears this day</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn23">23</xref></sup> and then began the explanation of the Torah with the Ten Commandments in order that they hear them with the explanation from the mouth of the one who received them from the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be He. Afterwards he informed them of the Unity of G-d, as it is said, <italic>Hear, O Israel: the Eternal our G-d, the Eternal is One</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn24">24</xref></sup> and all the commandments in this book. This is why Scripture explained here <italic>which Moses spoke unto &#x2018;all&#x2019; Israel</italic>, and there it is stated, <italic>And Moses called unto &#x2018;all&#x2019; Israel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn23">23</xref></sup> [emphasizing that <italic>all</italic> were present], because the explanation of the Torah and the completion of the commandments must be in the presence of &#x201C;all&#x201D; Israel just as was the Giving of the Torah [itself on Mount Sinai]. Now, because he [Moses] prolonged the words of this introduction, Scripture [in <italic>Va&#x2019;ethchanan</italic> where Moses finally begins explaining &#x201C;the words&#x201D; with which he began this opening verse] returned to the place at which it stopped at the beginning of the explanation of the Torah and said, <italic>And this is the Law which Moses set before the children of Israel; these are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, when they came forth out of Egypt</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn25">25</xref></sup> and mentioned that it was <italic>beyond the Jordan, in the valley over against Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn26">26</xref></sup> this being <italic>the land of Moab</italic> mentioned here<sup><xref rid="fn16">16</xref></sup> since Israel did not enter the land of Moab except what was made permissible for them by Sihon [who conquered part of Moab and became its ruler, thus removing that territory from the injunction that Israel may not wage war against Moab] as has been explained in the preceding book.<sup><xref rid="fn27">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus Scripture mentioned two things here. [The first thing is:] it stated <italic>that Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, according to all that the Eternal had commanded him for them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn20">20</xref></sup> this being an allusion to the commandments which he would tell them in this book that have not been mentioned thus far in the Torah. And it says that these commandments were exactly as G-d commanded him; he did not add to, or substract from what he had been commanded. It was necessary that this be stated [i.e., that Moses spoke <italic>according to all that the Eternal had commanded him</italic>] because Scripture does not state of them &#x201C;And the Eternal spoke unto Moses;&#x201D; therefore it included them now, [emphasizing] that they were all according to what he was commanded from the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be He. [The second thing is:] it further stated that <italic>Moses began explaining this Law</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn16">16</xref></sup> this being an allusion to the commandments which were already declared, that he would repeat them in order to clarify them further and to give additional instruction about them. And the meaning of the expression <italic>ho&#x2019;il Mosheh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn28">28</xref></sup> is that &#x201C;Moses wished&#x201D; to explain the Torah to them. This is said to inform us that Moses saw fit to do so although G-d had not yet commanded him thereon [but afterwards, when He commanded him to write down the whole Torah, G-d Himself said all these words that were originally spoken by Moses; and Moses wrote them as he was commanded. Hence there is no difference between the first four books of the Torah and this fifth book, Deuteronomy, as all are equally the word of G-d]. The word <italic>ho&#x2019;il</italic> is thus related to the expressions: <italic>&#x2018;ho&#x2019;el na&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>be willing, I pray thee</italic>), <italic>and tarry all night;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn29">29</xref></sup> <italic>would that &#x2018;ho&#x2019;alnu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>we had been willing</italic>) <italic>and dwelt beyond the Jordan</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn30">30</xref></sup> and so also many similar expressions.</p>
<p>2. IT IS ELEVEN DAYS&#x2019; JOURNEY BY THE WAY OF SEIR UNTO KADESH-BARNEA. The meaning thereof is that Scripture informs us of the vastness of the wilderness, that from Horeb, which they left, to Kadesh-barnea is a journey of only eleven days, since by way of Mount Seir it is near. Kadesh-barnea is at the end of the wilderness at the border of <italic>the hill-country of the Amorites</italic><sup><xref rid="fn31">31</xref></sup> which is the inheritance of Israel. There are the lands of Sihon and Og where Moses explained the Torah <italic>in the valley over against Beth-peor</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn32">32</xref></sup> Afterwards Scripture says, they went by way of the mountain of the Amorites <italic>all that great and fearful wilderness</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn33">33</xref></sup> and, following that, it narrates that in Kadesh-barnea,<sup><xref rid="fn33">33</xref></sup> which is at the boundary of their inheritance, they requested spies [to see the Land]. As a result, their journey was disrupted and they went [<italic>into the wilderness</italic>] <italic>toward the Red Sea</italic><sup><xref rid="fn34">34</xref></sup> &#x2014; <italic>backward and not forward</italic><sup><xref rid="fn35">35</xref></sup> &#x2014; until the completion of forty years. And because Israel was presently not in the wilderness, since they had already entered the land of Moab, earlier mentioned [i.e., the part which they took from Sihon and Og], Onkelos interpreted the expression <italic>in the wilderness, in the plain</italic> [<italic>These are the words which Moses spoke unto all Israel beyond the Jordan &#x2018;in the wilderness, in the plain&#x2019;</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn36">36</xref></sup> as being allusions to reproof [thus rendering: he reproved them &#x201C;on account of that which they provoked Him in the wilderness, etc.&#x201D;]. Moreover, why should Scripture mention all these places [<italic>in the wilderness, in the plain, over against Suph, between Paran and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn36">36</xref></sup> and specify signs and borders more than [the law requires] in selling a field&#x0021; [Therefore these place-names were interpreted by Onkelos as being allusions to certain deeds about which Moses reproved them.] And the sense of the Scripture according to Onkelos&#x2019; opinion is: &#x201C;<italic>These are the words which Moses spoke unto all Israel beyond the Jordan</italic>; he spoke of [that which they did] <italic>in the wilderness, in the plain</italic>, and <italic>over against Suph, between Paran and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Di-zahab</italic>, and <italic>the eleven days&#x2019; journey from Horeb</italic>,&#x201D; because he mentioned to them all that they had done in these places. Afterwards Scripture states that there, beyond the previously mentioned Jordan, Moses wanted<sup><xref rid="fn37">37</xref></sup> to explain the Torah after he reproved them, and he spoke and said, <italic>The Eternal our G-d spoke unto us in Horeb, saying</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn17">17</xref></sup> And so it is interpreted in the Sifre<sup><xref rid="fn38">38</xref></sup> according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah. Rabbi Yosei ben Durmaskis, however, holds that they were actual places called by these names.</p>
<p>4. AFTER HE HAD SMITTEN SIHON, THE KING OF THE AMORITES, WHO &#x2018;DWELT&#x2019; IN HESHBON &#x2014; for Heshbon was not his, but he conquered it from the king of Moab and he built it to be his royal capital. Similarly, <italic>and Og the king of Bashan, who &#x2018;dwelt&#x2019; in Ashtaroth, at Edrei</italic><sup><xref rid="fn39">39</xref></sup> means that it was previously <italic>the land of Rephaim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn40">40</xref></sup> [and then it was occupied by the king of the Amorites] as I will explain<sup><xref rid="fn41">41</xref></sup> with the help of G-d. And because Scripture states, <italic>who dwelt in Ashtaroth, at Edrei</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn39">39</xref></sup> it indicates that Ashtaroth is the name of a place in which Edrei is located [as will be explained further]. The text of the Sifre is as follows:<sup><xref rid="fn42">42</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>&#x2018;B&#x2019;ashtaroth&#x2019;</italic> &#x2014; it was as hard as <italic>ashtaroth</italic>. <italic>&#x2018;B&#x2019;edrei&#x2019;</italic> &#x2014; this was the seat of the government [i.e., the royal city].&#x201D; Rashi wrote: &#x201C;<italic>Ashtaroth</italic> &#x2014; is an expression denoting rocks and hardness. <italic>Ashtaroth</italic> is <italic>Ashteroth-karnaim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn43">43</xref></sup> where the Rephaim were, as it is said, <italic>and they smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn43">43</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;B&#x2019;edrei&#x2019;</italic> &#x2014; this was the name of the kingdom [indicating that the kingdom of Edrei was located in <italic>Ashteroth-karnaim</italic>]. And<sup><xref rid="fn44">44</xref></sup> so it is written, <italic>&#x2018;ashteroth&#x2019; of thy sheep</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn45">45</xref></sup> meaning, as Targum [Onkelos] rendered it [&#x2018;the flocks of thy sheep&#x2019;]. And our Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn46">46</xref></sup> Why is the name <italic>ashtaroth</italic> given to them [i.e., flocks of sheep]? It is because they &#x2018;enrich&#x2019; [from the Hebrew word <italic>ashir</italic> &#x2014; rich] their owners and strengthen them like these <italic>ashtaroth</italic> which are strong rocks.&#x201D; [This is Rashi&#x2019;s language].</p>
<p>Now the Rabbi [Rashi] incorporated into the word [<italic>ashtaroth</italic>] two meanings [strength and riches], but we do not know from what source the Rabbi inferred that <italic>ashtaroth</italic> is a name for rocks and stones. But it is possible for us to say that <italic>ashtaroth</italic> is a term for flocks of sheep, from the word <italic>ashir</italic> (rich) as in the words of the Sages [quoted above: &#x201C;Why is their name <italic>ashtaroth</italic>? It is because they enrich their owners&#x201D;]. <italic>Ashteroth-karnaim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn43">43</xref></sup> was a place of high mountains upon which there were strongholds of stone, these being likened by Scripture to &#x201C;the horns of cattle,&#x201D; just as Scripture likens them to &#x201C;teeth,&#x201D; as it says <italic>upon &#x2018;the crag&#x2019;</italic> [literally: &#x201C;the tooth&#x201D;] <italic>of the rock, and the stronghold</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn47">47</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>upon &#x2018;the horns&#x2019; of the altar</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn48">48</xref></sup> So also, <italic>&#x2018;b&#x2019;keren&#x2019; ben shamen</italic><sup><xref rid="fn49">49</xref></sup> [literally: &#x201C;in a fruitful &#x2018;horn&#x2019;&#x201D;] which the Targum [Yonathan ben Uziel] renders: &#x201C;On a high hill, in a fruitful land.&#x201D; There, [upon these high hills,] the flocks of sheep ascend, the he-goats, the she-goats, and the wild-goats<sup><xref rid="fn50">50</xref></sup> and their like; and therefore the place is called <italic>Ashteroth-karnaim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn51">51</xref></sup> [because the flocks which &#x201C;enrich&#x201D; their owners (<italic>ashtaroth</italic>) ascend to the &#x201C;horns&#x201D; of the mountain (<italic>karnaim</italic>)]. So also, <italic>and they served Baal and the Ashtaroth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn51">51</xref></sup> &#x2014; <italic>&#x2018;Ashtaroth&#x2019;</italic> because the idol was made in the form of a sheep in order to protect them [the flocks of sheep], in accordance with their foolish belief. [This is in line with our explanation of the word <italic>ashtaroth</italic> as a synonym for sheep.] Now at the foot of the mountain they built a city whose name was Edrei, this being intimated in the verse which states, <italic>and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, unto battle at Edrei</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn52">52</xref></sup> denoting that he gathered his entire army to the city where the palace of the king and the throne of the kingdom were. And this is the purport of the [following] Midrashic text [which seems to agree with Rashi&#x2019;s interpretation], wherein the Rabbis, of blessed memory, have stated: &#x201C;<italic>Who dwelt in Ashtaroth, at Edrei</italic>. Even if Og himself had not been difficult to defeat but had resided in Ashtaroth, he would have been difficult to defeat, because the city was a difficult one to capture etc.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn53">53</xref></sup> Therefore they interpreted, <italic>Ashtaroth</italic> to mean that it was &#x201C;as hard as Ashtaroth,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn54">54</xref></sup> [the phrase from which Rashi, quoted above, deduced that the word <italic>ashtaroth</italic> is defined as &#x201C;hard&#x201D;], as if to say that his residence was like the fortified city of <italic>Ashteroth-karnaim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn43">43</xref></sup> from which he and his family originated; for at that time he was not residing in Ashtaroth, but was residing in the land of the Amorites. And &#x201C;the place of the government&#x201D; [mentioned in the Sifre above] means that the city where he lived was Edrei<sup><xref rid="fn55">55</xref></sup> but Bashan was the name of the land of his kingdom.</p>
<p>6. THE ETERNAL OUR G-D SPOKE UNTO US IN HOREB, SAYING. In my opinion Horeb was the name of a place near Mount Sinai<sup><xref rid="fn56">56</xref></sup> where Israel dwelled in the year [of the exodus]. The wilderness was large and therein was <italic>the mountain which G-d hath desired;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn57">57</xref></sup> its name was Sinai and it is for this reason that the entire wilderness is called <italic>the wilderness of Sinai</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn58">58</xref></sup> as it were, &#x201C;the wilderness of Mount Sinai.&#x201D; Thus Scripture states, <italic>and they came to the wilderness of Sinai, and they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped opposite the mount</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn59">59</xref></sup> meaning that they encamped in the wilderness in a place called Horeb, this being opposite the mountain. It is possible that both the mountain and the wilderness were called &#x201C;Sinai&#x201D; because many <italic>sneh</italic> (thorn-bush) trees were there, and near that mountain was a locality or an inhabited city called Horeb, and there they stopped. And the verse which states, <italic>and he</italic> [Moses] <italic>came to the mountain of G-d, unto Horeb</italic><sup><xref rid="fn60">60</xref></sup> [which might indicate that the name of the mountain itself was really Horeb or, perhaps, that the mountain was in the region called Horeb], means that he came to Horeb where <italic>the mountain of G-d</italic> was. Now the <italic>sneh</italic> (thorn-bush) [out of the midst of which the angel appeared to Moses] was on that mountain. Moses [at that moment] was in Horeb, the place before it, nearby, where the camp of Israel stood for [close to] a year [after the exodus]. Therefore Moses said, <italic>I will turn aside now and see</italic> [<italic>this great sight, why is the bush not consumed</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn61">61</xref></sup> meaning that he will turn aside from Horeb [and walk] up to the mountain. At times Scripture calls the mountain itself [Horeb], as it is said, <italic>And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from Mount Horeb</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn62">62</xref></sup> that is to say &#x201C;from the mountain which was in the area of Horeb, in its vicinity or before it.&#x201D; Or it may be that Horeb was the name of the entire region and the mountain was within it. Similarly, <italic>Remember ye the law of Moses My servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, even statutes and ordinances</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn63">63</xref></sup> alludes to all that he was commanded on the mountain, and in the Tent of Meeting which was there in Horeb.</p>
<p>Now I have seen a Midrash in Yelamdeinu Rabbeinu:<sup><xref rid="fn64">64</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Yea, thou knewest not</italic><sup><xref rid="fn65">65</xref></sup> &#x2014; at Sinai; <italic>yea, thou heardest not</italic> &#x2014; at Horeb; <italic>yea, from of old thine ear was not opened</italic> &#x2014; in the plains of Moab.&#x201D; The Midrash thus intimates that Horeb is the place where the Tent of Meeting was, [thus confirming the view that Sinai and Horeb are different places]. However, Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra states<sup><xref rid="fn66">66</xref></sup> that Horeb <italic>is</italic> Mount Sinai, for, because of its desolation and dryness, the <italic>sneh</italic> (thorn-bush) grows there, so the mountain is known by two names [Horeb and Sinai], both being similar in meaning [&#x201C;Horeb&#x201D; referring to its desolate nature, and &#x201C;Sinai&#x201D; indicating the thorn-bushes that are products of the dryness].</p>
<p>7. TURN YOU, AND TAKE YOUR JOURNEY, AND GO TO THE MOUNT OF THE AMORITE etc. He mentioned to them the Land and the road that they are to traverse in their stages, and afterwards He said, <italic>Behold, I have set the Land before you</italic> which I swore to your fathers; <italic>go in and possess the Land</italic><sup><xref rid="fn67">67</xref></sup> &#x2014; this being a command, not just an assurance and promise, as I have explained.<sup><xref rid="fn68">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. WHICH THE ETERNAL SWORE. The reason [for using the third person <italic>the Eternal swore</italic> rather than the first person &#x201C;I swore&#x201D; which would be more appropriate, since G-d is the speaker] is similar to that in the verse, <italic>And unto Moses He said, Come up to the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn69">69</xref></sup> [rather than &#x201C;Come up unto Me&#x201D;]. There I have explained it.<sup><xref rid="fn70">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. AND I SPOKE UNTO YOU AT THAT TIME, SAYING: &#x2018;I AM NOT ABLE TO BEAR YOU MYSELF ALONE.&#x2019; [Moses&#x2019; statement here in this verse was actually said] before the Eternal said to us in Horeb, <italic>Ye have dwelt long enough in this mountain</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn71">71</xref></sup> according to the opinion of those who say that Jethro came <italic>before</italic> the Giving of the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn72">72</xref></sup> And the meaning of the expression <italic>at that time</italic> [in the verse before us] is &#x201C;while we dwelled at Horeb.&#x201D; But Moses mentioned it here [in Verse 9, rather than before Verse 6] to convey the following thought: We received the Torah, and you had judges and officers to judge you and lead you, and we were thus ready to enter the Land. <italic>And we journeyed from Horeb</italic><sup><xref rid="fn73">73</xref></sup> in our [four] divisions with our judges and our elders, <italic>and</italic> then <italic>ye came near unto me every one of you</italic><sup><xref rid="fn73">73</xref></sup> with your wise men and your leaders and you wanted spies to be sent, and thus the plan [for an immediate entry into the Land] was frustrated.</p>
<p>12. HOW CAN I MYSELF ALONE BEAR &#x2018;TORCHACHEM&#x2019; (YOUR TROUBLE) &#x2018;UMASA&#x2019;ACHEM&#x2019; (AND YOUR BURDEN), V&#x2019;RIVCHEM (AND YOUR STRIFE)? According to the simple meaning of Scripture, Moses our teacher alluded to them the three things which he told Jethro that he was doing for the people, as I have explained there.<sup><xref rid="fn74">74</xref></sup> He now mentioned them to Israel by implication. He said <italic>torchachem</italic> corresponding to <italic>and I make known to them the statutes of G-d and His laws</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn75">75</xref></sup> for it was a difficult &#x201C;task&#x201D; to teach those who had come forth from Egypt, the statutes and the laws of G-d, their meanings, interpretations, and secrets. He said <italic>masa&#x2019;achem</italic> corresponding to <italic>the people come unto me to inquire of G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn74">74</xref></sup> a reference to prayer, for he used to pray on their behalf. The word <italic>masa&#x2019;achem</italic> is related to the expression: <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;nasatha t&#x2019;filah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and thou lift up prayer</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn76">76</xref></sup> <italic>nor &#x2018;tisa&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>lift up</italic>) <italic>entreaty or prayer in their behalf</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn77">77</xref></sup> [He stated] <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;rivchem&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and your strife</italic>) which is to be understood in its plain sense &#x2014; matters of judgments [because judges must rule when there is strife among people]. Moses continued to state: <italic>Get you men who are wise, and understanding, and known among your tribes</italic><sup><xref rid="fn78">78</xref></sup> &#x2014; referring only to [the qualities of] judges. But he said unqualifiedly, <italic>and I will make them heads over you</italic><sup><xref rid="fn78">78</xref></sup> by way of humility.<sup><xref rid="fn79">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now Rashi quotes from the Sifre:<sup><xref rid="fn80">80</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>&#x2018;Torchachem&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>Your trouble</italic>). This teaches that they were troublesome. If one perceived that his opponent was winning a litigation, he would say &#x2018;I have witnesses to bring; I have evidence to present; I [exercise my right to] add judges to you [thereby increasing the size of the court].&#x2019;&#x201D; But I do not know [the validity of] this law that one of the litigants should have the right to add judges above [the usual number of] three in cases concerning monetary matters, and surely he has no such right after presenting his case before them and perceiving that his opponent was winning the case&#x0021; For, had he voluntarily accepted upon himself a relative or an unqualified person as a judge, he could indeed retract<sup><xref rid="fn81">81</xref></sup> prior to the rendering of the final judgment, but from those qualified to judge he cannot retract [his acceptance]&#x0021; Perhaps we can deduce from here the principle that a man can say, &#x201C;I choose two judges and you choose two other ones, and they [i.e., the four judges] will choose one more,<sup><xref rid="fn82">82</xref></sup> and let the suit be decided by five or more judges,&#x201D; just as the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn83">83</xref></sup> &#x201C;A suit decided by five [judges] is not comparable to one decided by ten [judges].&#x201D; Although three judges [have the power to] compel parties to come before them for judgment when one refuses to be bound by their decision, yet if one [of the litigants] desires to choose additional judges, he may do so, because it is similar to [the case of] one [of the litigants] who says, &#x201C;Let us go to the main meeting place of the scholars [to bring our suit before them on the assumption that superior scholars are better qualified to judge],&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn81">81</xref></sup> in which case we accede to him, provided it does not entail [undue] hardship, for in such a case we have been commanded, <italic>Justice, justice, shalt thou pursue</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn84">84</xref></sup> [which the Sifre interpreted]: &#x201C;Go to a reliable court,&#x201D; and an increase in the number constitutes &#x201C;a reliable court.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn85">85</xref></sup> Now in the wilderness, wise men were available to them and the litigants could say, &#x201C;Let us go before the officers of the thousands.&#x201D;</p>
<p>13. &#x2018;VIDU&#x2019;IM L&#x2019;SHIVTEICHEM&#x2019; (AND KNOWN AMONG YOUR TRIBES) &#x2014; &#x201C;men who are known to you. For if he were to come before me [Moses] wrapped in his robe, I would not know who he is and of what tribe he is, but you know him for you have raised him.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language quoting the Sifre.<sup><xref rid="fn86">86</xref></sup> And if so, <italic>&#x2018;l&#x2019;shivteichem&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>among your tribes</italic>) is connected with the word <italic>&#x2018;vidu&#x2019;im&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and known</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn87">87</xref></sup> But in line with the plain meaning of Scripture the purport of the verse is as follows: &#x201C;Get you, from each of your tribes wise men.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn86">86</xref></sup> And the meaning of the word <italic>vidu&#x2019;im</italic> in my opinion is that &#x201C;they are known as judges,&#x201D; that is to say, their capability is known and recognized as qualifying them to be appointed judges. Now [Moses] epitomized the qualities of the judges in the word <italic>vidu&#x2019;im</italic>, because the judges need to be <italic>able men, such as fear G-d; men of truth, hating unjust gain</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn88">88</xref></sup> as Jethro said. And these men [that were appointed] were known from the beginning to be judges, for everyone was saying, &#x201C;This one is fit to be a judge.&#x201D;</p>
<p>17. FOR THE JUDGMENT IS G-D&#x2019;S. The meaning thereof is as expressed in the verse, <italic>for ye judge not for man, but for the Eternal; and He is with you in giving judgment</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn89">89</xref></sup> meaning to say: &#x201C;It is for G-d to execute justice between His creatures for He created them with the intention that there be fairness and justice among them, and <italic>to deliver him that is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn90">90</xref></sup> and He designated you [the judges] in His stead. And if you will be afraid and act corruptly <italic>ye have sinned against the Eternal</italic><sup><xref rid="fn91">91</xref></sup> and you will have betrayed His mission.&#x201D;</p>
<p>18. AND I COMMANDED YOU AT THAT TIME ALL THE THINGS WHICH YE SHOULD DO. &#x201C;These are the ten differences between monetary and capital cases.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language quoting the Sifre.<sup><xref rid="fn92">92</xref></sup> And if so, Moses is speaking here to the judges [previously] mentioned, and he abridged on the ten differences [by not enumerating them], for they are all deduced from verses.</p>
<p>And in line with the plain meaning of Scripture, the reference here is to the statutes and laws, <italic>the way wherein they must walk, and the deeds they must perform</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn93">93</xref></sup> for he [Moses] personally commanded, warned, and taught Israel all these matters. And the reason for mentioning this [subject] here is because it is known that this was the substance of Jethro&#x2019;s counsel when he told Moses, <italic>Be thou for the people before G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn94">94</xref></sup> meaning that he was to pray in their behalf in the time of their affliction, and he further told him, <italic>And thou shalt teach them the statutes and the laws</italic> etc.,<sup><xref rid="fn93">93</xref></sup> meaning that he, himself, was to teach them the Torah. But regarding the execution of the law, Jethro advised him to appoint judges to assist him, and I have already explained it there.<sup><xref rid="fn93">93</xref></sup> Therefore, Moses related here that when he designated the officers over thousands and hundreds he delegated them only over the execution of justice. He, however, would personally teach them [the people] everything they were to do in accordance with the Torah, because he hearkened to his father-in-law&#x2019;s counsel <italic>and did all that he had said</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn95">95</xref></sup> Now Moses did not mention Jethro&#x2019;s advice here, nor did he attribute to him anything that Jethro proposed. It appears to me that Moses did not want to mention it [the fact that he was following his father-in-law&#x2019;s advice] in the presence of all Israel because of his humility,<sup><xref rid="fn96">96</xref></sup> or it may be that it would not be to his honor to mention to that generation that he had married a Cushite woman.<sup><xref rid="fn97">97</xref></sup> It is also possible that the reason [for not mentioning Jethro&#x2019;s name] was because he had consulted the Divine Glory and this matter was done at the command of the Almighty.<sup><xref rid="fn98">98</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. AND BRING US BACK WORD OF THE WAY BY WHICH WE MUST GO UP. &#x201C;There is no road which does not have crooked segments. AND THE CITIES UNTO WHICH WE SHALL COME &#x2014; first to capture.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. And so it is also stated in the Sifre:<sup><xref rid="fn99">99</xref></sup> &#x201C;There is no road which does not have crooked parts. There is no road which does not have traps. There is no road which does not have intersections. <italic>And the cities unto which we shall come</italic> &#x2014; so that we may know by which road to come.&#x201D; That is to say, from which direction we are to come into the Land so that we may capture those cities first. This is as I explained in the section <italic>Shelach Lecha</italic><sup><xref rid="fn100">100</xref></sup> that the Israelites requested spies only to show them the way.</p>
<p>23. AND I TOOK TWELVE MEN OF YOU. He did not praise them as being princes [of their tribes]<sup><xref rid="fn101">101</xref></sup> and their being <italic>leaders of the children of Israel</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn102">102</xref></sup> for, since they acted wickedly, he would not speak in praise of wicked men.</p>
<p>25. AND THEY SAID: &#x2018;GOOD IS THE LAND WHICH THE ETERNAL OUR G-D GIVETH UNTO US.&#x2019; &#x201C;Who were those who spoke well of the Land? Joshua and Caleb.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language quoting the Sifre.<sup><xref rid="fn103">103</xref></sup> But I wonder. If so, what is this complaint against them [the people]? It was proper that they should believe ten people more than two? Perhaps Moses complained against them: &#x201C;Since the Holy One, blessed be He, had informed you that it is a good Land, and the leading emissaries and the most righteous among them had also testified to that effect, you should have believed that the others spoke their piece out of lack of courage.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The correct interpretation is as I have already explained there:<sup><xref rid="fn104">104</xref></sup> All the spies admitted before Moses and Aaron and the whole congregation, saying, <italic>We came unto the Land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn105">105</xref></sup> Thus they were all in consensus on the goodness of the Land itself, but, with reference to the strength of those nations living there, they melted the people&#x2019;s hearts. Then, when [the ten spies] saw that Joshua and Caleb were encouraging the people to wage war, the spies came to the children of Israel not in the presence of Moses and they disseminated a slanderous report about the Land to the effect that <italic>it is a Land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn104">104</xref></sup> This is [what Moses meant when he stated here], <italic>and ye murmured in your tents</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn106">106</xref></sup> The people also did not mention this slander in the presence of Moses<sup><xref rid="fn107">107</xref></sup> for he would refute them because they [the spies themselves] did not say so at first [that the Land kills its inhabitants]; instead they admitted that it is a good Land, <italic>and surely it floweth with milk and honey</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn105">105</xref></sup> Rather, they said to Moses, <italic>Whither are we going up? our brethren have made our heart to melt, saying: The people is greater and taller than we</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn107">107</xref></sup> Therefore, Moses now said to them: &#x201C;It is true as you say that that people is great and tall, but <italic>the Eternal will fight for you</italic><sup><xref rid="fn108">108</xref></sup> <italic>according to all that He did for you</italic><sup><xref rid="fn109">109</xref></sup> <italic>from Egypt even till now</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn110">110</xref></sup> This, then, is the sense of the verse, <italic>Yet in this thing ye do not believe the Eternal your G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn111">111</xref></sup> which means that the hindrance [to your immediate entry into the Land] was only a result of insufficient faith [you had in G-d]. Thus the whole section is explained in accordance with the simple meaning of Scripture and its purport.</p>
<p>37. ALSO THE ETERNAL WAS ANGRY WITH ME, FOR YOUR SAKES. He is stating: &#x201C;Behold, the sin you committed then in the affair of the spies withheld from you the good Land, and yet you continued to sin another time [i.e., at the waters of Meribah] until you prevented me as well, from crossing [the Jordan].&#x201D; For Moses wanted to mention simultaneously that the punishment of all who were prevented from passing into the Land, was caused by their sins. Also in order to mention here the matter of Joshua,<sup><xref rid="fn112">112</xref></sup> that he would cross over because he followed G-d wholeheartedly as did his colleague [Caleb],<sup><xref rid="fn113">113</xref></sup> and, therefore, he will yet deserve to cause the second generation to inherit the Land, because Moses was punished and it was decreed upon him that he was not to cross [the Jordan]. Thus Moses mentioned the whole affair [of the spies] except for the death by plague of the spies themselves.<sup><xref rid="fn114">114</xref></sup> Nor did he mention the slander [of the spies that the <italic>Land eateth up the inhabitants thereof</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn104">104</xref></sup> for he would not speak of the shame of individuals. Instead he reproved the multitude all of whom sinned and all of whom were punished.</p>
<p>The meaning of the expression <italic>for your sakes</italic> [<italic>Also the Eternal was angry with me, &#x2018;for your sakes&#x2019;</italic>] is that <italic>the children of Israel strove with the Eternal</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn115">115</xref></sup> [at the waters of Meribah], and all this happened because of your quarrel. Or [the expression <italic>for your sakes</italic>] may allude to the fact that the anger [of G-d] with Moses and Aaron was because &#x2014; when they hit the rock twice<sup><xref rid="fn116">116</xref></sup> in front of the people [instead of speaking to it] and did not do as they were commanded &#x2014; the people were critical of it.<sup><xref rid="fn117">117</xref></sup> This is the purport of His words, <italic>because ye sanctified Me not in the midst of the children of Israel</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn118">118</xref></sup> meaning that the punishment came [not because the sin itself was so grievous, but] because it happened <italic>in the midst of the children of Israel</italic> that the Glory was not sanctified before their eyes. Thus the Rabbis have also said in the Sifre:<sup><xref rid="fn119">119</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Because ye trespassed against Me</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn118">118</xref></sup> &#x2014; you caused [the people] to trespass. <italic>Because ye sanctified Me not</italic><sup><xref rid="fn118">118</xref></sup> &#x2014; you caused that I not be sanctified. <italic>Because ye rebelled against My commandment</italic><sup><xref rid="fn120">120</xref></sup> &#x2014; you caused [the people] to rebel against My commandment.&#x201D; The Rabbis [in the Sifre] thus interpreted all these expressions as transitional to Israel, [meaning, Moses and Aaron had really not sinned in the affair of the rock, but since their action was misconstrued by the people causing the people to sin, Moses and Aaron were punished]. I have already explained the subject.<sup><xref rid="fn117">117</xref></sup></p>
<p>41. &#x2018;ANACHNU&#x2019; (WE) &#x2018;NA&#x2019;ALEH&#x2019; (WE WILL GO UP) AND FIGHT. The purport of the word <italic>&#x2018;anachnu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>we</italic>) [when it is already included in the word <italic>na&#x2019;aleh</italic> which means &#x201C;we will go up&#x201D;] is that &#x201C;we ourselves&#x201D; will go up and we will fight, and we will not leave the matter to our children after us, as you [Moses] have said.</p>
<p>45. AND YE RETURNED AND WEPT BEFORE THE ETERNAL. There [in the Book of Numbers]<sup><xref rid="fn121">121</xref></sup> Scripture did not mention this weeping, for there was no need to mention it. But Moses mentioned it now as praise that they regretted their sin, and to tell them that this sin was too great to forgive<sup><xref rid="fn122">122</xref></sup> because the great oath [of G-d] had already been pronounced, and a Heavenly decree accompanied by an oath cannot be rent.<sup><xref rid="fn123">123</xref></sup></p>
<h1>2</h1>
<p>4. YOUR BRETHREN THE CHILDREN OF ESAU. The reason for this expression is that descent of Israel is from Abraham and all his seed are thus &#x201C;brothers&#x201D; because they were all circumcised. This is the purport of the verse, <italic>Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite, for he is &#x2018;thy brother.&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn124">124</xref></sup> Only <italic>the sons of the concubines</italic><sup><xref rid="fn125">125</xref></sup> [of Abraham], Ishmael, Midian<sup><xref rid="fn126">126</xref></sup> and all children of Keturah<sup><xref rid="fn127">127</xref></sup> are not in this &#x201C;brotherhood,&#x201D; as we see from the verse, <italic>for in Isaac shall seed be called to thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn128">128</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. YE SHALL PURCHASE FOOD OF THEM FOR MONEY. If you should desire to eat of the fruits of their land you should not take it from them except <italic>for the full price</italic><sup><xref rid="fn129">129</xref></sup> at their pleasure, this being the sense of the word <italic>me&#x2019;itam</italic> (<italic>of them</italic>) [<italic>purchase food &#x2018;of them,&#x2019;</italic> i.e., with their consent]. Also you shall not drink water of them at all, except for money with their consent.</p>
<p>7. FOR THE ETERNAL THY G-D HATH BLESSED THEE. &#x201C;Therefore, you should not deny His goodness by behaving as though you were poor; instead deport yourselves like rich people.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. Now, I have not understood what he meant [by the next phrase in the verse, <italic>For the Eternal thy G-d hath blessed thee</italic>] <italic>in all the work of thy hand</italic>, since their blessings were heavenly blessings and they did nothing with their hands that it be blessed&#x0021; Perhaps the expression <italic>in all the work of thy hand</italic> alludes to the sheep and herds which they brought out from Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn130">130</xref></sup> They also had riches, herds, and acquisitions from the spoils of the Egyptians and the spoils of Amalek. Everything they possessed was blessed, similar to what is stated, <italic>Thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions are increased in the land</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn131">131</xref></sup> Moreover, the Eternal <italic>hath known thy walking through this vast wilderness</italic> and He supplied you there with all your needs &#x2014; the manna, the quails, and the waters of the well &#x2014; so that <italic>thou hast lacked nothing</italic> that is needed by wayfarers. And so it was &#x2014; they bought food and nourishment from the children of Esau as Moses said [to Sihon], <italic>Thou shalt sell me food for money that I may eat, and give me water for money, that I may drink</italic> etc.; <italic>as the children of Esau did unto me</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn132">132</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. THE EMIM ABODE THEREIN FORMERLY etc. &#x201C;You [Moses] might think that this is the land of the Rephaim which I gave to Abraham<sup><xref rid="fn133">133</xref></sup> because the Emim, who are Rephaim, dwelled there formerly, but this [the land of the Moabites] is not the land [<italic>that I promised to Abraham</italic>], because I drove out those Rephaim from before the children of Lot and settled them in place of the Rephaim. Those Emim were considered Rephaim,<sup><xref rid="fn134">134</xref></sup> like <italic>Anakim</italic> (giants) who are called <italic>Rephaim</italic> [from the root <italic>raphoh</italic> &#x2014; weak] because the hands of everyone who sees them become &#x2018;weak.&#x2019; <italic>Emim</italic> [from the root <italic>eimah</italic> &#x2014; fear] are so called because their &#x2018;dread&#x2019; lays upon people.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. And similarly he wrote [further, in connection with the land of Ammon of which Scripture states], <italic>That also is accounted a land of Rephaim:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn135">135</xref></sup> &#x201C;because the Rephaim dwelled there formerly, but that [land] is not what I gave to Abraham.&#x201D;</p>
<p>But I wonder at the words of the Rabbi&#x0021; Why should Scripture explain to us concerning the land of Ammon and Moab that it is not the land of Rephaim which He gave to Abraham? Was it to state that it was not due to Israel and was not part of the land which G-d swore to their fathers to give them? [That could not be the reason&#x0021; On the contrary,] Scripture states only, <italic>because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession</italic><sup><xref rid="fn136">136</xref></sup> meaning that, although it was part of Abraham&#x2019;s inheritance, the Holy One, blessed be He, gave it to the children of Lot for Abraham&#x2019;s sake. As Rashi himself wrote:<sup><xref rid="fn137">137</xref></sup> &#x201C;[The lands of] two nations [from among the <italic>ten</italic> nations originally given to Abraham &#x2014; Genesis 15:19-21], I gave to the children of Lot [Ammon and Moab] as a reward because Lot went with Abraham to Egypt<sup><xref rid="fn138">138</xref></sup> and kept silent concerning what Abraham said about his wife, &#x2018;she is my sister.&#x2019;&#x201D; Moreover, the Rabbi himself wrote with reference to Esau:<sup><xref rid="fn137">137</xref></sup> &#x201C;[The lands of] ten nations<sup><xref rid="fn139">139</xref></sup> I gave to Abraham. Seven of them will be yours. [Concerning the lands of] the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite &#x2014; which are Ammon and Moab, and Mount Seir &#x2014; one [i.e., Mount Seir] belongs to Esau, and two of them to the children of Lot.&#x201D; And if so, the lands of Ammon and Moab, and Mount Seir were certainly of the inheritance of Abraham; why then did the Holy One, blessed be He, say to Moses that he should not think that this [land of Ammon and Moab] is the land of Rephaim which was given to Abraham? What difference is there between [the lands of] the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite [which were promised to Abraham but given to the children of Lot and Esau], and [the land of] the Rephaim [which was also promised to Abraham]?<sup><xref rid="fn140">140</xref></sup> Moreover, the expression <italic>Rephaim dwelled there &#x2018;l&#x2019;phanim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>of old</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn135">135</xref></sup> indicates that it belongs to them because they dwelled there before anyone else, as in the verse <italic>&#x2018;l&#x2019;phanim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>of old</italic>) <italic>Thou didst lay the foundation of the earth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn141">141</xref></sup> [thus raising another question on Rashi&#x2019;s assertion: If the Rephaim lived there &#x201C;of old,&#x201D; why was this land given to the children of Lot]?</p>
<p>But the interpretation of the verses is the opposite of the Rabbi&#x2019;s [Rashi&#x2019;s] words. It was because the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, <italic>Be not at enmity with Moab</italic> etc. <italic>because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn142">142</xref></sup> Scripture tells that the land was indeed due to the seed of Abraham except that He gave it to the children of Lot. Scripture further says that in that land there dwelled of old <italic>a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn143">143</xref></sup> and, therefore, <italic>the Moabites called them &#x2018;Emim&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn144">144</xref></sup> because of the great &#x201C;dread&#x201D; which they cast upon those who saw them. Now G-d, in honor of Abraham, performed a miracle for the children of Lot. They defeated [the Emim] and drove them from before them; it is therefore not proper to take from them by force the land which G-d gave them through a miracle. <italic>&#x2018;Yeichashvu&#x2019;</italic> [<italic>They were also &#x2018;yeichashvu&#x2019; Rephaim</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn144">144</xref></sup> is an expression of importance and esteem, similar to the following: <italic>he was despised, and we did not &#x2018;chashavnuhu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>esteem him</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn145">145</xref></sup> <italic>who shall not &#x2018;yachshovu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>regard</italic>) <italic>silver</italic>?;<sup><xref rid="fn146">146</xref></sup> <italic>for how little is he &#x2018;nechshav&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>esteemed</italic>)?<sup><xref rid="fn147">147</xref></sup> and so many others. And in the language of the Sages we find the expression <italic>adam chashuv</italic> (an esteemed person).<sup><xref rid="fn148">148</xref></sup></p>
<p>This is why Scripture placed the statements in proximity to [the verse that discussed the lands of Ammon and Moab, the children of Lot]. <italic>And in Seir the Horim abode formerly</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn149">149</xref></sup> It declares that for the same reason He stated [for restraining Israel from attacking] Moab, He likewise withheld them [Israel] from attacking the land of Seir. Because formerly it also belonged to the Horim, and it was part of the gift to Abraham &#x2014; for the Horite is identical with the Hivite, and they [the Hivites] were of the children of Canaan, as it is said, <italic>Esau took his wives of the daughters of &#x2018;Canaan&#x2019;</italic> etc. <italic>and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon &#x2018;the Hivite&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn150">150</xref></sup> <italic>and Zibeon was of the sons of Seir &#x2018;the Horite,&#x2019; the inhabitants of the land</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn151">151</xref></sup> So, also, wherever the inheritance of Israel is mentioned, the Hivite is always included with the Canaanite among the seven nations,<sup><xref rid="fn152">152</xref></sup> because the Hivite is enumerated as the sixth son among the children of Canaan.<sup><xref rid="fn153">153</xref></sup> You will also see this in the narrative of the war of Amraphel which he fought against the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zebaiim, and Zoar,<sup><xref rid="fn154">154</xref></sup> who were Canaanite kings. They [Amraphel and his associates] <italic>smote &#x2018;the Rephaiim&#x2019; in Ashteroth-karnaim</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn155">155</xref></sup> <italic>and &#x2018;the Horite&#x2019; in their mountain, Seir</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn156">156</xref></sup> for the Horite and the Rephaim belonged to the Canaanite kings.</p>
<p>It is possible that [the Horite] was called <italic>Hivite</italic> [from the term <italic>chivi</italic> &#x2014; a snake] because he was like <italic>a serpent in the way</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn157">157</xref></sup> He was also called the <italic>Horite</italic> from the noun <italic>&#x2018;chor&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the hole of</italic>) <italic>the asp</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn158">158</xref></sup> For names [like Horite, Hivite] preserve the meaning and change letters, like <italic>Zerach</italic> (Zerah)<sup><xref rid="fn159">159</xref></sup> and <italic>Tzochar</italic> (Zohar),<sup><xref rid="fn160">160</xref></sup> of the expression: <italic>and &#x2018;tzochar&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>white</italic>) <italic>wool;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn161">161</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;tzchoroth&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>white</italic>) <italic>asses</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn162">162</xref></sup> [and in the case of the Horite and Hivite, the names were chosen to suggest the treacherous, snake-like nature of the people]. They also assign new names to praise [someone]. Thus the name <italic>Ya&#x2019;akov</italic> (Jacob), an expression of guile or of deviousness,<sup><xref rid="fn163">163</xref></sup> was changed to Israel [from the word <italic>sar</italic> (prince)] and they called him <italic>Yeshurun</italic> (Jeshurun)<sup><xref rid="fn164">164</xref></sup> from the expression <italic>whole-hearted &#x2018;v&#x2019;yashar&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and upright</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn165">165</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus Scripture is stating that the Horites [whose land was] given to Abraham<sup><xref rid="fn166">166</xref></sup> dwelled formerly in Seir, and the children of Esau who are of the seed of Abraham succeeded them and dwelled in their stead by a miraculous event. The Horites were a populous nation in their land and the children of Esau came to dwell there and overpowered them just as Israel did to the remaining nations [in the land that was] promised to Abraham, that G-d gave them in His great power. Thus G-d divided [the lands of] all these [ten] nations among the seed of Abraham &#x2014; one to Esau, and the balance to Israel who was the firstborn son.<sup><xref rid="fn167">167</xref></sup> It is therefore not proper to steal from Esau what G-d caused him to inherit, since G-d would be angry with anyone who would forcibly take from him [Esau] the inheritance that He, blessed be He, caused him to inherit, just as He would be wroth with him who would forcibly take the Land from Israel after He caused him [Israel] to inherit it, just as it says, <italic>As for all Mine evil neighbors, that touch the inheritance which I have caused My people Israel to inherit</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn168">168</xref></sup> This is the sense of the expression mentioned here, <italic>as Israel &#x2018;did&#x2019; unto the Land of his inheritance</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn169">169</xref></sup> when it was not yet done&#x0021; [But the meaning thereof is as explained: that just as G-d would be wroth with him who would rob Israel of his inheritance after He will have given it to him, in the same way, He does not give Israel the right to take the land of Esau after having given it to him.]</p>
<p>Similarly He further said with reference to [the land of] the children of Ammon that it is of the land of the Rephaim [which G-d gave to Abraham]<sup><xref rid="fn170">170</xref></sup> for that, too, belonged first to the Rephaim. The Ammonites called them <italic>Zamzummim</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn171">171</xref></sup> from the expression <italic>&#x2018;z&#x2019;mamo</italic> (<italic>his evil scheme</italic>) <italic>do not further</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn172">172</xref></sup> except that [the letters <italic>zayin</italic> and <italic>mem</italic>] are doubled [in the name &#x201C;Zamzummim&#x201D;], which thus indicates &#x201C;the people from whom nothing is withheld which they purpose to do.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn173">173</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. &#x2018;TEICHASHEIV&#x2019; (ACCOUNTED). The land of Ammon, too, is considered part of the land of Rephaim; in other words, it is included within it. Similarly, <italic>from the Shihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the border of Ekron northward &#x2018;teichasheiv&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>is accounted</italic>) <italic>to the Canaanites</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn174">174</xref></sup> So also, <italic>the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin; for Beeroth also &#x2018;teichasheiv&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>is accounted</italic>) to <italic>Benjamin</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn175">175</xref></sup> It is possible that such is also the meaning of the expression written above [with reference to Moab], <italic>these also are &#x2018;yeichashvu&#x2019; Rephaim</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn176">176</xref></sup> Scripture stating that the Emim who formerly dwelled there<sup><xref rid="fn177">177</xref></sup> are also &#x201C;accounted&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn178">178</xref></sup> Rephaim since they were part of them, and they were <italic>as the Anakim</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn176">176</xref></sup> and therefore they [the Moabites] <italic>called them &#x2018;Emim&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn176">176</xref></sup> [because their &#x201C;dread,&#x201D; like that of the <italic>Anakim</italic> (giants) lay upon the people]. This is the correct interpretation.</p>
<p>Thus the land of Rephaim was very large, and from it, Moab and Ammon took their lands. The balance remained for the Rephaim themselves, for Og, who dwelled in Ashtaroth, was of them, as is stated, <italic>and they smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn155">155</xref></sup> And in the Book of Joshua it is written, <italic>and cut down a space for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn179">179</xref></sup> Therefore, Scripture says of the border of Moab and Ammon that it is &#x201C;accounted to the Rephaim,&#x201D; [still calling them &#x201C;Rephaim,&#x201D; the name by which they were originally known]. The Moabites and the Ammonites were the ones that changed [the name of the Rephaim] to other names: [the Moabites calling them] Emim and [the Ammonites calling them] Zamzummim.</p>
<p>23. AND THE AVIM THAT DWELT IN VILLAGES. Scripture is stating of <italic>the Avim that dwelt in villages &#x2014; without a wall around them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn180">180</xref></sup> <italic>as far as Gaza</italic> which was the Canaanite border, as it is said, <italic>And the border of the Canaanite was from Zidon, as thou goest toward Gerar, unto Gaza</italic><sup><xref rid="fn181">181</xref></sup> &#x2014; <italic>the Caphtorim that came forth out of Caphtor destroyed them and they dwelt in their stead</italic>. Now the Caphtorim were descendants of Mitzraim<sup><xref rid="fn182">182</xref></sup> and their land was not part of the gift given to Abraham; nevertheless their land was possessed by Israel because the Caphtorim had conquered it from the children of Canaan. The verse stating with reference to the land of the Philistines, <italic>for unto thee</italic> [Isaac], <italic>and unto thy seed, I will give all these lands</italic><sup><xref rid="fn183">183</xref></sup> was said for this reason: that the land [of the Philistines] originally belonged to the children of Canaan. Therefore, in the days of Joshua Israel drove out <italic>the five lords of the Philistines: the Gazite, the Ashdodite, the Ashkelonite, the Gittite, and the Ekronite; also the Avim</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn184">184</xref></sup> for they all dwelled within the Canaanite border &#x2014; in Gaza, Ashkelon, Ashdod, and in Ekron. They [the lords] were called by the name of their place [i.e., <italic>the Gazite, the Ashdodite</italic> etc. because, although they were foreigners, after their conquest of these five Canaanite towns, they adopted their names], for they destroyed the Avim who were of the children of Canaan<sup><xref rid="fn185">185</xref></sup> who dwelled within the border of the Canaanite <italic>from Zidon, as thou goest toward Gerar, unto Gaza</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn181">181</xref></sup> <italic>and they abode in their stead</italic>. Zidon also belonged to the Philistines, as it is written, <italic>And also what are ye to Me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the regions of Philistia</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn186">186</xref></sup></p>
<p>In my opinion the Avim are identical with the Hivites [who were of the children of Canaan],<sup><xref rid="fn187">187</xref></sup> for such is the customary way of Scripture to alter names, as we have said, so long as they indicate the same meaning, and &#x201C;the serpent&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn188">188</xref></sup> <italic>ye&#x2019;aveit</italic> (curves) itself.<sup><xref rid="fn189">189</xref></sup> And in Bereshith Rabbah [we find the following text]:<sup><xref rid="fn190">190</xref></sup> &#x201C;Said Rabbi Eleazar the son of Rabbi Shimon: They were as expert in [tasting] earth [to determine which crops it is capable of producing] as the serpent [whose only food is the earth]. In the Galilee they call <italic>chivya</italic> (a serpent) <italic>ivya</italic>.&#x201D; The Sages used to call it <italic>achna</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn191">191</xref></sup> and also <italic>chachina</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn192">192</xref></sup> The Rabbis have interpreted:<sup><xref rid="fn193">193</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>&#x2018;Vayei&#x2019;ather&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and He was entreated</italic>) <italic>of him, and heard his supplication</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn194">194</xref></sup> Said Rabbi Levi: In Arabia they call <italic>chatirah</italic> (an opening) <italic>atirah</italic>&#x201D; [and the meaning of the verse is thus: &#x201C;and the Eternal made &#x2018;an opening&#x2019; for his prayer to be accepted&#x201D;].<sup><xref rid="fn195">195</xref></sup> The Rabbis have also said:<sup><xref rid="fn196">196</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>How hath the Eternal &#x2018;ya&#x2019;iv&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn197">197</xref></sup> <italic>the daughter of Zion in His anger&#x0021;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn198">198</xref></sup> Rabbi Chama the son of Rabbi Chanina explained it as follows: how has the Eternal <italic>chiyeiv</italic> (assigned guilt) in His anger&#x0021; There are places where they call <italic>chiva</italic> (guilt) <italic>iva</italic>.&#x201D; <italic>Chavkim</italic> (rungs) are called <italic>avkim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn199">199</xref></sup> Such [interchangeability of the letters <italic>a&#x2019;yin</italic> and <italic>cheth</italic>] is common in the language. Of Rabbi &#x201C;Chiya&#x201D; [the Rabbis say],<sup><xref rid="fn200">200</xref></sup> &#x201C;And what does &#x2018;Iya&#x2019; say of this matter?&#x201D; Our Rabbis were also accustomed to speak of <italic>heisei&#x2019;ach hada&#x2019;ath</italic> (distractedness or absent-mindedness) instead of <italic>hisa hada&#x2019;ath</italic> [changing the <italic>a&#x2019;yin</italic> of <italic>hisa</italic> to <italic>cheth</italic> of <italic>heisei&#x2019;ach</italic>]. In the Jerusalem Talmud, they always [use the term] <italic>hisiya</italic> [to signify &#x201C;distractedness&#x201D;].<sup><xref rid="fn201">201</xref></sup> And in the Mishnah we also find:<sup><xref rid="fn202">202</xref></sup> &#x201C;[If someone was clean] <italic>v&#x2019;heisia</italic> (and had given up the thought of) eating.&#x201D; Commentators have also said of the verse <italic>&#x2018;ushu&#x2019; and come all ye nations</italic><sup><xref rid="fn203">203</xref></sup> that it is like <italic>chushu</italic> (hasten ye). And in the Mechilta we find:<sup><xref rid="fn204">204</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Ufasachti</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn205">205</xref></sup> Rabbi Yashiya says: Do not read <italic>ufasachti</italic> (and I will protect), but read <italic>ufusati</italic> (and I will step over), meaning that G-d, blessed be He, will &#x2018;pass over&#x2019; the houses of the children of Israel.&#x201D; He [Rabbi Yashiya] made <italic>ufasachti</italic> refer to the word <italic>p&#x2019;sioth</italic> (steps) by interchanging the <italic>cheth</italic> with an <italic>a&#x2019;yin</italic>.</p>
<p>Scripture now finished informing us about the entire land of the Hivites that was lost [to them]. Part of it was taken by [the children of] Esau<sup><xref rid="fn206">206</xref></sup> and that is forbidden to us, and part of it was taken by the Caphtorim and we may take it from them.</p>
<p>And in Bereshith Rabbah<sup><xref rid="fn207">207</xref></sup> I have found that the Avim are identical with Rephaim [and not with the Hivites as we have stated hitherto]. Thus the Rabbis comment on the verse, <italic>The Nephilim were in the earth:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn208">208</xref></sup> &#x201C;The Rephaim are the Avim. They were called <italic>Rephaim</italic> [of the root <italic>raphoh</italic> &#x2014; weak] because the heart of anyone who beheld them became weak as wax. They were called <italic>Avim</italic> [of the term <italic>ivya</italic> &#x2014; serpent] because they were as expert as a serpent [whose food is the earth] in [tasting] earth [to determine which crops it is capable of producing].&#x201D; The Rabbis further said there with reference to G-d&#x2019;s gift to Abraham:<sup><xref rid="fn209">209</xref></sup> &#x201C;Rabbi Dostoie in the name of Rabbi Shmuel said: Because He does not mention here [among the lands of the ten nations given to Abraham] the Hivite, therefore, He introduced the Rephaim in their place.&#x201D; Now when I pondered this text, I found the matter to be true and authentic, correct and affirmed. For Moses our teacher mentioned to them the seven nations [whose lands] Israel inherited, as he said, <italic>and He shalt cast out many nations before thee, the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, seven nations greater and mightier than thou</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn210">210</xref></sup> Now six of these are mentioned in the gift given to Abraham,<sup><xref rid="fn211">211</xref></sup> but the Hivite is not mentioned there&#x0021; Then he [the Hivite] must in any case be either the Rephaim<sup><xref rid="fn212">212</xref></sup> or of the Kenite, Kenizzite, and Kadmonite<sup><xref rid="fn213">213</xref></sup> [all of whom are mentioned in the gift to Abraham]. All our Rabbis say<sup><xref rid="fn209">209</xref></sup> that Israel did not inherit [the lands of] the Kenite, Kenizzite and Kadmonite, but that He will make them inherit [those lands] in the future, and about them it is said, <italic>And when the Eternal thy G-d enlarge thy boundary, as He hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which He promised to give unto thy fathers</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn214">214</xref></sup> And so also it is not mentioned anywhere that they inherited them in the days of Joshua. If so, the Rephaim given by Him to Abraham must be the Hivite, who was the sixth son of Canaan,<sup><xref rid="fn187">187</xref></sup> and who was called Hivi by his father; while in the days of Abraham they surnamed him Rephaim. In my opinion the name Rephaim is derived from that of the <italic>Chivi</italic> [Hivite &#x2014; which as explained above denotes &#x201C;a serpent&#x201D;], related to the expression <italic>on the lair of the asp and on the viper&#x2019;s den</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn215">215</xref></sup> for things that are hidden in the earth [like the serpent], the [Hebrew] language calls <italic>&#x2018;rephaim&#x2019;</italic>, for example: <italic>&#x2018;ha&#x2019;rephaim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the dead</italic>) <italic>tremble beneath the waters and the inhabitants thereof;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn216">216</xref></sup> <italic>and the earth shall bring to life &#x2018;rephaim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the dead</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn217">217</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now the children of this Hivite were very numerous and, when <italic>the families of the Canaanite spread abroad</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn218">218</xref></sup> this family took possession of large territories, some of them called &#x201C;the land of Rephaim;&#x201D; others, [&#x201C;the land of] Horites;&#x201D; and some, [&#x201C;the land of] Avim;&#x201D; and generally they were all Hivites, and they were all Rephaim, just as, among our people [there are] Ephraim, Judah, Israel &#x2014; but generally speaking, all are [called] Israel. Now, these names [Rephaim, Horites, Avim] are all descriptives derived from the name <italic>Chivi</italic> [<italic>Hivite</italic> &#x2014; which denotes &#x201C;a serpent&#x201D;] since his name was Chivi they surnamed him Rephaim from <italic>chivya</italic> (a serpent) because the serpent dwells in the holes of the earth [and things that lie hidden in the earth are called &#x201C;Rephaim,&#x201D; as explained above]. They were likewise called &#x201C;the Horite&#x201D; and &#x201C;the Avim&#x201D; because of their association with the term serpent, as I have explained above.<sup><xref rid="fn219">219</xref></sup> Now the Holy One, blessed be He, gave to Abraham [the land of] the Rephaim in general,<sup><xref rid="fn170">170</xref></sup> and Moses mentioned to Israel &#x201C;the Hivite&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn210">210</xref></sup> which was the first name by which his father [Canaan] called him,<sup><xref rid="fn187">187</xref></sup> for the land of Rephaim was already divided in the days of Moses and parts of it [i.e., that belonging to Moab, Ammon, and the children of Esau] were forbidden to Israel. Thus Scripture comes here to mention the subject of the entire land of the Hivites, who are Rephaim, and all that was done with it. First it states<sup><xref rid="fn220">220</xref></sup> that the Emim were also of the Rephaim and the Moabites succeeded them. Then it states<sup><xref rid="fn221">221</xref></sup> that the children of Esau succeeded the Horites, who were also of the Rephaim. And then it repeats<sup><xref rid="fn222">222</xref></sup> that the land of Ammon was also the land of Rephaim, and all this was forbidden to Israel. He also narrated<sup><xref rid="fn223">223</xref></sup> that the Caphtorim who came from Caphtor took part of their land [i.e., of the Avim who are also Rephaim] and that [on account of the Caphtorim&#x2019;s prior conquest] it was permissible for Israel. Thus Joshua mentioned [to the children of Joseph] <italic>the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn224">224</xref></sup> [wherein they were to settle].</p>
<p>However, Rashi wrote:<sup><xref rid="fn225">225</xref></sup> &#x201C;The Avim were of the Philistine people,<sup><xref rid="fn226">226</xref></sup> for they are enumerated together with them in the Book of Joshua: [<italic>the five lords of the Philistines:</italic>] <italic>the Gazite, and the Ashdodite, the Ashkelonite, the Gittite, and the Ekronite, also the Avim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn184">184</xref></sup> But, because of the oath that Abraham had sworn to Abimelech,<sup><xref rid="fn227">227</xref></sup> Israel could not go into their land to remove them from their territory. Therefore, I brought upon them the Caphtorim and they destroyed them [i.e., the Avim who were Philistines] and they dwelled in their stead; now you are permitted to take it from them [i.e., the Caphtorim].&#x201D; But the intent of Rashi&#x2019;s words are not clear to me. For Scripture [in the verse from Joshua quoted above]<sup><xref rid="fn184">184</xref></sup> does not enumerate the Avim among the Philistines; instead it refers to <italic>the five lords of the Philistines</italic><sup><xref rid="fn184">184</xref></sup> and lists them &#x2014; and then mentions the Avim as a separate people. The verse states that <italic>from the Shihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the border of Ekron northward</italic><sup><xref rid="fn184">184</xref></sup> &#x2014; all this is accounted the land of Canaan; [the lands of] the five lords of the Philistines that it lists, with the Avim who are another people. But according to the Rabbi [Rashi] the land of the Avim became permissible to Israel because the Caphtorim had taken it from them, but who made permissible [the lands of] the other lords of the Philistines?<sup><xref rid="fn228">228</xref></sup> And why did the Israelites conquer all of them, for Joshua was the one who suppressed the Philistines and the Avim&#x0021; Moreover, [according to Rashi] why should the land of the Philistines belong to Abraham altogether and why did Abimelech find it necessary to make his covenant [with Abraham]<sup><xref rid="fn227">227</xref></sup> in this matter, when the Philistines are of the children of Mitzraim,<sup><xref rid="fn229">229</xref></sup> and so were the Caphtorim,<sup><xref rid="fn229">229</xref></sup> and they were not of the ten nations [given to Abraham]?<sup><xref rid="fn230">230</xref></sup> But the [fact of the] matter is the opposite&#x0021; For the Caphtorim and the Philistines [children of Mitzraim] destroyed the Canaanites, as indicated by the fact that Abimelech [a Philistine, not a Canaanite] was the king of Gerar, [indicating that the Canaanites had been driven out],<sup><xref rid="fn231">231</xref></sup> and the Gazite dwelled in Gaza, and Zidon was a Philistine city. All these were part of the Canaanite territories, as it is said, <italic>And the border of the Canaanite was from Zidon, as thou goest toward Gerar, unto Gaza</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn232">232</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now it appears to me that the Philistines and Caphtorim [children of Mitzraim] were considered one people, and so Scripture states, <italic>For the Eternal will spoil the Philistines, the remnant of the isle of Caphtor</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn233">233</xref></sup> And this is the sense of the expression [in the verse before us], <italic>the Caphtorim that came forth out of Caphtor</italic>. It was out of Caphtor that a small [band of] people came forth <italic>to sojourn where they could find a place</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn234">234</xref></sup> They destroyed the Avim who were of the seed of Canaan that dwelled as far as Gaza, and the Caphtorim dwelled in their stead in Gaza, Ashkelon, Ashdod, Gath, and Ekron &#x2014; all these places being within the borders of the land of Canaan and they divided it among their five lords. The name of these districts was Philistia and they were called Philistines. The Avim were left with the remainder of their land as Joshua mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn235">235</xref></sup> It is this which is meant by the verse <italic>the Philistines, the remnant of the isle of Caphtor</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn233">233</xref></sup> for the Caphtorim were Philistines. This is also the meaning of the expression, <italic>whence went forth the Philistines and the Caphtorim</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn236">236</xref></sup> as I have explained there.<sup><xref rid="fn237">237</xref></sup> As to what Scripture states, <italic>Have I not brought up Israel out of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and Aram from Kir?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn238">238</xref></sup> &#x2014; [which would seem to indicate that the Philistines were a separate nation that was redeemed from Caphtor just as Israel was a separate nation that was redeemed from Egypt &#x2014; thus contradicting Ramban&#x2019;s thesis that the Philistines and the Caphtorim were one nation &#x2014; the explanation is as follows:] The verse there is speaking of the wars of the Eternal. It was He Who brought up Israel from the land of Egypt <italic>by signs, and by wonders, and by war</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn239">239</xref></sup> and He brought up the Philistines from Caphtor, their land, because He brought them forth from there, to deliver unto them the Avim through a great miracle and <italic>they destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead</italic> [as stated in Verse 23 before us] and they left the land of Caphtor to their brothers.<sup><xref rid="fn240">240</xref></sup> Or the matter may have been as I have mentioned, that the Avim, the children of Canaan who first dwelled in the land, were known as Philistines because the name of the land was Philistia. When the Caphtorim that came forth out of Caphtor subdued them, they exiled some of them to their land Caphtor which was part of the land of Egypt, settling them among their brothers [the Caphtorim]. G-d redeemed them [i.e., the Avim who were known as Philistines] from there and they returned to their original place [in the land of Canaan]. We know not in which generation this happened. Thus the Philistines were inhabitants of the land of Canaan, and, therefore, Scripture states, <italic>The word of the Eternal is against you, O Canaan, the land of the Philistines; I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn241">241</xref></sup> And so Israel did not drive out the Philistines until the time of the oath had expired, when three generations<sup><xref rid="fn242">242</xref></sup> of Philistines in that land of Abimelech had died. And so the Rabbis have said in the Midrash:<sup><xref rid="fn243">243</xref></sup>&#x201C;<italic>For that was &#x2018;near,&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn244">244</xref></sup> [meaning] the oath which Abraham had sworn to Abimelech was yet &#x2018;near&#x2019; [i.e., was still in effect, because] his grandson was still living&#x201D; [and therefore G-d did not lead the people through Philistia after the exodus from Egypt]. This is a fitting and correct interpretation of this subject.</p>
<p>However, in the Gemara [of Tractate Chullin] in the Chapter <italic>V&#x2019;eilu Treifoth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn245">245</xref></sup> the Rabbis have cited an opinion in a dispute agreeing with the words of Rashi [that the Avim were Philistines]. Rav<sup><xref rid="fn246">246</xref></sup> said there that the Avim came from Teman, and we learned a Beraitha<sup><xref rid="fn247">247</xref></sup> that concurs with him. Teman is of the seed of Edom, as it is written, <italic>Of Edom, thus said the Eternal of hosts: Is wisdom no more in Teman?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn248">248</xref></sup> This is possible, and, [if so] Scripture is stating of the Avim, who are of the children of Esau, [that] part of their land was made permissible [to Israel] through the Caphtorim [who took it from the Avim], just as [parts of the lands of] Ammon and Moab were made permissible by Sihon [conquering them]. And what I have written is good and upright.</p>
<p>24. BEHOLD, I HAVE GIVEN INTO THY HAND SIHON. This statement is the same as the one stated below, <italic>Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn249">249</xref></sup> Before that, Moses sent to him [Sihon] messengers <italic>out of the wilderness of Kedemoth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn250">250</xref></sup> but after G-d had commanded him, [Moses, in Verse 24 before us,] <italic>begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle</italic> he would no longer send him <italic>words of peace, saying: &#x2018;Let me pass through thy land.&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn251">251</xref></sup> For if Sihon were to hearken to him, Moses would have been transgressing the words of G-d [by not waging war against Sihon as he had been commanded in Verse 24], and if Moses knew in advance that Sihon would not hearken, his message would have been pointless. [Therefore, we must say that Moses&#x2019; message to Sihon, as stated in Verses 26-29, was sent <italic>before</italic> G-d&#x2019;s command here in Verse 24.] Now, do not think of saying [that Moses&#x2019; message of peace] is in accordance with the commandment wherein we have been charged, <italic>When thou drawest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it</italic><sup><xref rid="fn252">252</xref></sup> [and, therefore, you might think that even after G-d told Moses to begin to possess Sihon&#x2019;s land he was still obligated to send the message of peace, here recorded in Verses 26-29 &#x2014; that is not the case]. For [in the injunction to call for peace] it is written, <italic>And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be, that all the people that are found therein shall become tributary unto thee, and shall serve you</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn253">253</xref></sup> Here, however, if Sihon had hearkened to them, they would not have touched him at all. But the meaning of the expression, <italic>and I sent messengers</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn250">250</xref></sup> is that &#x201C;I had <italic>already</italic> sent messengers.&#x201D; Moses, however, introduced the words of G-d [to begin contending with Sihon in battle with the fact that he sent a message of peace] in order to explain <italic>for the Eternal thy G-d hardened his spirit</italic><sup><xref rid="fn254">254</xref></sup> [a hardening of the spirit that took place following Moses&#x2019; <italic>earlier</italic> message when Sihon could have seized the opportunity to make peace], meaning to say that it was all caused by G-d, for so He told me.</p>
<p>25. THIS DAY WILL I BEGIN TO PUT THE DREAD OF THEE. This refers to Israel, meaning that all the peoples should fear them, and that the men of Canaan should go out [in battle] against them with melted hearts. G-d hardened their spirits, however, and they said, &#x201C;Our death through their sword is preferable to being slaves to them.&#x201D; For what sense is there to say of Moses, <italic>This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the peoples that are under the whole heaven</italic>, [meaning that the nations would fear Moses personally] when Moses would fight only with these two kings [Sihon and Og]? Rather, this is a promise to Israel and Joshua, as he said to Joshua, <italic>Thine eyes have seen</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn255">255</xref></sup> This then is the purport of the expression <italic>&#x2018;Begin&#x2019; to possess his land</italic><sup><xref rid="fn256">256</xref></sup> [meaning that Moses was to make the beginning of the conquest &#x2014; but the task is to be finished by Joshua and Israel].</p>
<p>34. AND WE UTTERLY DESTROYED EVERY CITY, THE MEN, AND THE WOMEN, AND THE LITTLE ONES &#x2014; who were of the Amorites, and they were commanded thereon, as it is said, <italic>But of the cities of these peoples, that the Eternal thy G-d giveth thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn257">257</xref></sup> Even so, Moses opened discussions with them peacefully, for such is the commandment [that even for the seven nations we were obligated to proclaim peace to them] as I will explain with the help of G-d.<sup><xref rid="fn252">252</xref></sup> But to Og the king of Bashan he did not proclaim peace because Og had come forth to battle against Israel before they even came to his city.<sup><xref rid="fn258">258</xref></sup> I have already explained the subject in the section <italic>Zoth Chukath</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn259">259</xref></sup></p>
<h1>3</h1>
<p>9. HERMON, THE SIDONIANS CALL SIRION, [AND THE AMORITES CALL IT SENIR]. &#x201C;But in another place Scripture states, <italic>even unto Mount Sion which is Hermon</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn260">260</xref></sup> Thus you see that the mountain has four names [Hermon, Sirion, Senir and Sion. Scripture&#x2019;s reference to this multiplicity of names is] to tell the praise of the Land of Israel because there were four kingdoms priding themselves in this; this one saying &#x2018;After me shall it be called,&#x2019; and another saying, &#x2018;After me shall it be called.&#x2019;&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language from the words of Agadah.<sup><xref rid="fn261">261</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is indeed possible that this praise [that four nations were vying for this mountain] is correct but the main purport of the verse is to state that the Sidonians, children of Canaan&#x2019;s firstborn,<sup><xref rid="fn262">262</xref></sup> called Mount Hermon &#x201C;Sirion&#x201D; when it was formerly in their possession; and the Amorites, who now dwelled there and from whom Israel was to capture it, called it &#x201C;Senir.&#x201D; [Senir] is a Canaanite word for &#x201C;snow,&#x201D; as Rashi testified about it, and as Onkelos also rendered it, [&#x201C;mountain of snow&#x201D;]. And because it is a mountain of snow, also on account of its frigid temperature causing it to be bleak [and unapproachable], it is called Hermon [from the word <italic>cherem</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;banned&#x201D;], this being a surname of the mountain. Perhaps the name &#x201C;Sirion&#x201D; in the Sidonian language indicates this characteristic while the real name of the mountain [as mentioned by the Torah further on]<sup><xref rid="fn260">260</xref></sup> is Sion. The verse stating, <italic>from the top of Senir and Hermon</italic><sup><xref rid="fn263">263</xref></sup> [which would seem to indicate that these were two separate mountains], really refers to two surnames of the [same] mountain and thus means &#x201C;from the top of the snow and the bleakness,&#x201D; or it may mean &#x201C;from the top of Senir and from the whole mountain.&#x201D; Similarly, that which is stated in the Book of Chronicles, <italic>And the children of the half-tribe of Menasheh dwelt in the land, from Bashan unto Baal-hermon and Senir and Mount Hermon where they increased</italic><sup><xref rid="fn264">264</xref></sup> also means &#x201C;and Senir and the whole mountain which is Mount Hermon.&#x201D; Baal-hermon, however, was a city or a tower which they called &#x201C;Baal,&#x201D; or perhaps it was the name of one of the Baal-idols that was worshipped there.</p>
<p>It is possible that after Israel was in the Land, names of places were somewhat changed; this mountain was large &#x2014; and they called the highest part of its summit Senir, and the second part thereof they called Hermon. Or they<sup><xref rid="fn265">265</xref></sup> may be other mountains which people after the [period of the] Torah called by these names [Senir, Hermon &#x2014; and they really represent two separate mountains, but the names mentioned in the Torah indicate different names of but one mountain, as explained above]. There are many cases like this. So also, <italic>and the Hermons from the hill Mizar</italic><sup><xref rid="fn266">266</xref></sup> [would indicate that there were other mountains by the name of Hermon, for otherwise we have no explanation why they called &#x201C;the Hermons,&#x201D; in the plural].</p>
<p>11. FOR ONLY OG KING OF BASHAN REMAINED OF THE REMNANT OF THE REPHAIM; BEHOLD, HIS BEDSTEAD WAS A BEDSTEAD OF IRON etc. The purport of the verse is to tell that this Og was called the king of the Amorites because he ruled over them, but he himself was of the Rephaim. And in order to tell of his height and strength, since the Rephaim were <italic>a people great, and many, and tall as the Anakim</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn267">267</xref></sup> it states that <italic>his bedstead was a bedstead of iron</italic>, no bedstead of wood being able to support him as it does other people. It is in the city of Rabbah which was his dwelling place, and when the children of Ammon destroyed the Rephaim as is mentioned above,<sup><xref rid="fn268">268</xref></sup> and his city [Og&#x2019;s capital, Ashtaroth] was captured, he alone was saved from the hands of the Ammonites. It is this which is stated, <italic>For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim</italic>. His bed was left there in Rabbah which now belongs to the children of Ammon, and the Ammonites preserved it as testimony that they destroyed a great and tall people; and the mighty man <italic>whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks</italic><sup><xref rid="fn269">269</xref></sup> &#x2014; from him they captured his kingdom. This is the sense of the word <italic>behold</italic> [<italic>behold, his bedstead</italic> &#x2026;], meaning: &#x201C;behold, the proof of [Og&#x2019;s strength] still exists; it is the iron bedstead, very long and wide, and is to be found in Rabbah of the children of Ammon,&#x201D; since his bedstead, which was in Ashtaroth, <italic>was plundered and lost</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn270">270</xref></sup></p>
<p>NINE CUBITS WAS THE LENGTH THEREOF [of Og&#x2019;s bedstead], AND FOUR CUBITS THE BREADTH OF IT, AFTER THE CUBIT OF A MAN. The meaning of <italic>after the cubit of a &#x2018;man&#x2019;</italic> is that of the biggest man [i.e., Og], just as the expression, <italic>be thou strong and show yourself a man</italic><sup><xref rid="fn271">271</xref></sup> [which means &#x201C;a strong man&#x201D;]. And in the opinion of Onkelos, <italic>after the cubit of &#x2018;a&#x2019; man</italic> means &#x201C;after the cubit of &#x2018;the&#x2019; man,&#x201D; and the translation thereof [in Aramaic] is &#x201C;the king&#x201D; [indicating that no ordinary man is meant here &#x2014; &#x201C;the&#x201D; man means the king]. Similarly, <italic>eth hakeves echad</italic><sup><xref rid="fn272">272</xref></sup> [which literally means: &#x201C;the one lamb&#x201D; &#x2014; should be <italic>eth hakeves ha&#x2019;echad:</italic> &#x201C;the one &#x2018;specific&#x2019; lamb&#x201D;]; <italic>balailah hu</italic><sup><xref rid="fn273">273</xref></sup> [should be: <italic>balailah hahu</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;in &#x2018;that&#x2019; night&#x201D;]. There are many similar cases. That is to say, [<italic>after the cubit of a man</italic> means] after the cubit of [&#x201C;the&#x201D; man] &#x2014; Og himself.</p>
<p>12. AND THIS LAND &#x2014; &#x201C;this land mentioned above, <italic>from the brook of Arnon unto Mount Hermon</italic><sup><xref rid="fn274">274</xref></sup> &#x2014; WE TOOK IN POSSESSION AT THAT TIME. FROM AROER, WHICH IS BY THE BROOK ARNON &#x2014; this is not connected with the beginning of the verse [defining <italic>this land</italic>] but with the end thereof: <italic>I gave unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites</italic>. But as regards the possession, it was <italic>unto Mount Hermon</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn274">274</xref></sup> This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. The correct interpretation appears to me to be that the verse is stating: &#x201C;<italic>and this land</italic> &#x2018;which&#x2019; <italic>we took in possession at that time</italic> [I allocated in the following way]: <italic>from Aroer</italic> [etc.] <italic>I gave unto the Reubenites</italic>.&#x201D; So also is the verse, <italic>and thou shalt let them know the way they shall walk therein</italic><sup><xref rid="fn275">275</xref></sup> [means &#x201C;<italic>the way</italic> &#x2018;which&#x2019; <italic>they shall walk therein</italic>&#x201D;]. There are many similar cases.</p>
<p>13. ALL THE REGION OF THE ARGOB &#x2014; ALL &#x2018;HAHU&#x2019; (THAT) BASHAN IS CALLED THE LAND OF REPHAIM. The meaning thereof is: &#x201C;<italic>and all the region of the Argob &#x2014; all &#x2018;the&#x2019; Bashan &#x2018;asher&#x2019;</italic> (which)<sup><xref rid="fn276">276</xref></sup> <italic>is called the land of Rephaim</italic>&#x201D; [I also gave to the half-tribe of Menasheh]. This usage [a letter <italic>hei</italic> meaning <italic>asher</italic> (which) or (who)] is also found in the following verses: <italic>And all &#x2018;hahikdish&#x2019; Samuel the Seer, and Saul the son of Kish</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn277">277</xref></sup> [meaning: <italic>asher hikdish</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;&#x2018;which&#x2019; he dedicated&#x201D;]; <italic>&#x2018;hahoshivu&#x2019; foreign women</italic><sup><xref rid="fn278">278</xref></sup> [meaning: <italic>asher hoshivu</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;&#x2018;who&#x2019; had married&#x201D;]. In all these cases the letter <italic>hei</italic> is in the place of <italic>asher</italic> (which or who). There are many similar examples. Now [Argob] was considered part of the land of Rephaim because of Og who ruled over it, or because it originally belonged to the Rephaim and was left to Og because he and the people that dwelled in it were of the remnant of the Rephaim.<sup><xref rid="fn279">279</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn15">(15) Further 5:6-18. In other words, the opening expression of the Torah here, <italic>These are the words</italic> &#x2026;, is not a reference to the words of Moses from the beginning of the book on, narrating the historical events of the journey through the wilderness, but primarily a reference to the Ten Commandments and the laws that followed, which Moses introduced with a review of their journey from Sinai to the Jordan followed with an exhortation to obedience.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn16">(16) Verse 5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn17">(17) Verse 6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn18">(18) Since we have explained the word <italic>leimor</italic> (saying) in Verse 5 as referring <italic>not</italic> to the contents of Verse 6 but to the Scriptural text of the Ten Commandments, Verse 6 should begin with a phrase explaining that it was Moses who was now speaking on a different subject &#x2014; not about the commandments, but about the history of the forty years. Thus the verse should begin, &#x201C;And he [i.e., Moses] said: <italic>The Eternal our G-d spoke unto us</italic> &#x2026;&#x201D;</ftnote>

This is generally translated: &#x201C;Moses began.&#x201D; Since according to Ramban, the explanation of the commandments does not begin until the Ten Commandments in 5:6, Ramban interprets the word <italic>ho&#x2019;il</italic> as &#x201C;wished;&#x201D; thus meaning &#x201C;Moses wished&#x201D; to explain this Torah; however, the beginning thereof is not here, but later on as explained.

<ftnote id="fn51">(51) Judges 2:13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn52">(52) Further, 3:1. This verse clearly indicates that Edrei is the name of a particular locality rather than the name of the entire country, hence it can be said that Og gathered his army there. This proves Ramban&#x2019;s explanation &#x201C;that Ashtaroth is the name of a region wherein Edrei is located.&#x201D; However, it could not be as Rashi explained that Edrei is the name of the kingdom, for if it were the name of an entire country, how could it be said that Og, gathered his army &#x201C;at Edrei&#x201D; when it is not the name of a specific, particular place? (Aboab).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn53">(53) &#x201C;And even if the city had not been difficult to capture, but Og resided in it, it would have been difficult to capture because its king was difficult to defeat. How much more so when the king was difficult to defeat and the city difficult to capture&#x201D; (Sifre).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn54">(54) In other words, the word <italic>Ashtaroth</italic> here does not indicate something hard. But because Og&#x2019;s royal city Edrei was well fortified, the Sifre compares it to <italic>Ashteroth-karnaim</italic> where the Rephaim lived and from where Og originated.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn55">(55) Thus, unlike Rashi who wrote that Edrei was the name of the kingdom, Ramban holds that Edrei was the name of the royal city, and the name of the kingdom was &#x201C;The Bashan.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn68">(68) Numbers 33:53, Ramban thus reiterates here his theory that the precept to conquer the Land of Israel is included in <italic>Taryag</italic> (six hundred and thirteen) <italic>mitzvoth</italic> which are binding for all times; that we are not to leave it in the hands of other nations, that we are not to leave it to waste, and that we are to dwell in it.

For, according to the opinion that Jethro came before the Giving of the Torah, the appointment of judges (recorded here in the following verses) took place almost a year <italic>before</italic> they moved away from Horeb. Hence we must say that the whole episode that begins with Verse 9 happened before Israel was commanded to journey from Horeb (Verse 6). And the expression <italic>at that time</italic> (in this verse) means &#x201C;while we dwelled at Horeb.&#x201D; But according to the Sages who say that Jethro came after the Giving of the Torah, the expression <italic>at that time</italic> means &#x201C;at that time when we were about to leave Horeb.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn79">(79) That is, Moses told the people that he will make these judges &#x201C;heads&#x201D; over them &#x2014; in all three of the above capacities: teaching, praying and judging. Actually, however, the &#x201C;heads&#x201D; were only for rendering judgment in matters of litigation between them, but not for teaching the statutes and the laws to the people, nor for praying on their behalf, those vital functions being the province of Moses. Yet Moses by way of humility said that he would appoint them to all three functions.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn83">(83) The precise source of this statement is unknown to me. Rambam states the thought as follows: &#x201C;Although a court of three judges is a perfect tribunal, yet if they are more, it is to be praised&#x201D; (Mishneh Torah, <italic>Hilchoth Sanhedrin</italic> 2:13).</ftnote>

Now Rashi, on the basis of the Sifre, connects the last two words &#x2014; &#x201C;known to your tribes.&#x201D; Ramban will explain <italic>l&#x2019;shivteichem</italic> as referring to the first part of the verse: &#x201C;Get you &#x2026; from each of your tribes&#x201D; and the word <italic>vidu&#x2019;im</italic> he will explain as meaning and known to be judges and being qualified.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn97">(97) Numbers 12:1. &#x2014; Since in the case of Zimri the son of Salu they chided Moses about the Cushite woman [that he had married before the Torah was given &#x2014; see Rashi, Numbers 25:6], he therefore avoided referring to it in order to prevent them from stumbling into evil speech (see my Hebrew commentary, p. 533).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn140">(140) In other words, Rashi wrote of the lands of the Kenite, etc., that, notwithstanding the fact that they were of the inheritance of Abraham, they were still given to the children of Lot for the reason stated by Rashi that Lot protected Abraham&#x2019;s secret in Egypt. Similarly we could say that the land of the Rephaim, too, was originally destined for Abraham, but that G-d gave it to another nation.

<ftnote id="fn194">(194) II Chronicles 33:13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn195">(195) The text refers to Menasheh, king of Judah, who for a long time worshipped the idols. When the Assyrians came and carried him off to Babylon and placed him in an oven heated from below, Menasheh began calling upon idol after idol to rescue him. When no help came he turned his supplication to G-d. The attribute of mercy prevented Menasheh&#x2019;s repentance from being accepted because he had lived so wicked a life, but the Holy One, blessed be He, &#x201C;made an opening&#x201D; in the Throne of His Glory &#x201C;and received his prayer&#x201D; (Sanhedrin 103a). The verse concludes, <italic>He brought him back to Jerusalem into his kingdom</italic>. Ramban uses this text to prove that the letter <italic>a&#x2019;yin</italic> [in the word <italic>vayei&#x2019;ather</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;and He was entreated&#x201D;] interchanges with the <italic>cheth</italic> [<italic>vayeichather</italic> &#x2014; and He made &#x201C;an opening&#x201D;]. This is an additional support to Ramban&#x2019;s thesis that the Avim are identical with the Chivim &#x2014; the Hivites. Ramban will go on to cite several further examples of the interchangeability of the letters <italic>a&#x2019;yin</italic> and <italic>cheth</italic>. &#x2014; In conclusion it should be noted that the episode with Menasheh, king of Judah, illustrates the efficacy of repentance under all circumstances, for even when all the &#x201C;gates&#x201D; were closed to his supplication, Menasheh&#x2019;s prayers were yet accepted through a special &#x201C;opening&#x201D; in the &#x201C;Throne of the Almighty.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn219">(219) Ramban refers to his explanation above that the letters <italic>cheth</italic> and <italic>a&#x2019;yin</italic> interchange. Now since <italic>chivya</italic> is a snake, the word &#x201C;Avim&#x201D; likewise denotes the same.

<ftnote id="fn225">(225) On Verse 23 before us.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn226">(226) The Philistines were descendants of Mitzraim (Genesis 10:14). Thus, while according to Ramban, as explained above, the Avim who are identical with the Hivites and Rephaim were descendants of Canaan whose land was permissible to Israel, Rashi holds the Avim to have been part of the Philistines who were descendants of Mitzraim. Now, both Mitzraim and Canaan were sons of Ham (<italic>ibid.</italic>, Verse 6). But only the land of the children of Canaan was given to Abraham. How Rashi&#x2019;s opinion affects the subject under consideration will be made clear in the text which follows.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn227">(227) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, 21:24.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn228">(228) But according to Ramban, as explained at the beginning of this verse, the Philistines had taken their land from the children of Canaan, all of whose lands were given to Abraham. Since the Avim [identical with the Hivite who is mentioned in Genesis 10:17 as a son of Canaan] were one of the ten children of Canaan, it is self-understood that their land was permissible to Israel. Verse 23 here, telling that the Caphtorim [who were of the children of Mitzraim, like the Philistines &#x2014; Genesis 10:14] destroyed the Avim, serves the purpose of informing Israel that they should not be misled into thinking that the land is forbidden to them because the Caphtorim were not descended from Canaan. Therefore, the verse informs us that the Caphtorim had taken it from the Avim who <italic>are</italic> Canaanites and, consequently, their land is permissible to Israel. The same was true of the five lords of the Philistines who had taken the land away from the Canaanites; hence Joshua was permitted to take it from them. All this explains Ramban&#x2019;s interpretation. Rashi, however, wrote that the Avim were part of the Philistine people, and Verse 23 before us informs us that their land was made permissible to Israel because the Caphtorim had taken it from them. On this Ramban asks: if so, what made the lands of the five lords of the Philistines permissible to Israel? There are other questions as well, which Ramban raises on Rashi&#x2019;s interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn229">(229) Genesis 10:13-14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn230">(230) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, 15:19-21. &#x2014; The question on Rashi is thus made all the stronger: If the Avim and the Caphtorim were Philistines, why should the land of the Avim have become permissible to Israel as a result of its conquest by the Caphtorim? Whichever of the two held the land, it was a Philistine possession and Philistia was not permissible to Israel.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn234">(234) Judges 17:8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn235">(235) This refers to Joshua 13:3 [quoted above] where, after mentioning the five lords of the Philistines, he cites <italic>&#x2018;also the Avim.&#x2019;</italic> According to Ramban this indicates that the Philistines [who are identical with the Caphtorim, as explained] took but part of the land of the Avim [as stated in Verse 23 before us] while the Avim were still left with part of their land. Now, since the Avim are identical with the Hivites who were of the children of Canaan, Joshua was permitted to take the entire original land of the Avim &#x2014; what had been conquered by the five lords of the Philistines, as well as what was still in the hands of the Avim.</ftnote>

<title>Va&#x2019;ethchanan</title>
<p>23. AND I BESOUGHT THE ETERNAL AT THAT TIME, SAYING. [The time referred to, is] when Moses mentioned the conquest of the lands of Sihon and Og. He said, <italic>And I commanded Joshua at that time</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn280">1</xref></sup> intimating, that &#x201C;I [Moses] will not go over there, for I besought <italic>the Glorious Name</italic><sup><xref rid="fn281">2</xref></sup> [to rescind the decree forbidding me to enter the Land], but He hearkened not to me and He commanded me to charge Joshua, <italic>for he shall go over before this people.&#x201D;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn282">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The purport of the expression <italic>at that time</italic> is that it alludes to the time of the decree that he mentioned, <italic>Also the Eternal was angry with me</italic> [<italic>for your sakes, saying: &#x2018;Thou shalt not go in thither</italic>&#x2019;],<sup><xref rid="fn283">4</xref></sup> though [Moses&#x2019;] supplication is not mentioned there on the day of that event. The correct interpretation, however, is that the expression <italic>at that time</italic> refers to the time mentioned: &#x201C;when I conquered Sihon and Og and I began to war against the nations given to Israel and I allocated the land to the two tribes [Reuben and Gad].&#x201D; In that case, this supplication [referred to here] was offered when it was said to Moses, <italic>Get thee up into this mountain of A barim</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn284">5</xref></sup> for it was then that he sought mercy in the matter and entreated this supplication. And when G-d did not hearken to his voice, he again prayed, <italic>Let the Eternal, the G-d of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn285">6</xref></sup> as is mentioned there. It is this verse, <italic>And charge Joshua</italic><sup><xref rid="fn282">3</xref></sup> [that constitutes the answer to Moses&#x2019; second request]. Now, there [in the Book of Numbers] Scripture mentioned the <italic>prayer</italic> on which he was affirmatively answered [namely, the appointment of a successor]<sup><xref rid="fn286">7</xref></sup> and here he mentioned this [unsuccessful prayer] in order to inform the people that, although the Land was beloved to him, he did not merit [to enter] it because of them. All this was part of his reproof.</p>
<p>24. G-D THE ETERNAL &#x2014; &#x201C;merciful in judgment.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. Now, the Rabbi did not consider that the first Divine Name is spelled with the letters <italic>Aleph Dalet</italic> and the second Name is spelled with the letters <italic>Yod Hei</italic> [i.e., the Tetragrammaton].<sup><xref rid="fn287">8</xref></sup> In this regard [i.e., the Tetragrammaton], the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn288">9</xref></sup> &#x201C;Wherever Scripture states &#x2018;the Eternal&#x2019; [i.e., the Tetragrammaton] it signifies the attribute of mercy, and [wherever it mentions] &#x2018;G-d&#x2019; (<italic>Elokim</italic>) it indicates the attribute of judgment.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn289">10</xref></sup> Rather, the Divine Names written here mean: &#x201C;Lord<sup><xref rid="fn290">11</xref></sup> in the attribute of mercy.&#x201D; And so the Rabbis have said in [Midrash] Yelamdeinu:<sup><xref rid="fn291">12</xref></sup> &#x201C;Moses said to G-d: &#x2018;Master of the worlds&#x0021; If it is justly requested by me [that You grant my supplication] give it to me, and if it is not justly requested by me, have mercy on me,&#x2019; just as Abraham said, <italic>O Lord Eternal, what wilt Thou give me</italic> etc.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn292">13</xref></sup> Also in the case of Abraham, the Divine Names are written in this order: the first one with <italic>Aleph Dalet</italic>, and the second with <italic>Yod Hei</italic>. And the purport of the section [before us] will be understood [by the fact that the Divine Names are written in this particular order]. For Moses stated <italic>va&#x2019;ethchanan</italic> (and I besought) and he did not say <italic>va&#x2019;ethpaleil</italic> (and I prayed), since he spoke in &#x201C;supplication&#x201D; [to <italic>the Glorious Name</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn293">14</xref></sup> saying: &#x201C;O Lord in Whom is the mercy, <italic>Thou hast begun to show Thy servant</italic>. Such was the beginning of my prophecy that You showed me Your glory &#x2014; as it is written [at Moses&#x2019; first vision of G-d&#x2019;s glory], <italic>And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon G-d</italic><sup><xref rid="fn294">15</xref></sup> &#x2014; together with <italic>the greatness and the power</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn295">16</xref></sup> and I learned to know <italic>what deity is there in heaven or on earth</italic> from whom could come forth <italic>like Thy</italic> great <italic>works and Thy mighty prowess</italic>?&#x201D; From here you will further understand the matter concerning which <italic>the Glorious Name</italic> was angry with Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn296">17</xref></sup> However, the language of the Sifre is as follows:<sup><xref rid="fn297">18</xref></sup> &#x201C;Wherever Scripture mentions &#x2018;the Eternal&#x2019; it signifies the attribute of mercy, as it is said, <italic>The Eternal, G-d, gracious and merciful</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn298">19</xref></sup> [and wherever it mentions] G-d (<italic>Elokim</italic>) it indicates the attribute of judgment, as it is said, <italic>before &#x2018;ha&#x2019;elohim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the judges</italic>) <italic>shall come the word of both</italic>. &#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn299">20</xref></sup> And the intent [of the Sifre] is to explain that the second [Divine] Name mentioned here indicates the attribute of mercy, this being the Proper Divine Name, while all other Names signify the attribute of judgment, like <italic>Elokim</italic> which is also a term for judges, and certainly the Name <italic>Aleph Dalet</italic> which is an expression of lordship.</p>
<p>Thus Moses completed the words of reproof with this episode in which he informed the people that their fathers caused themselves evil, and also caused him [Moses] to suffer punishment preventing them from going over into the Land. They, the children, however, will go over and inherit it, if they will <italic>not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn300">21</xref></sup> Therefore he now began to warn them about the principles of the commandments that they should not add to them, neither diminish from them.</p>
<h1>4</h1>
<p>2. YE SHALL NOT ADD [UNTO THE WORD WHICH I COMMAND YOU] &#x2014; &#x201C;such as placing five sections [of the Torah] in the phylacteries, five species in a <italic>lulav</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn301">22</xref></sup> five fringes [in a garment].<sup><xref rid="fn302">23</xref></sup> The same principle applies to the prohibition, <italic>neither shall ye diminish from it</italic>&#x201D; [by placing three sections of the Torah in the phylacteries etc.]. This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. And thus the Rabbis said in the Sifre:<sup><xref rid="fn303">24</xref></sup> &#x201C;Whence do we know that you are not to add to [the four species in the commandment of] the <italic>lulav</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn301">22</xref></sup> nor to the [four] fringes?<sup><xref rid="fn302">23</xref></sup> Scripture therefore says, <italic>Ye shall not add</italic>. And whence do we know that you are not to diminish from them? Because Scripture states, <italic>neither shall ye diminish</italic>. Whence do we know that if [a priest] began to recite the Priestly Blessing<sup><xref rid="fn304">25</xref></sup> he is not to say: &#x2018;Since I began to bless [the people], I will [further] say, <italic>The Eternal, the G-d of your fathers, make you a thousand times so many more as ye are?</italic>&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn305">26</xref></sup> Because Scripture states, [<italic>Ye shall not add</italic>] <italic>unto the &#x2018;word&#x2019;</italic> &#x2014; even &#x2018;a word&#x2019; you are not to add to it.&#x201D; However, not only concerning these [commandments] have the Rabbis said [that the prohibitions neither to add nor to diminish, apply], but also in the case of someone who sleeps in a Booth on the eighth Day [of the Festival of Tabernacles]<sup><xref rid="fn306">27</xref></sup> with the intent [of performing a religious duty] that he is liable to whipping [for having added to the commandment], as is mentioned in Tractate Rosh Hashanah.<sup><xref rid="fn307">28</xref></sup> So also if he were to observe the Festival of Tabernacles for only six days, he would be transgressing this negative commandment [<italic>neither shall ye diminish from it</italic>].</p>
<p>In my opinion, even if someone devised an independent commandment [rather than altering an existing one] such as establishing a festival <italic>in a month which he had devised of his own accord</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn308">29</xref></sup> as Jeroboam did,<sup><xref rid="fn308">29</xref></sup> he transgresses the negative commandment [<italic>Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you</italic>]. And so did the Rabbis say with reference to the reading of the Scroll of Esther [on Purim]:<sup><xref rid="fn309">30</xref></sup> &#x201C;One hundred and eighty prophets<sup><xref rid="fn310">31</xref></sup> arose in Israel and they did not diminish from nor add even one letter to what was written in the Torah, except for reading the Scroll of Esther [which was instituted by the prophets]. What basis did they have for that? etc.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn311">32</xref></sup> And in the Yerushalmi it is stated:<sup><xref rid="fn312">33</xref></sup> &#x201C;Eighty-five elders, among them many prophets, were troubled about the matter [of the new duty to read the Scroll of Esther]. They said, &#x2018;It is written, <italic>These are the commandments which the Eternal commanded Moses</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn313">34</xref></sup> These are the commandments that [we] were ordered by the mouth of Moses, and Moses told us that no other prophet is destined to establish anything new for you &#x2014; and Mordecai and Esther want to establish something new for us&#x0021;&#x2019; They did not move from there while discussing the matter, until the Holy One, blessed be He, enlightened their eyes [and they found the new commandment intimated in the Torah, Prophets, and Writings].&#x201D; Thus you see that [the institution of] this commandment [of reading the Scroll of Esther on Purim] would have been forbidden to them [were it not for the fact that ultimately they found it intimated in the Torah, etc.]; otherwise it would have been included in the principle, <italic>thou shalt not add thereto</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn314">35</xref></sup> However, the prohibition against adding [to the Torah] by word of a prophet we derive only from the verse stating, <italic>These are the commandments</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn313">34</xref></sup> which establishes,<sup><xref rid="fn315">36</xref></sup> &#x201C;From now on, no prophet is permitted to originate anything [in the Torah].&#x201D; Whatever [laws] the Sages have established in the nature of &#x201C;a fence [around the Torah],&#x201D; such as the secondary degrees of forbidden marriages<sup><xref rid="fn316">37</xref></sup> &#x2014; that activity of [establishing fences] is itself a requirement of the Torah, provided only that one realizes that these [laws] are a result of a particular fence and that they are not [expressly] from the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be He, in the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn317">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. YOUR EYES HAVE SEEN. Now Moses comes to forewarn on the details of the commandments, and he begins with [the prohibition against] idolatry which is the root of all [the commandments].</p>
<p>5. BEHOLD, I HAVE TAUGHT YOU. The meaning thereof is: &#x201C;Behold, I teach you today,&#x201D; just as he said, <italic>which I command you this day</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn318">39</xref></sup> <italic>and which I set before you this day</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn319">40</xref></sup> Or the meaning of the expression <italic>I have taught you</italic> may be that since he mentioned <italic>that ye should do so in the midst of the Land whither ye go in to possess it</italic><sup><xref rid="fn320">41</xref></sup> he is then saying: &#x201C;Behold, at the time when you come into the Land, that I had already taught you <italic>statutes and ordinances, even as the Eternal my G-d commanded me</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn320">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now Moses spoke first of a matter which is basic to all positive and negative commandments [namely, idolatry, which as mentioned above, is &#x201C;the root of all&#x201D; the commandments],<sup><xref rid="fn321">42</xref></sup> and now he admonished them concerning &#x201C;the statutes,&#x201D; which are His decrees, and &#x201C;the ordinances,&#x201D; which are the laws, for these need greater reinforcement because the reason for the statutes is hidden from us and also because it is by <italic>mishpat</italic> (justice) &#x2014; [ordinances] &#x2014; that they will <italic>establish the Land</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn322">43</xref></sup> And then he states <italic>that ye should do so in the midst of the Land</italic><sup><xref rid="fn320">41</xref></sup> in order to admonish concerning all [commandments], for there are many statutes and ordinances which do not apply outside of the Land; or perhaps it suggests that the primary duty [of the fulfillment] of the commandments is in the Land, as I have hinted concerning the secret of [the sanctity of] the Land.<sup><xref rid="fn323">44</xref></sup> He states further that in the statutes and ordinances there are great benefits that bring honor from men to those who observe them. Even their enemies will praise them for [observing the commandments].<sup><xref rid="fn324">45</xref></sup> Moreover, a great, incomparable benefit is that G-d would be near to them whensoever they call upon Him.<sup><xref rid="fn325">46</xref></sup> The nations also will contemplate this and know that the statutes were ordained in wisdom and understanding so as to bring the people near to G-d, and they will fear them [i.e., the Israelites], this being the purport of what he said, <italic>For what great nation is there that hath G-d so nigh unto them</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn325">46</xref></sup> Additionally, the statutes and ordinances are righteous in themselves,<sup><xref rid="fn326">47</xref></sup> fair and good for the welfare of society and countries.</p>
<p>9. ONLY TAKE HEED TO THYSELF etc. LEST THOU FORGET THE THINGS. &#x201C;[Only] then when you will not forget them and fulfill them in their true form, will you be accounted wise and understanding men; but if you pervert them due to forgetfulness you will be regarded as fools.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. But it is completely incorrect.<sup><xref rid="fn327">48</xref></sup> Rather, this verse, in my opinion, is a negative commandment in which he admonishes [us] severely [as follows]: For, as he stated that we should be careful concerning all the commandments and be heedful to perform the statutes and the ordinances, he again stated: &#x201C;Only I warn you exceedingly to take heed and guard yourselves very, very much to remember whence the commandments came to you, that you should not forget the Revelation on Mount Sinai,<sup><xref rid="fn328">49</xref></sup> nor all the things which your eyes saw there &#x2014; <italic>the thunderings, and the lightnings</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn329">50</xref></sup> <italic>His glory and His greatness</italic><sup><xref rid="fn330">51</xref></sup> and His words that you have heard there <italic>out of the midst of the fire</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn330">51</xref></sup> And you should convey all the things which your eyes saw at that glorious Revelation <italic>unto thy children and thy children&#x2019;s children</italic><sup><xref rid="fn331">52</xref></sup> forever.&#x201D; He explained the reason [for this prohibition]: G-d made that Revelation so that you might learn to fear Him all the days and teach your children<sup><xref rid="fn332">53</xref></sup> during all generations. Therefore, do so [remember the Revelation and convey it to your offspring] and do not forget it. Thus before mentioning the commandments which were proclaimed there [on Mount Sinai] he admonished with a negative commandment that we are not to forget a thing from the Revelation [of the Eternal at Mount Sinai], and we are never to remove it from our hearts. He further charged in the form of a positive commandment that we should inform all our children from generation to generation of everything that happened there &#x2014; what we saw and what we heard.<sup><xref rid="fn333">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>The benefit of this commandment is very great. For if the words of the Torah had come to us only through the mouth of Moses, even though his prophecy was verified with signs and wonders, yet <italic>if there</italic> [were to] <italic>arise in the midst of</italic> us <italic>a prophet or a dreamer of dreams</italic><sup><xref rid="fn334">55</xref></sup> and he were to command us [to do] the opposite of what the Torah commanded us, <italic>and he</italic> [were to] <italic>give</italic> us <italic>a sign or wonder</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn334">55</xref></sup> then a doubt would enter the people&#x2019;s hearts. But since the Torah reaches us from the mouth of the Almighty to our ears, and our eyes behold that there is no intermediary, we will reject anyone who differs and who casts doubt [upon the words of the Torah] and will declare him to be false. No sign will help him, nor will any wonder save him from death at our hands for we know his falsehood. It is this which He stated there [before the Revelation], <italic>and they may also believe in thee</italic> [Moses] <italic>forever</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn335">56</xref></sup> for when we shall also transmit the matter [of the Revelation] to our children they will know that the thing was true without doubt as if all the generations had seen it, for we would not testify falsely to our children to cause them to inherit <italic>vanity and things wherein there is no profit</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn336">57</xref></sup> and they will not doubt at all the testimony we will give them. Instead they will believe for a certainty that all of us saw it with our eyes, and likewise [they will believe] all that we told them. This subject will come up again in the section, <italic>If there arise in the midst of thee a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn334">55</xref></sup> I have already mentioned it there in the section of <italic>In the third month</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn337">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. AND THE ETERNAL SPOKE UNTO YOU OUT OF THE MIDST OF THE FIRE. I have already explained the matter in its place<sup><xref rid="fn338">59</xref></sup> that the people heard the speaking of the Great Name, blessed be He, <italic>out of the midst of the fire</italic>, as they saw <italic>His great fire</italic><sup><xref rid="fn339">60</xref></sup> and they perceived it. With this [Revelation] His covenant was declared to them in the <italic>ten words</italic> [i.e., the Ten Commandments],<sup><xref rid="fn340">61</xref></sup> for in all of them they heard the Voice <italic>out of the midst of the fire</italic>. And the rest of the commandments He <italic>commanded me at that time to teach you</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn341">62</xref></sup> because I was already <italic>established to be a prophet of the Eternal</italic><sup><xref rid="fn342">63</xref></sup> by what you saw, just as He said, <italic>and they may also believe in thee forever</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn335">56</xref></sup> as I have explained.</p>
<p>15. TAKE YE THEREFORE GOOD HEED UNTO YOURSELVES. He warns them lest they mistakenly follow the voice they heard and they commit the corruption of &#x201C;mutilating the shoots.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn343">64</xref></sup> He states first <italic>the likeness of male or female</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn344">65</xref></sup> [lest they corrupt themselves by making a graven image in the likeness of male or female] of the Being<sup><xref rid="fn345">66</xref></sup> from Whom the voice came. Afterwards he mentioned all that is on the earth of beast and of fowl,<sup><xref rid="fn346">67</xref></sup> of those that creep on the ground, and of the fish that are in the water,<sup><xref rid="fn347">68</xref></sup> and then he reverts to the host of heaven.<sup><xref rid="fn348">69</xref></sup> Now I have already explained<sup><xref rid="fn349">70</xref></sup> the expression, <italic>which the Eternal thy G-d hath allotted unto all peoples</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn348">69</xref></sup> for every nation has a star and constellation, and, <italic>above them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn350">71</xref></sup> the angels of the Supreme One, like those mentioned in the Book of Daniel, <italic>the prince of the kingdom of Persia</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn351">72</xref></sup> <italic>and the prince of</italic> the kingdom of <italic>Greece</italic><sup><xref rid="fn352">73</xref></sup> &#x2014; this being the reason why they [the nations] make of them gods for themselves and worship them. Scripture continues, <italic>And you the Eternal hath taken</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn353">74</xref></sup> for you are <italic>the portion of the Eternal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn354">75</xref></sup> You are thus not to appoint a prince or helper over yourselves except for Him, for it is He Who <italic>brought you forth out of the iron furnace</italic><sup><xref rid="fn353">74</xref></sup> when you were in Egypt in the midst of a furnace of fire and wood [i.e., a furnace of affliction] and He took you out from there in spite of their princes against whom He executed judgments.<sup><xref rid="fn355">76</xref></sup> Had He not brought about their downfall you would not have gone out, for they were [so much] in their ascendancy that you would not be able to leave. Thus He has done all this in order that you be &#x201C;an inheritance&#x201D; to Him<sup><xref rid="fn356">77</xref></sup> and be to His Great Name a treasure from among all peoples.<sup><xref rid="fn357">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. AND THE ETERNAL WAS ANGERED WITH ME FOR YOUR SAKES, AND SWORE THAT I SHOULD NOT GO OVER THE JORDAN. He repeated it in this place [despite having already mentioned it above, 1:37] as if to say: &#x201C;<italic>The Eternal commanded me at that time to teach you</italic><sup><xref rid="fn358">79</xref></sup> the commandments <italic>that ye might do them in the Land whither ye go over to possess it;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn358">79</xref></sup> now accept instruction from my mouth, <italic>for I must die in this land</italic>, (<italic>I must not go over the Jordan</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn359">80</xref></sup> and I will not be able to teach you in the Land [of Israel] and so do not forget there what I have taught you [here], nor what you have seen at Sinai.&#x201D;</p>
<p>By way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], Moses is stating: Take good heed of yourselves lest you corrupt yourselves, for the Eternal was angered with me in His concern over this matter<sup><xref rid="fn360">81</xref></sup> <italic>lest ye forget the covenant of the Eternal your G-d</italic><sup><xref rid="fn361">82</xref></sup> in <italic>the devouring fire on the top of the Mount</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn362">83</xref></sup> and you will make <italic>the likeness of any thing</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn361">82</xref></sup> this being the sense of the expression, <italic>which the Eternal thy G-d commanded thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn363">84</xref></sup> This has already been alluded to in the section <italic>Chukath Hatorah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn364">85</xref></sup> And Rashi wrote: &#x201C;<italic>Which the Eternal thy G-d commanded thee</italic> &#x2014; which He commanded thee <italic>not</italic> to do.&#x201D; This is the simple meaning of Scripture. But one learned in the mystic teachings of the Cabala will understand these verses in the light of their true meaning. And the sense of the verse <italic>For the Eternal thy G-d is a devouring fire</italic><sup><xref rid="fn365">86</xref></sup> is &#x201C;as you have seen <italic>on the top of the Mount</italic>, &#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn362">83</xref></sup> the intent being that it is the attribute of justice that is jealous of idols [and as the verse concludes, <italic>a jealous G-d</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn365">86</xref></sup> From this verse<sup><xref rid="fn365">86</xref></sup> you will understand the expression <italic>the Eternal thy G-d</italic> that is always mentioned in the Book of Deuteronomy.</p>
<p>25. &#x2018;KI&#x2019; (WHEN) THOU SHALT BEGET CHILDREN, AND CHILDREN&#x2019;S CHILDREN, AND YE SHALL HAVE BEEN LONG ESTABLISHED IN THE LAND. The purport of this verse is that it mentions and affirms that &#x201C;when ye shall beget children and children&#x2019;s children, and because you will have been long established in the Land and dwelled in security, you may perhaps forget G-d &#x2014; <italic>I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day</italic><sup><xref rid="fn366">87</xref></sup> that ye shall speedily perish, for He will not be long-suffering with you seeing that you worshipped idols.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now this section, although constituting a warning, opened [with the word <italic>ki</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;when&#x201D; and] not with the expression <italic>im</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;if&#x201D; [which would be here more appropriate, since it speaks of a hypothetical condition of future time]. The reason is that he [Moses] was virtually prophesying about their affairs, and therefore he spoke in an equivocal manner &#x2014; using an expression which in addition to being a warning [to avoid the sin of idolatry] also contains a prediction of things to come [when the warning will not be heeded]. He was thus saying that if they do so the following will happen to them, but he does not <italic>decree</italic> that they will do it. Therefore our Rabbis have said<sup><xref rid="fn367">88</xref></sup> that in the numerical-value of [the letters in the Hebrew word] <italic>v&#x2019;noshantem</italic> (<italic>and ye shall have been long established</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn368">89</xref></sup> he alluded to the time of the exile following the destruction of the First Sanctuary. It was thus a tradition [among the prophets and Sages of the generations] that this section of the Torah contains an allusion to the time of the exile, and, when it actually came to pass, they understood the allusion by contemplating this section [and interpreting the hidden message of the prophecy in light of the historical event].</p>
<p>He states <italic>and ye make a graven image, &#x2018;t&#x2019;munath kol&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>even the form of any thing</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn369">90</xref></sup> but does not say &#x201C;and you will worship it or bow down to it.&#x201D; Instead he says, <italic>and ye shall corrupt yourselves</italic>, for &#x201C;the graven image&#x201D; spoken of here is the form of <italic>Kol</italic> (All)<sup><xref rid="fn370">91</xref></sup> and on account of &#x201C;corruption&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn371">92</xref></sup> He prohibited it, as I have explained above.<sup><xref rid="fn372">93</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. AND YE SHALL BE LEFT FEW IN NUMBER. He is stating that we will be left as a minority among any of the nations whereto G-d will lead us, for He will scatter us <italic>as the four winds of the heaven</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn373">94</xref></sup> but in our totality we are many [i.e., Israel will remain a large nation, but because of our dispersion we are in a minority in each of the many countries] &#x2014; praise be to G-d [that in our totality we are many]&#x0021;</p>
<p>28. AND THERE YE SHALL SERVE GODS. &#x201C;When you serve their worshippers it is as though you serve them [the idols].&#x201D; This is the language of Rashi. Now I have already explained the secret thereof that he who dwells outside of the Land is as if he worshipped the idols,<sup><xref rid="fn374">95</xref></sup> and the expression, [<italic>and there ye shall serve gods</italic>] <italic>the work of men&#x2019;s hands</italic> indicates that the service begins with those on high and descends to the idols below,<sup><xref rid="fn375">96</xref></sup> as I have mentioned in the section <italic>Acharei Moth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn376">97</xref></sup></p>
<p>NOR DO THEY EAT, NOR SMELL. The purport thereof is to state that they [the idols] remain <italic>inanimate stones</italic><sup><xref rid="fn377">98</xref></sup> as they were to begin with, having no spirit of life at all, not even mortal life, as does man. For at first he said, <italic>which neither see, nor hear</italic>, meaning that they are not G-d and see not the suffering of their servants, nor hear their prayers, nor save them from their troubles.<sup><xref rid="fn378">99</xref></sup> And then he went back and said that they do not even have the inferior [mortal] life of man. Thus the one who makes them is more honored than they. Or perhaps the sense of the verse is in relation to the honor of the Supreme One, the verse thus stating: &#x201C;<italic>which neither see</italic> the suffering of their worshippers, <italic>nor hear</italic> their prayers, <italic>nor eat</italic>, since no fire ever comes out from before them and consumes their offerings,<sup><xref rid="fn379">100</xref></sup> <italic>nor smell</italic> their [offerings&#x2019;] sweet odors.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn380">101</xref></sup> Now Scripture adopted the general usage of language, but in fact the idols have none of these senses.</p>
<p>30. AND THOU WILT RETURN TO THE ETERNAL THY G-D, AND HEARKEN UNTO HIS VOICE. This, too,<sup><xref rid="fn381">102</xref></sup> is an allusion to the redemption from [the exile in] Babylon, that they will repent to G-d and confess [their sins] before Him and hearken to the voice of the prophets that He will appoint for them. Therefore, he promised them that He would not destroy them, nor forget the covenant of their fathers, as He said, <italic>And I will remember My covenant with Jacob etc</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn382">103</xref></sup> And at the end of this book he will allude to the future redemption<sup><xref rid="fn383">104</xref></sup> as I have explained,<sup><xref rid="fn384">105</xref></sup> and I will yet mention it with the help of G-d.<sup><xref rid="fn383">104</xref></sup></p>
<p>32. FOR ASK NOW OF THE DAYS PAST. He states &#x201C;G-d will not forgive you, nor will He be long-suffering with you for idolatry and corruption with graven images and all forms of likenesses, for He has done with you what He has never done with any nation. He has made you <italic>hear the voice of G-d speaking out of the midst of the fire</italic><sup><xref rid="fn385">106</xref></sup> so <italic>that His fear may be before you</italic><sup><xref rid="fn386">107</xref></sup> and that you declare His Unity and not corrupt yourselves. He has taken you <italic>to Him a nation from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs and by wonders</italic><sup><xref rid="fn387">108</xref></sup> so that you should not worship anything beside Him. Thus you have been shown all this with your eyes <italic>that thou mightest know that the Eternal, He is G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn388">109</xref></sup> that He is One, <italic>and His Name One</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn389">110</xref></sup> and <italic>there is none else beside Him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn388">109</xref></sup> For <italic>out of heaven He made thee to hear His voice</italic><sup><xref rid="fn390">111</xref></sup> to teach you <italic>the discipline of wisdom;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn391">112</xref></sup> <italic>and upon the earth He made thee to see His great fire</italic><sup><xref rid="fn390">111</xref></sup> burning <italic>unto the heart of heaven</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn392">113</xref></sup> <italic>and</italic> all <italic>His words thou didst hear out of the midst of the fire</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn390">111</xref></sup> <italic>And He brought thee out &#x2018;b&#x2019;phanav&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>with His presence</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn393">114</xref></sup> similar to <italic>&#x2018;al panav&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>before His presence</italic>), with His great power which is in His presence. And since the Great Name <italic>is G-d in heaven above and upon the earth beneath, and there is none else</italic><sup><xref rid="fn394">115</xref></sup> you shall keep His commandments and His statutes so that <italic>it may be well with thee</italic><sup><xref rid="fn395">116</xref></sup> in heaven above, <italic>and that thou mayest prolong thy days</italic><sup><xref rid="fn395">116</xref></sup> upon the earth beneath.&#x201D;</p>
<p>41. THEN MOSES SEPARATED THREE CITIES. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra explained it to mean: &#x201C;on the day that Moses separated three cities [to function as cities of refuge], he then said the words of the covenant [as stated in the following section].&#x201D; But it is not correct. Rather, it is to be understood in its simple sense. Moses had gathered all Israel to explain to them the Torah and he began with words of reproof; after he uttered in their presence his words of reproof concerning what they had done, the admonishments about idolatry and the Unity of G-d, and completed [his statement] to them with the charge that they observe His statutes and His commandments so that it may be well with them &#x2014; then he said in their presence before them: &#x201C;Now we shall fulfill the commandment that G-d has commanded us, and Bezer in the wilderness, Ramoth in Gilead, and Golan in Bashan will be cities of refuge that every manslayer that kills any person through error may flee thither.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn396">117</xref></sup> And although they would not legally provide refuge until [the cities of refuge] in the land of Canaan [on the western side of the Jordan] were set apart, Moses said, &#x201C; &#x2018;If a commandment has come to our hands we shall fulfill it,&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn397">118</xref></sup> so that it may be well with us.&#x201D; Afterwards he called with a great voice to all Israel that were there and said to them, <italic>Hear, O Israel, the statutes and the ordinances</italic> etc.,<sup><xref rid="fn398">119</xref></sup> for now he commenced to speak of the commandments and the explanation of the Torah, as I have explained at the beginning of the section <italic>These are the words</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn399">120</xref></sup> He mentioned here <italic>and they took his</italic> [Sihon&#x2019;s] <italic>land in possession, and the land of Og king of Bashan</italic> etc. <italic>from Aroer</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn400">121</xref></sup> the sense of it being that he reverted to what he had stated at the beginning of this book, that the explanation of this Torah was [given] after he had smitten Sihon etc.,<sup><xref rid="fn401">122</xref></sup> and he further explained here that this expounding of the Torah was also after they took all their lands [of Sihon and Og] in possession, that is, after he divided them among the two and a half tribes [Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Menasheh].</p>
<h1>5</h1>
<p>5. I STOOD BETWEEN THE ETERNAL AND YOU AT THAT TIME, TO DECLARE UNTO YOU THE WORD OF THE ETERNAL. For Moses would go up to the mountain and hear the words of G-d and come down and tell them to the people, until G-d spoke with them <italic>face to face</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn402">123</xref></sup> This is an allusion to all that is mentioned in the section <italic>In the third month</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn403">124</xref></sup> beginning with <italic>Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob</italic><sup><xref rid="fn404">125</xref></sup> [and concluding with] <italic>And the Eternal said unto him, Go, get thee down</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn405">126</xref></sup> And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra said that this [occurrence referred to in the verse, <italic>I stood between the Eternal and you</italic> etc.,] happened <italic>after</italic> the Revelation at Mount Sinai, the purport of the verse being as follows: &#x201C;He spoke with you <italic>face to face</italic><sup><xref rid="fn402">123</xref></sup> [at the giving of the Ten Commandments], and from that day on I stood between G-d and you.&#x201D; But it is not correct.</p>
<p>It appears to me that the correct interpretation is that Moses is alluding to what we have explained there<sup><xref rid="fn406">127</xref></sup> that Israel understood from the mouth of the Almighty only the commandments <italic>I am the Eternal thy G-d</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn407">128</xref></sup> and <italic>Thou shalt have no other gods before Me</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn408">129</xref></sup> As for the rest of the commandments, it was Moses who declared to them what G-d said. This is the meaning [of the expression here], <italic>to declare unto you the word of the Eternal</italic>, for he explained to them each and every commandment. And the meaning of the expression (<italic>I stood</italic>) <italic>between the Eternal and you</italic> is that, at the time of the giving of the commandments, Moses was nearer than they to the place of the Divine Glory, for they had removed themselves far [from the mountain] as I have explained there.<sup><xref rid="fn409">130</xref></sup> This is [the sense of the words] <italic>for ye were afraid because of the fire, and went not up into the Mount</italic> meaning that you did not approach it [even the part] that was permissible to you [to approach]. Therefore I stood between you and the place of the Glory &#x2014; in the middle &#x2014; because it was distant between you and Him, and from there I declared [the rest of] the commandments [to you].</p>
<p>SAYING. &#x201C;This [word] refers to [the expression in the preceding verse], <italic>the Eternal spoke with you in the Mount out of the midst of the fire</italic><sup><xref rid="fn402">123</xref></sup> &#x2014; <italic>saying: I am the Eternal thy G-d</italic> etc.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. And Rabbi Abraham [ibn Ezra] said: &#x201C;Pay no attention to the fact that the word <italic>saying</italic> is far [from the phrase it modifies in the preceding verse], for there are many such cases in Scripture, and the one who spoke [Moses] neither separated his words into verses nor sections.&#x201D; It would be more correct to connect the word <italic>saying</italic> with [the preceding phrase in the <italic>same</italic> verse],<sup><xref rid="fn410">131</xref></sup> <italic>to declare unto you the word of the Eternal&#x2014;saying: I am the Eternal thy G-d</italic>, similar to the expression, <italic>And thou shalt tell thy son in that day, saying</italic><sup><xref rid="fn411">132</xref></sup> [in which case the word <italic>saying</italic> connects itself properly with the preceding and following phrases: <italic>saying &#x2014; It is because of that which the Eternal did for me when I came forth out of Egypt</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn411">132</xref></sup> But in my opinion there is no need at all [for either interpretation], for its meaning is as follows: &#x201C;<italic>for ye were afraid because of the fire, and went not up into the Mount, saying</italic>, &#x2018;We will not go up, for we are afraid because of the fire.&#x2019; &#x201D; He is thus mentioning that they told him so clearly, and not that he is saying so from his own assumption.</p>
<p>And now he begins the review of the Torah. He told them the Ten Commandments, not changing and not explaining anything in [the first two commandments]: <italic>I am the Eternal</italic> etc.,<sup><xref rid="fn412">133</xref></sup> and <italic>Thou shalt have no other gods before Me</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn413">134</xref></sup> for they heard them from the mouth of the Almighty.<sup><xref rid="fn414">135</xref></sup> So, too, [there are no changes or explanations] in the third commandment<sup><xref rid="fn415">136</xref></sup> because he already stated [here, as in the text of the third commandment in Exodus 20:7, <italic>Thou shalt not take</italic>] <italic>the Name of the Eternal thy G-d</italic> [etc.], as I have explained in the section <italic>Ye shall be holy</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn416">137</xref></sup> Then he began to exposit to them, saying <italic>&#x2018;Observe&#x2019;</italic> [<italic>the Sabbath-day</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn417">138</xref></sup> instead of <italic>&#x2018;Remember&#x2019;</italic> [<italic>the Sabbath-day</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn418">139</xref></sup> this being in line with the plain meaning of Scripture [i.e., that &#x2018;Observe&#x2019; is the explanation of &#x2018;Remember&#x2019;]. And in the opinion of our Rabbis<sup><xref rid="fn419">140</xref></sup> &#x201C;[<italic>Remember</italic> and <italic>Observe</italic>] both were spoken in one utterance.&#x201D; He explained this to them [here] because they all know <italic>Remember</italic>, and he is thus informing them [now] that <italic>Observe</italic> was said with it. And so it is by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], that they were both spoken in one utterance seeing that the Voice was both in &#x201C;remembering&#x201D; and &#x201C;observing,&#x201D; for the Torah is <italic>an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn420">141</xref></sup> and he [i.e., Moses] heard from [the attribute of] <italic>Remember</italic> while they [i.e., the people, heard] from that of <italic>Observe</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn421">142</xref></sup> The student [learned in the mystic teachings of the Cabala] will know this from what we have hinted there.<sup><xref rid="fn422">143</xref></sup></p>
<p>He explained [with reference to the commandment that we are to <italic>Observe the Sabbath-day, to keep it holy</italic>] <italic>as the Eternal thy G-d commanded thee</italic><sup><xref rid="fn417">138</xref></sup> &#x2014; &#x201C;before the Giving of the Torah, at Marah,<sup><xref rid="fn423">144</xref></sup> [for there it is said], <italic>there He made for them a statute and an ordinance</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn424">145</xref></sup> This is the language of Rashi. But if so, the commandment to honor father and mother was also given at Marah [for in the commandment, to honor parents, too, it is stated <italic>as the Eternal thy G-d commanded thee</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn425">146</xref></sup> but the Rabbi [Rashi] mentioned there [in connection with the verse referring to Marah] only &#x201C;the Sabbath, the Red Heifer, and the laws of justice&#x201D; [as having been given at Marah, but not the honoring of parents].<sup><xref rid="fn426">147</xref></sup></p>
<p>It appears to me by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], concerning this matter [of the Ten Commandments] as well as the whole Book of Deuteronomy that Moses was speaking as if from the mouth of the Almighty, as he said, <italic>And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto My commandments which I command you this day, to love the Eternal your G-d, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul, that I will give rain for your Land in its season</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn427">148</xref></sup> Now Moses is not the one <italic>who giveth rain upon the earth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn428">149</xref></sup> nor the one who gives grass in the fields&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn429">150</xref></sup> Rather, the communication of the Torah was given with <italic>Remember</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn430">151</xref></sup> and that of Deuteronomy with <italic>Observe</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn430">151</xref></sup> Therefore, Moses everywhere in Deuteronomy mentions <italic>the Eternal thy G-d</italic> while in [the first four books of] the Torah he mentions only the Proper Name of G-d [i.e., the Tetragrammaton] except in the Ten Commandments as it is said, <italic>And G-d spoke</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn431">152</xref></sup> Understand this.</p>
<p>He added here [in the commandment on the Sabbath] stating <italic>nor thine ox, nor thine ass</italic><sup><xref rid="fn432">153</xref></sup> to explain that He prohibits working the earth [on the Sabbath] even though it involves the livelihood of man, similar to what He said, <italic>in plowing time and in harvest shalt thou rest</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn433">154</xref></sup> He stated here <italic>that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou; and thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt</italic> etc.,<sup><xref rid="fn434">155</xref></sup> in order to explain that He commanded concerning the resting of the servant as well as yourself, because, since you were a servant and G-d gave you rest, so you too are to give rest to your servant.<sup><xref rid="fn435">156</xref></sup> Thus the sense of the verses is as follows: &#x201C;When your manservant and your maidservant will rest as well as you then you will remember that you were a servant etc.&#x201D;</p>
<p>15. THEREFORE THE ETERNAL THY G-D COMMANDED THEE TO KEEP THE SABBATH-DAY. The meaning thereof is that He commanded you to do so [give rest to the servant] on the Sabbath-day. So did Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra explain it.<sup><xref rid="fn436">157</xref></sup> But it is not correct, for we say in the <italic>Kiddush</italic> [i.e., the proclamation of the sanctity] of the Sabbath,<sup><xref rid="fn437">158</xref></sup> &#x201C;For this day is the first of the hallowed gatherings recalling our going forth from Egypt&#x201D; just as we say that it &#x201C;recalls the work of Creation&#x0021;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn438">159</xref></sup> And the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] stated in the Moreh Nebuchim<sup><xref rid="fn439">160</xref></sup> that &#x201C;the &#x2018;first statement&#x2019; [i.e., citing the Creation, as given in the Book of Exodus] expresses the honor and distinction of the day, just as He said, <italic>therefore the Eternal hath blessed the Sabbath-day, and hallowed it</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn440">161</xref></sup> and hence He mentioned the reason <italic>for in six days</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn440">161</xref></sup> But here he warned us to observe the Sabbath because of our having been slaves, working all day against our will and never having rest, and he commanded us now to abstain from work and rest in order that we remember the kindnesses of G-d towards us in bringing us forth from slavery to rest. Thus the Sabbath in general has two reasons: that we believe in the creation of the world [i.e., that the world was created at some point in time out of absolute nought rather than being of infinite age], that the world has a G-d Who is the Creator, and that we remember further the great kindness that He did with us, that we are His servants, since He acquired us for Himself as servants.&#x201D; This [statement of Rambam] is also not clear to me, for when we are resting and not doing work on the seventh day we are not provided with a remembrance of the exodus from Egypt, nor does anyone who sees us being idle from work have any knowledge of this [reason]. Rather, the Sabbath is like all the other commandments, but it contains a reminder of the Creation because of the fact that we rest on the day that G-d <italic>ceased from work</italic> thereon <italic>and rested</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn441">162</xref></sup> And it is more fitting to say that because the exodus from Egypt is evidence of the existence of an Eternal G-d, Who caused everything to come into existence through His will<sup><xref rid="fn442">163</xref></sup> and Who has supreme power, as I have explained in the first commandment<sup><xref rid="fn443">164</xref></sup> &#x2014; therefore he stated here: &#x201C;If there ever arises a doubt in your heart concerning the Sabbath that evidences the creation of the world by the will and power of G-d, you should remember what your eyes saw at the exodus from Egypt which is, to you, the evidence [of His infinite power] and the remembrance [of His deeds].&#x201D; Thus the Sabbath is a remembrance of the exodus from Egypt, and the exodus is a remembrance of the Sabbath, for on it [the Sabbath] they remember and say that it is G-d Who makes new signs and wonders in everything and does with everything according to His will since it is He Who created everything at the beginning of creation. This, then, is the sense of the expression, <italic>therefore the Eternal thy G-d commanded thee to keep the Sabbath-day</italic>. Now, he did not explain here that the reason for the rest [on the Sabbath] is that <italic>in six days the Eternal made heaven</italic> etc.,<sup><xref rid="fn440">161</xref></sup> &#x2014; since this has already been mentioned many times in the Torah. Instead, he said here briefly, <italic>and the seventh day is a Sabbath unto the Eternal thy G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn432">153</xref></sup> meaning that He, blessed be, <italic>ceased from work</italic> thereon <italic>and rested</italic><sup><xref rid="fn441">162</xref></sup> and he explained to them that from the exodus from Egypt they will know that it was He Who spoke and the world came into existence, and He ceased from work thereon.</p>
<p>And by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], we can further add to this [subject, by saying] that this commandment was given with [the expression] <italic>Observe</italic> [<italic>Observe the Sabbath-day to keep it holy</italic>], in order that we <italic>may fear the Glorious and Fearful Name</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn444">165</xref></sup> and therefore he commands us to remember <italic>the mighty hand and the outstretched arm</italic><sup><xref rid="fn445">166</xref></sup> that we saw at the exodus from Egypt, and from it the fear [of G-d] is to come to us, as it is said, <italic>And Israel saw the great work which the Eternal did upon the Egyptians, and the people &#x2018;feared&#x2019; the Eternal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn446">167</xref></sup> And <italic>therefore the Eternal thy G-d commanded thee to keep the Sabbath-day</italic> so that the congregation of Israel be the partner to the Sabbath, as is hinted in the words of our Rabbis.<sup><xref rid="fn447">168</xref></sup> The student [learned in the mysteries of the Cabala] will understand.</p>
<p>He added an explanation in the commandment, <italic>Honor thy father and thy mother &#x2018;as the Eternal thy G-d command thee&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn448">169</xref></sup> from the mouth of the Almighty, as I have explained,<sup><xref rid="fn449">170</xref></sup> and therefore he added, <italic>and that it may go well with thee</italic>, just as it is said, <italic>Yea, the Eternal will give that which is good, and our land shall yield her produce</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn450">171</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. NEITHER SHALT THOU BEAR &#x2018;EID SHAV&#x2019; (VAIN WITNESS)<sup><xref rid="fn451">172</xref></sup> AGAINST THY NEIGHBOR. He explained this in order to prohibit even [false] meaningless testimony that will cause no harm at all to his neighbor in court, as, for example, if he testifies, &#x201C;So-and-so said he will give a hundred [dinars] to that person, but did not obligate himself to do it&#x201D; [such false testimony is consequently in &#x201C;vain&#x201D; and we are prohibited from so doing]. For the term <italic>shav</italic> [in the above admonition, as elsewhere] signifies &#x201C;vain, worthless&#x201D; talk.</p>
<p>He added an explanation in the commandment <italic>Neither shalt thou covet</italic> in that he mentioned first the [neighbor&#x2019;s] wife [whereas in the Book of Exodus <italic>the neighbor&#x2019;s house</italic> is stated first] <italic>for the imagination of man&#x2019;s heart is evil from his youth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn452">173</xref></sup> with respect to women more than anything else. He further explained, that included in the term &#x201C;coveting&#x201D; is even mere &#x201C;desire&#x201D; [as stated here, <italic>Neither shalt thou &#x2018;desire&#x2019; thy neighbor&#x2019;s house</italic> etc.]. Thus if he desires to rob anything from his neighbor, but is unable to do so because his neighbor is stronger than he, or because in his locality there is fear of the government, he transgresses this commandment.<sup><xref rid="fn453">174</xref></sup> He added here <italic>his field</italic>, wherefrom the Rabbis have interpreted in the Mechilta:<sup><xref rid="fn454">175</xref></sup> &#x201C;Perhaps I may reason: Just as the specific examples [mentioned in the Decalogue in Exodus, namely, his manservant, his maidservant, his ox, or his ass] are movable property which may not be seized from customers in case of non-payment by the creditor, so also, I can include [in the prohibition not to covet] only movable property which may not be resorted to for non-payment. But when it says in Deuteronomy <italic>his field</italic> [which is immovable property and may be resorted to for non-payment] you must perforce interpret the verse as follows: Just as the specific matters deal with things one can buy and sell, so all things one can buy and sell [are included in this prohibition].&#x201D;</p>
<p>19. OUT OF THE MIDST OF THE FIRE, OF THE CLOUD, AND OF THE THICK DARKNESS. &#x201C;The cloud and the darkness&#x201D; explain the expression <italic>out of the midst of the fire</italic>, for <italic>Clouds and darkness are round about Him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn455">176</xref></sup></p>
<p>A GREAT VOICE, &#x2018;V&#x2019;LO YASAF.&#x2019; &#x201C;We render this [in the Targum Onkelos] as &#x2018;and He did not pause.&#x2019; Because it is the nature of human beings that they cannot say all their words in one breath, but the nature of the Holy One, blessed be He, is different; He did not pause. And since He did not pause [in uttering the Ten Commandments] He did not have to resume, for His voice is strong and eternally enduring. [Thus, the words <italic>v&#x2019;lo yasaf</italic> which literally mean &#x2018;did not resume&#x2019; or &#x2018;did not continue&#x2019; are translated by Onkelos as &#x2018;did not pause,&#x2019; because, had He paused, He would have had to continue after the pause. Since G-d can say all the words in one breath, there was no need for a pause followed by a resumption.] Another interpretation of <italic>lo yasaf</italic>: He &#x2018;never again&#x2019; revealed Himself in such a public manifestation.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. But the verse states, <italic>And the voice of the horn waxed louder and louder</italic>&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn456">177</xref></sup> And the Rabbis also said:<sup><xref rid="fn457">178</xref></sup> &#x201C;And why was it [i.e., the voice of the horn] soft at first [growing gradually stronger]? In order to accustom the ear with [a sound] it was able to hear.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn458">179</xref></sup> Perhaps this was so with respect to the voice of the horn, but the voice of G-d throughout the Ten Commandments was even. The correct interpretation is that of the Sage who says that [the meaning of <italic>v&#x2019;lo yasaf</italic> is] &#x201C;He did not pause,&#x201D; thus deriving the translation of <italic>yasaf</italic> from the expressions: <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;ne&#x2019;esfah&#x2019; gladness and joy</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn459">180</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;toseif&#x2019; their breath, they perish</italic><sup><xref rid="fn460">181</xref></sup> which signify, in his opinion, the act of taking something away. The verse here thus states that His greatness and power were &#x201C;not withdrawn&#x201D; until He finished all the commandments. Similarly it says, <italic>and they prophesied &#x2018;v&#x2019;lo yasafu&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn461">182</xref></sup> [which Onkelos renders, &#x201C;and they did not cease&#x201D;]. And in line with the plain meaning of Scripture <italic>v&#x2019;lo yasaf</italic> means that &#x201C;there will never again be so great [a voice].&#x201D; And by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala,] the verse is stating that they heard all <italic>these words</italic> [proclaimed by] the voice of the Great One,<sup><xref rid="fn462">183</xref></sup> and He did not add anything [perceivable] <italic>to all your assembly</italic>, except for this one voice, for it was only that voice that they grasped. There I have already explained this subject as well as the whole section.<sup><xref rid="fn463">184</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. FOR WHO IS THERE OF ALL FLESH, THAT HATH HEARD THE VOICE OF &#x2018;ELOKIM CHAYIM&#x2019; (THE LIVING G-D) SPEAKING OUT OF THE FIRE, AS WE HAVE, AND LIVED? Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra explained that the term <italic>living</italic> [<italic>living G-d</italic>] is to distinguish between G-d and the host of heaven which cannot move by itself [but by <italic>the living G-d</italic> Who is the First Cause].&#x201D; It is possible to explain that he mentioned this in order to indicate that, if someone hears the voice of G-d <italic>with</italic> Whom <italic>is the fountain of life</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn464">185</xref></sup> his soul will cleave to its &#x201C;foundation&#x201D; and he will no longer live <italic>the life of the flesh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn465">186</xref></sup> Similarly Joshua said, <italic>Hereby ye shall know that &#x2018;E-il chai&#x2019; is in your midst;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn466">187</xref></sup> <italic>Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn467">188</xref></sup> If so, [that <italic>E-il chai</italic>, as Joshua explained it, means <italic>&#x2018;the Lord of all the earth,&#x2019;</italic> thus intimating that <italic>E-il chai</italic> means &#x201C;G-d of all the living,&#x201D; and is unlike the expression here, <italic>Elokim chayim</italic>, which means &#x201C;the living G-d&#x201D;] <italic>and he swore &#x2018;b&#x2019;chei&#x2019; of the world</italic><sup><xref rid="fn468">189</xref></sup> is an oath by His Great Name [meaning that &#x201C;he swore by Him Who gives life to the world&#x201D;].</p>
<p>24. &#x2018;V&#x2019;AT&#x2019; (AND THOU) [Moses] SPEAK UNTO US. &#x201C;[The feminine form of the word <italic>v&#x2019;at</italic> indicates] that you caused my strength to be sapped like that of a woman, for I was distressed because of you and you weakened my hands when I realized that you were not anxious to approach Him out of love. For was it not better to learn directly from the Almighty rather than from me?&#x0021;&#x201D; Thus far is Rashi&#x2019;s language from words of the Agadah.<sup><xref rid="fn469">190</xref></sup> If so, Moses is saying that he was concerned [over their failure to approach G-d] and G-d informed him [in the following verses] that they did so because they feared Him and it was beneficial to them&#x0021; But the subject is, as I have explained there,<sup><xref rid="fn470">191</xref></sup> that they thought that G-d wanted to communicate the entire Torah to them; however, the [Divine] Will before Him was to proclaim to them only the Ten Commandments as they desired.</p>
<p>Know that now they requested of Moses that they should not hear the voice of <italic>the Glorious Name</italic><sup><xref rid="fn471">192</xref></sup> &#x2014; neither on that day nor during any of the succeeding generations &#x2014; for it is not at all times that miracles occur [and, as they said in Verse 21, their very survival after hearing the voice of G-d was a miracle in itself, a miracle that could not be expected to recur during future revelations], and that they do not want another such Revelation; rather, they will believe in the prophets and do G-d&#x2019;s will [as revealed] through them. In compliance Moses told them, <italic>A prophet will the Eternal thy G-d raise up unto thee, from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken; according to all that thou didst desire of the Eternal thy G-d in Horeb</italic>. etc.<sup><xref rid="fn472">193</xref></sup> If so, the meaning of this request [of the people in the verse before us &#x2014; <italic>and thou shalt speak unto us</italic> &#x2014; that they wished to hear from prophets rather than from G-d] was meant for future generations.</p>
<p>26. OH THAT THIS THEIR HEART WOULD REMAIN IN THEM, TO FEAR ME. Scripture uses this expression because man has freedom of choice to be righteous or to be wicked, and &#x201C;Everything is in the power of Heaven except for fear of Heaven.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn473">194</xref></sup> It is thus an expression of common usage.</p>
<p>And by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], the expression [before us] is similar to the verse, <italic>And unto man He said: &#x2018;Behold, the fear of the Eternal, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding</italic>.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn474">195</xref></sup> And so the Rabbis have said with regard to the reward for [performance of] the commandments:<sup><xref rid="fn475">196</xref></sup> &#x201C;Moses saw that they [i.e., the Romans] were cutting the flesh of [the martyr] Rabbi Akiba in meat markets. Moses said to G-d, &#x2018;Master of the universe&#x0021; Is this the reward for such [knowledge of the] Torah&#x0021;&#x2019; The Holy One, blessed be He, replied, &#x2018;Be silent, thus have I decreed.&#x2019; &#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn476">197</xref></sup> You will understand this from what He has said to Moses, <italic>And as for thee, stand thou here by Me</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn477">198</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. THAT THEY MAY DO THEM IN THE LAND. I have explained it.<sup><xref rid="fn478">199</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. YE SHALL OBSERVE TO DO, THEREFORE, AS THE ETERNAL YOUR G-D COMMANDED YOU. This warning alludes to the Ten Commandments which G-d Himself communicated to them directly, and afterwards he admonished them with respect to the rest of the commandments which they said they [preferred to] hear from Moses and [they promised] to perform them. Therefore, he said, <italic>And this is the commandment, the statutes, and the ordinances which the Eternal your G-d commanded to teach you</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn479">200</xref></sup> since G-d agreed to your request and He commanded me to teach you the entire balance of the Torah, <italic>that ye may live</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn480">201</xref></sup> that He may fulfill the number of your days,<sup><xref rid="fn481">202</xref></sup> <italic>and that it may be well with you</italic><sup><xref rid="fn480">201</xref></sup> with all the good that He promised you in the section of <italic>If ye walk in My statutes</italic><sup><xref rid="fn482">203</xref></sup> and other sections besides; <italic>and that ye may prolong your days in the Land</italic><sup><xref rid="fn480">201</xref></sup> that you will inherit for your children forever.</p>
<h1>6</h1>
<p>2. THAT THOU MIGHTEST FEAR THE ETERNAL THY G-D. He is stating that G-d commanded [me] to teach you the Torah and the commandment, the statutes and the ordinances that you might perform them in the Land, and so that you might fear the Eternal your G-d, for the main purpose of all the commandments is the fear of G-d. This is Rabbi Abraham [ibn Ezra&#x2019;s] opinion. But it does not seem correct to me that [the two expressions in the verse before us:] <italic>that thou mightest fear the Eternal thy G-d</italic>, and <italic>that thy days may be prolonged</italic> [are referring to two different aspects of the commandments] one being the reason for the commandments &#x2014; so that you might fear G-d; and the second stating their reward &#x2014; so that your days may be prolonged&#x0021; Rather, he is stating, &#x201C;G-d commanded me that you should learn the commandments and perform them in order that you should merit and fear the Eternal your G-d in order to keep His commandments <italic>thou, and thy son, and thy son&#x2019;s son</italic> for all the days that man shall exist upon the face of the earth, forever. For in return for the performance of the commandments you will deserve to have children who fear G-d and they will survive upon the face of the earth forever. <italic>So shall your seed and your name remain</italic><sup><xref rid="fn483">204</xref></sup> before Him all the days <italic>that thy days may be prolonged</italic> in the Land which is the inheritance of G-d. Thus all is for your good, for G-d was pleased to make you righteous and deserving [of His blessings].&#x201D;</p>
<p>3. AND THOU SHALT OBSERVE TO DO IT &#x2018;ASHER YITAV LECHA&#x2019; (WHICH WILL BE WELL WITH THEE). He is thus commanding you that you should take care to do what will benefit you. &#x201C;A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY. Although removed from it, this phrase is connected with the expression <italic>to possess it</italic> [at the end of Verse 1]. Or it may be that the expression [<italic>a Land flowing</italic> &#x2026;] lacks the letter <italic>beth</italic>, [making it equivalent to <italic>ba&#x2019;aretz</italic> &#x2014; &#x2018;<italic>in</italic> the Land&#x2019; flowing with milk and honey, and thus it is not necessary to say that the phrase <italic>a Land flowing</italic> &#x2026; refers to Verse 1; instead, the verse before us enjoins Israel to observe the commandments <italic>in</italic> the Land] just as in the verse, <italic>that was found &#x2018;beith&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>House of</italic>) <italic>the Eternal</italic><sup><xref rid="fn484">205</xref></sup> [which lacks a <italic>beth</italic>, making it <italic>b&#x2019;veith</italic> &#x2014; &#x2018;in the House of&#x2019; the Eternal].&#x201D; This is the language of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra. And if so, there is also lacking in the phrase <italic>and that ye might increase mightily</italic> the word <italic>bo</italic> (&#x201C;in it&#x201D;) [so that its meaning would be &#x201C;<italic>and that ye might increase mightily</italic> &#x2018;in it,&#x2019; &#x201D; that is, in the Land flowing with milk and honey]; or [the missing part may be the word] <italic>ba&#x2019;avuro</italic> (&#x201C;because of it&#x201D;). But there is no need [to interpret the verse as if letters and words were missing]. For [the word <italic>l&#x2019;ma&#x2019;an</italic> (so that) from the phrase in the preceding Verse 2] <italic>and &#x2018;so that&#x2019; thy days be prolonged</italic>, should be drawn here [to Verse 3], and its meaning is as follows: &#x201C; &#x2018;so that&#x2019; <italic>it may be well with thee</italic>.&#x201D; Or it may be that the word <italic>asher</italic> (which) [<italic>&#x2018;asher&#x2019; yitav lecha</italic>] itself serves the same purpose [meaning &#x201C;so that&#x201D; or &#x201C;because of&#x201D;], as in the verse, <italic>And he removed her from being queen &#x2018;asher&#x2019; she had made an abominable image</italic><sup><xref rid="fn485">206</xref></sup> which means &#x201C; &#x2018;because of&#x2019; her having made an abominable image.&#x201D; Similarly, <italic>&#x2018;ba&#x2019;asher&#x2019; thou art his wife</italic><sup><xref rid="fn486">207</xref></sup> means &#x201C; &#x2018;because of&#x2019; your being his wife.&#x201D; And so also Scripture states, <italic>which I command thee this day &#x2018;asher&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>so that</italic>) <italic>it may go well with thee</italic> etc., <italic>and so that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the Land</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn487">208</xref></sup> And the purport of the verse [here] is as follows: &#x201C;<italic>Hear, therefore, O Israel, and take care to do it</italic> so that <italic>it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the Eternal the G-d of thy fathers hath promised</italic> to give <italic>unto thee a Land flowing with milk and honey</italic> etc.;&#x201D; that is to say, in order that He may do good to you when He gives you <italic>a good and large Land</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn488">209</xref></sup> as he said further [in Verse 18], <italic>so that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good Land</italic>. Similarly, <italic>and he gave him a house, and said to him victuals</italic><sup><xref rid="fn489">210</xref></sup> [means: &#x201C;and he said to &#x2018;give&#x2019; him victuals&#x201D;].</p>
<p>4. HEAR, O ISRAEL: THE ETERNAL OUR G-D, THE ETERNAL IS ONE. This too is a commandment that offers explanation. For, already contained in the commandment <italic>I am the Eternal thy G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn490">211</xref></sup> is [the principle of] the Unity of G-d. As the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn491">212</xref></sup> &#x201C;Rabbi Nathan says: From here there is a refutation to those heretics who say there are two powers governing the universe. For, when the Holy One, blessed be He, stood on Mount Sinai and proclaimed <italic>I am the Eternal thy G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn490">211</xref></sup> who protested against Him?&#x201D; But here he [Moses] came to explain this commandment [<italic>I am the Eternal</italic> &#x2026;] and mentioned it after the Ten Commandments because it is the root of faith, and whoever does not acknowledge it denies the essential principle [of the religion] as if he worships idols. &#x201C;<italic>The Eternal our G-d, the Eternal is One</italic>. This means: the Eternal, Who is [now, only] our G-d and not the G-d of the [other] nations, will eventually be acknowledged as the One [and only] Eternal, as it is said, <italic>In that day shall the Eternal be One, and His Name One</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn492">213</xref></sup> This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. Now you must contemplate [the fact] that Scripture changed [the normal usage] here by saying <italic>the Eternal &#x2018;our&#x2019; G-d</italic> and did not state &#x201C;thy&#x201D; G-d as it says everywhere else: <italic>Hear, O Israel: thou art to pass over the Jordan this day</italic> etc. <italic>Know therefore this day, that the Eternal &#x2018;thy&#x2019; G-d</italic> etc.;<sup><xref rid="fn493">214</xref></sup> <italic>Hear, O Israel, ye draw nigh this day unto battle</italic> etc. <italic>for the Eternal &#x2018;your&#x2019; G-d is He that goeth with you</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn494">215</xref></sup> And so also in all sections where [Moses] spoke to Israel he mentioned &#x201C;the Eternal <italic>your</italic> G-d&#x201D; or &#x201C;the Eternal <italic>thy</italic> G-d,&#x201D; and even here [in this very section] he said, <italic>And thou shalt love the Eternal &#x2018;thy&#x2019; G-d</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn495">216</xref></sup> However, in this declaration of the Unity [of G-d] Moses said, <italic>the Eternal &#x2018;our&#x2019; G-d</italic> because He had done <italic>great and awesome things</italic><sup><xref rid="fn496">217</xref></sup> with Moses <italic>to make</italic> Himself <italic>a glorious Name</italic><sup><xref rid="fn497">218</xref></sup> [therefore Moses said &#x201C;<italic>our</italic> G-d,&#x201D; for had he said &#x201C;<italic>your</italic> G-d,&#x201D; he might have appeared to exclude himself from this declaration of Unity].<sup><xref rid="fn498">219</xref></sup> Now the letter <italic>daleth</italic> in the word <italic>echad</italic> (one) is written [in the Torah] large in order to allude to that which is written, <italic>He divided the water before them, to make Himself an everlasting Name</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn499">220</xref></sup> And therefore the Rabbis instituted<sup><xref rid="fn500">221</xref></sup> in the reading of the <italic>Sh&#x2019;ma</italic><sup><xref rid="fn501">222</xref></sup> &#x201C;Blessed be His Name Whose Glorious Kingdom is for ever and ever&#x201D; and they further said [there]:<sup><xref rid="fn500">221</xref></sup> &#x201C;This may be compared to a lord&#x2019;s daughter who smelled the [sweet] odor of some pudding etc.,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn502">223</xref></sup> for Moses stated it in the Torah by an allusion.<sup><xref rid="fn503">224</xref></sup> And then he reverted [to the general usage] and stated, <italic>And &#x2018;thou&#x2019; shalt love the Eternal &#x2018;thy&#x2019; G-d</italic><sup><xref rid="fn495">216</xref></sup> like the expression found in [the other] sections of Deuteronomy.</p>
<p>5. WITH ALL THY HEART. In the opinion of the Midrash<sup><xref rid="fn504">225</xref></sup> the <italic>heart</italic> mentioned here is the power of desire, similar to the expressions: <italic>Thou hast given him his heart&#x2019;s desire;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn505">226</xref></sup> <italic>lust not after her beauty in thy heart</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn506">227</xref></sup> If so, <italic>with all thy soul</italic> denotes the intellectual [capacity rather than the sensual capacity of the] soul. Similarly, <italic>yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life</italic><sup><xref rid="fn507">228</xref></sup> [refers to the rational soul which is immortal]. And according to our Rabbis, who in the Talmud<sup><xref rid="fn508">229</xref></sup> derived from this [phrase] that one must submit to death and not violate [the Law, the expanded expression] &#x201C;with <italic>all</italic> thy soul&#x201D; is supplementary,<sup><xref rid="fn509">230</xref></sup> for since he said <italic>with &#x2018;all&#x2019; thy heart &#x2026; and with &#x2018;all&#x2019; thy might</italic> [where the intent is to exclude the serving of G-d with only part of the heart&#x2019;s capacity, or with only part of one&#x2019;s might or belongings], he also said <italic>with &#x2018;all&#x2019; thy soul</italic> [meaning &#x201C;your very life,&#x201D; despite the obvious fact that the command to give &#x201C;all&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;part&#x201D; of his life is incongruous]. The meaning thereof is that you love Him as your very life, giving up your life with love [for His sake whenever the Law requires you to do so].<sup><xref rid="fn510">231</xref></sup> Or [another explanation of the word <italic>all</italic> may be] that suffering or [the loss of body] organs are referred to as &#x201C;part of the soul,&#x201D; while martyrdom [death] is termed <italic>with &#x2018;all&#x2019; thy soul</italic>. And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented: &#x201C;<italic>thy soul</italic> means the desire, like: <italic>enough &#x2018;k&#x2019;nafshecha&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>at thine own</italic>) <italic>pleasure;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn511">232</xref></sup> <italic>the full soul loatheth a honey-comb;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn512">233</xref></sup> <italic>deliver me not over &#x2018;b&#x2019;nefesh&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>unto the desire of</italic>) <italic>mine adversaries</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn513">234</xref></sup> <italic>With all thy heart</italic> refers to knowledge, this being a surname for the rational spirit since [the heart] is its first resting place, and similarly it is stated, <italic>The wise in heart will receive commandments. &#x201D;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn514">235</xref></sup> Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra&#x2019;s interpretation of the expression <italic>with all thy heart</italic> appears likely from that which he stated, <italic>And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn515">236</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND WITH ALL &#x2018;M&#x2019;ODECHA.&#x2019; The meaning thereof is &#x201C;very exceedingly,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn516">237</xref></sup> the purport being &#x201C;love Him mightily.&#x201D; And in the opinion of our Rabbis<sup><xref rid="fn517">238</xref></sup> it means &#x201C;with all your wealth,&#x201D; for the property of a person is called <italic>m&#x2019;od</italic> (muchness, abundance) because it is described in terms of great quantity, just as it is called <italic>hamon</italic> (abundance, multitude): <italic>Better is a little that the righteous hath than the &#x2018;hamon&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>abundance</italic>) <italic>of many wicked;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn518">239</xref></sup> <italic>behold, they are as all &#x2018;hamon&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>multitude of</italic>) <italic>Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn519">240</xref></sup> It is also called <italic>chayil</italic> (wealth): <italic>They carry upon the shoulders of young asses &#x2018;cheileihem&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>their riches</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn520">241</xref></sup> <italic>I will give &#x2018;cheilcha&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>thy substance</italic>) <italic>and all thy treasures for a spoil;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn521">242</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;eth hachayil hazeh&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>this wealth</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn522">243</xref></sup> The verse here is thus stating, &#x201C;[Love Him] with all the abundance of your wealth.&#x201D; Similarly, it is stated, <italic>And like unto him</italic> [King Josiah] <italic>was there no king before him, that turned to the Eternal with all his heart, and with all his soul and with all &#x2018;m&#x2019;odo&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>his wealth</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn523">244</xref></sup> because they volunteered in the removal of the idols and the observance of the Passover-offering.</p>
<p>The purport of &#x201C;the love [of G-d]&#x201D; has been explained by our Rabbis, the most explicit of their statements is what they said in the Sifre:<sup><xref rid="fn524">245</xref></sup> &#x201C;Perhaps you will say &#x2018;I will study Torah in order that I be called wise, in order that I lead an academy, in order that I live long, or in order that I merit the World to Come.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn525">246</xref></sup> Therefore, Scripture says, <italic>to love the Eternal your G-d</italic> etc.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn526">247</xref></sup> Now the reason why Moses constantly says to them: <italic>that it may be well with thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn527">248</xref></sup> <italic>and that thou mayest prolong thy days</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn528">249</xref></sup> <italic>that ye may live, and go in and possess the Land</italic><sup><xref rid="fn529">250</xref></sup> [when in the light of the exhortation that we are to do the right thing only for the sake of the <italic>love</italic> of G-d], is that he admonishes them through reproofs to fear G-d, saying that if they will sin they will not possess the Land, or they will not prolong their days upon it. Or [another explanation] may be that the pious person must both love and fear G-d, and the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn530">251</xref></sup> &#x201C;Observe [His law] out of love, and observe it out of fear. Observe it out of love, for a lover does not despise, and observe it out of fear for if you come to reject [His authority], you will not do it.&#x201D; This has already been explained in the words of the Sages.<sup><xref rid="fn531">252</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. AND THOU SHALT TEACH THEM DILIGENTLY UNTO THY CHILDREN etc. These clarified commandments have also been alluded to previously, for, since He enjoined in certain commandments, <italic>It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn532">253</xref></sup> <italic>It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn533">254</xref></sup> <italic>This is My covenant, which ye shall keep, between Me and you and thy seed after thee</italic><sup><xref rid="fn534">255</xref></sup> &#x2014; we are thus [obviously] commanded [to see to it] that our children know the commandments, and how shall they know [the precepts] unless we teach them. Similarly, the commandment <italic>And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes</italic><sup><xref rid="fn535">256</xref></sup> has already been stated<sup><xref rid="fn536">257</xref></sup> and here he [further] explained <italic>and thou shalt bind them</italic> meaning that they be placed [upon the arm and head and secured tightly] through tying. It also alludes to the knot [in the strap] of the phylacteries that, according to the tradition received by our Rabbis, is a law declared to Moses on Sinai.<sup><xref rid="fn537">258</xref></sup> He added here the commandment of the <italic>Mezuzah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn538">259</xref></sup> &#x2014; <italic>And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house, and upon thy gates</italic><sup><xref rid="fn539">260</xref></sup> &#x2014; which is not mentioned there. Perhaps this, too, is [merely] explained [here rather than being an entirely new commandment] since it has been suggested in the commandment, <italic>and it be a memorial between thine eyes, that the law of the Eternal may be in thy mouth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn540">261</xref></sup> The meaning of the expression <italic>and upon thy gates</italic><sup><xref rid="fn539">260</xref></sup> is &#x201C;and upon the door-posts of the <italic>rest</italic> of your gates,&#x201D; such as the gates of cities and countries, similar to <italic>within any of &#x2018;thy gates&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn541">262</xref></sup> [which means &#x201C;any of &#x2018;your cities&#x2019; &#x201D;].</p>
<p>10. AND IT SHALL BE, WHEN THE ETERNAL THY G-D SHALL BRING THEE etc. He mentions here that, with the increase of beneficence, Israel [i.e., each individual Israelite] should remember <italic>the days of his affliction and of</italic> his <italic>anguish</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn542">263</xref></sup> when he was a servant in Egypt, and he is not to forget the G-d Who brought him forth out of that bondage to this goodness.<sup><xref rid="fn543">264</xref></sup> Instead he is always to remember His mercies and fear Him and serve Him as a servant does his master.<sup><xref rid="fn544">265</xref></sup> And in the opinion of our Rabbis<sup><xref rid="fn545">266</xref></sup> the verse further alludes [to the law] that anything found in the <italic>houses full of all &#x2018;good&#x2019; things</italic><sup><xref rid="fn546">267</xref></sup> [that were occupied in the conquest of Canaan] may be used, even if they contained things forbidden by the Torah such as <italic>kadli</italic><sup><xref rid="fn547">268</xref></sup> of swine, or the produce of a vineyard sown with diverse seeds,<sup><xref rid="fn548">269</xref></sup> or fruits of the first three years of a tree.<sup><xref rid="fn549">270</xref></sup> Even regarding cisterns, it is possible that in their construction forbidden materials were used in their coat of pitch [such as forbidden wine;<sup><xref rid="fn550">271</xref></sup> hence Scripture mentioned <italic>and cisterns hewn out, which thou didst not hew</italic><sup><xref rid="fn546">267</xref></sup> to indicate that they, too, were permitted to them]. Or it may be that the cisterns are mentioned figuratively, to denote the abundance of good things, thus giving them mastery over all that was found in the Land both permissible and impermissible. Thus all forbidden articles were permitted to them except [for those that were forbidden as a result of] the prohibition of idols, as he will yet clarify, <italic>thou shalt not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn551">272</xref></sup> Therefore, he mentions here in the next section, <italic>ye shall break down their altars</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn552">273</xref></sup> to destroy the idols and their appurtenances. But whatever else was found in the Land was permissible. This permission lasted until they consumed the spoil of their enemies.<sup><xref rid="fn553">274</xref></sup> And some Rabbis<sup><xref rid="fn554">275</xref></sup> say that this permission applied [only] to the seven years of [the] conquest [of the Land], and so it appears in the Gemara, in the first chapter of Tractate Chullin.<sup><xref rid="fn554">275</xref></sup> Now the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] wrote in the Laws of the Kings and their Wars:<sup><xref rid="fn555">276</xref></sup> &#x201C;Armed soldiers, when they enter the border of the nations and loot from them, are permitted to eat <italic>n&#x2019;veiloth</italic> and <italic>treifoth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn556">277</xref></sup> the flesh of swine and the like if they are hungry and do not find anything to eat except for these forbidden foods [i.e., only in the case of emergency are they permitted to eat these foods]. Similarly they may drink <italic>yayin nesech</italic> (wine dedicated to an idol). From tradition the Rabbis have learned: &#x2018;<italic>And houses full of all good things</italic><sup><xref rid="fn546">267</xref></sup> &#x2014; the necks of swine and the like.&#x2019; &#x201D; But this is not correct. For it is not because of danger to life or of hunger alone in time of war that [forbidden foods] were made permissible; rather, after they captured the large and wealthy cities and settled in them, was the spoil of their enemies permitted to them. And not to all armed soldiers [in any war throughout does this law apply as the Rabbi seems to hold], but only to [those who conquered] the Land which He swore to [give to] our fathers, as is explained in the subject before us. [Rabbi Moshe&#x2019;s ruling that the dispensation applies to] <italic>yayin nesech</italic> is also incorrect, for all forbidden articles pertaining to idolatry &#x2014; the idols themselves, their appurtenances, and their offerings &#x2014; are all forbidden as it is said, <italic>thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it, for it is a doomed thing</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn557">278</xref></sup> And if the Rabbi&#x2019;s intent was to permit in wartime only wine which was merely under suspicion of having been dedicated to idolatrous worship [which is a Rabbinic prohibition] &#x2014; why do we need a Scriptural interpretation for this? If Scriptural prohibitions were permitted [to them], could subjects of a Rabbinic decree be forbidden?&#x0021;</p>
<p>13. THOU SHALT FEAR THE ETERNAL THY G-D. The purport thereof is that after he commanded concerning the love of G-d, he mentioned that [one is] to fear Him so that he not sin and be punished.</p>
<p>AND HIM SHALT THOU SERVE &#x2014; to do whatever He commands you, like a servant who obeys the command of his master. It is possible that this is an allusion to the Service of the offerings to His Name. And so the Rabbis have said in the Sifre<sup><xref rid="fn558">279</xref></sup> on the verse, <italic>After the Eternal your G-d shall ye walk, and Him shall ye fear, and His commandments shall ye keep, and unto His voice shall ye hearken, and Him shall ye serve:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn559">280</xref></sup> &#x201C;Serve Him by [studying] His Torah, serve Him in His Sanctuary.&#x201D; By this the Sifre meant to explain that after he admonished concerning the observance of all the commandments and hearkening to His voice, the expression <italic>and Him shall ye serve</italic> means to serve Him in the Sanctuary with offerings, songs and prostrations [that are prescribed] there. This is termed &#x201C;service&#x201D; as He said, <italic>I give you the priesthood as &#x2018;a service&#x2019; of gift</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn560">281</xref></sup> and it further says, <italic>And the Levites alone shall do &#x2018;the service.&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn561">282</xref></sup> The Rabbis further interpreted [in the above-mentioned Sifre]: &#x201C;Serve Him through His Torah,&#x201D; meaning to study the Torah and meditate therein; this, too, is a &#x201C;service&#x201D; before Him. Accordingly, <italic>and Him shalt thou serve</italic> [mentioned in the verse before us] is also a reference to serving Him by the offerings. And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote: &#x201C;<italic>Thou shalt fear the Eternal thy G-d</italic> &#x2014; you should not transgress the negative commandments; <italic>and Him shalt thou serve</italic> &#x2014; fulfill the positive commandments.&#x201D; But this is not correct, for he stated in the other verse [mentioned above], <italic>and Him shall ye fear, and His commandments shall ye keep &#x2026; and Him shall ye serve</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn562">283</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND BY HIS NAME SHALT THOU SWEAR. This is not a commandment to swear [by His Name],<sup><xref rid="fn563">284</xref></sup> but it is an admonishment that [in the event one is required to take an oath] he should swear only by His Name and not by the name of another deity. After this [injunction to swear only by the name of G-d] it is written, <italic>Ye shall not go after other gods</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn564">285</xref></sup> meaning that you should not follow them in any of these matters: that you not fear them, that you not serve them, and that you not swear by their names. However, in the Gemara of Tractate Temurah<sup><xref rid="fn565">286</xref></sup> the Rabbis interpreted this verse to teach that a true oath is permissible.<sup><xref rid="fn566">287</xref></sup> Thus they said: &#x201C;Why did the Merciful One state <italic>and by His Name shalt thou swear</italic>? Since it cannot refer to the oaths administered by the judges, because they have already been derived from the verse <italic>the oath of the Eternal shall be between them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn567">288</xref></sup> apply it to indicate that other oaths are permissible. And since it cannot refer to an oath by which one binds himself to perform a commandment, as that is derived from the expression, <italic>and to Him shalt thou cleave</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn568">289</xref></sup> then apply it to an oath about a non-sacred [i.e., a permissible, but non-obligatory] matter.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now, I have further seen the following text in the Tanchuma:<sup><xref rid="fn569">290</xref></sup> &#x201C;The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel: Do not think that it has been made permissible to you to swear by My Name. You are not permitted to swear by My Name even truthfully unless you possess all these qualities: <italic>Thou shalt fear the Eternal thy G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn568">289</xref></sup> that you will be like those who were called &#x2018;men who fear the Eternal G-d,&#x2019; such as Abraham,<sup><xref rid="fn570">291</xref></sup> Job,<sup><xref rid="fn571">292</xref></sup> and Joseph.<sup><xref rid="fn572">293</xref></sup> And <italic>Him shalt thou serve</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn568">289</xref></sup> that you will devote yourself to [the study of] Torah and [the observance of] the commandments and you will have no other preoccupation. Therefore it is stated, and <italic>Him thou shalt serve. And to Him shalt thou cleave</italic><sup><xref rid="fn568">289</xref></sup> &#x2014; but is it possible for a human being to cleave to the Divine Glory? Has it not been stated, <italic>For the Eternal thy G-d is a devouring fire</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn573">294</xref></sup> But this statement is intended to teach you that whoever gives his daughter in marriage to a scholar who learns Torah and studies Mishnah, and who trades on his behalf and who benefits him from his wealth &#x2014; of this He says, <italic>and to Him shalt thou cleave</italic>. If you possess all these virtues, you may swear [by My Name] and if not, you may not swear.&#x201D; Thus far is the text of this Agadah. Thus, the interpretation of the verse [before us], <italic>and by His Name shalt thou swear</italic>, in the opinion of the Rabbis, is a grant of permission, that He allows us, as an expression of esteem, to do so. It is as if he had said, &#x201C;<italic>Thou shalt fear the Eternal thy G-d</italic>; nevertheless you may swear by His Name and you need not fear doing so.&#x201D; And because this permission is placed after the commands to fear G-d and to serve Him, the Rabbis inferred that there is no authorization to swear until after these virtues have been attained. Or Scripture may be stating <italic>Thou shalt fear the Eternal thy G-d</italic> and His awe will be so great upon you that His very Name will be an oath to you, so that even when you wish to confirm something you will swear by His Name even to your disadvantage and you will not misrepresent.<sup><xref rid="fn574">295</xref></sup> And in the opinion of the Rabbis, the meaning of the expression <italic>and Him shalt thou serve</italic> is that you should act toward him at all times like a bondsman constantly in service before his master, considering the work of his master as primary and his own needs as casual, until, [resulting] from this [attitude] he attains what the Rabbis have said, &#x201C;And let all thy deeds be done for the sake of Heaven.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn575">296</xref></sup> For even bodily needs should be for the purpose of G-d&#x2019;s worship. Thus a person should eat and sleep and attend to his needs to assure the existence of the body to serve G-d. This is similar to what the Rabbis have said,<sup><xref rid="fn576">297</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And G-d saw every thing that He had made, and, behold, it was very good</italic><sup><xref rid="fn577">298</xref></sup> &#x2014; this refers to sleep. Is sleep good? [It is &#x2018;good&#x2019;] because, if a person sleeps a little, he rises and engages in the study of Torah.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn578">299</xref></sup> Thus, in satisfying bodily needs, one should concentrate upon the verse <italic>I will praise the Eternal while I live; I will sing praises unto my G-d while I have my being</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn579">300</xref></sup> This is a correct interpretation.</p>
<p>16. YE SHALL NOT TRY THE ETERNAL YOUR G-D, meaning AS YE TRIED HIM IN MASSAH. You are not to say &#x201C;If the Eternal is among us to perform miracles on our behalf or, if we succeed when we worship Him <italic>and we have plenty of food, and are well</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn580">301</xref></sup> then we will observe His Torah.&#x201D; For that was the intent of the people there [in Massah]<sup><xref rid="fn581">302</xref></sup> that they would see that if G-d would provide water for them through a miracle from Himself, they would follow Him in the wilderness, and if not, they would forsake Him. This was considered a great sin on their part, for, after it had been confirmed to them with signs and wonders that Moses was a prophet of G-d <italic>and that the word of the Eternal in</italic> his <italic>mouth</italic> was <italic>truth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn582">303</xref></sup> it was no longer proper to do anything as a test. Whoever does it, is not testing [the credibility of] the prophet, it is only G-d blessed be He, whom he is testing to determine whether <italic>the Eternal&#x2019;s hand waxed short</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn583">304</xref></sup> He prohibited for all generations to test the Torah or the prophets because it is not proper to worship G-d by being skeptical or by requesting a wonder or some test, since it is not G-d&#x2019;s will to perform miracles for all men at all times.<sup><xref rid="fn584">305</xref></sup> Nor is it fitting to serve Him in order to receive a reward.<sup><xref rid="fn585">306</xref></sup> Instead, should one find suffering and misfortune [as a result of] serving Him and walking in the ways of the Torah, it is proper that he accept everything as a just judgment and he should not say, as the wicked ones of our people said, <italic>And what profit is it that we have kept His charge, and that we have walked mournfully, because of the Eternal of hosts?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn586">307</xref></sup> Scripture states here <italic>Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the Eternal your G-d, and His testimonies</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn587">308</xref></sup> [alluding] that these are the miracles which He did for you of old in order that they be a testimony for you, such as the Passover, the Unleavened Bread, and the Booth. And you should keep <italic>His statutes</italic><sup><xref rid="fn587">308</xref></sup> even though you do not know their purpose for, in truth, He will benefit you in the end. There is no need for verification of the Torah and the commandments since it has been confirmed to you that it is from Him, blessed be He. Similarly, if any prophet has [previously] been tested and confirmed as a true prophet with signs and wonders in accordance with the law of the Torah,<sup><xref rid="fn588">309</xref></sup> you must not challenge his words regarding any reward or punishment he tells you about, and have no doubt about His power, exalted be He, [to bring it about]. Rather, you are to believe in His Torah and believe in His prophets and you will prosper. Thus he has assured us that ultimately the honor will surely come through possession of the Land and triumph over the enemies, for this was the great beneficence that was necessary for that generation. Thereafter he said that for future generations there was no need for testing [the reward for] the observance of the commandments; instead, they are to inquire of their fathers and their elders and they [the fathers and elders] will tell them of the veracity of the Torah and the commandments, as he will explain [in the verse], <italic>When thy son asketh thee</italic><sup><xref rid="fn589">310</xref></sup> &#x2014; up to the conclusion of the section.</p>
<p>18. AND THOU SHALT DO THAT WHICH IS RIGHT AND GOOD IN THE SIGHT OF THE ETERNAL. In line with the plain meaning of Scripture the verse says, &#x201C;Keep the commandments of G-d, His testimonies, and His statutes, and, in observing them, intend to do what is right and good in His sight only.&#x201D; And [the expression in the verse before us] <italic>that it may be well with thee</italic> is a promise, stating that, when you will do that which is good in His eyes, it will be well with you, for G-d does <italic>good unto the good, and to them that are upright in their hearts</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn590">311</xref></sup> Our Rabbis have a beautiful Midrash on this verse. They have said:<sup><xref rid="fn591">312</xref></sup> &#x201C;[<italic>That which is right and good</italic>] refers to a compromise and going beyond the requirement of the letter of the law.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn592">313</xref></sup> The intent of this is as follows: At first he [Moses] stated that you are to keep His statutes and His testimonies which He commanded you, and now he is stating that even where He has not commanded you, give thought, as well, to do what is good and right in His eyes, for He loves the good and the right. Now this is a great principle, for it is impossible to mention in the Torah all aspects of man&#x2019;s conduct with his neighbors and friends, and all his various transactions, and the ordinances of all societies and countries. But since He mentioned many of them &#x2014; such as, <italic>Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn593">314</xref></sup> <italic>Thou shalt not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn594">315</xref></sup> <italic>neither shalt thou stand idly by the blood of thy neighbor;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn593">314</xref></sup> <italic>Thou shalt not curse the deaf;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn595">316</xref></sup> <italic>Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head</italic><sup><xref rid="fn596">317</xref></sup> and the like &#x2014; he reverted to state in a general way that, in all matters, one should do what is good and right, including even compromise and, going beyond the requirements of the law.<sup><xref rid="fn592">313</xref></sup> Other examples are the Rabbis&#x2019; ordinances concerning the prerogative of a neighbor,<sup><xref rid="fn597">318</xref></sup> and even what they said [concerning the desirability] that one&#x2019;s youthful reputation be unblemished,<sup><xref rid="fn598">319</xref></sup> and that one&#x2019;s conversation with people be pleasant. Thus [a person must seek to refine his behavior] in every form of activity, until he is worthy of being called &#x201C;good and upright.&#x201D;</p>
<p>20. WHEN THY SON ASKETH THEE IN TIME TO COME, SAYING: &#x2018;WHAT MEAN THE TESTIMONIES, AND THE STATUTES, AND THE ORDINANCES etc.?&#x2019; The meaning thereof is that first he will ask, &#x201C;These commandments called <italic>testimonies</italic> &#x2014; to what do they testify?&#x201D; For they are a memorial to His wonders<sup><xref rid="fn599">320</xref></sup> and witnesses thereof, such as the Unleavened Bread, the Booth, the Passover, the Sabbath, the phylacteries, and the <italic>Mezuzah</italic>. [Then he will ask] &#x201C;What are <italic>the statutes</italic>?,&#x201D; for their reasons are hidden in the Torah. Of <italic>the ordinances</italic> he will inquire: &#x201C;What are the ordinances that we enforce in these commandments &#x2014; stoning him who does work on the Sabbath, burning him who has intercourse with a woman and her mother, and administering forty lashes to him who sows mixed seeds?&#x201D; For the ordinances pertaining to the social order of countries &#x2014; such as the laws of the ox, the pit, the guardians, and the rest of the laws of the Torah &#x2014; are righteous and good, <italic>all that see them acknowledge them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn600">321</xref></sup> [and of these they do not ask]. Now concerning the answer to this question, he commanded that we relate to the inquirer the whole subject of the exodus from Egypt,<sup><xref rid="fn601">322</xref></sup> the intent thereof being as He stated in the Ten Commandments, <italic>Who brought thee out of the land of Egypt</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn602">323</xref></sup> directing us that we inform the inquiring son that the Eternal is the Creator [through Whom everything has come into existence] by His will and power, as has been made clear to us by the exodus from Egypt. This is the sense of the expression [<italic>And the Eternal showed signs</italic> &#x2026;] <italic>&#x2018;before our eyes,&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn603">324</xref></sup> for it is we who know and are witnesses of the signs and wonders, for we saw there that the Eternal is our G-d, <italic>He is the G-d in heaven above and upon the earth beneath</italic>, and <italic>there is none else</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn604">325</xref></sup> All this was made known through the departure from Egypt, as I have explained in the first commandment.<sup><xref rid="fn605">326</xref></sup> Thus it befits us to give honor to His Name, for He is our Creator, and [He] has magnified His mercy upon us, and He <italic>commanded us to do all these statutes</italic><sup><xref rid="fn606">327</xref></sup> mentioned in the testimonies, statutes, and ordinances [about which the son had asked]: <italic>to fear Him</italic><sup><xref rid="fn606">327</xref></sup> by performing [commandments known as] <italic>the testimonies</italic> which are a memorial to His wonders;<sup><xref rid="fn599">320</xref></sup> <italic>for our good</italic><sup><xref rid="fn606">327</xref></sup> through performance of [commandments known as] the statutes for they are good, there being no statute which contains any evil, although their reasons have not been clarified to all people;<sup><xref rid="fn607">328</xref></sup> <italic>that He might preserve us alive</italic><sup><xref rid="fn606">327</xref></sup> through [the commandments called] <italic>the ordinances</italic>. For we shall live by all [three kinds of commandments] together as they are all good, containing nothing harmful at all, but instead they all ultimately result in good life. Thus we are obliged to do the will of the Creator Who is our G-d, and we are His people, <italic>and the flock of His hand</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn608">329</xref></sup> and there is nothing but good in all of His commandments. And what is more, <italic>it shall be accounted virtue unto us before the Eternal our G-d</italic><sup><xref rid="fn609">330</xref></sup> and He will give us good reward for observing all these commandments. The verse refers to the reward for the observance of the commandments as &#x201C;righteousness&#x201D; [in the sense of charity] for the bondsman who was bought by his master is obliged to serve him [and has no claim to payment for his service]. If the master gives him payment for his service, he does an act of righteousness with him.</p>
<h1>7</h1>
<p>6. THE ETERNAL THY G-D HATH CHOSEN THEE TO BE HIS OWN TREASURE. For you have <italic>no chief, overseer, or ruler</italic><sup><xref rid="fn610">331</xref></sup> among all the angels on high, but you are the treasure of G-d under His power, and, therefore, you should not go astray to serve idols from among the gods of the peoples. I have already mentioned this many times.<sup><xref rid="fn611">332</xref></sup> This is the sense of the verse, <italic>The Eternal did not set His love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn612">333</xref></sup> for it would have been proper that the King&#x2019;s [chosen people should] be the most numerous, as it is written, <italic>In the multitude of people is the king&#x2019;s glory</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn613">334</xref></sup> and that He appoint captains of the host at the head of the rest of the people.<sup><xref rid="fn614">335</xref></sup> <italic>But you are the fewest</italic> [<italic>of all peoples</italic>] &#x2014; nevertheless He craved you and chose you&#x0021;</p>
<p>7. &#x2018;CHASHAK&#x2019; (HE TOOK DELIGHT). The meaning thereof is that He had &#x201C;bound&#x201D; Himself with you with a mighty bond that He will never be separated from you, similar in expression to <italic>&#x2018;vachashukeihem&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and their fillets</italic> &#x2014; silver threads encircling the pillars of the Tabernacle) <italic>shall be of silver</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn615">336</xref></sup> <italic>And He has chosen you</italic> from among all peoples that you be His treasure and inheritance, for &#x201C;being chosen&#x201D; always implies selection from others. And he stated the reason, <italic>But because the Eternal loved you</italic><sup><xref rid="fn616">337</xref></sup> He chose you, meaning, He saw you to be worthier than all peoples to be loved by Him and to be chosen for love. He mentioned for this no [other] reason except that you were chosen [because of His love for you], for he who is chosen to be loved, is known to be ready to suffer whatever comes upon him from his lover, and the Israelites are more qualified for that than any other people. As the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn617">338</xref></sup> &#x201C;Three [creatures] are of strong character, Israel among the nations etc.,&#x201D; for Israel has stood by Him in all trials. [When challenged by the nations, Israel has stubbornly declared,] &#x201C;Either [we remain loyal] Jews or [we will be] nailed to the stake.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn618">339</xref></sup> And the purport of the word <italic>you</italic> [<italic>and He chose &#x2018;you&#x2019;</italic>] is &#x201C;because of your fathers,&#x201D; who became so worthy that He swore to them<sup><xref rid="fn619">340</xref></sup> in order that no sin should cause [His] promise [to them] to be nullified. Therefore He brought you out from the land of Egypt with a mighty hand. <italic>And He redeemed you</italic><sup><xref rid="fn616">337</xref></sup> &#x2014; this is an allusion that He smote them in your stead, similar to what is said, <italic>I have given Egypt as thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn620">341</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. KNOW THEREFORE from the [circumstances of the] departure from Egypt THAT THE ETERNAL THY G-D, HE IS G-D Who created heaven and earth, as I have explained.<sup><xref rid="fn621">342</xref></sup> And know furthermore from this that He is THE FAITHFUL G-D Whose word shall not return void,<sup><xref rid="fn622">343</xref></sup> and WHO KEEPETH THE COVENANT AND MERCY WITH THEM THAT LOVE HIM, AND KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS, who fear His Name, TO A THOUSAND GENERATIONS of their seed, just as He kept for you the covenant of your fathers. And know further that He <italic>repayeth them that hate Him</italic><sup><xref rid="fn623">344</xref></sup> the recompense of their wickedness to the face of each one of them <italic>to destroy them</italic>, just as He destroyed the Egyptians and did not delay [in bringing punishment] to them. Now this attribute that he mentioned is true forever. Thus although <italic>there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his evil-doing</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn624">345</xref></sup> it happens to him only because of this above-mentioned attribute that He is the Keeper of Mercy, and he [the wicked] has done some good which must be recompensed. If so, there are among the attributes of the Holy One, blessed be He, but two ways [of dealing with people]: He repays good for good, and evil for evil.</p>
<p>It is possible that <italic>those that hate Him</italic> [mentioned here as destined to be destroyed without delay] are those confirmed sinners who deny His existence and have no merit at all. As the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn625">346</xref></sup> &#x201C;Rabbi Yashiyah said: Because of three things the Holy One, blessed be He, is long-suffering to the wicked in this world: they may repent, or they have observed commandments for which the Holy One, blessed be He, repays them their recompense in this world, or perhaps righteous people will descend from them. For so we find that He was long-suffering with Ahaz,<sup><xref rid="fn626">347</xref></sup> and Hezekiah came from him; so also to Amon,<sup><xref rid="fn627">348</xref></sup> and Josiah came from him; and so also to Shimei,<sup><xref rid="fn628">349</xref></sup> and Mordecai came from him.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn629">350</xref></sup> Thus all these [three above categories] are not included in [the term] <italic>those that hate Him</italic>. Now there is a secret in the expression <italic>&#x2018;el panav&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>to his face</italic>) [<italic>And He repayeth &#x2018;them&#x2019; that hate Him &#x2018;el panav&#x2019;</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;to his face&#x201D;]<sup><xref rid="fn630">351</xref></sup> as applying to a wicked man who has a good [i.e., a happy and prosperous] life.<sup><xref rid="fn631">352</xref></sup> And then he returns to say, <italic>Thou shalt therefore keep the commandment</italic> etc.,<sup><xref rid="fn632">353</xref></sup> meaning: &#x201C;<italic>therefore keep the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances</italic> so that you should not be among those who hate Him, who are destroyed, but instead you should be of <italic>those that love Him and keep His commandments</italic><sup><xref rid="fn633">354</xref></sup> who are remembered for good and for life.&#x201D;</p>

<ftnote id="fn287">(8) The gist of Ramban&#x2019;s comment is as follows: The Divine Name which begins with the letters <italic>Aleph Dalet</italic> represents the attribute of justice; the Name beginning with the letters <italic>Yod Hei</italic> signifies the attribute of mercy. Since of the two Divine Names mentioned here in the verse, the first one is with <italic>Aleph Dalet</italic> and the second one with <italic>Yod Hei</italic>, Rashi should have interpreted them to mean, &#x201C;Lord of judgment in the attribute of mercy,&#x201D; instead of writing, &#x201C;merciful in judgment,&#x201D; implying that the first Name signifies mercy and the second one judgment.

<ftnote id="fn292">(13) Genesis 15:2. This is interpreted by the above Midrash as follows. &#x201C;Said Rabbi Levi: Abraham said, &#x2018;O Master of the universe.

The reason would seem to be that the verse here relates to adding to, or diminishing from, a Divine commandment, such as placing five sections of the Torah, or only three, in the phylacteries instead of the four sections ordained. The verse of 13:1, however, refers to adding a completely new commandment to the number of <italic>Taryag</italic> (613) Commandments, or of abolishing altogether one of the Divine precepts. In speaking, therefore, of the prophetic precept of reading the Scroll of Esther on Purim, Ramban thus rightly cites the verse from further on (13:1), for were it not that the prophets and Sages of that time found it intimated in the Torah, the prohibition against instituting such a new commandment would have come under the admonition, <italic>thou shalt not add thereto</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn315">(36) Torath Kohanim, at end of <italic>Bechukothai</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn316">(37) Yebamoth 21a-b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn317">(38) In other words, the duty devolving upon the Sages to establish &#x201C;fences&#x201D; [i.e., safeguards against trespassing the law of the Torah] is specifically stated in the Torah, but the precise terms of these &#x201C;fences&#x201D; are not written. &#x2014; The duty of establishing such preventive Rabbinical laws is based on the verse, <italic>ushmartem eth mishmarti</italic> (<italic>and ye shall keep My charge</italic> &#x2014; Leviticus 18:30), tradition interpreting this to mean: &#x201C;Make a <italic>mishmereth</italic> (a protection, a fence as a safeguard) <italic>l&#x2019;mishmarti</italic> (for My commandment)&#x201D; (Yebamoth 21 b).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn318">(39) Further 11:13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn319">(40) Thus, although Verse 8 here uses the past tense, it should be interpreted as if it used the present tense.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn320">(41) In Verse 5 before us.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn321">(42) So explained in the Tur. The reference is to Moses&#x2019; words, above in Verse 3: <italic>Your eyes have seen what the Eternal did because of Baal-peor</italic> etc.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn326">(47) See Verse 8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn327">(48) Ramban&#x2019;s point seems to be that since the verse uses the expression, <italic>hishamer</italic> (take heed), it should be interpreted as a prohibition as will be explained. According to Rashi, however, it is not a prohibition, but a mere negation: if they do not observe the commandments, they will not be considered wise and understanding men.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn331">(52) Verse 9 before us.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn332">(53) See Verse 10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn333">(54) Here in the commentary Ramban clearly holds that our duty to remember the Revelation on Sinai is comprised of two parts: 1) the prohibition against ever forgetting it, and 2) the positive duty of informing our children of the event. However, in his notes to Rambam&#x2019;s Sefer Hamitzvoth (Book of the Commandments), Ramban lists as one of his supplementary commandments the prohibition against ever forgetting the Revelation (see also &#x201C;The Commandments,&#x201D; Vol. II, p. 335, Commandment 2), but he does not mention the positive commandment to inform our children thereof (see <italic>ibid.</italic>, Vol. I, pp. 263-265). To resolve this difficulty we must say that Ramban includes the positive duty in the general commandment of teaching our children the words of the Torah (further 6:7; &#x201C;The Commandments,&#x201D; Vol. I, pp. 16-18), which of course includes the narrative of the Revelation.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn360">(81) Aside from the mystical allusions here implied, Ramban&#x2019;s words can also be interpreted as follows: In addition to the several categories of graven images against which Moses warned the people, there was yet one more fear. They might deify Moses himself, since he was their leader and lawgiver. It was therefore necessary that he die in the wilderness lest the people consider him immortal and worship him as a deity (T&#x2019;cheileth Mordechai; see my Hebrew commentary, p. 363).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn365">(86) Verse 24.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn366">(87) Verse 26. Ramban&#x2019;s point is thus that we are not to understand Verses 25 and 26 as expressing two independent thoughts [<italic>When thou shalt beget children &#x2026; I call heaven and earth &#x2026;</italic>], but instead they constitute one statement, as follows: &#x201C;Should a longer period of security in the Land create a tendency among the people to idolatry, heaven and earth will witness Israel&#x2019;s loss of the Land.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn367">(88) Gittin 88 a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn368">(89) The numerical-value of the Hebrew letters in the word <italic>v&#x2019;noshantem</italic> is equivalent to 852 [<italic>vav</italic> &#x003D; 6; <italic>nun</italic> &#x003D; 50; <italic>vav</italic> &#x003D; 6; <italic>shin</italic> &#x003D; 300; <italic>nun</italic> &#x003D; 50; <italic>tav</italic> &#x003D; 400; <italic>mem</italic> &#x003D; 40; &#x2014; totalling 852]. Thus at the end of 852 years from the time that Israel came into the Land the exile was to occur. G-d, however, brought this about two years earlier in order that the prophecy &#x2014; they shall &#x201C;utterly perish&#x201D; &#x2014; at the end of that period should not come to pass. By bringing about the exile two years before the terminus of 852 years, G-d voided the prediction of total retribution. &#x2014; It is of interest to note that in his Sefer Hage&#x2019;ulah (Book of Redemption) Ramban similarly writes of the future redemption that, after it will have occurred, the allusion to that date will be found in this section of the Torah (Kithvei Haramban, Vol. I, p. 263).</ftnote>

However, from Ramban&#x2019;s following comments, it is clear that in his text of Rashi this part, too, of the quotation mentioned in the text was stated in Verse 12, in connection with the commandment on the Sabbath.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn425">(146) Verse 16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn426">(147) See Vol. II, pp. 208-209.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn429">(150) See further, 11:15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn430">(151) This alludes to the fact that the first four books of the Torah were given in the Great Name [i.e., the Tetragrammaton] whereas Deuteronomy was presented as if spoken by the messenger of the Almighty (Abusaula). See my Hebrew commentary, p. 366; also Vol. II, pp. 282-284.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn432">(153) Verse 14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn433">(154) Exodus 34:21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn434">(155) Verses 14-15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn435">(156) The primary concern of this law is thus not that the servant should have rest, but that we are to remember that we were servants and G-d made it possible for us to rest, and therefore we should give rest to our servants (Bachya). Thus we are prevented from becoming self-righteous as a result of &#x201C;magnanimously&#x201D; granting a day of rest to our servants. On the contrary, kindness to servants should be utilized as a reminder to us of our former humble position and of G-d&#x2019;s kindness to us which we are to emulate to others.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn436">(157) Thus, according to Ibn Ezra, the basic commandment to rest on the Sabbath is in remembrance of Creation as it is given in Exodus 20:11, while the giving of rest to our servants is in remembrance of the exodus as given in our verse. In this way Ibn Ezra resolves the difficulty as to why in the Ten Commandments in the Book of Exodus the reason for the Sabbath is given as remembrance of the Creation, while here the reason is given as the remembrance of the exodus. Ramban will refute this solution of Ibn Ezra, as explained in the text that follows.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn437">(158) See Vol. II, pp. 313-315.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn438">(159) In other words, the text of the <italic>Kiddush</italic> of the Sabbath-day equates both reasons &#x2014; the remembrance of the Creation and the remembrance of the exodus &#x2014; as applying to the Sabbath itself, rather than referring to two different things as Ibn Ezra differentiated between them (see Note 157 above).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn439">(160) Guide of the Perplexed II, 31. Ramban is following Al-Charizi&#x2019;s translation, and not that of Ibn Tibbon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn440">(161) Exodus 20:11. Thus the verse in Exodus indicates that the Sabbath-day was honored because it is symbolic of the Creation which was the handiwork of G-d alone.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn441">(162) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, 31:17.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn442">(163) Thus excluding the theory that formation of the world is a result of some natural necessity. Instead we are to believe the universe is a result of G-d&#x2019;s Will and design.</ftnote>

The verse there begins: <italic>If thou wilt not &#x2018;observe&#x2019;</italic> &#x2026; The term &#x201C;observe&#x201D; found in the commandment of the Sabbath is thus to be understood in the light of that verse which begins with the expression of &#x201C;observe&#x201D; and concludes with a reference to the &#x201C;fear&#x201D; of G-d, as the text proceeds to explain.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn450">(171) Psalms 85:13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn451">(172) In Exodus 20:13, the verse reads: <italic>Thou shalt not bear &#x2018;eid shaker&#x2019;</italic> (false witness). Ramban explains that the admonition here prohibits bearing such false testimony even when it cannot possibly harm the neighbor at all and is consequently &#x201C;vain&#x201D; and worthless in court. The prohibition in Exodus, on the other hand, concerns the kind of false testimony which aims to really harm the other person. Thus the verse here explains the full extent of the admonition.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn452">(173) Genesis 8:21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn453">(174) Thus, if a person really desires something but does nothing to obtain it, he transgresses the prohibition, <italic>neither shalt thou desire</italic>. If his desire for the object is so strong that he obtains it through some scheme, he additionally transgresses the commandment, <italic>Thou shalt not covet</italic>. But if the owner refuses under all circumstances to sell it and he takes it by force, he also transgresses the commandment, <italic>Nor shalt thou rob him</italic> (Leviticus 19:13). See &#x201C;The Commandments,&#x201D; Vol. II, pp. 251-252.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn456">(177) Exodus 19:19. This indicates that the voice was not even in pitch and in volume, thus contradicting Rashi&#x2019;s opinion that the sound was constant in volume from beginning to end.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn457">(178) Tanchuma, <italic>Yithro</italic> 13. This text also shows that the sound was not constant.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn458">(179) In other words, so that the ear should not be unduly taxed at first, the sound began at a low volume and gradually increased in order that the ear should adjust to the change. &#x2014; Thus, this text of the Rabbis likewise affirms that the voice was not even, in contradiction to the comment of Rashi.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn463">(184) Exodus 19:20. See Vol. II, pp. 283-284. In other words, only in the first two commandments did they hear the voice and understand the words, while in the other eight commandments &#x201C;He did not add anything <italic>to all your assembly</italic> except that one voice,&#x201D; meaning that they heard the voice but Moses explained to them the words (Abusaula).

<ftnote id="fn467">(188) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, Verse 11. Ramban&#x2019;s intent in citing this verse is to show that the Divine Name, <italic>E-il chai</italic>, used by Joshua in the preceding Verse 10, is not synonymous with the Name <italic>Elokim chayim</italic>, used in the verse before us. There, Joshua continued to explain it, <italic>Behold the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth</italic>, thus intimating that <italic>E-il chai</italic> means &#x201C;G-d Who gives life to the entire world,&#x201D; or &#x201C;G-d of all the living&#x201D;, while <italic>Elokim chayim</italic> means &#x201C;the living G-d,&#x201D; and therefore alludes to the fact that the soul of someone who hears the voice of G-d will cleave to its &#x201C;foundation&#x201D; etc., as explained in the text.

He will explain every dot and decoration of all letters.&#x201D; Moses then requested that he be permitted to listen to one of Rabbi Akiba&#x2019;s lectures. After hearing it, Moses returned to G-d and said, &#x201C;You have a man like Akiba and you give the Torah through me&#x0021;&#x201D; G-d answered, &#x201C;Be silent; so I have decreed.&#x201D; Moses then asked that he be shown Rabbi Akiba&#x2019;s reward. G-d answered, &#x201C;Turn around,&#x201D; Moses then saw etc. &#x2014; Rabbi Akiba was one of the Ten Martyrs from among the greatest Rabbis of the generation who were put to death by command of the Roman Emperor Hadrian for their public defiance of the Roman ban against studying the Torah and the general practice of Judaism. See Vol. II, p. 301, and Note 369.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn476">(197) In his Shaar Ha&#x2019;gmul (Gate of the Reward) Ramban writes as follows in explanation of this text: &#x201C;The Sages thereby wanted to say that Rabbi Akiba&#x2019;s death through sufferings was not occasioned by the few wrongdoings which every person, even the most righteous, cannot escape, for he was a perfect, righteous man. But the matter is hidden, such being His decree and will&#x201D; (Kithvei Haramban, Vol. II, p. 275). Ramban, however, proceeds to connect the matter with the secret of the transmigration of souls (see Vol. II, p. 300 and Note 361).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn500">(221) Pesachim 56 a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn501">(222) The first word of the section beginning with the verse before us. The word <italic>S&#x2019;hma</italic> is used as the title for the group of three portions from Scripture (Deuteronomy 6:4-9; 11:13-21; Numbers 15:37-41) which we must recite twice daily, in the morning and in the evening. See &#x201C;The Commandments,&#x201D; Vol. I, pp. 15-16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn502">(223) &#x201C;If she were to express her desire for it she would be embarrassed; if she were to remain silent she would find it painful. So her servants began bringing it to her quietly.&#x201D; The parable explains why the Sages instituted this sacred prayer of praise &#x2014; &#x201C;Blessed be His Name Whose glorious Kingdom etc.&#x201D; is to be recited as part of <italic>Sh&#x2019;ma</italic>, but should be done quietly (Pesachim 56 a).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn509">(230) For, since <italic>thy soul</italic> by itself indicates that you must suffer martyrdom rather than deny the Law, the question arises, what is signified by the additional word <italic>all</italic> [<italic>&#x2018;all&#x2019; thy soul</italic>], since you cannot speak of half a life? Ramban will offer two answers.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn515">(236) Verse 6. This shows that <italic>with all thy &#x2018;heart&#x2019;</italic> refers to the rational soul, for in that case it is possible to say that these words shall be upon your &#x201C;heart&#x201D; meaning your rational soul. But if we are to interpret <italic>with all thy &#x2018;heart&#x2019;</italic> as referring to the desires, as explained earlier, then how can it be said that <italic>these words</italic> shall be upon your &#x201C;heart&#x201D; or your desires?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn516">(237) Literally: &#x201C;very very much,&#x201D; from the word <italic>m&#x2019;od</italic> &#x2014; muchness, abundance.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn562">(283) Further, 13:5. This shows that the expression <italic>and Him shalt thou serve</italic> does not refer to the positive commandments, as Ibn Ezra says, for that charge is included in the phrase, <italic>and His commandments shall ye keep</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn563">(284) The intent is to differ with Rambam who, in his Sefer Hamitzvoth, enumerated this verse as one of the positive commandments wherein we are commanded to swear only by His Name whenever we are required to confirm or deny something under oath.

<title>Eikev</title>
<p>12. AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS &#x2018;EIKEV&#x2019; YE HEARKEN. <italic>Eikev</italic> means &#x201C;because.&#x201D; So also, <italic>&#x2018;eikev&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>because</italic>) <italic>that Abraham hearkened to My voice</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn634">1</xref></sup> And Rashi wrote: &#x201C;If you will hearken even to the lighter commandments which a person usually treads upon with his &#x2018;heels&#x2019; [i.e., those commandments which a person is inclined to treat lightly] then G-d will keep His promise to you.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn635">2</xref></sup> Now Scripture mentions <italic>the ordinances</italic> [<italic>And it shall come to pass &#x2018;eikev&#x2019; ye hearken to these &#x2018;ordinances&#x2019;</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn636">3</xref></sup> perhaps because he admonishes them not to be disdainful of the lightly-esteemed ordinances such as the laws pertaining to monetary matters.</p>
<p>And the commentators<sup><xref rid="fn637">4</xref></sup> have said that the meaning of the word <italic>eikev</italic> is that &#x201C;in the end&#x201D; there will be reward. Similarly, <italic>in keeping them</italic> [the ordinances of G-d] <italic>&#x2019;eikev rav&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>there is</italic> [in the end] <italic>great reward</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn638">5</xref></sup> The verse here is thus stating: &#x201C;and the end [the ultimate consequence] of your hearkening to the ordinances and your observing them is that G-d shall keep the covenant and the mercy, <italic>and He will love thee</italic>. &#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn639">6</xref></sup> This is correct, for in the Sacred Language the beginning of anything is called <italic>rosh</italic> [literally: &#x201C;head&#x201D;], as it is said, <italic>&#x2018;rosh&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the beginning of</italic>) <italic>Thy word is truth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn640">7</xref></sup> So also is the leader of the generation called &#x201C;the head of the people,&#x201D; and the best of spices is called <italic>rosh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn641">8</xref></sup> Similarly, the conclusion of any matter is called <italic>akeiv</italic> (heel) as the Sacred Language adopts these figurative expressions from the human body; and thus &#x201C;the head&#x201D; is the beginning while &#x201C;the heel&#x201D; is the conclusion and end of the body. Scripture also speaks of <italic>the head</italic> and <italic>the tail</italic><sup><xref rid="fn642">9</xref></sup> [with reference to people], figuratively using the body of the animal.</p>
<p>And Onkelos rendered the word <italic>eikev</italic> as <italic>chalaf</italic> (&#x201C;in exchange for&#x201D;), like <italic>&#x2018;cheilef&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>in return for</italic>) <italic>your service</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn643">10</xref></sup> Onkelos thus made it an expression of &#x201C;roundabout&#x201D; [the end result of a series of events], derived from the verse, <italic>and &#x2018;he&#x2019;akov</italic> (<italic>the crooked</italic>) <italic>shall be made straight</italic><sup><xref rid="fn644">11</xref></sup> &#x2014; that is, the circuitous road which goes roundabout [will become a straight, level path]. So also <italic>&#x2018;akubah&#x2019; of blood</italic><sup><xref rid="fn645">12</xref></sup> means &#x201C;it is surrounded and encircled&#x201D; [with blood]. The verse here is thus stating [according to Onkelos]: &#x201C;and it shall come to pass that the effect caused by your hearkening to the ordinances and your performing them will be that G-d will keep His covenant with you.&#x201D; He has explained it well. A similar expression is <italic>&#x2018;biglal&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>for the sake of</italic>) <italic>this thing</italic><sup><xref rid="fn646">13</xref></sup> which means &#x201C;on account of,&#x201D; from the word <italic>&#x2019;v&#x2019;gal&#x2019;lu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and they roll</italic>) <italic>the stone</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn647">14</xref></sup> Similarly it is my opinion that every expression of <italic>akeivah</italic> is a term denoting &#x201C;circle&#x201D; or &#x201C;circuit.&#x201D; Thus: <italic>&#x2019;akov haleiv&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the heart is deceitful</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn648">15</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;vaya&#x2019;akveini&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and he hath gotten the better of me</italic>) <italic>these two times;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn649">16</xref></sup> <italic>but Jehu did it &#x2018;b&#x2019;akbah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>in subtlety</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn650">17</xref></sup> &#x2014; all these being expressions of &#x201C;rolling&#x201D; and &#x201C;circling.&#x201D; Therefore they called Jacob &#x201C;Jeshurun&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn651">18</xref></sup> [from the root <italic>yashar</italic> (straight and upright)] because the opposite of &#x201C;the deceitful one&#x201D; is he who is &#x201C;upright&#x201D; [as indicated by the name &#x201C;Jeshurun&#x201D;]. Similarly, the end-part of the foot, called <italic>akeiv</italic> &#x2014; as it is said, <italic>and his hand seizing &#x2018;ba&#x2019;akeiv</italic> (<italic>the heel</italic>) <italic>of Esau</italic><sup><xref rid="fn652">19</xref></sup> &#x2014; is so called because of its roundness, just as the [Sacred] Language calls the middle part [palm and sole] of the hand and foot <italic>kapoth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn653">20</xref></sup> because of their being shaped like golden <italic>kapoth</italic> (spoons). This usage [of the term <italic>akeiv</italic>] is common in the [Sacred] Language, just as the Rabbis have said in the Sifre:<sup><xref rid="fn654">21</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>At His right hand was a fiery law unto them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn655">22</xref></sup> When the word came forth from the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be He, it would go by way of the right hand of the Holy One to the left of Israel, <italic>v&#x2019;okeiv</italic> (and it encircled) the camp of Israel twelve miles by twelve miles.&#x201D; So also is the expression:<sup><xref rid="fn656">23</xref></sup> &#x201C;they come upon him <italic>ba&#x2019;akifin</italic>,&#x201D; meaning &#x201C;with circuitous and subtle arguments,&#x201D; like the word <italic>akeivin</italic> as these two letters [the <italic>veth</italic> and the <italic>fei</italic>] were considered by the Sages to be interchangeable, as I have already explained.<sup><xref rid="fn657">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>He mentioned <italic>these ordinances</italic><sup><xref rid="fn658">25</xref></sup> in order to warn exceedingly concerning the ordinances [i.e., judgments], for it is impossible that of a large nation, everyone be heedful of all commandments so as not to transgress any of them, and it is only through the judgments [of the court] that they establish [the firm authority of] the Torah, just as it says of them, <italic>and all Israel shall hear, and fear</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn659">26</xref></sup> Moreover, many people will have pity [and refrain from] stoning a man or burning him after the transgression had been committed, as it is said, <italic>Thine eye shall not pity him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn660">27</xref></sup> Then also they might fear the mighty ones as well as those who lead astray, as it is said, <italic>ye shall not be afraid of the face of any man, for the judgment is G-d&#x2019;s</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn661">28</xref></sup> and in the case of the false prophet it says, <italic>thou shalt not be afraid of him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn662">29</xref></sup> He mentioned all these in the case of an inciter [to worship idols] saying, <italic>thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shalt thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn663">30</xref></sup> warning <italic>nor hearken unto him</italic><sup><xref rid="fn663">30</xref></sup> because of his misleading [you], <italic>neither shalt thine eye pity him</italic><sup><xref rid="fn663">30</xref></sup> because of the pity that compassionate people show towards the condemned, and <italic>neither shalt thou conceal him</italic><sup><xref rid="fn663">30</xref></sup> by remaining silent [and not presenting testimony against him] because of his might and fear of members of his family.</p>
<p>13. &#x2018;VA&#x2019;AHEIVCHA&#x2019; (AND HE WILL LOVE THEE). The meaning thereof is that when you will observe the ordinances [i.e., the judgments] out of a love for G-d, He will love you as well. It is possible that <italic>va&#x2019;aheivcha</italic> is transitive, meaning that He will cause you to be beloved by the families of those judged [to punishment] and you will not be hated because of [what you have done to] them. <italic>And He will bless thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn664">31</xref></sup> that <italic>there shall no evil befall thee</italic><sup><xref rid="fn665">32</xref></sup> because of the judgment [you have rendered]. <italic>And He will multiply thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn664">31</xref></sup> that you will not be diminished because of the death of the transgressors, even if many are slain such as the people of an apostate city.<sup><xref rid="fn666">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. AND THE ETERNAL WILL TAKE AWAY FROM THEE ALL SICKNESS &#x2014; ordinary ailments which occur in the world. He further mentioned <italic>all the evil diseases of Egypt</italic> to assure the people that <italic>He will inflict them on all who hate thee</italic>. Or it may be that he is intimating that by observing the ordinances, they will be saved from them [these evil diseases], but if they do not observe them, they [the diseases] will come upon them just as they did come upon the Egyptians, as is stated in the chastisement: <italic>And He will bring back upon thee all the diseases of Egypt</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn667">34</xref></sup> I have already explained this in the section <italic>And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn668">35</xref></sup> Now he mentioned as the first among the ordinances, the duty to demolish and destroy the idol-worshippers.<sup><xref rid="fn669">36</xref></sup> Therefore he said, <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;achalta&#x2019;</italic> [literally: &#x201C;and thou shalt eat&#x201D;] <italic>all the peoples</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn669">36</xref></sup> meaning that you should destroy them, similar to what is said, <italic>for they are bread for us;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn670">37</xref></sup> <italic>for &#x2018;achal&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>he hath devoured</italic>) <italic>Jacob;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn671">38</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;va&#x2019;achaluhu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>yea, they have devoured him</italic>) <italic>and consumed him</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn672">39</xref></sup> and so also many similar expressions. He states <italic>thine eye shall not pity them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn669">36</xref></sup> as I have mentioned,<sup><xref rid="fn673">40</xref></sup> for, through [undue] pity of the judges all law will be destroyed.</p>
<p>22. THOU MAYEST NOT BE ABLE TO CONSUME THEM SPEEDILY. He is assuring them that G-d will destroy them all and send the hornet among them to destroy <italic>they that are left and they that hide themselves</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn674">41</xref></sup> and thus they will all [ultimately] perish. He states, however, that He will not completely destroy them in war in one day, nor will He <italic>drive them out</italic> of the Land <italic>in one year, lest the Land become desolate, and the beasts of the field multiply against thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn675">42</xref></sup> And He assured them further that those [of the peoples] that are left, will not be the majority, but that G-d <italic>shall confound them with a great confusion</italic><sup><xref rid="fn676">43</xref></sup> and most of them will be destroyed by the hand of Israel. And so he said, <italic>He will destroy them, and He will bring them down before thee; so shalt thou drive them out, and make them to perish quickly</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn677">44</xref></sup> [meaning] that you will destroy most of them quickly, but they will not be completely vanquished <italic>until thou be increased, and inherit the Land</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn678">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. AND HE SHALL DELIVER THEIR KINGS INTO THY HAND, AND THOU SHALT CAUSE THEIR NAME TO PERISH &#x2014; until they <italic>shall have no name abroad</italic><sup><xref rid="fn679">46</xref></sup> &#x2014; and the Israelites will destroy all who stand up to oppose them. This is similar to what is stated in the Book of Joshua, <italic>For it was of the Eternal to harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that they might be utterly destroyed</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn680">47</xref></sup> and not a king was left to them [the Canaanites] in the Land as all their kings fell [in battle].</p>
<p>And Rashi wrote: &#x201C;<italic>Lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn681">48</xref></sup> But is it not true that when they do His will [as the section begins: <italic>And it shall come to pass, because ye hearken to these ordinances</italic> etc.] they will have no fear of the beasts, as it is said, <italic>and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn682">49</xref></sup> But [this assurance is stated because] it was manifest before Him that they were destined to sin.&#x201D; These are the words of our Rabbis.<sup><xref rid="fn683">50</xref></sup> Now, even though this section is stated as a promise [and any reference to future sin apparently contradicts the principle of man&#x2019;s freedom of choice], I have already mentioned<sup><xref rid="fn684">51</xref></sup> that, in the Book of Deuteronomy, Moses our teacher both assures and warns. He alludes to the fact that their merits will not be sufficient to destroy all the people at once and for Him to <italic>cause evil beasts to cease out of the Land</italic><sup><xref rid="fn685">52</xref></sup> as promised to them in the section <italic>If ye walk in My statutes</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn686">53</xref></sup> Instead it will be as he said [here] that they will, in the first stage [of the conquest], destroy most of them together with their kings, and, afterwards, they that are left will be destroyed.</p>
<p>25. THOU SHALT NOT COVET THE SILVER OR THE GOLD ON THEM. The verse omits the word <italic>asher</italic> (which), [and the meaning is]: <italic>thou shalt not covet the silver or the gold</italic> which is <italic>on them</italic>, these being the ornaments of the idols. Thus he first commanded to burn the idol itself, this [being expressed in the statement] <italic>The graven images of their gods shall ye burn</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn687">54</xref></sup> and then he also prohibited the ornaments that are upon them. He further warned, <italic>And thou shalt not bring an abomination into thy house, lest thou be a doomed thing like it</italic><sup><xref rid="fn688">55</xref></sup> in order to prohibit benefit derived from any aspect of idol-worship &#x2014; the idol itself, its appurtenances, its offerings, and its ornaments.</p>
<h1>8</h1>
<p>1. ALL THE COMMANDMENT. The purport of it is to state: &#x201C;Although I have admonished you [specifically] with respect to <italic>the ordinances</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn689">56</xref></sup> <italic>all the</italic> [other] <italic>commandments shall ye observe to do</italic> also, for in observing all of them [the ordinances and the commandments] you will live and be fruitful in the fruit of the body, the fruit of the cattle, and the fruit of the ground,&#x201D; all as mentioned above.<sup><xref rid="fn690">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. AND THOU SHALT REMEMBER ALL THE WAY WHICH THE ETERNAL THY G-D HATH LED THEE etc. He is stating that you can realize that in the observance of the commandments is entailed the perfect good and there will not be <italic>the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn691">58</xref></sup> for G-d supported you in the wilderness with the performance of a great miracle because you followed after His commandments. I have already explained<sup><xref rid="fn692">59</xref></sup> in the section of the manna [the verse before us], <italic>that He might afflict thee, to try thee, to know what was in thy heart, whether thou wouldest keep His commandments, or no</italic>, for [the manna itself] was a great trial to them. They did not know what counsel to adopt for themselves when they entered the great wilderness, a place of no food, and they had none of the manna [in reserve because it could not be stored from day to day] but each day&#x2019;s portion came down on its day, <italic>and as the sun waxed hot, it melted</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn693">60</xref></sup> although they hungered mightily after it. All this they did to keep the commandment of G-d, to follow as He commanded. Now G-d could have led them through the [populated] cities that were around them, but instead He brought them into this trial [of never having any food in reserve] for He knew that as a result [of this experience] they would keep His commandments forever.</p>
<p>3. AND HE FED THEE WITH MANNA, WHICH THOU KNOWEST NOT, NEITHER DID THY FATHERS KNOW. The purport thereof is that you did not know about the manna that you could live by it for many years, nor did such a tradition reach you from your fathers. Or he [Moses] may be saying that He has done with you this great kindness which your holy fathers [i.e., the patriarchs] did not obtain, for, although they walked after Him wherever He commanded them, as is stated, <italic>Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father&#x2019;s house</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn694">61</xref></sup> yet their eminence did not suffice that He should support them with <italic>the corn of heaven</italic><sup><xref rid="fn695">62</xref></sup> as He did for you. And so the Rabbis have said in the Midrash Bamidbar Sinai Rabbah:<sup><xref rid="fn696">63</xref></sup> &#x201C;Because of the merit of Moses you ate the manna that your holy fathers did not see, as it is said, <italic>neither did thy fathers know</italic>.&#x201D; And he explained that He did this in order to inform them that it is He Who preserves man with whatever He decrees, and if so <italic>observe</italic> His <italic>commandments, and live</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn697">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is possible to explain that the expressions <italic>And He afflicted thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna</italic> refer to different subjects. He is stating that He afflicted you when you travelled in the wilderness for forty years, similar to the verse, <italic>He afflicted my strength in the way</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn698">65</xref></sup> [meaning that travel drains the strength]. <italic>And He suffered thee to hunger</italic>, at the beginning [of the journey in the wilderness] as the people said, <italic>to kill this whole assembly with hunger</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn699">66</xref></sup> and afterwards He fed you with the manna to make you aware that <italic>by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Eternal doth man live</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn700">67</xref></sup> So also, <italic>Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn701">68</xref></sup> telling them of the miracle that was done to them. And the expression <italic>that He might afflict thee</italic> [further in Verse 16] reverts to that which he said [in the preceding Verse 15], <italic>Who led thee through the great and dreadful wilderness, wherein were serpents, fiery serpents, and scorpions, and draught</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn702">69</xref></sup> But that which He said in the section of the manna, <italic>that I may, try them, whether they will walk in My law or not</italic><sup><xref rid="fn703">70</xref></sup> means that I will provide them their needs and fulfill their request and [then] see if they will hearken to Me <italic>when goods increase</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn704">71</xref></sup> This is in consonance with the plain meaning of Scripture, but the first interpretation is true and correct.</p>
<p>4. THY RAIMENT WAXED NOT OLD UPON THEE. &#x201C;The clouds of [Divine] Glory brushed their garments and pressed them so that they looked like freshly ironed articles; and so it was with their children, as they grew their garments grew with them.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language and also are the words of Agadah.<sup><xref rid="fn705">72</xref></sup> But Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote: &#x201C;Other scholars say that they took many garments out [of Egypt]. And it is possible that it was not in the nature of the manna to produce perspiration [thus enabling their garments to last so long]. And so also he stated that <italic>neither did thy feet swell</italic>, meaning that He gave them strength or that He led them slowly.&#x201D; But his [Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s] words are not correct, for Moses mentions this to them in order to say that upon observing the commandment [of G-d] they will have food and raiment, and renew [their] strength, even as they lived by the manna forty years and they had garments, <italic>and the way with</italic> their <italic>feet</italic> they <italic>treadeth not</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn706">73</xref></sup> All of this was miraculous, <italic>for by every thing that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Eternal doth man live</italic><sup><xref rid="fn700">67</xref></sup> and becomes supported. And if you were to cover a rafter with a new cloth it would wear out in forty years even though there is no perspiration, <italic>how much less man, that is a worm</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn707">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. AND THOU SHALT CONSIDER IN THY HEART, THAT, AS A MAN CHASTENETH HIS SON, placing upon him the yoke of instruction for his benefit, as it is said, <italic>Chasten thy son, for there is hope; but set not thy heart on his destruction</italic><sup><xref rid="fn708">75</xref></sup> &#x2014; SO THE ETERNAL THY G-D CHASTENETH THEE, at first with the affliction of the wilderness and the trial with the manna so that the goodness of the Land and its fruits should be pleasing to you. Therefore walk after Him, <italic>for the Eternal thy G-d bringeth thee into a good Land</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn709">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. A LAND OF BROOKS OF WATER. The meaning thereof is that it is <italic>like a watered garden</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn710">77</xref></sup> and it is not necessary to irrigate it by foot <italic>as the land of Egypt</italic>, as it will yet be stated,<sup><xref rid="fn711">78</xref></sup> for <italic>it drinketh water as the rain of heaven cometh down</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn712">79</xref></sup> Now he explained [here] that <italic>fountains and depths, come out in deep valleys and mountains</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn713">80</xref></sup> and from there the brooks flow in the Land, the purport of the verse being <italic>&#x201C;fountains and</italic> the fountains of <italic>the depths, &#x201D;</italic> like: <italic>when the &#x2018;fountains of the deep&#x2019; showed their might;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn714">81</xref></sup> <italic>the fountains of the great deep</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn715">82</xref></sup> The reason [for referring to both sources: fountains, and fountains of the deep] is that there are some fountains that flow from the very moisture of the mountains which has been absorbed by them from the rains, or from the clouds that ascend upon them, these being called &#x201C;fountains&#x201D; [or &#x201C;springs&#x201D;] as it is said, <italic>unto all the springs of water</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn716">83</xref></sup> <italic>the flint</italic> [He turned] <italic>into a fountain of waters</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn717">84</xref></sup> There are other kinds of fountains which come forth from the interior of the depth, these being called &#x201C;deep waters&#x201D; that is to say, the fountains of the depths. The verse is thus stating that both [kinds of fountains] <italic>come out in deep valleys and mountains</italic>.</p>
<p>9. A LAND WHOSE STONES ARE IRON. The meaning thereof is that in the place where you expect stones, you will find iron, for it will be mined from the dust thereof.<sup><xref rid="fn718">85</xref></sup> He thus brought them the joyful message that in the Land of Israel there is a quarry of copper and iron which are a great necessity for the inhabitants of the Land, and <italic>thou shalt not lack any thing in it</italic>. But [the absence of] a source of silver and gold<sup><xref rid="fn719">86</xref></sup> is no deficiency in a land. And in the Targum Yerushalmi I have seen it rendered: &#x201C;a Land whose stones are as bright as iron,&#x201D; meaning to say that Scripture is praising the Land because in it there will be found quarries of <italic>great stones, costly stones</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn720">87</xref></sup> hewn stones with which to build houses, walls, and towers, unlike the land of Egypt and many lands where people <italic>dwell in houses of clay</italic><sup><xref rid="fn721">88</xref></sup> and their houses may become their graves [from excessive rains].<sup><xref rid="fn722">89</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. AND THOU SHALT EAT AND BE SATISFIED, AND BLESS THE ETERNAL THY G-D FOR THE GOOD LAND. He is stating that when you remember the bondag in Egypt and the affliction in the wilderness, and you will eat and be satisfied in the good Land, you will bless G-d for it. And our Rabbis have received by tradition that this is a positive commandment,<sup><xref rid="fn723">90</xref></sup> its meaning thus being, &#x201C;and <italic>you shall bless</italic> the Eternal your G-d.&#x201D; Similarly, <italic>then thou shalt make a parapet for thy roof;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn724">91</xref></sup> <italic>and thou shalt keep the Passover;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn725">92</xref></sup> <italic>and thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the ground</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn726">93</xref></sup> and so also many similar verses [which appear to be mere optional, but are, nevertheless, interpreted as positive commandments]. The meaning of the expression <italic>for the good Land</italic> is &#x201C;and for the good Land;&#x201D; that is, He commands that you are to bless Him at all times for the food you eat to satisfaction, and for the Land that He gave you in order that you might have it forever as an inheritance and be satisfied with its goodness. Thus the obligatory nature of this commandment is in all places [i.e., even outside of the Land of Israel, since the commandment to bless Him for the food we eat is independent of the duty to bless Him for the Land He has given us].</p>
<p>18. AND THOU SHALT REMEMBER THE ETERNAL THY G-D, FOR IT IS HE WHO GIVETH THEE POWER TO GET WEALTH. It is known that Israelites are mighty men, <italic>valiant men for the war</italic><sup><xref rid="fn727">94</xref></sup> because they were likened to lions<sup><xref rid="fn728">95</xref></sup> and to a ravenous wolf,<sup><xref rid="fn729">96</xref></sup> and they vanquished the Canaanite kings in battle. Therefore he said, &#x201C;If you should think, &#x2018;<italic>my power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth</italic>,&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn730">97</xref></sup> you should remember G-d Who brought you forth from Egypt where you had no power or might of hand at all. You should further remember that He provided all your needs for you in the wilderness, where you had <italic>nought in the power of thy hand</italic><sup><xref rid="fn731">98</xref></sup> to survive. If so [concerning] this wealth which you have won by your strength as well, [you should bear in mind that] it is G-d Who gave you the power [that was necessary for you] to accumulate the wealth; and if you forget G-d He will consume <italic>thy flesh and thy body</italic><sup><xref rid="fn732">99</xref></sup> and you will perish,<sup><xref rid="fn733">100</xref></sup> just as [the nations before you] perished,<sup><xref rid="fn734">101</xref></sup> for all that <italic>forsake the Eternal shall be consumed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn735">102</xref></sup></p>
<p>And then Moses reverted to bring yet another proof that you should not think &#x2018;<italic>my power and the might of my hand</italic> etc.,&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn730">97</xref></sup> and he said <italic>Hear, O Israel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn736">103</xref></sup> a true word from my mouth, that <italic>these nations are greater and mightier than thyself</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn736">103</xref></sup> and how will you vanquish them in battle? Besides, they have <italic>cities great and fortified up to</italic> the high <italic>heavens</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn736">103</xref></sup> and how will you capture them? Moreover, there is <italic>a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom thou knowest</italic><sup><xref rid="fn737">104</xref></sup> from the spies who saw them, <italic>and of whom thou hast heard</italic><sup><xref rid="fn737">104</xref></sup> from days of yore that no man can stand up against them. And when all this becomes clear to you, you should realize and believe from this day on that you will be unable to go over [the Jordan to do battle] before them at all until you know in your heart <italic>that the Eternal thy G-d is He Who goeth over before thee as a devouring fire</italic>, and <italic>He will destroy them, and He will bring them down</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn738">105</xref></sup> It is not the power and the might of hand He gave you, but the hand of G-d that did this to the mighty ones among them. This is an allusion to what is stated, <italic>and the Eternal cast down great stones from heaven upon them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn739">106</xref></sup> and similarly it is said there, <italic>And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the Eternal hearkened unto the voice of a man; for the Eternal fought for Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn740">107</xref></sup> The reference to the fortified cities he mentioned here<sup><xref rid="fn736">103</xref></sup> is an allusion to the wall of Jericho that fell before the ark. This is what David said, <italic>For not by their own sword did they get the Land in possession, neither did their own arm save them; but Thy right hand, and Thine arm, and the light of Thy countenance, because Thou wast favorable unto them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn741">108</xref></sup> &#x2014; <italic>the right hand</italic> of G-d <italic>and</italic> His [left] <italic>arm</italic> fought against their mighty ones, <italic>and the light of</italic> His <italic>countenance</italic> that <italic>was favorable unto them</italic> [the Israelites] gave them power over those who were slain in battle. Scripture refers to this in saying further, <italic>And I destroyed the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn742">109</xref></sup> He [the prophet Amos] singled out the Amorite because it was the mightiest [nation] among them, and it was G-d Who destroyed it.</p>
<h1>9</h1>
<p>3. HE WILL DESTROY THEM, AND HE WILL BRING THEM DOWN. The meaning thereof is that &#x201C;He will bring them down and He will destroy them&#x201D; [because, obviously, they could be destroyed after having been brought down, but not vice versa]. The expression <italic>&#x2018;yachni&#x2019;eim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>He will bring them down</italic>) denotes &#x201C;humiliation,&#x201D; as in the usage, <italic>Seest thou how Ahab &#x2018;nichna&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>humbleth himself</italic>) <italic>before Me</italic>?;<sup><xref rid="fn743">110</xref></sup> <italic>if then perchance their uncircumcised heart &#x2018;yikana&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>be humbled</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn744">111</xref></sup> and so all [similar expressions]. And the purport thereof is that these peoples were very frightened of Israel. With <italic>a trembling heart</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn745">112</xref></sup> low spirit and <italic>feebleness of hands</italic><sup><xref rid="fn746">113</xref></sup> they went out [against them in battle], as it is stated, <italic>And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, that were by the sea, heard how the Eternal had dried up the waters of the Jordan</italic> etc. <italic>that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn747">114</xref></sup> It is possible that the expression <italic>He will destroy them</italic> alludes to <italic>the nations greater and mightier than thyself</italic><sup><xref rid="fn748">115</xref></sup> &#x2014; <italic>and He will bring them down</italic> refers to <italic>the sons of the Anakim</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn749">116</xref></sup> for despite all their might and height, their hearts were more humbled than [those of] the rest of the people and they did not go into battle at all, but were hiding in the mountains and in the fortified cities, as it is said, <italic>And Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the hill-country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the hill-country of Judah, and from all the hill-country of Israel; &#x2018;with&#x2019; their cities Joshua utterly destroyed them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn750">117</xref></sup> that is to say he destroyed them &#x201C;in&#x201D; their cities [indicating that the Anakim never entered the battlefield]. Similarly, it is said, <italic>And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron</italic> etc. <italic>and they smote Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn751">118</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. SPEAK NOT THOU IN THY HEART. After cautioning that you should not think &#x2018;<italic>my power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth</italic>.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn752">119</xref></sup> but instead you are to know that the power over the vanquished was given to you by G-d, and that [the victory over] their mighty ones and fortified cities that you will have conquered [was made possible by] G-d in His Glory Who did it for you in a generally known miracle from Him, he further warned them, &#x201C;Do not think that G-d did all this for you because of your righteousness; rather, He has done so for you only <italic>because of the wickedness of these nations</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn753">120</xref></sup> Now this is a cause for the destruction of these nations, but he gave no reason for Israel&#x2019;s possession of the Land. Therefore he reverted and explained, <italic>Not for thy righteousness</italic><sup><xref rid="fn753">120</xref></sup> that you will be righteous in conduct, nor even because of the upright heart that you will have, but only <italic>because of the wickedness of these nations</italic> will they be destroyed, and because of [His] oath to your fathers will you possess the Land, for your sin cannot annul the gift He gave to your fathers since He gave it to them by an oath. And Rashi wrote: &#x201C;<italic>Speak not thou in thy heart</italic> &#x2014; my righteousness and the wickedness of these nations caused me [to possess the Land]. <italic>Not for thy righteousness</italic>.&#x201D; But this is not correct.<sup><xref rid="fn754">121</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now one should ask, &#x201C;Has he not said, <italic>But because the Eternal loved you</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn755">122</xref></sup> thus establishing that they are beloved on high, and, [as we know], G-d loves only those who are good, for <italic>the wicked and him that loveth violence His soul hateth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn756">123</xref></sup> and if so, [it is justifiable that] they come to possess the Land also for their [own] righteousness [so, how can he say here <italic>Not for thy righteousness, etc.</italic>]?&#x201D; The answer is that there he speaks of Israel in general, and here he reproves that particular generation that has been rebellious against the Eternal from the day they were in the wilderness.</p>
<p>5. AND THAT HE MAY ESTABLISH THE WORD WHICH THE ETERNAL SWORE UNTO THY FATHERS. The purport thereof<sup><xref rid="fn757">124</xref></sup> is that He had said <italic>and they shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn758">125</xref></sup> <italic>And in the fourth generation they shall come back hither</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn759">126</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. ALSO IN HOREB YE MADE THE ETERNAL ANGRY. Before even beginning to explain to them the Torah, he [Moses] reproved them for the sins which caused them evil and which were not forgiven: he mentioned the affairs of the spies, and the waters of Meribah. Afterwards he explained the Ten Commandments and the section of the Unity of G-d [<italic>Sh&#x2019;ma</italic>], and he admonished them with many exhortations against idolatry; he cautioned them concerning the commandments in general, and he said that they [the commandments] are all good and, in consequence of [observing them] all the good will come to them, and then he commences to explain the individual commandments. But before he mentioned any of the commandments specifically he returned to reprove them and to <italic>visit upon</italic> them <italic>all</italic> their <italic>iniquities</italic><sup><xref rid="fn760">127</xref></sup> which they had committed from the time they received the Torah and henceforth. But the complaints they made before the Giving of the Torah &#x2014; when they <italic>were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn761">128</xref></sup> <italic>and the people murmured</italic> at Marah,<sup><xref rid="fn762">129</xref></sup> and in Alush<sup><xref rid="fn763">130</xref></sup> &#x2014; he did not mention to them, because, from the time that they received the Torah, they were more obligated to hearken to the voice of G-d Who made a covenant with them. Therefore, he began here, <italic>Also in Horeb ye made the Eternal angry</italic>, and he mentioned to them the affair of the [golden] calf, which I have already explained.<sup><xref rid="fn764">131</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. SO I TURNED AND CAME DOWN FROM THE MOUNT. I have already explained in its place<sup><xref rid="fn765">132</xref></sup> that before Moses came down from the mountain [and burned the calf] he prayed for them,<sup><xref rid="fn766">133</xref></sup> and, as a result of his prayer, it was said to him, <italic>And the Eternal repented of the evil which He said He would do unto His people</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn767">134</xref></sup> Now, however, he did not mention it because he wanted to give them a [general] review of the great burden and suffering that he undertook for their sake &#x2014; that they caused him to break the Tablets, to pray for them forty days and forty nights, and also to pray on behalf of Aaron because G-d was very angry with him.<sup><xref rid="fn768">135</xref></sup> Afterwards he mentioned the first supplication<sup><xref rid="fn769">136</xref></sup> with which he [immediately] before he came down from the mountain <italic>besought the face of the Eternal his G-d</italic><sup><xref rid="fn770">137</xref></sup> not to destroy them.</p>
<p>17. AND I TOOK HOLD OF THE TWO TABLETS. This is also meant to be part of the chastisements. He is saying: &#x201C;your sin was greater than could be borne,<sup><xref rid="fn771">138</xref></sup> to the point that when I saw you being merry before the calf I could not restrain [my anger] and I broke the Tablets.&#x201D; He had to mention this because he wanted them to realize the significance of the second Tablets, as he will explain [in the section that follows]. Possibly he is alluding further to the favor he did them when he endangered his own life by breaking the Tablets of G-d for their sake, as our Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn772">139</xref></sup> &#x201C;It is better that you [Israel] be judged like an [unchaste] unmarried woman and not like an [adulterous] wife.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn773">140</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. FOR I WAS IN DREAD OF THE ANGER. He is stating that because <italic>of the anger and the fury wherewith the Eternal was angry with you</italic> at first [that He wanted] <italic>to destroy you</italic>, I stood in awe even now, for there was still [enough] of that great anger upon you to destroy you, even though G-d had already <italic>repented of the evil which He said He would do unto His people</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn767">134</xref></sup> Therefore I returned and threw myself down [in prayer] in your behalf for forty days and forty nights until He <italic>hearkened unto me that time also</italic><sup><xref rid="fn774">141</xref></sup> just as He hearkened the first time before I descended [from the mountain]. For Aaron, also, I prayed at that time when I returned there [to the mountain] because, until he had cleansed [the camp of] the calf, [Moses&#x2019; main] concern was but <italic>to turn back His wrath, lest He should destroy</italic><sup><xref rid="fn775">142</xref></sup> the [whole] people in a moment, [and hence he did not pray especially for Aaron until he returned to the mountain].</p>
<p>21. AND I CAST THE DUST THEREOF INTO THE BROOK THAT DESCENDED OUT OF THE MOUNT. He did not mention that he made them drink [of the water mixed with the dust of the calf]<sup><xref rid="fn776">143</xref></sup> by way of humiliating them for their deeds,<sup><xref rid="fn777">144</xref></sup> because he did not want to tell them that he had done to them what is done to wives suspected of adultery.<sup><xref rid="fn778">145</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote that the meaning of the verse, <italic>And at Taberah, and at Massah</italic> etc.,<sup><xref rid="fn779">146</xref></sup> is that because at Taberah <italic>the people were as murmerers</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn780">147</xref></sup> testing G-d with complaints, therefore Moses mentioned to them that &#x201C;you angered G-d with the challenge of proving [His power] at Taberah just as you had already done another time at Massah<sup><xref rid="fn781">148</xref></sup> and you accepted no correction.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn782">149</xref></sup> He [Ibn Ezra] explained it well. Behold, the sin of testing G-d is a great sin and of a serious nature, as he admonished against it, <italic>Ye shall not try the Eternal your G-d, as ye tried Him in Massah;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn783">150</xref></sup> therefore he cited it to them again here. So also he briefly mentioned to them once again the sin of the spies<sup><xref rid="fn784">151</xref></sup> because of the great sin it entailed, for with it he completed [this section], saying, <italic>Ye have been rebellious against the Eternal from the day I knew you</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn785">152</xref></sup> He stated <italic>from the day I knew you</italic> in order to allude to their murmurings before the Giving of the Torah</italic>.</p>
<p>25. AND I FELL DOWN BEFORE THE ETERNAL. He is stating: &#x201C;I had to cast myself down in prayer for you forty days and forty nights because of this great sin, for at first G-d said to destroy you, until I prayed to G-d and said &#x2018;[<italic>O G-d Eternal</italic>], <italic>destroy not Thy people and Thine inheritance</italic>.&#x2019; &#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn786">153</xref></sup> This was his prayer before he came down from the mountain, and it was because of this prayer that he was answered with <italic>And the Eternal repented of the evil which He said He would do unto His people</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn767">134</xref></sup> He did not mention the prayer of the forty days and forty nights, for <italic>the measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn787">154</xref></sup> I have already explained<sup><xref rid="fn788">155</xref></sup> the reason why the Divine Names are written both with <italic>Aleph Daleth</italic>, and <italic>Yod Hei</italic> [in Verse 26: <italic>O G-d Eternal, destroy not Thy people</italic> etc.].</p>
<p>28. BECAUSE THE ETERNAL WAS NOT ABLE TO BRING THEM INTO THE LAND WHICH HE PROMISED THEM. During the affair of the spies, Moses said, [that the nations will say] <italic>Because the Eternal was not able to bring this people into the Land which He swore unto them, therefore He hath slain them in the wilderness</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn789">156</xref></sup> meaning, they [the nations] will say that as they [the Israelites] approached and were near to the Land, and He saw that He was not able to be victorious over those nations He slew them [the Israelites] in the wilderness. But here [with reference to the calf] he [Moses] said [that the Egyptians would claim], <italic>and because He hated them, He hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn790">157</xref></sup> since this hatred already existed in Egypt before He took them out from there. The purport of this was that, since at the time when the calf was made, they were still close to Egypt and far from the land of Canaan, the Egyptians would claim that even when they were still in Egypt, He realized that He lacked the power to bring them into the Land of which He spoke to them within hearing of the Egyptians. Therefore He hated them <italic>that it</italic> [His Name] <italic>should not be profaned in the sight of the nations</italic><sup><xref rid="fn791">158</xref></sup> in whose sight He made Himself known to them [the Israelites]. He brought them forth out of the land of Egypt <italic>to slay them in the wilderness</italic><sup><xref rid="fn790">157</xref></sup> in a place where their fate would not become known. This is the intent of the verse, [<italic>Why should the Egyptians speak, saying:</italic>] <italic>for evil did He bring them forth, to slay them in the mountains?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn792">159</xref></sup> meaning, that He planned this evil design against them before He brought them out from among the people of Egypt to slay them between the mountains, a place <italic>that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn793">160</xref></sup> The point of these arguments was that the nations would speak of the Eternal, the G-d of Israel, [in a manner as they speak of other gods], <italic>speaking against Him</italic> [<italic>saying:</italic>] &#x2018;<italic>As the gods of the nations of the lands</italic>,&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn794">161</xref></sup> similar to what is stated, <italic>and now I will return to fight with the prince of Persia</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn795">162</xref></sup> I have already mentioned something of this subject.<sup><xref rid="fn796">163</xref></sup></p>
<h1>10</h1>
<p>1. AT THAT TIME THE ETERNAL SAID UNTO ME: &#x2018;HEW THEE TWO TABLETS OF STONE.&#x2019; After I cast myself down in prayer before G-d for forty days and forty nights, He was reconciled with me that He would write the second Tablets. However, the first ones <italic>were the work of G-d, and the writing was the writing of G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn797">164</xref></sup> whereas these [second Tablets] He commanded me that they be hewn by my hands and the writing will be like the writing on the first ones, <italic>by the finger of G-d</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn798">165</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND MAKE THEE AN ARK OF WOOD. The meaning thereof is that you put the Tablets into this ark when you descend [the mountain]. Now this ark, including its cover, is to be entirely from wood [and not overlaid with gold], like all arks, and the Tablets should remain there until the Tabernacle is made. [Only] then, they made the ark which was covered with gold and the ark-cover upon it of pure gold.<sup><xref rid="fn799">166</xref></sup> He did not tell Moses [to make an ark] for the first Tablets because it was manifest before Him that he would break them [immediately upon coming down the mountain]. And the meaning of the verse, <italic>and there they were, as the Eternal commanded me</italic><sup><xref rid="fn800">167</xref></sup> is that the Tablets were there [in the ark] until the Tabernacle was made concerning which He commanded me, <italic>And thou shalt put the ark-cover above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the Testimony that I shall give thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn801">168</xref></sup> This is the good and correct [interpretation] of these verses.</p>
<p>And Rashi wrote: &#x201C;Now, this was not the ark which Bezalel made [for the Tabernacle], because they did not occupy themselves in the making of the Tabernacle until after the Day of Atonement, for it was only when he came down from the mountain that he commanded them concerning the construction of the Tabernacle, and it was Bezalel who made, first the Tabernacle, and afterwards the ark<sup><xref rid="fn802">169</xref></sup> and the vessels. Thus it follows that this [ark mentioned here] was a different one, and it was this [ark] that went forth with them to battle, while the one that Bezalel made did not go forth to battle except in the days of Eli<sup><xref rid="fn803">170</xref></sup> and they were punished for this and it was captured [by the Philistines].&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn804">171</xref></sup> This is the Rabbi&#x2019;s language, quoting words of Agadah which he found written in the Tanchuma.<sup><xref rid="fn805">172</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now one may ask: &#x201C;And after they removed the Tablets from this ark and placed them in the ark which Bezalel made, what happened to this ark? And why did this one go forth with the people to battle [since it was empty, the Tablets having been removed]?&#x201D; Some say that the broken Tablets lay in that ark, and so in fact it is found in the Agadah, but these are the words of a single Sage, for thus we learned in Tractate Shekalim:<sup><xref rid="fn806">173</xref></sup> &#x201C;We are taught [in a Beraitha]: Rabbi Yehudah the son of Rabbi Ilai says: Israel had two arks in the wilderness, one in which the broken Tablets lay etc. But the Rabbis say: there was only one, and once it went forth [to battle] in the days of Eli and it was captured [by the Philistines].&#x201D; The opinion of our Rabbis throughout the Talmud is also not so [that there were two arks]; but that [both] the whole Tablets and the broken Tablets lay in the [same] ark. Besides, where was this ark containing the first [broken] Tablets to stay all the years in the wilderness? For in the Tabernacle, in the Holy of Holies beyond the Veil, there were no two arks, and Solomon also brought but one ark into the Holy of Holies [of the Sanctuary]&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn807">174</xref></sup> Rather, [we must say] that this ark of Moses was stored away upon the completion of the ark of Bezalel, as is the law of implements of holiness [which must be stored away after having served their purpose].<sup><xref rid="fn808">175</xref></sup></p>
<p>This is the correct interpretation in accordance with the opinion of our Rabbis, for, in line with the plain meaning of Scripture, it is possible that the verse here, <italic>and make thee an ark of wood</italic>, refers to the ark which Bezalel made. This [could be explained as follows]: First Moses was commanded regarding the making of the Tabernacle and its vessels, the first command being <italic>And they shall make an ark of acacia-wood</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn809">176</xref></sup> for this [to contain the Tablets] was the main purpose of the entire Tabernacle &#x2014; that the Eternal <italic>that sitteth upon the cherubim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn810">177</xref></sup> be there. Afterwards they made the calf and when G-d was reconciled with Moses and told him that He would write on these Tablets <italic>according to the first writing</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn811">178</xref></sup> He commanded him briefly that he should make for these [second] Tablets an ark of wood, this being the same one concerning which he was commanded for the first Tablets. Thus He mentioned to Moses [as narrated by Moses in the verse before us] the primary commandment regarding the Tabernacle, and [the one] upon which everything depended. It was from this [charge to build the ark] that Moses deduced [that he was] to make the Tabernacle and its vessels, as he had been commanded earlier. And in that case the interpretation of the phrase, <italic>and there they were, as the Eternal command me</italic><sup><xref rid="fn800">167</xref></sup> is that they be there forever <italic>as the Eternal commanded me</italic> originally: <italic>and in the ark thou shalt put the Testimony that I shall give thee. And there I will meet with thee, and I will speak with thee</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn812">179</xref></sup> Now when Moses came down from the mountain he placed the Tablets in [his personal] tent of meeting<sup><xref rid="fn813">180</xref></sup> until he made the ark and the Tabernacle.<sup><xref rid="fn814">181</xref></sup> For had he not broken the first Tablets, they would have been in [his] tent of meeting<sup><xref rid="fn813">180</xref></sup> until Bezalel had made the ark. And so perforce we must also say that the broken tablets were there [in his tent of meeting], for he did not return them with him when he ascended the mountain. Proof for this [i.e., that the command for making the ark mentioned here is identical with the command mentioned in the Book of Exodus with the instructions to build the Tabernacle] is the fact that Moses did not mention this command in the section of <italic>Ki Thisa</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn815">182</xref></sup> for there He mentioned the ark of Bezalel expressly.<sup><xref rid="fn816">183</xref></sup> Now here he did not mention the Tabernacle and its vessels for the people saw it before them, and therefore he mentioned it only briefly [through the first command concerning the ark].</p>
<p>Now, do not consider it difficult that he said, <italic>So I made an ark of acacia-wood, and hewed two Tablets of stone</italic><sup><xref rid="fn817">184</xref></sup> [which would seem to indicate that Moses made the ark at once and then hewed the two Tablets of stone, and, if so, this could not be the ark of Bezalel], for he completed the narration of the subject of the ark at one time. For G-d had commanded him, <italic>Hew thee two Tablets of stone</italic> etc., <italic>and come up unto Me into the mount; and make thee an ark of wood</italic>, meaning that he should first come up with the Tablets and afterwards he should make an ark of wood; but He prolonged [the subject of the Tablets] in order to say, <italic>And I will write on the Tablets the words that were on the first Tablets which thou didst break, and thou shalt put them in the ark</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn818">185</xref></sup> that is to say that these second Tablets will be identical to the first ones in writing and, therefore, it is proper that they, like the first ones, be in the [previously] commanded ark, where <italic>I will meet with the children of Israel, and it shall be sanctified by My glory</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn819">186</xref></sup> Therefore Moses finished the account by stating, <italic>So I made an ark</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn817">184</xref></sup> in order to briefly complete the commandment and the deed. Afterwards he returned to speak at length on the subject mentioned before.</p>
<p>5. AND I TURNED AND CAME DOWN FROM THE MOUNT, AND PUT THE TABLETS IN THE ARK WHICH I MADE. The meaning thereof is &#x201C;which I made at the time I came down from the mountain.&#x201D; <italic>And there they were</italic> forever, <italic>as the Eternal commanded me</italic>, that His Glory dwell among the children of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn820">187</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL JOURNEYED FROM BEEROTH-BENE-YAAKAN TO MOSERAH. &#x201C;Why does this matter belong here? Furthermore, did they indeed journey from Beeroth-bene-yaakan to Moserah; did they not come from Moserah to Bene-yaakan, as it is said, <italic>And they journeyed from Moseroth, and pitched in Bene-yaakan</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn821">188</xref></sup> And further, here it is said, <italic>there</italic> [in Moserah] <italic>Aaron died</italic>; but did he not die in Mount Hor?<sup><xref rid="fn822">189</xref></sup> Go and count and you will find that there are eight journeys from Moseroth to Mount Hor&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn823">190</xref></sup> But really this is also part of the reproof [spoken by Moses, saying in effect]: &#x2018;This also you did; When Aaron died in Mount Hor at the end of forty years [after the exodus] and the clouds of Divine Glory departed, you feared war with the king of Arad<sup><xref rid="fn824">191</xref></sup> and you appointed a leader to return to Egypt and you turned backwards eight journeys until Bene-yaakan and from there [you continued] to Moserah [as stated here]. There the children of Levi fought you and slew some of you, and you [slew] some of them, until they forced you back the road [along which you had retreated]. From there [Moserah] you returned to Gudgod<sup><xref rid="fn825">192</xref></sup> which is identical with Hor-hagidgad,<sup><xref rid="fn826">193</xref></sup> <italic>and from Gudgod</italic> to Moserah.<sup><xref rid="fn827">194</xref></sup> And at Moserah you made a great lamentation on account of the death of Aaron which brought this [retreat and subsequent battle with the Levites] upon you, and it [the sadness] was as if Aaron had died there [thus accounting for the verse which states: <italic>there</italic> &#x2014; at Moserah &#x2014; <italic>Aaron died</italic>]&#x0021;&#x2019; Now Moses placed this reproof next to the [narrative about the] breaking of the Tablets in order to intimate that the death of the righteous is as grievous before the Holy One, blessed be He, as was the day on which the Tablets were broken, and to inform you that it was displeasing to Him what they said <italic>Let us make a captain</italic> [<italic>and return to Egypt</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn828">195</xref></sup> in order to break away from Him, as was the day when they made the calf. <italic>At that time the Eternal separated the tribe of Levi</italic><sup><xref rid="fn829">196</xref></sup> &#x2014; this refers back to the first subject [of this chapter]. <italic>At that time</italic>, in the first year of your departure from Egypt when you sinned by worshipping the calf, but the sons of Levi did not sin, G-d separated them from you. This event is placed next to the retreat to Bene-yaakan [where, as explained earlier, the Levites showed faith and heroism] in order to intimate that in this matter, also, the sons of Levi did not sin but stood steadfast in their faith.&#x201D; All this is the language of our Rabbi Shlomo [Rashi] from the words of Agadah.<sup><xref rid="fn830">197</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now, Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra, [in order not to deviate from the literal meaning of the text by saying that they retreated backwards eight stages] found it necessary to say by way of the plain meaning of Scripture that &#x201C;Beeroth-bene-yaakan [mentioned in the verse before us: <italic>and the children of Israel journeyed from Beeroth-bene-yaakan to Moserah</italic>] is not identical with Bene-yaakan [mentioned in Numbers 33:31] and Moserah [mentioned here] is not Moseroth [mentioned in Numbers 33:30], but Kadesh<sup><xref rid="fn831">198</xref></sup> is called Beeroth-bene-yaakan,<sup><xref rid="fn832">199</xref></sup> and the name of the wilderness where Aaron died is Mount Hor-moserah [so that there is no need to say that they retreated back toward Egypt]. <italic>From thence they journeyed unto Gudgod</italic><sup><xref rid="fn833">200</xref></sup> is not identical with Hor-hagidgad<sup><xref rid="fn826">193</xref></sup> but instead is a general name for Zalmonah, Punon, and Oboth,<sup><xref rid="fn834">201</xref></sup> while Jotbah<sup><xref rid="fn833">200</xref></sup> is the place called B&#x2019;eir,<sup><xref rid="fn835">202</xref></sup> this being the purport of the expression [here in Verse 7 describing Jotbah as] <italic>a land of brooks of water</italic> [and in B&#x2019;eir was the well, whereof the Eternal said unto Moses: &#x2018;<italic>Gather the people together, and I will give them water</italic>&#x2019;].<sup><xref rid="fn835">202</xref></sup> And the expression, <italic>and from Gudgod to Jotbah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn833">200</xref></sup> is connected with the phrase [in Verse 6 before us], <italic>and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest&#x2019;s office in his</italic> [Aaron&#x2019;s] <italic>stead</italic>, for it was there in Jotbah that Eleazar began ministering as the High Priest and performed the offerings.&#x201D; [Thus far is Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s language.]</p>
<p>But all these are <italic>windy words</italic><sup><xref rid="fn836">203</xref></sup> [i.e., words devoid of substance]. For how is it possible for all these many places to be new locations that have not been referred to in the section [enumerating all] of the journeys [of Israel from Egypt to the promised Land].<sup><xref rid="fn837">204</xref></sup> Moreover, it is the custom of Scripture everywhere to make slight changes when mentioning names a second time, whether it is the name of a place or the name of a person [so that even slightly different names would refer to the same place or person] and surely here, when the names are alike, for between Moserah and Moseroth there is no [significant] change or difference; similarly, Hor-hagidgad and Gudgod are one name, and Jotbah [mentioned here and in Numbers 33:34] are surely alike. Furthermore, it was in <italic>Mount Hor</italic> that Eleazar ministered upon the death of his father [Aaron] when Moses clothed him in the garments [of the High Priest],<sup><xref rid="fn838">205</xref></sup> for he was immediately distinguished [as a High Priest simply] by virtue of [being clothed in] the larger number of official garments [of the High Priest], this being the law of the High Priests even during succeeding generations&#x0021; [Hence there is no justification for Ibn Ezra to say that Eleazar ministered as a High Priest in Jotbah for the first time.]</p>
<p>The correct interpretation appears to me to be that Mount Hor is the largest of the mountains and is many parasangs long.<sup><xref rid="fn839">206</xref></sup> Its name [<italic>Hor Hahar</italic> &#x2014; literally: &#x201C;the mount of the mount&#x201D;] so indicates, for it is called &#x201C;mount&#x201D; and people called it &#x201C;<italic>the</italic> mountain&#x201D; because of its height and length. And so our Rabbis said that this was a mount on top of a mount.<sup><xref rid="fn840">207</xref></sup> The end of the mountain extended as far as the border of the land of Edom<sup><xref rid="fn841">208</xref></sup> and the beginning of it was near Hashmonah<sup><xref rid="fn842">209</xref></sup> [eight stages away from Mount Hor proper].<sup><xref rid="fn843">210</xref></sup> Now in the plain before Mount Hor there were cities or places called Moseroth, Bene-yaakan, Hor-hagidgad, Jotbah, Abronah, Ezion-geber, and Kadesh.<sup><xref rid="fn843">210</xref></sup> There was no great distance between these places, for that large camp [of the Israelites] walked in one day about a parasang<sup><xref rid="fn839">206</xref></sup> or less. From Kadesh <italic>they journeyed, and pitched in Mount Hor</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn844">211</xref></sup> entering a low place at the foot of the mount. Then G-d commanded Moses, <italic>Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto Mount Hor</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn845">212</xref></sup> meaning that he is to climb upward to the top of it [the lower part of the mountain] which is the beginning of the [upper part of the] mountain. Thus they ascended to the top of the mountain, arriving [at the part] opposite Moseroth, and Aaron died there, this being the intent of the verse, <italic>and Aaron died there &#x2018;in the top of the mount,&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn846">213</xref></sup> and thus his death [is also described in the verse before us as having] occurred in Moserah. It is possible that all these places as named were considered as if they were [also] on the mountain itself, so that the summit of the mountain and its opposite site in the plain were called &#x201C;Moseroth&#x201D; [in the plural] and the name of each place separately was &#x201C;Moserah&#x201D; [in the singular] so that people spoke of &#x201C;Moserah in the mount&#x201D; and &#x201C;Moserah in the plain.&#x201D; And in the place called Hashmonah there were wells in the field, which people referred to as <italic>Beeroth</italic> (&#x201C;The wells of) <italic>bene-yaakan</italic>&#x201D; because the inhabitants of Bene-yaakan came there to water their flocks and they made these wells, for there they found running water. And from there [from Beeroth-bene-yaakan] they journeyed to Moserah [as is mentioned in Verse 6 before us], and from there they journeyed to Moseroth,<sup><xref rid="fn842">209</xref></sup> <italic>and they journeyed from Moseroth, and pitched in Bene-yaakan</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn847">214</xref></sup> for that [i.e., Bene-yaakan] was the name of that place.<sup><xref rid="fn848">215</xref></sup> And Scripture continues to tell [here in Verse 7], <italic>From thence they journeyed unto Gudgod; and from Gudgod to Jotbah, a land of brooks of water</italic> in order to inform us that they stayed there [many] days on account of the brooks. It abbreviates [in listing] the journeys because it has already explained them [in the section on the journeys],<sup><xref rid="fn837">204</xref></sup> but it states that <italic>from thence</italic> &#x2014; from Moserah &#x2014; <italic>they journeyed unto Gudgod</italic> and unto Jotbah which was all <italic>a land of brooks of water</italic>, for from Gudgod to Jotbah <italic>was well watered everywhere</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn849">216</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is further possible that we say that when Aaron went up to the top of the mountain and died there opposite Moseroth or in Moserah itself [as explained above that the top of the mountain was also called Moserah] and he was buried there, the Israelites went back to Moseroth [i.e., to &#x201C;Moserah&#x201D; at the foot of the mountain, mentioned here in Verse 6 before us] to weep and to mourn at the <italic>grave of the man of G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn850">217</xref></sup> and, for the entire thirty days [of mourning]<sup><xref rid="fn851">218</xref></sup> their prominent men would go up to the top of the mountain and mourn for <italic>the holy one of the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn852">219</xref></sup> and then they would return to the camp which was pitched in Moserah. After the thirty days [of mourning] they journeyed from Moserah to Hor-hagidgad, and from Gudgod to Jotbah [as stated here in Verse 7], for now, as they returned from Moserah, they travelled quickly [and did not stop in Bene-yaakan which was between Moseroth and Hor-hagidgad;<sup><xref rid="fn853">220</xref></sup> hence it is not mentioned here]. This is a very proper interpretation of explaining the verses in a manner that fits the text. Scripture mentions that the name of the place was <italic>Yotbathah</italic> [&#x201C;Jotbah,&#x201D; from the root <italic>tovah</italic> &#x2014; good] because it was a &#x201C;good&#x201D; place for there were brooks of water, while the rest of the wilderness was <italic>a land of drought</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn854">221</xref></sup> <italic>thirsty ground where there was no water</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn855">222</xref></sup> The reason for Moses&#x2019; mentioning the death of Aaron now while discussing these subjects is because he had said, <italic>and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time</italic><sup><xref rid="fn856">223</xref></sup> [and so he indicated here] that the punishment of &#x201C;destruction&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn857">224</xref></sup> did not touch him [Aaron] neither himself personally nor his seed &#x2014; for Aaron did not die until the fortieth year [after the exodus], being old and full of days, and his son ministered in his stead. He said, <italic>And the children of Israel journeyed</italic>, and not &#x201C;and you journeyed,&#x201D; for in the sections of reproof he speaks directly to the people to chastise them, but in this [verse] he narrates the journeys of the children of Israel.</p>
<p>8. AT THAT TIME THE ETERNAL SEPARATED THE TRIBE OF LEVI. &#x201C;This refers back to the first subject. <italic>At that time</italic>, in the first year of your departure from Egypt when you sinned by worshipping the calf and the sons of Levi did not sin, G-d separated them from you.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. And if so, he is stating that from that time the sons of Levi were separated before Him, blessed be He [but only in thought], for He did not separate them in fact until the second year in the second month [after the first census which took place <italic>on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt</italic>]&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn858">225</xref></sup> Or it may be that he is alluding to what he said to them [at the affair of the calf], <italic>Consecrate yourselves today to the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn859">226</xref></sup> for thereby you dedicate yourselves to the service of priests and Levites.</p>
<p>The correct interpretation, it appears to me, is that the expression <italic>at that time</italic> means that the second [giving of the Tablets] was like the first. For, from the time He said to Moses <italic>Hew thee two Tablets of stone</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn860">227</xref></sup> He was reconciled with Israel, and Moses was instructed regarding the construction of the Tabernacle. Then He was reconciled also with Aaron, and Moses was commanded, <italic>and they shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, and his sons &#x2014; to sanctify him &#x2014; that he may minister unto Me in the priest&#x2019;s office</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn861">228</xref></sup> and He further commanded him concerning the initiation [of the priests]. Therefore he said [here in Verse 6] that Eleazar ministered in the priest&#x2019;s office in his father&#x2019;s stead, since their anointing was <italic>to them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn862">229</xref></sup> Moses regarded the separation of the entire tribe [of Levi &#x2014; priests and Levites] as one matter [therefore he said here, <italic>At that time</italic> &#x2014; when the second Tablets were given, even though only the priests were formally separated, it was equivalent to a designation of the entire tribe, with the formal designation of the Levites to come after the first census], for, from that day on it was [resolved] before Him that His tribe be <italic>wholly given unto</italic> Him<sup><xref rid="fn863">230</xref></sup> to perform the service of the Tabernacle. Or perhaps he is saying that the tribe of Levi was separated at that time for the priests to be [chosen] from them, for they [i.e., the priests] also carried the ark.<sup><xref rid="fn864">231</xref></sup> And so it is said, <italic>and he</italic> [Moses] <italic>delivered it</italic> [the Torah] <italic>unto the priests the sons of Levi; that bore the ark of the covenant of the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn865">232</xref></sup> and they [the priests] are the ones who minister to G-d and bless in His Name [as the verse before us concludes]. And the meaning of the expression <italic>unto this day</italic> [at the end of this verse] is that it refers [back] to Eleazar&#x2019;s ministering in the priest&#x2019;s office [in Aaron&#x2019;s stead &#x2014; mentioned in Verse 6], as if saying: &#x201C;then He separated them [the priests] to minister to Him, and it [so] was to this day&#x201D; [i.e., the time when Moses spoke these words, that Eleazar served as High Priest].<sup><xref rid="fn866">233</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. WHEREFORE LEVI HATH NO PORTION. The purport thereof is<sup><xref rid="fn867">234</xref></sup> that because they all [i.e., the Levites] minister to and assist the priests in their [Divine] Service, since every part of the Sanctuary pertained to the offerings, [therefore, the whole tribe of Levi was not free to devote itself to the cultivation and development of the Land; therefore they received no portion therein]. And so He said [to Aaron], <italic>And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou near with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn868">235</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. AND I STAYED IN THE MOUNT. In the opinion of our Rabbis<sup><xref rid="fn869">236</xref></sup> Moses is stating that he remained on the mountain when he ascended there with the [second] two Tablets in his hand, <italic>according to the first days</italic> of the first Tablets, <italic>forty days and forty nights, and the Eternal hearkened unto me that</italic> third <italic>time also</italic><sup><xref rid="fn870">237</xref></sup> [as] when <italic>the Eternal passed by before him, and proclaimed: &#x2018;The Eternal, the Eternal, G-d, merciful</italic>, etc.,&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn871">238</xref></sup> and Moses requested of G-d, <italic>and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Thine inheritance</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn872">239</xref></sup> and He submitted and said [in Verse 11], <italic>Arise, go before the people, causing them to set forward, that they may go in and possess the Land</italic>. It is this which is stated, <italic>and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the Eternal that I am about to do with thee, that it is tremendous</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn873">240</xref></sup></p>
<p>THE ETERNAL WOULD NOT &#x2018;DESTROY&#x2019; THEE. The meaning thereof is that He did not want to prevent you from entering and possessing the Land, similar in meaning to the verse, <italic>He will yet again leave them in the wilderness, and so ye will &#x2018;destroy&#x2019; all this people</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn874">241</xref></sup> And by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], he is stating that He [the Eternal] did not want the destruction to be from Him, so that His Great Name no [longer] be with you. I have already alluded to this subject in the section of <italic>Ki Thisa</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn875">242</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. WHAT DOTH THE ETERNAL THY G-D REQUIRE OF THEE. This is connected with the expression [in the following verse] <italic>for thy good</italic>. He is stating: &#x201C;He does not require anything of you for His sake, only for your sake,&#x201D; similar in meaning to the verse, <italic>If thou be righteous, what givest thou Him?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn876">243</xref></sup> Rather, it is all for your good. And he stated the reason for it, because <italic>unto the Eternal thy G-d belongeth the heaven, and the heaven of heavens, the earth, with all that therein is</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn877">244</xref></sup> all giving glory to His Name and He is not in need of you. <italic>Only the Eternal delighted in thy fathers to love them, and He chose their seed after them, even you, above all peoples</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn878">245</xref></sup> for you are the chosen of their seed, not Ishmael nor Esau.</p>
<p>15. AS IT IS THIS DAY. The meaning thereof is that thus it will be with their seed forever [that they will be His chosen ones]. I have already explained<sup><xref rid="fn879">246</xref></sup> the terms &#x201C;delight&#x201D; and &#x201C;choosing.&#x201D; And the expression <italic>the heaven of heavens</italic><sup><xref rid="fn877">244</xref></sup> refers to the spherical bodies of the four elements [fire, water, earth and air] which are in the potential of the heavens below them,<sup><xref rid="fn880">247</xref></sup> similar to what is said, <italic>the earth, with all that therein is</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn877">244</xref></sup> And so it is said in the psalm: <italic>Praise ye the Eternal from the heavens; praise Him in the heights</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn881">248</xref></sup> and continues to mention His angels, His host,<sup><xref rid="fn882">249</xref></sup> and <italic>the stars of light</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn883">250</xref></sup> and afterwards, <italic>Praise Him, ye heaven of heavens</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn884">251</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. CIRCUMCISE THEREFORE THE FORESKIN OF YOUR HEART &#x2014; that your heart be open to know the truth, not as you have done to this day, for <italic>the Eternal hath not given you a heart to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear</italic> [<italic>unto this day</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn885">252</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND BE NO MORE STIFFNECKED &#x2014; that <italic>you be not as your fathers</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn886">253</xref></sup> <italic>a stubborn and rebellious generation</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn887">254</xref></sup> because they dwelled with the Egyptians <italic>and learned their works</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn888">255</xref></sup> and were obdurate about discarding their ways as [shown by the fact] they made the [golden] calf, and He called them there <italic>it is a stiffnecked people</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn889">256</xref></sup> meaning that they will not disavow the mistake that had entered their hearts to think that there is some benefit in worshipping the angels or the host of heaven. But you are to know, to be wise and to believe <italic>For the Eternal your G-d, He is G-d of gods, and Lord of lords</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn890">257</xref></sup> <italic>G-d of &#x2018;gods&#x2019;</italic> is a reference to the angels above, <italic>and the Lord of &#x2018;lords&#x2019;</italic> is an allusion to all the host of heaven to whom dominion over the lower creatures belongs, for He is the Lord Who established their authority on earth, and His <italic>is the greatness and the power</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn891">258</xref></sup> and He is to be feared in the beauty of His strength,<sup><xref rid="fn892">259</xref></sup> <italic>Who regarded not any one</italic><sup><xref rid="fn890">257</xref></sup> of the angels or the lords to protect their worshippers, <italic>nor taketh bribery</italic><sup><xref rid="fn890">257</xref></sup> from the hand of a person. Now on this matter of bribery [to G-d] they<sup><xref rid="fn893">260</xref></sup> have explained its meaning to be that even if a perfectly pious person should commit a sin, He will not accept from him any of his meritious deeds, as a bribe in atonement for him. And Onkelos translated: &#x201C;[He is the great G-d] before Whom there is no regard for persons, nor the acceptance of a bribe.&#x201D; Onkelos thus meant to explain that the verse is in praise of negative attributes of the Creator, blessed be He.<sup><xref rid="fn894">261</xref></sup> The verse is thus stating that G-d is not of the category [of beings] that regards persons, <italic>for men shall not see</italic> Him <italic>and live</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn895">262</xref></sup> and everything <italic>is as nothing before Him; they are accounted by Him as things of nought, and vanity;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn896">263</xref></sup> nor is He of the category of beings that take a bribe or reward from man like kings and judges of a land.</p>
<p>The correct interpretation in my opinion is that he is stating that G-d is not partial to powerful persons in their quarrel with their inferiors, nor does He take a bribe from the rich when they strive with the poor, for <italic>He doth execute justice for the fatherless and widow</italic><sup><xref rid="fn897">264</xref></sup> from the powerful, <italic>and despoileth life of those that despoil them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn898">265</xref></sup> <italic>And He loveth the stranger in giving him food and raiment</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn897">264</xref></sup> these being all the essential needs of man. Thus He supports the poor who have no friend and companion.</p>
<p>19. FOR YE WERE STRANGERS IN THE LAND OF EGYPT. &#x201C;Do not reproach your fellow man with a fault which is also in you.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. I have already explained it in the section <italic>And these are the ordinances</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn899">266</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. HE IS THY PRAISE, AND HE IS THY G-D. The meaning thereof is that He should be your [sole object of] praise, that you are to devote all your praise to Him, praising Him always and <italic>not to give</italic> His <italic>glory to another, neither</italic> His <italic>praise to graven images</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn900">267</xref></sup> nor to the gods and lords mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn889">256</xref></sup> Or he may be stating: &#x201C;<italic>He is thy praise</italic>, for through Him you are praised above all peoples,&#x201D; similar in expression to the verses, <italic>For Thou art the glory of their strength;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn901">268</xref></sup> <italic>O Eternal, my strength, and my stronghold</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn902">269</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And He is thy G-d</italic>, for He has especially addressed His Name to you, that you be <italic>unto Himself for a people, and that He may be unto thee a G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn903">270</xref></sup> unlike the rest of the peoples to whom He is the G-d of [the various] gods [i.e., angels, etc.] that He allotted to them, as I have explained,<sup><xref rid="fn904">271</xref></sup> because he has done for you <italic>the great and tremendous things</italic> from which you can recognize that you are His portion and His inheritance, and His eyes are always upon you for good.&#x201D;</p>
<h1>11</h1>
<p>1. AND THOU SHALT KEEP HIS CHARGE &#x2014; to fear Him, that you be heedful of sinning against Him. For after enjoining them concerning the love of G-d,<sup><xref rid="fn905">272</xref></sup> He commands them concerning fear [of Him] and He enjoins the observance of the statutes, ordinances, and commandments. Or it may be that the expression <italic>and thou shalt keep His charge</italic> means that you are to protect what G-d protects, for <italic>He preserveth the strangers</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn906">273</xref></sup> <italic>is gracious unto the poor</italic><sup><xref rid="fn907">274</xref></sup> and the destitute, and <italic>He doth execute justice for the fatherless and the widow</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn908">275</xref></sup> As it is said elsewhere, <italic>to keep the charge of the Eternal thy G-d, to walk in His ways</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn909">276</xref></sup> and the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn910">277</xref></sup> &#x201C;Just as He is gracious and merciful,<sup><xref rid="fn911">278</xref></sup> so you also be gracious and merciful, etc.&#x201D;</p>
<p>2. HIS GREATNESS, HIS MIGHTY HAND, AND HIS OUTSTRETCHED ARM. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented: &#x201C;[<italic>His greatness</italic> etc.] to bring you out from Egypt; and the signs<sup><xref rid="fn912">279</xref></sup> and wonders, which He did to Pharaoh; <italic>and what He did unto you in the wilderness</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn913">280</xref></sup> in the matter of the manna.&#x201D; But in my opinion it is incorrect, for now he [Moses] speaks only of the chastisement with which G-d admonished those who transgressed His will; [instead, the correct interpretation of the verse is as follows:] <italic>His greatness</italic> in that He exalted and elevated Himself when saying, <italic>Have thou this glory over me;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn914">281</xref></sup> <italic>By tomorrow shall this sign be;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn915">282</xref></sup> <italic>And I will distinguish</italic> [<italic>between My people and thy people</italic>];<sup><xref rid="fn915">282</xref></sup> <italic>that thou mayest know that the earth is the Eternal&#x2019;s</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn916">283</xref></sup> <italic>And His mighty hand</italic> [refers to], <italic>And I will put forth My hand, and smite Egypt;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn917">284</xref></sup> <italic>the great work which the Eternal did</italic> [<italic>upon the Egyptians</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn918">285</xref></sup> <italic>And His outstretched arm</italic> [means] that He did not give the Egyptians relief and deliverance from the moment His hand was stretched out upon them, and <italic>He hath not withdrawn His hand from consuming</italic><sup><xref rid="fn919">286</xref></sup> until He destroyed them. <italic>And what He did unto you in the wilderness</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn913">280</xref></sup> [means] that He smote you [Israel] in the affair of the calf,<sup><xref rid="fn920">287</xref></sup> in the fire that burned at Taberah,<sup><xref rid="fn921">288</xref></sup> [in the affair of] the fiery serpents,<sup><xref rid="fn922">289</xref></sup> Kibroth-hattaavah,<sup><xref rid="fn923">290</xref></sup> the plague at Shittim,<sup><xref rid="fn924">291</xref></sup> and the decree in the affair of the spies so that the hand of G-d was upon them until they came to this place. He [Moses] shortened, however, the account of the punishments that He inflicted upon them. And if so, <italic>Therefore shall ye keep all the commandment</italic> etc. <italic>that ye may be strong</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn925">292</xref></sup> for His mighty hand strengthens those who keep His commandments, <italic>neither will He uphold the evildoers</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn926">293</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. HOW HE MADE THE WATER OF THE RED SEA TO OVERFLOW THEM THAT PURSUED AFTER YOU, AND HOW THE ETERNAL HATH DESTROYED THEM UNTO THIS DAY. I have not understood the meaning of the phrase, <italic>unto this day</italic>, for all who die in the sea are destroyed forever [thus the expression <italic>unto this day</italic> would appear redundant]&#x0021; Possibly it refers back to the expression <italic>unto their horses, and to their chariots</italic>, that for the entire generation [following the exodus] horses and chariots remained [irretrievably] lost, since Pharaoh had taken along with him all the horses, chariots, and horsemen that were in Egypt and they were all destroyed, and henceforth it was <italic>a lowly kingdom</italic><sup><xref rid="fn927">294</xref></sup> without <italic>the chariot and horse, the army and the power</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn928">295</xref></sup> And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented that [the expression <italic>unto this day</italic>] denotes that their children afterwards never rose in their stead to resemble them. Rabbi Abraham&#x2019;s intent is to state that G-d [not only] destroyed the pursuers in the sea, [but] in Egypt [proper] He destroyed the seed [of the pursuers], not leaving them <italic>a name and remnant</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn929">296</xref></sup> since they were the most wicked of all the Egyptians to pursue after <italic>the redeemed of the Eternal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn930">297</xref></sup> But this is not mentioned in the Torah&#x0021;</p>
<p>He mentions <italic>and what He did unto Dathan and A biram</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn931">298</xref></sup> but did not mention of Korach and his company that a fire came forth from before the Eternal and consumed them, because it is a prohibition of the Torah for a stranger [non-priest] to approach [the Sanctuary] to burn incense,<sup><xref rid="fn932">299</xref></sup> such a transgressor being punished in all future generations, as happened also to King Uzziah;<sup><xref rid="fn933">300</xref></sup> therefore he did not enumerate it among the signs in the wilderness.</p>
<p>10. [FOR THE LAND, WHITHER THOU GOEST IN TO POSSESS IT, IS] NOT AS THE LAND OF EGYPT &#x2014; &#x201C;but better than it. This assurance was given to Israel upon their departure from Egypt, for they said, &#x2018;Perhaps we will not come to a Land as good and beautiful as this&#x2019; [hence they were assured that the Land whither they were going was far better than Egypt]. One might, however, think that Scripture speaks in disdain of the Land, and Moses said thus to them: <italic>It is not as the land of Egypt</italic> &#x2014; but worse than it&#x0021;&#x2019; Scripture states, therefore, <italic>Behold, Hebron &#x2018;nivnethah&#x2019; (was built) seven years before Zoan in Egypt</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn934">301</xref></sup> One person [Ham] built [both] of them. Usually, a person builds the better city first and afterwards the inferior one etc.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn935">302</xref></sup> This is Rashi&#x2019;s language from the Sifre.<sup><xref rid="fn936">303</xref></sup> And he further quoted what the Rabbis have interpreted in the Gemara of Tractate Kethuboth<sup><xref rid="fn937">304</xref></sup> with a different point of view: &#x201C;Is it possible that a man would build a house for his younger son first and afterwards for his elder son?<sup><xref rid="fn937">304</xref></sup> But the meaning of the expression, <italic>Behold, Hebron &#x2018;nivnethah&#x2019; seven years</italic><sup><xref rid="fn933">300</xref></sup> is that it was &#x2018;built up&#x2019; superior to Zoan sevenfold.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In line with the plain meaning of Scripture the verse here is said by way of the warnings [with which Moses has been admonishing the Israelites]. For he said to them, &#x201C;<italic>Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments</italic> etc. <italic>that you may possess the Land</italic> etc. <italic>a Land flowing with milk and honey</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn938">305</xref></sup> since G-d will give <italic>the rain of your Land in its season</italic><sup><xref rid="fn939">306</xref></sup> and the Land shall yield her produce. But know you that it is not like the land of Egypt [where one can find sufficient water] to irrigate it with his feet from the streams and the pools <italic>as a garden of herbs</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn940">307</xref></sup> Instead, <italic>it is a Land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water as, the rain of heaven cometh down</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn941">308</xref></sup> not in any other way. Therefore it requires that G-d care for it always by giving it rain because it is a very thirsty Land and needs rain all year. If you transgress G-d&#x2019;s Will and He does not care for it [the Land] with &#x2018;rains of benevolence&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn942">309</xref></sup> it is a very bad one, <italic>it cannot be sown, nor beareth, nor any herb groweth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn943">310</xref></sup> on its mountains.&#x201D; All this he reviews and explains in the following section, that <italic>if ye shall hearken diligently unto My commandments</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn944">311</xref></sup> then <italic>I shall give the rain of your Land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain</italic><sup><xref rid="fn945">312</xref></sup> always, and if you will not listen <italic>He shall shut up the heaven</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn946">313</xref></sup> <italic>and ye shall perish</italic> by famine <italic>from off the good Land</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn946">313</xref></sup> since you will not be able to live therein without rain.</p>
<p>Thus this section warns in terms of the laws of nature. From it we learn that although everything is within His authority and it was <italic>but a light thing in the sight of the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn947">314</xref></sup> blessed be He, to destroy the inhabitants of the land of Egypt and to dry up their rivers and streams, the land of Canaan, however, could be destroyed more quickly, by His not providing <italic>the showers of His mighty rain</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn948">315</xref></sup> The sick person needs merits and prayer in order that G-d heal him more than the healthy one who is not struck by illness, and such is also the way with the poor and the rich, [although] <italic>the Eternal giveth light to the eyes of them both</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn949">316</xref></sup></p>
<p>And because he said, <italic>a Land which the Eternal thy G-d careth for</italic>, when he should have said, &#x201C;and it drinketh water as the rain of heaven cometh down &#x2018;whenever&#x2019; the Eternal thy G-d careth for it,&#x201D; the following interpretation of our Rabbis<sup><xref rid="fn950">317</xref></sup> is alluded to in the text: &#x201C;But does He not care for all lands, as it is said, <italic>to cause it to rain on a land where no man is</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn951">318</xref></sup> [The answer is that the verse tells us] as it were, He exercises care for that Land alone, but through the particular care that He bestows on it, He cares also for all lands. <italic>The eyes of the Eternal thy G-d are always upon it</italic><sup><xref rid="fn952">319</xref></sup> to see what it requires and to enact new decrees for it, sometimes for good and sometimes for bad etc.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn953">320</xref></sup> as it is written in Tractate Rosh Hashanah.<sup><xref rid="fn953">320</xref></sup> There is also in this verse a profound secret, being that this Land is cared for &#x201C;in all things&#x201D; which is [called] <italic>Kol</italic> (All),<sup><xref rid="fn954">321</xref></sup> and all lands are sustained from it in truth.</p>
<p>13. [AND TO SERVE HIM] WITH ALL YOUR HEART AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL. &#x201C;Has he not already mentioned <italic>with all thy heart and with all thy soul?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn955">322</xref></sup> But that warning was addressed to the individual, and this is a warning to the community.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language quoting the Sifre.<sup><xref rid="fn956">323</xref></sup> The explanation of the matter is as follows: G-d does not always perform miracles &#x2014; every time giving the rain of the Land [in its proper season], the former rain and the latter rain, increasing the corn, wine, and oil, and providing also abundant grass in the fields for the cattle, or, on the contrary, shutting up the heaven and drying up the Land &#x2014; except according to the deeds of the majority of the people. The individual, however, lives by his own merits, <italic>and he dies in his iniquity</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn957">324</xref></sup> Thus he is saying that upon their performance of all the commandments out of perfect love, He will do all these miracles with them for the good. And he further says that when they worship idols He will perform with them a sign for bad [to indicate to them the need to repent]. Know further that miracles for good or bad are performed only for perfectly righteous or utterly wicked people. For average people, however, He visits good or bad upon them in a natural manner according to <italic>their way and by their doings</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn958">325</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. AND THOU SHALT EAT AND BE SATISFIED. &#x201C;This is another blessing, meaning that there will be a blessing on the bread within your stomach, and you eat and be satisfied.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language and Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented: &#x201C;<italic>And thou shalt eat and be satisfied</italic>. This refers back to <italic>thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil</italic> [mentioned in the preceding verse], not to <italic>the grass in thy fields</italic> which is near [in the same verse].&#x201D; The correct interpretation in my opinion is that it refers to everything: &#x201C;<italic>and thou shalt eat and be satisfied</italic> with the corn, wine, and oil, and also the sheep and cattle [will eat and be satisfied with the grass in the field].&#x201D; And in the Sifre we find:<sup><xref rid="fn959">326</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And thou shalt eat and be satisfied</italic>, when your cattle eats and is satisfied, it works the ground [with strength], and so it is said, <italic>and much increase is by the strength of the ox</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn960">327</xref></sup> Another interpretation: [<italic>And thou shalt eat and be satisfied</italic>] from the young [of the cattle]. Although there is no proof of this, yet there is an indication, for it says, <italic>And they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow unto the goodness of the Eternal, to the corn, and to the wine, and to the oil, and to the young of the flock and of the herd</italic> etc.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn961">328</xref></sup> This is the correct interpretation.</p>
<p>18. THEREFORE SHALL YE PUT THESE MY WORDS IN YOUR HEART. &#x201C;Even after you have been exiled, be distinguished by the commandments. Put on the <italic>T&#x2019;fillin</italic>, attach a <italic>Mezuzah</italic> [to the doorpost of your home], so that they will not be novelties to you when you return to the Land. And so Scripture states, <italic>Set thee up waymarks</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn962">329</xref></sup> This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. Now I have already written<sup><xref rid="fn963">330</xref></sup> on the meaning of this matter, that these commandments [the <italic>T&#x2019;fillin</italic> and the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> mentioned by Rashi] are personal obligations and, as such, their laws apply in all places just as in the Land&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn964">331</xref></sup> But there is in this Midrash<sup><xref rid="fn965">332</xref></sup> a profound secret, and I have already alluded to it.<sup><xref rid="fn966">333</xref></sup> Now he repeated these commandments about the <italic>T&#x2019;fillin</italic>, the study of the words of the Torah, and the <italic>Mezuzah</italic>, a second time<sup><xref rid="fn967">334</xref></sup> in order to allude to this analogy, that we shall be obligated to observe them after being exiled from the Land of Israel. From these [texts] we learn that all commandments that are personal obligations are binding in all places and that, outside the Land of Israel, we are exempt from duties which apply to ground, such as heave-offering and tithes. So it is interpreted in the Sifre.<sup><xref rid="fn968">335</xref></sup> And the intent of this interpretation is suggested by the fact that he placed the expression <italic>therefore shall ye put</italic> [<italic>these my words in your heart</italic>] next to [the verse], <italic>and ye shall perish</italic> [<italic>quickly from off the good Land</italic><sup><xref rid="fn969">336</xref></sup> thus clearly intimating that even after <italic>ye shall perish from off the good Land</italic> you shall still <italic>put these My words in your heart</italic>]. But the main reference of the verse [even regarding personal obligations] applies to the Land, as it is written, <italic>that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, upon the Land;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn970">337</xref></sup> or it may be that the verse is stating: &#x201C;<italic>that your days may be multiplied</italic>, so that you will return [to the Land] and you will prolong your days on it forever.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn971">338</xref></sup></p>
<p>In line with the plain meaning of Scripture, it is possible that he comes to add here the expression <italic>to speak of them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn972">339</xref></sup> for there [in the first charge to the individual] he commanded <italic>and &#x2018;thou&#x2019; shalt speak</italic> &#x2014; you yourself &#x2014; <italic>of them when &#x2018;thou&#x2019; sittest in thy house</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn973">340</xref></sup> and here [in the charge to the community he stated that we are to teach the words of Torah to our children until they speak of them always. So also he added here <italic>and ye shall &#x2018;teach&#x2019; them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn972">339</xref></sup> for the term <italic>v&#x2019;shinantom</italic> [mentioned there]<sup><xref rid="fn973">340</xref></sup> means only that he shall &#x201C;tell&#x201D; them the commandments, and here [he added that the obligation extends] until they teach the words of Torah [to their children] and they understand them and their reasons [well enough] to discuss them with you at all times. So also he added here <italic>as the days of the heavens above the earth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn970">337</xref></sup> which means &#x201C;for all generations,&#x201D; or it may refer to the first heaven and earth, and the days of old.<sup><xref rid="fn974">341</xref></sup> The student learned [in the mysteries of the Cabala] will understand.</p>
<p>22. AND TO CLEAVE UNTO HIM. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented: &#x201C;[You are to walk in His ways so that you will merit to cleave unto Him] ultimately, this being a great secret.&#x201D; But the secret is not by reason of this reference [here in the verse before us].<sup><xref rid="fn975">342</xref></sup> Perhaps he is stating: &#x201C;<italic>to love the Eternal, to walk in all His ways</italic> until you become worthy <italic>to cleave unto Him</italic> in the end&#x201D; [as Ibn Ezra wrote]. But in the Book of Joshua it is stated, <italic>Neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor worship them; but cleave unto the Eternal your G-d, as ye have done unto this day</italic><sup><xref rid="fn976">343</xref></sup> [thus indicating that &#x201C;cleaving to G-d&#x201D; was not an ultimate goal, but something they had been experiencing all along]. If so, the verse [before us] is one of the admonitions against idolatry, meaning that one&#x2019;s thought should not part from G-d [and transfer] to other gods, that one should not think that there is any substance to idolatry but instead it is all nought and worthless. Thus this verse is similar to what he said, <italic>and Him shall ye serve, and unto Him shall ye cleave</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn977">344</xref></sup> the intent being to warn that one is not to worship G-d [in combination] with anything besides Him, but to worship [only] G-d alone, with one&#x2019;s heart and deeds.</p>
<p>It is possible that the term &#x201C;cleaving&#x201D; includes the obligation that you remember G-d and His love always, that your thought should never be separated from Him <italic>when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up</italic><sup><xref rid="fn978">345</xref></sup> to such a degree that [a person] during his conversation with people by mouth and tongue, his [entire] heart will not be with them, but instead be directed towards G-d. With men of such excellence it is possible that even in their lifetime, their souls <italic>shall be bound in the bundle of life</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn979">346</xref></sup> since their very being is a &#x201C;residence&#x201D; for the Divine Glory, as the author of the Book of the Kuzari alludes.<sup><xref rid="fn980">347</xref></sup> I have already mentioned this matter in the section on forbidden relations.<sup><xref rid="fn981">348</xref></sup> And when Joshua said <italic>as ye have done unto this day</italic><sup><xref rid="fn976">343</xref></sup> he meant, that when they were in the wilderness <italic>and the cloud of the Eternal was over them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn982">349</xref></sup> and the manna would descend from heaven, and the quail would come up and the well was always before them, and all their requirements were provided by Heaven in miraculous ways &#x2014; then their thoughts and deeds were [perforce] always with G-d. Therefore Joshua warned them that even now in the Land, when these wonderful deeds would be removed from them, their thoughts should always be with them [i.e., the wonders that G-d had done for them], to cleave unto <italic>the glorious and fearful Name</italic><sup><xref rid="fn983">350</xref></sup> and their attention should not be withdrawn from Him.</p>
<p>24. EVERY PLACE WHEREON THE SOLE OF YOUR FOOT SHALL TREAD SHALL BE YOURS: FROM THE WILDERNESS etc. In the opinion of our Rabbis<sup><xref rid="fn984">351</xref></sup> they constitute two assurances: [First,] that whatever place in the land of Shinar and the land of Assyria and elsewhere they want to conquer, shall be theirs; and that all the commandments are applicable there, because they all are [part of] the Land of Israel [as Scripture says], <italic>from the wilderness and Lebanon</italic> etc. <italic>even unto the Back Sea shall be your border</italic>, meaning that you are obligated to conquer it and to extirpate the peoples from it, just as he said here, <italic>and ye shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn985">352</xref></sup> and to uproot the idols and their appurtenance, as he mentioned above.<sup><xref rid="fn986">353</xref></sup> And [secondly] he assured them that <italic>there shall no man be able to stand against you</italic><sup><xref rid="fn987">354</xref></sup> whether in the land mentioned or in <italic>every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread</italic>.</p>
<p>It is from here that there originated a division of opinion among our Rabbis<sup><xref rid="fn988">355</xref></sup> regarding Syria which they called &#x201C;the conquest of an individual&#x201D; [and not a national conquest]. The reason is that David conquered it of his own will, not asking [authorization] of the Urim and Thummim<sup><xref rid="fn989">356</xref></sup> and not consulting the Sanhedrin. For he was obligated to dispossess all the seven nations first, and afterwards if he wished, he could go to another land as G-d promised here.<sup><xref rid="fn990">357</xref></sup> And because that conquest [of Syria] was not done in accordance with the commandment of the Torah, some of the Rabbis said that it is not considered &#x201C;a [legal] conquest&#x201D; [in the sense that it is annexed to the Land], and regarding the commandments [applicable exclusively to the Land], it has the legal status of outside of the Land of Israel. So it is taught in the Sifre.<sup><xref rid="fn984">351</xref></sup> But some Rabbis say in the Talmud<sup><xref rid="fn988">355</xref></sup> that it is termed &#x201C;a [legal] conquest,&#x201D; because, although it was not carried out properly, since David went there and conquered it, the Divine assurance <italic>it shall be yours</italic> was fulfilled and it is [part of] the Land of Israel.</p>
<ftnote id="fn634">(1) Genesis 26:5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn635">(2) Rashi thus explains <italic>eikev</italic> as meaning &#x201C;heel, footprint.&#x201D; &#x2014; The term &#x201C;lighter commandments&#x201D; thus means &#x201C;lighter&#x201D; in the sense that people regard them lightly because they think that the reward for their observance is of minor significance, and therefore, &#x201C;they tread upon them with their heels,&#x201D; so to say. But, as Scripture continues, these people are mistaken, since the reward for even these commandments is boundless.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn636">(3) In other words, according to Rashi, that the verse is speaking of the &#x201C;lighter commandments,&#x201D; the question arises why are <italic>the ordinances</italic> mentioned here? It must be that the sense of the verse is as follows: &#x201C;If you will hearken to those commandments which a person is inclined to treat lightly, such as the ordinances about monetary matters &#x2014; then etc.&#x201D; Thus, the reason ordinances are singled out more than statutes and testimonies is that Scripture wants to teach us that we should not hold them in disdain despite the fact that they deal merely with monetary matters.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn658">(25) According to Rashi who explained that the word <italic>eikev</italic> suggests &#x201C;the lighter commandments&#x201D; [as explained above] we understand why the verse singles out only <italic>these ordinances</italic> [and not the statutes etc.] because the <italic>ordinances</italic>, applying as they do to monetary matters, are often treated lightly by people; hence the need by Scripture to warn against it. But according to the interpretation of Onkelos and Ramban that <italic>eikev</italic> means &#x201C;in return for,&#x201D; and the verse refers to the reward for observing the commandments, the question arises why did Scripture single out only <italic>the ordinances</italic>? Ramban proceeds to answer this question: &#x201C;He mentioned <italic>these ordinances</italic> in order etc.&#x201D;</ftnote>

Besides, if they are to be mentioned together, then Massah, having occurred earlier, should have been mentioned first.

Now, since the command about making an ark for the second Tablets was given to Moses <italic>immediately</italic> upon his receiving them on the tenth day of Tishri &#x2014; the Day of Atonement &#x2014; this ark was obviously not the ark made by Bezalel for the Tabernacle during the following winter.

<ftnote id="fn815">(182) There, in the chapter after the affair of the golden calf, we are told that Moses was commanded concerning the second Tablets (Exodus 34:1-5), but nothing is said there about the making of an ark for those Tablets, such as is mentioned here. Now, if the ark cited here was a different one than Bezalel&#x2019;s, the question arises why is that command not referred to in the Book of Exodus, where the subject of the second Tablets is mentioned? If, however, we say that the ark here, is the same as that made by Bezalel, then there was no need to discuss it in Exodus, for Moses had already ordered its construction in Exodus 31:7.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn826">(193) Numbers 33:32: <italic>And they journeyed from Hor-hagidgad, and pitched in Jotbah</italic>. Hence Gudgod is identical with Hor-hagidgad.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn827">(194) &#x201C;To Moserah.&#x201D; This is not found in our texts of Rashi. Instead our text reads, &#x201C;<italic>And from Gudgod</italic> &#x2018;etc&#x2019; &#x201D; (Verse 7). Ramban&#x2019;s text of Rashi is to be understood as follows: &#x201C;<italic>And from Gudgod</italic> you ultimately came back to Moserah&#x201D; since the exact order in the process of their return was from Gudgod to Bene-yaakan, and thence to Moserah.

<ftnote id="fn832">(199) For, since it states here that from Beeroth-bene-yaakan they journeyed to Moserah and that there in Moserah Aaron died, it follows that Kadesh [mentioned in Numbers 33:37] is Beeroth-bene-yaakan, seeing that there in Verse 39 it is stated that Aaron died in Mount Hor.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn866">(233) Ramban&#x2019;s reasoning is as follows: Since we have now explained the verse, <italic>At that time the Eternal separated the tribe of Levi</italic> (Verse 8) as referring to the designating of the priests, from the tribe of Levi, to minister in the Tabernacle, why does the verse conclude with the expression, <italic>unto this day</italic>, since on &#x201C;this day,&#x201D; when Moses spoke these words, the whole tribe of Levi was already elevated to its exalted position? But if it refers back to Eleazar&#x2019;s office as High Priest (mentioned in Verse 6) that it was so &#x201C;unto this day,&#x201D; there is of course no difficulty as to why the Levites are not mentioned here.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn867">(234) In view of the fact that Ramban explained the preceding verse as referring only to the priests, the question arises: why does the verse before us explain that the <italic>Levites</italic> have no portion in the Land, when only the priests were discussed in this section? Ramban answers, &#x201C;The purport thereof is etc.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn874">(241) Numbers 32:15. Here, too, the term &#x201C;destruction&#x201D; is not to be understood in its usual sense, but only as a people who are &#x201C;prevented&#x201D; from entering the Land. Thus Moses said to the tribes of Gad and Reuben that by their decision to settle on the east bank of the Jordan, they may cause the whole people to be left in the wilderness, <italic>and so ye will &#x2018;destroy&#x2019; all this people</italic> &#x2014; i.e., by causing them not to enter the Land, which is synonymous with their &#x201C;destruction.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<title>R&#x2019;eih</title>
<p>29. AND THOU SHALT PUT &#x2018;ETH HABRACHAH&#x2019; UPON MOUNT GERIZIM. &#x201C;This is to be understood as the Targum [Onkelos] rendered it: <italic>yath m&#x2019;vorchaya</italic> &#x2014; &#x2018;the blessers&#x2019; [i.e., those who will pronounce the blessings]. <italic>Upon Mount Gerizim</italic> &#x2014; toward Mount Gerizim.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn991">1</xref></sup> This is Rashi&#x2019;s language, but it is not correct according to the plain meaning of Scripture, for he has not yet instructed concerning [the identity of] those who were to pronounce the blessing [which is only mentioned further on, in Chapter 27:11-14; hence the verse here could not refer to them with the definite article &#x2014; <italic>habrachah</italic> which implies that their identity was already known]. Rather, the meaning of the verses is as follows: &#x201C;I have <italic>set &#x2018;before you&#x2019; a</italic> way [to attain] <italic>blessing and a</italic> way [to attain] <italic>curse</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn992">2</xref></sup> And the expression <italic>before you</italic> signifies that you are to choose for yourselves what you desire, and I inform you that the blessing will be yours when you perform the commandments, and the curse if you do not fulfill them.&#x201D; This is similar to what he further said. <italic>See, I have set before thee this day the life and the good, the death and the evil</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn993">3</xref></sup> [This verse clearly does not pertain to the setting at Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal, thus disproving Rashi&#x2019;s interpretation that <italic>the blessing</italic> refers to &#x201C;those who will pronounce the blessings.&#x201D;] Then he stated here [in the verse before us], that they were to bestow this blessing of which he speaks, upon them [i.e., the tribes] on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal, this [&#x201C;bestowal&#x201D;] being by word of mouth [rather than by some physical act of placing the blessers there, as Rashi rendered it]. In a similar way is the interpretation of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra, on this verse, <italic>and he shall &#x2018;put&#x2019; them upon the head of the goat</italic><sup><xref rid="fn994">4</xref></sup> [meaning that the High Priest, by confessing the sins of the people, &#x201C;puts&#x201D; them upon the head of the goat that was to be sent to Azazel]. Thus he is saying here by way of admonition that they are to &#x201C;put&#x201D; [or pronounce] the blessing on Mount Gerizim, blessing the people if they will hearken to the commandments of G-d; and the curse on Mount Ebal, saying, &#x201C;Cursed be he that will not hearken to the commandments and will turn aside from the way which G-d has commanded.&#x201D; Now it would have been possible [in accordance with the plain meaning of this verse] that all the tribes utter the blessing and all of them [utter] the curse, or that the Levites pronounce them all, or that one individual proclaim them all. Hence he later reverted to explain there, <italic>These shall stand upon Mount Gerizim to bless the people</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn995">5</xref></sup> <italic>And these shall stand for the curse</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn996">6</xref></sup> and he further declared, <italic>And the Levites shall speak</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn997">7</xref></sup> and he explained the whole subject.<sup><xref rid="fn998">8</xref></sup> For here, because of his admonition which he stated, <italic>Behold, I set before you</italic> etc.,<sup><xref rid="fn992">2</xref></sup> he mentioned part of the commandment and then he reverted to explain it [fully] in its proper place. It is possible that Mount Gerizim is to the south which is &#x201C;the right&#x201D; [side of a person who turns eastward facing the sunrise, in which case his right hand is to the south],<sup><xref rid="fn999">9</xref></sup> and Mount Ebal is to the north, as it is said, <italic>Out of the north the evil shall break forth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1000">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>32. AND YE SHALL OBSERVE TO DO ALL THE STATUTES AND THE ORDINANCES. Here, also, he admonishes concerning the statutes and ordinances before mentioning the rest of the commandments, and he cites first the ordinance concerning idolatry and its appurtenances as I have explained in the section of <italic>Va&#x2019;ethchanan</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1001">11</xref></sup> Afterwards he mentions many ordinances concerning a false prophet,<sup><xref rid="fn1002">12</xref></sup> a beguiler,<sup><xref rid="fn1003">13</xref></sup> and an apostate city.<sup><xref rid="fn1004">14</xref></sup> And he mentions among the statutes first, the offerings in the Sanctuary, and afterwards, the prohibition of eating anything abominable, and the rest of the commandments.</p>
<h1>12</h1>
<p>4. YE SHALL NOT DO SO UNTO THE ETERNAL YOUR G-D &#x2014; &#x201C;to burn offerings to G-d at any place [you choose], but only at the place He shall choose.<sup><xref rid="fn1005">15</xref></sup> Another interpretation: <italic>And ye shall break down their altars</italic> etc., <italic>and ye shall destroy their name</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1006">16</xref></sup> &#x2014; <italic>ye shall not do so unto the Eternal your G-d</italic>, this being an admonition against erasing the Name of G-d, or dismantling any stone of the altar or of the Sanctuary Court. Said Rabbi Yishmael: &#x2018;Could it even occur to you that the Israelites would break down the altars [of G-d]? But the meaning of the verse is that you are not to imitate the deeds [of the idolators] lest your sins cause your ancestors&#x2019; Sanctuary to be destroyed.&#x2019; &#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. Now the words of Rabbi Yishmael are words of Agadah (homily) based on a Scriptural support [and they are not meant to be taken as the plain meaning of the verse]. However, the verse according to the opinion of our Rabbis, constitutes an admonition against erasing the Divine Name. It is so expressly stated in Tractate Makkoth:<sup><xref rid="fn1007">17</xref></sup> &#x201C;But there is yet the penalty for erasing the Divine Name which is whipping, and the prohibition is to be found in these words, <italic>Ye shall not do so unto the Eternal</italic>. &#x201D; And the language of the Sifre is as follows:<sup><xref rid="fn1008">18</xref></sup> &#x201C;Whence do I know that he who dismantles one stone [of the altar] etc.? Rabbi Yishmael says: &#x2018;Whence do I know that he who erases one letter of the Divine Name transgresses a negative commandment? Because it is written, <italic>and ye shall destroy their name</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1006">16</xref></sup> &#x2014; <italic>Ye shall not do so unto the Eternal your G-d</italic>.&#x2019; Rabban<sup><xref rid="fn1009">19</xref></sup> Gamaliel the son of Rabbi<sup><xref rid="fn1010">20</xref></sup> says: &#x2018;But how could it occur to you [that the Israelites would dismantle] etc.&#x2019; &#x201D; Thus [it is clear that] the words of Rabbi Yishmael [quoted by Rashi] were not meant to dispute [the opinion of the unnamed First Sage];<sup><xref rid="fn1011">21</xref></sup> rather, they are a clarification that erasing the Divine Name is equivalent to dismantling a stone of the altar. And if so, the meaning of the verses would be: &#x201C;<italic>And ye shall break down their altars</italic> etc. <italic>and ye shall destroy their name out of that place</italic> &#x2014; but <italic>ye shall not do so unto the Eternal your G-d</italic> to break down His altar, nor to destroy His Name. Instead, <italic>give glory to</italic> His <italic>Name</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1012">22</xref></sup> and His altar, and to the place which He shall choose there to establish His altar; to [the place where] His Name dwells shall you seek, and bring your burnt-offerings before Him.&#x201D;</p>
<p>5. UNTO HIS HABITATION SHALL YE SEEK. The meaning thereof is that you are to come from distant countries asking, &#x201C;Where is the road leading to the House of G-d?,&#x201D; and you should say to one another, <italic>&#x2018;Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Eternal, to the House of the G-d of Jacob,&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1013">23</xref></sup> similar to the expression, <italic>They shall inquire concerning Zion with their faces hit herward</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1014">24</xref></sup> And in the Sifre it is stated:<sup><xref rid="fn1015">25</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Ye shall seek</italic> &#x2014; seek [the place where G-d intended that His House be built] through the command of the prophet. I might think that you are to wait until the prophet tells you [when and where to build it]; Scripture therefore states, <italic>unto His habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come</italic> &#x2014; seek and find [the place], and afterwards the prophet will tell you [whether your choice is the correct one].

<p>And by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], <italic>l&#x2019;shichno</italic> (<italic>unto His habitation</italic>) <italic>shall ye seek</italic> means that you are to inquire after His Glory [that abides there]; <italic>and thither thou shalt come</italic> to appear <italic>before the Lord, Eternal G-d, the G-d of Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1017">27</xref></sup> It is on the basis of this expression here [<italic>l&#x2019;shichno</italic> &#x2014; unto His habitation] that the Sages have spoken of the <italic>Shechinah</italic> (&#x201C;Divine Presence&#x201D;).</p>
<p>6. YOUR TITHES &#x2014; &#x201C;the tithe of cattle and the Second Tithe which are to be eaten within the wall [of Jerusalem]. AND HEAVE-OFFERING OF YOUR HAND &#x2014; these are the first-fruits of which it is said, <italic>And the priest shall take the basket out of thy hand</italic>. &#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1018">28</xref></sup> This is Rashi&#x2019;s language quoting the words of our Rabbis.<sup><xref rid="fn1019">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>In line with the plain meaning of Scripture the verse mentions the burnt-offerings, and the sacrifices that he is obligated to eat there within the boundary [of Jerusalem] <italic>before the Eternal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1020">30</xref></sup> It mentions also that he is to bring there the tithe and the heave-offering to give them to the priests and Levites who are the ministers of the Sanctuary so that they too, rejoice with you and your families, as it says, <italic>Bring ye the whole tithe into the store-house, that there be food in My house, and try Me now herewith, saith the Eternal of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall be more than enough</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1021">31</xref></sup> And so indeed [the prophets and leaders] established an ordinance during the Second Temple concerning the heave-offering and the heave-offering of the tithe<sup><xref rid="fn1021">31</xref></sup> that the people bring them to the Sanctuary, as it is said, <italic>and that we should bring the first of our dough, and our heave-offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, the wine and the oil, unto the priests, to the chambers of the House of our G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1022">32</xref></sup> and it is further said, [<italic>and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes</italic>] <italic>unto the House of our G-d, to the chambers, into the treasure-house</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1023">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>And the meaning of the expression <italic>and heave-offering of your hand</italic> is [in line with the simple meaning of Scripture a reference to the heave-offering and not to the first-fruits] because the Torah has set no fixed measure for the heave-offering [which the Israelite gives to the priest]; rather it consists of whatever his hand sets aside [for the priest]. Similarly, that which is said, <italic>Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn</italic> etc. <italic>or the heave-offering of thine hand</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1024">34</xref></sup> reminds the Israelite that he is not to eat in his own city the tithe, the firstlings, the vow-offerings, or the heave-offering. And then the verse proceeds to distinguish between them, <italic>but thou shalt eat them before the Eternal thy G-d</italic> etc. <italic>thou, and thy son, and thy daughter</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1025">35</xref></sup> whatever may be eaten by you [i.e., the Second Tithe]; <italic>and the Levite that is within thy gates</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1025">35</xref></sup> shall eat there in your gates [i.e., outside Jerusalem] what is due him [i.e., the First Tithe] as it is stated concerning them, <italic>And ye may eat in every place</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1026">36</xref></sup> Scripture thus abbreviates concerning matters that are explained elsewhere.</p>
<p>And I am further of the opinion regarding the plain meaning of this verse that the expression [in the verse before us] <italic>heave-offering of your hand</italic> denotes that which a person lifts up to the Eternal of his silver and gold to buy with it a burnt-offering or a [peace-]offering. And [the verse before us] mentions three kinds of offerings: the vow-offerings which are [assumed as obligations when a person says], &#x201C;I pledge myself to bring an offering of <italic>a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat:</italic> &#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1027">37</xref></sup> the freewill-offering when he says of a bullock or sheep, &#x201C;This shall be a burnt-offering and I will bring it to the Sanctuary,&#x201D; and <italic>terumah</italic> (the donation) which he lifts up, silver or gold from anything he has, or when he brings his unconsecrated animal to the Sanctuary Court and says to the priests, &#x201C;This is [given] from my possession to G-d,&#x201D; similar in expression to the verse, <italic>Every one that &#x2018;meirim terumath&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>did lift up an offering</italic>) <italic>of silver and brass, brought the Eternal&#x2019;s offering</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1028">38</xref></sup> So also, <italic>All &#x2018;terumoth&#x2019; of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto the Eternal</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1029">39</xref></sup> denotes &#x201C;the offerings&#x201D; [as explained above rather than, the heave-offering]. Similarly He states with reference to the shekels, <italic>half a shekel after the shekel of the Sanctuary</italic> etc. <italic>half a shekel for &#x2018;terumah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>an offering</italic>) <italic>to the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1030">40</xref></sup> these to be used for buying the communal offerings,<sup><xref rid="fn1031">41</xref></sup> for whatever a person lifts up to G-d from whatever is his own &#x2014; whether for offerings or for Temple maintenance, as it is stated, <italic>and they take for Me &#x2018;terumah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>an offering</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn1032">42</xref></sup> or for <italic>the priests, the ministers of the Eternal</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1033">43</xref></sup> &#x2014; it is all called <italic>terumah</italic>. This is similar to what is written concerning the tax, <italic>and thou shalt give it unto Eleazar the priest as &#x2018;terumath Hashem&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>a portion set apart for the Eternal</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn1034">44</xref></sup> which remained entirely unconsecrated in Eleazar&#x2019;s possession [thus proving that <italic>terumah</italic> need not refer exclusively to the priestly tithe]. A similar usage [of the term <italic>terumah</italic> is found in the following verse]: <italic>And I weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even &#x2018;terumath&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the donation for</italic>) <italic>the House of our G-d, which the king, and his counsellors had offered</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1035">45</xref></sup> Now Scripture [here in the verse before us] does not state &#x201C;your heave-offerings,&#x201D; so that we should not mistake it to mean the heave-offering given to the priests [from the produce of the field]; instead it says, <italic>the heave-offering of your hand</italic>, what you set aside as a freewill offering from what has become your property. Now all things mentioned here must be consumed within a certain location,<sup><xref rid="fn1036">46</xref></sup> for the expression <italic>your tithes</italic> denotes the tithe of cattle and the Second Tithe which are eaten <italic>before the Eternal</italic> [i.e., within the wall of the city of Jerusalem]. However, the First Tithe is the tithe of the Levites, and the Poorman&#x2019;s Tithe belongs to them [the poor; and are the personal property of the recipients and may be eaten anywhere].</p>
<p>8. YE SHALL NOT DO AFTER ALL THAT WE DO HERE THIS DAY, EVERY MAN WHATSOEVER IS RIGHT IN HIS OWN EYES. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote by way of the plain meaning of Scripture, &#x201C;they<sup><xref rid="fn1037">47</xref></sup> have explained it [as follows]: Because they were journeying from stage to stage, [they brought no offerings from the time they left Mount Sinai until after the death of Aaron in the fortieth year after the exodus. Even after his death] a person could bring an offering at any stage as he wished; there were some who gave the firstling of their flock [to the priest] and others who did not give, since the commandment [to give the firstborn] is dependent on the Land.<sup><xref rid="fn1038">48</xref></sup> [Hence the verse before us says that after arriving in the Land we are no longer to do whatever is right in the eyes of each individual.] But this is not my own opinion [continues Ibn Ezra]. Rather, the meaning of the verse is that they were not all G-d-fearing [and they sacrificed to the host of heaven; hence Moses warned them against continuing to do so in the Land of Israel]. And the reason Moses used the word &#x2018;we&#x2019; [<italic>Ye shall not do after all that &#x2018;we&#x2019; do</italic> &#x2014; implying that he, too, participated in such transgressions] is because many commandments relating to the offerings apply only within the Land&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1039">49</xref></sup> [and not in the wilderness; hence, Moses himself had never fulfilled those commandments. He, therefore, included himself among the people]. This is Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s language. But it is not correct, since it is out of context for the section to speak in terms of reproof [that they were sacrificing to the host of heaven] and to say to them now that they were not observing the commandments of G-d, every man doing what was right in his own eyes. [On the contrary, Verses 4-15 contain a positive discussion of the chosen place that awaited them in the Land of Israel.] And how could Moses our teacher say &#x201C;<italic>We</italic> are committing sins&#x0021;&#x201D; Forbid it&#x0021; Instead he should have said &#x201C;You shall not do after all that &#x2018;you&#x2019; have done to this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.&#x201D; And what sense was there to include among the sins the commandments that depend on the Land?</p>
<p>Rather, the meaning of the verse is as follows: &#x201C;When the Israelites were in the wilderness they were commanded to slaughter all their cattle and sheep as peace-offerings before the Tabernacle, but they would perform [the Service of the offerings] in whatever place the Tabernacle was [that is, wherever it halted rather than in a fixed location]. And if someone did not care to eat the meat of bullocks or sheep he was not at all obligated to bring an offering. He was also not obligated to bring firstlings, nor the tithe of cattle and the Second Tithe. Thus a person was not bound, ever to <italic>bring</italic> an offering to the Tabernacle as an obligation, and even on the festivals they were not obligated to come there.<sup><xref rid="fn1040">50</xref></sup> So also in the wilderness, after the sprinkling of the blood and the burning of the sacrificial fat of the peace-offering [on the altar], the owner might eat it wherever he wished because Scripture did not stipulate a location for it, and therefore they could eat [the peace-offerings both] within the camp and without. Thus there was nothing obligatory upon them in the matter of the offerings; instead <italic>every man did that which was right in his own eyes</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1041">51</xref></sup> Therefore he commanded here that after [they would come to] <italic>the rest and</italic> [to] <italic>the inheritance</italic> they should not do so. Instead, they are obliged to come to a certain specific place chosen by G-d and bring there the offerings, the tithes, and the firstlings, and eat them there within the precinct <italic>before the Eternal</italic>. What our Rabbis have said<sup><xref rid="fn1042">52</xref></sup> [based on the verse before us] concerning offerings that are not vowed or freely offered [for example, the obligatory Passover-offering], that they may not be offered on a <italic>bamah</italic> [a private altar set up by an individual, a practice that was permitted during certain periods prior to the erection of the Holy Temple],<sup><xref rid="fn1043">53</xref></sup> is an interpretation based on the redundancy of the verse, as explained in the last chapter of Tractate Zebachim,<sup><xref rid="fn1042">52</xref></sup> [but the plain meaning of the verse is as we have explained above].</p>
<p>20. WHEN THE ETERNAL THY G-D SHALL ENLARGE THY BORDER. The meaning of this &#x201C;enlargement&#x201D; is not like that which he stated, <italic>And if the Eternal thy G-d enlarge thy border</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1044">54</xref></sup> [by giving you the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, and Kadmonites] etc. <italic>then shalt thou add three cities more for thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1045">55</xref></sup> for if it were, then meat of desire [meaning a meat meal prepared solely to satisfy the appetite rather than as a product of a peace-offering] would not have been permissible upon coming into the Land [but only after the enlargement of the border, an event that has yet to take place]. But there it is said, <italic>When the Eternal thy G-d shall cut off the nations, whose land the Eternal thy G-d giveth thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1046">56</xref></sup> these being the seven nations that he mentions in all places,<sup><xref rid="fn1047">57</xref></sup> and then we are to separate three cities [as cities of refuge], and so Joshua did.<sup><xref rid="fn1048">58</xref></sup> Afterwards he said, when <italic>the Eternal thy G-d enlarge thy border, as He hath sworn unto thy fathers</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1044">54</xref></sup> this being a reference to the <italic>ten</italic> nations that were given to Abraham.<sup><xref rid="fn1049">59</xref></sup> But here he said, <italic>as He hath promised thee</italic>, meaning these [<italic>seven</italic>] nations whose land the Eternal your G-d gives you [now], thus indicating that immediately after they captured and apportioned the Land, a secular meal of meat became permitted to them.</p>
<p>Now, the purport of the expression <italic>If the place which the Eternal thy G-d shall choose to put His Name there be too far from thee</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1050">60</xref></sup> is not that meat of desire [i.e., meat from an animal that has been slaughtered for food rather than as an offering] is permissible only at a distance from the Sanctuary, for if so, dwellers in Jerusalem would have been forbidden to eat meat of desire. Instead he [Moses] speaks to all Israel, saying to them that &#x201C;when G-d will enlarge your border and not all of you will be dwelling around the Tabernacle as you are today in the wilderness, unconsecrated meat will be permitted, because it will be impossible for all of you to go from a distant place to the place that G-d will choose and slaughter sacrifices of peace-offerings as much as you wish to eat.&#x201D;</p>
<p>21. AND THOU SHALT SLAUGHTER etc. AS I HAVE COMMANDED THEE. The meaning thereof according to the opinion of our Rabbis<sup><xref rid="fn1051">61</xref></sup> is as follows: &#x201C;<italic>As I have commanded thee</italic> &#x2014; orally, by law declared to Moses on Sinai This teaches us that he was commanded with regard to [severing] the windpipe and the gullet, and [severing] the greater part of one [either the windpipe or the gullet] in a bird, and [severing] the greater part of both in an animal.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Know that the term <italic>shechitah</italic> in the Sacred Language denotes the severing of the two organs in the neck [the windpipe and the gullet], and be not apprehensive because of what it says <italic>&#x2018;vayishchateim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and He slew them</italic>) <italic>in the wilderness</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1052">62</xref></sup> [which clearly does not signify severing the organs of the neck], for it is but a euphemism [as if to say] that He slaughtered them like sheep. Thus He commanded regarding the offerings, <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;shachat&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and he shall slaughter</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn1053">63</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;shachatu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and they shall slaughter</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn1054">64</xref></sup> which refer to the organs of the neck. Now at first [in the wilderness] He commanded that whatever [meat] they eat be of peace-offerings, that they be slaughtered according to the law of the offerings. Now, when he proceeded to permit the meat of unconsecrated animals, he said, <italic>and thou shalt slaughter of thy herd and of thy flock as I have commanded thee</italic> when such animals were brought as offerings, and you may eat them unconsecrated <italic>after all the desire of thy soul</italic>, meaning that He permits unconsecrated animals to be eaten everywhere, provided that they be slaughtered as He had commanded originally, when they were all [permitted only as] offerings. This is the correct meaning of the verse in line with the plain sense of Scripture. Perhaps our Rabbis intended this [thought] when they said in the Sifre:<sup><xref rid="fn1055">65</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>As I have commanded thee</italic> &#x2014; just as the consecrated animals are slaughtered [in accordance with the traditional regulations] so must also the unconsecrated animals be slaughtered [with the same regulations].&#x201D; Thus the commandment of slaughtering [animal and fowl] is here expressly stated and is explained in the words of our Rabbis on the basis of tradition.</p>
<p>22. &#x2018;ACH&#x2019; (BUT) ONLY AS THE GAZELLE AND AS THE HART IS EATEN, SO THOU SHALT EAT THEM. This means as he explains [at the end of this verse], <italic>the unclean and the clean may eat thereof alike</italic>. Since He had commanded in the wilderness that they may not eat of the herd and flock except as peace-offerings and He warned them that <italic>the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings, that pertain unto the Eternal, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1056">66</xref></sup> he states here that [upon coming into the Land] one may eat the meat of unconsecrated animals with the full desire of his soul, and [further that] he may eat it from one vessel together with an unclean person just as, in the wilderness, they may eat the gazelle and the hart which may not be offered upon the altar. Now, the expression <italic>as the gazelle and as the hart</italic> does not mean that one may eat the fat of unconsecrated animals just as he may eat the fat of the gazelle and the hart [from which all the fat may be eaten], since the verse speaks only of the manner of eating [as if to say:] in the same way that you eat the gazelle and the hart so may you eat the meat which you slaughter in all places. The verse does not state &#x201C;whatever is eaten of the gazelle and the hart, you may eat of the unconsecrated animals.&#x201D; Therefore, [in order to avoid the misconception that all fat of unconsecrated animals may be eaten] he explains everywhere <italic>the unclean and the clean may eat thereof alike</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1057">67</xref></sup> and says nowhere [only] &#x201C;they may eat it as the gazelle and the hart,&#x201D; in order [to make it clear] that the fat should not be included [in the comparison of unconsecrated animals to the hart and gazelle].</p>
<p>Now the word <italic>ach</italic> [<italic>but</italic> &#x2014; <italic>&#x2018;But&#x2019; only as the gazelle</italic> etc.] constitutes an admonition: since at first it was forbidden to eat [meat] except for the peace-offerings that were slaughtered in [the court of] the Tabernacle, and now, when he made it permissible to slaughter and eat in their cities <italic>after all the desire of thy soul</italic>, it might have appeared that one may eat it as unconsecrated meat and [if one wishes] even as consecrated meat, as was originally permitted [before the Tabernacle was erected], offering [the blood and the fat] on a <italic>bamah</italic> (high place). Therefore he stated and warned, <italic>But only as the gazelle and the hart, so thou shalt eat them</italic>, meaning that you may offer of them neither fat nor blood [on the <italic>bamah</italic>] and that you should not handle it in the manner of consecrated meat and not warn unclean people away from them at all.</p>
<p>He had to mention <italic>Only you should not eat the blood</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1058">68</xref></sup> for many reasons. For at first He said with reference to the prohibition of eating blood, <italic>and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1059">69</xref></sup> from which it might appear that blood that does not atone, [such as that of] an unconsecrated animal, would not be prohibited; therefore, it was necessary to prohibit it clearly. In the case of fat, however, Scripture did not mention [such a reason for] its prohibition thereof; and [in the case of an unconsecrated animal] not all fat which is burned on the altar as the sacrificial portion of the offering is forbidden, nor is every part [of an offering] that is not burned on the altar permitted to be eaten [in the case of an unconsecrated animal], as I have written in its place.<sup><xref rid="fn1060">70</xref></sup> Moreover, since he commanded here that we slaughter [the unconsecrated animal] and warned that we eat it in the same manner as the gazelle and the hart, it might have appeared that we are to cover its blood just as we have been commanded concerning the gazelle and the hart;<sup><xref rid="fn1061">71</xref></sup> therefore it became necessary [to repeat the prohibition against blood in order] to permit the pouring out of the blood <italic>upon the earth as water</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1062">72</xref></sup> without covering it, [a permissibility that was not apparent in the original prohibition in Leviticus 17:11]. This is the sense of the expression <italic>&#x2018;upon&#x2019; the earth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1062">72</xref></sup> not &#x201C;into&#x201D; the earth [which would have implied] that &#x201C;we cover it with dust.&#x201D; And since it was necessary to mention the permission of [pouring out] the blood [without covering it] he introduced it by stating the prohibition [against eating it]. Additionally, Scripture feared lest we [mistakenly] reason concerning blood as follows: In the wilderness at a time when all their herds and flocks were peace-offerings, the meat was forbidden to be eaten until the priest would sprinkle the blood upon the altar, for such is the law of the offerings; thus the blood prevented them from eating the meat; and he further commanded concerning the gazelle and the hart that, because they are not brought as offerings, we must cover their blood with dust, and so also the blood of a fowl<sup><xref rid="fn1063">73</xref></sup> because a fowl may not be offered as a peace-offering. And if so [it would logically follow that] we be required to cover the blood of cattle that were slaughtered because one desired meat, or that we eat [the blood] together with the meat by stabbing the animal [instead of ritual slaughtering, in which case a large flow of blood would be avoided] and the blood would not be seen <italic>in the open field</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1064">74</xref></sup> for it would be more seemly that it be permissible even to eat pure blood than to pour it out upon the ground so that <italic>they shall not offer their sacrifices unto the satyrs, after whom they go astray</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1065">75</xref></sup> Therefore he said that one should slaughter the herd and flock [by means of ritual slaughtering despite the abundant flow of blood] and not eat the blood with the meat through stabbing or by cutting a limb from a living animal; instead, one is to pour the blood upon the earth and not be apprehensive over it, but he must not eat it, neither alone nor with the meat. For this reason it was necessary to mention this law once more<sup><xref rid="fn1066">76</xref></sup> in the case of a blemished firstling, because at first [when the firstling was yet perfect] the blood thereof was to be sprinkled upon the altar, and, therefore, it was necessary to state that when it is blemished [and thus no longer fit for the altar] they should not treat its blood with sanctity, nor with permissibility, but they are to pour it out like water and not eat it.</p>
<p>It appears to me as a reason for this matter that at first when they were in the desert, <italic>a howling wilderness</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1067">77</xref></sup> a place <italic>where satyrs dance there</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1068">78</xref></sup> and all those who came forth from Egypt were accustomed [to sacrifice to these satyrs], He forbade that the blood be seen in the open field and also to slaughter at all, except before the Tabernacle of G-d in order to wean them from that sin. But upon coming into the Land, when it was necessary to permit them meat of desire due to the distance from the Sanctuary, he did not fear that the blood of the herd and flock might be poured upon the ground in their homes. However, in the case of the wild animal and fowl which one traps in the field and forest, and it is customary to slaughter them there and bring them home already slaughtered, he left the commandment as it was, to cover their blood with dust, in order that they should not offer it to the satyrs. Now the Midrash of our Rabbis on the verses, <italic>Only be steadfast in not eating the blood</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1069">79</xref></sup> and <italic>Thou shalt not eat it, that it may go well with thee</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1070">80</xref></sup> is a very fitting one and is appropriate to the language of Scripture, that they had a great passion for [eating blood].<sup><xref rid="fn1071">81</xref></sup> Therefore all these admonitions were necessary, and so much more was it necessary to mention the prohibition [against eating blood] although he did not mention the prohibition of eating [forbidden] fat.</p>
<p>Now, it is true that this comment of our Rabbis suffices as a reason for the many admonitions that Scripture states [about blood]. Yet the expression which he said, <italic>Only be steadfast in not eating the blood</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1069">79</xref></sup> is not clear to me, for what steadfastness and courage are there required to guard against [eating] blood? It would have been proper that he indicate its stringency by stating, &#x201C;Take heed to yourself not to eat the blood.&#x201D; Now, we find the term &#x201C;steadfastness&#x201D; with reference to [all] the commandments, as the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Joshua, <italic>Only be steadfast and very courageous, to observe to do according to all the law, which Moses My servant commanded thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1072">82</xref></sup> and so did Joshua say to Israel, <italic>Therefore be ye very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1073">83</xref></sup> Now these expressions [found in Joshua] refer to all the commandments, <italic>to keep</italic>, alluding to the negative commandments, <italic>and to do</italic>, alluding to the positive commandments. But pertaining to a single commandment there is nowhere found such an expression, for, indeed, what need is there for &#x201C;steadfastness&#x201D; in a matter which requires only &#x201C;to sit and not do&#x201D; something forbidden by one of the negative commandments? But it appears to me that he mentioned steadfastness [in this prohibition against eating blood] for the reason that they were attached to blood in Egypt: that they always slaughtered their sacrifices to the satyrs, as it is written, <italic>And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto the satyrs, after whom they go astray</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1065">75</xref></sup> and it is further stated, <italic>They sacrificed unto demons, no-gods</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1074">84</xref></sup> Now, the worship [of these satyrs] consisted of eating from the blood of the sacrifices, because the blood would cause the demons to assemble and they [the worshippers] would eat over it and from it, as if they were invited by the demons to eat at the table of those demons and they become attached to them. This has already been mentioned in the book Moreh Nebuchim.<sup><xref rid="fn1075">85</xref></sup> This is not the main reason for the prohibition of eating blood, for Scripture itself explains the reason thereof, that the blood is the life, as is mentioned in the section <italic>Acharei Moth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1076">86</xref></sup> But from this verse here it is clear that they were engrossed in it, and very much in pursuit of it, and they used to prophesy by means of it and tell of things to come. Therefore the verse proceeds and warns that if one should hear from blood-eaters any future event <italic>and the sign or the wonder come to pass</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1077">87</xref></sup> his heart should not be enticed but instead <italic>hold fast to his integrity</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1078">88</xref></sup> and his belief in G-d, and he should by no means eat of the blood nor cover up this practice [i.e., justifying it by some means]; he is <italic>not</italic> to be <italic>afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1079">89</xref></sup> for <italic>they are vanity, a work of delusion</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1080">90</xref></sup> Thus he warned here in the same manner that was used in admonishing concerning the false prophet<sup><xref rid="fn1081">91</xref></sup> because of his deceptions.</p>

He [Moses] did not mention here the statutes and ordinances, nor His testimonies and His commandments, but said <italic>all those words</italic> in order to include in this observance the good and the right, as I have explained in the section of <italic>Va&#x2019;ethchanan</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1082">92</xref></sup></p>
<p>30. TAKE HEED TO THYSELF THAT THOU BE NOT ENSNARED TO FOLLOW THEM, AFTER THEY ARE DESTROYED FROM BEFORE THEE. &#x201C;After you see that I destroy them from before you, [you should] pay attention as to why these [nations] were destroyed &#x2014; because of their corrupt practices. So you too, should not do the same so that others should not come and destroy you.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. And if so, this verse becomes an admonition and warning against idol-worship. And Rashi also wrote on the expression [in the verse before us]: &#x201C;<italic>How did these nations serve their gods, even so will I do likewise</italic>. Because Scripture has punished idolatry only for sacrificing, burning incense, pouring a libation, and bowing down, as it is written, [<italic>He that sacrificeth unto the gods</italic>] <italic>save unto the Eternal only</italic>, [<italic>shall be utterly destroyed</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1083">93</xref></sup> thus establishing the penalty only for those] acts which are performed in the service of G-d, therefore it comes and teaches you here that if the method of worshipping a [particular] idol was something other [than the four ways specified above,] &#x2014; for example, excreting to [Baal] Peor or throwing a stone to Merkulis, this being its customary manner of worship &#x2014; he is liable [to the death penalty]. One is also liable for [worshipping any idol whatever, in any one of the four specified ways] sacrificing, burning incense, pouring a libation, and bowing down even if it is not the customary way.&#x201D; Thus far Rashi&#x2019;s language. But this is not correct, for the [following] verse states, <italic>Thou shalt not do so unto the Eternal thy G-d</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1084">94</xref></sup> If so, the verse [before us] is not an admonition against worshipping their gods, [for it would be incongruous to follow this prohibition with an admonition not to worship G-d] but only that we should not worship <italic>the Glorious G-d</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1085">95</xref></sup> with their forms of worship, just as he gave the reason, <italic>for every abomination to the Eternal, which He hateth, have they done unto their gods</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1084">94</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rather, the meaning of this section is as follows: Up to here he has commanded many times that when we come into the Land we are to uproot the idols and their appurtenances, and destroy their names, and he further commanded that we do this immediately upon dispossessing the nations. Now he stated that when the Eternal will cut off these nations from before us, and the names of the idols will be forgotten in the Land, and we shall dwell in their land securely, we should not think in our hearts thus: &#x201C;Now G-d has cut away from before us the worshippers of other gods because they gave honor and reverential service to [the idols, which are] <italic>the work of men&#x2019;s hands</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1086">96</xref></sup> And it is not proper to <italic>give</italic> His <italic>glory to another, neither</italic> His <italic>praise to graven images</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1087">97</xref></sup> for so He prohibited sacrificing, burning incense, pouring a libation, and bowing down, <italic>save unto the Eternal only</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1083">93</xref></sup> and it is customary among kings that anyone who glorifies himself with their honor, putting the crown on his own head or wearing the royal raiment like kings <italic>there is one law for him, that he be put to death</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1088">98</xref></sup> If so, I will do unto <italic>the Glorious Name</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1085">95</xref></sup> just as the nations did to their gods and it will be pleasing unto Him.&#x201D; Therefore he warned, <italic>Thou shalt not do so</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1084">94</xref></sup> for they would do to their gods things that are abominable to Him. He did not prohibit them [these ways with which they worshipped the idols] because of those acts that are reputable and appropriate to be done before G-d alone [i.e. sacrificing, burning incense, pouring a libation, and bowing down]; rather, because of the intent they had in performing them to serve idols [they had to be prohibited]. <italic>For even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the fire to their gods</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1084">94</xref></sup> it being an abominable thing before G-d <italic>to shed innocent blood</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1089">99</xref></sup> and all the more to be cruel and <italic>have no pity on the fruit of the womb</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1090">100</xref></sup> [Hence any form of service instituted by people capable of such cruelty is considered an abomination by G-d and no ceremony of theirs is to be adopted by us.] Therefore, he stated <italic>All this word which I command you, that shall ye observe to do</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1091">101</xref></sup> the reference being to the performance of the offerings and the Service in the Sanctuary that <italic>thou art not to add thereto, nor diminish from it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1091">101</xref></sup> This is in truth the purport of this section.</p>
<p>Our Rabbis, however, have deduced<sup><xref rid="fn1092">102</xref></sup> from here that for worshipping an idol in its normal manner, one is always guilty even if he excreted to [Baal] Peor, [an act that would be an expression of contempt everywhere except in the temple of Peor]. The principle is derived from the expression, <italic>how did these nations serve their gods?</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1093">103</xref></sup> teaching that if it is considered &#x201C;worship&#x201D; in terms of that [idol] it is included in the prohibition <italic>nor shalt thou serve them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1094">104</xref></sup> But if he throws a stone at [Baal] Peor [which is a manner of worship peculiar only to Merkulis] or even if it be some manifestation of respect, such as sweeping or sprinkling [before the idol] he is not guilty of a capital offense [since that is not a mode of &#x201C;worship&#x201D;].</p>
<p>In line with the plain meaning of Scripture, he warned at the beginning of the section, <italic>Ye shall not do so unto the Eternal your G-d</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1095">105</xref></sup> meaning that we are not to worship Him like [they worship] the gods of the nations <italic>upon the high mountains</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1096">106</xref></sup> with offerings to Him, and now in this section he warned, <italic>Thou shalt not do so unto the Eternal thy G-d</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1084">94</xref></sup> &#x2014; to worship Him in His Sanctuary with their manners of worship.</p>

<p>2. IF THERE ARISE IN THE MIDST OF THEE A PROPHET, OR A DREAMER OF DREAMS. Scripture calls him &#x201C;a prophet&#x201D; on the basis of his own claim, for it is he who claims, &#x201C;G-d spoke with me while I was awake and I am His prophet sent to you [to command] that you [worship idols,&#x201D; as mentioned in Verse 3]. But it is possible that Scripture alludes to that which is true [that the person does indeed possess certain prophetic powers], for there is a prophetic potential in the souls of some people by which they know of things to come without the person knowing whence it comes to him, but he will isolate himself and [then] a spirit will arrive within him saying, &#x201C;Thus it will happen to that person in the future in a particular matter.&#x201D; The philosophers call [that power of prophecy] <italic>kahin</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1097">107</xref></sup> They do not know its cause, but the matter is substantiated in the sight of witnesses. Perhaps the soul in its keenness cleaves to the pure intellect<sup><xref rid="fn1098">108</xref></sup> and concentrates on it. Such a person is called &#x201C;prophet,&#x201D; because he predicts events, and, therefore, <italic>the sign or wonder</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1099">109</xref></sup> whereof he spoke comes to pass.</p>
<p>AND HE GIVE THEE &#x2018;OTH&#x2019; (A SIGN) OR &#x2018;MOFEITH&#x2019; (WONDER). <italic>A Sign</italic> [denotes a natural phenomenon serving as] a symbol of something similar that will take place afterwards, this being associated with the expression, <italic>every man with his own standard, &#x2018;b&#x2019;othoth&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>according to the ensigns</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1100">110</xref></sup> For when a prophet comes and says &#x201C;The following [natural] matter is to represent something which is to take place&#x201D; that is termed an <italic>oth</italic> (a sign), similar to what is stated, <italic>Therefore, the Eternal Himself shall give you an &#x2018;oth&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>a sign</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1101">111</xref></sup> that G-d is with us, [the omen being] the name of the son of the prophet&#x2019;s wife, [&#x201C;Immanuel,&#x201D; meaning &#x201C;G-d is with us&#x201D;]<sup><xref rid="fn1101">111</xref></sup> The word <italic>oth</italic> is thus derived from <italic>at hah</italic> [&#x201C;coming,&#x201D; since the <italic>oth</italic> represents something about to come]. A <italic>mofeith</italic> (a wonder), on the other hand, applies to something novel which the prophet does before us, making some change in the natural order of the world, similar to what is stated, <italic>to inquire of &#x2018;hamofeith&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the wonder</italic>) <italic>that was done in the Land;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1102">112</xref></sup> <italic>And I will show &#x2018;moft him&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>wonders</italic>) <italic>in the heavens and in the earth, blood and fire</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1103">113</xref></sup> The word <italic>mofeith</italic> is thus a shortened form of <italic>mufleith</italic> (marvelous)<sup><xref rid="fn1104">114</xref></sup> &#x2014; just like the expression <italic>&#x2018;sheirith&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the rest of</italic>) <italic>Israel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1105">115</xref></sup> [which is a shortened form of <italic>she&#x2019;eirith</italic>]. The [Sacred] Language adopted the term to signify anything which is supernatural, just as it is stated, <italic>Thus Ezekiel shall be unto you &#x2018;l&#x2019;mofeith&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>for a wonder</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn1106">116</xref></sup> and it is stated there, <italic>and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb; so shall thou be &#x2018;l&#x2019;mofeith&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>for a wonder</italic>) <italic>unto them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1107">117</xref></sup> seeing that his actions were wondrous in the eyes of the beholders. The word <italic>mofeith</italic> [a derivative from <italic>pele</italic> &#x2014; wonder] is thus similar in sense to the following expression, <italic>and she is come down &#x2018;p&#x2019;la&#x2019;im&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>wonderfully</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1108">118</xref></sup> So also: <italic>the signs &#x2018;v&#x2019;thimhaya&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and wonders</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn1109">119</xref></sup> <italic>how great are His signs, &#x2018;v&#x2019;thimhohie&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and His wonders</italic>) <italic>how mighty they are&#x0021;;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1110">120</xref></sup> <italic>the signs &#x2018;v&#x2019;hamoft him&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and the wonders</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn1111">121</xref></sup> for the terms <italic>pele</italic> and <italic>teimah</italic> refer to the same topic. Now, in the departure from Egypt there were <italic>signs</italic>, these being the matters which Moses told them from the beginning, such as, <italic>by tomorrow shall this &#x2018;sign&#x2019; be</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1112">122</xref></sup> and there were <italic>wonders</italic> which were done spontaneously without previously informing Pharaoh about them [such as the splitting of the Red Sea]. So also, <italic>what is &#x2018;the sign&#x2019; that I shall go up to the House of the Eternal?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1113">123</xref></sup> [King Hezekiah asked of the prophet Isaiah] that he should give him foreknowledge [by means of <italic>a sign</italic> that he would recover from his illness]. And in connection with that very <italic>sign</italic> it states that [the king of Babylon sent his princes to Hezekiah] <italic>to inquire of &#x2018;hamofeith&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the wonder</italic>) <italic>that was done in the Land</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1102">112</xref></sup> in order to learn how this novel matter had occurred among them.<sup><xref rid="fn1114">124</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>the rod which was turned to a serpent</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1115">125</xref></sup> He referred to as <italic>a sign</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1116">126</xref></sup> when He informed the children of Israel thereby [of the purpose of Moses&#x2019; mission], and He called it <italic>a wonder</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1117">127</xref></sup> when He performed it before Pharaoh as an unannounced miracle. Likewise, <italic>Just as My servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot for three years as &#x2018;a sign&#x2019; and &#x2018;a wonder&#x2019; upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia, so shall</italic> etc.,<sup><xref rid="fn1118">128</xref></sup> [implying that the same act can be simultaneously an <italic>oth</italic> and a <italic>mofeith</italic>], because in this act of the prophet, there was <italic>a sign</italic> foretelling what was to come, and <italic>a wonder</italic> in the practice of the prophet in walking that way.</p>
<p>If so, the meaning of the expression [before us], <italic>and he give thee a sign or a wonder</italic> is that he will say, &#x201C;I am the prophet sent to you that you worship a particular idol, and this shall be &#x2018;the sign&#x2019; for you: tomorrow there shall come the locust, the caterpillar, and the palmer-worm.&#x201D; Or he shall show them &#x201C;a wonder: &#x201D; he will cast down a rod before them and it will become a serpent. Now, in the Sifre the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn1119">129</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>A sign</italic> is [identical to] a <italic>wonder</italic> and <italic>a wonder</italic> is [identical to] <italic>a sign</italic> except that the Torah refers [to them] in two terms.&#x201D; Perhaps the intent of the Rabbis was [not to state that the terms are identical in meaning but that] there is no difference between the two or distinction in their legal status, and [therefore] it would have been sufficient to mention one. But the Torah wanted to elaborate on the matter saying in effect &#x201C;whatever sign he gives you, from whatever signs [exist] on earth.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now, this man who calls himself &#x201C;prophet&#x201D; and commands [you] to worship idols is by way of the simple meaning of Scripture a prophet of an idol who says &#x201C;The idol [Baal] Peor sent me to you declaring that he is god and he commanded that you worship him in a certain way.&#x201D; It is he of whom Scripture further says, <italic>and he that shall speak in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1120">130</xref></sup> for all who prophesy in the name of other gods, do so in order that people worship them, because they are [that prophet&#x2019;s] deities, and Scripture mentions him there, among the [general] false prophets. But what emerges from the words of our Rabbis<sup><xref rid="fn1121">131</xref></sup> is that the prophet mentioned here prophesies in the name of G-d, saying &#x201C;<italic>The Glorious Name</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1122">132</xref></sup> sent me that you worship [Baal] Peor because he was His partner in creation,&#x201D; or that he [Baal-peor] is greater than all the gods before Him and He desires that they worship him. And the Rabbis of blessed memory have mentioned<sup><xref rid="fn1121">131</xref></sup> that even if he were to say that they should worship a certain idol but for one moment alone, for example, if he says, &#x201C;Worship [Baal] Peor just this day alone and you will succeed in a certain project for such is the will before <italic>the Glorious Name</italic>&#x201D; &#x2014; that prophet is guilty of a capital offense. This, too, lies within the plain meaning of Scripture.</p>
<p>Thus Scripture commanded that we hearken not at all to him who prophesies in the name of G-d to worship the idols, nor take note of the signs and wonders that he will make. And it mentions the reason<sup><xref rid="fn1123">133</xref></sup> because we know from the exodus from Egypt which was an actual event &#x2014; not a vision or a mirage &#x2014; that <italic>the earth is the Eternal&#x2019;s</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1124">134</xref></sup> and He is the Creator, the One Who wills all, and the Omnipotent, and there is no god beside Him, and we further know from the Revelation on Mount Sinai that <italic>face to face</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1125">135</xref></sup> He commanded us to walk in this way, not to worship anything at all beside Him, and that He has not given His glory to another [deity].<sup><xref rid="fn1126">136</xref></sup> This is the sense of the expression, <italic>which the Eternal thy G-d commanded thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1127">137</xref></sup> Thus the prophet <italic>hath spoken perversion against the Eternal</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1127">137</xref></sup> Who never commanded him so, or he spoke perversion against His Glory, for it is not proper to worship another god.</p>
<p>4. FOR THE ETERNAL YOUR G-D TRIETH YOU. This is to state that the purport of the wonder which came to pass and which G-d showed him in his dream or [as the philosophers say] in his <italic>kahin</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1097">107</xref></sup> was G-d&#x2019;s will in order to test you in your love of Him. Now I have already explained<sup><xref rid="fn1128">138</xref></sup> that the term &#x201C;test&#x201D; is derived from the point of view of the one who is being tested. It states here <italic>to know</italic> [<italic>for the Eternal your G-d trieth you &#x2018;to know&#x2019; whether ye do love</italic> &#x2026; meaning] that it became known in fact what exists in potential and is revealed [only] to Him. Thus the commandment of this entire section refers to someone who prophesies to worship the idols. But concerning one who prophesies in the name of G-d to change any of the commandments of the Torah, our Rabbis have interpreted<sup><xref rid="fn1121">131</xref></sup> that if he came to [completely] uproot any item from the Torah, such as permitting [the eating of] swine or [permitting] one of the adulterous relationships, <italic>according to this judgment shall it be done to him</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1129">139</xref></sup> [i.e., he is liable to death as is stated here in Verse 6]. But if he declares it to be permissible only for some time as a temporary measure such as Elijah did on Mount Carmel [in permitting offerings to G-d outside of the Sanctuary in Jerusalem],<sup><xref rid="fn1130">140</xref></sup> we are obligated to listen to him and to do everything that he commands us.</p>
<p>It appears [to me] that if he prophesies in the name of G-d to command a precept that he innovates, as happened concerning reading of the Scroll [of Esther on Purim],<sup><xref rid="fn1131">141</xref></sup> that he is not guilty of a capital offense, only that we are not to obey him, because it is written, <italic>These are the commandments</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1132">142</xref></sup> [which our Rabbis interpret to mean]:<sup><xref rid="fn1133">143</xref></sup> &#x201C;No prophet is henceforth permitted to declare any new matter therein.&#x201D; But perhaps, since we do not believe him, he is thus a false prophet and his death is by strangulation.<sup><xref rid="fn1134">144</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. AFTER THE ETERNAL YOUR G-D SHALL YE WALK. This is a commandment that we follow His counsel, and of Him alone shall we inquire concerning every hidden thing and inquire concerning the future, as it is written, <italic>and she went to inquire of the Eternal;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1135">145</xref></sup> <italic>because the people come unto me to inquire of G-d</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1136">146</xref></sup> And so did the Israelites do with the prophets, [as it is said,] <italic>Is there not here a prophet of the Eternal, that we may inquire of the Eternal through him?;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1137">147</xref></sup> <italic>that the Eternal thy G-d may tell us the way wherein we should walk, and the thing we should do</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1138">148</xref></sup> And in the Sifre it is stated:<sup><xref rid="fn1139">149</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>After the Eternal your G-d</italic> [<italic>shall ye walk</italic>] &#x2014; this refers to the cloud [of Glory].&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1140">150</xref></sup> This is as we have explained, that we are to hearken to the &#x201C;voice&#x201D; of His signs and follow His counsel.</p>
<p>AND HIM SHALL YE FEAR. You are to believe that it is He <italic>in Whose hand is the soul of every living thing</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1141">151</xref></sup> and it is in His power <italic>to kill and to make alive</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1142">152</xref></sup> <italic>visiting iniquity</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1143">153</xref></sup> and rewarding for meritorious deeds.</p>
<p>AND HIS COMMANDMENTS SHALL YE KEEP. This refers to the Law of Moses.</p>
<p>AND UNTO HIS VOICE SHALL YE HEARKEN &#x2014; to do whatever He commands us to do aside from the Torah, such as Samuel said [to Saul], <italic>Thou hast done foolishly; thou hast not kept the commandment of the Eternal thy G-d</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1144">154</xref></sup> [referring to a commandment transmitted to Saul by Samuel]. It is this which is explained further, <italic>A prophet will the Eternal raise up unto thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1145">155</xref></sup> and it states, <italic>And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto My words which he shall speak in My Name, I will require it of him</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1146">156</xref></sup> meaning that he will be liable to death by the hand of Heaven,<sup><xref rid="fn1147">157</xref></sup> and as it happened because of the prophet&#x2019;s command, &#x201C;Smite me, and wound me <italic>by the word of the Eternal</italic>&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1148">158</xref></sup> [and when the man refused to obey he was slain by a lion].<sup><xref rid="fn1149">159</xref></sup> And so also the Rabbis said in the Sifre:<sup><xref rid="fn1139">149</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And unto His voice shall ye hearken</italic> &#x2014; the voice of His prophets.&#x201D;</p>
<p>AND HIM SHALL YE SERVE, AND UNTO HIM SHALL YE CLEAVE. I have already explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn1150">160</xref></sup> Now it has already been stated, <italic>Thou shalt fear the Eternal thy G-d, and Him shalt thou serve</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1151">161</xref></sup> But he repeated it here to negate [any consideration of obedience to a false prophet,] that we are not to fear the words of a [false] prophet because of the sign or wonder, and that we should not transgress the service of G-d because of the prophet&#x2019;s words, for it is the Eternal alone that we are to fear, and no other god. [It was also repeated here] to add, <italic>and unto His voice shall ye hearken</italic>.</p>
<p>9. THOU SHALT NOT &#x2018;THOVEH LO&#x2019; &#x2014; &#x201C;you shall not &#x2018;long&#x2019; for him, nor shall you love him. Because it is said, <italic>Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1152">162</xref></sup> &#x2014; [it is necessary to caution that] this one [who seeks to mislead you into idolatry] you shall not love.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language quoting the Sifre.<sup><xref rid="fn1153">163</xref></sup> But in the Gemara the Rabbis have said [in connection with this verse]:<sup><xref rid="fn1154">164</xref></sup> &#x201C;But [if the one misled] <italic>avah</italic> (wanted) and consented [to the words of the inciter, although he actually did not worship the idols, the misleader] is guilty&#x201D; [thus showing that the word <italic>thoveh</italic> is not an expression of &#x201C;longing&#x201D; as Rashi holds, but of &#x201C;willingness&#x201D;]. And this is correct, for <italic>avah</italic> is an expression of &#x201C;desire,&#x201D; as it is said, <italic>And the Eternal thy G-d was not &#x2018;avah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>willing</italic>) <italic>to hearken unto Balaam</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1155">165</xref></sup> meaning &#x201C;He did not desire.&#x201D; So also, <italic>he is not &#x2018;avah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>willing</italic>) <italic>to perform the duty of my husband&#x2019;s brother</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1156">166</xref></sup> [this expression being based upon the statement in the first part of that verse], <italic>and if the man &#x2018;desires&#x2019; not to take his brother&#x2019;s wife</italic>. Thus, <italic>thou shalt not &#x2018;thoveh lo&#x2019;</italic> means [&#x201C;thou shalt not be willing] in your heart [to give credence to him&#x201D;], <italic>nor hearken unto him</italic> by consenting to him, saying &#x201C;I will do so; I will go and I will worship the idol you mentioned.&#x201D; And [the inciter] becomes liable to the death penalty because of his [the victim&#x2019;s] consent. And such is the opinion of Onkelos [who translated]: &#x201C;Do not accept [the offer] from him.&#x201D; Now these two prohibitions [<italic>Thou shalt not be willing</italic> to give credence <italic>to him</italic> in your heart, <italic>nor shalt thou hearken unto him</italic>] are like <italic>Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbor&#x2019;s house</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1157">167</xref></sup> [which prohibits us from desiring what belongs to another], and <italic>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor&#x2019;s house</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1158">168</xref></sup> [which prohibits us from scheming to acquire it], so that if he desires it in his heart, he infringes the first prohibition, and if he goes on to do as he thought, he transgresses also the second negative commandment.<sup><xref rid="fn1159">169</xref></sup></p>
<p>NEITHER SHALL THINE EYE PITY HIM &#x2014; to show him mercy that he not die.</p>
<p>NEITHER SHALT THOU SPARE because of the close [family] relationship as mentioned,<sup><xref rid="fn1160">170</xref></sup> as it is said, <italic>as a man spareth his own son that serveth him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1161">171</xref></sup></p>
<p>NEITHER SHALT THOU CONCEAL HIM &#x2014; by not testifying against him in court. And in the Sifre it is written:<sup><xref rid="fn1153">163</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Neither shalt thou spare</italic> &#x2014; you shall not plead in his favor. <italic>Neither shalt thou conceal</italic> &#x2014; if you know anything unfavorable to him, you are not permitted to stand mute.&#x201D; All [these interpretations]<sup><xref rid="fn1162">172</xref></sup> convey the same thought, for the term &#x201C;concealing&#x201D; is from <italic>he that &#x2018;concealeth&#x2019; his transgressions;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1163">173</xref></sup> <italic>but a prudent man &#x2018;concealeth&#x2019; shame</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1164">174</xref></sup> meaning that he refrains from telling it. And he states, <italic>and they shall do no more any such wickedness as this is in the midst of thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1165">175</xref></sup> because this matter [of a misleader] is very common, and it would be frequently done were it not for the law [as a deterrent, hence this pronouncement was necessary], but the matter of a false prophet mentioned [above] is not a common occurrence, [therefore, unlike in the verse before us, no admonitions were mentioned in Verse 6].</p>
<p>15. AND THOU SHALT INQUIRE, AND MAKE SEARCH, AND ASK DILIGENTLY. The nature of &#x201C;inquiry&#x201D; and &#x201C;making search&#x201D; [with which the judges are to test witnesses] are explained in the words of our Rabbis.<sup><xref rid="fn1166">176</xref></sup> Now Scripture mentions these investigations [here] in the case of an apostate city,<sup><xref rid="fn1167">177</xref></sup> and also in the case of an idol-worshipper,<sup><xref rid="fn1168">178</xref></sup> but it does not mention them in the case of the false prophet or the inciter, because the prophet publicizes himself with his signs and wonders, and in the case of the inciter Scripture addresses itself to the incited party: <italic>but thou shalt surely kill him</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1169">179</xref></sup> and he [the incited party, is the one] who knows and bears witness, just as is stated, <italic>neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1170">180</xref></sup> But in the case of an apostate city<sup><xref rid="fn1167">177</xref></sup> and of an idol worshipper, which are deeds that reach us by means of report, Scripture mentions, with reference to them, inquiry and investigation [of the witnesses]. It was unnecessary to state this about the others liable to death because it is known by means of a <italic>kal vachomer</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1171">181</xref></sup> He states in the case of plotting witnesses, <italic>and the judges shall inquire diligently</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1172">182</xref></sup> because it cannot be determined which of the two conflicting groups of witnesses is telling the truth except after considerable investigation. Concerning the law, all cases are deduced from each other by means of a similarity of Scriptural expressions. And from all the combined expressions we derive the principle that we are to test the witnesses with seven inquiries,<sup><xref rid="fn1173">183</xref></sup> and examinations.<sup><xref rid="fn1174">184</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. DESTROY IT UTTERLY, AND ALL THAT IS THEREIN. [<italic>Destroy</italic>] <italic>&#x2018;it&#x2019;</italic> [<italic>utterly</italic>] &#x2014; the men that have gone astray [after the idols]; <italic>and all that is therein</italic> &#x2014; the women who followed after the men. But the children who are minors, among males and females, are not killed. And so the Rabbis said in the Sifre:<sup><xref rid="fn1175">185</xref></sup> &#x201C;Chanan<sup><xref rid="fn1176">186</xref></sup> says: It is written, <italic>The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1177">187</xref></sup> &#x2014; the verse is speaking with reference to an apostate city.&#x201D; But in the Tosephta<sup><xref rid="fn1178">188</xref></sup> of Tractate Sanhedrin we find a difference of opinion regarding this matter:<sup><xref rid="fn1179">189</xref></sup> &#x201C;Minors, children of people of an apostate city, who have gone astray with [the city] are not killed. Rabbi Eliezer says they are killed. Rabbi Akiba said to him: How do I fulfill then the verse, <italic>and He will give thee compassion, and make thee compassionate, and multiply thee</italic> etc.?<sup><xref rid="fn1180">190</xref></sup> If its intent is to show mercy to the adults, it is already stated, <italic>destroy it utterly, and all that is therein and the cattle thereof</italic> etc. And how then do I fulfill <italic>and make thee compassionate, and multiply thee</italic>? By applying it to the children therein etc.&#x201D; Thus all these commandments are explanatory of what it says in the Torah, <italic>He that sacrificeth unto the gods shall be utterly destroyed</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1181">191</xref></sup> and now he explained the nature of this &#x201C;utter destruction&#x201D; with reference to inciters and the worshippers [of idols].</p>
<h1>14</h1>
<p>1. YE ARE THE CHILDREN OF THE ETERNAL YOUR G-D: YE SHALL NOT CUT YOURSELVES, NOR MAKE ANY BALDNESS BETWEEN YOUR EYES FOR THE DEAD. This also is an explanatory commandment of what He said in the Torah with reference to the priests, <italic>They shall not make baldness upon their head</italic> etc., <italic>nor make any cuttings in their flesh</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1182">192</xref></sup> and now he [Moses] will explain that it is not merely because of the distinction of the priests which He mentioned there, <italic>They shall be holy unto their G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1183">193</xref></sup> that they were thus commanded. Rather, <italic>all the congregation are holy, every one of them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1184">194</xref></sup> and all of <italic>you are the children of the Eternal your G-d</italic> like the priests; if so, you too, take heed to yourselves regarding this commandment like them. This explanation is in accordance with the opinion of our Rabbis<sup><xref rid="fn1185">195</xref></sup> that both verses [the one here and the one in Leviticus] relate only to the practice [of cutting and making baldness as signs of mourning] for the dead, [although &#x201C;the dead&#x201D; is not mentioned in the priestly injunction in Leviticus]. But it is possible that the first commandment [in Leviticus was stated] in relation to priests to state that if the priest had his hair torn out and his flesh cut, he was not fit for the Divine Service, just as He said, <italic>and they shall not profane the Name of their G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1183">193</xref></sup> and their Service is thus profaned [i.e., invalidated]. Here he explained that the commandment applies also to the Israelites, both prohibitions being necessary.<sup><xref rid="fn1186">196</xref></sup></p>
<p>And Rashi wrote: &#x201C;Because you are the children of the Eternal it is becoming for you to be comely and not be cut about and bald [due to the tearing out of hair].&#x201D; But it is not correct, for if so this commandment should be binding even [if the deeds were done] not for the dead&#x0021; And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented: &#x201C;Once you realize that you are the children of the Eternal and that He loves you more than a father loves his child, you should not cut yourselves [in bereavement] for anything that He does, because whatever He has done is for your good although you may not understand it, just as little children do not understand their father, yet rely on him. <italic>For thou art a holy people</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1187">197</xref></sup> and you are not like all the other nations; therefore you shall not do as they do.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In my opinion the purport of the expression <italic>for thou art a holy people</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1187">197</xref></sup> [is to state] an assurance of the eternal existence of the souls before Him, blessed be He. The verse declares: &#x201C;Since you are a holy people and the treasure of G-d &#x2014; <italic>neither doth G-d respect any person, but He deviseth means that he that is banished be not an outcast from Him</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1188">198</xref></sup> &#x2014; therefore it is improper for you to make incisions in your flesh and tear your hair for the dead even if <italic>he perisheth in youth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1189">199</xref></sup> Scripture, however, did not prohibit weeping for the dead since it is natural to cry when parting from beloved ones, and when they go on a journey even in life. From this verse, there is support for our Rabbis in prohibiting excessive mourning for the dead.<sup><xref rid="fn1190">200</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. THOU SHALT NOT EAT ANY ABOMINABLE THING. He wanted now to add an explanation [to the laws] pertaining to forbidden foods, and therefore he said, <italic>Thou shalt not eat an abominable thing</italic>, thus declaring that all things that are forbidden are abhorrent to the pure soul, for the meaning of every expression of &#x201C;abomination&#x201D; is &#x201C;hatefulness and repugnance,&#x201D; similar to, <italic>for the king&#x2019;s word was abominable to Joab;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1191">201</xref></sup> <italic>their soul abhorred all manner of food</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1192">202</xref></sup> For forbidden foods that are coarse generate a thickness and obstruction in the soul, as I have explained in its place.<sup><xref rid="fn1193">203</xref></sup> Therefore he said further, <italic>Of all clean winged things ye may eat</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1194">204</xref></sup> in order to declare that [only] those [foods] which He prohibited are &#x201C;abominable,&#x201D; and the rest are clean and fit for the pure soul. And in the Sifre the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn1195">205</xref></sup> &#x201C;Rabbi Shimon says: <italic>Of all clean winged things ye may eat</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1194">204</xref></sup> &#x2014; these are the clean locusts; <italic>and all winged swarming things are unclean unto you</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1196">206</xref></sup> these are the unclean locusts.&#x201D; He has said well. Now this is the sense of these verses. He mentioned the prohibition of <italic>all winged swarming things</italic>, those <italic>that go upon all fours</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1197">207</xref></sup> and then he said <italic>Of all clean winged things ye may eat</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1194">204</xref></sup> to permit those of them <italic>which have joined legs above their feet:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1198">208</xref></sup> the locust, the bald locust, the cricket, and the grasshopper.<sup><xref rid="fn1199">209</xref></sup> It was not necessary to explain this because it has already been stated.<sup><xref rid="fn1199">209</xref></sup> But he mentioned in general, briefly, <italic>Of all clean winged things ye may eat</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1194">204</xref></sup> that is to say, all those that have been mentioned are abominable foods, and the rest of the fowls, according their species and multitudes, you may eat of them all clean things which I have not prohibited. Thus he included all things that are forbidden to us, for they are all abominable. It was not necessary afterwards to detail [here] the swarming things and all that creep upon the earth, for it is known that any pure-minded person abhors them completely. But he mentioned the signs of beasts and wild animals,<sup><xref rid="fn1200">210</xref></sup> fish,<sup><xref rid="fn1201">211</xref></sup> fowl,<sup><xref rid="fn1202">212</xref></sup> and carcass [of an animal that died without being properly slaughtered]<sup><xref rid="fn1203">213</xref></sup> in order to inform you that they, too, are abominable to the soul. He did not mention <italic>treifah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1204">214</xref></sup> since it is not &#x201C;abominable; &#x201D; nevertheless, in order to prevent harm to those who would eat it, it is forbidden, because of its poison or mortal sickness. Our Rabbis have yet more interpretations on this section:<sup><xref rid="fn1205">215</xref></sup> &#x201C;Why were [these laws of forbidden foods] repeated here? In the case of beasts [the laws were restated] on account of <italic>hashesuah</italic> (the cleft one)<sup><xref rid="fn1206">216</xref></sup> [which we are forbidden to eat, and is not mentioned in Leviticus], and in the case of birds the laws were restated because of <italic>the glede</italic>&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1207">217</xref></sup> [which is not mentioned in Leviticus and is forbidden]. And there is yet another interpretation:<sup><xref rid="fn1195">205</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Of all clean birds ye may eat</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1208">218</xref></sup> &#x2014; this is intended to permit [as food] the bird that is set free [at the purification rite of] the leper;<sup><xref rid="fn1209">219</xref></sup> <italic>But these are they of which ye shall not eat</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1210">220</xref></sup> &#x2014; this is intended to prohibit the bird that is slaughtered&#x201D; [at the purification rite of the leper].<sup><xref rid="fn1211">221</xref></sup> They [the Rabbis] received [this tradition that the expression] <italic>of &#x2018;all&#x2019; clean birds</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1208">218</xref></sup> hints that the [living] bird, not contracting the impurity [of the leper], is permissible as food. The impurity of the leper does not attach to the living [bird] &#x2014; for no living things among beast or fowl are susceptible to impurity when touching a corpse or dead creeping thing. But the slaughtered [bird], being susceptible to uncleanness, the spirit of impurity which leaves the leper, attaches thereto, and is [therefore] not clean. Thus it becomes one of the &#x201C;abominable&#x201D; things, because eating it is abhorrent.</p>
<p>21. FOR THOU ART A HOLY PEOPLE UNTO THE ETERNAL THY G-D. The purport thereof is connected with [the following prohibition], <italic>Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother&#x2019;s milk</italic>. Although it is not an abhorrent food [for both meat and milk are permitted separately] He prohibited it because we are to be holy in [choice of] foods &#x2014; or because we [ourselves] are holy &#x2014; that we not become a cruel people that is not compassionate<sup><xref rid="fn1212">222</xref></sup> by milking the mother and extracting its milk to seethe therein its kid. And although any meat [cooked] in milk is included in this prohibition [even though it is not its own mother&#x2019;s milk, a situation without apparent cruelty, nevertheless it is forbidden] because any nursing animal is called &#x201C;mother&#x201D; and any suckling offspring is called &#x201C;kid,&#x201D; and if they are together in the process of cooking there is [an element of] cruelty in all [cases whether a kid in its own mother&#x2019;s milk or not].</p>
<p>Now, Rashi wrote: &#x201C;<italic>Thou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother&#x2019;s milk</italic>. This is stated three times<sup><xref rid="fn1213">223</xref></sup> in order to exclude a wild beast, fowls,<sup><xref rid="fn1214">224</xref></sup> and unclean animals&#x201D; [from this prohibition]. This interpretation is derived from the Scriptural use of the term <italic>kid</italic> [an expression that does not apply to any of the excluded categories]. However, the thrice repeated] prohibition itself [teaches the following:] one forbids eating [meat cooked with milk], one forbids deriving benefit from it, and one forbids cooking it. And so did the Rabbi [Rashi] write in the section of <italic>And these are the ordinances</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1215">225</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. THOU SHALT SURELY TITHE ALL THE INCREASE OF THY SEED. This also is a [previously stated] commandment that he [Moses] now explains. For He stated, <italic>And all the tithe of the Land, whether of the seed of the Land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the Eternal&#x2019;s; it is holy unto the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1216">226</xref></sup> and He further said, <italic>And if a man will redeem aught of his tithe, he shall add unto it the fifth part thereof</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1217">227</xref></sup> Now these verses do not refer to the tithe of the Levites [i.e., the First Tithe], for of that it is said, <italic>And ye may eat it in every place</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1218">228</xref></sup> and it is unconsecrated food, and what reason is there for its redemption? And now he explained that He obligated [them] to tithe <italic>all the increase of thy seed</italic> [i.e., to set aside the Second Tithe] in order that he himself and his children eat it before G-d, <italic>that thou mayest learn to fear the Eternal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1219">229</xref></sup> For the priests and judges <italic>who stand there before the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1220">230</xref></sup> the teachers of the Torah, will instruct him in the fear [of G-d] and teach him the Torah and the Commandments. And he explained [here] the meaning of the redemption He mentioned there:<sup><xref rid="fn1217">227</xref></sup> it is because sometimes the [Second] Tithe will be abundant because the Eternal will have blessed you and the way will be too long for you, and [therefore] it is better to redeem it with money and to bring the redemption-money [to Jerusalem for use in buying food]. He did not mention [here] the fifth [that is added to the value of the Second Tithe when redeeming it] because it has already been mentioned [there in Leviticus].<sup><xref rid="fn1217">227</xref></sup></p>
<p>The purport of the expression, <italic>that which is brought forth in the field</italic> is &#x201C; &#x2018;and all&#x2019; that which is brought forth in the field,&#x201D; [so that the phrase does modify <italic>&#x2018;the increase of thy seed,&#x2019;</italic> and adds additional categories of produce to the requirement of the Second Tithe], just as He has said, <italic>whether of the seed of the Land, or of the fruit of the tree</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1216">226</xref></sup> and the sense thereof is &#x201C;that which comes forth &#x2018;from&#x2019; the field.&#x201D; Now the intent of the expression <italic>all the increase of thy seed</italic> is not that he is to tithe all produce from whatever he seeded, nor everything that is <italic>brought forth in the field year by year</italic>. The sense of the verse is that one is to tithe, of those species which are liable to the tithe, all of his produce [these being grain, wine, and oil, as will be explained] and all that was brought forth of them in the field. He is warning that he is not to tithe only a small part <italic>of that which cometh to his hand</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1221">231</xref></sup> and thus exempt only a small quantity of the produce, but instead he is to tithe both the measures of seed that he planted and the increase upon them [in the process of growing], all of it faithfully. Then he mentions the species which are obligated to be tithed: <italic>the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1219">229</xref></sup> and so he mentions in all places, as it is said, <italic>Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thine oil</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1222">232</xref></sup> And so He said in the section on the gifts to the priesthood, <italic>All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the corn, the first part of them which they give unto the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1223">233</xref></sup> for of these only we are obligated by the law of the Torah<sup><xref rid="fn1224">234</xref></sup> to set aside the heave-offering and the tithes. Similarly, what Scripture states, <italic>And all the tithe of the Land, whether of the seed of the Land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the Eternal&#x2019;s</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1216">226</xref></sup> [does not mean] that He commanded that one tithe all the seed of the Land and all the fruit of the tree, but rather the meaning thereof is as follows: &#x201C;Whatever you tithe of the seed of the Land, which is corn, and of the fruit of the tree, which is wine and oil, are the Eternal&#x2019;s.&#x201D; In this identical language Rashi writes there: &#x201C;<italic>Of the seed of the Land</italic> &#x2014; corn. <italic>Or of the fruit of the tree</italic> &#x2014; wine and oil.&#x201D; Now Scripture abbreviates the matter there [in Leviticus] because it is not the place of the commandment obligating that one tithe, but it merely commands that the [Second] Tithe <italic>shall be holy unto the Eternal</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1217">227</xref></sup> until he redeems it by adding a fifth thereto. But the commandment regarding the heave-offerings and the tithes applies everywhere [in the Torah] to corn, wine and oil [exclusively and to no other produce of field or tree]. Now the term <italic>dagan</italic> (corn) in the Sacred Language applies to the five well-known species of grain;<sup><xref rid="fn1225">235</xref></sup> <italic>tirosh</italic> (wine) applies to the new wine in the overflowing vats,<sup><xref rid="fn1226">236</xref></sup> and <italic>yitzhar</italic> refers to the oil therein.<sup><xref rid="fn1226">236</xref></sup> No other kind of seedling or fruit of the trees at all, are obligated by law of the Torah neither in heave-offerings nor in tithes. Now, there are Beraithoth<sup><xref rid="fn1227">237</xref></sup> taught in the Torath Kohanim and in the Sifre that are Scriptural supports for Rabbinic ordinances, and they are misleading [because the Beraithoth indicate that Scripture requires heave-offerings and tithes from other produce as well]. However, the principle that emerges clearly from the Gemara of the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmud<sup><xref rid="fn1228">238</xref></sup> and the plain meaning of Scripture is this: that even tithes of olives and grapes are not [required] by law of the Torah until they have been made into wine and oil. Be heedful of this matter, for some of the greatest authors<sup><xref rid="fn1229">239</xref></sup> have erred concerning it.</p>
<p>And the meaning of the expression <italic>year by year</italic> is that we are to set aside this [Second] Tithe in two consecutive years, one after the other [i.e., in the first and second years of the Sabbatical cycle, and again in the fourth and fifth years]. Such is the interpretation accepted by our Rabbis. And afterwards he explained that <italic>at the end of three years</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1230">240</xref></sup> you shall bring forth the tithe of your increase of that [third] year and feed it to the poor, thus declaring that the third year [and the sixth year as well] the tithe is for the poor [unlike the Second Tithe which is to be eaten in Jerusalem, it is given to the poor anywhere in the Land]. He states <italic>thou shalt bring forth &#x2026; and shalt lay it up within thy gates</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1230">240</xref></sup> in order to teach us concerning the removal thereof [from the house], and he will yet explain it in the section of <italic>When thou hast made an end of tithing</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1231">241</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Midrash of the Sages relative to the expression <italic>aseir t&#x2019;aseir</italic> (thou shalt surely tithe) is:<sup><xref rid="fn1232">242</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Aseir</italic> (give tithes) so that <italic>tithasheir</italic> (you may become rich);<sup><xref rid="fn1233">243</xref></sup> give tithe so that you may not be deprived [of your belongings]. This is a hint to those who make their way through the seas [i.e., to merchants who travel abroad] to set aside one tenth [of their profits] for those who toil in the Torah.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1234">244</xref></sup></p>

<p>1. &#x2018;MIKEITZ&#x2019; OF SEVEN YEARS THOU SHALT MAKE &#x2018;SH&#x2019;MITAH.&#x2019; The correct interpretation appears to me that he is warning about the seventh year itself, that we make it a Sabbatical [refraining] from plowing, [sowing] and reaping, just as He said, <italic>But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie fallow</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1235">245</xref></sup> this being the meaning of <italic>thou shalt make &#x2018;sh&#x2019;mitah,&#x2019;</italic> that &#x201C;you should rest,&#x201D; similar to the expression, <italic>to keep the Sabbath-day</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1236">246</xref></sup> He abridged the prohibitions of sowing and pruning because He expressly mentioned them already,<sup><xref rid="fn1237">247</xref></sup> but he supplemented [what was previously said] to explain that it is <italic>a &#x2018;sh&#x2019;mitah&#x2019; of the Eternal</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1238">248</xref></sup> also in regards to the release of moneys. This is the sense of the expression, <italic>because it is proclaimed &#x2018;the remission&#x2019; of the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1238">248</xref></sup> which is similar to <italic>a Sabbath unto the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1239">249</xref></sup> and all works are to cease. I have already alluded to its secret.<sup><xref rid="fn1239">249</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented [that the meaning of the word <italic>mikeitz</italic> is] &#x201C;at the beginning of the year.&#x201D; And so say all grammarians<sup><xref rid="fn1240">250</xref></sup> that the beginning and end of something are each called <italic>katzeh</italic>, since there are two extremities to each thing, similar to what is written, <italic>from &#x2018;hakatzeh&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>end</italic>) <italic>to &#x2018;hakatzeh&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>end</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn1241">251</xref></sup> <italic>of the two ends thereof;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1242">252</xref></sup> <italic>in the four ends thereof</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1243">253</xref></sup> But the words [of the grammarians and Ibn Ezra] do not seem correct to me. For &#x201C;the beginning of seven years&#x201D; denotes the <italic>first</italic> year [of the Sabbatical cycle], this being the <italic>katzeh</italic> which is called <italic>rosh</italic> (the beginning)&#x0021; Now had Scripture said, &#x201C;<italic>mikeitz</italic> of the seventh year&#x201D; their interpretation would have been correct [for then the verse would mean &#x201C;at the beginning of the seventh year you shall make <italic>sh&#x2019;mitah</italic>.&#x201D; Instead, however, Scripture says, &#x201C; <italic>&#x2018;Mikeitz&#x2019; of seven years thou shalt make &#x2018;sh&#x2019;mitah&#x2019;</italic> which according to them means &#x201C;at the beginning of seven years,&#x201D; i.e., in the first year you shall make the <italic>sh&#x2019;mitah</italic>, which cannot be correct]&#x0021; And in the opinion of our Rabbis<sup><xref rid="fn1244">254</xref></sup> <italic>mikeitz</italic> means &#x201C;at the end of the seven years,&#x201D; and Scripture speaks only of the release of money [i.e., the remission of debts], stating &#x201C;at the end of all seven years counted by you [as a Sabbatical cycle] you shall make a release, that <italic>every creditor shall release that which he hath lent unto his neighbor</italic>, &#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1238">248</xref></sup> and it is therefore that the Rabbis have said<sup><xref rid="fn1245">255</xref></sup> that the Seventh year cancels a loan only at the end. Similarly in their opinion<sup><xref rid="fn1244">254</xref></sup> the verse <italic>&#x2018;mikeitz&#x2019; seven years, at the appointed season of the year of remission, in the Festival of Tabernacles</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1246">256</xref></sup> means &#x201C;at the end of the seventh year,&#x201D; except that &#x201C;the end&#x201D; mentioned here [with reference to the release of debts] means immediately [i.e., in the last moment of the seventh year] and &#x201C;the end&#x201D; mentioned there [with reference to the Assembly at which the king was to read the Book of Deuteronomy] is &#x201C;distant,&#x201D; [during Tabernacles, somewhat &#x201C;distant&#x201D; from the end of the year], since he explained <italic>at the appointed season of the year of remission, in the Festival of Tabernacles</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1246">256</xref></sup> Thus the sense [of <italic>mikeitz</italic>] in both cases is &#x201C;the end,&#x201D; stating here &#x201C;at the end of seven years you shall make a release,&#x201D; and there likewise it states &#x201C;when the seven years end at the appointed season of the year of remission in the Festival of Tabernacles you shall make an Assembly.&#x201D;</p>
<p>By way of the simple meaning of Scripture it appears to me that the language of Scripture in its plain sense is clear and correct. <italic>Keitz</italic> means &#x201C;end,&#x201D; and so is its translation [as rendered by Onkelos and Yonathan: &#x201C;at the end&#x201D;]. Numbers and every [other] thing have a beginning and an end, and their beginning and end are part of them. Thus when you speak of tens, &#x201C;one&#x201D; is the beginning of the number and &#x201C;ten&#x201D; its end. If so, &#x201C;the end of seven years&#x201D; is &#x201C;the seventh year&#x201D; which is the end of that number, and Scripture refers to the Sabbatical of the Land, as I have explained above. The meaning of the word <italic>mikeitz</italic> is then like <italic>one cherub</italic> (<italic>&#x2018;mikatzeh&#x2019;</italic>) <italic>at the one &#x2018;end&#x2019; and one cherub</italic> (<italic>&#x2018;mikatzeh&#x2019;</italic>) <italic>at the other &#x2018;end&#x2019;</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1247">257</xref></sup> The purport of the verse here is thus as follows: &#x201C;at the end of seven years [i.e., in the seventh year which is &#x2018;the end&#x2019; of that period] you shall make a cessation of work on the Land.&#x201D; Similarly, <italic>&#x2018;Mikeitz&#x2019; of seven years ye shall let go every man his brother that is a Hebrew, that hath been sold unto thee and hath served thee six years</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1248">258</xref></sup> means &#x201C;in the seventh year&#x201D; which is the end of that number, this being similar to the verse written in the Torah, <italic>and in the seventh year he shall go out free for nothing</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1249">259</xref></sup> So also, <italic>and in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1250">260</xref></sup> for having said, <italic>he shall serve thee six years</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1250">260</xref></sup> it was not necessary to explain [&#x201C;<italic>mikeitz</italic> seven years you shall let him go&#x201D;] but only to state that in the seventh year he goes free. In the same way it would appear that the meaning of the other verse &#x2014; <italic>&#x2018;mikeitz&#x2019; seven years, at the appointed season in the year of remission, in the Festival of Tabernacles</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1246">256</xref></sup> &#x2014; would be in a similar way: &#x201C;in &#x2018;the end&#x2019; year, in the Festival of Tabernacles, in the beginning of that year in which plowing and sowing have been forbidden, this being the Sabbatical year.&#x201D; But we could not say so, since our Rabbis have received by tradition<sup><xref rid="fn1251">261</xref></sup> and they provided that the Assembly [in which the king read the Book of Deuteronomy] should be held in the Festival of Tabernacles of the eighth year, this being the year after the Sabbatical year. Therefore, the commentators<sup><xref rid="fn1252">262</xref></sup> said that <italic>at the appointed season in the year of remission</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1246">256</xref></sup> means &#x201C;in the appointed season of the first year in the Sabbatical cycle.&#x201D; This is not correct for <italic>the year of remission</italic> in Scripture refers only to the year of rest, to that year which is <italic>the remission of the Eternal</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1238">248</xref></sup> [and not as Rashi explained, &#x201C;the first year of the Sabbatical cycle&#x201D;], and so also, <italic>the year of the Jubilee</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1253">263</xref></sup> [means, &#x201C;the year which is itself the Jubilee&#x201D;]. Our Rabbis themselves made this point, for they said:<sup><xref rid="fn1254">264</xref></sup> &#x201C;Is it written &#x2018;in the year of the Jubilee?&#x2019; It states <italic>from the year of the Jubilee</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1255">265</xref></sup> which means &#x2018;the year after the Jubilee.&#x2019; &#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1256">266</xref></sup></p>
<p>But I say thus: <italic>keitz</italic> and <italic>soph</italic> are used in Scripture to denote &#x201C;the end&#x201D; of any matter, but sometimes they are within that extremity and sometimes after it, outside of it. Thus: <italic>&#x2018;umiktzei&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and from among</italic>) <italic>his brethren;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1257">267</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;mikatzeh&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>that is outmost</italic>) <italic>in the set;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1258">268</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;umiktzatham&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>that at the end</italic>) <italic>they might stand before the king;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1259">269</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;miktzoth&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>from the uttermost part</italic>) <italic>of the one wing unto &#x2018;k&#x2019;tzoth&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the uttermost part</italic>) <italic>of the other</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1260">270</xref></sup> &#x2014; all these are expressions of an extremity which is attached to the thing itself and is contained within it. [But the following expressions:] <italic>&#x2018;keitz&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the end of</italic>) <italic>all flesh is come before Me;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1261">271</xref></sup> <italic>and he shall come to &#x2018;kitzo&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>his end</italic>)<italic>, and none shall help him;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1262">272</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;hakeitz&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the end</italic>) <italic>is come;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1263">273</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;keitz&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>an end</italic>) <italic>is come</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1264">274</xref></sup> &#x2014; all signify &#x201C;the end&#x201D; of the matter mentioned but it signifies a later period, for it has been severed and separated. So it is regarding the term <italic>soph</italic> (end): <italic>It is better to go to the house of mourning</italic> etc. <italic>for that is &#x2018;soph&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the end of</italic>) <italic>all men</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1265">275</xref></sup> which means &#x201C;after him,&#x201D; for he has died; <italic>they are wholly &#x2018;sophu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>consumed</italic>) <italic>by terrors</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1266">276</xref></sup> <italic>The work that G-d hath done from the beginning even to &#x2018;soph&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the end</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1267">277</xref></sup> &#x2014; here the term <italic>end</italic> is within the work itself. And in the language of the Rabbis we find [with reference to the writing of a Scroll of the Law:<sup><xref rid="fn1268">278</xref></sup> &#x201C;The scribe is to leave blank] about a column at the beginning [of the Torah] and about [the width of] the circumference <italic>&#x2018;b&#x2019;sopho&#x2019;</italic> (at its end).&#x201D; The meaning of the verse [regarding the Assembly] will then be as follows: &#x201C;From the end of the seven years in the account of the year of release, in the Festival of Tabernacles which follows after the seven years, you shall make the Assembly.&#x201D; And in order it should not appear to them that &#x201C;the seven years&#x201D; refer to some other counting, he mentioned that the seven years be [<italic>bizman ha&#x2019;sh&#x2019;mitah</italic>], at &#x201C;the time of&#x201D; the release. Similarly, <italic>when I take &#x2018;mo&#x2019;eid&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1269">279</xref></sup> means &#x201C;the [appointed] time.&#x201D; So do all <italic>mo&#x2019;adim</italic> (festivals) signify &#x201C;the [appointed] times.&#x201D; Thus this term <italic>mikeitz</italic> [stated in connection with the Assembly] means &#x201C;after the period [of seven years] is finished,&#x201D; as he explained, <italic>in the Festival of Tabernacles</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1246">256</xref></sup> But [in the verse stated here before us] <italic>&#x2018;mikeitz&#x2019; seven years thou shalt make a release</italic> [the seventh year is] within that number. He did not need to dwell upon and explain this since He already explained that the seventh year is the year of the release.<sup><xref rid="fn1270">280</xref></sup> And the word <italic>keitz</italic> (end) here is then extensive, applying [to the release during] the whole [seventh] year as I have explained by way of the simple meaning of Scripture.</p>
<p>It is possible to say that Scripture counts the beginning of the year from the Festival of Tabernacles, as He said, <italic>and the feast of ingathering at the turn of the year</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1271">281</xref></sup> and He further said, <italic>and the feast of ingathering, at the end of the year</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1272">282</xref></sup> And if so, <italic>&#x2018;mikeitz&#x2019; seven years</italic> [stated further on in connection with the Assembly]<sup><xref rid="fn1246">256</xref></sup> means &#x201C;at the end [of the seven years] and just beyond it.&#x201D; And he states, <italic>at the appointed season of the year of remission</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1246">256</xref></sup> to indicate that the reckoning of seven years be according to the Sabbatical cycles, as I have explained, but not that the [legal obligations of] release extend up to this Festival [of Tabernacles].</p>
<p>Now, I have seen of one author<sup><xref rid="fn1273">283</xref></sup> who wrote [with respect to the verse on the Assembly]: &#x201C;This teaches that we are to add from the secular to the sacred, and the law of release [although officially ending at the New Year of the eighth year] still applied until the Festival of Tabernacles of the eighth year. But it is irrefutably shown in the Talmud<sup><xref rid="fn1274">284</xref></sup> with clear proofs that it [the above interpretation] is untrue.</p>
<p>Now it is possible to say that what our Rabbis have said<sup><xref rid="fn1244">254</xref></sup> with respect to <italic>&#x2018;mikeitz&#x2019; seven years thou shalt make a release</italic> that the release of money [i.e., the remission of debts] takes effect only at the end of the year &#x2014; that it is an interpretation [deduced from the text]. Because Scripture did not say &#x201C;the seventh year you shall make a release&#x201D; [but instead said <italic>&#x2018;mikeitz&#x2019; seven years &#x2026;</italic>], it is more suggestive that you effect the remission at the end of the seven [years] than at the beginning. And the intent of [the Rabbis in using here] this term &#x201C;end&#x201D; is &#x201C;beyond it.&#x201D; Thus a creditor can demand his debt on the last day of the year of the release, and it is not remitted until the night, for thus we find in the Tosephta<sup><xref rid="fn1275">285</xref></sup> that they may write a <italic>prozbul</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1276">286</xref></sup> on the day before the New Year of the outgoing seventh year.</p>
<p>3. OF AN ALIEN &#x2018;TIGOS&#x2019; (THOU MAYEST EXACT IT). &#x201C;This constitutes a positive commandment.&#x201D; Thus is Rashi&#x2019;s language quoting the Sifre.<sup><xref rid="fn1277">287</xref></sup> The meaning thereof is that there is a positive commandment with respect to your brother [that you are not to exact the debt from him after it was cancelled by the Sabbatical year, the reasoning being as follows]<italic>: of an &#x2018;alien&#x2019; thou mayest exact it</italic>, but not from your brother, and a negative commandment derived from a positive commandment carries the force of a positive commandment.<sup><xref rid="fn1278">288</xref></sup> And because we have been taught there [in the Sifre]: &#x201C;<italic>He shall not exact it</italic> [<italic>of his neighbor and his brother</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn1279">289</xref></sup> &#x2014; it is a negative commandment upon him,&#x201D; therefore the Rabbis again taught: &#x201C;<italic>Of an alien thou shalt exact it</italic> &#x2014; this is a positive commandment,&#x201D; [not to exact the debt from a brother] meaning to say that he who exacts the debt from his brother violates both a positive commandment and a negative commandment.</p>
<p>In the same way the Rabbis have said there:<sup><xref rid="fn1280">290</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Unto an alien &#x2018;thashich&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>mayest thou lend upon interest</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1281">291</xref></sup> &#x2014; it is a positive commandment. <italic>But unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon interest</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1281">291</xref></sup> &#x2014; this is a negative commandment.&#x201D; This, too, is as we have explained [that the meaning of the Sifre is] that there is a positive commandment with respect to your brother not to lend him on interest, and so did Rashi explain there,<sup><xref rid="fn1281">291</xref></sup> but not that there is any commandment to lend an alien on interest. It is so indicated from the Gemara of the Chapter &#x201C;What is usury?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1282">292</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now Harav Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon made both of them actual commandments &#x2014; to exact debts from an alien<sup><xref rid="fn1283">293</xref></sup> and to lend him upon interest.<sup><xref rid="fn1284">294</xref></sup> He erred regarding these texts taught in the Sifre. Such expressions are common there [in the Sifre] in many places, as for example;<sup><xref rid="fn1285">295</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Of all clean fowls ye may eat</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1286">296</xref></sup> &#x2014; it is a positive commandment. <italic>And all winged swarming things are unclean; they shall not be eaten</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1287">297</xref></sup> &#x2014; this is a negative commandment.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1288">298</xref></sup> Similarly the Rabbis mentioned in the Sifra<sup><xref rid="fn1289">299</xref></sup> and in the Sifre:<sup><xref rid="fn1290">300</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>These are the beasts which ye may eat</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1291">301</xref></sup> &#x2014; it is a positive commandment.&#x201D; But the matter is clear [as I have explained it].</p>
<p>11. FOR THE POOR SHALL NEVER CEASE OUT OF THE LAND. Commentators<sup><xref rid="fn1292">302</xref></sup> have said that the meaning thereof is that the poor shall never cease out of the Land at any of all times, for there will always be poor in the Land, for it was apparent before Him that they will not do [to make possible] what he said to them, <italic>But there shall be no needy among you</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1293">303</xref></sup> <italic>if only thou diligently hearken unto the voice of the Eternal thy G-d to observe to do all this commandment</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1294">304</xref></sup> But it is not correct in my opinion, for the Torah may allude to what will be but it would not explicitly prophesy about them [the Israelites] that they will not fulfill the Torah, nor would he have commanded them [to observe the commandments while foretelling] that they would always transgress them. Forbid it&#x0021; It is only by way of warning that he mentions [their transgressions].</p>
<p>The correct interpretation is that he says that it is impossible for the poor to cease so that none should ever exist. He [Moses] mentioned this because, having assured them that there would be no needy if they observe all the commandments<sup><xref rid="fn1295">305</xref></sup> he said: &#x201C;But I know that not all generations forever will observe all the commandments in which case there would be no need to charge you concerning the poor, for perhaps, at some time, there will exist poor and so I command you about him if he will be found.&#x201D; He states <italic>out of the Land</italic> [<italic>for the poor shall never cease &#x2018;out of the Land&#x2019;</italic>] in order to allude to the entire habitation [anywhere on earth], for the promise that there would not be needy among us applies <italic>in the Land which the Eternal</italic> our <italic>G-d giveth</italic> us <italic>for an inheritance</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1293">303</xref></sup> if we will fulfill there all the commandments. And now he said that it is possible that, at some period or at some place where you will have settled, there be found a poor man among you. For the meaning of the expression <italic>in thy Land</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1295">305</xref></sup> [<italic>If there be among you a needy man &#x2026; &#x2018;in thy Land&#x2019;</italic>] is like <italic>in all your habitations</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1296">306</xref></sup> &#x2014; within the Land of Israel and outside of the Land.</p>
<p>UNTO THY BROTHER, UNTO THY POOR, AND UNTO THY NEEDY IN THY LAND. The meaning thereof is as if he said: &#x201C;to your poor brother, and to all the needy in your Land.&#x201D; For because the commandment is addressed to Israel he mentions <italic>thy brother</italic>, and he joins in explanation &#x201C;your brother and all the needy in your Land,&#x201D; to command concerning the whole of Israel. And its homiletic interpretation is as follows:<sup><xref rid="fn1297">307</xref></sup> &#x201C;This teaches that [in giving charity] precedence be given to those nearer&#x201D; [to you so that the poor of your own city or land have priority over the poor of distant places].</p>
<p>He mentions that there is also a release for a [Hebrew] servant in his seventh year,<sup><xref rid="fn1298">308</xref></sup> for that release [of a servant] is also like the release [of loans in the Sabbatical year] mentioned<sup><xref rid="fn1299">309</xref></sup> [and hence the proximity of the subjects], all of them being to <italic>remember the days of old</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1300">310</xref></sup> as I have hinted in its place.<sup><xref rid="fn1301">311</xref></sup> There it is alluded that the expression <italic>and he shall be thy bondman forever</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1302">312</xref></sup> is to be taken in its plain sense. Now he repeated this commandment in order to explain in it the outfitting of the emancipated servant.<sup><xref rid="fn1303">313</xref></sup></p>
<h1>16</h1>
<p>1. KEEP THE MONTH OF AVIV. The commandment of the festivals [mentioned here] is explanatory, for He has already mentioned it. Now, in the Book of Leviticus He mentioned with reference to the festivals, <italic>And ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1304">314</xref></sup> but here he did not mention them [the offerings] at all. Instead he commanded Israel to ascend on their account [to celebrate the festivals] to the place which He will choose, and rejoice before Him. For just as he commanded that one bring the Second Tithe before G-d,<sup><xref rid="fn1305">315</xref></sup> and also the firstling,<sup><xref rid="fn1306">316</xref></sup> and eat them there in the place that G-d will choose, he added [here] to make it clear that they will all be further obligated to come before G-d and celebrate before Him on three festivals and rejoice with the peace-offerings that they will offer before Him. Now he did not mention the times of the Festivals of Unleavened Bread and Tabernacles on which dates they occur, but he briefly mentioned their months, for He had already stated everything there.<sup><xref rid="fn1307">317</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. AND THOU SHALT SACRIFICE THE PASSOVER-OFFERING UNTO THE ETERNAL THY G-D THE FLOCK AND THE HERD. Its purport<sup><xref rid="fn1308">318</xref></sup> by way of the plain meaning of Scripture is similar to the expressions: <italic>the ox, the sheep, and the goats</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1309">319</xref></sup> [which means: &#x201C;the ox, &#x2018;and&#x2019; the sheep &#x2026; &#x201D;]; <italic>Reuben, Simeon, Levi</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1310">320</xref></sup> [which means: &#x201C;Reuben, &#x2018;and&#x2019; Simeon, &#x2018;and&#x2019; Levi&#x201D;], And here it means: &#x201C;<italic>and thou shalt sacrifice the Passover-offering unto the Eternal thy G-d</italic>, &#x2018;and&#x2019; <italic>the flock and the herd</italic> [thou shalt bring for the Festal-offering,&#x201D; as will be explained]. Therefore, [because the flock and the herd are not used for the Passover-offering], he does not say &#x201C;and thou shalt sacrifice the Passover-offering unto the Eternal thy G-d, &#x2018;of&#x2019; the flock and &#x2018;of&#x2019; the herd,&#x201D; as He says in all places: <italic>ye shall bring your offering &#x2018;of&#x2019; the cattle, &#x2018;of&#x2019; the herd, or &#x2018;of&#x2019; the flock;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1311">321</xref></sup> <italic>and if his offering be &#x2018;of&#x2019; the flock;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1312">322</xref></sup> <italic>if he offer &#x2018;of&#x2019; the herd</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1313">323</xref></sup> But here he commands concerning the Passover-offering, which is the sheep as He has previously mentioned;<sup><xref rid="fn1314">324</xref></sup> and sheep and herd, rams and goats and calves, to celebrate the Festal-offering on that day, just as he commanded concerning the Festivals of Weeks and Tabernacles, saying, <italic>And thou shalt keep the Festival of Weeks unto the Eternal thy G-d after the measure of the freewill offering of thy hand</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1315">325</xref></sup> meaning that he shall bring herd and sheep as peace-offerings in accordance with his means. So also he said with reference to Tabernacles, <italic>Seven days shalt thou keep a feast unto the Eternal thy G-d</italic> etc.,<sup><xref rid="fn1316">326</xref></sup> and at the end he included all three [festivals] together.<sup><xref rid="fn1317">327</xref></sup> Similar to this [where the connecting letter <italic>vav</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;and&#x201D; is missing] is the verse: <italic>In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the Passover; a feast of seven days, unleavened bread shall be eaten</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1318">328</xref></sup> which means &#x201C; &#x2018;and&#x2019; a feast of seven days.&#x201D; We find this also in the Passover celebrated by King Josiah where it says, <italic>of the flock, lambs, and kids, all of them for the Passover-offerings &#x2026; and three thousand bullocks</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1319">329</xref></sup> and afterwards it says, <italic>And they roasted the Passover</italic> [-offering] <italic>with fire according to the ordinance, and the holy offerings they boiled in pots, and in cauldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the children of the people</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1320">330</xref></sup> Thus Scripture explained there that the lambs and kids were all for the Passover-offerings, not the goats themselves [that were older than a year] nor the herd, as it is written, <italic>Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year; ye shall take it from the sheep or from the goats</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1321">331</xref></sup> And Scripture explains that the herd that he mentioned were three thousand, and they were holy offerings which were boiled in pots to be carried quickly to the people <italic>to eat their fill</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1322">332</xref></sup> as our Rabbis have received by tradition concerning the Festal-offering.<sup><xref rid="fn1323">333</xref></sup> And Onkelos connected here [in the verse before us] the word <italic>flock</italic> with <italic>the Passover-offering</italic> [for he translated as follows: &#x201C;and thou shalt sacrifice the Passover-offering from the young lambs, and holy offerings from the herd&#x201D;]. But in that case the <italic>vav</italic> in the word <italic>u&#x2019;bakar</italic> (&#x201C;and&#x201D; the herd) does not connect itself well [with the word <italic>tzon</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;flock,&#x201D; since the connecting letter, <italic>vav</italic>, indicates that the herd and the flock were used for the same offerings, while Onkelos says that the flock was for the Passover-offering and the herd was for other types of offerings.]<sup><xref rid="fn1324">334</xref></sup> Moreover, the flock is not valid for the Passover-offering, [but only males less than a year old, so it is not correct to explain as Onkelos did that <italic>the flock</italic> was used for <italic>the Passover-offering</italic>]. The correct explanation is what we have said.</p>
<p>Now he explained here many things. Thus he mentioned concerning the unleavened bread that it be <italic>bread of affliction</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1325">335</xref></sup> teaching that he commanded to remember that they left [Egypt] in haste,<sup><xref rid="fn1325">335</xref></sup> and this [bread of] affliction is a remembrance that they were living in Egypt with <italic>sparing bread and scant water</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1326">336</xref></sup> Thus he alludes to two things [that they eat unleavened bread in order to remember that they went out in haste and there was no time for their dough to rise, and that they remember that they ate there &#x201C;bread of affliction&#x201D;]. And thus the Rabbis also said [in the Passover Hagadah]: &#x201C;This is the bread of affliction that our fathers ate in the land of Egypt.&#x201D; Or it may be that he is saying that the unleavened bread be made like bread of poverty [flour and water] and not like rich bread [kneaded with wine, oil or honey] as our Rabbis stated.<sup><xref rid="fn1327">337</xref></sup> And he also explained in the commandment pertaining to leaven that <italic>it shall not &#x2018;be seen&#x2019; with thee in &#x2018;all thy borders&#x2019;</italic> [<italic>seven days</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn1328">338</xref></sup> for at first He said, [<italic>seven days</italic>] <italic>shall there be no leaven &#x201C; &#x2018;found&#x2019; in your houses</italic>. &#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1329">339</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. NEITHER SHALL ANY OF THE FLESH, WHICH &#x2018;TIZBACH&#x2019; (THOU SACRIFICEST)<sup><xref rid="fn1330">340</xref></sup> THE FIRST DAY AT EVEN, REMAIN ALL NIGHT UNTIL THE MORNING. The meaning thereof is that you are not to leave overnight until morning any of the meat [i.e., the Passover-offering] with which you celebrated the festival<sup><xref rid="fn1331">341</xref></sup> on the evening of the first of the seven days mentioned. This [time of the celebration] was the night, as he stated, <italic>the Eternal thy G-d brought thee forth out of Egypt at night</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1332">342</xref></sup> [The word <italic>tizbach</italic> cannot mean &#x201C;which thou slaughterest&#x201D; or &#x201C;sacrificest&#x201D;] because he did not mention in this section the fourteenth day [of Nisan] and the slaughtering of the Passover-offering at all [which took place on the afternoon of the fourteenth]. Instead he mentioned the observance of the Passover<sup><xref rid="fn1332">342</xref></sup> at night, that is to say, the eating of the Passover-offering and the unleavened bread with it. The reason for [not mentioning the slaughter] is that the slaughtering of the Passover-offering and the burning of its sacrificial portion on the fourteenth day of Nisan are part of the commandment of the offerings, and these have already been mentioned in the law of the offerings; he did not repeat it here just as he did not restate the laws of the rest of the offerings. Neither did he mention here that [special] offerings are brought on the three festivals [because these relate to the laws of offerings], but he did mention to Israel [the laws] concerning the eating of the Passover-offering and the unleavened bread. So also, <italic>there &#x2018;tizbach&#x2019; the Passover-offering at even, at the going down of the sun</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1333">343</xref></sup> means: &#x201C;there you shall observe the feast of the Passover-offering at night, at the going down of the sun, for it is to be &#x2018;eaten&#x2019; at night.&#x201D; And he stated by way of explanation, <italic>And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the Eternal thy G-d shall choose; and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1334">344</xref></sup> I have already explained this in the section of <italic>This month shall be unto you the beginning of months</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1335">345</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is also possible that we explain [the verse before us], <italic>Neither shall any of the flesh, which &#x2018;tizbach&#x2019; the first day at &#x2018;erev&#x2019; remain until the morning</italic> as meaning: &#x201C;of the flesh which you slaughtered at <italic>erev</italic> (the afternoon),&#x201D; this being the afternoon preceding <italic>the morning</italic> [mentioned in the verse, i.e., the morning of the fifteenth day] which is thus the [afternoon of the] fourteenth day of Nisan. And he states, <italic>there &#x2018;tizbach&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>thou shalt sacrifice</italic>) <italic>the Passover-offering ba&#x2019;erev</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1333">343</xref></sup> [on the afternoon of the fourteenth day], for <italic>at the going down of the sun, at the season thou comest forth out of Egypt</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1333">343</xref></sup> &#x2014; <italic>then thou shalt roast and eat it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1336">346</xref></sup> He mentions just <italic>u&#x2019;bishalta</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1334">344</xref></sup> [which literally means &#x201C;and thou shalt boil&#x201D; or &#x201C;seethe&#x201D; &#x2014; a cooking process forbidden on the Passover-offering], since He has already explained there that it be prepared <italic>roast with fire</italic> and <italic>not boiled at all in water</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1337">347</xref></sup> If so, the expression here <italic>u&#x2019;bishalta</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1334">344</xref></sup> means &#x201C;and you shall cook it on fire according to the ordinance.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now he said, <italic>And on the seventh day</italic> [of Passover] <italic>shall be a solemn assembly to the Eternal thy G-d; thou shalt do no work therein</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1338">348</xref></sup> But he did not mention the prohibition of work on the first day [of Passover]; he likewise did not state such a prohibition for the Festival of Weeks, nor for Tabernacles, nor did he mention the commandment of the palm-branch [on the Festival of Tabernacles] and he likewise did not mention here the Day of Remembrance [i.e., the New Year] and the tenth of that month [i.e., the Day of Atonement] &#x2014; the reason, as I have explained, is that now he came to mention only the [commandment to make an] appearance [in the Sanctuary] and the [commandment of] festivity, for all Israelites are obligated to make a pilgrimage on these three festivals to the place which G-d shall choose and celebrate there <italic>every man as he is able, according to the blessing</italic> of G-d <italic>which He hath given</italic> him,<sup><xref rid="fn1339">349</xref></sup> to rejoice before Him, to thank for all the good <italic>which He hath bestowed on</italic> us <italic>according to his compassions, and according to the multitude of His mercies</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1340">350</xref></sup></p>
<p>He [Moses] added, <italic>and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1338">348</xref></sup> meaning: <italic>Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1338">348</xref></sup> and in addition to them is a solemn assembly on the seventh day, the purport being that they be further detained before Him to eat the unleavened bread. And because he said that [the seventh day] is <italic>Atzereth</italic> it might possibly mean that they be &#x201C;restrained&#x201D; only for the eating of the unleavened bread as on the [six] preceding days, therefore it was necessary to admonish [also in the same verse] that you are not to do work therein. Similarly He said with reference to the eighth day of the Festival of Tabernacles in the section on the festivals in the Book of Leviticus, <italic>Seven days ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the Eternal; on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you; and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the Eternal; it is a solemn assembly; ye shall do no manner of servile work</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1341">351</xref></sup> meaning that [the eighth day] is restrained in addition to the first [seven] days with respect to the bringing of a fire-offering, and it has a further prohibition against [doing therein any manner of] servile work, [a prohibition shared only by the first day of Tabernacles, but not by any of the intermediate days].</p>
<p>And by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala, the verse stating that the seventh day of Passover] <italic>Atzereth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1338">348</xref></sup> is &#x201C;the congregation of Israel,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1342">352</xref></sup> and the verse comes to each us the secret of the day. But it is not like <italic>Atzereth</italic> of the eighth day of Tabernacles, for the eighth day is a separate festival<sup><xref rid="fn1343">353</xref></sup> and the offering brought then, is for the congregation of Israel, but it is unlike the offerings brought on the seven days [of the Tabernacles]. The seventh day of Passover, however, is part of the Festival [of Passover] and it is <italic>Atzereth</italic>, for, sometimes it is counted as the eighth<sup><xref rid="fn1344">354</xref></sup> and sometimes it is included [as part of the seven]. Thus it is like the Sabbath in which there is the [commandment to] <italic>remember</italic> and [the commandment to] <italic>observe</italic>, the honor for the day and honor for the night.<sup><xref rid="fn1345">355</xref></sup> [Thus the offering on the seventh day of Passover is part of the festival], and therefore he said here, <italic>a solemn assembly to the Eternal thy G-d</italic>, while there [with reference to the eighth day of Tabernacles] it is said, <italic>and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the Eternal; it is a solemn assembly</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1341">351</xref></sup> meaning that the offering is the <italic>Atzereth</italic> and therefore &#x201C;the meal&#x201D; is small.<sup><xref rid="fn1346">356</xref></sup> The student learned in the mystic teachings of Cabala will understand.</p>
<p>He [Moses] did not mention here the eighth day of the Festival of Tabernacles, because it has already been mentioned, and [because] there is no obligation that we go up in pilgrimage to the Sanctuary another time [in honor of the eighth day].</p>
<p>9. FROM THE TIME THE SICKLE IS FIRST PUT TO THE STANDING CORN. The meaning thereof is &#x201C;from the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing corn,&#x201D; seeing that He has already mentioned when we are to begin to raise the sickle upon the standing corn in bringing the <italic>omer</italic> [a measure of the new barley brought as a meal-offering on the second day of Passover] which is <italic>the first-fruit of</italic> our <italic>harvest</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1347">357</xref></sup> and the Midrash [of this verse] is:<sup><xref rid="fn1348">358</xref></sup> &#x201C;It teaches that the <italic>omer</italic> be reaped only with a sickle.&#x201D; He mentions here [that you are to rejoice] <italic>in the place which the Eternal thy G-d shall choose to cause His Name to dwell there</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1349">359</xref></sup> and likewise he said, <italic>Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the Eternal thy G-d in the place which He shall choose</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1350">360</xref></sup> Now, I do not know whether this is to state that after the Sanctuary will be built we should not assemble to bring the festival-offerings except in that place which G-d has chosen, similar to what he said, <italic>Thou mayest not sacrifice the Passover-offering within any of thy gates</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1351">361</xref></sup> or that he is explaining here that they are not obligated to go up in pilgrimage on the festivals until such time as G-d will have chosen the place to dwell there.<sup><xref rid="fn1352">362</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. AND THOU SHALT REMEMBER THAT THOU WAST A BONDMAN IN EGYPT. Rabbi Abraham [ibn Ezra] said that this phrase is connected with the expression <italic>and thy manservant, and thy maidservant</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1353">363</xref></sup> [mentioned in the first part of the preceding verse]. The correct interpretation is according to the plain meaning thereof, that you are to observe <italic>these statutes</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1354">364</xref></sup> which the Lord <italic>Who redeemed thee out of the house of bondage</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1355">365</xref></sup> commanded you. We also proclaim in the <italic>Kiddush</italic> of that [festival] day, &#x201C;It is a memorial of the exodus from Egypt.&#x201D; He stated <italic>these statutes</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1354">364</xref></sup> with reference to the Festival of Weeks [an expression not used with reference to the other festivals] because the reason for the counting of seven weeks, and the observing of only the fiftieth day as the only solemn assembly is not mentioned in the Torah [and hence they are accounted as <italic>chukim</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;statutes,&#x201D; commandments for which we do not know the reasons, and therefore he warned us to observe and do <italic>these statutes</italic>].

Ramban, however, holds the verse, <italic>Ye shall not do so</italic> etc., to be only an admonition against erasing G-d&#x2019;s Name, and that such is also the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Yishmael&#x2019;s words quoted by Rashi are a clarification, teaching that &#x201C;erasing the Divine Name is equivalent to dismantling a stone of the Divine altar.&#x201D; Furthermore, the text quoted by Rashi in the name of Rabbi Yishmael is attributed by the Sifre to Rabban Gamaliel, which perforce is only a homiletic statement, that sinning is tantamount to destruction of G-d&#x2019;s altar. Hence the same text in Rashi must also be understood in the same light (Mizrachi).</ftnote>

The Levite in turn sets aside a tenth of that tithe for the priest, which is called &#x201C;the heave-offering of the tithe&#x201D; (<italic>terumath ma&#x2019;aseir</italic>).

<ftnote id="fn1024">(34) Further, Verse 17. Now, in view of the fact that the First Tithe and the heave-offering may be eaten everywhere, the Rabbis apply this verse &#x2014; which prohibits eating them outside Jerusalem &#x2014; to the eating of <italic>unredeemed</italic> Second Tithes outside Jerusalem, and to a priest&#x2019;s eating of <italic>first-fruits</italic> outside Jerusalem (Makkoth 18a); see also &#x201C;The Commandments,&#x201D; Vol. II, pp. 131-140, for various prohibitions included in this verse. Thus here again <italic>the heave-offering of thine hand</italic> is interpreted as referring to the first-fruits, as explained by Rashi in the verse before us.

<ftnote id="fn1031">(41) This is further proof that the word <italic>terumah</italic> is not limited to the heave-offering given to the priest from the produce of the field, but that it may also signify any donation or offering that a person gives to the Sanctuary. The expression in the verse before us <italic>heave-offering of your hand</italic> thus denotes the setting aside of any valuables for a sacred purpose.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1032">(42) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, 25:2. In this case the word <italic>terumah</italic> denotes &#x201C;something set apart&#x201D; for the construction of the Tabernacle.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1036">(46) In this concluding sentence Ramban reiterates the central theme of his interpretation &#x2014; that the entire verse refers to categories that require consumption within the wall of Jerusalem. Thus <italic>the tithes</italic> refers to the Second Tithe and the tithe of cattle, <italic>and heave-offering of your hand</italic> denotes the donations for the offerings which also require a certain location where they may be eaten &#x2014; the holiest offerings within the Sanctuary Court, and those of lesser holiness within the city of Jerusalem.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1037">(47) I.e., commentators. In our texts of Ibn Ezra this expression is missing. Ramban&#x2019;s version, however, is correct, since Ibn Ezra himself later refutes that explanation. Therefore, it is obvious that he refers to an opinion previously quoted.</ftnote>

Hence Hezekiah asks for <italic>a sign</italic> that he will yet go up to the Sanctuary, while the king of Babylon seeks to inquire of <italic>the wonder</italic> which happened.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1171">(181) A form of reasoning from &#x201C;a minor&#x201D; to &#x201C;a major&#x201D; matter. See Vol. II, p. 133, Note 208. Here it would apply as follows: If in those sins that bear less severe punishment [beheading in the case of an apostate city, etc.] the Torah requires &#x201C;inquiry&#x201D; and &#x201C;investigation&#x201D; of the witnesses, they are surely required in cases where the punishment is more severe, such as stoning.

<ftnote id="fn1174">(184) The &#x201C;investigations&#x201D; related to matters incidental to the crime, such as how the victim was dressed. In the case of &#x201C;the seven inquiries&#x201D; (see preceding note) if one of the witnesses said &#x201C;I do not know,&#x201D; their testimony becomes invalid. But in the examinations, even if both did not know, their evidence was still valid. However, if they contradicted each other in examinations, their evidence was invalid. The number of investigatory questions is unlimited. In fact, &#x201C;the more a judge examines the evidence, the more he is deserving of praise&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1276">(286) A declaration made before a court by a creditor and signed by witnesses to the effect that the loan in question would not be cancelled by the law of release of the Sabbatical year. The <italic>prozbul&#x2019;s</italic> legal basis is the Torah&#x2019;s prohibition that the <italic>creditor</italic> shall not exact the debt; by turning over his claims to the court, it is they, the officers of the court, who collect it and not the creditor (Rashi, Gittin 36a). It was Hillel who established this ordinance because people refused to lend money to the poor on the seventh year for fear that the debts would be remitted, thus transgressing the law of the Torah against being callous to the condition of the poor (<italic>ibid.</italic>, 36a).

<ftnote id="fn1278">(288) Ramban thus differs with Rashi in his interpretation of the Sifre. Rashi understood it to be a positive commandment to exact the debt from the heathen. Ramban argues that whether one exacts payment of his claim from a heathen is wholly a matter of choice. He explains the dictum of the Sifre as follows: Scripture explicitly ordained a prohibition against exacting a debt from an Israelite [<italic>he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother</italic>]. Now, by Scripture stating <italic>of an alien thou shalt exact it</italic>, we infer that one may not exact it from an Israelite, and since a negative commandment that is derived by implication from a positive commandment has the force of the positive injunction from which it is derived &#x2014; it follows that he, who exacts it from an Israelite, violates both an explicit negative commandment and an implied positive commandment. This is the intent of the Sifre, but not as stated by Rashi that there is a positive commandment to exact it from the heathen. See &#x201C;The Commandments,&#x201D; Vol. I, pp. 150-151, where Rashi&#x2019;s position coincides with that of Rambam, and Ramban differs with him.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1345">(355) See Vol. II, pp. 308-309.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1346">(356) This is a reference to the fact that the Additional Offering on the eighth day of Tabernacles was smaller than those of the preceding seven days, and also smaller than the Additional Offering of the seventh day of Passover.</ftnote>

<p>18. JUDGES &#x2018;V&#x2019;SHOTRIM&#x2019; SHALT THOU MAKE THEE IN ALL THY GATES WHICH THE ETERNAL THY G-D GIVETH THEE. He has commanded in the Torah, <italic>the word of both parties shall come before ha&#x2019;elohim</italic> (<italic>the judges</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn1357">1</xref></sup> <italic>and he shall pay as the judges determine</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1358">2</xref></sup> If so, He commanded [by implication] that Israel is to have judges, and here he [Moses] explained that they are to appoint judges in all their cities when G-d will give them the Land. For outside of the Land they are not required to appoint a court for themselves; rather, when an aggrieved party complains, people qualified to judge are to arise for him and <italic>according to</italic> their <italic>ordinances shall they judge it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1359">3</xref></sup> Or the parties are to go up to the Land in the proper time [i.e., when there are courts of ordained judges functioning in the Land of Israel],<sup><xref rid="fn1360">4</xref></sup> and there, they will adjudicate it in the place of righteousness. He added here [that it is obligatory to appoint] <italic>shotrim</italic>, who are the ones that execute the judgment.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Israelites living outside of the Land are not commanded to appoint for themselves judges in the cities. And so wrote Harav Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon.<sup><xref rid="fn1361">5</xref></sup> But in Tractate Makkoth the Rabbis have taught:<sup><xref rid="fn1362">6</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1363">7</xref></sup> This teaches that the laws of Sanhedrin are binding both within and without the Land. If so, why is it stated <italic>Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates? In</italic> the Land you are to appoint [judges] in every district and in every city; <italic>outside</italic> the Land you are to appoint [judges] in every district, but you are not obligated to do so in every city.&#x201D; From this text it would appear that we are required to appoint a Sanhedrin outside the Land &#x2014; not in every city as in the Land of Israel, but in every district. If so, this commandment is binding at all times in civil cases and in matters that may be adjudicated outside the Land. Nowadays, however, that ordination has ceased,<sup><xref rid="fn1364">8</xref></sup> since, according to Torah-law, all judicial functions are void &#x2014; for it is written, &#x201C;[<italic>And these are the ordinances which thou shalt set</italic>] <italic>before them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1365">9</xref></sup> and not before commoners &#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1366">10</xref></sup> and we [not being ordained,] are commoners, and would not be empowered to adjudicate outside the Land except for the Rabbinical ordinance that we &#x201C;carry out the commission of the former ones [who had received ordination]&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1367">11</xref></sup> &#x2014; we are not at all bound, according to Torah-law, by the commandment to appoint judges.</p>
<p>THROUGHOUT THY TRIBES. &#x201C;This refers to the expression [at the beginning of the verse] <italic>shalt thou make thee</italic>. This teaches that courts are to be set up in each and every tribe, and in each and every city.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language, and so it is also stated in Tractate Sanhedrin.<sup><xref rid="fn1368">12</xref></sup> But I know not the meaning of this text, for, since we have appointed courts in each and every city, there are many courts in every tribe [thus making it redundant to specify &#x201C;throughout thy tribes&#x201D;]&#x0021; Perhaps the intent of the verse is to state that if there is a city belonging to two tribes, such as Jerusalem in which there is a share for [the tribe of] Judah and [for the tribe of] Benjamin,<sup><xref rid="fn1369">13</xref></sup> that we are to seat two courts therein. And so the Rabbis concluded in Chapter <italic>Cheilek</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1370">14</xref></sup> that they may divide one city among two tribes, and so, indeed, was Jerusalem shared by Judah and Benjamin.</p>
<p>And it is possible to explain that Scripture obligated [the nation] to appoint a court [exercising authority] over the whole tribe and it is to judge all [its people], and then we are to appoint a court for each and every city that is to judge that [particular] city. Now, although all these courts were alike in number of judges, consisting of twenty-three in criminal cases and three in civil cases, [people] most superior in wisdom among them were appointed over the whole tribe, while those inferior to them [were designated for the courts] of each and every city. Parties to a suit could force one another to adjudicate only before the court in their city, not before the court of another city. Even if both parties happened to be in another city one could still say, &#x201C;Let us go before the court of our own city.&#x201D; But the [supreme] court of the tribe could force any of the people of that tribe to stand trial before it. And even if the litigants are in their own city one can still say, &#x201C;I want to go to the Great Court of the tribe.&#x201D; Similarly, if the courts of the cities are in doubt [concerning the law], they are to come before the Great Court of the tribe and request [its decision]. Thus just as a Great Sanhedrin [of seventy-one judges] was appointed over all courts of all Israel, so one [supreme] court was to be appointed over each and every tribe. And if [the judges of that court] found it necessary to ordain or decree any matter for their own tribe, they were empowered to so decree and ordain and, to that tribe, their word was equivalent to the decree of the Great Sanhedrin over all Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn1371">15</xref></sup> This is &#x201C;the court&#x201D; mentioned in Tractate Horayoth wherein we are taught, &#x201C;If the court of one of the tribes rendered a decision [that was unwittingly contrary to a negative commandment, punishable by excision] and that tribe acted according to their word, that tribe is obligated [to bring the prescribed offering], but the rest of the tribes are not liable.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1372">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>And by way of the plain meaning of Scripture the sense of the verse is [to be inverted as follows]: &#x201C;Judges and officers shalt thou make thee throughout all thy tribes in all thy gates,&#x201D; the verse stating that they are to appoint judges over their tribes, and they are to judge in all their gates. Thus the judges of the tribe are to judge in all its cities.</p>
<p>20. JUSTICE, JUSTICE SHALT THOU PURSUE. &#x201C;Go to seek a reliable court. THAT THOU MAYEST LIVE, AND INHERIT THE LAND. The appointment of qualified judges is of sufficient [importance] to sustain Israel and to settle them upon their Land.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language quoting from the Sifre.<sup><xref rid="fn1373">17</xref></sup> The reason for the repetition [of the word &#x201C;justice&#x201D;] is to indicate that the judges should <italic>judge the people with righteous judgment</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1374">18</xref></sup> and you must also pursue justice constantly by going from your place to the place of the great Sages: &#x201C;after Rabban<sup><xref rid="fn1375">19</xref></sup> Yochanan ben Zaccai to Jabneh; after Rabbi [Yehudah Hanasi] to Beth Shearim.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1376">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>And Rabbi Abraham [ibn Ezra] commented: &#x201C;<italic>Justice, justice</italic>. It is mentioned twice in order to indicate that one should pursue justice whether it would be to his advantage or loss. Or [it may be mentioned] one time after another for emphasis.&#x201D; But in the Midrash of Rabbi Nechunya ben Hakanah<sup><xref rid="fn1377">21</xref></sup> the Rabbis interpreted it by way of a secret. They said: &#x201C;<italic>Justice</italic> &#x2014; this is His attribute of justice in the world, as it is said, <italic>Justice, justice shalt thou pursue</italic>. After that it is written, <italic>that thou mayest live, and inherit the Land</italic>. If you will judge yourself [knowing whence you came, and whither you are going, and before Whom you are about to give account and reckoning]<sup><xref rid="fn1378">22</xref></sup> you will live. If not, He will judge you and affirm [His judgment over you] against your will. And why is <italic>justice</italic> mentioned twice? Because it is written, <italic>from the brightness before Him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1379">23</xref></sup> The first <italic>justice</italic> refers to actual justice, this being the Divine Glory, as it is written, <italic>righteousness lodges in her</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1380">24</xref></sup> And what is the second <italic>justice</italic>? It is that which frightens the righteous&#x201D; [making them fearful that perhaps they do not merit the World to Come].<sup><xref rid="fn1381">25</xref></sup> And there [in that Midrash] it is further explained:<sup><xref rid="fn1382">26</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Justice</italic> is <italic>the helmet of salvation upon His head</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1383">27</xref></sup> The &#x2018;head&#x2019; denotes only truth, as it is said, <italic>The beginning of Thy word is truth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1384">28</xref></sup> and &#x2018;truth&#x2019; is peace, as it is said, <italic>Is it not so, if peace and truth shall be in my days?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1385">29</xref></sup> etc.&#x201D; If so, Scripture is stating here, &#x201C;You are to judge in your court [to attain] justice, and pursue therein justice and [try to] achieve it, <italic>that thou mayest live</italic> in the World to Come with the second justice [which alludes to Him]<sup><xref rid="fn1386">30</xref></sup> Who is the Higher Justice, this being the great light hidden for the righteous for the Time to Come, and this is also the Might of the Holy One, blessed be He; <italic>and thou shalt inherit the Land</italic>, the Land of Israel, with the first justice.&#x201D;</p>
<p>21. THOU SHALT NOT PLANT THEE AN ASHEIRAH. Any tree planted at the entrance of a house of G-d is called <italic>asheirah</italic>. Possibly because it <italic>ordereth the way aright</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1387">31</xref></sup> directing people&#x2019;s &#x201C;steps&#x201D; [to worship], it is called [<italic>asheirah</italic>] from the word <italic>&#x2018;ashurai&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>my steps</italic>) <italic>have held fast to Thy paths</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1388">32</xref></sup> Scripture thus admonishes not to plant a tree beside the altar of G-d for beauty and to think that it is an honor and glory to G-d&#x2019;s altar. He prohibited it because it was a custom of the idolaters to plant trees at the entrances of their idol&#x2019;s temples, as it is written, further, <italic>and throw down the altar of Baal that belongs to thy father, and cut down the asheirah that is by it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1389">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now Rashi wrote: &#x201C;<italic>Thou shalt not plant thee an asheirah</italic>. This is intended to make one liable [to punishment] from the very moment of planting; and even if he does not worship it, he transgresses a negative commandment for planting it. And thou shalt not plant <italic>any kind of tree beside the altar of the Eternal thy G-d</italic>. This is an admonition against planting [trees] or building a [wooden] house on the Temple mount.&#x201D; If so, Scripture is stating: &#x201C;<italic>thou shalt not plant thee an asheirah</italic> &#x2018;nor&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1390">34</xref></sup> <italic>any kind of tree beside the altar of the Eternal</italic>.&#x201D; But building a [wooden] house on the Temple mount is [prohibited by] Rabbinic ordinance based on Scriptural support, for Scripture prohibited only the &#x201C;planting&#x201D; &#x2014; &#x201C;<italic>thou shalt not plant thee an asheirah</italic> [prohibiting the planting anywhere of trees intended for idol-worship], nor shalt thou plant thee <italic>any tree</italic> [for whatever purpose] <italic>beside the altar of the Eternal thy G-d</italic>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>22. NEITHER SHALT THOU SET THEE UP A PILLAR &#x2014; &#x201C;a pillar of one stone, even for the purpose of sacrificing to Heaven upon it. WHICH THE ETERNAL THY G-D HATETH. <italic>An altar of earth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1391">35</xref></sup> and <italic>an altar of stones</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1392">36</xref></sup> has He commanded you to make, but He hates this [one-stone pillar] because it was an ordinance of the Canaanites [for idol-worship]. Although it was pleasing to Him at the time of the patriarchs,<sup><xref rid="fn1393">37</xref></sup> He hates it now, because these [Canaanites] have made it an ordinance in the worship of the idols.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. If so, Scripture prohibited [the planting of] an <italic>asheirah</italic> [anywhere], it enjoined against planting [trees] on the Temple mount although the intent be to Heaven, and it prohibited a pillar [erected] for Heaven &#x2014; both [prohibitions, against trees and against pillars,] on account of the ordinances of the Canaanites. But I have not understood this ordinance, for the Canaanites used altars as well as pillars since Scripture states, <italic>And ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1394">38</xref></sup> <italic>for ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1395">39</xref></sup> and similarly in all places; [hence all altars should have been prohibited even for the worship of G-d]&#x0021; Perhaps we may say that the Canaanites were primarily devoted to pillars, and they had no idolatrous temple without a pillar upon which to sacrifice and pour oil upon its top,<sup><xref rid="fn1393">37</xref></sup> similar to what is stated with reference to Baal, <italic>And they brought forth the pillars that were in the house of Baal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1396">40</xref></sup> However, only a few of their temples also had altars upon which to sacrifice [hence Scripture did not prohibit altars built to be used for Heaven].</p>
<p>It appears to me that the Canaanites, who were engrossed in idolatry, used to make in all temples of their gods an altar on which to bring sacrifices, erected a large stone at the entrance of the temple for the priests to stand upon, and planted a tree outside it to point the way for those who come there. They still do so to this day. Now <italic>the Glorious Name</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1397">41</xref></sup> hates and despises all their deeds and He prohibited the pillar and the <italic>asheirah</italic>. He left only the altar because it is a necessity for the offerings concerning which He commanded. They were a source of pleasure before Him &#x2014; because He ordained them and His Will was done &#x2014; even prior to the existence of idol-worship on earth.<sup><xref rid="fn1398">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHICH THE ETERNAL THY G-D HATETH. The purport thereof is that he is explaining that G-d had commanded, <italic>an altar of earth shalt thou make unto Me</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1391">35</xref></sup> <italic>And if thou make Me an altar of stones</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1392">36</xref></sup> and so, Moses explained, He desires these [altars] excluding the pillar. He hates it because, all their deeds being detestable before Him, He commanded Israel not to copy their deeds. In the days of Jacob, however, the prohibition <italic>Neither shall ye walk in their statutes</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1399">43</xref></sup> had not yet been ordained and he, therefore, used the pillar in worshipping G-d<sup><xref rid="fn1393">37</xref></sup> as was the custom of those who worshipped [the True G-d in the days of Jacob]. This commandment is thus understood as proceeding from the verse, <italic>And if thou make Me an altar of stones</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1392">36</xref></sup> But what He said in the Torah, <italic>Neither shall ye erect a graven image, or a pillar</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1400">44</xref></sup> refers to a graven image and a pillar in order to place the graven image upon the pedestal for idol-worship, for there Scripture is speaking of idol-worship. He says [there], however, <italic>Neither shall ye place any figured stone in your Land to bow down unto it</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1400">44</xref></sup> &#x2014; even to Heaven, because he would appear to worship the mosaics themselves, for the same reason that an <italic>asheirah</italic> [is prohibited], because it is among the [idolatrous] statutes of the peoples.</p>
<p>Know that an altar is a high structure of stones having four horns, a base, and a circuit above its base, and offerings are burnt between its horns. A pillar is a single large stone which they raise up upon which to burn [incense] or bring offerings, or for the priests to stand upon. A <italic>bamah</italic> (a high place) is like a mountain &#x2014; they make it of assembled earth and, upon it, an altar is built upon which to sacrifice. Everything which is lofty and high is so named: <italic>I will ascend above &#x2018;bamathei&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the heights of</italic>) <italic>the clouds;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1401">45</xref></sup> <italic>upon &#x2018;bamathei&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the high places of</italic>) <italic>the earth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1402">46</xref></sup> The back of a human being is also called <italic>bamah</italic>, as it is said, <italic>upon &#x2018;bamatheimo&#x2019; thou shalt tread</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1403">47</xref></sup> Similarly Scripture states, <italic>And the king</italic> [Solomon] <italic>went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great &#x2018;bamah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>high place</italic>); <italic>a thousand burnt-offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1404">48</xref></sup></p>
<h1>17</h1>
<p>1. THOU SHALT NOT SACRIFICE UNTO THE ETERNAL THY G-D [AN OX, OR A SHEEP, WHEREIN IS A BLEMISH], EVEN ANY &#x2018;DAVAR&#x2019; (THING) THAT IS EVIL. &#x201C;This is an admonition against causing offerings to be rendered unfit through an improper utterance.<sup><xref rid="fn1405">49</xref></sup> There are yet other interpretations given by the Rabbis [on this verse] in the Tractate <italic>Shechithath Kadashim</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1406">50</xref></sup> This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. Now this is an explanatory commandment, for He has already admonished against slaughtering blemished offerings,<sup><xref rid="fn1407">51</xref></sup> and here he repeated it in order to add the admonition against rendering it unfit by an utterance. It is likely that he repeated this admonition in order that the Israelite who brings the offering should not render it unfit during the slaughter [since non-priests were permitted to slaughter offerings]. The priests themselves, however, are scrupulous and careful, one warning sufficing for them. Therefore he did not repeat the prohibition against a blemished ministering priest [performing the Divine Service].</p>
<p>FOR THAT IS AN ABOMINATION UNTO THE ETERNAL THY G-D. The term &#x201C;abomination&#x201D; refers to this offering, for whoever offers a corrupted thing is held in contempt, as it is stated in the Prophets,<sup><xref rid="fn1408">52</xref></sup> <italic>And cursed be he that dealeth craftily, whereas he hath in his flock a male, and voweth and sacrificeth unto the Eternal a blemished thing, for I am a great King</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1409">53</xref></sup> And according to the Midrash<sup><xref rid="fn1410">54</xref></sup> the term &#x201C;abomination&#x201D; refers to an animal that did, or was the object of perversion, or was the hire of a harlot or the price of a dog<sup><xref rid="fn1411">55</xref></sup> &#x2014; all of which are &#x201C;abominations.&#x201D;</p>
<p>2. IF THERE BE FOUND IN THE MIDST OF THEE WITHIN ANY OF THY GATES WHICH THE ETERNAL THY G-D GIVETH THEE. I have already explained<sup><xref rid="fn1412">56</xref></sup> that when he speaks of the ordinances he mentions first the judgment to be executed upon the idols or their worshippers. He states [here] <italic>within any of thy gates which the Eternal thy G-d giveth thee</italic>, not to imply that this law applies only in the Land of Israel, since one who worships idols outside the Land is also liable to stoning. The purport thereof is rather to state, &#x201C;if the matter be found in one of the distant cities which G-d will give you <italic>when He will enlarge thy border</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1413">57</xref></sup> &#x2014; <italic>and it be told thee, and thou hear it</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1414">58</xref></sup> in whatever city you may be, you are to investigate the matter diligently and if you discover that the charge is true, you shall bring them forth to that city wherein they worshipped, and stone them.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1415">59</xref></sup> He states <italic>that such abomination was done in Israel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1414">58</xref></sup> [implying that it is done within the nation rather than within the Land] in order to hold the worshipper [of the idols] culpable even outside the Land, for in the case of the apostate city he said, <italic>that such abomination is done &#x2018;in thy midst,&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1416">60</xref></sup> [within the Land], but here he mentioned <italic>within any of thy gates</italic> [a term generally limited to the Land] for it refers to common events as we have explained, and then he states <italic>in Israel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1414">58</xref></sup> in order to teach that it is binding upon the entire [nation of] Israel [even outside the Land]. It was also necessary to state <italic>within any of thy gates</italic> in order to teach that the worshipper be stoned at the gates [of the city] in which he worshipped the idols.<sup><xref rid="fn1417">61</xref></sup> This is [the law] in the Land, for outside the Land he is stoned at the entrance of the court where he was judged.</p>
<p>Now, this commandment is explanatory, since He already stated <italic>He that sacrificeth unto the gods shall be utterly destroyed</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1418">62</xref></sup> this applying in every place and at every time. Therefore he repeated it in order to explain what must be added to the commandment, but he abbreviated regarding matters previously mentioned.</p>
<p>And by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], it is possible that he mentioned <italic>within any of thy gates</italic> because he stated <italic>in transgressing His covenant</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1419">63</xref></sup> this [transgression] being <italic>the abomination done in</italic> [the Land of] <italic>Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1414">58</xref></sup> Scripture made it known that the covenant is in <italic>the Land of the covenant</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1420">64</xref></sup> whereas he who lives outside the Land is as if he worshipped idols.<sup><xref rid="fn1421">65</xref></sup> I have already mentioned this subject.<sup><xref rid="fn1422">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>He mentioned <italic>man or woman</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1419">63</xref></sup> because, due to a woman&#x2019;s frivolity, she can be enticed into idol-worship through a sign or wonder done before her, the proof being the case of the women before Jeremiah.<sup><xref rid="fn1423">67</xref></sup> Similarly, with reference to [the witchcraft of] the <italic>ov</italic> (ghost) or <italic>yide&#x2019;oni</italic> (familiar spirit), Scripture mentioned <italic>or a woman</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1424">68</xref></sup> because these forms of sorcery were customarily practiced by women, as He said, <italic>Thou shalt not suffer a sorceress to live</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1425">69</xref></sup> [even though both male and female sorcerers are equally liable].<sup><xref rid="fn1426">70</xref></sup> And in the Sifre<sup><xref rid="fn1427">71</xref></sup> the Rabbis interpret that [the reason for the expression <italic>or a woman</italic> is] because, having said in the case of an inciter <italic>Certain base &#x2018;men&#x2019; are gone out from the midst of thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1428">72</xref></sup> implying that this law [of the apostate city] is not the same for [the inciters if they were] women,<sup><xref rid="fn1429">73</xref></sup> it was necessary to explain that regarding an idol-worshipper the law is the same for man and woman.</p>
<p>The meaning of the expression <italic>which I have commanded not</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1430">74</xref></sup> is already explained.<sup><xref rid="fn1431">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AT THE MOUTH OF TWO WITNESSES, OR THREE WITNESSES, SHALL HE THAT IS TO DIE BE PUT TO DEATH. &#x201C;If the evidence can be sustained by two witnesses, why did Scripture specify &#x2018;three?&#x2019; It is to liken three to two: just as the evidence of two witnesses forms a single unit of testimony, so does the evidence of three, constitute a single unit of testimony and they are not subject to the law of plotting witnesses [which declares that whatever they plotted to do to their brother should be done to them]<sup><xref rid="fn1432">76</xref></sup> unless all three are proven to be plotters.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1433">77</xref></sup> This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. So also the principle [of a single unit of testimony] applies if one of the witnesses is found to be a kinsman [and hence ineligible to testify] or to have some other disqualification &#x2014; the testimony of all is void. If they are proven to have been plotting witnesses, [in which case] all of them are subject to the death-penalty or payment of money [as the case may be, and the third witness cannot claim immunity because of his argument that even had he not testified the evidence of the first two witnesses was sufficient to sustain the charge], since the main intent of Scripture was to liken the evidence of three witnesses to that of two in every respect, according to the opinion of our Rabbis.<sup><xref rid="fn1434">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>And the Gaon Rav Saadia<sup><xref rid="fn1435">79</xref></sup> said, by way of the plain meaning of Scripture, that the interpretation of the verse is as follows: &#x201C;<italic>two witnesses, or three</italic> judges who [officially] accept the testimony of the two <italic>witnesses</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1436">80</xref></sup> But there is in the verse no mention of acceptance of the testimony; instead, it refers explicitly to <italic>witnesses</italic>. But it seems to me that the Gaon erred in his [statement of this] law, for testimony in capital cases cannot be accepted except in the presence of a Sanhedrin of twenty-three judges [and not, as Rav Saadia holds, before only three judges]&#x0021; Rather, the plain meaning of the verse is that the condemned man shall be put to death <italic>at the mouth of two witnesses</italic> if no more are there, <italic>or</italic> at the mouth of <italic>three witnesses</italic> if three witnesses are to be found there. Scripture thus states: when <italic>it will be told thee, and thou hear it</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1414">58</xref></sup> you are to inquire diligently into the matter by means of the testimony of all the witnesses found there. Thus if we heard that he transgressed in the presence of three people, we should send for them and have them all come to court and testify. The same law applies to a hundred, for by hearing the words of them all, the truth will become clear. But if not more [than two] were present, or they [the others] left and are not to be found, then two are sufficient.</p>
<p>8. IF THERE ARISE A MATTER TOO HARD FOR THEE IN JUDGMENT, BETWEEN BLOOD AND BLOOD, BETWEEN PLEA AND PLEA, AND BETWEEN PLAGUE AND PLAGUE, MATTERS OF CONTROVERSY WITHIN THY GATES. &#x201C;<italic>Matters of controversy</italic> &#x2014; if the Sages of the city disagree over the matter, this one declaring it unclean and that one declaring it clean, this one convicting and that one acquitting.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. It is also the opinion of Onkelos [who translated: <italic>matters of controversy</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;disagreement among the judges&#x201D;]. But it is not correct.<sup><xref rid="fn1437">81</xref></sup> Rather, according to the Midrash thereof<sup><xref rid="fn1438">82</xref></sup> it means as follows: &#x201C;<italic>Between blood and blood</italic>, [the Sages disagree whether the blood in question is clean or unclean, the blood being any of the following]: the blood of a menstruous woman, the blood of a woman in childbirth, or the blood of a woman suffering a flux. <italic>Between plea and plea</italic>, [they disagree concerning the verdict in] civil cases, capital cases, and laws of scourging. <italic>And between plague and plague</italic>, [concerning] plagues of man, plagues of houses, and plagues of garments. <italic>Matters of controversy</italic>, giving the water to a suspected adulteress,<sup><xref rid="fn1439">83</xref></sup> the breaking of the heifer&#x2019;s neck,<sup><xref rid="fn1440">84</xref></sup> and the purifying of the leper.&#x201D; Thus the meaning of the word <italic>between</italic> [<italic>&#x2018;between&#x2019; blood and blood</italic>] is &#x201C;and between,&#x201D; [the verse stating: <italic>If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment</italic>, &#x201C;and&#x201D; <italic>between blood and blood</italic>, since the phrase <italic>between blood and blood</italic> is a new category, and not in apposition to the first part of the verse]. The letter <italic>lamed</italic> [in the words <italic>l&#x2019;dam</italic> which literally means &#x201C;in regard to blood&#x201D; and <italic>l&#x2019;din</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;in regard to a plea&#x201D;] has the usage here of a <italic>beth</italic> [meaning &#x201C;among&#x201D;], &#x201C;between blood &#x2018;among&#x2019; blood, plea &#x2018;among&#x2019; pleas,&#x201D; meaning, should a case arise concerning one [form of blood] among the various forms of blood, or concerning one [plea] among the various pleas, [a case that will be too difficult for you to decide]. A similar usage [of a <italic>lamed</italic> serving as <italic>beth</italic> is found in these verses:] <italic>but the name of the city was Luz &#x2018;larishonah&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1441">85</xref></sup> [literally: &#x201C; &#x2018;to&#x2019; the beginning&#x201D;] means <italic>barishonah</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;in the beginning;&#x201D; <italic>the Eternal smote him in his bowels &#x2018;lacholi l&#x2019;ein marpei&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1442">86</xref></sup> [literally: &#x201C;to an incurable disease&#x201D;] means <italic>bacholi b&#x2019;ein marpei</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;with an incurable disease;&#x201D; <italic>and he covered it with fine gold &#x2018;l&#x2019;chikarim&#x2019;</italic> [literally: &#x201C;to talents&#x201D;] <italic>six hundred</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1443">87</xref></sup> means <italic>b&#x2019;chikarim</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;with talents.&#x201D; There are many similar cases. Or it may be that the meaning of the word <italic>between</italic> [<italic>&#x2018;between&#x2019; blood and blood</italic> etc.] is &#x201C;between [a certain flow of] blood in regard to all other bloods, between [a certain kind of] plea in regard to all pleas.&#x201D; Similarly, <italic>and whensoever any controversy shall come to you from your brethren, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances, ye shall warn them, that they not be guilty towards the Eternal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1444">88</xref></sup></p>
<p>And in line with the plain meaning of Scripture the verse means: <italic>between blood and blood</italic>, matters of bloodshed; [<italic>between plea and plea</italic>] in civil cases; [<italic>and between plague and plague</italic>]cases of wounds and bruises [i.e., bodily injury] &#x2014; all matters of controversy that shall be in your cities. Scripture thus speaks of common occurrences, for in the matters of ordinances [cases between man and his neighbor], more disagreements will arise than in other decisions. The law of the elder [who rebels against the decision of the highest court] is, however, alike in all cases. Therefore He said, <italic>And thou shalt do according to the Torah</italic> (<italic>law</italic>) <italic>which they shall teach thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1445">89</xref></sup> for the word &#x201C;Torah&#x201D; alludes to the rest of the decisions.</p>
<p>11. THOU SHALT NOT DEPART FROM THE WORD WHICH THEY SHALL TELL THEE, TO THE RIGHT NOR TO THE LEFT. &#x201C;Even if he [the judge of the Great Sanhedrin] tells you of the right that it is the left, or about the left that it is the right [you must obey him].&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. The purport thereof is that even if you think in your heart that they are mistaken, and the matter is simple in your eyes just as you know [the difference] between your right hand and your left hand, you must still do as they command you. You are not to say: &#x201C;How can I [permit myself to] eat this real forbidden fat, or execute this innocent man;&#x201D; instead you are to say, &#x201C;The Lord Who enjoined the commandments commanded that I perform all His commandments in accordance with all that they, who stand before Him in the place that He shall choose, teach me to do. He gave me the Torah as taught by them, even if they were to err.&#x201D; Such was the case of Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabban Gamaliel [Rabbi Yehoshua being instructed by Rabban Gamaliel to come before him with his walking stick] on the Day of Atonement that occurred according to his reckoning.<sup><xref rid="fn1446">90</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now the need for this commandment is very great, for the Torah was given to us in written form and it is known that not all opinions concur on newly arising matters. Disagreements would thus increase and the one Torah would become many Torahs. Scripture, therefore, defined the law that we are to obey the Great Court that stands before G-d in the place that He chose in whatever they tell us with respect to the interpretation of the Torah, whether they received its interpretation by means of witness from witness until Moses [who heard it] from the mouth of the Almighty, or whether they said so based on the implication [of the written words] of the Torah or its intent. For it was subject to their judgment that He gave them the Torah even if it [the judgment] appears to you to exchange right for left. And surely you are obligated to think that they say &#x201C;right&#x201D; what is truly right, because G-d&#x2019;s spirit is upon <italic>the ministers of His Sanctuary</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1447">91</xref></sup> <italic>and He forsaketh not His saints; they are preserved forever</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1448">92</xref></sup> from error and stumbling. In the language of the Sifre:<sup><xref rid="fn1449">93</xref></sup> &#x201C;Even if they show you before your own eyes that right is left and that left is right &#x2014; obey them&#x0021;&#x201D;</p>
<p>14. AND THOU SHALT SAY: &#x2018;I WILL SET A KING OVER ME.&#x2019; In the opinion of our Rabbis<sup><xref rid="fn1450">94</xref></sup> [who say that &#x201C;The Israelites were obliged to fulfill three commandments upon their entry into the Land: to appoint a king etc.&#x201D;] this verse is like &#x201C;and thou shalt surely say &#x2018;I will set a king over me.&#x2019; &#x201D; This is a positive commandment,<sup><xref rid="fn1451">95</xref></sup> for He has obligated us to say so after conquering and settling [in the Land]. The expression is similar to <italic>and thou shalt make a parapet for thy roof</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1452">96</xref></sup> [which is also a matter of obligation and not one of choice], and other verses besides these. He mentioned <italic>and thou shalt say</italic> because it is commanded that the people come before the priests of the tribe of Levi, and to the judge and say to them, &#x201C;It is our wish that we set a king over us.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It is my further opinion that this is also one of his [Moses&#x2019;] allusions to future events, for so it happened when the people asked for Saul, saying to Samuel, <italic>Now make us a king to judge us like all nations</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1453">97</xref></sup> and similarly it is written there, <italic>that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1454">98</xref></sup> For what reason is there that the Torah should say in connection with a commandment [&#x2018;<italic>I will set a king over me</italic>] <italic>like all the nations that are round about me</italic>&#x2019; when it is not proper for Israel to learn their ways<sup><xref rid="fn1455">99</xref></sup> and <italic>neither be envious against the workers of evil</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1456">100</xref></sup> But this is an allusion to what will be, and therefore the section is written in an intermediate tense [and not in the form of a command] as I have already explained.<sup><xref rid="fn1457">101</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. THOU SHALT BY ALL MEANS SET HIM KING OVER THEE, WHOM THE ETERNAL THY G-D SHALL CHOOSE. In the opinion of the commentators<sup><xref rid="fn1458">102</xref></sup> this means that he is to be chosen according to the word of a prophet or <italic>the judgment of the Urim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1459">103</xref></sup> Scripture is thus commanding: &#x201C;You shall set up a king over you, <italic>whom the Eternal thy G-d shall choose</italic>, for it is He Who will choose and not you.&#x201D; And in the Sifre it is stated:<sup><xref rid="fn1460">104</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Thou shalt by all means set him king over thee</italic>. If he dies, appoint another one in his place. <italic>A king</italic> &#x2014; but not a queen. <italic>Whom the Eternal thy G-d shall choose</italic> &#x2014; according to the word of the prophet.&#x201D; But, if so, what sense is there to warn [in the verse before us], <italic>thou mayest not put a foreigner over thee, who is not thy brother</italic>, when G-d would not choose a foreigner? However, in the opinion of our Rabbis there is in this verse a hidden condition, stating: &#x201C;you shall by all means set a king over you, whom G-d shall choose provided you can do so &#x2014; if G-d will answer you through prophets; but a foreigner you may never appoint as king over you.&#x201D;</p>
<p>And in line with the plain meaning of Scripture they<sup><xref rid="fn1461">105</xref></sup> have said, &#x201C;<italic>thou shalt by all means set him king over thee, whom the Eternal thy G-d will choose</italic> and not him whom <italic>the Eternal thy G-d hateth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1462">106</xref></sup> for He will choose an Israelite to be king over His chosen ones and not from among the other peoples.&#x201D; In my opinion the simple meaning of the expression <italic>whom He will choose</italic> is that every ruler over people receives his position from G-d, as it is written <italic>until thou wilt know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever He will</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1463">107</xref></sup> Similarly the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn1464">108</xref></sup> &#x201C;Even a superintendent of the well is appointed in heaven.&#x201D; Thus the verse is stating: &#x201C;<italic>thou shalt by all means set him king over thee</italic> &#x2014; whoever it be decreed by Heaven that he is to reign, even if he be <italic>of the smallest of the tribes of Israel</italic> and of <italic>the least of all the families of the tribe</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1465">109</xref></sup> &#x2014; but you are never to invest a foreigner with regal power.&#x201D; Similarly, by way of the plain meaning of Scripture, the expression <italic>the place which the Eternal thy G-d shall choose</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1466">110</xref></sup> means &#x201C;wherever G-d&#x2019;s Sanctuary shall be built, was all the Will of G-d.&#x201D;</p>
<p>16. HE SHALL NOT MULTIPLY HORSES TO HIMSELF &#x2014; &#x201C;except what he needs for his carriage, in order <italic>that he cause not the people to return to Egypt</italic>, because horses were obtained from Egypt, as it is said, <italic>And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1467">111</xref></sup> This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. But I have this difficulty regarding it, for the Rabbis have said in Yerushalmi at the end of Tractate Sanhedrin:<sup><xref rid="fn1468">112</xref></sup> &#x201C;You may not return there for settlement, but you may return for business, for goods, and for conquest of the land.&#x201D; And so, if the king should send men and buy horses and chariots there, it would be considered &#x201C;trading&#x201D; and would be permissible&#x0021; It is then possible that Scripture admonishes [the king] not to increase his numbers of horses even from his own Land, or from the land of Shinar, or by way of permissible trading, in order that he should not put his trust <italic>in</italic> his <italic>chariots, because they are many, and in</italic> his <italic>horsemen, because they are exceedingly mighty</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1469">113</xref></sup> but his trust shall be in the Name of the Eternal.<sup><xref rid="fn1470">114</xref></sup> Then he admonishes the king not to cause the people to return to Egypt, to have his servants and people there as overseers of cattle dwelling in <italic>the cities for the chariots</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1471">115</xref></sup> <italic>to the end that he should multiply horses</italic>, similar to what is said of Solomon, <italic>and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1471">115</xref></sup> And thus he had in Egypt, as it is said, <italic>And the horses which Solomon had, were brought out of Egypt; also out of Keveh, the king&#x2019;s merchants buying them</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1472">116</xref></sup> for no one was allowed to export horses from Egypt without permission from the Egyptian king and they paid him a tax for them. To Solomon, however, Pharaoh gave the right to export horses, meaning that he could take them out at will, and he could transfer that right to whomever he wished and keep the tax. He also had merchants stationed in Egypt buying all horses and sending to their lord [Solomon] those that he wanted and selling the others to kings of other countries. Thus it is said <italic>and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Aram, did they bring them out by their means</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1467">111</xref></sup> that is to say, they took them out through Solomon&#x2019;s merchants, and it was to him that they gave the tax.</p>
<p>&#x2018;RAK&#x2019; (ONLY) &#x2014; [<italic>&#x2018;Only&#x2019; he shall not multiply horses to himself</italic>]. The purport of the word <italic>only</italic> is to state, &#x201C;although you will set a king over you like all the nations that are around you &#x2014; only he shall not be like their kings. He should not multiply horses as they do,&#x201D; for the main desire of kings is to increase horses and horsemen for themselves.</p>
<p>SINCE THE ETERNAL HATH SAID UNTO YOU. The meaning thereof is that &#x201C;since G-d is telling you<sup><xref rid="fn1473">117</xref></sup> that you are henceforth not to return by the way of Egypt.&#x201D; Similarly, <italic>as the Eternal thy G-d &#x2018;commanded&#x2019; thee</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1474">118</xref></sup> which means &#x201C;as He is thus commanding you.&#x201D; Or it may be that the expression <italic>He hath said unto you</italic> means &#x201C;He had said to me to command you,&#x201D; similar to the verse, <italic>And Moses said</italic>, &#x2018;<italic>Thus saith the Eternal: About midnight</italic> etc.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1475">119</xref></sup> And by way of our Rabbis,<sup><xref rid="fn1476">120</xref></sup> the verse, <italic>for whereas ye have seen the Egyptians today, ye shall see them again no more</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1477">121</xref></sup> constitutes a [negative] commandment [for all times], and Moses is thus here reminding them that <italic>the Eternal &#x2018;hath said&#x2019; unto you</italic> [at the Red Sea] that <italic>ye shall henceforth return no more that way</italic>. I have already explained it.<sup><xref rid="fn1477">121</xref></sup> And the reason for this commandment is because the Egyptians and Canaanites <italic>were wicked and sinners against the Eternal exceedingly</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1478">122</xref></sup> just as He said, <italic>After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do; and after the doings of the land of Canaan</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1479">123</xref></sup> Now the Eternal desired that the Israelites not learn from their deeds and so He ordered that all living things, from among the Canaanites be destroyed, saying, <italic>They shall not dwell in thy Land</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1480">124</xref></sup> and he warned with respect to the Egyptians that we are not to settle there in their land.</p>
<p>19. &#x2018;V&#x2019;HAY&#x2019;THAH&#x2019; (AND IT SHALL BE) WITH HIM [&#x201C;it&#x201D; refers to] the Torah<sup><xref rid="fn1481">125</xref></sup> as mentioned [in the preceding verse]. AND HE SHALL READ &#x2018;BO&#x2019; (THEREIN) &#x2014; &#x201C;in the book&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1482">126</xref></sup> mentioned [in the preceding verse]. And by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;hay&#x2019;thah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and it shall be</italic>) <italic>with him</italic> means that the Torah itself will be with him, similar to what is said, <italic>And the Eternal gave Solomon wisdom</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1483">127</xref></sup> and it is further said, <italic>And Solomon sat on the throne of the Eternal as king</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1484">128</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. THAT HIS HEART BE NOT LIFTED UP ABOVE HIS BRETHREN. Here in the Torah a prohibition against conceit is alluded to, for Scripture prohibited even the king from indulging in conceit and haughtiness of heart, surely other people who are not of such commendable excellence [or merit, are forbidden to be haughty]. Scripture has thus admonished him for whom it is proper to be haughty and majestic that his heart must be as humble as that of his brethren of lower status, because conceit is a reprehensible character-trait, and it is loathsome to G-d even in a king. To G-d alone is the greatness<sup><xref rid="fn1485">129</xref></sup> and exaltation,<sup><xref rid="fn1486">130</xref></sup> and to Him alone is the praise, and in [the knowledge of] Him may man glory, as the matter is explained by King Solomon, <italic>Every man that is proud in heart is an abomination to the Eternal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1487">131</xref></sup> It is further written, <italic>But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth, and knoweth Me</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1488">132</xref></sup></p>
<h1>18</h1>
<p>1. THE FIRE OFFERINGS OF THE ETERNAL &#x2014; &#x201C;the hallowed offerings of the Sanctuary. AND HIS INHERITANCE &#x2014; these are hallowed gifts that may be consumed outside of the Sanctuary and Jerusalem, such as the heave-offerings and the tithes. 2. BUT a real INHERITANCE SHALL HE [the tribe of Levi] NOT HAVE AMONG HIS BRETHREN. In the Sifre the Rabbis interpreted this verse:<sup><xref rid="fn1489">133</xref></sup> &#x2018;<italic>But an inheritance shall he not have</italic> &#x2014; this refers to the inheritance of the rest [of the nations]. <italic>Among his brethren</italic> &#x2014; this refers to the inheritance of the seven.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1490">134</xref></sup> I do not know what this means. But it appears to me that the land of Canaan, which extends from the [western] side of the Jordan, is called the land of &#x2018;the five nations;&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1490">134</xref></sup> the land of Sihon and Og is called the land of two nations, the Amorites and the Canaanites; and &#x2018;the inheritance of the rest&#x2019; includes the lands of the Kenites, Kenizzites, and Kadmonites [which are to be given to Israel in the future]. Then the following statement was found in the words of Rabbi Klonimus:<sup><xref rid="fn1491">135</xref></sup> Thus we must read in the Sifre, &#x2018;<italic>But an inheritance shall he not have</italic> &#x2014; this refers to the inheritance of the five nations. <italic>Among his brethren</italic> &#x2014; this refers to the inheritance of the seven.&#x2019; And [Rabbi Klonimus explained the Sifre as meaning] the inheritance of the five tribes, and the inheritance of the seven tribes. Now, because Moses and Joshua assigned an inheritance only to five tribes &#x2014; for Moses assigned an inheritance to Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Menasheh, and Joshua assigned an inheritance to Judah, Ephraim, and the other half of the tribe of Menasheh. The other seven took their own portions after the death of Joshua. Therefore [the Sifre] mentioned the five [tribes] separately and the seven [tribes] separately.&#x201D; All this is Rashi&#x2019;s language.</p>
<p>Now, I have already explained the main interpretation [of this Sifre] in the section <italic>Sanctify unto Me</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1492">136</xref></sup> that &#x201C;the inheritance of the five&#x201D; is mentioned in the verse, <italic>And it shall be when the Eternal shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which He swore unto thy fathers to give thee, a Land flowing with milk and honey</italic>, constitute a change<sup><xref rid="fn1493">137</xref></sup> these comprising the main Land which He promised them, for that was the Land flowing with milk and honey. But the two remaining lands, those of the Perizzite and the Girgashite, were not flowing with milk and honey and are not obligated in the commandment of first-fruits. Therefore, he mentioned regarding the Levites that they are not to take a portion with Israel [either] in the main part of their inheritance in the good land which is &#x201C;the inheritance of the five&#x201D; [nations], and not even in the inheritance of &#x201C;the seven&#x201D; [nations] which contain the two remaining ones [the Perizzite and the Girgashite] &#x2014; although their lands were not good and were not considered so worthy in the eyes of the Israelites. This is a clear interpretation [of this Sifre] on the basis of proofs I have written there.<sup><xref rid="fn1492">136</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. AND THIS SHALL BE THE PRIESTS&#x2019; DUE FROM THE PEOPLE. This is a new commandment not mentioned in [the preceding books of] the Torah, for, in the wilderness where they did not slaughter oxen or sheep except as peace-offerings, He did not mention it because it does not apply to consecrated animals. Now, as they were about to enter the Land, he declared it to them for the first time. This is the sense of the expression [<italic>And this shall be the priests&#x2019; due from the people</italic>] <italic>from them that slaughter the animal</italic>. That is to say, when they will slaughter an animal as I have permitted you, [as it is said], <italic>then thou mayest slaughter of thy herd and of thy flock as I have commanded thee, and thou mayest eat in thy gates</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1494">138</xref></sup> [you shall give the priest his due <italic>the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw</italic>]. He did not allocate this [gift of the shoulder, cheeks, and maw] to Aaron in the section, <italic>And the Eternal said unto Aaron</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1495">139</xref></sup> [wherein the other priestly gifts are enumerated], although there He assigned the heave-offerings and the first-fruits [despite the fact that they, like the gifts in the verse before us] apply only in the Land. The reason [for mentioning them there] is that there He stated all things that He gave the priests in sacred matters, for even things &#x201C;devoted&#x201D; are holy.<sup><xref rid="fn1496">140</xref></sup> But <italic>the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw</italic>, and <italic>the first of the fleece</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1497">141</xref></sup> [mentioned here] are completely unconsecrated, since there are no special laws regarding them aside from the commandment of giving them to the priest. Similarly He did not mention there [in the chapter of the priestly gifts] the law of property wrongfully taken from a proselyte [which reverts to the priests<sup><xref rid="fn1498">142</xref></sup> if the proselyte died without leaving an heir, and the reason this law is not mentioned in the chapter of the priestly gifts is, as explained concerning the gift in the verse before us, that the reverted property of the proselyte is not sacred].</p>
<p>But according to the interpretation of our Rabbis, all [of the twenty-four priestly gifts] are alluded to there [in the section, <italic>And the Eternal said unto Aaron</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn1495">139</xref></sup> Thus they have said:<sup><xref rid="fn1499">143</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>The first part of them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1500">144</xref></sup> &#x2014; this refers to the first of the fleece. <italic>Which they give</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1500">144</xref></sup> &#x2014; this refers to the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.<sup><xref rid="fn1501">145</xref></sup> <italic>Unto the Eternal</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1500">144</xref></sup> &#x2014; this refers to the dough-offering.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1502">146</xref></sup> If so, this also is an explanatory commandment [and not a new one].</p>
<p>Based on a Midrash [a homiletic explanation] the Sages have said<sup><xref rid="fn1503">147</xref></sup> [that the shoulder, cheeks, and maw were awarded to the priests in the merit of the deed of Phinehas]: &#x201C;<italic>The shoulder</italic> because <italic>he took a spear in his hand;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1504">148</xref></sup> <italic>the two cheeks</italic> because of his prayer, as it is said, <italic>Then stood up Phinehas and prayed</italic> etc.;<sup><xref rid="fn1505">149</xref></sup> <italic>the maw</italic> because of what it states, <italic>and he thrust both of them through</italic> etc. <italic>and the woman through her body</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1506">150</xref></sup> Now, [if we are to say that this priestly gift had already been suggested in the section containing G-d&#x2019;s words to Aaron, which occurred long before the story of Phinehas, we must say] on the basis of this Midrash that the merit that was destined [to be Phinehas&#x2019;] was alluded to [in that section], and [G-d] rewarded the entire tribe for the merit of Phinehas&#x2019; when he [Phinehas] earned the privilege of being a priest with them.</p>
<p>And the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] said in the Moreh Nebuchim<sup><xref rid="fn1507">151</xref></sup> that the cheeks [are given to the priests] because they are the first part of the body [of the animal], the shoulder is the first of the extremities of the body, and the maw is the first of the inwards, for the first of them all is given to the ministers of the Most High in His honor.</p>
<p>9. THOU SHALT NOT LEARN TO DO AFTER THE ABOMINATIONS OF THOSE NATIONS. This also is an explanatory commandment, for He has already stated, <italic>and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do; neither shall ye walk in their statutes</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1508">152</xref></sup> and now he mentions their deeds and declares them to be abominations before G-d. He mentioned <italic>anyone that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1509">153</xref></sup> which, by way of the simple meaning of Scripture is a type of witchcraft, or, in the opinion of our Rabbis,<sup><xref rid="fn1510">154</xref></sup> it is the Molech. This is the truth as I have explained it in its place.<sup><xref rid="fn1511">155</xref></sup> He mentioned <italic>a sorcerer</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1509">153</xref></sup> an inclusive term for all sorcery. <italic>Or a charmer, or one that consulteth a ghost or a familiar spirit</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1512">156</xref></sup> &#x2014; these are specific forms of sorcery. He also prohibited them to consult [the sorcerer] or the necromancer who uses the <italic>ov</italic> (ghost), or, in any manner to seek information from them. He mentioned <italic>&#x2018;koseim k&#x2019;samim&#x2019;</italic> (one that useth divination)<sup><xref rid="fn1509">153</xref></sup> which involves divining future events, from the <italic>word &#x2018;kesem&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>an oracle</italic>) <italic>is in the lips of the king; his mouth trespasseth not in judgment</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1513">157</xref></sup> just as Scripture states, <italic>Balaam also the son of Beor &#x2018;hakoseim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the soothsayer</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn1514">158</xref></sup> and he was an enchanter, as it is said concerning him, <italic>he went not, as at the other times, to meet with enchantments</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1515">159</xref></sup> and it is further written, <italic>&#x2018;kasomi&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>divine unto me</italic>), <italic>I pray thee, by a ghost</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1516">160</xref></sup> He mentioned specifically <italic>m&#x2019;onein</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1509">153</xref></sup> who is a diviner interpreting by [the formations of] the clouds, and the <italic>m&#x2019;nacheish</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1509">153</xref></sup> who divines by looking at the wings of the birds [in flight] or by listening to their chirping, something similar to what is written, <italic>for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1517">161</xref></sup> The word <italic>m&#x2019;nacheish</italic> is derived from the expression <italic>&#x2018;chashti&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>I made haste</italic>) <italic>and delayed not</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1518">162</xref></sup> because whatever expedites knowledge of the future before it transpires is termed <italic>nacheish</italic>, that is to say, &#x201C;we will hurry&#x201D; and know sooner. Scripture states, <italic>For &#x2018;all&#x2019; that do these things are an abomination unto the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1519">163</xref></sup> but it does not say &#x201C;for those that do &#x2018;all&#x2019; these things &#x2026;&#x201D; because Scripture [in calling the practitioner an abomination] refers to most [but not all] of these practices. For the <italic>m&#x2019;onein</italic> [who divines by observing the clouds] and the <italic>m&#x2019;nacheish</italic> [who prophesies by means of the wings or chirping of birds] are not abominable, and G-d did not dispossess the Canaanites on their account, because all human beings desire to know things that are to come upon them, and engage in what they consider to be pursuits of wisdom.</p>
<p>And now, know and understand concerning the subject of sorcery, that when the Creator, blessed be He, created everything from nothing, He made the higher powers to be guides for those below them. Thus He placed <italic>the earth and all things that are thereon</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1520">164</xref></sup> in the power of the stars and constellations, depending on their rotation and position as proven by the study of astrology.<sup><xref rid="fn1521">165</xref></sup> Over the stars and constellations He further appointed guides, angels, and &#x201C;lords&#x201D; which are the soul [of the stars and constellations]. Now, their behavior from the time they come into existence for eternal duration, is according to the pattern the Most High decreed for them. However, it was one of His mighty wonders that within the power of these higher forces, He put configurations [as explained further on] and capacities to alter the behavior of those under them. Thus if the direction of the stars towards the earth be good or bad to a certain country, people, or individual, the higher dominions can reverse it of their own volition, as they<sup><xref rid="fn1522">166</xref></sup> have said, &#x201C;The apposition for the word <italic>oneg</italic> (pleasure) is <italic>nega</italic> (plague).&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1523">167</xref></sup> G-d ordained it so because <italic>He</italic>, blessed be His Name, <italic>changeth the times and the seasons;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1524">168</xref></sup> <italic>He calleth for the waters of the sea</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1525">169</xref></sup> to do with them at His Will, <italic>and bringeth on the shadow of death in the morning</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1525">169</xref></sup> without changing the natural order of the world, and it is He Who made the stars and constellations move about in their order. Therefore, the author of the Book of the Moon, the expert in [the field of] necromancy,<sup><xref rid="fn1526">170</xref></sup> said, &#x201C;when the moon, termed &#x2018;the sphere of the world,&#x2019; is, for example, at the head of Aries (the Ram)<sup><xref rid="fn1527">171</xref></sup> and the constellation thus appears in a certain form, you should make a drawing of that grouping, engraving on it the particular time [when this relative position appears] and the name of the angel &#x2014; one of the names mentioned in that book &#x2014; appointed over it. Then perform a certain burning [of incense] in a certain specified manner, and the result of the influence [of the relative position of the stars] will be for evil, <italic>to root out and to pull down, and to destroy and to overthrow</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1528">172</xref></sup> And when the moon will be in a position relative to some other constellation you should make the drawing and the burning in a certain other manner and the result will be for good, <italic>to build and to plant</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1528">172</xref></sup> Now this, too, is the influence of the moon as determined by the power of its [heavenly] guide. But the basic manner of its movement is by the wish of the Creator, blessed be He, Who endowed it so in time past, while this particular action is contrary thereto. This then is the secret of [all forms of] sorcery and their power concerning which the Rabbis have said<sup><xref rid="fn1529">173</xref></sup> that &#x201C;they contradict the power of Divine agencies,&#x201D; meaning that they are contrary to the simple powers [with which the agencies have been endowed] and thus diminish them in a certain aspect thereof. Therefore, it is proper that the Torah prohibit these activities in order to let the world rest in its customary way, in the simple nature which is the desire of its Creator. This is also one of the reasons for the prohibition of <italic>kilayim</italic> (mixing seeds), for the plants resulting from such grafting are strange, giving rise to changes in the ordered course of the world for bad or good, aside from the fact that they themselves constitute a change in Creation, as I have already explained.<sup><xref rid="fn1530">174</xref></sup> Now, many scholars<sup><xref rid="fn1531">175</xref></sup> dispose themselves to be liberal with regard to these enchantments by saying that there is no truth in them whatsoever, for who tells the raven or the crane what will happen? But we cannot deny matters publicly demonstrated before the eyes of witnesses. Our Rabbis also, acknowledged their existence, as they have said in Eileh Shemoth Rabbah:<sup><xref rid="fn1532">176</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>For a bird of the air shall carry the voice</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1517">161</xref></sup> &#x2014; this refers to the raven and the craft of <italic>tiarin</italic>.&#x201D; Birds in Arabic are called <italic>tiar</italic> and those versed in the divination of birds are called <italic>tiarin</italic>. This subject is also mentioned in the Gemara.<sup><xref rid="fn1533">177</xref></sup></p>
<p>But there is a secret to this matter. We have already made known<sup><xref rid="fn1534">178</xref></sup> that the constellations have lords that lead them, these being &#x201C;the souls&#x201D; of the circuits of the spheres, and the lords of the tail and [head of] Aries (the Ram)<sup><xref rid="fn1527">171</xref></sup> are near the earth, these being termed &#x201C;the princes of the quiver,&#x201D; that make the future known. It is through them that the signs in the birds indicate things to come, not for long duration or distant future do they tell, but only of events that are about to happen. Some make them known by utterance of bitter sounds [resembling wailing] over the dead, and some by spreading their wings. This is what has been said, <italic>for a bird of the air shall carry the voice</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1517">161</xref></sup> [a reference] to those who suggest by their wings. Now all this is not considered abominable for the nations, instead it is considered wisdom for them. Thus the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn1535">179</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And Solomon&#x2019;s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1536">180</xref></sup> What was the wisdom of the children of the east? They were wise and crafty in divination of birds.&#x201D; Similarly it is stated in Scripture, <italic>for they are replenished from the east, and with soothsayers like the Philistines</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1537">181</xref></sup> And Solomon learned all this as part of his wisdom. Now, the knowledge [referred to by the Midrash] is understanding the chirping of birds, and &#x201C;the craftiness&#x201D; to explain a matter through spreading wings.</p>
<p>Now, when Scripture included the diviner by clouds and the [other] diviners with the abominations mentioned, it reverted and explained, <italic>these nations, that thou art to dispossess, hearken unto diviners</italic> [by clouds], <italic>and unto</italic> [other] <italic>diviners</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1538">182</xref></sup> for their wisdom is to know future events, <italic>but as for thee, the Eternal thy G-d hath not suffered thee so to do</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1538">182</xref></sup> Scripture is thus stating, &#x201C;G-d has prohibited you these specified practices [such as passing a child through the fire] because they are abominations before Him and because of them He drove these nations out from before you.<sup><xref rid="fn1539">183</xref></sup> He further forbade the enchanters and the diviners to you, because He gave you great eminence in setting you <italic>on high above all the nations of the earth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1540">184</xref></sup> in that He will raise up a prophet in the midst of you<sup><xref rid="fn1541">185</xref></sup> and place His words in his mouth and you will hear from him what G-d will do.<sup><xref rid="fn1542">186</xref></sup> To know the future it will be unnecessary for you to resort to a diviner or soothsayer who receives [the knowledge] from the stars or from the lower powers among the lords of above, whose words are not all true and who do not provide all necessary information. But prophecy informs us of G-d&#x2019;s desire and not one of its words will fall to the earth.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1543">187</xref></sup> It is this which Scripture explains [that if ever an ostensible prophecy does not come to pass], <italic>that is the thing which the Eternal hath not spoken</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1544">188</xref></sup> Thus you are His portion and His treasure, hearing His counsel from His mouth, while theirs is the portion of the constellations which they follow, this being the sense of the verse, <italic>but as for thee, the Eternal thy G-d hath not suffered thee so to do</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1538">182</xref></sup> This is the meaning of, <italic>which the Eternal thy G-d hath allotted unto all the peoples</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1545">189</xref></sup> as I have explained.<sup><xref rid="fn1546">190</xref></sup> And in the Sifre the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn1547">191</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>They hearken unto diviners</italic> [by the clouds] <italic>and</italic> [other] <italic>diviners</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1538">182</xref></sup> Perhaps you will say, &#x2018;They have a source from which to inquire [about the future] and I have nothing [from which] to inquire.&#x2019; Scripture therefore states, <italic>but as for thee, the Eternal thy G-d hath not suffered thee so to do</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1538">182</xref></sup> This is proof to all what we have explained that with respect to the diviners some <italic>root of the matter is found in</italic> them,<sup><xref rid="fn1548">192</xref></sup> and therefore Israel had a [legitimate] complaint in being enjoined from making use of them [i.e. the diviners].</p>
<p>13. THOU SHALT BE WHOLE-HEARTED WITH THE ETERNAL THY G-D. The meaning thereof is that we are to direct our hearts to Him only, and believe that He alone does everything. It is He Who knows the truth about all future events, and from His prophets, or from His pious ones, in other words the Urim and Thummim<sup><xref rid="fn1549">193</xref></sup> &#x2014; are we to inquire about future events. We are not to inquire of the astrologers or from anyone else, or by any means to trust that their words will be fulfilled. Instead, if we hear any prediction [of the diviners] we should say, &#x201C;Everything is in the hands of Heaven,<sup><xref rid="fn1550">194</xref></sup> for <italic>He is the G-d of gods</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1551">195</xref></sup> Who is supreme above all, the Omnipotent One over everything, Who changes the set order of the stars and constellations at His Will, Who <italic>frustrateth the tokens of the imposters, and maketh diviners mad</italic>,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1552">196</xref></sup> and we are to believe that future events will occur according to man&#x2019;s drawing closer to His service. Therefore after the warning against inquiring about future events from diviners, and of seeking <italic>on behalf of the living to the dead</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1553">197</xref></sup> he stated that you are to be whole-hearted with G-d in all these matters and not be afraid of those who tell of things to come. Rather, you should inquire of His prophet and to him shall you hearken.<sup><xref rid="fn1541">185</xref></sup> And this is the opinion of Onkelos who translated, &#x201C;You shall be whole-hearted in the fear of the Eternal your G-d,&#x201D; meaning that you should not be deficient in the fear of Him, for <italic>tamim</italic> (whole) indicates perfection in a thing, just as <italic>&#x2018;seh tamim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>a lamb that is perfect</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1554">198</xref></sup> means one that is without blemish and any deficiency. This verse [before us] constitutes a positive commandment.<sup><xref rid="fn1555">199</xref></sup> I have already mentioned this in connection with the verse, <italic>and be thou whole-hearted</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1556">200</xref></sup></p>
<p>15.	A PROPHET WILL THE ETERNAL THY G-D RAISE UP UNTO THEE, FROM THE MIDST OF THEE, OF THY BRETHREN, LIKE UNTO ME. The purport of the expression <italic>from the midst of thee</italic> is to allude that prophecy is present only in the Land of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn1557">201</xref></sup> It is for this reason that Scripture speaks with reference to the Land in this term &#x2014; <italic>The burden concerning the valley of &#x2018;chizayon&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>vision</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn1558">202</xref></sup> and as our Rabbis have mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn1559">203</xref></sup> A similar meaning is conveyed by the expression <italic>of thy brethren</italic>, that G-d has granted you eminence over all peoples and He will put His spirit only upon you. &#x201C;<italic>Like unto me</italic>, for I am from the midst <italic>of thy brethren</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1560">204</xref></sup> &#x2014; <italic>He will raise up unto thee</italic> in my stead, and so likewise from prophet to prophet.&#x201D; And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented: &#x201C;<italic>Like unto me</italic>, who am a prophet of G-d, and not a diviner [by clouds], nor any [other] diviner.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It is possible that the expression <italic>from the midst of thee</italic> means that you can trust his words since he is from your brethren, <italic>from the midst of thee</italic>. Similarly, in my opinion, <italic>like unto me</italic> means that he will be <italic>established to be a prophet of the Eternal</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1561">205</xref></sup> and you will believe in him just as you believe in me. I will yet explain this.<sup><xref rid="fn1562">206</xref></sup></p>
<p>16.	ACCORDING TO ALL THAT THOU DIDST DESIRE etc. Scripture here did not mention the full request that the people had made [at Sinai], since by their saying <italic>Let me not hear again the voice of the Eternal</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1563">207</xref></sup> &#x2014; they would not have merited [the granting of] prophets. But when they said [to Moses], <italic>Go thou near, and hear all that the Eternal our G-d may say; and thou shalt speak unto us all that the Eternal our G-d may speak unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1564">208</xref></sup> &#x2014; then they undertook upon themselves to believe in His prophets and to hear and to do whatever G-d would command through them. Therefore he said here, <italic>A prophet will the Eternal thy G-d raise up unto thee, of thy brethren, like unto me</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1565">209</xref></sup> and you will believe in him just as you believe in me, for you requested that G-d&#x2019;s words with you should be through me and that you would hearken to me. If so, believe in the rest of the prophets who come after me, as well, for I and they are identical. This is the sense of [the words of G-d to Moses], &#x201C;<italic>They have well said all that they have spoken</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1566">210</xref></sup> &#x2014; to believe in My prophets, and so will I do for them throughout their generations.&#x201D; It is possible that their request [at Sinai] was for future generations and their stated consent to hear from Moses &#x2014; in saying, <italic>and thou shalt speak unto us &#x2026; and we will hear it, and do it</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1564">208</xref></sup> &#x2014; was also for everlasting generations, and the meaning of the word <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;ath&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and thou</italic>) is &#x201C;you and every prohpet of G-d like you,&#x201D; as I have explained it there.<sup><xref rid="fn1564">208</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. AND HE THAT SHALL SPEAK IN THE NAME OF OTHER GODS &#x2014; &#x201C;even if [his false prophecy] corresponded to the law, prohibiting what is forbidden, and permitting what is permitted. HE SHALL DIE &#x2014; by strangulation.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language from the Sifre.<sup><xref rid="fn1567">211</xref></sup> Now the intent thereof is not to state that if a person came and said, &#x201C;In my dream I saw that Peor said to me that you should be heedful in observing the commandment of the palm-branch,&#x201D; that he be liable to the death penalty &#x2014; rather, in that case he is innocent. And if he said that you should do it [the commandment] in order to worship that abomination, then he is a false prophet who prophesies to worship an idol, and even if he were to say it in the name of G-d his punishment is stoning. But the case here is that he said &#x201C;I saw Peor for he is god and he commanded not to eat the flesh of the swine.&#x201D; Similarly, if he were to tell in its name that such-and-such [an event] is to happen, since he says that it is that worshipped object that speaks and does, decrees and fulfills, he is to be put to death by strangulation. Therefore, the Rabbis have said in the Gemara:<sup><xref rid="fn1568">212</xref></sup> &#x201C; &#x2018;He who prophesies in the name of an idol,&#x2019; means such as the prophets of Baal.&#x201D; They are the ones who would say that Baal is god, just as it is written, <italic>If the Eternal be G-d, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1569">213</xref></sup> They used to prophesy in his name, <italic>Go up</italic> [<italic>to Ramoth-gilead</italic>], <italic>and prosper, for the Eternal will deliver it into the hand of the king</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1570">214</xref></sup> their intent being to say that Baal is the lord who has this glorified name, and it is he who will give Ramoth-gilead into the hand of [king] Ahab.</p>
<p>21. &#x2018;V&#x2019;CHI&#x2019;(AND WHEN) THOU SAY IN THY HEART: &#x2018;HOW SHALL WE KNOW THE WORD WHICH THE ETERNAL HATH NOT SPOKEN?&#x2019; &#x201C;You are destined to say this when Hananiah the son of Azur [the false prophet] will come and prophesy, <italic>Behold, the vessels of the Eternal&#x2019;s House shall now shortly be brought back from Babylon</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1571">215</xref></sup> while Jeremiah [the true prophet] stands and proclaims <italic>concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1572">216</xref></sup> which were not exiled with Jeconiah,<sup><xref rid="fn1573">217</xref></sup> <italic>they shall be carried to Babylon</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1574">218</xref></sup> with the exile of Zedekiah.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language from the Sifre.<sup><xref rid="fn1575">219</xref></sup> This interpretation [of the Sifre] is based on the fact that the verse does not state &#x201C;<italic>v&#x2019;im</italic> (and if) thou say in thy heart&#x201D; [but it states <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;chi&#x2019;</italic> &#x2014; (<italic>and when</italic>) <italic>thou say in thy heart</italic>]. This is as I have mentioned<sup><xref rid="fn1576">220</xref></sup> that the Torah tells future events through allusions. But the purport of the verse is to say, &#x201C;<italic>How shall we know the word which the Eternal hath not spoken</italic>, so that we can slay the one who so prophesies?&#x201D; And he commanded that if the event does not come to pass then he should be killed because <italic>the Eternal hath not spoken it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1577">221</xref></sup> Do not fear him<sup><xref rid="fn1577">221</xref></sup> because of his wisdom or because of the sign that he gave [even though] <italic>the sign or the wonder did come to pass</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1578">222</xref></sup> Similarly the people could ask, &#x201C;How shall we know the word which G-d had spoken, to which we have been obligated to hearken in whatever He shall command?&#x201D; But this [Verse 22] is the answer to both questions,<sup><xref rid="fn1579">223</xref></sup> for, in the case of every prophet we should look ahead to that which he foretold. If it does not come to pass we shall know that he is a false prophet and he is to be killed, and if all that he predicted does come to pass he is <italic>established to be a prophet of the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1561">205</xref></sup> and we are bound to hearken to him in all that he commands in the name of G-d, just as he said, <italic>unto him ye shall hearken</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1565">209</xref></sup> Even to transgress the words of the Torah, [we are required to obey him] provided that it is to meet the particular need of the time, as in the case of Elijah on Mount Carmel<sup><xref rid="fn1580">224</xref></sup> [who, in his attempt to discredit idolatry, brought offerings to G-d on Mount Carmel despite the fact that it was forbidden to do so outside the Sanctuary Court in Jerusalem]. This is the sense of the expression, [a prophet] <italic>like unto me</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1565">209</xref></sup> [And G-d said, <italic>I will raise them up a prophet</italic>] <italic>like unto thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1581">225</xref></sup> meaning that he will first be established a prophet of the Eternal either by a sign or wonder, similar to what is said [of Moses], <italic>and he did the signs in the sight of the people. And the people believed</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1582">226</xref></sup> &#x2014; or that he foretells some future event and it occurs. And thus the Rabbis have said in Tractate Sanhedrin:<sup><xref rid="fn1583">227</xref></sup> &#x201C;Whoever disobeys a prophet, is liable to death by the hands of Heaven, as it is written, <italic>I will require it of him</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1584">228</xref></sup> And there the Rabbis asked: &#x201C;And how is one to know that someone is a prophet [and that, for refusing to obey him,] he will be punished? If the prophet gave him a sign. But in the case of Micaiah<sup><xref rid="fn1585">229</xref></sup> the prophet gave him no sign and yet he was punished [for refusing to hearken to him&#x0021; The Gemara answered]: It is different when a person is known to be an established prophet [in which case he need not give a sign]. And if this is not the case, how did Isaac hearken to Abraham on Mount Moriah [to submit himself to slaughter, a command, which had been given to Abraham but not to him]? And how did we rely on Elijah on Mount Carmel to bring offerings outside [the Sanctuary Court in Jerusalem? Obviously we must say that] it is different if the prophet is established [in which case he must be obeyed even if he does not offer a sign].&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now Rashi wrote:<sup><xref rid="fn1586">230</xref></sup> &#x201C;They have already been commanded that if one comes to entice you from [observing] one of the commandments [of G-d] you are not to hearken to him<sup><xref rid="fn1587">231</xref></sup> unless it has been clearly established by you that he is an absolutely righteous man, like Elijah on Mount Carmel [who brought the offerings outside the Sanctuary Court] because of the needs of the time. Therefore it states, <italic>unto him ye shall hearken</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1565">209</xref></sup> &#x2014; But this does not appear to be correct, for the necessary verification is not that he is a righteous man but that he is a true prophet known to all by having previously foretold future events which indeed came to pass, this being his &#x201C;sign&#x201D; as referred to in this section,<sup><xref rid="fn1588">232</xref></sup> or some wonders which he has done in our presence.<sup><xref rid="fn1589">233</xref></sup> This constitutes the presumption of prophets. In saying &#x201C;a perfectly righteous man,&#x201D; perhaps Rashi meant what Harav Rabbeinu<sup><xref rid="fn1590">234</xref></sup> Moshe [ben Maimon] wrote in <italic>Hilchoth Yesodei Hatorah:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1591">235</xref></sup> &#x201C;When a prophet is assigned a mission, he is given a sign or wonder so that the people might know that G-d had truly sent him. We do not believe everyone who shows a sign or wonder to be a prophet. Only a man whom we already know to be worthy of prophecy &#x2014; by reason of his wisdom and deeds wherein he stands pre-eminent among all his contemporaries, and follows the paths of prophecy, in its sanctity and renunciation [of physical lust] &#x2014; who then comes and performs a sign or wonder and says that G-d sent him, it is a commandment to hearken to him, as it is said, <italic>unto him ye shall hearken</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1565">209</xref></sup> It is possible that such a man may perform a sign or wonder and still not be a prophet [in which case] the sign must have some [other] meaning.<sup><xref rid="fn1592">236</xref></sup> Nevertheless, it is a commandment to listen to him, since he is a great man, learned and worthy of prophecy, we assign him the presumption [that his claim is true], just as we have been commanded to render a decision [in court] by the testimony of two proper witnesses even though it is possible that they testified falsely, because we consider them to be legitimate witnesses [having no basis to assume the contrary] we assign them the presumption of legitimacy in their testimony. On such matters it is said, <italic>The secret things belong unto the Eternal our G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1593">237</xref></sup> and it is further said, <italic>for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Eternal looketh on the heart</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1594">238</xref></sup></p>
<h1>19</h1>
<p>1. WHEN THE ETERNAL THY G-D SHALL CUT OFF THE NATIONS etc. 2. THOU SHALT SEPARATE THREE CITIES FOR THEE. This also is an explanatory commandment, since He has already commanded thereon,<sup><xref rid="fn1595">239</xref></sup> and now he went on to explain the ordinances thereof, saying <italic>and dwell in their cities, and in their houses</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1596">240</xref></sup> teaching that they are not obligated [to <italic>set</italic> aside the cities of refuge] until after taking possession of the Land and dwelling in it. And so Joshua did.<sup><xref rid="fn1597">241</xref></sup> He also added here, <italic>Thou shalt prepare thee the way</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1598">242</xref></sup> meaning that the roads leading thereto should be direct [without being unnecessarily circumflex], and that [signs reading] &#x201C;Refuge, Refuge&#x201D; be set up at the crossroads. So also he added <italic>and thou shalt divide the territory of thy Land into three parts</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1598">242</xref></sup> [meaning, that the cities shall be equidistant from the frontier and from each other]. And he also went on to teach us [the rules of] the matter of &#x201C;error&#x201D; [which require the unintentional murderer to seek refuge] as he said, <italic>And when a man goeth into the forest with his neighbor</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1599">243</xref></sup> Our Rabbis have based many more interpretations on this section.</p>
<p>8. AND IF THE ETERNAL THY G-D ENLARGE THY BORDER. This section deals with a future event, and I have already mentioned it<sup><xref rid="fn1600">244</xref></sup> in the section [i.e., the <italic>Seder</italic>] of <italic>Behold, I set before you</italic>. For first he stated, <italic>When the Eternal thy G-d shall cut off the nations, whose land the Eternal giveth thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1596">240</xref></sup> the expression <italic>whose land the Eternal giveth thee</italic> referring to all the seven nations that He mentions everywhere. So also he speaks with reference to them, <italic>And the Eternal thy G-d will cast out those nations before thee;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1601">245</xref></sup> <italic>whereas for the wickedness of these nations;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1602">246</xref></sup> <italic>and the Eternal will drive out all these nations from before you;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1603">247</xref></sup> <italic>but of the cities of these peoples</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1604">248</xref></sup> and so also in many other places. And now he commanded that after taking possession of their land and dwelling in it, he<sup><xref rid="fn1605">249</xref></sup> shall set aside three cities, completing [the performance of] the commandment with their designation, as He said there, <italic>there shall be for you six cities of refuge</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1606">250</xref></sup> and He further said, <italic>Ye shall give three cities beyond the Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1607">251</xref></sup> He did not command in the Torah that there be more than these six cities. Similarly all commandments of the Torah that become binding after taking possession and settling upon [the Land] become obligatory after the conquest of these seven nations. Only regarding this commandment, however, he added here, <italic>And if the Eternal thy G-d enlarge thy border</italic> and he did not say &#x201C;as He hath promised thee,&#x201D; as he said in the section, <italic>When the Eternal thy G-d shall enlarge thy border, as He hath promised thee</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1608">252</xref></sup> with reference to meat of a secular meal. This was because G-d did not promise them anywhere to give them [land] except for [that of] these seven nations. However, here he mentioned the patriarchs, as he said, <italic>And if the Eternal thy G-d enlarge thy border, as He hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which He promised to give unto thy fathers</italic>, this being an allusion to all ten nations<sup><xref rid="fn1609">253</xref></sup> that were promised to Abraham.</p>
<p>Now he made here a condition, <italic>if thou shalt</italic> [in time to come] <italic>keep all this commandment to do it</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1610">254</xref></sup> [then another three cities of refuge would be designated in addition to the six already discussed in Scripture]. Now it is clear that they will not inherit even the seven nations if they transgress the Torah as he has said many times &#x2014; <italic>hearken unto the statutes</italic> etc. <italic>that ye may live, and go in and possess the Land;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1611">255</xref></sup> <italic>and thou shalt write upon them all the words of this Law</italic> etc. <italic>that thou mayest go in unto the Land;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1612">256</xref></sup> <italic>For if ye shall diligently keep all this commandment</italic> etc., <italic>then will the Eternal drive out all these nations from before you</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1613">257</xref></sup> And when Achan, who was but an individual, transgressed the devoted thing,<sup><xref rid="fn1614">258</xref></sup> it was stated, <italic>Therefore the children of Israel cannot stand before their enemies, they turn their backs before their enemies</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1615">259</xref></sup> If so, [the question arises], why was this condition made only concerning these three cities, stating, <italic>And if the Eternal thy G-d enlarge thy border</italic> etc. <italic>if thou shalt keep all this commandment</italic> [when the conquest of the seven nations is also conditional upon observing the Torah]? The reason for this is, that it was the Divine Will before Him, blessed be He, that yet in the days of Moses and Joshua, He would give them possession of the lands of the seven nations which He had promised them while they were still in Egypt<sup><xref rid="fn1616">260</xref></sup> and in the wilderness,<sup><xref rid="fn1617">261</xref></sup> because it was known to Him that they were deserving [of the lands] by virtue of their merits. Therefore He obligated them in the observance of all commandments upon the conquest of these [nations], and He further obligated them [in the commandment] of the six cities of refuge, and so Joshua designated [the cities]. But concerning the three remaining ones he made a condition, <italic>if thou shalt keep all this commandment</italic> etc. <italic>to love the Eternal thy G-d, and to walk forever in His ways</italic> etc.,<sup><xref rid="fn1610">254</xref></sup> that is to say, that they would all observe the entire Torah, [they would then become obligated to set aside three additional cities]. There is no commandment dependent upon this condition except for [the designation] of these three cities.</p>
<p>But what reason was there to state, <italic>if thou shalt keep all this commandment</italic> etc. <italic>to walk &#x2018;kol hayamim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>forever</italic>) <italic>in His ways</italic> &#x2014; <italic>then shalt thou add three cities more for thee</italic>, for who knows what will ever happen afterwards? Now Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented: &#x201C;<italic>kol hayamim</italic> &#x2014; [all the days] without interruption between them.&#x201D; This is not correct. Rather, the purport of the verse is as follows: &#x201C;<italic>If thou shalt keep all this commandment</italic>, when your merit attains a degree that you will keep all the commandments, loving G-d with a perfect everlasting love, so that it should be apparent to Him that you will never again sin, then He will broaden your boundary and give you all the [ten] nations [He promised to Abraham].&#x201D; This is a reference to the days of which he said, <italic>And the Eternal thy G-d will open thy heart, and the heart of thy seed</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1618">262</xref></sup> the expression <italic>the heart of thy seed</italic> indicating [the people of] all future days, similar to what is written in the Prophets,<sup><xref rid="fn1619">263</xref></sup> <italic>And I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear Me forever; for the good of them, and of their children after them; and I will make an everlasting covenant with them</italic> etc., <italic>and I will put My fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from Me</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1620">264</xref></sup> Then when He shall <italic>make an everlasting covenant with them</italic> they will set aside these three cities [as cities of refuge].</p>
<p>13. THINE EYE SHALT NOT PITY HIM. &#x201C;This means that you shall not say, &#x2018;The first person has already been killed. Why should we kill him also, with the result that two people will be killed?&#x2019; &#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language quoting the Sifre.<sup><xref rid="fn1621">265</xref></sup> The meaning thereof is that you should not say, &#x201C;Rather than having pity on the blood of the slain it would be better to have pity on the blood of the living one.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The correct interpretation of the verse is as follows: Scripture has commanded concerning those liable to death, <italic>so thou shalt put away the evil from the midst of thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1622">266</xref></sup> this being a positive commandment. But in matters of prevalent danger [to society], He warned further with a negative commandment that [the murderers] not be spared from [punishment at] our hands, neither on account of fear of them nor because we might show them mercy. He mentioned the same in the case of the inciter.<sup><xref rid="fn1623">267</xref></sup> He also stated, <italic>Thou shalt not suffer a sorceress to live</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1624">268</xref></sup> because of her being <italic>full of tumult</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1625">269</xref></sup> who sells many through her sorceries.<sup><xref rid="fn1626">270</xref></sup> <italic>And thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall have no pity</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1627">271</xref></sup> &#x2014; this was commanded because the fools praise her for having been a help to her husband [who was fighting with another man], or because embarrassment is common and involves no monetary loss [and therefore the Torah was strict in the punishment thereof]. Similarly in the case of plotting witnesses He commanded that we have no pity on them,<sup><xref rid="fn1628">272</xref></sup> [thinking that] because nothing had yet been done to the accused<sup><xref rid="fn1629">273</xref></sup> [therefore we should not punish them], or perhaps [the strictness is] due to the prevalence of their danger.</p>
<p>THAT IT MAY GO WELL WITH THEE. The meaning thereof is that avenging innocent blood is a commandment and is a great blessing to you <italic>to deliver</italic> your <italic>soul from death</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1630">274</xref></sup> because pity upon murderers causes more bloodshed by these murderers and by others who break away [from society].</p>
<p>14. THOU SHALT NOT REMOVE THY NEIGHBOR&#x2019;S LANDMARK. This is a warning against changing the boundaries of the division by which the princes apportioned the Land to the tribes<sup><xref rid="fn1631">275</xref></sup> or to any individual among them. Therefore he stated, <italic>which they of old time have set</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1632">276</xref></sup> these being Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the princes of the tribes,<sup><xref rid="fn1631">275</xref></sup> and therefore he mentioned <italic>in thine inheritance which thou shalt inherit</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1632">276</xref></sup> And the reason for this commandment is that no one should contemplate to say, &#x201C;My portion which they gave me is not as valuable as the portion of my friend, because the dividers erred,&#x201D; or he may feel suspicious of the lots, thus he will not consider it [his removal of the boundary marker] to be robbery at all. Therefore he commanded here that no one should controvert that division, and he may not make any change in the boundaries, either secretly or openly. Now this is an explanatory commandment, deriving from what He commanded, <italic>According to the lot shall their inheritance be divided between the more and the fewer</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1633">277</xref></sup> and He further stated, <italic>These are the names of the men that shall take possession of the Land for you</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1634">278</xref></sup> And in the opinion of our Rabbis<sup><xref rid="fn1635">279</xref></sup> that this verse is an admonition, teaching us that one who encroaches on his neighbor&#x2019;s land in the Land of Israel transgresses two commandments,<sup><xref rid="fn1636">280</xref></sup> the meaning of the expression <italic>which they of old time have set</italic> means that one is not to secretly change an old boundary and say &#x201C;It was always here.&#x201D; Scripture admonishes [concerning an old boundary] because it speaks of what usually happens, for a new boundary is recognized and known and no one changes it. Our Rabbis themselves have mentioned [the first interpretation, for thus they said in the Sifre]:<sup><xref rid="fn1635">279</xref></sup> &#x201C;Whence do we know that one who uproots the boundaries of the tribes transgresses a negative commandment? Because Scripture states, <italic>Thou shalt not remove thy neighbor&#x2019;s landmark</italic>, [<italic>which they of old time have set</italic>].&#x201D; This is truly the plain meaning of Scripture.</p>
<p>18. AND THE JUDGES SHALL INQUIRE DILIGENTLY; AND, BEHOLD, IF THE WITNESS BE A FALSE WITNESS. Scripture has not explained how it became known that he is a false witness, for, since the testimony was presented by two witnesses, even if a hundred witnesses were to come and contradict them it would still not be established that they testified falsely [because the testimony of two witnesses carries the same weight as that of a hundred]. Nor can we say that the alleged murder-victim walked [into court], for, in that case Scripture would not say <italic>and the judges shall inquire diligently</italic> [for an investigation of testimony is incongruous when it is so demonstratively false]. Therefore, trustworthy tradition came and explained that the refutation<sup><xref rid="fn1637">281</xref></sup> of witnesses takes place when they [the second pair of witnesses] say to the first &#x201C;But you were with us on that day [and hour in such a place &#x2014; away from the alleged scene of the crime].&#x201D; The reason [that such testimony of the second pair of witnesses is accepted as conclusive] is because their testimony refers to the first <italic>witnesses themselves</italic> [rather than to <italic>their testimony</italic>, and the first pair, in order to defend itself, would therefore have to testify as to its own whereabouts at the time of the alleged crime]. Witnesses, however, are not given credence when testifying about themselves saying, &#x201C;We have not done so,&#x201D; and the second pair could say of the first pair that they killed someone or that they profaned the Sabbath.<sup><xref rid="fn1638">282</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. THEN SHALL YE DO UNTO HIM [the refuted witness], AS HE HAD PURPOSED TO DO &#x2014; &#x201C;but not as he has done&#x0021; Deriving from this, the Rabbis have said: If they [the refuted witnesses] have already killed [i.e., if the judgment based on their testimony was executed prior to the refutation] they are not put to death.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language quoting from the words of our Rabbis.<sup><xref rid="fn1639">283</xref></sup> The reason for this is that the law of punishment of plotting witnesses is by the decree of the Ruler, for they are two witnesses against two [even in the case of &#x201C;refutation&#x201D; and, logically, we should not believe the second more than the first, were it not that such is the decree of the King]&#x0021; Now, when two witnesses come and testify against Reuben that he killed a person and then another two come and &#x201C;refute&#x201D; [their claim of] having been witnesses, Scripture commanded that [the first pair] be killed for it was due to the merit of Reuben who was innocent and righteous that this affair [of &#x201C;the refutation&#x201D;] came to pass. Had Reuben been wicked, liable to a death-penalty, G-d would not have saved him from the hand of the court, as He said, <italic>for I will not justify the wicked</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1640">284</xref></sup> But if Reuben had already been killed we are to consider that whatever the first witnesses testified against him was true, for he died due to his iniquity.<sup><xref rid="fn1641">285</xref></sup> If he were righteous, G-d would not have left him in their hand, just as Scripture says, <italic>The Eternal will not leave him in his hand, nor suffer him to be condemned when he is judged</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1642">286</xref></sup> Moreover, G-d would not allow the righteous judges who stand before Him to spill innocent blood <italic>for the judgment is G-d&#x2019;s</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1643">287</xref></sup> and <italic>in the midst of &#x2018;elohim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the judges</italic>) <italic>He judgeth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1644">288</xref></sup> Now all this indicates the high degree of the judges in Israel and is a promise that the Holy One, blessed be He, agrees with them and <italic>He is with</italic> them <italic>pronouncing judgment</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1645">289</xref></sup> This is the sense of the verse, <italic>And both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1646">290</xref></sup> for it is before G-d that they stand when coming before the priests and the judges and He <italic>will lead</italic> them <italic>in the right way</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1647">291</xref></sup> I have already mentioned this in the section <italic>And these are the ordinances</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1648">292</xref></sup></p>
<h1>20</h1>
<p>1. WHEN THOU GOEST FORTH TO BATTLE AGAINST THINE ENEMIES, AND SEEST HORSES, AND CHARIOTS etc. This is a new commandment which he now declared to them as they came into battles. The purport of the verse, <italic>For the Eternal your G-d is He that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1649">293</xref></sup> is to admonish them against becoming faint-hearted and that they should not fear their enemies. He states that they are not to rely in this matter on their own strength, thinking in their hearts. <italic>We are mighty men, and valiant men for the war</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1650">294</xref></sup> but instead they are to turn their hearts only to G-d and rely on His help, thinking that <italic>He delighteth not in the strength of the horse</italic>, and <italic>He taketh no pleasure in the legs of a man</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1651">295</xref></sup> for <italic>The Eternal taketh pleasure in them that fear Him, in those that wait for His mercy</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1652">296</xref></sup> He states <italic>to fight for you against your enemies</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1649">293</xref></sup> meaning that He will make them fall before you by the sword. He states <italic>to save you</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1649">293</xref></sup> meaning that they will be spared in battle and that not a man among them will be missing,<sup><xref rid="fn1653">297</xref></sup> for it would be possible that they vanquish their enemies and that many of them, too, would die, as is the way of battles. Therefore Joshua cried out<sup><xref rid="fn1654">298</xref></sup> when <italic>about thirty and six men</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1655">299</xref></sup> fell in [the battle of] Ai, for in His commandatory war <italic>not one hair of</italic> their heads <italic>should have fallen to the ground</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1656">300</xref></sup> <italic>for the battle is the Eternal&#x2019;s</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1657">301</xref></sup> Now the priest who serves G-d is to admonish [the warriors] to fear Him, and give them assurance [of His help]. The officers, however, speak in the customary way of the world, <italic>lest he die in the battle</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1658">302</xref></sup> for in the normal course of events even some people of the group of the victors die. He commanded that these three categories [of people] return<sup><xref rid="fn1659">303</xref></sup> because one&#x2019;s heart is on his [new] house, vineyard, and wife and he will [be the first to] flee.</p>
<p>6. &#x2018;V&#x2019;LO CHIL&#x2019;LO&#x2019; &#x2014; the fourth year [since the vineyard was planted] had not yet arrived. For the custom regarding a vineyard used to be that when the produce was ripe they would dance there and walk in it with <italic>chalilim</italic> (flutes). Now, Scripture commanded that <italic>all the fruits thereof</italic> [of the fourth year] <italic>shall be holy, for giving praise unto the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1660">304</xref></sup> that they should praise <italic>the Glorious Name</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1661">305</xref></sup> at that celebration. It is possible that the meaning of <italic>v&#x2019;lo chil&#x2019;lo</italic> is &#x201C;that he has not made it <italic>chulin</italic> (secular),&#x201D; this referring to the &#x201C;redemption&#x201D; [i.e., exchanging the fruits for money in case he cannot transport them to Jerusalem] which our Rabbis have mentioned,<sup><xref rid="fn1662">306</xref></sup> it being similar to the expressions: <italic>for Judah &#x2018;chileil&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>hath profaned</italic>) <italic>the holiness of the Eternal</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1663">307</xref></sup> [which means Israel has exchanged Him for other gods]; <italic>and he shall not &#x2018;yechaleil&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>profane</italic>) <italic>his seed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1664">308</xref></sup> [which also means that he shall not exchange his holy seed by taking a woman forbidden to him].</p>
<p>8. AND THE OFFICERS SHALL SPEAK FURTHER UNTO THE PEOPLE, AND THEY SHALL SAY: &#x2018;WHAT MAN IS THERE THAT IS FEARFUL.&#x2019; According to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei the Galilean [who says, the <italic>fearful</italic> is someone who is afraid that he will fall in battle as punishment for his transgressions],<sup><xref rid="fn1665">309</xref></sup> after the priest had assured them that G-d would help them and that not one man of them will be lacking, it was fitting that the righteous put their trust in Him, [that He will help them not to be overthrown in battle]. Then, the officers warn those that are afraid [to go into battle] because of the transgressions they had committed. The Torah, therefore, gave everyone the opportunity of attributing his return home because of his house, his vineyard, or his wife, in order to serve as a pretext for others who are returning home because they are afraid of their transgressions. And the meaning of the expression <italic>lest he die in the battle</italic> [mentioned in each of the three categories]<sup><xref rid="fn1659">303</xref></sup> is that he will think so in his heart and he will flee [despite the fact that the priest had already assured them that no one would be lacking after the battle]. But in the opinion of the Rabbi Akiba [who says that <italic>fearful</italic> is he who cannot endure a pitched battle or bear to see a drawn sword,]<sup><xref rid="fn1665">309</xref></sup> the verse is to be understood in its simple meaning, that whoever is still afraid after the assurance of the priest, does not trust in G-d properly and the miracle [of being saved] will not be done for him [and therefore the Torah gave him the opportunity to return home].</p>
<p>FAINT-HEARTED. The meaning thereof is that it is not in his nature to see <italic>the stroke of the sword, and slaughter</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1666">310</xref></sup> for the <italic>fearful</italic> is he who does not trust, and Scripture commands him to return to his home because of his deficient trust. The <italic>faint-hearted</italic> is sent home because of the weakness of his nature, for he will flee or faint. Now the Rabbis have said in the Yerushalmi<sup><xref rid="fn1667">311</xref></sup> that &#x201C;all who return home need to bring proof for their words,&#x201D; that is to say, they are to bring proof concerning the [new] house, the vineyard, or the wife before the captain of the host who then gives him permission to return home. Similarly they also said according to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei the Galilean [who says the <italic>fearful</italic> is he that is afraid because of his transgressions] that he needs to bring proof concerning the transgression he committed, for otherwise most of the people would have been returning home under false pleas. But according to Rabbi Akiba, the faint-hearted cannot endure pitched battle or bear to see a drawn sword,<sup><xref rid="fn1665">309</xref></sup> [the Yerushalmi states] he need not bring proof, &#x201C;for his witnesses are with him&#x201D; [i.e., everybody sees that he is fearful and faint-hearted].</p>
<p>LEST HIS BRETHREN&#x2019;S HEART MELT AS HIS HEART. The author of the Hilchoth Gedoloth<sup><xref rid="fn1668">312</xref></sup> considered this verse a negative commandment, meaning that [if he is fearful and faint-hearted] he should not avoid returning home, lest he melt his brethren&#x2019;s heart like his own.<sup><xref rid="fn1669">313</xref></sup> It is similar to the verse, <italic>and its flesh shall not be eaten</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1670">314</xref></sup> [which is counted among the negative commandments].<sup><xref rid="fn1671">315</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. AND CAPTAINS OF HOSTS SHALL BE APPOINTED AT THE HEAD OF THE PEOPLE. He so commanded because the Torah enjoins in accordance with the way of the world while G-d does miracles for those who fear Him secretly. There is no desire before Him to change the natural order of the world, unless there is no other way for salvation, or in order <italic>to make</italic> His <italic>Name known to His adversaries</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1672">316</xref></sup> at certain times as at the splitting of the Red Sea and similar events.</p>
<p>10. WHEN THOU DRAWEST NEAR UNTO A CITY TO FIGHT AGAINST IT, THEN PROCLAIM PEACE UNTO IT. &#x201C;Scripture is speaking of a permissible war [rather than a war required by the Torah, such as the invasion of the seven nations of Canaan], as it is expressly stated in this section, <italic>Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1673">317</xref></sup> This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. The Rabbi [Rashi] wrote this based on the Sifre where a similar text is taught:<sup><xref rid="fn1674">318</xref></sup> &#x201C;Scripture is speaking of a battle waged of free choice.&#x201D; But the intent of our Rabbis with reference to this verse [before us, was not to say that the requirement of proclaiming peace applies exclusively to permissible, but not to obligatory, wars; rather, their teaching in the Sifre] refers only to the later section wherein there is a differentiation between the two kinds of wars [i.e., in Verses 13-14 declaring that if the enemy insists on war, then only the men are to be killed, but the women and children are to be spared &#x2014; that law applies only to a permissible but not to an obligatory war]. But the call for peace applies even to an obligatory war. It requires us to offer peace-terms even to the seven nations [of Canaan], for Moses proclaimed peace to Sihon, king of the Amorites,<sup><xref rid="fn1675">319</xref></sup> and he would not have transgressed both the positive and negative commandments in this section: <italic>but thou shalt utterly destroy them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1676">320</xref></sup> and <italic>thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth&#x0021;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1677">321</xref></sup> Rather, the difference between them [i.e., obligatory and permissible wars] is when the enemy does not make peace and continues to make war. Then, in the case of the <italic>cities which are very far off</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1678">322</xref></sup> Scripture commanded us to <italic>smite every male thereof</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1679">323</xref></sup> and keep alive the women and male children,<sup><xref rid="fn1680">324</xref></sup> but in <italic>the cities of these peoples</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1677">321</xref></sup> [i.e., the seven nations of Canaan in the event they refuse the call to peace], it commanded us to destroy even the women and children. And so did our Rabbis say in the Midrash of Eileh Hadevarim Rabbah,<sup><xref rid="fn1681">325</xref></sup> and it is found also in Tanchuma<sup><xref rid="fn1682">326</xref></sup> and in the Gemara Yerushalmi:<sup><xref rid="fn1683">327</xref></sup> &#x201C;Rabbi Shmuel the son of Rabbi Nachmani said: Joshua the son of Nun fulfilled the laws of this section. What did Joshua do? Wherever he went to conquer, he would send a proclamation in which he wrote: &#x2018;He who wishes to make peace let him come forward and make peace; he who wishes to leave, let him leave, and he who wishes to make war, let him make war.&#x2019; The Girgashite left. With the Gibeonites who made peace, Joshua made peace. The thirty-one kings<sup><xref rid="fn1684">328</xref></sup> who came to wage war &#x2014; the Holy One, blessed be He, cast them down etc.&#x201D; And so indeed Scripture states with reference to all cities [including those of the seven nations], <italic>There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon; they took all in battle. For it was of the Eternal to harden their hearts, to come against Israel in battle, that they might be utterly destroyed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1685">329</xref></sup> Obviously, if they had wanted to make peace, the Israelites would have made peace with them.</p>
<p>It appears that regarding the terms of peace, there were differences [between what was offered <italic>the very far off cities</italic> and what was offered the seven nations], for, with reference to the distant cities, we ask that they make peace and become tributary to us and serve,<sup><xref rid="fn1686">330</xref></sup> but, regarding <italic>the cities of these peoples</italic> [the seven nations] we request of them peace, tribute and service, on the condition that they agree not to worship idols. Scripture does not mention it in this section, because concerning idolators, it has already given the prohibition, <italic>They shall not dwell in thy Land, lest they make thee sin against Me, for thou wilt serve their gods</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1687">331</xref></sup> It is possible that we must inform them only of the peace offer, tribute and service; after they are subject to us, we tell them that we execute judgment upon idols and their worshippers, whether individuals or the community. Similarly, that which is stated here, <italic>That they teach you not to do after all their abominations</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1688">332</xref></sup> and with reference to it the Rabbis said in the Sifre,<sup><xref rid="fn1689">333</xref></sup> &#x201C;But if they repent [of their idol-worship] they are not to be killed&#x201D; &#x2014; this refers to the seven nations. The &#x201C;repentance&#x201D; is that they accept upon themselves the seven commandments<sup><xref rid="fn1690">334</xref></sup> in which &#x201C;the sons of Noah&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1691">335</xref></sup> were commanded, but not that they must convert to become righteous proselytes.</p>
<p>Now, in Tractate Sotah the Rabbis have said<sup><xref rid="fn1692">336</xref></sup> that &#x201C;they [i.e., the Israelites upon coming into the Land] inscribed the Torah upon stones in seventy languages<sup><xref rid="fn1693">337</xref></sup> and that, below, they wrote, <italic>That they teach you not to do</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1688">332</xref></sup> However, [we deduce,] if the peoples were to repent, the Israelites would accept them.&#x201D; Rashi explained this text as follows: &#x201C;[This verse was written upon the stones below] to inform the nations that dwelled outside the border of the Land of Israel that they [i.e., the Israelites] were not commanded to destroy [populations] except for those [the seven nations] that dwell within the borders in order that they [the Canaanites] should not teach them their perverted practices. But as to those who dwell outside [the boundaries] we tell them, &#x2018;If you repent, we accept you.&#x2019; Those who dwell within the Land we do not accept because their repentance was due to fear.&#x201D; This is the language of the Rabbi [Rashi]. But it is not correct, for it was with reference to <italic>the cities of these peoples, that the Eternal thy G-d giveth thee for an inheritance</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1677">321</xref></sup> &#x2014; it was of them that he said <italic>that they teach you not</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1688">332</xref></sup> thus indicating that if they do repent [thereby negating the fear that they may <italic>teach you</italic>] they are not to be slain. Similarly He said of them, <italic>They shall not dwell in thy Land, lest they make thee sin against Me, for thou wilt serve their gods</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1687">331</xref></sup> which indicates that if they abandon their gods they are permitted to dwell there.</p>
<p>This is the project of Solomon concerning which it is written, <italic>And this is the account of the levy which King Solomon raised; to build the House of the Eternal, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1694">338</xref></sup> <italic>All the people that were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel; even their children that were left after them in the Land, whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy, of them did Solomon raise a levy of bondservants, unto this day. But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondservants</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1695">339</xref></sup> This project he did in accordance with the Law, for they accepted the observance of the seven commandments<sup><xref rid="fn1690">334</xref></sup> upon themselves. Now it is clear that since Solomon was able to draft them as his laborers, he had power over them and he could have destroyed them, except that it was permissible to let them live, as we have written.</p>
<p>11. TRIBUTARIES UNTO THEE, AND THEY SHALL SERVE THEE. &#x201C;[Their surrender is not to be accepted] until they accept tribute and servitude upon themselves.&#x201D; This is the language of Rabbeinu Shlomo [Rashi]. And in the Sifre the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn1696">340</xref></sup> &#x201C;If they say &#x2018;We accept tribute upon ourselves but not servitude&#x2019;, or &#x2018;servitude but not tribute,&#x2019; they are not to heed them until they accept both upon themselves.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now the purport of the tribute was that the king of Israel or the Sanhedrin could impose a levy upon them, [drafting men] to build the king&#x2019;s palace and his store-cities, also the House of G-d. The servitude was that any Israelite could take one of them to be the hewer of his wood and the drawer of his water and pay him proper wages. This is the sense of what is written in connection with Solomon <italic>a levy of bondservants</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1697">341</xref></sup> meaning that they took upon themselves [both] tribute and servitude as is the law of the Torah. [However, the law of the Torah is] not as is written, <italic>And it came to pass, when Israel was waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not drive them out entirely</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1698">342</xref></sup> for &#x201C;servitude&#x201D; is not mentioned there. Instead it was like a king who bribes a more powerful king not to wage war against him.</p>
<p>Know that the matter of the Gibeonites<sup><xref rid="fn1699">343</xref></sup> came to pass because they did not know the law of Israel with respect to proclaiming peace, and therefore they put forward their plan, before Joshua&#x2019;s proclamation arrived. Hence they said, <italic>and we were sore afraid for our lives</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1700">344</xref></sup> Or it may be that, at first they did not wish to hearken to Joshua&#x2019;s offer [thus laying themselves open to invasion], and in the end they became frightened and disguised themselves as strangers, as it is written, <italic>And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai, they also did work wilily</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1701">345</xref></sup> Their trickery helped them yet in that they did not become their servants, but their confederates.</p>
<p>The Israelites were irritated at them and would have killed them had it not been for the oath of the princes<sup><xref rid="fn1702">346</xref></sup> because the Gibeonites should have taken upon themselves tribute and servitude, as we have said, while they [the princes] made a covenant with them to be equal and to be their confederates helping each other in their wars. They made peace with them [the Gibeonites] because they had thought that they were [from] very distant cities, from the peoples against whom they [the Israelites] had no intention of advancing. Therefore, Joshua cursed the Gibeonites, saying, <italic>Now therefore ye are cursed</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1703">347</xref></sup> meaning that they are of the accursed peoples whom the Eternal had cursed, and he did to them according to the law appropriate to be applied to them, to fulfill that which is written concerning them, <italic>tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee</italic>, that they be <italic>hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1704">348</xref></sup> this being the tribute and the servitude, as we have explained.</p>
<p>And some scholars<sup><xref rid="fn1705">349</xref></sup> say that the meaning of the verse, <italic>And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1686">330</xref></sup> is [that it applies only to an answer given] at the time of the proclamation [of peace]. But if at first they refused to make peace, we no longer accept them. The Gibeonites refused at first to hearken to Joshua&#x2019;s proclamation and the law therefore did not require the Israelites to accept them. And Harav Rabbi Moshe [ben Maimon] wrote<sup><xref rid="fn1706">350</xref></sup> that &#x201C;they were irritated at them because [they tricked the Israelites into] making a covenant with them, when it is said, <italic>Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1707">351</xref></sup> But this does not appear to be correct, for the Gibeonites had surely taken upon themselves not to worship idols, as they said, <italic>thy servants are come because of the name of the Eternal thy G-d</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1708">352</xref></sup> Therefore, Joshua did not have to tell them afterwards that they must take upon themselves to worship G-d. And if so, it was permissible for the Israelites to make that covenant with them, just as they were permitted to dwell in the Land, for both, [the making of a covenant, and the dwelling in the Land] were prohibited only before repentance [from the sin of idolatry], as He said, <italic>lest they make thee sin against Me</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1687">331</xref></sup> and so also He said, <italic>Thou shalt make no covenant with them, or with their gods</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1707">351</xref></sup> But the explanation of the Gibeonite affair is as we have said.</p>
<p>18. THAT THEY TEACH YOU NOT TO DO AFTER ALL THEIR ABOMINATIONS, WHICH THEY HAVE DONE UNTO THEIR GODS. The purport thereof is that they will teach you to worship <italic>the Glorious Name</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1709">353</xref></sup> with the burning of your sons and daughters and <italic>every abomination to the Eternal, which He hateth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1710">354</xref></sup> <italic>and so ye sin against the Eternal your G-d</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1711">355</xref></sup> Who has warned you against saying, <italic>How used these nations to serve their gods? even so will I do likewise</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1712">356</xref></sup> Now the Torah warned them, <italic>They shall not dwell in thy Land, lest they make thee sin against Me, for thou wilt serve their gods, for they will be a snare unto thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1687">331</xref></sup> which is an admonition against idolatry, for if you make a covenant with them and their gods, they will dwell in your Land and many of them will entice you to worship the idols. He added here to explain that <italic>thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1677">321</xref></sup> for even one of them that remains among you to serve you, will remind you of the worship of their gods and perhaps you will be persuaded to do so to <italic>the Glorious Name</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1709">353</xref></sup> and you will sin against Him, blessed be He.</p>
<p>19. FOR IS THE TREE OF THE FIELD A MAN? Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra has explained it well, that the purport of the verse is as follows: &#x201C;<italic>for thou mayest eat of it, for the man is the tree of the field</italic> [i.e., man is dependent on the fruit-tree for food], <italic>and thou shalt not cut it down that it be used by you in the siege</italic>. And the meaning of the expression <italic>for the man is the tree of the field</italic> is like <italic>for he taketh a man to pledge</italic>&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1713">357</xref></sup> [which means, &#x201C;when he takes away a man&#x2019;s tools and means of earning a livelihood in security for a debt, it is as if the man&#x2019;s very life is being taken from him,&#x201D; and here too it means &#x201C;for the tree of the field is man&#x2019;s life&#x201D; because his life depends on it]. But in the opinion of our Rabbis,<sup><xref rid="fn1714">358</xref></sup> it is permissible to cut down a fruit-tree to build a bulwark, and the statement of the Torah, <italic>Only trees which thou knowest that they are not trees for food</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1715">359</xref></sup> is to assign priority, meaning that a fruitless tree should be cut down prior to a fruit-tree. If so, the meaning of the section, in their opinion, is that the Torah warned, <italic>Thou shalt not destroy the trees</italic> to cut them down destructively, not for the purpose of the siege, as is the custom of armies [to cut down trees needlessly]. And the reason for it is that warriors destroy a city and its environs in the hope of conquering it, as it says, <italic>and ye shall fell every good tree, and stop all fountains of water</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1716">360</xref></sup> You are not to do so, to destroy it, for you are to trust in G-d that He will deliver it into your hand. <italic>For the man is the tree of the field</italic>, for you will eat of its fruit and live, and through it the city will be besieged by you, meaning to say, you will eat from it after conquering the city, and also when you are encamped, engaged in the siege, you should do likewise. And the meaning of the expression, <italic>them thou mayest destroy and cut down</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1715">359</xref></sup> is that you are permitted to cut them down to build bulwarks and also to destroy them <italic>until it be subdued</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1715">359</xref></sup> for sometimes the destruction [of the trees] is for the purpose of capturing the city; for example, when the people of the city go out and fetch the wood thereof, or they hide there in the forest to fight against them, or when the trees are <italic>a refuge and a covert</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1717">361</xref></sup> to the city from stones of stumbling.<sup><xref rid="fn1718">362</xref></sup></p>
<h1>21</h1>
<p>4. AND THE ELDERS OF THAT CITY SHALL BRING DOWN THE HEIFER UNTO A VALLEY &#x2018;EITHAN&#x2019; &#x2014; &#x201C;which is &#x2018;hard,&#x2019; one that has never been tilled.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. And our Rabbis have said<sup><xref rid="fn1719">363</xref></sup> that the field becomes forbidden from ever being tilled or sown. If so, [the words <italic>which is neither tilled nor sown</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn1720">364</xref></sup> are admonitions that he who sows or cultivates [a rough valley in which a heifer&#x2019;s neck has been broken] transgresses this negative commandment. The meaning of the verse is thus that the elders should take forth the heifer to [what will forever become] &#x201C;a rough valley&#x201D; because it will never again be tilled or sown. The meaning of the expression <italic>And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1721">365</xref></sup> is in order to recite <italic>Forgive, O Eternal, Thy people Israel, whom Thou hast redeemed</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1722">366</xref></sup> And the purport of the verses is as follows: <italic>And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1721">365</xref></sup> <italic>and all the elders of that city, who are nearest unto the slain man, shall wash their hands;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1723">367</xref></sup> <italic>and they shall speak and say: &#x2018;Our hands have not shed this blood.&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1724">368</xref></sup> The washing of hands is to be done only by some of the [elders] mentioned; so also their speaking [&#x2018;<italic>Our hands have not shed</italic> etc.&#x2019;] is done by some of them, similar to what is stated, <italic>And thou shalt eat before the Eternal thy G-d</italic> etc. <italic>the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herd</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1725">369</xref></sup> [meaning &#x201C;he who is fit to eat,&#x201D; for it cannot mean that all are to eat, for the Second Tithe may be eaten by all ritually clean Israelites, while the firstlings are eaten only by the priests; here, too, the washing of hands and speaking are done only by some, but not all, of the elders].</p>
<p>Now on the matter of breaking the heifer&#x2019;s neck Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra explained<sup><xref rid="fn1724">368</xref></sup> that G-d commanded it to be done for <italic>the city which is nearest unto the slain man</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1726">370</xref></sup> because had they not committed a similar sin, it would not have happened that a man be killed near them, and G-d&#x2019;s thoughts are infinitely profound to us. But the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] said in the Moreh Nebuchim<sup><xref rid="fn1727">371</xref></sup> that the reason for the breaking of the heifer&#x2019;s neck is to discover the murderer and to cleanse [the guilt for the innocent] blood. In most cases the murderer comes from the place <italic>which is round about him that is slain</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1728">372</xref></sup> and when the elders go out and engage in the measuring of the cities, and the elders of the nearest city then bear witness before the Creator that they were not negligent in maintaining and guarding the roads, and that they do not know who killed this man, and as the matter is investigated, the elders gather and bring the heifer, people increasingly speak about it. Then perhaps the matter [of the murderer&#x2019;s identity] will be solved. The Rabbis have already said<sup><xref rid="fn1729">373</xref></sup> that even if a maidservant comes and declares that a certain person committed the murder, the heifer is not killed [despite the fact that such testimony is not sufficient to convict]. And if the murderer is known and they are silent about him, yet call upon the Creator as their witness that they do not know him, this would be a great wickedness, and whoever knows the slightest thing about it will come and tell. Thus it [the murderer&#x2019;s identity] will become public knowledge, and he will be killed either through the court, or the king, or the avenger of the blood. This law receives added force because the place in which the heifer&#x2019;s neck is broken may never be tilled or sown. Those who see [the field] recognize it and discuss it. [Thus far are the words of Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon.] Hence according to this reason there is a benefit in this rite. But the act [i.e., the breaking of the heifer&#x2019;s neck] is not a pleasing one in itself and it would have been more fitting that it be done in a good field fit for sowing that could be recognized by those who see it, for in &#x201C;a hard valley,&#x201D; the reason for not being tilled, will not be obvious [because people will assume that it is left barren due to its stony ground]&#x0021; In my opinion the reason for it is similar to that of the offerings which are done outside [of the Sanctuary Court], such as the goat sent [to Azazel]<sup><xref rid="fn1730">374</xref></sup> and the Red Heifer.<sup><xref rid="fn1731">375</xref></sup> Therefore the Rabbis have counted<sup><xref rid="fn1732">376</xref></sup> the commandment of breaking the heifer&#x2019;s neck among the <italic>chukim</italic> [&#x201C;the statutes&#x201D; &#x2014; the class of commandments for which we do not know the reasons].</p>
<ftnote id="fn1357">(1) Exodus 22:8. <italic>Ha&#x2019;elohim</italic> indicates that &#x201C;the judges&#x201D; had received ordination.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1359">(3) Ezekiel 44:24.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1360">(4) Thus, when there are courts of ordained judges functioning in the Land of Israel, Jews living outside of the Land are not obligated to appoint judges, for, if there is some litigation between them they can appear before the judges in the Land. &#x2014; On ordination, see further Note 8; also, Vol. II, p. 339, Note 20.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1363">(7) Numbers 35:29.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1364">(8) Ordination was the process of investiture with judicial rights and functions which had continued in an unbroken chain from Moses our teacher. Since ordination was valid only if both the ordainers and the ordained were in the Land of Israel, this process of investiture ceased to exist sometime in the middle of the fourth century [Common Era] because the severe Roman persecutions of the Jews in the Land of Israel forced them to migrate to Babylon and elsewhere. According to Rambam, if <italic>all</italic> Sages in the Land of Israel would agree to reinstitute ordination, they are empowered to do so (Mishneh Torah, <italic>Shoftim, Hilchoth Sanhedrin</italic> 4:11). Such an attempt was made by Rabbi Yaakov Beirav of Safed in the middle of the sixteenth century in the days of Rabbi Yoseph Karo, author of the Shulchan Aruch. The attempt failed for various reasons, one of them being that Rambam concluded his statement with the equivocal phrase &#x201C;and the matter needs yet a final decision.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1367">(11) By this principle judges are empowered nowadays to adjudicate matters which are common occurrences and involve monetary losses, such as loans, <italic>Kethubah</italic> (marriage contract), inheritance, damages, etc. But matters not of common occurrence [such as one animal damaging another] or not involving a monetary loss [such as the additional amount levied as a fine upon returning stolen goods] are not enforceable. See Choshen Mishpat, I, for further clarification of this principle.</ftnote>

The Sages say that the special sin-offering for the erroneous decision of a court applies only to the Great Sanhedrin of all Israel. Ramban&#x2019;s intent in citing this part of the Mishnah was only to indicate that the Great Court of a tribe is mentioned in the Mishnah.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1390">(34) Ramban&#x2019;s point is as follows: According to Rashi&#x2019;s interpretation it is as if there is a <italic>vav</italic> missing in the word <italic>kol</italic> (any) which should be <italic>v&#x2019;kol</italic> (nor any). Thus, Rashi interprets the verse: we may not plant a tree for an idolatrous purpose anywhere, &#x201C;nor any&#x201D; tree, even for beauty&#x2019;s sake, beside the altar of G-d. Ramban agrees to all that. However, Rashi adds that &#x201C;building a [wooden] house on the Temple mount&#x201D; is likewise prohibited; Ramban points out that this is forbidden only by law of the Rabbis.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1435">(79) On Rav Saadia see Vol. II, p. 99, Note 230. On the title Gaon see <italic>ibid.</italic>, p. 521, Note 74. Rav Saadia&#x2019;s comment is quoted here by Ibn Ezra.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1436">(80) Rav Saadia holds that even in capital cases which require a court of twenty-three judges, witnesses need not testify in the presence of all the judges; it is sufficient that they testify in the presence of three judges who may receive their testimony on behalf of the full court. The phrase <italic>at the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses</italic> thus means: &#x201C;upon the testimony of two witnesses who appear before the entire court of twenty-three judges, or by the word of the three judges who officially accepted the testimony of the witnesses and later relayed it to the entire court &#x2014; shall the one that is to die be put to death. Ramban will refute this interpretation of the Gaon, for there is in the verse etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1437">(81) For, according to Rashi, the expression <italic>matters of controversy</italic> refers back to <italic>between blood and blood</italic> etc. Ramban will explain <italic>matters of controversy</italic> as an independent expression, as explained further on.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1446">(90) Following the destruction of the Second Temple, the Sanhedrin was re-established in Jabneh under the presidency of Rabban Yochanan ben Zaccai (see above, Note 19). It happened that his successor Rabban Gamaliel, once accepted the testimony of two witnesses with regard to proclaiming the New Moon. Rabbi Yehoshua held that their evidence was invalid, and that the New Moon should be proclaimed a day later. Since the month was Tishri, the Day of Atonement [i.e., the tenth of Tishri] would fall a day later according to Rabbi Yehoshua than according to the reckoning of Rabban Gamaliel. When Rabbi Yehoshua refused to accept the opinion of his colleague, who, by virtue of his presidency of the Sanhedrin, had the authority to make the binding decision, Rabban Gamaliel sent to him, &#x201C;I order you to come to me carrying your walking stick and your money on the day <italic>you</italic> reckon to be the Day of Atonement. The order caused Rabbi Yehoshua personal anguish because carrying is forbidden on the Day of Atonement. The affair ended with Rabbi Yehoshua obeying Rabban Gamaliel&#x2019;s command. When Rabbi Yehoshua arrived, &#x201C;Rabban Gamaliel stood up and kissed him on the head and said to him; &#x2018;Come in peace, my master and my disciple&#x2019; &#x2014; &#x2018;my master&#x2019; in wisdom, and &#x2018;my disciple&#x2019; because you accepted my words&#x201D; (Rosh Hashanah 25a).</ftnote>

Nevertheless Ramban is compelled to define it in the present tense because we find no preceding text wherein G-d prohibited the return to Egypt. Hence we must interpret the word <italic>amar</italic> in the present tense, &#x201C;since G-d is saying to you &#x2026;&#x201D; Further, Ramban will explain <italic>amar</italic> in the ordinary past tense.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1521">(165) It should be noted that Ramban wrote this explanation of the world order in terms of scientific concepts known to his generation. Yet is it not a fact that conditions on the earth are affected by the atmospheric conditions above? Do not the sun-spots millions of miles away affect terrestrial magnetism and meteorological phenomena? So conditions on the earth are indeed affected by the powers above us. The central point in Ramban&#x2019;s theme is thus easily applicable.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1522">(166) The origin of this dictum is unknown to me.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1523">(167) The thought conveyed is that both words <italic>oneg</italic> and <italic>nega</italic> are spelled with the same letters <italic>ay&#x2019;in, nun, gimmel</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn1585">(229) In I Kings 20:35 it is told that, following a decisive battle in which Ahab king of Israel defeated Ben-hadad of Syria, Ahab befriended Ben-hadad instead of killing him as a prophet had commanded him to do. To show G-d&#x2019;s displeasure with Ahab, Scripture relates, <italic>And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his fellow by the word of the Eternal: &#x2018;Smite me, I pray thee.&#x2019; And the man refused to smite him</italic>. The following verse says that the man was slain by a lion because of his refusal to obey the prophet. The lesson was clear: just as that man was punished, so would Ahab be punished for disobeying the prophetic command to smite Ben-hadad. Now this <italic>certain man of the sons of the prophets</italic> is identified by tradition as having been Micaiah [a prophet mentioned there in Chapter 22 Verse 13]. When Micaiah ordered the man to smite him, he gave no sign that he was a prophet, yet the man was punished for disobeying&#x0021; Hence the Gemara&#x2019;s question: How was he to know that Micaiah was a prophet?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1586">(230) Verse 22. Rashi attempts to answer the question, how we are to know when to obey some one who claims to be a prophet? Regarding such a case, he writes, &#x201C;they have already etc.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1637">(281) Thus, an important distinction is drawn between testimony that is totally <italic>refuted</italic>, and thus nullified, and testimony that is merely contradicted. Ramban holds that if the second pair says, &#x201C;How can you testify so, when at the same time you say Reuben killed Shimon <italic>you yourselves</italic> were with us in another place, far removed from that scene,&#x201D; the first witnesses stand totally refuted and nullified. On the other hand, if the second pair merely contradicts the first pair by claiming that the alleged crime did not take place, we have a case of contradictory witnesses &#x2014; two against two. If <italic>refutation</italic> is established and the person on trial has not yet been executed, then the plotting witnesses are subject to the same penalty they wanted to inflict upon their brother. If the verdict has already been executed, see Ramban further in Verse 19.

<ftnote id="fn1638">(282) The point is thus made clear, that when witnesses are &#x201C;refuted&#x201D; it is they personally who are refuted. Therefore, they are subject to the law of punishment of plotting witness, (see Note 281) for it is as if the second witnesses testified that the first pair committed a mortal sin in which case the defendants are not believed to say &#x201C;We have not done so.&#x201D; See further, my Hebrew commentary, pp. 433-434.</ftnote>

<title>Ki Theitzei</title>
<p>11. A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. Scripture speaks of the common case. And in the Sifre it is stated:<sup><xref rid="fn1733">1</xref></sup> &#x201C;Whence do we know that [the same law applies] even if she be ugly? From what Scripture states, <italic>and thou desirest her</italic> &#x2014; even though she is not beautiful.&#x201D; And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented: &#x201C;<italic>A beautiful woman</italic> &#x2014; in his eyes.&#x201D; Thus the expression [<italic>a beautiful woman</italic>] is connected with [the first word in the verse] <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;ra&#x2019;itha&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and thou seest</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1734">2</xref></sup> Scripture mentions <italic>and thou desirest her</italic>, denoting that he is not to permit her to himself except because of lust &#x2014; when his impulse overpowers him. However, if he discovers within himself that he has no lust for cohabitation with her, but he wants just to take a wife, he should not marry her. Thus the Rabbis have said in the Sifre:<sup><xref rid="fn1735">3</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And thou wouldest take her to thee to wife</italic>. You are not to say, &#x2018;This one is for [my] father, that one for my brother.&#x2019; &#x201D; And in the Gemara<sup><xref rid="fn1736">4</xref></sup> we find that he is not to take two women &#x2014; one for his son and one for himself, or one for his father and one for himself. Now the prohibition against taking one for his son [or for his father] applies even to her alone [i.e., if he has not taken one for himself].</p>
<p>12. &#x2018;V&#x2019;ASETHAH&#x2019; HER NAILS. &#x201C;She shall &#x2018;let them grow,&#x2019; [the reason being] that she should become repulsive.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language which accords with the words of Rabbi Akiba,<sup><xref rid="fn1735">3</xref></sup> and so did Onkelos explain it [&#x201C;and she shall let her nails grow&#x201D;]. Now, according to their opinion the word <italic>v&#x2019;asethah</italic> will be like <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;asath&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and it shall bring forth</italic>) <italic>the produce</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1737">5</xref></sup> for &#x201C;growth&#x201D; is termed <italic>asiyah</italic> (doing). But in the Sifre<sup><xref rid="fn1735">3</xref></sup> there is stated a proof to the words of Rabbi Eliezer [who explains <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;asethah&#x2019; her nails</italic> &#x2014; and &#x201C;she shall cut&#x201D; her nails] from the following verse, <italic>and he</italic> [Mephibosheth] <italic>had neither &#x2018;asah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>dressed</italic>) <italic>his feet</italic> [i.e., cut the nails] <italic>nor &#x2018;asah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>trimmed</italic>) <italic>his beard</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1738">6</xref></sup> And this is indeed a great proof&#x0021;</p>
<p>Therefore I say that these are all regulations of mourning, all connected with the expression, <italic>and she shall bewail her father and mother</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1739">7</xref></sup> Thus he commanded that <italic>she shall shave her head</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1740">8</xref></sup> similar to what is written of Job [when he heard of the death of his children], <italic>and he shaved his head</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1741">9</xref></sup> and so also, <italic>cut off thy hair</italic>, [<italic>and cast it away, and take up a lamentation</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn1742">10</xref></sup> So, too, the cutting of nails is a form of mourning like the shaving of the head. He states, <italic>and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1739">7</xref></sup> that is to say, she shall don the garments of mourning, <italic>and she shall remain in thy house</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1739">7</xref></sup> like a widow and not go outside at all, <italic>and she shall bewail her father and her mother</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1739">7</xref></sup> doing all this <italic>a full month</italic>, for such is the custom of mourners.</p>
<p>And in the opinion of our Rabbis<sup><xref rid="fn1743">11</xref></sup> who say that all [these regulations] were intended to mar her beauty [the sense of the verses is as follows]: He commanded that she remove her beautiful garments, for [among] the heathens &#x2014; accursed ones &#x2014; their daughters adorned themselves in wartime in order to entice [the enemy] after them. She is to shave her head, which is considered a great disgrace, and pare her nails, for the custom of women is to let them grow and paint them with forms of stibium or other tints. And Scripture denotes the paring of a thing with the term <italic>asiah</italic> [&#x201C;making&#x201D; &#x2014; <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;asethah&#x2019; her nails</italic>] because people cut the hair of the legs and the upper lip, as well as the nails when they grow [thus &#x201C;making&#x201D; and putting them in order].</p>
<p>It appears to me that [the term <italic>asiah</italic> in this connection] is an abbreviated expression, [Scripture] being accustomed to speak briefly concerning a self-evident matter. The sense of the verse, <italic>and he had neither &#x2018;asah&#x2019; his feet nor &#x2018;asah&#x2019; his beard</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1738">6</xref></sup> is that he [Mephibosheth] had not &#x201C;done&#x201D; what was appropriate to be done to them, alluding to the shaving of the hair on the legs and the beard, or to the washing of the feet themselves. Such also is the opinion of Yonathan ben Uziel who rendered the verse, &#x201C;he did not wash his feet nor trim his beard.&#x201D; So also <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;asethah&#x2019; her nails</italic> means &#x201C;and she shall do that which is done with the nails &#x201C;[i.e., paring them]. And the commentators<sup><xref rid="fn1744">12</xref></sup> have said that the meaning of the term <italic>asiah</italic> is &#x201C;setting in order.&#x201D; And such is the meaning of the expression, <italic>and he hastened &#x2018;la&#x2019;asoth&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>to dress</italic>) <italic>it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1745">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>And the reason for this section [i.e. of all these regulations] is that she is converted against her will, and no one asks her whether she is willing to abandon her religion and become Jewish as is [customarily] done with proselytes. Instead, the [future] husband tells her that she must observe the law of Israel against her will and abandon her gods. This is the reason for the verse, <italic>and she shall bewail her father and her mother a full month</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1739">7</xref></sup> because she abandons her people and her gods.<sup><xref rid="fn1746">14</xref></sup> This is the interpretation of Rabbi Akiba<sup><xref rid="fn1747">15</xref></sup> who says that <italic>her father</italic> means only the idols, similar to what is said, <italic>They say to a stock, &#x2018;thou art my father,&#x2019; and to a stone, &#x2018;thou hast brought us forth</italic>.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1748">16</xref></sup> In general, then, she is mourning because she is leaving her religion and joining another people. It is possible that the court imposes upon her to undergo immersion [in a ritual pool for the purpose of conversion] against her will just as is done with [Canaanite] bondmen,<sup><xref rid="fn1749">17</xref></sup> and because she does not convert to Judaism through the normal procedure, Scripture removed her [from her master] all this time.</p>
<p>Now, the reason for [her] mourning and bewailing [which Scripture commanded] according to the opinion of our Rabbis<sup><xref rid="fn1747">15</xref></sup> is in order that she should become repulsive, so that his desire for her may wane. And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote that the Torah assigned her a period [of mourning] in accordance with the custom of those who weep for the dead in honor of her father and her mother who died in the battle. And the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] wrote in the Moreh Nebuchim<sup><xref rid="fn1750">18</xref></sup> that this regulation was out of compassion for her, that she find comfort for herself, for those in misery find comfort and calm in their weeping and mourning, and during that time he must not force her to leave her religion, nor may he cohabit with her.</p>
<p>In my opinion this respite is not primarily intended to show compassion for her, but to eliminate the names of idols from her mouth and her heart. The wandering away and separation from her father and her mother and her people will further &#x201C;quench the coal,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1751">19</xref></sup> for it is improper to cohabit with a woman who is coerced and in mourning. This is similar to the case our Rabbis, of blessed memory, have mentioned<sup><xref rid="fn1752">20</xref></sup> with respect to illegitimates, &#x201C;children born of a wife whose husband has decided to divorce her,&#x201D; and surely of this captive woman who cries out in her heart to her gods to save her and bring her back <italic>unto her people and unto her gods</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1753">21</xref></sup> Thus when they inform her that we will force her to give up her people and her native land, and convert to Judaism, we must tell her, &#x201C;Be comforted for <italic>thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1754">22</xref></sup> whom <italic>ye shall not see any more, forever</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1755">23</xref></sup> but, instead, be your master&#x2019;s wife,<sup><xref rid="fn1756">24</xref></sup> in accordance with the law of Moses and Jewish custom.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1757">25</xref></sup> Then we are to give her a time for weeping and mourning as is the way of mourners in order to assuage her sorrow and her longing, for <italic>in all sorrow there is profit</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1758">26</xref></sup> and consolation afterwards. Now, during that time she has pondered in her mind about the conversion, and has partly eradicated from her heart her idols, people, and native land, she has consoled herself for them and has attached herself to this man to whom she knows she will become [a wife] and has become accustomed to him. Therefore Scripture states, <italic>and thou shalt bring her to thy house</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1740">8</xref></sup> which the Rabbis have interpreted:<sup><xref rid="fn1735">3</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>To thy house</italic> &#x2014; and not to the house of another person.&#x201D; Similarly, <italic>and she shall remain in thy house</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1739">7</xref></sup> meaning that all this time she is to stay in the house which he uses, [for the reason that] perhaps she will desire and consent to [marry] him.<sup><xref rid="fn1759">27</xref></sup> And in general, all these regulations are on account of the compulsion, but if she voluntarily expresses a desire to be legally converted by the court, she is immediately permitted to him, or even to his father or his brother. And thus the Rabbis have said in the Chapter <italic>Hacholeitz</italic>:<sup><xref rid="fn1760">28</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And she shall bewail her father and her mother a full month</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1739">7</xref></sup> This applies only if she did not take it upon herself [to be converted,] but if she took it upon herself, she undergoes immersion and is permitted immediately.&#x201D; It is possible that with all prisoners of war we are to act according to this law [even if she wishes to convert], because she might express her desire to be converted [at once] out of fear [of the regulations mentioned in this section. Therefore, we must question the sincerity of her expressed desire to convert].</p>
<p>He states, <italic>And it shall be, if thou have no desire for her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1761">29</xref></sup> meaning that she may do as she wishes and we must not force her to observe the law of Moses and Jewish custom. For, if she converts voluntarily we may compel her to observe the Torah, and if she profanes the Sabbath [by doing forbidden work thereon] she is to be stoned, and if she eats swine&#x2019;s flesh she is to be scourged, as is the law of an apostate Israelite.<sup><xref rid="fn1762">30</xref></sup> Moreover, if she herself confessed that the conversion was not coerced, we may not let her go as she wishes, for even if we suspect that her conversion was due to fear, her status is that of a true Israelite woman, for we have already decided the law<sup><xref rid="fn1763">31</xref></sup> that all [who are converted whether out of fear or gain] have the status of proselytes.</p>
<p>13. AND AFTER THAT THOU MAYEST COME UNTO HER, AND BE HER HUSBAND. The Rabbis have commented in the Sifre:<sup><xref rid="fn1747">15</xref></sup> &#x201C;You have no privilege in her except cohabitation.&#x201D; By this the Rabbis meant to say that betrothal with money or a writ<sup><xref rid="fn1764">32</xref></sup> is not binding on her. Even the cohabitation is not for the purpose of betrothal, since her status is still that of an idolatress upon whom betrothal is not binding; however, Scripture permitted him to cohabit with her.<sup><xref rid="fn1765">33</xref></sup> And because Scripture states [at the expiration of the thirty-day mourning period], <italic>and she shall be thy wife</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1766">34</xref></sup> it indicates that she becomes his real wife, and if she commits adultery while living with him, she is to be tried as a married woman. Thus the Rabbis have said in the Gemara of Tractate Kiddushin:<sup><xref rid="fn1767">35</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And thou wouldest take her to thee to wife</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1768">36</xref></sup> You have possession of her [through legal marriage],&#x201D; that is, after following these regulations. And in the Sifre the Rabbis have said,<sup><xref rid="fn1747">15</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And she shall be thy wife</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1766">34</xref></sup> similar to what is stated, <italic>her food, her raiment, and her conjugal rights, he shall not diminish</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1769">37</xref></sup> If so, she is his wife in all respects seeing that the Torah gave him possession of her.</p>
<p>And in line with the simple meaning of Scripture it appears that he is prohibited from cohabiting with her at all until after he has gone through this entire procedure, this being the sense of the expression, <italic>and after that thou mayest come unto her, and be her husband</italic>. And that which Scripture stated, <italic>and thou desirest her, and thou wouldest take her to thee to wife</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1768">36</xref></sup> means that he would take her for his wife after [complying with] all these regulations which it will command. Similarly, <italic>so that I took her to be my wife</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1770">38</xref></sup> [means that Pharaoh took her to his house to be his wife]. However, in the Gemara of Tractate Kiddushin<sup><xref rid="fn1771">39</xref></sup> the Rabbis have said that he is permitted to engage in the first cohabitation [even before the procedure prescribed in this section], this being the sense of the expression, <italic>and thou wouldest take her to thee to wife</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1768">36</xref></sup> They interpreted the expression, <italic>&#x201C;And thou shalt bring her home to thy house</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1772">40</xref></sup> &#x2014; this teaches that he is not to coerce her during battle.&#x201D; The Rabbis connected it with the verse above, <italic>and thou wouldest take her to thee to wife</italic> [stated in Verse 11] meaning, when <italic>thou shalt bring her home to thy house</italic> [Verse 12]. Thus he takes her captive in battle and brings her to his home and to his city, and he cohabits with her in order to bring his lustful heart under control,<sup><xref rid="fn1773">41</xref></sup> and after his first cohabitation she is prohibited to him until he follows through the entire procedure with her. This is the way of the Gemara in many places. But I have seen in the Yerushalmi of Tractate Sanhedrin:<sup><xref rid="fn1774">42</xref></sup> &#x201C;Rabbi Yochanan sent to the Rabbis there [in Babylon],<sup><xref rid="fn1775">43</xref></sup> &#x2018;You say two things in the name of Rav which are not so. You say in the name of Rav, <italic>a beautiful woman</italic> was permitted only for the first cohabitation [prior to the prescribed procedure].&#x2019; And I say neither the first cohabitation nor the second is permitted save only after [complying with] all these regulations, [for it is written], <italic>and after that thou mayest come unto her</italic>, <italic>and be her husband</italic> &#x2014; after she has gone through all these prescribed deeds.&#x201D; And this is the plain sense of the verse.</p>
<p>14. [AND IT SHALL BE, IF THOU HAVE NO DESIRE FOR HER,] THEN THOU SHALT LET HER GO WHITHER SHE WILL. The Rabbis have said thereon in the Sifre:<sup><xref rid="fn1776">44</xref></sup> &#x201C;But not to her fathers&#x2019; house.&#x201D; Now, I do not know whether the intent thereof is to state that she is a Jewess and that we do not allow her to leave the law of Israel and go <italic>back unto her people, and unto her gods</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1753">21</xref></sup> or whether it means to state that he is not to send her to her father&#x2019;s house with attendants, for in that case he would be assisting those who commit a transgression. Instead he is to send her out of his house <italic>to sojourn wherever</italic> she <italic>could find a place</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1777">45</xref></sup> for perhaps she will remain in the Land and <italic>follow the young men</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1778">46</xref></sup> and be married to one of them. Now, since Scripture states that he is to let her go where she pleases, and warns that he not sell her for money and that he not treat her as a slave,<sup><xref rid="fn1779">47</xref></sup> we deduce that she needs no divorce from him. Rather, Scripture considered her to be a married woman as long as she was with him; when he hates her he may send her away like a rape victim.<sup><xref rid="fn1780">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is possible that the sense of the verse is to state that, if he cohabits with her and desires her, she shall become his wife. If he cohabits with her, however, and she is not enticing to him and he does not desire her, similar to the affair of Amnon with Tamar,<sup><xref rid="fn1781">49</xref></sup> he must let her go where she pleases, everything depending upon this cohabitation. For, if after he cohabited with her [the first time] she tarried with him for days and he cohabited with her, and then changes his attitude and hates her, like a man who hates his wife, she had already become his wife, and thus she is Jewish and can be sent away only with a bill of divorce.<sup><xref rid="fn1782">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>THOU SHALT NOT &#x2018;THITH&#x2019;AMEIR&#x2019; (DEAL AS A SLAVE) WITH HER. This is like the expression <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;hith&#x2019;amer&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and he deal with him as a slave</italic>), <italic>and sell him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1783">51</xref></sup> Onkelos in both cases rendered it as an expression of &#x201C;trading,&#x201D; and our Rabbis in the Sifre<sup><xref rid="fn1776">44</xref></sup> and in the Gemara<sup><xref rid="fn1784">52</xref></sup> explained it as a term of &#x201C;serving.&#x201D; Thus it is an express negative commandment<sup><xref rid="fn1785">53</xref></sup> against making any use of her as a bondmaid, and if he did put her to such service he is to be scourged.</p>
<p>It appears to me in line with the simple meaning of Scripture that <italic>thou shalt not &#x2018;thith&#x2019;ameir&#x2019;</italic> [spelled with an <italic>a&#x2019;yin</italic>] is like &#x201C;thou shalt not <italic>thith&#x2019;ameir</italic>&#x201D; [spelled with an <italic>aleph</italic>], as in the expression, <italic>all the workers of iniquity &#x2018;yith&#x2019;amru</italic>&#x2019; (<italic>bear themselves loftily</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1786">54</xref></sup> So also, <italic>Thou hast &#x2018;he&#x2019;emarta&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>acknowledged</italic>) <italic>the Eternal this day;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1787">55</xref></sup> <italic>and in their splendor &#x2018;thith&#x2019;yamaru&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>you shall gain grandeur</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1788">56</xref></sup> &#x2014; exchanging the <italic>aleph</italic> for a <italic>yod</italic> &#x2014; are all expressions of exaltedness and greatness. <italic>&#x2018;He&#x2019;emarta&#x2019; the Eternal this day</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1787">55</xref></sup> means that &#x201C;you have exalted and magnified Him <italic>to be thy G-d</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1787">55</xref></sup> <italic>And the Eternal &#x2018;he&#x2019;emircha&#x2019; this day</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1789">57</xref></sup> means that &#x201C;He exalted and magnified you above all peoples <italic>to be His own treasure</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1789">57</xref></sup> All of these expressions are derived from the phrase <italic>in the top &#x2018;amir&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>of the uppermost bough</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1790">58</xref></sup> Thus the verse here states, &#x201C;Do not exalt yourself nor magnify yourself, by acting as her master to sell her or to use her as a bondmaid. Similarly in Arabic they call a master <italic>amir</italic>. And the usage of the <italic>a&#x2019;yin</italic> and the <italic>aleph</italic> is often identical in the [Sacred] Language. &#x2018;<italic>Peda&#x2019;eihu</italic>&#x2019; (<italic>deliver him</italic>) <italic>from going down the pit</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1791">59</xref></sup> [the word <italic>peda&#x2019;eihu</italic> spelled with an <italic>a&#x2019;yin</italic>] is like <italic>peda&#x2019;eihu</italic> [spelled with an <italic>aleph</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;deliver him&#x201D;], as I have explained with reference to the word <italic>petha</italic> (suddenly).<sup><xref rid="fn1792">60</xref></sup> So also, <italic>cherubim of &#x2018;tza&#x2019;atzuim&#x2019; work</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1793">61</xref></sup> [written with an <italic>a&#x2019;yin</italic>] is like [the same word spelled] with an <italic>aleph</italic>, from the word <italic>&#x2018;hatze&#x2019;etzaim v&#x2019;hatzfioth&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1794">62</xref></sup> meaning &#x201C;the sons and the daughters,&#x201D; for [Onkelos] translated the Hebrew word <italic>keruvim</italic> (cherubim) as <italic>k&#x2019;ruvaya</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1795">63</xref></sup> [&#x201C;like children&#x201D; &#x2014; and hence <italic>cherubim of &#x2018;tza&#x2019;atzuim</italic>&#x2019; <italic>work</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1793">61</xref></sup> written with an <italic>a&#x2019;yin</italic> is identical to the same word written with an <italic>aleph</italic>, thus meaning &#x201C;work in the image of children&#x201D;]. And in the language of the Sages [the <italic>a&#x2019;yin</italic> and <italic>aleph</italic>] are used interchangeably, such as: <italic>omdoth</italic> (appraised) written with an <italic>a&#x2019;yin</italic>, and <italic>omdoth</italic> written with an <italic>aleph</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn1796">64</xref></sup> <italic>beki&#x2019;in</italic> (experts) written with an <italic>aleph</italic>, and <italic>beki&#x2019;in</italic> written with an <italic>a&#x2019;yin;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1797">65</xref></sup> <italic>adin</italic> (yet) written with an <italic>a&#x2019;yin</italic> and <italic>adin</italic> written with an <italic>aleph</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn1798">66</xref></sup> <italic>orchei</italic> (advocates) who advise their clients on how to plead before the judges,<sup><xref rid="fn1799">67</xref></sup> written with an <italic>a&#x2019;yin</italic> and <italic>archi</italic> (a court)<sup><xref rid="fn1800">68</xref></sup> written with an <italic>aleph; aris</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1801">69</xref></sup> (a share cropper) written with an <italic>a&#x2019;yin</italic> and <italic>aris</italic> written with an <italic>aleph</italic>. And we are taught [in the Mishnah]:<sup><xref rid="fn1802">70</xref></sup> &#x201C;Milk enough for <italic>gmiah</italic> [&#x201C;a gulp&#x201D; &#x2014; if enough milk for one gulp was taken from one domain to another on the Sabbath, whoever took it is culpable]. And in the Gemara<sup><xref rid="fn1803">71</xref></sup> they asked: &#x201C;Is the word <italic>gmiah</italic> written with an <italic>a&#x2019;yin</italic> or an <italic>aleph</italic>, and the Rabbis resolved it by quoting the verse, <italic>&#x2018;hagmi&#x2019;ini&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>give me to drink</italic>), <italic>I pray thee, a little water</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1804">72</xref></sup> [the word <italic>hagmi&#x2019;ini</italic> written with an <italic>aleph</italic>] and yet they use the same term <italic>m&#x2019;gama</italic> (taking a drought) written with an <italic>a&#x2019;yin</italic>, such as: &#x201C;[If his teeth pain him he should not] quaff vinegar through his teeth and spit it out but <italic>m&#x2019;gameia</italic> (he may take a quaff) and swallow it&#x201D; [the word <italic>m&#x2019;gameia</italic> written with an <italic>a&#x2019;yin</italic>]. And in the Mishnah of Tractate Keilim in the Tosephta<sup><xref rid="fn1805">73</xref></sup> thereof we are taught<sup><xref rid="fn1806">74</xref></sup> concerning a <italic>mardeia</italic> (the handle of the plough) written with an <italic>aleph</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1807">75</xref></sup> in place of <italic>mardeia</italic> written with an <italic>a&#x2019;yin</italic>. Thus the Rabbis were not at all concerned about interchanging these two letters [the <italic>aleph</italic> and the <italic>a&#x2019;yin</italic>], and so also in many places.</p>
<p>Now, Rashi wrote: &#x201C;<italic>Thou shalt not &#x2018;thith&#x2019;ameir&#x2019; with her</italic> &#x2014; you shall not use her as a slave. In the Persian language, work and service are termed <italic>amirah</italic>. I have learned this from the work of Rabbi Moshe the Preacher.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1808">76</xref></sup> This is true, for I have seen in the Yerushalmi in [Tractate Shabbath] Chapter &#x201C;Rabbi Akiba said&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1809">77</xref></sup> and in [Tractate Abodah Zarah] Chapter &#x201C;All Images&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1810">78</xref></sup> the following text: &#x201C;There [in Babylon] they call a good worker <italic>amira</italic>.&#x201D; It is also commonly used in the Aramaic language, as is written in the Scroll of Susanna:<sup><xref rid="fn1811">79</xref></sup> &#x201C;And the king of Assyria sent to all <italic>amira</italic> (servants) of Nineveh and to all <italic>d&#x2019;amrin</italic> (who serve) on the sea coast, and to the servant of Carmel and Gilead [to come with him to the war], but all the servants of the land disregarded the commandment of Nebuchadnezzar and they were not afraid of him.&#x201D; So also in many places of that book the inhabitants of a land are called &#x201C;<italic>amurei</italic> of the land,&#x201D; meaning those who are servants to the land and make use thereof. Or it may mean that the king of Assyria commanded the soldiers, these being called &#x201C;the servants of the land,&#x201D; for they are subject to the king to go with him in his wars, and they are his soldiers and his horsemen, similar to the expressions: <italic>they &#x2018;served&#x2019; Chedorlaomer;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1812">80</xref></sup> <italic>and many nations shall &#x2018;serve&#x2019; him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1813">81</xref></sup></p>
<p>BECAUSE THOU HAST HUMBLED HER. The Rabbis interpreted it in the Sifre:<sup><xref rid="fn1776">44</xref></sup> &#x201C;Even after a single act.&#x201D; This coincides with what we have mentioned that the Rabbis are of the opinion that he is permitted to engage in the first cohabitation with her as soon as he brings her to his home. From that moment on he is admonished against using her [as a slave] and against selling her.</p>
<p>16. &#x2018;LO YUCHAL&#x2019; [literally: &#x201C;he could not&#x201D; but rendered: HE MAY NOT] DECLARE THE SON OF THE BELOVED FIRSTBORN. This is an admonition<sup><xref rid="fn1814">82</xref></sup> against doing so. Likewise are all such verses as: <italic>&#x2018;Lo thuchal&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>thou mayest not</italic>) <italic>eat within thy gates</italic> etc.;<sup><xref rid="fn1815">83</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;lo thuchal&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>thou mayest not</italic>) <italic>put a foreigner over thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1816">84</xref></sup> And in all these cases, Onkelos translates &#x201C;you have no right&#x201D; [which proves that the verse before us, too, constitutes an admonition], and the purport of these expressions is, &#x201C;you could not allow yourself the possibility of doing so,&#x201D; emphasizing the importance of the admonitions. Similarly, <italic>But he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1817">85</xref></sup> constitutes a positive commandment that he bequeath a double portion to the firstborn. Thus he who equalizes the firstborn with his brothers [i.e., he assigns him a share equal to theirs] violates both a negative commandment and a positive commandment, even though his words are not legally valid. He surely violates both [commandments] if, knowing he [the son of the hated one] is the firstborn, and did not wish to make it known that he is the firstborn and claimed that he is an ordinary son and caused him to inherit like any one of his sons. Now, these are newly-declared commandments. And from that which Scripture states [<italic>he may not declare the son of the beloved firstborn</italic>] <italic>in the face of the firstborn, the son of the hated</italic> it would appear to me that this commandment and this law are binding only during the lifetime of the firstborn. But, if the firstborn died during the life of his father, even though he [the deceased son] inherits his share as the firstborn in the grave and bequeathes it by law to his children, yet if the father wished [to deviate] and said, &#x201C;My sons shall inherit such-and-such of my belongings, and the children of my [late] son, the firstborn, shall take such-and-such of my belongings,&#x201D; his instructions are valid just as they would be valid in a case where there is no firstborn son. Similarly, the father would not be violating this negative commandment if he did not acknowledge the firstborn son only after his death, for I have never found the expression <italic>&#x2018;al pnei&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>in the face of</italic>) except with reference to the living, such as: <italic>&#x2018;al pnei&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>in the presence of</italic>) <italic>Aaron their father;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1818">86</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;al pnei&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>in the presence of</italic>) <italic>his father Terah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1819">87</xref></sup> and similarly all such expressions. [Therefore, in this case, since it states that the father may not do it <italic>&#x2018;al pnei&#x2019; the firstborn of the hated</italic>, it follows that the prohibition is binding only during the lifetime of the firstborn and that the father had acknowledged him as such.].</p>
<p>18. A STUBBORN AND REBELLIOUS SON. In the opinion of our Rabbis<sup><xref rid="fn1820">88</xref></sup> he is not a minor, for a minor is not subject to any punishments ordained by the Torah or to [the observance of] any commandments. Rather, this verse applies to a boy who has grown two hairs [signifying puberty, and, therefore making the child subject to all the laws prescribed by the Torah]. Now, he is liable to two punishments: the first, because he dishonors his father and his mother<sup><xref rid="fn1821">89</xref></sup> and rebels against them, and the second, because <italic>he is a glutton, and a drunkard</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1822">90</xref></sup> transgressing that which we have been commanded, <italic>Ye shall be holy</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1823">91</xref></sup> and it is further stated, <italic>and Him shall ye serve, and unto Him shall ye cleave</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1824">92</xref></sup> &#x2014; as I have explained,<sup><xref rid="fn1825">93</xref></sup> we are commanded to know G-d in all our ways, and <italic>a glutton, and a drunkard</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1822">90</xref></sup> does not know the way of G-d. In general, then, as of now he [this stubborn and rebellious son] has not committed a sin punishable by death, but is judged because of [what he is destined to become in] the end, just as our Rabbis have mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn1826">94</xref></sup> This is the sense of the expression, <italic>and all Israel shall hear, and fear</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1827">95</xref></sup> for he was not executed due to the greatness of his sin, but in order to discipline the public, and so that he not become a menace to others. It is the manner of Scripture so to warn that when the death-penalty is imposed as a deterrent, the execution should serve as a benefit to others. Thus it mentioned the same in the case of the rebellious elder [who defies the decision of the Great Sanhedrin &#x2014; <italic>And all the people shall hear, and fear</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn1828">96</xref></sup> because, in his decision [contradicting that of the court] there is no sin deserving of death, but [the death sentence being imposed only to] deter dissension from the Torah, as I have explained there.<sup><xref rid="fn1829">97</xref></sup> Similar is the case of plotting witnesses<sup><xref rid="fn1830">98</xref></sup> who are executed [for scheming to condemn someone to death] although they have not caused his execution.<sup><xref rid="fn1831">99</xref></sup> Scripture also mentions it in the case of the beguiler<sup><xref rid="fn1832">100</xref></sup> because he is executed merely for his evil speech even though the beguiled has not worshipped the idols, nor hearkened to him; his [the beguiler&#x2019;s] death is rather to chasten the survivors. This, too, is a newly-declared commandment &#x2014; or it may be explanatory of the commandments, <italic>Honor thy father and thy mother</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1833">101</xref></sup> and <italic>Ye shall fear every man his mother and his father</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1834">102</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. AND THOU SHALT HANG HIM. &#x201C;Our Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn1835">103</xref></sup> All that have been stoned must be hanged. It is this which is stated, <italic>for he that is hanged is a reproach unto G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1836">104</xref></sup> and is a degradation of the King, for man is made in the image of the King, and the Israelites are His children. There is a parable of two brothers who resembled each other etc.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1837">105</xref></sup> This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. &#x201C;All that have been stoned must be hanged&#x201D; are the words of an individual Sage [i.e., Rabbi Eliezer],<sup><xref rid="fn1835">103</xref></sup> but the law is according to the words of the Sages that no offender [executed by] stoning is hanged save the blasphemer and the idolator. This is the sense of the phrase, <italic>for he that is hanged is a reproach unto G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1836">104</xref></sup> &#x2014; because people will say, &#x201C;Why was this person hanged? Because he blasphemed G-d or worshipped a particular idol by means of this particular service, and he saw therein this sign or wonder.&#x201D; The discussion of the idol and the service thereof are considered a <italic>k&#x2019;lalah</italic> [&#x201C;a reproach&#x201D; to G-d]. Or it is an expression of &#x201C;degradation&#x201D; as the Rabbi [Rashi] mentioned, from the expressions <italic>and he cursed me with a grievous &#x2018;k&#x2019;lalah</italic> (<italic>curse</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn1838">106</xref></sup> <italic>that his sons did bring &#x2018;a curse&#x2019; upon themselves</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1839">107</xref></sup> [both verses being expressions of] contempt. And the parable concerning the twin brothers contains a secret; it does not refer, as the Rabbi thought, to the Israelites who are called the children of G-d.<sup><xref rid="fn1840">108</xref></sup></p>
<p>In line with the simple meaning of Scripture the verse is stating: &#x201C;If a man has committed a great sin for which he is deserving of death and of hanging on a tree because of the grievous nature of his sin, nevertheless <italic>his body shall not remain all night upon the tree</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1836">104</xref></sup> for the most accursed and blasted of all people is the hanged. Among all forms of death, there is none as ugly and despicable like it [this degradation of the human body], and it is not fitting that we defile the Land and that G-d&#x2019;s curse be within the Holy Land, <italic>for there the Eternal commanded the blessing, even life forever</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1841">109</xref></sup> Therefore <italic>Joshua commanded and they took them down off the trees</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1842">110</xref></sup></p>
<p>In my opinion the affair of Saul&#x2019;s children who were left hanging<sup><xref rid="fn1843">111</xref></sup> was because they were not hanged by a court of Israel, nor by any Israelite. Rather, David who turned them [the seven members of Saul&#x2019;s family] over to the Gibeonites to do as they pleased with them, and it was they who hanged them [Saul&#x2019;s relatives] and did not wish to bury them in order to demonstrate their vengeance against Saul&#x2019;s family, <italic>and those that remain shall hear, and fear</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1830">98</xref></sup> But when <italic>water was poured upon them from heaven</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1844">112</xref></sup> then David knew that their sin had been forgiven, and that <italic>G-d was entreated for the Land</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1845">113</xref></sup> <italic>that the Eternal had remembered</italic> the Land<sup><xref rid="fn1846">114</xref></sup> with rain and the famine would end. Then he commanded and they [the Israelites] buried them with their fathers<sup><xref rid="fn1847">115</xref></sup> in honor of their royal status. David bore no guilt at all [in the entire affair], for we were commanded only that we not defile the Land by allowing someone whom we hanged [to remain on a gallows overnight]. Now, G-d did not want to forgive their sin [i.e., the sin of Saul&#x2019;s conduct towards the Gibeonites] immediately in order to let it be known that G-d loves proselytes, as our Rabbis have said.<sup><xref rid="fn1848">116</xref></sup></p>
<p>And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra said by way of the plain meaning of Scripture [that the phrase <italic>ki kilelath Elokim talui</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1836">104</xref></sup> means] &#x201C;that it is G-d Who invokes the evil, and the curse will descend upon the place near the hanged person, for there is a secret [in the fact that the contaminated air surrounding the corpse] affects the soul [of the living]. Therefore <italic>thou defile not thy Land</italic>. &#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1836">104</xref></sup> Thus whoever allows the body [of a criminal] to hang overnight transgresses both a negative commandment [<italic>his body shall not remain all night upon the tree</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn1836">104</xref></sup> and a positive commandment<sup><xref rid="fn1849">117</xref></sup> [<italic>but thou shalt surely bury him the same day</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn1836">104</xref></sup> Our Rabbis have likewise interpreted<sup><xref rid="fn1850">118</xref></sup> that the same law applies to all other dead, that whoever suffers his dead to remain overnight, except in order to render it honor,<sup><xref rid="fn1851">119</xref></sup> [violates the above commandments]. Just as [leaving the criminal hanging overnight upon] &#x201C;the tree&#x201D; is a form of disgrace, so all forms of disrespect [shown to the dead are also forbidden]. Now, according to the opinion of the Rabbis [that this law applies equally to every deceased, we must say] that the phrase <italic>ki kilelath Elokim talui</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1836">104</xref></sup> states that &#x201C;although this criminal is deserving of disgrace&#x201D; because of his great sin, nevertheless you shall not do so. And the parable of the two brothers [mentioned above] applies to everyone who suffers his dead to remain overnight. So also the curse [emanating from a corpse] to which Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra referred, applies to every house where there is a dead person, and therefore he defiles <italic>everyone that cometh into the tent, and every thing that is in the tent</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1852">120</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. AND THOU DEFILE NOT THY LAND. In the opinion of our Rabbis this is not merely a reason, meaning [that a corpse may not be left hanging] &#x201C;in order that you defile not your Land,&#x201D; for, if so, it would be permissible [to leave the dead overnight] outside the Land. Instead, this is a second negative commandment. Now, whoever leaves overnight the corpse of a criminal hanging, or of any dead body in the Land transgresses two negative commandments [<italic>his body shall not remain all night upon the tree</italic>, and <italic>thou defile not the Land</italic>] and a positive commandment [<italic>but thou shalt surely bury him the same day</italic>]. Outside the Land [whenever someone allows any corpse to remain overnight] he violates the positive commandment [mentioned] and the negative commandment [<italic>his body shall not remain all night</italic>] which is derived from the law of the hanging corpse, as I have explained. It is by reason of this negative commandment that Joshua buried the Canaanite kings<sup><xref rid="fn1853">121</xref></sup> during the day of their execution, although, in their hanging, there would not have been the curse which our Rabbis mentioned with regards to the blasphemer and idol-worshipper. Rather, it was on account of the uncleanness of the Land [which their hanging would have caused] or because he was apprehensive of the desecration of G-d on the basis of the parable of the two brothers, as I have mentioned.</p>
<h1>22</h1>
<p>1. THOU SHALT NOT SEE THY BROTHER&#x2019;S OX OR HIS SHEEP RUNNING AWAY. This is a commandment explanatory of what He stated in the Torah, <italic>If thou meet thine enemy&#x2019;s ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1854">122</xref></sup> Here he added [that the commandment to return lost property refers also to an animal that was] <italic>running away</italic>, for <italic>going astray</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1854">122</xref></sup> implies that it merely strayed from its path and he can turn it [back] into the path without great effort; and now he mentioned <italic>running away</italic>, meaning that it escaped from him and is distant from the owner. He mentioned the term <italic>sheep</italic> for that is liable to be lost,<sup><xref rid="fn1855">123</xref></sup> and therefore he explained here, <italic>And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, and thou know him not, then thou shalt bring it home to thy house</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1856">124</xref></sup> He stated, <italic>And so shalt thou do with his ass</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1857">125</xref></sup> which is an unclean animal; <italic>and so shalt thou do with his garment</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1857">125</xref></sup> even though a garment is not as dear to its owner as are living creatures, and [total] loss is not as common in a garment as it is in animals which may die. <italic>And so shalt thou do with every lost thing of thy brother&#x2019;s which he hath lost</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1857">125</xref></sup> meaning any of his household vessels even though they are not as dear to him as his garment with which he covers himself. And according to the interpretation of our Rabbis he added here many things, such as <italic>and thou hide thyself from them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1858">126</xref></sup> which the Rabbis interpreted to mean:<sup><xref rid="fn1859">127</xref></sup> &#x201C;Sometimes you are permitted to hide yourself from them [and ignore the lost article such as where the finder is an elder and it would be degrading for him to attend thereto, as for example to drive an ass back to its owner]. <italic>&#x2018;Hasheiv&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>returning</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn1860">128</xref></sup> you are to do it even a hundred times; <italic>&#x2018;teshiveim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>thou art to return them</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn1860">128</xref></sup> even to his garden or deserted house&#x201D; [i.e., the finder is not obligated to notify the owner that the article has been returned. The requirement that] return be made by [identification of the lost item and description of] its distinctive marks, and other matters are also derived from this section.</p>
<p>2. AND IF THY BROTHER BE NOT NIGH UNTO THEE &#x2014; meaning that he does not reside near you, for it is not your duty to go to another land with the lost article in order to restore it to him, or that you do not know him at all. In the Sifre we find:<sup><xref rid="fn1861">129</xref></sup> &#x201C;I know only that one is obligated to restore lost property if the loser lives nearby. Whence do I know that he must also do so if he lives far away? From what Scripture states, <italic>and thou know him not</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1862">130</xref></sup> And if so, the phrase <italic>and if thy brother be not nigh unto thee</italic> means that he is &#x201C;not near you&#x201D; in your city that you may inquire about him and identify him [as the rightful claimant], then <italic>it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it</italic>.</p>
<p>In the commandment on assisting someone to lift up his burden, he added a warning thereon constituting a negative commandment [<italic>Thou shalt not see thy brother&#x2019;s ass or his ox fallen down by the way</italic> etc.],<sup><xref rid="fn1858">126</xref></sup> for in the Torah He stated <italic>Thou shalt surely release it with him</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1863">131</xref></sup> [i.e., by helping to unload the burden] which is a positive commandment [and thus we learn that in failing to render assistance one violates both a positive and a negative commandment].<sup><xref rid="fn1864">132</xref></sup> He also adds [here the expression] <italic>fallen down by the way</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1858">126</xref></sup> for there He stated, <italic>lying under its burden</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1863">131</xref></sup> and He mentioned there only <italic>the ass</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1863">131</xref></sup> because it commonly carries a great burden and, therefore, is liable to crouch under it. Also, here it says <italic>thy brother&#x2019;s</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1858">126</xref></sup> and there it states <italic>thy enemy&#x2019;s</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1865">133</xref></sup> and <italic>of him that hateth thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1863">131</xref></sup> meaning [here] to say, &#x201C;Do thus to him [in assisting him], and remember the brotherhood between you and forget the hatred.&#x201D;</p>
<p>6. IF A BIRD&#x2019;S NEST CHANCE TO BE BEFORE THEE. This also is an explanatory commandment, of the prohibition <italic>ye shall not kill it</italic> [the dam] <italic>and its young both in one day</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1866">134</xref></sup> because the reason for both [commandments] is that we should not have a cruel heart and be discompassionate, or it may be that Scripture does not permit us to destroy a species altogether, although it permits slaughter [for food] within that group. Now, he who kills the dam and the young in one day or takes them when they are free to fly [it is regarded] as though he cut off that species.</p>
<p>Now, he [Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon] wrote in the Moreh Nebuchim<sup><xref rid="fn1867">135</xref></sup> that the reason for the commandment to release the mother bird when taking its nest and the prohibition against killing the dam with its young on one day is in order to admonish us against killing the young within the mother&#x2019;s sight, for animals feel great distress under such circumstances. There is no difference between the distress of man and the distress of animals for their young, since the love of the mother and her tenderness to the children of her womb are not the result of reasoning or [the faculty of intelligent] speech, but are produced by the faculty of mental images<sup><xref rid="fn1868">136</xref></sup> which exists among animals even as it is present in man. But if so<sup><xref rid="fn1869">137</xref></sup> the main prohibition in killing the dam and its young applies only when killing [first] the young and [then] the dam [but not vice versa, whereas the Torah forbids it to be done either way]&#x0021; But it is all an extraordinary precaution,<sup><xref rid="fn1870">138</xref></sup> and it is more correct [to explain them as prohibitions] to prevent <italic>us</italic> from acting cruelly.</p>
<p>And the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] said further:<sup><xref rid="fn1867">135</xref></sup> &#x201C;Do not contradict me by quoting the saying of the Sages,<sup><xref rid="fn1871">139</xref></sup> &#x2018;He who says in his prayer: Even to a bird&#x2019;s nest do Thy mercies extend [etc., they silence him,&#x2019; which would seem to imply that there is no reason other than the Will of G-d for the commandment to release a dam when taking its nest], for that is one of two opinions, namely, the opinion of the Sage who holds that the commandments [of the Torah] have no other reason but the Will of the Creator. We follow the second opinion that there is a reason for all commandments.&#x201D; And the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] raised a difficulty from a text in Bereshith Rabbah [which contradicts his theory that there is a reason for every commandment]. The text reads:<sup><xref rid="fn1872">140</xref></sup> &#x201C;And what difference does it make to the Holy One, blessed be He, whether an animal is slaughtered from the front of the neck or the back? Surely you must say the commandments have been given only for the purpose of refining [disciplining] men through them, as it is said, <italic>Every word of G-d is refined</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1873">141</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now, this theory, categorically stated by the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] concerning the commandments that there is a reason for them, is indeed very clear. There is a reason, benefit, and improvement for man in each of them, aside from the reward by Him Who commanded it, blessed be He&#x0021; Our Sages have already stated:<sup><xref rid="fn1874">142</xref></sup> &#x201C;Why were the reasons for the commandments not revealed? etc.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1875">143</xref></sup> And they further interpreted:<sup><xref rid="fn1876">144</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And for stately clothing</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1877">145</xref></sup> &#x2014; this refers to one who uncovers matters that were concealed by <italic>the Ancient of days</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1878">146</xref></sup> And what are these matters? They are the reasons for [the commandments of] the Torah.&#x201D; The Rabbis have further expressed themselves on the subject of the Red Heifer<sup><xref rid="fn1879">147</xref></sup> concerning which Solomon said, &#x201C;I achieved [a knowledge of the reasons for] everything, but the section of the Red Heifer I examined, inquired into, and searched; <italic>All this have I tried by wisdom; I said, &#x2018;I will get wisdom,&#x2019; but it was far from me</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1880">148</xref></sup> And Rabbi Yosei the son of Rabbi Chanina said: The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, &#x2018;To you I reveal the reason of the Red Heifer, but for others it is a statute [a commandment for which we know no reason].&#x2019; For it is written, <italic>And it shall come to pass in that day, that there shall not be light, but heavy clouds &#x2018;v&#x2019;kipaon&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and thick</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1881">149</xref></sup> The word is spelled <italic>yekipaon</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1882">150</xref></sup> intimating that matters concealed from you in this world are destined &#x2018;to be revealed&#x2019; in the World to Come, like a blind man who suddenly sees, as it is written, <italic>And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1883">151</xref></sup> and it is further written, <italic>These things have I done and I did not leave them undone</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1883">151</xref></sup> for I have done them already to Rabbi Akiba&#x201D; [meaning that the explanations were revealed to Rabbi Akiba].</p>
<p>Thus the Rabbis explained that our lack of knowledge of the reasons of [the commandments of] the Torah is but a barrier in our minds, and that the reason for the most difficult of the commandments [i.e., the Red Heifer] has already been revealed to the Sages of Israel [such as Rabbi Akiba, as mentioned in the above Midrash]. There are many such texts among the words of the Rabbis, and Torah and Scripture, which teach to that effect; and the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] mentioned some of them. But those Agadic [homiletic] statements, presenting difficulty to the Rabbi, are in my opinion, intended to express another thought as follows:</p>
<p>The benefit from the commandments is not derived by the Holy One Himself, exalted be He. Rather, the advantage is to man himself, to withhold from him physical harm or some evil belief, or unseemly trait of character, or to recall the miracles and wonders of the Creator, blessed be He, in order to know the Eternal. It is this [which the Rabbis intended in saying]<sup><xref rid="fn1872">140</xref></sup> that the commandments were given &#x201C;for the purpose of refining men,&#x201D; that they may become like &#x201C;refined silver,&#x201D; for he who refines silver does not act without purpose, but to remove therefrom any impurity. So, also, the commandments eliminate from our hearts all evil belief, and [are given] in order to inform us of the truth and to recall it always. Now this very same Agadah [homily] is mentioned in the Yelamdeinu<sup><xref rid="fn1884">152</xref></sup> in the section of <italic>These are the living things:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1885">153</xref></sup> <italic>&#x201C;</italic>And what difference does it make to the Holy One, blessed be He, whether one eats of an animal which is ritually slaughtered or if he just stabs it? Do you benefit Him or harm Him at all? Or what does it matter to Him if one eats clean animals or unclean? <italic>If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1886">154</xref></sup> Surely the commandments have been given only to refine men, as it is said, <italic>The words of the Eternal are pure words</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1887">155</xref></sup> and it is further said, <italic>Every word of G-d is refined</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1873">141</xref></sup> Why? So that [the word of G-d] should protect you.&#x201D; Thus it is clearly stated here that the Rabbis [in this Midrash], meant to say merely that the benefit [accruing from observance of the commandments] is not for His sake exalted be He, [nor] that He is in need of the light of the candelabrum as one might think, or that He needs the food of the offerings and the odor of the incense as might appear from their simple meanings. Even regarding <italic>the memorial He hath made for His wonderful works</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1888">156</xref></sup> that He commanded us to perform in memory of the Exodus and Creation, the benefit is not for Him, but so, that we should know the truth and be meritorious enough to be worthy that He protects us, for our utterances and remembrances of His wonders <italic>are accounted by Him as things of nought, and vanity</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1889">157</xref></sup> And the Midrash brought proof from [the law specifying] slaughter by cutting the neck in front or in the back, meaning to state that all the benefits are to us and not to the Holy One, blessed be He, because it is impossible to say concerning slaughter that there is more benefit and glory to the Creator, blessed be He, by cutting the neck in front than by cutting it in the back or by stabbing the animal. Rather, all these advantages are to us &#x2014; to lead us in paths of compassion even during [the process of] slaughtering. And then the Rabbis brought another proof: &#x201C;Or what does it matter to Him if one eats clean things,&#x201D; &#x2014; that is, foods permissible to the eater &#x2014; &#x201C;or eats unclean things,&#x201D; that is, forbidden food concerning which the Torah declared <italic>they are unclean unto you</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1890">158</xref></sup> However, He implied that [these laws were given to us] so that we might develop a fine soul and be wise men perceptive to the truth. By quoting the verse, <italic>If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1886">154</xref></sup> the Rabbis [in the above Midrash] mentioned the principle that the commandments pertaining to rites such as slaughter by [cutting of] the neck are to teach us traits of good character. The Divinely ordained commandments which define the species [of animals and birds which are permissible to us] are to refine our souls, just as the Torah has said, <italic>and ye shall not make your souls detestable by beast, or by fowl, or by any thing wherewith the ground teemeth, which I have set apart for you to hold unclean</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1891">159</xref></sup> If so, all the commandments are solely to our advantage. This is as Elihu said, <italic>If thou hast sinned, what doest thou against Him? And if thy transgression be multiplied, what doest thou unto Him?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1892">160</xref></sup> And again he states, <italic>If thou be righteous, what givest thou Him? Or what receiveth He of thy hands?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1893">161</xref></sup> This is a consensus in all the words of our Rabbis. Thus they asked in Yerushalmi Nedarim<sup><xref rid="fn1894">162</xref></sup> whether they may open the way [to release one from a vow or oath] by reason of the honor due to G-d<sup><xref rid="fn1895">163</xref></sup> in matters between man and G-d. On this question the Rabbis answered [there]: &#x201C;What is an example of [a vow being released because of] the honor due to G-d? [If you say that it is a case where he swore] &#x2018;I shall not make a Booth, I shall not take the palm-branch, I shall not put on phylacteries&#x2019; &#x2014; but do you call this &#x2018;by reason of the honor due to G-d?&#x2019; It is for oneself that [the observance of the commandments] helps, just as it is said, <italic>If thou be righteous, what givest thou Him? Or what receiveth He of thy hands</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn1893">161</xref></sup> <italic>If thou hast sinned, what doest thou against Him? And if thy transgression be multiplied, what doest thou unto Him?</italic>&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1892">160</xref></sup> Thus the Rabbis have explained that even the palm-branch, the Booth, and the phylacteries concerning which He commanded that they <italic>shall be for a sign upon thy hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes; for by strength of hand the Eternal brought us forth out of Egypt</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1896">164</xref></sup> &#x2014; are not ordained to honor G-d, blessed be He, but to have compassion on our souls. And the Sages have already arranged it for us in the [Closing] Prayer on the Day of Atonement, stating: &#x201C;Thou hast distinguished man from the beginning, and hast recognized him [to be privileged] to stand before Thee, for who shall say unto Thee, &#x2018;What doest Thou?&#x2019; and if he be righteous what can he give Thee?&#x201D; Similarly, it states in the Torah, <italic>which I command thee this day for thy good</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1897">165</xref></sup> as I have explained.<sup><xref rid="fn1898">166</xref></sup> So also, <italic>And the Eternal commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the Eternal our G-d, for our good always</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1899">167</xref></sup> And the intent in all these expressions is &#x201C;for our good,&#x201D; and not for His, blessed and exalted be He&#x0021; Rather, everything we have been commanded is so that His creatures be refined and purified, free from the dross of evil thoughts and blameworthy traits of character.</p>
<p>So, too, what the Rabbis have stated,<sup><xref rid="fn1900">168</xref></sup> &#x201C;Because he treats the ordinances of G-d like expressions of mercy, whereas they are decrees&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1901">169</xref></sup> means to say &#x2014; that it was not a matter of G-d&#x2019;s mercy extending to the bird&#x2019;s nest or the dam and its young, since His mercies did not extend so far into animal life as to prevent us from accomplishing our needs with them, for, if so, He would have forbidden slaughter altogether. But the reason for the prohibition [against taking the dam with its nest, or against killing the dam with its young in one day] is to teach <italic>us</italic> the trait of compassion and that we should not be cruel, for cruelty proliferates in man&#x2019;s soul as it is known that butchers, those who slaughter large oxen and asses are <italic>men of blood;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1902">170</xref></sup> <italic>they that slaughter men</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1903">171</xref></sup> are extremely cruel. It is on account of this [cruelty] that the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn1904">172</xref></sup> &#x201C;The most seemly among butchers is a partner of Amalek.&#x201D; Thus these commandments with respect to cattle and fowl are not [a result of] compassion upon them, but they are decrees upon us to guide us and to teach us traits of good character. So, too, the Rabbis refer to all commandments of the Torah &#x2014; positive and negative &#x2014; as &#x201C;decrees,&#x201D; as they said<sup><xref rid="fn1905">173</xref></sup> in the parable of &#x201C;the king who entered a country, and his attendants said to him, &#x2018;Promulgate decrees upon them.&#x2019; He, however, refused, saying, &#x2018;When they will have accepted my sovereignty, I will promulgate decrees upon them.&#x2019; Similarly did the Holy One, blessed be He, [say to Israel], &#x2018;You have accepted My sovereignty: <italic>I am the Eternal thy G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1906">174</xref></sup> accept My decrees: <italic>Thou shalt have no other gods</italic> etc.&#x2019; &#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1907">175</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, in the Midrash of Rabbi Nechunya ben Hakanah<sup><xref rid="fn1908">176</xref></sup> there is an interpretation with respect to releasing a mother bird when taking its nest, which states that there is a secret in this commandment. &#x201C;Rabbi Rechimaie said, What is the meaning of that which is written, <italic>Thou shalt in any wise let the dam go</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1909">177</xref></sup> and it did not say &#x2018;the father?&#x2019; [This implies that the verse commands] only <italic>Thou shalt in any wise let the dam go</italic> with the honor of that &#x2018;understanding&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1910">178</xref></sup> which is termed &#x2018;the mother of the world,&#x2019; as it is written, <italic>Yea &#x2018;im&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>if</italic>) <italic>thou call for understanding</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1911">179</xref></sup> And what is the meaning of the phrase, <italic>and the young, take thou to thee?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1909">177</xref></sup> Said Rabbi Rechimaie, It means those young that she raised. And what are they? They are the seven days of [the Festival of] Tabernacles, and the laws of the seven days of the week etc.&#x201D; Thus this commandment alludes to a great matter, and therefore the reward for the observance thereof is abundant, [as it is said], <italic>that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1909">177</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. THEN THOU SHALT MAKE A PARAPET FOR THY ROOF. The commandment of the parapet is newly-declared, or it may be explanatory of the prohibition, <italic>Neither shalt thou stand idly by the blood of thy neighbor</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1912">180</xref></sup> But the commandment concerning mixed seeds<sup><xref rid="fn1913">181</xref></sup> is explanatory, for He has already stated, <italic>Thou shalt not sow thy field with two kinds of seed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1914">182</xref></sup> Now, this [prohibition] implied any place where they are sown; here he added that if a vineyard be sown with mixed seeds <italic>that which has been sown &#x2018;tikdash&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>will be forfeited</italic>) <italic>together with the increase of the vineyard</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1913">181</xref></sup> meaning to say that any benefit is forbidden just like <italic>hekdeish</italic> [&#x201C;holy things&#x201D; belonging to the Sanctuary from which we are prohibited to derive any benefit]. The meaning of <italic>&#x2018;pen tikdash&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>&#x2018;lest&#x2019; thou forfeit</italic>) is like <italic>ki tikdash</italic> (&#x201C;for&#x201D; you shall forfeit). So also, <italic>And ye shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting &#x2018;pen tamuthu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>&#x2018;lest&#x2019; ye die</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1915">183</xref></sup> [is like <italic>ki tamuthu</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;for&#x201D; you shall die]. Likewise, <italic>Neither shall ye touch it &#x2018;pen t&#x2019;muthun&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>&#x2018;lest&#x2019; ye die</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1916">184</xref></sup> [is like <italic>ki t&#x2019;muthun</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;for&#x201D; you shall die]. It is possible that the meaning of <italic>pen tikdash</italic> is similar to <italic>&#x2018;pen&#x2019; their adversaries should misdeem, &#x2018;pen&#x2019; they should say, Our hand is exalted</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1917">185</xref></sup> which is like &#x201C;perhaps.&#x201D; The verse thus states: Do not sow the vineyard with mixed seeds, for perhaps they will sprout and the whole vineyard will be forbidden to you, for they do not become forfeit [unless they sprout] as we have been taught,<sup><xref rid="fn1918">186</xref></sup> &#x201C;A grain crop [sown near a vine] is rendered forfeit after it has struck root, and grapes, after they have grown to the size of a white bean.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He states, <italic>Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1919">187</xref></sup> The same law applies to all diverse species of animals. It is an explanatory commandment of the prohibitions, <italic>Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1914">182</xref></sup> for it is the custom of tillers of their soil to bring their working animals into the same stall and gender them.<sup><xref rid="fn1920">188</xref></sup> And in the matter of <italic>sha&#x2019;atneiz</italic> [a garment of mingled stuff] he explained here that it applies only to [a combination of] wool and linen. He mentioned <italic>Thou shalt not wear</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1921">189</xref></sup> in order to teach that <italic>coming upon thee</italic> [<italic>Neither shall there &#x2018;come upon thee&#x2019; a garment of two kinds of stuff</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn1914">182</xref></sup> is forbidden only if it is worn as a garment [indicated by the term &#x201C;wear&#x201D; used in the verse before us].<sup><xref rid="fn1922">190</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. IF ANY MAN &#x2018;YIKACH&#x2019; (TAKE) A WIFE, AND COME UNTO HER. The meaning thereof is as follows: When a man will take a wife through the means sanctioned by the Torah which is betrothal with money &#x2014; this being &#x201C;the betrothed&#x201D; he [Moses] mentions [further in Verse 23] &#x2014; and after some time <italic>he came unto her, and hate her</italic> because she was not pleasant to him in conjugal relation, and so he arose early in the morning and came before the court claiming that he did not find her to be a virgin. Now this person intends to divorce her without <italic>the dowry of virgins</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1923">191</xref></sup> which is the <italic>kethubah</italic> (marriage contract) that he wrote her. And because she became betrothed to him under the presumption of virginity, he accuses her of having committed adultery after her betrothal to him. Therefore Scripture states, <italic>But if this thing be true</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1924">192</xref></sup> as the husband said, <italic>they shall stone her</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1925">193</xref></sup> The truth cannot be known except by the testimony of two witnesses. And because, concerning the illicit relations of virgins, Scripture will clarify<sup><xref rid="fn1926">194</xref></sup> that if she were betrothed she is stoned, and if she were not betrothed she is absolved from punishment, it was unnecessary to explain here &#x201C;<italic>But if this thing be true</italic> that she was unchaste while betrothed, and [what is more] she so acted willingly [with anyone other than her lawful spouse] <italic>they shall stone her</italic>.&#x201D; And instead it says by allusion <italic>because she has done a base deed in Israel, to play the harlot in her father&#x2019;s house</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1925">193</xref></sup> the <italic>base deed</italic> being that she did so voluntarily. The expression <italic>to play the harlot</italic> signifies <italic>when a wife being under husband, goeth aside</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1927">195</xref></sup> for an unbetrothed maiden is not termed &#x201C;a harlot&#x201D; if she lies with one of the people, but the betrothed one is espoused to him [her future husband and therefore she is termed &#x201C;a harlot&#x201D; if she commits adultery with another man].</p>
<p>17. AND THEY SHALL SPREAD THE CLOTH. &#x201C;This is a figurative expression meaning, the matter is as white [i.e., as clear] as a sheet.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language, which is the interpretation of Rabbi Yishmael found in the Sifre<sup><xref rid="fn1928">196</xref></sup> and Mechilta.<sup><xref rid="fn1929">197</xref></sup> But there is no need for it. For <italic>this was the custom in former time in Israel:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1930">198</xref></sup> they would bring the groom and bride into the bridal chamber and examine them, and the witnesses would guard them outside &#x2014; these being termed <italic>shoshbinin</italic> (friends)<sup><xref rid="fn1931">199</xref></sup> by the Sages. When they separated, the witnesses would enter and take the cloth on which he laid with her and see the proof of her virginity. This [procedure] is known in the Talmud and in books of Agadah [homily], and they would call this cloth <italic>sudor</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1932">200</xref></sup> Therefore, Scripture states that her father and mother should spread the cloth which they took from the hands of the witnesses and say, <italic>These are the tokens of my daughter&#x2019;s virginity</italic>. Now surely there is still a need to clarify matters with respect to many items about which Scripture spoke briefly.<sup><xref rid="fn1933">201</xref></sup> But the intent of [the Sifre and Mechilta in] stating &#x201C;This is a figurative expression,&#x201D; is only in accordance with the opinion which holds that the law concerning a man who defames his wife applies even if he has had no sexual relations with her. [It is according to this opinion that the phrase <italic>and they shall spread the cloth</italic> cannot be literal, for if no cohabitation took place, there can be no evidence in the sheet. Hence, the phrase is figurative, meaning that they are to prove their complaint &#x201C;as clear as a sheet.&#x201D;] But the plain meaning of Scripture is in accordance with the Sage<sup><xref rid="fn1934">202</xref></sup> that this law applies only after he has had conjugal relations with her [and in that case the phrase <italic>and they shall spread the cloth</italic> is to be understood literally]. And thus the Rabbis said in the Gemara:<sup><xref rid="fn1934">202</xref></sup> &#x201C;Rabbi Eleazar<sup><xref rid="fn1935">203</xref></sup> ben Yaakov says, The term <italic>cloth</italic> is literal, and the law is in accordance with his words.&#x201D; And such indeed is the sense of the section [of the Torah]. For Scripture stated first, <italic>Then the father of the maiden, and her mother, shall take and bring forth the tokens of the maiden&#x2019;s virginity</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1936">204</xref></sup> Thus the verse is speaking of both [the father and mother]. Afterwards it reverts to the father alone: <italic>And the maiden&#x2019;s father shall say</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn1937">205</xref></sup> It then reverts and states, <italic>and &#x2018;they&#x2019; shall spread the cloth</italic> &#x2014; the two of them. Now, the reason [for these changes] is that [basically] the claim concerns only the father for [if the husband&#x2019;s accusation is proven false,] the fine [of a hundred silver shekels, imposed upon the husband] belongs to the father.<sup><xref rid="fn1938">206</xref></sup> Scripture, however, made the mother a partner in this affair because women occupy themselves with the subject of the sheet, for it is they who are knowledgeable and expert in blood, and it is proper for the mother to take hold and bring it [the cloth] to court. But the claim, <italic>I gave my daughter unto this man to wife</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1937">205</xref></sup> is that of the father, for the mother is not the adversary of her daughter&#x2019;s husband. Or it may be that after the father presents his arguments in court, he takes hold of the cloth which his wife had brought under the corners of her garment and they both spread it before the court. Thus the mother is not mentioned in the section and did not appear in court at all except for the matter of &#x201C;the cloth,&#x201D; which is to be understood in its literal sense, as I have explained.</p>
<p>19. AND THEY SHALL FINE HIM A HUNDRED SHEKELS OF SILVER. The meaning thereof is that after the husband was administered stripes &#x2014; a punishment deduced from the expression <italic>and they shall chastise him</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1939">207</xref></sup> &#x2014; [he is to be fined a hundred shekels of silver]. For it was customary to write over a dowry of fifty shekels of silver to a virgin, but this person defamed her because he hated her and he wanted to send her away empty-handed. Therefore Scripture punished him with [a fine of] a hundred silver shekels, for the Torah punishes with a twofold measure, as in the case of the verse, <italic>he shall pay double</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1940">208</xref></sup> Although a <italic>kethubah</italic> (marriage contract) is only a matter of Rabbinic ordinance<sup><xref rid="fn1941">209</xref></sup> for whoever made such a condition with her, or who married her without qualification, yet it was customary to write a dowry for virgins, just as it is said, <italic>according to the dowry of virgins</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1942">210</xref></sup> and the majority did so. And if this woman had no <italic>kethubah</italic>, why should he have put forth <italic>wanton charges against her</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1943">211</xref></sup> because he came to her and he hated her &#x2014; he should have written her a bill of divorce and be freed of her, as it is written, <italic>if you hate</italic> [her] <italic>send</italic> [her] <italic>away</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1944">212</xref></sup> [Instead he brought wanton charges against her, therefore he is fined double the normal amount of the dowry of virgins even if he had not given her a <italic>kethubah</italic>.]</p>
<p>22. THEN THEY SHALL &#x2018;GAM&#x2019; (ALSO) &#x2018;SHNEIHEM&#x2019; (BOTH OF THEM) DIE. &#x201C;This excludes unnatural gratification from which the woman derives no satisfaction. <italic>Gam</italic> (also) &#x2014; this is intended to include in the death-penalty those who come after them&#x201D; [as explained further on]. This is the language of Rabbeinu Shlomo [Rashi]. But I do not understand what this means. Is this the case of a virgin that we must exclude or include those who come after them [to commit adultery with her? The verse here speaks of a married woman, therefore] what difference is there between the first [adulterer] and the second and third? Moreover, the text should have read &#x201C;those who come after &#x2018;him&#x2019; &#x201D; [instead of &#x201C;after &#x2018;them&#x2019; &#x201D;]&#x0021; And in our versions of the Sifre it is stated:<sup><xref rid="fn1945">213</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Both of them</italic> &#x2014; this excludes unnatural gratification. Since the verse states <italic>&#x2018;gam&#x2019; both of them</italic> it includes those who come from their backs,&#x201D; meaning unnatural sexual intercourse [sodomy]. Scripture included it here, but all cases of adultery are deduced from this one.</p>
<p>In line with the simple meaning of Scripture the phrase <italic>&#x2018;gam shneihem&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>also both of them</italic>) means &#x201C;[not only] the man who is the more responsible for the sin because he demands it, he seduces her, and commits the act &#x2014; but <italic>&#x2018;gam&#x2019;</italic> (also) the woman.&#x201D; Scripture itself mentions this, explaining the phrase <italic>also both of them &#x2014; the man that lay with the woman, and the woman</italic>. Such is the customary manner of Scripture to ascribe the sin to the man, as I have explained in connection with the verse, <italic>he hath uncovered his brother&#x2019;s nakedness; they shall be childless</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1946">214</xref></sup></p>
<p>And some scholars<sup><xref rid="fn1947">215</xref></sup> say that the phrase <italic>the man that lay with the woman, and the woman</italic> is but an additional explanation [of the pronoun &#x2014; <italic>both of them</italic>], like <italic>let him bring it, the Eternal&#x2019;s offering;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1948">216</xref></sup> [<italic>the kingdom which will not serve</italic>] <italic>him, Nebuchadnezzar</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1949">217</xref></sup> And in the Sifre it is stated:<sup><xref rid="fn1950">218</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>The man that lay with the woman</italic> &#x2014; even if she was a minor; <italic>and the woman</italic> &#x2014; even if she had intercourse with a minor.&#x201D; If so, the meaning of <italic>also both of them</italic> is &#x201C;also either one of them, the man or the woman who has reached the age to be culpable of punishment.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The subject of the betrothed maiden<sup><xref rid="fn1951">219</xref></sup> concerns a case of witnesses seeing from afar a man taking hold of a maiden and lying with her in the city, whereupon the witnesses shouted and warned them [of the sin thereof and its death-penalty]. In the opinion of our Rabbis, both of them are liable to stoning, for the woman also is under presumption of voluntary adultery since she did not cry out at all, for, it is normal for any woman who is raped in the city to scream for help and to be saved. If, however, the witnesses saw in the field that the man grabbed her and lay with her, she is under presumption of having been raped and is therefore free of punishment. The meaning of the phrase [<italic>For he found her in the field;</italic>] <italic>she cried</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1952">220</xref></sup> is thus &#x201C;that she probably screamed&#x201D; [for even though the witnesses did not hear her cry it is presumed that she cried for help; or it may mean even if she had cried &#x2014; there was none to save her,&#x201D; for even if they heard that she did not cry she is free of punishment since there was none to save her. In general, if there are people to save her [and she did not cry] whether it be in the city or the field she is guilty; where there is none to save her whether it be in the city or the field she is free. Scripture speaks of the common case [i.e., that in the city there are people to save her, and in the field there are none &#x2014; but the law as explained is the same in all cases]. Scripture states, <italic>and the man, because he afflicted the wife of his fellow</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1953">221</xref></sup> Now the term &#x201C;affliction&#x201D; applies only to forcible cohabitation, and yet the same verse already declared her guilty as if she committed adultery voluntarily&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn1954">222</xref></sup> But the purport thereof is as follows: When we see a man take hold of a woman and lie with her we adjudge the woman to be consenting because she could have been saved from him, and we consider the man as if he is afflicting her for he did not entice her nor appeal to her to submit to him.</p>
<p>Now, I know not the precise meaning of this law of &#x201C;crying out.&#x201D; If we see a maiden being overpowered by a man and she fights him with all her strength, weeps and takes hold of his clothes or his hair to save herself from him, and she did not realize [enough] to cry out, why should she be stoned? Rather, the &#x201C;crying out&#x201D; of which Scripture speaks is also the common case to deduce that ordinarily [if she did not cry for help] in the city it was a seduction [for had she cried out, people would have come to her rescue] and in the field [we presume] she was forced.</p>
<h1>23</h1>
<p>3. &#x2018;MAMZEIR&#x2019; (BASTARD). The term signifies a man who is <italic>muzar</italic> (estranged) from his brothers and his friends, for it is not known whence he comes. This is similar to the verse, <italic>And a &#x2018;mamzeir&#x2019; shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1955">223</xref></sup> the verse stating that no one will dwell in Ashdod save a foreigner or a stranger who will chance to pass by, for the pride of the Philistines will have been cut off from it [Ashdod]. Now, if a child is born to a man from his father&#x2019;s wife, he [the father] will put him far away and not acknowledge him because of his shame and disgrace [resulting] from the evil deed that he committed. His mother also will cast him away by night, like the <italic>asufi</italic> (any cast-off child whose father and mother are unknown) that is mentioned in the Talmud.<sup><xref rid="fn1956">224</xref></sup> Thus the <italic>mamzeir</italic> is &#x201C;estranged&#x201D; in his native city, and so also the offspring of any of the forbidden relations as our Rabbis have said in Yerushalmi Kiddushin:<sup><xref rid="fn1957">225</xref></sup> &#x201C;Rabbi Abahu said: What is the meaning of <italic>mamzeir</italic>? <italic>Mum zar</italic> (a strange blemish&#x201D;).</p>
<p>5. BECAUSE THEY MET YOU NOT WITH BREAD AND WITH WATER. We find it stated [in Moses&#x2019; message to Sihon], <italic>Thou shalt sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink</italic> etc. <italic>as the children of Esau that dwell in Seir, and the Moabites that dwell in Ar did unto me</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1958">226</xref></sup> [This clearly states that the Moabites did not deprive them of bread and water, and in the verse before us it is mentioned that the Moabites did not meet them with bread and water&#x0021;] Now, many scholars<sup><xref rid="fn1959">227</xref></sup> say that the Moabites did not meet them with bread and water, but that the Israelites bought it from them. But this is baseless, for it is adequate for a camp that they be sold [food] when they want to buy. Moreover, Israel <italic>came not within the border of Moab</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1960">228</xref></sup> and the Moabites brought them forth bread and water for money, and Scripture tells that the Moabites acted as did the children of Esau &#x2014; why, then, were the Moabites forever banned [from the congregation of Israel] on account of this [for not having met them with bread and water], and of the Edomites it declared that we are not to abhor them?<sup><xref rid="fn1961">229</xref></sup> And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra stated<sup><xref rid="fn1959">227</xref></sup> that &#x201C;the expression <italic>as the children of Esau &#x2026; and the Moabites did unto me</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1962">230</xref></sup> refers to the verse, <italic>Let me pass through thy land; I will go along by the highway</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1963">231</xref></sup> but neither [the Edomites nor the Moabites] sold them bread and water. For the Israelites passed through Mount Seir [in Edom] and Ar [in Moab]; it was only to pass through his city where he dwelled that the king of Edom did not permit them &#x2014; this being the sense of the expression, <italic>Thou shalt not pass &#x2018;through me</italic>&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1964">232</xref></sup> [but he did allow them entry through other parts of Edom].&#x201D; This interpretation [of Ibn Ezra] is also baseless, for the Israelites said to the king of Edom, &#x201C;Let me pass through thy land,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1965">233</xref></sup> <italic>and Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1966">234</xref></sup> Thus they did not enter the border of Edom at all&#x0021; And so it is written, <italic>And they journeyed from Mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1967">235</xref></sup> because they had to retreat by way of the Red Sea from Mount Hor which is on the border of the land of Edom, but they did not come into the land of Edom itself at all. Jephthah said it clearly: <italic>But when they came up from Egypt, and Israel walked through the wilderness unto the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh; then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying: Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land; but the king of Edom hearkened not. And in like manner he sent unto the king of Moab; but he would not; and Israel abode in Kadesh. Then he walked through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they pitched on the other side of Arnon, but they came not within the border of Moab</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1968">236</xref></sup> Thus it is clearly explained that they did not come into the land of Edom or the land of Moab at all. Had they come there, the Edomites and Moabites would have sold them bread and water, for it is not customary for one who allows an army to pass through a land not to sell them bread and water.</p>
<p>It appears to me that Scripture banned these two brothers [Ammon and Moab, sons of Lot &#x2014; from the congregation of Israel] because they were the beneficiaries of the lovingkindness of Abraham who saved their father and mother from the sword and captivity<sup><xref rid="fn1969">237</xref></sup> and, by virtue of Abraham&#x2019;s merit, G-d <italic>sent them out of the midst of the overthrow</italic> [of Sodom]<sup><xref rid="fn1970">238</xref></sup> &#x2014; hence they were obligated to do good to Israel and instead they did them evil. One of them [the Moabites] hired Balaam the son of Beor against Israel, and one [the Ammonites] did not meet them with bread and water as they approached their territory, as it is written, <italic>Thou art this day to pass over the border of Moab, even Ar; and thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1971">239</xref></sup> Now Scripture warned the Israelites [concerning the children of Ammon] <italic>harass them not, nor contend with them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1972">240</xref></sup> And yet the Ammonites did not meet them at all [with bread and water], for otherwise Scripture would have stated, &#x201C;As the children of Esau, and the Moabites, &#x2018;and the Ammonites&#x2019; did unto me,&#x201D; but the verse<sup><xref rid="fn1962">230</xref></sup> does not mention Ammon because they did not meet them. Thus Ammon acted more wickedly than all of them, for the children of Esau and the Moabites, when they knew that the Israelites were warned against contending with them in battle, brought bread and water out of their border, but Ammon did not wish to do so. This is the meaning of the phrase, <italic>because they met you not</italic>, that they did not come forth toward them with bread and water as the others did. Therefore Scripture mentioned <italic>an Ammonite</italic> first [<italic>An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of the Eternal</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn1973">241</xref></sup> and it cited his sin first, <italic>because they met you not with bread and water</italic>, and then it mentioned <italic>a Moabite</italic> and his sin [<italic>and because they hired against thee Balaam</italic>].</p>
<p>Now our Rabbis interpreted:<sup><xref rid="fn1974">242</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>An Ammonite</italic>, but not an Ammonitess [if she is converted to Judaism she may be married to an Israelite]. <italic>A Moabite</italic>, but not a Moabitess, because it is customary for a man to meet [a passing camp with bread and water] but it is not customary for a woman to meet,&#x201D; to bring forth food outside of the border of the land. And so the Rabbis also mentioned in the Yerushalmi<sup><xref rid="fn1975">243</xref></sup> and in the Scroll of Ruth Rabbathi:<sup><xref rid="fn1976">244</xref></sup> &#x201C;It is customary for a man to hire but it is not customary for a woman to hire.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1977">245</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. THOU SHALT NOT SEEK THEIR PEACE. &#x201C;Since it is written [with respect to a fugitive slave], <italic>He shall dwell with thee, in the midst of thee</italic> [<italic>where it liketh him best; thou shalt not wrong him</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn1978">246</xref></sup> I might think that the rule also applies to this one [an Ammonite or Moabite fugitive slave]. Scripture, therefore, says, <italic>Thou shalt not seek their peace.&#x201D;</italic> This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. Now, this interpretation in the Sifre<sup><xref rid="fn1979">247</xref></sup> is deduced from the expression [here] <italic>nor their prosperity</italic> [<italic>Thou shalt not seek their peace &#x2018;nor their prosperity,&#x2019;</italic> and not as it might appear from the heading in our text of Rashi that it is derived from the expression <italic>their peace</italic>, for thus is the language of the Sifre]: &#x201C;Since it is stated there [with respect to the fugitive slave] <italic>&#x2018;batov lo&#x2019; (where it liketh him best); thou shalt not wrong him</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1978">246</xref></sup> &#x2014; exclude these [the Ammonite and Moabite fugitive slaves] from this <italic>tovah</italic> (good).&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1980">248</xref></sup> But the expression <italic>Thou shalt not seek their peace</italic> is interpreted in the Sifre as follows: &#x201C;Since it is stated, <italic>When thou drawest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1981">249</xref></sup> I might think that the same rule applies to Ammon and Moab. Scripture therefore says, <italic>Thou shalt not seek their peace. &#x201D;</italic> It is also so stated in Tanchuma.<sup><xref rid="fn1982">250</xref></sup></p>
<p>It appears to me that Scripture has forever forbidden war against Ammon and Moab, and the verse stating, <italic>neither contend with them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1983">251</xref></sup> was not only a temporary command, but a negative commandment for the generations. It is for this [reason] that He said, <italic>because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1984">252</xref></sup> Thus their land belongs to them forever because it is the possession that G-d gave them. If so, the verse here stating, <italic>Thou shalt not seek their peace</italic> commands that if we wage war against them over a city which they captured from other peoples, that we are not to proclaim peace to them. Similarly, if they invaded our Land we are permitted to pursue them and capture cities from them, to smite the inhabitants of those cities who harmed us, as Jephtah did [of whom it is said], <italic>And he smote them from Aroer until thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1985">253</xref></sup> David also did so <italic>to all the cities of the children of Ammon</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1986">254</xref></sup> because they &#x201C;breached the fence&#x201D; first and warred against him. In that event we need not to proclaim peace to them and we may smite those fighting us in <italic>every city, the men, and the women, and the little ones</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1987">255</xref></sup> if we wish. Thus the Rabbis have said in Midrash Rabbah:<sup><xref rid="fn1988">256</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And ye shall smite every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all fountains of water</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1989">257</xref></sup> They [i.e., Jehoshaphat king of Judah and Jehoram king of Israel] said to him [Elisha]. &#x2018;Scripture states, <italic>Thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1990">258</xref></sup> and you say thus [destroy them]&#x0021;&#x2019; He [Elisha] said to them: &#x2018;Scripture commanded this with respect to all peoples, but this one is minor and despised,&#x2019; as it is said, <italic>And this is but a light thing in the sight of the Eternal, and He will deliver the Moabites into your hand</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1991">259</xref></sup> for it is said, <italic>Thou shalt not seek their peace &#x2018;v&#x2019;tovatham&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>nor their good</italic>), this alluding to the &#x2018;good trees.&#x2019; &#x201D; Now, all this is to harm them and to vex them, but the land is to remain that family&#x2019;s for it is the possession which G-d gave them. This subject is mentioned in Agadoth [homilies],<sup><xref rid="fn1992">260</xref></sup> Bereshith Rabbah,<sup><xref rid="fn1993">261</xref></sup> and in Midrash Tehilim.<sup><xref rid="fn1994">262</xref></sup></p>
<p>In line with the plain meaning of Scripture, the purport of the verse <italic>Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity</italic> is as if to say, &#x201C;Although they are members of your family, and your father Abraham loved their father <italic>as</italic> his <italic>brother, that sucked the breasts of</italic> his <italic>mother</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1995">263</xref></sup> yet you should not act towards them like brothers seeking their peace and prosperity, for it is they who have broken the covenant of brotherhood;<sup><xref rid="fn1996">264</xref></sup> let it remain broken forever.&#x201D; Thus G-d guarded for Lot&#x2019;s children the merit of their father who accompanied His prophet [Abraham] on the path where G-d sent him. Therefore He gave them an inheritance from Abraham&#x2019;s possession<sup><xref rid="fn1997">265</xref></sup> and He punished his children for their sin that they could not become attached to Israel. Similarly He banned the Egyptians for three generations<sup><xref rid="fn1998">266</xref></sup> because of their wickedness in bringing upon us <italic>many evils and troubles</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1999">267</xref></sup> but He did not abhor them forever because we were strangers in their land where we found refuge with them in days of famine through the honor they showed our father [Jacob], and they appointed over themselves a chief and ruler from among us. So also did He do with the Edomites. He preserved the merit of the ancestors for them since they were of holy seed,<sup><xref rid="fn2000">268</xref></sup> but he banned them for three generations<sup><xref rid="fn1998">266</xref></sup> because they came forth against us with the sword <italic>and they remembered not the brotherly covenant</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2001">269</xref></sup> Now, the tradition of our Rabbis<sup><xref rid="fn2002">270</xref></sup> is that <italic>the third generation</italic> does not mean &#x201C;the third generation from the days of Moses&#x201D; but when one of them [Edomites or Egyptians] becomes a proselyte his third generation [i.e., his grandchild] may enter into the assembly of the Eternal.</p>
<p>10. WHEN THOU GOEST FORTH IN CAMP AGAINST THINE ENEMIES, THEN THOU SHALT KEEP THEE FROM EVERY EVIL &#x2014; &#x201C;because Satan indicts [people] in the hour of danger.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language.</p>
<p>The correct interpretation regarding this commandment appears to me that Scripture is warning of a time when sin is rampant. The well-known custom of forces going to war is that they eat all abominable things, rob and plunder, and are not ashamed even of lewdness and all vileness. The fairest of man by nature comes to be possessed of cruelty and fury when the army advances against the enemy. Therefore, Scripture warned, <italic>then thou shalt keep thee from every evil</italic>. And by way of the simple meaning of Scripture this is an admonition against doing anything forbidden. And in the Sifre it is stated:<sup><xref rid="fn2003">271</xref></sup> &#x201C;I might think that Scripture is speaking of the laws of defilements and purities and tithes. It therefore says <italic>&#x2018;ervah&#x2019;</italic> [<italic>an unseemly thing</italic>, which refers to unchastity].<sup><xref rid="fn2004">272</xref></sup> Whence do I know to include idolatry, lewdness,<sup><xref rid="fn2005">273</xref></sup> bloodshed, and blasphemy? Scripture therefore says, <italic>then thou shalt keep thee from every evil</italic>. Or perhaps the verse is speaking of defilements and purities, and tithes? It says <italic>ervah</italic> (<italic>an unseemly thing</italic>):<sup><xref rid="fn2004">272</xref></sup> just as <italic>ervah</italic> uniquely represents a deed for which the Canaanites were driven from the Land<sup><xref rid="fn2006">274</xref></sup> and which removes the Divine Presence [from Israel], so all deeds for which the Canaanites were driven from the Land and which remove the Divine Presence [from Israel] are included in the admonition of this verse. When Scripture states <italic>davar</italic> [<italic>thing</italic>, but literally &#x2018;word&#x2019; &#x2014; <italic>then thou shalt keep thee from every evil &#x2018;davar&#x2019;</italic>] it includes also &#x2018;evil talk.&#x2019; &#x201D; This also is included in the purport of the verse we have explained, that besides the [specific] admonitions which are stated concerning these stringent sins, he added yet a [special] prohibition to an army that we guard against any of these sins so that the Divine Presence withdraw not from the Israelites who are there, just as he said, <italic>For the Eternal thy G-d walketh in the midst of thy camp</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2007">275</xref></sup> Thus he who commits any of the great sins while in the army, those about which it is written, <italic>they have set their detestable things in the house whereon My Name is called to defile it</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2008">276</xref></sup> [he causes the Divine Presence to withdraw from Israel]. Moreover, [we are to avoid these sins] in order that the enemy should not overpower us because of our committing the very deeds that cause them to be driven from before us, this being the sense of the expression, <italic>and to give up thine enemies before thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2007">275</xref></sup> The Sages [in the Sifre] added evil talk [as derived from this admonition] in order that contention should not increase among them and smite them with a very great plague, [even] more than the enemy [will inflict upon them].</p>
<p>And by way of the simple meaning of Scripture the verse warns that a man to whom a [nocturnal] pollution occurred, should leave the camp completely for the reason mentioned, that G-d walks among us to help us and the camp is holy, and that our hearts are to be intent towards the Holy One, blessed be He, hoping for His help and that we put not our trust in a human arm.<sup><xref rid="fn2009">277</xref></sup> A similar reason is also for the command to cover excrement,<sup><xref rid="fn2010">278</xref></sup> for the entire camp is like the Sanctuary of G-d. From this law we deduce, concerning a place of prayer, that we must remove ourselves four cubits away from excrement [if it is behind us]<sup><xref rid="fn2011">279</xref></sup> or as far as the eye can see [if it is in front of us]. However, our Rabbis interpreted it:<sup><xref rid="fn2012">280</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Then shall he go abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2013">281</xref></sup> &#x2014; neither in the camp of the Levites, nor in the camp of the Divine Presence&#x201D; when the ark of G-d was there with them. The covering of excrement also, in their opinion, is required when mentioning G-d&#x2019;s Name in prayer or in the reading of the <italic>Sh&#x2019;ma</italic>. If so, this too, is an admonition which he restated<sup><xref rid="fn2014">282</xref></sup> here with respect to an army in order that everything should not be as lawless as in the camps of the peoples. These commandments as well are then explanatory [of those mentioned before].<sup><xref rid="fn2014">282</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now, the reason for covering excrement is not because excrement is like something unclean that defiles its location and breaks through and rises [like the impurity of the dead]. Rather it is because it is forbidden to see it during time of prayer when the heart cleaves to <italic>the Glorious Name</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2015">283</xref></sup> because ugly things give rise to ugliness in the soul and they confound the intent of the pure heart, but when it is hidden from the seeing eye there is no harm.</p>
<p>16. THOU SHALT NOT DELIVER UNTO HIS MASTER A BONDMAN THAT IS ESCAPED. This is connected with the section above that [when you go forth against the enemy] if a slave flees from his master against whom the host has gone forth and saves himself by fleeing to your camp you are not to deliver him to his master for money that he may give you. And since it states, <italic>he shall dwell with thee, in the midst of thee, in the place which he shall choose</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2016">284</xref></sup> it appears that it is a commandment that he become a free man and that we should not enslave him. The reason for this commandment is that with us he will worship G-d and it is not proper that we return him to his master to worship idols. Moreover, it is possible that he [the bondman] may show them <italic>the entrance into the city</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2017">285</xref></sup> for in that way they will capture many cities through slaves and captives fleeing from there. And our Rabbis have said<sup><xref rid="fn2018">286</xref></sup> [that this prohibition is applicable] even [to] a Canaanite bondman who belongs to an Israelite who fled from outside the Land into the Land of Israel, for this one too, should preferably work for those who dwell in the Land of G-d and be saved from working for those that dwell <italic>in an unclean land</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2019">287</xref></sup> and where not all commandments are binding.</p>
<p>18. THERE SHALL BE NO &#x2018;K&#x2019;DEISHAH&#x2019; OF THE DAUGHTERS OF ISRAEL &#x2014; &#x201C;one who is devoted to and always prepared for illicit intercourse. NOR SHALL THERE BE A &#x2018;KADEISH&#x2019; OF THE SONS OF ISRAEL &#x2014; one who is always prepared for pederasty.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. Now, if this prohibition constitutes an admonition against the woman so engaged and warns her against being &#x201C;devoted to and always prepared for illicit intercourse,&#x201D; then an unmarried woman who has [illicit] intercourse with a man unpremeditatedly and secretly is not among those guilty of transgressing a negative commandment&#x0021; So also in the matter of the <italic>kadeish</italic>, why did Rashi mention that he is devoted to &#x201C;and always prepared&#x201D; [for such sin] &#x2014; even one who permits himself to be so abused in an innermost chamber is guilty of extirpation [if there are no witnesses] and death by the court [if there are witnesses]&#x0021; Moreover, it would have been proper for Scripture to state, &#x201C;There shall not be among you a <italic>k&#x2019;deishah</italic>, nor shall there be among you a <italic>kadeish</italic>, &#x201D; for the expressions <italic>of the daughters of Israel</italic> and <italic>of the sons of Israel</italic> make it appear that the verse discusses another nation&#x0021;</p>
<p>It appears to me concerning this prohibition that it constitutes an admonition addressed to the members of the court that they should not permit one of the daughters of Israel to sit in public view at the crossroads for the purpose of illicit intercourse, or prepare herself a tent of prostitution as is customary in foreign lands where they sit at the door with timbrels and harps, similar to what is written, <italic>Take a harp, go about the city, thou harlot long forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be remembered</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2020">288</xref></sup> And similarly Scripture warns the court concerning a <italic>kadeish</italic>. And in line with the plain meaning of Scripture, even if he should lie with women in a tent which he prepared himself for such illicit relations or that he should sit in public view at the crossroads [on the lookout for such women], he warned the court [against permitting such activities].</p>
<p>It appears to me that such is the opinion of Onkelos [who rendered the verse: &#x201C;A woman of the daughters of Israel shall not become the wife of a slave, and no man of Israel shall marry a bondwoman&#x201D;].<sup><xref rid="fn2021">289</xref></sup> But he [Onkelos] combined with this prohibition the matter of a slave and bondwoman who live with Israelites in [common law] marriage, because everyone knows concerning this slave who married the daughter of an Israelite that his betrothal of her is invalid and yet she remains with him like a wife with her husband, and if so she is a <italic>k&#x2019;deishah</italic> in broad daylight.</p>
<p>Now, I have seen in the Sifre the following text:<sup><xref rid="fn2022">290</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>There shall be no &#x2018;k&#x2019;deishah&#x2019; of the daughters of Israel</italic> &#x2014; you are not admonished against it with respect to the nations. <italic>Nor shall there be a &#x2018;kadeish&#x2019; of the sons of Israel</italic> &#x2014; you are not admonished against it with respect to the nations. Now, I could have reasoned: if the <italic>k&#x2019;deishah</italic> [commits] a minor transgression [seeing that the punishment for violation of this prohibition is stripes] yet you are warned against it in Israel, is it not logical that [the crime of] the stringent <italic>kadeish</italic> [which is punished] by extirpation and death by the court, as explained above] be forbidden in Israel&#x0021; [Why then was it necessary to state, <italic>nor shall there be a &#x2018;kadeish&#x2019; of the sons of Israel?</italic>] Or vice versa: if the <italic>kadeish</italic> commits a stringent [crime, yet] you are not admonished against it among the nations, is it not logical that you should not be admonished against the minor <italic>k&#x2019;deishah</italic> with respect to the nations etc.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2023">291</xref></sup> From this text of the Sifre it would appear that the interpretation of the Rabbis does not agree with that of Onkelos, for according to his rendition there is nothing stricter about the <italic>kadeish</italic> than the <italic>k&#x2019;deishah</italic> [since the prohibition against a slave marrying a Jewish woman is of equal stringency to that of a Jewish man marrying a bondwoman]. Moreover, what does the Sifre mean by, &#x201C;you are not admonished against it with respect to the nations&#x201D; [according to Onkelos&#x2019; interpretation]? Similarly, if the interpretation [of the Sifre] of the term <italic>kadeish</italic> were to have been &#x201C;the male who is the subject of pederasty&#x201D; as in the interpretation of Rabbi Yishmael in Tractate Sanhedrin,<sup><xref rid="fn2024">292</xref></sup> then in that case too, the Sifre could not have said &#x201C;you are not admonished against it with respect to the nations,&#x201D; for he who permits himself to be so abused by a heathen is liable to stoning&#x0021;</p>
<p>Rather, it appears that the opinion of the master of this Beraitha is as we have mentioned. Scripture warns the court that a woman may not stand at the crossroads for illicit intercourse, for there she will prostitute herself with those who are forbidden to her, relatives and strangers, for they cover their faces in order to have illicit relations even with their brothers and relatives, this being the sense of what Scripture states, <italic>When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot, for she had covered her face</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2025">293</xref></sup> Similarly he warns the court against him who is ready to be abused by males, similar to what is written, <italic>And there was also sodomy in the Land; they did according to all the abominations of the nations</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2026">294</xref></sup> Now, aside from the admonition against those who commit the sin, he warns the court here that they should not permit a sodomite to stand on the road [ready for such abuse], as is known of them in the land of Egypt that they stand on the road with covered faces like women to do this abominable act. Now the Rabbis interpreted in this Beraitha [i.e., the Sifre quoted above] that we are not admonished concerning others except for ourselves if they do so with one another, for only in matters of idolatry are we admonished with respect to the nations.</p>
<p>The terms <italic>kadeish</italic> and <italic>k&#x2019;deishah</italic>, in the opinion of the commentators,<sup><xref rid="fn2027">295</xref></sup> are an expression of readiness, for they found this usage in the verse, <italic>I have commanded &#x2018;lim&#x2019;kudashai&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>My devoted ones</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2028">296</xref></sup> So also, <italic>&#x2018;hikdish&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>He hath prepared</italic>) <italic>His guests;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2029">297</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;kadshu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>prepare ye</italic>) <italic>war against her</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2030">298</xref></sup> And in my opinion these are all expressions of &#x201C;holiness&#x201D; [consecration], for he who separates himself from illicit sexual relations is called &#x201C;holy,&#x201D; just as it is said, <italic>They shall not take a woman that is a harlot, or profaned; neither shall they take a woman sent away from her husband, for he is &#x2018;holy&#x2019; unto his G-d</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2031">299</xref></sup> Thus the woman who guards herself from forbidden relations and lewdness is called <italic>k&#x2019;doshah</italic> (holy), while she who separates herself from holiness and becomes defiled with illicit sexual relations is called <italic>k&#x2019;deishah</italic>. This is comparable to the usage customary in the [Sacred] Language [to use the same root-letters to express the negative as well as the positive], as for example: <italic>and all mine increase &#x2018;th&#x2019;shareish&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>it would root out</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn2032">300</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;dishnu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and they shall take away the ashes</italic>) <italic>from the altar</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2033">301</xref></sup> For the known harlot, <italic>the defiled one of name and full of tumult</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2034">302</xref></sup> is separated from all holiness. This name [<italic>k&#x2019;deishah</italic>] applies to her only because she is always ready for this abomination, for she has no moment for propriety and holiness at all. And the expression <italic>&#x2018;hikdish&#x2019; His guests</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2029">297</xref></sup> is a figurative expression, for he who makes a feast consecrates his guests and cleanses them so that they should not defile the table and the bread, as it is said, <italic>he is unclean; surely he is not clean</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2035">303</xref></sup> So also <italic>&#x2018;kadshu&#x2019; war against her</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2030">298</xref></sup> means that they should cleanse themselves, like one who cleanses his guests in order that scholarly people [who are meticulous in observing the laws of purity] should not separate themselves from them.</p>
<p>19. THOU SHALT NOT BRING THE HIRE OF A HARLOT, [OR THE PRICE OF A DOG, INTO THE HOUSE OF THE ETERNAL THY G-D FOR ANY VOW]. Harlots are wont to do good deeds with their hire, thinking thereby to atone for their sins, as our Rabbis mentioned in their proverb,<sup><xref rid="fn2036">304</xref></sup> &#x201C;She commits illicit sexual intercourse for apples and she divides them among the sick.&#x201D; Therefore the Torah prohibited a harlot&#x2019;s gift to be brought for any vow, for <italic>now they sin more and more</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2037">305</xref></sup> Similarly the matter of <italic>the price of the dog</italic> is that hunters using dogs and watchmen of walls raise brazen dogs that harm the public, and the owners vow [to contribute] their value [to a cause which they consider sacred], as an atonement for their soul. Such is still the custom among men who ride to the hunts that they place the waxen image of their dogs before an idol that they may be successful with them. And the commentators [as mentioned by Ibn Ezra] have said [that the reason for the prohibition is] because they [i.e., these payments] came about in a contemptible manner.</p>
<p>&#x2018;GAM SHNEIHEM&#x2019; (&#x2018;EVEN THEY BOTH&#x2019;) [ARE AN ABOMINATION TO THE ETERNAL THY G-D]. &#x201C;<italic>Even they both</italic> &#x2014; this includes the products into which they have been processed, such as wheat which she made into flour.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. But in the Gemara<sup><xref rid="fn2038">306</xref></sup> the Rabbis have said that the School of Shammai forbid it and the School of Hillel permit it.<sup><xref rid="fn2039">307</xref></sup> Instead, the verse [in accordance with the teaching of the School of Hillel] is to be interpreted as follows: &#x201C;<italic>They</italic> [are forbidden] but not their young; <italic>they</italic> [are forbidden] but not the products into which they have been processed.&#x201D; And the purport of the expression <italic>gam shneihem</italic> is that since one of them is indeed a great abomination &#x2014; namely, the hire of a harlot, since the harlotry was committed for it &#x2014; [while the price of a dog might be considered less of an abomination] the verse states that &#x201C;even both of these&#x201D; [including the <italic>price of a dog</italic>] G-d will reject. Similarly, <italic>He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the righteous, &#x2018;even they both&#x2019; are an abomination to the Eternal;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2040">308</xref></sup> the verse attaches the smaller offense [i.e., he that justifies the wicked] to the bigger one [he that condemns the righteous]. So also, <italic>then they shall both of them die</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2041">309</xref></sup> as I have explained [there, that the man is the greater sinner of the two, and therefore the verse states that even she is also to die].</p>
<p>Or it may be that the purport [of the expression <italic>gam shneihem</italic>] is that since he had already warned against the disqualifications of the offering through blemishes, and stated concerning them, <italic>Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the Eternal thy G-d an ox, or a sheep, wherein is a blemish, even any evil thing; for that is an abomination unto the Eternal thy G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2042">310</xref></sup> he supplemented here saying that the hire of the harlot and the price of the dog &#x2014; although in themselves perfect &#x2014; that they too are the abomination of the Eternal like those [blemished offerings]. This is the correct interpretation. So also, <italic>The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the Eternal hath made even both of them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2043">311</xref></sup> the verse alludes to man in general and states that G-d created man and also made these characteristics in him. Similarly, <italic>Diverse weights, and diverse measures, both of them alike are an abomination to the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2044">312</xref></sup> the verse intimates to whoever robs, extorts, and exploits in any manner which are greater abominations than these [false weights and measures], although it does not mention them, [and declares that even diverse weights and diverse measures are an abomination to G-d].</p>
<p>20. &#x2018;LO THASHICH<sup><xref rid="fn2045">313</xref></sup> L&#x2019;ACHICHA&#x2019; (THOU SHALT NOT CAUSE THY BROTHER TO TAKE INTEREST). This also is an explanatory commandment, adding here an admonition to the borrower as well, unlike all civil cases, for if a person wishes to damage his belongings he may do so [and it should, therefore, be permitted to the borrower to give freely to the lender]. However, because of the habitual nature of this sin [of giving interest], Scripture admonishes the borrower as well.<sup><xref rid="fn2046">314</xref></sup> And he explained here<sup><xref rid="fn2047">315</xref></sup> that a heathen&#x2019;s interest is permissible. This he did not mention with reference to robbery and theft, as the Rabbis have said.<sup><xref rid="fn2048">316</xref></sup> &#x201C;Theft from a heathen is forbidden.&#x201D; But borrowing for interest, which is agreed upon by both parties and is done voluntarily, was forbidden [by the Torah] only because of brotherliness and kindness, as He commanded, <italic>and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2049">317</xref></sup> and as he said, <italic>Beware that there be not a base thought in thy heart</italic> etc. [<italic>and thine eye be evil against thy needy brother, and thou give him nought</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn2050">318</xref></sup> Therefore he said [here], <italic>that the Eternal thy G-d may bless thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2051">319</xref></sup> for it is an act of mercy and compassion that one does for his brother by lending him without interest, and it will be <italic>accounted to him for righteousness</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2052">320</xref></sup> The release of debts [in the Seventh year] is also an act of mercy among brothers, and therefore he said, <italic>Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2053">321</xref></sup> and for him [who releases the debt of a brother] he designated a blessing,<sup><xref rid="fn2054">322</xref></sup> for Scripture mentions a blessing only in connection with charity and acts of mercy, and not for [the mere abstention from] robbery, theft, and fraud.</p>
<p>He mentions <italic>interest of money, interest of victuals</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2055">323</xref></sup> in order to explain that he who lends one measure of wheat for a measure and a half is [guilty of taking] true interest even if at the time of payment a measure and a half is not worth as much as was the one measure that he lent him. And he further explained, <italic>interest of any thing that is lent upon interest</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2055">323</xref></sup> meaning even building-blocks and other articles which are lent. For it might occur to one to think that &#x201C;interest&#x201D; applies only to money with which everything can be purchased and to victuals which sustain life, but in other things we should go according to the cash value at the time of the loan and the repayment [therefore Scripture prohibited all such interest expressly]. Now our Rabbis have interpreted<sup><xref rid="fn2056">324</xref></sup> the verse, <italic>Unto a foreigner thou shalt lend upon interest</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2051">319</xref></sup> as being a negative commandment derived from a positive commandment [which carries the force of a positive commandment] with respect to lending to an Israelite.<sup><xref rid="fn2057">325</xref></sup> [They rendered this interpretation] because the verse is redundant, for he already stated <italic>&#x2018;lo thashich&#x2019; thy brother</italic> [which implies clearly that it is permitted to exact interest from a foreigner; why then the repetition, <italic>Unto a foreigner</italic> etc.? It was to teach that an interest-bearing loan to an Israelite is in violation of both a negative and a positive commandment].</p>
<p>23. BUT IF THOU SHALT FORBEAR TO VOW, IT SHALL BE NO SIN IN THEE. Because those who bring <italic>a burnt-offering and sacrifices for G-d</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2058">326</xref></sup> receive a good reward for it, as it is written, <italic>I will offer unto Thee burnt-offerings of fatlings, with the sweet smoke of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2059">327</xref></sup> <italic>I will come into Thy House with burnt-offerings</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2060">328</xref></sup> He also said concerning freewill offerings, <italic>and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2061">329</xref></sup> and again He said, <italic>of a sweet savor unto the Eternal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2062">330</xref></sup> And if so, vows serve as encouragement [to the observance] of a commandment, and it is written, <italic>I will pay my vows unto the Eternal, yea, in the presence of all His people</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2063">331</xref></sup> Therefore Scripture states here: &#x201C;Beware of your vows, for although they serve as encouragement in bringing offerings to G-d which will be accepted favorably on your behalf, yet you may come to sin if you vow and do not fulfill, or you delay fulfilling it. But if you do not vow, no sin can attach to you in the matter, for even if never in your lifetime do you bring a [vow-] offering, <italic>it will be no sin in thee</italic>. If so, <italic>observe that which is gone out of your lips</italic>, according to the word which proceeded out of your mouth, and do afterwards as you have spoken, to fulfill all that your spirit caused you to willingly bring forth from your mouth.&#x201D; Solomon said it in the same way: <italic>When thou vowest a vow unto G-d, defer not to pay it; for He hath no pleasure in fools; pay that which thou vowest. Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2064">332</xref></sup> Solomon states that G-d has no pleasure in fools who think that they do a good deed when they utter many vows to serve as encouragement to fulfill a commandment which they plan to do and they do not consider in their hearts, <italic>neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2065">333</xref></sup> &#x201C;Perhaps I will not be able to fulfill all these vows.&#x201D; Instead he thinks that the desire he had at the time of his vow will be accounted to him for good. Therefore Solomon warned again, <italic>Suffer not thy mouth to bring thy flesh into guilt, neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2066">334</xref></sup> that is to say, do not make many vows, [for if you make them and you do not have the means to fulfill them] you will have to say before the cruel angel sent against you, &#x201C;It was an error, I meant to bring them.&#x201D; You pledged them with a perfect heart and now you are unable to do so, <italic>but G-d will be angry at thy voice and</italic> &#x2014; the aforementioned angel &#x2014; <italic>will destroy the work of thy hands</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2066">334</xref></sup></p>

<p>4. [HER FORMER HUSBAND, WHO SENT HER AWAY, MAY NOT TAKE HER AGAIN TO BE HIS WIFE] AFTER THAT SHE IS DEFILED &#x2014; &#x201C;this includes a <italic>sotah</italic> (a suspected adulteress) who had been in seclusion [with a man against whom her husband had warned her not to seclude herself].&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. But the meaning thereof is that she had committed adultery while she was a married person, but in the case of a <italic>sotah</italic> who had merely been secluded and it is not known whether she was defiled &#x2014; he [her husband] does not transgress this prohibition [if he continues to live with her]. It is so clearly explained in the first chapter of Tractate Yebamoth:<sup><xref rid="fn2067">335</xref></sup> &#x201C;What is the meaning of <italic>v&#x2019;nisterah</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn2068">336</xref></sup> She committed adultery. And why does Scripture refer to it as <italic>v&#x2019;nisterah</italic> [which means, &#x2018;but she was secluded&#x2019;]? It is a more seemly expression.&#x201D; On this answer the Gemara asked: &#x201C;If she committed adultery &#x2014; that [aspect] is clearly stated, <italic>and she hid and she be defiled</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2068">336</xref></sup> [and therefore <italic>v&#x2019;nisterah</italic> in the verse before us must have another meaning]&#x0021; It is to declare that the husband [whose wife committed adultery and, as a result was divorced] transgresses a negative commandment [if he remarries her].&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2069">337</xref></sup> And if so, Scripture states here: &#x201C;<italic>Her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife</italic> &#x2018;and&#x2019; <italic>after that she is defiled</italic> [he may also not take her again].&#x201D; Thus, these are two negative commandment: he warns against remarrying his own divorcee after she had married [someone else and was divorced or widowed], and he warns against remarrying his [former] wife who had been defiled by adultery [and divorced]. And in line with the plain meaning of Scripture the expression <italic>after that she is defiled</italic> refers to the first husband, the verse suggesting that because she &#x201C;knew&#x201D; [i.e., married] another man she is accounted to him [i.e., the first husband] as &#x201C;defiled.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now these are newly-declared commandments both with respect to divorce and remarriage. And the reason for this prohibition is so that people should not exchange their wives with one another: he would be able to write her a bill of divorce at night, and in the morning she will return to him. This is the sense of the expression, <italic>and thou shalt not cause the Land to sin</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2070">338</xref></sup> for this is a cause of great sins. And in the Sifre it is stated:<sup><xref rid="fn2071">339</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And thou shalt not cause the Land to sin</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2070">338</xref></sup> &#x2014; this is intended to admonish the court concerning this.&#x201D;</p>
<p>5. [WHEN A MAN TAKETH A NEW WIFE, HE SHALL NOT GO OUT IN THE HOST] NEITHER SHALL HE BE CHARGED &#x2018;ALAV L&#x2019;CHOL DAVAR&#x2019; (FOR IT WITH ANY THING). &#x201C;<italic>Davar</italic> (thing) refers to &#x2018;the host&#x2019; [i.e., military service]. <italic>L&#x2019;chol davar</italic> means &#x2018;any thing that is a requirement of the army.&#x2019; [Thus he is not] to provide water and food, nor repair the roads. But those who return from the ranks of the army at the bidding of the priest, such as one who built a new house and had not yet dedicated it, or who betrothed a woman and did not take her yet to wife &#x2014; they are bound to supply water and food and repair the roads.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language taken from the words of our Rabbis.<sup><xref rid="fn2072">340</xref></sup> And if so, the word <italic>alav</italic> [<italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;lo ya&#x2019;avor alav&#x2019;</italic> &#x2014; <italic>neither shall he be charged &#x2018;for it&#x2019;</italic>] refers to the aforementioned &#x201C;host.&#x201D; The verse is thus stating that this man [in the first year of his marriage] shall not be charged with going to the host; nor shall he be charged <italic>with any thing</italic>, neither to be a captain of the men of the host, nor to muster the people of the land for whatever is needed, such as the provision of water. He is to pay no attention to these matters but only to his rejoicing. This is a correct interpretation.</p>
<p>8. TAKE HEED IN THE PLAGUE OF LEPROSY. This is an explanatory commandment, adding a prohibition against one who cuts out the leprous spot, and also one who avoids showing his plague to the priest. Now, concerning the law of the plagues themselves, he mentioned nothing here, except to state <italic>and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you, as I commanded them</italic>, because the priests are scrupulous, and whatever He commanded is sufficient for them, as I have already explained.<sup><xref rid="fn2073">341</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. REMEMBER WHAT THE ETERNAL THY G-D DID UNTO MIRIAM. &#x201C;If you wish to guard yourself against being stricken with leprosy, do not speak slander.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. And in my opinion this actually is a positive commandment, like <italic>Remember the Sabbath-day, to keep it holy;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2074">342</xref></sup> <italic>Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2075">343</xref></sup> <italic>Remember what Amalek did unto thee</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2076">344</xref></sup> &#x2014; which are all commandments. If so, this verse, too, is like those, it being an admonition against speaking slander. He commanded by way of a positive precept that we remember the great punishment which G-d inflicted upon the righteous prophetess who spoke only about her brother upon whom she had bestowed her mercy<sup><xref rid="fn2077">345</xref></sup> and whom she loved as herself. And she spoke nothing wrong to his face, but only, in privacy, between herself and her holy brother [Aaron]. Yet all her good deeds were of no avail to her&#x0021; You, too, if <italic>thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother&#x2019;s son</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2078">346</xref></sup> you will not be saved&#x0021;</p>
<p>In the language of the Sifra:<sup><xref rid="fn2079">347</xref></sup> &#x201C;When Scripture states, <italic>and ye will not do all these commandments</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2080">348</xref></sup> this refers to everything written in the Torah. If so, why does it say, <italic>And if ye will not hearken unto Me?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2080">348</xref></sup> It means to study the Torah laboriously. Similarly, He states <italic>Remember the Sabbath-day, to keep it holy</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2074">342</xref></sup> I might think that this means &#x2018;in your heart.&#x2019; But <italic>Observe the Sabbath-day</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2081">349</xref></sup> refers already to observance of the heart. How then can I fulfill the command <italic>Remember</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2074">342</xref></sup> [if that also refers to the heart? I must conclude that <italic>Remember</italic> means] &#x2018;verbal utterance.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn2082">350</xref></sup> Similarly, it is said <italic>Remember, forget thou not</italic>, [<italic>how thou didst make the Eternal thy G-d wroth in the wilderness</italic>] etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2083">351</xref></sup> And so it is also said, <italic>Remember what the Eternal thy G-d did unto Miriam</italic>. I might think that this means &#x2018;in your heart.&#x2019; But <italic>Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2084">352</xref></sup> refers already to forgetfulness of heart. How then can I fulfill the injunction <italic>Remember</italic> [if that also refers to the heart? I must conclude that it means] &#x2018;verbal utterance.&#x2019; And so also he states, <italic>Remember what Amalek did unto thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2076">344</xref></sup> I might think that it means &#x2018;in your heart.&#x2019; But <italic>thou shalt not forget</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2085">353</xref></sup> refers already to forgetfulness of the heart. How then can I obey the injunction <italic>Remember</italic>? &#x2018;By verbal utterance.&#x2019; &#x201D; The meaning thereof is as follows: To the Sages the verse <italic>Take heed &#x2018;in&#x2019; the plague of leprosy</italic> means, &#x201C;<italic>Beware &#x2018;from&#x2019; the plague of leprosy, observing diligently</italic> that it should not come upon you, <italic>and do</italic> therein <italic>according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you</italic>, &#x201D; and <italic>Remember what the Eternal thy G-d did unto Miriam</italic>, meaning that you mention it always in the utterance of words. It appears from here [i.e., from this Sifra] our Rabbis considered this a commandment, not as a narrative and advice on how to be saved from plagues [as Rashi had explained it]. And how is it possible that, concerning slander which is as weighty as bloodshed,<sup><xref rid="fn2086">354</xref></sup> there should not be a real negative commandment against it in the Torah, or at least a negative commandment derived from a positive commandment&#x0021; But this verse contains a great admonition to refrain from it both in public and in private, whether with intent to hurt and to shame or with no intent to harm at all. And this commandment is of the <italic>Taryag</italic> (613) Commandments which the author of the &#x201C;Hilchoth Gedoloth&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2087">355</xref></sup> and all those who counted the commandments have forgotten to include.<sup><xref rid="fn2088">356</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. AND IF HE BE A POOR MAN, [THOU SHALT NOT SLEEP WITH HIS PLEDGE]. The term &#x201C;poor&#x201D; applies to him who has no alternative pledge similar to the item he gave him [the creditor]. If he had two utensils of the same kind [and both are required as security for the debt], he [the creditor] may take one and give [the other] one back [to the debtor] whether he is poor or rich with many properties [for, since the debtor has but two utensils and he is in need of one of them the creditor must return it to him].</p>
<p>14. THOU SHALT NOT WRONG A HIRED SERVANT THAT IS POOR AND NEEDY. Scripture is speaking of the common occurrence, for the poor, the needy, and strangers hire themselves out [for wages, but the law applies to all workers]. Similarly, <italic>If thou lend money to any of My people that is poor by thee</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2089">357</xref></sup> and so also, <italic>it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2090">358</xref></sup> because they are generally poor. Likewise in many places Scripture speaks of common occurrence, such as, <italic>Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2091">359</xref></sup> [which applies equally to all domestic and wild animals as well as birds]; <italic>Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2092">360</xref></sup> [which also applies to any two different species]. And in the Sifre the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn2093">361</xref></sup> &#x201C;If so, why is it stated here <italic>poor and needy</italic> [when the law applies to all workers]? It is because I hasten to punish when the poor and needy are involved more than any other people.&#x201D; They also interpreted: &#x201C;<italic>Whether he be of thy strangers</italic> [in Verse 14 before us] &#x2014; this refers to a righteous proselyte, so that he who wrongs him [in his hire] transgresses two prohibitions&#x201D; [since he is also <italic>of thy brethren</italic>].</p>
<p>15. IN THE SAME DAY THOU SHALT GIVE HIM HIS HIRE, NEITHER SHALT THE SUN GO DOWN UPON IT. The meaning thereof by way of the plain sense of Scripture is that this explains what is stated in the Torah, <italic>the wages of a hired servant shall not abide with thee all night until the morning</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2094">362</xref></sup> for it is the manner of verses to speak of the common occurrence, and the custom is to hire a laborer for one day and for him to leave toward evening before sunset. And so Scripture commands [the employer] to pay him during his day as soon as he finishes his work, and that the sun should not set upon him [before he is paid], in order that he should be able to purchase with his wages what he, his wife, and his children, need to eat at night, for he is poor as are most of those who hire themselves out for the day, he has staked his life upon this wage to buy with it food to sustain his life. Thus he teaches us here that the intent of what He said in the Torah, <italic>the wages of a hired servant shall not abide with thee all night until the morning</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2094">362</xref></sup> is that you pay him during his day, for if you do not pay him when he leaves his work, he will go home and his wage will be left with you until morning and he may die of hunger at night. In a similar way is the verse, <italic>for that is his only covering, it is his garment for his skin; wherein shall he sleep?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2095">363</xref></sup> It states the reason for the commandment in most of these prohibitions. And our Rabbis have explained<sup><xref rid="fn2096">364</xref></sup> that the verse [<italic>the wages of a hired servant shall not abide with thee all night</italic>] <italic>until the morning</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2094">362</xref></sup> applies to a day-worker [who departs from work at sundown; the time for paying him his wages is the entire night, and this law is not violated before daybreak]. Then he reverted to explain here the law of a man who is hired for night-work [whose departure from work is at daybreak and the time for paying his wages is the whole day and the law is not violated until sundown]. Thus for each one, there is a twelve hour deadline for payment. This is the truth as received by tradition and is appropriate with correct interpretation.</p>
<p>18. AND THOU SHALT REMEMBER THAT THOU WAST A BONDMAN IN EGYPT. &#x201C;I have redeemed you on the condition that you observe My statutes even though it may involve monetary loss.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. But the correct interpretation is that it refers back to the admonitions concerning the stranger. I have already explained the meaning thereof.<sup><xref rid="fn2097">365</xref></sup></p>
<h1>25</h1>
<p>1. IF THERE BE A QUARREL BETWEEN MEN. According to the tradition of our Rabbis that stripes are administered to those who are guilty of having violated negative commandments<sup><xref rid="fn2098">366</xref></sup> [and not in civil cases, the question arises] what is its [the stripes&#x2019;] connection with a quarrel between two people? He who eats <italic>n&#x2019;veilah</italic> (carrion) in his home is liable to stripes&#x0021; So also he who sows his field or his vineyard with diverse seeds, or he who cohabits with any of the women forbidden by a plain prohibitive law [i.e., one not involving the court-imposed death-penalty], and all the rest of the negative commandments [are all typical of the transgressions punishable by stripes. All involve negative commandments, not civil suits as is the case in the verse before us.] Additionally, what is the meaning of the phrase <italic>and they shall justify the righteous</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2099">367</xref></sup> [since a civil case does not involve questions of wickedness and righteousness]? Therefore, the Rabbis have interpreted<sup><xref rid="fn2100">368</xref></sup> the verse as referring to plotting witnesses. Scripture says: &#x201C;In case, <italic>If there be a quarrel between</italic> two <italic>men, and they come high unto judgment and they will judge them</italic> through the testimony of two witnesses, as we have been commanded.<sup><xref rid="fn2101">369</xref></sup> [Afterwards, two <italic>other</italic> witnesses came to court and testified that the first pair of witnesses were elsewhere at the time when the event they testified about allegedly took place. Thus the person found guilty as a result of the original testimony is shown to be &#x2018;righteous&#x2019; while the plotting witnesses have been proven &#x2018;wicked.&#x2019;] Then the judges <italic>will justify the righteous</italic> [through the <italic>second</italic> pair of witnesses] <italic>and condemn the wicked</italic> contrary to the first judgment; <italic>then it shall be if the wicked man</italic> [i.e., the first pair of witnesses] <italic>deserve to be beaten</italic>. &#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2102">370</xref></sup> This applies to where the command <italic>and ye shall do unto him, as he had purposed to do unto his brother</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2103">371</xref></sup> cannot be carried out upon them &#x2014; such being the case if they testified [against a priest] that he is the son of a divorced woman [and therefore not qualified to be a ministering priest in the Sanctuary], or that he is a slave or a bastard [who is prohibited from the priesthood or from marriage to a Jew], or if they testified against someone that he transgressed one of the negative commandments [which are punishable by stripes] &#x2014; in all these cases they [the plotting witnesses] are punishable by stripes.</p>
<p>It is possible that there be a quarrel between men resulting in stripes &#x2014; such as where someone assaulted his fellow [causing a damage of] less than a <italic>perutah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2104">372</xref></sup> or that he cursed his fellow with the Name of G-d,<sup><xref rid="fn2105">373</xref></sup> or that someone exacted a utensil necessary for the preparation of food as security for a loan, and similar cases. Scripture speaks of the common occurrence that the party to a dispute [with his fellow] will bring him to court and he will be punished with stripes because of him.</p>
<p>Now, the reason for the forty stripes, according to the Midrash,<sup><xref rid="fn2106">374</xref></sup> is because he transgressed against the Torah which was given in forty days and he caused death upon himself who was formed in the forty days following conception; let him, therefore, be given forty stripes, and be freed of his punishment [of death].</p>
<p>I have already mentioned the subject of levirate marriage and the secret thereof, as well as of <italic>Chalitzah</italic> (the loosening of the shoe) and its reason.<sup><xref rid="fn2107">375</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND IT SHALL BE THAT THE FIRSTBORN THAT SHE BEARETH SHALL SUCCEED IN THE NAME OF HIS BROTHER THAT IS DEAD. It [the true purport thereof] is not the simple meaning that they call the first son by the name of the dead, Reuben or Shimon as his name was, for in the case of Boaz it says thus, <italic>that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2108">376</xref></sup> and yet they did not call the child born [to Boaz and Ruth] Machlon. But this verse by way of the Truth, [the mystic teaching of the Cabala], is an assurance<sup><xref rid="fn2109">377</xref></sup> and thus it is to be understood in its simple sense. And our Rabbis found support in this verse for the following laws:<sup><xref rid="fn2110">378</xref></sup> that the eldest [surviving] brother contracts the levirate marriage, that a sterile woman may not be contracted for such marriage, nor the wife of a eunuch since his name was &#x201C;blotted out&#x201D; [when he was yet alive]. Now, all these are but Scriptural supports [for laws of levirate marriage], because the laws of the sterile widow and the widow of the eunuch are derived from the very essence of the Scriptural section [and are not derived from the Scriptural supports quoted].<sup><xref rid="fn2111">379</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. REMEMBER WHAT AMALEK DID UNTO THEE. I have already mentioned the Midrash which the Rabbis interpreted in the Sifra:<sup><xref rid="fn2112">380</xref></sup> &#x201C;I might think that it means, &#x2018;in your heart.&#x2019; But when Scripture states, <italic>thou shalt not forget</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2085">353</xref></sup> forgetfulness of heart is already stated. How then can I fulfill the injunction <italic>Remember?</italic> It must mean &#x2018;by verbal utterance.&#x2019; &#x201D; It is also stated in the Sifre,<sup><xref rid="fn2113">381</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Remember what Amalek did unto thee</italic> means verbal [remembrance]. <italic>Thou shalt not forget</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2085">353</xref></sup> means [remembrance] in the heart.&#x201D;</p>
<p>But I know not what is this remembrance through the spoken word. If it is to say that we are to read the section of Amalek in public, then we might deduce therefrom that the duty of reading on the second [Sabbath in the month of Adar the section] <italic>Remember what Amalek did unto thee</italic> is by law of the Torah&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn2114">382</xref></sup> So also we shall have in that case a Scriptural support for the reading of the Scroll [of Esther on Purim]&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn2115">383</xref></sup> The correct interpretation appears to me that the verse states that you are not to forget what Amalek did to us until we blot out his remembrance from under the heavens, and that we are to relate it to our children and to our generations, saying to them, &#x201C;Thus did the wicked one do to us and therefore we have been commanded to blot out his name.&#x201D; Similarly, in the affair of Miriam, we were commanded<sup><xref rid="fn2116">384</xref></sup> to make it known to our children and relate it to the generations. And although it would have been appropriate to conceal it in order not to speak of the shortcomings of the righteous,<sup><xref rid="fn2117">385</xref></sup> yet Scripture commanded that it be made known and revealed so that the admonition against slander be <italic>put in their mouths</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2118">386</xref></sup> because it is a great sin and causes many evils, and people are in the habit of stumbling therein, just as the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn2119">387</xref></sup> &#x201C;All people are [suspect] of a shade of slander.&#x201D;</p>

When he asked G-d the reason for it, he was told that it was in punishment of Saul&#x2019;s mistreatment of the Gibeonites. (See Note 116 for the nature of Saul&#x2019;s sin.) When David asked the Gibeonites how they could be appeased, they requested that they be given seven men of Saul&#x2019;s family whom they would hang. As much as the king tried to mollify them, they insisted upon satisfying their lust for vengeance upon members of Saul&#x2019;s family. When David acceded to their wishes, they left the victims hanging for a long period of time until the rains came. &#x2014; The question here arises as to why David allowed the victims to be left hanging when the Torah states, <italic>his body shall not remain all night upon the tree</italic>? The answer follows in the text. &#x2014; It should also be pointed out that because of their display of cruelty the Gibeonites were forever banned from marrying into Israel (Yebamoth 79a).</ftnote>

When Saul smote Nob, the city of the priests (I Samuel 22:19) the Gibeonites were thus deprived of their source of livelihood. It was this grudge that they held against Saul and his family. When they finally satisfied their vengeful feelings against the members of Saul&#x2019;s family, all the heathens proclaimed &#x201C;There is no nation as worthy of our allegiance as Israel&#x0021; See how the G-d of Israel atoned for a wrong inflicted upon wretched proselytes through the sons of kings&#x0021;&#x201D; At that time, one hundred and fifty thousand heathens were converted to Judaism, because it was shown that G-d loves proselytes (Yebamoth 79a).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1870">(138) For &#x2014; in defense of Rambam&#x2019;s explanation &#x2014; we would be forced to add that the primary prohibition is against killing first the young and then the dam; the prohibition against first killing the dam and then the young is but a precautionary measure lest one may accidentally reverse the order. While we might contend this in defense of Rambam&#x2019;s theory, Ramban concludes, &#x201C;and it is more correct etc.&#x201D; This explanation would seem to be more logical because it does not differentiate between the order of taking or slaughtering the dam and its young. Hence Ramban&#x2019;s language. The full significance of this theory of Ramban will be made clearer further on in the text.</ftnote>

This text of Bereshith Rabbah implies that some commandments have no other reason than the fact that they were so willed by G-d, which contradicts Rambam&#x2019;s main thesis that there are reasons for <italic>all</italic> commandments. Rambam proceeds (&#x201C;Guide of the Perplexed,&#x201D; III, 26) to explain this text, in harmony with his theory. In the lengthy discussion to follow, Ramban will strongly agree with Rambam&#x2019;s main theory that there is a reason for every commandment.

<ftnote id="fn1900">(168) The Rabbis of the Gemara made the following remark with reference to the Mishnah quoted above (see text at Note 139): &#x201C;He who says in his prayer: &#x2018;Even to a bird&#x2019;s nest do Thy mercies extend&#x2019; etc., they silence him.&#x201D; The reason for this law as stated in the Mishnah is now explained by the Rabbis of the Gemara: &#x201C;Because he [the supplicant] treats etc.&#x201D; (see text). &#x2014; Berachoth 33b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1901">(169) &#x201C;To inform them that they are His servants, and that they keep His commandments, decrees and statutes, even such matters concerning which Satan and the nations of the world taunt Israel saying, &#x2018;What need is there for this commandment?&#x2019; &#x201D; (Rashi <italic>ibid</italic>). Now, this text of the Mishnah and Gemara was explained above by Rambam as exemplifying the opinion that there is no reason for fulfillment of the commandments of the Torah other than the Will of the Creator, while we follow the second opinion that there is a reason for every commandment. Ramban will now proceed to explain this text, in accordance with the accepted opinion that there <italic>is</italic> a reason for every commandment, thus making this text to be the consensus of all Sages.</ftnote>

See also &#x201C;The Commandments,&#x201D; Vol. I, p. 39, Note 2 with respect to such &#x201C;camps&#x201D; in the city of Jerusalem. An army with the ark of G-d in its midst has the status of &#x201C;a Sanctuary of G-d&#x201D; as Ramban expressed it above.

<ftnote id="fn2023">(291) In other words, the Sifre is stating that both admonitions were necessary.

<ftnote id="fn2046">(314) In other words there is no need to admonish people against needlessly diminishing their fortunes through improvident gifts. But the paying of interest to a creditor is a common practice; therefore the Torah specified that the prohibition extends even to the borrower.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2057">(325) Thus one who lends money to an Israelite on interest violates both an explicit negative commandment that is inferred from a positive Scriptural statement, which has the same force as the positive commandment from which it is derived. This excludes the interpretation that there is a positive commandment that we are to lend a foreigner upon interest.</ftnote>

And even if they were priests the punishment cannot be inflicted because their intent was to disqualify not only the priest himself <italic>but his offspring</italic> as well, but Scripture implicitly excludes the offspring from liability [for it says, <italic>and ye shall do unto him</italic>, but not to his offspring] <italic>as he had &#x2018;purposed to do unto his brother</italic>.&#x2019; Therefore the witnesses are scourged for their false testimony (Makkoth 2 a-b).</ftnote>

Similarly the widow of the eunuch may not be contracted for such a marriage since his name was already &#x201C;blotted out&#x201D; when yet alive and no special verse is necessary to exclude his widow from such a marriage.

<chapter>
<title>Ki Thavo</title>
<h1>26</h1>
<p>2. THEN THOU SHALT TAKE OF THE FIRST OF ALL THE FRUIT OF THE GROUND, WHICH THOU SHALT BRING IN FROM THY LAND. [The meaning thereof is] that you shall take of the first of all the fruit which you will bring into the house from your Land, which the Eternal your G-d gives you. He commands that one should set aside that fruit in the field and designate it as first-fruit and then bring it into his house and put it in a vessel fit to be taken to the Sanctuary [in Jerusalem].<sup><xref rid="fn2120">1</xref></sup> Now, Scripture did not prescribe an amount for the first-fruits, instead, even one grain [or berry] of that species exempts the entire field, similar to the law of <italic>terumah</italic> (the heave-offering) where one grain exempts the whole pile of grain.<sup><xref rid="fn2121">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THOU SHALT GO UNTO THE PLACE WHICH THE ETERNAL THY G-D SHALL CHOOSE. In line with the plain meaning of Scripture he admonishes against bringing first-fruit in [any] one of the cities [except for Jerusalem] after the Sanctuary was chosen [i.e., after Jerusalem was designated by the prophets and the ark of G-d was brought there], for just as He warned against slaughtering offerings outside [of the Sanctuary Court], so he warned with reference to the first-fruits. But the obligation of bringing first-fruits became binding immediately after they conquered and divided the Land,<sup><xref rid="fn2122">3</xref></sup> in accordance with the words of Rashi.<sup><xref rid="fn2123">4</xref></sup> And in the Sifre it is stated:<sup><xref rid="fn2124">5</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And thou shalt go unto the place which the Eternal thy G-d shall choose to cause His Name to dwell there</italic> &#x2014; this refers to Shiloh and &#x2018;the Eternal House&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn2125">6</xref></sup> [in Jerusalem].&#x201D; Perhaps the Rabbis [in the Sifre] meant to say that the <italic>bamoth</italic> (&#x201C;high places&#x201D;) were forbidden during both periods [i.e., Shiloh and Jerusalem]. However, during [the periods of] Nob and Gibeon [when high places were permitted] first-fruits could also be brought [only there in Nob and Gibeon], but they could not be offered at a private <italic>bamah</italic>, for Scripture refers [here in the chapter on first-fruits] to <italic>the altar</italic> [<italic>and he shall set it down before &#x2018;the altar&#x2019; of the Eternal thy G-d</italic> indicating that only the public altar is suitable for first-fruits].<sup><xref rid="fn2126">7</xref></sup> But since it is written, <italic>The choisest first-fruit of thy Land thou shalt bring into the House of the Eternal thy G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2127">8</xref></sup> they perhaps did not bring first-fruits when it [the House of G-d] was <italic>in a tent and in a tabernacle</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2128">9</xref></sup> but only in Shiloh where there was a stone building and in the Eternal House,<sup><xref rid="fn2125">6</xref></sup> [thus excluding the period of Nob and Gibeon].</p>
<p>3. AND THOU SHALT COME UNTO THE PRIEST THAT SHALL BE IN THOSE DAYS &#x2014; to the priest that shall be there in those days, for first-fruits, like all offerings, are given to the men of the [priestly] Division [who are assigned to the Sanctuary for a week at a time],<sup><xref rid="fn2129">10</xref></sup> but he may not bring along a priest from his city in order to offer him his first-fruits.</p>
<p>Now, Rashi wrote: &#x201C;You have none else than the priest who lives in your days as he is.&#x201D; But I have not understood this, for in the case of an elder [of the Sanhedrin] it is proper to say [<italic>and thou shalt come &#x2026;</italic>] <italic>unto the judge that shall be in those days</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2130">11</xref></sup> meaning that even though he is not as great and wise as the early judges <italic>in the ages which were before us</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2131">12</xref></sup> still he [the elder] is obligated to hearken to him [the judge], for &#x201C;Jephtah in his generation is as Samuel in his generation.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2132">13</xref></sup> But when bringing first-fruits, to whom shall he bring them if not to the priest that shall be in his days? Now, I have also seen the following text in the Sifre:<sup><xref rid="fn2124">5</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And thou shalt come unto the priest that shall be in those days</italic>. This is what Rabbi Yosei the Galilean says, And would it occur to you to come to the priest that is not in your days? Rather, [I must say that the verse requires one to come to] the priest who is considered by you to be established and fit in those days. Kinsmen who have ceased to be kinsmen are qualified.<sup><xref rid="fn2133">14</xref></sup> And so it is also said, <italic>Say not thou: &#x2018;How was it that the former days were better than these?&#x2019;</italic> &#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2134">15</xref></sup> It appears that the Sages interpreted in this connection that if one brought first-fruits or a burnt-offering to a priest who was presumed to be qualified and afterwards it was discovered that he was the son of a divorced woman, [a defiled priest not entitled to perform the Divine Service, nor to receive the priestly gifts] the offerings are nevertheless valid, as is mentioned in the last chapter<sup><xref rid="fn2135">16</xref></sup> of Tractate Kiddushin. Also included in this principle is [the rule] that a kinsman who has ceased to be a kinsman is qualified, this applying to an elder who may not be judged by a relative,<sup><xref rid="fn2136">17</xref></sup> but it is not relevant to first-fruits.</p>
<p>&#x2018;HIGAD&#x2019;TI&#x2019; (I PROFESS) THIS DAY. &#x201C;Through this fruit which I have brought I profess and give thanks to the Eternal your G-d Who brought me into the Land which He <italic>swore unto our fathers to give us</italic>. Thus G-d fulfilled His words, and I give thanks and praise to His Name.&#x201D; The meaning of the word <italic>higad&#x2019;ti</italic> is like &#x201C;I have told.&#x201D; So also <italic>&#x2018;vayageid Mosheh&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and Moses told</italic>) <italic>the words of the people unto the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2137">18</xref></sup> which means communicating. Or the interpretation thereof may be as follows: &#x201C;<italic>I declare to you</italic>, O priest, and to all who stand by, and this declaration is <italic>unto the Eternal thy G-d</italic>, that is to say, to His Name, <italic>that I am come into the Land which</italic> He <italic>swore unto our fathers</italic>, for it is He Who brought me [near] to Him to serve Him in the Land.&#x201D;</p>
<p>14. I HAVE NOT EATEN THEREOF IN MY MOURNING. Even though the avowal<sup><xref rid="fn2138">19</xref></sup> included all tithes, as the Rabbis interpreted:<sup><xref rid="fn2139">20</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>I have also given it unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2140">21</xref></sup> etc.,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2141">22</xref></sup> &#x2014; the statement <italic>I have not eaten thereof in my mourning</italic> refers only to <italic>the hallowed things</italic> [mentioned at the beginning of the preceding Verse 13: <italic>I have put away &#x2018;the hallowed things&#x2019; out of my house</italic>] which refers to the Second Tithe and fourth-year&#x2019;s plantings which may not be eaten in mourning and in a state of impurity.<sup><xref rid="fn2142">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>NOR HAVE I GIVEN THEREOF FOR THE DEAD &#x2014; &#x201C;to prepare a coffin and shrouds for it.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. But I have not understood this, for Scripture explicitly states that we are not to exchange the fruits of the Second Tithe outside Jerusalem except for coined silver.<sup><xref rid="fn2143">24</xref></sup> In Jerusalem we are to spend the money on edible things, <italic>for any of the herd, or any of the flock, or for wine, or for strong drink</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2144">25</xref></sup> and eat them before the Eternal. [It is, therefore, clear that it is forbidden to use the money to purchase a garment even for the living &#x2014; hence it is pointless to make such an avowal with respect to the dead&#x0021;]</p>
<p>Now, Harav Rabbi Moshe [ben Maimon] wrote in his work<sup><xref rid="fn2145">26</xref></sup> &#x201C;The Second Tithe is designated for use as food and drink, for it is said, <italic>and thou shalt eat there before the Eternal thy G-d</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2144">25</xref></sup> Anointing is like drinking. It is forbidden to spend it on his remaining necessities, such as buying vessels, clothes and servants, for it is said, <italic>nor have I given thereof for the dead</italic>, that is to say, I have not spent it on anything which does not sustain the body.&#x201D; [Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon] thus interpreted the phrase <italic>for the dead</italic> here as being an expression for any thing through which a person does not live. But these are words of mere exaggeration.<sup><xref rid="fn2146">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other scholars<sup><xref rid="fn2147">28</xref></sup> have explained that the avowal is that he did not spend therefrom for a coffin and shrouds even for the dead &#x2014; which [spending] is a religious duty &#x2014; and certainly not for the living for a cloak or shirt. And in the Sifre it is stated:<sup><xref rid="fn2148">29</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Nor have I given thereof for the dead</italic> &#x2014; to prepare a coffin and shrouds for it. These are the words of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Akiba said to him: If it is forbidden for the dead, it is likewise forbidden for the living. Why then is it stated <italic>nor have I given thereof</italic> [<italic>&#x2018;for the dead&#x2019;</italic>]? It means that I have not exchanged the Second Tithe even for something which is clean.&#x201D; Thus Rabbi Akiba interprets the expression <italic>neither have I given thereof</italic>, as meaning that &#x201C;I have not even used it in exchange for clean, edible things.&#x201D; This is similar to what we have been taught in a Mishnah:<sup><xref rid="fn2149">30</xref></sup> &#x201C;Second Tithes may not be sold or bartered. Nor may a man say to his fellow in Jerusalem, &#x2018;Here is wine, and give me oil [in exchange].&#x2019; &#x201D; In the opinion of Rabbi Akiba, the expression <italic>for the dead</italic> is thus connected with the above statement, &#x2018;<italic>I have not eaten thereof in my mourning &#x2014; for the dead</italic>,&#x2019; for the term &#x201C;mourning&#x201D; applies only to the dead. [And the expression <italic>nor have I given thereof</italic> thus stands as a complete independent statement, meaning &#x201C;I have not sold it or bartered it even for clean food fit to be eaten.&#x201D;]</p>
<p>Now, I have seen the following text in the Yerushalmi:<sup><xref rid="fn2150">31</xref></sup> &#x201C;Rabbi Eliezer said in the name of Rabbi Simaie: <italic>Nor have I given thereof for the dead</italic>. How are we to interpret this? Shall we say that it forbids the bringing of a coffin and shrouds for the corpse &#x2014; if something like this for the living [e.g., a cloak or shirt] is forbidden, need we be told that something which is prohibited for the living may not be done for the dead? What then is there that is permissible for the living [with the Second Tithe] and is forbidden for the dead? It is anointing.&#x201D; But I do not understand this text either, for if he anointed a corpse with the oil of the Second Tithe, he has consumed it in impurity, and he has already confessed that, <italic>neither have I consumed any thereof unclean&#x0021;</italic> And in the Gemara of Tractate Yebamoth, Chapter <italic>He&#x2019;arel</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2151">32</xref></sup> we find: &#x201C;Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said in the name of Rabbi Simaie, Whence do we know that, if the oil of Second Tithe was rendered impure, we may use it for anointing?<sup><xref rid="fn2152">33</xref></sup> Because it is stated, <italic>nor have I given thereof for the dead</italic> &#x2014; &#x2018;I have not given it for the dead,&#x2019; but for the living akin to the dead I may give it. What use is there for the living and the dead alike? I must say this is anointing.&#x201D; [The verse thus teaches us that if the oil of the Second Tithe has been rendered impure, it may still be used to anoint the living.] There [the Sages of the Gemara] have asked, &#x201C;Perhaps I should say that this verse is an avowal that he did not buy a coffin and shrouds [for the dead],&#x201D; meaning it would be permissible for a living [person] to buy himself a shirt if the Second Tithe was rendered impure, because then, [since it may not be eaten] we cannot apply the verse, <italic>and thou shalt eat there before the Eternal thy G-d</italic>&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn2153">34</xref></sup> To this the Rabbis replied, &#x201C;The verse states <italic>thereof</italic> [<italic>nor have I given &#x2018;thereof&#x2019; for the dead</italic>] &#x2014; from the very oil itself&#x201D; [i.e., I have not used the Second Tithe oil itself to anoint the dead, thus signifying that if that oil becomes impure I may still use it to anoint myself]. It now remains that the avowal, <italic>nor have I given thereof for the dead</italic> is attached to the statement <italic>neither have I consumed any thereof unclean</italic>, the person avowing that he did not eat from it in impurity, and did not use the impure [oil of the Second Tithe] for a corpse, to anoint it. However, in a Mishnah we have been taught in accordance with the words of Rabbi Eliezer [mentioned above in the Sifre<sup><xref rid="fn2148">29</xref></sup> that <italic>nor have I given thereof for the dead</italic> means to prepare a coffin and shrouds for a corpse]:<sup><xref rid="fn2154">35</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Nor have I given thereof for the dead</italic> &#x2014; I have not bought a coffin and shrouds for the dead with it, nor have I given it to other mourners.&#x201D; This interpretation which the Rabbis [here in the Mishnah] deduced, that he did not give it for the dead &#x2014; neither for the corpse itself such as for a coffin and shrouds, nor for his mourners [to eat while in mourning] &#x2014; includes his own mourning as well as that of others. And because of the mourning of others, he avows already about the coffin and shrouds, although such uses [as buying a cloak or shirt] are forbidden even for the living.</p>
<p>15. WHICH THOU HAST GIVEN US, AS THOU DIDST SWEAR UNTO OUR FATHERS &#x2014; &#x201C;to give it<sup><xref rid="fn2155">36</xref></sup> to us and Thou hast fulfilled [Thy promise by] giving us A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. If so, the order of the verse is [to be inverted as follows]: &#x201C;and the Land which Thou hast given us, a Land flowing with milk and honey, as Thou didst swear unto our father.&#x201D; And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented that the meaning thereof is, may it always be so, that is to say, &#x201C;and bless the Land which You have given us to be [always] a Land flowing with milk and honey.&#x201D; But there is no need for all this, for included in the term &#x201C;speaking&#x201D; or &#x201C;swearing&#x201D; is the act of &#x201C;giving.&#x201D; Thus a man may say to his fellow, &#x201C;You have sworn me your field&#x201D; [which means: &#x201C;you have sworn to give me your field&#x201D;], or &#x201C;You have told me a hundred&#x201D; [which means &#x201C;you have sworn to give me a hundred dinars&#x201D;]. Similarly, <italic>as the Eternal, the G-d of thy fathers, hath spoken unto thee &#x2014; a Land flowing with milk and honey</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2156">37</xref></sup> [the term &#x201C;hath spoken&#x201D; means &#x201C;hath spoken that He would give thee&#x201D;]. We have already explained it [there].<sup><xref rid="fn2156">37</xref></sup> So also, <italic>and he gave him a house, and food he told him, and gave him land</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2157">38</xref></sup> [which means &#x201C;and food he promised to give him&#x201D;]. Now, do not find it difficult here that in the oaths made to the patriarchs &#x201C;a Land flowing with milk and honey&#x201D; is not mentioned. Since at that time the Land was a Land flowing with milk and honey, [it would have been redundant to describe it explicitly. Therefore it was as if] He swore to them by a Land flowing with milk and honey. Or it may be that <italic>unto our fathers</italic> [here does not mean the patriarchs] but those who came forth from Egypt, for it was to them that it was said, <italic>unto a Land flowing with milk and honey</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2158">39</xref></sup> similar to the expression, <italic>and the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and our fathers</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2159">40</xref></sup> [which refers to &#x201C;our fathers&#x201D; who came forth from Egypt].</p>
<p>16. THIS DAY THE ETERNAL THY G-D COMMANDETH THEE TO DO THESE STATUTES AND ORDINANCES. Now Moses finished explaining the Torah to them and issuing all the new commandments which G-d commanded him to declare to them. Therefore he said, &#x201C;<italic>This day the Eternal thy G-d commandeth thee to do these statutes and ordinances</italic>, for I have already completed everything for you.&#x201D; He mentioned, <italic>and thou shalt observe and do them with all thy heart, and with all thy soul</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2160">41</xref></sup> I have already explained the terms &#x201C;heart&#x201D; and &#x201C;soul.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2161">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. THOU HAST AVOUCHED THE ETERNAL THIS DAY. The meaning thereof is: &#x201C;Since you have accepted the entire Torah upon yourselves with all its interpretations, details, and new promulgations, you have thus magnified G-d and exalted Him, that He alone will be your G-d; you will in no way avow another god.&#x201D;</p>
<p>AND THAT THOU WOULDEST WALK IN HIS WAYS &#x2014; to do the good and the right, and do kindness one to another. <italic>And keep His statutes, and His commandments, and His ordinances</italic>. He [Moses] singles out the statutes and ordinances [for the reason] I have explained,<sup><xref rid="fn2161">42</xref></sup> and he includes in the expression <italic>and His commandments</italic> all the commandments &#x2014; positive and negative. <italic>And hearken unto His voice</italic> &#x2014; this refers to whatever He will command you concerning other deeds through me or through the rest of the prophets, as I have explained.<sup><xref rid="fn2162">43</xref></sup> It is possible that the expression <italic>His commandments</italic> refers to the positive commandments, <italic>and hearken unto His voice</italic> means the avoidances, that is to say, the negative commandments.</p>
<p>18. AND THE ETERNAL HATH AVOUCHED THEE. For this day is to you as the day of [the Revelation on] Sinai, and G-d exalted and magnified you by your acceptance of the Torah in order that you be <italic>His own treasure from among all peoples</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2163">44</xref></sup> <italic>and that thou shouldest keep all His commandments</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2164">45</xref></sup> for, to you alone He gave His Torah and commanded you with all the commandments that are desireable before Him and to no other nation. It is similar to what is written, <italic>He declareth His word unto Jacob, His statutes and His ordinances unto Israel. He hath not dealt so with any nation</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2165">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. AND TO MAKE THEE HIGH ABOVE ALL NATIONS THAT HE HATH MADE, IN PRAISE &#x2014; that all the peoples of the earth should praise you for the fact that G-d will be near whenever you call upon Him.<sup><xref rid="fn2166">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND IN NAME &#x2014; that <italic>thy renown</italic> will <italic>go forth among the nations for</italic> His <italic>splendor which</italic> He <italic>had placed upon thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2167">48</xref></sup> for you are exalted above all.</p>

<p>AND THAT THOU MAYEST BE A HOLY PEOPLE UNTO THE ETERNAL &#x2014; to cleave to Him ultimately.<sup><xref rid="fn2170">51</xref></sup></p>

<h1>27</h1>
<p>1. AND MOSES AND THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL COMMANDED THE PEOPLE, SAYING: KEEP ALL THE COMMANDMENT etc. The meaning thereof is that after Moses completed his words [to the people,] he ordered the elders also to join him and warn the people to keep all the commandments, for every nation follows the advice of its elders. It states <italic>which &#x2018;I&#x2019; command you this day</italic>, not &#x201C;we,&#x201D; for the principal speech was that of Moses, while the elders merely proclaimed, saying to the people, &#x201C;Hear, hearken, and observe.&#x201D; Similarly, <italic>And Moses and the priests, the Levites spoke unto all Israel</italic>, etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2174">55</xref></sup> means that the priests said to the people, <italic>Keep silence, and hear, O Israel</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2174">55</xref></sup> and Moses said, <italic>This day thou art become a people</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2174">55</xref></sup> But Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented that the expression <italic>keep all the commandment</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2175">56</xref></sup> refers to the commandment about the stones which he will mention further on.<sup><xref rid="fn2176">57</xref></sup> But this is not correct [since the verse states <italic>keep &#x2018;all&#x2019; the commandment</italic>, it must refer to the commandments in general and not to one commandment in particular].</p>
<p>3. AND THOU SHALT WRITE UPON THEM ALL THE WORDS OF THIS LAW. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra wrote in the name of the Gaon<sup><xref rid="fn2177">58</xref></sup> that &#x201C;they wrote upon the stones a list of the commandments like those written down in the &#x2018;Hilchoth Gedoloth,&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn2178">59</xref></sup> in the form of <italic>Azharoth</italic> (&#x2018;Exhortations&#x2019; of the liturgical poets). And the meaning of the expression <italic>&#x2018;ba&#x2019;eir heiteiv&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>very plainly</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn2179">60</xref></sup> refers to the writing&#x201D; [i.e., that it be in legible script, but it does not mean &#x201C;well explained,&#x201D; since only a brief list of the commandments rather than a detailed rendering was inscribed upon the stones].</p>
<p>And our Rabbis have said<sup><xref rid="fn2180">61</xref></sup> [that <italic>&#x2018;ba&#x2019;eir heiteiv</italic>&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn2179">60</xref></sup> means] in the seventy languages [of the peoples of the world]. Now, we find in the Book of <italic>Tagin</italic> (crownlets)<sup><xref rid="fn2181">62</xref></sup> that the entire Torah was written on them [i.e., the stones] &#x2014; from the beginning of <italic>Bereshith</italic> to <italic>in the sight of all Israel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2182">63</xref></sup> &#x2014; with its crownlets and its flourishes, and from there all the crownlets in the entire Torah were copied. It is likely that either these stones were huge, or it was a miraculous event [for, otherwise, it would have been impossible to inscribe so much on a few stone tablets].</p>
<p>SO THAT THOU MAYEST GO IN UNTO THE LAND. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented that it means &#x201C;that G-d will help you [to come into the Land] if you begin keeping His commandments, for this was the first commandment [that they were to observe] upon coming into the Land.&#x201D; In my opinion the expression <italic>so that thou mayest go in unto the Land</italic> alludes to all the words of the Torah, the verse stating that you are to write upon the stones <italic>all the words of this Law when thou art passed over</italic> the Jordan immediately <italic>so that thou mayest go</italic> into the Land, for it was for the sake of the Torah that you will have come there. Similarly, <italic>so that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou. And thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2183">64</xref></sup> which means: &#x201C;let your manservant and your maidservant rest like you so that you shall remember that you were servants in the land of Egypt.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2184">65</xref></sup> Or it may be that the meaning of the verse is as follows: &#x201C;you shall write upon the stones <italic>all the words of this Law</italic> to serve you as a remembrance so that you may come into the Land and conquer it and drive out all these peoples, [a conquest that will be yours only] when you will remember the Torah and keep all its commandments.&#x201D;</p>
<p>20. BECAUSE HE HATH UNCOVERED HIS FATHER&#x2019;S SKIRT. This is a respectful euphemism for the father, for in the Torah He mentioned, <italic>he hath uncovered his father&#x2019;s nakedness</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2185">66</xref></sup> So also He mentioned the term &#x201C;their nakedness&#x201D; in the cases of his brother&#x2019;s wife<sup><xref rid="fn2186">67</xref></sup> and his uncle&#x2019;s wife<sup><xref rid="fn2187">68</xref></sup> for there the transgressors are liable to severe punishment, death [by the court, if there were witnesses] or extinction [if there were no witnesses] and Scripture thus needed to condemn the evil they had done; therefore it mentioned &#x201C;nakedness&#x201D; concerning them. But here the transgressor being &#x201C;cursed,&#x201D; it was sufficient to mention <italic>because he hath uncovered his father&#x2019;s skirt</italic>, for he is deserving of an imprecation merely for uncovering his father&#x2019;s skirt, for it disgraces his honor, and anyone who dishonors his father, is cursed.<sup><xref rid="fn2188">69</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>A man shall not take his father&#x2019;s wife, and shall not uncover his father&#x2019;s skirt</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2189">70</xref></sup> is a respectful euphemism meaning that he should not approach her, for it is not proper to uncover the skirt which he spread over a wife by means of a canopy, similar to what is stated, <italic>spread therefore thy skirt over thy handmaid</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2190">71</xref></sup> This excludes the interpretation of him who says<sup><xref rid="fn2191">72</xref></sup> that this verse [<italic>A man shall not take his father&#x2019;s wife</italic>] includes a woman that was violated by him.</p>
<p>26. CURSED BE HE THAT CONFIRMETH NOT THE WORDS OF THIS LAW. &#x201C;Here [in these words] he included the entire Torah and they took it upon themselves with an imprecation and an oath [to observe all the commandments thereof].&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. In my opinion this &#x201C;acceptance&#x201D; requires that one avow the commandments in his heart and consider them as the truth, believe that he who observes them will be requited with the best of rewards and he who transgresses them will be punished, and if someone denies any of them, or considers it annulled forever he will be cursed. However, if one transgressed any commandment, such as eating swine or some abominable thing because of his desire, or he did not make a Booth or take the palm-branch [on the Festival of Tabernacles] because of laziness, he is not included within this ban, for Scripture did not say &#x201C;who does not perform the words of this Law&#x201D; but it states <italic>that &#x2018;confirmeth&#x2019; not the words of this Law to do them</italic>, similar to the expression <italic>the Jews ordained, and took upon them</italic> [<italic>and upon their seed &#x2026; so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days</italic> &#x2014; of Purim &#x2014; <italic>according to the writing thereof</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn2192">73</xref></sup> Thus the verse [before us] is the ban on those who rebel [against the authority of the Torah] and who deny [its validity].</p>
<p>Now, I have seen the following text in Yerushalmi Sotah:<sup><xref rid="fn2193">74</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Asher lo yakim</italic> [literally: &#x2018;that does not stand up&#x2019; &#x2014; <italic>the words of this Law</italic>]. But is there &#x2018;a falling Law?&#x2019; Rabbi Shimon ben Yakim says, This refers to the officer [of the Synagogue, as explained further on]. Rabbi Shimon ben Chalafta says, This is the court on earth, because Rav<sup><xref rid="fn2194">75</xref></sup> Yehudah and Rav Hunah in the name of Shmuel said: Due to this verse [<italic>asher lo yakim</italic> (<italic>that confirmeth not</italic>)] King Josiah rent his clothes,<sup><xref rid="fn2195">76</xref></sup> saying, &#x2018;The duty is upon me to stand up [the Law].&#x2019; Rabbi Asi in the name of Rabbi Tanchum the son of Chiya said, [Even if a person] learned and taught [Torah], observed and fulfilled [its commandments], but had the means to enable [others to study the Torah] and did not do so &#x2014; he is included within the curse&#x201D; [mentioned in the verse before us]. Thus the Rabbis [in the above Yerushalmi] interpretated this &#x201C;standing up&#x201D; [of the Torah] as referring to the royal house and that of the <italic>Nasi</italic> [the Prince of the Sanhedrin] who have the power to uphold [the authority of] the Torah over those who annul it. And even if he was a perfectly righteous man in his own deeds, but he could have strengthened the Torah against the power of the wicked ones who annul it [but failed to do so], he is accursed. This is close to the subject that we have explained.</p>
<p>And by way of a homily the Rabbis [in the above Yerushalmi] said: &#x201C;This refers to the sexton of the Synagogue who does not stand up the Scroll of the Law to set it up properly so that it should not fall.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2196">77</xref></sup> It appears to me that it [the Yerushalmi] refers to the sexton who does not stand up the Scroll of the Law before the public to show the face of its writing to all people as it is explained in Tractate Sofrim<sup><xref rid="fn2197">78</xref></sup> that &#x201C;they lift the Torah high and show the face of its writing to the people who stand there to the right and left thereof and turns it frontwise and backwards, for it is incumbent upon all men and women to see the written words and bend the knee and say <italic>And this is the Law which Moses set before the children of Israel</italic>,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2198">79</xref></sup> and such is the custom.</p>
<h1>28</h1>
<p>9. THE ETERNAL WILL ESTABLISH THEE FOR A HOLY PEOPLE UNTO HIMSELF AS HE HATH SWORN UNTO THEE. He applies the term &#x201C;oath&#x201D; to the covenant which He made with them at Mount Sinai concerning all these things, for there it was said, <italic>And ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2199">80</xref></sup> Or it may be that the covenant He made with Abraham <italic>to be a G-d unto thee and to thy seed after thee</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2200">81</xref></sup> includes this one.<sup><xref rid="fn2201">82</xref></sup> Similarly he said, <italic>that He may establish thee this day unto Himself for a people, and that He may be unto thee a G-d, as He spoke unto thee, and as He swore unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2202">83</xref></sup> for the covenant was made for all of them.</p>
<p>13. AND THE ETERNAL WILL MAKE THEE THE HEAD, AND NOT THE TAIL. The meaning thereof is that He will make you the head of all peoples and not the tail of any one of the nations, for it is possible that you will be the head of many peoples and yet be the tail of one nation more distinguished than you. The correct interpretation is that He will henceforth make you the head and at no time will you ever be the tail. Similarly, <italic>thou shalt be above only</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2203">84</xref></sup> always, <italic>and thou shalt not be beneath</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2203">84</xref></sup> forever.</p>
<p>14. AND THOU SHALT NOT TURN ASIDE FROM ANY OF THE WORDS WHICH I COMMAND YOU THIS DAY. This is connected with the expression [in the preceding Verse 13] <italic>if thou shalt hearken</italic>, meaning that all these blessings will come upon you when you will hearken to His commandments, and when you will not turn aside <italic>to the right, or to the left</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2204">85</xref></sup> from any of the words which I command you concerning idolatry. For, if you will <italic>go after other gods to serve them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2204">85</xref></sup> you will already have turned aside from all His commandments<sup><xref rid="fn2205">86</xref></sup> and He shall have no desire whatever for any of the commandments you may observe. The sense of the verse is thus unlike the words of the &#x201C;Hilchoth Gedoloth&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2178">59</xref></sup> who counted this verse as a negative commandment.</p>
<p>18. In the blessings he mentioned first <italic>the fruit of thy body</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2206">87</xref></sup> and afterwards <italic>thy basket and thy kneading-trough</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2207">88</xref></sup> for the fruit of the body is the best and most beloved, but in the curses he delayed it [mentioning first <italic>thy basket and thy kneading-trough</italic> in Verse 17, and <italic>the fruit of thy body</italic> in Verse 18] because the punishment extends first to a man&#x2019;s possessions,<sup><xref rid="fn2208">89</xref></sup> and, if he does not repent, it reaches the fruit of his body. Similarly, in the blessings he mentioned first the smiting of the enemies<sup><xref rid="fn2209">90</xref></sup> before the blessing <italic>in thy barns, and in all that thou puttest thy hand unto</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2210">91</xref></sup> for triumph over the enemy is the honor and necessity for them in the conquest of the lands, and their dwelling safely among the peoples. And in the curses he mentioned first the diminishing <italic>in all that thou puttest thy hand unto to do</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2211">92</xref></sup> and delayed their being smitten before the enemies,<sup><xref rid="fn2212">93</xref></sup> for this is the punishment that would reach them afterwards &#x2014; and in the end they would be exiled.<sup><xref rid="fn2213">94</xref></sup></p>
<p>42. &#x2018;HA&#x2019;TZLATZAL.&#x2019; In the opinion of Rashi this is one of the species of the locust. But if so, it would have been proper for him [Moses] to connect it with the verses where he speaks of <italic>the locust</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2214">95</xref></sup> and <italic>the worm&#x0021;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2215">96</xref></sup> It appears more likely that the word <italic>tz&#x2019;latzal</italic> is a term for &#x201C;a hostile army.&#x201D; He is thus stating, <italic>Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but they shall not be thine</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2216">97</xref></sup> to work for you and be <italic>a nourisher of thine old age</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2217">98</xref></sup> <italic>for they shall go into captivity</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2216">97</xref></sup> before the enemy. And he states, <italic>All thy trees and the fruit of thy soil</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2218">99</xref></sup> which will not bear fruits for you, as he mentioned<sup><xref rid="fn2219">100</xref></sup> &#x2014; the enemy coming upon you will take possession, for in the year during which the enemy will come upon you, [the trees and fields] will yield them their produce and they will eat it. Now, an army is called <italic>tz&#x2019;latzal</italic> [from the term <italic>tzeltzal</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;cymbal&#x201D;] because of <italic>the noise of war in the camp</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2220">101</xref></sup> which they cause and <italic>the voice of the horn</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2221">102</xref></sup> <italic>the thunder of the captains</italic>, and <italic>the shouting</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2222">103</xref></sup> [The word <italic>tz&#x2019;latzal</italic> is thus] from the word <italic>&#x2018;tziltzelei shama&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>loud-sounding cymbals</italic>) and <italic>&#x2018;tziltzelei t&#x2019;ruah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>clanging cymbals</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn2223">104</xref></sup> <italic>and with rattles</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2224">105</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;uv&#x2019;tzeltzelim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and with cymbals</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2225">106</xref></sup> Similarly, the expression, <italic>Ah, land of &#x2018;tziltzal&#x2019; of wings</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2226">107</xref></sup> means a land [i.e., a people] that causes &#x201C;the sound of its wings&#x201D; be heard as it goes to far off places <italic>as the vulture swoopeth down</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2227">108</xref></sup> And in the Gemara we find:<sup><xref rid="fn2228">109</xref></sup> &#x201C;[The Mishnah states: &#x2018;If a man took illegal possession of a field] and <italic>masikin</italic> took it from him.&#x2019; The scholar that reads the word as <italic>masikin</italic> is not in error, for it is written <italic>yeyaresh ha&#x2019;tzlatzal</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2229">110</xref></sup> which we translate [in Onkelos&#x2019; rendition] &#x2018;<italic>yachs&#x2019;nine saka&#x2019;ah&#x2019;</italic> (the &#x2018;locust&#x2019; will take possession). And the scholar that reads the word as <italic>matzikin</italic> is also not in error, for it is written <italic>in the siege &#x2018;uvmatzok&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and in the straitness</italic>),&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2230">111</xref></sup> for the word [<italic>saka&#x2019;ah</italic> which is the Aramaic equivalent of the Hebrew <italic>tz&#x2019;latzal</italic>] was to the Sages the term for those who bring people <italic>in the siege and in the straitness</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2230">111</xref></sup> [and is thus also an expression for a hostile army, and not as Rashi says that it is a species of the locust].</p>
<p>Know that the admonitions concerning scantiness, discomfiture, rebuke,<sup><xref rid="fn2231">112</xref></sup> pestilence,<sup><xref rid="fn2232">113</xref></sup> <italic>trees, and the fruit of the soil</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2229">110</xref></sup> and all the other admonitions will all endure until He will cause you to vanish from <italic>the Land whither thou goest in to possess it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2233">114</xref></sup> But after the exile [will have taken place] he does not imprecate them except by saying, <italic>and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2234">115</xref></sup> At times, however, he reverts to reprove them while still in the Land, as he said, <italic>The Eternal will bring thee, and thy king whom thou shalt set over thee, unto a nation that thou hast not known, thou nor thy fathers; and there thou shalt serve other gods</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2234">115</xref></sup> this being a reference to the exile in which we were expatriated to Rome because of the journey there of King Agrippa<sup><xref rid="fn2235">116</xref></sup> [the last king during the period of the Second Temple who made a covenant with Rome].<sup><xref rid="fn2236">117</xref></sup> Afterwards he [Moses] reverts and says, <italic>Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2237">118</xref></sup> Now, these admonitions [apply] while they are in the Land, for so he states afterwards, <italic>and ye shall be plucked from off the Land</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2233">114</xref></sup> which is a reference to the exile. In my opinion this, too, is part of Moses&#x2019; intimations. He states, <italic>The Eternal will bring thee, and thy king whom thou shalt set over thee, unto a nation that thou hast not known</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2234">115</xref></sup> which alludes to King Agrippa&#x2019;s journey to Rome. It is also possible that he alludes to another king, preceding Agrippa, namely Aristobulus<sup><xref rid="fn2238">119</xref></sup> whom the Roman general [Pompey] captured and brought there [to Rome] in fetters of brass. They [the captives] became <italic>a proverb, and a byword among all the peoples</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2239">120</xref></sup> who were so amazed at their historic strength [and nevertheless such a calamity befell them that the viewers said], <italic>How are the mighty fallen, and</italic> their <italic>weapons of war perished&#x0021;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2240">121</xref></sup> Afterwards<sup><xref rid="fn2241">122</xref></sup> Agrippa [II] came once again with the emissary of the king of Rome into the Land and captured very large cities in the land of Judea. Then was fulfilled what he [Moses] said, <italic>And thou shalt serve thine enemy whom the Eternal shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2242">123</xref></sup> It further states, <italic>The Eternal will bring a nation against thee from afar</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2243">124</xref></sup> for, Vespasian and his son Titus came with a very large Roman army into the Land and captured all the fortified cities of Judea, and oppressed them greatly, as is known from the [history] books that they also captured the walls of Jerusalem and there remained only the Sanctuary and the wall of the Court. They [the besieged] ate the flesh of their sons and their daughters.<sup><xref rid="fn2244">125</xref></sup> And when the Sanctuary was also captured, then was fulfilled <italic>and ye shall be plucked from off the Land</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2233">114</xref></sup> Then the Romans returned to their country taking with them the exile of Jerusalem, as did the many [foreign] peoples, too, who were with them [i.e., the Romans] &#x2014; from Greece, Egypt, Syria and many other peoples [who had joined the Romans in the destruction of Jerusalem and who took Israelite captives with them]. Then was fulfilled the verse, <italic>And the Eternal shall scatter thee among all peoples</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2245">126</xref></sup> The verses after that, all refer to their punishment in exile. So also, <italic>And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2246">127</xref></sup> applies to our fear in exile under peoples who constantly promulgate decrees against us. The correct interpretation is that this verse alludes to those generations that existed at the time of the destruction of the Second Temple, for the Romans were then scheming to destroy the Jews completely. Therefore he says afterwards, <italic>And the Eternal shall bring thee back into Egypt in ships</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2247">128</xref></sup> which happened when [the Romans] finished removing them from the Land. And our Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn2247">128</xref></sup> &#x201C;Why [was it decreed that they be brought back into] Egypt? Because it is offensive and evil for a servant when he returns to his first master.&#x201D; If so, he mentioned Egypt as a reproof. However, once we have been exiled to the countries of our enemies, the work of our hands has not been accursed. Neither have our oxen and the breeds of our flock, our vineyards and our olive orchards and that which we have sown in the field [been adversely affected]. Rather in the countries [of our exile] we are like the rest of the peoples who inhabit whatever country, or even better than them,<sup><xref rid="fn2248">129</xref></sup> for His mercies are upon us, because our habitations in exile are by [virtue of] the promise He made to us, <italic>And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break My covenant with them; for I am the Eternal their G-d</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2249">130</xref></sup> I have already explained in <italic>Seder Im Bechukothai</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2250">131</xref></sup> the secret of this covenant [mentioned here], and that it refers to the present time of our exile at the hand of the &#x201C;fourth beast,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2251">132</xref></sup> and afterwards He assured us of being [completely] redeemed therefrom.</p>
<p>Now, we have examined the punishments for idolatry which are mentioned in the Torah in many places, among them what is stated at the beginning [of this book]: <italic>When thou shalt beget children, and children&#x2019;s children, and ye shall have been long in the Land, and shall deal corruptly, and make a graven image</italic> etc.,<sup><xref rid="fn2252">133</xref></sup> this being a warning to Israel lest they worship idols after being in the Land for many years and having grown old in it. The punishment for that is, <italic>I call heaven and earth to witness</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2253">134</xref></sup> until <italic>And the Eternal shall scatter you among the peoples, and ye shall be left few in number</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2254">135</xref></sup> And there it is stated, <italic>And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men&#x2019;s hands</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2255">136</xref></sup> and he promised, <italic>But from thence ye will seek the Eternal thy G-d, and thou shalt find Him</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2256">137</xref></sup> This has been fulfilled with them [in the Babylonian exile] as I have already mentioned and explained.<sup><xref rid="fn2250">131</xref></sup> And in another chapter he said, <italic>And it shall be, when the Eternal thy G-d shall bring thee into the Land which He swore unto thy fathers</italic> etc.;<sup><xref rid="fn2257">138</xref></sup> <italic>Ye shall not go after other gods of the peoples that are round about you</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2258">139</xref></sup> And the punishment is, <italic>for a jealous G-d, even the Eternal thy G-d, is in the midst of thee; lest the anger of the Eternal thy G-d be kindled against thee, and He destroy thee from off the face of the earth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2259">140</xref></sup> This is a warning to those who enter the Land lest they immediately become attached to idolatry and forget the G-d Who brought them forth from Egypt and walk after the idols. This Israel never did, nor did this punishment ever take place. The language of the verse implies this &#x2014; that it is a warning, not a suggestion of something destined to be, as he said, <italic>lest the anger of the Eternal thy G-d be kindled against thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2259">140</xref></sup> that is to say, you should be fearful of this. In a third chapter he stated <italic>Beware lest thou forget the Eternal thy G-d, in not keeping His commandments, and His ordinances, and His statutes</italic> etc.,<sup><xref rid="fn2260">141</xref></sup> and he said, <italic>and thy heart be lifted up, and thou forget the Eternal thy G-d, Who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt</italic> etc.; <italic>Who led thee through the great and dreadful wilderness</italic> etc.,<sup><xref rid="fn2261">142</xref></sup> and so throughout the section. <italic>And thou say in thy heart: &#x2018;My power and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth.&#x2019; But thou shalt remember the Eternal thy G-d, for it is He that giveth thee power to get wealth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2262">143</xref></sup> And here [i.e., in this third chapter] he said, <italic>And it shall be, if thou shalt forget the Eternal thy G-d, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I forewarn you this day</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2263">144</xref></sup> This is also a warning to those entering the Land lest they forget <italic>the Glorious Name</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2264">145</xref></sup> and deny that it was He Who brought them forth from the land of Egypt and [lest they claim that] He did nothing for them, but that they did everything by their own power because they were strong and therefore they will worship the idols as they please. The punishment for this would be complete destruction: <italic>As the nations that the Eternal causeth to perish before you, so shall ye perish</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2265">146</xref></sup> The language of the verse indicates that he is warning them lest they do so when they enter the Land before they grow old in it, before they destroy all the peoples of the Land. Therefore he said, <italic>As the nations that the Eternal causeth to perish before you, so shall ye perish</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2265">146</xref></sup> which applied to the time when the peoples [of the Land] were destroyed, and he warned them that G-d would turn His hand from the destruction of these peoples and He would destroy Israel like them. This, too, Israel never did, and nothing like it came upon them. The fourth time he warned and explained, saying, <italic>And it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the Eternal thy G-d, to observe to do all His commandments and His statutes</italic> etc. <italic>that all these curses shall come upon thee</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2266">147</xref></sup> and all the words of the covenant [which follow], and in the end there is the great promise: <italic>And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee</italic> etc., <italic>and thou shalt bethink thyself</italic> etc., <italic>and shalt return unto the Eternal thy G-d</italic> etc., <italic>that then the Eternal thy G-d will restore thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2267">148</xref></sup> and so on to the conclusion of the section. Now, this is the warning and allusion to this our [present] exile and to the perfect redemption by which we will be redeemed therefrom. And the fifth chapter is a warning by way of a prophecy to be fulfilled: <italic>And the Eternal said unto Moses: &#x2018;Behold, thou art about to sleep with thy fathers, and this people will rise up &#x2026;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2268">149</xref></sup> [<italic>Now therefore write ye this Song for you &#x2026;</italic>] <italic>that this Song shall testify before them as a witness, for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed</italic> etc.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn2269">150</xref></sup> This warning has been wholly fulfilled in its literal sense and wider meaning.</p>
<h1>29</h1>
<p>1. AND MOSES CALLED ALL ISRAEL. The purport thereof is that after he finished telling them the words of the covenant he called them again, saying, &#x201C;Hear, O Israel, <italic>Ye have seen</italic> etc.,&#x201D; for they had not left him, since these sections are all connected.</p>
<p>5. YE HAVE NOT EATEN BREAD, NEITHER HAVE YE DRUNK WINE OR STRONG DRINK. The meaning thereof is &#x201C;You have not eaten [sufficiently] thereof that you should be able to live by it,&#x201D; for their principal sustenance was the manna. THAT YE MIGHT KNOW THAT I AM THE ETERNAL YOUR G-D Who keeps you alive miraculously. Now, it could not mean that they did not eat bread at all, as Scripture [says of Moses], <italic>I did neither eat bread nor drink water</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2270">151</xref></sup> for on some occasions Israel did have bread in the wilderness, as it is written, <italic>Thou shalt sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink; as the children of Esau that dwell in Seir, and the Moabites that dwell in Ar, did unto</italic> me.<sup><xref rid="fn2271">152</xref></sup> And our Rabbis mentioned<sup><xref rid="fn2272">153</xref></sup> that the merchants of the peoples of the world brought them [various foods] in the desert.</p>
<p>It is further possible that from the time the manna descended until they came to Seir they did not eat bread at all, for they travelled <italic>through the great and dreadful wilderness</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2273">154</xref></sup> But in the fortieth year they approached inhabited land, and it was said to them, <italic>Ye are to pass through the border of your brethren the children of Esau;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2274">155</xref></sup> <italic>Ye shall purchase food of them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2275">156</xref></sup> There it is written, <italic>these forty years the Eternal thy G-d hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2276">157</xref></sup> And from that time on, the Edomites and the Moabites<sup><xref rid="fn2277">158</xref></sup> met them with food and drink and prominent Israelites would buy from them for pleasure, not for necessity, nor for satiety, because their principal sustenance was [still] the manna.</p>
<ftnote id="fn2120">(1) Literally: &#x201C;the Chosen House.&#x201D; See Vol. IV, p. 178, Note 120. &#x2014; &#x201C;Fit to be taken to the Sanctuary,&#x201D; this is undoubtedly a reference to what is stated in the Mishnah, that those who could afford it, &#x201C;brought their first-fruits in baskets overlaid with silver and gold, while poor people brought them in wicker baskets of peeled willow-branches&#x201D; (Bikurim 3:8).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2121">(2) This is the law of the Torah. The Rabbis however, established a minimum amount for the heave-offering to the priest. A liberal person should give one fortieth of his crop, a moderate person, one fiftieth; and a niggardly person, one sixtieth. In the case of first-fruits, the measure is one sixtieth of the produce, this law applying equally to all people (Chullin 137b).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2122">(3) This was after the fourteen years of the conquest and division of the Land, during which the ark of G-d was in Gilgal. Immediately thereafter they brought the ark to Shiloh where the House of G-d existed for a period of three hundred and sixty nine years. When the Philistines destroyed the Sanctuary in the days of Eli, the ark was moved to Nob and Gibeon, where it remained for a period of fifty seven years. From there it was moved by David to Jerusalem, and when Solomon completed the Sanctuary, it was placed in its final resting-place, the Holy of Holies. The period of Nob and Gibeon was not considered of the status of Israel having been brought <italic>to the rest and to the inheritance</italic> (above 12:9), because the structure of the House of G-d was not of stone as it had been at Shiloh; instead, it was made of the boards and curtains from the Tabernacle in the wilderness. Therefore during the fifty-seven years when the ark of G-d was first in Nob and later in Gibeon, it was permissible to bring offerings to G-d on the <italic>bamoth</italic>, &#x201C;high places,&#x201D; or private altars. See also further, Note 6.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2125">(6) Or &#x201C;the Permanent House.&#x201D; The Sanctuary in Jerusalem is so called in contrast to the Tabernacle, which was portable. Also, because once the Sanctuary was built in Jerusalem, the place retains its sanctity forever, to the extent that even after its destruction, offerings may no longer be brought anywhere else. In the case of the Sanctuary in Shiloh, however, <italic>bamoth</italic> were permitted after its destruction.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2126">(7) Verse 4. And &#x201C;the altar&#x201D; was only in the central place of worship &#x2014; including Nob or Gibeon &#x2014; but not at a private <italic>bamah</italic>. See further Vol. III, p. 123, Note 122 and Vol. IV, p. 180, Note 138.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2131">(12) Ecclesiastes 1:10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2132">(13) Rosh Hashanah 25b. The prophet Samuel is cited by Scripture as being equal to Moses and Aaron (Psalms 99:6). Elsewhere Jephthah is mentioned together with Samuel (I Samuel 12:11), thus teaching us that Jephthah in his generation was entitled to obedience just as was Samuel in his generation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2133">(14) This statement will be explained further on by Ramban as applying to a judge who was disqualified from rendering judgment involving a member of his family. This stricture does not apply to the bringing of first-fruits to a kindred priest who is ministering in the Sanctuary.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2134">(15) Ecclesiastes 7:10. The word <italic>days</italic> thus refers to &#x201C;the judges of <italic>the former days</italic>.&#x201D; Do not say that the judges of the former generations were better than those of the present, and therefore I would not listen to them. Instead you are to listen to them, for you are only concerned with them (Maharsha, Rosh Hashanah 25b).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2135">(16) In our text of the Gemara it is found in the third chapter of Kiddushin 66b. The tractate contains four chapters.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2136">(17) But if he ceased to be his kinsman &#x2014; for example, a son-in-law [of the elder] whose wife died &#x2014; he becomes qualified to judge.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2137">(18) Exodus 19:9. &#x2014; The difficulty in the verse here is the word <italic>higad&#x2019;ti</italic> which is in the past, when he has not made yet his declaration. Therefore Ramban writes that the very act of bringing the first-fruits into the Sanctuary Court constitutes a form of professing the omnipotence of G-d and an expression of thanksgiving to Him. In this sense the form of the word <italic>higad&#x2019;ti</italic> is properly in the past, since the act of bringing the first-fruits has formed the way of communicating these thoughts. Such a usage is seen in the verse <italic>vayegeid Mosheh</italic>, which means that Moses &#x201C;communicated&#x201D; the words of the people to the Eternal.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2138">(19) The &#x201C;avowal was recited at the time of the Afternoon Offering on the last day of Passover, in the fourth and seventh years of the Sabbatical cycle. The avowal [recited in any language] could be made only by one who observed all laws affecting tithes and heave-offerings. See further &#x201C;The Commandments,&#x201D; Vol. I, p. 139.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2139">(20) Maaseir Sheini 5:10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2140">(21) Verse 13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2141">(22) &#x201C;<italic>I have also given it to the Levite</italic>, this is the tithe of the Levite [i.e., the First Tithe]. <italic>I have &#x2018;also&#x2019; given it</italic>, this is the <italic>terumah</italic> (the heave-offering), [given by the Israelite to the priest] and the heave-offering of the tithe [given by the Levite to the priest]. <italic>And unto the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow</italic>, this refers to the Poorman&#x2019;s Tithe, gleanings, the forgotten sheaf, and the corner of the field&#x201D; (Maaseir Sheini 5:10).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2142">(23) The heave-offering on the other hand may be eaten by the priest in mourning, but not when he is impure. The First Tithe [after the heave-offering thereof has been removed], the Poorman&#x2019;s Tithe, gleanings, etc. may be eaten in mourning as well as in impurity. The Second Tithe, eaten by the owner, his family and guests in Jerusalem, is thus the only tithe that may not be eaten in mourning. Like the heave-offering and the heave-offering of the tithe, the Second Tithe may not be eaten in impurity.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2177">(58) Rav Saadia Gaon. See Vol., II p. 99, Note 230.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2178">(59) Rabbi Shimon Kairo of the Gaonic period, who flourished in the second half of the eighth century Common Era, was the first to enumerate the <italic>Taryag Mitzvoth</italic> contained in the Torah. The listing is in the preface to his work &#x201C;Hilchoth Gedoloth&#x201D;. His concept was utilized by the <italic>Paitanim</italic>, the writers of liturgical poetry who wrote various <italic>Azharoth</italic> (Exhortations), liturgical poems containing the Divine Commandments. &#x2014; It should be noted that while the &#x201C;Hilchoth Gedoloth&#x201D; contains the first historical record in our possession of an attempt at enumerating the individual commandments, there is no doubt that the author drew upon older sources of such lists, and as Rabbeinu Saadia Gaon writes here, such &#x201C;a list of the commandments&#x201D; was written upon the stones by Moses.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2182">(63) Further, 34:12.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2183">(64) Above, 5:14-15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2184">(65) The thought conveyed is as follows: Scripture usually writes the phrase <italic>&#x2018;l&#x2019;ma&#x2019;an&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>so that &#x2026;</italic>) as the effect of an event although the intent thereof is really for the cause of the event. Thus in the verse before us the order of the words is: <italic>And thou shalt write upon them &#x2026; &#x2018;so that thou mayest&#x2019; go in unto the Land</italic>. From this it would appear that the cause is the writing upon the stones, and the effect is the coming into the Land. Ramban points out that the real thought of the verse is: you are coming into the Land so that you may write G-d&#x2019;s Torah upon the stones. Thus the cause is the coming into the Land and the effect is the writing upon the stones. The word <italic>&#x2018;l&#x2019;ma&#x2019;an&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>so that</italic>) although written with reference to the coming into the Land refers to the writing upon the stones. A similar case is the verse referring to the Sabbath where the word <italic>&#x2018;l&#x2019;ma&#x2019;an&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>so that</italic>) appears with the cause [so that your servants may rest] but should be interpreted with the effect, the remembering of your being a servant. Therefore, the sense of the text is, let your servants rest so that you will remember that you too, were servants in the land of Egypt.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2190">(71) Ruth 3:9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2191">(72) The reference is to Ibn Ezra who interpreted the verse [<italic>A man shall not take his father&#x2019;s wife</italic> &#x2014; above 23:1] as referring to a woman violated by his father. To this Ramban objects, for this opinion coincides with that of Rabbi Akiba, while the majority of the Sages hold that a man may marry such a woman (Yebamoth 49a).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2192">(73) Esther 9:27.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2193">(74) Yerushalmi Sotah VII, 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2194">(75) The title &#x201C;Rav&#x201D; (Rabbi) indicates that that particular Sage lived in Babylon, where there was no ordination of the traditional nature. &#x201C;Rabbi&#x201D; indicates that the Sage lived in the Land of Israel where such ordination was conferred. On &#x201C;ordination&#x201D; see Vol. II, p. 339, Note 20.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2195">(76) II Kings 22:11. The event is narrated that Josiah was brought back to the true faith by the discovery of a copy of the Torah found in the Sanctuary, which escaped the attempts of his predecessors to eradicate the true faith from their kingdom. <italic>And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the Book of the Law, that he rent his clothes</italic> (<italic>ibid</italic>). The question now arises as to which particular verse affected the king to rend his clothes? Rav Hunah in the name of Shmuel said that it was the verse before us, <italic>asher lo yakim &#x2014; &#x2018;that confirmeth not&#x2019; the words of this Law</italic>, and since he was king, he felt it his responsibility to re-institute the authority of the Law.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2196">(77) This obviously refers to the custom of reading from the Torah with the Scroll of the Law in an erect position. This is the custom still followed in Sephardic Synagogues. In Ashkenazic Synagogues the reading from the Torah is done while the sacred Scroll of the Law lies flat on the Reading table.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Nitzavim</title>
<p>9. YE ARE STANDING THIS DAY ALL OF YOU BEFORE THE ETERNAL YOUR G-D. The meaning thereof is that you are standing and ready before G-d to be initiated into His covenant. For, in order to accept the Torah with its interpretation, they had gathered before him [Moses], or they may have stood before the ark of G-d. The covenant was the oath and imprecation which he mentioned &#x2014; <italic>that thou shouldest enter into the covenant of the Eternal thy G-d, and into His oath</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2278">1</xref></sup> It is possible that he made another covenant with them like the first covenant which he made with them at Mount Sinai,<sup><xref rid="fn2279">2</xref></sup> namely, that he offered a burnt-offering on their behalf, and took half of the blood to sprinkle upon the altar and he sprinkled half of the blood upon the people, but it was unnecessary for him to mention this. And by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], I have already informed you of [the secret of] this covenant.<sup><xref rid="fn2280">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x2018;RASHEICHEM SHIVTEICHEM.&#x2019; In the opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra this means <italic>rasheichem rashei shivteichem</italic> (&#x201C;your heads, the heads of your tribes&#x201D;),<sup><xref rid="fn2281">4</xref></sup> like <italic>and the prophecy of Oded the prophet</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2282">5</xref></sup> [which means &#x201C;and the prophecy, the prophecy of Oded the prophet&#x201D;].<sup><xref rid="fn2282">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In my opinion the verse generalizes and then specifies. The generalization is: &#x201C;your heads and all your tribes,&#x201D; and then it specifies <italic>your elders, and your officers</italic> who are your heads, for <italic>the elder and the man of rank, he is the head</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2283">6</xref></sup> Similarly, he stated <italic>Assemble unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2284">7</xref></sup> for any person who has authority and appointive power over the public is called <italic>rosh</italic> (head). Thus it is said of the princes [of the tribes], <italic>they were &#x2018;the heads of&#x2019; the thousands of Israel</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2285">8</xref></sup> for they were the highest rank of all the thousands of Israel. And it is stated of the spies, [<italic>all of them were</italic>] <italic>&#x2018;heads of&#x2019; the children of Israel</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2286">9</xref></sup> meaning they were &#x201C;among&#x201D; the heads of the children of Israel, not the heads of all the children of Israel &#x2014; and they were all included in the term <italic>your heads</italic>. He then stated again <italic>even all the men of Israel</italic> who comprise <italic>your tribes</italic>.</p>
<p>Then he mentioned further the little children, the women, the strangers, the hewers of wood and drawers of water<sup><xref rid="fn2287">10</xref></sup> whom they had from among the <italic>mixed multitude</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2288">11</xref></sup> He had made them bring the little ones, in order to include them in the covenant, for he made the covenant even with the future generations,<sup><xref rid="fn2289">12</xref></sup> or [the children may have been brought] to make them [i.e., the parents] deserving of Divine reward for bringing them, like the reason the Rabbis gave regarding [the commandment of] the Assembly.<sup><xref rid="fn2290">13</xref></sup> And our Rabbis have said<sup><xref rid="fn2291">14</xref></sup> that some Canaanites [posing as proselytes] came in Moses&#x2019; days just as they came in Joshua&#x2019;s days<sup><xref rid="fn2292">15</xref></sup> and Moses <italic>made them hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for</italic> the Tabernacle <italic>of G-d</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2293">16</xref></sup> Now, the intent of the Rabbis is not to state that these Canaanites deceived Moses [as they misled Joshua]; instead, they came to him to make peace with him, for such is the law as we have explained.<sup><xref rid="fn2294">17</xref></sup> Thus I found in Midrash Tanchuma:<sup><xref rid="fn2295">18</xref></sup> &#x201C;This teaches you that they [the Canaanites] came before Moses and he did not accept them.&#x201D; That is to say, they could not deceive him into making a covenant with them, but he immediately made them hewers of wood and drawers of water.</p>
<p>14. AND ALSO WITH HIM THAT IS NOT WITH US THIS DAY &#x2014; &#x201C;that is, also with the future generations. 15. FOR YE KNOW HOW WE DWELT IN THE LAND OF EGYPT etc. 16. AND YE HAVE SEEN THEIR ABOMINATIONS. Because you have seen the nations that worship idols, and perhaps the heart of one of you might beguile him to follow them. 17. LEST THERE SHOULD BE AMONG YOU etc. Therefore, I must place you under an oath.&#x201D; Thus far is Rashi&#x2019;s language. He has commented well. And the purport thereof is to state, &#x201C;I must bring you now into this covenant with an imprecation and an oath on account of my fear that perhaps the hearts of some of you have been beguiled into following the abominations of Egypt as you did at the [affair of the golden] calf, or the abominations of Ammon and Moab that you saw on the road when you had the affair with Baal-peor,&#x201D; for at the first covenant at the time of the Giving of the Torah there were no imprecations and curses. He stated [<italic>lest there should be among you</italic>] <italic>man or woman</italic> because a woman is frivolous [and can easily be led into idol-worship]. He stated a similar expression in [the chapter dealing with an individual] worshipping the idols.<sup><xref rid="fn2296">19</xref></sup> He mentioned individuals, family, and tribe [<italic>lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe</italic>] meaning a multitude, but he did not say it [lest they should worship the idols] concerning all of them, out of respect [to them]. Or it may be that it was impossible for the hearts of all of them to turn to the idols on that day, because, if so, they would not have come into the covenant of G-d and His oath, for who could have compelled them. A family or tribe, however, might have come into the covenant for fear of the majority. He stated <italic>lest there should be among you</italic> [<italic>man, or woman</italic> etc.] <italic>whose heart turneth away this day</italic> referring to him who has already been beguiled to idol-worship and who secretly believes in them that day. <italic>Or lest there should be among you an</italic> evil <italic>root</italic> that will blossom and grow and in the coming days will bring forth poisonous buds and grow bitter herbs. This refers back to <italic>him that is not here with us this day</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2297">20</xref></sup> for the father is <italic>the root</italic> and the son is <italic>the twig that shall grow forth out of his roots</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2298">21</xref></sup> He mentioned <italic>the root</italic> in order to state that he can bring the coming generations into this oath, for the root from which the coming generations will grow is before him this day, and it comes within this covenant and oath. He stated <italic>a root that beareth gall</italic> to suggest that from a sweet root no bitter plant will issue, and that all those whose hearts are perfect with <italic>the Glorious Name</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2299">22</xref></sup> and gave no thought to the idols, will not give birth to a child, who will avow idolatry. Now, do not refute me in this matter on the basis of the verse <italic>If he</italic> [a man who is just, and does that which is lawful and right] <italic>beget a son that is a robber</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2300">23</xref></sup> for the matter is true, there being a great secret therein which I cannot explain.<sup><xref rid="fn2301">24</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;Rosh v&#x2019;la&#x2019;anah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>gall and wormwood</italic>) are bitter or poisonous herbs. These are their names in the Sacred Language. Or it may be that they are surnames, one called <italic>rosh</italic> (&#x201C;the head&#x201D;) because it is the head of the bitter herbs, the bitterest of all, and the second is called <italic>la&#x2019;anah</italic>, from the expression <italic>&#x2018;lei&#x2019;anoth&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>to humble thyself</italic>) <italic>before Me</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2302">25</xref></sup> for he who eats it becomes oppressed and is humbled, because he eats it only in order to afflict his soul.</p>
<p>18. AND HE BLESS HIMSELF IN HIS HEART, SAYING: [&#x2018;I SHALL HAVE PEACE&#x2019;]. When he will hear others imprecating themselves with these oaths, he will in his imagination bless himself, saying in his heart, &#x201C;<italic>I shall have peace</italic> from any curse when I follow the desire of my heart.&#x201D; G-d will not pardon him; instead, His anger will then be kindled against him<sup><xref rid="fn2303">26</xref></sup> whenever he sins, in that generation or [when his descendants sin] in later generations.<sup><xref rid="fn2304">27</xref></sup> Or the sense of the verses may be as follows: &#x201C;Because he says [publicly]: <italic>I shall have peace</italic>, since in my heart I do not accept the oath upon myself, <italic>for I shall walk in the stubborness of my heart</italic> all my days and carry out all my desires. And <italic>the Eternal will not be willing to pardon him</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2303">26</xref></sup> because he did not accept His imprecation; instead, His anger will be kindled against him<sup><xref rid="fn2303">26</xref></sup> since he came into the covenant in My presence with all [the people of] Israel.&#x201D; [Therefore the refusal of an individual to accept the covenant constitutes a punishable defiance.]</p>
<p>A desire that grows stronger and more in one&#x2019;s heart is termed [in Hebrew] <italic>shriruth</italic> [<italic>&#x2018;ki bishriruth libi eileich&#x2019; &#x2014; for I shall walk in &#x2018;the stubborness&#x2019; of my heart</italic>], similar to the expression of the Sages:<sup><xref rid="fn2305">28</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>sharir</italic> (strong) and established.&#x201D; So also, <italic>&#x2018;bishrirei&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>in the muscles of</italic>) <italic>his body</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2306">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x2018;L&#x2019;MA&#x2019;AN&#x2019; (THAT) THE WATERED BE SWEPT AWAY WITH THE THIRSTY. The meaning thereof is &#x201C; &#x2018;to supplement&#x2019; the watered with the thirsty,&#x201D; for the satisfied soul is called <italic>ravah</italic> (satiated), similar to, <italic>And I will &#x2018;satiate the soul&#x2019; of the priests with fatness, and My people shall be satisfied with My goodness;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2307">30</xref></sup> <italic>and their soul shall be as a watered garden</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2308">31</xref></sup> while the desiring soul is called <italic>tz&#x2019;meiah</italic> (thirsty): <italic>My &#x2018;soul thirsteth&#x2019; for Thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2309">32</xref></sup> Therefore, the sense of the verse is: when into a person&#x2019;s satisfied soul &#x2014; one that does not desire harmful things &#x2014; there comes a slight craving, and he satisfies his lust, then there will grow in his soul a craving even greater than the original one, for the thing that he ate or that he did, and it [the soul] will lust [even] after evil things for which he never craved at first. Thus, if someone craves for lewdness with beautiful women and becomes carried away in unchastity, his lust will ultimately bring him to sodomy and to bestiality and the like with other forms of lust. This is akin to what the Sages have mentioned [with respect to sexual craving]:<sup><xref rid="fn2310">33</xref></sup> &#x201C;The more one satisfies it, the more it hungers, the more one starves it, the more it is satisfied.&#x201D; Therefore Scripture states concerning him who follows the stubborness of his heart, that if he will satisfy his soul with those stubborn and overpowering desires for which it thirsts, his soul &#x201C;will add the watered to the thirsty,&#x201D; for then he will desire and thirst after things for which he had been satisfied, and with which his soul was satiated [meaning that, up to then, he felt no desire for them]. And, because he used the expression <italic>&#x2018;shoresh poreh&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>a root that beareth</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn2311">34</xref></sup> he follows this usage, saying that this root shall add a branch that will be satiated and leafy to the thirsty one and they will all become thirsty. Thus the word <italic>l&#x2019;ma&#x2019;an</italic> (that) in this place does not refer to the reason [i.e., &#x201C;so that&#x201D;]: &#x201C;I will go in the stubborness of my heart <italic>so that</italic> I supplement the watered with the thirsty.&#x201D; Instead its meaning is like &#x201C;to add&#x201D; &#x2014; Scripture is saying that because of his conduct, this will be the result.<sup><xref rid="fn2312">35</xref></sup> For in every result of a particular action, Scripture uses the term <italic>l&#x2019;ma&#x2019;an</italic>, whether the responsible person does it intentionally to effect that result, as <italic>&#x2018;l&#x2019;ma&#x2019;an&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>so that</italic>) <italic>it may be well with us</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2313">36</xref></sup> or whether the person effecting the result does so unintentionally, as in the expressions: <italic>&#x2018;l&#x2019;ma&#x2019;an&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>that</italic>) <italic>their heart may melt;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2314">37</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;l&#x2019;ma&#x2019;an&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>that</italic>) <italic>your altars may be laid waste;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2315">38</xref></sup> <italic>Of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, &#x2018;l&#x2019;ma&#x2019;an&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>that</italic>) <italic>they may be cut off</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2316">39</xref></sup> and many other similar verses. In my opinion this is the best and most correct of all that has been written about this verse from many aspects.</p>
<p>It is also possible to explain that the phrase [<italic>that the watered &#x2026;</italic>] refers back to the expression <italic>a root that beareth gall and wormwood</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2310">33</xref></sup> the verse stating that he will <italic>bless himself in his heart, saying, &#x2018;I shall have peace,&#x2019;</italic> so that his watered branch, on which grow and sprout the wormwood and gall, should be added to the thirsty one on which nothing has grown.<sup><xref rid="fn2317">40</xref></sup> <italic>Or the watered</italic> may be a surname for the aforementioned <italic>wormwood</italic>, meaning that the watered wormwood which sprouts and grows exceedingly will be added to <italic>the thirsty</italic> which until now has grown but little &#x2014; so that now both will sprout. Thus the intent is to state that anyone who will hear the imprecation and will imagine himself to be immune against it, holding strongly to [this] stubborness, and, as a result, his thoughts will bring him to [further] sin sprouting transgressions greater than the first [<italic>the Eternal will not be willing to pardon him</italic> etc.].<sup><xref rid="fn2303">26</xref></sup> This also is a correct interpretation.</p>
<p>19. THE ANGER OF THE ETERNAL AND HIS JEALOUSY SHALL BE KINDLED AGAINST THAT MAN &#x2014; this refers to the curse against the individual sinner, man or woman. AND THE ETERNAL SHALL BLOT OUT HIS NAME &#x2014; this is the curse against a whole family [if they all be sinners] for there is a common name to the head of their father&#x2019;s house [and that name will be erased].</p>
<p>20. AND THE ETERNAL SHALL MARK HIM OFF FOR EVIL. This refers to a tribe from among the remaining tribes of Israel.</p>
<p>21. AND THE REMOTE GENERATION, YOUR CHILDREN THAT SHALL RISE UP AFTER YOU, SHALL SAY. For the tribes of Israel in the first generation already knew [the cause of the disaster] for they heard the imprecations of the covenant [and therefore he states that the future generation will inquire into the cause of the disaster]. It is possible that this verse refers back to <italic>the root that beareth gall and wormwood</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2310">33</xref></sup> that when this occurs in future generations, they will inquire into its cause.</p>
<p>25. GODS THAT THEY KNEW NOT &#x2014; &#x201C;gods in whom they had never experienced any Divine power. &#x2018;V&#x2019;LO CHALAK LAHEM&#x2019; (AND THAT HE HATH NOT ALLOTTED UNTO THEM) &#x2014; He did not give these [gods] to them [Israel] to be their portion. And Onkelos rendered this expression: <italic>v&#x2019;lo otiva l&#x2019;hon</italic>, meaning, &#x2018;they had not done them any good.&#x2019; [Onkelos thus explained] the term <italic>chalak</italic> as meaning, &#x2018;that god which they have chosen for themselves has never <italic>chalak</italic> (apportioned) them any inheritance or portion.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. The correct interpretation is: &#x201C;<italic>gods that they knew not</italic> as gods, that is to say, [they worshipped gods] whom they knew not as having acted with any Divine power inherent to their essence. And the Eternal, the G-d of their fathers did not allot them [these gods] to them, meaning that He did not designate them as lords over Israel as He placed them over the nations.&#x201D; I have already explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn2318">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. AND THE ETERNAL ROOTED THEM OUT OF THEIR LAND, for He will exile the tribe that will do evil in the sight of the Eternal, as it is stated, <italic>and he</italic> [the king of Assyria] <italic>carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Menasheh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2319">42</xref></sup> The correct interpretation is that he is now alluding to the exile of all Israel, all of them being evil, and they will be banished in a complete exile. Similarly, the following chapter, <italic>And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2320">43</xref></sup> is a reference to the exile of all Israel, as he said, <italic>among all the nations whither the Eternal thy G-d hath driven thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2320">43</xref></sup> and so he concludes the entire chapter.</p>
<p>28. THE SECRET THINGS BELONG UNTO THE ETERNAL OUR G-D. In the opinion of the commentators<sup><xref rid="fn2321">44</xref></sup> the verse states: &#x201C;It is for the Eternal our G-d to execute judgment upon those who worship idols secretly, for all hidden matters are revealed before Him, <italic>but the things that are revealed</italic> are upon us and our children <italic>that we may do</italic> to them <italic>all the words of this Law</italic> &#x2014; to smite the idol-worshippers in accordance with the law of the Torah. According to the interpretation of the Rabbis, too, it is so.<sup><xref rid="fn2322">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>By way of the simple meaning of Scripture it is my opinion that <italic>the secret things</italic> are the sins that are hidden from those who commit them, as it is stated, <italic>Who can discern errors? Cleanse Thou me from hidden faults</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2323">46</xref></sup> The verse states: &#x201C;[Our] hidden sins belong to G-d alone; for them we bear no guilt for having transgressed [unknowingly]. <italic>But the things that are revealed</italic>, namely our conscious sins, <italic>belong unto us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this Law</italic> as an eternal <italic>statute</italic>. As such we accepted it, obligating the one who was present [when the covenant was made] and the one who was not present. And because he included in the imprecation [the obligation] to perform all the commandments, he excluded from the ban whoever commits a sin unintentionally, so that he should not be afflicted by this curse. The words of Onkelos indicate this, for he rendered it, &#x201C;The secret things are before the Eternal our G-d,&#x201D; [thus implying that we will not be punished for sins we have committed unknowingly], but if he agreed with the [aforementioned] interpretation of the commentators [that it is for G-d to punish conscious sins committed secretly] then Onkelos should have said, &#x201C;The secret things are &#x2018;to&#x2019; the Eternal our G-d&#x201D; [to punish].</p>
<h1>30</h1>
<p>1. AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS, WHEN ALL THESE THINGS ARE COME UPON THEE. I have already mentioned<sup><xref rid="fn2324">47</xref></sup> that this chapter refers to the future, for all its subjects have not happened and have not been created, but they are destined to take place.</p>
<p>2. AND THOU SHALT RETURN UNTO THE ETERNAL THY G-D, AND HEARKEN TO HIS VOICE ACCORDING TO ALL THAT I COMMAND THEE THIS DAY, THOU AND THY CHILDREN. The meaning thereof is that you will return <italic>with all thy heart, and with all thy soul</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2325">48</xref></sup> and you will take it upon yourself and upon your children throughout their generations to do <italic>according to all that I command thee this day</italic>, just as they did at the second redemption [i.e., the redemption from Babylon], as it is written, <italic>and they entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in G-d&#x2019;s law, which was given by Moses the servant of G-d, and to observe and do all the commandments of the Eternal our G-d, and His ordinances and His statutes</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2326">49</xref></sup> Or it may be that the expression <italic>that I command thee this day, thou and thy children</italic> is like &#x201C;command you &#x2014; to you and to your children,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2327">50</xref></sup> similar to the expression <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;atah tzuveitha&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2328">51</xref></sup> [meaning <italic>lecha tzuveithi</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;to you I ordered that the command be given&#x201D;]. So also, <italic>and they dealt ill &#x2018;othanu&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2329">52</xref></sup> means <italic>lanu</italic> (&#x201C;to us&#x201D;).<sup><xref rid="fn2330">53</xref></sup> And in my opinion there is in this matter a great secret; for it alludes to that which the Rabbis said,<sup><xref rid="fn2331">54</xref></sup> &#x201C;The son of David [i.e., the Messiah] will not come until all souls in the <italic>guf</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2332">55</xref></sup> are exhausted.&#x201D; I have already spoken of this matter.<sup><xref rid="fn2333">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. AND THE ETERNAL THY G-D WILL CIRCUMCISE THY HEART. It is this which the Rabbis have said,<sup><xref rid="fn2334">57</xref></sup> &#x201C;If someone comes to purify himself, they assist him&#x201D; [from on High]. The verse assures you that you will return to Him with all your heart and He will help you.</p>
<p>This following subject is very apparent from Scripture: Since the time of Creation, man has had the power<sup><xref rid="fn2335">58</xref></sup> to do as he pleased, to be righteous or wicked. This [grant of free will] applies likewise to the entire Torah-period, so that people can gain merit upon choosing the good and punishment for preferring evil. But in the days of the Messiah, the choice of their [genuine] good will be natural; the heart will not desire the improper and it will have no craving whatever for it. This is the &#x201C;circumcision&#x201D; mentioned here, for lust and desire are the &#x201C;foreskin&#x201D; of the heart, and circumcision of the heart means that it will not covet or desire evil. Man will return at that time to what he was before the sin of Adam, when by his nature he did what should properly be done, and there were no conflicting desires in his will, as I have explained in <italic>Seder Bereshith</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2336">59</xref></sup> It is this which Scripture states in [the Book of] Jeremiah, <italic>Behold, the days come, saith the Eternal, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah; not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers</italic> etc. <italic>But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Eternal, I will put my Law in their inward parts, and in their heart will I write it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2337">60</xref></sup> This is a reference to the annulment of the evil instinct and to the natural performance by the heart of its proper function. Therefore Jeremiah said further, <italic>and I will be their G-d, and they shall be My people; and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying: &#x2018;Know the Eternal;&#x2019; for they shall all know Me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2338">61</xref></sup> Now, it is known that <italic>the imagination of man&#x2019;s heart is evil from his youth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2339">62</xref></sup> and it is necessary to instruct them, but at that time it will not be necessary to instruct them [to avoid evil] for their evil instinct will then be completely abolished. And so it is declared by Ezekiel, <italic>A new heart will I also give you, and a new spirit will I put within you;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2340">63</xref></sup> <italic>and I will cause you to walk in My statutes</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2341">64</xref></sup> The <italic>new heart</italic> alludes to man&#x2019;s nature, and the [<italic>new</italic>] <italic>spirit</italic> to the desire and will. It is this which our Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn2342">65</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say: &#x2018;I have no pleasure in them&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2343">66</xref></sup> &#x2014; these are the days of the Messiah, as they will offer opportunity neither for merit nor for guilt,&#x201D; for in the days of the Messiah there will be no [evil] desire in man but he will naturally perform the proper deeds and therefore there will be neither merit nor guilt in them, for merit and guilt are dependent upon desire.</p>
<p>11. FOR THIS COMMANDMENT. The meaning thereof is that it refers to the entire Torah. But the correct interpretation is that when he refers to the entire Torah, he says [as above] <italic>Every commandment which I command thee this day</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2344">67</xref></sup> Rather [the expression used here] <italic>this commandment</italic> refers to [the commandment of] repentance aforementioned, for the verses, <italic>and thou shalt bethink thyself;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2345">68</xref></sup> <italic>and thou shalt return unto the Eternal thy G-d</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2346">69</xref></sup> constitute a commandment, wherein he commands us to do so. It is stated in a future tense [rather than in the imperative] to suggest, in the form of a pledge, that it is destined [that Israel will repent]. And the sense thereof is to state that <italic>if thy outcasts be in the uttermost parts of heaven</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2347">70</xref></sup> and you are under the power of the nations, you can yet return to G-d and do <italic>according to all that I command thee this day</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2346">69</xref></sup> for the thing is not hard, nor far off from you, but rather <italic>very nigh unto thee</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2348">71</xref></sup> to do it at all times and in all places. This is the sense of the expression, <italic>in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2348">71</xref></sup> meaning that they <italic>confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2349">72</xref></sup> by word of their mouth, and return in their heart to G-d and accept the Torah upon themselves this day to perform it throughout the generations, as he mentioned, <italic>thou and thy children with all thy heart</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2350">73</xref></sup> as I have explained.<sup><xref rid="fn2351">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. SEE, I HAVE SET BEFORE THEE THIS DAY LIFE AND GOOD, AND DEATH AND EVIL. He returns to exhort them yet again, to tell them that there are two courses in their hands and it is in their power to walk in whichever they desire, and there is no power below or above that will withhold them or stop them. And he calls heaven and earth to bear witness against them a second time,<sup><xref rid="fn2352">75</xref></sup> after he had said,<italic>I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2353">76</xref></sup> for now he said, <italic>I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before thee life and death</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2352">75</xref></sup> which are the blessing and the curse, and that I have counselled you that you should choose life, <italic>that hou mayest live, thou and thy seed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2352">75</xref></sup> Thus he is now like someone who has the witnesses sign at the end of all his words.</p>

<ftnote id="fn2280">(3) See Ramban to Leviticus 26:12.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2281">(4) Since a noun in the construct form cannot have a pronoun suffix, the term <italic>rasheichem</italic> cannot mean &#x201C;your heads of.&#x201D; Therefore Ibn Ezra adds the words <italic>rashei</italic>, interpreting the phrase as &#x201C;your heads, &#x2018;the heads of&#x2019; your tribes.&#x201D; See Vol. IV, p. 115, Note 283 for the same principle as applied to another example.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2282">(5) Chronicles 15:8. Here the point is that a noun in the construct form cannot have the prefix <italic>hei</italic> indicating the definite article.

<ftnote id="fn2292">(15) Joshua 9:2-27.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2303">(26) Verse 19.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2304">(27) This is to be understood in the light of Ramban&#x2019;s explanation above, that the expression <italic>whose heart turneth away this day</italic> applies to one who has already been beguiled after the idols; <italic>or lest there should be among you an</italic> evil <italic>root</italic> refers to the descendants. It is with reference to these two types of idol-worshippers that Ramban says here that G-d&#x2019;s anger will be kindled when he sins in that generation, or when his descendants sin in future generations (Kur Zahav).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2310">(33) Succah 52b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2311">(34) Verse 17.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2312">(35) In other words, it is not the sinner who says: &#x201C;<italic>L&#x2019;ma&#x2019;an</italic> (so that) I supplement the watered etc.&#x201D; but it is Scripture which declares &#x201C;<italic>L&#x2019;ma&#x2019;an</italic> etc.&#x201D; that &#x201C;to add&#x201D; the watered etc., will result from his conduct.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2313">(36) Jeremiah 42:6. See my Hebrew commentary p. 478, Note 32, that the reference in the Hebrew text of Ramban is to above, 4:40, but the word <italic>l&#x2019;ma&#x2019;an</italic> is not found there in connection with this expression.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2314">(37) Ezekiel 21:20.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2315">(38) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, 6:6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2316">(39) Hosea 8:4. The result referred to in each of the last three verses is involuntary. Here, too, it cannot be said that they made idols of gold and silver &#x201C;so that&#x201D; they may be cut off. Rather, Scripture states that the undesired result will be that, in punishment, they will be cut off.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2317">(40) The difference between the two interpretations is: In the first interpretation &#x201C;the watered&#x201D; was not lustful &#x2014; it was &#x201C;the thirsty&#x201D; that was the sinful part of the soul. In the second interpretation, however, the sinful aspect of the soul is &#x201C;the watered&#x201D; part, for on it has already grown &#x201C;the gall and the wormwood;&#x201D; and &#x201C;the thirsty&#x201D; is the pure part of the soul, for nothing evil has yet grown on it. The third explanation which follows is similar to the second with a minor change, as explained in the text (Kur Zahav).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2318">(41) See Leviticus 18:25, and above, 4:19.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2324">(47) See Leviticus 26:12, and above, 4:25; 19:8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2325">(48) In Verse 2 before us.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2326">(49) Nehemiah 10:30.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2327">(50) The word <italic>thou</italic> is gramatically difficult, because the verse begins with the accusative <italic>thee</italic>, and follows with the nominative <italic>thou</italic>. Ramban offers two explanations: First, that the verse contains two separate thoughts: that you will return to G-d, and that you will accept upon yourself and your children all that He commands us. Second, that the nominative <italic>thou</italic> is equivalent to the accusative <italic>thee</italic> [&#x201C;to you&#x201D;], and the verse is thus expressing a single thought: &#x201C;<italic>that I command thee this day</italic> &#x2014; to you and to your children.&#x201D; Ramban proceeds to cite Scriptural examples of similar usage &#x2014; a nominative in place of an accusative.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2328">(51) Genesis 45:19. Here, too, the nominative <italic>v&#x2019;atah</italic> (and you) is to be understood as <italic>lecha</italic> (&#x201C;and to you&#x201D;).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2329">(52) Above, 26:6. Here likewise the literal meaning of <italic>othanu</italic> is &#x201C;us,&#x201D; but Ramban interprets it in the context of the verse as if it means &#x201C;to us.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2330">(53) So also in the verse before us, <italic>atah</italic> (you) means <italic>lecha</italic> (to you).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2331">(54) Yebamoth 62a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2332">(55) Here understood as &#x201C;a storehouse of souls in heaven.&#x201D; Ramban&#x2019;s concept is that the final redemption will come when all souls will have been purified and no longer in need of a sojourn on earth. See my Hebrew commentary, p. 479.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2333">(56) See Genesis 1:26 (Vol. I, p. 479).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2334">(57) Shabbath 104a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2335">(58) Literally: &#x201C;the permission.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2336">(59) Genesis 2:9 (Vol. I, pp. 72-73). See also Vol. III, pp. 456-457. &#x2014; It should be noted here that Ramban&#x2019;s intention is not to state that man in the era of Messiah will be completely devoid of the desire to do evil, for if that were the case there would be no place for reward and punishment, which is founded upon the principle of man&#x2019;s freedom of choice between good and evil. Rather, the import of his words is to state that man will then be so motivated for good that he will naturally be doing the good and proper according to the Will of G-d, and it will appear as if the instinct for evil has been completely eliminated from him, although potentially it will still be with him. The case is similar to what we say now of a normal knowledgeable person that it is &#x201C;impossible&#x201D; for him to jump into a blazing fire. Of course, it is within his powers to do so, but it is his knowledge of the danger entailed that makes it &#x201C;impossible&#x201D; for him to do so. In the Messianic era man will have that kind of reaction to all things prohibited by G-d. There will, therefore, still be place for reward and punishment, since potentially man will still have his freedom of choice. See my Hebrew commentary, Vol. I, p. 36-37, where I quote this thought in the name of Rabbi Yeruchum, one of the great leaders of the Musar movement.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Vayeilech</title>
<h1>31</h1>
<p>1. AND MOSES WENT. When Moses concluded his words, all who stood before him, and the young children, and the women returned to their own tents. It was not necessary for Scripture to mention this [that they returned to their tents], for it already stated, <italic>Ye are standing this day all of you before the Eternal your G-d;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2354">1</xref></sup> <italic>that thou shouldest enter into the covenant of the Eternal thy G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2355">2</xref></sup> and [it is self-understood that] after having entered the covenant they would go away from him [Moses]. And so Scripture now states that Moses went from the camp of the Levites to the camp of the Israelites in order to show them honor, like someone who wishes to take leave of his friend and comes to ask permission of him.</p>
<p>2. AND HE SAID UNTO THEM: &#x2018;I AM A HUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS OLD THIS DAY.&#x2019; This was to comfort them concerning his condition [i.e., about his approaching death], as if to say, &#x201C;I am old and you have no more benefit from me. Moreover, G-d has commanded me that I should not go over there. Do not dread and do not be fearful, for the Eternal will go over with you; He will not remove His Presence from you on my account [i.e., because of my absence], <italic>and Joshua, he shall go over before</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2356">3</xref></sup> you in my place.&#x201D; Now, although Moses our teacher retained his vigor and health, as Scripture testifies, <italic>his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2357">4</xref></sup> he told them this [&#x201C;I am old and you have no more benefit of me&#x201D;] in order to comfort them [over the transfer of leadership to Joshua].</p>
<p>Now, Rashi wrote: &#x201C;<italic>I can no longer go out and go in</italic>, because <italic>the Eternal hath said unto me: Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.</italic>&#x201D; But it is not correct.<sup><xref rid="fn2358">5</xref></sup> And in the opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra the expression <italic>I can no longer go out and come in</italic> means to war, because his powers weakened in his old age. This too, is not correct.<sup><xref rid="fn2359">6</xref></sup> And our Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn2360">7</xref></sup> &#x201C;This teaches us that the well-springs of wisdom were stopped for him.&#x201D; This was a miraculous event in order that Moses should not be troubled [about the transfer of leadership to Joshua] and [G-d] bestowing honor upon Joshua in his [Moses&#x2019;] presence.<sup><xref rid="fn2361">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. AND MOSES WROTE THIS LAW &#x2014; from the beginning of <italic>Bereshith</italic> to <italic>in the sight of all Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2362">9</xref></sup> Even though it is written here, <italic>thou shalt read this law before all Israel</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2363">10</xref></sup> and according to the opinion of our Rabbis,<sup><xref rid="fn2364">11</xref></sup> it refers to this Book of Deuteronomy,<sup><xref rid="fn2364">11</xref></sup> at this point, he reverted and explained, <italic>And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this Law in a book, until they were finished</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2365">12</xref></sup> This includes the entire Torah. [Hence the expression <italic>this Law</italic> in the verse before us means the entire Torah, while in the following Verse 11, concerning the reading in the Assembly, the same expression refers only to the Book of Deuteronomy.]</p>
<p>12. THAT THEY MAY HEAR, AND THAT THEY MAY LEARN &#x2014; that is, <italic>the men and the women</italic> [mentioned in the first part of the verse], for the women, too, heard and learned to fear the Eternal.</p>
<p>13. AND THAT THEIR CHILDREN, WHO HAVE NOT KNOWN, MAY HEAR, AND LEARN TO FEAR. This refers to <italic>the little children</italic> [mentioned in the preceding verse], for they will hear and inquire, and the fathers will accustom them [to the words of the Law] and educate them. For <italic>the little children</italic> [mentioned here] are not those who suckle at the breasts, but rather the young in years who are nearly old enough to be educated, this being the sense of the expression <italic>and learn to fear</italic> &#x2014; in the future [when they are grown up]. But above [when speaking of <italic>the men and the women</italic>] he stated, <italic>that they may learn, and fear</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2366">13</xref></sup> [now, since they are adults]. However, our Rabbis have said,<sup><xref rid="fn2367">14</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>The men</italic> came to learn, <italic>and the women</italic> to listen. <italic>And the little children</italic> &#x2014; why did they come? In order to reward those who bring them.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2368">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. THAT I MAY GIVE HIM [Joshua] A CHARGE. &#x201C;This means that I may exhort him.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. But there is no need for this, because G-d&#x2019;s statement [to Joshua] <italic>for thou shalt bring</italic> [<italic>the children of Israel into the Land</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn2369">16</xref></sup> is a command, and, if he were to be indolent and not do so, he would be liable to the death-penalty. It is possible that the meaning of <italic>that I may give him a charge</italic> is that I will appoint him <italic>a prince and commander</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2370">17</xref></sup> over Israel, <italic>and thou shalt give him a charge in their sight</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2371">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. AND THE ETERNAL APPEARED IN THE TENT IN A PILLAR OF CLOUD. The purport thereof is that the pillar of cloud was over the entrance [of the Tent] and G-d appeared in the Tent &#x2014; this being the Glory, according to Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra. In my opinion, this verse is like <italic>And the Eternal came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the Tent;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2372">19</xref></sup> <italic>and, behold, the Glory of the Eternal appeared in the cloud</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2373">20</xref></sup> And the meaning [of the verse here] is that He wanted to speak with Moses so that Joshua would hear, and He would also charge Joshua there. Now, to Moses it was said, <italic>And there I will meet with thee, and I will speak with thee from above the ark-cover</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2374">21</xref></sup> but Joshua was not of that exalted status [in prophecy] and he was forbidden to enter the Tent altogether. Thus the phrase, <italic>and the pillar of cloud stood over the entrance of the Tent</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2375">22</xref></sup> reverts to explain that the cloud, in which was the Glory, was above the door of the Tent covering it, and accordingly He was in the Tent [as the verse states, <italic>And the Eternal appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud</italic>].</p>
<p>16. THE GODS OF &#x2018;NEICHAR&#x2019; OF THE LAND &#x2014; &#x201C;the gods of the [foreign] peoples of the Land.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. But it is not correct.<sup><xref rid="fn2376">23</xref></sup> Rather, it means &#x201C;the gods that are foreign to this Land,&#x201D; for <italic>the Glorious Name</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2377">24</xref></sup> is called the G-d of the Land, similar to what is stated, <italic>because they know not the manner of the G-d of the Land</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2378">25</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>And they spoke of the G-d of Jerusalem, as concerning the gods of the peoples of the earth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2379">26</xref></sup> and it is further written, <italic>They shall not dwell in the Eternal&#x2019;s Land</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2380">27</xref></sup> Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra mentioned this [here], and I have already explained it.<sup><xref rid="fn2381">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHITHER HE GOETH TO BE &#x2018;B&#x2019;KIRBO&#x2019; (AMONG THEM). This means &#x201C;whither he [the foreign god] goes to be among His people and His servants.&#x201D; Or <italic>b&#x2019;kirbo</italic> may mean &#x201C;in the midst of the Land,&#x201D; as in the expressions: <italic>and the land was not able to bear them;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2382">29</xref></sup> <italic>the land burnt up</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2383">30</xref></sup> in accordance with the words of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra.</p>
<p>17. AND THEY WILL SAY IN THAT DAY: ARE NOT THESE EVILS COME UPON US BECAUSE OUR G-D IS NOT AMONG US? This is not a total confession like [the confession in the verse] <italic>And they shall confess their iniquity</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2384">31</xref></sup> but it is a reflection and a regret. They will feel sorry for their iniquity and recognize that they are guilty.</p>
<p>18. AND I WILL SURELY HIDE MY FACE IN THAT DAY. The meaning thereof is that [He will hide His face] on a different occasion [for it was already stated in Verse 17, <italic>and I will hide My face from them</italic>]. Since the Israelites already reflected in their hearts that they sinned against G-d, and that these evils came upon them because their G-d was not among them, it would have been fitting &#x2014; according to the exceeding mercies of G-d &#x2014; that He help them and rescue them because they had already denied the idols. This is similar to what is stated, <italic>Behold, I will enter into judgment with thee, because thou sayest: &#x2018;I have not sinned,&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2385">32</xref></sup> [indicating that the very denial of wrongdoing is a grievous sin, but here the admission of sin should have caused G-d to help them]. Therefore he [Moses] states that, because of the great evil that they did in trusting idols, He will again hide His face from them &#x2014; not like the first hiding of His face when He hid the face of His mercies <italic>and many evils and troubles came upon</italic> them<sup><xref rid="fn2386">33</xref></sup> &#x2014; but that only the face of redemption will be hidden and they will abide by the promise of the face of His mercies. [This is the promise of] <italic>And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2387">34</xref></sup> [They will not be shown the face of redemption] until they add to the aforementioned regret real confession and perfect repentance, as is stated above, <italic>and thou shalt return unto the Eternal thy G-d</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2388">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. AND NOW WRITE YE THIS SONG. In line with the plain meaning of Scripture, He commands both Moses and Joshua to write it for He wanted to make Joshua His prophet during Moses&#x2019; lifetime. Now, Moses wrote it while Joshua stood by him, read it, and saw [it completed], this being the sense of the verse, <italic>So Moses wrote this Song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2389">36</xref></sup> It refers to Moses who was the principal [in the writing of the Song] for it was from him that they would hear it and learn it, although Joshua, too, taught it with him, as it is stated at the conclusion [of the chapter] <italic>he</italic> [i.e., Moses], <italic>and Hoshea, the son of Nun</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2390">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now, the meaning of the expression <italic>this Song</italic> is &#x201C;the Song that I will now tell you,&#x201D; this being <italic>&#x2018;Ha&#x2019;azinu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>Give ear</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2391">38</xref></sup> It is called <italic>Song</italic> because Israel would recite it with song and psalm.<sup><xref rid="fn2392">39</xref></sup> It was also written [in the Torah] in the style of a song, since songs are written with interruptions [empty spaces] indicating the places of chanting.</p>
<p>21. FOR I KNOW THEIR INCLINATION WHICH THEY HAVE SHOWN THIS DAY. The meaning thereof is like the expression, <italic>for now I know that thou art a G-d-fearing man</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2393">40</xref></sup> which is knowledge become actualized, for knowledge of the future is knowledge in potential.<sup><xref rid="fn2394">41</xref></sup> Now, if Israel had not sinned in the wilderness and the recognition of his temperament had not been actualized, it would have been inappropriate for him to testify against them in the Song, saying that it is known to Him that you will sin and therefore I call [heaven and earth] to witness that <italic>many evils and troubles</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2386">33</xref></sup> like such and such will come upon you. Instead it would have been proper that He give them the Torah with unspecified foreknowledge: <italic>If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the Land; but if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2395">42</xref></sup> But now, that their bad temperament and <italic>their straying heart</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2396">43</xref></sup> had become known to them as well, He told them all that would occur to them. This is similar to what is said, <italic>Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew</italic> etc., <italic>therefore I have declared to thee from of old; before it came to pass I announced it to thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2397">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. AND HE COMMANDED JOSHUA THE SON OF NUN. &#x201C;This [pronoun &#x2018;He&#x2019;] refers to the Divine Presence [mentioned] above<sup><xref rid="fn2398">45</xref></sup> as it is explained [here], <italic>into the Land which I swore unto them; and I will be with thee</italic>.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. He has explained it well. And in the opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra:<sup><xref rid="fn2399">46</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And he commanded Joshua</italic> &#x2014; that is, Moses [commanded] by order of G-d, and therefore he said, <italic>into the Land which I swore unto them</italic>.&#x201D; Similarly we find that Moses said, <italic>And I will give the rain of your Land in its season</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2400">47</xref></sup> So also, <italic>And I will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2401">48</xref></sup> Likewise, <italic>that ye might know that I am the Eternal your G-d</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2402">49</xref></sup> And so also, <italic>The Eternal will send upon thee the scantiness</italic> etc. <italic>because of the evil doings, whereby thou hast forsaken Me</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2403">50</xref></sup> I have already discussed this.<sup><xref rid="fn2404">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. AND IT CAME TO PASS, WHEN MOSES HAD FINISHED WRITING [THE WORDS OF THIS LAW]. The meaning thereof is that, at first, he wrote the Law <italic>and delivered it unto the priests</italic> as is stated above,<sup><xref rid="fn2405">52</xref></sup> but he did not tell them where they were to put it. Afterwards he was commanded concerning this Song &#x2014; he wrote it <italic>and taught it the children of Israel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2406">53</xref></sup> that same day, and thus added it to the Law. <italic>And it came to pass, when Moses had finished writing</italic> everything in the Book of the Law, then he commanded the priests, <italic>Take this Book of the Law, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of the Eternal your G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2407">54</xref></sup> meaning that it should remain in the ark at the side [of the Tablets], for henceforth they would not even touch it to add [thereto] or to diminish [from it]. This is the sense of the verse, <italic>And it came to pass, when Moses had finished writing</italic> [<italic>the words of this Law in a book</italic>] <italic>until they were completed</italic>. Therefore Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented that [<italic>Seder</italic>] <italic>V&#x2019;zoth Habrachah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2408">55</xref></sup> was [written] earlier, and its proper place is above as it is stated <italic>And Moses went and spoke these words unto all Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2409">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is possible that after he wrote the Song <italic>and taught it the children of Israel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2406">53</xref></sup> one by one according to their tribes as he had them brought before him to the House of Learning, he wrote it in the Book of the Law and commanded the priests <italic>Take this Book of the Law</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2407">54</xref></sup> meaning that the Song too, should remain in the ark with the Law, for it is part of the Law since it is there as a testimony. Then Moses told them to assemble before him again &#x2014; all the elders of the tribes and the officers<sup><xref rid="fn2410">57</xref></sup> &#x2014; and that the people should join them, for so it is stated at the end, <italic>And Moses came and spoke all the words of this Song in the ears of the people</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2411">58</xref></sup> Now the priests did so and they assembled the entire people before him and he called heaven and earth to witness against them in assembly<sup><xref rid="fn2412">59</xref></sup> in the hearing of the priests and all the people. Then G-d, blessed be He, told him <italic>Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2413">60</xref></sup> This he was bound to do immediately, and so he stood up and blessed them: <italic>&#x2018;V&#x2019;zoth Habrachah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>And this is the blessing</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2414">61</xref></sup> He then wrote it at the end of the book which he gave to the priests. Then the priests did as he commanded them &#x2014; they placed the complete book by the side of the ark of the covenant.<sup><xref rid="fn2415">62</xref></sup> Thus everything took place in the order stated in the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn2416">63</xref></sup></p>

<chapter>
<title>Ha&#x2019;azinu</title>
<h1>32</h1>
<p>1. GIVE EAR, YE HEAVENS. By way of the plain meaning of Scripture, the words of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra are correct that the Scriptures designate as witnesses all things which exist and endure. Similarly, <italic>Hear O ye mountains, the Eternal&#x2019;s controversy</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2417">1</xref></sup> So also with reference to the stone that Joshua set up [after he made the covenant with the people], for there it is written, <italic>for it hath heard</italic> [<italic>all the words of the Eternal which He spoke unto us</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn2418">2</xref></sup> And by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], the reference here is to the first [higher] heavens and earth mentioned in Genesis, for it is they that shall enter the covenant with Israel. Therefore, he states that the heavens should give ear and listen to the conditions, and how he will apply them. He states <italic>My doctrine shall drop as the rain</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2419">3</xref></sup> for that which he took from the heavens [i.e., the Written Torah]<sup><xref rid="fn2420">4</xref></sup> and His commandment upon the earth [i.e., the Oral Torah]<sup><xref rid="fn2420">4</xref></sup> shall drop upon Israel and distill upon them like dew. <italic>When I shall call the name of the Eternal</italic> in the heavens <italic>ascribe ye greatness to our G-d</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2421">5</xref></sup> on earth &#x2014; and he is speaking to all Israel [for it is they who are on earth]. Similarly, the &#x201C;stone&#x201D; of Joshua<sup><xref rid="fn2418">2</xref></sup> alludes to this earth, for <italic>from thence is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2422">6</xref></sup> I have already explained it.<sup><xref rid="fn2422">6</xref></sup> So also, <italic>The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief corner-stone. This is the Eternal&#x2019;s doing</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2423">7</xref></sup> Therefore, Joshua said, <italic>Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2418">2</xref></sup> And so also, <italic>For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone are seven facets</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2424">8</xref></sup> The student learned in the mysteries of the Cabala will understand.</p>
<p>4. THE ROCK, HIS WORK IS PERFECT. This is an allusion to the attribute of justice. He states <italic>His work is perfect</italic> for whatever act emanates from Him is perfect and complete, eternally immovable and unchangeable. <italic>For all His ways are justice</italic>. They are [indeed] the merciful<sup><xref rid="fn2425">9</xref></sup> ways, and there is no deficiency in [His] work; [rather, His work is performed] <italic>but in a just measure</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2426">10</xref></sup> For justice belongs to the <italic>G-d of faithfulness and there is no injustice</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2427">11</xref></sup> in the Rock. Thus the justice [dispensed] is righteous and the Rock is upright.</p>
<p>5. THE CORRUPTION WAS TOWARDS HIM; THEY ARE NOT HIS CHILDREN [BECAUSE OF] THEIR BLEMISH. The blemish is called &#x201C;corruption,&#x201D; as it is said, <italic>their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2428">12</xref></sup> and similarly, <italic>and he sacrificeth unto the Eternal &#x2018;a corrupted&#x2019; thing</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2429">13</xref></sup> [which means &#x201C;a blemished&#x201D; thing]. He [Moses] thus states that the blemish of Israel is the corruption towards the Rock of His people and His inheritance, and [therefore] he calls them <italic>not His children</italic>, just as, <italic>in an acceptable time</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2430">14</xref></sup> [a time when they conduct themselves properly] he calls them &#x201C;His children.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2431">15</xref></sup> He states that they are <italic>a generation crooked and perverse</italic>, for crookedness is the opposite of uprightness, similar to what is said, <italic>and they make crooked all equity</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2432">16</xref></sup> and the perverse is the opposite of the righteous. Consequently, since <italic>He is just and right</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2433">17</xref></sup> and they are the opposite of that, they are not [considered] His children; rather, they are considered by Him to be corrupted. And the sequence of the verse is thus: &#x201C;their corruption towards Him &#x2014; which is their blemish &#x2014; has caused them not to be considered His children, [for they are] <italic>a generation crooked and perverse</italic>.&#x201D; The sense thereof is that the dimunition of their status did not result from the deed of the Rock, for He is perfect and there can never be imperfection in Him, but it is their blemish that corrupts them before their Father. And the meaning of the expression <italic>not His children</italic> is like <italic>And I will say to them that were not My people: &#x2018;Thou art My people.&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2434">18</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>They have aroused Me to jealousy with a no-god</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2435">19</xref></sup> meaning, with something that is not a god. So also, <italic>and they have sworn by no-gods</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2436">20</xref></sup> Or it may be that the verse here states: &#x201C;The corruption towards Him is their blemish, that they are not His children, for they are <italic>a generation crooked and perverse</italic>, the opposite of Him.&#x201D;</p>
<p>6. &#x2018;AM NAVAL&#x2019; (A FOOLISH PEOPLE), AND NOT WISE. &#x201C;<italic>A foolish people</italic> &#x2014; that has forgotten [all] the good that He has done for them. <italic>And not wise</italic> to understand the result [of their actions], that it is in His power to do them good or evil.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. Now, Onkelos rendered [<italic>am naval</italic>]: &#x201C;a people that has received the Torah, [and who are not wise],&#x201D; deriving it from [the expression] <italic>navol tibol</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2437">21</xref></sup> which he translated <italic>milah thilei</italic> (&#x201C;thou wilt surely become weary&#x201D;). Thus the verse here states: &#x201C;it is a people weary of the observance of the Torah and they are not wise [enough to realize] that it is for their eternal good.&#x201D; Similarly Onkelos rendered <italic>b&#x2019;goi naval</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2438">22</xref></sup> &#x2014; &#x201C;with a foolish people,&#x201D; apathetic in becoming wise or people of faith. And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra interpreted: &#x201C;<italic>Naval</italic> (<italic>foolish</italic>) in deeds, <italic>and not wise</italic> in heart.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In my opinion he who performs an unrequired act [of goodness or kindness] is called <italic>nadiv</italic> (generous), while he who repays his benefactor with evil is called <italic>naval</italic> (a vile person). And so it is stated, <italic>&#x2018;L&#x2019;naval&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the vile person</italic>) <italic>will no longer be called &#x2018;nadiv&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>generous</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn2439">23</xref></sup> for one is the opposite of the other. Therefore it was said of Nabal the Carmelite, <italic>for as his name is, so is he: Nabal is his name, and &#x2018;n&#x2019;valah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>vileness</italic>) <italic>is with him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2440">24</xref></sup> For David did him a great favor &#x2014; he guarded all his belongings &#x2014; and he [Nabal] did not want to pay him any recompense; instead, he shouted at his [David&#x2019;s] messengers<sup><xref rid="fn2441">25</xref></sup> and disgraced them. And this is the sense of the verse concerning [G-d&#x2019;s words to] the friends of Job: [<italic>And my servant Job shall pray for you; for him alone will I receive favorably,</italic>] <italic>so as not to do unto you &#x2018;n&#x2019;valah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>an unseemly act</italic>) [<italic>because you have not spoken of Me properly, as My servant Job hath;</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn2442">26</xref></sup> since they had defended the deed of <italic>the glorious and fearful Name</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2443">27</xref></sup> saying it was done justly, and if He were to punish them now, it would appear as <italic>n&#x2019;valah</italic> (an unseemly act).<sup><xref rid="fn2442">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is possible that the term <italic>naval</italic> is used [for a vile person] because he is an inferior type of a human being, just as the expression <italic>as an oak whose leaf &#x2018;noveleth&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2444">28</xref></sup> which means &#x201C;falls&#x201D; [because it withered. Thus, the word <italic>noveleth</italic> (withers), spelled with a <italic>beth</italic>, is related to <italic>nofeleth</italic> (falls) spelled with a <italic>fei</italic>. Similarly, a person who is <italic>nofel</italic>, &#x201C;falls&#x201D; short of acceptable standards of conduct, is referred to as <italic>naval</italic>.] A dead animal is called <italic>n&#x2019;veilah</italic> because &#x201C;it falls&#x201D; upon the earth and dies, just as it is said, <italic>to see the &#x2018;mapeleth&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>carcass</italic>) <italic>of the lion</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2445">29</xref></sup> If so, Scripture states here: &#x201C;Do you thus requite G-d for all the good He has done for you? It is an <italic>am naval</italic> that repays evil for good, <italic>and unwise</italic> not to know that <italic>they have wrought this evil unto themselves</italic>,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2446">30</xref></sup> and not to G-d. It is similar to what is stated, <italic>If thou hast sinned, what doest thou against Him? And if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto Him? If thou be righteous, what givest thou Him? or what receiveth He of thy hand?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2447">31</xref></sup> For G-d <italic>is thy Father</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2448">32</xref></sup> Who brought you forth and raised you; <italic>and He is &#x2018;konecha,&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2448">32</xref></sup> Who made you a <italic>kinyan</italic> (a possession), for He brought you forth from nothingness and you became a being, and every tangible reality can be acquired as a possession. [Therefore, the word <italic>koneh</italic> is used interchangeably to mean &#x201C;make&#x201D; or &#x201C;create&#x201D; and &#x201C;acquire&#x201D; as shown in the following examples.] It is similar to what is said, <italic>The Eternal &#x2018;kanani&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>made</italic>) <italic>me as the beginning of His way;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2449">33</xref></sup> likewise, <italic>&#x2018;Koneih&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>Maker</italic>) <italic>of heaven and earth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2450">34</xref></sup> as I have explained.<sup><xref rid="fn2451">35</xref></sup> And He created you, <italic>made thee, and established thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2448">32</xref></sup> similar to the expression, <italic>and One fashioned us in the womb</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2452">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. ASK THY FATHER &#x2014; &#x201C;this alludes to those who understand [the events of former days], and so <italic>thine elders</italic> [<italic>and they will tell thee</italic> &#x2014; for they too, understand the past]. The purport thereof is, as he stated, <italic>which the Eternal thy G-d hath allotted them</italic> etc.,<sup><xref rid="fn2453">37</xref></sup> since for each portion below, [i.e., each nation on earth] there is a [counterpart] portion on high. And the meaning of the expression [<italic>He set the borders of the peoples</italic>] <italic>according to the number of the children of Israel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2454">38</xref></sup> is that the image of Jacob is inscribed in the Throne of Glory, this being a great secret. And the proof for this is <italic>For the portion of the Eternal is His people</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2455">39</xref></sup> this being a great distinction which <italic>He hath not dealt so with any nation</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2456">40</xref></sup> Therefore, he said, <italic>Do ye thus requite the Eternal, O foolish people and unwise?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2457">41</xref></sup> &#x2014; a people that has fallen from its distinction because of its foolishness. And the meaning of the expression <italic>thy Father that hath gotten thee</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2457">41</xref></sup> is, that He created you for His honor and taught you, as he explains, as a father does for his son.&#x201D; Thus far is the language of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra. <italic>The words of a wise man&#x2019;s mouth are gracious</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2458">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>If so, the meaning of <italic>Remember the days of old</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2459">43</xref></sup> is that they apply their hearts to remember the six days of Creation, the good He did them at the time of the formation [of the nations], as he goes on to say <italic>When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2454">38</xref></sup> <italic>Consider the years of many generations</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2459">43</xref></sup> &#x2014; that they contemplate in order to know what was done for them during the generations since the Divine Presence dwelled among them, as he proceeds to tell: <italic>He found him in a desert land</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2460">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now, Rashi commented: &#x201C;<italic>He found him in a desert land</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2460">44</xref></sup> He found them [the people of Israel] to be faithful to Him in the desert land when they accepted upon themselves His Torah, His Sovereignty, and His yoke &#x2014; something that the children of Esau and Ishmael did not do. <italic>And in the waste, a howling wilderness</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2460">44</xref></sup> &#x2014; a land of drought and desolation, a place of the jackals&#x2019; and ostriches&#x2019; cry. Even there they continued their faith [in Him] and did not say to Moses, &#x2018;How can we go out into the wilderness?&#x2019; &#x201D; But this is not the purport of the chapter, for Scripture [here] reproves Israel, mentioning the favors which G-d did for them &#x2014; and they requited them [the favors] with evil instead of good.</p>
<p>The expression [<italic>He kept him</italic>] <italic>as the apple of His eye</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2460">44</xref></sup> alludes to watchfulness, the verse stating that G-d watched over him as He would shield &#x201C;His own eye.&#x201D; Or it may be that the word &#x201C;man&#x201D; is missing here: He watched over him as a man shields the apple of his eye, for generally [where there is no specific reference to the contrary, it is assumed that] Scripture speaks of man. There are many similar verses.</p>
<p>12. THE ETERNAL ALONE DID LEAD HIM &#x2014; G-d dwells in Israel securely alone;<sup><xref rid="fn2461">45</xref></sup> AND THERE WAS NOT WITH HIM &#x2014; the pronoun referring either to G-d or Israel &#x2014; ANY STRANGE GOD. The purport is that Israel has no prince or ruler of all the <italic>bnei ha&#x2019;elohim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2462">46</xref></sup> that guides the nation or assists in its guidance except for G-d alone, for it [Israel] is His portion and His inheritance, as he mentioned.<sup><xref rid="fn2455">39</xref></sup> I have already written on this subject.<sup><xref rid="fn2463">47</xref></sup> And in the Sifre we find:<sup><xref rid="fn2464">48</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>The Eternal alone did lead him</italic>. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel: Just as you dwelled alone in this world and derived no benefit from the nations, so will I place you alone in the World to Come and none of the nations will benefit from you at all. <italic>And there was not with him any strange god</italic> &#x2014; none of the princes of the nations of the world will have the right to come and dominate you. This is similar to what is said, <italic>and when I go forth, lo, the prince of Greece shall come;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2465">49</xref></sup> <italic>but the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2466">50</xref></sup> <italic>nevertheless I will declare unto thee that which is inscribed in the writing of truth</italic> etc.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2467">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. &#x2018;VAYENABEIL&#x2019; THE ROCK OF HIS SALVATION &#x2014; &#x201C;he showed contempt for Him and disregarded Him, just as it is said, <italic>with their backs towards the Temple of the Eternal, and their faces toward the east</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2468">52</xref></sup> There is no greater contempt than this.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented: &#x201C;<italic>Vayenabeil</italic> &#x2014; that he caused &#x2018;the profaning&#x2019; of G-d&#x2019;s Name so that He would no longer help him.&#x201D; This interpretation, too, does not appear to me to be correct, for it is not within the context of this place [i.e., this section of the Song], for he is still narrating [here] their sins, and will not state their punishment and vengeance that He would inflict upon them until [further on in the verse], <italic>And He said: &#x2018;I will hide My face from them.&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2469">53</xref></sup> The correct interpretation appears to me to be what I have mentioned above,<sup><xref rid="fn2470">54</xref></sup> that the term <italic>n&#x2019;valah</italic> is used to describe repaying evil for good. The verse thus states that the people of Israel abandoned the G-d Who created them in favor of strange gods and, in utterance and thought, showed disregard for the Rock Who helped them. [Israel] said &#x201C;In return for serving Him, there is nothing but repayment of evil. By worshipping the strange gods <italic>he shall have plenty of bread;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2471">55</xref></sup> but when worshipping the Rock they will be <italic>contemptible and base before all the people</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2472">56</xref></sup> As our fools said, <italic>It is vain to serve G-d; and what profit is it that we have kept His charge, and that we have walked mournfully because of the Eternal of hosts? And now we call the proud happy</italic> etc.,<sup><xref rid="fn2473">57</xref></sup> and as the accursed women said [to Jeremiah], <italic>But since we let off to offer to the queen of heaven</italic> etc., <italic>we have wanted all things</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2474">58</xref></sup> Similarly [the prophet Jeremiah prayed], <italic>Do not abhor us, for Thy Name&#x2019;s sake, do not dishonor the throne of Thy glory</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2475">59</xref></sup> because they will say of Him that He repays His people with evil for good, just as [the prophet] said, <italic>Break not Thy covenant with us</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2475">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. WITH ABOMINATIONS DID THEY PROVOKE HIM &#x2014; &#x201C;they kindled His anger with abominations and unseemly deeds, such as sodomy and sorcery in which there is abomination.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language, and it is also so stated in the Sifre.<sup><xref rid="fn2476">60</xref></sup> But in this Song there is reproof for idolatry only [and not for immorality]&#x0021; And the word <italic>&#x2018;b&#x2019;zarim&#x2019;</italic> [<italic>They roused Him to jealousy &#x2018;b&#x2019;zarim&#x2019;</italic>] is connected with the expression <italic>G-d Who made him</italic> [in the preceding verse, to mean]: &#x201C;<italic>they roused Him to jealousy with &#x2018;strange</italic> gods,&#x2019; &#x201D; similar to the phrase <italic>other gods</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2477">61</xref></sup> And the meaning of the expression, <italic>with abominations</italic> is [that they worshipped] the demons by burning their children in fire to other gods. For all this is &#x201C;abominable&#x201D; to Him, just as it is said, <italic>for every abomination to the Eternal, which He hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the fire to their gods</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2478">62</xref></sup> and it is further written, <italic>which I commanded not, nor spoke it, neither came it unto My mind</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2479">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. THEY SACRIFICED UNTO THE DEMONS, NO-GODS. I have [already] explained this.<sup><xref rid="fn2480">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. [AND THE ETERNAL SAW, AND SPURNED,] BECAUSE OF THE PROVOKING OF HIS SONS AND HIS DAUGHTERS. Scripture uncustomarily mentions here &#x201C;the daughters&#x201D; &#x2014; for just as he said above <italic>lo banav</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2481">65</xref></sup> [which although literally means &#x201C;not His sons,&#x201D; it is yet the custom of Scripture to use it for sons and daughters, rather than specify daughters separately], and so also wherever he mentions <italic>banim</italic> (sons) the daughters are included. [Why then does the verse before us make special reference to <italic>His daughters</italic>?] But this phrase is among his [Moses&#x2019;] allusions, for, in the generation of the destruction [of the First Temple], the wickedness of the women and their sin would be very great because they provoked G-d. They were especially attached to the idols, and it was they who enticed the men to worship them, as is made clear in the words of Jeremiah, <italic>Then all the men who knew that their wives offered unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great assembly</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2482">66</xref></sup> It was they [the women] who were impudent against the prophet, saying to him, <italic>But we will certainly perform every word that is gone forth out of our mouth, to offer unto the queen of heaven</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2483">67</xref></sup> And it is further written there, <italic>in that ye provoke Me with the works of your hands, offering unto other gods</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2484">68</xref></sup> and again it is stated, <italic>Have ye forgotten the wicked deeds of your fathers, and the wicked deeds of the kings of Judah, and the wicked deeds of their wives?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2485">69</xref></sup> And in the Book of Ezekiel it is further stated, <italic>He said also unto me: &#x2018;Thou shalt again see yet greater abominations which they do.&#x2019; Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the Eternal&#x2019;s House, which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat the women weeping for Tammuz</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2486">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. AND HE SAID &#x2014; &#x201C;that is, and G-d said in His heart, or to the angels. I WILL HIDE MY FACE FROM THEM. This expression is according to the language of man; so also, <italic>I will hide Mine eyes from you</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2487">71</xref></sup> And the meaning thereof is that when they will seek Me they will not find Me. I WILL SEE WHAT THEIR END SHALL BE. Some scholars say: &#x2018;I will hide My face from them because I see what they will do in the end.&#x2019; But the correct interpretation is as its simple implication: &#x2018;[I will hide My face] until I will see what they do in their distress.&#x2019; &#x201D; Thus far are the words of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra. Now the word <italic>vayomer</italic> (and He said) applies only to the thought and the will before Him to do so, [rather than to an actual statement], similar to the expression <italic>and G-d said</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2488">72</xref></sup> in the account of Creation. I have already explained it.<sup><xref rid="fn2489">73</xref></sup> I have also explained the expression <italic>My face</italic> by way of the Truth.<sup><xref rid="fn2490">74</xref></sup> Thus, <italic>I will hide My face</italic> means that I will remove My Divine Presence. <italic>I will see what their end shall be</italic> is similar to <italic>I will go down now, and see</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2491">75</xref></sup> which I have already explained.<sup><xref rid="fn2492">76</xref></sup> <italic>For they are a generation of perversity</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2493">77</xref></sup> and they will not be able to stand up before Me. <italic>Children in whom is no &#x2018;eimun&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>training</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn2493">77</xref></sup> for they have no nurse nor tutor. The person learned in the mysteries of the Cabala will understand.<sup><xref rid="fn2494">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now, up to this point Moses utters the Song and speaks in the first person. From this verse onward, wherein he mentioned, <italic>And the Eternal saw, and spurned</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2495">79</xref></sup> <italic>And He said: &#x2018;I will hide My face&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2493">77</xref></sup> &#x2014; they are all the words of <italic>the Glorious Name:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2496">80</xref></sup> <italic>They have roused Me to jealousy;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2497">81</xref></sup> <italic>they have provoked Me</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2497">81</xref></sup> and similarly the entire Song [to the end].</p>
<p>21. THEY HAVE ROUSED ME TO JEALOUSY WITH A NO-GOD &#x2014; &#x201C;with something that is not a god.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. And if so, He alludes to the demons mentioned earlier.<sup><xref rid="fn2483">67</xref></sup> The correct interpretation is that He is stating: &#x201C;They have roused Me to jealousy with an untrue god, for there is no G-d save the Eternal,<sup><xref rid="fn2498">82</xref></sup> <italic>and beside</italic> Him <italic>there is no savior</italic>,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2499">83</xref></sup> similar to what is stated, <italic>Now for long seasons Israel was without the true G-d</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2500">84</xref></sup></p>
<p>THEY HAVE PROVOKED ME WITH THEIR VANITIES &#x2014; [their vain belief in] the demons. AND I WILL ROUSE THEM TO JEALOUSY WITH A NO-PEOPLE &#x2014; the Chaldeans, of whom it is said, <italic>Behold, the land of the Chaldeans, this is the people that was not</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2501">85</xref></sup> meaning the people that were not esteemed as a nation, and the Holy One, blessed be He, raised them to subjugate His world through them, as He said, <italic>Thou art My maul and weapons of war</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2502">86</xref></sup> I WILL PROVOKE THEM WITH A &#x2018;NAVAL&#x2019; (VILE) NATION &#x2014; with Esau who is vile, <italic>and</italic> he <italic>remembered not the brotherly covenant</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2503">87</xref></sup> He thus alludes to both exiles [by the hands of the Chaldeans, i.e., the Babylonians; and by the Edomites, the Romans].</p>
<p>26. [&#x2018;AMARTI&#x2019; (I SAID)] &#x2018;APHEIHEM.&#x2019; Grammarians<sup><xref rid="fn2504">88</xref></sup> explained it as meaning: &#x201C;I will disperse them into every &#x2018;corner.&#x2019; &#x201D; And if so, the word <italic>amarti</italic> means that it was the Will before Him by the attribute of justice that they be so scattered forever in every corner, and that <italic>their memory cease</italic> forever <italic>from among men</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2505">89</xref></sup> &#x2014; <italic>were it not that I was in dread of the wrath from the enemy</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2506">90</xref></sup> And in my opinion the word <italic>apheihem</italic> is a composite word, as is mentioned in the Sifre,<sup><xref rid="fn2507">91</xref></sup> that it consists of these three words: <italic>aph ei heim</italic> [&#x201C;I said in My &#x2018;anger&#x2019; that I will banish them so that it will be said of them &#x2018;where are they?&#x2019; &#x201D;]. The meaning thereof is that I will put them in such a place and in such a manner that it will also be said of them &#x201C;Where are they?&#x201D; signifying that there will be no name or remnant left of them among the nations, <italic>and their place</italic> will <italic>not</italic> be <italic>known where they are</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2508">92</xref></sup> He thus alludes to the exile of the ten tribes that were banished to the river Gozan,<sup><xref rid="fn2509">93</xref></sup> this being the river which the Sages call &#x201C;Sabbatyon.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2510">94</xref></sup> The name &#x201C;Gozan&#x201D; is of the expressions: <italic>&#x2018;vayagaz&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and it brought over</italic>) <italic>quails from the sea;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2511">95</xref></sup> <italic>Thou art &#x2018;gozi&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>He that took me out</italic>) <italic>of my mother&#x2019;s womb</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2512">96</xref></sup> because those who remain behind [that river] are &#x201C;divested&#x201D; of any contacts with other people. It is called &#x201C;Sabbatyon&#x201D; because of its rest on the Sabbath-day, for the Sabbath-day in that language, as in Arabic, is called <italic>Sabbat</italic>, and they add adjectivial suffixes of <italic>&#x2018;yon&#x2019;</italic> to certain nouns, such as: <italic>eizoviyon</italic> (Greek hyssop),<sup><xref rid="fn2513">97</xref></sup> <italic>churyon</italic> (another),<sup><xref rid="fn2514">98</xref></sup> <italic>mulyon</italic> (a mule),<sup><xref rid="fn2515">99</xref></sup> and many others.</p>
<p>I WOULD MAKE THEIR MEMORY CEASE FROM AMONG MEN. This is a reference to our exiles among the nations &#x2014; we, Judah and Benjamin, who have no significance among the nations and we are not considered a people or nation at all. Thus Scripture states that according to the attribute of justice we should remain in this condition of exile forever <italic>were it not that I was in dread of the wrath from the enemy</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2506">90</xref></sup> This teaches that, in our present exile, [the protecting influence of] the merits of the patriarchs have ceased<sup><xref rid="fn2516">100</xref></sup> and we have no deliverance from the hands of the nations except for the sake of His Great Name, similar to what He stated in the Book of Ezekiel, <italic>when I bring you out from the peoples, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2517">101</xref></sup> <italic>And ye shall know that I am the Eternal, when I have wrought with you for My Name&#x2019;s sake, not according to your evil ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2518">102</xref></sup> And so also it is further stated, <italic>But I wrought for My Name&#x2019;s sake, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2519">103</xref></sup> Therefore Moses mentioned in his prayer, <italic>then the nations which have heard the fame of Thee will speak, saying</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2520">104</xref></sup> and G-d, blessed be He, acknowledged him in this, <italic>And the Eternal said: &#x2018;I have pardoned according to thy word</italic>.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn2521">105</xref></sup></p>
<p>This plea is not meant to demonstrate His power among His enemies, for <italic>All the nations are as nothing before Him; they are accounted by Him as things of nought, and vanity</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2522">106</xref></sup> Rather, [the explanation thereof is as follows:] G-d created man among the lower creatures in order that he acknowledge his Creator and be thankful to His Name,<sup><xref rid="fn2523">107</xref></sup> and He placed in his hand the choice to do evil or good. But when people sinned willingly and they all denied Him, only this people [Israel] remained devoted to His Name, and so He made known through them by means of signs and wonders that <italic>He is G-d of gods, and Lord of lords</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2524">108</xref></sup> and this became known to all nations. Now, if He were to reconsider and their memory [i.e., of Israel] be lost, the nations will forget His wonders and His deeds and they will no longer recount them. And if a person should mention them, they will think that it was [done by] one of the powers of the constellations which is <italic>overflowing as he passeth through</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2525">109</xref></sup> and thus the purpose of the creation of man will be annulled completely, for no one will be left among them who knows his Creator &#x2014; only those who provoke Him. Therefore, it is appropriate as a consequence of the [Divine] Will which existed at the creation of the world to establish for Himself a people for all time, who are nearer to Him and who know Him more than all the [other] peoples. And the meaning of the verse <italic>For the Eternal will judge His people, and for His servants He will reconsider</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2526">110</xref></sup> is, that G-d will remember in mercy that they are His people of old, and He will remember that they are His servants, for they stood by Him in their exile like servants to suffer the troubles and the bondage, similar to what is stated, <italic>For He said: &#x2018;Surely, they are My people, children that will not deal falsely.&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2527">111</xref></sup> I have already suggested<sup><xref rid="fn2528">112</xref></sup> that in the creation of man there is a sublime and recondite secret which requires that we be His people and He be our G-d, similar to what is stated, <italic>Every one that is called by My Name, and whom I have created for My glory, I have formed him, yea, I have made him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2529">113</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. FOR THEY ARE A NATION VOID OF COUNSEL. [This verse and] the entire section [further on] refers to the aforementioned enemy, according to the words of Rabbi Nechemyah.<sup><xref rid="fn2530">114</xref></sup> And, so too, the verse, <italic>For their Rock is not as our rock</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2531">115</xref></sup> is to be understood as the words of the enemy. Scripture thus states, the enemy should have considered and understood that what was done with Israel had been brought about by G-d because of their sin, and from it they should have realized their own ultimate punishment, for He would do the same to all the nations since they rebel against G-d more than does Israel. They should have been wise and said: &#x201C;<italic>How should one pursue a thousand</italic> from Israel <italic>except their Rock had given them over</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2532">116</xref></sup> For their Rock is powerful and possesses the capability to help and save more than does our rock, <italic>and our enemies</italic> [i.e., the Israelites] <italic>were &#x2018;pelilim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>judges</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn2531">115</xref></sup> over us originally to execute judgments upon us as they wished. And now, why do a thousand [of the Israelites] flee from before us at the shout of one man, except that their mighty Rock gave them over and sent <italic>a faintness into their heart</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2533">117</xref></sup> and they fell when there was no pursuer.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2534">118</xref></sup> The term <italic>&#x2018;pelilim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>judges</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn2531">115</xref></sup> is associated with the expressions: <italic>that &#x2018;pilalt&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>thou hast given judgment</italic>) <italic>for thy sisters;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2535">119</xref></sup> <italic>Then stood up Phinehas &#x2018;vayephaleil&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and wrought judgment</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2536">120</xref></sup></p>
<p>32. FOR THEIR VINE IS OF THE VINE OF SODOM. He is stating that the idolaters are <italic>void of counsel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2537">121</xref></sup> and they have not understood, neither apprehended, nor thought of anything <italic>but evil continually</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2538">122</xref></sup> for they were of evil root and they grow only evil and bitter fruit; <italic>he that eateth of</italic> them <italic>dieth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2539">123</xref></sup> And the explanation thereof is that Israel admits, confesses, and repents in time of trouble, saying, <italic>and why has all this befallen us?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2540">124</xref></sup> But the idolater is <italic>void of counsel, he hath</italic> no <italic>counsel and</italic> no <italic>understanding</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2541">125</xref></sup> but only walks after his idol and forever denies <italic>the Glorious Name</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2542">126</xref></sup> for this is what he inherited from his fathers. Thus he is of <italic>a root that beareth gall and wormwood</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2543">127</xref></sup> and no usefulness will ever be found in them. But Israel whose root is good <italic>if it be cut down, then it will sprout again</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2544">128</xref></sup> and grow good fruit.</p>
<p>34. IS NOT THIS LAID UP IN STORE WITH ME &#x2014; their <italic>cruel poison of asps</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn2545">129</xref></sup> I have put it <italic>in My treasures</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2546">130</xref></sup> to feed them from the fruit of their deeds.</p>
<p>35. VENGEANCE IS MINE, AND RECOMPENSE. [To Me belongs vengeance] to avenge the cause of Israel from their hands, and Mine is the recompense to pay them according to their deeds for having repudiated Me. AGAINST THE TIME WHEN THEIR FOOT SHALL SLIP &#x2014; when their measure [of sin] will be full, as it is stated, <italic>for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2547">131</xref></sup> And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented that &#x201C;the meaning thereof is [in line with the verse], <italic>yea, even the wicked for the day of evil</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2548">132</xref></sup> this constituting a great secret.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2549">133</xref></sup></p>
<p>37. AND HE SHALL SAY, WHERE ARE THEIR GODS. The enemy will say, &#x201C;Where is the G-d of Israel?&#x201D; as it is stated, <italic>Wherefore should the nations say: &#x2018;Where is now their G-d?&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2550">134</xref></sup></p>
<p>38. WHO &#x2018;YOCHEILU&#x2019; (DID EAT) THE FAT OF THEIR SACRIFICES &#x2014; for Israel was more constant in the service of offerings and drink-offerings than any other nation to its gods. He mentions the plural: &#x2018;<italic>yocheilu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>&#x2018;they&#x2019; did eat</italic>)<italic>, &#x2018;yishthu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>&#x2018;they&#x2019; did drink</italic>), and <italic>their &#x2018;gods&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2551">135</xref></sup> which are in the plural [although referring to G-d Who is One] because according to the nations [whose words He is now citing] there are many deities. Therefore He turns [to Israel] and says, <italic>See now</italic> all My people, <italic>that I, even I, am He</italic>, One, <italic>and there is no god with Me</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2552">136</xref></sup> to assist Me, and there is no one to oppose Me, to deliver out of My hand or object to My doing whatever I wish &#x2014; to kill, to wound, to make alive and to heal.<sup><xref rid="fn2552">136</xref></sup></p>
<p>40. FOR I LIFT UP MY HAND TO HEAVEN. By way of the plain meaning of Scripture this is an oath by His throne. He states <italic>I lift up</italic>, for whoever takes an oath raises his hand and touches the object by which he swears. And by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], during the time of the exile <italic>He hath cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2553">137</xref></sup> He, therefore states that now <italic>in an acceptable time</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2554">138</xref></sup> He will lift His hand to the highest heavens, the reference being to <italic>the great hand</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2555">139</xref></sup> that fights on behalf of Israel. And this is the sense of the expression, <italic>And I say: As I live forever</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2556">140</xref></sup> for I make My strong hand active when <italic>I whet the lightning of My sword</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2557">141</xref></sup> and support it [My hand] to prevail for the justice of Israel [which, until then, had been cast down to the earth]<sup><xref rid="fn2558">142</xref></sup> and to <italic>recompense them that hate Me</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2557">141</xref></sup> for then will G-d&#x2019;s Name be full and the throne perfect.<sup><xref rid="fn2559">143</xref></sup> The student learned in the mysteries of the Cabala will understand.</p>
<p>Now this Song, which is our true and faithful testimony, tells us clearly all that will happen to us. It mentions first the mercy that the Holy One, blessed be He, bestowed upon us from the time He took us to be His portion. It mentions the favors that He did for us in the wilderness, and that He caused us to possess the lands of great and mighty nations, and the abundant good, wealth, and honor that He made us inherit there. Yet despite the abundance of all good, they rebelled against G-d to worship the idols, and it mentions how He was provoked by them until He visited upon them in their country pestilence, famine, the evil beast, and the sword, and then He dispersed them in every direction and corner. It is known that all this has been fulfilled, and it was so. And the Song states that ultimately <italic>He will render vengeance to His adversaries</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2560">144</xref></sup> <italic>and will recompense them that hate</italic> Him.<sup><xref rid="fn2557">141</xref></sup> The reason [for their punishment] is that they inflicted all these evils upon us out of their hatred of the Holy One, blessed be He: because they do not hate Israel for having made idols like theirs, but only because they do not imitate their deeds. Instead they serve the Holy One, blessed be He, and observe His commandments, neither intermarrying with them nor eating of their slaughterings, and they [Israel] hold their idol in contempt and remove it from their places, similar to what [the psalmist] said, <italic>but for Thy sake are we killed all the day</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2561">145</xref></sup> If so, it is because of their hatred of the Holy One, blessed be He, that they inflict all these evils upon us; they are thus His adversaries and His enemies, and it is for Him to wreak vengeance upon them. And it is clear, that He assures [Israel] concerning the future redemption, for, during the construction of the Second Temple, the nations did not rejoice with His people,<sup><xref rid="fn2560">144</xref></sup> but mocked them: <italic>What are these feeble Jews doing?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2562">146</xref></sup> And their leaders were servants in the palace of the king of Babylon<sup><xref rid="fn2563">147</xref></sup> and all the Jews were subject to him. In those days He did not <italic>render vengeance to His adversaries and</italic> He did not <italic>make expiation for the land of His people</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2560">144</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now, in this Song there is no condition of repentance or service [of G-d as a prerequisite for the coming redemption], but it is a testamentary document that the evils will come and that we will endure them, and that He, blessed be He, will do with us <italic>in furious rebukes</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2564">148</xref></sup> &#x2014; but He will not destroy our memory. Rather, He will return and be comforted and will punish the enemies <italic>with His sore and great and strong sword</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2565">149</xref></sup> <italic>and forgive our sins, for</italic> His <italic>Name&#x2019;s sake</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2566">150</xref></sup> If so, this Song is a clear-promise of the future redemption &#x2014; the infidels notwithstanding. And so the Rabbis mentioned in the Sifre:<sup><xref rid="fn2567">151</xref></sup> &#x201C;Great is this Song, for there is in it the present, the past, the future, and there is in it this world and the World to Come.&#x201D; It is to this that Scripture alludes in saying, <italic>And Moses came and spoke all the words of this Song in the ears of the people</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2568">152</xref></sup> It mentions <italic>all</italic> [<italic>&#x2018;all&#x2019; the words</italic>] in order to indicate that the Song contains everything that is to come upon them although it is brief in words, for Moses explained its many subjects to them.</p>
<p>Now, if this Song had been written by one of the astrologers <italic>declaring the end from the beginning</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2569">153</xref></sup> it would have earned belief therein because all its words have been fulfilled by now, <italic>not one thing hath failed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2570">154</xref></sup> Certainly we shall continue to believe and look forward with all our heart for the word of G-d by the mouth of His prophet, <italic>the</italic> most <italic>trusted in all</italic> His <italic>house</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2571">155</xref></sup> [<italic>and like unto him</italic>] <italic>was there no one before him, neither after him</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2572">156</xref></sup> &#x2014; peace be upon him&#x0021;</p>

<title>V&#x2019;zoth Habrachah</title>
<h1>33</h1>
<p>1. AND THIS IS THE BLESSING WHEREWITH MOSES THE MAN OF G-D BLESSED THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL BEFORE HIS DEATH. It states <italic>the man of G-d</italic> in order to indicate that his blessing will be fulfilled because he was the man of G-d, <italic>and the prayer of the upright is His delight</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2573">1</xref></sup> Now Scripture calls Moses our teacher <italic>the man of G-d</italic>, and so also the rest of the prophets,<sup><xref rid="fn2574">2</xref></sup> Elijah,<sup><xref rid="fn2575">3</xref></sup> and others,<sup><xref rid="fn2576">4</xref></sup> but it does not state &#x201C;the <italic>man</italic> of the Eternal; &#x201D; instead it says <italic>Moses the &#x2018;servant&#x2019; of the Eternal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2577">5</xref></sup> The reason is known to every student learned in [the mystic lore of] the Torah. So also by way of the Truth, [the expression <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;zoth habrachah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and this is the blessing</italic>) means that] &#x201C;<italic>v&#x2019;zoth</italic> is the blessing&#x201D; [as explained further on], for <italic>From the Eternal has &#x2018;zoth&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>this</italic>) <italic>come</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2578">6</xref></sup> Similarly it is said in the case of Jacob, <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;zoth&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and &#x2018;this&#x2019; is</italic>) <italic>what their father</italic> [Jacob] <italic>spoke unto them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2579">7</xref></sup> It was this blessing that David meant when he said, <italic>&#x2018;Zoth&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>this</italic>) <italic>came to pass unto me, because I have kept Thy precepts</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2580">8</xref></sup> alluding to Zion the city of David, <italic>for there the Eternal commanded the blessing, even life forever</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2581">9</xref></sup> The student learned in the mysteries of the Cabala will understand. Our Rabbis meant this secret in their interpretation in Bereshith Rabbah:<sup><xref rid="fn2582">10</xref></sup> &#x201C; <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;zoth&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and this is</italic>) <italic>what their father spoke unto them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2579">7</xref></sup> A man like me is destined to bless you, and, from the very place where I [Jacob] concluded &#x2014; from there will he begin. At the moment Moses our teacher rose to bless them, he began with <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;zoth habrachah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and this is the blessing</italic>) &#x2014; from the very place where their father concluded. This then is the meaning of the expression <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;zoth&#x2019; what their father spoke unto them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2579">7</xref></sup> [their father Jacob told them that the next blessing they receive would be from a man who will begin with <italic>v&#x2019;zoth</italic> &#x2014; <italic>v&#x2019;zoth habrachah</italic>]. He [i.e., the patriarch Jacob] said to them: When will these blessings reach you? From the time you accept the Torah, in which is written, <italic>&#x2018;V&#x2019;zoth&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>And this is</italic>) <italic>the Law</italic> etc. &#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2583">11</xref></sup> For this word <italic>zoth</italic> alludes to the blessing which is the Torah, and this is the covenant, as it is written <italic>&#x2018;Zoth&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>this is</italic>) <italic>My covenant</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2584">12</xref></sup> I have already mentioned this.<sup><xref rid="fn2585">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. THE ETERNAL CAME FROM SINAI. Moses states that the Eternal came to Israel from Sinai, for it was from there that He caused His Divine Glory to dwell among them and never departed from them again. The purport thereof is as follows: The Glory came down upon Mount Sinai, as it is said, <italic>And the Eternal came down upon Mount Sinai, to the top of the mount; and the Eternal called Moses</italic> etc.,<sup><xref rid="fn2586">14</xref></sup> and there it [the Glory] remained all the days that Moses ascended and descended the mountain, as it is said, <italic>And the appearance of the Glory of the Eternal was like devouring fire on the top of the mount</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2587">15</xref></sup> And when the last [i.e., the second] Tablets were given to him [Moses], the Glory rested in the tent of meeting [Moses&#x2019; own tent], as it is stated, <italic>And it came to pass, when Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the door of the tent, and He spoke with Moses</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2588">16</xref></sup> and it is further written, <italic>And the Eternal spoke unto Moses face to face</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2589">17</xref></sup> When the Tabernacle was set up, the Glory rested therein, as it is said, <italic>Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the Glory of the Eternal filled the Tabernacle</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2590">18</xref></sup> and all communications to Moses came from there during all the years in the wilderness.</p>
<p>AND HE SHONE FORTH FROM SEIR UNTO THEM. For after they journeyed from Sinai <italic>the cloud abode in the wilderness of Paran</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2591">19</xref></sup> and from there Moses sent the spies, as it is said, <italic>And Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2592">20</xref></sup> As a result of the spies&#x2019; report, the people were banished,<sup><xref rid="fn2593">21</xref></sup> and there was no Divine communication to Moses until they came to Seir,<sup><xref rid="fn2594">22</xref></sup> at the border of the children of Esau, at the end of the forty years, as it is said there, <italic>For the Eternal thy G-d hath blessed thee in all the work of thy hand; He hath known thy walking through this great wilderness; these forty years the Eternal thy G-d hath been with thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2595">23</xref></sup> Now, at the time, when they arrived at Seir, <italic>the Eternal was</italic> again <italic>to them an everlasting light and the days of</italic> their <italic>mourning</italic> were <italic>ended</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2596">24</xref></sup> and He commanded them to be heedful of Ammon and Moab [not to take their lands]. At that time He said that they should begin to possess their land<sup><xref rid="fn2597">25</xref></sup> the land of Sihon and Og, the two great Amorite kings.</p>
<p>HE BEAMED FROM MOUNT PARAN &#x2014; He regarded them and placed their needs in the light of His countenance emanating from Mount Paran. The sense thereof is as follows: The beginning of their entry into the great wilderness was from Paran, as it is said, <italic>And the children of Israel set forward by their stages out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud abode in the wilderness of Paran</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2591">19</xref></sup> Then G-d shone forth upon them to see what they needed in <italic>the great and dreadful wilderness</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2598">26</xref></sup> This expression is similar to, <italic>and Thou didst shine forth upon the counsel of the wicked</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2599">27</xref></sup> meaning that You have observed and seen with Your great light all their secret thoughts.</p>
<p>AND HE CAME &#x2018;MEIRIVEVOTH KODESH&#x2019; (FROM THE HOLY MYRIADS), AT HIS RIGHT HAND WAS A FIERY LAW UNTO THEM. He is stating that the Glory came to Israel from the countless holy ones of the Most High who descended upon the mountain with Him, similar to what is stated, <italic>The chariots of G-d are myriads, even thousands upon thousands; the Eternal is among them, as in Sinai, in holiness</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2600">28</xref></sup> <italic>At His right hand was a fiery law unto them</italic>, meaning: <italic>the fiery law</italic> came to them from His glorious right hand<sup><xref rid="fn2601">29</xref></sup> not from the hand of the aforementioned angels, but from the right hand of G-d, Himself and His Glory. And it is possible that <italic>meirivevoth kodesh</italic> means &#x201C;from the abundance of His holiness,&#x201D; for <italic>holy, holy, holy is the Eternal of hosts</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2602">30</xref></sup> with all terms of holiness. And the meaning of <italic>&#x2018;eish dath lamo&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>a fiery law unto them</italic>) is like <italic>dath eish</italic> (a law given with fire), just as he said, <italic>and we have heard His voice out of the midst of the fire</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2603">31</xref></sup> Or its meaning may be like &#x201C;fire &#x2018;and&#x2019; the law to them,&#x201D; the verse mentioning that He showed them the fire from on high and He made them hear the law. This is similar to what is stated, <italic>and upon earth He made thee to see His great fire; and thou didst hear His words out of the midst of the fire</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2604">32</xref></sup> And by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], the verse also states that the fire, which is the law, is at His right hand, because the attribute of justice is comprised also of mercy.</p>
<p>And in the opinion of our Rabbis<sup><xref rid="fn2605">33</xref></sup> the sense of the verse is that from Sinai He came to give the Torah to Israel, for it was from there that He appeared to them. <italic>And He shone forth from Seir</italic> to them, that is, to Israel, for He had appeared to the children of Esau to give them the Torah, and, when the children of Esau refused to accept it, He shone His countenance upon Israel and He gave it to them with His <italic>right hand and</italic> His <italic>arm, and the light of</italic> His <italic>countenance, because</italic> He <italic>was favorable unto them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2606">34</xref></sup> <italic>And He beamed</italic> and showed them His radiance and the beauty of His Presence <italic>from Mount Paran</italic> when the children of Ishmael refused the Torah. Thus Moses mentions that the merit of Israel was great when the rest of the nations did not wish to accept the Torah. Now he mentioned all the seed of Abraham &#x2014; that not one of them desired the Torah except for Israel, but He also appeared to all nations to give it to them and they did not desire it, according to what has been transmitted [to us] in the tradition of our Rabbis.<sup><xref rid="fn2605">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. &#x2018;APH CHOVEIV AMIM.&#x2019; Commentators have explained<sup><xref rid="fn2607">35</xref></sup> that the word <italic>choveiv</italic> is of the Aramaic language [as Onkelos rendered <italic>and ye shall be Mine &#x2018;segulah&#x2019;</italic>]:<sup><xref rid="fn2608">36</xref></sup> &#x201C;and you shall be <italic>chavivin</italic> (beloved) before Me.&#x201D; The verse [here] is thus stating: &#x201C;Yea, He loves Israel which consists of many peoples&#x201D; [i.e., tribes], similar to what is stated, <italic>after thee, Benjamin, among thy peoples</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2609">37</xref></sup> And <italic>all His holy ones</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2610">38</xref></sup> of Israel, namely, the Levites, <italic>are in Thy hand</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2610">38</xref></sup> for You have brought them near You to encamp around the ark.<sup><xref rid="fn2611">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>It appears to me that the word <italic>choveiv</italic> is from the same root as <italic>by hiding &#x2018;b&#x2019;chubi&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>in my bosom</italic>) <italic>mine iniquity</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2612">40</xref></sup> related to the expressions: <italic>into an inner chamber &#x2018;l&#x2019;heichavei&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>to hide thyself</italic>);<sup><xref rid="fn2613">41</xref></sup> <italic>and there is &#x2018;chevyon&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>the hiding of</italic>) <italic>His power</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2614">42</xref></sup> He is thus stating [here]: &#x201C;You are also hiding and protecting with Your hand the peoples &#x2014; <italic>all the holy ones</italic> of Israel.&#x201D; The above-mentioned [phrase] suggests <italic>that all the congregation are holy, every one of them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2615">43</xref></sup> and G-d protects them with His hand, similar in meaning to the verse, <italic>And I have put My words in thy mouth, and have covered thee in the shadow of My hand</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2616">44</xref></sup> and like the expression, <italic>Thou art my hiding place and my shield</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2617">45</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>and they take counsel against Thy hidden ones</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2618">46</xref></sup> This alludes to what he said, <italic>inasmuch as Thou Eternal art seen face to face, and Thy cloud standeth over them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2619">47</xref></sup> And similarly he said in the Song [of <italic>Ha&#x2019;azinu</italic>], <italic>He compassed him about, He cared for him, He kept him as the apple of His eye</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2620">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND THEY &#x2018;TUKU.&#x2019; This is like <italic>&#x2018;huku&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and they were smitten</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn2621">49</xref></sup> [<italic>at Thy feet</italic>], as Scripture says <italic>&#x2018;tirgalti l&#x2019;Ephraim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>I taught Ephraim to walk</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn2622">50</xref></sup> in place of <italic>hirgalti</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2623">51</xref></sup> Similarly the feminine <italic>hei</italic> is exchanged for a <italic>thav</italic> in the following expressions: <italic>I will not give &#x2018;sh&#x2019;nath&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>sleep</italic>) <italic>to mine eyes;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2624">52</xref></sup> <italic>a sinner doeth evil &#x2018;m&#x2019;ath&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>a hundred times</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn2625">53</xref></sup> and there are many such examples. He is thus stating that &#x201C; &#x2018;they were smitten&#x2019; with every plague in the wilderness by following You wherever You went; they cared not for hunger, thirst, the affliction of serpents and scorpions. They only followed <italic>Thy feet</italic> and ran after You.&#x201D; This is similar to what is stated, <italic>I remember for thee the affection of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, thy going after Me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2626">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x2018;YISA MIDABROTHECHA.&#x2019; The word <italic>yisa</italic> is similar to: <italic>Thou shall not &#x2018;thisa&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>take</italic>) <italic>the Name of the Eternal thy G-d in vain;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2627">55</xref></sup> <italic>and nor &#x2018;esa&#x2019; do I take their names upon my lips;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2628">56</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;yisa&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>he shall swear</italic>) <italic>in that day, saying</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2629">57</xref></sup> And the word <italic>midabrothecha</italic> is like the expression <italic>&#x2018;umidbareich&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and thy mouth</italic>) <italic>is comely</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2630">58</xref></sup> He thus states [in the verse before us] that Israel will take Your words upon his lips and meditate upon them always.&#x201D;</p>
<p>4. MOSES COMMANDED US A LAW. The meaning thereof is that Israel will always &#x201C;take&#x201D; [receive His words] and say <italic>&#x201C;Moses commanded us a Law</italic> and this will be <italic>an inheritance of the congregation of Jacob</italic>, for all the children of Jacob shall possess it forever and observe it, <italic>for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed.&#x201D;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2631">59</xref></sup> And our Rabbis interpreted<sup><xref rid="fn2632">60</xref></sup> that he did not say &#x201C;an inheritance of the house of Jacob&#x201D; or &#x201C;the seed of Jacob&#x201D; &#x2014; he stated <italic>of the congregation of Jacob</italic> in order to suggest that many [strangers] would join them and the Torah will always be an inheritance of Jacob and of all who congregate to him, these being the strangers <italic>that join themselves to the Eternal, to minister unto Him</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2633">61</xref></sup> <italic>and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2634">62</xref></sup> and they will all be called &#x201C;His congregation.&#x201D;</p>
<p>5. AND THERE WAS A KING IN JESHURUN. This alludes to the aforementioned Name [in Verse 2: <italic>&#x2018;The Eternal&#x2019; came from Sinai</italic>], Who was King over Israel when they were upright and all the heads of the people and all tribes of Israel were gathered together. Now this verse, too, is connected [with the above theme &#x2014; the Revelation at Sinai], and the sense thereof is that Israel will always say: &#x201C;The Torah which Moses commanded us will forever be an inheritance to the entire congregation of Jacob. We shall never alter it or change it.&#x201D; And they will further say that &#x201C;G-d became King over Israel when our leaders, our elders, our judges and all tribes of Israel gathered, for we all, together, accepted His reign upon ourselves for all generations, and we are obligated to keep His Law and [acknowledge] His Kingdom forever.&#x201D; This commandment is the precept of <italic>I am the Eternal thy G-d</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2635">63</xref></sup> and it constitutes &#x201C;the acknowledgment of the Kingdom of Heaven,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2636">64</xref></sup> as I have explained there.<sup><xref rid="fn2635">63</xref></sup> Thus he mentioned the Torah in general, and the Kingdom of Heaven in partizcular, for whoever acknowledges the Kingdom of Heaven denies the idols and acknowledges the entire Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn2637">65</xref></sup> The people thus intimated that they and their leaders accepted [the commandment to acknowledge] the Kingdom of Heaven [directly] from the mouth of the Almighty<sup><xref rid="fn2638">66</xref></sup> and saw that He is King of Israel and his Redeemer. They accepted the Torah from the mouth of Moses for they <italic>took upon them, and upon their seed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2639">67</xref></sup> to believe in him and to do whatever he commands in behalf of the King, just as they said [to Moses], <italic>and thou shalt speak unto us all that the Eternal our G-d may speak unto thee, and we will hear it, and do it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2640">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>This interpretation of the verse is clear and well founded. It accords with the rendering of the Rabbis in the Gemara of Tractate Rosh Hashanah:<sup><xref rid="fn2641">69</xref></sup> &#x201C;But only three verses referring to Sovereignty [of G-d] are found [in the Five Books of Moses]&#x0021; <italic>The Eternal shall reign for ever and ever;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2642">70</xref></sup> <italic>The Eternal his G-d is with him, and the &#x2018;t&#x2019;ruah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>shouting</italic>) <italic>for the King is among them;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2643">71</xref></sup> <italic>And there was a King in Jeshurun.&#x201D;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2644">72</xref></sup> We have also been taught so in the Sifre:<sup><xref rid="fn2645">73</xref></sup> &#x201C;When the elders [of Israel] sit in council on earth, His Great Name is praised on high, as it is said, <italic>And there was a King in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people were gathered, all the tribes of Israel together</italic>. The term &#x2018;gathering&#x2019; applies only to the elders, as it is said, <italic>Gather unto Me seventy men of the elders of Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2646">74</xref></sup> <italic>All the tribes of Israel together</italic> &#x2014; when there is but one brotherhood [then there is a King in Israel] but not when they become numerous factions. And so it is also said, <italic>It is He that buildeth His upper chambers in the heaven</italic>, [<italic>and hath founded His band upon the earth</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn2647">75</xref></sup> And in the Midrash Rabbah<sup><xref rid="fn2648">76</xref></sup> they also stated, &#x2018;His throne is firmly set, as it were, on high, when Israel is formed into a single association; therefore it is stated, <italic>It is He that buildeth His upper chambers in the heaven, and hath founded His band upon the earth.&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2647">75</xref></sup> <italic>And there was a King in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people were gathered</italic>, etc.&#x201D; This also accords with the manner in which I have explained, for the Rabbis interpreted: there was a King over them because they were gathered and all of them together took His Kingdom upon themselves, and so shall it be <italic>an inheritance of the congregation of Jacob</italic>. &#x201C;The King&#x201D; [mentioned in the verse] is thus the Holy One, blessed be He, and so it is our custom to recite [this verse: <italic>And there was a King in Jeshurun</italic> etc.] in the New Year&#x2019;s [Additional] Prayers composed by Rav<sup><xref rid="fn2649">77</xref></sup> [as one of the verses of His Sovereignty].</p>
<p>However, in some Agadoth [homilies] they explain the term &#x201C;king&#x201D; with reference to Moses. Thus they say:<sup><xref rid="fn2650">78</xref></sup> &#x201C;Moses was king, for it is said, <italic>And there was a king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people were gathered</italic>.&#x201D; And if so, Scripture is stating: &#x201C;<italic>Moses commanded us a Law</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2651">79</xref></sup> that it be <italic>an inheritance of the congregation of Jacob</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2651">79</xref></sup> and he was king over us and all our tribes together, and it behooves us to obey his words and his commandments for he was a great and wise king over us.&#x201D; Scripture also tells in honor of the emissary [Moses] that he was great and trustworthy. The correct and true interpretation is what we have explained [above]. Thus he mentions that G-d dwells in Israel, and that they &#x2014; all their tribes together &#x2014; accepted His Torah and His reign upon themselves and upon their seed for [all] their generations. If so, they are worthy of blessing.</p>
<p>6. LET REUBEN LIVE. Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented that &#x201C;he began with Reuben because he was the firstborn. He did not mention Simeon because of the sin of [Baal] Peor, because the worshippers were Simeonites, the proof being their numbers,<sup><xref rid="fn2652">80</xref></sup> and their prince, too, being killed [in the affair].&#x201D; In my opinion, the numbers are no proof because over thirteen thousand are still unaccounted for, aside from those who died in the plague.<sup><xref rid="fn2652">80</xref></sup> In addition, other tribes as well diminished in population, for the sons of Gad lost five thousand,<sup><xref rid="fn2653">81</xref></sup> and the sons of Ephraim, eight thousand&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn2654">82</xref></sup> Moreover, from the verse which states, <italic>And Israel attached himself unto Baal-peor</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2655">83</xref></sup> and it is said again, <italic>Take all the chiefs of the people</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2656">84</xref></sup> it would appear that there were some among them from all the tribes, and that all their judges passed sentence on them. And similarly He said, <italic>so that I consumed not the children of Israel in My jealousy</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2657">85</xref></sup> Now do not rejoin against me from the affair of Achan where He said, <italic>Israel hath sinned</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2658">86</xref></sup> [although it was but a single individual who sinned; similarly we can say that it was the tribe of Simeon alone that sinned in the affair of Peor yet Scripture describes it as if the entire nation sinned. This rejoinder is not valid, for] there, [the details of] the sin had not yet been revealed, so He mentioned Israel generally [but in the case of Peor the facts of the sin were clearly given and still He spoke of all Israel, which shows that people from all the tribes were among the worshippers of Peor]. Similarly, the identity of the victim [i.e., Zimri, a leader of the Simeonites] is no proof [that only his tribe sinned, as Ibn Ezra argues], for he [Zimri, the son of Salu] was only <italic>a prince of a fathers&#x2019; house</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2659">87</xref></sup> of that tribe, not the prince of the [entire] tribe. Those who assembled against G-d in the congregation of Korach were greater and more honorable people than he [Zimri], for <italic>they were princes of the congregation</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2660">88</xref></sup> yet all their tribes did not follow them&#x0021; Additionally, the psalm [that relates the sins of the wilderness] mentions Dathan and Abiram and their affair by name, saying, <italic>The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2661">89</xref></sup> and it [the same psalm] mentions <italic>They attached themselves also unto Baal-peor</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2662">90</xref></sup> together with <italic>Moreover, they scorned the desirable Land</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2663">91</xref></sup> which applies to the general population&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn2664">92</xref></sup> Forbid it also that Moses should refrain from blessing the tribe of Simeon, [when it is said] <italic>that a tribe be not blotted out from Israel&#x0021;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2665">93</xref></sup> For all those who had joined Baal-peor had already died, as it is said, <italic>for all the men that followed Baal-peor, the Eternal thy G-d hath destroyed from the midst of thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2666">94</xref></sup> and it is written of those who survived, <italic>But ye that did cleave unto the Eternal your G-d are alive every one of you this day</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2667">95</xref></sup> And why should he not bless them? They all made the [golden] calf and sinned in the affair of the spies, yet they were forgiven, and he blessed them&#x0021;</p>
<p>Now, I have seen in Midrash Rabbah the following text:<sup><xref rid="fn2668">96</xref></sup> &#x201C;Six families were eliminated because of the immorality caused by Balaam&#x2019;s advice [that Israel could be corrupted through seduction], and so Scripture listed one family less of Simeon<sup><xref rid="fn2669">97</xref></sup> and five less of Benjamin.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2670">98</xref></sup> Thus, according to the opinion of the Rabbis [the tribe of] Benjamin had a greater part in the sin than did the tribe of Simeon &#x2014; yet Benjamin is included in the blessing&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn2671">99</xref></sup></p>
<p>In my opinion, the correct interpretation is that Scripture considers the tribes of Israel as only twelve. So it stated in Jacob&#x2019;s blessing, <italic>All these are the twelve tribes of Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2672">100</xref></sup> Now Jacob mentioned his twelve sons and considered Joseph to be one tribe<sup><xref rid="fn2673">101</xref></sup> [instead of enumerating Ephraim and Menasheh separately as is sometimes done]. Moses saw fit to consider Joseph as two tribes, as he said, <italic>And they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Menasheh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2674">102</xref></sup> This was for two reasons: one, since the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded and made them two tribes regarding the dedication of the altar,<sup><xref rid="fn2675">103</xref></sup> the flags<sup><xref rid="fn2676">104</xref></sup> [designating the tribal encampments in the wilderness], and the inheritance of the Land,<sup><xref rid="fn2677">105</xref></sup> he [Moses] had to count them as two [separate tribes] for their blessing. Secondly, he referred to Joshua, who would make them possess the Land, and he was from Ephraim, the younger son [of Joseph], therefore Moses had to mention his brother [Menasheh] who was older than him. Now, he also wanted to bless [the tribe of] Levi, for, through his blessing, all Israel would be blessed, in that his offerings shall be acceptable before G-d on their behalf. Hence it was necessary to omit one of the tribes, for nowhere [in Scripture] are they enumerated except as twelve, corresponding to the twelve constellations in the firmament,<sup><xref rid="fn2678">106</xref></sup> the twelve months of the year, and the twelve &#x201C;border diagonals&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2679">107</xref></sup> concerning which the Rabbis have said in the Midrash<sup><xref rid="fn2678">106</xref></sup> that they are <italic>the everlasting arms</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2680">108</xref></sup> As the Sages mentioned in Tractate Berachoth:<sup><xref rid="fn2681">109</xref></sup> &#x201C;The Holy One, blessed be He, said to the prophet,<sup><xref rid="fn2682">110</xref></sup> Go and tell the congregation of Israel: My daughter, I have created twelve constellations in the firmament to correspond to the twelve tribes.&#x201D; Similarly, at Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal where Scripture counts Levi,<sup><xref rid="fn2683">111</xref></sup> Joseph is not mentioned as two tribes<sup><xref rid="fn2683">111</xref></sup> [because, there Simeon<sup><xref rid="fn2683">111</xref></sup> is mentioned]. Likewise you will see in the distributions of Ezekiel that he counts Joseph as two tribes<sup><xref rid="fn2684">112</xref></sup> with reference to the apportioning of the Land and did not mention Levi. On the other hand, in enumerating the city exits [of Jerusalem] he mentioned, <italic>the gate of Levi, one</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2685">113</xref></sup> and did not list the tribe of Joseph as two tribes; instead he said, <italic>the gate of Joseph, one</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2686">114</xref></sup> since the tribes are always counted as only twelve. I have already mentioned this in the section <italic>Vayikach Korach</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2687">115</xref></sup> Accordingly, Simeon was left out [of Moses&#x2019; blessings] since his tribe was not large and it was not the intention of the blessing of Jacob, their father, that they become numerous. Instead he divided them in Jacob and scattered them in Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn2688">116</xref></sup> and to that extent they, too, were blessed through the blessing of the rest of the tribes among whom they were.</p>
<p>Now the order of this blessing [of Moses] was by [dictate of] <italic>Ruach Hakodesh</italic> (the Holy Spirit) according to their inheritance. He began with Reuben for he occupied his inheritance first;<sup><xref rid="fn2689">117</xref></sup> and, also, <italic>for he was the firstborn</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2690">118</xref></sup> and Moses prayed for him that his name not be blotted out because of his sin; therefore, in his blessing, he accorded him <italic>the right of the firstborn</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2691">119</xref></sup> Then he mentioned Judah for he was the first to inherit within the Land [proper]<sup><xref rid="fn2692">120</xref></sup> <italic>and of him came he that is the prince</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2693">121</xref></sup> and he was the first to advance to war [against the Canaanites],<sup><xref rid="fn2694">122</xref></sup> concerning which Moses blessed him [saying, <italic>his hands shall contend for him, and Thou shalt be a help against his adversaries</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn2695">123</xref></sup> Thus Judah&#x2019;s blessing embraces all Israel. Then Moses blessed Levi &#x2014; who dwelled with the children of Judah in Jerusalem, and there their offerings should be acceptable. Afterwards he blessed Benjamin because their inheritance was with the children of Judah, and, [because] the city of Jerusalem and the Sanctuary were between the children of Judah and the children of Benjamin, and the Levites abode with both of them. Then he blessed the children of Joseph for such was their inheritance, as it is said, <italic>And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families; and the border of their lot went out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2696">124</xref></sup> Afterwards he continued to bless the children of the mistresses,<sup><xref rid="fn2697">125</xref></sup> and mentioned Zebulun before Issachar<sup><xref rid="fn2698">126</xref></sup> as Jacob had done.<sup><xref rid="fn2699">127</xref></sup> So, too, [in the division of the Land] the third lot fell to the children of Zebulun<sup><xref rid="fn2700">128</xref></sup> and the fourth lot to the children of Issachar.<sup><xref rid="fn2700">128</xref></sup> Then he blessed the children of the handmaids<sup><xref rid="fn2701">129</xref></sup> &#x2014; Dan, Naphtali, and Asher &#x2014; in order of their birth,<sup><xref rid="fn2702">130</xref></sup> and they were also [encamped] under the same standard.<sup><xref rid="fn2703">131</xref></sup> He mentioned Gad [born after Naphtali] before all the children of the handmaids, because he occupied his inheritance earlier with Reuben,<sup><xref rid="fn2704">132</xref></sup> the first of all, and he was [encamped under] Reuben&#x2019;s standard.<sup><xref rid="fn2705">133</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Let Reuben live, and not die</italic>. &#x201C;The meaning thereof is that his tribe shall live and never die.<sup><xref rid="fn2706">134</xref></sup> <italic>And let his men be a number</italic>. This is like the verse, <italic>And I have not learned wisdom and the knowledge of the Holy One I have</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2707">135</xref></sup> [where the word <italic>not</italic> from the first part of the verse, applies to the second part as well &#x2013; &#x2018;and the knowledge of the Holy One I have not.&#x2019; Here, too, the word <italic>not</italic> from the expression <italic>and &#x2018;not&#x2019; die</italic> applies to the second part, thus meaning] &#x2018;and let his men <italic>not</italic> be a number,&#x2019; that they may not become few, for whatever can be counted, is few. So also, <italic>and I am few in number</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2708">136</xref></sup> This is the language of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra.</p>
<p>It is more correct to explain: &#x201C;<italic>Let Reuben live</italic> in Israel; <italic>and not die</italic>, that his tribe at no time should be cut off, and that his numbers always be among the count of the children of Israel.&#x201D; He prayed for him that his name not be cut off from Israel because of the anger with which his father was wroth with him when he defiled his couch.<sup><xref rid="fn2709">137</xref></sup> This is similar to what is stated there, <italic>and Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father&#x2019;s concubine; and Israel heard of it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2710">138</xref></sup> Scripture made it be known that he was not excluded from that number on account of his sin. Rashi also explained it this way. And the meaning of <italic>his men</italic> [<italic>and let &#x2018;his men&#x2019; be numbered</italic> among the men of Israel] is that <italic>all</italic> his men should deserve this [to be included in the ranks of Israel], and not even part of their tribe be cut off because of his [Reuben&#x2019;s] sin. Perhaps the expression <italic>his men</italic> refers to the heads of the four families [of the tribe of Reuben &#x2014; Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi],<sup><xref rid="fn2711">139</xref></sup> and the meaning of the word <italic>mispar</italic> (number) is like <italic>b&#x2019;mispar</italic> [with the prefix <italic>beth</italic> meaning &#x201C;in the number,&#x201D; the verse stating: &#x201C;and let his men be &#x2018;in&#x2019; the number&#x201D; of the children of Israel]. Similarly, <italic>to play the harlot &#x2018;beith&#x2019;</italic> [literally: &#x201C;the house of&#x201D;] <italic>her father</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2712">140</xref></sup> [means <italic>b&#x2019;veith</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;in the house of&#x201D; her father]; <italic>they shall wash &#x2018;mayim&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2713">141</xref></sup> [literally: &#x201C;water,&#x201D; means <italic>b&#x2019;mayim</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;with water&#x201D;]. There are many similar cases. Or it may be that the meaning thereof is that in the census of Israel his men be counted first as is the right of the firstborn, for number one is the unit from which all numbers originate.<sup><xref rid="fn2714">142</xref></sup></p>
<p>Onkelos rendered it: &#x201C;And his children will receive their inheritance among their numbers.&#x201D; He meant what we have explained, saying that Reuben will live and not be cut off [from Israel] and his men will be counted among their numbers forever. His tribe will not be blotted out from Israel but they will not be counted on account of their large numbers as forming two tribes. Thus he deprived him of the birthright [that awards the firstborn with a double share], but he assured him of being forever one tribe.</p>
<p>And some commentators<sup><xref rid="fn2715">143</xref></sup> explain that this blessing refers to the conquest of the Land, the verse stating that the Reubenites will live when crossing [the Jordan] armed for war before the children of Israel. And the purport thereof is that they will prevail, and not be defeated, similar in meaning to the expression, <italic>and by thy sword shalt thou live</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2716">144</xref></sup> <italic>And let him not die</italic>, that none of them should die in battle, <italic>and his men be a number</italic> that they should return to their homes in their [original] number, <italic>there lacking not one man</italic> of them.<sup><xref rid="fn2717">145</xref></sup> Similarly, in the blessing of Gad<sup><xref rid="fn2718">146</xref></sup> his companion [under the same standard]<sup><xref rid="fn2719">147</xref></sup> Moses mentioned this subject. This interpretation is likely [to be true]. But the first one appears to me to be more correct, for Moses&#x2019; blessing corresponds to the manner and thought that Jacob mentioned.</p>
<p>And by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], the expression <italic>Let</italic> [<italic>Reuben</italic>] <italic>live and not die</italic> is associated with <italic>visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2720">148</xref></sup> and there I alluded to its secret.<sup><xref rid="fn2720">148</xref></sup> Moses&#x2019; blessing helped Reuben gain atonement for the affair of Bilhah, that he not be cut off and be denied [the World to Come] for it, forever. However, He visited upon him, along with the rest of the tribes [the sin of] the sale of Joseph, according to the narrative in <italic>Pirkei Heichaloth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2721">149</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. AND THIS FOR JUDAH. &#x201C;And for Judah he said likewise that he live and not die, and further added for him, <italic>hear, Eternal, the voice of Judah</italic>.&#x201D; This is the opinion of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra. But this is not correct in accordance with our interpretation [above on the blessing of Reuben], for Judah was not involved in this [punishment of] extinction<sup><xref rid="fn2722">150</xref></sup> [making it necessary for] Moses to pray for him, just as he did not mention this in the blessing of the remaining tribes. But the verse is to be understood in its plain meaning: &#x201C;<italic>and this</italic> is the blessing <italic>for Judah</italic>.&#x201D; And by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], he singled out the attribute of <italic>zoth</italic> (this) for Judah because his is the conduct of war and from him shall be royalty forever,<sup><xref rid="fn2723">151</xref></sup> this being the <italic>help against his adversaries</italic>. This is the secret of the verse stating, <italic>To teach the sons of Judah the bow. Behold, it is written in the Book of Jashar</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2724">152</xref></sup> for this is the bow which is seen in the cloud concerning which it is said, <italic>&#x2018;Zoth&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>this</italic>) <italic>is the token of the covenant</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2725">153</xref></sup></p>
<p>HEAR, ETERNAL, THE VOICE OF JUDAH. He prayed for him when he goes out to fight, for it was Judah who was first to go up to fight<sup><xref rid="fn2694">122</xref></sup> <italic>and of him came he that is the prince</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2693">121</xref></sup> to fight the enemies of Israel. And so also did Jacob say, <italic>thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2726">154</xref></sup></p>
<p>AND BRING HIM IN INTO HIS PEOPLE &#x2014; that he should return [from the fighting] in peace. HIS HANDS SHALL &#x2018;RAV&#x2019; FOR HIM. His hands shall &#x201C;be sufficient&#x201D; for him, so that he need no other help except for the help of G-d Who will answer him when he prays, all as written in the words of Onkelos.<sup><xref rid="fn2727">155</xref></sup> So also is the opinion of the commentators.<sup><xref rid="fn2728">156</xref></sup></p>
<p>In my opinion he [Moses] further alludes to Judah&#x2019;s first war against the Canaanite concerning which G-d said, <italic>Judah shall go up</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2694">122</xref></sup> first. And he states <italic>his hands shall &#x2018;rav&#x2019;</italic> meaning that he will annex and conquer from his foes &#x201C;many&#x201D; lands, more than are due him as his inheritance. He intimates that Judah will give part of his inheritance to his brother Simeon, this being what is stated, <italic>Out of the allotment of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon, for the portion of Judah was too much for them; therefore the children of Simeon had inheritance in the midst of their inheritance</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2729">157</xref></sup> Thus Moses mentioned Simeon by allusion together with Judah.</p>
<p>8. &#x2018;UL&#x2019;LEIVI&#x2019; HE SAID - &#x201C;and &#x2018;of&#x2019; Levi<sup><xref rid="fn2730">158</xref></sup> he said.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language, and it is also the opinion of the commentators.<sup><xref rid="fn2731">159</xref></sup> It is like the expressions: <italic>say &#x2018;li&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>of me</italic>):. <italic>he is my brother;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2732">160</xref></sup> <italic>and the men of the place asked him &#x2018;l&#x2019;ishto&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>about his wife</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2733">161</xref></sup> There are many such examples. In my opinion [the expression here is to be understood literally: &#x201C;and &#x2018;to&#x2019; Levi he said&#x201D;] because Moses had mentioned the names of Reuben and Judah in his blessing [of them], saying, <italic>Let Reuben live</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2734">162</xref></sup> <italic>the voice of Judah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2735">163</xref></sup> but he did not mention the names of the other tribes in [the text of] their blessings. Therefore Scripture states, <italic>And to Levi he said, To Benjamin he said</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2736">164</xref></sup> [in order to make it clear to whom he was addressing his blessing]. This indicates that the tribes were facing him [Moses], and he called Levi and put his eyes upon him and said, <italic>thy Thummim and thy Urim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2737">165</xref></sup> Similarly he blessed each tribe face to face.</p>
<p>WHOM THOU DIDST PROVE &#x2018;B&#x2019;MASSAH&#x2019; &#x2014; &#x201C;that You tested him by trial.<sup><xref rid="fn2738">166</xref></sup> And the purport thereof is that Levi was scrupulous in whatever You tried him with, and no reproach could be found in him except [for the affair at] the waters of Meribah, for which You have already punished him [by depriving Moses and Aaron of the right to enter the Land]. He made the calf,<sup><xref rid="fn2739">167</xref></sup> however, [on the wrong assumption that it was] for the glory of G-d [and therefore, because it was a mistake rather than an intentional sin, Moses did not mention it here].&#x201D; This is the language of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra. And in the Sifre it is stated:<sup><xref rid="fn2740">168</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Whom Thou didst prove &#x2018;b&#x2019;massah&#x2019;</italic> &#x2014; You tested him many times and he was found perfect in all trials. <italic>With whom Thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah</italic>. Unfounded charges were turned against him [Aaron] <italic>at the waters of Meribah</italic>. If Moses said, <italic>Hear now, ye rebels</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2741">169</xref></sup> [for which he was punished], what did Aaron and Miriam do?&#x201D;</p>
<p>In line with the plain meaning of Scripture, it seems to me that the correct interpretation is that <italic>b&#x2019;massah</italic> simply refers to the place where the people tested G-d, in Rephidim [which was subsequently renamed <italic>Massah u&#x2019;Meribah</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn2742">170</xref></sup> The verse [here] states: &#x201C;Your Thummim and your Urim<sup><xref rid="fn2743">171</xref></sup> will forever be with your holy ones, with his seed after him, <italic>whom Thou didst prove at Massah</italic> when the children of Israel sinned and tested G-d concerning water.<sup><xref rid="fn2744">172</xref></sup> <italic>And he</italic> [the tribe of Levi] <italic>was not among the company of them that gathered themselves against the Eternal</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2745">173</xref></sup> because he believed in G-d and in His word that <italic>He</italic> will <italic>bring</italic> them <italic>forth water out of the rock of flint</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2746">174</xref></sup> On the second occasion You strove with him and punished him [by decreeing that Moses and Aaron would die in the wilderness] <italic>at the waters of &#x2018;Meribah&#x2019;</italic> [i.e., &#x2018;the quarrelling&#x2019;] of Israel, for it was on account of their [Israel&#x2019;s] striving that the punishment came and not that he [Aaron] trespassed against G-d &#x2014; for he believed from the start, as well, that it is You <italic>who turned the rock into a pool of water</italic>, [<italic>the flint into a fountain of waters</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn2747">175</xref></sup> Surely [Aaron believed] this [second time at Kadesh] after already having seen it [at Rephidim].&#x201D; Moses thus intimates that that sin was the fault of the people, for, because of their strife, Moses and Aaron thought that they were required to act the way they did, since the Divine Glory might have departed as an outcome of their punishment, this being what is stated, <italic>They angered Him also at the waters of Meribah, and it went ill with Moses because of them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2748">176</xref></sup></p>
<p>And the meaning of <italic>&#x2018;t&#x2019;riveihu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>with whom Thou didst strive</italic>) is similar to the expression <italic>&#x2018;rivah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>strive</italic>), <italic>O Eternal, with them that strive with me</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2749">177</xref></sup> the verse here meaning: &#x201C;You have paid him [i.e., Aaron] the consequence of the strife <italic>which the children of Israel strove with the Eternal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2750">178</xref></sup> It is possible that its meaning is as the Rabbi said in the Sifre [quoted above]<sup><xref rid="fn2740">168</xref></sup> that these are references to <italic>s&#x2019;kufim</italic>, that is, unfounded charges. He alludes to the insignificance of the sin and the severity of the punishment, similar to, <italic>through them that are nigh unto Me I will be sanctified</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2751">179</xref></sup> Such also is the opinion of Onkelos who rendered the text here: &#x201C;Whom You tested with trials and he was [found to be] perfect,&#x201D; the trials being the strife of the children of Israel and their testing of the Eternal. However, since he was found perfect the first time [at Rephidim], surely he believed in the word of G-d on the second occasion. You tried his heart <italic>at the waters of Meribah &#x2014; and foundest his heart faithful before Thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2752">180</xref></sup> for &#x201C;it is revealed and known before the throne of Thy Glory&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2753">181</xref></sup> that he [Aaron] believes in You and in Your word. But the punishment came upon him because of Israel, as I have explained on the verse, <italic>Also the Eternal was angry with me for your sakes</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2754">182</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now Moses spoke first of the priests, for he said to the tribe of Levi that the Urim and Thummim<sup><xref rid="fn2743">171</xref></sup> will be to his holy one [the High Priest] from among them. Afterwards he said of the whole tribe that He tested them in the affair of the calf, in Egypt,<sup><xref rid="fn2755">183</xref></sup> and in the wilderness<sup><xref rid="fn2756">184</xref></sup> &#x2014; and, therefore, they shall teach His ordinances to Jacob.<sup><xref rid="fn2757">185</xref></sup> Such also is the opinion of Onkelos who rendered the verse:<sup><xref rid="fn2757">185</xref></sup> &#x201C;These [men] are fit to teach your laws etc.&#x201D; Or it may be that he speaks of them [the Levites] with reference to the future, as explained by Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra. The expression <italic>they shall teach Jacob Thine ordinances</italic> refers to all of the Levites, and <italic>they shall put incense</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2757">185</xref></sup> relates to the priests of that tribe.</p>
<p>11. BLESS, ETERNAL, &#x2018;CHEILO&#x2019; &#x2014; that they be a great <italic>chayil</italic> (army). And the meaning thereof is that they should increase and not decrease when they enter the Holiness, similar in meaning to the verse, <italic>Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2758">186</xref></sup> It is similarly stated in the admonitions concerning [the Levites], <italic>and that they may not die</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2759">187</xref></sup> And Onkelos rendered <italic>cheilo</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;his possessions,&#x201D; from the expression <italic>and all their flocks, and all &#x2018;cheilam&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>their possessions</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2760">188</xref></sup> He means what our Rabbis have said concerning the incense &#x2014; that it bestows a blessing [upon the priest that performs that service].<sup><xref rid="fn2761">189</xref></sup> The phrase [before us] is connected with the expression in [the preceding verse], <italic>they shall put incense before Thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2757">185</xref></sup> because, as a result of it, his possessions will be blessed, as we have been taught:<sup><xref rid="fn2761">189</xref></sup> &#x201C;Fresh priests come and draw lots for the incense.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2762">190</xref></sup> And in the Sifre it is stated:<sup><xref rid="fn2763">191</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>Bless, Eternal, &#x2018;cheilo&#x2019;</italic> &#x2014; his possessions. From here the Rabbis have deduced: Most priests are wealthy. In the name of Abba the Preacher the Rabbis have said: <italic>I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2764">192</xref></sup> &#x2014; this refers to the seed of Aaron.&#x201D;</p>
<p>12. THE BELOVED OF THE ETERNAL SHALL DWELL IN SAFETY BY HIM. He called Benjamin <italic>the beloved of the Eternal</italic>, saying: &#x201C;Benjamin, who is the beloved of G-d, will dwell in his land in safety relying on G-d and G-d will shelter him always and cause His Divine Presence to rest in his land.&#x201D; <italic>And He dwelleth between his shoulders</italic> &#x2014; this alludes to what the Rabbis have derived from this expression.<sup><xref rid="fn2765">193</xref></sup></p>
<p>By the way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], the verse states: <italic>the Beloved, the Eternal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2766">194</xref></sup> will dwell over Benjamin, and this is the assurance to the Benjaminites that they may trust <italic>in the Eternal forever, for the Eternal is G-d, an everlasting Rock</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2767">195</xref></sup> And He will shelter and protect Benjamin <italic>all the day</italic>, and <italic>they shall not be ashamed at the time of</italic> trouble,<sup><xref rid="fn2768">196</xref></sup> and <italic>between the shoulders of</italic> Benjamin He will dwell forever. It is from this verse that Solomon was called <italic>Yedidiah</italic> [i.e., the beloved of the Eternal], <italic>for the Eternal&#x2019;s sake</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2769">197</xref></sup> and he built His <italic>lovely dwelling-place</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2770">198</xref></sup> just as he was called <italic>Shlomoh</italic>, also meaning to say that his nature was perfect (<italic>shleimah</italic>) in peace (<italic>shalom</italic>), and therefore it is spelled with the letter <italic>hei</italic> [at the end, in order to indicate that he is <italic>shleimah</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;perfect&#x201D;]. And the Rabbis said in the Midrash of Rabbi Nechunya ben Hakanah:<sup><xref rid="fn2771">199</xref></sup> &#x201C;The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him [Solomon]: Since your name is like the name of My Glory I will give you My daughter, for it is written, <italic>And the Eternal gave Solomon wisdom</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2772">200</xref></sup> But it did not become manifest [to others]. And where did it become manifest? Further on, [where it is said], <italic>for they saw that the wisdom of the Eternal was in him, to do justice</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2773">201</xref></sup> etc.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It is correct to interpret that with his three references in this verse to the Divine Presence, Moses alludes to the three Sanctuaries. Of the First Sanctuary he says, <italic>He shall dwell in safety by him</italic>, similar to what is stated, <italic>and the Glory of the Eternal filled the House</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2774">202</xref></sup> Of the Second Sanctuary he says, <italic>He covereth him all the day</italic>, since the Divine Presence did not dwell there,<sup><xref rid="fn2775">203</xref></sup> but only sheltered and protected it. Or it may be that it [the Divine Presence] literally &#x201C;hovered&#x201D; over it, as is mentioned in Pirkei Heichaloth.<sup><xref rid="fn2776">204</xref></sup> [The third reference,] <italic>and He dwelleth between his shoulders</italic> alludes to the days of the Messiah, for <italic>at that time they shall call Jerusalem The throne of the Eternal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2777">205</xref></sup> It is interpreted in the Sifre in this manner.<sup><xref rid="fn2778">206</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. &#x2018;MIMEGED&#x2019; OF HEAVEN. &#x201C;<italic>Meged</italic> is an expression for dainty food and sweets. 14. &#x2018;UMIMEGED&#x2019; OF THE FRUITS OF THE SUN &#x2014; for Joseph&#x2019;s land was exposed to the sun and it sweetened the fruit. &#x2018;GERESH YERACHIM&#x2019; (THE YIELD OF THE MOONS). There are fruits which the moon ripens; they are cucumbers and melons. &#x2018;<italic>Geresh yerachim</italic>&#x2019; &#x2014; fruits which the earth &#x2018;puts forth&#x2019; and produces &#x2018;from month to month.&#x2019; &#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. And if so, <italic>with &#x2018;pri m&#x2019;gadim&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2779">207</xref></sup> will mean &#x201C;with sweet fruits.&#x201D; Thus Moses blessed Joseph that his land would benefit from the sweetness of heaven which will be from the dew, and that it would be blessed from the deep that couches under his land, becoming <italic>fountains and depths, springing forth in valleys and hills</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2780">208</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is possible that the fruits [themselves] are called <italic>m&#x2019;gadim</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2781">209</xref></sup> and he thus says that &#x201C;Joseph&#x2019;s land is blessed of the fruits of heaven, namely the dew&#x201D; &#x2014; since sweet fruits result from dew, therefore the fruit is called <italic>meged</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;and his land shall also be blessed from the deep beneath.&#x201D; Moses&#x2019; blessing is similar to that of Jacob who said, <italic>with blessing of heaven above, blessings of the deep that coucheth beneath</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2782">210</xref></sup> And the meaning of <italic>geresh yerachim</italic> is the fruits which are given forth month by month, for all trees blossom and bud in their [respective] seasons <italic>that they might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2783">211</xref></sup> This is the sense of the verse, <italic>it shall bring forth new fruit every month</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2784">212</xref></sup> meaning that in the particular months a certain fruit will become timely before [the fruits of] all other trees.</p>
<p>16. AND FOR THE PRECIOUS THINGS OF THE EARTH &#x2018;U&#x2019;MLO&#x2019;OH&#x2019; (AND THE FULNESS THEREOF). This means: &#x201C;for the precious things of the land of the plains and of which it is full,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2785">213</xref></sup> for he mentioned the mountains and the hills previously<sup><xref rid="fn2786">214</xref></sup> and now he speaks of the valley<sup><xref rid="fn2787">215</xref></sup> and the plains, according to the words of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra. In my opinion, <italic>the precious things of the earth and the fulness thereof</italic> is identical with the <italic>blessings of the breasts, and of the womb</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2782">210</xref></sup> for all humans and all creeping things that are alive are called &#x201C;the fulness of the earth.&#x201D; Similarly, <italic>let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2788">216</xref></sup> <italic>Surely I will fill thee with men, as with the locust</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2789">217</xref></sup> This blessing is thus like <italic>Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy land, and the fruit of thy cattle</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2790">218</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x2018;URTZON&#x2019; (AND THE WILL OF) HIM THAT DWELT IN THE BUSH. This is connected with above [i.e., with the word <italic>umimeged</italic> at the beginning of this verse, where the prefix <italic>mem</italic> means &#x201C;from.&#x201D; Here, too, the word <italic>urtzon</italic> is equivalent to] <italic>u&#x2019;mirtzon</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;and from the Will of Him that dwelt in the bush.&#x201D; Now <italic>the Glorious Name</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2791">219</xref></sup> is called &#x201C;Him that dwelt in the bush&#x201D; because it was there that He first appeared to Moses,<sup><xref rid="fn2792">220</xref></sup> and He dwelt many days on Mount Sinai which is a place of bushes<sup><xref rid="fn2793">221</xref></sup> and from Sinai He came and dwelt in Israel. And the sense of the verse is that Joseph&#x2019;s land be blessed from the Will of G-d, similar in meaning to these expressions: <italic>&#x2018;ratzitha&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>Thou hast been favorable</italic>) <italic>unto Thy land;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2794">222</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;v&#x2019;ertzeh&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and I will take pleasure</italic>) <italic>in it, and I will be glorified</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2795">223</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x2018;TAVOTHAH&#x2019; (SHE SHALL COME) UPON THE HEAD OF JOSEPH. The meaning of <italic>tavothah</italic> [in the feminine form] is that this <italic>brachah</italic> [&#x201C;blessing&#x201D; &#x2014; a feminine noun] <italic>shall come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the head of him that is prince among the brethren</italic>. Or the meaning thereof may be: &#x201C;Let the Will of Him that dwelt in the bush come upon the head of Joseph&#x201D; [the feminine <italic>tavothah</italic> referring to the masculine <italic>ratzon</italic>]. Now, do not wonder that [the masculine <italic>ratzon</italic>] &#x201C;will&#x201D; is described with the feminine [<italic>tavothah</italic> &#x2014; she shall come], for it [&#x201C;will&#x201D;], in the Aramaic language is indeed so [feminine, as it is said] <italic>&#x2018;ure&#x2019;uth&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>and the pleasure of</italic>) <italic>the king</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2796">224</xref></sup> And in the language of the Sages<sup><xref rid="fn2797">225</xref></sup> we find the expression &#x201C;<italic>cheftzath</italic> (the desire) of his soul&#x201D; [again a feminine usage].</p>
<p>And by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], the verse states that the Will<sup><xref rid="fn2798">226</xref></sup> &#x2014; that is, the Divine manifestation that dwelt in the bush &#x2014; shall come upon the head of Joseph, for with Her he will raise up the head. It mentions the Will in the construct form [saying <italic>urtzon</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;and the Will of&#x201D;] in place of the independent form of the noun [i.e., <italic>v&#x2019;ratzon</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;and the Will&#x201D;]. There are many such cases [in Scripture]. Or it may be that the word <italic>urtzon</italic> is in construct with the aforementioned Glorious Name [<italic>Blessed of &#x2018;the Eternal&#x2019; is his land</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn2799">227</xref></sup> Thus this verse means: &#x201C;and the Will of the Eternal that dwelt in the bush shall come upon the head of Joseph.&#x201D; This is like the blessing of Jacob who said <italic>From the G-d of thy father, Who shall help thee, and the Almighty, Who shall bless thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2782">210</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. &#x2018;B&#x2019;CHOR&#x2019; (THE FIRSTLING) OF HIS BULLOCK, MAJESTY IS HIS. &#x201C;<italic>B&#x2019;chor</italic> (firstborn) is sometimes used to denote greatness and sovereignty, as it is said, <italic>I also will appoint him</italic> [David] <italic>first born</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2800">228</xref></sup> Similarly, <italic>Israel is My son, My first born</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2801">229</xref></sup> [Hence, this verse means:] The strength of the king who will come forth from him [Joseph] &#x2014; namely, Joshua &#x2014; will be as great as that of an ox to subdue many kings. <italic>And his horns are the horns of the wild-ox</italic>. The ox has great strength but its horns are not beautiful; the wild-ox, on the other hand, has beautiful horns but its strength is not great. Moses then ascribed to Joshua the strength of an ox and the beauty of the horns of the wild-ox. <italic>And they are the ten thousands of Ephraim</italic> &#x2014; those who are gored are the myriads whom Joshua, a descendant of Ephraim, slew. <italic>And they are the thousands of Menasheh</italic> &#x2014; the thousands whom Gideon [a descendant of Menasheh] slew of Midian, as it is said, <italic>Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2802">230</xref></sup> Many thousands are enumerated there.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2803">231</xref></sup> Thus far the language of Rashi. But this interpretation leaves the verse in disorder. Since the expression <italic>his horns are the horns of the wild-ox</italic> is a description of the <italic>firstling of</italic> the <italic>bullock</italic>, namely Joshua, how could it be said that he [a descendant of Ephraim] gore with them [the horns] <italic>the thousands of Menasheh</italic>, the victims of Gideon [a descendant of Menasheh]? And the language of the Sifre is as follows:<sup><xref rid="fn2804">232</xref></sup> &#x201C;Since Scripture has not made clear to us how many Canaanites were slain by Joshua, it states <italic>Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2802">230</xref></sup> &#x2014; all one hundred and thirty-five thousand.<sup><xref rid="fn2803">231</xref></sup> Therefore it is stated, <italic>and they are the thousands of Menasheh. &#x201D;</italic> The intent of the Rabbis is to interpret that the phrase <italic>with them he shall gore the peoples all of them, even the ends of the earth</italic> is also an allusion to Joshua. The verse says that these <italic>ends of the earth</italic> which he [the tribe of Joseph] will gore, are the ten thousands that Ephraim &#x2014; meaning Joshua &#x2014; slew, and they are the [same] thousands slain afterwards by Menasheh. For Joshua slew them all [the nations], and of their descendants who arose after them Menasheh slew thousands from among them. Similarly it is taught there [in the Sifre]:<sup><xref rid="fn2804">232</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>With them he shall gore the peoples all of them</italic>. But what [nations] did Joshua capture? Did he not subdue only thirty-one kings? The verse teaches [us] that Joshua subdued kings and rulers that were from one end of the world to the other.<sup><xref rid="fn2805">233</xref></sup> <italic>All of them, even the ends of the earth</italic>. But which lands did Joshua capture? Did he not conquer only this small portion [of the earth]? Only [this is to teach us] that all the kings that he subdued were sovereigns and rulers&#x201D; [rather than insignificant, powerless figures].</p>
<p>In line with the plain meaning of Scripture [the verse states]: Because Moses blessed Joseph with the increase of the field, he compared him [here] to an ox, for <italic>much increase is by the strength of the ox</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2806">234</xref></sup> He further stated that Joseph will be the firstborn that will beget the beauty of majesty &#x2014; this being an allusion to Joshua, <italic>the first of all the house of Joseph</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2807">235</xref></sup> &#x2014; and that greatness and majesty will be his. <italic>His horns are the horns of the wild-ox</italic> &#x2014; of the aforementioned ox &#x2014; and with his horns, <italic>he shall gore the peoples all of them, even the ends of the earth</italic>. And he further states that his horns &#x2014; which are two &#x2014; <italic>are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Menasheh</italic>, the right horn [the stronger one] representing Ephraim and the left [the weaker one] representing Menasheh. Thus he mentioned in his blessing that they will become numerous, tribes consisting of myriads and thousands, similar to the expression, <italic>the myriads of thousands of Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2808">236</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. REJOICE, ZEBULUN, IN THY GOING OUT &#x2014; that is, when you journey in merchant-ships. He alludes to [what Jacob said of Zebulun that] <italic>he shall dwell at the shore of the sea</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2809">237</xref></sup> And you <italic>Issachar</italic> [rejoice] <italic>in thy tents</italic>, thus intimating that Issachar <italic>saw a resting-place that it was good, and</italic> his <italic>land that it was pleasant</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2810">238</xref></sup> in accord with Jacob&#x2019;s blessing.</p>
<p>20. BLESSED BE HE THAT ENLARGETH GAD. &#x201C;This teaches that Gad&#x2019;s border was enlarged toward the east.&#x201D; [Since his territory was east of the Jordan it could be extended towards the east.] This is Rashi&#x2019;s language from the Sifre.<sup><xref rid="fn2811">239</xref></sup> And Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra commented that because Moses likened Gad to a lion [<italic>he dwelleth as a lioness</italic>], he said, &#x201C;Blessed be He Who enlarges Gad, Who gives him strength so that whoever [any enemy] sees him will flee him, and no one will trouble him.&#x201D; The correct interpretation is that it refers to Gad&#x2019;s inheritance, for the two tribes [Reuben and Gad] that took their inheritance on the east bank of the Jordan did not take it by the lot. Instead Moses gave them the entire kingdoms of Sihon and Og<sup><xref rid="fn2812">240</xref></sup> and their inheritance <italic>was broader as</italic> it <italic>wound about higher</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2813">241</xref></sup> than all the tribes. Moses did not mention this [blessing] in the case of Reuben, for his prayer was sufficient.<sup><xref rid="fn2734">162</xref></sup> It is also possible that the children of Gad took more territory than the children of Reuben for they were mighty and therefore Moses gave them the entire [eastern] border. The cities which they built<sup><xref rid="fn2814">242</xref></sup> were also more numerous than those of Reuben.<sup><xref rid="fn2815">243</xref></sup> In addition, it was the Gadites who first requested that land [east of the Jordan as their inheritance] as I have explained there,<sup><xref rid="fn2816">244</xref></sup> and thus they were the cause of this expansion.</p>
<p>23. O NAPHTALI, SATISFIED WITH FAVOR. &#x201C;[This means] that his land satisfied every desire of its inhabitants.&#x201D; This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. The correct interpretation is that it is connected with <italic>the Glorious Name</italic> [mentioned later in the verse: <italic>and full with the blessing of &#x2018;the Eternal&#x2019;</italic>], the verse stating that &#x201C;Naphtali is satisfied and full of the Will of <italic>the Glorious Name</italic> and His blessing.&#x201D; But in the Midrash of Rabbi Nechunya ben Hakanah<sup><xref rid="fn2817">245</xref></sup> the Rabbis commented on this verse: &#x201C;Rabbi Amora said: What is the meaning of this verse, <italic>And full with the blessing of the Eternal; &#x2018;yerashah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>possess thou</italic>) <italic>the sea and the south?</italic> Thus said Moses: If you will walk in my statutes you will inherit the World to Come which is likened to the sea, as it is said, <italic>and broader than the sea</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2818">246</xref></sup> and this world which is likened to the south, as it is said, <italic>for that thou hast set me in the land of the &#x2018;negev&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2819">247</xref></sup> [that is, <italic>a dry land</italic>], and is rendered by the Targum: &#x2018;the southern land.&#x2019; And why is it written <italic>yerashah</italic> [&#x2019;possess thou&#x2019; &#x2014; in the feminine], it should have said <italic>yerash</italic> [in the masculine]? Because even the Holy One, blessed be He, is included [in Naphtali&#x2019;s inheritance], for the word <italic>yerashah</italic> consists of two words: <italic>resh Y-ah</italic> (possess G-d). To what may this be compared? To a king who had two treasures [i.e., the two worlds], and set one of them aside. At the end of many days he said to his son, &#x2018;Take the contents of these two treasures.&#x2019; The son said, &#x2018;Perhaps he will not give me the one he set aside.&#x2019; Thereupon the father said, to him, &#x2018;Take everything.&#x2019; It is this which is written <italic>&#x2018;yerashah&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>possess thou</italic>) <italic>the sea and the south</italic> &#x2014; <italic>Y-ah resh</italic>. Everything is given you &#x2014; if only you keep His ways&#x0021;&#x201D; They have further said:<sup><xref rid="fn2820">248</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And full with the blessing of the Eternal; possess thou the sea and the south</italic>. The &#x2018;sea&#x2019; is an allusion to the Torah alone, as it is said, <italic>and broader than the sea</italic>,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2818">246</xref></sup> and [so they continue] the entire Midrash there. If so, the secret of the verse is as follows: &#x201C;Naphtali is satisfied with the favor saturated by the blessing of the Eternal, which is &#x2018;the sea&#x2019; combined in all [and comprised] of all.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2821">249</xref></sup> It is similar to what Scripture states, <italic>All the rivers run into the sea</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2822">250</xref></sup> this being &#x201C;the house of the King.&#x201D; This is like the parable of those who seek to see the king and ask, &#x201C;Where is the house of the king?&#x201D; Then [after finding the house] they ask, &#x201C;Where is the king?&#x201D; And even this world which is parched and dry of the favor [of G-d in comparison to the World to Come], Naphtali will inherit with <italic>Y-ah</italic> [as the word <italic>yerashah</italic> &#x2014; <italic>resh Y-ah</italic> &#x2014; indicates]. The student learned in the mysteries of the Cabala will understand.</p>
<p>24. BLESSED &#x2018;MIBANIM&#x2019; BE ASHER. If the letter <italic>mem</italic> [in the word <italic>mibanim</italic>] serves to signify greater status [meaning that Asher is singled out from among the tribes for greater blessing] as indicated by the <italic>mem</italic> in these expressions: <italic>blessed &#x2018;minashim&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>from among all other women</italic>) <italic>shall Jael be;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2823">251</xref></sup> <italic>they</italic> [the ordinances of the Eternal] <italic>are to be desired &#x2018;mizahav&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>more than gold</italic>), <italic>yea &#x2018;umipaz rav&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>even more than much fine gold</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn2824">252</xref></sup> and other similar expressions &#x2014; then one may wonder: how could Moses diminish the rest of the tribes by saying that Asher be blessed more than all the sons of Jacob? Moreover [if such was his intent], his blessing was not fulfilled, for it did not come to pass. And Rashi wrote: &#x201C;I have seen in the Sifre:<sup><xref rid="fn2811">239</xref></sup> &#x2018;You will find none of the tribes as blessed with children<sup><xref rid="fn2825">253</xref></sup> as Asher.&#x2019; But I know not how this was so.&#x201D; Now, our Rabbis meant to explain <italic>blessed &#x2018;mibanim&#x2019;</italic> that Asher be blessed with the many children that he will beget, similar to the usage of the letter <italic>mem</italic> in the expression <italic>Blessed of the Eternal be his land, &#x2018;mimeged&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>of the precious things</italic>) <italic>of heaven, &#x2018;mital&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>of the dew</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2826">254</xref></sup> Therefore, the Rabbis said that Moses blessed all the rest of the tribes with strength or with their inheritance, and Asher alone was blessed with children. And our textual version of the Sifre<sup><xref rid="fn2811">239</xref></sup> reads: &#x201C;You will find no one who was as blessed with children as Asher.&#x201D; But how this blessing was fulfilled has not been explained. Perhaps it relates to what is written in [the Book of] Chronicles, <italic>All these were the children of Asher, heads of the fathers&#x2019; houses, choice and mighty men of valor, chief of the princes. And the number of them reckoned by genealogy for service in war was twenty and six thousand men</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2827">255</xref></sup> Such praise is not mentioned there about the rest of the tribes.</p>
<p>In line with the simple meaning of Scripture, <italic>Blessed &#x2018;mibanim&#x2019; be Asher</italic> is similar to the blessing <italic>let him be the favored of his brethren</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2828">256</xref></sup> the verse stating that Asher be blessed by all the sons of Jacob their father and be favored by all his brothers. The reason is that his land is rich and from there will come all <italic>royal dainties</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2829">257</xref></sup> for all the tribes, and they will all constantly say, &#x201C;May G-d bless this land which brings forth such fruits.&#x201D; The letter <italic>mem</italic> in the word <italic>mibanim</italic> will be like the <italic>mem</italic> in: <italic>&#x2018;mei&#x2019;Hashem&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>&#x2018;from&#x2019; the Eternal</italic>) <italic>proceedeth the thing;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2830">258</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;mei&#x2019;E-il&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>&#x2018;from&#x2019; the G-d of</italic>) <italic>thy father</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2831">259</xref></sup> [so that our verse means: &#x201C;Blessed will be Asher &#x2018;from&#x2019; the sons&#x201D; of Jacob].</p>
<p>And Onkelos translated: &#x201C;The blessing of Asher will be from the blessings of the sons&#x201D; [of Jacob]. It appears that Onkelos meant to say that all of the tribes will come to Asher to buy oil, <italic>and Judah, and the Land of Israel</italic>, will be his <italic>merchants</italic> for <italic>wheat of Minnith, and balsam, and honey, and oil</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2832">260</xref></sup> and all <italic>choice fruits of the land</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2833">261</xref></sup> all of which they will bring to sell him, and they will buy oil. Thus Asher will be blessed with all the delicacies available to all the tribes, this being the sense of the expression <italic>favored of his brethren</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2828">256</xref></sup> for they will sell to him and buy from him what they desire. Then I found in Bereshith Rabbah:<sup><xref rid="fn2834">262</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And Leah said: &#x2018;For my happiness&#x0021; for daughters will call me happy,&#x2019;</italic> [<italic>and she called his name Asher</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn2835">263</xref></sup> Rabbi Levi said: In all his days Asher never lodged in an inn.<sup><xref rid="fn2836">264</xref></sup> Asher inherited palaces on the heights, [heights great in area] more than the land inherited by Judah. <italic>The sons of Asher: Imnah, and Ishvah and Beriah, and Serah their sister</italic>. [<italic>And the sons of Beriah: Heber, and Malchiel</italic>,] <italic>who was the father of Birzaith</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2837">265</xref></sup> Rabbi Levi and Rabbi Simon said [with reference to the name <italic>Birzaith</italic> which contains the word <italic>zayith</italic> &#x2014; olive] that the daughters of Asher were beautiful, and they were married to priests<sup><xref rid="fn2838">266</xref></sup> who were anointed with olive oil etc.&#x201D;</p>
<p>25. IRON AND BRASS SHALL BE THY BARS. Asher was at the end of the Land of Israel, as it is written with reference to his inheritance, <italic>and it reached to Carmel westward</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2839">267</xref></sup> and it is further stated, <italic>and its goings out were at the sea</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2840">268</xref></sup> And again it is said, <italic>Asher drove not out the inhabitants of Acco</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2841">269</xref></sup> which is located on the Great Sea [i.e., the Mediterranean], as the Rabbis have said:<sup><xref rid="fn2842">270</xref></sup> &#x201C;At first [the ocean] advanced till Acco, and the second time till Japho.&#x201D; And if so, Asher&#x2019;s land was like the bars of the Land of Israel. Therefore, Moses said, <italic>Iron and brass shall be thy bars</italic>, that he will have [so to speak] <italic>doors of brass</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2843">271</xref></sup> and iron bars, and the entire Land will be locked with them. This is an intimation that G-d will protect the whole Land from <italic>the enemy and the avenger</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2844">272</xref></sup> Or perhaps the verse states that strangers will not come to plunder the oil, for it will be transported from his land to the whole world in merchant ships.</p>
<p>AND AS THY DAYS &#x2018;DAVECHA.&#x2019; Concerning this word [<italic>davecha</italic>] it seems to me that it is like <italic>zavecha</italic> [meaning: &#x201C;so shall &#x2018;thy flowing&#x2019; oil be&#x201D; &#x2014; as explained further on], for these letters [<italic>daleth</italic> and <italic>zayin</italic>] are regularly used interchangeably [in our language]. Thus it says, &#x2018;<italic>madheivah</italic>&#x2019; (<italic>the exactress of gold</italic>) <italic>ceased</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2845">273</xref></sup> [written with a <italic>daleth</italic>] in place of <italic>mazheivah</italic> [written with a <italic>zayin</italic>, from the word <italic>zahav</italic> &#x2014; gold]. The entire Aramaic language follows that rule [of <italic>daleth &#x2014; zayin</italic> interchangeability] in every usage of [the Hebrew words] <italic>zevichah</italic> (slaughtering),<sup><xref rid="fn2846">274</xref></sup> and also in every usage of <italic>zechirah</italic> (remembrance),<sup><xref rid="fn2847">275</xref></sup> and similarly, <italic>zahav</italic> (gold),<sup><xref rid="fn2848">276</xref></sup> <italic>zakan</italic> (beard),<sup><xref rid="fn2849">277</xref></sup> <italic>zanav</italic> (tail),<sup><xref rid="fn2850">278</xref></sup> &#x2018;<italic>zrei</italic>&#x2019; (<italic>scatter</italic>) <italic>away</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2851">279</xref></sup> and many others, [in each of which, Aramaic substitutes a <italic>daleth</italic> for the Hebrew <italic>zayin</italic>]. So also for [the Hebrew words] <italic>zavah</italic> (a woman suffering a flux), the female flow, or the male flux [all are rendered in Aramaic] <italic>davah</italic>. Their entire language constantly interchanges the <italic>zayin</italic> with the <italic>daleth</italic> in this way. Thus [the Hebrew] <italic>my days are &#x2018;nizachu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>extinct</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn2852">280</xref></sup> is in place of [the Aramaic] <italic>nidachu</italic>. So also &#x2018;<italic>zachalti</italic>&#x2019; (<italic>I feared</italic>) <italic>and was afraid</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2853">281</xref></sup> is like <italic>dachalti</italic>. Scripture thus states here: &#x201C;and as your days so shall <italic>zavecha</italic> be,&#x201D; meaning &#x201C;that your land will &#x2018;flow&#x2019; with the aforementioned oil, and you will dip your foot in it all your days forever.&#x201D;</p>
<p>What they<sup><xref rid="fn2854">282</xref></sup> have interpreted is also possible &#x2014; and it is correct &#x2014; that the word <italic>davecha</italic> [spelled: <italic>daleth, beth aleph, kaph</italic>] is a reversed [and hence synonymous] form of <italic>da&#x2019;avon</italic> (<italic>languishing</italic>) <italic>of soul</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2855">283</xref></sup> [spelled: <italic>daleth, aleph, beth, nun</italic>]. Scripture calls the days of old age <italic>da&#x2019;avon</italic> (languishing) for they are <italic>the days of evil</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2856">284</xref></sup> and pain; and it calls the days of youth <italic>his days</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2857">285</xref></sup> since they are his to rejoice in them and cheer his heart.<sup><xref rid="fn2858">286</xref></sup> Thus the meaning of the verse is as follows: &#x201C;and as the days of your youth so shall be the days of your old age,&#x201D; this being an allusion to Asher&#x2019;s security and honor <italic>while the earth remaineth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2859">287</xref></sup> Now, I have seen in [the rendering of] the Targum Yerushalmi:<sup><xref rid="fn2860">288</xref></sup> &#x201C;as the days of their youth, so shall their old age be.&#x201D; This is as I have explained.</p>
<h1>34</h1>
<p>1. AND THE ETERNAL SHOWED HIM [MOSES] ALL THE LAND &#x2014; all the Land of Israel beyond the Jordan [westward] &#x2014; and then the verse states that He showed him <italic>even Gilead, as far as Dan</italic>. Now Moses was in the territory of Reuben, <italic>and half the hill-country of Gilead, and the cities thereof</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2861">289</xref></sup> belonged to the children of Reuben,<sup><xref rid="fn2861">289</xref></sup> and the other half belonged to Menasheh.<sup><xref rid="fn2862">290</xref></sup> Therefore the verse before us must mean that [G-d showed Moses the whole Land] &#x201C;from Gilead<sup><xref rid="fn2863">291</xref></sup> as far as Dan.&#x201D; Or it may be that there was [a place called] Gilead in the Lebanon in the Land of Israel, as it is written, <italic>thou art Gilead unto Me, the head of Lebanon</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2864">292</xref></sup> The verse mentions <italic>as far as Dan</italic> which is at the extremity of the border of the Land of Israel, as it is written, <italic>Go now to and fro through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2865">293</xref></sup> It mentions <italic>the land of Ephraim and Menasheh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2866">294</xref></sup> which were in the northern part of the Land of Israel, and the land of Judah was to the south, as it is written, <italic>Judah shall abide in his border on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their border on the north</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2867">295</xref></sup> for Judah took all the south of the Land of Israel from the Jordan to the sea, and Dan took the north-west. It mentions Naphtali<sup><xref rid="fn2866">294</xref></sup> who was on the east, near Judah,<sup><xref rid="fn2868">296</xref></sup> but it does not mention Asher and Issachar, for they were among Ephraim and Menasheh, as it is written [about the borders of Ephraim and Menasheh], <italic>and they reached to Asher on the north, and to Issachar on the east</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2869">297</xref></sup> It did not mention Simeon, for <italic>their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Judah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2870">298</xref></sup> nor that of Benjamin whose <italic>border of their lot went out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2871">299</xref></sup> already mentioned near them. It states <italic>as far as the western sea</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2866">294</xref></sup> which alludes to Zebulun who dwelt <italic>at the shore of the sea</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2872">300</xref></sup> or it may be that [Zebulun] is included [in the statement that G-d showed him] <italic>the south, and the plain</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2873">301</xref></sup> [since the territory of Zebulun was in the plain at the sea]. It mentions <italic>the valley of Jericho</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2873">301</xref></sup> because it is a deep valley, not visible from the top of the mountain [where Moses stood], but G-d showed it to him miraculously. In general then He showed him the entire inheritance of Israel, as it is written, <italic>This is the Land which I swore</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2874">302</xref></sup> Our Rabbis in the Sifre<sup><xref rid="fn2875">303</xref></sup> have elucidated about these places mentioned in Scripture.</p>
<p>Now, the reason for this sight which He showed him was because the Land of Israel is <italic>full of all good things</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2876">304</xref></sup> and is <italic>the beauty of all lands</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2877">305</xref></sup> And since the great love with which Moses our teacher loved Israel was manifest to Him, He made him rejoice by <italic>beholding</italic> the abundant goodness <italic>with his eyes</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2878">306</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. WHOM THE ETERNAL KNEW FACE TO FACE. &#x201C;[This means] that Moses&#x2019; heart was familiar with Him and he spoke with Him whenever he wished, as it is stated, <italic>and now I will go up unto the Eternal;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2879">307</xref></sup> <italic>Stay ye, that I may hear what the Eternal will command concerning you</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2880">308</xref></sup> This is Rashi&#x2019;s language. But it is not correct, for in that case [if the verse extols Moses&#x2019; familiarity with G-d] it should have said, &#x201C;who knew the Eternal face to face.&#x201D; Rather, this is similar to the expressions: <italic>and I know thee by name;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2881">309</xref></sup> <italic>Yet Thou hast said: I know thee by name</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2882">310</xref></sup> The verse thus states <italic>that there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel</italic> whom G-d so exalted as to communicate with him <italic>face to face</italic>. Similarly, <italic>Eternal, what is man that &#x2018;vateida&#x2019;eihu&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2883">311</xref></sup> means &#x201C;that You should bestow honor upon him by giving heed to him,&#x201D; like <italic>What is man, that Thou shouldest magnify him?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2884">312</xref></sup> It is possible that [this is the intent of the verse]: because when two persons see one another face to face, they become acquainted with each other through that meeting, Scripture therefore says <italic>whom the Eternal knew face to face</italic> [indicating that G-d and Moses were like two people who know one another well; however, Scripture said only that G-d knew Moses, not vice-versa], since out of respect to the Most Exalted it did not want to mention that Moses also knew Him that way. Now, do not be surprised that Scripture speaks in praise of Moses saying, <italic>Whom the Eternal knew face to face</italic>, and it also states, <italic>And the Eternal spoke unto Moses face to face</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2885">313</xref></sup> and with reference to all Israel it is likewise stated [the very same praise], <italic>The Eternal spoke with you face to face&#x0021;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2886">314</xref></sup> For there [in the case of all Israel] he explained <italic>out of the midst of the fire</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2886">314</xref></sup> meaning to say that they heard His voice <italic>out of the midst of the fire</italic> only, and they did not actually see His Presence. Similarly he explained, <italic>and upon earth He made thee to see His great fire, and thou didst hear His words out of the midst of the fire</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2887">315</xref></sup></p>
<p>And by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], the verse here states that G-d knew Moses face to face [to a degree that it was possible] to cleave to Him whenever the spirit<sup><xref rid="fn2888">316</xref></sup> came upon Moses our teacher. It was so at the time of the Giving of the Torah, but the people perceived only the Voice out of the midst of the fire.<sup><xref rid="fn2889">317</xref></sup> Thus Scripture explained that all prophecies of Moses were as on the day that the Torah was given, while the rest of the prophets had <italic>the hand of the Eternal</italic> upon them.<sup><xref rid="fn2890">318</xref></sup> Understand this.</p>
<p>11. IN ALL THE SIGNS. This is connected with the [preceding] verse, <italic>And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel &#x2014; in all the signs</italic> etc. Or the verse may be stating that the Eternal knew Moses <italic>face to face</italic> through the signs and wonders as they were all done with His Great Name [i.e., the Tetragrammaton], just as he said, <italic>and He brought thee out with His Presence, with His great power</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2891">319</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now, I have already explained<sup><xref rid="fn2892">320</xref></sup> that <italic>signs</italic> are the matters about which Moses warned [the Egyptians] before they took place, such as, <italic>by tomorrow shall this sign be</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2893">321</xref></sup> and the term is used for any phenomenon which the prophet forecasts saying, &#x201C;Thus will it come and happen in the future.&#x201D; <italic>Wonders</italic> imply a change in the natural order, such as <italic>the rod which was turned to a serpent</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2894">322</xref></sup> Now, signs and wonders were also performed for the rest of the prophets, such as Elijah and Elisha who brought about many wonders [why is then the special significance attached to the signs and wonders of Moses]&#x0021; However, the distinction of those [signs and wonders] of Moses our teacher is explained by the Rabbis in the Midrash:<sup><xref rid="fn2895">323</xref></sup> &#x201C;All the prophets wrought miracles through prayer, such as the [halting of the] sun for Joshua,<sup><xref rid="fn2896">324</xref></sup> and [the revival of] the Zarephathite woman&#x2019;s son,<sup><xref rid="fn2897">325</xref></sup> and the withholding of the rain by Elijah,<sup><xref rid="fn2898">326</xref></sup> and the [revival of the] Shunammite woman&#x2019;s son by Elisha.<sup><xref rid="fn2899">327</xref></sup> But Moses performed [signs and miracles] immediately [without prayer].&#x201D; Yet this Midrash is not clear.</p>
<p>And the Rabbi [Moshe ben Maimon] stated in Moreh Nebuchim<sup><xref rid="fn2900">328</xref></sup> that &#x201C;the distinction of Moses our teacher was that he spoke [publicly] <italic>to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2901">329</xref></sup> <italic>and in the sight of all Israel</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2902">330</xref></sup> for they [his signs and wonders] were in full view of his opponents and his followers. The rest of the prophets, however, performed them [the signs and wonders] in the presence of a few individuals, as it is said, <italic>Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha had done</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2903">331</xref></sup> But this does not appear to me to be correct [for the following reasons]: The withholding of the rain by Elijah &#x2014; both the cessation and the coming<sup><xref rid="fn2904">332</xref></sup> &#x2014; were very much publicized. It [the cessation of rain] was by his [Elijah&#x2019;s] decree [rather than through prayer] as it is said, <italic>As the Eternal, the G-d of Israel, liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2898">326</xref></sup> And during its three year duration, the matter became very well known,<sup><xref rid="fn2905">333</xref></sup> and heard among the nations for it is written, <italic>there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord</italic> [Ahab] <italic>hath not sent to seek thee</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2906">334</xref></sup> And the climax of the affair occurred publicly in the presence of his opponents and his followers at one assembly, as it is written, <italic>Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto Mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty</italic> etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2907">335</xref></sup> So, too, the halting of the sun for Joshua was certainly in view of all Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn2908">336</xref></sup> and all the kings of Canaan saw it &#x2014; those who fought against him [on that day] as well as the remaining ones. Our Rabbis also mention that people saw it from one end of the earth to the other.<sup><xref rid="fn2909">337</xref></sup> Scripture also lauds it exceedingly, saying, <italic>And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the Eternal hearkened to the voice of a man</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2910">338</xref></sup> The splitting of the Jordan, like the splitting of the Red Sea, was not done for individuals, but for all Israel, and furthermore it is written, <italic>And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, that were beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, that were by the sea, heard that the Eternal had dried up the waters of the Jordan</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2911">339</xref></sup></p>
<p>But in line with the simple meaning of Scripture it is all tied and connected [with the preceding verse, <italic>And there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses</italic> etc.], Scripture stating that no prophet has ever appeared in Israel like Moses <italic>whom the Eternal knew face to face</italic> and to perform signs and wonders with a mighty hand and great terror like Moses. If they brought about some of them [the signs and the wonders], they did not approach the number or great distinction of those [performed by Moses], for there was never a day like Sinai, before it or after it. So, also, the signs of the prophets did not extend for as long a period as did those of Moses, peace be upon him &#x2014; for the sign of the manna continued steadily for forty years,<sup><xref rid="fn2912">340</xref></sup> as did the pillar of fire and the cloud,<sup><xref rid="fn2913">341</xref></sup> and, in the opinion of our Rabbis, so did the well,<sup><xref rid="fn2914">342</xref></sup> and the quail.<sup><xref rid="fn2915">343</xref></sup> And their walking through <italic>the great and dreadful wilderness, wherein were serpents, fiery serpents, and scorpions, and thirsty ground where was no water</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2916">344</xref></sup> and yet they lacked nothing.<sup><xref rid="fn2917">345</xref></sup></p>
<p>By way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], the verse is stating that the signs and wonders of Moses were done <italic>face to face</italic>, as I have explained.<sup><xref rid="fn2918">346</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. AND IN ALL THE MIGHTY HAND. This alludes to the division of the Red Sea concerning which it is said, <italic>And Israel saw the great hand</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2919">347</xref></sup> AND IN ALL THE GREAT TERROR. This is a reference to the Revelation<sup><xref rid="fn2920">348</xref></sup> concerning which it is stated <italic>and that His fear may be before you</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2921">349</xref></sup> He mentioned concerning these [two events] that they were done <italic>in the sight of all Israel</italic>, because he had already referred to all that was done <italic>to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2922">350</xref></sup> And in the Sifre it is stated:<sup><xref rid="fn2923">351</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>And in all the mighty hand</italic> &#x2014; this refers to the smiting of the firstborn, about which it is said, <italic>for by a mighty hand shall he send them away</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2924">352</xref></sup> <italic>And in all the great terror</italic> &#x2014; this alludes to the division of the Red Sea. Another interpretation: <italic>And in all the great terror</italic> &#x2014; this is the Giving of the Torah.&#x201D;</p>
<p>And by way of the Truth, [the mystic teachings of the Cabala], <italic>the mighty hand</italic> is the attribute of justice, similar to the expressions: <italic>the hand of the Eternal was upon me;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2925">353</xref></sup> <italic>for the hand of the Eternal hath wrought this</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2926">354</xref></sup> Therefore it is said with reference to [His] judgment, <italic>for the hand of the Eternal is gone forth against me</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2927">355</xref></sup> And <italic>the great terror</italic> is the attribute of mercy, similar to what is written, <italic>Him shall ye sanctify, and let Him be your fear</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2928">356</xref></sup> The Rabbis in the Sifre<sup><xref rid="fn2923">351</xref></sup> meant this when referring to the smiting of the firstborn [which was done by <italic>the mighty hand</italic>, alluding to the attribute of justice] and the division of the Red Sea [which is alluded to in the phrase <italic>and in all the great terror</italic> referring to the attribute of mercy], for concerning them it is written, <italic>to make Thyself a Glorious Name</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2929">357</xref></sup></p>
<p>WHICH MOSES &#x2018;ASAH&#x2019; (WROUGHT) &#x2014; for he prepared and displayed it in the sight of all the people. It is similar to the expressions: <italic>and the souls that they &#x2018;asu&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>made</italic>) <italic>in Haran;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2930">358</xref></sup> <italic>and he hastened &#x2018;la&#x2019;asoth&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>to make</italic>) <italic>it;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2931">359</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;la&#x2019;asoth&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>to make</italic>) <italic>the Sabbath-day</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2932">360</xref></sup> For Moses did not make <italic>the mighty hand</italic> and <italic>the great terror</italic>, he merely arranged [that they be displayed by G-d], and for His sake they were wrought <italic>in the sight of all Israel</italic>.</p>

Now, each unit of ten verses is composed of three verses from the Pentateuch, three from the Prophets, three from the Writings, with one concluding verse from the Pentateuch.

The Gemara&#x2019;s answer is that the verse <italic>Hear, O Israel: The Eternal our G-d, the Eternal is One</italic> (above 6:4) is also a statement of Sovereignty even though the word &#x201C;King&#x201D; is not mentioned.

In the second census [after the Peor affair] they numbered 22,200 (<italic>ibid.</italic>, 26:14), a decrease of 37,100 people. In the opinion of Ibn Ezra the decrease would be accounted for by the 24,000 people that died in the plague because of the Peor affair (<italic>ibid.</italic>, 25:9) thus indicating that the idol-worshippers were exclusive of that tribe. On this point, Ramban will comment that even assuming that all 24,000 who died in the plague were from the tribe of Simeon, there are still 13,100 people unaccounted for, a discrepancy that cannot be explained by Ibn Ezra&#x2019;s theory.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2653">(81) In the first census the Gadites numbered 46,500 (Numbers 2:15), and in the second census they were 40,500 (<italic>ibid.</italic>, 26:18) &#x2014; a decrease of 5,150. &#x2014; And so perhaps we should assume that these deaths resulted from the plague because of Peor.</ftnote>

A reference to this work is also found in Ramban&#x2019;s Introduction to the Commentary on the Torah (see Vol. I, p. 10, Note 22). This is a mystic Midrash describing the process of ascending to heaven and of the palaces therein leading up to the Holy Throne. The principal narrator in this account is Rabbi Yishmael, one of the martyrs who was executed during the religious persecutions of Hadrian. The Midrash mentions the executions on account of the tradition that the ten martyrs suffered their fate in order to atone for the sale of Joseph by ten of his brothers.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2727">(155) Onkelos&#x2019; rendition of the verse is as follows: &#x201C;Accept, O G-d, the prayer of Judah when he goes out to war, and bring him to his people in peace. His hand will execute punishment upon his enemies, and be [O G-d] his help against his enemies.&#x201D; This entire rendition accords with Ramban&#x2019;s interpretation of the verse.</ftnote>

But prior to the lot for the burning of the incense the officer announced, &#x201C;Fresh priests etc.,&#x201D; i.e., those who had never yet performed the incense service were to come forward.

<ftnote id="fn2766">(194) The word <italic>yedid</italic> (beloved) does not refer to Benjamin, describing him as &#x201C;the beloved of G-d.&#x201D; Instead it is a descriptive noun referring to G-d &#x2014; &#x201C;G-d, the beloved&#x201D; &#x2014; as in the verse, <italic>Let me sing of my Beloved</italic> (Isaiah 5:1 &#x2014; <italic>Ha&#x2019;kthav V&#x2019;hakabalah</italic>).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2797">(225) I have not found this quote in Talmudic literature, but it appears in the writings of the early Rabbinic period.

<ftnote id="fn2798">(226) Thus the word <italic>urtzon</italic> which thus far has been understood as being in the construct form (&#x201C;and the Will of&#x201D;) is now interpreted as an independent noun: &#x201C;and the Will,&#x201D; and is in apposition with the phrase <italic>Him that dwelt in the bush</italic>.

<ftnote id="fn2804">(232) Sifre, <italic>Brachah</italic> 353.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2805">(233) The statement of the Sifre can be understood on the basis of the saying of the Rabbis in Bereshith Rabbah 85:16: &#x201C;Any king or ruler who had no [seat of] sovereignty in the Land of Israel would consider himself worthless&#x201D; (see Vol. IV, p. 396, Note 87).

<ftnote id="fn2838">(266) In our version of Bereshith Rabbah Rabbi Levi says that they were married to priests; and Rabbi Simon says that they were married to kings, because the name <italic>Malchiel</italic> contains the word <italic>melech</italic> &#x2014; king.

<ftnote id="fn2902">(330) Verse 12.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2903">(331) II Kings 8:4. This was said by the king of Israel to Gehazi, Elisha&#x2019;s servant. The fact that the king was unaware of the prophet&#x2019;s <italic>great things</italic> indicates that they were not performed publicly in the presence of friend and enemy.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2904">(332) I Kings 18:41-45.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2905">(333) In his defense of Rambam&#x2019;s theory, Ritba in his Sefer Hazikaron (see Preface to Ramban Vol. I, p. XI, Note 18) points out that the miracles performed by Moses were done in presence of all people, or a multitude of them, whereas those done by other prophets were performed only in presence of a few people. Thus Elijah&#x2019;s oath about the cessation of rain was given in the presence of King Ahab, and through him, it became known to others.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2907">(335) <italic>Ibid.</italic>, Verse 19.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2908">(336) Although in the case of Joshua Scripture states only that the miracle was done <italic>&#x2018;before&#x2019; the children of Israel</italic> (Joshua 10:12) and it does not specify &#x201C;in the sight of &#x2018;all&#x2019; Israel&#x201D; as in the case of Moses &#x2014; nevertheless Ramban points out that the very nature of the miracle dictates that it occurred &#x201C;in view of all Israel,&#x201D; etc.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2940">(368) This section is from manuscripts and found only in early editions of the commentary. The thought behind it is clear. Since Ramban finishes his commentary with a prayer for the building of &#x201C;the House and the <italic>Ariel</italic>&#x201D; he proceeds now in a concluding note to refer to the approaching time of redemption when &#x201C;G-d will go forth from attribute to attribute &#x2014; from the attribute of justice to that of mercy to hasten the redemption.&#x201D;</ftnote>
