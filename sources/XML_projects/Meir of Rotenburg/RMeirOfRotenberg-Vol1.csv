The mere designation of an object for a sacred purpose does not sanctify the object, and it may still be used for a secular purpose. Therefore, were A not a resident of that town, the community would be free to use said ground for building the school. But if A is a resident of that town, since a community can not use for one purpose, community property originally designated for another purpose, unless such change be unanimously approved by the members of the community, or approved by a resident, outstanding scholar of the caliber of R.

"Meir, I Orah Hayyim.19.2",<i>A</i>. The money may be used for buying waxen candles. The purpose for which the money was given may be changed by the members of the synagogue (though it can not be so changed by the donor) for the following reasons: a) Preparing an object for sacred use does not sanctify the object until it is actually used for such purpose; b) candles and oil used in a synagogue are not intrinsically sacred; nor are they even considered <i>tashmishe kedushah</i> (objects used for a sacred function) since they are not indispensable to the function of the synagogue.

Even if the honor was not sold to the grandfather, but the community agreed to grant it to him or his son, it cannot be taken away from R.

"Meir, Ii Yoreh Deah.106.1","Rabbi Samuel of Eisenach, a relative of R. Meir, permitted the eating of ritually slaughtered chickens with which a <i>trefah</i> chicken was mixed up. He based his decision on an opinion he said he had received from R. Jacob, that the law stated in Mishna Ab. Z. 5, 9, and interpreted in the Talmud Ab. Z. 74a, is the accepted law governing mixtures. This talmudic interpretation implies, that only objects possessing both characteristics: a) items usually sold by the piece, and b) forbidden objects, the profitable use of which is prohibited (<i>issurei hanaah</i>), are never neutralized in a mixture. However, objects lacking one of these characteristics do become neutralized in the proper mixture."

"Meir, Ii Yoreh Deah.121.2","<i>A</i>. When a Gentile pours wine from a vessel, that part of the wine which is already outside of the vessel is considered ""forbidden wine"" because the Gentile exerted energy in pouring it from the vessel. When the Gentile stops pouring the wine, the last drop dribbling from the vessel is still considered ""forbidden wine"" because of the energy exerted, while the drop with which it was in contact and which separated from it and remained in the vessel not only itself should become ""forbidden wine"", because of its actual contact with the last drop that dribbled from the vessel, but should render the rest of the wine in the vessel ""forbidden"". This actual contact of the wine remaining in the vessel with that poured out of it, is termed ""wine touches wine"". When a Gentile, however, had actually touched the wine contained in a certain vessel, thus rendering it <i>yayin nesek</i> (forbidden wine), and subsequently a Jew poured wine from a cask into the vessel containing the <i>yayin nesek</i>, a contact was thus made by the uninterrupted flow of the wine from the cask into the vessel. This contact is termed <i>nitzok</i>. Some authorities rule that this contact renders the wine in the cask <i>yayin nesek</i>, while other authorities hold that it does not. However, even according to the former authorities, when a Gentile pours wine from a vessel he does not render the wine remaining in it ""forbidden wine"", for the reason that the wine he did pour out of the vessel, though ""forbidden wine"", is not considered <i>yayin nesek</i> in the full sense of the term. The mere exerting of energy by a Gentile in connection with the wine, without his actually touching it, renders it ""forbidden"" in a limited sense."

Thus the cellar was found locked, while thieves do not trouble themselves to lock a door after their work is done.

Faucets are usually inserted in casks which contain ordinary wine, while sealed casks are used for wine of superior quality. The thieves preferred to insert a faucet in a sealed cask probably in order to draw the superior wine rather than obtain inferior wine from the open casks. Moreover, they did not draw out all the wine even from the sealed cask. There is no reason to suspect, therefore, that they also drew wine from the open casks."

If the perpetrators had been duly warned against this practice and did not heed the warning, they need no longer be disturbed; for it is better that they transgress innocently than rebelliously. Our own wine, of course, we are permitted to offer to a Gentile (although this wine becomes <i>yayin nesek</i> as soon as the Gentile touches it)."

"Meir, Ii Yoreh Deah.134.1","<i>Q</i>.

For ten years A paid the three pounds per year regularly and thus has paid thirty pounds to the charity-chest. Now, however, being somewhat depleted in finances he is in no position to return the ten pounds. Since it is forbidden to lend charity-money on condition that the lender share in the profits but not in the losses, the thirty pounds paid by A is considered <i>abak ribbit</i> (shade of usury). Although A can not collect, by judicial process, the <i>abak ribbit</i> he has paid, he ought to be able to retain the ten pounds in exchange for the unlawful interest he has paid. Signed: Hayyim b. Machir."
"Meir, Ii Yoreh Deah.134.2","<i>A</i>. If one lends money on condition that he share in the profits but not in the losses, the terms of this transaction, being unlawful, are void. We must, therefore, substitute other terms in their place. We must choose one of the following alternatives: a) the transaction is a pure loan bearing no profit; b) the lender is liable for his share of the losses and is entitled to his share of the profits. Since a person lends money with the intention of earning a profit, and such profit constitutes the main purpose of the transaction, we prefer the second alternative. Therefore, we must calculate what percentage of the entire profit (earned by A through the use of the ten pounds) the three pounds per year was expected to form, and, then, charge the charity-chest with the responsibility for the same percentage of the losses. If, during the ten year period, the thirty pounds paid by A exceeded the percentage of the total profit, A is entitled to deduct such excess from the principal; otherwise, he must repay the entire principal."
"Meir, Ii Yoreh Deah.134.3","R. Hayyim b. Machir raised objections to R. Meir's decision. He brought proof to the effect that the transaction ought to be changed into a pure loan bearing no profit, and that A be entitled to retain the ten pounds of the principal against the illegal profit he has paid. He even cited (by number) another Responsum of R. Meir wherein the latter decided that a transaction such as the above be considered a pure loan bearing no profit. (Cf. Cr. 62, Pr. 151; Am. II, 169.) He assured Rabbi Meir, however, that he would follow his decision."
"Meir, Ii Yoreh Deah.134.4","R. Meir replied: I was always of the opinion that the aforesaid transaction ought to be considered a pure loan bearing no profit. But, when your query reached me I had just received the book (Code) of Maimomides, and I decided to ""ask the Oracle"" (see what Maimonides says on the subject). When I discovered that Maimonides requires the lender to share in the losses as well as in the profits, I adopted his view. For all his words are based on tradition. Even if this decision be based on reason, I have to bow to his opinion since my inferior reasoning ability could never compare with that of Maimonides who is a profound master in that art. Moreover, I see the wisdom of his view. For a person who lends money to another does so because he hopes to profit thereby. Were he mainly interested in the safety of the principal (as you seem to infer) he would keep the money in a safe place and never lend it to anybody. Were we to ask a lender who had stipulated that he do not share in the losses, whether he would prefer to change his voided agreement into a pure loan transaction bearing no profit, or choose to share in the profits and the losses, he would certainly prefer the latter. Furthermore, when the active partner lends the money against adequate security, the chances of earning a profit are much greater than the chances of losing part of the principal."

"Meir, Ii Yoreh Deah.135.2","<i>A</i>. If B cannot extricate himself from the charity-trustees without paying interest on A's loan, as in case the trustees claim to have lent the money to A through a Gentile, A must pay the required interest to B, since his loan to B constituted a usurious transaction and the court enforces the reimbursement of money collected as usury. On the other hand, if B could extricate himself from the charity-trustees without paying interest on the loan, but in order to do so, he would have to sue the charity-trustees, A should pay B for his efforts on his behalf; otherwise these efforts would constitute <i>abak ribbit</i> (a shade of usury). However, a court does not enforce the reimbursement of <i>abak ribbit</i>."

"Meir, Ii Yoreh Deah.136.1","<i>Q</i>. A claims that B owed him three and three-eighths <i>marks</i>, that B gave him valuables to pledge with the charity treasurers for a loan of the same amount (the money of which A was to take in payment of the above debt), that B asked him to pledge with the charity treasurers additional valuables of his own, which he (A) was to lend to B, should B's valuables prove insufficient security for the loan, and that B promised to redeem these valuables. A, therefore, demands that B redeem his pledges. B, while conceding the above, claims that originally A lent him only three <i>marks</i>; that the additional three-eighths of a <i>mark</i> A is demanding, constitutes the interest on this loan; and that such interest is unlawful usury from Jew to Jew since the loan was made by A directly to him [without a Gentile intermediary]."
"Meir, Ii Yoreh Deah.136.2","<i>A</i>. B must take an oath that the three-eighths of a <i>mark</i> constitutes interest on a loan made directly to him, and thus be free from obligation for this sum. Although by taking this oath B will incriminate himself [since borrowing money on interest is also a sin] such oath will have full legal effect when applied against A.

"Meir, Ii Yoreh Deah.137.2","<i>A</i>. Your decision was correct and the trustee's stipulation of a definite interest was illegal and, therefore, void. However, under the circumstances, the loan is as if made by the Jewish court — the natural trustee and protector of all orphans — on the usual terms [made when orphans' money is loaned]: ""to share in the profits but not in the losses."" Therefore, if A earned profits with the money, he must pay to the trustee, the stipulated quarter per <i>mark</i>. If A admits that the money he borrowed belonged to the orphans, but claims to have repaid part of it, the trustee is believed as to the amount he received from A, (in repayment of the loan), and is not required to take an oath since the trustee is a disinterested third party. But if A states his belief that the trustee loaned him his own money, and not the orphans' money, the trustee must take an oath as to the amount he received from A in repayment of the loan, though he is not required to take an oath to the effect that the money he loaned belonged to the orphans."

The Talmud provides that such money be invested with a rich and trustworthy person, one who obeys the laws of the Torah and is careful not to bring upon himself a ban of the Rabbis. It should be invested on condition that the orphans share in the profits but not in the losses (B. M. 70 a). To invest such money in mortgages on houses, fields, or vineyards, is preferable, since money may be lost but land lasts forever. The written contract attesting the transaction, should be deposited with a trustworthy person or with the trustee of the orphans.

"Meir, Ii Yoreh Deah.139.2","<i>A</i>. If while the arrangement was made with the young man to rehearse the lessons with A's son in return for receiving his sustenance, the stipulation was made that the young man lend money to A, the transaction is considered usurious, even though A would have been content to pay the young man's living expenses in return for his tutoring alone. The fact that the money was not given as an actual loan, since A was not to be responsible for its loss through unavoidable accident, does not materially change the situation, since the Talmud considers the renting of money a usurious transaction (B. M. 69b). But, if it is true, what you write at the end of your letter, that the young man gave A his money as an outright gift so that he is at liberty, should he so desire, never to return the money to the young man, the transaction is a legitimate one."

"Meir, Ii Yoreh Deah.140.2","<i>A</i>. A person's admission against his own interests is equivalent to the testimony of a hundred witnesses (Git. 40b).

A debt in the hands of a Gentile can not be transferred to another by a simple agreement of the three parties concerned. Such a debt may legally be transferred to a third party in the following manner only: The creditor must say to the Gentile debtor and to the sureties: ""Obligate yourselves to pay to A the debt which you owe me; if you will do so, I shall release you from your obligations toward me.""

Subsequently, the Gentile failed to redeem the pledge. Is A permitted to recover the pledge and pay B the principal plus the interest accumulated during the time the pledge was in B's possession, or would such payment of interest constitute usury? Moreover, since a Jew does not gain title to a Gentile's pledge (Pesach. 31b), may B refuse to return the pledge to A on the ground that A sold his rights in that pledge to B?"
"Meir, Ii Yoreh Deah.144.2","<i>A</i>. Since A did not gain title to the pledge, it is assumed that he surrendered all his rights to the pledge upon handing it to B. Therefore, B became the creditor of the gentile (and not A's creditor) and was entitled to the interest on his loan.

When they came to negotiate the loan with the Gentile, however, he asked them that in addition to lending him the money they undertake to feed his horses for a certain period of time. He offered to pay only three <i>Heller</i> denarii per pound [per week] interest, but the liberal compensation he offered for feeding his horses induced them to accept his terms. They agreed, therefore, that at the expiration of the designated period the Gentile pay A and B a certain sum of money, which sum represented payment of the principal and the interest, plus remuneration for feeding the horses.

He now demands two measures of feed plus thirteen schillings from B.

"Meir, Ii Yoreh Deah.174.2","<i>A</i>. Whether or not one has taken an oath not to clip coins, the doing so is a serious crime, the perpetrators of which deserve severe punishment. Clipping coins is tantamount to stealing and robbing, and robbing Gentiles is a crime. Furthermore, such an act creates a public nuisance as it may result in causing great injury to other Jews innocently passing on these coins. It may even cause widespread disaster, and has already led to a great deal of bloodshed. Thus, clipping coins brought about the destruction of our brethren in France and Britain. In addition to committing a basic crime, these Jews broke their solemn oath to the burghers. Mental reservations do not invalidate an oath occasioned by legal circumstances. The talmudic ruling (Ned. 28a) that a person may invalidate his oath to extortionists and murderers by mental reservations, does not apply in this case; for, while extortionists and murderers, by administering an oath, strive to bolster their criminal purposes, it is legal and proper for a king or civil authority to forbid the clipping of coins. Therefore, their oath to the burghers was valid despite their mental reservations. Moreover, when the Gentiles will learn that the Jews clipped coins despite their oath — and they are bound to discover it sooner or later — they will suspect the Jews of wilfully breaking their oath. Should the latter inform the Gentiles that they disregarded their oath because of mental reservations, the consequences might be still more serious; for Gentiles will never again believe a Jew under oath. Therefore, if your authority and my authority carry enough weight, these Jews should be properly flogged."

Why do we, nowadays, partake of secular festivity-meals and secular wedding-feast meals (such as at the wedding of a priest to a daughter of an Israelite, or of a daughter of a scholar to a commoner) in view of the fact that the Talmud explicitly states (B. Pesah. 49a): ""A scholar may not partake of any but religious festivity-meals?"""

B became enraged at the insult to his father who had been a scholar and a sage. Both fathers were dead at the time. Now B demands that A be duly punished for vilifying a scholar after his death."
"Meir, Ii Yoreh Deah.182.2","<i>A</i>. We have no right to adjudicate fines, but a court is permitted to take emergency measures whenever necessary. However, if A will take an oath to the effect that he did not fully understand the charge B had made against his father but automatically replied, ""your father"", he will be free from obligation. Moreover, B must leave this dispute also to C and D for arbitration. He can not press this charge separately without transgressing his oath. On the other hand, since people customarily and automatically reply ""your father"" whenever someone vilifies their father, B deserves greater punishment than A since he was the first to use vile language. In any event, both A and B should appear before a scholar seeking atonement for their sin of having vilified the dead."

The punishment should also depend on the high qualifications of the man and the family insulted.

If L's contention were supported by witnesses, the community would have to punish A by flagellation or imposition of a fine, in accordance with the status of the individuals involved. But, since there are no witnesses, and A denies her charge, no oath is to be imposed on A. Similarly, if A's contention were supported by witnesses, or if L admitted his charge, she would have to visit the grave of the dead person she had vilified, and in the presence of ten Jews, ask forgiveness from the dead. But, since there are no witnesses, and each one denies the other's charge, they are free from obligation. In order to pacify L and A, however, the community may pronounce a solemn curse in the synagogue, such curse to fall on A or L if they are not telling the truth.

"Meir, Ii Yoreh Deah.185.1","<i>Q</i>. A promised to give two <i>marks</i> for a holy cause should he cohabit with his wife, within the year. He did cohabit with her within that time. If such promise of a gift were made by an individual, even had such money been actually delivered to the donee, it would be considered an <i>asmakhta</i> and would be void. Therefore, this conditional promise for a holy cause should also be void, for, although a mere verbal promise for a holy cause is as valid as an actual delivery (of money and valuables) to a private person, it has no greater validity than such delivery; and any transaction classified as an <i>asmakhta</i> is invalid even if the money and valuables are actually delivered. Although a conditional promise classified as <i>asmakhta</i>, if accompanied by a <i>kinyan</i> and made before an authoritative court, is valid, its validity stems from the powers of confiscation inherent in the authoritative court, but not from an act of the promisor."
"Meir, Ii Yoreh Deah.185.2","<i>A</i>. A must pay two <i>marks</i> to the holy cause. A mere verbal promise to a holy cause is as binding as a similar promise to an individual accompanied by any manner of conveyance that serves to validate such promise. Since a conditional promise classified as <i>asmakhta</i> is valid if accompanied by a <i>kinyan</i> and made before an authoritative court, a mere promise of this kind made to charity or to a holy cause is binding, even though the promise was not made before an authoritative court. The validity of a conditional promise made before an authoritative court does not stem from the court's power of confiscation, otherwise no <i>kinyan</i> would have been required. Moreover, the power of confiscation by a Jewish court is invoked only for the furtherance of proper conduct in accordance with Jewish principles (<span dir=""rtl"">לפגדר מלתא</span>) but not for the sake of validating private transactions."

Although L is not required to take a Biblical oath in order to counteract the testimony of the single witness, since no such oath is imposed on a litigant in a dispute over charity funds, she is required to take a Rabbinical oath (B.

Should one of the members of the community, however, give a fixed sum of money to the charity-chest in full payment of his share of the charity burden, he would thus become a disinterested witness in this case, and his testimony together with that of the other witness would impose upon L the obligation of paying one pound to the charity-chest."

"Meir, Ii Yoreh Deah.189.1","<i>Q</i>. After A's death, his widow and her mother revealed that A had left a Scroll of the Law and his large, good prayer-book to charity. They suggested that the community should choose one of them on the following terms: if they choose the Scroll they must undertake to memorialize A's soul together with the souls of the other departed; but if they choose the prayer-book they must undertake to use it constantly for ten years [that the <i>Hazzan</i> use it in conducting the prayers of the congregation]. The community chose the prayer-book. But, the widow and her mother, then, asserted that they had agreed to deliver the prayer-book on condition that it be used for ten years to the exclusion of all other prayer-books. At court the representative of the community stated that the community would be ready to accept the prayer-book on the original terms, while the widow's representative denied ever having offered the prayer-book to the community. The community representative retorted that such offer was made in the presence of many witnesses. Accordingly a solemn ban was pronounced against anyone who had heard the widow make the offer and would not appear at court to offer testimony. Some members of the community, then, testified that the widow offered the prayer-book to the community on condition that it be used for ten years. Others testified that they heard the widow's mother make such offer but did not hear it from the widow herself. Some testified that they heard the widow's mother stipulate the term ""exclusively"", while others heard no exclusive stipulation."

"Meir, Ii Yoreh Deah.190.1","<i>Q</i>. We, the undersigned, were chosen as examiners and recorders of the claims of A and the widow L. Consequently, witnesses have testified before us: a) that when A was ill he asked his wife, R, to agree to an arrangement that would bring solace to their souls; b) that A and R, therefore, made a legally binding arrangement in their presence, to the effect that if A died first R would give three <i>marks</i> and A's clothes to a charity stipulated by him; and if R died first A would give six <i>marks</i> and R's clothes to a charity stipulated by her; and c) that subsequently A recovered from his illness, but R became critically ill and died of her illness. R's mother, L, came before us and claimed that, before her death, R appointed her (L) trustee of the six <i>marks</i> and the clothes, and that she asked her to distribute the same to any charity she saw fit. L, therefore, demanded the six <i>marks</i> and R's clothes from A. A on the other hand, claimed that he asked his wife before her death why she had not stipulated the recipients of this charity, and in reply she authorized him to spend two <i>marks</i> on the cemetery, either for the purpose of constructing a wall or for obtaining sand; to give half a <i>mark</i> for the sick, and to give the rest to R's needy relatives. Neither L nor A have any witnesses to support their assertions. Regarding the garments demanded by L, A claimed that L had already taken away all of R's clothes with the exception of one cloak. A demanded that L return to him his wife's seven gold rings, the two pieces of silver jewelry, the two Cologne gulden, and the money that was in R's pocket, which L had taken. L averred that she had returned to A everything that belonged to him. L further demanded that A pay her the expenses she incurred in transporting her daughter's body to another place for burial. A averred that he had paid for the casket and the shrouds; that L had transported R's body without his knowledge and consent; that he had intended to bury her in our town since there was a cemetery in our town; and that L had incurred unnecessary expenses in having R's relatives accompany the body to the place of burial. L, on the other hand, claimed that A had known of her intentions to transport her daughter to another town for burial, that A had consented to it, and that she could prove the truth of these contentions through the testimony of A's tutor, should the latter be forced to testify by a <i>herem</i>. A's tutor was summoned before us and testified to the following facts: A told him that he, A, would have accompanied his wife's body to the place of burial were he able to leave the house; he asked the tutor whether he was willing to take his place; the tutor agreed and accompanied the hearse as instructed. Three days after the claims in question were placed before us, L further claimed that A had been at odds with her daughter and, therefore, the latter did not entrust to him the charity money, and preferred that L distribute it. A denied this claim asserting that there was never any enmity between him and his wife, and that, on the contrary, she became very affectionate toward him during her illness and tried to show this affection in many ways. L also claimed that she had already distributed R's clothes in accordance with the latter's instructions; while A claimed to have warned L not to give anything away without his consent. A discovered some of the garments distributed by L in the hands of the recipients. Please explain in detail who is to be entrusted with the distribution of the charity money, and please write your answer on the reverse side of this parchment. Signed: Samuel b.

"Meir, Ii Yoreh Deah.190.2","<i>A</i>. If L claims that A was present when her daughter appointed her the distributor of the money and the clothes, A must take cognizance of her claims and must take an oath denying such claims. After taking such an oath, A will have to give to charity in the presence of witnesses the six <i>marks</i> and the clothes still in his possession. But, if L admits that A was not present at the time she was thus appointed distributor of the money and the clothes, A is under no obligation to L and must proceed to give them to charity in the presence of witnesses. L., on the other hand, must take an oath to the effect that she did not take anything belonging to A, that she has distributed R's clothes in accordance with the latter's instructions, and be free from obligation. As to the expenses of R's funeral, if some of R's relatives, or some of A's relatives, had been transported and buried in the cemetery to which R's body was transported, A was under obligation to bury R in that cemetery, since a husband is obliged to bury his wife with all the honor and dignity customary in her family, or in his family, whichever be the greater. Therefore, A must pay L the expenses she incurred in the burial of her daughter, and must also repay all loans extended to L for that purpose. Moreover, even if no relatives of A or R were ever buried in this cemetery, since A sent his tutor to participate in the funeral, he thus gave his consent to the proceedings and must pay the expenses thereof. The amount of such expenses are to be attested to by L under oath. However, A is responsible only for the expenses strictly necessary for the funeral, but not for any unnecessary extravagances."

"Meir, Ii Yoreh Deah.191.2","<i>A</i>. The distribution of charity and fine-money is governed either by custom or by agreement on the part of the community (members). However, if no custom exists in your town and the community can come to no agreement, the money should be distributed in proportion to the number of charity recipients belonging to each synagogue; for A and B were ordered by the community to pay to charity, and all the poor of the town have an equal claim to the charity of that town. A distinction is drawn in Jewish law between the poor related to the donor and the poor of the town, between the poor of the donor's town and those of another town.

Therefore, any son who would himself be thrown upon charity were he forced to support his mother, can not be forced to do so. But those sons who have means should support their mother in proportion to their wealth. These sons, however, cannot be forced to support their mother out of their own money, but can do so out of the money they are usually obliged to give to charity, although they would thus incur the curse of the Rabbis who say: ""Cursed be he who feeds his father out of the poor man's tithe"" Kid. 32a."

Nowadays that the Gentiles are all powerful, a Jewish woman who was held captive by them, even though only for the purpose of extortion, is not permitted to live with her husband (Ket. 27b). But, since in this case many Jews were held captive together, they are now able to testify which women were not violated by their captors; such women who can furnish this testimony, even by a single witness and even by a woman witness, are permitted to resume their marital relations with their husbands. The fact that the captives did not give their lives for their religion does not disqualify them as witnesses. Although a Jew is enjoined to choose death rather than be forced to worship idols, should he violate this law he would not become disqualified as a witness though he would be guilty of having committed a sin. Moreover, according to the account given by the captives, they never actually embraced Christianity, but merely listened without comment to the priest's recitation of his senseless ritual in the presence of the Gentiles. Thus, the captives never committed a sin; for a Jew is not enjoined to choose death rather than allow the Christians to deceive themselves into believing that they have converted him."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.246.1","R. Isaac left his wife Sarah in the month of <i>Adar</i> of the year 5031 (1271), and travelled to a distant place in search of sustenance for his family. Next year he learned that his wife had played the harlot and had thus become pregnant. He returned home, and in the month of <i>Ab</i> of the year 5032 (1272) he appeared before us and asked us to investigate his wife's conduct during his absence, since she bore a child in the month of Adar of the same year (1272), twelve months after he had left her. Sarah asserted, however, that she was pregnant when her husband left her. Therefore we, the undersigned, wrote to R. Shealtiel and his two sons, who lived in the same village with Sarah, and they testified in writing that Sarah bore a child twelve months after R. Isaac left her. The signatures and seals of the deponents have been attested to by reliable witnesses. Then, a person appeared before us because of the ban (proclaimed against all those who knew anything relating to this case and did not appear as witnesses) and testified that on the evening of <i>Shabuot</i> of the previous year (1271) he went to Sarah's home in order to recite the <i>kiddush</i> in her presence, and found Gentiles, loafers, who caroused with her, caressed and embraced her. We concluded, therefore, that she must have become pregnant at that time. Other persons testified to have seen her on <i>Purim</i> of this year (1272) in the last stages of pregnancy. On previous occasions, however, in the month of <i>Elul</i>, she violently protested that she was not pregnant, and cursed and abused those who had said to her that she was pregnant. Moreover, before the evil report reached the town, Sarah's father appeared before us and asked us to allow him to put his daughter to death by drowning her. When asked for his reasons, he stated that a daughter of his (meaning Sarah) was an incorrigible harlot, who bore a bastard daughter by a Gentile and then killed her child. When asked whether he tried other means of controlling her, he answered that whenever he reproved her she threatened to apostatize altogether and pleaded that she was not the first woman who ever sinned. She had left the house on a number of occasions but was persuaded to return by the entreaties of her mother. The father feared lest she turn to evil and, therefore, asked for permission to kill her. However, we did not permit him to carry out his design. We sent the testimony to Rothenburg to the great luminary, Rabbi Meir. Since the Rabbis of Erfurt who are near us, and those of Würzburg, who are far from us, as well as Rabbi Meir of Rothenburg, all agree to allow R. Isaac to divorce Sarah even against her will, the divorce has been given in our presence. Signed: Moses Azriel b. Eleazar hadarshan, Eleazar b. Yehiel, Ephraim b. Joel."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.246.2",R. Meir's opinion was as follows:
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.246.3","The testimony of R. Shealtiel and his sons is of no consequence for two reasons. a) They are related to each other; their testimony is that of a single witness, and, therefore, insufficient. b) The foetus could have lingered in the mother's womb for twelve months (cf. Yeb. 80b). Sarah's giving birth to a child twelve months after her husband left her, is, therefore, no proof of her depravity. The testimony of the other witness regarding Sarah's indecent behavior on the evening of <i>Shabuot</i>, being the testimony of a single witness, does not deprive Sarah of her right to her <i>ketubah</i>. If R. Isaac believes the aforementioned witness or if he takes the word of his wife's own father, he must divorce Sarah even against her will. If she renders it impossible for him to divorce her, he may marry another woman without divorcing Sarah as a warning to all indecent and depraved women. But he must pay Sarah her <i>ketubah</i>. However, if Sarah admits her guilt, or acknowledges the truth of the testimony regarding her indecent conduct on the evening of <i>Shabuot</i>, or if she cannot satisfactorily explain why she denied her being pregnant in the month of <i>Elul</i> of the previous year, or answer all other questions regarding her conduct, she loses her right to her <i>ketubah</i> and is entitled only to whatever is left of the valuables she had brought with her upon her marriage."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.247.1","<i>Q</i>. A, of priestly lineage, married a woman within three months [of the death of her husband].

What is your opinion on this subject?"
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.247.2","<i>A</i>. The ban that is pronounced against a person who marries a widow within three months of her husband's death, is not a punitive measure, but is a means of forcing such a person to divorce her in order that he should not live with her within the three months of her former husband's death [so that the child born seven, eight, or nine, months later would not be of doubtful parentage]. After the three months have passed, therefore, there is no longer any reason for pronouncing the ban, and persons already married prior to the expiration of that period may be permitted to continue their married life undisturbed. The same rule applies to a person who married a nursing widow before her child was twenty-four months old. If no action was taken against him before the expiration of the twenty-four months, none should be taken against him after the expiration of that period. At the same time we make no distinction between a person who married a nursing widow because he was ignorant of the transgression involved, and the person who did so fully aware that he was doing wrong, since forcing a person to divorce his wife whom he married in a forbidden period, as referred to above, is not a punitive measure."

However, were I not afraid to differ with the decisions of my teachers, I would require her to wait 24 full months of 30 days each, or 720 days, and in a leap year 25 moon-months of alternating length, in order to be sure to comply with all possible interpretations of the opinions of the authorities of the Talmud."

May A's wife remarry?"
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.250.2","<i>A</i>. Neither a general rumor, nor the finding of one's garments on a dead body, are sufficient to establish the death of an individual. But a woman is believed when she identifies her husband's body through a mole. A's wife may, therefore, remarry."

The Gentile added that for one pound he would himself convey the body in his wagon to T. Since the Gentile mentioned money, we were doubtful whether his statement should be admitted in evidence."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.251.2","<i>A</i>. I have considered the above case from all angles, and find no reason why L should not be permitted to remarry. The fact that the Gentile mentioned money did not weaken his testimony, but rather strengthened it; for, not only did he make a report in his innocence, he even offered to prove the truth of it. Therefore, if no other Jew is missing from T, L should be permitted to remarry. Moreover, I have seen the letter of R. Jacob b. Mordecai, bearing the signature of Rabbi Eliezer, which stated that a certain Gentile told a Jew that he killed L's husband. This statement by the murderer is to be admitted in evidence; and should, in itself, serve as a basis for permitting L to remarry."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.253.1","<i>Q</i>. A and B were married to two sisters. Since A frequented B's house, B suspected him of adulterous relations with his wife, and threatened to kill him. One day A went out of town leaving his books and his valuables with his wife, his manner indicating that he intended to return shortly. He never came back, however, and a search for him proved futile. Subsequently, three Gentile thieves came to the house of a Jew of a neighboring town to sell a stolen article; and casually remarked that A, from the nearby town, was murdered through the instigation of his brother-in-law, and was buried in his clothes in an upright but inverted position. The Jew asked the thieves to show him where A was buried, and they answered that they would show him the place if he gave them one <i>mark</i>. On the same day, however, before they had a chance to point out A's grave, the thieves were apprehended for stealing and were hanged. Subsequently, a Jew arrived in town who told the relatives of A's wife that he had seen A alive in France. This Jew, however, had been an apostate and later returned to Judaism, but not wholeheartedly. He was one of those despicable creatures who wander from town to town and alternately appear as Jews or as fanatical Christians. Nevertheless, the relatives of A's wife sent a man with the apostate to France, and the man investigated thoroughly but could find no trace of A. Meanwhile a long time has passed, and the grass widow, lonely, miserable, and distressed, has not heard a word about the whereabouts of her husband."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.253.2","<i>A</i>. Whenever a Gentile makes an informal statement to the effect that he witnessed the death of a Jew, we accept such statement as reliable evidence and permit the Jew's wife to remarry. Thus, the unsolicited remarks of the three thieves are to be considered as the testimony of three witnesses. Although the statement of the apostate contradicted the words of the thieves, we do not admit into evidence the testimony of a single witness in the face of the testimony of three witnesses. It is true that, although in a case involving the release of a grass widow we admit into evidence the testimony of ordinarily unqualified witnesses (such as women and Gentiles), the testimony of a single qualified witness is nevertheless considered equal to that of a hundred unqualified witnesses. In our case, the three Gentile witnesses were not contradicted by a qualified witness, for the apostate cannot be considered a qualified witness, since his return to the fold was not sincere. He and the others of his kind call themselves Jews in order that people should give them food, and that they should have a chance to steal and to indulge their base appetites. Therefore, if the communities of Rita and Kublin should agree, I would permit the woman to remarry."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.254.1","Most scholars hold the opinion that a woman whose husband fell into a body of water whose final boundaries are not discernible, and who, though not permitted to remarry, defiantly transgressed against the prohibition of the Rabbis and did remarry, need not be divorced from her second husband. This opinion they base on the talmudic ruling that the law prohibiting the remarriage of a woman whose husband fell into a ""boundless"" body of water, applies only before, but not after, she has remarried. I once saw a prominent personage of our kingdom remarry under such circumstances without any one admonishing her. All our prominent scholars decided that she need not be divorced, once she has remarried. A great French scholar was then staying in our kingdom, and he, too, permitted her to stay married claiming that he had witnessed a similar case in France and that all the great scholars of France ruled that she need not be divorced. I also gave my consent to his decision though I was hesitant. However, I have finally come to the conclusion that such an opinion is untenable. For, were this opinion correct the prohibition of the Rabbis would be rendered senseless, useless, and ridiculous, since no woman would heed such prohibition and would transgress against it rather than stay single all her life. Why, then, would the Rabbis prohibit such remarriage to begin with! Therefore, we must say that the talmudic ruling which does not require the remarried woman to be divorced, refers only to that woman who remarried because she innocently believed that a scholar had permitted her to do so, as in the case of Hassa (Yeb. 121b) and that of R. Shila (Yeb. 121a); but that it does not refer to the woman who defiantly transgressed the prohibition of the Rabbis. This latter interpretation of the pertinent talmudic sources clarifies the words of the Rabbis and renders them logical and tenable. Therefore, a woman who remarried without receiving permission from a scholar must be divorced, or the husband be put under the ban till he divorce her. We must not be concerned lest a relative of the woman permit her to remarry (thus flouting the prohibition of the Rabbis), for the following reasons: a) only a scholar holding the position among scholars that R. Nahman (the scholar who inadvertantly caused the wife of Hassa to remarry) and R. Shila held in their day, is empowered to permit such a woman to remarry; b) a scholar permitting such a woman to remarry would bring upon himself the ban."

Therefore, neither A nor his daughter has ever gained title to B's money, and A must return the principal plus the interest to B.

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.256.2","<i>A</i>. Even according to Rabbi Joel, who was doubtful whether or not an epileptic might be forced to divorce his wife, the pledge must be returned to A, since in cases of doubt we do not give a verdict in favor of one seeking to collect money from the other party to the suit. Moreover A had stipulated that his agreement with B should be void in case of unavoidable accident; the discovery that B was an epileptic and the rightful refusal, hence, of A's daughter to marry B because of the danger involved, constituted an unavoidable accident and thus voided the agreement. We must also take into consideration the possibility that B's children will be epileptic. Although the admonition of the Talmud (Yeb. 64b) not to marry into a family of epileptics applies to a family of which at least three members are epileptic, this admonition applies to the marrying of a person who is himself an epileptic even though no other member of his family is so afflicted. Moreover had B already married A's daughter, and were she to demand a divorce on the ground that she can not live with an epileptic, she would have been entitled to the return of her dowry; since no marriage has taken place, B is not entitled to receive any money from A.

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.264.2","<i>A</i>. Since the child died before he was thirty days old, his viability has not been established. Therefore, his existence was of no consequence. Thus, I am greatly surprised that you considered the existence of the child a determining factor in the case. Moreover, Rashi and R. Tam hold conflicting opinions regarding the question whether a widower is entitled to collect the dowry his father-in-law had promised him (<i>Tosaphot</i> Ket. 47a, s. v. <span dir=""rtl"">כתב</span>). I am greatly surprised, therefore, that you dare decide between the two conflicting opinions; for whenever there exists a difference of opinion between authorities, we do not enforce the collection of money by either party. Your contention that since A's daughter was a sickly person B had a stronger claim on her dowry, is also baseless, for the law draws no distinction between a healthy and a sickly wife. Indeed, the <i>takkanah</i> of R. Tam to the effect that when a wife dies within the first year of her marriage the husband must return her dowry to the original donors, is only valid in those communities where this <i>takkanah</i> was accepted. My decision in this case, however, is not based on this <i>takkanah</i>, but on Rabbinic law which is valid everywhere."

C, now, demands L's dowry from B."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.265.2","<i>A</i>. When a woman dies within the first year of her marriage, the ordinance of Rabbenu Tam undisputably prevails that her dowry must be returned to the donors. The communities have further ordained that when a woman dies within the second year of her marriage, half of her dowry must be returned to the donor. We are not certain, however, whether or not this latter ordinance was accepted. Moreover, even according to talmudic law the dowry mentioned above is not collectible, since according to R. Tam's interpretation of the pertinent talmudic ruling (ket. 47a) a person may not collect the dowry that had been promised to his wife, who subsequently died, unless he collected it before she died. There is no doubt, therefore, that C is not entitled to collect L's dowry from B (talmudic law), and that he must even return the five pounds he had already received (because of the ordinance of R. Tam). Should C deny having received the five pounds, he would have to take an oath in support of his denial. Since C, however, does not inherit L's dowry, he is under no obligation to pay for L's funeral. Therefore, he is not to be charged with the funeral expenses spent by L's father. Similarly, C is under no obligation to discharge L's pledges to charity, unless C had instructed L to make such pledges at his expense."

This ruling, however, applies only to the father who had merely promised a dowry but failed to give it to his son-in-law before his daughter died. In our case, however, the son-in-law gained title to the dowry, for it was secured through pledges the father had deposited with trustees, or because sureties have guaranteed its delivery. The dowry was merely entrusted to the father-in-law that he do business therewith, and earn profit for the benefit of the young couple until they grow up.

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.271.1","<i>Q</i>. A, a nephew of Rabbi Kohen Zedek, asked the latter for advice regarding the planned betrothal of his daughter. A informed him that in his (A's) locality there were no qualified witnesses (unrelated to the bride) but that he intended to invite two strangers from another locality to act as witnesses to the betrothal. These two strangers, however, were brothers-in-law and one was the nephew of the other. Rabbi Kohen Zedek, then, told A that since these two were related to each other they were disqualified witnesses and consequently the betrothal would be void. A, however, answered that no great harm would be done even if the betrothal were void since the bridegroom would ultimately betroth the bride again, at the time of the marriage. A repeated this answer to the widowed sister of Rabbi Kohen Zedek who later witnessed the betrothal and protested that the witnesses were disqualified. Must A's daughter receive a divorce in order to free herself from the bridegroom?"
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.271.2","<i>A</i>. Since the two witnesses were related to each other, they were disqualified and the betrothal was not binding. Therefore, A's daughter needs no divorce. As to the spreading rumor that a betrothal took place, the opinion of Rav is accepted that when the court discovers that a certain rumor [of betrothal] had no foundation in fact, the court silences such rumor. Moreover, a rumor is of no consequence unless the probability of its truthful origin has been upheld in court (cf. Git. 89a f.), while in our case the rumor is known to be baseless."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.271.3","Rabbi Kohen Zedek wrote again to Rabbi Meir raising doubt as to the correctness of R. Meir's decision, and informing him that his (R. Meir's) teacher from Spiers at first agreed with this decision but later disagreed with it; and that meanwhile A's daughter became betrothed to another man."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.271.4","Rabbi Meir answered that the first decision of his teacher was correct; that in the case of a woman who was betrothed in the presence of two witnesses, one of whom was later discovered to be related to the bridegroom, Rabbi Joel haLevi decided in a Responsum that the woman did not need a divorce, and permitted her to remarry; and that he enclosed a copy of Rabbi Joel's Responsum in order to prove that his own decision was based on a solid foundation. He added: A rumor is of no consequence unless it be current in the town where the alleged betrothal took place. In this case, however, A and his sons were the only Jewish residents of the settlement, and they were told beforehand that such a betrothal would be void. Moreover, even the authorities who hold that we cannot dispel a rumor, agree that when a rumor is self-contradictory, or the statements made therein are not untrue but harmless, such rumor is of no consequence. We are not at liberty to be overstringent in such cases and demand that a divorce be delivered in order to dispel any shadow of doubt as to the girl's freedom to remarry, since such a step would make her ineligible to marry a man of priestly lineage."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.271.5","The leaders of the communities [Spiers, Worms, and Mayence] upon learning that R. Meir permitted A's daughter to become betrothed to another man without first receiving a divorce from her first bridegroom, became highly incensed and heaped abuse upon R. Meir for having permitted a married woman to remarry. Rabbi Mordecai [of Worms, cf. Mord. Ket. 290] and his associates wrote that Rabbi Hananel in his <i>Sefer Hamikzoot</i>, the author of <i>Sekel Tob</i>, Rabiah, and Rabbi Simha [of Spiers], all ruled that a woman who was betrothed in the presence of unqualified witnesses, must receive her divorce before she is permitted to remarry. They placed A and his daughter [but probably not R. Meir] under the ban in order to force A's daughter to receive a divorce from her second bridegroom."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.271.6","R. Meir became highly indignant. He pointed out the clear distinction between witnesses who were rabbinically disqualified and those who were Biblically disqualified. He proved that the above-mentioned authorities as well as Alfasi, Rabbi Kalonymus, and the author of <i>Ittur</i> [Rabbi Isaac b. Abba Mari of Marseilles] all agreed that a woman who was betrothed in the presence of Biblically disqualified witnesses required no divorce and was free to marry another. He showed that not a single authority contravened this view, and that the Rabbis of Spiers were misled in their haste and zeal by a faulty reading of the <i>Sekel Tob</i>."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.271.7","R. Meir added: if the Rabbis of the communities subsequently discover an authority who ruled that such a woman must receive a divorce, they should realize that such a divorce was not required by Biblical law nor by rabbinic law, but that the authority of his own accord ruled that a divorce take place merely to dissipate evil gossip. Since the first betrothal of A's daughter took place in the presence of two witnesses who were beyond a doubt Biblically disqualified witnesses, as one of them was the nephew of the other, the betrothal was void; especially so since even at that time it was known to all bystanders that the betrothal possessed no validity whatsoever. Since she was subsequently betrothed to another, having first received permission from an authoritative court, no authority in the world would require that the Biblically valid second betrothal should be dissolved merely in order to dissipate unfounded doubts. Moreover, we are expressly enjoined by the Talmud from requiring that she receive a divorce from her second bridegroom, since such divorce would disqualify her from ever marrying her first bridegroom (Yeb. 11b). If the leaders of the communities are highly sensitive and are bent on dissipating any doubt in the matter, they should force the first bridegroom to grant a divorce to A's daughter and I, on my part, shall compel her to accept the divorce. Although such a divorce is unnecessary, and hence should not be granted, as it would bar the woman from ever marrying a man of priestly lineage, I should overlook this point in honor of the Rabbis of the communities. Accordingly A's daughter will wait for a divorce till the feast of <i>Purim</i>. If the communities will be unable to effect the divorce within that time, because of the stubbornness of the bridegroom and his refusal to comply with their request, we shall go against the wishes of the community leaders and allow A's daughter to marry her second bridegroom; as we shall not permit that she be put in a position where she can never remarry."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.271.8","We have never seen revered teachers of old act in the manner of the above-mentioned community leaders.

You have gathered, and have associated with yourselves, men who do not understand the intricacies of the laws of marriage and divorce.

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.272.2","<i>A</i>. If the glandules are situated in a place where sometimes they may be seen while at other times they are hidden from view, the betrothal was concluded under error and was, therefore, void. The betrothal would have been void under such circumstances even if no condition had been stipulated by A. If the glandules, however, were situated in a place where they were always exposed to view, A must have seen them and must therefore have determined to overlook them, and certainly such was the case with reference to the glandules on her legs; the betrothal was therefore valid. The condition he had stipulated was of no avail since it must have referred to other defects besides the glandules. Moreover, we know that a condition was stipulated only through B's admission, which is not sufficient evidence. If A did not know L and had never seen her, however, the betrothal was void even if no condition had been stipulated. We should not permit A, however, to marry another woman since we have no record that the great Rabbis, our predecessors, ever permitted such a marriage in practice.

They are not permitted to live in the same house because there may be occasions when no chaperons are about, and a person is not permitted to cohabit with his betrothed before they are actually married. Moreover, there is danger lest familiarity may breed contempt."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.280.1","We were obliged to try the case of a betrothed, L, who demanded that her bridegroom, A (Jacob), come to her father's house and marry her there. A's father, B (Moses), representing his son, brought forth the following claims: a) When he (B) had arranged the match with L's father, C (Judah), he had promised C to send his son to live in C's house; b) he kept his promise, and, after A betrothed L through a messenger, he sent A to C; c) at the time the match was arranged C promised to clothe A suitably, to support him, and to hire a capable teacher for him; d) after A stayed in C's house for one year, he was sent back to his father and C took no further notice of him; A was forced to interrupt his studies and he, B, with very limited means, had to support him for five difficult years; and, f) he asked many persons to urge C to keep his promise of support to A, but C refused. The undersigned (R. Meir) also, sent many letters to C, asking him to have pity on his son-in-law who suffered poverty and privation — all to no avail. Moreover, we have learned (from a letter) that C does not at all desire the consummation of the marriage, but has set his heart on a divorce since A displeased him. Thus, B claims that he has fulfilled his promise and sent his son to C; but, that the latter put A to shame and now he, B, can no longer force A to return to C's house; that A is afraid to return to C's place of residence since many persons have warned him that C's servants were threatening to do him injury unless he agree to divorce L; that though A cannot, and will not, return to C, he is nevertheless ready to marry L whenever she will come to his place of residence."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.280.2","Taking the above into consideration, we have decided that A cannot be compelled to settle in C's town, marry L, and live with her there; nor can he be forced to divorce L. Our decision is based on irrefutable proof: Thus, the majority of our leading authorities agree that a man living in one country who betrothed a woman living in another country, may force the woman to come and live with him in his country. Although the Tosephta (Ket. 13, 2) and the Palestinian Talmud, (Ket. 13, 10) seem to disagree on this score, we believe that our interpretation of the statements in these two sources removes the discrepancy and shows that both agree regarding this law. Moreover, when the man betrothed the woman through a messenger, there is not a shadow of a doubt that according to both sources given above, the woman ought to be forced to move to her husband's place of residence. This opinion is shared by Rashi, Maimonides and other leading authorities. R. Tam, however, believes that these sources deal with cases in which we force the husband to change his place of residence to that of his wife. Therefore, in view of this difference of opinion (although I do not agree with the view of R. Tam) we must accept the strictures of each opinion. Thus, we are forced to decide that neither the husband nor the wife can force a change in the other's place of residence. We cannot compel the husband to change his place of residence because of the opinion of Rashi, Maimonides, and the other leading authorities; but neither can we compel the wife to change her place of residence, because of the opinion of R. Tam. Although B had agreed at the time of the betrothal that A would settle in C's town, B had no right to bind A to such terms and we can find no evidence that A had voluntarily agreed to change his place of residence. The fact that A went to visit C is no evidence of such voluntary agreement. Moreover, he went on this visit after the betrothal, while we are concerned with his intentions at the time of the betrothal. Therefore, this agreement between B and C is void. Furthermore, had A himself voluntarily agreed at the time of the betrothal to move to C's place of residence, we should not be able to force A to keep his part of the agreement since C, on his part, had made many promises at that time which he later failed to keep."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.280.3","Some Rabbis wrote their opinion that A should be compelled to move to L's place of residence since it was not dignified for a woman to move from place to place, as expressed by the verse: ""All glorious is the king's daughter within the palace"" (Ps. 45,11; cf. Git. 12a). Moreover, it is humiliating for a woman to pursue her husband into a distant place. However, I regard this manner of reasoning as very strange indeed; for in the talmudic period women were more honorable and discreet than today, and yet talmudic law required them to move to their husband's place of residence. The aforementioned Rabbis also wrote that since, according to the Talmud, a woman's station may be elevated through marriage but not lowered, L should not be forced to move to A's town. For L was brought up in great luxury and abundance, and were she to move to A's house she would have to share his poverty and privation. However, L would not have to suffer privation. C had promised A a large sum of money as a dowry; with that money A should be able to support L in a manner befitting her station, and on a standard equal to that of the other women of her family. Although she would miss some of the extravagances of her father's house, she would have to bear with such minor inconvenience. In conclusion, since A is ready to marry L whenever she will come to live in his town, we cannot compel A to move to L's town or to divorce her. This decision is required by talmudic law and the Rabbis made no distinction between a poor woman and a rich woman. Signed: R. Meir b. Baruch."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.280.5","The following Responsa by R. Samuel b. Salomo, R. Jacob B. Joseph, R. Yehiel b. Jacob ha Levi, and R. Eliezer B. Ephraim, refer to the same case:"
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.280.6","This letter is written regarding the youth of Rothenburg who betrothed, through a messenger, the daughter of R. Judah of Düren. At the time the match was concluded the youth's father had agreed that his son would take up his permanent abode with his father-in-law. After the betrothal the bridegroom came to stay with R. Judah who hired a teacher for him and treated him honorably for a long time. A year later the youth became sick and R. Judah, thinking that this was a result of the change of climate, sent him home accompanied by his teacher, and expended large sums of money on him. Subsequently, R. Judah sent for the youth to come to his house and marry his daughter. The youth, however, changed his mind on the matter of residence, and refused to come to Düren, stating however that he was ready to marry his bride if and when she came to live in Rothenburg. Thus it is apparent that the youth was intending to exact money from R. Judah. Therefore, it is my opinion that the youth be forced either to marry his bride on her terms, or divorce her. First, it is obvious that at the time of her betrothal the bridegroom had intended to settle in Düren. Secondly, his father had explicitly agreed with R. Judah to the youth's change of abode. Therefore, we assume that the youth also had agreed to it, since a young son does not dare to oppose his father and usually subscribes to the father's arrangement of his affairs. Again in agreements arising between the various parties interested in a marriage, the conditions apparently implied, though not expressly stated, are presumed to form part of such agreements (see Git. 65b; Ket. 54b; 79a; B. B. 132a). Thus, in our case, it is apparent that R. Judah did not intend to have his daughter leave him and her mother and remove from the country of her birth, and suffer privation in Rothenburg with her poverty stricken husband; that he did not intend to spend the large sum of money required to finance the safe conduct of one who was the daughter of a magnate whose name was known throughout the countries. Thus, the overlord of Rothenburg acting on the mere rumor [that R. Judah's daughter was coming to settle in Rothenburg] already sought ways of subjugating R. Judah to his will [using his daughter as a hostage]. Finally, according to the Talmud (Ket. 110b) a husband cannot force his wife to move from a humble to a more sumptuous dwelling since she can hold that such change of abode, even though it was for the better, would cause her many inconveniences. Any woman who gives plausible reasons against the change of abode demanded by her husband, therefore, cannot be forced to undertake such a change. In our case the bride's reasons against a change of abode are numerous and reasonable. Therefore, the youth ought to be forced by flagellation or the use of the ban either to marry his bride or to divorce her. This case was already brought before us last year, and we decided in the bride's favor. Because of these reasons, I have agreed to ban and chastise the bridegroom until he either marry his bride on her terms or divorce her. If he refuses to comply with our order he shall bear his sin and those who support him shall likewise suffer. None is excluded from our ban, excepting, of course, our honored teacher Rabbi Meir. Rabbenu Gershom requires that a husband be coerced into divorcing his rebellious wife lest the latter turn to mischief. Although many authorities disagree with Rabbenu Gershom and we do not follow his decision, in cases similar to the one at hand, however, we must protect the daughters of Israel lest unscrupulous youths use the inability and unwillingness of daughters of rich men to change their place of residence, as a means of extorting money from their fathers. Signed: Samuel b. Salomo (Pr. 250)."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.280.7","Wailing and complaint that cannot be silenced, arose because of Jacob b. Moses who betrothed the daughter of R. Judah…. The bridegroom may be coerced either to marry the bride on her terms or divorce her. R. Tam decided that a court must compel a levir to marry, or give <i>halitzah</i> to his brother's childless widow, even by the use of force; and that it is even permissible to have Gentiles use force on the levir until he comply with the decision of the Jewish court. Although according to the Jerusalem Talmud whenever the Mishna fails expressly to allow the use of coercion we can use no physical compulsion (Ket. 11, 7), and although the ban is a strong form of coercion, nevertheless, since R. Tam allowed the use of physical compulsion (in a case where the Mishna does not expressly allow the use of such measures, cf. B. Yeb. 39a) we ought to ban the bridegroom until he comply with our decision. Moreover, custom changes law; whenever we are uncertain regarding a certain law, we observe and follow the accepted practice. Thus, the custom is universally accepted of performing the marriage ceremony in the house of the bride's father. Therefore, we invoked against the youth all the curses great and small, until he comply with our decision. Signed Jacob b. Rabbi Joseph (Pr. 251)."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.280.8","To our Rabbis of Germany, your love has obliged me to express my opinion regarding the above. Since witnesses testify to the fact that there was a stipulated condition at the time of the betrothal, such condition is binding and the bridegroom must live up to its terms. Even if there are no such witnesses, the fact that his father-in-law kept him in his house together with his teacher, even though he returned home because of illness, proves that the father-in-law intended that the wedding take place in his house. It is difficult to imagine that the latter intended to brave the grave danger of sending his daughter and his money to Germany, which is very unsafe country. Furthermore, a man may not force his wife to leave her country and to come to live in his country. Therefore, we may force the bridegroom to do one of two things: either marry his bride and come to live in her place of residence, or divorce her. The Rabbis ought to coerce him by the use of chastisement and the ban, for fear lest his bride remain a deserted wife. We find many instances where the Rabbis decreed special laws and took extraordinary measures in order to prevent the possibility of a woman remaining a deserted wife. Signed: Yehiel b. Jacob ha Levi (Pr. 251)."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.280.9","To my teacher Rabbi Meir. I saw the decision of the judges in the case of the honorable R. Judah of Düren who betrothed his daughter to Jacob b. Moses of Rothenburg. At the time of the betrothal Moses agreed to send his son Jacob to Düren in order that he marry his bride there. Moses kept his agreement and sent his son to R. Judah. But, when the latter saw that Jacob was small in stature, homely, and despicable, he had pity on his daughter. Fearing lest she begin to despise her bridegroom, he sent Jacob back to his father to stay there till he grow up. When the bride grew up and R. Judah was told that Jacob also gained in strength, he sent for the latter to come and marry his bride. However, Moses refused to send Jacob to Düren. As time dragged on and R. Judah's daughter saw that her bridegroom refused to come to her, she sent a messenger to Rothenburg to demand that Jacob either marry her on the conditions previously agreed upon, or divorce her. But Jacob answered that he did not personally agree to move to Düren, that he did not join in his father's agreement on that score, that he would not come to her father's house, and that he would marry her only if she come to Rothenburg. Thereupon it was decided [by R. Meir] that she could not compel Jacob to move to Düren nor force him to divorce her. This decision, however, is very strange, and, in my opinion, is a perversion of justice for a number of reasons. a) Some of our great authorities quote the opinion of R. Tam to the effect that both the Mishna (Ket. 13, 10) and the Tosephta (Ket. 13, 2) which treat of the conditions under which a party to a marriage may be forced to remove to the place of residence of the other party, deal with forcing the husband to move to the place of residence of the wife. Therefore, the conclusion of both sources is that the husband who married a wife living in another country must move to that country. Again, whenever the talmudic sources state that the husband be so forced to move, the implication is that upon refusing to do so he must divorce his wife and pay her the <i>ketubah</i>. Next, it is well known that the bride's home is luxurious and comfortable [for which reason she ought not to be forced to remove to her husband's humble abode], that her traveling to Rothenburg would entail great difficulties and serious hazards since the entire road is infested with lurking dangers, and that her very stay in Rothenburg would be perilous because of her father's great reputation for wealth. Therefore, Jacob cannot force her to take such a step. Besides, even if she wanted to go to Rothenburg, her father's repeated objections would not allow her to do so, and she could do nothing about it. Therefore, this case is similar to the one quoted in the Mishna (Ket. 13, 5), in which case Admon decided that the bride might demand from her bridegroom that he either marry, or divorce her. Finally, Jacob is bound by his father's agreement, since it is customary for the parents of a couple to enter into all agreements governing the marriage, and for such agreements to be considered binding on the couple. Although the principle is accepted that ""the consent of the father does not imply the consent of the son (Kid. 45b)"", this principle applies only to the actual betrothal but not to the other arrangements appertaining thereto. Moreover, the fact that he came to live in Düren proves that he had agreed to his father's arrangement; while his having been sent home temporarily, because of illness, did not invalidate the original agreement."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.280.10","Therefore, it seems to me that the decision cited above was a perversion of justice, or, at least, against common sense, and not in the interest of the public welfare. For were we to accept the principle implied in your decision, the interests of the wealthy would suffer greatly. Thus many unscrupulous persons, knowing that the daughters of the rich cannot move away from their home towns, would betroth such women and then extort money from their fathers by refusing to marry them until either the women move away from their homeland, or their fathers pay exorbitant sums of money. And you, my teacher, R. Meir, how did you come to subscribe to such a decision? Everybody is wondering at this. For R. Judah is ready to fulfill all his previous promises and more; he wants Jacob and the bride also wants him. They are ready to give guarantees that they will not act treacherously against him; and, in case he does not want her, she is ready to accept her divorce and forego her <i>ketubah</i>. In the face of such facts, how can any Rabbi, student, or judge, give heed to those who insidiously demand that R. Judah's daughter come to live in Rothenburg, knowing full well that she can not do so! It is obvious that these persons are only interested in extorting money from R. Judah, and it is not becoming your dignity to uphold the cause of these extortionists. Should we allow an Israelite daughter to become a deserted wife because her father is averse to becoming a victim of extortion? I know that R. Judah did not acquiesce; that he could not bear the idea of being coerced and forced to part with his money; and that he sent inquiries to the elders, the greatest authorities of France, and to other places. It appears that those authorities have all agreed that Jacob ought to be forced to marry his bride on her own terms or to divorce her. Although you are the greatest authority of our generation, you will not find it easy to oppose the decision of our great authorities, lest dissensions multiply in Israel.

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.283.2","<i>A</i>. France, England, Germany, and Bohemia, are to be considered separate countries in reference to the laws of marriage, since a different language is spoken in each of these lands. It is indeed reasonable to assume that only territories within which a different language is spoken are to be considered as different countries in the above sense. Were we to consider Saxony, Franconia, Alsace, the Rhine province, and Bavaria, separate countries, then Palestine, a land of four hundred miles by four hundred miles, would have had to be considered a land containing more than three countries."

Subsequently, however, A went back to his father and then demanded that L follow him. L, who was in possession of the valuables of the household, refused to do so. Without L's knowledge or consent, her mother appeared before prominent persons and reached an agreement with A that L live out of town.

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.295.2","<i>A</i>. She is entitled to one-tenth of the immovables only. Although nowadays, because of the ordinance of the Saburaim, a woman collects her <i>ketubah</i>, and all other obligations stipulated therein, from movables, the dowry of a daughter is not an obligation included in the <i>ketubah</i>, and, therefore, is not included in the abovementioned ordinance."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.297.2","<i>A</i>. A Jew must honor his wife more than he honors himself. If one strikes one's wife, one should be punished more severely than for striking another person. For one is enjoined to honor one's wife but is not enjoined to honor the other person. Therefore, A must force his aunt to leave his house, and must promise to treat his wife honorably. If he persists in striking her, he should be excommunicated, lashed, and suffer the severest punishments, even to the extent of amputating his arm. If his wife is willing to accept a divorce, he must divorce her and pay her the <i>ketubah</i>."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.298.2","<i>A</i>. A must pay for his wife's sustenance since by his action he has shown that he had not decided to desist from his shameful practice. One deserves greater punishment for striking his wife than for striking another person, for he is enjoined to respect her. Far be it from a Jew to do such a thing. Had a similar case come before us we should hasten to excommunicate him. Thus, R. Paltoi Gaon rules that a husband who constantly quarrels with his wife must remove the causes of such quarrels, if possible, or divorce her and pay her the <i>ketubah</i>; how much more must a husband be punished, who not only quarrels but actually beats his wife."

Nowadays, however, there are many impudent and brazen women, and the above assumption is no longer true. Moreover, in this case there is reason to believe that L is lying since her husband has had children with a former wife. Even though he might have weakened since, we can put no trust in L's words. Therefore, we must not force the husband to grant L a divorce, but we ought to persuade him to do so."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.301.1","<i>Q</i>. L says that her husband is impotent and has had no sexual intercourse with her for the two years since their wedding day. She demands, therefore, that he divorce her and pay her the <i>ketubah</i>. L's husband admits that he is impotent but attributes this to his being bewitched."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.301.2","<i>A</i>. Since L's husband admits that he is impotent, there is not the slightest doubt that he must divorce her and pay her the <i>ketubah</i>. If L pleads that she wants to be free to remarry and to have children who will comfort and support her in her old age, we are permitted to force her husband, even by flagellation, to divorce her. If she enters no such plea, however, we can not force him by flagellation but we can by threats of dishonoring him. When he does divorce her he must pay her the <i>Ikkar ketubah</i> and her dowry, but is under no obligation to pay her the additional jointure. If she admits having brought in as dowry a sum less than the fifty pounds written in her <i>ketubah</i> — in your town these fifty pounds are interpreted to mean one hundred <i>marks</i> — she is entitled to such a sum only. If witnesses testify to the exact amount she brought in as her dowry, she is entitled to receive that amount only. If there are no witnesses, however, she is entitled to receive the full fifty pounds as her dowry. In case, however, her husband gave away his personal property as gifts to others to make it impossible for L to collect her <i>ketubah</i>, the following distinction must be made: If while granting the gifts he mentioned the contingency of his death, she is still entitled to collect her dowry from such gifts; if he gave his personal property away as outright gifts, however, she may not collect from these gifts. Should her husband brave the disapproval of the Rabbis and refuse to divorce her, we must add to her <i>ketubah</i> three denars per week for the entire period of his refusal."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.302.1",<i>Q</i>. A has been dripping blood for the past four years. During that period he refrained from sexual intercourse with his wife on the ground that his doctors forbade him to have intercourse as it endangered his life. Is A to be considered a rebellious husband and hence should three denars per week be added to his wife's <i>ketubah</i> for the period of his abstention?
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.302.2","<i>A</i>. Since A was forced by illness to refrain from intercourse with his wife, he is not to be considered a rebellious husband. A rebellious husband is one who refuses to live with his wife because he is angry with her or because he hates her. A person who is physically unable to live with his wife, however, is not considered a rebellious husband. A, however, must divorce his wife and must pay her the <i>ketubah</i>, since he is in the same category as a leper for whom coitus is harmful (Ket. 77b). Although A's sickness does not disable him permanently and is curable, we do not compel his wife to wait indefinitely in the hope that he might be cured. Thus Maimonides (M. T. Ishut 14, 7) rules that under such circumstances a woman must wait only six months. Although we have compared A to a leper for whom coitus is harmful, nevertheless we should not force A by flagellation to divorce his wife, but should only resort to persuasion. We should merely tell him the law requires him to divorce his wife and pay her the <i>ketubah</i>; should he refuse to do so, he would be called ""transgressor"". Whether A divorces her or not, however, we force him to pay his wife the <i>Ikkar ketubah</i> and her dowry, but we do not force him to pay her the additional jointure since some authorities hold the opinion that under the circumstances she is not entitled to the additional jointure. Should A's wife aver that she does not believe that A's doctors told him to refrain from sexual intercourse, and insist that he is a rebellious husband, he would have to take an oath in support of his assertions. Should A refuse to take the oath, we would have to add to his wife's <i>ketubah</i> three Tyrian denars per week for the entire period of his abstention. I have sufficient proof to support my view that the three denars prescribed by the Mishnah (Ket. 5, 7) mean Tyrian denars. Should A admit that he had refrained from sexual intercourse with his wife because he was angry with her and that he had lied about both his sickness and the advice of his doctors, and should he declare that he now desires to resume marital relations with her, the aforementioned amount would be added to her <i>ketubah</i> and she would be required to resume her marital duties. Regardless of what happened in the past, A may now claim that he is well and that he is able to live normally with his wife, since the truth of his claim is bound eventually to be proven or disproven."

Subsequently, A's son quarrelled with his wife and returned to his father's house. He appointed his father his trustee and the latter demanded that B return the dowry deposited with him since it was given to him for safe-keeping only. B claimed that he gave the money to his daughter while the young couple still lived happily together; that his daughter used the money in business since she was active in business and earned the income for the family, while her husband devoted all his time to studies; that A's son never asked him for the money, and that A never told him not to give the money to his daughter. B also mentioned his daughter's complaints that A's son did unmentionable things to her, conducting himself in a disgusting manner, and thus became hateful to her.

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.306.2","<i>A</i>. B must take an oath to the effect that he gave the money to his daughter while she was still living in peace and harmony with her husband, and thus be free from obligation. Since B's daughter was a rebellious wife she ought to be dealt with as such. I already wrote to you, while I was in Konstanze, my opinion regarding the law governing a rebellious wife. We follow the ordinance of the Geonim and permit her to keep all she brought to her husband as dowry (<i>Nikse Zon Barzel</i>), and whatever he brought is returned to him, nor is she entitled to the <i>Ikkar ketubah</i>; she is then to wait until either he consents to divorce her, or she decides to go back to him. If we suspect, however, that she does not dislike her husband but revolts against him because of financial considerations, or because her father, her mother, or her relatives induce her to quarrel with him, we take away from her even her dowry. In such a case we must follow the law in all its strictness and give all the possessions of the couple to the husband, for the ordinance of the Geonim mentioned above does not apply to the woman who rebels against her husband because she is persuaded to do so by others."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.307.2","<i>A</i>. Leah's father was justified in his act for a number of reasons: a) A woman who loathes her husband and demands a divorce is entitled to collect from her husband everything that is left of her dowry. There is no doubt, therefore, that she may retain such dowry. b) R. Jacob Tam took into consideration the fact that a father promises a dowry to his daughter in the expectation that she will live with her husband. He, therefore, ruled that a husband whose wife died before he collected her dowry, can no longer collect it. The same principle applies to our case. c) If a man seizes the property of a debtor for the benefit of a single creditor while the debtor owes money to other creditors, such seizure is of no avail, and the other creditors may take away said property. But, if the man who seized the property hands it over to the creditor for whose benefit he seized it, the act is valid and the other creditors can do nothing about it. In our case, too, Leah already received the money from her father."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.308.1","<i>Q</i>. Within the first year of her marriage to A, L claimed that she detested him and could not live with him. Before their marriage, money had been given to L by her father, as a present, on condition that A never have a right to it. L, therefore, demanded this money and the accrued income thereof. On the other hand, L's father had promised a dowry to A but had postponed the date of delivery of such dowry, having expressed the fear that L might rebel against her husband within the first year of her marriage. A, therefore, demands the dowry from L's father."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.308.2","<i>A</i>. Although no present can be given to a married woman on condition that her husband have no right thereto, such a present may be given to her during the period of betrothal and thereupon the husband will have no right to such present or the income thereof. Therefore, the present and the accrued income must be returned to L. This decision is effective only if L's dislike of A is deep and genuine and is not induced by anyone. The community must pronounce the ban (<i>herem</i>) against anyone holding information relative to this matter; and if it be discovered that someone has induced L to rebel against A, then the money may be withheld from her as a punishment until she repents. The court always has a right to punish one even unduly, if such punishment will help to check lawlessness and indecency. In this case the punishment of L will serve as a warning to other women. Moreover, should A desire to marry another woman, I believe that he should be permitted to throw a bill of divorcement to L even against her will, since she is the rebellious party. A, however, is not entitled to the dowry promised to him by L's father, since the latter had expressed his intention of giving such dowry only in the event that L and A lived happily together."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.309.1","<i>Q</i>. A promised under a ban that he would never deal treacherously with his wife, L, and that should he break his promise, he would give her half of his money. Subsequently he broke his promise, whereupon L left him and he paid her half of his money in accordance with his agreement. They later became reconciled to each other, however, and lived together again in harmony and love until her mother persuaded her to leave him. Now A demands the return of his wife and the restoration of his money."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.309.2","<i>A</i>. If A's promise was not accompanied by a <i>Kinyan</i> made before an authoritative court, it was merely an <i>Asmakhta</i> and was void. L, then, must restore the money to A. He should atone in a manner that the Rabbi might prescribe for him for having transgressed the ban. Although a rebellious wife is entitled to receive the money she brought with her as her dowry, L is not entitled to such money since she did not rebel against A of her own accord, but was persuaded to do so by her mother. Thus the communities, [at their synod held] in Würzburg, passed an ordinance to the effect that whenever a woman shall be led to rebel against her husband through the persuasions of her relatives, and shall refuse to heed all warnings, all the possessions of the couple shall become the sole property of her husband, and he shall be permitted to divorce her, even against her will, without giving her a penny. I believe that all Israel should abide by this ordinance which was instituted for the public benefit, especially since the money of the couple belongs to the husband according to talmudic law, and we need not resort to an ordinance. Since the law prescribes that whatever a woman acquires belongs to her husband (Gitt. 77b), why should we seek to infringe upon his rights, and especially in a case where the woman loves her husband, but was merely persuaded by her relatives to rebel against him, and where, therefore, there is no fear lest she resort to mischief? In such a case we must follow the law in all its strictness and give all the possessions of the couple to the husband, for the ordinance of the Geonim to the effect that the dowry be returned to the rebellious wife does not apply to the wife who rebelled against her husband not for personal reasons, but because she was persuaded to do so by others."

A disclaims signing such bond, and denies having squandered any money or being guilty of any improper behavior. He denies having abstracted the money from B's daughter for the purpose of squandering it, but says that he had taken it only because he was afraid lest B rob him of his money and deprive him of his wife, as B had done with his other sons-in-law."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.310.2","A further claims that B turned him over to a wicked Gentile who almost murdered him. A, therefore, demands that B be punished. B, on the other hand, gives a different account of the affair. He says that a Gentile, a violent man, placed a <i>mark</i> (8 ounces) of gold in pledge with him; and he, in turn, deposited it with A. When A wanted to leave town, B fearing lest the Gentile bring false accusations against him upon failing to produce the pledge, demanded that A return the gold <i>mark</i> to him. A invited B to go to the Gentile, and promised to free B from obligation to the Gentile. The Gentile, however, refused to listen to A and warned B that he (the Gentile) would collect double its value should his gold <i>mark</i> be lost. B, therefore, grabbed A by the clothes and said to the Gentile that his gold <i>mark</i> was in A's possession. The Gentile, then, angered by A's words made extreme threats against A. Nevertheless, A suffered no bodily injury nor any loss of money on account of this incident."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.310.3","<i>A</i>. If the agreement was made at the time of the betrothal, it is binding on A. At a betrothal, verbal agreements are binding, and whenever verbal promises are binding — as in charity-gifts, Temple-gifts, or vows — they are binding even when made in the form of conditional promises which are usually classified as <i>asmakhta</i>. If the money in question was part of the dowry given by B to his daughter, the agreement is certainly binding on A. Moreover, even if the agreement was entered into after the betrothal, it would also be binding if it was accompanied by a <i>kinyan</i> made before the notables of the community, who normally constitute an authoritative court."

Therefore, the elders of the community should endeavor to persuade both parties to a speedy divorce without resorting to coercion of either party. Upon the granting of the divorce the woman should receive only what she actually brought in as dowry, but not the full fifty pounds of dowry written in her <i>ketubah</i>; for when the husband received her dowry and evaluated it at fifty pounds, though actually it was worth less, he did so because he wanted to marry her and live with her. Now that she refuses to live with him she loses the extra value placed on her dowry, the additional jointure promised her by the husband, as well as the 200 <i>zuzin</i> prescribed by the Talmud. Though in this country the same amount of dowry is written in the <i>ketubah</i> of a rich as in that of a poor bride, irrespective of the amount she actually brings in, in order not to shame the brides who bring in a small dowry, this rebellious wife is not entitled to collect the full amount of dowry written in her <i>ketubah</i>, since she never lived with her husband."

Isaac di Trani? One may not object that such favorable treatment would encourage many women to rebel against their husbands; Heaven forfend, Jewish daughters are not suspected of such malefaction. They prefer to stay married even in adverse circumstances, and would not seek a divorce unless actually driven thereto."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.317.1","<i>Q</i>. Leah rebelled against her husband A, the son of Mendel Kern. When warned that she might lose her <i>ketubah</i> and the dowry (which she brought in upon her marriage) and that she might be forced to wait for many years for her divorce she threatened, among other things, to go and live among the Gentiles. Since the women of Regensburg were always arrogant in their relations to their husbands and now are even more supercilious than ever, Leah should be dealt with in a manner that would serve as a warning to her haughty sisters. A should be permitted to remarry immediately in accordance with the view of R. Eliezer b. Nathan, while Leah should be forced to wait for her divorce for many years. However, Leah should not be left entirely to the mercy of her husband who, after marrying another woman, might demand an exorbitant sum for Leah's divorce, or might refuse to divorce her altogether. We, therefore, leave it to you to decide upon a proper punishment for Leah."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.317.2","<i>A</i>. In order to curtail the possibility of Jewish women turning to mischief, and in order that people might not say: ""This one is A's wife and this one his paramour"", we should not permit the husband to remarry before he divorces his rebellious wife. Therefore, A should receive a limited amount of money and give Leah her divorce, or, he should give Leah a divorce on condition that the divorce become valid (from now and) twelve months, or two years, after date. After the delivery of such a conditional divorce, A may be permitted to remarry immediately. If, however, Leah had good reason to detest her husband, she should be dealt with more leniently. Therefore, you should use your judgment in determining the severity with which Leah is to be punished."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.318.2","<i>A</i>. If the garments are not now in the husband's possession, or if they were identified in his possession as L's garments, he must return them to L, for a wife's garments are in the category of objects that are usually lent or rented out, regarding which one may not claim that he has bought them (Sheb. 46b). If no one, however, saw the garments in the husband's possession, we uphold his claim; since if he wanted to lie he could have denied having taken them."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.319.1","<i>Q</i>. A's wife bound herself by a ban in the presence of the people of the town, not to do a certain thing. The terms of the ban were written down, and all the townfolk signed the document. Subsequently she transgressed the ban several times, as attested to by witnesses. A transgressing woman, if properly forwarned, loses the right to her <i>ketubah</i>. We are doubtful, however, whether A's wife had to be properly forewarned before losing her right to the <i>ketubah</i>. We are inclined to believe that no such forewarning was necessary since she was warned at the time the ban was pronounced that she would lose the right to her <i>ketubah</i> should she transgress the ban, and she agreed thereto without inserting any qualifying conditions. Does A's wife lose the right to her <i>ketubah?</i> Furthermore, is A permitted to divorce her against her will?"
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.319.2","<i>A</i>. Even if proper forewarning were required before a transgressing woman loses her right to the <i>ketubah</i>, one such warning would be sufficient. Otherwise a woman would be able, without any restraint, continually to cause her husband to sin. For, when forewarned by witnesses, she would temporarily abstain from sin, and, later, return to her mischief. Moreover, any situation that would require the administration of testing-water to a <i>Sotah</i> (a woman suspected of faithlessness), would cause her to lose the right to her <i>ketubah;</i> and the forewarning of a jealous husband, even though preceding by many days the seclusion of his wife with another man, would require the administration of testing-water, as evidenced by the statement of the Baraita (Yeb. 58b): the jealous forewarning of a betrothed would require the administration of testing-water after she married [if she secluded herself with that other man after the marriage took place]. Therefore, a forewarning does not necessarily have to precede a transgression immediately."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.319.3","The question was again sent to R. Meir: A's wife brought witnesses who testified before us that A also had transgressed the ban. We decided, therefore, that she did not lose the right to her <i>ketubah</i>, since she did not intend to commit a sin. Moreover, a woman must be forewarned immediately before committing a sin in order to be classified as a transgressing woman. The Baraita cited above offers no proof to the contrary since it deals with a case where the sinful seclusion immediately followed the jealous forewarning (i. e. the seclusion took place before the marriage)."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.319.4","<i>A</i>. I still believe that a forewarning does not necessarily have to precede the transgression immediately. Thus Rashi offers two interpretations of the aforementioned Baraita. The first, and most important, interpretation assumes that the seclusion took place after the marriage, and, thus, long after the jealous forewarning. Moreover, the Talmud (Sotah 26a) clearly states that a woman who was jealously forewarned before her marriage and secluded herself with another man after the marriage, must either drink the testing-water or lose the right to her <i>ketubah</i>. However, since A too has transgressed the ban, we must make two distinctions. a) If the wife's sin consisted of merely disregarding the ban, while her act was not sinful in itself, A is not permitted to divorce her; for transgressing a ban causes the death of the transgressor's children, and is, therefore, ground for divorce; but, since A himself transgressed the ban, he can have no objection to a similar act on the part of his wife. b) If A's wife, however, transgressed Mosaic law and Jewish custom, A is permitted to divorce her even against her will; he need not seek the consent of the communities, and he is not required to pay her the <i>ketubah</i>."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.320.1","<i>Q</i>. Up to the present the custom was prevalent in our country to enforce the collection of <i>ketuboth</i> written many years previously to their being presented for collection even when such <i>ketuboth</i> bore witnesses' signatures that were not known to the court. Recently, however, some defendants disputed the authenticity of a certain <i>ketubah</i> and demanded legal identification of the signatures on the document. Since no such identification was possible, the case was protracted by the defendants and the woman was forced to reach a compromise and accept a less amount than that written in her <i>ketubah</i>. From now on this procedure will probably be followed by all other defendants in similar cases [which will cause great hardship to widows and divorcees]. I have before me a Responsum of Rabbi Menahem who rules that a woman who lost her <i>ketubah</i>-document did not thereby lose her right even to the additional jointure. Although the consensus of opinion is that the additional jointure is also considered a <i>maase beth-din</i> (an obligation imposed by the Rabbis on all husbands, the existence of which obligation, therefore, need not be proved), it is considered a <i>maase beth-din</i> only in those countries where a standard <i>ketubah</i> is written for all women, containing a fixed amount of dowry and additional jointure. In our country, however, there is no general standard and each family has its own custom in this matter. Those families who follow a definite custom and write the same <i>ketubah</i> for all the women of the particular family, would encounter no difficulty on this score, as each woman would be entitled to collect as her <i>ketubah</i> the amount fixed in her family. Sometimes, however, the custom of the family is not clear and is not known even to the members of the family. In such cases the Geonim rule that when a woman has lost her <i>ketubah-</i>document, the <i>ketuboth</i> of three members of her family are to be examined and the woman should be entitled to receive the smallest of the three amounts written in these <i>ketuboth</i>. In our case, however, the <i>ketubah-</i>document was not lost and its money clause is written plainly; why should the woman be forced to take a lesser amount? Sometimes a woman has no family, or we do not know to what family she belongs, or all her relatives are dead. We should not permit that an identification of the signatures by a court be required before a woman can collect her <i>ketubah</i>, since in many cases indeed no such identification of signatures is possible even in <i>ketuboth</i> that are brought to court a short time after the wedding. Indeed, legal endorsement of <i>ketuboth</i> at the time of the wedding should have been required, but we never heard that our forefathers or teachers insisted upon such endorsement. Moreover, we should restrain a husband from living with his wife unless her <i>ketubah</i> bears a legal endorsement, since without such endorsement her <i>ketubah</i> is useless. Why is no attention paid to this matter? Perhaps the reason is that, unlike bonds and notes of indebtedness, the identification of the signatures on <i>ketuboth</i> is not required and not necessary. Perhaps also we do not suspect that women would forge <i>ketuboth</i>, for the reason that not one woman in a thousand knows how to write, nor are women familiar with the required legal phraseology. Nor do we suspect that persons who know how to write would be so degraded as to write forged <i>ketuboth</i> for the benefit of others."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.320.2","<i>A</i>. I have considered your problem in all its aspects and could find no solution for it, unless each family should write an equal amount of additional jointure for all its members. If a family has no established custom of writing a uniform <i>ketubah</i> for all its members, the procedure prescribed by the Geonim and mentioned above, must be followed, unless the signatures on the <i>ketubah</i> can be identified. We do indeed suspect that the woman had a scribe write a forged <i>ketubah</i> for her, or even that a scribe wrote several <i>ketuboth</i> for her which she expects to present for collection at different courts."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.320.3","S<small>OURCES</small>: Sinai VI (1943) 7–8 no. 408. Cf. Isserlein, <i>Pesakim</i> 232."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.321.1",<i>Q</i>. L's husband was killed on a day of rioting and massacre. L lost her <i>ketubah-</i>document; is she entitled to collect her <i>ketubah</i>?
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.321.2","<i>A</i>. L is entitled to collect the <i>Ikkar ketubah</i>, since no document is required to prove the existence of an obligation classified as <i>maase-beth-din</i>, an obligation imposed by the Rabbis on all husbands alike, as a mere verbal claim of having discharged such obligation is of no avail unless one can produce documentary evidence (B. M. 17b). Therefore, if L can prove through witnesses that her husband married her as a maiden, she will be entitled to collect two hundred <i>zuzim</i> as her <i>Ikkar ketubah</i>; otherwise she will be entitled to collect only one hundred <i>zuzim</i>. As to the fifty pounds of dowry and fifty pounds of additional jointure that we generally include in the <i>ketubah</i> of our wives, I am doubtful whether these sums may be considered as <i>maase-beth-din</i>. It seems to me, however, that since we have a firmly established custom throughout our kingdom to write the aforementioned amounts in the <i>ketubah</i> of all maidens, the same law should apply to these amounts as to a <i>maase-beth-din</i>. We should, therefore, not put forth the claim, for the benefit of the heirs, that the widow has already received payment of the dowry and the additional jointure. Moreover, since witnesses testify that L and her husband lived a normal married life when he was killed, we can not put forth the claim that she has already received payment of the aforementioned amounts, for we have no reason for supposing that the husband deposited valuables with L to be used in payment of her <i>ketubah</i>. Thus Rabbi Simon of Jointville ruled that when a man suddenly dies we need not suppose that he deposited valuables with his wife to be used by her in payment of her <i>ketubah</i>, for while he is alive the <i>ketubah</i> is not an obligation requiring payment, and as long as he is well, he does not think of the possibility of his death."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.322.1","<i>Q</i>. How much money is a woman entitled to collect as her <i>ketubah</i>, upon divorce or the death of her husband?"
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.322.2","<i>A</i>. The amount of money to which a woman is entitled as her <i>ketubah</i>, is dependent on local custom. In Würzburg and its vicinity, the dowry and the additional jointure are valued at one hundred pounds of two <i>marks</i> per pound; in the Rhine communities, it seems to me, they are valued at one hundred <i>marks</i>. These sums do not include the <i>Ikkar ketubah</i> of two hundred <i>zuzim</i>, or five hundred pennyweights of silver, each <i>zuz</i> equalling two and one half pennyweights of silver. If no custom, as to the value of the <i>ketubah</i>, exists in your town, you should follow the custom of the town where the wedding took place. If no such custom exists there, you ought to follow the custom of the community nearest to you to which you usually look for guidance. But, if no such custom exists in the latter, the women of your locality are entitled to collect one hundred pounds of the coins current there, plus five hundred pennyweights of silver. Before a woman may collect her <i>ketubah</i> she must take an oath that she did not give away or waste (while her husband was alive or after his death) anything belonging to her husband, and that she did not retain anything for herself. Everything she takes from the husband's house, such as her bedding or her clothes even, is to be appraised and deducted from her <i>ketubah</i>. The orphans are to pay the balance due her either in real property or in moveable property, whichever they prefer."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.322.3","S<small>OURCES</small>: L. 182; <i>Tashbetz</i>, 457."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.323.1","<i>Q</i>. What is the value of the one hundred pounds that a person obligates himself, in the <i>ketubah</i> document, to pay to his wife in case of death or divorce?"
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.323.2","<i>A</i>. In Würzburg a well established local custom is followed to permit a woman to collect two hundred <i>marks</i>. This custom, however, is not logical, for the term ""pound"" is thus interpreted to mean a pound by weight (16 ounces) which is equivalent to two <i>marks</i>. But if this interpretation is correct why do we not explicitly write in the <i>ketubah</i>: ""one hundred pounds by weight""? Thus, I once saw my teacher and relative Rabbi Judah haKohen order the insertion of such phrase in the <i>ketubah</i> of one of his relatives. Since, however, we unqualifiedly write ""one hundred pounds"", we probably mean the coin ""pound"" and refer to the largest money unit current in the particular town. Rabbi Simha established the custom of paying the widow or divorcee one hundred <i>marks</i> as her <i>ketubah</i>, thus interpreting the above mentioned phrase to mean one hundred pounds of heavy coins (<span dir=""rtl"">ליבריינ""ש</span>), one pound of which is equivalent to a <i>mark</i>. Indeed, I have heard that in Worms only one hundred pounds <i>Heller</i> are paid; this custom of paying pounds current in the particular town seems to me preferable to all other customs. However, one must follow the custom of his locality. In the absence of a local custom, the custom of the town where the wedding took place should be followed. If no custom exists in this town either, one should pay one hundred pounds of the coins current in his present place of abode or in the town where the wedding took place — whichever is of lower value<xref rid=""fn10"">*</xref>."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.324.2",<i>A</i>. The opinion of R. Simon b. Gamaliel (Ket. 110b) is accepted that a woman is entitled to the <i>ketubah</i> current in the locality where her marriage took place.
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.324.3","b) <i>Q</i>. After A died L took over, and managed, his estate. Why, then, did you write that the estate was considered, nevertheless, to be in the possession of the orphans?"
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.324.4","<i>A</i>. R. Hananel decided that the estate managed by the widow is considered to be in the possession of the orphans. The widow is merely a managing trustee. Therefore, all the profit accruing because of her management, belongs to the orphans and she can not collect her <i>ketubah</i> therefrom. When the widow demands her <i>ketubah</i> she loses her right to receive her sustenance from the estate. She must, then, take an oath while holding the Scroll of the Law; and whatever she thus states under oath to have given away, or to have retained for herself, to have given to her daughter, or to have given to charity, is deducted from her <i>ketubah</i>."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.324.5","c) <i>Q</i>. L lent some of the money to lords and ""men of violence"", and it is doubtful whether the latter will pay their debts."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.324.6","<i>A</i>. L is responsible for these bad investments. Ordinarily when heirs pay the <i>ketubah</i> to a widow, they may give her in payment any kind of property, or any object even bran; but they cannot pay her by transferring to her money due them from others, since the collection of debts often involves litigations to which a woman is not accustomed. However, in our case, the orphans may transfer to L the money she has invested with the lords and the ""men of violence"", in payment of her <i>ketubah</i>, since she had no right to make such unsafe investments."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.324.7",d) <i>Q</i>. While L managed the estate she gave presents to certain persons thinking she had the right to do so. Are the orphans entitled to take back the presents?
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.324.8","<i>A</i>. The recipients are entitled to retain these presents since they may claim that L gave them out of her own property, and since it appears that the market ordinance (<i>takkanat hashuk</i>) was to apply to property given away as presents."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.324.9","e) <i>Q</i>. Do we put forth the claim for the benefit of the orphans that L may have been a widow when she married A, or that A may have paid her one <i>Mina</i>.?"
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.324.10","<i>A</i>. We surely put forth the above claims for the benefit of the orphans. However, if a report circulates that L was a virgin when she married A, she is entitled to the <i>ketubah</i> of a virgin, since the majority of women are married while virgins. [The principle of ""a majority of cases"" presumes that what is true in most instances, is also true in our case.] Although in litigation over money matters the principle of ""a majority of cases"" is not a factor, it is so when the claimant is in actual possession of the litigated money. In our case, L is in actual possession of the money; therefore, the combination of a ""majority"" and a ""report"" in her favor, is conclusive."

But the <i>ketubah</i> did not specify whether the coin ""pound"" [the value of which differed in each locality] was meant, or the weight ""pound"" [which equalled two <i>marks</i>, or sixteen ounces of silver] was meant. How much is the woman entitled to collect?"
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.325.2","<i>A</i>. It all depends upon the custom of the place where the woman married. In Würzburg and its surrounding country, the one hundred pounds of the <i>ketubah</i> are interpreted to mean two hundred <i>marks</i>. On the Rhine, there are places where the one hundred pounds of the <i>ketubah</i> are interpreted to mean one hundred pounds <i>Heller</i>. If the woman comes from a place where there is no established custom, she receives two hundred pounds of the coin current in her locality."

Are we to believe her statement (in accordance with the rule of <i>Miggo</i>), since if she had wanted to lie she might have claimed that said articles were part of her dowry?"
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.326.2","<i>A</i>. A mere claim to the effect that the articles had formed part of her <i>ketubah</i> would have been insufficient.

Rabbi Asher refused to come, but Rabbi Zamlan implored him and pleaded with him saying: ""What can I do for my only son who, after my death, will have to go begging from door to door?"" Rabbi Asher then agreed to act as a witness, and Rabbi Zamlan gave away to his son and to other persons, all of his property as an outright gift effective immediately. After his death, L's relatives summoned Rabbi Zamlan's son to the court of Rabbi Perez. The latter recorded the claims of the two parties and sent the claims to Rabbi Meir without giving the names of the litigants and without expressing any opinion on the subject. Rabbi Meir ruled that L was entitled to collect her <i>ketubah</i>, or to draw her sustenance, from the possessions of Rabbi Zamlan which he had given to his son; his reason being that even an outright gift to an heir is considered an inheritance and that the widow's <i>ketubah</i> is a lien upon it."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.331.2",Rabbi Perez took issue with Rabbi Meir quoting Alfasi's decision that the ordinance of Usha — which ruled that a person who divided all of his property among his children may derive his sustenance as well as that of his wife's from such property — was not accepted.

But, when Rabbi Perez, in his second letter, gave the names of the litigants, R. Meir realized that the letters from L's relatives dealt with the same case. R. Meir recalled that among these letters was found a letter from Rabbi Asher which explained the circumstances of the gift mentioned above. Therefore, R. Meir added (in his second letter to Rabbi Perez) that since according to Rabbi Asher's letter, the donor mentioned the contingency of death when he summoned Rabbi Asher, he therefore made the gift to his son <i>causa mortis</i> (cf.

Leah, therefore, demanded her <i>ketubah</i> from this property. A's sons, then, produced a document to the effect that A, foregoing the required oath, permitted his mother to take the property of his deceased father in payment of her <i>ketubah</i>, and bestowed upon her as a gift whatever amount the property was worth in excess of her <i>ketubah</i>. Leah, however, claimed that as soon as her father-in-law died, his property, automatically falling to her husband, was subject to the lien of her <i>ketubah</i>, and that A, therefore, had no right to waive the oath his mother was required to take and to bestow gifts upon her without her (Leah's) permission."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.332.2","<i>A</i>. The property belongs to the grandchildren who were already born at the time the gift was made by A's mother, and Leah cannot collect her <i>ketubah</i> therefrom. We have no proof that A's mother received more than the amount specified in the <i>ketubah</i>. A's document bestowing on his mother as a gift whatever she received over and above her <i>ketubah</i> does not prove that she actually received more than was due her. Leah's claim that A had no right to bestow gifts without her permission is valid only in regard to real property, but a husband may sell or give away personal property without his wife's permission. Therefore, A's mother had a right to give her property to A and to his children. Moreover, since Leah is not certain that A's mother collected more than her <i>ketubah</i>, and can take no oath to that effect, the property goes to A's children."

Regarding the books, however, if witnesses did not see B's books in A's possession, A would be entitled to retain them upon taking an oath in support of his claim.

Furthermore, when L gave her money to B she stipulated that he clothe and sustain her son and daughter, that he hire teachers for her son, and that he provide a dowry for her daughter. When C grew up, B decided to dissolve his partnership with C in the books. He invited the worthies of the community and in their presence the books were equally divided by lot between B and C.

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.339.2","<i>A</i>. This is a highly controversial subject. The court of Würzburg — and I believe also of Speyer, following a decision by R.

However, we follow the ruling of Rav and Samuel (ibid.) that the entire estate belongs to the heirs. According to our opinion, therefore, even if the donee has already taken possession of the widow's gift, it should be returned to the heirs; but, if the donee has originally taken possession of the gift at the instruction of a court, we usually uphold the court's decision on the assumption that the court has followed the opinion of R. Eliezer (ibid. 48b). However, you state that the court has also decided that L's heirs have no claim on A's estate; they followed, therefore, the opinion of Rav and Samuel.

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.340.1","<i>Q</i>. Leah, A's widow who was now the wife of C, had taken the proper oath regarding her <i>ketubah</i> before a court, whereupon the court had transferred to her A's house in payment of her <i>ketubah</i>.

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.340.2","<i>A</i>. Since A was the legal heir to the house, B had no power to terminate A's normal right of conveying his inheritance to his heirs (cf. B. B. 133a). Therefore, B's stipulation limiting A's normal right of inheritance was void; the house unreservedly belonged to A, and Leah, his widow, had the right to collect her <i>ketubah</i> therefrom."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.341.1","1) <i>Q</i>. A married a widow, B, and lived with her for eight years till her death. B had not taken the customary widow's oath regarding her <i>ketubah</i> due her from her former husband. When she married A she was not considered very rich and no one suspected that she owned more than the value of her <i>ketubah</i>. But, after her death, when A declared, under oath, to the community (leaders, probably for purposes of taxation) the value of his assets, it was discovered that he had inherited from B more than the value of her <i>ketubah</i> from her former husband. The heirs of the latter, therefore, demand that A return the excess to them."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.341.2","<i>A</i>. If the valuables B brought to A were undistinguishable and no one recognized them as having belonged to B's former husband, A is free from obligation for five reasons. a) Even if the valuables B brought to A were worth more than the value of her <i>ketubah</i>, such valuables may not all necessarily have come from the estate of her former husband, for she might have received some gifts or found a treasure. b) Were B still alive she would have been obliged to take an oath [to the effect that she did not take from her former husband more than the value of her <i>ketubah</i>], but now that she is dead, A is free from the obligation of taking an oath, since he is not supposed to know his wife's affairs. c) A is not even required to take the oath of an heir — that B never told him, and that he did not know that she had received from the estate of her former husband more than the value of her <i>ketubah</i> — since the heirs of B's former husband are not positive in their claim. The heirs, however, may pronounce the ban (<i>herem</i>) in the synagogue against anyone who does possess such knowledge and does not reveal it. Such ban would include A. d) Whatever a person would have retained, had he taken an oath, his heirs may retain without the necessity of taking an oath. e) Some authorities require A to take the oath of an heir; but since many great authorities absolve him from such oath, and since A is in possession of the aforesaid valuables, the burden of proof is upon the plaintiff. For similar reasons A would be free from the obligation of taking an oath, even if some of the valuables brought to him by B were distinguishable and were recognized as having belonged to B's former husband, if the valuables thus recognized were in themselves not worth more than the value of B's <i>ketubah</i>. But, if the distinguishable valuables are in themselves worth more than the value of B's <i>ketubah</i>, A must return the difference to the heirs of B's first husband."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.341.3","2) <i>Q</i>. Witnesses have testified to the effect that B and her former husband, C, had made a binding agreement that in the event of the death of one party, the surviving party would share the property with the heirs. After C's death, B settled with all of C's heirs, except the youngest, D, who was born after the drawing up of the agreement. D, therefore, is now pressing his claim."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.341.4","<i>A</i>. D was entitled to his share even though he was born after the agreement was made, for in it B did not bestow benefits on anybody; she merely relinquished her rights to C's property up to a certain extent, and D later became heir to the relinquished property. However, A may claim that B brought him nothing from C's estate, or he may contend that B had already settled with D, and be free from obligation for the reasons enumerated above."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.342.1","<i>Q</i>. A drew up a legal document in which he used the following words: ""Effective as of today, but to be executed after our (meaning himself and his wife, L) deaths, our daughter R shall inherit an equal share with her brothers, those already born and those that might be born, in whatever will remain of my estate."" After A's death, his children and his widow, L, interpreted the document to mean that A had appointed L trustee over his estate. When L proved a very inefficient, careless, and wasteful trustee, A's sons reached an agreement with L, whereby she was to receive forty <i>marks</i> for turning over the estate to A's sons immediately. Before relinquishing her trusteeship, L and her youngest son B (who was eighteen years of age) agreed to allow R's husband to take his wife's share of the estate immediately, without having to wait for L's death. A's two other sons object to this latter agreement."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.342.2","<i>A</i>. A's heirs were entitled to take over his estate at any time they wished to do so. The giving of forty <i>marks</i> to L in order that she relinquish her trusteeship, was entirely unnecessary, for A's document, while making the collection of R's share in A's estate dependant on L's death, did not appoint L trustee of said estate. Moreover, had A explicitly appointed L trustee of his estate, the court would have removed her at no expense to the heirs, since she had proven to be inefficient, careless, and wasteful. The second agreement is not binding on A's two sons since L, not being a trustee of the estate, had no legal power to dispose of part of the estate. B, however, was able to forego his own part of R's share, and his act is binding upon such part if R (or her husband) was in possession of her share at the time of the latter agreement. Thus R would be entitled to receive one third of her share (B's part of her share) immediately, while B's two brothers would manage the other two-thirds for their own profit and gain until L's death."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.342.3","Although the brothers are entitled to manage R's share for their own profit, they are not permitted to sell or otherwise alienate any part of it; and their responsibility thereto would be that of a gratuitous watchman. Thus any increase that will accrue until L's death will belong to the brothers, while, any decrease of value caused by theft, loss or unavoidable accident will be suffered by R. Should the brothers be called upon to pay L her <i>ketubah</i>, one quarter of such payment should come out of R's share. R may not claim that her father has made her an outright gift, free of any lien or obligation, since A did not intend to give R a greater share than that of his sons. After L's death, R may exact an oath from her brothers to the effect that they did not retain for themselves anything belonging to her."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.342.4","2) <i>Q</i>. L's trustee claimed that L's property which she had given to her husband, had been given only to gratify him, but had not been intended as an outright gift. Therefore, this property had belonged to L; and she gave it to her mother by right."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.342.5","<i>A</i>. This property was not listed in L's <i>ketubah</i>, and was thus considered <i>niksei melug</i> regarding which a woman may not claim that her gift thereof to her husband was not actually meant to be binding but was given in order to gratify him (B. B. 50a). Therefore, the gift was binding, and she no longer had any claim to said property. She had no right to give it to her mother."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.344.1","<i>Q</i>. A rented a house to B for five years and received the rent for the entire period in advance. He promised to repay B the expenses for any structures he might erect in the house, and gave him a written guaranty to this effect. B spent six pounds on such structures. Subsequently, A died and his widow, L, took over the house in payment of her <i>ketubah</i>."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.344.2","<i>A</i>. B must vacate the house; for L's <i>ketubah</i> was a lien upon it, before it was rented to B. L may remove anyone from the house, whether buyer, renter, or creditor; provided, of course, that her marriage to A took place, and A was owner of the house, before he sold it, rented it, or borrowed money. Therefore, if A left no movables and his estate does not exceed L's <i>ketubah</i>, B can not reclaim his money. If, however, A left movables with a third person, these movables ought to be turned over to B in payment of the obligation due him, and any excess should go to L. Whenever a creditor and a widow press their claims to an estate consisting of movables — unless the movables had previously been set aside by the husband for the payment of his wife's <i>ketubah</i> — the creditor has priority over the widow. The creditor's priority, however, as against the widow extends only to the payment of the <i>Ikkar ketubah</i>, the additional jointure, and that part of the dowry which the husband wrote in the <i>ketubah</i> in excess of what she actually gave him as dowry — thus in our <i>ketubah</i> we uniformly write that the wife brought in a dowry worth fifty pounds, regardless of the actual value of her dowry, and in our country a woman collects one hundred <i>marks</i> as her dowry, since we interpret the term ""pound"" to be a pound of weight, consisting of two <i>marks</i>. In regard to whatever the widow actually brought in as dowry she is considered a creditor sharing equally with other creditors in collecting from movables. Although a woman is entitled to collect the entire amount her husband wrote in the dowry clause of her <i>ketubah</i> in excess of what she actually brought in, she does not have equal right with a creditor in collecting that excess. Therefore, since in collecting her actual dowry from movables, L is on an equal footing with B, the movables mentioned above must be equally divided between L and B (and not in proportion to the respective obligations). When an estate consists of movables and immovables, and the latter do not suffice to cover the <i>ketubah</i>, the widow collects the <i>Ikkar ketubah</i>, the additional jointure, and the excess dowry, from the immovables, while she takes her part of the movables in payment of her actual dowry. The creditor may not claim that the immovables taken by the widow are in payment of her actual dowry, while she may not collect the rest of the <i>ketubah</i> from the movables until he, the creditor, collects his full debt therefrom, for the <i>Ikkar ketubah</i> and the additional jointure are liens upon the immovables, while in regard to the actual dowry she is considered a creditor entitled to share with the other creditors in collecting from movables (cf. Ket. 86a)."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.345.1","<i>Q</i>. After L, a widow, remarried, she presented for collection the <i>ketubah</i> she had received from her first husband. In the absence of unencumbered property, L sought to collect her <i>ketubah</i> from a piece of the real estate which her former husband had sold to A. A, in turn, had sold the real estate to B; and after the latter's death, it fell to his orphans some of whom were minors. L contended that her husband had sold the real estate without her consent, and without obtaining her signature to the deed."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.345.2","<i>A</i>. If L will take an oath to the effect that she did not as yet collect any part of her <i>ketubah</i>, and that she did not consent to the sale of the above property, she will be entitled to evict B's heirs from it. The talmudic statement you quote in the query: ""after a widow remarries, the burden of proof lies on her shoulders (ket. 96b)"", does not apply to a case where the widow seeks to collect her <i>ketubah</i>. Moreover, the <i>ketubah</i>-document in itself constitutes adequate and sufficient proof of the fact that the widow did not collect her <i>ketubah</i>. The fact that B's heirs are able to prove three years of undisturbed possession, also has no bearing on the case. A widow is not required to protest the occupancy by another of real property which does not belong to her, but which she may eventually come to seize in payment of her <i>ketubah</i>."

We rendered a similar decision in Frankfort some time ago."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.352.1","1) <i>Q</i>. A owed one <i>minah</i> to B. He promised that he would repay the money on a specified date, or that his sureties, C and D, would either repay it themselves or would eat two meals a day to be charged to A. A made a binding promise to C and D, accompanied by a solemn hand-clasp, to compensate them for any losses they might suffer on account of their suretyship; and he gave them a written document to that effect. Before the debt fell due, however, A died leaving orphans and a widow, but not enough property to cover the latter's <i>ketubah</i>. B demands that the sureties either eat at the expense of A's estate, or pay him one <i>minah</i>. Who has priority in collecting from the estate, the creditor or the widow? Is this case similar to the case when interest is accumulating on the obligations of young orphans [in which case the court must attend immediately to the affairs of the estate in order to save the money of the orphans], or is it not similar to this case for the reason that in our case the orphans can receive no part of the estate in any event?"
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.352.2","<i>A</i>. Nowadays that a creditor may collect his debt from the movables of an estate, he has priority over the widow in collecting from movables. The orphans are not considered at all in this case, since they can receive no part of the estate in any event."

She said to A that she would give him a dowry of thirty <i>marks</i>, and would keep her remaining twenty <i>marks</i> for her children. The twenty <i>marks</i>, however, were not kept separately and they (A and L) did business with the entire sum. Subsequently A died, and L claimed that the greater part of the money he left belonged to her young children. Do we assume that since A did business with the money it belonged to him?"
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.352.4","<i>A</i>. If the money is in L's possession and we have no evidence (but her admission) that she possesses it, L must take an oath in support of her claim. We must be satisfied with this oath since she could have successfully denied possessing the money.

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.353.2","<i>A</i>. The widow has to produce evidence to the effect that the money represented by the notes and the bonds was actually her money. Furthermore, possession of notes and bonds, does not imply the right to the money and property described therein. Thus seizure of the notes and the bonds does not constitute seizure of the debts."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.354.2","<i>A</i>. In talmudic times a widow could collect her <i>ketubah</i> from real property only; therefore, it is stated in the Talmud that when a person dies, his debtors or depositaries shall repay their obligations to the person's heirs and not to his widow. But, the Geonim enacted a law that a woman may collect her <i>ketubah</i> from movable property and even from property her husband has given away to his heirs before his death. Nowadays, then, a woman may collect her <i>ketubah</i> from her husband's property in the hands of debtors and depositaries. Therefore, if the widow will swear that A did not leave her enough property to cover her <i>ketubah</i>, B must pay her the money he owed A. If B denies that he owes anything to A, he must take an oath to that effect and be free from obligation."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.355.2","<i>A</i>. A woman may collect her <i>ketubah</i> from all loans, even from loans that are not secured by pledges. Nowadays especially, since a woman may collect her <i>ketubah</i> from movables — and even after the loan is repaid to the orphans she may demand the money thus repaid in payment of her <i>ketubah</i> — she is entitled to collect directly from the debtor. Moreover, the custom of collecting the <i>ketubah</i> from movables and from loans, is well established in our time. Such a custom may be justified by the fact that the major part of our business consists of loans and investments. Similarly a first-born is entitled to a double share from a loan that had been secured by a pledge, since such a loan is not considered <i>raui</i> (a potential asset) but constitutes a real asset of the estate."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.359.2","<i>A</i>. A's funeral expenses must be defrayed with money taken from his estate, before his widow can collect her <i>ketubah</i> from it. Thus a person may not give away all his possessions to his heirs in the expectation that his funeral expenses would be paid from public funds (Ket. 48a); the same principle should apply when one gives away all his possessions to his wife. The claims of a creditor, however, should have priority over the decedent's funeral expenses, since the appropriation of a creditor's own money to pay another person's funeral expenses would constitute downright thievery. On the other hand, just as an exemption of bedding, food for thirty days, and clothing to last twelve months, is allowed to a bankrupt debtor (B. M. 113b), so an exemption of the bare funeral expenses should be allowed in the case of a decedent's insolvent estate as against both the creditor and the widow."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.360.1","<i>Q</i>. R. Eliezer bound himself by a <i>herem</i> to give his daughter Gutlin, a minor, in marriage to Miriam's son, Isaac Levi, also a minor; and Miriam also obligated herself by a <i>herem</i>. Both parents put up a trust fund of three pounds for the couple, on condition that in case one of the parties dies before marriage the parents should divide between themselves the principal and the accrued interest. R. Eliezer died, and subsequently, but before her marriage, his daughter also died. A young son by a former marriage, who is also motherless, and a widow survived him. The trustee of the orphan, appointed by the community, and the widow, both made claims to one half of the trust-fund money. To whom should it be given?"
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.360.2","It seems to me that the orphan is entitled to this money since it was not an actual asset at the time R. Eliezer died, and a widow collects her <i>ketubah</i> only from actual assets. The fact that the widow is in possession of the money, as the court gave it to her temporarily, does not make this asset any more actual as is evident from the case, quoted in the Talmud, of the woman with whom notes of indebtedness were deposited (Ket. 85a). Neither does the principle of <i>Miggo</i> apply to her since the money was given to her by the court and since the previous year she was obliged to make out a detailed statement of her assets, for the purpose of taxation and assessment for charity, in which statement the trust-money was listed. Signed: Moses Azriel."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.360.3","<i>A</i>. Since half of the fund which belonged to R. Eliezer was to be given to the couple on their wedding day and was to be returned to R.

Samson b. Abraham, and Maimonides, believe that the ruling applies to any amount seized by the widow, for the amount a widow may need for her sustenance is indeterminate. Therefore, the widow may retain the money she has seized for her sustenance. She need take no oath as to the amount seized, since such oath would serve no purpose. However, should she subsequently demand additional funds for her sustenance, she would have to take an oath as to the amount she seized and to the manner she used it.

The fact that two or three members of your community found it necessary to insert, in the <i>ketubot</i> they gave to their wives, the clause: ""after my death, should you desire to remain a widow the rest of your life you may take possession of all my property"" does not prove that your community has adopted the Judean custom. These individuals may have merely reiterated the accepted custom for the sake of emphasis. Moreover, this clause is not entirely superflous even in a community where the Galilean custom prevails; for it strengthens the widow's position inasmuch as it makes her master of the estate, while according to the Galilean custom she is only to receive thirty-day allowances at a time. Neither does the fact that some widows in your community have been ousted from their husbands' estates by being paid their <i>ketubah</i>, prove that you have adopted the Judean custom.

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.376.2","<i>A</i>. Leah only expressed her feelings. The Rabbis of Speier do not carry out her orders; she is, therefore, not responsible for their actions."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.377.1","<i>Q</i>. A, who fell sick, gave a bill of divorce to his wife on the condition that it be valid from the time of its delivery if he should die as a result of that sickness. A died as a result of that sickness and the people did not allow his wife to touch him, weep over him, or even walk after his hearse, claiming that such action on her part would invalidate her divorce."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.377.2",<i>A</i>. The people were wrong. It is not within the province of a wife to invalidate her divorce.

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.378.1","<i>Q</i>. While critically ill, A gave a bill of divorcement to his wife on condition that should he die from this illness, she should be divorced therewith from the day she receives the divorce. After the bill of divorcement was thus delivered to A's wife, it was torn up. Subsequently A's condition improved; he got up from bed, walked to the synagogue and to the market place without a cane, and even arranged his mother's funeral out of town. Twenty-eight days thereafter, however, he fell ill again and died. During these twenty-eight days he was at times lying in bed, and at other times he was upon his feet. Was the bill of divorcement effective?"
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.378.2","<i>A</i>. The bill of divorcement was ineffective. First, according to R. Tam and Ri the stipulated condition mentioned above, is to be interpreted to mean that A intended the divorce to become effective an hour before his death. Since on the day of A's death the bill of divorcement was already torn up, no divorce took place. A similar query was sent to me from Acco (Aachen?) and I ruled that no divorce took place. I always advise women who receive such conditional divorces to guard their bills of divorcement carefully till their husbands die. Secondly, even according to Rashi, who believes that the divorce becomes effective immediately upon the delivery of the bill of divorcement, if the husband subsequently dies from his illness, the fact that A was walking thereafter without the support of a cane nullified the bill of divorcement. In any event the advice of a medical authority would be required in order to decide whether or not A died from his first illness; and nowadays we have no medical authorities on whose expert opinion we can definitely rely in such a vital matter."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.378.3","R. Meir adds: I do not possess the <i>Tosaphot</i> to tractate <i>Gittin</i>, nor the code books from the south (Alfasi and Maimonides). I composed the above with the help of heavenly guide; if you find that the <i>Tosaphot</i> and the codes hold another opinion, my opinion is nullified by theirs; for what does a poor man know, one who dwells in darkness and gloom for three and one half years."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.378.4",This responsum was sent to Rabbi Asher from the tower of Ensisheim and was placed in his (R. Meir's) novellae in his own handwriting.

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.379.1","<i>Q</i>. Rabbenu Tam interprets the talmudic statement: ""this is thy letter of divorce, effective as of today; if I shall die … the divorce is valid"" (Git. 72a), to mean that such divorce becomes effective one hour before the man's death. According to Rabbenu Tam, therefore, what would be the status of the woman who received a letter of divorce from her husband with the provision: ""this is thy letter of divorce effective as of today, if I shall not return within the next twelve months"", if this letter of divorce was lost or burned within the twelve months, and her husband did not return?"
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.379.2","<i>A</i>. You have done well to distinguish between the above two cases. Although in the former case, when the divorce is given by a critically ill person in order that his wife be not forced to accept <i>halitzah</i>, the phrase ""effective as of today"" is taken to mean one hour before the man's death, in the latter case the phrase ""effective as of today"" is to be taken literally."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.380.1","<i>Q</i>. A minor orphan girl was betrothed to A. She wants to exercise the right of ""Refusal"" (<span dir=""rtl"">סירוב</span>). May the testimony of female witnesses be accepted that the girl is only eleven years old and, therefore, may still exercise the right of ""Refusal""?"
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.380.2","<i>A</i>. The mere ceremony of betrothal, without cohabitation, is binding only because of Rabbinic enactment, but is not binding according to Biblical law. The testimony of women is acceptable in the annulment of a marriage that is valid only according to Rabbinic enactment. Therefore, since A did not cohabit with the orphan, the testimony of the female witnesses is to be admitted in evidence."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.382.1","<i>Q</i>. Before his death, A bequeathed sixty pounds <i>Heller</i> (denarii of Halle) to his brothers and sisters. His childless widow, however, retains all of A's property and refuses either to marry, or to take <i>halitzah</i> from her levir."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.382.2","After protracted litigation, the widow (of Speyer) and her levirs finally came to court and chose their judges. These judges asked the opinion of R. Meir who put them off and advised them to ask the great (Jewish) leaders of the Kingdom (Germany) regarding the ordinances passed by the communities affecting the relations of a widow and her levirs. The leaders all agreed that after the rite of <i>halitzah</i> is performed, one half of the husband's estate belongs to the widow and one half to the levirs. R. Meir states that he knows no further details regarding these laws of the communities, and renders the following decision in accordance with talmudic law:"
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.382.3","<i>A</i>. If A's widow, three months after his death refuses to undergo the rite of <i>halitzah</i> or marry her levir, she is to be considered as a rebellious wife and all of A's property is to be taken away from her, except that which she has brought in as a dowry, upon her marriage to A. If, however, she consents to undergo the rite of <i>halitzah</i>, she receives half of A's property, as is the <i>Takkanah</i> of the communities. From this amount is deducted the sum she admits, under oath, to have wasted, lost, and given away as presents, while A was alive and after his death."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.383.1","<i>Q</i>. A refuses to marry or give <i>halitzah</i> to his brother's childless widow claiming that, because a year has not yet passed since his brother's death, his deep sorrow prevents him from either marrying her or giving her <i>halitzah</i>."
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.383.2","<i>A</i>. A's temporizing is baseless and useless. Our sages have decreed that three months, and not a year or two, after a person died leaving no children, his brother must either marry the widow or give her <i>halitzah</i>. Therefore, no temporizing is permitted. A should be coerced, either by persuasion or by flagellation, into giving <i>halitzah</i> to the woman immediately. Let Gentiles belabor him till he agrees to do what he is told to do. I should prefer, however, that A be misled or deceived by offers of money till he voluntarily gives her <i>halitzah</i>. Thus the widow may officially forego her claim to her husband's money that is in A's possession, and even bind herself thereto by a <i>kinyan</i>. After the ceremony the widow would still be entitled to collect this money from A, for the court that has a right to inflict corporal punishment on A, has a right to confiscate his property if it be required by considerations of public welfare. I should prefer to practice deception on A rather than inflict flagellation, since the latter might involve great hardship, have very serious consequences, and even cause A to abscond."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.384.1","<i>Q</i>. A believed that his brother's (childless) widow had retained from her husband's estate more than the amount due her for her <i>ketubah</i>, and he refused to go through with the ceremony of <i>halitzah</i>, unless she paid him some money. They finally agreed on the sum of 20<xref rid=""fn12"">*</xref> <i>marks</i>. Before the ceremony of <i>halitzah</i> she gave the money to a trustee in A's presence. A said to the trustee: ""After the ceremony, you must give me the 20<xref rid=""fn12"">*</xref> <i>marks</i>"". To this, the trustee replied, ""I shall."" After the ceremony, the widow produced her <i>ketubah</i>, swore that she had not received enough to cover same, and demanded the 20<xref rid=""fn12"">*</xref> <i>marks</i> back. The court decided that the 20<xref rid=""fn12"">*</xref> <i>marks</i> belong to the widow. Is the decision of the court correct?"
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.384.2","<i>A</i>. The question is not sufficiently clear for us to express an opinion. If the widow told the trustee, in A's presence, to give the money to A after the ceremony, the money belongs to A; since this money is simply a gift which the trustee received for A's benefit. But, if the widow said nothing while she gave the money to the trustee, A's words are of no avail, and she can reclaim her money in payment of her <i>ketubah</i>."

"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.386.1","<i>Q</i>. A levir performed the rite of <i>halitzah</i> with a shoe sewed with flaxen thread, but which did not belong to him. The levir refuses to repeat the rite with another shoe. The law provides that <i>halitzah</i> performed with a shoe not belonging to the levir is valid <i>bediabad</i> (after the act has been performed). What does <i>bediabad</i> mean in this case; does it mean after the rite was performed, or only after the woman remarried?"
"Meir, Iii Eben Haezer.386.2","<i>A. Bediabad</i>, in this case, means after the rite was performed. Nevertheless, the aforementioned performance of the rite is invalid, for a different reason: the shoe used was sewed with flaxen thread and, therefore, was never fit for this purpose. Since, however, the levir performed an invalid rite of <i>halitzah</i>, neither he nor his brothers are now permitted to marry the widow. <i>Halitzah</i> by the same levir being the only manner of releasing her, he may be forced, by persuasion or by flagellation, to repeat the rite with the proper shoe. For now the <i>Mitzvah</i> revolved on him alone, and we are permitted to scourge a Jew until he perform the required <i>Mitzvot</i>."
