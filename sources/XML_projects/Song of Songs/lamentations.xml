<h1><bold>Introduction</bold></h1>
<p>When speaking about the Kabbalistic interpretation of Scripture and its place within the fourfold Jewish understanding of Scripture in the Middle Ages, the logical starting point would seem to be that of Kabbalistic notions of Scripture and the art of its interpretation. But sometimes neither reality nor pedagogy conforms to our standard notions of logic&#x2014;particularly the case when dealing with mystical matters. In the world of Kabbalah we often have to commence with <italic>aggadah</italic> and its rereading of Scripture rather than with the Bible itself. Medieval Judaism, in all its forms, is a rabbinic religion. This means not only that the Biblical text is authoritative but also that the text as understood by the rabbis of the Talmudic period is the authoritative reading of Scripture. This authority of text-as-received through the rabbinic filter is most applicable to the realm of <italic>halakhah</italic> or religious praxis, but has some validity in the parallel realm of <italic>aggadah</italic> or theological narrative as well.</p>
<p>Of course medieval Jewish exegetes have rediscovered the <italic>peshat</italic>, simple or literal reading of Scripture. Influenced by the Arab grammarians and new trends in Qur&#x2019;an exegesis, Hebrew scholars from the tenth century began to set aside the rabbinic readings in order to dig out what they thought were the original meanings of Biblical texts. Even so deeply rabbinic a writer as RaSHI (Rabbi Solomon Itshaki (1040&#x2013;1105), the best-known Jewish commentator, could sidestep rabbinic tradition with such a phrase as: &#x201C;but I seek nought but the plain meaning of Scripture.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the rabbinic readings (in the plural, to be sure, since midrashic exegesis is by nature polysemous) retained great currency, and the medieval Jewish imagination was often constructed around them. This is especially true for Kabbalah, a tradition deeply formed by and engaged in fervent dialogue with the values, symbols and concepts of the rabbinic tradition. The great classic of Kabbalah, the Zohar, is a pseudoepigraphic midrash purporting to be the words of second century sages. When Kabbalists move from the open exegesis of authentic rabbinic sources to the creation of their own midrashic hermeneutics, they see themselves as literally reopening the wells of aggadic creativity and reanimating the process of Oral Torah.</p>
<p>The enormous devotion to Oral Torah in Kabbalistic circles is in part due to the fact that Oral Torah is identified with &#x201C;Our Lady the <italic>shekhinah</italic>,&#x201D; the feminine component of divinity toward whom the Kabbalists saw themselves as having a special devotion. But it is also due to the fact that Kabbalah really reflects a rebirth of the aggadic process. There is much in the Zohar that follows directly in the rabbinic line of Scriptural readings, comprehensible even without reference to the sefirotic grid of symbols that makes for Kabbalah itself. The world of the Zohar is an attempt to re-create the world of the Tannaim. This includes the narrative portions of the text, recounting alleged wanderings of the early rabbis and referring to (mostly fictional and often newly invented) events in their lives. But it is true of the homiletical sections as well: every page is woven out of allusions to and dialogue with the Talmudic tradition, not as hoary and ancient source but rather as a living, contemporary reality and conversation partner. There are no borders between the midrashic page and the Zoharic dialogue. There is an intertextual conversation here that we are only beginning to chart, but one that has a unique complexity: the Kabbalist encounters Scripture through the veil of a rabbinic reading that he seeks to become a part of and revivify, while also uncovering within both prior corpuses those elements that will become the foundations of his own new enrichment of the discourse in the form of properly Kabbalistic exegesis.</p>
<p>The medievals&#x2019; dialogue with the Rabbis is not always an easy one. Among the philosophical exegetes we are familiar with great discomfort with elements of <italic>aggadah</italic> and its readings of the Bible. Some of this discomfort was apologetic in nature: both Christian and Karaite writers had long mocked the rabbis&#x2019; fanciful readings of shared Scriptures. But philosophically sophisticated readers were also undoubtedly genuinely disturbed by some of the extremes of rabbinic anthropomorphism, to say nothing of such &#x201C;shocking&#x201D; quasi-rabbinic traditions as merkavah mysticism and especially <italic>shi&#x2018;ur komah</italic>. This was significantly less true for the Kabbalists than for their philosophic rivals. Kabbalists share far more with the rabbis than the philosophers do; they are more comfortable with much of the conceptual world and idiom of rabbinic discourse, including the rabbinic world&#x2019;s highly personal and even anthropomorphic sense of the divine, its mythic worldview, and its delight in the miraculous. Although Kabbalah itself may be seen as a systematic theosophy and cosmology, the Zohar mostly sets aside presentation of this grand system, accepting the typically Jewish and rabbinic valorization of narrative over analytical theological discourse.</p>
<p>But there remain moments when the encounter with the rabbis is not an easy one, when rabbinic texts can disturb and even appall the Kabbalists. Sometimes they find that they cannot accept a particular trajectory within the rabbinic tradition. Then they devote their considerable literary and theological skills in part to deflect it, hoping to find a solution to a burning theological problem when a rabbinic response seems to be absolutely unnerving. Sometimes classical Jewish theology, rooted in Scripture as understood exoterically, paints the Sages into a corner and thus requires radical reformulation; here the new Kabbalistic readings may be brought in <italic>against</italic> the rabbis, a counter-tradition purporting to uncover a deeper meaning of Scripture that can help us out of the bind created by earlier readings.</p>
<p>This is very much the case regarding the issue of theodicy, one of the core concerns of the Kabbalistic tradition, the key subject of the text before us. This section of the Zohar needs to be read in the context of a comparative analysis of midrashic and Zoharic responses to the Book of Lamentations, reflecting the two great tragedies of 586 <small>BCE</small>. and 70 <small>CE.</small>, already quite homologized into one by the rabbinic sources. Here we see a zoharic text as much engaged in polemic as it is in dialogue. Hopefully an understanding of this will take us beyond the text at hand, serving as a window into the incredible complexity of the world created by the zoharic imagination.</p>
<p>A much later Kabbalist, R. Solomon Shlomiel of Dresnitz, a keen-eyed participant/observer of the Safed revival of Kabbalah in the sixteenth century, recounts a story about R. Abraham b. Eliezer ha-Levi Berukhim (ca. 1515&#x2013;93), who had a vision of the <italic>shekhinah</italic> as Mother Rachel or Mother Zion, draped in black and in mourning for Zion, projected upon the Western Wall. The fact that he sees her at that holy place is in harmony with the words of R. Aha: &#x201C;Never has the <italic>shekhinah</italic> departed from the Western Wall of the Temple: as it is written: &#x2018;Here she stands behind our latticework&#x2019; [Cant. 2:9].&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn209">209</xref></sup> But it is most unlikely that R. Aha would have called an apparition in feminine form by the term <italic>shekhinah</italic>. The association of <italic>shekhinah</italic>, the indwelling presence of God in the world, with the feminine images of Community of Israel, Mother Zion, and so forth, is specifically a Kabbalistic innovation.</p>
<p>R. Abraham&#x2019;s vision is a powerful expression of the exegetical construction of reality depicted in the zoharic accounts of the <italic>shekhinah</italic>&#x2019;s midnight lament that we have before us. This zoharic text is completely rooted in one set of tradents in rabbinic theodic texts&#x2014;the image of the weeping and lamenting God&#x2014;but also strikes me as an attempt to defuse the anger permeating certain strata of Lamentations Rabbah. That anger is directed towards a notion of the divine and divine justice which the Sages themselves find abusive, and against which they are in rebellion. The fierce outcry against divine injustice is a key component of the Lamentations Rabbah tradition, and one that carries over into later Jewish attitudes, reflected so strongly, for example, in the poignant elegies written in response to the First Crusade. By picking up on a different strand of rabbinic tradition, the Zohar is attempting to carry forth an alternative conception of divine justice, one founded upon the notion of divine exile and suffering. The powerful descriptions in the following passage of <italic>shekhinah</italic>&#x2019;s mourning should be read as an attempt to restore credibility to the notion of divine goodness and compassion&#x2014;and thus to provide Israel hope for its future.</p>
<p>This passage is a section from the work entitled <italic>Zohar &#x1E24;adash</italic> by the Kabbalists who collected it for the edition of Salonika, 1597. <italic>Zohar &#x1E24;adash</italic> is a collection of sources, mostly by the author(s) of the original Zohar, that had been left out of the earlier (1558&#x2013;60) Zohar editions. Despite its later appearance, this introduction and commentary on the opening verse of Lamentations is considered by scholars to belong to the <italic>Midrash ha-Ne&#x2018;elam</italic> (&#x201C;Hidden Midrash&#x201D;) stratum of the Zohar.</p>

<h1><bold>The Hidden Midrash to the Book of Lamentations</bold></h1>
<p>I. The inhabitants of Babylon sent this missive to the inhabitants of the Holy Land:</p>
<p align="blockquote">Weeping befits us,</p>
<p align="blockquote">Eulogizing becomes us,</p>
<p align="blockquote">for the destruction of God&#x2019;s house,</p>
<p align="blockquote">since we are dispersed amongst the nations.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Thus, we should be the first to lament,</p>
<p align="blockquote">we should be the first</p>
<p align="blockquote">to explicate the puzzle</p>
<p align="blockquote">which the World&#x2019;s Master has sent</p>
<p align="blockquote">to bewail the destruction of His House.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the Holy Land responded, sending this missive to the Babylonians:</p>
<p align="blockquote">It is surely right for you</p>
<p align="blockquote">dispersed among the nations,</p>
<p align="blockquote">outside the borders of the Holy Land,</p>
<p align="blockquote">to bewail yourselves.</p>
<p align="blockquote">For you have gone forth</p>
<p align="blockquote">from light to darkness,</p>
<p align="blockquote">like a servant who has departed from his master&#x2019;s house.</p>
<p align="blockquote">But it is we who should weep,</p>
<p align="blockquote">we who should eulogize,</p>
<p align="blockquote">for the Blessed Holy One has sent us</p>
<p align="blockquote">the Book of Lamentations.</p>
<p align="blockquote">It is we who are the children</p>
<p align="blockquote">of the Mistress divine;</p>
<p align="blockquote">we the members of her household,</p>
<p align="blockquote">who know the glory of World&#x2019;s Master.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Thus weeping befits us,</p>
<p align="blockquote">and it is we</p>
<p align="blockquote">who should explicate this puzzle.</p>
<p align="blockquote">For we are orphans,</p>
<p align="blockquote">lacking father and mother.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Our eyes gaze towards the walls</p>
<p align="blockquote">of our Mother&#x2019;s house</p>
<p align="blockquote">which is destroyed</p>
<p align="blockquote">and we are incapable</p>
<p align="blockquote">of finding her.</p>
<p align="blockquote">In former days</p>
<p align="blockquote">she nursed us</p>
<p align="blockquote">from the radiance of her beauty,</p>
<p align="blockquote">she comforted us</p>
<p align="blockquote">and spoke to our hearts,</p>
<p align="blockquote">like a mother to her child.</p>
<p align="blockquote">As it is written:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;As a mother comforts her son &#x2026;&#x201D; [Isa. 66:13].</p>
<p align="blockquote">Now our eyes gaze in all directions,</p>
<p align="blockquote">and the place of our mother&#x2019;s house</p>
<p align="blockquote">is overturned and destroyed.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Stomped to their foundations</p>
<p align="blockquote">are the walls of her house and dwelling place.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Who then will comfort us?</p>
<p align="blockquote">Who then will speak to our hearts</p>
<p align="blockquote">and protect us before the King?</p>
<p align="blockquote">When we had sinned against our father,</p>
<p align="blockquote">and the strap thrashed out to whip us,</p>
<p align="blockquote">she stood before us</p>
<p align="blockquote">and received the King&#x2019;s lashing,</p>
<p align="blockquote">defending us.</p>
<p align="blockquote">As it is written:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;He was wounded on account of our sins,</p>
<p align="blockquote">crushed because of our iniquities &#x2026;</p>
<p align="blockquote">by his bruises we were healed&#x201D; [Isa. 53:5].</p>
<p align="blockquote">Alas, now we no longer have a mother.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Woe for us&#x0021;</p>
<p align="blockquote">Woe for you&#x0021;</p>
<p align="blockquote">Weeping becomes us&#x0021;</p>
<p align="blockquote">Lamentation befits us&#x0021;</p>
<p align="blockquote">It is our place to explicate</p>
<p align="blockquote">those words of bitter grief</p>
<p align="blockquote">to teach those who know how to wail</p>
<p align="blockquote">the language of lamentation.</p>
<p align="blockquote">For every day we approach</p>
<p align="blockquote">the bedchamber of our mother</p>
<p align="blockquote">but find her not.</p>
<p align="blockquote">We inquire for her</p>
<p align="blockquote">but none pay us heed.</p>
<p align="blockquote">We inquire of her bed&#x2014;</p>
<p align="blockquote">it is overturned.</p>
<p align="blockquote">We ask of the throne&#x2014;</p>
<p align="blockquote">it is fallen.</p>
<p align="blockquote">We ask her chambers.</p>
<p align="blockquote">These state that they know</p>
<p align="blockquote">nothing of her.</p>
<p align="blockquote">We ask of the dust.</p>
<p align="blockquote">The imprint of her foot is not found there.</p>
<p align="blockquote">We inquire of the Temple roof.</p>
<p align="blockquote">The roof answers us</p>
<p align="blockquote">that she stood upon it,</p>
<p align="blockquote">crying and keening.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Departing,</p>
<p align="blockquote">she cried for us,</p>
<p align="blockquote">voice embittered,</p>
<p align="blockquote">moving from rooftop</p>
<p align="blockquote">to rooftop.</p>
<p align="blockquote">As it says:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;What can have happened to you</p>
<p align="blockquote">That you have gone, all of you, up on the roof &#x2026;&#x201D; [Isa.22:1].</p>
<p align="blockquote">We inquire of the roadways and boulevards.</p>
<p align="blockquote">All of them declare</p>
<p align="blockquote">that they heard an embittered cry,</p>
<p align="blockquote">bewailing her children.</p>
<p align="blockquote">But they know not</p>
<p align="blockquote">whereto she ascended.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Wailing befits us.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Lamentation becomes us.</p>
<p align="blockquote">We will kiss the dust of her feet.</p>
<p align="blockquote">We will kiss her dwelling-place,</p>
<p align="blockquote">we will kiss her chamber&#x2019;s walls</p>
<p align="blockquote">and we will wail bitterly.</p>
<p align="blockquote">We will commence the lamentation</p>
<p align="blockquote">for every day we view this destruction.</p>
<p align="blockquote">With constancy shall we keen.</p>
<p align="blockquote">The bitterness of weeping will not</p>
<p align="blockquote">cease among us.</p>
<p>They commenced their discourse and said:</p>
<p align="blockquote">Alas&#x0021;</p>
<p align="blockquote">Lonely sits the city</p>
<p align="blockquote">Once great with people&#x0021; [Lam. 1:1].</p>
<p align="blockquote">It is written:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;a day of tumult and din and confusion&#x2014;</p>
<p align="blockquote">like the crowing of Kir, and Sho &#x2018;a at the mount&#x201D; [Isa. 22:5].</p>
<p align="blockquote">The blessed Holy One possesses one day,</p>
<p align="blockquote">the beloved of His soul,</p>
<p align="blockquote">encompassing all of the other days.</p>
<p align="blockquote">The six other days are enveloped within it.</p>
<p align="blockquote">It is the sum of them all.</p>
<p align="blockquote">But when sinfulness abounds within the world,</p>
<p align="blockquote">it ascends above,</p>
<p align="blockquote">to the place of World of Life.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Then, from under the trains of the Sanctuary,</p>
<p align="blockquote">a day of bitterness arises,</p>
<p align="blockquote">a day of wailing,</p>
<p align="blockquote">a day of suffering,</p>
<p align="blockquote">named &#x201C;tumult, din and confusion.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote">It enters the Sanctuary,</p>
<p align="blockquote">destroys and defiles.</p>
<p align="blockquote">The Master of the Sanctuary</p>
<p align="blockquote">departs, leaves,</p>
<p align="blockquote">is driven out of His dwelling,</p>
<p align="blockquote">out to the mountain beyond,</p>
<p align="blockquote">into the mount of destruction.</p>
<p align="blockquote">The Sanctuary is defiled and destroyed.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Afterwards,</p>
<p align="blockquote">that supernal day which had ascended,</p>
<p align="blockquote">alights</p>
<p align="blockquote">and inquires after its dwelling place.</p>
<p align="blockquote">He finds it destroyed.</p>
<p align="blockquote">He enters and looks for</p>
<p align="blockquote">the Sanctuary&#x2019;s masters,</p>
<p align="blockquote">the Lady his soul&#x2019;s beloved.</p>
<p align="blockquote">She is banished, expelled.</p>
<p align="blockquote">The entire edifice</p>
<p align="blockquote">is overturned.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Then he begins to low,</p>
<p align="blockquote">bellow after bellow,</p>
<p align="blockquote">like a cock for its mate.</p>
<p align="blockquote">It is so written:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;like the crowing of Kir, and Sho &#x2018;a at the mount&#x201D; [Isa. 22:5].</p>

<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;Sho &#x2018;a at the mount&#x201D;:</p>
<p align="blockquote">He cries for help [<italic>shav&#x2018;ah</italic>]</p>
<p align="blockquote">and calls out towards that mountain</p>
<p align="blockquote">to which the divine Lady had departed.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Crying he calls out:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;Alas&#x0021;</p>
<p align="blockquote">Woe is my soul&#x2019;s beloved&#x0021;</p>
<p align="blockquote">Woe is my pearl,</p>
<p align="blockquote">my perfect one.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Woe is my only love,</p>
<p align="blockquote">secreted with me in unity.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Woe is she</p>
<p align="blockquote">who daily absorbed</p>
<p align="blockquote">the twenty-five letters of unity</p>
<p align="blockquote">and was named &#x2018;Koh,&#x2019; [twenty-five]</p>

<p align="blockquote">Mother&#x0021;</p>
<p align="blockquote">Where have you gone?</p>
<p align="blockquote">In what direction have you departed?</p>
<p align="blockquote">We daily hear this, our master&#x2019;s lowing.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Is it not fitting that we cry?</p>
<p align="blockquote">Is it not proper that we lament?</p>
<p align="blockquote">Is it not right that we open our discourse with <italic>Aikhah</italic>&#x2014;</p>

<p align="blockquote">the <italic>shekhinah</italic> settled with the cherubim below,</p>
<p align="blockquote">and was separated from the supernal Glory.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Then that flaming sword was set in his place of dominion,</p>
<p align="blockquote">to guard and hide that path</p>
<p align="blockquote">which proceeds from the tree of life.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Concerning this Solomon the King cried out and said:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2018;The earth shudders at three things</p>
<p align="blockquote">At four which it cannot bear:</p>
<p align="blockquote">A slave who becomes king &#x2026;</p>
<p align="blockquote">A slave-girl who supplants her mistress&#x2019; [Prov. 30:21].</p>
<p align="blockquote">The slave-girl within,</p>
<p align="blockquote">the mistress without.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;Alas&#x0021;</p>
<p align="blockquote">Lonely sits the city&#x2026;.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote">What is the meaning of the word &#x201C;lonely&#x201D;?</p>
<p align="blockquote">The verse states, &#x201C;She sits alone&#x201D;:</p>
<p align="blockquote">outside of the camp, her proper dwelling site.</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;Alas&#x0021;</p>
<p align="blockquote">Lonely sits the city&#x2026;.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote">R. Haninai and the Sages applied this verse to the first human.</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;&#x2018;The Lord God took the man</p>
<p align="blockquote">and placed him in the Garden of Eden&#x2019; [Gen. 2:15].</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2018;The Lord God took him&#x2026;&#x2019;:</p>
<p align="blockquote">How did he take him?&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote">R. Haninai says:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;He persuaded him, enticed him with words.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote">As it says:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;Take Aaron along with his sons&#x2026;.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote">The Sages said:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;He took him with the wind. As it says:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2018;When the Lord was about to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind,</p>
<p align="blockquote">Elijah and Elisha had set out from Gilgal&#x2026;. Disciples of the</p>
<p align="blockquote">prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and said to him, &#x201C;Do you</p>
<p align="blockquote">know that the Lord will take your master away from you today?&#x201D;&#x2019; [II Kings 2:1&#x2013;3].&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;And He placed him in the Garden of Eden&#x201D;:</p>
<p align="blockquote">This would provide him with the leisure</p>
<p align="blockquote">requisite to know and cognize wisdom and Torah.</p>
<p align="blockquote">As R. Haninai says:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;The Blessed Holy One taught Adam the Torah.</p>
<p align="blockquote">As it says:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2018;Whence does Wisdom come&#x2026; ?</p>
<p align="blockquote">God understands the way to it&#x2026;.</p>
<p align="blockquote">He saw it and gauged it;</p>
<p align="blockquote">He measured it and probed it.</p>
<p align="blockquote">He said to man:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;See&#x0021; Fear of the Lord is wisdom,</p>
<p align="blockquote">To shun evil is understanding&#x201D; [Job 28:20&#x2013;28].&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote">The angels of service praised Adam</p>
<p align="blockquote">until Samael saw him from the heavens</p>
<p align="blockquote">and grew jealous of him.</p>
<p align="blockquote">He descended from the heavens</p>
<p align="blockquote">in the form of a shadow surmounted by a serpent.</p>
<p align="blockquote">The serpent was visible;</p>
<p align="blockquote">the shadow was its source of power and vigor.</p>
<p align="blockquote">That serpent drew near the woman</p>
<p align="blockquote">whose intelligence was weaker than the man&#x2019;s.</p>
<p align="blockquote">From here we learn that a woman is seduced</p>
<p align="blockquote">only through another woman.</p>
<p align="blockquote">The serpent began: &#x201C;Did God really [<italic>af</italic>] say:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2018;You shall not eat of any tree of the garden&#x2019;?&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote">He began his discourse immediately with the word <italic>really</italic> [<italic>af</italic>].</p>
<p align="blockquote">From here one learns that one can recognize</p>
<p align="blockquote">the character of an individual</p>
<p align="blockquote">from the opening words of their conversation.</p>
<p align="blockquote">So the serpent began with <italic>af</italic>,</p>
<p align="blockquote">revealing who he truly was.<sup><xref rid="fn213">213</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote">Take hold of this sign whether or not you accept it.</p>
<p align="blockquote">He enticed her with his blandishments</p>
<p align="blockquote">until she responded with a sentence beginning with the letter M:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;We are permitted to eat from all of the garden&#x2019;s trees&#x201D; [<italic>Mikol etz ha-gan akhol nokhal</italic>; Gen. 3:2].</p>
<p align="blockquote">The serpent immediately took that letter</p>
<p align="blockquote">and affixed it to his left arm,</p>
<p align="blockquote">waiting until the letters <italic>vav</italic> [<span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;</span>] and <italic>tav</italic> [<span dir="rtl">&#x05EA;</span>]</p>
<p align="blockquote">exited from her mouth,</p>
<p align="blockquote">so that death [<italic>mavet</italic>] might be prepared for them.</p>
<p align="blockquote">He began to entice her with his words</p>
<p align="blockquote">until the narrative arrives at the words</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;the woman saw that the tree was good for eating&#x201D; [<italic>va-teire ha-ishah</italic>; Gen. 3:6].</p>
<p align="blockquote">The cantillation mark accompanying this phrase</p>
<p align="blockquote">registers that the note</p>

<p align="blockquote">This informs us</p>
<p align="blockquote">that the letters <italic>vav</italic> and <italic>tav</italic> [in <italic>va-teire</italic>]</p>
<p align="blockquote">flew out from her lips and ascended</p>
<p align="blockquote">to conjoin with the letter <italic>mem</italic>.</p>
<p align="blockquote">But the letter <italic>mem</italic> ascended and descended</p>
<p align="blockquote">and did not conjoin with those letters</p>
<p align="blockquote">until she was seduced</p>
<p align="blockquote">and enunciated the letters <italic>vav</italic> and <italic>tav</italic></p>
<p align="blockquote">four times.</p>
<p align="blockquote">They then conjoined with the letter <italic>mem</italic></p>
<p align="blockquote">in all four directions.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Thus it is written:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;She took of its fruit and ate. She gave some to her husband &#x2026;</p>
<p align="blockquote">and the eyes of both of them were opened&#x201D; [Gen. 3:6].</p>

<p align="blockquote">The letters <italic>vav</italic> and <italic>tav</italic> appear four times.</p>
<p align="blockquote">This reveals that they surrounded the letter <italic>mem</italic></p>
<p align="blockquote">on all four sides, the mem standing at their center,</p>

<p align="blockquote">As it says:</p>

<p align="blockquote">This is Samael who is one of the windows of heaven.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Concerning this Scripture states:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;What man can live and not see death,</p>
<p align="blockquote">can save himself from the clutches of Sheol?&#x201D; [Ps. 89:49].</p>
<p align="blockquote">Samael immediately dominated Eve</p>
<p align="blockquote">and cast his filth upon her.</p>
<p align="blockquote">The Blessed Holy One descended to see</p>

<p align="blockquote">Come and see.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Before they sinned,</p>

<p align="blockquote">When they sinned,</p>
<p align="blockquote">if such were possible,</p>
<p align="blockquote">her power was diminished</p>
<p align="blockquote">and she departed, no longer ruling the world.</p>
<p align="blockquote">The Blessed Holy One</p>
<p align="blockquote">began to keen and say:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;Alas&#x0021;</p>

<p align="blockquote">Dominion has departed her.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote">Similarly,</p>
<p align="blockquote">when the Temple was destroyed,</p>
<p align="blockquote">divine sovereignty departed,</p>
<p align="blockquote">and the Blessed Holy One</p>
<p align="blockquote">began to lament and say:</p>

<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;Alas&#x0021;&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote">R. Pinhas opened his discourse [with Jer. 31:15]:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;&#x2018;A cry is heard in Ramah,</p>
<p align="blockquote">wailing, bitter weeping,</p>
<p align="blockquote">Rachel weeping for her children.</p>
<p align="blockquote">She refuses to be comforted</p>
<p align="blockquote">For her children who are gone.&#x2019;</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;When the Temple was destroyed and set ablaze,</p>
<p align="blockquote">a voice went and aroused itself</p>
<p align="blockquote">over the graves of the primordial fathers.</p>
<p align="blockquote">It said:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2018;Primordial fathers,</p>
<p align="blockquote">you are slumbering in your sleep</p>
<p align="blockquote">and are unaware of the world&#x2019;s suffering.</p>
<p align="blockquote">The children whom you raised with great labor,</p>
<p align="blockquote">and brought up with great faith in God,</p>
<p align="blockquote">die and are slaughtered.</p>
<p align="blockquote">They go forth into exile among their enemies</p>
<p align="blockquote">their hands tied behind their backs,</p>
<p align="blockquote">perishing from starvation,</p>
<p align="blockquote">their houses put to flame.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Where is your compassion?&#x0021;</p>
<p align="blockquote">Where is your faith?&#x0021;</p>
<p align="blockquote">Come, arouse yourselves for their sakes&#x0021;&#x2019;</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;The fathers and mothers woke immediately.</p>
<p align="blockquote">The went before Moses,</p>
<p align="blockquote">saying to him:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2018;Moses, faithful shepherd&#x0021;</p>
<p align="blockquote">Where are those children?</p>
<p align="blockquote">Where did you leave them?&#x2019;</p>
<p align="blockquote">Moses aroused himself immediately</p>
<p align="blockquote">and in their company went to Joshua.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Moses said to him:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2018;The children of these fathers</p>
<p align="blockquote">the children of Israel</p>
<p align="blockquote">whose charge God gave me,</p>
<p align="blockquote">whom I left in your hand&#x2014;</p>
<p align="blockquote">Where are they?&#x2019;</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;Joshua answered, saying:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2018;Our Master Moses.</p>
<p align="blockquote">I left them in the holy land.</p>
<p align="blockquote">I left them, dividing the land for them</p>
<p align="blockquote">in accord with a lottery as you commanded me.</p>
<p align="blockquote">I left all of them,</p>
<p align="blockquote">each in accord with his inheritance and lot.&#x2019;</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;Immediately, all of them journeyed to the holy land.</p>
<p align="blockquote">They found it destroyed,</p>
<p align="blockquote">bereft of human voice.</p>
<p align="blockquote">They entered the Sanctuary</p>
<p align="blockquote">and found it consumed by flame.</p>
<p align="blockquote">They lamented,</p>
<p align="blockquote">producing a sound of bitter weeping</p>
<p align="blockquote">so strong that it reached the heights of heaven</p>
<p align="blockquote">and all of the celestial angels weeped with them</p>
<p align="blockquote">from on high.</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;The Blessed Holy One</p>
<p align="blockquote">was Himself aroused</p>
<p align="blockquote">and came to them.</p>
<p align="blockquote">He found them</p>
<p align="blockquote">grieving bitterly,</p>
<p align="blockquote">with crying voices</p>
<p align="blockquote">amidst the dust of the Sanctuary.</p>
<p align="blockquote">He said to them:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2018;My soul&#x2019;s beloved&#x2014;what are you doing here?</p>
<p align="blockquote">Why is my beloved in my house?&#x2019;</p>
<p align="blockquote">Grandfather Abraham was the first to rise.</p>
<p align="blockquote">He addressed the world&#x2019;s Master:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2018;You know how I walked before You in the path of truth.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Ten times you tested me; I withstood them all.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Where are my children?</p>
<p align="blockquote">For I do not hear their voices</p>
<p align="blockquote">within the land in which you promised</p>
<p align="blockquote">to sustain them.&#x2019;</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;The Blessed Holy One said to him:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2018;Alas, Abraham my soul&#x2019;s beloved&#x0021;</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;Holy flesh has passed away from you&#x201D; [Jer. 11:15]:</p>
<p align="blockquote">your descendants annulled the holy covenant</p>
<p align="blockquote">and engaged in idolatrous worship.</p>
<p align="blockquote">For this reason</p>
<p align="blockquote">my anger waxed against them.</p>
<p align="blockquote">I was long suffering for your sake,</p>
<p align="blockquote">but they did not return to Me.&#x2019;</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;When Abraham heard this, he said:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2018;May all of their sins against the holiness of Your Name</p>
<p align="blockquote">be erased among the nations until You will to return them to You.&#x2019;</p>
<p align="blockquote">All of them acted thusly</p>
<p align="blockquote">and departed.</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;Yet Rachel remained there</p>
<p align="blockquote">and raised her voice in the most embittered of cries.</p>
<p align="blockquote">The Blessed Holy One said to her:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2018;Rachel, for what reason are you crying?&#x2019;</p>
<p align="blockquote">She said to him:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2018;Shall I not cry?</p>
<p align="blockquote">Where are my children?</p>
<p align="blockquote">How have they sinned against you?&#x2019;</p>
<p align="blockquote">God answered:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2018;They brought My rival before Me;</p>
<p align="blockquote">They introduced it into My house&#x0021;&#x2019;</p>
<p align="blockquote">Immediately, Rachel retorted:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2018;Did I not do more than that?</p>
<p align="blockquote">I brought my rival into my own house&#x0021;&#x2019;</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;As it is taught:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2018;Jacob told Rachel that he was her father&#x2019;s kinsman &#x2026;&#x2019; [Gen. 29:12].</p>
<p align="blockquote">Jacob said: &#x2018;Marry me.&#x2019;</p>
<p align="blockquote">Rachel said: &#x2018;Yes. But I have a sister who is older than I.</p>
<p align="blockquote">I fear my father for he is a trickster.&#x2019;</p>
<p align="blockquote">Immediately &#x2018;Jacob told Rachel that he was her father&#x2019;s kinsman&#x2019;:</p>
<p align="blockquote">akin to him in trickery.</p>
<p align="blockquote">He transmitted secret signs to her.</p>
<p align="blockquote">When Leah entered that night,</p>
<p align="blockquote">Rachel said:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2018;Now my sister will be shamed.&#x2019;</p>
<p align="blockquote">She went and taught her the signs.</p>
<p align="blockquote">For this reason she said to God:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2018;Have I not done more?</p>
<p align="blockquote">For I brought my rival into my house&#x0021;</p>
<p align="blockquote">And You, of whom it is written</p>
<p align="blockquote">that You are compassionate, gracious and long suffering.</p>
<p align="blockquote">You should have overlooked their sins&#x0021;&#x2019;</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;She accepted no comfort from everything which He said to her,</p>
<p align="blockquote">as it is written:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2018;A cry is heard in Ramah,</p>
<p align="blockquote">wailing, bitter weeping.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Rachel weeping for her children.</p>
<p align="blockquote">She refuses to be comforted</p>
<p align="blockquote">For her children who are gone.&#x2019;</p>
<p align="blockquote">She had no desire to receive comfort.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Why?</p>
<p align="blockquote">Because it was not like former days</p>
<p align="blockquote">when He rested among them.</p>
<p align="blockquote">But rather, He had ascended above.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Because God was no longer among her children</p>
<p align="blockquote">she refused consolation until He promised her:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2018;Restrain your voice from weeping,</p>
<p align="blockquote">Your eyes from shedding tears,</p>
<p align="blockquote">For there is a reward for your labor&#x2026;.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Your children shall return to their country&#x2019; [Jer. 39:16].</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;As Rachel acted in the worlds below,</p>
<p align="blockquote">So too the <italic>shekhinah</italic> engaged the worlds above.</p>

<p align="blockquote">It is indeed proper for you to cry.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Lamentation becomes you.</p>
<p align="blockquote">You should engage in mourning.</p>

<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;The angels of peace cry bitterly&#x201D; [Isa. 33:7];</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble,</p>
<p align="blockquote">and the strong men shall bow down,</p>
<p align="blockquote">and the grinders cease because they are few,</p>
<p align="blockquote">and those that gaze through the windows are darkened,</p>
<p align="blockquote">And the doors shall be shut in the street,</p>
<p align="blockquote">when the sound of the grinding is low,</p>
<p align="blockquote">and one shall start up at the voice of a bird,</p>
<p align="blockquote">and all of the daughters of music shall be brought low&#x201D; [Eccles. 12:3&#x2013;4].</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;In the days when the keepers of the house shall tremble&#x201D; [Eccles. 12:3]:</p>
<p align="blockquote">These are the three courts</p>
<p align="blockquote">which taught Torah</p>
<p align="blockquote">in the Chamber of Hewn Stone.</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;And the strong men shall bow down&#x201D;:</p>
<p align="blockquote">These are the members of the greater and lesser</p>
<p align="blockquote">Sanhedrin.</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;And those who grind cease &#x2026;&#x201D;:</p>
<p align="blockquote">These are the priests and the Levites</p>
<p align="blockquote">and all of the members of the Temple watches</p>
<p align="blockquote">present in Jerusalem.</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;Those who gaze out through the windows are darkened&#x201D;:</p>
<p align="blockquote">These are priests and seers who saw</p>
<p align="blockquote">through prophecy or the holy spirit.</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;The door shall be shut in the market&#x201D; [Eccles. 12:4]:</p>
<p align="blockquote">For people shall call out</p>
<p align="blockquote">but none sit before them,</p>
<p align="blockquote">for all of the gates have been closed</p>
<p align="blockquote">since the Temple was destroyed</p>
<p align="blockquote">and the service of our House of God abolished.</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;When the sound of the grinders is low&#x201D;:</p>
<p align="blockquote">These are the grinders of incense</p>
<p align="blockquote">whose sound could be heard each day</p>
<p align="blockquote">as they did their grinding.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Another Interpretation:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;the sound of the grinding&#x201D;:</p>
<p align="blockquote">this is the <italic>shekhinah&#x2019;s</italic> voice,</p>
<p align="blockquote">daily proclaiming:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;Return backsliding children.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote">But none pay her heed.</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;And all the daughters of music shall be brought low&#x201D;:</p>
<p align="blockquote">These are [the Levites]</p>
<p align="blockquote">who ascended daily</p>
<p align="blockquote">to their stage</p>
<p align="blockquote">and performed melodious song.</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;All&#x201D; the daughters means to include</p>
<p align="blockquote">the celestial angels above,</p>
<p align="blockquote">divided into watches on high,</p>
<p align="blockquote">corresponding to the watches below.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Those below have been brought low.</p>
<p align="blockquote">So too have the angels above, as it were,</p>
<p align="blockquote">been brought low.</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;When they shall be afraid also of that which is high,</p>
<p align="blockquote">and terrors shall be in the way,</p>
<p align="blockquote">and the almond tree shall blossom,</p>
<p align="blockquote">and the grasshopper shall drag itself along,</p>
<p align="blockquote">and the caperberry shall fail,</p>
<p align="blockquote">because man goes to his eternal home,</p>
<p align="blockquote">and the mourners go about the streets&#x201D; [Eccles. 12:5].</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;When they shall be afraid also of that which is high&#x201D;:</p>
<p align="blockquote">Even though they were dwarfs</p>
<p align="blockquote">when considered from above,</p>
<p align="blockquote">they were afraid.</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;Shall be brought low&#x201D;:</p>
<p align="blockquote">Those daughters of song were brought low,</p>
<p align="blockquote">for when eighty thousand Levites,</p>
<p align="blockquote">their hands bound behind their backs,</p>
<p align="blockquote">arrived at Babylon&#x2019;s rivers,</p>
<p align="blockquote">they hung their harps upon the trees.</p>
<p align="blockquote">The Babylonians requested that they play.</p>
<p align="blockquote">They responded:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;How can we sing the Lord&#x2019;s song</p>
<p align="blockquote">on foreign soil&#x201D; [Ps. 137:4].</p>
<p align="blockquote">They bit off their thumbs</p>
<p align="blockquote">with their teeth</p>
<p align="blockquote">so that they could not play</p>
<p align="blockquote">and then the Babylonians massacred them.</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;And terrors shall be in the way&#x201D;:</p>
<p align="blockquote">They marched with millstones</p>
<p align="blockquote">around their necks,</p>
<p align="blockquote">and due to the overwhelming pressure,</p>
<p align="blockquote">their fingers fell off their hands in the road.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Jeremiah would gather them in his cape,</p>
<p align="blockquote">kiss them,</p>
<p align="blockquote">bewail them,</p>
<p align="blockquote">say to them:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;My children,</p>
<p align="blockquote">Did I not instruct you:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2018;Give glory to the Lord your God</p>
<p align="blockquote">before it grows dark,</p>
<p align="blockquote">before you feet stumble &#x2026;&#x2019; [Jer. 13:16].&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote">And concerning this it is written:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;For the mountains I will</p>
<p align="blockquote">take up a weeping and a wailing,</p>
<p align="blockquote">and for the pastures of the wilderness</p>
<p align="blockquote">a lamentation&#x201D; [Jer. 9:9].</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;The Almond tree shall blossom&#x201D;:</p>
<p align="blockquote">Twenty-one days pass</p>
<p align="blockquote">from the day upon which</p>
<p align="blockquote">the blossoms of the almond tree sprout</p>
<p align="blockquote">to the day upon which it brings forth fruit.</p>
<p align="blockquote">So too,</p>

<p align="blockquote">until the ninth of Av<sup><xref rid="fn222">222</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote">is a period of twenty-one days.</p>
<p align="blockquote">As it is written:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;I see the rod of the almond tree&#x201D; [Jer. 1:11].</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;The grasshopper shall drag itself along&#x201D;:</p>
<p align="blockquote">For a burden has been placed</p>

<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;And the caperberry shall fail&#x201D;:</p>

<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;Before the silver cord is snapped asunder&#x201D;:</p>

<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;And the golden bowl is shattered&#x201D;:</p>
<p align="blockquote">That is the Holy of Holies,</p>

<p align="blockquote">R. Yudai commenced his discourse:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;&#x2018;In the day when the keepers</p>
<p align="blockquote">of the house shall tremble&#x2019; [Eccles. 12:3]:</p>
<p align="blockquote">These are the Tannaim and Amoraim,</p>
<p align="blockquote">who watched over the inhabitants</p>
<p align="blockquote">of the land of Israel</p>
<p align="blockquote">and were pulled from their places.</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2018;And the strong men shall bow down&#x2019; [Eccles. 12:3]:</p>
<p align="blockquote">Shall be treated perversely.</p>
<p align="blockquote">As it says:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2018;And there are men of valor in their midst&#x2019; [Gen. 47:6].</p>
<p align="blockquote">This refers to the sin of</p>
<p align="blockquote">the sons of Jacob,</p>
<p align="blockquote">strong, worthy men,</p>
<p align="blockquote">who suffered a perversion of justice,</p>
<p align="blockquote">as it is written:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2018;Does God pervert justice?&#x2019; [Job. 8:3].</p>
<p align="blockquote">These men of valor</p>
<p align="blockquote">received a perversion of justice.</p>
<p align="blockquote">For such is the serpent&#x2019;s path.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Upon killing a person,</p>
<p align="blockquote">it returns and bites him again, without mercy.</p>
<p align="blockquote">This is what is meant</p>
<p align="blockquote">by a perversion of justice.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the land of Israel sent this message to the Babylonians:</p>
<p align="blockquote">It befits you to lament</p>
<p align="blockquote">like one who cries from afar.</p>
<p align="blockquote">For mourning, eulogizing, crying</p>
<p align="blockquote">in lamentation and bitterness of spirit</p>
<p align="blockquote">are not germane to you.</p>
<p align="blockquote">You have washed your feet,</p>
<p align="blockquote">have no desire to dirty them</p>
<p align="blockquote">as you did earlier,</p>
<p align="blockquote">as it is written:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;I have washed my feet,</p>
<p align="blockquote">how shall I dirty them?&#x201D; [Cant. 5:3].</p>
<p align="blockquote">But we who dwell</p>
<p align="blockquote">within the borders of the serpent,</p>
<p align="blockquote">which daily kills and bites,</p>
<p align="blockquote">have seen with our very eyes</p>
<p align="blockquote">the perversion of justice</p>
<p align="blockquote">wrought among us,</p>
<p align="blockquote">directed toward those men of valor.</p>
<p align="blockquote">During their earlier, terrestrial lives</p>
<p align="blockquote">it made no demand for justice,</p>
<p align="blockquote">it kept its silence,</p>
<p align="blockquote">for it regarded them with a great terror</p>
<p align="blockquote">and could not stand against them.</p>
<p align="blockquote">When they entered the World that is Coming</p>
<p align="blockquote">in a state of contrition,</p>
<p align="blockquote">that serpent stood before</p>
<p align="blockquote">the Blessed Holy One</p>
<p align="blockquote">and demanded justice.</p>
<p align="blockquote">It referred specifically to the words of the verse:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;when an individual kidnaps a man and sells him,</p>
<p align="blockquote">if the victim is found within the kidnapper&#x2019;s presence,</p>
<p align="blockquote">the kidnapper shall be executed&#x201D; [Exod. 21:16].</p>
<p align="blockquote">The Blessed Holy One said to that serpent:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;Joseph was not yet a man.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Nor was he found in their hands.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote">The serpent returned and said:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;If a person kidnaps a soul</p>
<p align="blockquote">from among his brethren,</p>
<p align="blockquote">the children of Israel,</p>
<p align="blockquote">and abuses him by selling him,</p>
<p align="blockquote">that thief shall surely die&#x201D; [Deut. 24:7].</p>
<p align="blockquote">For eight hundred years that serpent</p>
<p align="blockquote">stood and demanded justice.</p>
<p align="blockquote">And we have taught:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;A person convicted on two counts</p>
<p align="blockquote">suffers the more severe penalty.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn223">223</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote">Woe is he who receives punishment for his sins&#x0021;</p>
<p align="blockquote">For death atones for his offenses</p>
<p align="blockquote">but they returned to undergo additional punishment&#x0021;</p>
<p align="blockquote">Alas&#x0021;</p>
<p align="blockquote">These men of valor were mistreated</p>
<p align="blockquote">as Samael the serpent stood up</p>
<p align="blockquote">to demand judgement.</p>
<p align="blockquote">For this reason</p>
<p align="blockquote">it is fitting for us</p>
<p align="blockquote">to cry and lament,</p>
<p align="blockquote">for the holy city</p>
<p align="blockquote">remains devoid of all</p>
<p align="blockquote">of the good things</p>
<p align="blockquote">which were found within it.</p>
<p align="blockquote">At that moment Samael descended</p>
<p align="blockquote">and confounded the world,</p>
<p align="blockquote">introducing this evil spirit</p>
<p align="blockquote">into the maws of that wicked man,</p>
<p align="blockquote">the sovereign of Rome,</p>
<p align="blockquote">who demanded justice</p>
<p align="blockquote">from the mighty ones of the world<sup><xref rid="fn224">224</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote">[for the kidnapping of Joseph].</p>
<p align="blockquote">Woe&#x0021;</p>
<p align="blockquote">Woe to the world&#x0021;</p>
<p align="blockquote">Such a miscarriage of justice</p>
<p align="blockquote">has not occurred</p>
<p align="blockquote">since the world&#x2019;s creation.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Alas&#x0021;</p>
<p align="blockquote">Your children,</p>
<p align="blockquote">the world&#x2019;s pillars,</p>
<p align="blockquote">its founding columns,</p>
<p align="blockquote">sustaining its very existence,</p>
<p align="blockquote">who served as its crowns&#x2014;</p>
<p align="blockquote">how they have been daily</p>
<p align="blockquote">abused by that serpent&#x0021;</p>
<p align="blockquote">How those holy spirits</p>
<p align="blockquote">have been abused</p>
<p align="blockquote">when they were enclothed</p>
<p align="blockquote">in alien garments,</p>
<p align="blockquote">so that they might be judged</p>
<p align="blockquote">in such a shameful manner.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Alas,</p>
<p align="blockquote">such a miscarriage of justice&#x0021;</p>
<p align="blockquote">Who saw in the Garden of Eden</p>
<p align="blockquote">on the day justice passed into the world</p>
<p align="blockquote">these ten brightest pearls,</p>
<p align="blockquote">the light of all the Garden</p>
<p align="blockquote">amid all those trees&#x0021;</p>
<p align="blockquote">Those lights were flowing outward</p>
<p align="blockquote">and all the trees of Eden cried forth:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;Men of valor are being mistreated&#x0021;&#x201D; [Eccles. 12:3].</p>
<p align="blockquote">Those who guard the gates of Eden</p>
<p align="blockquote">were shaken;</p>
<p align="blockquote">The cherubim went up and down</p>
<p align="blockquote">but found no place to bring forth these lights</p>
<p align="blockquote">once they had emerged from their garments.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Those above and below</p>
<p align="blockquote">cried out before them.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Those who guard the upper walls trembled,</p>
<p align="blockquote">All the upper forces crying and wailing.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Who saw our Mother break out in wailing?</p>
<p align="blockquote">She went to those cherubim</p>
<p align="blockquote">who guard the gates of Eden</p>
<p align="blockquote">and found them trembling.</p>
<p align="blockquote">She and a single cherub ascended.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Then the blade of the ever-turning sword, ever so sharp,</p>
<p align="blockquote">burst through the gates.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Out poured the ten lights.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Those above and below cried out:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;Woe to the world&#x0021; Woe to that generation&#x0021;&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote">We indeed should mourn like jackels.</p>
<p align="blockquote">When our Mother came down</p>
<p align="blockquote">and did not find them in the Garden,</p>
<p align="blockquote">seeing all the light and perfumes breaking out in tears,</p>
<p align="blockquote">So too did She.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Then the cherubim,</p>
<p align="blockquote">Guardians of the Garden,</p>
<p align="blockquote">also wept.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Wailing, they began to cry.</p>
<p align="blockquote">How much more should we cry out</p>
<p align="blockquote">for all of it,</p>
<p align="blockquote">including this injustice&#x0021;</p>
<p align="blockquote">Again he began:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;They sent a message to Joseph, saying:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2018;Your father commanded before he died, telling us:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;Say unto Joseph: &#x2018;Forgive, I pray you,</p>
<p align="blockquote">the transgression of your brothers and their sin,</p>
<p align="blockquote">for they did you harm&#x2026;.&#x2019;&#x201D;&#x2019;</p>
<p align="blockquote">And Joseph wept when they spoke to him&#x201D; [Gen. 50:16-17].</p>
<p align="blockquote">It was against him that they sinned.</p>
<p align="blockquote">But he forgave them, atoning for their sins&#x0021;</p>
<p align="blockquote">Since he forgave them,</p>
<p align="blockquote">Who dares accuse them of their sins?</p>
<p align="blockquote">Indeed,</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;Men of valor have been treated perversely&#x0021;&#x201D; [Eccles. 12:3].</p>
<p align="blockquote">A great miscarriage of justice</p>
<p align="blockquote">was done to those men of valor.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Woe is us&#x0021; Who can comfort us?</p>
<p align="blockquote">Why did that miscarriage of justice come about?</p>
<p align="blockquote">Because our Mother had been banished and driven forth,</p>
<p align="blockquote">Gone on Her way.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Because of this justice was perverted.</p>
<p align="blockquote">The accuser stood there alone&#x0021;</p>
<p align="blockquote">There was no one to protest,</p>
<p align="blockquote">to lay out our case.</p>
<p align="blockquote">For this reason</p>
<p align="blockquote">all of our Mother&#x2019;s adornments</p>
<p align="blockquote">were placed in his hands.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Had our Mother been there,</p>
<p align="blockquote">She&#x2019;d have taken them</p>
<p align="blockquote">beyond the line of justice&#x0021;</p>
<p align="blockquote">For this She weeps,</p>
<p align="blockquote">wailing for Her children who are exiled,</p>
<p align="blockquote">killed, consumed</p>
<p align="blockquote">for nought.</p>
<p align="blockquote">She was not present at their judgment,</p>
<p align="blockquote">so the serpent did as he wished with them.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Of this Scripture says:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;At your sin, your mother was sent away&#x0021;&#x201D; [Isa. 50:1].</p>
<p align="blockquote">Your Mother was sent away</p>
<p align="blockquote">so that she not be present at your trial.</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;How does she sit solitary&#x0021;&#x201D; [Lam. 1:1].</p>
<p align="blockquote">In that hour</p>
<p align="blockquote">when She bears the complaint of her children,</p>
<p align="blockquote">since it was because of Her</p>
<p align="blockquote">that their judgment was carried out.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Now when those ten pearls</p>
<p align="blockquote">came forth from the Garden of Eden</p>
<p align="blockquote">to be dressed in other garments,<sup><xref rid="fn225">225</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote">All of those garments were given over</p>
<p align="blockquote">Into the hands of the serpent,</p>
<p align="blockquote">except for one.</p>
<p align="blockquote">That is Reuben, of whom it says:</p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x201C;Reuben returned to the pit&#x201D; [Gen. 37:29].</p>
<p align="blockquote">Because he counseled to put Joseph in the pit,</p>
<p align="blockquote">he was caught in the pit and saved.</p>
<p align="blockquote">This refers to Rabbi Eliezer the Great.</p>
<p align="blockquote">When the heretics caught him<sup><xref rid="fn226">226</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote">he was placed in a pit.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Thus the soul of Reuben was saved.</p>

The term is used as well to designate the vowel signs that are placed above and below the consonants of the Hebrew alphabet and look very much like points (<italic>nekudot</italic>). R.

<ftnote id="fn56"><sup>56</sup> Concerning this verse, the Midrash states: &#x201C;As for the Holy One, blessed be He, His name and might, when He declaims in enunciated speech, the sound is divided into seven voices.&#x201D; Divine speech creates the cosmogenerative septet ranging from <italic>&#x1E25;esed</italic> to the <italic>shekhinah</italic>.
