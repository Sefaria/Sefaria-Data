"Commentary on Lamentations, Introduction.1","When speaking about the Kabbalistic interpretation of Scripture and its place within the fourfold Jewish understanding of Scripture in the Middle Ages, the logical starting point would seem to be that of Kabbalistic notions of Scripture and the art of its interpretation. But sometimes neither reality nor pedagogy conforms to our standard notions of logic—particularly the case when dealing with mystical matters. In the world of Kabbalah we often have to commence with <i>aggadah</i> and its rereading of Scripture rather than with the Bible itself. Medieval Judaism, in all its forms, is a rabbinic religion. This means not only that the Biblical text is authoritative but also that the text as understood by the rabbis of the Talmudic period is the authoritative reading of Scripture. This authority of text-as-received through the rabbinic filter is most applicable to the realm of <i>halakhah</i> or religious praxis, but has some validity in the parallel realm of <i>aggadah</i> or theological narrative as well."
"Commentary on Lamentations, Introduction.2","Of course medieval Jewish exegetes have rediscovered the <i>peshat</i>, simple or literal reading of Scripture. Influenced by the Arab grammarians and new trends in Qur’an exegesis, Hebrew scholars from the tenth century began to set aside the rabbinic readings in order to dig out what they thought were the original meanings of Biblical texts. Even so deeply rabbinic a writer as RaSHI (Rabbi Solomon Itshaki (1040–1105), the best-known Jewish commentator, could sidestep rabbinic tradition with such a phrase as: “but I seek nought but the plain meaning of Scripture.”"
"Commentary on Lamentations, Introduction.3","Nevertheless, the rabbinic readings (in the plural, to be sure, since midrashic exegesis is by nature polysemous) retained great currency, and the medieval Jewish imagination was often constructed around them. This is especially true for Kabbalah, a tradition deeply formed by and engaged in fervent dialogue with the values, symbols and concepts of the rabbinic tradition. The great classic of Kabbalah, the Zohar, is a pseudoepigraphic midrash purporting to be the words of second century sages. When Kabbalists move from the open exegesis of authentic rabbinic sources to the creation of their own midrashic hermeneutics, they see themselves as literally reopening the wells of aggadic creativity and reanimating the process of Oral Torah."
"Commentary on Lamentations, Introduction.4","The enormous devotion to Oral Torah in Kabbalistic circles is in part due to the fact that Oral Torah is identified with “Our Lady the <i>shekhinah</i>,” the feminine component of divinity toward whom the Kabbalists saw themselves as having a special devotion. But it is also due to the fact that Kabbalah really reflects a rebirth of the aggadic process. There is much in the Zohar that follows directly in the rabbinic line of Scriptural readings, comprehensible even without reference to the sefirotic grid of symbols that makes for Kabbalah itself. The world of the Zohar is an attempt to re-create the world of the Tannaim. This includes the narrative portions of the text, recounting alleged wanderings of the early rabbis and referring to (mostly fictional and often newly invented) events in their lives. But it is true of the homiletical sections as well: every page is woven out of allusions to and dialogue with the Talmudic tradition, not as hoary and ancient source but rather as a living, contemporary reality and conversation partner. There are no borders between the midrashic page and the Zoharic dialogue. There is an intertextual conversation here that we are only beginning to chart, but one that has a unique complexity: the Kabbalist encounters Scripture through the veil of a rabbinic reading that he seeks to become a part of and revivify, while also uncovering within both prior corpuses those elements that will become the foundations of his own new enrichment of the discourse in the form of properly Kabbalistic exegesis."
"Commentary on Lamentations, Introduction.5","The medievals’ dialogue with the Rabbis is not always an easy one. Among the philosophical exegetes we are familiar with great discomfort with elements of <i>aggadah</i> and its readings of the Bible. Some of this discomfort was apologetic in nature: both Christian and Karaite writers had long mocked the rabbis’ fanciful readings of shared Scriptures. But philosophically sophisticated readers were also undoubtedly genuinely disturbed by some of the extremes of rabbinic anthropomorphism, to say nothing of such “shocking” quasi-rabbinic traditions as merkavah mysticism and especially <i>shi‘ur komah</i>. This was significantly less true for the Kabbalists than for their philosophic rivals. Kabbalists share far more with the rabbis than the philosophers do; they are more comfortable with much of the conceptual world and idiom of rabbinic discourse, including the rabbinic world’s highly personal and even anthropomorphic sense of the divine, its mythic worldview, and its delight in the miraculous. Although Kabbalah itself may be seen as a systematic theosophy and cosmology, the Zohar mostly sets aside presentation of this grand system, accepting the typically Jewish and rabbinic valorization of narrative over analytical theological discourse."
"Commentary on Lamentations, Introduction.6","But there remain moments when the encounter with the rabbis is not an easy one, when rabbinic texts can disturb and even appall the Kabbalists. Sometimes they find that they cannot accept a particular trajectory within the rabbinic tradition. Then they devote their considerable literary and theological skills in part to deflect it, hoping to find a solution to a burning theological problem when a rabbinic response seems to be absolutely unnerving. Sometimes classical Jewish theology, rooted in Scripture as understood exoterically, paints the Sages into a corner and thus requires radical reformulation; here the new Kabbalistic readings may be brought in <i>against</i> the rabbis, a counter-tradition purporting to uncover a deeper meaning of Scripture that can help us out of the bind created by earlier readings."
"Commentary on Lamentations, Introduction.7","This is very much the case regarding the issue of theodicy, one of the core concerns of the Kabbalistic tradition, the key subject of the text before us. This section of the Zohar needs to be read in the context of a comparative analysis of midrashic and Zoharic responses to the Book of Lamentations, reflecting the two great tragedies of 586 <small>BCE</small>. and 70 <small>CE.</small>, already quite homologized into one by the rabbinic sources. Here we see a zoharic text as much engaged in polemic as it is in dialogue. Hopefully an understanding of this will take us beyond the text at hand, serving as a window into the incredible complexity of the world created by the zoharic imagination."
"Commentary on Lamentations, Introduction.8","A much later Kabbalist, R. Solomon Shlomiel of Dresnitz, a keen-eyed participant/observer of the Safed revival of Kabbalah in the sixteenth century, recounts a story about R. Abraham b. Eliezer ha-Levi Berukhim (ca. 1515–93), who had a vision of the <i>shekhinah</i> as Mother Rachel or Mother Zion, draped in black and in mourning for Zion, projected upon the Western Wall. The fact that he sees her at that holy place is in harmony with the words of R. Aha: “Never has the <i>shekhinah</i> departed from the Western Wall of the Temple: as it is written: ‘Here she stands behind our latticework’ [Cant. 2:9].”<sup>209</sup><i class=""footnote""> Midrash Tanhuma, <i>shemot</i> 10.</i> But it is most unlikely that R. Aha would have called an apparition in feminine form by the term <i>shekhinah</i>. The association of <i>shekhinah</i>, the indwelling presence of God in the world, with the feminine images of Community of Israel, Mother Zion, and so forth, is specifically a Kabbalistic innovation."
"Commentary on Lamentations, Introduction.9","R. Abraham’s vision is a powerful expression of the exegetical construction of reality depicted in the zoharic accounts of the <i>shekhinah</i>’s midnight lament that we have before us. This zoharic text is completely rooted in one set of tradents in rabbinic theodic texts—the image of the weeping and lamenting God—but also strikes me as an attempt to defuse the anger permeating certain strata of Lamentations Rabbah. That anger is directed towards a notion of the divine and divine justice which the Sages themselves find abusive, and against which they are in rebellion. The fierce outcry against divine injustice is a key component of the Lamentations Rabbah tradition, and one that carries over into later Jewish attitudes, reflected so strongly, for example, in the poignant elegies written in response to the First Crusade. By picking up on a different strand of rabbinic tradition, the Zohar is attempting to carry forth an alternative conception of divine justice, one founded upon the notion of divine exile and suffering. The powerful descriptions in the following passage of <i>shekhinah</i>’s mourning should be read as an attempt to restore credibility to the notion of divine goodness and compassion—and thus to provide Israel hope for its future."
"Commentary on Lamentations, Introduction.10","This passage is a section from the work entitled <i>Zohar Ḥadash</i> by the Kabbalists who collected it for the edition of Salonika, 1597. <i>Zohar Ḥadash</i> is a collection of sources, mostly by the author(s) of the original Zohar, that had been left out of the earlier (1558–60) Zohar editions. Despite its later appearance, this introduction and commentary on the opening verse of Lamentations is considered by scholars to belong to the <i>Midrash ha-Ne‘elam</i> (“Hidden Midrash”) stratum of the Zohar."
