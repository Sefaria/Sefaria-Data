<title>MAIMONIDES&#x2019; INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>All the precepts that were given to Moses at Sinai were given with their interpretation, as it is written: &#x201C;I will give you the stone tablets with the teaching and the commandment&#x201D; (Exodus 24:12). <italic>Teaching</italic> implies the written Torah, and <italic>commandment</italic>&#x2014;its interpretation. He has commanded us to practise what the Torah teaches in accordance with the <italic>Mitzvah</italic>, which is referred to as the Oral Torah. Moses wrote the entire Torah himself before he died, and presented a copy to each tribe. He placed one copy in the Ark as a witness, as it is written: &#x201C;Take this book of the Torah and place it beside the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God&#x2026;&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 31:26). He did not write down the <italic>Mitzvah</italic>, which is the interpretation of the Torah, but bequeathed it to the elders, to Joshua, and to all the people of Israel, as it is written: &#x201C;Be careful to observe everything that I am commanding you&#x2026;&#x201D; (13:1). For this reason, it is called Oral Torah. Although the Oral Torah was not committed to writing, Moses taught the whole of it to the seventy elders who were included in his court. Elazar, Phineas and Joshua, the three of them, received it from Moses. He handed down the Oral Torah to Joshua, the disciple of our teacher Moses, and charged him concerning it. Joshua, too, taught it orally throughout his life. Many elders received the oral tradition from Joshua; Eli received it from the elders and from Phineas; Samuel received it from Eli and his court; and David received it from Samuel and his court.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Our saintly Rabbi Judah compiled the Mishnah. From the days of Moses to the time of our saintly Rabbi Judah they had composed no work to be taught in public on subjects of the Oral Torah; but in each generation, the head of the supreme court, or a prophet who lived in that period, would note down for himself a memorandum of the traditions which he apprehended from his teachers, transmitting them to the public orally. So too, everyone would note down for his own use as much as he could the traditional intrepretation of the Torah and the rules of conduct that were based on it, as he perceived them.&#x2014; &#x2014; This used to be the regular procedure until the appearance of our saintly Rabbi Judah. He compiled all the traditions, laws, comments, and interpretations, which had been transmitted by our teacher Moses and by the courts of the preceding generations, with regard to the entire Torah. He employed all this material, of which he composed the work of the Mishnah. Then he taught it diligently to the students in public, so that it became well known to all the people of Israel, who made copies of it and taught it everywhere, so that the Oral Torah might not be forgotten among the Jewish people.</p>
<p>Now, why did our saintly Rabbi Judah do what he did and did not leave things as they were? Because he realized that the number of students kept decreasing, while ever new troubles kept coming; a wicked government was spreading out in the world and rising in power; the Jewish people were wandering about, migrating to distant localities. So he composed a work, designed as a handbook for everybody, in order that they might study from it speedily and that it should not be forgotten. He spent all his life teaching the Mishnah in public together with his colleagues, members of his court.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Rav compiled the Sifra and the Sifr&#x00E9; to explain and to impart the principles of the Mishnah. Rabbi &#x1E24;iyya compiled the Tosefta to explain the subject matter of the Mishnah. Similarly, Rabbi Hoshaya and Bar Kappara compiled Baraithoth to interpret the wording of the Mishnah. Rabbi Yo&#x1E25;anan compiled the Jerusalem Talmud, in Eretz Yisrael, about three centuries after the destruction of the Temple.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Ravina and Rav Ashi were the last sages of the Talmud. Rav Ashi compiled the Babylonian Talmud, in Babylonia, about one century after Rabbi Yo&#x1E25;anan&#x2019;s compilation of the Jerusalem Talmud.&#x2014; &#x2014; It follows therefore that Ravina and Rav Ashi, together with their colleagues, were the last great sages who transmitted the Oral Torah.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>The scholars who rose shortly after the compilation of the Talmud and studied it deeply became famous for their wisdom. They are called Geonim. The Geonim who rose in Eretz Yisrael and Babylonia, Spain and France, studied the method of the Talmud, elucidated its obscure passages, and explained its subject matter; for indeed, the way of the Talmud is exceedingly deep.&#x2014; &#x2014; The inhabitants of every town addressed many questions to each contemporary Gaon and asked for explanations of difficult passages in the Talmud. The Geonim would answer the questions to the best of their knowledge. Those who posed the questions compiled the responsa into books for purposes of study.</p>
<p>The Geonim of successive generations also wrote commentaries on the Talmud. Some of them intrepreted specific laws, while others explained particular chapters that were found difficult in their time. Still others expounded complete tractates and entire orders of the Talmud. They also made compilations of established rules concerning what is forbidden or permissible, what is or is not punishable, in matters of immediate concern, so as to make them intelligible to anyone who cannot penetrate the depths of the Talmud. All the Geonim of Israel were engaged in this work of the Lord ever since the Talmud was compiled until this date, which is the eighth year of the eleventh century after the destruction of the Temple, corresponding to the year four thousand nine hundred thirty-seven since the creation of the world (1177 common era).</p>
<p>At the present time, when severe disasters keep following one another and the needs of the moment brush aside all things, our wise men lose their wits, and the understanding of our clever people is hidden. Hence, the commentaries, the codes of law and the responsa, which were written by the Geonim who regarded them as easily intelligible, have presented difficulties in our days, so that a mere few are capable of understanding their subject matter properly. Needless to say that this applies particularly to the Talmud itself, the Babylonian as well as the Palestinian, the Sifra, the Sifr&#x00E9;, and the Tosefta, works that require wide knowledge, a learned mind, and ample time.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>I bestirred myself therefore, I, Moshe ben Maimun the Sefardi, and relied upon the Creator, blessed be he, and made a thorough study of all these books, and decided to put down in writing the results obtained from all these works as to what is prohibited or permitted, unclean or clean, and the other laws of the Torah&#x2014; &#x2014; all in plain language and concisely, so that the entire Oral Torah might become familiar to all systematically, without arguments and counterarguments, one man saying so and another something else; but rather clear, convincing statements, governed by the logic derived from all these compilations and commentaries that have appeared since the time of Moses until now, so that all the laws be open to old and young alike, whether they belong to the precepts of the written Torah or to the enactments and ordinances introduced by sages and prophets. In brief, in order that no one should be in need of any other work dealing with the laws of Israel, this work is to include the entire oral Torah along with the ordinances, customs and decrees instituted from the time of Moses till the compilation of the Talmud, and in accord with what the Geonim explained to us in all their works composed after the Talmud.</p>
<p>I have named this work <italic>Mishneh Torah</italic> because the person who first reads the Written Torah and then this <italic>Mishneh Torah</italic> will know from it the entire Oral Torah without having to read any other book between them.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>The number of precepts of the Torah that are observed through all generations is six hundred thirteen. Two hundred forty-eight of these, corresponding to the number of bones in the human body, are affirmative; three hundred sixty-five precepts, corresponding to the number of days in the solar year, are negative.</p>

<title>FUNDAMENTALS OF THE TORAH</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. The fundamental principle and pillar of all science is to know that there is a First Being who has brought everything that exists into being.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>5. This Being is the God of the universe, the Lord of the entire world. It is he who controls the celestial sphere with a power to which there is neither end nor limit, with a power that is never interrupted. For, the celestial sphere is always revolving, and it is impossible for it to revolve without someone causing it to revolve; it is God, blessed be he, who causes it to revolve without using a hand or physical force.</p>
<p>8. It is plainly stated in the Torah and the Prophets that God is bodiless, for it is written: &#x201C;The Lord is God in the heavens above and on the earth beneath&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 4:39; Joshua 2:11), and no physical object can be in two places at the same time. Furthermore, it is written: &#x201C;You saw no form at all&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 4:15); &#x201C;to whom can you liken me as an equal?&#x201D; (Isaiah 40:25). If God were a physical substance he would be like other physical beings.</p>
<p>9. In view of this, what can be the meaning of the following expressions written in the Torah: &#x201C;Under his feet&#x201D; (Exodus 24:10); &#x201C;inscribed with the finger of God&#x201D; (Exodus 31:18); &#x201C;the hand of the Lord&#x201D; (Exodus 9:3); &#x201C;the eyes of the Lord&#x201D; (Genesis 38:7); &#x201C;the ears of the Lord&#x201D; (Numbers 11:1), and other such phrases? They are all adapted to human perception, apprehending only physical substances. The Torah speaks the language of human beings. Hence, all expressions like &#x201C;I whet my glittering sword&#x201D; are metaphorical. Has God a sword? Does he slay with a sword? It is a figure of speech; it is all figurative.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Two</h1>
<p>1. It is our duty to love and revere this honored and revered God, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall love the Lord your God.&#x201D; &#x201C;You shall revere the Lord your God&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 6:5, 13).</p>
<p>2. Now, what is the way that leads to the love of him and the reverence for him? When a person contemplates his great and wondrous acts and creations, obtaining from them a glimpse of his wisdom, which is beyond compare and infinite, he will promptly love and glorify him, longing exceedingly to know the great Name of God, as David said: &#x201C;My whole being thirsts for God, the living God&#x201D; (Psalm 42:3). When he ponders over these very subjects, he will forthwith recoil startled, conceiving that he is a lowly, obscure creature,&#x2014; &#x2014; as David said: &#x201C;As I look up to the heavens thy fingers made &#x2026; what is man that thou shouldst think of him?&#x201D; (Psalm 8:4-5).&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Five</h1>
<p>1. All those who belong to the house of Israel are commanded to sanctify the great Name of God, as it is written: &#x201C;I will be sanctified among the people of Israel&#x201D;; they must take heed lest they profane it, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall not profane my holy name&#x201D; (Leviticus 22:32). If, for example, a heathen arises and threatens a Jew to violate any of the precepts that are mentioned in the Torah, or he will kill him, the Jew should commit the transgression rather than be slain, for it is written concerning the precepts: &#x201C;If a man obeys them, he shall live by them&#x201D; (Leviticus 18:5)&#x2014;live by them, and not die by them. He is to blame for his death if he dies rather than commit a transgression.</p>
<p>2. This applies to all commandments except those concerning idolatry, illicit sex behavior, and bloodshed. If a Jew is told to transgress one of these three or he will be killed, he should suffer death rather than transgress.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>4. Anyone who is enjoined to transgress rather than be killed is to blame for his death if he chooses to die rather than transgress. On the other hand, anyone who is enjoined to suffer death rather than transgress has sanctified the Name of God by suffering death rather than transgressing. If his martyrdom was in the presence of ten Jews, he sanctified the Name of God publicly like Daniel, &#x1E24;ananyah, Mishael and Azaryah, or like Rabbi Akivah and his colleagues. These are the martyrs than whom none ranks higher.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>10. Anyone who voluntarily transgresses any of the commandments enjoined in the Torah, not under compulsion but spitefully and contemptuously, profanes the Name of God.&#x2014; &#x2014; If he transgressed in the presence of ten Jews, he has profaned the Divine Name publicly. On the other hand, whoever abstains from a transgression, or performs a good deed for no selfish reason, such as fear or vainglory, but only for the sake of the Creator, blessed be he, as in the case of Joseph who resisted his master&#x2019;s wife, sanctifies the Name of God.</p>
<p>11. There are other things which are included in the term <italic>profanation of the Name</italic>. When a great Jewish scholar, who is widely known for his piety, does certain things that make people talk against him, even though they are not sins, he profanes the Name of God.&#x2014; &#x2014; On the other hand, if the scholar has been scrupulous in his conduct, gentle in his conversation, sociable, and receiving fellow men cheerfully, without insulting those who embarrass him, but showing courtesy to all, even to men who treat him with disrespect, and conducting his business affairs with integrity,&#x2014; &#x2014; traits for which he is admired and loved by all who desire to follow his example, he sanctifies the Name of God, and concerning him it is written: &#x201C;He said to me: You are my servant, Israel, through whom I will be glorified&#x201D; (Isaiah 49:3).</p>
<h1>Chapter Seven</h1>
<p>2. The prophets are of varied degrees. Just as one scholar is greater than another in scholarship, so is one prophet greater than another in the gift of prophecy. The prophets see their prophetic visions only in dreams at night or by day, following a trance that falls upon them, as it is written: &#x201C;I make myself known to him by visions, I talk to him in dreams&#x201D; (Numbers 12:6). When they have a prophetic experience, their limbs tremble, their physical strength fails them, their thoughts become confused, and their mind is free to comprehend the vision it sees.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>3. The things imparted to the prophet in a prophetic vision are conveyed to him in the form of an allegory. Its interpretation is immediately impressed upon his mind during the vision, so that he knows what it signifies.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>4. The prophets do not prophesy whenever they please. They first concentrate their minds, relaxing, joyous and cheerful, and remain in solitude. Prophecy does not descend upon one who is sad or lazy, but results from joy. For this reason, the young prophets had lutes, drums, flutes, and lyres playing in front of them when they desired to prophesy (I Samuel 10:5). The word <italic>mithnabbeim</italic>, used in that connection, means that they were getting ready to prophesy, as one would say: &#x201C;So-and-so is getting to be great.&#x201D;</p>
<p>5. Those who seek the gift of prophecy are called <italic>sons of prophets</italic>. Even though they concentrate their minds, the divine spirit may or may not descend upon them.</p>
<h1>Chapter Nine</h1>
<p>1. It is clearly stated in the Torah that its laws, enduring forever, will undergo no change, diminution or augmentation, as it is written: &#x201C;Whatever I command you, you shall be careful to observe, adding nothing to it, taking nothing from it&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 13:1).&#x2014; &#x2014; Hence, you may infer that no prophet is permitted to introduce anything new in the Torah. If anyone should arise, therefore, Jew or non-Jew, showing signs and wonders, and declaring that God has sent him to add a precept to the Torah or take away a precept from the Torah, or to give an interpretation to any of the commandments contrary to what we have heard from Moses, or asserting that the commandments enjoined to Israel are not for all generations but only temporary&#x2014;he is a false prophet, because he sets out to deny the prophecy of Moses. He is punished by death through strangling for having spoken perversely in the name of God that which he did not command him. The Lord, blessed be his name, enjoined Moses that this Law shall be for us and for our children forever, and God is not a man that he should break his word.</p>
<p>2. This being so, why then is it written in the Torah: &#x201C;I will raise up a prophet for them among their own people, like yourself&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 18:18)? The prophet here alluded to will not come to establish a new religion, but to charge the people concerning the words of the Torah and to warn them against transgressing it, as the last of the prophets asserted: &#x201C;Remember the Torah of Moses my servant&#x201D; (Malachi 3:22).&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>ETHICAL IDEAS</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. All human beings are characterized by many traits which differ from each other profoundly. One man is hot-tempered, constantly angry; another is self-possessed and never angry, or only slightly and rarely so. One man is excessively proud; another is excessively meek. One man indulges in appetites without being sufficiently gratified; another is pure of heart and does not crave even the few essentials that the body requires. One man is so greedy that all the money in the world would not satisfy him, as it is written: &#x201C;A lover of money will never be satisfied with money&#x201D; (Ecclesiastes 5:9); another, contented with very little, curtails his desires and does not strive to obtain all that he really needs. One man starves himself while hoarding up wealth, and does not enjoy anything for which he has to pay the least amount; another recklessly squanders all he has. And so it is with all human dispositions, such as hilarity and gloom, niggardliness and generosity, cruelty and compassion, cowardice and courage.</p>
<p>4. The right way is the middle course in each set of human traits, namely: the disposition which is equally distant from the two extremes. Hence, the ancient sages ordained that every person should always evaluate his dispositions and adjust them in the middle course, so that he may enjoy physical health. Thus a person should be neither hot-tempered and easily provoked to anger, nor should he be like a corpse that has no feeling, but average, getting angry only for a grave cause that rightly calls for indignation, in order to prevent anything similar from occurring again. Furthermore, he should desire only that which the body needs for its sustenance and cannot do without, as it is written: &#x201C;The good man eats enough to satisfy his needs&#x201D; (Proverbs 13:25). He should exert himself at his vocation only enough to obtain what is necessary for his livelihood, as it is written: &#x201C;The little that a good man has is good&#x201D; (Psalm 37:16). He should be neither tight-fisted nor too lavish, but give charity according to his means, and extend suitable loans to those who are in need. He should be neither hilarious nor gloomy, but always quietly cheerful. This applies to all other dispositions; it is the way of the wise. He who avoids extremes and follows the middle course in all things is a wise man.</p>
<p>6. The precept concerning walking in God&#x2019;s ways (Deuteronomy 28:9) has been interpreted by the sages to mean: &#x201C;Be gracious even as he is called gracious; be merciful even as he is called merciful; be holy even as he is called holy&#x201D; (Shabbath 133b). Thus the prophets described God by all kinds of attributes, &#x201C;slow to anger and abounding in kindness, righteous and just, perfect and mighty,&#x201D; and so on, to inform us that these traits are good and right and man ought to adopt them for himself and thereby imitate God as much as he can.</p>
<p>7. How shall a man train himself in these traits so that they become ingrained in him? Let him keep practising time and again the actions that are prompted by the middle-course dispositions, repeating them continually, till they become easy for him rather than burdensome and work into his moral constitution. Now, since the Creator is referred to by these terms, that represent the middle path in which we are to walk, this path is called the <italic>way of God</italic>. Our forefather Abraham taught it to his children, as it is written: &#x201C;Indeed, I have chosen him, that he may charge his children and his household after him to observe the way of the Lord, doing what is good and right.&#x201D; Whoever walks in this path secures for himself happiness and blessedness, as it is written in the same verse: &#x201C;So that the Lord may fulfill for Abraham what he has promised him&#x201D; (Genesis 18:19).</p>
<h1>Chapter Two</h1>
<p>1. Those who are physically ill make out bitter to be sweet, and sweet to be bitter. Some patients crave inedible things to eat, such as dirt and charcoal, and dislike wholesome foods, like bread and meat, depending on the severity of the malady. Similarly, people who are spiritually ill desire and love evil dispositions, and hate the way that is good and are too indolent to walk in it; they regard it as extremely difficult, in accordance with their illness. Of such people Isaiah says: &#x201C;Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil, who change darkness into light, and light into darkness, who put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter&#x201D; (Isaiah 5:20). Of them it is also written: &#x201C;Who leave the paths of light to follow the ways of darkness&#x201D; (Proverbs 2:13). Now, what is the remedy for those who are spiritually ill? Let them go to the wise who are healers of the spirit and they will cure their illness by instructing them until they restore them to the good path. As for those who realize that they possess evil traits and do not go to the wise to heal them, Solomon said: &#x201C;Fools despise wisdom and instruction&#x201D; (Proverbs 1:7).</p>
<p>2. By what method are they to be cured? If one is hot-tempered, he is told to train himself to the point that even if he is assaulted or insulted, he should pay no attention. He should follow this course a long time, until his fierce temperament has been rooted out. If a person is arrogant, he should deliberately humiliate himself by sitting below everybody and wearing old and ragged clothes that reduce one to contempt, and so on, until arrogance is rooted out from his mind and he has returned to the middle course which is the right way. After regaining the middle course, he should follow it the rest of his life. In this manner he should act with regard to all other dispositions. If he is inclined toward one extreme, he should move toward the opposite extreme, and keep to it for a long time till he has returned to the right path which is the middle course in each type of disposition.</p>
<p>3. There are some traits which must not be cultivated as a middle course only, but should be shunned to the extreme. Haughty pride is one of them. The right way is not merely being meek, but one should be of a lowly spirit to the utmost. Hence it is written of Moses our teacher that he was &#x201C;exceedingly humble&#x201D; (Numbers 12:3), and not merely &#x201C;humble.&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x2014; Anger, too, is an extremely bad quality, and one should shun it to the utmost, training himself never to be angry, even about something that justly calls for anger.&#x2014; &#x2014; The life of angry persons is not worth living.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>4. One should always assume the habit of silence, and speak only on subjects of wisdom or on matters of vital importance to one&#x2019;s physical being. It has been reported of Rav, disciple of our sainted teacher Rabbi Judah the Prince, that he never engaged in idle talk, in which most people indulge. Even on one&#x2019;s vital needs one must not talk garrulously. In this connection the sages asserted: &#x201C;Whoever talks too much brings about sin.&#x201D; Moreover, it has been said: &#x201C;I have found nothing better for a person than silence&#x201D; (Ethics of the Fathers 1:17). So too, in discussing Torah and wisdom, a man&#x2019;s words should be few but full of meaning. Hence, the sages recommend, saying: &#x201C;One should always teach students concisely&#x201D; (Pesa&#x1E25;im 3b). But where words abound and the meaning is trivial, it is foolery, of which it has been said: &#x201C;The dream comes with much ado, and a fool&#x2019;s talking with many words&#x201D; (Ecclesiastes 5:2).</p>
<p>5. &#x201C;Silence is a fence to wisdom&#x201D; (Ethics of the Fathers 3:17). Hence one should not be hasty in replying, nor talk too much. A teacher should teach his pupils calmly and gently, without shouting and without verbosity. Solomon said: &#x201C;The words of the wise are heard in quiet&#x201D; (Ecclesiastes 9:17).</p>
<p>6. One must not make a habit of using flattering speech and make-believe. One must not say one thing and mean another, but like heart like face; we should express in words of mouth only what we have in mind. We must not deceive people, not even a heathen. For example, one must not sell to a heathen non-kosher meat as if it were kosher meat.&#x2014; &#x2014; One must not urge another to join him at a meal though aware that the invitation will not be accepted and he will not eat. One must not overwhelm his guest with offers, knowing that he will not accept. One must not deceive a guest and make him believe that casks of wine are opened in his honor, when they are indeed opened for sale. Even a single word of make-believe and deception is forbidden. We should ever aim at truthful speech, an upright spirit, and a pure heart, free from all evil and mischief.</p>
<p>7. One should not be addicted to jesting and mockery, nor should one be sad and mournful, but cheerful.&#x2014; &#x2014; One should not be greedy, hastening after riches, nor lazy and idle, but contented.&#x2014; &#x2014; One should not be quarrelsome, envious, lustful, nor strive for honor. The sages said: &#x201C;Envy, lust and vainglory shorten a man&#x2019;s life&#x201D; (Ethics of the Fathers 4:28). The gist of the matter is: one is to follow the middle course to the point that all his traits are centered between the extremes. Solomon referred to this when he said: &#x201C;Balance the course of your steps, so that all your ways be right&#x201D; (Proverbs 4:26).</p>
<h1>Chapter Three</h1>
<p>1. One may possibly say: &#x201C;Since envy and lust and the like are evil and shorten a man&#x2019;s life, I will keep clear of them excessively and withdraw myself to the other extreme.&#x201D; Such a person will not eat meat nor drink wine, nor marry nor live in a decent home, nor dress neatly, but will wear sackcloth and coarse wool like non-Jewish monks. This too is the wrong way, and must not be followed. Whoever takes this course is referred to as a sinner. The Torah says concerning the consecrated Nazirite, who was prohibited from using wine and cutting the hair: &#x201C;Atonement should be made for him for the sin he has committed against the soul&#x201D; (Numbers 6:11). The sages therefore asserted: &#x201C;If the Nazirite who only kept away from wine stands in need of atonement, how much more so one who deprives himself of all legitimate enjoyments&#x201D; (Ta&#x2018;anith 11a). Hence, the sages ordained that one should refrain merely from things that the Torah has prohibited, and must not bind himself by vows and oaths concerning the use of things permitted. They said: &#x201C;Are not the prohibitions in the Torah sufficient for you, that you are adding others for yourself?&#x201D; Included in this are those who make a habit of fasting; they are not following the right way; the sages prohibited tormenting oneself by fasting. Concerning these and similar excesses Solomon charged, saying: &#x201C;Be not over-good, be not over-wise; why expose yourself to trouble?&#x201D; (Ecclesiastes 7:16).</p>
<p>2. A man should direct his mind and all his actions exclusively to knowing God. Whether sitting, rising, or talking&#x2014; &#x2014; all must be bent in this direction. For example, when engaged in a business or in some wage-earning, one&#x2019;s aim should not be only to hoard money; instead, one is to do these things in order to obtain his physical needs: food, drink, shelter and matrimony. Also, when he eats and drinks&#x2014; &#x2014; he should not do this only to gratify his physical needs, so that he is likely to eat and drink only what is sweet to the palate&#x2014; &#x2014; but should have in his mind that he eats and drinks for the sole purpose of maintaining his body and its organs in good health. Hence he will not eat everything that the palate desires, like a dog or a donkey, but will use foods which do good to the body, whether sweet or bitter, avoiding those that are harmful to the body even though they are sweet to the palate.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Four</h1>
<p>1. Since by keeping the body in good health one follows the ways of God, for it is impossible to understand or know anything about the Creator when one is ill, it is a man&#x2019;s duty to shun whatever is harmful to the body and cultivate health-preserving habits. They are as follows: A man should not eat except when he is hungry, nor drink except when he is thirsty.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. He should not gorge himself, but leave the table before his appetite is fully appeased, using one-fourth less food than what would completely gratify him. During a meal he should drink only a little water, mixed with wine.&#x2014; &#x2014; He should not eat before taking a walk to stimulate the body, or engaging in manual work, or doing some other exercise. The gist of the matter is: Strenuous exercise should be taken every day in the morning till the body begins to get warm. Then he should rest a little until he is refreshed, and eat. If he takes a warm bath after the exercise, so much the better. Following the bath, he should wait a little and then eat.</p>
<p>3. One should sit or recline on the left side during a meal; he should not walk, ride, exert himself, shake, or take a walk till the food is digested. Anyone who takes a walk immediately after his meal, or exerts himself, subjects himself to various forms of disease.</p>
<p>4. The day and night consist of twenty-four hours. Eight hours of sleep, being one-third of the twenty-four hour day, is sufficient. These hours should be in the latter part of the night, so that the period between retirement and dawn will embrace eight hours, thus one will rise from his sleep before sunrise.</p>
<p>5. One should not sleep face downwards nor on his back, but lying on his side.&#x2014; &#x2014; One should not go to bed immediately after a meal, but wait three or four hours. One should not sleep during daytime.</p>
<p>14. Another rule has been laid down regarding the healthy condition of the body: As long as a person takes plenty of exercise, does not overeat, and keeps his bowels regulated, he will contract no illness even though he eats inferior food.</p>
<p>15. Anyone who sits around idle and takes no exercise will be subject to physical discomforts and failing strength, even though he eats wholesome food and takes care of himself in accordance with medical advice. Overeating is like deadly poison to the human body. Most illnesses which befall man arise either from bad food or from excessive eating of good food. Solomon, in his wisdom said: &#x201C;He who guards his mouth and his tongue keeps himself clear of trouble&#x201D; (Proverbs 21:23). That is to say, he who guards his mouth from bad food and excessive eating, and keeps his tongue from unnecessary talk.</p>
<h1>Chapter Five</h1>
<p>1. Just as the wise man is noted for his wisdom and his moral traits, by which he is distinguished from the rest of the people, so he ought to be noted for his proper behavior, for his food and drink,&#x2014; &#x2014; for the manner of his speaking, walking, dressing, and the management of his affairs and transactions. All these actions should be decent and altogether proper. For instance, a wise man must not be a glutton. He should eat, but never to excess, the kind of food that is likely to sustain his physical health. He should not be eager to fill his stomach, like those who stuff themselves with food and drink till their bellies swell.&#x2014; &#x2014; They are the men who say: &#x201C;Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die&#x201D; (Isaiah 22:13). This manner of eating belongs to evil men.&#x2014; &#x2014; The wise man, on the other hand, eats one or two dishes sparingly, just enough to keep alive. Solomon alluded to this when he said: &#x201C;The righteous man eats enough to satisfy his appetite&#x201D; (Proverbs 13:25).</p>
<p>2. When the wise man eats the little food he properly needs, he should partake of it at home only, at his own table. He should not eat in a store or in the street, except when it is strictly necessary, so as not to incur popular contempt.</p>
<p>7. A wise man does not shout and scream when he speaks, but talks gently with all people and never raises his voice unduly. He gives everyone a friendly greeting, judges all men favorably, loves peace and strives for it, so that all are kindly disposed toward him. He dwells on the merits of his fellow man, without ever disparaging him. If he finds that his words are helpful and heeded, he speaks; otherwise, he keeps quiet. For example, he does not attempt to pacify his neighbor at the moment the latter has lost his temper, but waits till he has calmed down.&#x2014; &#x2014; When his neighbor is in disgrace, he looks away and does not show himself to him. He never misrepresents; he neither makes overstatements nor understatements, unless a matter of peace is involved. In brief, he only talks about wisdom and kindliness.</p>
<p>8. A wise man should not walk haughtily, with head held high, with mincing steps after the fashion of women, or arrogant men, as it is written: &#x201C;They mince along as they walk, tinkling with their feet&#x201D; (Isaiah 3:16). Nor should he run about in the street like a madman; nor should he stoop like a hunchback. The manner of a man&#x2019;s walking shows whether he is wise and sensible or foolish and ignorant. Solomon, in his wisdom, expressed this thought: &#x201C;Even when a fool walks on the road, he lacks sense and says to everyone that he is a fool&#x201D; (Ecclessiastes 10:3). He publicly advertizes himself as a fool.</p>
<p>9. A wise man should dress neatly, and should not wear clothes stained with grease and dirt. He should not dress flashily to attract attention nor shabbily so as to suffer disrespect. His garments should be modest and appropriate.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>10. A wise man manages his affairs judiciously. He eats, drinks and supports his family according to his wealth and success. The sages recommend that one should spend less than his means on food, within his means on clothes, and more than his means on his wife and children (&#x1E24;ullin 84b).</p>
<p>11. Men of intelligence first acquire a livelihood, then a home, and then they marry. Fools, on the other hand, marry first, acquire a home if they can afford it, and then seek a trade, or else they appeal to charity.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>13. A wise man is honest in all his transactions. When he says &#x201C;no&#x201D; he means no, and when he says &#x201C;yes&#x201D; he means yes.&#x2014; &#x2014; He does not encroach on another man&#x2019;s occupation, and never mistreats anyone. In short, he prefers rather to be among the offended than among the offenders. Isaiah refers to a man who acts in this manner: &#x201C;He said to me: You are my servant, Israel, in whom I glory&#x201D; (49:3).</p>
<h1>Chapter Six</h1>
<p>1. Man&#x2019;s natural instinct is to think and act like his friends and colleagues, and to follow the custom of his fellow countrymen. One should therefore associate with good and wise men that he may learn their practices, and shun evil men who walk in the dark that he may not learn their ways. Solomon alluded to this: &#x201C;He who walks with wise men becomes wise, but the companion of fools will suffer harm&#x201D; (Proverbs 13:20).</p>
<p>2. According to a biblical positive command, we should attach ourselves to wise men and their disciples in order to learn from their example, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall hold fast to him&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 10:20). But can a human being hold fast to the <italic>Shekhinah?</italic> The sages explained this precept to mean: attach yourself to the wise and their disciples. A man should therefore strive to win a scholar&#x2019;s daughter for a wife, and marry off his daughter to a scholar. He should eat and drink in the company of scholars, do business with them, and associate with them in all respects; for the Torah repeats this precept, emphasizing &#x201C;holding fast to him&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 11:22). So too, our sages recommended and said: &#x201C;Sit at their feet in the dust, and drink in their words thirstingly&#x201D; (Ethics of the Fathers 1:4).</p>
<p>3. Duty demands of every person to love his fellow man as himself, for it is written: &#x201C;You shall love your neighbor as yourself&#x201D; (Leviticus 19:18). Hence, we must speak of him in terms of praise and be careful of his property, just as one desires to preserve his own reputation and safeguard his own property. &#x201C;Whoever glorifies himself by humiliating someone else has no share in the future world&#x201D; (Yerushalmi &#x1E24;agigah 2:1).</p>
<p>6. When a man sins against another, the offended person should not hate the offender and keep quiet, as it is told about evildoers: &#x201C;Absalom said not a word to Amnon, good or bad, for Absalom hated Amnon&#x201D; (II Samuel 13:22). But it is his duty to let him know and say to him: &#x201C;Why did you do this to me? Why did you sin against me in this matter?&#x201D; For it is written: &#x201C;You must reprove your fellow man&#x201D; (Leviticus 19:17). If he has repented and asked for forgiveness, he should be forgiven. The person who so forgives must not be cruel, as it is written: &#x201C;Abraham prayed to God&#x201D; [for the man who wronged him] (Genesis 20:17).</p>
<p>7. If one has noticed that a person has committed a sin or followed the wrong path, duty demands that he should restore him to the right path by pointing out to him that he is doing wrong to himself by his bad behavior.&#x2014; &#x2014; He should speak to him gently and tenderly, informing him that it is only for his own good that he is telling him this.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>8. &#x2014; &#x2014; The sages declared: &#x201C;Whoever shames a fellow man in public has no share in the future world&#x201D; (Bava Metsia 59a). One should therefore be careful not to offend anybody in public, whether young or old. One must not call a person by a name of which he feels ashamed, nor tell in his presence anything that embarrasses him.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>9. If an offended person is unwilling to criticize or say anything to the offender, who happens to be grossly vulgar or mentally disturbed, and heartily forgives him without resenting or rebuking him, he performs a saintly deed. The Torah only objects to bearing a grudge.</p>
<p>10. One ought to be especially cautious when dealing with orphans and widows, because they are particularly depressed and low-spirited, even though they may be wealthy. We are warned even with respect to the widow and orphans of a king, for it is written: &#x201C;You shall not mistreat any widow or orphan&#x201D; (Exodus 22:21). How should we behave toward them? One should address them with tender words only and be unfailingly courteous with them. One must not cause them pain physically through hard work or emotionally through harsh words. One should take greater care of their property than one&#x2019;s own. Whoever irritates or vexes them, hurts their feelings or tyranizes over them, or causes them financial loss, violates a prohibition; still more so, if one strikes them or curses them.&#x2014; &#x2014; There is no distinction between orphans bereft of either father or mother. Till when are they called orphans in this respect? Till the time when they are in no need of an adult person on whom to depend, who should bring them up and take care of them. When one of them can adequately care for himself like all other grown people, he is no longer considered an orphan.</p>
<h1>Chapter Seven</h1>
<p>1. Whoever acts like a spy against his neighbor violates a prohibition, for it is written: &#x201C;You shall not go about spreading slander among your people&#x201D; (Leviticus 19:16). And although this does not entail flogging as a punishment, it is a flagrant offense which has brought about the death of many Jewish individuals. For this reason, the same verse includes the prohibition: &#x201C;You shall not stand by idly when your neighbor&#x2019;s life is at stake.&#x201D; Consider, for example, what happened on account of Doeg the Edomite (I Samuel 22:6-19).</p>
<p>2. Who is a talebearer? One who carries gossip, going about from person to person and telling: &#x201C;So-and-so said this; I have heard so-and-so about so-and-so.&#x201D; Even though he tells the truth, he ruins the world. There is a still worse iniquity that comes within this prohibition, namely: the evil tongue of the scandal-monger who speaks disparagingly of his fellow man, even if he tells the truth. But the one who disparages his neighbor by telling a lie is called a slanderer.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>5. It makes no difference whether a man deals out gossip in the presence or the absence of the party concerned. Anyone who tells things that, if transmitted from person to person, are likely to cause physical or financial harm to a fellow man, or merely to distress or frighten him, is guilty of slander.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>6. All these are scandalmongers in whose neighborhood it is forbidden to live; it is all the more forbidden to be in their company and hear their talk. The sentence was confirmed and sealed against our forefathers in the wilderness only for slandering.</p>
<p>7. He who takes revenge violates a transgression, for it is written: &#x201C;You shall take no revenge&#x201D; (Leviticus 19:18). And although this offense is not punishable with lashes, it stems nevertheless from an exceedingly bad disposition. One should rather be forebearing with regard to all worldly things which, in the opinion of the wise, are sheer vanity and nothingness; they are not worthy of vengeance. What is vengeance? If a person says to another: &#x201C;Lend me your spade,&#x201D; and he replies: &#x201C;I will not lend it to you.&#x201D; The next day, the second party has to ask a similar favor from the first and says to him: &#x201C;Lend me your spade,&#x201D; and the other replies: &#x201C;I will not lend it to you, just as you did not lend me your spade when I asked it of you.&#x201D; This means taking revenge. He should rather give it to him cheerfully when he comes to ask for it, and must not repay him for his mistreatment.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>8. So too, whoever bears a grudge against a fellow Israelite violates a prohibition, for it is written: &#x201C;You shall not bear a grudge&#x201D; (Leviticus 19:18). What is meant by <italic>bearing a grudge?</italic> A said to B: &#x201C;Rent this house to me,&#x201D; or: &#x201C;Lend me this ox.&#x201D; B refused. After some time, B comes to A to borrow or hire something. A replies: &#x201C;Here it is; I am lending it to you; I am not like you; I will not treat you as you treated me.&#x201D; Whoever acts like this transgresses the command: &#x201C;You shall not bear a grudge.&#x201D; One should blot the thing out of his mind and not cherish a grudge. For as long as he cherishes a resentment and keeps recalling it, he may come to avenge himself. For this reason, the Torah objects to bearing a grudge, that one may obliterate the wrong from his mind and remember it no more. This is the right way of behavior, whereby civilization and social intercourse are made possible.</p>

<chapter>
<title>TORAH STUDY</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. Women, slaves and minors are exempt from the duty of Torah study. It is, however, the father&#x2019;s duty to teach his young son Torah, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall teach them to your children, speaking of them&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 11:19). A woman is under no obligation to teach her son, since the duty of teaching applies only to one whose duty it is to learn.</p>
<p>2. Just as it is a man&#x2019;s duty to teach his son, so it is his duty to teach his grandson, as it is written: &#x201C;Make them known to your children and your children&#x2019;s children&#x201D; (4:9). This obligation does not refer only to one&#x2019;s son and grandson, but it is a duty resting upon every Jewish scholar to teach all those who seek to be his students, even though they are not hisown children, for it is written: &#x201C;You shall teach them diligently to your children&#x201D; (6:7). On traditional authority, the term &#x201C;your children&#x201D; in this verse has been interpreted to mean <italic>your pupils</italic>, since pupils are likewise called <italic>children</italic>, for it is written: &#x201C;And the sons of the prophets came out&#x201D; (II Kings 2:3). But if so, why then has a man&#x2019;s duty been specifically stated in the Torah with regard to his own son and grandson? To indicate that his son has priority over his grandson, and his grandson over the son of another person.</p>
<p>6. When should a father begin to teach his son Torah? As soon as the child begins to talk, he should teach him the biblical verses: &#x201C;The Torah which Moses handed down to us&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 33:4) and &#x201C;Hear, O Israel&#x201D; (6:4). Later on, he should teach him gradually more and more verses at a time, till he reaches the age of six or seven; it all depends on the health condition of the child; he should then take him to a teacher of young children.</p>
<p>7. If it is the custom of the country for a children&#x2019;s teacher to receive a fee, the father should pay the fee. He is under an obligation to teach his son even when he has to pay for his tuition till he has learned to read the entire written Torah. Where it is customary to charge a fee for teaching the written Torah, it is permissible to charge a fee for such instruction. It is forbidden, however, to teach the Oral Torah for payment, for it is written: &#x201C;Behold, I have taught you laws and rules as the Lord my God has commanded me&#x201D; (4:5). Moses, in other words, said: &#x201C;Just as I received instruction from God freely, you have received instruction from me freely. And you, too, when teaching in future generations, give instruction freely, as you have learned from me.&#x201D; If, however, he cannot find someone to teach him freely, he should get instruction for a fee, as it is written: &#x201C;Buy truth&#x201D; (Proverbs 23:23). One might suppose that he, in turn, will be permitted to teach others for a fee, but the same biblical text adds: &#x201C;Do not sell it.&#x201D; Hence you infer that he is not permitted to teach for a fee even though his teacher taught <italic>him</italic> for a fee.</p>
<p>8. Every Jew is required to study Torah, whether poor or rich, healthy or ailing, young or old and feeble. Even a beggar who goes from door to door, and a man who has a wife and children to support, must devote time to Torah day and night, for it is written: &#x201C;You shall study it day and night&#x201D; (Joshua 1:8).</p>
<p>9. Some of the great sages of Israel were wood-cutters and water-carriers, while others were blind. Nevertheless they studied Torah day and night, and are included among those who have transmitted the tradition in the direct line from Moses.</p>
<p>10. Until when is one required to study Torah? Until the day of his death, for it is written: &#x201C;Lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 4:9). One keeps forgetting at any time he fails to study.</p>
<h1>Chapter Two</h1>
<p>1. Elementary teachers are appointed in each province, district and town. If a town is without an elementary school for children, its inhabitants are placed under a ban till they engage teachers for the young children. If they have failed to do so, the town is undone; for the world is maintained only by the breath of school children.</p>
<p>2. Children should be sent to school at the age of six or seven, according to the physical strength and development of the child. But no child should be entered under six years of age.&#x2014; &#x2014; The education of the young must not be interrupted even for the purpose of rebuilding the Temple.</p>
<p>3. An elementary teacher who leaves the children and goes out, or does other work with them, or teaches them sluggishly, falls under the category referred to by Jeremiah: &#x201C;Cursed is he who does the work of the Lord with slackness&#x201D; (48:10). It is improper, therefore, to engage a teacher unless he is a person of reverence and skilled in reading and in grammar.</p>
<p>5. Twenty-five children may be taught by one teacher. If there are more than twenty-five pupils, but fewer than forty, an assistant should be engaged to help with the instruction. If there are more than forty, two elementary teachers are appointed.</p>
<p>6. The child is transferred from one teacher to another who is more competent in both Bible and grammar.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Three</h1>
<p>1. The people of Israel were given three crowns: the crown of Torah, the crown of priesthood, and the crown of royalty. Aaron acquired the crown of priesthood, as it is written: &#x201C;It shall be to him, and to his descendants after him, the covenant of a perpetual priesthood&#x201D; (Numbers 25:13). David acquired the crown of royalty, as it is written: &#x201C;His line shall endure forever, his throne lasting like the sun before me&#x201D; (Psalm 89:37). The crown of Torah, however, is designed for all Israel, for it is written: &#x201C;The Torah which Moses handed down to us is the heritage of the community of Jacob&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 33:4). Whoever desires it may come and get it.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. The sages said: &#x201C;A scholar, even if he is the son of unmarried parents, has priority over an ignorant high priest, for it is written: &#x201C;She is more precious than jewels&#x201D; (Proverbs 3:15); that is, more than the bejeweled high priest who entered the innermost sanctuary on <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>.</p>
<p>3. None of all precepts is equal in importance to Torah study; nay, Torah study excels all the precepts, for study leads to practice. Therefore, study has priority over practice in every respect.</p>
<p>4. Where one can either perform a specific precept or study Torah, he must not interrupt his study if the precept can be fulfilled by somebody else. Otherwise, let him first perform the <italic>mitzvah</italic> and then resume his study.</p>
<p>6. Anyone who has made up his mind to perform this <italic>mitzvah</italic> properly, and be invested with the crown of Torah, must not divert his attention to other objectives. He must not intend to acquire Torah, riches and glory at the same time. &#x201C;This is the way of Torah study: eat bread with salt, drink water by measure, sleep on the bare ground, and live a life of hardship while you toil in the Torah&#x201D; (Ethics of the Fathers 6:4).&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>9. The words of the Torah have been compared to water, as it is written: &#x201C;Oh, every one who thirsts, come to the waters&#x201D; (Isaiah 55:1). This means to say that just as water does not accumulate on a slope but flows away and gathers in a pond, so the words of the Torah are not to be found in the arrogant and the haughty but only in one who is contrite and humble, who sits at the feet of the wise in the dust and removes from his heart lusts and temporal pleasures, doing some work daily, enough to provide for his needs&#x2014;if he would otherwise have nothing to eat&#x2014;and devotes the rest of the day and night to the study of Torah.</p>
<p>10. Anyone, however, who makes up his mind to study Torah and not work but live on charity profanes the name of God, disgraces the Torah, obscures the light of religion, causes harm to himself, and deprives himself of life in the future world; for it is forbidden to derive temporal advantage from the words of the Torah. The sages said: &#x201C;Whoever makes selfish use of the teachings of the Torah takes his own life.&#x201D; They further told us: &#x201C;Do not make of them a crown wherewith to magnify yourself, nor a spade wherewith to dig.&#x201D; They urged us strongly moreover: &#x201C;Love work, and hate arrogance. All Torah study which is not combined with some work must at length fail and occasion sin&#x201D; (Ethics of the Fathers). The end of such a person will be that he will rob his fellow men.</p>
<p>11. Anyone who maintains himself by the work of his hands possesses a great virtue, a virtue of the early saints, whereby he will attain all the glory and happiness of both this and the future world, as it is written: &#x201C;When you eat the fruit of the labor of your hands, you shall be happy and it shall be well with you&#x201D; (Psalm 128:2). <italic>You shall be happy</italic> in this world, <italic>and it shall be well with you</italic> in the future world, which will be altogether good.</p>
<p>12. Knowledge of the Torah cannot be sustained by one who is indolent, nor can it be acquired by those who combine study with luxurious living and feasting; it can be attained only by one who renounces the world for Torah, and regularly submits to physical discomfort, giving no sleep to his eyes, nor slumber to his eyelids.&#x2014; &#x2014; Whoever studies audibly retains his learning, but one who reads silently forgets speedily.</p>
<p>13. Although it is a religious duty to study day and night, most of a person&#x2019;s knowledge is gained only during night-time.&#x2014; &#x2014; Whoever studies Torah at night, a touch of grace lights his face at daytime.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Four</h1>
<p>2. How should a class be taught? The teacher sits at the head of the table and the pupils surround him as a wreath, so that all can see the teacher and hear what he says. The teacher must not sit on a chair while his pupils sit on the ground; either they all sit on the floor or they all occupy chairs. Originally, the teacher used to sit while the pupils were standing. Ever since the time preceding the destruction of the Second Temple, it has been a general custom to teach the pupils as they are seated.</p>
<p>4. If a teacher has taught a subject and the pupils failed to understand it, he must not be angry with them nor get excited, but should review the lesson with them many times until they finally grasp it. Neither should a pupil say <italic>I understand</italic> when he does not, but should keep on asking questions repeatedly. If his teacher gets angry and excited on account of him, he should say to him: &#x201C;Teacher, this is the Torah&#x0021; I must study it, even though my capacity is limited.&#x201D;</p>
<p>5. A student must not feel ashamed on account of his colleagues who have apprehended a subject at once, or soon after it was taught a second time, while it has taken him many times to grasp it. If he were to feel embarrassment because of this, he would be attending school without learning anything. For this reason, the early sages declared: &#x201C;The bashful cannot learn, nor can the quick-tempered teach&#x201D; (Ethics of the Fathers 2:5). This applies only to a case where the students have failed to understand a subject because of its depth or because of their limited capacity. If, however, the teacher is convinced that they are too lazy to study Torah, and that they have not grasped the subject on account of their indolence, he must show his anger, shaming them with words, in order to rouse them. With regard to this, the sages have declared: &#x201C;Rebuke and overawe the students.&#x201D; Accordingly, it is improper for a teacher to act frivolously in front of his pupils; he should not jest in their presence, nor eat and drink with them, so that they should revere him and learn from him speedily.</p>
<p>6. A teacher should not be asked any questions immediately upon his coming into the classroom, until he gets clear-minded. Nor should a student ask a question when he comes in until he sits down and is at ease. Two students should not ask questions at the same time. The teacher should not be asked questions about a different subject, but only about the subject in which they are engaged, so that he should not get embarrassed.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>9. We must not sleep in the house of learning.&#x2014; &#x2014; We should discuss only Torah topics in the house of learning. Even if one has sneezed, we must not wish him <italic>good health</italic> inside the house of learning.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Five</h1>
<p>1. Just as a person is commanded to honor and revere his father, so it is his duty to honor and revere his teacher, even more than his father; for his father has secured for him life in this world, while the teacher who has taught him wisdom secures for him life in the future world.&#x2014; &#x2014; There is no honor higher than that which is due to the teacher, no reverence more profound than that which should be bestowed on him. The sages said: &#x201C;The reverence for your teacher should be like the reverence for Heaven&#x201D; (4:12).&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>12. Just as the pupils are required to honor the teacher, so the teacher ought to be courteous and friendly toward his pupils. The sages said: &#x201C;Let the honor of your student be as dear to you as your own&#x201D; (Ethics of the Fathers 4:15). One should be interested in his pupils and love them, for they are the spiritual children who give pleasure in this world and in the future world.</p>
<p>13. Students increase the teacher&#x2019;s wisdom and broaden his mind. The sages said: &#x201C;I have learned much from my teachers, even more from my colleagues, but I have learned the most from my students.&#x201D; Even as a small piece of wood kindles a large log, so a pupil of small attainments sharpens the mind of his teacher, to the point that he elicits glorious wisdom by the questions he presents.</p>
<h1>Chapter Six</h1>
<p>1. It is a duty to treat every scholar with respect, even though he is not one&#x2019;s teacher, for it is written: &#x201C;You shall stand up in the presence of the aged, and show respect for the old&#x201D; (Leviticus 19:33). The word <italic>zaken</italic> (old) refers here to one who has acquired wisdom. When are we required to stand up in his presence? From the moment he reaches one within six feet till he has passed alongside him.</p>
<p>3. It is improper for a scholar to put the people to the trouble of standing up in his presence by passing before them deliberately. He should rather use a shorter route, tending to avoid notice, so that none will have to rise before him. The sages were in the habit of using circuitous bypaths, where those who knew them were not likely to be found, so as not to trouble them.</p>
<p>9. We should stand up before a very old man even if he is not a scholar. Even a scholar who Is young should rise before a very old man. He is not obliged, however, to rise to his full height but as much as is required to show him respect. Even a non-Jewish old man should be shown respect in words and be given a hand to support him, for it is written: &#x201C;You shall stand up in the presence of the aged,&#x201D; which implies <italic>every</italic> old man.</p>
<p>10. Scholars are not called upon to go out themselves to take part with the rest of the community in such things as building and digging for the state, so as not to lose the respect of the common people. Nor are they assessed for the cost of building the walls, repairing the gates, paying the wages of the watchmen, and the like, or making a gift to the king. Nor are they required to pay a tax, whether it is assessed collectively on all the inhabitants of the town or individually.&#x2014; &#x2014; So too, if a scholar has goods for sale, he should be permitted to dispose of them first; no one in the market should be given the opportunity of selling till the scholar has first sold his merchandise. Also, if he has a lawsuit and is standing among many litigants, his case is taken first and, during the hearing, he is seated.</p>
<p>11. It is a grave sin to scorn the scholars or hate them. Jerusalem was destroyed only when its scholars were treated with contempt, as it is written: &#x201C;They mocked God&#x2019;s messengers, despised his words, and derided his prophets&#x201D; (II Chronicles 36:16); that is to say, they despised those who taught his words. Similarly, when the Torah says: &#x201C;If you spurn my laws&#x201D; (Leviticus 26:15), it means: if you spurn the teachers of my laws. Whoever despises eminent scholars has no share in the future world, &#x201C;for he has despised the word of the Lord&#x201D; (Numbers 15:31).</p>

<chapter>
<title>IDOLATRY AND HEATHENISM</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. In the days of Enosh, the people fell into gross error, and senseless was the counsel of the wise men of that generation. Enosh himself was among those who committed the error. Their error was this: They said that in view of the fact that God created the stars and celestial spheres to guide the world, setting them on high and honoring them, and they are his ministering servants, they deserve to be praised, glorified and honored. It is the will of God, blessed be he, that we glorify and honor anyone he has glorified and honored, just as a king desires that respect be shown those who stand and minister before him, since this is an indirect way of honoring the king himself. When this notion entered their mind, they began to build temples in honor of the stars and offered sacrifices to them, praising and glorifying them in speech and prostrating themselves before them, in order to win the favor of the Creator, according to their wrong thinking.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. In the course of time, false prophets arose among men and asserted that God had expressly commanded them: Worship that particular star, or all the stars; offer such and such sacrifices and libations to it; erect a temple for it; draw a figure of it, that all the people may worship it&#x2014; &#x2014; women, children, and the rest of the folk.&#x2014; &#x2014; So they began to carve figures in the temples, under the trees, on the mountain-tops and the hills. They would assemble, worship the idols, and tell all the people that this particular figure was able to do good and evil, and that it was proper to worship it and fear it.&#x2014; &#x2014; Other impostors then sprang up and declared that the star itself, or the celestial sphere or the angel, spoke with them and said to them: &#x201C;Worship me in such and such fashion,&#x201D; informing them how to perform the rite, &#x201C;and do this and refrain from doing that.&#x201D; Gradually the custom of worshiping idols, and sacrificing to them, according to varied rites spread throughout the world. As time passed on, the revered name of God vanished from the lips and minds of all human beings and they knew him no more. All the common people, and the women and the children, thus knew only the idols of wood or stone and the temple edifice, in which they had been trained from their childhood to worship them and invoke their name.&#x2014; &#x2014; The world moved on in this manner until our father Abraham was born, the lofty pillar of the world.</p>
<p>3. As soon as this mighty champion was weaned, he began to think by day and by night, though still an infant, wondering how it was possible that this sphere should keep moving continually if there was no one to guide it. Who is it that causes it to revolve? For it cannot be that it has caused itself to revolve&#x0021; He had no teacher, no one to instruct him in anything. He was plunged in Chaldean Ur among silly idolaters. His father and mother and the entire population were idolaters, and he worshiped with them. But his mind was busily meditating and reflecting until he had attained the way of truth, apprehended the correct line of thought and knew that there is One God, that he guides the celestial sphere and has created everything, and that there is no God beside him in the entire universe.&#x2014; &#x2014; Abraham was forty years old when he acknowledged his Creator. As soon as he attained this knowledge, he began to raise objections against the inhabitants of Ur and to argue with them, telling them: &#x201C;The course you are following is not the way of truth.&#x201D; He broke the idols and began to instruct the people that it was improper to worship anyone except the God of the universe. To him alone it is right to bow down and offer sacrifices and libations, so that all human beings of the future may know him. Also, it is right to destroy and shatter all the idols, so that the people may not be misled like those who imagined that there was no god but these idols. When he had prevailed over them with his arguments, the king sought to slay him; but he was miraculously saved, and he left for Haran. There he began to proclaim to the entire world boldly, informing the people that the entire universe had only one Creator, and that him alone it was right to worship. He went from city to city and from kingdom to kingdom, calling and assembling the people until he arrived in the land of Canaan proclaiming, as it is written: &#x201C;There he proclaimed the name of the Lord God of the universe&#x201D; (Genesis 21:33). When the people flocked to him, asking him concerning his assertions, he informed everyone according to his intelligence so as to restore him to the path of truth. Thus many thousands joined him; they were known as the men of the house of Abraham (Genesis 17:27). He implanted in their hearts this great principle of faith, about which he wrote tracts, and taught it to his son Isaac, who in turn kept instructing and exhorting others. Isaac conveyed it to Jacob, whom he ordained to teach the faith. He too kept teaching and exhorting all who joined him. Jacob instructed all his sons, setting apart Levi whom he appointed as head of an academy to teach the way of God and to observe the charge of Abraham. He charged his sons to appoint instructors from the tribe of Levi in uninterrupted succession, that the traditional lore might not be forgotten. And so it went on increasingly among the descendants of Jacob and their adherents until they became a nation knowing the Lord. The people of Israel stayed a long time in Egypt; they relapsed, learning the practices of their neighbors and worshiping idols, with the exception of the tribe of Levi that adhered to the heritage of the patriarchs. The tribe of Levi never worshiped idols. The principle of faith which Abraham had planted was almost uprooted, with the relapse of Jacob&#x2019;s descendants into the then popular idolatry. But owing to God&#x2019;s love for us, and because he kept his solemn promise to Abraham our father, he appointed Moses to be the teacher of all the prophets and sent him to us. When Moses had begun to function as prophet, the Lord chose Israel as his heritage and adorned them with precepts, showing them the way of worshiping him, and how to treat idolatry and those who stray after it.</p>
<h1>Chapter Five</h1>
<p>1. He who entices a Jewish man or woman to practise idolatry is stoned, even though neither the enticed nor the enticer worshiped an idol; he dies because he gave instruction to worship an idol.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. He who entices the majority of the townspeople is a seducer and not an enticer. If the seducer of the city&#x2019;s majority was a prophet, he is stoned to death. The seduced are treated as individuals and not as inhabitants of a seduced city, unless there were at least two seducers.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>7. It is forbidden to engage in a debate with one who prophesies in the name of idolatry, and he should not be asked for signs and wonders. If he has done so on his own initiative, he should be completely ignored without thinking about him at all. If anyone considers such signs as possibly true, he breaks a negative command, for it is written: &#x201C;Do not heed the words of that prophet&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 13:4).&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Six</h1>
<p>1. &#x2014; &#x2014; How does the necromancer pretend to reveal the future by communicating with the spirits of the dead? He stands up and burns a certain kind of incense while swinging a myrtle twig which he holds in his hand. He whispers words known to the mediums until the inquiring person imagines that someone is talking to him, responding to what he has asked in extremely low tones from beneath the ground, inaudible but conceived by imagination. Or else, the medium takes a skull of a corpse, offers incense to it, pretending to reveal the future by this practice, until a very low sound emerges from under his armpit, answering him. All that is necromancy, the practice of which is punishable by stoning.</p>
<p>2. How does the wizard practise his art? He puts a bone of a bird called <italic>yaddua</italic> in his mouth, offers up incense, and performs other acts, until he falls like an epileptic and talks of things to come. All these things are forms of idolatry.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>6. The stone pillar which the Torah has forbidden is a structure where they all gather, even to worship God; such was the manner of idolatry; hence it is written: &#x201C;You shall not set up a stone pillar&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 16:22). Anyone who sets up a stone pillar is punished with [39] lashes. The same applies to the figured stone mentioned in the Torah. Anyone who bows down on it, even to worship God, is flogged, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall not place a figured stone in your land to worship upon it&#x201D; (Leviticus 26:1). It was an idolatrous custom to place a stone in front of an idol and bow down on it; hence, this must not be done in worshiping the Lord. One is not flogged, however, unless he stretches his hands and feet on the stone so that he lies completely on it. This is the prostration mentioned in the Torah.</p>
<p>7. This law applies everywhere except in the Temple, where it is permitted to bow down upon the stones, for it is written &#x201C;in your land,&#x201D; meaning: you must not bow down on the stones in your land, but you are permitted to do so on the polished stones in the Temple. Hence, it has been a Jewish custom to spread mats, or any kind of straw, over the stone floors in the synagogues, to form a partition between the faces and the stones.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Eleven</h1>
<p>8. What is a soothsayer? This term refers to those who foretell events by astrological observations, declaring that a certain day is favorable while another is unfavorable; a certain day is suited for doing a certain type of work; a certain year or month is unfavorable for a particular thing.</p>
<p>9. It is forbidden to practise astrology, even if one has done nothing beyond telling the lies which the ignorant imagine to be true and wise assertions. Anyone whose action is influenced by astrology, arranging his work or trip to take place at the time set by stargazers, is punished with lashes, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall not practise soothsaying&#x201D; (Leviticus 19:26). The same applies to anyone who deludes by optical deception, pretending in the presence of the viewers to have done something extraordinary which in reality he has not done; he belongs to the category of soothsayer, and is punished with lashes.</p>
<p>10. Who is a charmer? One who uses words that do not belong to any spoken tongue and have no meaning, supposing foolishly that those utterances are helpful. They go as far as declaring that if anyone utters certain phrases over a snake or scorpion, it turns harmless; and if certain words are used over a human being, he will not be hurt.&#x2014; &#x2014; All those strange and ugly sounds and names cannot hurt nor help.</p>
<p>11. If one was stung by a scorpion or snake, it is permitted to whisper a charm over the affected spot even on the Sabbath, in order to set his mind at case and reassure him, even though it is absolutely of no use. Since he is in danger, it has been permitted lest he may become hopelessly confused.</p>
<p>12. Anyone who whispers a charm over a wound and reads a verse from the Torah, or one who recites a biblical verse over a child lest he is terrified, or one who places a <italic>Sefer Torah</italic> or <italic>tefillin</italic> over an infant to enable him to sleep, are not only included in the category of sorcerers and charmers, but are included among those who repudiate the Torah. They use the words of the Torah as a physical cure, whereas they are exclusively a cure for the soul, as it is written: &#x201C;They will be life to your soul&#x201D; (Proverbs 3:22). On the other hand, one who is enjoying good health is permitted to recite biblical verses, or a psalm, that he may be shielded and saved from affliction and damage by virtue of the reading.</p>
<p>13. Who is a communicator with the dead? One who starves himself and spends the night in a cemetery so that a dead person may appear in a dream and inform him about something he has inquired. Others put on special garments and utter words, offering a particular incense, and sleep alone, so that a certain dead individual may come and converse with him in a dream. In brief, whoever does anything to induce a dead person to appear and give him information, is punished with lashes, as it is written: &#x201C;There must not be among you anyone who burns his son or daughter, or who practises divination or soothsaying &#x2026; or an inquirer of the dead&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 18:10-11).</p>
<p>15. The sorcerer incurs the penalty of stoning, provided he actually practised witchcraft. The juggler, however, who practises optical deception, making it appear that he did something which he did not do, receives punishment for disobedience.</p>
<p>16. All these practices are grossly deceptive, used by the ancient idolaters to mislead the nations of the world that they might follow them. It is improper for Jewish people who are remarkably clever to be attracted by such senseless things, to suppose that they are of some use, as it is written: &#x201C;There is no divination in Jacob, no witchcraft in Israel&#x201D; (Numbers 23:23). &#x201C;These nations that you are about to dispossess listen to soothsayers and wizards, but not you&#x2026;&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 18:14). Whoever believes in these and similar things, thinking to himself that they are scientifically true and only forbidden by the Torah is nothing but an ignorant fool, included among immature women and children. Cultured, intellectual people, however, know authoritatively that all these practices which the Torah has forbidden are not scientific but inane and senseless. Ignorant people have been attracted by them, for whose sake they have abandoned the ways of truth. For this reason, the Torah exhorts us in forbidding these inanities, saying: &#x201C;You shall be wholehearted with the Lord your God&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 18:13).</p>
<h1>Chapter Twelve</h1>
<p>11. Tattoing, spoken of in the Torah (Leviticus 19:28), consists in gashing the flesh and filling up the gash with pigment, ink or other dyes which leave a lasting mark. This was a custom among the pagans who marked themselves for idolatry, meaning that the tattoed was a slave sold and marked for its service. As soon as one inserts coloring matter within the incision he has made in any part of the body of a man or woman he incurs the punishment of lashes.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>13. <italic>Gedidah</italic> (gashing) and <italic>seritah</italic> (producing incisions) are identical. The pagans used to make gashes in their flesh to express grief for their dead, and injure themselves for the sake of idolatry, as it is written: &#x201C;They gashed themselves as was their practice&#x201D; (I Kings 18:28). This too was forbidden by the Torah, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall not gash yourselves&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 14:1).&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>REPENTANCE</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. If a person has transgressed any one of the Torah precepts, affirmative or negative, willfully or unintentionally, he must confess before God, blessed be he, when repenting and turning away from his sin; for it is written: &#x201C;If a man or woman commits any of the sins into which men fall &#x2026; they must confess their sinful act&#x201D; (Numbers 5:6-7); this means verbal confession.&#x2014; &#x2014; How does one confess? He says: &#x201C;O Lord, I have sinned, I have done evil, I have rebelled against thee and have done this&#x2026; I regret now and am ashamed of my acts; I will never do it again.&#x201D; This represents the essential part of confession. The more anyone confesses the more praise he deserves. Similarly, those who have to bring sin-offerings, or guilt-offerings, are not forgiven through those offerings for sins committed unintentionally or willfully unless they repent and confess, as it is written: &#x201C;He must confess the sin he has committed&#x201D; (Leviticus 5:5). So too, those sentenced to death by the court and those sentenced to lashes are not forgiven through death or lashes unless they repent and confess. Furthermore, one who has injured a person or damaged his property, even though he pays what he owes him, is not pardoned unless he confesses and resolves never to commit such an offense again, as it is written: &#x201C;If a man or woman commits any of the sins&#x2026;&#x201D; (Numbers 5:6).</p>
<p>3. At this time, when the Temple no longer exists, and we have no atonement altar, there is nothing left but repentance. Repentance atones for all transgressions. Even if a man was wicked throughout his life and repented at the end, we must not mention anything about his wickedness to him, as it is written: &#x201C;A wicked man&#x2019;s wickedness shall not bring about his downfall when he gives up his wickedness&#x201D; (Ezekiel 33:12). <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> itself atones for those who repent, as it is written: &#x201C;Atonement shall be made for you on this day&#x201D; (Leviticus 16:30).</p>
<h1>Chapter Two</h1>
<p>1. Perfect repentance is where an opportunity presents itself to the offender for repeating the offense and he refrains from committing it because of his repentance and not out of fear or physical inability.&#x2014; &#x2014; If, however, one repents only in his old age, when he is no longer able to do what he used to do, his repentance, though not the best, will nevertheless do him some good. Even if a person transgressed all his life and repented on the day of his death and died during his repentance, all his sins are pardoned, as it is written: &#x201C;Before the sun grows dark, and the light goes from moon and stars, and the clouds gather after rain&#x201D; (Ecclesiastes 12:2), that is, the day of death. This implies that if he remembers his Creator and repents before death, he is forgiven.</p>
<p>3. Anyone who makes a verbal confession without resolving in his heart to abandon his sin is like one who takes a ritual bath while grasping a defiling reptile. The bath is useless unless he first casts the reptile away.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>9. Repentance and <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> effect atonement only for sins committed against God, as when one has eaten forbidden food;&#x2014; &#x2014; sins committed against a fellow man, as when a person either injured or cursed or robbed his neighbor, he is never pardoned unless he compensates his neighbor and makes an apology. Even though he has made the compensation, the wrongdoer must appease the injured person and ask his pardon. Even if he only annoyed him with words he must apologize and beg his forgiveness.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>10. One must not show himself cruel by not accepting an apology; he should be easily pacified, and provoked with difficulty. When an offender asks his forgiveness, he should forgive wholeheartedly and with a willing spirit. Even if he has caused him much trouble wrongfully, he must not avenge himself, he must not bear a grudge. This is the way of the stock of Israel and their upright hearts.&#x2014; &#x2014; Concerning the Gibeonites who refused to forgive and be appeased, it is written: &#x201C;The Gibeonites did not belong to the people of Israel&#x201D; (II Samuel 21:2).</p>
<h1>Chapter Three</h1>
<p>1. Every human being has virtues and sins. One whose merits exceed his sins is a good man; one whose sins exceed his merits is an evil man. If they are fifty-fifty in a person, he is intermediate [between the good and the bad]. So it is with a city. If the merits of all its citizens exceed their iniquities, it is good; if their iniquities exceed their merits, it is bad. And so it is with the entire world.</p>
<p>3. Anyone who has regretted his good deeds and merits, saying to himself: &#x201C;What have I accomplished by practising them? I wish I had not performed them,&#x201D; has forfeited all of them, and none of his merits is recalled in his favor, as it is written: &#x201C;A good man&#x2019;s goodness shall not save him on the day of his rebellion&#x201D; (Ezekiel 33:12)&#x2014;this verse refers to one who is sorry for his good deeds in the past. Just as a man&#x2019;s good and bad deeds are balanced when he is dying, so are the good and bad deeds of all individuals weighed annually during the festival of <italic>Rosh Hashanah:</italic> whoever is found innocent is marked for life; whoever is found guilty is marked for death; the intermediate individual [neither very good nor very bad] is held in suspense till <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>. If he repents he is marked for life; if not, he is marked for death.</p>
<p>4. Even though the sounding of the <italic>shofar</italic> on <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> is a biblical decree, it has an intimation, as if to say: &#x201C;Arise from your slumber, you who are asleep; wake up from your deep sleep, you who are fast asleep; search your deeds and repent; remember your Creator. Those of you who forget the truth because of passing vanities, indulging throughout the year in the useless things that cannot profit you nor save you, look into your souls, amend your ways and deeds. Let everyone give up his evil way and his bad purpose.&#x201D; Everybody should, therefore, regard himself throughout the year as half innocent and half guilty; so too, he should consider the entire world as half innocent and half guilty. If then he commits one additional sin he presses down the scale of guilt against himself and the entire world, and causes his destruction; if, on the other hand, he performs a good deed he presses down the scale of merit in his favor and that of the entire world, and causes salvation and deliverance to reach him and his fellow men, as it is written: &#x201C;The just man is the foundation of the world&#x201D; (Proverbs 10:25); that is, he who acts justly presses down the scale of merit in favor of the world and saves it. For this reason, the whole house of Israel has formed a custom to engage in the performance of charity and good deeds between <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> and <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> to a much larger extent than during the entire year. Besides, during these ten days, they are all accustomed to rise in the night and to pray and supplicate in the synagogue until daylight.</p>
<p>7. Five types of persons are termed infidels: 1) he who says that there is no God and the world has no Ruler; 2) he who says that there is not one Ruler but two or more; 3) he who says that there is one Lord, but he has body and form; 4) he who says that God is not the First Cause and Creator of all things; and so too, 5) he who worships some other god that should function as an intercessor between him and the Lord of the universe. Each of these five is called infidel.</p>
<p>8. Three types of persons are termed epicurean heretics: 1) he who says that there is no prophecy at all and that there is no knowledge which emanates from the Creator and reaches the hearts of men; 2) he who denies the prophecy of Moses; 3) he who says that the Creator is not aware of human actions. Each of these three is an epicurean heretic.</p>
<p>11. Anyone who stands aloof from the community, even though he commits no crimes but only separates himself from the Jewish people and does not perform religious duties as one of them, nor does he project himself into their distress nor share their fasts, but proceeds on his own way, as if he were a non-Jew and not one of them,&#x2014; &#x2014; such an individual has no share in the world to come. Anyone who, like Jehoiakim, commits crimes impudently, whether these are light or grave crimes, has no share in the world to come. Such a person is called a shameless sinner, because he exhibits effrontery and shows himself unashamed by the words of the Torah.</p>
<p>12. There are two types of informers: one who turns over a fellow Jew into the power of pagans to kill him or to beat him; and one who turns over the property of a fellow Jew into the hands of a terrorist, who is like a pagan. Both types of informers have no share in the world to come.</p>
<p>14. &#x2014; &#x2014; All wicked individuals, criminals, apostates, and the like, who repent publicly or secretly are accepted, as it is written: &#x201C;Turn back, you faithless children&#x201D; (Jeremiah 3:22); even though he still appears faithless, since he has repented only secretly and not publicly, he is accepted as a repentant.</p>
<h1>Chapter Four</h1>
<p>1. Twenty-four things hinder repentance. Four of these are grievous offenses. If one commits any of them, God gives him no opportunity to repent because of the gravity of the offense. Offenders of this type are: 1) he who leads the people to sin; this includes one who prevents them from doing a good deed; 2) he who diverts another from the good to the evil, such as a seducer or enticer; 3) he who sees that his son is falling into bad ways and does not stop him; being under his control, the son would desist if checked by the father; hence, it is as if he actually led him to sin;&#x2014; &#x2014; 4) he who says: &#x201C;I will sin and then repent.&#x201D; This includes one who says: &#x201C;I will sin and <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> will atone.&#x201D;</p>
<p>2. Five of the twenty-four misdeeds shut the ways of repentance to those who commit them. They are: 1) he who stands aloof from the community; since he is not among them when they repent, he does not share the merit they attain; 2) he who opposes the rulings of the sages; since his opposition induces him to stand away from them, he remains ignorant of the ways of repentance; 3) he who makes a mockery of the divine precepts; since they are held in contempt by him, he does not eagerly obey them, and if he does not obey how can he attain merit? 4) he who insults his teachers;&#x2014; &#x2014; 5) he who hates rebukes, because he leaves himself no way of repentance; for it is reproof that induces repentance.&#x2014; &#x2014; All the prophets rebuked Israel until they repented. It is therefore necessary to engage in every Jewish community a great elderly scholar, God-fearing from his youth and well-liked by the people, to preach to them and lead them to repentance. But he who hates reproof does not come to listen to the preacher; hence he persists in his faults which seem good to him.</p>
<p>3. Five of the twenty-four misdeeds are of such nature that anyone who commits them cannot attain complete repentance, because they are sins against a fellow man without knowing who it is in order to compensate him and ask his pardon. Offenders of this category are: 1) he who curses the people and not an individual, of whom he might ask to forgive him; 2) he who shares with a thief;&#x2014; &#x2014; 3) he who finds lost property and does not announce it, that he may restore it to its owner; when he repents after some time, he does not know to whom he should restore it; 4) he who despoils the poor, orphans and widows; these people are wretched and not well known, they migrate from town to town and have no acquaintance, whereby to ascertain how to refund what he has robbed; 5) he who takes bribes to tamper with justice,&#x2014; &#x2014; thus encouraging the bribing litigant and leading him to sin.</p>
<p>4. Five of the twenty-four offenses are such that the person who commits them is not likely to repent, because they are regarded by most people as trivial, with the result that the sinner imagines that it is no sin. Offenders of this class are: 1) he who shares a meal that is insufficient for its owner; since this is a tinge of robbery, he imagines that he has not done any wrong, saying: &#x201C;I did not eat without his consent&#x201D;; 2) he who makes use of a poor man&#x2019;s pledge; since a poor man&#x2019;s pledge happens to be only an axe or a plow, and the user says to himself: &#x201C;The articles have not depreciated, and I have not robbed him&#x201D;; 3) he who gazes at women lustfully supposes that there is nothing wrong in it,&#x2014; &#x2014; and does not realize that the lustful look is a grave sin, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall not follow the desires of your heart and your eyes&#x201D; (Numbers 15:39); 4) he who elevates himself at the expense of another&#x2019;s degradation thinks to himself that this is no sin, since the other person is absent and has not endured shame; nor has he actually shamed him by comparing his own good deeds and wisdom with the other man&#x2019;s deeds or wisdom, implying that he is honorable while the other is contemptible; 5) he who suspects honest men says to himself that it is no sin. &#x201C;What have I done to him?&#x201D; he says; &#x201C;is there anything more in it than a mere suspicion that maybe he has done it and maybe not?&#x201D; He does not realize that it is sinful to regard a worthy person as a transgressor.</p>
<p>5. Five of the twenty-four misdeeds are such that anyone who commits them will always be attracted to them, and they are hard to be given up. One should therefore be careful lest he become addicted to them, for they are all extremely obnoxious traits. Here they are: gossip, slander, wrath, evil thought, keeping bad company.&#x2014; &#x2014; In the rules concerning ethical behavior we have explained the traits that all men should ever cultivate, and so much the more one who repents.</p>
<p>6. All these and similar misdeeds do not prevent repentance, even though they hinder it. If a person is sincerely remorseful over them and repents, he is a repentant indeed and has a share in the world to come.</p>
<h1>Chapter Five</h1>
<p>1. Free will is granted to every human being. If a man wants to follow the good path and be good, he has the power to do so; if he wants to follow the evil way and be wicked, he is free to do so. It is written: &#x201C;Indeed, man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil&#x201D; (Genesis 3:22). That is to say, the human species is unique in the world, there being no other species like it in this respect, namely that man by himself, using his own intelligence and reason, knows what is good and what is evil, without anyone preventing him from doing good or evil as he pleases; in view of this, &#x201C;he will perhaps put forth his hand and take also from the tree of life&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>
<p>2. Let it not occur to your mind that God decrees at the birth of a person that he shall be good or evil, a notion expressed by foolish non-Jews and most of the stupid individuals among the Jews. It is not so. Every human being is capable of becoming righteous like Moses or wicked like Jeroboam, wise or foolish, merciful or cruel, niggardly or generous; and so with all other traits. There is no one to compel him or to decree what he is to do, no one to pull him in either direction; it is he who directs himself deliberately toward any course he desires. This is what Jeremiah means when he says: &#x201C;It is not from the mouth of the Most High that good and evil comes&#x201D; (Lamentations 3:38); that is to say, the Creator does not decree that a man shall be either good or evil. In view of this, it follows that the sinner causes his own ruin; he should therefore weep and lament because of his sins and the resulting evil he has brought upon himself.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>4. If God were to decree that a person should be either good or bad, or if there were in the very essence of man&#x2019;s nature anything that irresistibly draws him to a particular course, or to a special branch of knowledge, to special characteristics or actions, as the foolish stargazers invent in their own minds, how could God have commanded us through the prophets: &#x201C;Do this and you must not do that, improve your ways, and do not follow your wicked impulse,&#x201D; if a man&#x2019;s destiny had already been decreed from his very birth, or his innate makeup draws him to something from which he cannot escape? &#x0021; What room would there be for the entire Torah?&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Do not wonder, saying: How can man do all that he pleases and be in control of his actions? Is there anything in the world that can be performed without the Creator&#x2019;s authority and against his wish?&#x2014; &#x2014; Know, indeed, that God performs everything according to his wish, even though we are in control of our actions. For example, just as the Creator willed that fire and air should ascend upward and that water and earth should descend downward, and that the sphere should revolve in a circle &#x2014; &#x2014; so he willed that man should have freedom to act and that all his actions should be within his power. &#x2014; &#x2014; Hence, he is judged according to his deeds: if he has behaved well, he receives a good reward; if he has misbehaved, he is punished.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Seven</h1>
<p>2. A man should always consider himself as if he is about to die; he may die when his time is up while still behaving sinfully. He should therefore repent of his sins immediately. Let him not say: &#x201C;When I grow old I shall repent,&#x201D; since he may die before getting old. Solomon in his wisdom said: &#x201C;Let your garments be always white&#x201D; (Ecclesiastes 9:8).</p>
<p>3. Do not say that repentance is limited to sinful acts, such as fornication, robbery and theft. Just as a man must repent of these, so he must scan and search his evil traits, repenting of anger, hatred, envy, scoffing, greed, vainglory, excessive desire for food, and so on. One must repent of all these failings. They are worse than sinful acts; when a person is addicted to them, he finds it hard to get rid of them. The prophet says: &#x201C;Let the guilty man give up his way, and the evil man his thoughts&#x201D; (Isaiah 55:7).</p>
<p>4. Let not the repentant person imagine that he is far removed from the merit of the righteous on account of the iniquities and sins he committed. This is not so. He is tenderly loved by the Creator as if he had never sinned. Besides, his reward is great, since he had tasted sin and got rid of it by suppressing his evil impulse. The sages said: &#x201C;Where repentant sinners stand the thoroughly righteous cannot stand&#x201D; (Berakhoth 34b); that is, their merit is superior to that of persons who never committed a sin, because the repentant had to exert greater effort in suppressing their impulse.</p>
<p>8. Those who repent should be exceedingly humble in their behavior. If ignorant fools insult them by mentioning their past deeds and saying to them: &#x201C;Last night you were doing this and that; last night you were saying this and that,&#x201D; they should pay no attention to them, but upon hearing this they should rejoice, knowing that this is their merit. As long as they feel ashamed of their past deeds and are disgraced because of them, their merit and worth are enhanced. It is a flagrant sin to say to a repentant person: &#x201C;Remember your past deeds,&#x201D; or to mention them in his presence so as to embarrass him, or to recall similar incidents that are reminiscent of what he did. All this is forbidden along with all kinds of insulting words against which the Torah warns us, as it is written: &#x201C;You must not vex one another&#x201D; (Leviticus 25:17).</p>
<h1>Chapter Ten</h1>
<p>1. Let no person say: &#x201C;I perform the precepts of the Torah and study its wisdom, so that I may receive all the blessings written in it, or that I may attain life in the world to come; I keep away from the sins against which the Torah has warned us, so that I may be saved from the curses written in the Torah, or that I may not be cut off from life in the world to come.&#x201D; It is unworthy to serve God in this manner; anyone who serves in this manner does so out of fear. &#x2014; &#x2014; Only illiterate men, women, and children serve the Lord after this fashion. Children are trained to serve out of fear until they grow in knowledge and serve out of love.</p>
<p>4. The ancient sages said: &#x201C;You will perhaps declare: &#x201C;I study Torah so that I may become rich, that I may be called Rabbi, that I may receive a reward in the world to come.&#x201D; It is therefore written: <italic>To love the Lord</italic> (Deuteronomy 11:13), whatever you do you must do only out of love&#x201D; (Sifr&#x00E9;).</p>
<p>5. Whoever studies Torah in order that he may receive a reward, or that he may escape misfortune, is not studying Torah for its own sake; whoever studies it neither out of fear nor for the sake of a reward, but only out of love for the Lord of the entire world who has commanded us to do so, studies Torah for its own sake. The sages declared: &#x201C;One should under all circumstances study Torah, even if not for its own sake; though he does not study the Torah for its own sake now, he will end up by studying it for its own sake&#x201D; (Pesa&#x1E25;im 50b). Hence, when we instruct the young, the women, and the illiterate, we teach them to serve out of fear and in order to receive a reward, until they become much wiser. Then we reveal to them this secret gradually, training them gently in this matter, until they have grasped it, and will serve out of love.</p>

<chapter>
<title>READING OF THE SHEMA</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. Anyone reciting the <italic>Shema</italic> inserts a sentence between the first verse and the rest of the biblical passage, saying in a low tone: &#x201C;Blessed be the name of his glorious majesty forever and ever.&#x201D; Then he goes on to say: &#x201C;You shall love the Lord your God&#x2026;&#x201D; to the end. Why is the <italic>Shema</italic> recited in this manner? We have it on tradition that when our father Jacob was about to die in Egypt, he gathered his sons about him and exhorted them concerning the Oneness of God and the uprightness of Abraham and Isaac who followed the way of God. Then he asked them, saying: &#x201C;My sons, is there one among you with a defect, who is not with me in believing in One God?&#x201D; They all replied: &#x201C;Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One.&#x201D; They meant to say: &#x201C;Israel our father, hear our confession of faith: the Lord is our God, the Lord is One.&#x201D; The aged patriarch uttered thereupon: &#x201C;Blessed be the name of his glorious majesty forever and ever.&#x201D; Hence it is a custom in Israel to insert the praise of patriarch Israel immediately after the first verse of the <italic>Shema</italic>.</p>
<h1>Chapter Two</h1>
<p>8. &#x2014; &#x2014; One should recite the <italic>Shema</italic> audibly enough for himself to hear; if he has not done so, he has not fulfilled his obligation. He should enunciate the letters distinctly; if he has not done so, he has done his duty nevertheless.</p>
<p>9. How should one enunciate the letters clearly?&#x2014; &#x2014; One should pause between words which are likely to be jumbled together, between two identical letters with which one word ends and the immediately following one begins, as in the phrase <italic>b&#x2019;khol l&#x2019;vavkha</italic>. A pause should be made after <italic>b&#x2019;khol</italic> before reading the word <italic>l&#x2019;vavkha</italic>. Similarly, <italic>va&#x2019;avadtem m&#x2019;herah, ha-kanaf p&#x2019;thil</italic>. So too, the <italic>zayin</italic> in <italic>tizkeru</italic> should be pronounced distinctly. One should draw out the <italic>da-leth</italic> in <italic>e&#x1E25;ad</italic> long enough to acclaim God as King in heaven and on earth, and toward the four cardinal points of the compass. One must not slur over the <italic>&#x1E25;eth</italic> in <italic>e&#x1E25;ad</italic>, lest the word might sound <italic>ee &#x1E25;ad</italic> (not one).</p>
<p>10. A person may recite the <italic>Shema</italic> in any language he knows. He must carefully avoid blunders in whatever language he happens to recite the <italic>Shema</italic>, and must try to be as accurate in that language as he would have to be in the sacred tongue.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>PRAYER</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>4. When the Jewish people were exiled in the days of wicked Nebuchadnezzar, they mixed with Persians, Greeks and other nationalities. Children were born to them in foreign lands. The language of these children was confused, a mixture of many languages. They were unable to express themselves adequately and accurately in any one language, as it is written: &#x201C;Their children spoke half in the tongue of Ashdod; they could not speak Hebrew, nor any foreign tongue&#x201D; (Nehemiah 13:24). When anyone of them prayed, his Hebrew vocabulary was too limited to express his needs or to praise God without mixing Hebrew with other tongues. When Ezra and his council took notice of this, they instituted the Eighteen Benedictions in their present order: the first three contain praise to God; the last three, thanksgiving; the intermediate benedictions contain petitions for the most essential needs of the individual and the community. They were to be set on everyone&#x2019;s lips and learned, so that the men of inarticulate speech might offer prayer as clearly as those who speak an eloquent Hebrew. For this reason they instituted all other blessings and prayers which are arrayed on the lips of all Israel, to make each blessing readily available to one who is unfamiliar with the language.</p>
<h1>Chapter Eight</h1>
<p>1. Congregational prayer is always heard by God. Even if sinners are present, God does not reject public worship. One should therefore associate himself with the congregation; he should not pray in private when he can pray with the congregation.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>4. How is public worship conducted? One person recites the prayers aloud and all the rest listen. This is not done if there are fewer than ten adult men present, including the reader.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>5. &#x2014; &#x2014; <italic>Kaddish</italic> is not recited unless ten are present. The <italic>kohanim</italic> do not raise their hands to pronounce the priestly benediction unless ten are present, the <italic>kohanim</italic> being included in the number. Every group of ten Israelites is called <italic>congregation</italic>, as it is written: &#x201C;How long shall I endure this wicked congregation&#x201D; (Numbers 14:27). This verse refers to ten spies, Joshua and Caleb being excluded.</p>
<p>9. The reader acts on behalf of the assembled congregation. When, for example, he recites the prayers while the people listen and respond <italic>Amen</italic> after each blessing, it is as if they are praying. This only applies to one who does not know how to worship; but one who knows does not fulfill his duty unless he recites the prayers himself.</p>
<p>11. The appointed congregational reader should be known for his knowledge and good conduct. If he happens to be an elderly person, so much the better. An effort should be made to secure one who has a pleasant voice and is fluent in reading.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>12. An inarticulate man, who pronounces the <italic>aleph</italic> as an <italic>ayin</italic> or the <italic>ayin</italic> as an <italic>aleph</italic>, and anyone who fails to pronounce the letters correctly, should not be appointed as congregational reader.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Eleven</h1>
<p>1. Any place inhabited by ten Jews should have a house of worship where they can assemble at all times of prayer. This is called a synagogue. The residents may compel each other to build a synagogue and buy a <italic>Sefer Torah</italic> as well as the books of the Prophets and the Sacred Writings.</p>
<p>5. Synagogues and houses of learning should be treated with respect; they should be swept and sprinkled to let the dust settle. In Spain and Morocco, in Babylonia and Eretz Yisrael, it is customary to light lamps in the synagogues and to spread mats on the floor to sit upon. In Christian countries they sit on chairs.</p>
<p>6. Synagogues and houses of learning should not be treated with irreverence, such as jesting, mocking or chatting. We must not eat, drink, have pleasures, or ramble about there. We must not enter them for protection from the sun or the rain. Teachers and their students, however, are permitted to eat and drink there when necessary.</p>
<p>7. No computing should be made there, unless it is connected with some religious duty, such as counting the proceeds of the charity fund or the collection of ransom money, and so on. No funeral address should be delivered there, unless it is of public interest, as when one of the city&#x2019;s leading scholars is eulogized and the entire community is likely to attend.</p>
<h1>Chapter Twelve</h1>
<p>1. Our teacher Moses introduced the custom of reading the Torah publicly on Sabbath, Monday and Thursday, during the morning service, so that three days should not elapse without hearing the Torah. Ezra set up the rule that the Torah should be read during the afternoon service every Sabbath for the benefit of those seated at street corners [traders, who do not attend services on weekdays]. He also established the rule that three men should be called up to the reading of the Torah on Monday and Thursday and that they should read not less than ten verses altogether.</p>
<p>2. The Torah is read publicly on Sabbaths, festivals, <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh</italic>, fast days, <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah, Purim</italic>, and on Mondays and Thursdays. The prophetical reading (<italic>haftarah</italic>) is rendered only on Sabbaths, festivals, and <italic>Tish&#x2018;ah b&#x2019;Av</italic>.</p>
<p>9. As soon as the reader begins to read the Torah, it is forbidden to talk even on a religious topic. All must listen silently and pay attention to what he is reading, as it is written: &#x201C;They all listened closely to the book of the Torah&#x201D; (Nehemiah 8:3). It is also forbidden to leave the synagogue while the Torah is being read; but it is permissible to leave between the <italic>aliyyoth</italic> of the men called up to the Torah. A person who is always engaged in Torah study, this being his main occupation, may nevertheless go on studying while the Torah is read.</p>
<p>10. Since the days of Ezra it had been customary to have an interpreter present, explaining to the people what the reader is reading in the Torah, so that they may understand what it is all about. The reader reads one verse only, waits till the interpreter has explained it, and then reads the next verse. The reader may not read to the interpreter more than one verse at a time.</p>
<p>16. How many persons are called up to the reading of the Torah? Seven during Sabbath morning service, six on <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, five on festivals; no fewer than these are called up, but the number may be increased. Four are called up on <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh</italic> and <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Mo&#x2018;ed</italic>. Three are called up during the afternoon services of Sabbath and <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, as well as during the morning services held on Mondays and Thursdays throughout the year, and also during the morning and afternoon services held on fast days. The numbers of four and three <italic>aliyyoth</italic>, just indicated, are neither decreased nor increased.</p>
<p>18. In each Torah reading, a <italic>kohen</italic> reads first, then a <italic>levi</italic>, then a <italic>yisrael</italic>. According to a wide-spread custom, even an illiterate <italic>kohen</italic> has priority over a great scholar who is a <italic>yisrael</italic> (lay Israelite). Otherwise, the person who is superior in knowledge precedes the one who is inferior as to the remaining <italic>aliyyoth</italic>. The person who is honored with the last <italic>aliyyah</italic>, who rolls up the Torah scroll, receives a reward excelling that of the others. Hence [because of the importance of the last <italic>aliyyah</italic>], even the chief officer of the congregation ascends to complete the Torah reading.</p>
<p>19. In the absence of a <italic>kohen</italic>, a <italic>yisrael</italic> ascends to the Torah first, in which case a <italic>levi</italic> should not ascend after him. In the absence of a <italic>levi</italic>, the <italic>kohen</italic>, who read the first section, reads the second section in place of the <italic>levi</italic>. Another <italic>kohen</italic> should not read after the first, lest people would say that the first is a disqualified <italic>kohen</italic>, substituted by another. Neither should one <italic>levi</italic> follow another, lest people might suspect one of the two as disqualified.</p>
<h1>Chapter Thirteen</h1>
<p>1. The widespread custom among the Jews is that of completing the Torah reading in one year. It is begun on the Sabbath after <italic>Sukkoth</italic> &#x2014; &#x2014; and continued in regular order till the last weekly portion is read on <italic>Sukkoth</italic>. Some complete the Torah reading in three years, but this is not a widespread custom.</p>
<p>25. Although one hears the congregational reading of the Torah every Sabbath, one should read for himself each weekly portion three times, twice the original text and once the Aramaic version known as Targum Onkelos. A verse that is not rendered in Targum Onkelos should be read three times in the original Hebrew. In this fashion one will conclude the weekly portions of the Torah together with the congregation.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>TEFILLIN</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. The four biblical sections which begin with verses &#x201C;Consecrate all the first-born to me&#x2026; And when the Lord will bring you into the land&#x201D; (Exodus 13:1-10; 11:16), &#x201C;Hear, O Israel&#x2026; And if you will carefully obey my commands&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 6:4-9; 11:13-21) are written separately and covered within a small square box of leather. They are called <italic>tefillin;</italic> and are worn one on the head and one on the left arm.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>6. There are three kinds of parchment: <italic>gvil, klaf</italic> and <italic>duxustus</italic>. They are made as follows: The skin of a sheep, goat, or other animal, is taken, and after removing its hair, is sprinkled with salt and treated with flour and gall-nut resin, or anything that contracts the pores of the hide and makes it durable. This parchment is called <italic>gvil</italic>.</p>
<p>7. If the hide had been split, after removing its hair, so as to make it two skins, one thin which was next to the hair, and the other thick which was next to the flesh, and these were treated first with salt, then with flour and gall-nut resin or similar substance, the skin which had been next to the hair is called <italic>klaf</italic> (outer-skin parchment), and that which had been next to the flesh is called <italic>duxustus</italic> (inner-skin parchment).</p>
<p>8. According to an ancient tradition, attributed to Moses at Sinai, a <italic>Sefer Torah</italic> should be written on <italic>gvil</italic> (unsplit parchment), on the side which was next to the hair; <italic>tefillin</italic> should be written on <italic>klaf</italic> (the exterior part of the split hide), on the side which was near the flesh); a <italic>Mezuzah</italic> should be written on <italic>duxustus</italic> (the inner part of the split hide), on the side that was next to the hair. If the scribe has written on a <italic>klaf</italic> next to the hair, or on a <italic>gvil</italic> or <italic>duxustus</italic> next to the flesh, the <italic>Sefer Torah, tefillin</italic> and <italic>Mezuzah</italic> so written are disqualified.</p>
<p>12. According to an ancient tradition, attributed to Moses at Sinai, a <italic>Sefer Torah</italic> and a <italic>Mezuzah</italic> must be written only on traced lines. <italic>Tefillin</italic> do not need traced lines, because they are covered (within a leather box). <italic>Tefillin</italic> and a <italic>Mezuzah</italic> may be written from memory, because these passages are generally known by heart. A <italic>Sefer Torah</italic>, however, must not be written from memory, not even a single letter.</p>
<h1>Chapter Four</h1>
<p>1. Where are the <italic>tefillin</italic> placed? The head-phylactery is placed on the upper part of the head where the hair next to the forehead ends; it is the place where the child&#x2019;s brain pulsates. The phylactery should be adjusted in the center of the forehead, between the eyes. The knot should be at the top of the neck in the back, which is the end of the skull.</p>
<p>2. The hand-phylactery is attached to the left arm over the biceps, which is the flesh rising above the elbow, between the shoulder-blade and the forearm, so that when the upper arm is held close to the ribs the phylactery will be opposite the heart, in keeping with the precept: &#x201C;These words &#x2026; shall be on your heart&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 6:6).</p>
<p>6. When a person has recited the blessing for wearing the phylacteries and tied the hand-phylactery onto his arm, he must not talk, not even return a greeting to his master, till he has put on the head-phylactery. If he did talk, he has committed a transgression, and must recite another blessing &#x201C;concerning the precept of <italic>tefillin</italic>,&#x201D; and then he puts on the head-phylactery.</p>
<p>25. The sanctity of the <italic>tefillin</italic> is profound. As long as a man wears the <italic>tefillin</italic> on his head and arm, he is humble and God-fearing, is not drawn into frivolity and idle talk, does not engage in evil thoughts but fills his mind with thoughts of truth and justice. One should therefore strive to wear phylacteries all day, which is the right way of performing this precept. It is said of Rav, the disciple of our saintly Master [Rabbi Judah the Prince] that throughout his life no one saw him walking four cubits without Torah, <italic>tsitsith</italic>, or <italic>tefillin</italic>.</p>
<p>26. Although the requirement is prescribed for wearing them the whole day, it is especially so during the recital of prayers. The sages said: &#x201C;Whoever reads the <italic>Shema</italic> without wearing phylacteries is regarded as if he offered false evidence against himself [since the <italic>tefillin</italic> precept is contained in the <italic>Shema</italic>]. And whoever does not wear phylacteries at all breaks eight affirmative precepts, since in each of the four passages the command is given to wear a head-phylactery and a hand-phylactery. Whoever wears phylacteries regularly will enjoy a long life, as it is written: &#x201C;The Lord is upon them, they shall live&#x201D; (Isaiah 38:16).</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>MEZUZAH</title>
<h1>Chapter Five</h1>
<p>1. How is the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> written? Two biblical sections are written on one slip of parchment in a single column; they are: &#x201C;Hear, O Israel&#x2026; And if you will carefully obey&#x2026;&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 6:4; 11:13). A margin of half a nail&#x2019;s breadth is left below and above the column.&#x2014; &#x2014; A worn-out <italic>Sefer Torah</italic> or worn-out <italic>tefillin</italic> may not be used for the writing of a <italic>Mezuzah</italic> &#x2014; &#x2014; since what is holy must not be brought down to a lesser holiness.</p>
<p>4. There is a widespread custom to write down the word <italic>Shaddai</italic> (Almighty) on the outer side of the <italic>Mezuzah</italic>, opposite the blank space between the two sections. Since it is written on the outside, there is no harm done. On the other hand, those who write inside the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> names of angels or names of saintly men, some biblical verse or some charms, are included among the individuals who have no share in the world to come. Those fools not only fail to fulfill the commandment but they treat an important precept, which conveys God&#x2019;s Oneness as well as the love and worship of him, as if it were an amulet to benefit themselves, since they foolishly suppose that the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> is something advantageous for the vain pleasures of this world.</p>
<p>6. When the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> is folded, it is rolled up from the last line to the beginning, so that anyone who will open it will read it from the first line to the end. After rolling it up, one should place it in a tube of reed, wood or other material, and attach it to the doorpost with a nail; or else, he may hollow out a cavity in the doorpost and insert the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> into it.</p>
<p>7. Before attaching the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> to the doorpost, one should recite the blessing: &#x201C;Blessed art thou, Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us with thy commandments, and commanded us to attach a <italic>Mezuzah</italic>.&#x201D; One should recite no blessing at the time it is being written, because the precept is fulfilled in attaching the <italic>Mezuzah</italic>.</p>
<p>10. The duty of attaching a <italic>Mezuzah</italic> applies to all, including women and servants. Children under the age of thirteen should be trained to attach a <italic>Mezuzah</italic> to their homes.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Six</h1>
<p>1. There are ten conditions to be considered before an occupant of a house is obliged to attach a <italic>Mezuzah</italic> on the doorpost. In the absence of one of these he is exempt. They are as follows: The house should have an area of four cubits by four cubits or more; it must have two doorposts, a cross-piece (lintel), a roof, and doors; the entrance should be ten handbreadths high or more; it should be a structure for secular use; it should be built for human occupancy, respectable use, and permanent residence.</p>
<p>10. A house with several doors, even though only one of them is used regularly for coming and going, must have a <italic>Mezuzah</italic> attached to each door.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>13. One should carefully observe the precept of <italic>Mezuzah</italic>, for it is the duty of all, continuously. Whenever a person enters or leaves a home provided with a <italic>Mezuzah</italic>, he will meet with the Oneness of the Holy One, blessed be he, and will remember the love we owe to God. He will be roused from his sleep and indulgence in temporal vanities. He will conceive that nothing endures forever and to all eternity, except knowledge of the Creator of the universe, and immediately he will return to his right senses and walk in upright paths. The ancient sages declared: &#x201C;Anyone who has phylacteries on his head and arm, fringes on his garment, and a <italic>Mezuzah</italic> on his door, it is likely that he will not commit sins, for he has many reminders, veritable angels that rescue him from sinning, as it is written: &#x201C;The angel of the Lord camps around his worshipers, and rescues them&#x201D; (Psalm 34:8).</p>

<chapter>
<title>SEFER TORAH</title>
<h1>Chapter Seven</h1>
<p>1. Every Jew is affirmatively commanded to write a <italic>Sefer Torah</italic> for his own use, as it is written: &#x201C;Now therefore write down this song for yourselves&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 31:19). This means: Write down the Torah which contains this song, for the Torah is not written in separate sections. Even if a person has inherited a <italic>Sefer Torah</italic> from his forebears, it is a religious duty to write one at his own expense. If he wrote it with his own hand, it is as if he had received it at Mount Sinai. If he does not know how to write one, he should have others write it for him. Anyone who corrects a single letter in a <italic>Sefer Torah</italic> is credited with writing all of it.</p>
<p>4. If a <italic>Sefer Torah</italic> has been written without traced lines, or partly on <italic>gvil</italic> parchment and partly on <italic>klaf</italic>, it is disqualified. It must be written entirely either on <italic>gvil</italic> or on <italic>klaf</italic>. How should a <italic>Sefer Torah</italic> be written? The scribe must use a correct, fine script; he is to leave the space of a small letter between words, and a hair space between letters; he should leave the space of a line between lines. The length of each line is to be thirty letters, wide enough for a ten-letter word written three times.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Eight</h1>
<p>1. An open section in the Torah has two forms. If the scribe has completed the preceding section in the middle of the line, he should leave the rest of the line blank and start the open section at the beginning of the next line. This applies only to a case where the last unfinished line still has space for nine letters; but if the space left is less, or if the preceding section has been completed at the end of the line, then the scribe must leave the next line blank and start the open section at the beginning of the third line.</p>
<p>2. A closed section has three forms. If the scribe has completed the preceding section in the middle of the line, he must leave a blank space sufficient for nine letters and start at the end of the line with one word of the closed section, so that the blank space is between it and the preceding section. If space for the required blank has not been left enough to write one word at the end of the line, the scribe should leave the rest of the line blank, then indent the next line somewhat and start the closed section within the line. If the scribe completed the preceding section at the end of the line, he should leave the required blank space at the beginning of the second line and start to write the closed section within the line. Hence you may say that the beginning of an open section is always at the beginning of the line, and the beginning of a closed section is always in the middle of the line.</p>
<p>3. A <italic>Sefer Torah</italic> that is incorrect in regard to the <italic>plene</italic> and defective spellings can be corrected as we have already explained. But if the scribe made a mistake in the spacing between the sections, and wrote an open section in the form of a closed section or a closed section in the form of an open one, or left a blank space where a section is not ended, or continued writing without leaving a blank space where a section ends, or deviated from the prescribed form of the poetic passages, then the <italic>Sefer Torah</italic> is disqualified for use and there is no remedy for it other than discarding the entire column in which the scribe committed the error.</p>
<p>4. Inasmuch as I have detected much blundering in all the scrolls of the Torah that I have examined with regard to these things, while the Masorites who write books about open and closed sections differ on the basis of varied scrolls upon which they rely, I have seen fit to list here all the closed and open sections as well as the forms of the poetic verses, so that all the scrolls may be prepared and corrected accordingly. The copy on which I have relied as to these things is the well-known codex in Egypt, containing the twenty-four books of the Bible, which was used in Jerusalem for many years as the standard text for the proofreading of scrolls. All relied upon it, because it had been examined by Ben-Asher who had paid close attention to it for many years, correcting it as often as he was copying from it. It was this codex from which I copied the scroll and prepared it according to the traditional rules.</p>
<p>The song on crossing the Red Sea (Exodus 15:1-19) should be written in thirty lines, the first line as usual; the other lines, one with a blank space in the middle, the next with blank spaces in two places, so that the line is divided into three parts, with a blank space corresponding to writing above and below it, like this&#x2026; (See the Hebrew text.)</p>
<p>Throughout the Torah, in the poetic verses as well as in the remaining text, the scribe should aim to write the letters of each word close together, seeing to it that they are not joined to each other, nor far from each other to make the word seem two words; there should be merely a hair space separating the letters. If the scribe wrote one letter so far apart from the other that a child who is not familiar with the text would regard one word as two words, the scroll is disqualified until the correction is made.</p>
<h1>Chapter Ten</h1>
<p>1. Hence you may infer that there are twenty things, each of which disqualifies a <italic>Sefer Torah</italic>. If any of these occurs, the <italic>Sefer Torah</italic> is like a regular <italic>&#x1E24;ummash</italic> out of which children are taught; it has not the sanctity of a <italic>Sefer Torah</italic>, and is not used for congregational reading. They follow:<br>1) If it was written on the skin of an unclean animal; 2) if it was written on the skin of a clean animal that had not been made into parchment; 3) if the skin had been made into parchment but not for the express purpose of writing a <italic>Sefer Torah;</italic> 4) if it was written on the wrong side: on <italic>gvil</italic> next to the flesh, or on <italic>klaf</italic> next to the hair; 5) if it was written partly on <italic>gvil</italic> and partly on <italic>klaf;</italic> 6) if it was written on <italic>duxustus;</italic> 7) if it was written without traced lines; 8) if it was not written with indelible black ink; 9) if it was written in any language other than Hebrew; 10) if the scribe who wrote it was a heretic or one of other disqualified individuals; 11) if the scribe wrote the names of God without intent; 12) if he omitted a single letter; 13) if he added one letter; 14) if one letter touched another; 15) if one letter was so distorted that it cannot be read at all, or resembles another letter; 16) if the scribe wrote letters so far apart or so closely together that one word looks like two words or two words look like one word; 17) if he altered the form of the sections; 18) if he altered the form of the poetic verses; 19) if he wrote any other section in the form of a poetic passage; 20) if he did not sew the parchment sheets with dried tendon of a clean animal.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>TSITSITH</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. The fringe that is attached to the corner of the garment and produced of the same type of material as the garment is called <italic>tsitsith</italic>, because it is like a lock of hair, as it is written: &#x201C;He took me by a lock of my head&#x201D; (Ezekiel 8:3). This fringe is called <italic>the white</italic>, because we are not commanded to dye it. No definite number of threads is prescribed in the Torah.</p>
<p>2. A thread of wool dyed purple-blue, the color of the sky, is taken and entwined in the fringe. This thread is called <italic>the blue</italic>. The number of times this thread should be wound is not specified in the Torah.</p>
<p>5. Although the blue in the fringes and the white do not impair each other [even if a fringe is all white or all blue it remains valid], they do not constitute two precepts but one affirmative precept. The ancient sages interpreted: <italic>You shall have it as a fringe</italic> (Numbers 15:39) to mean that both, the white and the blue, constitute one precept. The absence of any one of the four fringes makes the others invalid, since all the four constitute one precept. Anyone who wears the garment with white or blue fringes, or both together, fulfills the positive command.</p>
<h1>Chapter Three</h1>
<p>1. The garment that one is biblically obligated to provide with fringes is a four-cornered garment or one that has more than four corners. Its size should be large enough to cover the head and greater part of the body of a child big enough to walk by himself in the street without requiring anyone to watch and accompany him. The garment should be of wool or linen.</p>
<p>11. Although one is not obligated to buy a garment and enwrap himself in it so as to provide it with fringes, yet it is improper for a devout man to exempt himself from observing this precept. He should always strive to wear a garment that requires fringes, so as to perform this precept. He should take special care of this during prayer. It is very disrespectful for scholars to recite prayers without being enwrapped in a <italic>tallith</italic>.</p>
<p>12. One should always be heedful of the precept concerning fringes, since the Torah regards it to be of such importance that all the commandments have been made to depend on it, as it is written: &#x201C;When you look upon it you will remember to do all the commands of the Lord&#x201D; (Numbers 15:39).</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>BENEDICTIONS</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. It is a biblical positive command to recite grace after meals, as it is written: &#x201C;When you have eaten your fill, bless the Lord your God&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 8:10). One is biblically obligated to recite the grace only when sated, since it is written <italic>when you have eaten your fill, bless</italic>. But on rabbinic grounds, one is to recite grace after eating anything the size of an olive.</p>
<p>2. By rabbinical enactment, one should recite a blessing before enjoying any food. He should even recite a blessing before eating or drinking anything at all. So too, one should recite a blessing before enjoying a sweet fragrance. Whoever enjoys anything without a blessing commits sacrilege. Similarly, by rabbinical enactment, one should recite grace after eating or drinking anything; that is, if he drinks a quarter of a <italic>log</italic> [equal to the contents of an egg and a half] or eats an olive&#x2019;s bulk. Mere tasting requires no blessing either before or after, if it is less than a quarter of a <italic>log</italic>.</p>
<p>3. Just as blessings are recited over food enjoyment, so must we recite a blessing before the performance of each religious duty. The sages instituted many blessings in the form of praise, thanksgiving, and petition, in order to have God in mind constantly, even when one does not partake of food and drink or perform a religious duty.</p>
<p>6. All blessings may be recited in any language, provided that they are in the form instituted by the sages. If one has changed the formula, he has nevertheless fulfilled his duty, since the divine name and sovereignty as well as the subject matter of the blessing have been mentioned, even though in a secular language.</p>
<p>7. One should recite all blessings audibly enough for himself to hear what he is saying; but if he did not recite them audibly, he has nevertheless fulfilled his duty, whether he uttered them with his lips or recited them in his mind.</p>
<p>8. There must be no pause between any blessing and the object for which it is pronounced. If such a pause has occurred, the blessing must be repeated. If the interruption was due to anything pertaining to the blessing, the blessing should not be repeated. If, for example, one recited the blessing over bread, and before eating he said: &#x201C;Bring salt, bring the cooked food, give food to so-and-so, feed the animals,&#x201D; he should not repeat the blessing.</p>
<p>11. Anyone who hears a blessing from beginning to end, thereby intending to fulfill his duty, has fulfilled his duty even if he has failed to answer <italic>Amen</italic>. Whoever answers <italic>Amen</italic> after a blessing recited by someone else is regarded as if he has recited it himself, provided that the person who recites the blessing is obliged to do so. &#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>12. When many people assembled to eat bread or drink wine, and one of them recited the blessing while all the rest answered <italic>Amen</italic>, they are permitted to eat and drink.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>13. Whoever hears a Jew recite a blessing has to answer <italic>Amen</italic>, even if he has not heard the entire blessing from beginning to end.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>15. Whoever recites a blessing in vain is like one who takes the name of God in vain or swears in vain. It is forbidden to answer <italic>Amen</italic> after such a blessing. Children are taught the blessings in their regular form. This is permitted, even though they recite the blessings in vain during the study period. We should not answer <italic>Amen</italic> after them; he who answers <italic>Amen</italic> after them does not fulfill his duty.</p>
<h1>Chapter Five</h1>
<p>2. If three eat bread together, they should say an introductory blessing before the grace. It is as follows: if the table companions number from three to ten, one of them leads by saying: &#x201C;Let us bless him whose food we have eaten.&#x201D; And they respond: &#x201C;Blessed be he whose food we have eaten and through whose goodness we live.&#x201D; The leader then repeats: &#x201C;Blessed be he whose food we have eaten and through whose goodness we live.&#x201D;</p>
<p>4. If the table companions number ten or more, the introductory blessing includes the name of God. The leader says: &#x201C;Let us bless our God whose food we have eaten.&#x201D; And they respond: &#x201C;Blessed be our God whose food we have eaten and through whose goodness we live.&#x201D; The leader then repeats: &#x201C;Blessed be our God whose food we have eaten and through whose goodness we live.&#x201D; And he begins the grace.</p>
<p>15. If two eat together, each of them says grace for himself. If one knows the grace and the other does not, the one who knows should recite it aloud while the other should answer <italic>Amen</italic> after each blessing, thus fulfilling his duty.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>17. If one joins a group of people who are about to recite grace, and hears the leader say: &#x201C;Let us bless,&#x201D; he should respond: &#x201C;Blessed be he.&#x201D; If he hears the table companions answer: &#x201C;Blessed be he whose food we have eaten,&#x201D; he should respond <italic>Amen</italic>.</p>
<h1>Chapter Six</h1>
<p>1. Anyone who eats bread for which the blessing <italic>Hammotzi</italic> is required must wash his hands before and after the meal. Even if it is ordinary, unconsecrated bread and his hands are not soiled and he is unaware of any uncleanness, he must not eat until he has washed his hands.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. Anyone who washes his hands, whether before eating or reciting the <italic>Shema</italic> or the <italic>Amidah</italic> prayer, should first say: &#x201C;Blessed &#x2026; who hast sanctified us with thy commandments, and commanded us concerning the washing of the hands.&#x201D; This is an enactment by the sages, and we are commanded to obey them, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall be careful to do according to the instruction which they give you&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 17:11). No blessing is pronounced over the washing of hands after meals, since it is merely a precautionary measure against danger to health. One should therefore carefully wash his hands after meals.</p>
<p>20. One should dry his hands before eating. Anyone who eats without first drying his hands is like one who eats unclean bread.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Eight</h1>
<p>1. Over fruits growing on trees the initial blessing is &#x201C;who createst the fruit of the tree,&#x201D; and at the end, after the eating, &#x201C;who createst many living beings and the things they need.&#x201D; The five species of fruit mentioned in the Torah form an exception. They are: grapes, pomegranates, figs, olives and dates. After eating any of these, one blessing is recited that sums up the first three blessings of the grace after meals. Over fruit that grows on the ground and over green vegetables the initial blessing is &#x201C;who createst the fruit of the earth,&#x201D; and at the end, &#x201C;who createst many living beings.&#x201D; Over food that does not grow from the soil, such as meat, cheese, fish, eggs, water, milk and honey, the initial blessing is &#x201C;by whose word all things come into being,&#x201D; and at the end, &#x201C;who createst many living beings.&#x201D; A person who drinks water not to quench his thirst is not required to say a blessing before or after.</p>
<p>11. If one took a glass of strong drink [other than wine] and began the blessing, intending to say &#x201C;by whose word all things come into being,&#x201D; but made a mistake and said instead &#x201C;who createst the fruit of the vine,&#x201D; he should not be made to repeat the blessing correctly. So too, if he had in front of him fruits that grow from the soil, and he began reciting the blessing &#x201C;who createst the fruit of the earth&#x201D; but made a mistake and said instead &#x201C;who createst the fruit of the tree,&#x201D; he should not be made to repeat the blessing correctly; because when he utterd the divine name and declared the sovereignty of God, the essential part of the blessing, he intended to pronounce the blessing appropriate to that particular kind of food only. Since there was no error in the essential part of the blessing, even though he made a mistake at the end, he fulfilled his duty, and he should not be made to repeat the blessing correctly.</p>
<h1>Chapter Ten</h1>
<p>3. On hearing good news, one should say: &#x201C;Blessed art thou, Lord our God, King of the universe, who art good and beneficent.&#x201D; On hearing bad news, one should say: &#x201C;Blessed be the true Judge.&#x201D; One is required to bless goodheartedly for the evil, even as he blesses for the good joyously.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>4. When a person has attained good fortune or heard good news, even though the indications are that the good will cause him evil, he should say &#x201C;who art good and beneficent.&#x201D; So too, if disaster has overtaken him, or he has heard evil tidings, even though the indications are that the evil will result in good, he should say: &#x201C;Blessed be the true Judge.&#x201D; The blessings we recite refer to what has happened and not to future events.</p>
<p>26. In sum: One should always pray for what is still to come, and offer praise for past events, lauding and praising as much as possible. The more anyone praises God at all times, the more praise he deserves himself.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>SABBATH</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. To rest on the seventh day of the week is a positive command, for it is written: &#x201C;On the seventh day you shall rest&#x201D; (Exodus 23:12). Anyone who works on it negates a positive command while transgressing a negative command, for it is written: &#x201C;You shall do no work&#x201D; (Exodus 20:10). What penalty does he deserve for doing work? If he did it voluntarily, willfully, he deserves <italic>kareth;</italic> if he acted in the presence of witnesses who forewarned him, he is stoned; if he acted unintentionally, he must bring a standard sin-offering.</p>
<p>2. In Sabbath laws, wherever it is stated that someone deserves punishment for doing something, he deserves <italic>kareth;</italic> if he acted despite the forewarning of witnesses, he deserves stoning; if he committed the transgression inadvertently, he has to bring a sin-offering.</p>
<h1>Chapter Two</h1>
<p>1. Like all other precepts, the Sabbath is set aside where human life is in danger. For a person who is dangerously ill everything may be done on the Sabbath at the bidding of a local competent physician.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. If it has been estimated on the Sabbath that the patient will require a certain treatment for eight days, we must not say: &#x201C;Let us wait till evening, so as not to desecrate two Sabbaths.&#x201D; We should rather begin the treatment from that Sabbath day, and desecrate even a hundred Sabbaths for his sake. As long as he needs treatment in the presence of danger or possible danger, we should desecrate the Sabbath for his sake by lighting or extinguishing a lamp, by slaughtering, baking, cooking, heating water for drinking or bathing. The gist of it all is: in consideration of a person who is seriously ill, the Sabbath is like a weekday regarding every thing he needs.</p>
<p>3. These things should not be performed by non-Jews, minors, servants or women, lest they consider the Sabbath a light matter; instead, scholars and sages of Israel are to carry them out. One must not put off the desecration of the Sabbath in treating a serious patient, as it is written: &#x201C;If a man obeys them he shall live by them&#x201D; (Leviticus 18:5), but he must not die by them. From this you may infer that the laws of the Torah are not meant to wreak vengeance upon the world, but to bestow on it mercy, kindliness, and peace.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>4. If one feels pain in his eyes, being inflamed or affected by some disease, and pus, tears or blood flow from them, he is considered seriously ill, and we may break the Sabbath in preparing whatever cure he needs.</p>
<p>16. We must save an endangered life on the Sabbath without first asking for permission from a religious authority. The more speedily a man saves a life, the more praise he deserves. If, for example, he sees a child falling into the lake on the Sabbath, he may cast a net and pull him out, even though he is likely to catch some fish along with him.</p>
<p>22. If a person traveling in the desert fails to know which day is Sabbath, he should count six days from the day he sensed the error and keep the seventh day as holy, reciting on it the Sabbath blessings, and the <italic>Havdalah</italic> at the conclusion of the Sabbath. Each day, even the day he recites the <italic>Kiddush</italic> and the <italic>Havdalah</italic>, he is allowed to do just enough for maintaining himself alive; he must not do more than is necessary to sustain himself, since each day there is doubt about Sabbath.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Five</h1>
<p>1. The lighting of Sabbath lights is not of free choice, to light or not to light as one chooses, nor is it the kind of religious performance that an individual is not called upon to make a special effort to render, such as preparing an <italic>eruv</italic> in courtyards or washing the hands before eating. It is rather a duty, binding on men and women alike; they are obligated to have lamps burning in their homes on Sabbath eve. Even if one has nothing to eat, let him go begging at the doors, buy oil, and light a lamp, forming an integral part of Sabbath delight (<italic>oneg shabbath</italic>). Before lighting, one should recite a blessing: &#x201C;Blessed art thou, Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us with thy commandments, and commanded us to light the Sabbath lights.&#x201D; This is on the same principle that one recites a benediction over all duties introduced by the sages.</p>
<p>3. The Sabbath lights should be lit during daytime, before sunset. This duty is assigned to women rather than men, because women are usually at home doing housework. Nevertheless, the man should caution them, asking them about it, and telling them and the other members of his household, every Friday before it gets dark: &#x201C;Light the lights&#x0021;&#x201D; If it is doubtful whether darkness has already fallen or not, whether the Sabbath has or has not begun, the lights may not be lit.</p>
<p>4. The period from sunset until the time when three stars of medium size become visible is called twilight. It is uncertain whether this period is part of the preceding day or of the following night. We generally decide in favor of greater stringency on this score; hence, the Sabbath lights may not be lit during twilight.</p>
<h1>Chapter Twelve</h1>
<p>8. Transfer from one domain to another, in either direction, is one of the principal kinds of work [forbidden on the Sabbath].&#x2014; &#x2014; Also, it has been transmitted by tradition that if one carries an object in a public domain for a distance of four cubits (six feet) he is subject to punishment as if he transferred it from one domain to another.</p>
<p>9. One is not subject to punishment for transfer from one domain to another unless he transfers an object sizable enough to be of use either from a private domain to a public domain or from a public domain to a private domain, by detaching the object from the one domain and depositing it in the other. If, however, one detaches the object but does not deposit it, or deposits it without having first detached it, or transfers an object of less than the minimum size, he is free from liability. Similarly, if one transports an object for a distance of four cubits in a public domain, he is not subject to punishment unless he detaches the minimum size at one end and deposits it at the other.</p>
<p>10. He who throws or passes an object from one domain to another domain commits an act secondary to that of carrying an object from one domain to another, and is liable. Similarly, he who throws or passes an object a distance of four cubits in a public domain commits an act secondary to that of carrying an object from one domain to another, and is liable.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Fourteen</h1>
<p>1. Four domains are distinguishable in connection with the Sabbath: the private domain, the public domain, the semi-public domain, and the exempted region. What is meant by a public domain? Deserts, forests, market places, and thoroughfares opening into them, provided that any such public road is at least sixteen cubits wide and has no roof over it. What is regarded as a private domain? A mound ten or more handbreadths high and four or more handbreadths square; a groove ten or more handbreadths deep and four or more handbreadths square; and any area four or more handbreadths square enclosed within walls at least ten handbreadths high. If such an area is enclosed for residential purposes, it may even be many miles in extent. Thus a walled town, the gates of which are closed at night; alleys having walls on three sides and a side-post on the fourth; and a courtyard, a sheepfold or a sheep-pen enclosed for residential purposes &#x2014; &#x2014; all are genuine private domains.</p>
<p>4. What is meant by a semi-public domain? A mound four or more handbreadths square and between three and ten handbreadths high, for no semi-public domain can ever be more than ten handbreadths high or less than four handbreadths square; a groove four or more handbreadths square and between three and ten handbreadths deep; an area four or more handbreadths square enclosed by walls between three and ten handbreadths high; a nook adjacent to a public domain, that is, an area enclosed by walls on three sides and with its fourth side opening into a public domain; for example, an alley that has neither a side-post nor crossbeam on the fourth side; lakes, and arable land in both summer and winter &#x2014; &#x2014; all are semi-public domains.</p>
<p>7. What is meant by an exempted region? An area less than four handbreadths square the height of which is from three handbreadths as far as the sky, since whatever is less than three handbreadths high is deemed part of the ground.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>11. It is permissible to move objects throughout the whole of a private domain or an exempted region. Even if one of these two kinds of domain is several miles long, one may nevertheless move objects throughout the whole of it. In a public or semi-public domain, however, articles may not be moved more than four cubits at one time.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>12. Just as it is permissible to move articles throughout the whole of an exempted region, so also it is permissible to transfer articles from an exempted region to a private or public domain, or, needless to say, to a semi-public domain. One may likewise bring articles into an exempted region from a private or a public domain, or, needless to say, from a semi-public domain.</p>
<p>13. Just as it is forbidden to move articles throughout the whole of a semi-public domain, so also it is forbidden to transfer articles from a semi-public domain to a private or a public domain, or to bring articles into a semi-public domain from a private or a public domain. If, however, one does transfer an object from a semi-public domain, or into it, he is free from liability.</p>
<h1>Chapter Twenty-One</h1>
<p>1. It is written in the Torah &#x201C;you shall rest,&#x201D; implying that one must rest from doing things that are not even actual work. There are many things which the sages prohibited on the ground that they do not harmonize with the idea of rest. Some things are forbidden because they resemble prohibited kinds of work; others are forbidden as a preventive measure lest they may result in doing work that is forbidden under the penalty of stoning.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. Whoever levels grooves in the ground is guilty of plowing [on the Sabbath].&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>3. Women who play games with walnuts, almonds, and the like, must not play with these on the Sabbath, lest they level grooves [on the bare ground, which is forbidden]. It is forbidden to sweep the ground, lest one levels grooves, unless it is paved with stones.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>7. Fruit that dropped from a tree on the Sabbath may not be eaten until after the conclusion of the Sabbath, lest one may come to plucking growing fruit.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>9. One may not ride an animal on the Sabbath, lest he may come to cutting off a branch for use in guiding it.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Twenty-Four</h1>
<p>1. Some acts are forbidden on the Sabbath even though they neither resemble nor lead to prohibited work. Why then were they forbidden? Because it is written: &#x201C;If you refrain from following your business on the Sabbath, on my holy day&#x2026; If you honor it, not following your wonted ways, not pursuing your business, nor speaking of it&#x201D; (Isaiah 58:13). Hence, one is forbidden to go anywhere on the Sabbath in connection with his business, or even to talk about it. Thus one must not discuss with his partner what to sell on the next day, or what to buy, or how to build a certain house, or what merchandise to take to such-and-such a place. All this, and the like, is forbidden, for it is written &#x201C;nor speaking of it.&#x201D; That is to say, speaking of business on the Sabbath is forbidden; thinking of it, however, is permitted.</p>
<p>10. If anything is forbidden because it conflicts with the idea of rest, the prohibition does not apply during twilight but during the actual Sabbath day. Indeed, during twilight such things are permitted if they are needed for some religious purpose or emergency.&#x2014; &#x2014; But if there is no emergency involved, nor religious purpose, it is forbidden.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>12. The sages forbade the handling of certain articles on the Sabbath in the way they are handled on weekdays. Why did they enact such a prohibition? They reasoned as follows: Inasmuch as the prophets admonished us and charged us not to walk on the Sabbath in the manner we walk on weekdays, nor to converse on the Sabbath in the manner we converse on weekdays, since it is written &#x201C;nor speaking of it,&#x201D; so much the more should we refrain from handling articles on the Sabbath in the manner they are handled on weekdays, so that one should not regard the Sabbath as if it were a weekday and be led to lift and rearrange articles from one corner to another or from one room to another, or to put stones out of the way, or do similar things. Since one is at leisure and at home, he might look about for something to do; the result would be that he would not rest at all, thus disregarding what is written in the Torah, &#x201C;that they may rest&#x2026;&#x201D; (Exodus 23:12).</p>
<h1>Chapter Twenty-Five</h1>
<p>9. It is forbidden to handle on the Sabbath any article of which a man takes particular care lest it may depreciate in value, such as tools set apart as merchandise or exceptionally valuable things that one carefully protects from deterioration. Such things are referred to as <italic>set apart because of monetary loss</italic>.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>10. It is also forbidden to handle any article set apart because a prohibition is involved, such as a lamp which was lit for the Sabbath, or a <italic>menorah</italic> bearing a lighted candle, or a table with money on it, even if the light has gone out, and the money has fallen off the table.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Twenty-Seven</h1>
<p>1. If one goes out beyond the limit of the town on the Sabbath, he is lashed, for it is written: &#x201C;Let no man go out of his place on the seventh day&#x201D; (Exodus 16:29), and <italic>place</italic> in this verse signifies <italic>city limit</italic>. The Torah does not define the extent of this limit, but the Sages had a tradition that it is twelve miles, corresponding to the size of the Israelite camp in the wilderness; so this is what our teacher Moses meant to say to them: You shall not go out of the camp. The sages have enacted that one may not go out of the town beyond two thousand cubits, for two thousand cubits (0.7 miles) is defined as <italic>open land about the city</italic> (Numbers 35:5).</p>
<p>2. From this you may conclude that one may walk anywhere within the city on the Sabbath, even if it is large as Nineveh, whether it is walled or not. Furthermore, one may walk up to two thousand cubits outside of the city limits in any direction, the permitted area resembling a square tablet.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Twenty-Nine</h1>
<p>1. It is a positive duty to express the sanctity of the Sabbath day in words, for it is written: &#x201C;Remember to sanctify the Sabbath day&#x201D; (Exodus 20:8); that is to say, remember it in terms of praise and sanctification. One should remember it at its beginning and its conclusion by reciting the <italic>Kiddush</italic> when the Sabbath begins and the <italic>Havdalah</italic> when it ends.</p>
<p>5. One must not eat anything or drink wine once the Sabbath has arrived until he has recited the <italic>Kiddush</italic> benediction. Similarly, when the Sabbath has come to an end, one must not begin to eat or to drink, to do any work or even to taste anything at all, until he recites the <italic>Havdalah;</italic> one may, however, drink water.</p>
<p>6. The sages ordained that both the <italic>Kiddush</italic> and the <italic>Havdalah</italic> should be recited over wine. Even though he has already said the <italic>Havdalah</italic> as part of the evening service, he must recite it again over a cup of wine.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>8. The <italic>Kiddush</italic> should be recited only where the meal is served. This means that a person is not to recite the <italic>Kiddush</italic> in one house and eat in another; but if he has recited the <italic>Kiddush</italic> in one corner of a room, he may eat in another corner. Why then is the <italic>Kiddush</italic> recited in the synagogue? For the benefit of transients who eat and drink there.</p>
<p>18. Just as <italic>Kiddush</italic> is recited on Friday nights and <italic>Havdalah</italic> on Saturday nights, so also is <italic>Kiddush</italic> recited on festival nights, and <italic>Havdalah</italic> at the termination of festivals and <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, since all these are called <italic>Sabbaths of the Lord</italic> (Leviticus 23:38). <italic>Havdalah</italic> is recited also at the termination of a festival followed by <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Mo&#x2018;ed</italic> and at the termination of a Sabbath followed by a festival, but is not recited at the termination of a festival followed by a Sabbath.</p>
<p>29. Why is a blessing recited over fragrant spices at the conclusion of the Sabbath? It is to cheer the soul which is saddened at the departure of the Sabbath.</p>
<h1>Chapter Thirty</h1>
<p>1. Four things have been enjoined regarding the Sabbath: two on biblical authority, and two on the authority of the sages and clearly expressed by the Prophets. The Torah says: <italic>Remember</italic> (Exodus 20:8) and <italic>Observe</italic> (Deuteronomy 5:12); the Prophets clearly speak of <italic>Honor</italic> and <italic>Delight</italic>, as it is written: &#x201C;Call the Sabbath a delight, and the Lord&#x2019;s sacred day an honor&#x201D; (Isaiah 58:13).</p>
<p>2. What is meant by <italic>honor</italic>? The sages explained this by declaring that each person should wash his face, hands and feet with hot water on Friday in honor of the Sabbath, and then enwrap himself in a fringed garment and be seated with dignity in expectation of the Sabbath, receiving it as if he were coming out to meet the king. The ancient sages used to assemble their disciples on Friday, put on their best clothes, and say: &#x201C;Come, let us go out to meet King Sabbath.&#x201D;</p>
<p>3. We honor the Sabbath by wearing clean clothes. One must not wear weekday apparel on the Sabbath.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>4. In deference to the Sabbath, it is forbidden to arrange for a festive meal to take place on Friday; it is, however, permissible to eat and drink until nightfall. Nevertheless, in deference to the Sabbath, one should refrain from having a regular meal the entire afternoon, that he may enter the Sabbath with a desire to eat.</p>
<p>5. One should spread his Sabbath table on Friday, even if he requires no more than an olive&#x2019;s bulk of food; so too, he should set his table at the end of the Sabbath, even if he requires only a minute amount of food, in order to honor the Sabbath both at its entrance and departure. One should also set the house in order on Friday before sunset in honor of the Sabbath. A lamp should be lit, a table spread, and a bed properly arranged. All these are marks of respect for the Sabbath.</p>
<p>6. Even a person of high rank, who does not as a rule buy things at the market or engage in household chores, should himself perform what is necessary for the Sabbath, for this is his way of showing respect. Some of the ancient sages used to chop wood for the cooking; others used to cook or salt meat or twine wicks or light lamps; others used to go out and buy food and drinks for the Sabbath, although none of them would usually do such things on weekdays. The more anyone honors the Sabbath in this manner, the more praise he deserves.</p>
<p>7. What is meant by Sabbath delight? The sages explained this by declaring that one should prepare rich food and fragrant beverages for the Sabbath as much as he can afford. The more anyone spends for the Sabbath and the preparation of varied tasty food, the more praise he deserves. If, however, he cannot afford this, he may fulfill the Sabbath-delight requirement by preparing anything like a vegetable stew in honor of the Sabbath. He is not obligated to strain himself, begging from others, in order to eat much on the Sabbath. The ancient sages said: &#x201C;Rather make your Sabbath a weekday [with regard to festive meals] than be dependent on people.&#x201D;</p>
<p>8. If a person is comfortably rich and all his days are like Sabbath, he should eat different food on the Sabbath as a mark of distinction from the weekday food. If no change is possible, he should at least modify the schedule of his meals by eating later or earlier than usual.</p>
<p>9. One should eat three meals on the Sabbath: one in the evening, one in the morning, and one in the afternoon.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>11. One must not travel more than three Persian miles (12 miles) beginning on Friday morning, so that he may arrive home when the day is still high and prepare his Sabbath meals; otherwise, his family would not know that he is coming home, in order to prepare food for him. Needless to say, if he is going to be the guest of others he should arrive early; otherwise, he would embarrass them, since they would have nothing prepared that is suited for guests.</p>
<p>13. &#x2014; &#x2014; A sea voyage should not begin later than three days before the Sabbath, so that one&#x2019;s mind should be at ease before the Sabbath, and that he should not be excessively uncomfortable.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>ERUVIN</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. According to biblical law, if a courtyard has many tenants, each living in a house of his own, they may all move objects throughout the courtyard as well as from the houses into the courtyard and from the courtyard into the houses, because the entire courtyard is a single private domain, so that it is permissible to move objects through the whole of it. The same rule applies to an alley that has courtyards opening into it on three sides and the fourth side opening into the public road. By fastening at this fourth side a stake in the ground or a cross-beam above, the alley and the courts opening into it become a single private domain, so that all the residents of the alley are permitted to transfer objects throughout the alley as well as from the courtyards into the alley and from the alley into the courtyards.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. By rabbinical enactment, however, it is forbidden to transfer objects within a private domain where there is a separation of tenants, each living in a separate house, unless they create a symbolical fusion of all the tenants by preparing an <italic>eruv</italic> on Friday. It is all the same whether it is a courtyard, an alley or a town. This regulation was originated by Solomon and his legislative body.</p>
<p>6. What is the form of the prescribed <italic>eruv?</italic> It consists of a quantity of food contributed by the residents jointly and deposited on Friday, as if to say: &#x201C;We are all one fellowship, we all have the same food, and none of us keeps a domain distinct from that of his neighbor; just as we share equally the area of the <italic>eruv</italic>, so we have equal rights in each of the areas held by each individually; all of us are a single domain.&#x201D; This symbolical act serves to prevent people from falling into error and imagining that it is permissible to move objects from a private domain to a public domain.</p>
<p>7. The <italic>eruv</italic> prepared by the tenants of a courtyard is called <italic>courtyard eruv;</italic> the one prepared by the inhabitants of an alley or by all the residents of a town is called <italic>cooperative eruv</italic>.</p>
<p>16. How is a <italic>courtyard eruv</italic> prepared? A whole loaf of bread is collected from each house, and all the loaves are placed within a single container and deposited in one of the dwellings of the courtyard.&#x2014; &#x2014; When gathering and depositing the food contributed by the various tenants, one should recite this benediction: &#x201C;Blessed art thou, Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us with thy commandments, and commanded us concerning the precept of <italic>eruv</italic>.&#x201D; He should then add: &#x201C;By virtue of this <italic>eruv</italic>, all the residents of this courtyard will be permitted to transfer objects from house to house on the Sabbath.&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>17. How should an <italic>alley eruv</italic> be prepared? One collects the smallest quantity of food, the size of a dry fig, from each resident, or even less than that if there are many residents, and puts it all into a single container; he then deposits it in one of the courtyards of the alley or in one of the houses, &#x2014; &#x2014; saying: &#x201C;By virtue of this <italic>cooperative eruv</italic>, all residents of the alley are permitted to transfer objects between the courtyards and the alley on the Sabbath.&#x201D;</p>
<h1>Chapter Six</h1>
<p>24. Just as a blessing should be recited when either a courtyard <italic>eruv</italic> or an alley <italic>eruv</italic> is prepared, so should a blessing be recited over an <italic>eruv</italic> prepared between Sabbath limits. One should also add: &#x201C;By virtue of this <italic>eruv</italic>, I shall be permitted to walk two thousand cubits in any direction from this place.&#x201D; &#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Seven</h1>
<p>1. If a person goes out of town on Friday, stops at a certain spot within or at the end of the town&#x2019;s Sabbath limit, and says: &#x201C;Let my Sabbath resting-place be here,&#x201D; and then returns and spends the night in town, he is permitted to walk the next day two thousand cubits in any direction from that spot. The principle underlying the <italic>eruv</italic> for Sabbath limits is that of actually walking to the spot of the <italic>eruv</italic>. The sages, however, declared that even if one does not go out of town and does not stop at a certain spot, he may prepare the <italic>eruv</italic> by placing food for two meals at the site through a messenger, thus making things easier for the wealthy person who does not have to go himself, but may send his <italic>eruv</italic> by someone else to deposit it for him.</p>
<h1>Chapter Eight</h1>
<p>4. The same as it is forbidden to go beyond the Sabbath limits on the Sabbath, so it is forbidden to go beyond these limits on a holyday and on <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, &#x2014; &#x2014; but on a holyday it is permissible to transfer objects from one domain to another. Accordingly, we must lay an <italic>eruv</italic> for courts and form a <italic>cooperative eruv</italic> for alleys for <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> as well as for the Sabbath, and we must prepare an <italic>eruv</italic> for Sabbath limits for <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> and for holydays just as it is required for the Sabbath.</p>
<p>5. If a holyday occurs on the day before or after the Sabbath, or in the Diaspora where two days are observed instead of the one, a person may deposit two <italic>eruv</italic> symbols in two different directions, relying on whichever of the two he pleases on the first day, and upon the second <italic>eruv</italic> on the second day.&#x2014; &#x2014; This applies only to the two Diaspora holydays. The two days of <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic>, however, are considered as a single day, and only one <italic>eruv</italic> symbol in one direction is sufficient for both days.</p>
<p>14. If a holyday occurs on Friday, one must not prepare an <italic>eruv</italic> for courtyards nor for Sabbath limits on that day, but must do so on Thursday which is the day preceding the festival. If the two Diaspora holydays occur on Thursday and Friday, the <italic>eruv</italic> for Sabbath limits and the <italic>eruv</italic> for courtyards should be deposited on Wednesday.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>YOM KIPPUR REST</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>2. Whenever the penalty for work done willfully on the Sabbath is stoning, the penalty for doing it willfully on <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> is <italic>kareth;</italic> whenever the penalty on the Sabbath is a sin-offering, the penalty on <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> is equally a sin-offering. Anything that must not be done on the Sabbath, though it is not actual work, must not be done on <italic>Yom Kippur;</italic> if one nevertheless performs it, he receives punishment for disobedience, the same as he would for a similar act on the Sabbath.&#x2014; &#x2014; In brief: The only difference between the Sabbath and <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> in this respect is that the punishment for deliberate work on the Sabbath is stoning, while on <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> it is <italic>kareth</italic>.</p>
<p>4. Another positive command concerning <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> requires us to abstain from eating or drinking on that day, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall afflict yourselves&#x201D; (Leviticus 16:29). According to tradition, self-affliction signifies fasting. Whoever fasts on <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> fulfills a positive command, and whoever eats or drinks on it breaks a positive command and transgresses a negative command, as it is written: &#x201C;Whoever will not abstain and fast on that day shall be cut off&#x201D; (Leviticus 23:29).&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>6. The same as the rabbinically forbidden occupations on <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> apply to both day and night, so the rabbinical interpretation of <italic>affliction</italic> applies to both day and night. One must add to <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> parts of the preceding and following weekdays, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall abstain and fast from the sunset of the ninth day&#x201D; (Leviticus 23:32), which means: you shall begin fasting and afflicting yourselves from the sunset of the ninth day bordering on the tenth day. So too, at the termination of <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, one should prolong the fasting somewhat into the night of the eleventh day of <italic>Tishri</italic>, as it is written: &#x201C;From sunset of the ninth day to sunset of the tenth day you shall keep your Sabbath.&#x201D;</p>
<p>7. If women continue eating and drinking until nightfall, because they fail to know the rule about adding part of the weekday to the holyday, we should not protest against their action, lest they come to do so willfully; for it is impossible to assign a policeman to each homestead in order to caution its womenfolk. Hence, leave them alone. It is better to let them act unwittingly rather than willfully. The same applies to all similar cases.</p>
<h1>Chapter Two</h1>
<p>8. If a patient who is seriously ill asks for food on <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, he should be given to eat as he desires, until he says &#x201C;enough,&#x201D; even though competent physicians say that he does not need any food. If the patient says that he does not require food, and the physician says that he does, he should be fed in accordance with the physician&#x2019;s order, provided that the physician is competent. If one physician says that the patient needs food and another says that he does not, he should be given food.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>10. A boy of nine years &#x2014; &#x2014; should be trained to fast by the hours. For example, if he is used to eat at eight o&#x2019;clock in the morning, he should be fed at nine; if he is used to eat at nine, he should be fed at ten; the number of hours is to be increased in accordance with the physical strength of the boy. A boy or a girl of eleven should fast the entire day, according to a rabbinical enactment, so as to be trained in the observance of religious duties.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>FESTIVAL REST</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>4. Any act that is culpable on the Sabbath is punishable with lashing if it is committed on a holyday and not for the purpose of food. This does not include the prohibition against conveying objects from one domain to another, and the prohibition against starting a fire on the Sabbath. Since the transfer of objects from one domain to another has been made permissible for the purpose of preparing food, it has been made permissible even for purposes other than food preparation.&#x2014; &#x2014; So too, it is permissible to start a fire on a holyday even when it is not needed for the preparation of food. Other acts, however, are permissible on a holyday only when they are needed for the preparation of food; for example: slaughtering, baking, kneading, and the like. &#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>5. The sages have prohibited any work on a festival, even for the purpose of food, if it can be done on the day preceding the festival without loss or depreciation. Why have they enacted this prohibition? It has been enacted in order to prevent one from postponing the performance of tasks until the day of the festival, with the result that the whole day would be spent in performing these tasks, without having time to enjoy the festival or to eat.</p>
<p>6. For this very reason they have not prohibited the transfer of objects from one domain into another on a festival, even though each transfer is work that can be done on the day preceding the festival. Why then have they not prohibited it? In order to increase the festive rejoicing. One may therefore carry to and fro whatever he pleases, performing all that he has to do, without being like one whose hands are tied.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>21. We celebrate each of the festivals for two days outside Eretz Yisrael owing to custom, the second day being observed by rabbinical enactment as one of the things newly innovated in the Diaspora. Those who reside in Eretz Yisrael, however, observe only <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> for two days. In the section of this book concerning the rules of the Hebrew calendar, we shall explain the principle of this custom as well as the reason why <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> is celebrated for two days everywhere.</p>
<p>22. Even though the second day of a festival is only by rabbinic enactment, it equals the first day regarding anything that is forbidden.&#x2014; &#x2014; On the second day, just like the first day of a festival, funeral eulogies and fasting are forbidden, since one is required to rejoice. The only difference between the two days is that a dead person may be buried on the second day.</p>
<p>23. Thus, non-Jews should attend to the burial of one who died on the first day of the festival; but on the second day, Jewish people may attend to it,&#x2014; &#x2014; because the second day is regarded as an ordinary weekday as far as the burial of the dead is concerned. This applies even to the second day of <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic>.</p>
<h1>Chapter Four</h1>
<p>1. One may not start a fire on a holyday by rubbing sticks or stones or metal together, or by striking one against the other until fire is produced.&#x2014; &#x2014; On a holyday, one is permitted to start a fire only by means of an already existing fire; but not to start a new fire, since it is possible to start it on the day preceding the festival.</p>
<p>2. Although it is permissible on a holyday to light a fire for the purpose of food, it is forbidden to quench a fire that was lit for the purpose of food, because quenching a fire is work entirely unnecessary for the preparation of food.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Six</h1>
<p>1. On a holyday occurring on a Friday, one must not bake or cook food for the next day, the Sabbath. This prohibition is on rabbinic grounds, to prevent one from cooking on a holyday for a plain weekday. It stands to reason: if one must not cook food for the Sabbath, he certainly must not cook for a plain weekday. Accordingly, it is permissible to cook and bake on a holyday for the Sabbath if on the day preceding the festival one prepared a dish upon which to depend. The dish upon which he depends is called <italic>eruv tavshilin</italic> [a mingling of dishes designed for the Sabbath as well as for the immediately preceding holyday].</p>
<p>2. Why is it called <italic>eruv?</italic> The same as an <italic>eruv</italic>, prepared for courtyards and alleys on Friday, is a distinguishing mark preventing the residents from supposing that it is permissible to transfer objects from one domain to another, the <italic>eruv</italic> dish is a symbol and a reminder, lest some come to think vaguely that it is permissible to bake on a holyday what is not to be eaten on the same day. Hence, it is called the <italic>eruv</italic> of dishes.</p>
<p>8. When setting aside the <italic>eruv tavshilin</italic>, one should recite this blessing: &#x201C;Blessed art thou, Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us with thy commandments, and commanded us concerning the precept of <italic>eruv</italic>.&#x201D; He should add: &#x201C;By virtue of this <italic>eruv</italic> may I be permitted to bake and cook on the festival day tomorrow what we need for the Sabbath.&#x201D; If he also acts for others, he should say: &#x201C;May I and so-and-so be permitted,&#x201D; or: &#x201C;May all the inhabitants of the town be permitted to bake and cook on the festival for the Sabbath following it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>11. If the two days of a festival occur on Thursday and Friday, the <italic>eruv tavshilin</italic> should be prepared on Wednesday, the day immediately preceding the holyday.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>17. Lamentation and fasting are forbidden during the seven days of <italic>Pesa&#x1E25;</italic>, the eight days of <italic>Sukkoth</italic>, and the other holydays. One is required to rejoice and be cheerful on those days, along with his wife, children, grandchildren, and all his dependents, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall rejoice at your festival, you and your son and your daughter, your male and female servants&#x2026;&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 16:14). Although the festivity mentioned here refers to the peace-offering, as we are about to explain in the section concerning the rules of the pilgrim-offering, it includes the appropriate rejoicing of each man and his children and the members of his household.</p>
<p>18. The children, for example, should be given parched grain, nuts, and sweetmeats; the womenfolk should be presented with pretty clothes and trinkets according to one&#x2019;s means; the menfolk should eat meat and drink wine, for there is no real rejoicing without the use of meat and wine. While eating and drinking, one must feed the stranger, the orphan, the widow, and other poor unfortunates. Anyone, however, who locks the doors of his courtyard and eats and drinks along with his wife and children, without giving anything to eat and drink to the poor and the desperate, does not observe a religious celebration but indulges in the celebration of his stomach.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>20. When one eats and drinks on a festival, he should not unduly indulge in wine, merriment and frivolity, thinking that the more anyone partakes of this the more he observes a religious celebration. Drunkenness, jesting and levity are not rejoicing but madness and folly, and we are not charged to indulge in madness and folly but in the kind of rejoicing that finds expression in the worship of the Creator of all things, as it is written: &#x201C;Because you have not served the Lord your God with joy and with a glad heart for all your abundance&#x2026;&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 28:47). This proves that one should worship with joy, while it is impossible to serve God by jesting, frivolity, or drunkenness.</p>
<h1>Chapter Seven</h1>
<p>1. Although the Torah does not attach complete rest to the intermediate days of <italic>Pesa&#x1E25;</italic> and <italic>Sukkoth</italic>, it refers to them as <italic>sacred assembly</italic>, and the pilgrim-offering was presented in the Temple on those days; hence, work is forbidden on <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Mo&#x2018;ed</italic>, so that it may not be regarded as ordinary weekdays that are devoid of all sanctity. If anyone performs prohibited work on <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Mo&#x2018;ed</italic>, he is punished for disobeying a rabbinic enactment. However, not every type of work is prohibited on <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Mo&#x2018;ed</italic> as on a holyday, for the things that are prohibited on <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Mo&#x2018;ed</italic> are essentially designed to show that it is not like a weekday in every respect. Therefore, some kinds of work are forbidden on <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Mo&#x2018;ed</italic>, while others are permitted.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. If considerable loss is likely to result from neglecting any particular piece of work on <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Mo&#x2018;ed</italic>, it may be performed, provided that it does not involve excessive exertion.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>&#x1E24;AMETZ AND MATZAH</title>
<h1>Chapter Two</h1>
<p>1. The Torah commands us to put away the <italic>&#x1E25;ametz</italic> before the time when it is forbidden to eat it, as it is written: &#x201C;On the first day you shall put away leaven out of your houses&#x201D; (Exodus 12:15); according to the traditional interpretation, the <italic>first day</italic> in this verse refers to the fourteenth of <italic>Nisan</italic>. This is obvious from what is written in the Torah: &#x201C;You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven&#x201D; (Exodus 34:25), which means: &#x201C;You shall not slaughter the paschal lamb while leavened bread still exists&#x201D;; the time for slaughtering the paschal lamb is the afternoon of the fourteenth day of <italic>Nisan</italic>.</p>
<p>2. What is meant by the biblical term <italic>putting away</italic>? It means that one should regard the <italic>&#x1E25;ametz</italic> as nonexistent or as mere dust of the earth, impressing on his mind that he has no <italic>&#x1E25;ametz</italic> in his possession and that all the <italic>&#x1E25;ametz</italic> in his possession is equivalent to dust or something entirely useless.</p>
<p>3. By rabbinic enactment, one must search for <italic>&#x1E25;ametz</italic> in hiding-places and holes, and remove it from his entire domain. Also, by rabbinic enactment, one should search and remove the <italic>&#x1E25;ametz</italic> by lamplight at night, at the beginning of the night preceding the fourteenth day of <italic>Nisan</italic>, because all the people are then at home and lamplight is best for searching.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Four</h1>
<p>1. It is written in the Torah: &#x201C;No leavened bread shall be seen with you&#x201D; (Exodus 13:7). One might suppose that a man commits no transgression if he hides the <italic>&#x1E25;ametz</italic> or deposits it with a non-Jew; the Torah therefore says plainly: &#x201C;No leaven shall be found in your houses&#x201D; (Exodus 12:19), even if he has deposited or hidden it. Furthermore, one might suppose that a man transgresses only if the <italic>&#x1E25;ametz</italic> is inside his house, but if it is far from his house, in the fields or in another town, he does not transgress the law; the Torah therefore says plainly: &#x201C;In all your territory&#x201D; (13:7), meaning: wherever you have control.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>7. A Jew may say to a non-Jew: &#x201C;Instead of buying <italic>&#x1E25;ametz</italic> for one hundred <italic>zuzim</italic>, buy for two hundred; instead of buying it from a non-Jew, buy it from me; I may find it necessary to buy it back from you after Passover.&#x201D; However, one must not attach a condition to the act of selling or giving it to the non-Jew; if he does, he transgresses the law which prohibits <italic>&#x1E25;ametz</italic> from being seen or found during Passover.</p>
<p>8. If one keeps food that contains an admixture of <italic>&#x1E25;ametz</italic> during Passover, he transgresses the prohibition against its being seen or found.&#x2014; &#x2014; However, if the thing containing an admixture of <italic>&#x1E25;ametz</italic> is not edible, it is permissible to retain it during Passover.</p>
<h1>Chapter Six</h1>
<p>1. The Torah commands us to eat <italic>matzah</italic> on the night preceding the fifteenth day of <italic>Nisan</italic>, as it is written: &#x201C;In the evening, you shall eat unleavened bread&#x201D; (Exodus 12:18), everywhere and throughout time.&#x2014; &#x2014; By eating a piece of <italic>matzah</italic> the size of an olive [on the night of the fifteenth] one fulfills his duty.</p>
<p>10. All are required to eat <italic>matzah</italic> on the first night of Passover; this includes women and slaves. A child able to eat bread should be fed a piece of <italic>matzah</italic> the size of an olive [at least] in order to train him in the performance of religious duties.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>11. By rabbinic enactment, nothing may be eaten after the conclusion of the <italic>Seder</italic> meal, not even parched grain, nuts or the like. Even though one has eaten <italic>matzah</italic> first, and then some other food, fruits and the like, he should conclude the <italic>Seder</italic> meal by eating a piece of <italic>matzah</italic> the size of an olive and stop.</p>
<p>12. The sages have forbidden the eating of <italic>matzah</italic> on the day preceding <italic>Pesa&#x1E25;</italic>, in order to make it conspicuous at night.&#x2014; &#x2014; The ancient sages used to go hungry on the day preceding <italic>Pesa&#x1E25;</italic>, so that they might eat the <italic>matzah</italic> with appetite.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Seven</h1>
<p>1. According to a biblical positive command, we must tell on the night preceding the fifteenth day of <italic>Nisan</italic> all about the miracles and wonders that were performed for our forefathers in Egypt.&#x2014; &#x2014; Even great scholars are required to tell about the exodus from Egypt. Anyone who relates at length about the events that occurred deserves praise.</p>
<p>2. It is one&#x2019;s duty to inform the children even if they ask no questions, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall tell your son&#x201D; (Exodus 13:8). The father should instruct his son according to the child&#x2019;s understanding. For example, he should say to one small or foolish: &#x201C;My son, all of us were slaves in Egypt, like this maidservant or like this manservant, and on this night God redeemed and liberated us.&#x201D; If the son is grown up and intelligent, he should inform him about everything that happened to us in Egypt, and about the miracles that were wrought for us by our teacher Moses; all in accordance with the son&#x2019;s understanding.</p>
<p>3. On the first night of <italic>Pesa&#x1E25;</italic>, one should introduce some change at the table, so that the children who will notice it may ask, saying: &#x201C;Why is this night different from all other nights?&#x201D; And he in turn will reply: &#x201C;This is what happened.&#x201D; In what manner, for example, should he introduce a change? He may distribute parched grain or nuts to the children; remove the table from its usual place; snatch the unleavened bread from hand to hand, and so on. If he has no son, his wife should ask the questions; if he has no wife, they should ask one another: &#x201C;Why is this night different?&#x201D;&#x2014;even if they are all scholars. If one is alone, he should ask himself: &#x201C;Why is this night different?&#x201D;</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>SHOFAR</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. We are commanded in the Torah to hear the blasts of the <italic>shofar</italic> on <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic>, as it is written: &#x201C;It is a day for you to blow [the <italic>shofar</italic>]&#x201D; (Numbers 29:1). The <italic>shofar</italic> used on <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> and at the proclamation of a Jubilee must be the curved horn of a male sheep. All horns other than those of male sheep are disqualified. Although the Torah does not expressly prescribe the blasting of the <italic>shofar</italic> for <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic>, it does say regarding the proclamation of the Jubilee: &#x201C;You shall make proclamation with the blast of the <italic>shofar</italic> on the tenth day of the seventh month&#x2026;&#x201D; (Leviticus 25:9), and by way of tradition it has been inferred that just as the blast for the proclamation of the Jubilee must be that of a <italic>shofar</italic>, so must the blast on <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> be that of a <italic>shofar</italic>.</p>
<p>2. In the Temple, on <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic>, they used one <italic>shofar</italic>, flanked by two trumpets, the <italic>shofar</italic> sounding a long note and the trumpets a short note, since the duty of the day required the blast of a <italic>shofar</italic>. Why then were trumpets blown along with the <italic>shofar</italic>? Because it is written: &#x201C;With trumpets and the sound of the horn shout praise before the King, the Lord&#x201D; (Psalm 98:6). Elsewhere, only a <italic>shofar</italic> must be used on <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic>.</p>
<h1>Chapter Two</h1>
<p>1. All are required to hear the sounding of the <italic>shofar:</italic> priests, Levites, lay-Israelites, proselytes, and emancipated slaves; women, however, as well as slaves and children are exempt.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. Anyone who is not required to perform a certain religious duty cannot act in behalf of another person who is so required. Accordingly, if a woman or a minor blows the <italic>shofar</italic>, the man who hears the blast has not discharged his duty.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>4. If one practises blowing the <italic>shofar</italic>, he does not discharge his duty; neither does the person hearing him practise. If a listener intends to fulfill his duty, but the one who blows the <italic>shofar</italic> does not intend to act in the listener&#x2019;s behalf, or if the latter has the proper intention and the listener has not, he does not discharge his duty. Both the listener and the one who blows the <italic>shofar</italic> must have the proper intention.</p>
<p>6. If <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> occurs on a Sabbath, the <italic>shofar</italic> may not be sounded anywhere.&#x2014; &#x2014; Why should not the <italic>shofar</italic> be sounded? It is a preventive law, lest someone will pick up a <italic>shofar</italic> and take it to another person to sound it in his behalf, and in so doing he will carry it four cubits, or more, through a public domain, or he will transport it from one domain to another, and so incur a transgression involving the penalty of stoning. Although all are required to hear the blowing of the <italic>shofar</italic>, not everybody can sound it himself.</p>
<p>8. When the sages prohibited the sounding of the <italic>shofar</italic> on the Sabbath, they did so only in regard to places devoid of courts. As long as the Temple was in existence, and the Great Court was in Jerusalem, everybody in Jerusalem was permitted to sound the <italic>shofar</italic> on the Sabbath whenever the court was in session.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>9. &#x2014; &#x2014; Why was the <italic>shofar</italic> sounded on the Sabbath in the presence of a court? Because a court is scrupulous, and those who sound the <italic>shofar</italic> in its presence are not likely to carry it through a public domain, because the court keeps warning and informing the public.</p>
<p>10. At the present time, when we observe the festival for two days in the Diaspora, the <italic>shofar</italic> is sounded on the second day just as on the first day. If the first day coincides with the Sabbath &#x2014; &#x2014; the <italic>shofar</italic> is sounded on the second day only.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>SUKKAH</title>
<h1>Chapter Six</h1>
<p>1. Women, slaves, and small boys are exempt from the use of a <italic>sukkah</italic>.&#x2014; &#x2014; A boy of five or six, who is no longer in need of his mother&#x2019;s constant care, is bidden by the sages to use a <italic>sukkah</italic> as part of his training in the observance of religious duties.</p>
<p>2. Sick patients and their attendants are exempt from the use of a <italic>sukkah</italic>. This applies not only to persons who are seriously ill, but even to those who have a headache or sore eyes. A suffering person is exempt, but his attendants are not. What person may be regarded as suffering? One who cannot sleep in the <italic>sukkah</italic> because of the draft, the flies, the fleas, or the like, or because of the unpleasant smell.</p>
<p>5. How is the precept of dwelling in a <italic>sukkah</italic> to be observed? One should eat, drink, and dwell in the <italic>sukkah</italic> throughout the seven days of <italic>Sukkoth</italic>, both day and night, exactly as one dwells in his house during the entire year. Throughout the seven days, one should regard his house as temporary and his <italic>sukkah</italic> as permanent, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall dwell in booths for seven days&#x201D; (Leviticus 23:42).&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>12. Whenever one enters the <italic>sukkah</italic> to stay there, during the seven days, he should recite the following blessing before sitting down: &#x201C;Blessed art thou, Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us with thy commandments, and commanded us to dwell in the <italic>sukkah</italic>.&#x201D; On the first two nights of <italic>Sukkoth</italic>, one should recite first the blessing for the <italic>sukkah</italic> and then for the festive occasion [<italic>shehe&#x1E25;eyanu</italic>].</p>
<p>13. At this time, when festivals are observed for two days instead of one, we dwell in a <italic>sukkah</italic> for eight days instead of seven. On the eighth day, which is the first day of <italic>Shemini Atsereth</italic>, we dwell in the <italic>sukkah</italic> without reciting the blessing &#x201C;to dwell in the <italic>sukkah</italic>.&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>LULAV</title>
<h1>Chapter Seven</h1>
<p>1. The <italic>branches of palm trees</italic> specified in the Torah (Leviticus 23:40) are freshly sprouted twigs of a palm tree, before their leaves are spread apart; they resemble a rod, called <italic>lulav</italic>.</p>
<p>2. The <italic>fruit of goodly trees</italic> specified in the Torah is the <italic>ethrog</italic>. The <italic>boughs of leafy trees</italic> specified in the Torah refer to the myrtle, the leaves of which cover the wood; it has, for example, three or more leaves growing from each bud.</p>
<p>3. The <italic>willows of the brook</italic> specified in the Torah do not refer to every plant growing near a brook, but to a definite kind of plant called <italic>willows of the brook</italic>. Its leaf is elongated like a brook and has a smooth edge, and its twig is red. This is called <italic>aravah</italic>, willow. Most plants of this kind grow beside brooks, hence the term <italic>willows of the brook;</italic> even if it grows in the wilderness or on the mountains it is fit for use.</p>
<p>5. The four species [described above] constitute one precept, and the absence of any of these makes the others useless. All of them are included under the term <italic>lulav precept;</italic> their number should be neither decreased nor increased.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>7. How many should be taken of each species? One <italic>lulav</italic>, one <italic>ethrog</italic>, two twigs of willow, and three twigs of myrtle. If one wishes to increase the number of myrtle twigs so that the bunch should be larger, he may do so.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>13. We are required to wave the <italic>lulav</italic> on the first day of <italic>Sukkoth</italic> only, anywhere and at any time, even if this happens to be a Sabbath, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall take on the first day the fruit of goodly trees&#x201D; (Leviticus 23:40). Only in the Temple was the <italic>lulav</italic> waved on each of the seven days of <italic>Sukkoth</italic>, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days&#x2026;&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>15. After the destruction of the Temple it was ruled that the <italic>lulav</italic> should be waved on each of the seven days of the festival, in remembrance of the Temple usage.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>19. Anyone who is required to hear the <italic>shofar</italic> and to dwell in a <italic>sukkah</italic> is also required to wave the <italic>lulav;</italic> anyone who is exempt from hearing the <italic>shofar</italic> and dwelling in a <italic>sukkah</italic> is likewise exempt from waving the <italic>lulav</italic>. A little boy who knows how to shake the <italic>lulav</italic> is required to do so, by rabbinic rule, in order to train him in the observance of precepts.</p>
<p>24. The custom in Jerusalem used to be that an individual would leave home carrying his <italic>lulav</italic>, go to synagogue with <italic>lulav</italic> in hand, worship with <italic>lulav</italic> in hand, and then go to visit the sick and comfort the mourners with <italic>lulav</italic> still in hand. But when he was about to enter the school-house, he would send his <italic>lulav</italic> home with his son or servant (Sukkah 41b).</p>
<h1>Chapter Eight</h1>
<p>12. Although we are required to rejoice on all festivals, there was special rejoicing in the Temple during the <italic>Sukkoth</italic> festival, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days&#x201D; (Leviticus 23:40). How was this done? On the day preceding the first day of <italic>Sukkoth</italic>, a raised section for women and a lower section for men were prepared in the Temple, so that they might not mix. They began to celebrate at the conclusion of the first day of the festival. On each day of <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Mo&#x2018;ed</italic>, the celebrations began after the daily afternoon sacrifice and continued for the rest of the day and the entire night.</p>
<p>13. How was this celebration observed? Flutes were sounded, and harps, lyres and cymbals were played. Anyone who could play an instrument, played it; anyone who could sing, sang. They danced, clapping hands and leaping, each one to the best of his ability. However, this celebration was not permitted on the Sabbath or on the first day of the festival.</p>
<p>14. It was a religious duty to observe this celebration as much as possible. Ignorant individuals, or anybody who wished [to participate] took no leading part in it. Only great Jewish scholars, heads of academies, members of the Sanhedrin, elders, and men of piety and good deeds danced, clapped hands, made music and entertained in the Temple in the days of <italic>Sukkoth</italic>. Everyone else, men and women, came to watch and listen.</p>
<p>15. The joy which a person derives from doing good deeds and from loving God, who has commanded us to practise them, is a supreme form of divine worship. Anyone who refrains from experiencing this joy deserves punishment, as it is written: &#x201C;Because you have not served the Lord your God with joy and with a glad heart&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 28:47). Anyone who is arrogant and insists on self-glory on such occasions is both a sinner and a fool. King Solomon had this in mind when he said: &#x201C;Do not glorify yourself in the presence of the King&#x201D; (Proverbs 25:6). On the other hand, anyone who humbles himself on such occasions is indeed great and honored, for he serves the Lord out of love. David, King of Israel, expressed this thought when he said: &#x201C;I will make myself even more contemptible than this, humbling myself in my own eyes&#x201D; (II Samuel 6:22). True greatness and honor are attained only by rejoicing before the Lord, as it is written: &#x201C;King David was leaping and dancing before the Lord&#x201D; (II Samuel 6:16).</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>SHEKALIM</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. The Torah commands each member of Israel to contribute half a shekel each year. Even a poor man who lives on charity is required to give; he borrows or sells the garment off his back and contributes a silver half-shekel, as it is written: &#x201C;The rich shall not give more and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel&#x201D; (Exodus 30:15). One must not pay the half-shekel in several instalments, a little today and a little tomorrow, but has to contribute it all at once in a single payment.</p>
<p>5. This half-shekel requirement signifies that one is to give half of the contemporary standard coin, even if this coin happens to be larger than the sanctuary standard of a shekel. However, one is never allowed to pay less than the half-shekel used in the time of Moses our teacher, which weighed one hundred and fifty barley grains.</p>
<p>7. All are required to contribute half a shekel: priests, Levites, Israelites, proselytes, and emancipated slaves; but not women, slaves or minors. If these, however, offer to pay, the half-shekel is accepted from them. If non-Jews offer it, it is not accepted from them. If the father of a minor begins paying the half-shekel on behalf of his son, he is no longer free to discontinue it, but must go on paying each year until his son grows up and pays for himself.</p>
<p>8. The shekel dues are applicable only when the Temple is in existence. As long as the Temple was in existence, shekel dues were contributed both in Eretz Yisrael and outside it. After the destruction of the Temple, the half-shekel payments ceased even within Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p>9. On the first of <italic>Adar</italic> announcement is made concerning the payment of shekel dues, so that each individual may prepare his half-shekel and be ready to pay it. On the fifteenth of <italic>Adar</italic>, the money-changers sit down in each town and gently request everyone to pay. They accept from everyone who offers them the half-shekel, without using compulsion against anyone who does not. On the twenty-fifth of <italic>Adar</italic>, they sit down in the Temple to enforce collection. From then on, payment is obtained by force from those who have not yet paid. Anyone who refuses to pay is subjected to compulsion by levy; a pledge is taken from him forcibly, even the garment he is wearing.</p>
<h1>Chapter Two</h1>
<p>4. When each town has completed the collection of the shekel dues, they are sent by messengers to the Temple; it is permissible to convert them into gold denars to facilitate transportation. All shekel dues are gathered in the Temple and deposited in one of the Temple chambers, the doors of which are locked with keys and sealed with seals. Three large baskets of nine <italic>seah</italic> each are filled with collected shekel dues, and the remainder is left in the chamber. The half-shekels in the baskets are called <italic>Temple fund;</italic> the surplus is called <italic>the residue of the chamber</italic>.</p>
<p>5. Three times a year sums are taken from the Temple treasury: on <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh Nisan</italic>, on <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh Tishri</italic>, before or after the festival, and on the fifteenth day before <italic>Shavuoth</italic>.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>6. &#x2014; &#x2014; If the shekel dues in the three large baskets were insufficient and all spent before <italic>Nisan</italic>, sums were taken again from the residue of the chamber.</p>
<p>10. The priest entering the chamber to take up the heave offering must not wear a garment in which money can be concealed, nor shoes, sandals, a phylactery, or an amulet, that people should not become suspicious and say: &#x201C;He has concealed money from the chamber on his person while taking up the heave offering.&#x201D; Besides, conversation was maintained with him from the moment he entered the chamber until he left it, to prevent him from putting coins in his mouth. Yet, despite all these precautions, a poor man or a greedy person should not take up the heave offering, because of possible suspicion, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall be clear before the Lord and before Israel&#x201D; (Numbers 32:22).</p>
<h1>Chapter Four</h1>
<p>1. What is done with the Temple fund? It is used for the purchase of the daily offerings, the additional offerings, and all other public offerings with their libations, as well as the salt with which all sacrifices were salted, and the firewood, if it has not been brought as a gift and is obtainable only for money.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>7. The official proofreaders of biblical manuscripts in Jerusalem, and the judges who tried robbers in Jerusalem, received their salaries out of the Temple fund. How much did they receive? Ninety <italic>maneh</italic> (9,000 <italic>zuz</italic>) annually. If this was insufficient for their maintenance, they were given, whether they wanted it or not, enough additional pay to provide for their own needs and the needs of their wives and children and other members of their households.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>NEW-MOON SANCTIFICATION</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. The months of the year are lunar months &#x2014; &#x2014; and the years we reckon are solar years.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. The solar year exceeds the lunar year by eleven days, approximately. Hence, whenever this excess accumulates to about thirty days, somewhat more or less, one month is added and the year is made up of thirteen months and is called leap year. The year cannot consist of twelve months plus several days, because it is written: &#x201C;Months of the year&#x201D; (Exodus 12:2), implying that the year should be reckoned by months and not by days.</p>
<p>3. The moon is invisible for about two days each month, or somewhat more or less: about one day at the end of the old month before it is close to the sun and about one day after its conjunction with the sun, when it reappears in the evening in the west. The night on which it becomes visible in the west after having disappeared is the beginning of the month. Twenty-nine days are counted from that day on. If the new moon appears on the night of the thirtieth day, then the thirtieth day is the first day of the new month. If it does not appear on that night, the thirtieth day belongs to the past month and the thirty-first day is the first day of the new month. We pay no attention as to whether or not the moon appeared on the night of the thirty-first day, because the lunar month never exceeds thirty days.</p>
<p>4. If the moon appears on the night of the thirtieth day, the past month has twenty-nine days and is called defective month. If the moon does not appear on the night of the thirtieth day, the past month has thirty days and is called intercalated month or full month.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>5. The observation of the new moon is not entrusted to every individual, as in the case of the regular weekly Sabbath where anyone may count six days and rest on the seventh, but the authority is given to the court only, to sanctify and proclaim the day as the first of the month. The day proclaimed by the court is <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh</italic>, as it is written: &#x201C;This month shall be to you&#x201D; (Exodus 12:2), implying that the evidence in this matter is surrendered to <italic>you</italic> [members of the court].</p>
<p>6. Like astronomers who engage in calculation and know the positions and motions of the stars, the Jewish court calculates and investigates minutely so as to know if it is or is not possible for the new moon to be visible in its time, which is the night of the thirtieth day. If the members of the court found that it would be possible, they had to wait in the court house for the arrival of witnesses throughout the thirtieth day. If witnesses arrived and were duly examined and tested and found trustworthy, the thirtieth day was sanctified as the first day of the new month. If the new moon did not appear and no witnesses arrived, that day was counted as the thirtieth of the past month which became an intercalated month. If, however, the members of the court knew by calculation that the new moon could not possibly be seen, they were not required to sit and wait for the arrival of witnesses the thirtieth day. If witnesses did come to testify that they had seen the new moon, it was certain that they were false witnesses, or that a semblance of the new moon appeared to them through the clouds, and was not the real moon.</p>
<p>8. The new moon days and the leap years are computed and proclaimed only in Eretz Yisrael, as it is written: &#x201C;Out of Zion shall go forth instruction, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem&#x201D; (Isaiah 2:3). If, however, a great scholar was ordained in Eretz Yisrael and then emigrated to another country without leaving in Eretz Yisrael anyone equal to him in learning, he is permitted to compute and proclaim the new moon days and leap years outside the Land of Israel.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Two</h1>
<p>1. Two trustworthy men only are qualified to testify concerning the new moon, men that are fit to bear witness in any legal case. Women and slaves, however, are not eligible to bear witness, and their testimony is not accepted.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. According to the biblical law, the court is not required to be too strict in accepting evidence concerning the new moon. If the court sanctified the new moon on the evidence of two witnesses, who were found to have given false testimony, it remains sanctified. Originally, therefore, the court used to accept evidence concerning the new moon from any Jewish man, proceeding upon the assumption that each Israelite is qualified as a witness unless he is known to be disqualified. However, after the evil doings of the heretics, who tried to confuse the sages by hiring false witnesses to bear evidence that they had observed the new moon, though they had not seen it, the sages enacted that evidence concerning the new moon should not be admitted unless the witnesses were known to the court as trustworthy men, and that the witnesses should be thoroughly tested and examined.</p>
<p>3. For this reason, if the court does not know the men who saw the new moon, the people of the town should send along with the witnesses who saw the new moon other witnesses to certify them before the court, vouching for their being trustworthy men; only then is their evidence accepted.</p>
<p>4. The court employs methods of calculation similar to those used by astronomers, ascertaining whether the new moon of the forthcoming month will be seen to the north or to the south of the sun, whether it will be wide or narrow, and in which direction the tips of the horns will point. When the witnesses arrive to testify, the court examines them: Where did you see the new moon, to the north or to the south? In which direction did its horns point? How high was its altitude, in the estimate of your eyes, and how wide its latitude? If their evidence has been found to conform with the results of astronomical calculation, it is accepted; but if it has been found not to conform, it is rejected.</p>
<p>6. If the witnesses said: &#x201C;We noticed the moon unintentionally, but failed to see it again when we looked and wanted to see it in order to bear witness,&#x201D; their testimony is not sufficient, and the court does not sanctify the new moon on the strength of it, owing to the suspicion that combined clouds produced the illusion of a moon and then disappeared.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>7. The evidence concerning the new moon is accepted in this fashion: Anyone who is qualified to bear witness comes to the courthouse sfter seeing the new moon. Then the court assembles them all to one place; they are entertained generously with large meals, so that people may make it their habit to come. The first pair of witnesses to arrive are examined first, as we have described. The elder of the two witnesses is brought in and questioned. If his testimony is found to correspond to the data of calculation, the other one is called in. If both testimonies are found to be in agreement, their evidence is declared valid. The other pairs of witnesses are asked only a few main questions, not because their testimony is needed, but that they should not go away disappointed at not being asked, and that they may make it their habit to come.</p>
<p>8. Thereupon, when the evidence has been sustained, the chief justice of the court proclaims <italic>Mekuddash&#x0021;</italic> [the new moon is sanctified], and after him all the people present respond: <italic>Mekuddash&#x0021; Mekuddash&#x0021;</italic> Only a court of three may carry out the calculation and the sanctification of the new moon. The formal sanctification of the new moon is proclaimed only when the new moon has been observed in its proper time; and this must be done at daytime. If it was done at night, the sanctification is not valid. &#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>10. If the court sanctified the new moon erroneously, incorrectly or forcibly, the sanctification remains valid and everyone must fix the dates of the festivals in accordance with the day in which the members of the court sanctified the new moon. Even if someone knows that they have made a mistake, he must rely on their decision, because the authority in this matter rests only with them. He who has commanded us to observe the festivals has also commanded us to depend on them, as it is written: &#x201C;The festivals &#x2026; which you shall proclaim&#x201D; (Leviticus 23:2).</p>
<h1>Chapter Three</h1>
<p>2. Witnesses who saw the new moon must go to the court to bear witness even if it happens to be a Sabbath, as it is written: &#x201C;Which you shall proclaim, each in its proper season&#x201D; (Leviticus 23:4); and wherever <italic>proper season</italic> is used in a biblical command, it supersedes the Sabbath. For this reason, they are allowed to break the Sabbath only when the new moon of <italic>Nisan</italic> and that of <italic>Tishri</italic> are concerned, to determine the time of the festivals. When the Temple was still in existence, the additional offering presented on <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh</italic> superseded the Sabbath, which was profaned on account of any <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh</italic> coinciding with it.</p>
<p>8. Originally, when the court sanctified the new moon, they used to light flares on the tops of the mountains, so that those who lived far away might know of it. But when the Samaritans began to cause trouble, by kindling misleading flares, it was enacted that messengers should go forth to inform the public.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>9. Messengers were sent out to proclaim the beginning of six months: <italic>Nisan</italic>, on account of <italic>Pesa&#x1E25;; Av</italic>, on account of the fast of <italic>Tish&#x2019;ah b&#x2019;Av; Elul</italic>, because of <italic>Rosh Hashanah;</italic>&#x2014; &#x2014; <italic>Tishri</italic>, because of <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> and <italic>Sukkoth; Kislev</italic>, because of <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah; Adar</italic>, because of <italic>Purim</italic>. When the Temple was still in existence, messengers would go forth to inform about the beginning of <italic>Iyyar</italic>, because of <italic>Pesa&#x1E25; Sheni</italic> [observed on the fourteenth of <italic>Iyyar</italic>].</p>
<h1>Chapter Four</h1>
<p>1. A leap year is a year to which an extra month is added. Only <italic>Adar</italic> is the month that is ever added, so that a leap year has two months of <italic>Adar:</italic> a first <italic>Adar</italic> and a second <italic>Adar</italic>. Why is just this month added? Because of the spring season, so that <italic>Pesa&#x1E25;</italic> should be observed during the barley season, as it is written: &#x201C;Observe the month of <italic>Aviv</italic>, and keep the Passover&#x2026;&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 16:1), implying that this month of <italic>Nisan</italic> should occur during the spring. Without the addition of this month of <italic>Adar</italic>, Passover would occur sometimes in the summer and sometimes in the rainy season [of winter].</p>
<p>9. A year should be intercalated only by those who were invited to participate in the act of intercalation. How is this done? The chief justice of the Supreme Court should say to certain members of the Sanhedrin: &#x201C;You are invited to come to such and such a place, that we may together calculate and find out whether this year should be intercalated or not.&#x201D; Only those invited may decide about the intercalation of the year.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>10. If two of the five members of the council say that the year should be intercalated, and three say that it should not, the minority of two does not count. If three say that it should be intercalated, and two say that it should not, two members are added to the council from among those who have been invited, and they discuss the matter and decide with a panel of seven. If all seven of them unanimously decide to intercalate or not to intercalate, their decision is adhered to; but if they disagree, the opinion of the majority is followed.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>11. A king or a high priest must not be placed as a member of the council on the intercalation of the year. A king is not eligible on account of his armies and far-flung campaigns, lest he may be inclined to intercalate or not to intercalate in their interests. A high priest is not eligible because he may be concerned about the cold weather; he may not be inclined to intercalate, so that the month of <italic>Tishri</italic> should not occur in the cold season, when he must take five baths of purification on <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>.</p>
<p>12. If the chief justice of the Supreme Court, who bears the title of <italic>Nasi</italic>, happens to be away on a distant trip, the year can be intercalated only on condition that the <italic>Nasi</italic> will consent. If he arrived and gave his consent, the intercalation remains valid; if he did not consent, the intercalation is invalid.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Five</h1>
<p>1. All that we have said concerning the fixation of <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh</italic> on the basis of observing the new moon, and concerning intercalation of the year because of the season or because of some other necessity, is applicable only to the Sanhedrin in Eretz Yisrael or to the members of the court who were ordained in Eretz Yisrael, to whom the Sanhedrin gave permission to act. Moses and Aaron were told: &#x201C;This month shall be to you the beginning of months&#x201D; (Exodus 12:2), and the sages have derived from an oral tradition going back to our teacher Moses that the meaning of this verse is: This evidence shall rest with you and your successors. When, however, no Sanhedrin exists in Eretz Yisrael, the new-moon days and the leap years are determined only by such methods of calculation as we are employing today.</p>
<p>3. When did all Israel begin to use this method of calculation? During the last generation of the talmudic sages, when Eretz Yisrael was in ruins and no established court had survived there. In the times of [the Tannaim] the sages of the Mishnah, and also in the period of the talmudic sages prior to Abbayy&#x00E9; and Rava, the people relied on the courts of Eretz Yisrael for setting the calendar.</p>
<p>4. When the Sanhedrin still existed and the calendar was set by observation, the inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael, and the places that could be reached by the messengers of <italic>Tishri</italic> on time, observed each festival one day only; whereas those who lived in more distant places that could not be reached by the messengers of <italic>Tishri</italic> in time observed two days, because of doubt, since they failed to know which day had been proclaimed as <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh</italic> by the men of Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p>5. At the present time, when no Sanhedrin and court of Eretz Yisrael are in existence, we set the calendar by calculation. It might be logical that the Jewish people everywhere, even those living in remote places of the Diaspora, should observe one day only [as holyday] just as the inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael do, in view of the same calculation followed by all in determining the calendar. The sages, however, have made it a rule that the people must carefully follow the custom of their forefathers.</p>
<p>6. Accordingly, the localities which could not be reached on time by the messengers sent to announce <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh Tishri</italic> must observe two days even at present, just as they used to when the men of Eretz Yisrael determined the calendar on the basis of observation. But the residents of Eretz Yisrael at our time should continue to keep only one day, according to their [ancient] custom, for they never observed two days. Hence, it becomes evident that the second day of the festival that we observe in the Diaspora nowadays is something enacted by the sages.</p>
<p>7. When the fixing of the month was accomplished by the observation method, the majority of the inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael observed <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> for two days, because they were in doubt as to which day had been declared as new-moon day, since the messengers could not go forth on a holyday [and <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> coincides with the first day of the month].</p>
<p>8. Moreover, even in Jerusalem itself, which was the seat of the court, it frequently happened that <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> was observed for two days. If witnesses failed to arrive on the thirtieth day of <italic>Elul</italic>, the people were accustomed to celebrate it as <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic>, while waiting for witnesses to appear, observing the following day likewise as a holyday. Since they used to keep two days <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> even when the method of observation was in use, the sages ordained that even the citizens of Eretz Yisrael should keep it for two days always, at the present time when the calendar is determined by computation. You may thus infer that even the second day of <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> is based on the authority of the sages.</p>
<p>9. The observance of one day of the other festivals does not depend upon the proximity of a location to Jerusalem. For example, a locality at a distance of five days&#x2019; journey or less from Jerusalem could certainly have been reached by the messengers in time; yet it cannot be said that the residents of this place should observe only one day.&#x2014; &#x2014; Possibly no messengers were ever sent out to this place because there were no Jews there, and when the calendar began to be determined by computation the place was settled by Jews who were required to observe two days by their previous custom. Or else, no messengers ever came to this place because of insecurity in travel, as was the case between Judea and Galilee during the period of [the Tannaim] the sages of the Mishnah, or, because non-Jews, living along the road, would prevent the messengers from passing through the area.</p>
<p>10. If this matter of observing one day were to depend upon the proximity to Jerusalem, all the Jews of Egypt would observe only one day, since the messengers of <italic>Tishri</italic> could have reached them in time. The distance between Jerusalem and Egypt, by way of Ashkelon, is indeed only a matter of eight days&#x2019; journey or less. The same applies to most places in Syria. Hence you may infer that the thing does not depend upon the proximity of a place.</p>
<p>13. When we nowadays compute, everyone in his own town, declaring such and such a date to be <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh</italic> or a festival, we do not rely upon our own calculation and determination, for it is not permissible to intercalate the years or to determine new-moon days outside of Eretz Yisrael; we may rely only on the computation and fixation performed by the inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael. Our own computation is only for the purpose of making it known to the public; since we are aware that in Eretz Yisrael they use the same method of computation, we calculate in order to find out what day it is that has been determined by the residents of Eretz Yisrael.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Six</h1>
<p>1. When the fixing of the new month used to be based upon the observation process, the sages calculated with great precision to ascertain the moment at which the conjunction of the moon with the sun occurred, according to the practice of the astronomers, so as to know whether the moon could appear on the night of the thirtieth day or not.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. The day and the night consist of twenty-four hours: twelve for the day and twelve for the night. The hour is divided into one thousand and eighty parts. Why is the hour divided into this number of parts? Because this number may be divided by two, four, eight, three, six, nine, five, and ten, without a remainder; these denominators may again be divided into many other parts.</p>
<p>3. According to these figures, the interval between two conjunctions of moon and sun at their average motion is twenty-nine days and twelve hours of the thirtieth day, beginning with the night of that day, and seven hundred ninety-three parts of the thirteenth hour. That is the time between one <italic>molad</italic> [conjunction] and the other, and that is the duration of the lunar month.</p>
<p>4. The lunar year consists of twelve months of the length just defined, totaling three hundred fifty-four days, eight hours, and eight hundred seventy-six parts; but leap year, consisting of thirteen months, totals three hundred eighty-three days, twenty-one hours, and five hundred eighty-nine parts. The solar year consists of three hundred sixty-five days and six hours. Hence, the excess of the solar year over the lunar year totals ten days, twenty-one hours, two hundred and four parts.</p>
<p>5. If you subtract twenty-eight days from the lunar month, or four weeks consisting of seven days each, there will remain one day, twelve hours, and seven hundred ninety-three parts, symbolized by 1d 12h 793p. This is the remainder of the lunar month. Similarly, if you subtract the multiples of seven from the number of days of the lunar year, there will remain, in the case of an ordinary year, four days, eight hours, and eight hundred seventy-six parts, symbolized by 4d 8h 876p. This is the remainder of an ordinary lunar year. In the case of a leap year, the remainder is five days, twenty-one hours, and five hundred twenty-nine parts,, symbolized by 5d 21h 589p.</p>
<p>6. Hence, if you know the <italic>molad</italic> [the moment in which the new moon appears] of a given month, you can obtain the next <italic>molad</italic> by adding 1d 12h 793p, and you will know on which day of the week, in which hour, and in which fraction of the hour it will occur. For example: Suppose the <italic>molad</italic> of <italic>Nisan</italic> occurred in the daytime of a Sunday the fifth hour and one hundred seven parts of an hour, symbolized by 1d 5h 107p.</p>
<p>7. When you add to this the remainder of the lunar month, which is 1d 12h 793p, the <italic>molad</italic> of <italic>Iyyar</italic> will emerge, occurring at five hours and nine hundred parts on the night of Tuesday, symbolized by 3d 5h 900p. The same applies to month after month until the end of time.</p>
<p>10. Each group of nineteen years, consisting of seven leap years and twelve ordinary years, is called <italic>ma&#x1E25;zor</italic> (cycle).&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Seven</h1>
<p>1. According to this computation, <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh Tishri</italic> (<italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic>) cannot occur on Sunday, Wednesday, or Friday, symbolized by 1-4-6. If the <italic>molad</italic> of <italic>Tishri</italic> occurs on one of these three days, the following day is proclaimed as the first day of the month. Suppose, for example, that the <italic>molad</italic> occurs on Sunday, the first day of the month is postponed to Monday; if the <italic>molad</italic> occurs on Wednesday, it is postponed to Thursday; if it occurs on Friday, it is posponed to Saturday.</p>
<p>2. Similarly, if the <italic>molad</italic> of <italic>Tishri</italic> occurs at noon or later, the first day of the month is postponed to the following day. Thus, for example, if the <italic>molad</italic> occurs on Monday at noon or later, Tuesday is made to be the first day of the month. But if the <italic>molad</italic> occurs before noon, even though by one fraction of an hour, the very day of the <italic>molad</italic> is declared as the first day of the month, that is, if that day does not happen to be 1-4-6.</p>
<h1>Chapter Eight</h1>
<p>1. The lunar month consists of twenty-nine days and a half plus seven hundred ninety-three parts of an hour, as we have already pointed out. But one cannot assume that the month should begin in the middle of the day, so that one part of the day would belong to the past month while the other part would belong to the next month. It is written: &#x201C;A month of days&#x201D; (Numbers 11:20), and the traditional interpretation of this verse has been that the month should be reckoned by days and not by hours.</p>
<p>2. For this reason, the lunar months are adjusted to an alternate succession of one defective and one full month. The defective month contains twenty-nine days only, although the lunar month is longer than that by [more than twelve] hours; and the full month contains thirty days, although the lunar month is several hours shorter. It is because we must count the month by full days and not by hours.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>FASTS</title>
<h1>Chapter Five</h1>
<p>1. There are days that all the people of Israel observe as fasts on account of the tragic events which occurred on them, the purpose being to appeal to the hearts and to lay open the paths of repentance. This serves as a reminder of our evil doings, and the deeds of our fathers which were like ours now, resulting in the afflictions endured by them and by us. By remembering these things we are likely to repent and do right, as it is written: &#x201C;They shall confess their sins and the sins of their fathers&#x2026;&#x201D; (Leviticus 26:40).</p>
<p>2. They are as follows: The third day of <italic>Tishri</italic>, on which Gedaliah the son of Ahikam was slain, the last ember of Judea&#x2019;s independence was extinguished, and her dispersion was made complete. The tenth of <italic>Teveth</italic>, on which wicked Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, pressed on Jerusalem and placed it under siege and stress. The seventeenth day of <italic>Tammuz</italic>, on which five things occurred: the tablets were broken, the daily offering was discontinued before the destruction of the first Temple, the walls of Jerusalem were breached before the destruction of the second Temple, wicked Apostomos burned the Torah and set up an idol in the Temple.</p>
<p>3. The ninth of <italic>Av</italic>, on which five things happened: it was decreed in the wilderness that the people of Israel were not to enter the promised land; the Temple was destroyed both the first time and the second time, and a great city named Betar was captured. It was inhabited by tens of thousands of Jews. They had a great ruler, thought by all of them, including great scholars, to be King Messiah. But he fell into the hands of [the Roman] pagans, who killed them all, a calamity as great as the destruction of the Temple. On that day, the ninth of <italic>Av</italic>, predestined for Israel&#x2019;s reverses, the wicked Turnus Rufus plowed up the Temple site and its surroundings, in fulfillment of the prophetic utterance: &#x201C;Zion shall be plowed up like a field&#x201D; (Jeremiah 26:18).</p>
<p>4. These four fast days are distinctly mentioned in the prophetic books: &#x201C;The fast of the fourth month, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth&#x201D; (Zechariah 8:19). The fast of the fourth month is the seventeenth of <italic>Tammuz</italic>, which is in the fourth month; the fast of the fifth is <italic>Tish&#x2018;ah b&#x2019;Av</italic>, which is in the fifth month; the fast of the seventh is the third of <italic>Tishri</italic>, which is in the seventh month; and the fast of the tenth is the tenth of <italic>Teveth</italic>, which is in the tenth month.</p>
<p>5. All the Jewish people are accustomed nowadays to fast on the thirteenth day of <italic>Adar</italic> in remembrance of the fast observed in the days of Haman, as it is written: &#x201C;Regarding their fasting and wailing&#x201D; (Esther 9:31). If the thirteenth of <italic>Adar</italic> happens to coincide with the Sabbath, we observe the fast earlier, on Thursday, the eleventh. If one of the other four fast days coincides with the Sabbath, it is postponed until after the Sabbath. If it falls on Friday, it is observed on Friday.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>19. All these fasts will be abolished during the messianic days. Furthermore, they will be turned into festive days of rejoicing and gladness, as it is written: &#x201C;The Lord of hosts declares that the fast of the fourth month, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth shall become occasions of joy and gladness and cheerful festivals for the house of Judah; only love truth and peace&#x201D; (Zechariah 8:19).</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>MEGILLAH AND &#x1E24;ANUKKAH</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. We are bidden by the sages to read the <italic>Megillah</italic> at its proper time. It is widely known that this reading was prescribed by the prophets. Everyone is required to hear its reading: men, women, proselytes, and emancipated slaves. Minors should be trained to read it.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>4. On what date should it be read? The sages prescribed several dates for it, because it is written: &#x201C;At their appointed times&#x201D; (Esther 9:31). These are the dates of reading the <italic>Megillah:</italic> Every town in Eretz Yisrael or abroad that was surrounded by a wall since the time of Joshua the son of Nun should read it on the fifteenth of <italic>Adar</italic>, even if it has no wall at the present. Such a town is referred to as a walled city. Every town that was not surrounded by a wall in the days of Joshua, even if it has a wall now, should read the <italic>Megillah</italic> on the fourteenth of <italic>Adar</italic>. Such a town is referred to as an open city.</p>
<p>5. Although the castle-city of Shushan was not surrounded by a wall in the days of Joshua the son of Nun, the <italic>Megillah</italic> is read there on the fifteenth of <italic>Adar</italic>, because it was there that the miracle occurred, as it is written: &#x201C;They rested on the fifteenth&#x201D; (Esther 9:18). This was made to depend on the days of Joshua in deference to Eretz Yisrael which was in ruins at that time. The inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael were to be considered residents of walled cities so as to read the <italic>Megillah</italic> at the same time as the residents of Shushan. Although Eretz Yisrael is still desolate, its residents are to read the <italic>Megillah</italic> on the fifteenth of <italic>Adar</italic> in localities that used to be surrounded by defense walls during the period of Joshua. Eretz Yisrael is thus remembered in connection with the miracle of <italic>Purim</italic>.</p>
<p>13. The <italic>Megillah</italic> must not be read on the Sabbath. This is a precautionary measure, lest someone might take the <italic>Megillah</italic> to a skilled reader, transporting it four cubits or more through a public domain; for, though everyone is required to read the <italic>Megillah</italic>, not everyone is a skilled reader. For this reason, if the date for the reading of the <italic>Megillah</italic> falls on the Sabbath, it should be read prior to the Sabbath, while on the Sabbath itself the rules concerning <italic>Purim</italic> should be thoroughly discussed as a reminder that the day is <italic>Purim</italic>.</p>
<p>14. If, for example, the fourteenth falls on a Sabbath, the inhabitants of open towns should read the <italic>Megillah</italic> on the preceding Friday, while the inhabitants of walled cities should read it on Sunday, their normal time. If the fifteen occurs on a Sabbath, the inhabitants of fortified cities should read it earlier, on Friday, which is the fourteenth, while the inhabitants of open towns should read it on the same day, which is the normal time for them. In such a case, all will be reading the <italic>Megillah</italic> on the fourteenth.</p>
<h1>Chapter Two</h1>
<p>3. If a man read the <italic>Megillah</italic> by heart, he has not fulfilled his duty. If a speaker of a foreign tongue heard the <italic>Megillah</italic> read from a copy written in the Hebrew language and in Hebrew script, he has fulfilled his duty, even though he did not know what they said. Similarly, if the <italic>Megillah</italic> is written in Greek, and he heard it read, he has discharged his duty, even though he knows no Greek, and even if the listener is familiar with Hebrew.</p>
<p>4. If the <italic>Megillah</italic> is written in Aramaic or in some other foreign tongue, except Greek, only a person who is familiar with that tongue fulfills his duty by hearing it read.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>5. If a man read the <italic>Megillah</italic> without due intention, he has not discharged his duty. If, for example, while copying the <italic>Megillah</italic>, or expounding it, or proof-reading it, he intended to fulfill his duty with this reading, he has discharged his obligation; if he did not so intend, he has not fulfilled his duty.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>13. On these two days, namely the fourteenth and the fifteenth of <italic>Adar</italic>, lamentation and fasting are forbidden to anyone anywhere: to residents of walled cities who observe the fifteenth day only, and to residents of open towns who observe the fourteenth day only. Lamentation and fasting are forbidden on these two days of the first <italic>Adar</italic> and the second <italic>Adar</italic>.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>14. Residents of villages and open towns are bidden to make the fourteenth day of <italic>Adar</italic>, and residents of walled cities the fifteenth, a day for rejoicing and feasting and sending presents to one another and gifts to the poor. Work is permitted; nevertheless it is improper to work on <italic>Purim</italic>. The sages have declared that anyone who works on <italic>Purim</italic> will never see a sign of success in that work.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>16. One is required to distribute charity to the poor on <italic>Purim</italic>.&#x2014; &#x2014; The applicants for <italic>Purim</italic> money should not be scrutinized; it should be given to anyone who holds out his hand. <italic>Purim</italic> money must not be diverted to any other charity.</p>
<p>17. One should rather spend more money on gifts to the poor than on his <italic>Purim</italic> banquet and presents to his friends. No joy is greater and more glorious than the joy of gladdening the hearts of the poor, the orphans, the widows, and the strangers. He who gladdens the heart of these unhappy people imitates God, as it is written: &#x201C;I am &#x2026; to revive the spirit of the humble, and to put heart into the crushed&#x201D; (Isaiah 57:15).</p>
<p>18. All Prophetic Books and the Sacred Writings will cease [to be recited in public] during the messianic era except the Book of Esther. It will continue to exist just as the Five Books of the Torah and the laws of the Oral Torah that will never cease. Although ancient troubles will be remembered no longer, as it is written: &#x201C;The troubles of the past are forgotten and hidden from my eyes&#x201D; (Isaiah 65:16), the days of <italic>Purim</italic> will not be abolished, as it is written: &#x201C;These days of <italic>Purim</italic> shall never be repealed among the Jews, and the memory of them shall never cease from their descendants&#x201D; (Esther 9:28).</p>
<h1>Chapter Three</h1>
<p>1. During the period of the second Temple, when the Greek kings were in power, they proclaimed decrees against the Jewish people, abrogating their religion and forbidding them to study the Torah or to perform the divine precepts. They laid their hands on their wealth and their daughters; they entered the Temple and broke through it, defiling the things that were pure. The people of Israel were sorely distressed by their enemies, who oppressed them ruthlessly until the God of our fathers took pity, saved and rescued them from the hands of the tyrants. The Hasmonean great priests won victories, defeating the Syrian Greeks and saving Israel from their power. They set up a king from among the priests and Israel&#x2019;s kingdom was restored for a period of more than two centuries, until the destruction of the second Temple.</p>
<p>2. When, on the twenty-fifth of <italic>Kislev</italic>, the Jews had emerged victorious over their foes and destroyed them, they re-entered the Temple where they found only one jar of pure oil, enough to be lit for only a single day; yet they used it for lighting the required set of lamps for eight days, until they managed to press olives and produce pure oil.</p>
<p>3. Because of this, the sages of that generation ruled that the eight days beginning with the twenty-fifth of <italic>Kislev</italic> should be observed as days of rejoicing and praising the Lord. Lamps are lit in the evening over the doors of the homes, on each of the eight nights, so as to display the miracle. These days are called <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic>, when it is forbidden to lament or to fast, just as it is on the days of <italic>Purim</italic>. Lighting the lamps during the eight days of <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> is a religious duty imposed by the sages, like the reading of the <italic>Megillah</italic> on <italic>Purim</italic>.</p>
<h1>Chapter Four</h1>
<p>12. The precept of lighting the <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> lamp is exceedingly precious, and one should carefully observe it in order to acclaim the miracle, ever praising and thanking God for the miracles which he has performed for us. Even if one has nothing to eat except what he gets from charity, he should borrow, or sell his garment, to buy oil and lamps and light them.</p>
<p>14. If a [poor] person must choose between Sabbath lights and <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> lights, or between Sabbath lights and wine for <italic>Kiddush</italic>, the lighting of his home takes priority, so as to sustain peace in the house, since even the divine name was erased [in the oath of purgation&#x2014;Numbers 5:12-31] to make peace between [a jealous] husband and his wife. Great is peace, since the entire Torah has been given to create peace in the world, as it is written: &#x201C;Its ways are ways of pleasantness, and all its paths are peace&#x201D; (Proverbs 3:17).</p>

<chapter>
<title>MARRIAGE</title>
<h1>Chapter Six</h1>
<p>1. If a man betrothed a woman upon condition, her betrothal is valid if the condition has been fulfilled; if it has not been fulfilled, she is not betrothed. It is immaterial whether the condition proceeds from the man or the woman. Every condition in the world, whether in matters of betrothal or divorce, purchase or sale, or any other civil case, must consist of four things.</p>
<p>2. The four things constituting any stipulation are as follows: 1) the stipulation must be double [stating both alternatives and their eventual consequences]; 2) the positive must be expressed before the negative; 3) the condition in the agreement must precede the act; 4) the condition must be possible of performance. If the condition lacks one of them, it is void as if there has been no condition attached. Then the betrothal or divorce of the woman takes effect immediately, the purchase or the gift is fulfilled forthright, as if there has been no condition expressed, just because the condition has lacked one of the four [components].</p>
<p>3. If, for example, a man said to a woman: &#x201C;If you give me two hundred <italic>zuz</italic> you will be betrothed to me with this denar, and if you do not give me you will not be betrothed,&#x201D; and having imposed this condition he gave her the denar; it is a valid stipulation, and she is betrothed conditionally. If she gives him two hundred <italic>zuz</italic>, she will be betrothed in fact; if she fails to give him that amount, her betrothal is invalid.</p>
<p>4. If, however, he said to her: &#x201C;You are betrothed to me with this denar,&#x201D; and he handed her the denar; then he completed the condition and said: &#x201C;If you give me two hundred <italic>zuz</italic> you will be betrothed, and if you do not give that amount you will not be betrothed,&#x201D; the condition is void, because he performed the act of handing her the denar before he stipulated the condition. Even though it all occurred instantly, while speaking, her betrothal took immediate effect and she does not have to give him anything.</p>
<p>5. So too, if he said to her: &#x201C;If you give me two hundred <italic>zuz</italic> you are betrothed to me with this denar,&#x201D; and then he handed her the denar; the condition is void because he did not double it [by stating both alternatives and their consequences]; for he did not tell her: &#x201C;If you will not give me the amount you will not be betrothed.&#x201D; Hence, she is betrothed immediately, and does not have to give him anything.</p>
<p>6. Similarly, if he said to her: &#x201C;If you will not give me two hundred <italic>zuz</italic> you will not be betrothed to me, and if you will give me two hundred <italic>zuz</italic> you are betrothed to me with this denar,&#x201D; and he handed her the denar; the stipulation is invalid because he stated the negative before the affirmative. Accordingly, she is betrothed immediately without being required to give him anything.</p>
<p>7. So too, if he said to her: &#x201C;If you will ascend to heaven or descend to the bottom of the ocean you are betrothed to me with this denar, but if you will not ascend to heaven or descend to the bottom of the ocean you will not be betrothed,&#x201D; and then handed her the denar; the condition is void and she is betrothed immediately, because it is known that she cannot perform this stipulation; he merely meant to divert her with jesting words.</p>
<p>14. There are some recent Geonim who have stated that a man does not have to double his condition anywhere except in divorce and betrothal cases; he is not required to do so in civil cases. But this opinion should not be relied upon, seeing that the rule about doubling the condition along with the three other restrictions have been derived by the sages from the condition that Moses stipulated in addressing the Israelites concerning the Gadites and the Reubenites: &#x201C;If the Gadites and the Reubenites cross the Jordan &#x2026; you shall give them the land of Gilead &#x2026; but if they do not cross over with you&#x2026;&#x201D; (Numbers 32:29-30). This condition had nothing to do with divorce and betrothal occasions. Hence, the early great Geonim ruled as stated previously, and we should act accordingly.</p>
<p>15. If a man has betrothed a woman conditionally, her betrothal will be valid from the moment the condition has been fulfilled, and not from the time she became betrothed. Example: A man said to a woman: &#x201C;If I will give you two hundred <italic>zuz</italic> this year, you are betrothed to me with this denar; and if I will not give you, you shall not be betrothed.&#x201D; He handed her the denar on <italic>Nisan</italic>, and gave her the two hundred <italic>zuz</italic>, which he had stipulated with her, on <italic>Elul</italic>. Then her betrothal becomes valid beginning with <italic>Elul</italic>. Accordingly, if someone else betrothed her before the fulfillment of the condition made by the first man, she is betrothed to the second man. The same law applies to divorce cases as well as property rights. At the moment the condition is fulfilled, the divorce takes effect, the bargain or the gift becomes valid.</p>
<p>16. This rule applies only where there was a condition and the man did not say <italic>from now</italic>. If, however, he said to her: &#x201C;You are betrothed to me with this denar from now if I will give you two hundred <italic>zuz</italic>,&#x201D; and after some time he gave her two hundred <italic>zuz</italic>, her betrothal is valid retroactively from the moment the betrothal was contracted, even though his condition became a reality after a long period only. Accordingly, if a second man betrothed her prior to the fulfillment of the condition, her betrothal is not binding. The same rule applies to divorce and property cases.</p>
<p>17. Anyone who says <italic>from now</italic> does not have to double his condition or to express the condition before stating the act; even if he has stated the act first, his condition is valid. Nevertheless, the condition must be possible of performance; if he has made a condition that is impossible of fulfillment, he is regarded as if he used diverting speech, so that no condition exists.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Nine</h1>
<p>22. If there is a rumor that a certain woman is betrothed to a certain individual, she is assumed to be betrothed even though no clear evidence is available. We should not take into consideration any rumor that was not made known in the law court. On the basis of what rumor is she assumed to be betrothed? For example, two men came and testified that they had seen the lamps burning, the couches arranged, the people coming and going, and the women cheerfully telling that so-and-so had become engaged today.&#x2014; &#x2014; Similarly, if two men came and said: &#x201C;We saw something like an engagement party and heard a rumor; we heard from so-and-so who heard from so-and-so that so-and-so had become engaged in the presence of two witnesses who left for another country, or died&#x201D;; she is deemed betrothed on the basis of such a rumor.</p>
<p>23. This is only in a case where there was no reasonable explanation [showing the report to be mistaken]; if, however, there was such a reasonable explanation, which they heard together with the rumor, she is not assumed to be betrothed. If, for example, there was such an explanation as: &#x201C;So-and-so has become betrothed conditionally, or dubitably,&#x201D; she is not assumed to be betrothed. She should be asked and trusted, since there is no clear evidence available nor even a strong rumor.</p>
<p>24. If it was rumored that she became betrothed to a certain man and after some time a halting explanation was offered, we rely on the explanation if the court considers it authentic, and she is not deemed betrothed; if it does not seem reasonable to the court, we should not pay attention to the halting explanation, since it was not heard at the time the betrothal was reported.</p>
<p>25. It once happened that a rumor spread that a girl had become betrothed to the son of a certain party. After some time, the father of the young man was asked, and he replied that she had become betrothed to his son conditionally, and the condition was not fulfilled. The sages did not rely on what he said but declared: &#x201C;She is doubtfully betrothed as if there were no halting explanation available&#x201D; (Gittin 89a).</p>
<p>27. If a rumor spread that she was betrothed to a certain party and then another rumor, like the first, spread that she was betrothed to another party, then either the first party or the second should write a divorce so that the other can marry her.</p>
<p>30. If two witnesses say: &#x201C;We saw her becoming betrothed on a certain day,&#x201D; and two others say: &#x201C;We did not see it,&#x201D; even though they are all residents of the same courtyard, she is considered betrothed, because the argument &#x201C;we did did not see it&#x201D; is no evidence, since the popular custom is to betroth privately.</p>
<h1>Chapter Sixteen</h1>
<p>1. The properties that a woman brings to her husband, whether real estate, movable goods or servants, even if they are recorded in the marriage contract, are not called <italic>kethubbah</italic> but <italic>nedunya</italic> [dowry]. If the husband has assumed responsibility for the <italic>nedunya</italic>, which has come under his control, so that the increments and losses are his, it is termed <italic>nikhs&#x00E9; tzon barzel</italic> [property of iron sheep: like iron, it cannot be destroyed; like sheep, the husband derives all profit from it]. If, however, he has not assumed responsibility for the <italic>nedunya</italic>, so that the losses and increments belong to her, it is called <italic>nikhs&#x00E9; melog</italic> [property of plucking: the husband has the usufruct and need not answer for any damage that may occur to it].</p>
<p>2. So too, all properties belonging to the woman who has not brought them to her husband, and they were not recorded in the <italic>kethubbah</italic> but remained her own, or those which she obtained through inheritance or gift after her betrothal, are all designated as <italic>nikhs&#x00E9; melog</italic> and remain under her control. Only the main marriage contract, amounting to a hundred or two hundred <italic>zuz</italic>, plus the additional dower, is designated as <italic>kethubbah</italic>.</p>
<p>3. We have already stated that the sages instituted the writing of a marriage contract for the woman, and that the additional dower has the same legal status as the main <italic>kethubbah</italic>. They have ruled that she cannot collect it from her husband whenever she pleases; instead, it is regarded as a debt bearing a date of collection. The <italic>kethubbah</italic> can be collected only after the husband&#x2019;s death, or in the case of his divorcing her.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>31. A woman is believed when she says &#x201C;my husband is dead,&#x201D; so that she may lawfully marry, as will be explained among the laws of divorce. The <italic>kethubbah</italic> stipulates that if she remarries after her husband&#x2019;s death, she is to receive all that he detailed in her <italic>kethubbah</italic>. Accordingly, if she came to the court and said: &#x201C;My husband is dead, give me permission to remarry,&#x201D; and she mentioned no <italic>kethubbah</italic> at all, she is permitted to marry; she is given her <italic>kethubbah</italic> after imposing an oath on her. If she came and said: &#x201C;My husband is dead, give me my <italic>kethubbah</italic>,&#x201D; she is not even permitted to remarry, because the presumption is that her husband is not dead and that she has come only to collect the <italic>kethubbah</italic> when he is still alive, and does not intend to marry. If she came and said: &#x201C;My husband is dead, permit me to marry and give me my <italic>kethubbah</italic>,&#x201D; she is permitted to marry and is given her <italic>kethubbah</italic>, because she principally spoke of marriage. If, however, she came and said: &#x201C;Give me my <italic>kethubbah</italic> and permit me to remarry,&#x201D; she is permitted to marry but is not given the <italic>kethubbah</italic>. But if she took possession of some of her husband&#x2019;s property, we should not take it away from her.</p>
<h1>Chapter Eighteen</h1>
<p>1. A widow receives her maintenance from the property of the heirs during her widowhood until she obtains her <italic>kethubbah</italic>. As soon as she claims her <italic>kethubbah</italic> in the court of law she can no longer claim maintenance.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. As she receives maintenance from her husband&#x2019;s property after his death, so must she be provided with clothing, utensils, and the living quarters she occupied when her husband was alive.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>3. If the house collapsed, or if her husband had merely occupied a rented house, she must be provided with living quarters that are suitable to her social position. Her maintenance and her clothing likewise must be suitable to her social position. If the social position of her husband had been superior to hers, she must be provided in accordance with his position, inasmuch as a wife rises to the position of her husband and does not descend from it even after his death.</p>
<h1>Chapter Twenty-Two</h1>
<p>1. The husband has priority over any person in being the heir of his deceased wife.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>7. The husband has the right of enjoying the fruit of any property belonging to his wife, whether <italic>nikhs&#x00E9; tzon barzel</italic> or <italic>nikhs&#x00E9; melog</italic>, as long as she is alive. If she dies during the lifetime of her husband, he inherits everything.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>16. If he sold movables classed as <italic>nikhs&#x00E9; tzon barzel</italic>, even though he was not permitted to do so, his sale is valid.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>DIVORCE</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. The wife can be divorced only with a written document that comes into her possession; such a document is called <italic>get</italic> (letter of divorce). There are ten basic things prescribed by the Torah in the divorce proceedings, namely: 1) The <italic>get</italic> must come from the husband voluntarily. 2) He must prepare it in writing only. 3) The subject of the letter must unfold that he has divorced and removed her from his possession. 4) It must express the idea of separation between him and her. 5) It must be especially written for her. 6) It must not require any other act except delivery. 7) He must hand it to her. 8) He must hand it to her in the presence of witnesses. 9) He must give it to her as a letter of divorce. 10) Only the husband, or his agent, must be the one handing it to her. The rest of the features of a <italic>get</italic>, such as the date and the signature of the witnesses, and the like, are all rabbinic in origin.</p>
<p>2. How do we know that these ten essentials are prescribed by the Torah? It is written: &#x201C;If she fails to please him &#x2026; and he writes her a bill of divorcement, hands it to her, and sends her away from his house&#x2026;&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 24:1). <italic>If she fails to please him</italic> denotes that he divorces her only voluntarily; if his divorce has been involuntary it is invalid. The wife, however, is divorced whether or not she has been willing.</p>
<p>3. <italic>And he writes</italic> denotes that she can be divorced only with a written document; <italic>her</italic>, especially for her; <italic>a bill of divorcement</italic>, something that separates between him and her, leaving him no right of possessing her; if this separation between him and her is not stated, her divorce is invalid, as it will be explained. <italic>Hands it to her</italic> denotes that she is not divorced until the <italic>get</italic> is given into her hand, or the hand of her agent that means the same as her own, or into her courtyard, all of which is legally regarded as her own hand, as it will be explained. <italic>And sends her away</italic>, the context of the <italic>get</italic> must convey that he sends <italic>her</italic> away and not that he sends <italic>himself</italic> away from her.</p>
<p>4. If, for example, he wrote to her: &#x201C;You are sent away, you are divorced, you are free to yourself, you are permitted to marry any man,&#x201D; or something like this, her divorce is valid. The essential formula of a <italic>get</italic> is: &#x201C;You are permitted to marry any man.&#x201D; If, however, he wrote to her: &#x201C;I am not your husband, I am not your betrothed, I am not your man,&#x201D; it is not a valid divorce, since it is written <italic>and he sends her away</italic> and not that he sends himself away. So too, if a man has written to his wife: &#x201C;You are a free woman,&#x201D; it is not a valid divorce.</p>
<p>5. The biblical expression <italic>and he sends her away</italic> does not indicate that her divorce is incomplete until she leaves his house, but that she is divorced as soon as the <italic>get</italic> reaches her hand, even if she is still in his house.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>9. How do we know that he must hand it to her only in terms of a divorce? It is written: &#x201C;a bill of divorcement &#x2026; hands it to her,&#x201D; that is, he must give it to her as a bill of divorcement. If, however, he handed it to her in terms of a note of indebtedness or a <italic>Mezuzah</italic>, or if he placed it in her hand while she was asleep, and when she awoke she noticed it in her hand, it is not a valid divorce. But, if he told her afterwards: &#x201C;This is your divorce,&#x201D; it is a valid divorce.</p>
<p>10. If a man said to witnesses: &#x201C;Look at the <italic>get</italic> I am giving her,&#x201D; and then he said to her: &#x201C;Take this note of indebtedness,&#x201D; it is valid, because he had informed the witnesses that he was giving it to her in terms of a divorce. He told her about a bill of indebtedness only because he was embarrassed in her presence.</p>
<p>11. The man who divorces his wife must say to her, while handing her the <italic>get, this is your get</italic>, or <italic>it is your get</italic>, or something like this. If, however, he handed it to her and said nothing, it is a disqualified <italic>get</italic>. This rule applies only in a case where he had not spoken with her concerning her divorce; but if he had spoken with her about her divorce, and then handed it to her while saying nothing, it is a valid divorce.</p>
<p>15. The sages have ruled that the witnesses must sign the divorce: suppose he gives her a <italic>get</italic> in the presence of two men and they die, her <italic>get</italic> would be as insignificant as a potsherd, seeing that it is not confirmed by witnesses. Hence, it has been instituted that the <italic>get</italic> should bear the testimony of witnesses. Even though the evidence of witnesses is included in the <italic>get</italic>, he must hand it to her in the presence of two men, either those who signed it or two others, because the <italic>get</italic> basically depends on the delivery witnesses [who transfer it to her].</p>
<p>23. The witnesses who sign the <italic>get</italic> must know how to read and sign. If, however, they do not know how to read, it must be read to them before they sign it, provided that they understand the language of the <italic>get</italic>.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Two</h1>
<p>1. The biblical expression <italic>he writes her a bill of divorcement and hands it to her</italic> means that it is immaterial whether he has written it himself or has told another to write it for him, whether he has handed it to her himself or has told another to hand it to her on his behalf. The term <italic>he writes</italic> solely signifies that she can be divorced only with a written document; <italic>and he hands her</italic>, she must not take it by herself.</p>
<p>7. What difference is there between a disqualified and a nullified divorce? Wherever it is stated in this work that a <italic>get</italic> is nullified, we mean that it is nullified on biblical grounds; wherever the reference is to a disqualified <italic>get</italic>, it is disqualified on rabbinic grounds.</p>
<p>8. If a husband brought a signed letter of divorce and said: &#x201C;Give this <italic>get</italic> to my wife,&#x201D; they should give it to her. If he told others to write and sign a divorce and give it to his wife, and they did, and then it was found out that the <italic>get</italic> was nullified or disqualified, they may write another <italic>get</italic>, even a hundred, until finally a valid <italic>get</italic> reaches her hand.</p>
<p>12. If a man says: &#x201C;Write a <italic>get</italic> for my wife,&#x201D; it should be written, signed, and delivered into the husband&#x2019;s hand, and must not be handed to his wife before he tells them to give it to her; if they gave it to her, it is not a valid <italic>get</italic>. This rule applies to a man in good health; but if a dangerously ill person, whose illness has suddenly worsened, or one who is being taken prisoner, or one who is starting out on a sea voyage or a convoy, says: &#x201C;Write a divorce for my wife,&#x201D; they should write, sign, and give it to her, for it is known that he only meant to have it written and given to her.</p>
<p>16. If a paralyzed man whose mind is intact was asked: &#x201C;Shall we write a divorce for your wife?&#x201D; and he nodded his head as a sign of assent, he should be tested three times intermittently whether he is sane: if he says <italic>no</italic> for no and <italic>yes</italic> for yes, they should write and deliver the <italic>get</italic>. He should be tested extremely well, since he might have lost his mind. So too, if he wrote in his own hand: &#x201C;Write and give a divorce to my wife,&#x201D; they should write and give it to her, if his mind is intact, for the paralyzed person has not the same legal status as the deaf-mute.</p>
<p>17. If a man married while in possession of all faculties and later became a deaf-mute, and needless to say insane, he can never give a divorce until he is well again. We must not rely on the gesture or the writing of a deaf-mute, even if his mind is completely intact. If, however, he married as a deaf-mute, he may give a divorce by a gesture.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>20. If the law requires that a man should be compelled to divorce his wife and he refuses to do so, the Jewish court anywhere, at any time, should lash him until he says <italic>I am willing;</italic> then he should write the <italic>get</italic>, and it will be valid.&#x2014; &#x2014; So too, if non-Jews flogged him, saying to him: &#x201C;Do what the Jews are telling you,&#x201D; and if pressure is exerted on him by Jews through non-Jews until he gives his divorce, it is a valid <italic>get</italic>.&#x2014; &#x2014; Why is this <italic>get</italic> not nullified, seeing that he is compelled by non-Jews or by Jews? The rule concerning a person who has committed a misdeed under compulsion applies only to one who has been pressured to do a thing to which he is not biblically bound.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Four</h1>
<p>9. No matter in what language the <italic>get</italic> is composed, the scribe must carefully avoid ambiguous wording resulting in the reader&#x2019;s conjecturing: perhaps the meaning is not divorce but something else, and maybe it is an expression of divorce. The phrasing must be such that there can be no doubt about its single meaning in that language, namely that so-and-so has divorced and sent away his wife so-and-so.</p>
<p>10. So too, the handwriting must appear very clear in the <italic>get</italic>, to the extent that even youngsters who are familiar with that particular writing should be able to read it, children who are neither bright nor dull but average. The writing must not be bent and confused, lest one letter may resemble another letter, resulting in a changed context.</p>
<h1>Chapter Six</h1>
<p>1. The messenger appointed by the woman to accept her <italic>get</italic> from her husband on her behalf is called agent of acceptance. She becomes divorced as soon as the <italic>get</italic> reaches the agent&#x2019;s hand, as if it reached her own hand. The appointment of her agent must be made in the presence of two witnesses.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>3. The husband cannot appoint a messenger to accept a divorce for his wife, but he can appoint a messenger to take the <italic>get</italic> to his wife. This one is called agent of delivery.</p>
<p>4. So too, the woman can send a messenger to bring her the <italic>get</italic> from her husband. This one is called a bringing agent. Neither the delivery agent nor the bringing agent requires witnesses.</p>
<h1>Chapter Ten</h1>
<p>1. Wherever we have stated in this work that the <italic>get</italic> is nullified or that she is not divorced, the reference is to a <italic>get</italic> that is biblically nullified, and she is still an absolutely married woman; if she remarried, she must leave her second husband, and the child is illegitimate.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. Wherever we have stated in this work that the <italic>get</italic> is disqualified, it is disqualified only on rabbinic grounds, and she is ineligible for marriage with a <italic>kohen</italic> on biblical grounds. She must not remarry from the start; but if she did remarry, she does not have to leave her second husband, and the child is legitimate. Another, valid <italic>get</italic> should be written for her and delivered to her while she stays on with her [second] husband.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>22. An ill-tempered wife, and one that is not chaste as worthy daughters of Israel are expected to be, ought to be sent away, as it is written: &#x201C;Get rid of a scoffer, and strife will cease&#x201D; (Proverbs 22:10).&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>LEVIRATE MARRIAGE AND &#x1E24;ALITZAH</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. It is a positive biblical command that a man shall take in levirate marriage his paternal brother&#x2019;s wife if he died childless whether after wedlock or after betrothal.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. If he or she refuses levirate marriage, he should give her <italic>&#x1E25;alitzah;</italic> then she is permitted to marry another man.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>3. The biblical expression <italic>and he leaves no son</italic> (Deuteronomy 25:5) means son or daughter, or even the offspring of either son or daughter. If he has left any offspring whatever, whether from this wife or another, he exempts his wife from <italic>&#x1E25;alitzah</italic> and <italic>yibbum</italic> (levirate marriage).&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>4. However, his son by a bondmaid or a non-Jewish wife does not exempt his wife, because the children coming from a bondmaid are slaves, and those from a non-Jewess are non-Jews; they are regarded as nonexistent.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>8. Men who adopted the Jewish faith and slaves who were set free have no legal relationship with their brothers and are like strangers to one another.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Two</h1>
<p>6. If a man died and left many brothers, it is the duty of the eldest to marry the childless sister-in-law or to give her <italic>&#x1E25;alitzah</italic>, as it is written: &#x201C;The first son that she bears&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 25:6). This has been traditionally interpreted to refer only to the firstborn among the brothers; that is, the eldest of the brothers &#x201C;shall succeed to the position of the dead man.&#x201D; The phrase <italic>that she bears</italic> denotes <italic>that the mother bore</italic>, and does not mean <italic>that the sister-in-law will bear</italic>.</p>
<p>7. If the eldest brother refuses to perform the levir&#x2019;s duty, we must go around from one brother to the other. If they refuse, we must come back to the eldest and say: &#x201C;It is your duty, either give <italic>&#x1E25;alitzah</italic> or marry her.&#x201D; The brother-in-law should not be coerced to perform the levir&#x2019;s duty, but should be compelled to give <italic>&#x1E25;alitzah</italic>.</p>
<h1>Chapter Four</h1>
<p>1. How is the duty of <italic>&#x1E25;alitzah</italic> performed? The brother&#x2019;s widow proceeds to the place where the <italic>yavam</italic> (brother-in-law) is to be found and comes to the judges, who summon him and give him such advice as suits him and her alike. If it is advisable for him to marry her, he is counseled to marry her; if it is advisable to perform <italic>&#x1E25;alitzah</italic>, as when she is young and he is old or she is old and he is young, he is advised to perform <italic>&#x1E25;alitzah</italic>.</p>
<p>3. She and the <italic>yavam</italic> are taught to recite the formula until they are both used to it and she can pronounce in one breath <italic>lo avah</italic> (he will not), then adding <italic>yabbemi</italic> (perform the levir&#x2019;s duty to me), so that it should not sound as if she were to say <italic>avah yabbemi</italic> (he desires to perform the levir&#x2019;s duty to me).</p>
<p>5. The <italic>&#x1E25;alitzah</italic> ceremony must take place by day and not at night, and in the presence of three men capable of instructing them what and how to recite.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>6. How is the <italic>&#x1E25;alitzah</italic> shoe removed? A heeled leather-shoe that is not stitched with flax is brought to him, who puts it on and fastens its straps on his right foot. Then he and she stand before the judges of the court, who instruct her to say in Hebrew: &#x201C;My husband&#x2019;s brother refuses to establish a name in Israel for his brother; he will not perform the duty of a levir&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 25:7). Then the <italic>yavam</italic> is made to recite: &#x201C;I do not wish to marry her&#x201D; (8). He puts his foot down on the ground, and she sits down, stretches out her hand in front of the court, unties the straps of the shoe from his foot, takes off the shoe and throws it upon the ground. As soon as most of the heeled shoe is detached from his foot, the brother&#x2019;s widow is permitted to marry a stranger.</p>
<p>7. &#x2014; &#x2014; Thereupon she is made to recite: &#x201C;Thus shall be done to the man who will not build up his brother&#x2019;s house&#x0021; And he shall become known in Israel as the unsandaled one&#x201D; (9-10).</p>
<p>8. All must be done in the Hebrew language, as it is written &#x201C;thus,&#x201D; in this language. All those who are seated there respond by repeating after her &#x201C;the unsandaled one&#x201D; three times.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>FORBIDDEN FOODS</title>
<h1>Chapter Four</h1>
<p>1. Anyone who eats an olive-size of the flesh of cattle, beasts, or birds that died a natural death should be lashed, as it is written: &#x201C;You must not eat anything that has died a natural death&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 14:21). Whatever has not been slaughtered properly is regarded as if it died a natural death.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. The term <italic>prohibited nevelah</italic> is applicable only to the clean species that are fit for ritual slaughter, and permitted as food if slaughtered properly. Unclean species, on the other hand, where <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic> has no advantage, if anyone eats of their flesh he is to be lashed not because of eating <italic>nevelah</italic> and <italic>terefah</italic> but for eating the flesh of an unclean animal; and it is immaterial whether it has been slaughtered properly or it has died a natural death, or whether he has cut a piece of flesh from it when alive and eaten it.</p>
<p>6. Anyone who eats an olive-size of the flesh of clean cattle, beasts or birds that were declared ritually unfit for food is to be lashed, as it is written: &#x201C;You must not eat flesh torn by beasts in the field; you shall cast it to the dogs&#x201D; (Exodus 22:30). The biblical term <italic>terefah</italic> refers to an animal torn by a wild beast, such as a lion, a leopard, or the like. So too, <italic>terefah</italic> is applied to a bird torn by a bird of prey, a hawk, or the like. You cannot say that <italic>terefah</italic> signifies that the wild beast or bird of prey tore and killed it, since it would be <italic>nevelah</italic> if dead; what difference does it make whether it died of itself or was killed by someone who struck it with a sword, or whether a lion mauled and killed it? Hence, the biblical text must refer to a mauled animal that has not died.</p>
<p>7. If a torn animal that has not died is forbidden, one might suppose that if a wolf came and dragged away a young goat by its foot, tail or ear, and a man chased the wolf and rescued the kid from its mouth, the kid should be forbidden because it was mauled, therefore the Torah plainly says: &#x201C;You must not eat flesh torn by beasts in the field; you shall cast it to the dogs,&#x201D; that is, it is forbidden only when it has become fit for the dogs. Hence, you may infer that <italic>terefah</italic> spoken of in the Torah refers to an animal torn and mauled by a wild beast to the point of death, though it has not died yet. Even if someone hastened to slaughter it prior to its death, it is forbidden as <italic>terefah</italic>, since it could not have survived the wound inflicted upon it.</p>
<p>8. From this you may conclude that the Torah has forbidden an animal that has died, a <italic>nevelah</italic>. It has also forbidden an animal on the verge of death because of its wounds, even though it has not died yet, and that is <italic>terefah</italic>. Just as you can make no distinction between the causes of death, whether the animal died a natural death or it fell down and died &#x2014; &#x2014; so you can make no distinction in the case of an animal on the verge of death, whether a beast tore and mauled it &#x2014; &#x2014; or whether someone shot an arrow at it and pierced its heart or lungs.&#x2014; &#x2014; Once the animal is dying at any rate, it is <italic>terefah</italic>, whether the cause is a human act or an act of God. If this is the case, why is the term <italic>terefah</italic> (torn) mentioned in the Torah? Scripture speaks of what happens regularly. If you will not interpret it in this manner, you will have to assume that it refers only to an animal &#x201C;torn &#x2026; in the field,&#x201D; and if it was torn in a courtyard it should not be forbidden&#x0021; Hence, you must infer that Scripture speaks only of what is likely to happen.</p>
<p>22. In reference to an ox condemned to be stoned it is written: &#x201C;Its flesh shall not be eaten&#x201D; (Exodus 21:28). How could it be eaten after it had been stoned and assumed the status of <italic>nevelah? &#x0021;</italic> Scripture only means to convey that as soon as the ox was condemned to be stoned it became forbidden and was regarded as an unclean animal. If anyone hastened and slaughtered the ox properly, it is forbidden to derive any benefit from it; if anyone ate an olive-size of its flesh he is to be lashed.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Six</h1>
<p>1. If anyone eats an olive-size of blood willfully he deserves <italic>kareth;</italic> if unwittingly, he must bring a standard sin-offering.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>7. If the liver is cut open and thrown into vinegar or boiling water so that it becomes bleached, it is then permitted to be cooked. All the Jewish people have already adopted the custom of singeing it over the fire before cooking it.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>8. If one cooked a liver without singeing it over the fire or without scalding it in vinegar or boiling water, the entire dish is forbidden: the liver and all that was cooked with it.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>10. Meat cannot be rid of its blood unless it is thoroughly salted and rinsed. How should one proceed? First, he should rinse the meat, and then salt it thoroughly and leave it in the salt for the time it takes to walk a mile. He should then rinse it well again until the water is entirely clear, and immediately throw it into boiling water, but not lukewarm water, that it may become bleached without any blood coming out.</p>
<p>11. When meat is salted, it should be salted only in a perforated utensil, using only salt that is as heavy as coarse sand, since the salt that is as fine as flour becomes absorbed in the meat and fails to extract the blood. Also, one must shake off the salt before rinsing the meat.</p>
<p>21. A bowl in which one has salted meat must never be used for hot food, even if the bowl is lined with lead, for the blood has already been absorbed in its potsherds.</p>
<h1>Chapter Eight</h1>
<p>9. A butcher who has been believed to sell <italic>kosher</italic> meat must refund the money to the customers if it has been found out that he has been passing on <italic>nevelah</italic> or <italic>terefah</italic> meat. He should be excommunicated and removed from his position. He can never be rehabilitated to enable him to sell meat again, unless he proceeds to a place where the people do not know him, and there restores a lost object of considerable worth, &#x2014; &#x2014; thereby proving that he has indeed repented, without any trickery.</p>
<h1>Chapter Nine</h1>
<p>1. It is biblically forbidden either to cook or to eat meat with milk.&#x2014; &#x2014; Anyone who cooks both together [as little as] the size of an olive is to be lashed, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall not boil a kid in its mother&#x2019;s milk&#x201D; (Exodus 23:19; 34:26; Deuteronomy 14:21). So too, anyone who eats of both the meat and the milk that have been cooked together, [even as little as] the size of an olive, is to be lashed, even if he has not done the cooking himself.</p>
<p>2. The reason Scripture is silent, and does not explicitly prohibit the eating of meat with milk, is that it has already forbidden the cooking; that is to say, since the cooking of the meat-milk mixture is forbidden, it is needless to state that partaking of it is likewise forbidden. Similarly, Scripture is silent and does not explicitly prohibit taking one&#x2019;s own daughter to wife, having already prohibited the taking of one&#x2019;s granddaughter to wife.</p>
<p>3. Biblically, only the meat of a clean animal with the milk of a clean animal is forbidden, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall not boil a kid in its mother&#x2019;s milk.&#x201D; The term <italic>kid</italic> includes the offspring of ox, sheep or goat, unless the text explicitly states &#x201C;a kid from the flock of goats&#x201D; (Genesis 38:17). The phrase &#x201C;a kid in its mother&#x2019;s milk&#x201D; is used only because Scripture speaks of something that actually happens. But if one cooks the meat of a clean animal with the milk of an unclean animal, or the meat of an unclean animal with the milk of a clean animal, he is permitted to do so and derive a benefit from it as well; punishment is incurred for eating it, but not by reason of its being a meat-milk mixture.</p>
<p>4. So too, the meat of beast or bird cooked with the milk of beasts or cattle is biblically not prohibited from eating; hence, it is permissible to cook it and to derive a benefit from it. It is, however, prohibited from eating it on rabbinic grounds, so that the people may not reach out beyond what is permitted and transgress the biblical meat-milk prohibition by eating the meat of a clean animal with the milk of a clean animal, since the literal meaning of the verse is restricted to a kid in its mother&#x2019;s milk only. For this reason, the sages have prohibited all meat with milk.</p>
<p>26. If one has first partaken of cheese or milk, he may eat meat immediately thereafter. He must, however, wash his hands and cleanse his mouth between the cheese and the meat. With what should he cleanse his mouth? With bread, or by chewing fruit and swallowing it or spitting it out.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>27. This applies only to the meat of cattle and livestock; but if one eats poultry after milk or cheese, he is not required to cleanse his mouth or wash his hands.</p>
<p>28. If one has eaten meat first, whether the meat of cattle or fowl, he should not partake of milk thereafter until a lapse of time is spent, equal to the interval between two meals, namely about six hours, because the fragments of meat between the teeth are not removed by cleansing.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>SHE&#x1E24;ITAH</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. The biblical positive command is that if anyone wishes to eat the meat of cattle, beasts or birds, he must first perform the rite of <italic>she&#x1E25;itah;</italic> only thereafter he may eat it, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall slaughter any of your cattle or sheep&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 12:21).&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>4. This mode of slaughtering, which is spoken of in the Torah indefinitely, must be explained, so as to know on what organ of the animal <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic> is performed; what is the extent of <italic>she&#x1E25;itah;</italic> with what instrument, when, where and how <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic> is executed; what things invalidate <italic>she&#x1E25;itah;</italic> and who may serve as a <italic>sho&#x1E25;et</italic>. All these details are implied in the biblical command, which states: &#x201C;You shall slaughter any of your cattle or sheep &#x2026; as I have instructed you, and you may eat to your heart&#x2019;s content in your settlements.&#x201D; All these details were commanded orally, like the rest of the Oral Torah which is referred to as <italic>Mitzvah</italic> (commandment), as we have explained in the introduction to this work.</p>
<p>14. With what is <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic> performed? With any instrument, whether it is a metal knife or a flint, a piece of glass or a shell of reed, and similar things that cut, provided that the edge is sharp and without a notch. If, however, there was something like a ridge on the edge of the <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic> instrument, even the smallest perceptible ridge, the <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic> is defective.</p>
<p>23. The <italic>sho&#x1E25;et</italic> must examine the edge of the knife and both sides. How should he examine it? He should first pass the finger and then the finger-nail along its three sides, namely the edge and both sides, to make sure that it is without any notch whatever. After that, he may use it for <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic>.</p>
<p>24. The <italic>sho&#x1E25;et</italic> must again examine the knife after <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic> in a like manner, because if he should discover a notch in it after <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic>, it would be a doubtful case of <italic>nevelah:</italic> the knife may have become notched inside the hide, so that when he cut the windpipe and the gullet he did so with a defective knife. Accordingly, the person who slaughters several animals or several birds must examine the knife after each of them. If he failed to do so, and upon examining the knife at the end of the <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic> it was discovered to be defective, all the animals are regarded as doubtful cases of <italic>nevelah</italic>, even the first.</p>
<p>28. When may <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic> be performed? At any time, day or night, as long as the <italic>sho&#x1E25;et</italic> has a torch with him, so that he can see what he is doing. If he performed <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic> in the dark, it is valid nevertheless.</p>
<h1>Chapter Three</h1>
<p>1. There are five things that spoil the <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic> act, and the essential <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic> requirement is to be cautious about each. They are: delay, pressing, digging, slipping, and tearing.</p>
<p>2. What is meant by delay? If a man began the <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic> act and before finishing it he raised his hand and paused, whether unintentionally or intentionally, or under compulsion, and then he or another person completed it, his <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic> is defective if he delayed as much time as would be required to raise the animal and make it lie down and slaughter it; but if he delayed less than that, his <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic> act is valid.</p>
<p>9. What is meant by digging? If, for example, he inserted the knife between the windpipe and the gullet, it is immaterial whether he cut through the upper tube upward or the lower tube downward, which is the mode of <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic>, it is defective.</p>
<p>11. What is meant by pressing? If, for example, he struck the neck with a knife, as it is done with a sword, and cut the tubes with a single stroke, without passing the knife forward and backward, or if he placed the knife on the neck and pressed it downward and cut through the tubes as one would cut radish or cucumber, it is defective.</p>
<p>12. What is meant by slipping? If the <italic>sho&#x1E25;et</italic> cut in a slanting direction, upward the windpipe, a place which is improper for <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic>.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>14. What is meant by tearing? If, for instance, the windpipe or the gullet was torn out or removed from its regular position before the completion of the <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic> act. If, however, he cut through one tube of a bird, or most of it, and then the second tube became detached, his <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic> is valid.</p>
<h1>Chapter Four</h1>
<p>3. If a Jewish person already knows the <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic> laws, he should nevertheless refrain from performing the <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic> act when all by himself, but should perform it in the presence of an expert many times until he becomes experienced and skillful. If, however, he did perform it all by himself, his <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic> is valid.</p>
<p>4. If a person who is familiar with the <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic> laws has performed the act of <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic> in the presence of an expert till he has gained experience, he is called expert. All experts may perform <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic> by themselves from the start. Even women and slaves, if they are experts, may perform <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic> from the start (that is, their <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic> performance is absolutely legitimate).</p>
<p>16. Those Sadducees and Boethusians, their disciples and all who go astray after them, who do not believe in the Oral Torah, the <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic> they perform is invalid. If, however, they perform it in our presence, it is legitimate; their <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic> is prohibited only because they are likely to perform it wrongly. Since they do not believe in the <italic>she&#x1E25;itah</italic> regulations, they cannot be trusted when they say &#x201C;we have not acted wrongly.&#x201D;</p>
<h1>Chapter Five</h1>
<p>1. We have already explained, among the laws concerning forbidden foods, that the biblical term <italic>terefah</italic> refers to an animal on the verge of death; the word <italic>terefah</italic> is used only because Scripture speaks of ordinary experience, as when a lion or some other beast has mauled an animal, and it is not yet dead.</p>
<p>2. There are other diseases, if they occur to an animal, it is to be regarded as <italic>terefah</italic>. These rules were handed down to Moses at Sinai.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>OATHS</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. There are four types of oaths: the futile oath, the false oath, the oath concerning a deposit, and the oath of testimony.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. The law concerning the futile oath applies only to things that are possible of performance whether in the future or in the past. Examples of the past: &#x201C;I ate; I threw a stone into the sea; A conversed with B; I did not eat; I did not throw a stone into the sea; A did not converse with B.&#x201D; Examples of the future: &#x201C;I will eat; I will not eat; I will throw; I will not throw a stone into the sea.&#x201D; Thus there are two kinds of a futile oath that include positive and negative assertions about things past, and two kinds that include positive and negative assertions about the future.</p>
<p>3. If anyone took one of these four classes of oaths and did the reverse, if for example he swore not to eat and ate, or to eat and did not eat; or if he swore &#x201C;I ate&#x201D; when in fact he did not eat, or &#x201C;I did not eat&#x201D; when in fact he did eat, it is a false oath. Of this and similar oaths it is written: &#x201C;You shall not swear falsely by my name&#x201D; (Leviticus 19:12).&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>4. The futile oath is [likewise] divisible into four classes. The first is a case where one has sworn that a known fact is not a fact. For example, one has sworn that a man is a woman, or that a woman is a man, or that a pillar of marble is made of gold, or anything of this sort.</p>
<p>5. The second is a case where one has sworn about a known fact which is not doubted by anybody, as when he has sworn that heaven is heaven, or that a particular stone is a stone, or that the number two is two, or anything of this sort. Since this is not doubted by any normal person, there is no need to confirm it by oath.</p>
<p>6. The third is a case where one has sworn to break a commandment, as when he has sworn not to enwrap himself in a fringed garment, or not to wear <italic>tefillin</italic>, or not to dwell in a <italic>sukkah</italic> during the festival of <italic>Sukkoth</italic>, or not to eat <italic>matzah</italic> on Passover nights, or to fast on Sabbaths and festivals, or something like this.</p>
<p>7. The fourth is a case where one has sworn about something that is not within his power to do. He has, for example, sworn not to sleep for three days in succession, both night and day, or not to taste anything for seven consecutive days, or something like this. Anyone who swears a vain oath belonging to one of these four classes transgresses a prohibitive law, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain&#x201D; (Exodus 20:7). If he has committed the transgression deliberately he is to be lashed; if unintentionally, he is altogether exempt from liability.</p>
<p>8. The oath concerning a deposit is as follows: Anyone who has in his possession money belonging to another person, whether it is a deposit or a loan, or he has robbed or exploited him, or found a lost article of his and failed to restore it, or anything of the sort, if he denies when the other demands it from him, he transgresses a prohibitive law, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall not deal deceitfully&#x201D; (Leviticus 19:11). This is a warning against the denial of money due. No lashing is inflicted for transgressing this prohibition; but if he has sworn falsely concerning the money which he has denied, he has transgressed another prohibition, concerning which it is written: &#x201C;You shall not deal falsely with one another&#x201D; (11). This is a warning directed against the person who swears to deny money due. Such an oath is referred to as the oath concerning a deposit.</p>
<p>12. What is the oath of testimony? If witnesses in a case of property are summoned by the plaintiff to testify for him and they deny their knowledge of evidence and refuse to testify, swearing that they know no testimony concerning him, it is what is called the oath of testimony.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Two</h1>
<p>1. It is immaterial whether one swears any of the four types of oaths with his own lips or is adjured by others and he answers <italic>Amen;</italic> even if a non-Jew or a minor adjured him and he answered <italic>Amen</italic>, he is liable, because anyone who responds with <italic>Amen</italic> to an oath is as if he uttered it with his own lips. It makes no difference whether he answers <italic>Amen</italic> or says something that has the same meaning as <italic>Amen</italic>, as when he says &#x201C;yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;I am required to take this oath&#x201D; or &#x201C;I accept this oath,&#x201D; or anything of this sort in any language, it is as if he had indeed taken an oath which makes him liable either to lashing or to bringing a sacrifice.</p>
<p>17. If anyone had taken an oath with his lips and heart agreeing, but he immediately retracted after having bound himself, instantly, within the time required for a single utterance, such as <italic>peace be to you, Rabbi</italic>, [a pupil&#x2019;s greeting] and said: &#x201C;This is not an oath&#x201D; or &#x201C;I regret it&#x201D; or &#x201C;I retract,&#x201D; and such like expression signifying that he has set himself free from the binding oath, he is set free and the oath is removed, for he is like one who has been in error.</p>
<p>18. So too, if others told him <italic>retract</italic> or <italic>you are set free</italic>, or a similar phrase, and he acquiesced within the time required for a single utterance, and said &#x201C;yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;I retract&#x201D; or the like, he is set free; but he cannot retract after a lapse of time required for a single utterance.</p>
<p>19. If he had taken an oath and retracted in his heart within the time required for an utterance, it is of no avail. So too, if others told him <italic>retract</italic> or <italic>you are set free</italic> or <italic>you are pardoned</italic>, and in his heart he instantly acquiesced to their words, it is of no avail, unless he expresses the retraction with his lips, as in the case of the oath [which he uttered with his lips].</p>
<h1>Chapter Six</h1>
<p>1. If anyone took a rash oath and regretted it; he realized that he would suffer if he kept this oath, so he changed his mind; or something occurred to him of which he was unaware at the time of the oath, and is sorry on its account, he should apply to a sage, or to three laymen if no sage is available, and they will absolve him from his oath, and he will be permitted to do the thing he swore not to do, or not to do the thing he swore to do. This is called absolution from oaths.</p>
<p>3. No one can absolve himself from his own oath. No one may absolve an oath or a vow in a locality where there is someone greater than he in wisdom. If his own teacher is in the same place, he must not absolve without his teacher&#x2019;s consent.</p>
<p>5. How are oaths absolved? The person who took the oath should present himself to the distinguished scholar, or to three laymen if no expert is available, and say: &#x201C;I took an oath concerning this and that, and now I am sorry. Had I known that I might be distressed because of it to such a degree, or that such a thing might happen to me, I would not have taken the oath. Had I known at the time of the oath what I know now, I would not have sworn.&#x201D; Thereupon the scholar, or the eldest of the three laymen, should say to him: &#x201C;Have you regretted it indeed?&#x201D; And he should reply: &#x201C;Yes.&#x201D; Then he should say to him: &#x201C;You are set free, you are pardoned,&#x201D; or anything similar in meaning in any language. If, however, he said to him: &#x201C;Your oath is void,&#x201D; or &#x201C;Your oath is eradicated,&#x201D; or something similar in meaning, what he said is of no avail, because none except a husband or a father can revoke an oath. A scholar may use only terms of absolution and pardon.</p>
<h1>Chapter Eleven</h1>
<p>5. There are three types of oaths that are biblically imposed, namely: 1) when a man claims movable goods from his neighbor, who admits one part but denies another; 2) when he denies owing any of the movable goods claimed, but one witness testifies against him and contradicts him. These two oaths result from a positive claim and a denial. 3) So too, when a custodian pleads that the article which was deposited with him is lost, stolen, dead, or something like that, he must take an oath due to the uncertainty of the claim, since the claimant of the deposit does not know whether the custodian&#x2019;s plea is true or false. He swears a biblical oath, as it is written: &#x201C;An oath before the Lord shall decide between the two of them&#x201D; (Exodus 22:10).</p>
<p>6. Any oath administered by the judges, with the exception of these three types, is of rabbinic origin. This legal oath is referred to as the oath imposed by the judges.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>7. There is another type of oath, instituted by the talmudic sages, which is known as equitable oath. Although it is administered by the court at present, it is not called a judicial oath.</p>
<p>8. The judicial oath, whether biblical or rabbinic in origin, whether arising from a definite claim or from a doubtful claim, is administered as follows: The person who is taking the oath is holding a <italic>Sefer Torah</italic> in his arm while standing and swearing by the divine name or a substitute for the divine name, uttering the oath or curse-oath with his own lips, or it is pronounced by the judges. My teachers have taught that the judicial oath should only be administered in the holy tongue.</p>
<p>9. What is the oath formula when uttered with his own lips? He should, for example, say: &#x201C;I hereby swear by the Lord God of Israel,&#x201D; or &#x201C;by him whose name is Gracious One,&#x201D; or &#x201C;by him whose name is Merciful One, that I do not owe anything to this person&#x201D;.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>10. What is the oath formula coming from the lips of the judges? They, for example, say to him: &#x201C;We adjure you by the Lord God of Israel,&#x201D; or &#x201C;by him whose name is Merciful One, that you owe nothing to this man,&#x201D; and he answers <italic>Amen</italic>.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>13. The only difference between the equitable oath and the judicial oath rests in the holding of a sacred object; the one who takes an equitable oath is not required to hold a <italic>Sefer Torah</italic>, but is adjured by the divine name or its substitute, as he utters the oath or curse-oath with his own lips, or it is pronounced by the judges, as in the case of the judicial oath. It has become a general custom, however, that the <italic>&#x1E25;azzan</italic> of the synagogue or someone from among the people holds a <italic>Sefer Torah</italic> in his hand while the equitable oath is being administered, in order to impress the man with awe.</p>
<p>14. Judges who administer the oath in any language the swearer knows are acting within the law. Such was the decision of the Geonim. My teachers, however, taught that the oath should be administered only in the holy tongue; but it is not right to rely on this decision. Even though all courts customarily administer oaths in the holy tongue, it is important to inform the person who is taking the oath so that he may know the terms of the oath.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>15. Anyone subject to a judicial oath resulting from a definite claim and a denial &#x2014; &#x2014; should be admonished, as will be explained. There is, however, no need to admonish anyone liable to an oath on grounds of a doubtful claim.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>16. How should the one who takes an oath be admonished? He should be told: &#x201C;Know that the entire world trembled at the moment God said to Moses: You shall not bear the name of the Lord your God in vain&#x201D; (Exodus 20:7). Concerning all biblical transgressions it is written: &#x201C;The man shall be clear of guilt&#x201D; (Numbers 5:31), but here it is written: &#x201C;The Lord will not clear one who swears falsely&#x201D; (Exodus 20:7). For all biblical transgressions the guilty person alone is punished, but here both he and his family who protect him from justice are punished. Furthermore, he causes all Israel to be punished, since all Israelites are responsible for one another, as it is written: &#x201C;Nothing but perjury, lying, and murder &#x2026; therefore the land mourns, and all who dwell in it languish&#x201D; (Hosea 4:2-3).&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>17. The full substance of this admonition should be expressed to them in the language they know, so that they may understand the words and that the sinner be determined to sin no more. If he then says: &#x201C;I will not swear,&#x201D; we should exempt him from the oath, and he must pay what his neighbor claims from him. So too, if the claimant says: &#x201C;I will not make him take an oath,&#x201D; thus releasing him from the claim, they leave the court.</p>
<h1>Chapter Twelve</h1>
<p>7. If youngsters have taken an oath, understanding fully its significance, they should be compelled to abide by their spoken words; even though they are not subject to the law of fulfilling an oath, they should be trained and admonished not to take oaths lightly.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>8. One should be extremely careful with youngsters in teaching them to speak the truth without oaths, so that they should not become habituated to frequent swearing. &#x2014; &#x2014; This amounts to a duty resting upon their parents and upon the elementary teachers.</p>
<p>12. Although it is permissible to apply to a scholar for absolution from an oath, as we have explained, and there is nothing wrong in it, and if anyone has scruples in this matter he is probably under the influence of [sectarian] heresy, nevertheless it is proper to be cautious in this thing. Absolution should be attended to only for the sake of a religious duty or because of a great need. It is best for a person not to swear at all.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>VOWS</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. Vows are divided into two classes. The first class relates to a person who forbids himself things that are permitted to him, as when he says: &#x201C;Let the fruit products of a certain country be forbidden to me for thirty days,&#x201D; or &#x201C;forever&#x201D;; or &#x201C;a certain kind of the world&#x2019;s fruit products&#x201D; or &#x201C;these fruit products shall be forbidden to me.&#x201D; No matter what language he uses in restricting himself, those things are forbidden to him even in the absence of an oath or the mention of the divine name or its substitute. In regard to this, it is written in the Torah: &#x201C;If a man makes a vow &#x2026; imposing a prohibition on himself&#x201D; (Numbers 30:3); that is, he forbids himself things that are permitted. So too, if he said: &#x201C;These things shall constitute a vow of abstinence for me,&#x201D; they are forbidden. I refer to this class of vows as vows of prohibition.</p>
<p>2. The second class relates to a person who obligates himself to offer a sacrifice that he does not owe, as when he says: &#x201C;I pledge myself to offer a burnt-offering,&#x201D; &#x2014; &#x2014; or &#x201C;let this animal be a burnt-offering&#x201D; or &#x201C;a peace offering.&#x201D; The expression <italic>I pledge myself</italic> is called a vow, while <italic>this is to be</italic> is called a donation. &#x2014; &#x2014; I refer to this class as vows of consecration.</p>
<p>4. The Torah commands every person to fulfill his oath or his vow, whether it is a vow of prohibition or a vow of consecration, as it is written: &#x201C;You must fulfill what has passed your lips and perform what you have vowed&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 23:24); and it is written: &#x201C;He must carry out all that has passed his lips&#x201D; (Numbers 30:3).</p>
<h1>Chapter Eight</h1>
<p>1. If anyone made a vow or took an oath, specifying at the same time the cause of his vow or oath, it is as if he had made his vow or oath dependent upon that cause. Hence, if the cause of his oath has not materialized, he is released.</p>
<p>2. If, for example, he vowed or took an oath: &#x201C;I will not marry that woman, because her father is an evil man; I will not come into this house, because there is a surly dog in it,&#x201D; and they died, or the father repented, he is released. For he is like one who made a vow or took an oath, saying: &#x201C;I will not marry that woman; I will not enter this house, unless the injurious factor is removed.&#x201D; This applies to all similar cases.</p>
<p>3. If, however, one takes a vow or swears: &#x201C;I will not marry that ugly woman,&#x201D; and she is found to be pretty, or &#x201C;that brunette&#x201D; and she is a blonde, or &#x201C;that short one&#x201D; and she is tall, or &#x201C;I vow that my wife shall derive no benefit from me because she stole my purse and struck my son,&#x201D; and it has become known that she neither stole nor struck, he is released, since it was an erroneous vow.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>4. Moreover, if a person saw men at a distance as they were eating his figs and he told them: &#x201C;They are prohibited to you as a sacred offering,&#x201D; but when he came closer he realized that they were his own father and brother, they are released from his vow. Even though he failed to specify the reason for which he prohibited them, it is as if he did specify, because it is obvious that he forbade them only because he thought that they were strangers. The same applies to all similar cases.</p>
<p>6. If any vow has been remitted in part, it has been remitted in its entirety. The same is true of oaths. If, for example, one noticed men at a distance as they were eating his fruit products and he said: &#x201C;These products are forbidden to you as a sacred offering,&#x201D; but upon approaching them he realized that they were his father and some strangers, they all are released from his vow along with his father. Even if he said: &#x201C;If I had known this, I would have said: &#x201C;These men are prohibited, but my father is permitted,&#x201D; they are all permitted nevertheless.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>9. If a man was asked to marry his relative and he refused; when he was urged he vowed or took an oath that she was never to derive any benefit from him; or if a man divorced his wife and swore or vowed that she was never to derive any benefit from him; either of these women may nevertheless derive a benefit from him, since his intent was confined to matrimony.</p>
<p>10. So too, if a man invited a person to dine with him, and the latter refused, swearing or vowing that he would not enter his house or drink a drop of cold water, he is nevertheless permitted to enter his house and drink his cooled beverage [on other occasions], since he merely had in mind not to eat and drink with him at this particular meal. This holds good in all similar cases.</p>
<p>13. If a man swore or vowed to take a wife, to buy a house, to join a caravan, or to go on a sea voyage, he should not be compelled to marry, buy, or leave immediately, but only after he has found a suitable occasion. It once happened that a woman made a vow to marry anyone who would propose to her, and some men who were not suitable to her snatched the opportunity and proposed to her. The sages thereupon declared: &#x201C;This woman had in mind only a suitable party asking her in marriage (Bava Kamma 80a). This applies to all similar cases.</p>
<h1>Chapter Eleven</h1>
<p>1. A Boy of twelve years and one day and a girl of eleven years and one day, who took oaths or made vows, whether vows of prohibition or of consecration, should be examined and interrogated. If they know in whose name they vowed, consecrated, and took oaths, their vows are valid and their consecration is effective; if they do not know, there is no value to their vows and verbal commitments. They should be examined concerning each vow made throughout the entire year; that is, the twelfth year in the case of a girl and the thirteenth year in the case of a boy.</p>
<p>6. What has just been stated, namely that the vows made by a girl of twelve years and one day are valid, relates to one who is not under the control of her father or her husband; but if she is under the control of her father, even if she has grown up and become a maiden, he may annul all her vows and all her oaths on the day he finds out, as it is written: &#x201C;None of her vows or self-imposed prohibitions shall stand &#x2026; since her father restrained her&#x201D; (Numbers 30:6).</p>
<p>7. Until when may her father annul them? Until she reaches maturity. Once she has reached maturity, he may no longer annul them. All her vows and oaths have the same force as the vows of a widow or a divorced woman, concerning whom it is written: &#x201C;Whatever she has imposed on herself shall be binding upon her&#x201D; (10).</p>
<h1>Chapter Twelve</h1>
<p>1. A father may annul all his daughter&#x2019;s vows or oaths the day he finds out, as it is written: &#x201C;All her vows and all her self-imposed prohibitions&#x201D; (6). The husband, however, may annul only those vows and oaths that entail self-mortification or affect their mutual relationship, as when she has sworn or vowed not to paint her eyelids or not to make herself look pretty, as it is written: &#x201C;Between a man and his wife&#x201D; (17).</p>
<h1>Chapter Thirteen</h1>
<p>23. If a person has made vows in order to adjust his characteristic traits and to improve his behavior, he is indeed alert and deserves praise. Examples: One who was a glutton forbade himself meat for a year or two; or one who was addicted to drinking forbade himself wine for a long time, or vowed never to become intoxicated. So too, one who ran after bribes, hastening to get rich, forbade to himself the gifts or the favors coming from the residents of a particular town. So too, one who became arrogant because of his good looks vowed to become a nazirite. Such vows are designed to serve God, and concerning them the sages declared: &#x201C;Vows are a fence around self-restraint&#x201D; (Avoth 3:17).</p>
<p>24. Even though they are a form of divine service, one should not impose on himself many vows of prohibition nor make frequent use of them, but should rather abstain from things that are to be shunned, without making vows.</p>
<p>25. The sages have asserted: &#x201C;Anyone who makes a vow is as if he built a high place for idolatry&#x201D; (Nedarim 60b). If he transgressed and made a vow, it is his duty to seek absolution from his vow, so that it might not become an obstacle on his way.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>NAZIRITESHIP</title>
<h1>Chapter Two</h1>
<p>20. Naziriteship was observed both during the time of the Temple and after the time of the Temple. Accordingly, if anyone has vowed nowadays to become a nazirite, he becomes a lifelong nazirite, for we have no Temple where he might offer his sacrifices on the day his term as nazirite is completed.</p>
<p>21. Naziriteship is observed only in Eretz Yisrael. If a man took the nazirite vow in the Diaspora, he is fined and compelled to go to Eretz Yisrael to be a nazirite there for the number of days he specified in the nazirite vow.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>22. As long as he is outside Eretz Yisrael, he is forbidden to drink wine, defile himself for the dead, or cut his hair; he must observe all the details of naziriteship, even though these days are not counted. If he transgresses by drinking wine, cutting his hair, touching a corpse or the like, he is to be lashed.</p>
<h1>Chapter Three</h1>
<p>1. The duration of unspecified naziriteship is thirty days. If, for example, one said &#x201C;I will be a nazirite,&#x201D; he becomes one for no less than thirty days.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. If he specified a period of less than thirty days, as when he said: &#x201C;I will be a nazirite for one day,&#x201D; or &#x201C;ten days,&#x201D; or &#x201C;twenty days,&#x201D; he becomes a nazirite for thirty days, since there can be no naziriteship for less than thirty days. This law is based on tradition.</p>
<p>13. Samson was not a complete nazirite, because he had not taken the nazirite vow, but the angel separated him from uncleanness. What was his legal status? He was forbidden to drink wine and cut his hair, but was permitted to defile himself for the dead. This, too, is based on tradition.</p>
<p>14. Accordingly, if anyone said: &#x201C;I will be a nazirite like Samson,&#x201D; he becomes a lifelong nazirite, kept from cutting his hair and drinking wine. He must not cut his hair every twelve months, like other lifelong nazirites, but he may defile himself for the dead.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Ten</h1>
<p>14. If a man said: &#x201C;I will be a nazirite if I will perform this or that,&#x201D; or &#x201C;if I will not perform,&#x201D; or something of the sort, he is a sinful person; such naziriteship is of the sinful. If, however, one vows to God in a way of holiness, he does a good thing and deserves praise. Concerning such a man it is written: &#x201C;His consecration to God is upon his head &#x2026; he is consecrated to the Lord&#x201D; (Numbers 6:7-8). Scripture considers him the equal of a prophet, as it is written: &#x201C;I raised up some of your sons as prophets, and some of your young men as nazirites&#x201D; (Amos 2:11).</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>GIFTS TO THE POOR</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. When a man reaps the harvest of his field, he must not reap the entire field but should leave some standing grain at the end of the field for the poor, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall not reap all the way to the edge of your field&#x201D; (Leviticus 23:22). It is immaterial whether he reaps or plucks up by the root. What he leaves is called <italic>peah</italic> (field corner).</p>
<p>2. Just as a man must leave <italic>peah</italic> in the field, so must he leave a little for the poor when he picks fruit from the trees.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>4. The same law applies to gleanings: when he reaps the harvest and binds the sheaves, he must not gather up the fallen ears of grain but must leave them for the poor, as it is written: &#x201C;You must not gather the gleanings of your harvest&#x201D; (22).&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>5. The same law applies to grape gleanings during vintage; so too, the young grapes, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall not pick your vineyard bare, or gather the fallen fruit of your vineyard; you shall leave them for the poor and the stranger&#x201D; (19:10). So too, if the binder of sheaves has forgotten a sheaf in the field, he must not turn back to get it, as it is written: &#x201C;If you forget a sheaf in the field, do not turn back to get it&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 24:19).&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>6. Just as the law of forgetting applies to sheaves, so it applies to standing grain: if he has forgotten to reap some standing grain, it belongs to the poor. And just as the law of forgetting applies to grain and the like, so it applies to trees, as it is written: &#x201C;When you shake the fruit from your olive trees, do not go over the branches a second time&#x201D; (20). The same applies to other trees.</p>
<p>7. Hence you learn that four gifts are reserved for the poor in the vineyard: single grapes, young grapes, <italic>peah</italic>, and the forgotten grapes; three gifts in grain: gleanings, the forgotten sheaf, and <italic>peah;</italic> two in trees: the forgotten fruits, and <italic>peah</italic>.</p>
<p>15. What limit is prescribed for <italic>peah</italic>? Biblically it has no prescribed limit: even if one left a single ear of grain he has fulfilled his duty. Rabbinically, however, <italic>peah</italic> should not be less than one-sixtieth part of the harvest, whether in Eretz Yisrael or in the Diaspora. One should add to the one-sixtieth according to the size of the field and the number of the poor and the yield of the harvest. Example: If a field is too small, so that one-sixtieth of it would be of no help to the poor, he should increase the rate. So too, if there are many poor people, he must increase it. If he sowed little and harvested much, having prospered, he should increase it in accord with the blessed crop. Whoever increases the rate of <italic>peah</italic> will receive a higher reward. There is no prescribed limit to this increase.</p>
<h1>Chapter Six</h1>
<p>1. Another gift, a sixth one, is reserved for the poor in the yield of the land; it is the tenth part given to the poor, which is called the poor man&#x2019;s tithe. The order of priestly contributions and of tithes follows:</p>
<p>2. When a man has finished reaping the grain of the land or picking the fruit of the trees, he sets aside one-fiftieth, referred to as great <italic>terumah</italic>, and gives it to a priest, as it is written in the Torah: &#x201C;You shall give him the first fruits of your new grain and wine and oil&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 18:4). Then he sets aside one-tenth of the rest, referred to as first tithe, and gives it to a Levite, as it is written: &#x201C;The tithes set aside by the Israelites &#x2026; I give to the Levites&#x201D; (Numbers 18:24); and it is written: &#x201C;And to the Levites I give all the tithes in Israel&#x201D; (21).</p>
<p>3. Then he sets aside one-tenth of the remainder, referred to as second tithe, which belongs to the owner who consumes it in Jerusalem, as it is written: &#x201C;If a man wishes to redeem his tithe&#x2026;&#x201D; (Leviticus 27:31). &#x201C;You shall set aside a tenth part &#x2026; and you shall consume it in the presence of the Lord your God in the place which he will choose&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 14:22-23).</p>
<p>4. This order of tithing is followed during the first year of the seven-year cycle, as well as the second, fourth, and fifth. During the third year of the seven-year cycle as well as the sixth, however, one sets aside another tithe of what remains after the first tithe and gives it to the poor; it is called the poor man&#x2019;s tithe. During these two years there is no second tithe, but poor man&#x2019;s tithe.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>5. During the sabbatical year, all agricultural products are considered ownerless [and available to all]. No <italic>terumah</italic> contributions and no tithes are given away that year at all, neither first nor second nor poor man&#x2019;s tithe.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>6. The Levite sets aside one-tenth of the first tithe he has received and gives it to a priest; this is called the <italic>terumah</italic> of the tithe.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>7. The field owner gives to every poor man passing by his field some of the tithe he has, so that the poor may eat their fill, as it is written: &#x201C;That they may eat their fill in your settlements&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 26:12).</p>
<p>13. If a man and a woman come into the house, the woman is treated first; after she has been attended to, the man is given his share. In cases of a father and his son, a man and his relative, two brothers, two partners, one of whom being poor, the other may give him his tithe that is reserved for the poor.</p>
<p>14. If two poor persons have leased a field as land tenants, they exchange between them the poor man&#x2019;s tithe which they set aside.</p>
<h1>Chapter Seven</h1>
<p>1. The Torah commands us to give charity to the poor among the people of Israel, each according to his needs, if the donor can well afford it, as it is written: &#x201C;You must open your hand to him&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 15:8). &#x201C;You shall maintain him; whether stranger or sojourner, he shall live beside you&#x201D; (Leviticus 25:35). &#x201C;Let your brother live beside you&#x201D; (36).</p>
<p>2. If anyone noticed a poor man asking for something and ignored him, and failed to give <italic>tsedakah</italic>, he has broken a prohibitive command, as it is written: &#x201C;Do not harden your heart and shut your hand against your needy brother&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 15:7).</p>
<p>3. You are commanded to give the poor man whatever he needs. If he has no clothing, he should be provided with clothes; if he has no house furniture, it should be procured for him; if he has no wife, he should be helped to get married; if it is an unmarried woman, she should be provided with a husband. Even if an impoverished person is used to ride while a servant is running in front of him, a riding horse should be procured for him, and a servant to run in front of him, as it is written: &#x201C;Sufficient for whatever he needs&#x201D; (8). Though you are commanded to relieve his needs, you are not obligated to make him rich.</p>
<p>7. The non-Jewish poor should be maintained and clothed along with the Jewish poor for the sake of peaceful relations. A poor man who goes around begging should not be given a large donation but a small one. One must never turn a poor man away empty-handed, even if you give him a dry fig, as it is written: &#x201C;Let not the downtrodden turn from you disappointed&#x201D; (Psalm 74:21).</p>
<p>9. If a poor man refuses to take charity, he should be given it subtly in the form of a gift or a loan. A rich man who starves himself because he is a niggardly with his money, so that he neither eats nor drinks, should not be attended to.</p>
<p>11. It is forbidden to solicit or collect charitable contributions from an over-generous person who donates more than he can afford, or deprives himself and gives to the charity collectors in order not to be embarrassed. Any collector who embarrasses and solicits such a person will eventually be punished, as it is written: &#x201C;I will punish those who oppress him&#x201D; (Jeremiah 30:20).</p>
<p>13. A man&#x2019;s poor relative has priority over any person; the poor in his own household have priority over the poor in his town; the poor in his town have priority over the poor of another town, as it is written: &#x201C;Open your hand to your brother, to your needy, to your poor in your land&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 15:11).</p>
<h1>Chapter Nine</h1>
<p>1. Every Jewish community must appoint collectors of charity, who are trustworthy men of repute, to go about among the people each Friday, taking from every one what he can afford to give, or what he is assessed. They are to distribute the money from Friday to Friday, giving every poor man sufficient food for seven days. This is what is called <italic>kuppah</italic> (fund).</p>
<p>2. So too, collectors are appointed who fetch bread and foodstuffs from every courtyard, as well as fruit products or money, from anyone who donates for the needs of the moment. They distribute the collections among the poor in the evening, giving each pauper his daily provision. This is what is called <italic>tam&#x1E25;uy</italic> (charity plate; soup kitchen).</p>
<p>3. We have never seen or heard of a Jewish community without a charity fund; as to a <italic>tam&#x1E25;uy</italic>, however, there are localities where the custom is to have one while in others it does not exist. Nowadays there is a widespread custom that fund collectors go around collecting every day and distribute on Fridays.</p>
<p>5. The charity fund is collected by two persons only, since no less than two persons may hold public office dealing with money. It is, however, permissible to entrust the money of the fund to one person. It must not be distributed by less than three people, because it is comparable to any civil-law case [requiring three judges] inasmuch as they distribute among the poor what each needs for the week. The charity food (<italic>tam&#x1E25;uy</italic>), being indefinite, is collected by three and distributed by three [to avoid suspicion].</p>
<p>6. Charity food is collected daily, and the community fund each Friday. Charity food is for the poor that come from anywhere, while the community fund is intended for the local poor only.</p>
<p>12. If one has stayed in a town for thirty days, he should be compelled to contribute to the community fund along with the population of the town. If he has stayed there for three months, he should be compelled to contribute to the <italic>tam&#x1E25;uy;</italic> if he has stayed there for six months, he should be compelled to contribute toward the clothing of the local poor; if he has stayed there for nine months, he should be compelled to contribute to all the burial needs of the poor.</p>
<p>15. If a citizen travelling from town to town has run out of funds on the road and has nothing to eat at the moment, he is permitted to take charity, including the four gifts to the poor described in the Torah: gleanings, the forgotten sheaf, <italic>peah</italic>, and the poor man&#x2019;s tithe. He is not obligated to repay when he comes home, because he was poor indeed at the moment. He has the status of a poor man that has become rich, who does not have to pay back anything.</p>
<h1>Chapter Ten</h1>
<p>1. We must observe the precept of <italic>tsedakah</italic> more carefully than any other affirmative command, because <italic>tsedakah</italic> is characteristic of an upright person, the offspring of our father Abraham, as it is written: &#x201C;I have singled him out that he may charge his children &#x2026; to do what is right&#x201D; (Genesis 18:19). Only by means of <italic>tsedakah</italic> will the glory of Israel be reestablished and the religion of truth perpetuated, as it is written: &#x201C;In righteousness you shall be established&#x201D; (Isaiah 54:14). Israel will be liberated only through <italic>tsedakah</italic>, as it is written: &#x201C;Zion shall be redeemed by justice, <italic>tsedakah</italic> shall be the saving of those who return&#x201D; (Isaiah 1:27).</p>
<p>2. None ever becomes poor from giving charity, nothing bad or injurious is caused by <italic>tsedakah</italic>, as it is written: &#x201C;The Lord will be kind and compassionate to you and multiply you&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 13:18). If anyone is cruel and shows no mercy, there is reason to suspect his lineage. Cruelty is to be found only among the heathen, as it is written: &#x201C;They are cruel, pitiless&#x201D; (Jeremiah 50:42). All Israelites and those who associate with them are regarded as brothers, as it is written: &#x201C;You are children of the Lord your God&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 14:1). And if a brother shows no mercy to a brother, who will be compassionate to him? On whom then should the poor of Israel depend? On the people who hate them and persecute them? Alas, they must depend only on their own brethren.</p>
<p>4. Anyone who gives <italic>tsedakah</italic> to a poor person in a surly manner and with a gloomy face completely nullifies the merit of his own deed, even if he gives him a thousand gold pieces. He should rather give him cheerfully and gladly, while sympathizing with him who is in trouble, as it is written: &#x201C;Did I not weep for him whose day was hard? Was not my soul grieved for the poor?&#x201D; (Job 30:25). He should speak to him graciously and comfortingly, as it is written: &#x201C;I gladdened the heart of the widow&#x201D; (Job 29:13).</p>
<p>6. He who urges and activates others to give <italic>tsedakah</italic> receives a greater reward than the donor himself, as it is written: &#x201C;The effect of righteousness will be peace&#x201D; (Isaiah 32:17). With regard to the collectors of charity and the like, Scripture says: &#x201C;Those who turn many to righteousness shall be like the stars&#x201D; (Daniel 12:3).</p>
<p>7. There are eight degrees of charity, each one higher than the other. The highest degree is to aid a Jew in want by offering him a gift or a loan, by entering into partnership with him, or by providing work for him, so that he may become self-supporting, without having to ask people for anything. In regard to this it is written: &#x201C;You shall maintain him; whether stranger or sojourner, he shall live beside you&#x201D; (Leviticus 25:35); that is to say, maintain him so that he may not fall and be in need of help.</p>
<p>8. The next, inferior degree is when he who gives charity to the poor is unaware of the recipient, who in turn is unaware of the giver. This is indeed a religious act achieved for its own sake. It is like the chamber of secrets within the Temple, where the devout used to put their gifts in secret and the poor of good family received support from it in secret. Of a similar character is the one who contributes to a charity fund. One should not contribute to a charity fund unless he knows that the man in charge of the collections is trustworthy and intelligent and knows how to manage properly, as in the case of Rabbi &#x1E24;ananyah ben Teradyon [who administered the communal charity funds so scrupulously that once when money of his own chanced to get mixed with the charity funds, he distributed the whole amount among the poor].</p>
<p>9. The third, lesser degree is when the giver knows the recipient, but the recipient does not know the giver. The great sages used to go secretly and cast the money into the doorway of the poor. Something like this should be done, it being a noble virtue, if the charity administrators are behaving improperly.</p>
<p>10. The fourth, still lower degree is when the recipient knows the giver, but the giver does not know the recipient. The great sages used to tie money in sheets which they threw behind their backs, and the poor would come and get it without being embarrassed.</p>
<p>11. The fifth degree is when the giver puts the alms into the hands of the poor without being solicited.</p>
<p>12. The sixth degree is when he puts the money into the hands of the poor after being solicited.</p>
<p>13. The seventh degree is when he gives him less than he should, but does so cheerfully.</p>
<p>14. The eighth degree is when he gives him painfully (grudgingly).</p>
<p>18. One should ever patiently strive not to be dependent on other people and not to be a public charge. So too, the sages have enjoined us, saying: &#x201C;Rather make your Sabbath a weekday [with regard to festive meals] than be dependent on men&#x201D; (Shabbath 118a). If reduced to poverty, even a distinguished scholar must not disdain manual work, no matter how unworthy it is of him, in order to avoid dependence on others. One should preferably flay animal carcasses instead of telling the people: &#x201C;I am a great scholar, I am a priest, provide for me.&#x201D; The sages have indeed commanded us to act like this. Some of the great sages derived their livelihood from chopping wood, carrying lumber, watering gardens, working in iron or making charcoal, and asked no help of the community; neither would they have accepted charity had it been offered them.</p>
<p>19. If anyone is not in need of relief and yet receives it by deceiving the public, he will not die of old age before becoming a public charge. Such a person is included in the biblical utterance: &#x201C;A curse on him who relies on man&#x201D; (Jeremiah 17:5). On the other hand, if anyone is vitally in need of relief, and simply cannot go on living without obtaining it, as in the case of an indigent old man who is ill and suffering, and yet he is too proud to accept help, he is guilty of bloodshed in committing a deadly sin.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>PRIESTLY OFFERINGS</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. Priestly gifts and tithes are biblically applicable only in Eretz Yisrael, both during the time of the Temple and after the time of the Temple. The prophets, however, made them applicable also in Babylonia, which is close to Eretz Yisrael and many Jews commute from there. The ancient sages made them applicable also in Egypt, Ammon and Moab, because these countries are close to Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p>2. Wherever Eretz Yisrael is spoken of, the reference is to territories occupied by a king of Israel, or a prophet, with the consent of a majority of Israel; it is called a national conquest [so as to give it the character of the holy Land]. On the other hand, if an individual Israelite, or members of a family or tribe, went ahead and occupied a locality for themselves, even if it was part of the land given to Abraham, it would not be called Eretz Yisrael in terms of all the <italic>mitzvoth</italic> applicable to the Holy Land. For this very reason, Joshua and his court distributed all of Eretz Yisrael among the tribes long before it was actually occupied by them, so that when each tribe would ascend and occupy its share it should not be regarded as an individual conquest.</p>
<p>3. The lands which David occupied outside the land of Canaan, such as Mesopotamia and Aram Tzova and A&#x1E25;lav, even though he was king over Israel and acted upon the decision of the supreme court, count neither as Eretz Yisrael nor as Diaspora in every respect; they are not like Babylonia and Egypt, for example, but are classified as outside the Holy Land and yet unlike it [as to special laws operative only in Eretz Yisrael]. Why are they of a lower degree than Eretz Yisrael? Because David occupied them before occupying all of Eretz Yisrael, where some remnants of the seven nations of Canaan were left. Had David occupied the entire land of Canaan with its various boundaries and then the other lands, all his conquests might then have assumed the sanctity of Eretz Yisrael, in every respect. The lands conquered by David are referred to as Syria.</p>
<p>4. Syria is like Eretz Yisrael in regard to certain laws, and in certain respects it is like Diaspora. If a man has acquired land in Syria, it is as if he acquired it in Eretz Yisrael with regard to heave-offerings, tithes, and the sabbatical year. All the laws pertaining to Syria are rabbinic enactments.</p>
<p>5. The part of Eretz Yisrael that was occupied by those who had come up from Egypt received the first consecration, which ceased to be as soon as they were exiled. The first consecration, resulting from the mere conquest, applied only for the time being [while inhabited and ruled by Israelites] and not for the future. As soon as the returned exiles came up and occupied part of the land, they consecrated it a second time with a sanctity lasting forever, both for the time being and the future. They retained, however, certain laws which had been operative in the places occupied by those who had come up from Egypt and unoccupied by those who arrived from Babylonia. These were not exempted from heave-offerings and tithes, so that the poor might rely on them during the sabbatical year.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>6. Hence, the entire world is divisible into three classifications: Eretz Yisrael, Syria, and the Diaspora. Eretz Yisrael, in turn, is divisible into two parts: the one which was occupied by the returned exiles from Babylonia, and the second which was occupied only by those who had come up from Egypt. The Diaspora is divisible into two parts: Egypt, Babylonia, Ammon and Moab are lands where the special laws are to be observed by the authority of sages and prophets; while in the other countries the laws of heave-offerings and tithes are not to be observed.</p>
<h1>Chapter Three</h1>
<p>1. The great <italic>terumah</italic> [given to priests] has biblically no prescribed limit, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall give him the first fruit of your new grain&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 18:4); that is, anything: even one particle of wheat may exempt a heap of grain.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. But what proportion has been prescribed by the sages? A generous person gives one-fortieth of the crop; the average person gives one-fiftieth; the miserly gives one-sixtieth. One must not give less than one-sixtieth.</p>
<p>4. The priestly <italic>terumah</italic> is not given by measure, weight or number, because no limit has been stated in the Torah with regard to heave-offerings. One should estimate in his mind and set aside about one-sixtieth.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>12. The duty concerning a <italic>terumah</italic> of the tithe concerns the Levite who must give to a priest a tenth of the tithe he receives, as it is written: &#x201C;When you receive from the Israelites their tithes &#x2026; you shall remove from them one-tenth of the tithe&#x2026;&#x201D; (Numbers 18:26). A lay Israelite may set it aside and give it to a priest and then give the tithe to a Levite, after having removed from it the <italic>terumah</italic> which is known as a tithe from the tithe.</p>
<p>23. The <italic>terumah</italic> and the tithe are to be set aside according to the following order: the first fruits are set aside first of all, then the great <italic>terumah</italic>, then the first tithe, then the second tithe, or else the tithe for the poor.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Six</h1>
<p>1. <italic>Terumah</italic> and tithe of the Levite&#x2019;s tithe [given to priests] may be eaten by priests, whether adults or minors, males or females, and Canaanite slaves and cattle belonging to priests.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>3. If the daughter of a non-priest married a priest, she may eat <italic>terumah</italic>.</p>
<p>5. A non-priest is forbidden to eat <italic>terumah</italic>, as it is written: &#x201C;No lay person shall eat of holy things&#x201D; (Leviticus 22:10), even one who lives with a priest or is his hired worker, as it is written: &#x201C;No sojourner or a hired worker of a priest may eat of holy things&#x201D; (10). <italic>Sojourner</italic> here means a lifelong hireling, while <italic>hired worker</italic> denotes one hired by years. A Hebrew slave has the status of a sojourner and a hireling. If a priest&#x2019;s daughter married a lay person, she assumed the status of a lay person, as it is written: &#x201C;<italic>No</italic> lay person,&#x201D; that is, neither he nor his wife.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>TITHING</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. Having set apart the <italic>terumah gedolah</italic> [great gift or the priest&#x2019;s share of the crop], one must set apart one-tenth of the rest, what is known as first tithe. &#x2014; &#x2014; This tithe is intended for the Levites, whether male or female, as it is written: &#x201C;To the Levites I have given every tithe in Israel as their share&#x201D; (Numbers 18:21).</p>
<p>2. The first tithe may serve as food for a lay Israelite; he may partake of it even in a state of ritual uncleanness, since no sanctity whatever is attached to it.&#x2014; &#x2014; Whence do we know that the first tithe is free for common use? It is written: &#x201C;Your gift shall be regarded as though it were the grain of the threshing floor or the wine of the vat&#x201D; (27); that is to say, just as the grain of the threshing floor and the wine of the vat are altogether free for common use, so the first tithe, from which the priest&#x2019;s share has been removed, is free for common use in every respect.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>3. Levites and priests [who happen to own farm products] set apart the first tithe so as to remove from it the priest&#x2019;s share of the tithe. So too, the priests set apart other <italic>terumoth</italic> and tithes for their own use, since they only receive from all [and are not required to give away anything to other priests]. One might think that they are allowed to eat their farm products untithed, but the Torah explicitly declares: &#x201C;Thus shall you too set aside a gift&#x201D; (28). Traditionally interpreted, <italic>you</italic> refers to the Levites; <italic>you too</italic> includes the priests as well.</p>
<h1>Chapter Eight</h1>
<p>1. The products from which the great <italic>terumah</italic> and the <italic>terumah</italic> of the tithe have been removed are called <italic>&#x1E25;ullin</italic> [and are free for common use]. If one has removed the remaining tithes from them, they are termed properly-treated <italic>&#x1E25;ullin</italic> in every respect.</p>
<h1>Chapter Nine</h1>
<p>1. In the days of Yo&#x1E25;anan the high priest, who was after Simeon the Just, the supreme court sent men to investigate the entire Jewish territory. They discovered that all the people carefully set apart the great <italic>terumah</italic> [priest&#x2019;s share], but that the illiterate Jews among them made it easy for themselves by not setting apart the first tithe, the second tithe and the poorman&#x2019;s tithe. For this reason, they decreed that only faithful people might be trusted as to the tithes. On the other hand, the farm products belonging to the illiterate were to be regarded as doubtful, since they could not be trusted when they asserted that the products were tithed. This is what is called <italic>demai</italic> [doubtful tithing].</p>
<p>2. They furthermore ordained that one should remove from <italic>demai</italic> only the priest&#x2019;s share of the tithe, because it involves a sin punishable by death, and also the second tithe, which involves no loss since it is consumed by the owner himself. As to the first tithe and the poorman&#x2019;s tithe, however, one is not called upon to set them apart from the <italic>demai</italic>, being a matter of doubt, in which case the rule is that the claimant must produce evidence in order to collect. Accordingly, one may say to the Levite or the poor person: Produce evidence that the product is not tithed, and you will obtain tithes.</p>
<h1>Chapter Fourteen</h1>
<p>1. If one has purchased grain from a wholesale dealer one time and then again, he must not give tithe from the one purchase for the other, even though they are of the same kind or from the same basket, and even though he can identify the barrel as the same [from which he obtained the two purchases. This is so] because the wholesale dealer buys from many people and sells, and it may be that the man who has sold the grain had bought it from an illiterate, whose products are deemed <italic>demai;</italic> and this one, in turn, who has bought it at the end, has done so from one who strictly observes the rules of tithing and whose products are in order. We have already explained that tithes may not be given from what is required for what is exempt, nor from what is exempt for what is required. If, however, the wholesale dealer said &#x201C;they are from the same lot,&#x201D; he should be believed.</p>
<p>6. If one buys from a bakery shop, he should give tithe from one loaf for all the others, even though they are of many shapes.&#x2014; &#x2014; If, however, one buys from a monopolized shop, he should tithe from each different shape of loaf, because the monopolized shop has probably bought the bread from two bakers.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>FIRST FRUITS</title>
<h1>Chapter Two</h1>
<p>1. It is a positive biblical command to bring first fruits to the sanctuary; they apply only in Eretz Yisrael in the time of the Temple, as it is written: &#x201C;The choice first fruits of your soil you shall bring to the house of the Lord your God&#x201D; (Exodus 23:19).&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. First fruits are brought only from the seven species which are spoken of in praise of the land, namely: wheat, barley, grapes, figs, pomegranates, olives, and dates. If one had brought products other than the seven species, they were not consecrated.</p>
<h1>Chapter Three</h1>
<p>10. It is a positive biblical command to confess in the sanctuary over the first fruits at the moment they are presented. One should begin by reciting: &#x201C;I acknowledge this day before the Lord your God that I have come into the land which the Lord solemnly promised to our fathers&#x2026; My father was a wandering Aramean&#x2026;&#x201D; He should continue to the end of the biblical section which concludes with the words &#x201C;which thou, O Lord, hast given me&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 26:3-10). This acknowledgment must be recited in the holy tongue only, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall then recite as follows&#x201D; (5), meaning: in this [Hebrew] tongue.</p>
<p>11. Originally, anyone who could recite the prescribed biblical passage recited it; and if anyone could not recite it, he was assisted in reciting it. But when those illiterates refrained from bringing their first fruits, that they might not be put to shame, it was ordained by the court that both those that knew and those that did not know should be made to repeat the words [after the priest].</p>
<h1>Chapter Four</h1>
<p>16. How were the first fruits brought up to Jerusalem? The men of all the smaller towns that belonged to the <italic>Maamad</italic> [one of the twenty-four divisions in the outlying districts] gathered together in the town of the <italic>Maamad</italic> [leader], so as not to come up to Jerusalem as isolated individuals, as it is written: &#x201C;In a multitude of people is the glory of a king&#x201D; (Proverbs 14:28). Having arrived, they spent the night in the open street of the town and did not enter the homes for fear of contracting uncleanness therein. Early in the morning, the officer of the <italic>Maamad</italic> said: &#x201C;Arise, and let us go up to Zion, to the Lord our God&#x201D; (Jeremiah 31:5). In front of them went the ox, having its horns overlaid with gold and a wreath of olive-leaves on its head, to indicate that the first fruits were taken from the seven species of farm products. The flute was played in front of them until they reached near Jerusalem. As they walked all the way, they chanted: &#x201C;I was glad when they said to me: Let us go up to the house of the Lord&#x201D; (Psalm 122:1). They walked only two thirds of the day. Upon arriving at the outskirts of Jerusalem, they sent messengers to let the men of Jerusalem know. They bedecked their first fruits and adorned them, placing the fresh ones on top of the dry. The high officers and the treasurers of the Temple came out of Jerusalem to meet them. They used to come out according to the number of those who arrived: if many pilgrims arrived, they were greeted by many; and if few, by few. When all of them entered within the gates of Jerusalem, they began to chant: &#x201C;Our feet stand at last within your gates, O Jerusalem&#x201D; (2).</p>
<p>17. All the craftsmen in Jerusalem used to rise up before them and greet them, saying: &#x201C;Brethren, men of such-and-such a place, you are welcome&#x0021;&#x201D; The flute was played in front of them as they marched inside Jerusalem until they reached the Temple Mount. Having arrived at the Temple Mount, each pilgrim would take his basket on his shoulder as they chanted: &#x201C;Praise the Lord&#x0021; Praise God in his sanctuary&#x2026; Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Praise the Lord&#x201D; (Psalm 150). They marched on the Temple Mount chanting until they reached as far as the Temple Court. When they reached the Temple Court, the Levites sang: &#x201C;I extol thee, O Lord, for thou hast lifted me&#x2026;&#x201D; (30:2).</p>
<h1>Chapter Eleven</h1>
<p>1. By a biblical positive command, each Israelite must redeem his son, the firstborn of an Israelite mother, as it is written: &#x201C;Every firstborn belongs to me&#x201D; (Exodus 34:19); and it is written: &#x201C;You shall have the firstborn of man redeemed&#x201D; (Numbers 18:15).</p>
<p>5. The man who redeems his son should recite this blessing: &#x201C;Blessed art thou &#x2026; who hast sanctified us with thy commandments, and commanded us concerning the redemption of the firstborn son.&#x201D; Then he should recite: &#x201C;Blessed art thou &#x2026; who hast granted us life and sustenance and permitted us to reach this festive occasion.&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>6. This religious duty is applicable everywhere and at all times. For what price does he redeem him? For five shekels, as it is written: &#x201C;The redemption price for the child of one month is the equivalent of five shekels&#x201D; (16).&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>8. If the <italic>kohen</italic> is willing to return the redemption price, he may do so. Yet, the infant&#x2019;s father must not give the <italic>kohen</italic> the redemption price with the intention that he should return it. If he acted in this manner, and the <italic>kohen</italic> returned the money, the firstborn son is not redeemed. He must resolve in his mind to present him with an absolute gift; and if the <italic>kohen</italic> is willing to return it thereafter, he may do so. So too, if he specified the condition that the <italic>kohen</italic> should return the gift that he had handed him, his son is redeemed.</p>
<p>9. Priests and Levites are exempt from redeeming their firstborn.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>17. When is one required to redeem his son? When the firstborn has completed thirty days, as it is written: &#x201C;The redemption price for the child of one month&#x201D; (16). If the firstborn son died during the thirty days, even on the thirtieth day, or if the child became afflicted with a fatal organic disease, the father is not required to pay five shekels.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>20. If a man&#x2019;s wife had never before given birth, and now she gave birth to twins, a boy and a girl, without knowing which of the two emerged first, the <italic>kohen</italic> receives nothing in such a case. If she gave birth to two boys, the father should give the <italic>kohen</italic> five shekels, even though it is not known which of them is the firstborn. If, however, one of the twins died during the thirty days, he is exempt from paying the redemption price, in keeping with the rule that the claimant must produce evidence.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>26. If the wives of two men gave birth to boy twins for the first time each, and the infants were mingled together, then each father should give five shekels. &#x2014; &#x2014;</p>

<chapter>
<title>SABBATICAL YEAR AND JUBILEE</title>
<h1>Chapter Eight</h1>
<p>1. In a like manner, as it is forbidden to till the soil in the seventh year, so is it forbidden to encourage Jewish persons who cultivate it, or to sell them working tools, because help must not be given to those who commit a transgression.</p>
<p>2. A craftsman may not sell the following tools in the seventh year to one who is suspected of ignoring the laws of the sabbatical year: a plough and all its accessories, a yoke, a winnowing fan, or a pick. This is the general rule: any tool used exclusively for the kind of work which is forbidden in the seventh year must not be sold to a suspected transgressor.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>8. Non-Jews, however, may be encouraged in the seventh year with words alone. If, for example, one sees a non-Jew plowing or sowing, he should greet him with such expressions as: &#x201C;Be of good courage&#x0021;&#x201D; or &#x201C;Good luck&#x0021;&#x201D; For, they are not under the obligation of observing the sabbatical of the land. Nevertheless, one should not help them manually.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Nine</h1>
<p>1. It is a biblical positive command to cancel a cash debt in the sabbatical year, as it is written: &#x201C;Every creditor shall remit the due that he claims from his neighbor&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 15:2). If a man claims a debt which has remained over the sabbatical year, he breaks a prohibitive command, as it is written: &#x201C;He shall not exact it of his neighbor, his brother&#x201D; (2).</p>
<p>2. The law concerning remission of funds is biblically applicable only at a time when the jubilee is observed, involving the remission of landed property, inasmuch as land then returns to its original owner without payment. This rule is based on tradition. The sages have declared: At a time when you remit landed property you must remit funds at any place, whether in Eretz Yisrael or in the Diaspora; and when remission of land no longer exists, you are not required to remit funds in the seventh year, even in Eretz Yisrael (Mo&#x2018;ed Katan 2b).</p>
<p>15. If one delivered his bonds to the court and said to them: &#x201C;You will collect this debt for me,&#x201D; it is not canceled, as it is written: &#x201C;You must remit whatever is due you from your brother&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 15:3), and in this case it is the court that exacts payment from him.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>16. When Hillel the Elder saw that the people refrained from giving loans one to another and transgressed what is written in the Torah: &#x201C;Beware lest you harbor the base thought&#x2026;&#x201D; (9), he ordained a <italic>prozbul</italic> whereby a loan is secured and not cancelled, so that the people might extend loans mutually. The <italic>prozbul</italic> is effective only in regard to remission of cash debts at the present time, being applicable on rabbinic grounds; the biblical remission, however, cannot be counteracted by the <italic>prozbul</italic> at all.</p>
<p>18. This is the formula of the <italic>prozbul:</italic> &#x201C;I inform you, judges so-and-so in such-and-such locality, that I will collect any debt due to me whenever I please.&#x201D; And the judges, or witnesses, sign below.</p>
<h1>Chapter Ten</h1>
<p>1. It is a biblical positive command to count off seven times seven years and to consecrate the fiftieth year, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall count seven weeks of years &#x2026; and you shall hallow the fiftieth year&#x201D; (Leviticus 25:8-10). These two precepts are within the power of the supreme court alone.</p>
<p>2. When did they begin to count the jubilees? Fourteen years after they had entered Eretz Yisrael.&#x2014; &#x2014; Hence you may say [that they began to count] in the year two thousand five hundred and three after the Creation, from the new year following the birth of the first man, being the second year of Creation.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>3. The Israelites counted seventeen jubilees from the time they entered the land until they left. The year in which they left, when the First Temple was destroyed, happened to be the year following the sabbatical year and the thirty-sixth year of the jubilee, since the First Temple lasted four hundred and ten years. As soon as the Temple was destroyed, this counting ceased. When it ceased, the land remained desolate for seventy years, and then the Second Temple was built. It lasted four hundred and twenty years. Ezra came up [from Babylonia to Judea] in the seventh year of its erection. This was the second coming [to the land]. From that year on, they began to use a different counting. They made the thirteenth year of the construction of the Second Temple to serve as <italic>shemittah</italic> (year of release), and counted seven <italic>shemittoth</italic> and hallowed the fiftieth year. Although no jubilee was observed during the period of the Second Temple, they counted its years in conjunction with the <italic>shemittoth</italic> which they did hallow.</p>
<p>4. Hence you may infer that the year in which the last Temple was destroyed, beginning with <italic>Tishri</italic> or two months following the destruction, since the count of <italic>shemittoth</italic> and jubilees is from <italic>Tishri</italic>, was the year after the sabbatical year and the fifteenth year of the ninth jubilee. According to this computation, the present year, the year one thousand one hundred and seven since the destruction, which is the year one thousand four hundred and eighty-seven of the Seleucidan Era, used in dating documents, which is four thousand nine hundred and thirty-six since the Creation, is a sabbarical year and the twenty-first year of jubilee.</p>
<p>14. From <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> until <italic>Yom Kippur</italic>, the slaves [who were to be freed on the occasion of the jubilee year] neither left for their homes nor were they still subjected to their masters, nor were the fields restored to their original owners. The slaves would eat and drink and rejoice as they were wearing wreaths on their heads. As soon as <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> arrived, the court sounded the <italic>shofar</italic>. Thereupon the slaves left for their homes and the fields returned to their original owners.</p>
<p>16. The sabbatical year surpassed the jubilee year in that it cancelled cash debts while the jubilee did not. On the other hand, the jubilee year surpassed the sabbatical year in that it freed the slaves and cancelled land purchases.&#x2014; &#x2014; The jubilee cancelled land purchases at its very beginning, while the sabbatical year cancelled cash debts only at its conclusion, as we have explained.</p>
<h1>Chapter Eleven</h1>
<p>1. Any part of Eretz Yisrael, which had been divided among the tribes could not be sold in perpetuity, as it is written: &#x201C;The land must not be sold beyond reclaim&#x201D; (Leviticus 25:23). If anyone sold it in perpetuity, both seller and purchaser broke a prohibitive command; their actions were of no avail; the land had to revert to its original owner in the jubilee year.</p>
<p>2. If, however, a man sold his field for the duration of sixty years, it did not revert in the year of jubilee: only what was sold without specification, or what was sold in perpetuity, reverted in the year of jubilee.</p>
<p>3. One must not sell his house or his hereditary field, even though they will revert after some time, unless he has become poor, as it is written: &#x201C;When your brother is reduced to poverty and has to sell part of his property&#x201D; (25). But one is not permitted to sell it and put the money into his pocket or into business, or spend it on furniture, slaves and cattle; he may sell it only for food provisions. Nevertheless, if he sold it at any rate, the sale is valid.</p>
<h1>Chapter Twelve</h1>
<p>1. If a man sold a house within a walled city, he may redeem it at any time he pleases within the twelve months of the sale, even on the day he made the sale. If he desires to redeem it, he must repay the entire price he took and cannot deduct anything at the expense of the purchaser.</p>
<p>7. If the day ending the twelve-month period arrived and the purchaser was not available to redeem from him, the man may deposit his money at the court, break the door and enter his house; and when the purchaser arrives, he can appear at the court and collect his money.</p>
<p>9. If anyone sold a house in a walled city and jubilee arrived within the year of the sale, it does not revert because of the jubilee, but remains with the purchaser until the seller is willing to redeem it throughout the year of the sale; or else, it is sold irredeemably if the year is completed.</p>
<p>10. If anyone sold a house in a village, or in a city that is not adequately encircled by a wall, it is redeemable by the legal right applied to the sale of fields, and of houses within a walled city. If, for example, the seller wished to redeem it immediately, he can do so in accord with the law governing the sale of houses. If twelve months passed and he failed to redeem it, he can do so until the year of jubilee, in accord with the law governing the sale of fields.</p>
<p>15. Only an encircling wall existing at the time of the conquest of Eretz Yisrael is to be relied upon [in connection with the law of redemption]. If, for example, a city that was unwalled at the time Joshua conquered the land is walled at present, it is nevertheless counted as a village as to the sale of its houses. On the other hand, a city that was walled in the time of Joshua, even though it is not walled at present, has the legal status of a walled city. When the people were exiled after the destruction of the First Temple, the sanctity of the walled towns during the period of Joshua ceased to exist. But as soon as Ezra came up with the second migration, all the walled towns of that time were consecrated, because their arrival at the time of Ezra, called the second arrival, was comparable to that of the time of Joshua: on both historic occasions, they began counting <italic>shemittoth</italic> and jubilees, having consecrated the walled towns and obligated themselves to observe the laws of tithing.</p>
<p>16. So too, in the future, during the third coming of Israel: when they will enter the land, they will begin counting the <italic>shemittoth</italic> and the jubilees; they will consecrate the houses of the walled cities, and every place they will occupy will be required to maintain the system of tithing.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Thirteen</h1>
<p>1. Although the tribe of Levi was not allotted a share in the land, the Israelites had already been commanded to assign to them special towns to dwell in, and pasture lands surrounding them. Those towns included the six cities of refuge as well as forty-two additional localities.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>12. Why were the Levites not allotted land in Eretz Yisrael or a share in its booty along with their brethren? Because they were singled out to serve the Lord and minister to him, to teach his upright ways and just laws to many people, as it is written: &#x201C;They shall teach thy laws to Jacob, and thy instruction to Israel&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 33:10). For this reason, they were separated from worldly affairs: they fought no battles like the rest of Israel; they inherited no land; they won nothing by means of their physical ability. They are indeed the Lord&#x2019;s army, as it is written: &#x201C;Bless, O Lord, his substance&#x201D; (11). He, blessed be he, has won them for himself, as it is written: &#x201C;I am your portion and your share&#x201D; (Numbers 18:20).</p>
<p>13. Not only the tribe of Levi, but each well-informed thinking person whose spirit moves him to devote himself to the service of the Lord, to know the Lord, and has walked uprightly after casting off his neck the yoke of many a cunning wile that men contrived, is indeed divinely consecrated, and the Lord will forever and ever be his portion. God will provide sufficiently for his needs, as he did for the priests and the Levites. David, may he rest in peace, declared: &#x201C;The Lord is my allotted portion and my cup; thou holdest my lot&#x201D; (Psalm 16:5).</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>THE TEMPLE</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>2. As soon as the Israelites entered Eretz Yisrael, they set up the portable sanctuary (<italic>Mishkan</italic>) in Gilgal for the fourteen years during which they occupied and divided the land. From there they came to Shiloh and built a sanctuary of stones, over which they spread the curtains of the <italic>Mishkan</italic>, since it had no ceiling. The sanctuary of Shiloh lasted three hundred and sixty-nine years. It was destroyed when Eli died, so they came to Nov and built a sanctuary there. It was destroyed when Samuel died, so they came to Gibeon and built a sanctuary there. From Gibeon they came to Jerusalem to build the permanent sanctuary. Nov and Gibeon lasted fifty-seven years.</p>
<p>3. As soon as the Temple was built in Jerusalem, it was prohibited to build a sanctuary for the Lord or to offer a sacrifice in any other place. Only the Temple in Jerusalem, on Mount Moriah, was intended for all generations.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Four</h1>
<p>1. There was a stone at the western side of the Holy of Holies, on which the Ark was placed, and in front of it there was the jar of manna as well as the staff of Aaron. When Solomon built the Temple, knowing that it would at the end be destroyed, he constructed underneath a place where to hide the Ark in deep and winding secret tunnels. At the command of King Josiah, it was concealed in the place which Solomon had built.&#x2014; &#x2014; Along with it were concealed the staff of Aaron, the jar of manna, and the anointing oil. None of these reappeared in the Second Temple. Even the <italic>Urim</italic> and <italic>Tummim</italic>, which were available in the Second Temple, no longer responded prophetically, nor were they consulted.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Five</h1>
<p>1. The Temple Mount, which is Mount Moriah, was five hundred cubits long and five hundred cubits wide, and was surrounded by a wall.&#x2014; &#x2014; It was all roofed over, a colonnade within a colonnade.</p>
<p>2. It had five gates: one on the west, one on the east, one on the north, and two on the south. Each gate was ten cubits wide and twenty cubits high; each had doors.</p>
<p>3. Within, there was a latticed railing ten handbreadths high, encircling all around. Inside the latticed railing was the defensive rampart, ten cubits high. &#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Six</h1>
<p>1. The entire Temple was not on level ground, but on the slope of the mountain. When a person entered from the east gate of the Temple Mount, he would walk on level ground till the end of the rampart. From the rampart he would ascend twelve steps to the Women&#x2019;s Court, the height of each step being half a cubit and its tread half a cubit.</p>
<p>2. He would then walk the entire length of the Women&#x2019;s Court on level ground. From there he would ascend fifteen steps to the Israelite Court, which was the beginning of the Temple Court. The height of each step was half a cubit and its tread half a cubit.</p>
<h1>Chapter Eight</h1>
<p>1. It is a biblical positive command to guard the sanctuary, even in the absence of fear of enemies or marauders, since by guarding the sanctuary honor is accorded to it. A palace that is attended by guards is quite unlike a palace that is not attended by guards.</p>
<p>2. The duty of guarding the sanctuary is applicable all through the night, with the priests and the Levites serving as the guards.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>4. The duty of guarding it is fulfilled by the priests guarding from within and the Levites from without [the Temple Court]. Twenty-four groups would guard the sanctuary every night continuously at twenty-four posts; the priests at three posts, and the Levites at twenty-one posts.</p>
<p>10. One officer was placed in charge of all the guards, and he was called Officer of the Temple Mount. He used to go round to every watch all night, with lighted torches in front of him. If any guard did not stand up and say to him: &#x201C;Officer of the Temple Mount, peace be with you,&#x201D; it was evident that he slept, so he would beat him with his cane. He had the right to burn his clothing. They used to say in Jerusalem: &#x201C;What is the noise in the Temple Court? It is the noise of some Levite being beaten and having his clothing burned because he slept during his watch.&#x201D;</p>
<p>11. In the morning, before daybreak, but close to it, the Temple officer would come and knock on the door of the priests who were at the chamber of the hearth, and they would open the door for him. He took the key and opened the small gate between the chamber of the hearth and the Temple Court. He entered the Temple Court from the chamber of the hearth, and the priests followed him with two lighted torches in their hands. They separated into two groups, the one going eastward and the other going westward. They kept searching the entire Court.&#x2014; &#x2014; When they all arrived, they said: &#x201C;Peace, all is well&#x0021;&#x201D; &#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>14. They followed this procedure each night, except Sabbath nights, when they had no lighted torches in their hands but searched by means of the lamps which were lit in the Court since Sabbath eve.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>TEMPLE UTENSILS</title>
<h1>Chapter Three</h1>
<p>1. The entire progeny of Levi was set apart to do the work inside the sanctuary, as it is written: &#x201C;At that time the Lord set apart the tribe of Levi&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 30:8). A biblical positive command imposes upon the Levites to be free and ready to do work inside the sanctuary, whether they are willing or not, as it is written: &#x201C;Only Levites shall perform service inside the Tent of Meeting&#x201D; (Numbers 18:23). If a Levite accepted all the levitical assignments except one, he was rejected unless he accepted all of them.</p>
<p>2. Their function was to guard the Temple. Some of them acted as gatekeepers, to open the gates of the sanctuary and to shut its doors; while some served as singers, to chant during the daily offerings.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>3. &#x2014; &#x2014; There were never less than twelve Levites standing on the platform daily to chant during the sacrificial service, but their number could be increased without end. They sang by word of mouth alone, without instrument, because the singing as a form of service is essentially restricted to vocal music. However, there were others standing there and playing musical instruments; some were Levites, and some lay Israelites of distinguished birth, eligible to marry off their daughters into priestly families, for none but of distinguished lineage might ascend the platform. Those who used musical instruments when they sang were not included among the twelve.</p>
<p>4. What instruments did they play? Lyres, flutes, harps, trumpets, and cymbals. &#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>7. No Levite would enter the Temple Court to do his work unless he had been trained for five years, as it is written: &#x201C;This is the rule for the Levites, from twenty-five years of age up&#x2026;&#x201D; (Numbers 8:24); and another verse says: &#x201C;From thirty years of age up&#x2026;&#x201D; (4:3). How is this? It is a difference of five years of training.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>9. Samuel the prophet and David the king divided the Levites into twenty-four divisions; each division served for one week. The chief of a division divided the men of his division into subdivisions [family groups].&#x2014; &#x2014; The chiefs of the subdivisions distributed assignments among those serving on their particular day, each man performing his own task.</p>
<h1>Chapter Four</h1>
<p>1. The priests were set apart from the general Levites for the performance of sacrificial service.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. Every Jew ought to treat those of priestly lineage with great deference in all sacred matters: a <italic>kohen</italic> should be first in reading the Torah, first in reciting a blessing, and first in receiving a fine portion.</p>
<p>3. Our teacher Moses divided the priests into eight divisions, four from the family of Elazar and four from the family of Ithamar. They functioned that way until the time of Samuel the prophet, when he and King David divided them into twenty-four divisions. A chief was named over each division. One division a week would go up to Jerusalem for service. The divisions would change every Sabbath day, one leaving and the next one entering, until the cycle was completed. Then they would begin the cycle over again.</p>
<p>11. The chief of each division would divide his division into subdivisions, referred to as family groups; so that a complete subdivision with its men would perform service one day in the week, another doing service on the following day, and still another on the third day. Each subdivision was headed by an officer of its own.</p>
<p>12. When a high priest was appointed as the head of all the priests, he was anointed with anointing oil and clothed with the vestments of the high priesthood. &#x2014; &#x2014; If no anointing oil was available, he was merely clothed with the larger number of [eight instead of four] vestments designed for the high priesthood. &#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>13. How was he invested with the clothes of high rank? He put on the eight garments and then removed them, and the following day he put them on again, repeating this for seven days in succession, as it is written: &#x201C;The son who becomes priest in Aaron&#x2019;s place shall put them on seven days&#x201D; (Exodus 29:30). Just as the rite of investing the sacred garments was performed for seven days, so was the anointing with oil carried out for seven consecutive days.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>15. Only the supreme court of seventy-one was entitled to appoint a high priest. He was anointed only during daytime, as it is written: &#x201C;In the day he is anointed&#x201D; (Leviticus 6:13).&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>16. A priest was appointed to serve the high priest as a viceroy. He was called both deputy high priest and appointed officer, and always stood at the right hand of the high priest as a token of respect. The other priests stood below the deputy.</p>
<h1>Chapter Five</h1>
<p>1. The high priest had to excel his fellow priests in beauty, strength, wealth, wisdom, and appearance. If he had no wealth, all the priests gave him of their own, each according to his means, until he became richer than the richest among them.</p>
<p>3. The high priest was required to maintain his self-respect and was not to act frivolously among the rest of the people.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>4. He was not to enter a house of feasting or a public banquet, even if they were religious celebrations. He might, however, go to a house of mourning, if he wished, but not in a mixed crowd with other priests; they were merely to encircle him and treat him with deference. The deputy high priest placed himself between him and the people.&#x2014; &#x2014; He would say to the mourners: &#x201C;May you be comforted,&#x201D; and they would honor him as much as they could.</p>
<h1>Chapter Six</h1>
<p>1. It was not possible to offer a man&#x2019;s sacrifice when he was not standing nearby. The communal offerings were on behalf of all Israel, and it was impossible that all the people of Israel should be standing in the Temple Court during the sacrificial service. Accordingly, the ancient prophets ordained that the upright and sin-fearing men should be selected from among Israel as the representative messengers of all Israel to stand by the sacrificial services. They were called Men of the Post. They were divided into twenty-four posts, corresponding to the number of the priestly and levitical divisions. Over the men of each post there was one appointed to be in charge, and he was referred to as the chief of the post.</p>
<p>2. The Men of the Post of any particular week assembled during that week. Those who were in Jerusalem or close by came to the Temple with the priestly and levitical divisions of that week. Those who were far away assembled in the synagogue of their place as soon as [the turn of] their post arrived.</p>
<p>3. What were those men doing, who assembled either in Jerusalem or in the synagogues? They fasted on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday of their particular week.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>4. Every day of the week of their post they prayed four times: morning prayer, afternoon prayer, closing prayer (<italic>ne&#x2018;ilah</italic>), and an additional prayer between the morning and afternoon prayers.&#x2014; &#x2014; On Friday they would not assemble for the afternoon prayer, being preoccupied with preparations for the Sabbath.</p>
<p>5. Their foregathering for each of these four prayer services, and their remaining there for prayer, supplication and petition, and for the reading of the Torah, is referred to as <italic>ma&#x2018;amad</italic> (post).</p>
<h1>Chapter Seven</h1>
<p>1. There were fifteen appointed officers in the Temple.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. Each of these officers had under his control many men to prepare the work under his charge. The one in charge of the schedule, together with his men, supervised the schedule. As soon as the time arrived for the sacrificial service, he or one of the men under his control would make the following announcement: &#x201C;Arise, priests, for the service; Levites, to the platform; Israelites, to the post&#x0021;&#x201D; As soon as his voice was heard, each one came to his assignment,</p>
<p>3. The officer in charge of closing the gates&#x2014;by his instruction, they closed or opened them; only with his permission were the trumpets sounded daily for the opening of the gates. They blew three blasts in the Temple every day for the opening of the gates: a sustained blast, a quavering blast, and a sustained blast.</p>
<p>4. The officer in charge of the guards was the superintendent of the Temple Mount; he went round every night inspecting the Levites. It was he who struck with his cane and burned the clothing of anyone found sleeping on his watch.</p>
<p>5. The officer in charge of the singers daily selected the singers who were to stand on the platform and chant without the use of musical instruments. By his instruction, they blew the trumpets during the sacrificial service.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>6. &#x2014; &#x2014; All those who blew the blasts during the sacrificial service were under the control of the officer in charge of the singers. Trumpets were used for all these blasts.</p>
<p>7. The officer in charge of the cymbal was the one who assigned all those who played musical instruments, assisting the Levites, as we have explained.</p>
<p>8. The officer in charge of the lots would cast the lots among the priests every day, so that everyone performed his task won by lot. Lots were cast four times a day; and in the section dealing with the rules concerning daily offerings, I will explain how they were cast.</p>
<p>14. The priests had sick stomachs, because they constantly stood barefoot on the Court pavement, consumed much meat, and wore nothing but a shirt during the sacrificial service. For this reason, an officer was appointed to examine them and cure all their ailments; he was constantly taken up with them, he and the men under him.</p>
<p>15. So too, an officer was appointed to dig wells and trenches, and keep the public wells in good repair, so that water would be available in Jerusalem for all its residents and all the pilgrims.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>20. The officer in charge of making the priestly garments was occupied with weaving and preparing the vestments of ordinary priests and those of the high priest. Everything was performed under his supervision. He had special quarters in the Temple.</p>

<chapter>
<title>DAILY AND ADDITIONAL OFFERINGS</title>
<h1>Chapter Four</h1>
<p>1. All these services that were performed every day were done by lot. How did they do it? All the priests of the subdivision of the day entered the chamber of hewn stone after daybreak &#x2014; &#x2014; and the officer in charge of the lots was with them. They stood in a circle, and the officer took a mitre from the head of one of them and put it back, to indicate the man from whom the counting was to begin. The lot was then cast, as will be explained.</p>
<p>3. How was the lot cast? The priests stood in a circle and agreed upon a number: eighty, a hundred, a thousand, or any other number upon which they happened to agree. Then the officer said to them: &#x201C;Raise your fingers&#x0021;&#x201D; They thrust out their fingers, one or two &#x2014; &#x2014; and the officer began to count from the indicated person whose mitre he had removed at first. He counted by their fingers, going round and round until he finally reached the number upon which they had agreed. The person at whose finger the number was reached came out first in the lot for the service.</p>
<p>4. Why was the number agreed upon counted on the thrust-out fingers and not on the individuals themselves? Because it is forbidden to count Israelites except by means of some other object, as it is written: &#x201C;He numbered them by sheep&#x201D; (I Samuel 15:4).</p>
<h1>Chapter Seven</h1>
<p>3. On Passover, the additional offering was presented every day, from the first to the seventh day, like the additional offering of <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh</italic>. &#x2014; &#x2014; On the second day of Passover, which is the sixteenth day of <italic>Nisan</italic>, they presented a lamb as a burnt-offering, together with the sheaf of wave offering, over and above the daily additional offering. &#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>11. This sheaf came from barley, in accord with an ancient tradition transmitted from our teacher Moses. How was it made ready? On the eve of the festival messengers of the supreme court came out and tied the grain in bunches while still attached to the ground to make it easier to reap. All the nearby towns-people assembled, that it might be reaped with much pomp. Three measures of barley were reaped by three men, in three baskets, with three sickles. As soon as it grew dark, each reaper called out to all who were standing there: &#x201C;Has the sun set?&#x201D; They replied: &#x201C;Yes&#x0021;&#x201D; &#x201C;Has the sun set?&#x201D; They replied: &#x201C;Yes&#x0021;&#x201D; &#x201C;Has the sun set?&#x201D; They replied: &#x201C;Yes&#x0021;&#x201D; &#x201C;Is this a sickle?&#x201D; They replied: &#x201C;Yes&#x0021;&#x201D; &#x201C;Is this a sickle?&#x201D; &#x201C;Yes&#x0021;&#x201D; &#x201C;Is this a sickle?&#x201D; &#x201C;Yes&#x0021;&#x201D; &#x201C;Is this a basket?&#x201D; &#x201C;Yes&#x0021;&#x201D; &#x201C;Is this a basket?&#x201D; &#x201C;Yes&#x0021;&#x201D; &#x201C;Is this a basket?&#x201D; &#x201C;Yes&#x0021;&#x201D; If it was on a Sabbath, he called out: &#x201C;Is today Sabbath?&#x201D; and they replied: &#x201C;Yes&#x0021;&#x201D; &#x201C;Is today Sabbath?&#x201D; &#x201C;Yes&#x0021;&#x201D; &#x201C;Is today Sabbath?&#x201D; &#x201C;Yes&#x0021;&#x201D; Then he asked them: &#x201C;Shall I reap?&#x201D; and they replied: &#x201C;Yes&#x0021;&#x201D; &#x201C;Shall I reap?&#x201D; &#x201C;Yes&#x0021;&#x201D; &#x201C;Shall I reap?&#x201D; &#x201C;Yes&#x0021;&#x201D; Everything was repeated three times.</p>
<p>12. Why was all this required? Because of the heretical Sadducees who deviated from the Jewish community during the period of the Second Temple, asserting that the biblical expression <italic>on the day after the sabbath</italic> (Leviticus 23:11), [used in connection with the <italic>omer</italic> offering] refers to the original Sabbath. But traditionally interpreted, this verse refers to the festival and not to the Sabbath. This was the view of the prophets and the Sanhedrin at all times from generation to generation: they waved the <italic>omer</italic> on the sixteenth of <italic>Nisan</italic>, whether it was a weekday or a Sabbath. It is written in the Torah: &#x201C;You shall eat no bread or parched grain or fresh ears [of the new crop] until that very day&#x201D; (14); and it is written: &#x201C;The day after Passover, they ate some of the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched grain&#x201D; (Joshua 5:11). Were you to say that that Passover happened to occur on a Sabbath, as the foolish [heretics] have imagined, then why has Scripture made the permission to eat of the new grain depend on something that is not the essential factor but merely accidental? Since, however, Scripture has indeed made the matter depend on <italic>the day after Passover</italic>, it becomes obvious that <italic>the day after Passover</italic> is the determining factor that makes the new grain permissible, without paying attention to the day of the week that happens to coincide with it.</p>
<p>13. It is forbidden to reap any one of the five kinds of grain in Eretz Yisrael before the reaping of the <italic>omer</italic> (sheaf of wave-offering), as it is written: &#x201C;The first of your harvest&#x201D; (Leviticus 23:10), meaning that it should be the first of all that is harvested.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>22. It is a biblical positive command to count seven full weeks from the day that the <italic>omer</italic> is brought, as it is written: &#x201C;From the day after the sabbath, the day you bring the sheaf of wave-offering, you shall count seven full weeks&#x201D; (15). The days must be counted along with the weeks, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall count fifty days&#x201D; (16). The counting must be performed from the beginning of the day. Accordingly, one is to do the counting at night, beginning with the night preceding the sixteenth of <italic>Nisan</italic>.</p>
<p>23. If one forgot and failed to count at night, he may count at daytime. The counting must be performed while standing; but if one counted while sitting, he has fulfilled his duty.</p>
<p>24. Every Jew is required to perform this duty, everywhere and at all times. Women and slaves, however, are exempt from it.</p>
<p>25. Every night, before counting, one is required to recite the following blessing: &#x201C;Blessed art thou, Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us with thy commandments, and commanded us concerning the counting of the <italic>omer</italic>.&#x201D; If one has counted without the blessing, he has fulfilled his duty, and need not count over again.</p>

<chapter>
<title>SACRILEGE</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. A non-priest is forbidden to derive any benefit from things consecrated to God, whether they are designed as offerings upon the altar or as offerings for the repair of the Temple. Anyone who derived personal enjoyment from things consecrated to God to the extent of a penny has committed sacrilege.</p>
<h1>Chapter Eight</h1>
<p>8. One ought to consider the laws of the Torah and to penetrate into their ultimate significance as much as he can. If, however, he cannot discover the reason and is ignorant of the basic cause of a law, he should not regard it with contempt. Let him not break through to ascend to the Lord, lest he break out against him (Exodus 19:24). His thinking about it must not be like his thinking concerning secular matters.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, how strict the Torah is with regard to sacrilege. If wood and stones, earth and ashes, became consecrated as soon as the name of the eternal Lord was called upon them, and anyone who put them to secular use committed sacrilege and required atonement even if he acted unwittingly, how much more should man take care not to regard with contempt the laws which God wrote down for us, simply because he happens to be ignorant of their basic reason. One must not impute to God things that are not right, nor regard the precepts as he would secular things. It is indeed written in the Torah: &#x201C;You shall faithfully observe all my statutes and all my laws and do them&#x201D; (Leviticus 19:37). The sages interpreted this verse to mean that we must observe and do the statutes just as well as the laws. What <italic>performance</italic> denotes is known, namely: one must do the statutes; <italic>observance</italic>, on the other hand, means that one should be careful about them and not imagine that they are less important than the laws. The laws are duties the reason of which is obvious, and the benefit derived in this world from doing them is known; for example, the prohibition against robbery and bloodshed, or the precept of honoring father and mother. The statutes are precepts the reason of which is not known, &#x2014; &#x2014; such as the prohibition against pork and that against meat-milk mixture, the laws concerning the heifer with the broken neck, the red cow, or the goat that is sent away to the wilderness. &#x2014; &#x2014; The Torah places the commandment concerning the statutes first, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall observe my statutes and my laws, by the performance of which man shall live&#x201D; (Leviticus 18:5).</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>PILGRIM OFFERING</title>
<h1>Chapter Two</h1>
<p>1. Women and slaves are exempt from appearance in the Temple. But it is required of all men to appear in the Temple as pilgrims, unless one is deaf, speechless, insane, or a minor, or blind, lame, unclean or uncircumcised. So too, the aged and the sick, the very tender and delicate, who cannot go up to the Temple on their own feet. All these eleven are exempt.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>3. If a minor can hold his father&#x2019;s hand and go up from Jerusalem to the Temple Mount, his father is required to take him up to appear in the Temple, in order to train him in the performance of religious duties.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Three</h1>
<p>1. It is a biblical positive command to assemble all Israelites, men, women, and children, after the close of every sabbatical year, when they go up to make the pilgrimage, and recite to them sections from the Torah which will urge them to perform the precepts and encourage them to cling to the true religion, as it is written: &#x201C;At the end of every seven years, the year set for remission, at the festival of <italic>Sukkoth</italic>, when all Israel comes to appear before the Lord &#x2026; gather the people, men, women, and children, and the strangers within your towns&#x2026;&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 31:10-12).</p>
<p>2. Anyone who is exempt from appearance in the Temple is exempt from the duty to assemble [at the close of the sabbatical year], except women, children, and the uncircumcised.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>3. When were the biblical sections read? At the close of the first festival day of <italic>Sukkoth</italic>, being the beginning of the intermediate days of the feast, in the eighth year. It was the king who read to them, and the reading took place in the Court of Women. He might read sitting; but if he read standing, it was deemed praiseworthy. From where in the Torah did he read? From the beginning of the book of Deuteronomy to the end of the <italic>Shema</italic> section (6:9), resuming at <italic>If you will carefully obey</italic> (11:13), thence beginning at <italic>You shall set aside every year a tenth part</italic> (14:22), continuing in due order until the end of the blessings and the curses (27:15-28:69), as far as: <italic>in addition to the covenant which he had made with them at Horev</italic> (28:69). And there he stopped.</p>
<p>4. How did he read? Trumpets were blown throughout Jerusalem to assemble the people; and a high platform, made of wood, was brought and set up in the center of the Court of Women. The king went up and sat there so that his reading might be heard. All the Israelite pilgrims would gather round him. The <italic>&#x1E25;azzan</italic> of the synagogue would take a <italic>Sefer Torah</italic> and hand it to the head of the synagogue, and the head of the synagogue would hand it to the deputy high priest, and the deputy high priest to the high priest, and the high priest to the king, to honor him by the service of many persons. The king would receive it standing or sitting, as he pleased. He would open it and look in it, reciting the blessing used by anyone who reads the Torah in the synagogue. He would read the sections we have mentioned until he would come to the end. Then he would roll up the <italic>Sefer Torah</italic> and recite a blessing after the reading, the way it is recited in the synagogue.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>5. The Torah reading and the blessings had to be in the sacred tongue, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall read this Torah&#x201D; (31:11), in its very language, even though there might be there persons using a foreign language.</p>
<p>6. Proselytes who did not know Hebrew were required to direct their hearts and listen with utmost awe and reverence, as on the day the Torah was given at Sinai. Even great scholars who knew the entire Torah were required to listen with utmost attention. If there was a person who could not hear, he had to direct his heart to this reading, which Scripture has instituted only for the purpose of strengthening the true faith. Each had to regard himself as if he had been charged with the Torah now for the first time, and as though he had heard it from the mouth of God, for the king was an ambassador proclaiming the words of God.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>FIRSTLINGS</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. It is a positive command to set apart every male firstborn, whether among human beings or among clean cattle or among the donkey species, whether they are unharmed or diseased, as it is written: &#x201C;Consecrate to me every firstborn, man or beast; every firstborn among the Israelites is mine&#x201D; (Exodus 13:2). All these belong to the priests.</p>
<p>2. The firstborn of a human being and the firstborn of a donkey must be redeemed, and their redemption price is given to the priests. The firstborn of clean cattle is to be slaughtered in the Temple Court, like other things holy in a minor degree.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>3. If the firstborn of a clean animal was blemished, it had to be given to the priest, whether it was blemished from birth or it became blemished after it had been perfect. If the priest wanted to, he might eat it anywhere, sell it, or serve it as food to anyone he pleased, even to a non-Jew, since it was permissible for common use.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Six</h1>
<p>1. It is a positive command to set apart one out of ten from all clean cattle which are born to any man each year. This command applies only to herds or flocks, as it is written: &#x201C;All tithes of the herd or flock &#x2026; shall be holy to the Lord&#x201D; (Leviticus 27:32).</p>
<p>3. All are required to give tithe from cattle: priests, Levites, and lay Israelites.</p>
<h1>Chapter Seven</h1>
<p>1. If a man had ten lambs and he set apart one of the ten, or if he had a hundred and he set ten apart as tithe, they are not valid tithe. But how should one act? He must gather all the lambs or all the calves into the fold and make an opening so small that two cannot get out at the same time. Their dams are left outside bleating, so that the lambs hear their voice and leave the fold to meet them, as it is written: &#x201C;All that passes under the shepherd&#x2019;s staff&#x201D; (32), meaning that each must pass under the staff of itself, and not that the owner should pull it out. When they emerge from the fold, one after the other, the owner begins to count: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and the lamb which comes out tenth, whether male or female, unblemished or blemished, he marks with red paint and says: &#x201C;This is tithe.&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>7. Young lambs are not like untithed farm products from which it is forbidden to eat until they are tithed.&#x2014; &#x2014; One may sell or slaughter whatever he pleases before he performs the tithing; then the tithe animal is consecrated and consumed in a legally prescribed manner.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>8. The sages appointed three seasons in the year for tithing cattle, and when one of these seasons arrives one must not sell or slaughter until he has given tithe.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>CORPSE DEFILEMENT</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. A corpse makes unclean by contact, by carrying, and by overshadowing, and it is a seven-day uncleanness.</p>
<p>3. Wherever uncleanness by contact is spoken of, whether the reference is to a corpse or other things that defile, it is understood that the person has touched the unclean thing itself with his flesh. Whether he has touched it with his hand or foot or with any other part of his flesh, or even with his tongue, he has become unclean. &#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>5. Just as a person becomes unclean by touching an unclean thing, so do utensils become unclean by contact with an unclean thing, except pottery which is rendered unclean only through its airspace.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Five</h1>
<p>1. All that becomes unclean because of a corpse is unclean seven days, whether human beings or utensils. If, for example, a person or an object touched any of the things that transmit corpse uncleanness by contact, or became unclean by the overshadowing of the things which transmit uncleanness by overshadowing; so too, if a man carried any of the things that transmit uncleanness by carrying&#x2014;they all are unclean seven days, as it is written: &#x201C;Whoever enters the tent and whatever is in the tent shall be unclean seven days&#x201D; (Numbers 19:14).</p>
<p>2. If a person has become unclean by a corpse, the objects he touches incur the seven-day uncleanness, as it is written: &#x201C;On the seventh day you shall wash your clothes and be clean&#x201D; (31:24). But if a man has touched a person who has become unclean by a corpse &#x2014; &#x2014; he is unclean until evening, as it is written: &#x201C;And the person who touches him shall be unclean until evening&#x201D; (19:21).</p>
<p>3. If utensils became unclean by a corpse, whether by contact or by overshadowing, they are like the corpse itself to whatever touches them: just as the corpse transmits seven-day uncleanness to what touches it, whether it is a human being or utensils, so do utensils which became unclean by a corpse: the utensils or persons that touch them contract seven-day uncleanness.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>6. If pottery touched a corpse or was with it in a tent, it is unclean; but it transmits uncleanness neither to persons nor to other utensils, because pottery never becomes a cause of defilement, whether on account of a corpse or any other unclean object. This law, though a tradition, is as good as a law specified in the Torah.</p>
<p>7. This is an important general rule concerning unclean objects: Every principal cause of defilement transmits uncleanness to human beings and to garments and utensils &#x2014; &#x2014; and whatever transmits uncleanness by contact to persons and to utensils is a principal cause of defilement. Every secondary cause of defilement transmits uncleanness to foodstuffs and liquids, but does not transmit uncleanness to persons and objects, whether pottery or any other utensils or clothing.</p>
<p>8. Anything that touches a principal cause of defilement is called first-grade uncleanness; if it touches first-grade uncleanness, it is referred to as second-grade uncleanness; if it touches second-grade uncleanness, it is referred to as third-grade uncleanness; and if it touches third-grade uncleanness, it is referred to as fourth-grade uncleanness. First-grade uncleanness and the uncleanness of lesser degrees are referred to as derivative uncleanness.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>LEPROSY DEFILEMENT</title>
<h1>Chapter Sixteen</h1>
<p>10. The Hebrew term for leprosy is a homonym embracing various meanings. The whiteness in a man&#x2019;s skin is called leprosy; the falling off of some hair on the head or the chin is named leprosy; and a change of color in clothing or in houses is referred to as leprosy. Now this change in clothes and in houses which the Torah has called leprosy, as a homonym, is not a natural phenomenon, but was deemed a sign and a wonder among the people of Israel to warn them against evil gossip. If a man dealt out malicious gossip, the walls of his house would change; if he repented, the house would become clean again. But if he persisted in his wickedness until the house was demolished, leather objects in his home upon which he would sit or lie would then suffer a change; if he repented, they would become clean again. But if he persisted in his wickedness until they had to be burned, the clothes which he wore would undergo a change; if he repented, they would become clean again. But if he persisted in his wickedness until they had to be burned, his skin would suffer a change and he would become leprous, and be set apart and exposed all alone, so as not to engage in evil talk, which consists of mockery and malicious gossip.</p>
<p>In warning against this, the Torah says: &#x201C;In an attack of leprosy you shall be careful&#x2026; Remember what the Lord your God did to Miriam on the journey&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 24:8-9). The Torah means to say: Consider what happened to Miriam the prophetess who spoke against her brother, even though she was older than he, and had nurtured him on her knees after having endangered her life to save him from the sea. Now she did not disparage him but made the only mistake in placing him on a level with other prophets, and he did not mind all this, as it is written: &#x201C;Moses was a very humble man&#x201D; (Numbers 12:3). And yet, she was immediately punished with leprosy. How much more then is this applicable to evil men, those fools, who keep talking arrogantly and boastfully.</p>
<p>It is therefore proper for the man who would steer his course of life aright to shun their company and refrain from talking with them, that he should not be caught in the net of evil and arrogant men. The company of wicked mockers follows this usage: At the outset, they indulge in much idle talk, as it is written: &#x201C;A fool&#x2019;s voice comes with a multitude of words&#x201D; (Ecclesiastes 5:2). Thereupon they fall into discrediting the upright, as it is written: &#x201C;Let dumbness strike the lying lips that speak insolence against the just&#x201D; (Psalm 31:19). Then they get into the habit of talking against the prophets and discrediting their words, as it is written: &#x201C;They mocked God&#x2019;s messengers, despised his words, and derided his prophets&#x201D; (II Chronicles 36:16). Then they come to speak against God and to deny the very principle of religion, as it is written: &#x201C;The Israelites devised things that were not right against the Lord their God&#x201D; (II Kings 17:9). It is written moreover: &#x201C;They set their mouthings against heaven, and their tongue roams the earth&#x201D; (Psalm 73:9). What caused them to set their mouthings against heaven? Their tongue, which first roamed the earth. Such is the conversation of the wicked, occasioned by their sitting at street corners, the meeting places of the ignorant, and the company of drunkards in the taverns. The conversation of worthy Jews, on the other hand, is permeated with words of Torah and wisdom. For this reason, God lends them aid and bestows wisdom upon them, as it is written: &#x201C;When those who revered the Lord spoke to each other, the Lord heeded and heard them, and a book of remembrance was written before him of those who revered the Lord and ahhered to him&#x201D; (Malachi 3:16).</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>FOOD DEFILEMENT</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. Any food designed for man, such as bread, meat, grapes, olives and the like, is susceptible to uncleanness; whatever is not used as food by man is clean, and is not susceptible to uncleanness unless one has assigned it as food for man. In either case it can contract uncleanness only if it is first mixed with one of seven liquids; this is what is called <italic>hekhsher</italic> (defilement fitness), as it is written: &#x201C;If water is put on the seed and such a carcass falls upon it, it shall be unclean for you&#x201D; (Leviticus 12:38).</p>
<p>2. The seven liquids which render foodstuffs susceptible to uncleanness are: water, dew, oil, wine, milk, blood, and honey.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>4. No liquid other than the seven liquids which we have enumerated contracts uncleanness; but other fruit juices do not contract any uncleanness at all, just as they do not render foodstuffs susceptible to uncleanness.</p>
<h1>Chapter Sixteen</h1>
<p>8. Whatever is written in the Torah and in traditional lore about the rules relating to things unclean or clean is only in connection with the Temple and its sacred objects, heave-offerings and second tithe. The Torah warns those who are unclean against entering the Temple or eating anything that is hallowed, or <italic>terumah</italic> or tithe, while in a state of uncleanness. But no such prohibition applies to common food; it is permissible to eat common food that is unclean and to drink liquids that are unclean. It is written in the Torah: &#x201C;Meat that touches anything unclean shall not be eaten&#x201D; (7:19), implying thereby that common food is permissible; the Torah speaks there only of the meat of sacred offerings. &#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>12. Although it is permissible to eat defiled food and to drink defiled liquids, the saintly men of early times used to eat their common food in a state of purity, and were cautious of any uncleanness throughout their lifetime. Hence they were called <italic>Perushim</italic> [the separated Pharisees]. This is extreme holiness and a way of saintliness, when a man separates himself from the rest of the people without either touching them or eating and drinking with them. Abstinence leads to physical purity from evil doings; physical purity leads to spiritual holiness; and spiritual holiness leads to being godlike, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall sanctify yourselves and be holy&#x2026; I the Lord make you holy&#x201D; (20:7-8).</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>MIKVAOTH</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. Whatever is defiled, whether human beings or utensils, whether rendered unclean by some grave uncleanness on biblical grounds or by some uncleanness on rabbinic grounds, can become clean only by immersion in water that is gathered on the ground [not within a receptacle].</p>
<h1>Chapter Four</h1>
<p>1. According to biblical law, any water that is gathered may be used for immersion, as it is written: &#x201C;A gathering of water&#x201D; (Leviticus 11:36), of any kind; provided that there is enough of it to fill up the measure required for the complete immersion of a man&#x2019;s entire body. The sages have calculated the measure to be one cubit square by three cubits deep. This quantity holds forty <italic>seahs</italic> (sixty gallons) water, whether drawn or undrawn [from any kind of receptacle].</p>
<p>2. According to rabbinic law, drawn water [from any receptacle] is not valid for immersion.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Eleven</h1>
<p>12. It is obviously clear that the laws concerning defilements and purities are biblical decrees, and not things which the human mind can determine; they are classified as divine statutes. So too, immersion as a means of ridding oneself from defilement is included among the divine statutes. Defilement is not mud or filth to be removed with water, but is a matter of biblical decree; it depends on the heart&#x2019;s intent. Accordingly, the sages have declared: If a man immersed himself, but without a definite purpose in view, it is as though he had not immersed himself at all. Nevertheless, there is some ethical allusion to this: just as one who sets his mind on becoming clean becomes clean as soon as he has immersed himself, even though nothing new is produced in his physical being, so one who sets his mind on purifying himself from all the spiritual defilements, namely wrongful thoughts and evil traits, becomes clean as soon as he made up his mind to abstain from those notions, and brought his soul into the waters of reason. Indeed, Scripture declares: &#x201C;I will pour clean water over you, and you shall be clean; from all your impurities and idolatries I will cleanse you&#x201D; (Ezekiel 36:25).</p>

<title>DAMAGES BY PROPERTY</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. If any living creature under a man&#x2019;s control caused damage, the owner of the animal must compensate, because the injury was occasioned by his chattel, as it is written: &#x201C;If a man&#x2019;s ox hurt the ox of another man&#x2026;&#x201D; (Exodus 21:35), implying not only domestic animals but also wild beasts and birds. In using the term <italic>ox</italic>, the Torah merely speaks of a common occurrence.</p>
<p>2. How much must the owner compensate? If the animal occasioned damage by doing habitual things within its nature, as when it ate straw or hay or inflicted injury with its foot in the course of walking, the owner must pay full compensation with the best of his estate, as it is written: &#x201C;He shall make restitution with the best of his own field and the best of his own vineyard&#x201D; (Exodus 22:4). If, however, the animal acted strangely and did things that were not habitual, as when an ox gored or bit, the owner has to pay only half-damages from the body of the injurious animal itself, as it is written: &#x201C;They shall sell the live ox and divide the money&#x201D; (Exodus 21:35).</p>
<p>3. Accordingly, if an ox worth one hundred denars gored an ox worth twenty and killed it, and the carcass is worth four, the owner of the goring ox has to pay eight, amounting to half of the remaining damage, which is to be paid only from the body of the ox that caused the damage, as it is written: &#x201C;They shall sell the live ox&#x2026;&#x201D; Hence, if an ox worth twenty killed an ox worth two hundred, and the carcass is worth one hundred, the owner of the carcass cannot say to the owner of the live ox &#x201C;give me fifty,&#x201D; since the latter may say to him: &#x201C;Here is the ox that caused the damage, take it and go.&#x201D; This relates even to an ox that is worth no more than one denar. The same applies to all similar cases.</p>
<p>4. An animal is called <italic>mu&#x2018;ad</italic> [and the owner stands forewarned] with regard to any damage that should be expected from a creature of its kind; an animal is called <italic>tam</italic> (harmless) with regard to any damage that is strange and unlikely to be done by an animal of its kind, as when an ox has gored or bitten. If an animal acts in a strange manner repeatedly, it becomes a <italic>mu&#x2018;ad</italic> with regard to the injurious action to which it got used, as it is written: &#x201C;If the ox is known to have been in the habit of goring&#x201D; (Exodus 21:36).</p>
<p>5. An animal is considered a <italic>tam</italic> with regard to five classes of damages, [concerning which legal warning is required before the owner is made fully responsible and liable to pay in full for any thrice-repeated act] namely: an animal is not a natural attested danger as to goring, jostling, biting, squatting upon large utensils, or kicking. If, however, it became an attested danger with respect to any of these acts, it becomes a <italic>mu&#x2018;ad</italic> in reference to it. The tooth, on the other hand, is an attested danger from the very beginning as to eating fit food; the foot is an attested danger from the very beginning as to breaking things in the course of walking; any animal is an attested danger from the very beginning as to squatting upon small pottery and the like and crushing them.</p>
<p>6. Five kinds of animals are an attested danger from the outset even when they are tamed. Hence, if any of them did damage or killed by goring, biting, clawing, or the like, the owner must restore in full. They are: the wolf, the lion, the bear, the leopard, and the panther. So too, the snake, even if tamed, is an attested donger as to biting, and the owner must pay in full for the damage done.</p>
<p>7. Any <italic>mu&#x2018;ad</italic> pays full damage, collectible from the owner&#x2019;s best property; any <italic>tam</italic> pays half-damage from the sale of its own body. This rule applies to the animal that entered the premises of the injured party and caused him damage there. If, however, the plaintiff entered the premises of the defendant and the owner&#x2019;s animal caused him damage, the defendant is exempt from any claim, for he can say to the injured party: &#x201C;If you had not entered my premises, no injury would have been inflicted upon you.&#x201D; The Torah is explicit when it says: &#x201C;If he lets his beast loose and it feeds in another man&#x2019;s field&#x2026;&#x201D; (Exodus 22:4).</p>
<p>8. If the animal caused damage in a public domain, or in a courtyard which belonged neither to the defendant nor to the plaintiff, or in a courtyard which belonged to both of them, where they both had the right of placing their produce and cattle, such as a stretch of fields and the like, the law is that if the animal caused damage by tooth or foot, in a normal manner, its owner is not liable, because it had the right to walk in various directions, and it is natural for an animal to walk about and eat or to break things as it walks along. If, however, it gored or jostled or squatted or kicked or bit, the owner must pay half-damage if it was a <italic>tam</italic>, and full-damage if it was a <italic>mu&#x2018;ad</italic>.</p>
<p>10. Three primary causes of injury are to be found in an ox: damage done by the horn, the tooth, and the foot. Subordinate damages by the horn are jostling, biting, squatting, and kicking. Subordinate damages by the tooth are in cases where the animal rubbed itself against a wall for gratification and caused damage by its rubbing, or soiled fruit products for gratification. Subordinate damages by the foot are in cases where it occasioned injury with its body while walking along, or with its hair while treading along, or by swishing its tail, or with the saddle on its back, the bridle in its mouth, or the bell on its neck. So too, if a donkey caused injury with its load as it treaded along, or a heifer occasioned injury with the wagon it was pulling. All these are sub-damages by the foot, and the owner is exempt if the injury was occasioned in a public domain, but must pay in full if it was occasioned on the premises of the plaintiff.</p>
<h1>Chapter Two</h1>
<p>1. Both the primary and the secondary causes of injury are alike: if the primary cause is considered an attested danger, the secondary cause is likewise considered an attested danger; if the primary cause is not regarded as an attested danger, neither are its derivatives. All primary and secondary causes are considered forewarned from the very outset, except the horn and its derivatives, which are counted as innocuous to begin with until they are proved to be an attested danger, as we have explained.</p>
<p>8. This is the rule: Compensation for damage caused is due indemnity; whenever one is required to pay more than this or less, such as double compensation for theft or half-damage for injury caused by a <italic>tam</italic>, both the excess and the lesser amount are regarded as a fine. Fines are payable only on the basis of witnesses; anyone who admits liability in the case of any fine is exempt from paying it.</p>
<p>19. If a man incites somebody&#x2019;s dog against another man, he is morally liable, though he is legally exempt. But the owner of the dog must pay half-damage, because he knew that his dog would bite if incited; he should not have let him loose.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Three</h1>
<p>1. An animal is deemed a <italic>mu&#x2018;ad</italic> (forewarned) as to eating fruit or vegetable products and the like. Accordingly, the defendant must pay full damage if his animal entered the premises of the plaintiff and ate things that it normally eats, as it is written: &#x201C;When it feeds in another man&#x2019;s field, he shall make restitution from the best of his own field&#x2026;&#x201D; (Exodus 22:4). If, however, it ate them in a public domain, he is exempt. If the animal benefited thereby, the owner must pay for the benefit it derived and not for the damage.</p>
<h1>Chapter Four</h1>
<p>1. If a man brought his flock into a fold and shut it in with a door that could withstand a normal wind, and it nevertheless came out and caused damage, he is exempt. If, however, the door could not withstand an ordinary wind, or if the walls of the sheep fold were flimsy, which means that he failed to shut in the flock properly, he is liable if it emerged and caused damage.&#x2014; &#x2014; But if there was a strong partition and it came down at night, or burglars broke it down, and the sheep got out and caused damage, he is exempt. If burglars brought the sheep out and it caused damage, they are liable.</p>
<p>2. If a man broke a fence enclosing someone&#x2019;s animal, and it got out and caused damage, he is liable if the fence had been strong and firm. If, however, it had been weak, he is legally exempt but morally liable. So too, if a man placed deadly poison in front of another man&#x2019;s animal, he is legally exempt and morally liable.</p>
<p>4. If a man entrusted his animal to an unpaid or a paid guardian, to a hirer or a borrower, the keeper takes the place of the owner and is held responsible for the damage the animal has caused. This is so only if they failed to guard it at all; but if they took excellent care of it, as it should be, they are quit of liability if it went out and caused damage, but the owner is liable, even if it killed a person [and the compensation exacted would be relatively high]. If they failed to take adequate care of it, an unpaid guardian is exempt, whereas a paid guardian, a hirer, or a borrower is held responsible.</p>
<h1>Chapter Five</h1>
<p>1. If a pasturing animal strayed into fields and vineyards, the owner should be warned three times even if it caused no damage as yet. If he took no care of his animal and failed to prevent it from pasturing there, the owner of the field has the right to slaughter the animal properly and then say to its owner: &#x201C;Come and sell your meat,&#x201D; since one is forbidden to do damage and pay for it; even to cause damage indirectly is forbidden.</p>
<p>2. For this reason, the sages prohibited the raising of small cattle or small wild animals in Eretz Yisrael in areas containing fields and vineyards, though they allowed this in the wooded and desert areas of Eretz Yisrael. In Syria, however, such animals may be raised anywhere.</p>
<p>9. The sages also prohibited the breeding of swine in any place, or of dogs, unless they are chained. One may, however, breed dogs in a town near the border. A dog should be tied up by day and untied at night. The sages said: &#x201C;Cursed be the man who breeds dogs or pigs,&#x201D; because the damage they do is substantial and frequent.</p>
<h1>Chapter Six</h1>
<p>1. What kind of animal is accounted an attested danger? One against which evidence of injury has been brought within three separate days. If, however, it gored or bit, or lay down or kicked or jostled, even a hundred times on a single day, it is not accounted an attested danger.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. Warning given of a mischievous animal should be conveyed only in the presence of the owner and before a court of three judges, as it is written: &#x201C;And its owner has been warned&#x201D; (Exodus 21:29), and any warning must be before a court of law.</p>
<p>6. If an ox against which evidence has been brought is sold or given away, it reverts to the status of harmlessness, because the change in ownership entails a change in the legal status of the animal. But if the owner has lent it to someone or entrusted it to a guardian, it retains the status of an attested danger.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>7. If an animal against which evidence has been brought discontinues the behavior of attested danger, it reverts to the status of harmlessness. If, for instance, evidence has been brought against a goring ox, and it stops goring, even though it jostles, it is deemed harmless with respect to goring. From what time is it assumed that the animal has turned harmless? If it does not gore when the children put their hands on it. So too, with respect to other actions concerning which evidence has been brought against an animal, it remains an attested danger unless it refrains from those actions when children put their hands on it.</p>
<p>8. If an ox is an attested danger to its own species, it is not an attested danger to another species. If evidence has been brought against it with respect to human beings, it is not deemed an attested danger to animals; if it is an attested danger to children, it is not an attested danger to adults. Hence, if it caused damage to a species to which it has been an attested danger, the owner must pay full compensation; he pays only half-damage, if the animal caused damage to other species.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Seven</h1>
<p>1. If the owner of an ox had tied it with a halter, or shut it in properly, but it nevertheless came out and caused damage, he must pay for half the damage if it was accounted harmless, but is exempt if it was accounted an attested danger, as it is written: &#x201C;If he has not kept it in&#x201D; (Exodus 21:29), meaning that if he did keep it under guard, he is exempt; and this ox was guarded indeed.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>8. An appraisal is made with regard to damages. If, for instance, a man or his animal broke someone&#x2019;s article, we must not say to the defendant: &#x201C;Take the broken article and pay its original value to the plaintiff.&#x201D; Instead, the amount of depreciation of the article is estimated, and the defendant must pay the entire amount of depreciation to the plaintiff if the animal that caused the damage was an attested danger, or half the amount of depreciation if it was accounted harmless, as it is written: &#x201C;He shall keep the dead animal to himself&#x201D; (Exodus 21:34), meaning: the plaintiff. The value depreciation of the carcass is borne by the plaintiff; the value improvement of the carcass is shared between the plaintiff and the defendant.</p>
<p>9. If, for instance, an ox worth two hundred was gored and died, and the carcass was worth one hundred at the time of death, but decreased in value by the time the case was tried, being worth only eighty, the defendant has to pay only one hundred if his animal was a <italic>mu&#x2018;ad;</italic> if it was a <italic>tam</italic>, he has to pay fifty from the price of the animal itself.</p>
<p>10. If the carcass grew in value and is worth one hundred twenty by the time the case is tried in court, the defendant has to pay ninety if his animal was a <italic>mu&#x2018;ad;</italic> if it was a <italic>tam</italic>, he has to pay forty-five from the animal itself. This is what the Torah means by saying: &#x201C;They shall divide the dead animal as well&#x201D; (Exodus 21:35).</p>
<h1>Chapter Ten</h1>
<p>1. An ox that killed a human being anywhere, whether an adult or a minor, a slave or a freeman, must be stoned, whether a <italic>tam</italic> or a <italic>mu&#x2018;ad</italic>.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. It does not matter whether an ox or any other animal, wild beast or bird, if it kills a human being it is to be stoned. What difference is there between a <italic>tam</italic> that killed a human being and a <italic>mu&#x2018;ad</italic> that killed a human being? The <italic>tam</italic> is exempt from ransom [paid to the heirs of the slain person], and [the owner of] the <italic>mu&#x2018;ad</italic> must pay ransom, provided that evidence has been brought against it as being prone to killing.</p>
<p>3. Since any domestic or wild animal or any bird is to be stoned if it killed a human being, how can any <italic>mu&#x2018;ad</italic> be found as to killing, so that the owner might have to pay ransom? For example, &#x2014; &#x2014; if the animal killed three Jewish persons who were afflicted with a fatal disease and then it killed one in good health; or if it killed and escaped and was caught after a fourth killing, for the owner is not required to pay ransom till the ox is stoned. So too, if the animal fatally injured three human beings in succession [and they did not die until it killed a fourth person], or if it killed three animals, it becomes a <italic>mu&#x2018;ad</italic> as to killing, and its owner must pay ransom.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>4. What is written in the Torah, &#x201C;and the owner shall also be put to death&#x201D; (Exodus 21:29), has been traditionally interpreted to mean death at the hands of Heaven (by an act of God); the owner obtains atonement upon payment of a ransom for the slain person. Even though the ransom is a form of atonement, the court may forcibly seize a pledge from anyone who has to pay ransom.</p>
<p>5. If an ox belonging to two partners has killed, each must pay the full ransom, for each must obtain complete atonement.</p>
<p>8. If a man incited a dog against another man and it killed him, the dog is not to be stoned. So too, if he incited a domestic or wild animal against another person and it killed him.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Eleven</h1>
<p>1. How much ransom is one required to pay? Whatever the judges consider to be the value of the slain individual. All depends on the value of the slain man, as it is written: &#x201C;He must redeem his life by giving whatever is imposed upon him&#x201D; (Exodus 21:30).&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. The ransom is paid to whom? To the heirs of the slain individual. If the animal killed a woman, the ransom goes to her heirs on her father&#x2019;s side and not to her husband.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Twelve</h1>
<p>1. If a man dug a pit in a public domain and an ox or a donkey fell into it and died, he must pay the full damage even if the pit was full of wool shearings and the like, as it is written: &#x201C;The owner of the pit shall make good the loss&#x201D; (Exodus 21:34). This applies to an ox or a donkey or any other domestic or wild animal or bird. Ox and donkey are mentioned in the Torah only because they are the usual cases.</p>
<p>22. If a man dug a pit in a public domain and an ox fell upon him and killed him, the owner of the ox is exempt. If the ox died too, the owner of the ox can collect for his ox from the heirs of the owner of the pit.</p>
<h1>Chapter Thirteen</h1>
<p>1. If utensils fell into a pit and were broken, the owner of the pit is exempt, as it is written: &#x201C;If an ox or a donkey fell into it&#x201D; (Exodus 21:33). This has been traditionally interpreted to mean: an ox, but not a human being; a donkey, but not utensils.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. The pit is one of the primary causes of injury, and its derivatives are like it, &#x2014; &#x2014; deemed forewarned from the very beginning. Anyone who interposes an obstacle is deemed a derivative of pit, and if a person or an animal has been injured by it, the one who interposed the obstacle must pay full indemnity.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>5. If a man left a jug in the public domain, and a pedestrian stumbled over it and broke it, he is exempt, because it is not usual for people to watch the road as they walk along. If the pedestrian was hurt, the owner of the jug must pay for the damage.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>22. The early men of piety used to hide their thorns and pieces of glass, burying them three handbreadths deep in the ground so that the plough might not stir them up again to the surface. Others used to burn them; still others used to cast them into the sea or river, so that none might be injured by them.</p>
<h1>Chapter Fourteen</h1>
<p>12. If a man set fire to a building belonging to another, he must pay for everything in it, since it is usual for people to place all their utensils and valuables in their homes.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>15. If a fire spread and harmed an individual, the one who started the fire is liable for damages, loss of time, healing expenses, pain, and humiliation of the injured party, just as if he had injured him with his own hand. Even though the fire is the man&#x2019;s chattel, it is as if it did the damage by means of his arrows. If, however, a man&#x2019;s animal or pit injured a person, the owner is liable only for the damage done, as we have explained.</p>
<p>16. All derivatives of fire bear the same legal liability as fire itself. If, for instance, a man placed a stone or a knife or a load on top of his roof, and one of these fell down because of an ordinary wind and caused damage, he must pay full indemnity, since all these are derivatives of fire. If any of these fell down on account of an unusual wind and caused damage, he is exempt.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>THEFT</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. Anyone who steals property worth a penny or more transgresses the prohibition: &#x201C;You shall not steal&#x201D; (Exodus 20:15). One does not incur the penalty of lashes by breaking this prohibition, since the atonement for stealing is obtained by payment of the principal and the fine; the Torah requires the thief to repay. It makes no difference whether one steals the property of a Jew or a non-Jew, or whether one steals from an adult or from a minor.</p>
<p>2. According to the law of the Torah, it is forbidden to steal the smallest amount. It is likewise forbidden to steal in jest, or to steal with the intention of returning the object or paying for it. All this is forbidden, lest one may become addicted to it.</p>
<p>3. Who is a thief? One who takes a person&#x2019;s property secretly without the owner&#x2019;s knowledge, as when he puts his hand into someone&#x2019;s pocket and takes money out without the awareness of the owner, and so on. If, however, one took something openly, publicly, forcibly, he is not deemed a thief but a robber. Hence, if an armed robber stole something, he is not considered a robber but a thief, even though the owner was aware of the action at the time the robber was stealing.</p>
<p>4. If eligible witnesses testified that an individual committed a theft, he must pay the owner of the stolen property twice its value. If he stole one denar, he must pay two; if he stole a donkey or a garment or a camel, he must pay twice its value. Thus he loses in proportion to what he intended to despoil another.</p>
<p>5. If a thief has confessed of his own accord that he has stolen, he has to repay the capital value and is exempt from paying a double amount, as it is written: &#x201C;He whom the judges condemn shall pay double&#x201D; (Exodus 22:8), implying that a man who condemns himself does not have to pay double. The same rule applies to all fines: if a person admits his guilt, he is exempt [from paying fines].</p>
<p>6. The fine of double payment applies to everything except a sheep or an ox. If one stole an ox or a sheep and slaughtered it or sold it, he has to pay fourfold for the sheep and fivefold for the ox.</p>
<p>7. There is no difference between man and woman who stole; they must each pay double, or fourfold, or fivefold. If the thief was a married woman without money of her own to pay, the double amount of the theft becomes a debt which the court collects from her when she is divorced or her husband dies.</p>
<p>8. If a minor committed theft, he is exempt from paying double, but the stolen object must be returned to the owner. If the minor lost it, he is not liable to repay even its capital value, not even after he has reached full age.</p>
<p>9. If a slave committed theft, both he and his master are exempt from paying double: a man is not liable for damage done by his slaves although they are his chattels, because they have minds of their own and he cannot keep watch over them. A slave angered by his master might go and set fire to a grain stack worth a thousand denars or do similar damage [in order to cause his master to pay a large fine]. Should the slave become free, he must make the double payment [for what he had stolen].</p>
<p>10. The court should impose physical punishment upon minors, in proportion to their strength, for committing theft, so that they should not become addicted to stealing. So too, if they occasion other damage. If slaves steal or do damage, they too should be severely punished in order that they should not grow accustomed to cause injury.</p>
<p>13. If a man stole a lean animal and it grew fat, or a fat animal and it got lean, he must pay double or fourfold or fivefold the value it had at the time of the theft. If a man stole a lamb and it grew into a ram, or a calf and it grew into an ox, he must pay double the value it had at the time of the theft. If he slaughtered or sold it after it had grown, he acquired title to it on account of the change which occurred while the animal was in his possession and it is his own property that he has slaughtered or sold; hence, he is exempt from the fourfold or fivefold fine.</p>
<p>18. If a man stole an animal and slaughtered it, and then another thief stole it from him, the second thief must pay him double, because he had acquired title by a change brought about by human action; the first thief must pay the original owner fourfold or fivefold.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Three</h1>
<p>7. If two men bear witness that an individual has stolen an animal, he must pay fourfold or fivefold if the same or others testify that he has slaughtered or sold it. If two men bear witness that an individual has stolen an animal, but only one witness testifies that he has slaughtered or sold it, or if he himself confesses that he has slaughtered or sold it, he has to pay double and not fourfold or fivefold, because one is exempt from a penalty that is based upon his own confession, as we have explained.</p>
<p>11. The law requires a thief to pay the capital amount and the penalties of double and of fourfold or fivefold from his movable property. If he has no movable property available, the court must attach his real property and collect everything from the best of his estate, as in the case of other damages concerning which it is written: &#x201C;The best of his field&#x201D; (Exodus 22:4). If he has neither land nor movable property, the court must sell the thief and give the money to the plaintiff, as it is written: &#x201C;If he has nothing, he must be sold to pay for what he has stolen&#x201D; (Exodus 22:2).</p>
<p>12. A man but not a woman may be sold for theft; this is known from traditional lore. A thief may be sold only to pay the capital value of the stolen object, but must not be sold for the penalties of double and of fourfold or fivefold, which remain a debt against him until he can afford to pay.</p>
<p>15. If a man committed theft and was sold and then committed theft again, he may be sold a second time if he stole from a different person; he may indeed be sold a hundred times if he stole from a hundred different people. But if he stole a second time from the first individual, he may not be sold again ; instead, everything is counted as a debt against him.</p>
<h1>Chapter Four</h1>
<p>1. If a man pleads that the thing entrusted to him has been stolen from his home, and takes an oath to that effect, and then witnesses come and testify that he pleads falsely and that the entrusted object is still in his possession, he must pay double, because he himself is the thief. If he slaughtered or sold an entrusted animal after taking the oath [denying theft], he must pay fourfold or fivefold.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. This rule applies if the keeper had taken an oath before he made illegitimate use of the entrusted object. But if he had made use of it and then pleaded that it was stolen, affirming this on oath, and witnesses appeared afterwards, he is exempt from paying double, because as soon as he made use of it he became answerable for it and acquired title to it.</p>
<p>4. If a man pleads that someone&#x2019;s lost article which he had found was stolen from him, affirming this on oath, and then witnesses testify that the lost article is in his possession and that he has pleaded falsely, he must pay double, as it is written: &#x201C;Concerning any lost thing&#x201D; (Exodus 22:8). This law applies only when he claims that it was stolen by an armed robber, in which case he should be exempt since he was a victim of compulsion. If, however, he pleads that it was stolen without compulsion, he is exempt from paying double, because his own plea condemns him to pay for it, since a guardian of found property is regarded as a paid guardian [who is liable in case of theft], as will be explained.</p>
<h1>Chapter Five</h1>
<p>1. It is forbidden to buy from a thief anything he has stolen; it is a grave sin, since one encourages criminals thereby, inducing a thief to commit other thefts. If he finds no customer, he will not steal. Relative to this it is written : &#x201C;The partner of a thief is his own enemy&#x201D; (Proverbs 29:24).</p>
<p>2. If a man stole an object and sold it, while the owner did not give up hope of regaining it, and thereupon the thief was discovered and witnesses testified : &#x201C;The article that this man sold he had stolen in our presence,&#x201D; then the object goes back to the owner who, for the good of the open market, must restore to the purchaser the price he paid the thief; and then the owner may bring the thief to trial. If, however, he was a notorious thief, the sages did not apply the rule of open market, and the owner does not have to pay the purchaser anything, but the purchaser may bring the thief to trial and exact from him the money he paid him.</p>
<p>3. If the owner gave up hope of recovering the stolen article, no matter whether he first gave up hope and then the thief sold it or he gave up hope after the thief had sold it, the purchaser has acquired title to it by the owner&#x2019;s abandonment of hope, and the change of possession, and does not have to restore the stolen article itself to the owner, but should give him only its value if he bought it from a notorious thief. If the seller was not a notorious thief, the buyer does not have to give the owner anything, because of the open-market rule.</p>
<p>4. If, during the trial between the purchaser and the owner, there are no witnesses to testify about the sum paid for the stolen article, the purchaser, holding a sacred object, states on oath the price he paid for it and then collects it from the owner. Anyone who receives payment after taking an oath does so on the authority of the sages; he swears with a sacred object held in his hand, as will be explained in the proper place.</p>
<p>5. When the purchaser calls the thief to trial, saying: &#x201C;I bought it for such-and-such a sum,&#x201D; while the thief says: &#x201C;I sold it to you for less,&#x201D; the purchaser must take an oath, with a sacred object held in his hand, and then he collects from the thief. The thief cannot take an oath, since he is suspected of swearing falsely.</p>
<h1>Chapter Seven</h1>
<p>1. If a man weighs out to his neighbor with weights that are deficient by the standards agreed upon by the residents of his state, or uses a measure deficient by the agreed standards, he breaks a prohibition, as it is written: &#x201C;You must never act dishonestly in judgment, in measures of length or weight or quantity&#x201D; (Leviticus 19:35).</p>
<p>2. Even though the man who measures or weighs deficiently is committing theft, he does not have to repay double but only the amount of deficiency in measure or weight. Lashing is not inflicted for breaking this prohibition, since he is required to pay.</p>
<p>8. It makes no difference whether a man deals with a fellow Jew or a heathen, if he has measured or weighed deficiently he has broken a prohibition and must repay. So too, it is forbidden to deceive a heathen in computing an account, but one should be carefully precise in dealing with him, as it is written: &#x201C;He must compute with his purchaser&#x201D; (Leviticus 25:50), even if he is subject to Jewish rule ; and so much the more a heathen who is not subject to Jewish rule. This is implied in the biblical statement: &#x201C;Anyone who does such things is abominable to the Lord your God&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 25:16)&#x2014;anyone who acts dishonestly in any manner.</p>
<p>11. If a man removed his neighbor&#x2019;s landmark and included some of his area into his own, even as much as a finger&#x2019;s length, he is deemed a robber if he did it forcibly, and a thief if he removed it secretly. If he removed a landmark in Eretz Yisrael, he has broken two prohibitions: robbery or theft, and: &#x201C;You shall not remove your neighbor&#x2019;s landmark&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 19:14). This last prohibition is applicable only in Eretz Yisrael, since it is written in the same verse: &#x201C;In the inheritance which you will hold in the land&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>ROBBERY AND LOST PROPERTY</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. Anyone who robs another of a penny&#x2019;s worth breaks a prohibition, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall not rob&#x201D; (Leviticus 19:13).</p>
<p>2. According to biblical law, it is forbidden to rob the smallest quantity. It is prohibited to rob or defraud even a heathen, an idolater. If a man did rob or defraud him, he must make restitution.</p>
<p>3. Who commits robbery? One who takes a man&#x2019;s property by force, as when he snatches an object from his hand or enters his premises without permission and takes utensils, or seizes his servant and animal and makes use of them, or enters his field and eats its products, or commits anything of the sort; he is deemed a robber, in the sense that it is written: &#x201C;He snatched the spear out of the Egyptian&#x2019;s hand&#x201D; (II Samuel 23:21).</p>
<p>4. Who commits fraud? One who has come into possession of another person&#x2019;s money with the consent of the owner and detains it by force, and does not return it when the owner demands it. Such is the case if one has a loan or wages due him, and he claims it from the debtor but cannot obtain it from him because he is a violent and difficult man. Relative to this it is written: &#x201C;You shall not defraud your fellow man&#x201D; (Leviticus 19:13).</p>
<p>5. Anyone who commits robbery must return the very object he robbed, as it is written: &#x201C;He shall restore what he took by robbery&#x201D; (Leviticus 5:23). If, however, the object is lost or altered, he must pay its value. Whether he has confessed of his own accord, or witnesses have testified that he committed robbery, he is required to repay the capital value only. Even if he took a rafter by robbery and built it into a structure, inasmuch as it underwent no change, biblical law requires that he shall pull down the whole building and give back the rafter to its owner. The sages, however, have ruled for the benefit of repentant sinners, that he may repay its value and does not have to demolish the structure. The same is applicable to all similar cases. Even if one took a rafter by robbery and used it for the <italic>sukkah</italic>, and the owner came to claim it during the <italic>Sukkoth</italic> festival, he has to repay only its value. But if it is claimed after the festival, he must return the rafter itself, inasmuch as it has not been altered and he has not built it in with mortar.</p>
<p>9. Anyone who covets the male or female servant or the house or goods of his neighbor, or anything that he can buy from him, and he exerts friendly pressure and annoys him until he buys it from him, even for a high price, breaks the prohibition: &#x201C;You shall not covet&#x201D; (Exodus 20:17).&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Three</h1>
<p>15. If one borrows an article without the owner&#x2019;s knowledge, he is deemed a robber. If the owner&#x2019;s son or servant held in his hand an instrument, and a man took it from him and used it, he is like one who borrows an article without its owner&#x2019;s consent, and it is deemed to be in his care so that he is responsible for any accident befalling it until he returns it to the owner. Accordingly, if he has returned it to the minor in whose hand it was, or to the servant, and it has been lost or broken, he must pay for it. So too, in all similar cases.</p>
<p>16. If one seizes a pledge from a debtor&#x2019;s hand without the permission of a court, he is deemed a robber, even though the other owes him money. It is needless to say that if one enters another&#x2019;s home and seizes a pledge, he is deemed a robber, as it is written: &#x201C;You must stand outside&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 24:11).</p>
<h1>Chapter Seven</h1>
<p>1. Anyone who owes money to his fellow Jew and denies it, and swears falsely, must repay the capital value which he has denied, plus the added fifth part [of the amount as a penalty]. He must also bring an offering, known as the guilt-offering for robbery.</p>
<p>2. The same law applies to one who robs, defrauds, steals, or denies that someone lent him or deposited with him, or that he is in possession of a lost object, or that he detains some of the joint property of a partnership, or fails to pay the amount due for work that has been done for him. In sum: Anyone who would be legally obligated to pay if he confessed must repay the capital amount, plus a fifth part [twenty percent of the amount] if he denies on oath, as it is written: &#x201C;If he deceives his neighbor in a matter of deposit&#x2026;&#x201D; (Leviticus 5:21).</p>
<p>8. If one takes an oath, denying money that is due, he does not have to pay the fifth part unless he confesses of his own accord. But if witnesses came and he persists in denying, he has to pay only the capital value, on the testimony of the witnesses; he does not have to pay the fifth part, since the fifth part and the offering are intended as an atonement, and he is to provide them only upon self-confession.</p>
<p>10. Even if one has restored all that he robbed with the exception of a penny&#x2019;s worth, he is obligated to take it to the person robbed. He should give it neither to the son of the man robbed nor to his agent, unless the robbed man made him his agent in the presence of witnesses. If a man brings what he has robbed, plus the fifth part, to the law court of his town, he may offer the guilt-offering, and he obtains atonement; the court takes care of it until it reaches its owner. So too, he may give it to an agent of the court. Anyone who gives what he has robbed, and the like, to the law court has discharged his duty.</p>
<h1>Chapter Eight</h1>
<p>14. No fifth part is added in the case of slaves, bonds, or landed property, as it is written: &#x201C;If he deceives his neighbor in a matter of deposit&#x2026;&#x201D; (Leviticus 5:21). Everything spoken of in this context is movable property with an intrinsic value. Excluded are landed property and slaves, who are placed on an equality with landed property; bonds are excluded, since they have no intrinsic value.&#x2014; &#x2014; Title to land can never be acquired by a robber; it always remains in the legal possession of its owner. If the land has been sold to a thousand people, one after another, and the owner has given up hope of recovery, it must go back to the robbed one without payment. The person parting with it has a claim against the one who sold it to him, who in turn has a claim against the previous seller, and so on until the one who bought it from the robber makes claim and exacts payment from the robber.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Ten</h1>
<p>1. If a violent heathen took Jewish property by force, entering a field because its owner owed him a debt, &#x2014; &#x2014; and after seizing the field he sold it to another Jew, the owner cannot recover it from the buyer.</p>
<p>3. When heathen oppress a Jew and seek to slay him, until he gives up his field or his house to save himself, &#x2014; &#x2014; if the oppressor is willing to sell the land, and the original owner can afford to buy it back, he has precedence over anyone else. But if the owner cannot afford to buy it, or if the oppressor kept the land for twelve months, anyone who has bought it first from the oppressor has gained title to it, provided that he gives the original owner a quarter of the land or a third of the price he has paid, since the oppressor sells cheaply. Because he sells land that is not his, he sells it for some twenty-five percent less, and this quarter belongs to the original owner; it is sold cheaply because it is his. Accordingly, anyone who buys from the oppressor for thirty must give the owner ten, or a quarter of the land, and then he acquires title to all the rest. If, however, he has not given, then one-fourth of the land in his possession has the status of robbed property.</p>
<h1>Chapter Eleven</h1>
<p>1. The restoration of lost property to a Jew is a positive command, as it is written : &#x201C;You shall surely take them back to your brother&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 22:1). Anyone who sees the lost property of a Jew and ignores it, and leaves it there, breaks a prohibitive command as well as a positive command, as it is written: &#x201C;You must not withhold your help from any ox or sheep of your brother which you see gone astray&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 22:1). If he has restored it to the owner he has carried out a positive command.</p>
<p>17. Anyone who follows the good and upright path, and does more than the strict requirement of the law, should restore lost property under all circumstances, even if the act detracts from his dignity.</p>
<p>19. If one noticed lost property and his father told him &#x201C;do not restore it,&#x201D; he must return it and should not obey him. For, if he obeyed his father, in fulfillment of the positive command <italic>honor your father</italic>, he would thereby nullify the positive command <italic>you shall surely take them back</italic>, and transgress <italic>you must not withhold your help</italic>.</p>
<p>20. If one sees flooding water threatening to destroy the building or field of somebody else, he must restrain and prevent it, as it is written: &#x201C;So you shall do with any lost thing of your brother&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 22:3), including loss of his landed property.</p>
<h1>Chapter Thirteen</h1>
<p>1. If one finds lost property which he must restore, he is obligated to advertise and let it be known and say: &#x201C;Whoever has lost a certain kind of object, let him come to identify it and receive it.&#x201D; He must announce it even if it was worth a penny at the time it was found and has since been reduced in value. There was a high rock outside Jerusalem where lost and found things were announced.</p>
<p>2. How should one make the announcement? If one has found money, he should announce: &#x201C;Let anyone who has lost a coin come and identify it and get it.&#x201D; So too, one should announce: &#x201C;Let anyone who has lost a garment, an animal, or documents, come and present identification marks and take them.&#x201D; He need not worry about making known the kind of lost property, because he is not supposed to return it unless he is given decisive marks of identification.</p>
<p>4. In olden times, anyone who lost property and came and presented its identification marks, it was restored to him, unless he was known to be a swindler. But when the deceivers became plentiful, the court instituted that the claimant should be told: &#x201C;Bring witnesses that you are not a fraud and take it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>5. We may rely and base a legal decision upon definite marks of identification under all circumstances, according to biblical law. Size, weight, number, or the place where the object was lost are considered sure marks of identification.</p>
<p>6. If two individuals came and each gave the same marks of identification, the finder should not give it to either of them, but it must be left intact until one admits to the other or until they make a settlement. If one of them presented identification marks and the other brought witnesses, he must give it to the one with witnesses. If one presented identification marks and the other presented identification marks and one witness, the witness is considered nonexistent, and the finder leaves it undisposed.</p>
<p>9. After the destruction of the Temple, the sages ruled that lost and found articles should be announced in synagogues and schools. But when oppressors increased and declared that anything found belonged to the king, the sages ruled that it was enough if the finder let it be known among his neighbors and acquaintances.</p>
<p>10. If the finder made it known that he had found something and the owner did not appear, he must keep it with him until Elijah shall come. As long as the lost article is in his possession, the finder is held responsible if it gets stolen or lost. If it meets with an accident, however, he is exempt. The guardian of lost property is considered a paid guardian, because he is released from many positive commands as long as he is fulfilling the precept of taking care of it.</p>
<p>11. The finder must examine and inspect the lost article so that it does not deteriorate of itself, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall give it back to him&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 22:2); that is, be careful how you restore it to him.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>12. If one has found wooden utensils, he should use them to prevent them from rotting. &#x2014; &#x2014; Silverware should be used with cold water but not with hot, because he might tarnish them.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>13. If one has found scrolls he should read them once every thirty days; and if he cannot read, he should at least unroll them every thirty days. But he must never learn anything from them for the first time, nor read any section and repeat it, nor read a section and translate it, nor open them at more than three columns. Nor should two persons read on two different subjects, lest they pull each in a different direction and the scroll becomes worn ; but two may read on one subject. Three persons may not read in a scroll, even on the same subject.</p>
<h1>Chapter Fourteen</h1>
<p>2. This is the general rule concerning lost property: If anything without a mark of identification was lost and the owner was aware of its loss, it is assumed that the owner has given up hope of recovering it &#x2014; &#x2014; and it therefore belongs to the finder.</p>
<p>3. Anything that has an identification mark, such as a garment or an animal, it is taken for granted that the owner has not given up hope of recovering it &#x2014; &#x2014; and therefore the finder must announce it, unless he knows that the owner has abandoned hope of its recovery. If, for instance, he heard the owner say: &#x201C;Alas, what a loss of money,&#x201D; or if the owner used a similar expression, showing that he has given it up, the lost article belongs to the finder.</p>
<p>5. Unconscious resignation, even when the lost object has no mark of identification, is not considered abandonment of hope of recovery. If, for instance, one dropped a denar without being aware that he dropped it, although he is likely to abandon hope of its recovery upon noticing that he dropped it, it is not deemed abandonment of hope as yet, until the owner is aware that it fell out [and disappeared]. If, however, the owner still says: &#x201C;I may have given it to so-and-so,&#x201D; or &#x201C;it is lying in the chest,&#x201D; or &#x201C;I may have made a mistake in figuring,&#x201D; or something like this, it is not regarded as abandonment of hope.</p>
<p>12. If one finds earthen jars and pottery that are identical in form, they belong to him if they are new, since they are like any one of the denars without a mark of identification, which the owner cannot recognize; he cannot know whether this jar or flask belongs to him or to somebody else. If, however, they are old utensils which the owner has seen long enough to recognize them by sight, he must announce them. If a scholar comes and declares: &#x201C;Even though I cannot identify this jar, I can recognize it by sight,&#x201D; he must show it to him. If he recognizes it and says: &#x201C;It is mine,&#x201D; it must be returned.</p>
<p>13. This applies only to a distinguished scholar who never deviates from the truth except in promoting peace, &#x2014; &#x2014; who has promoted peace between fellow men by adding or omitting facts in order to make them friendly to one another; such misrepresentation is permissible. But if witnesses appeared and testified that he misrepresented in other matters, lost property should not be returned to him merely by virtue of recognition by sight.</p>
<h1>Chapter Sixteen</h1>
<p>7. If one has found treasures in a heap of stones or in an old wall, they are his, since we should assume that they belonged to the ancient heathen. This is so, provided that he finds them deep down, like all ancient treasures. But if it looks likely that they are recently-concealed treasures, or even if he has doubts about it, he must not touch them, for they may have been placed there.</p>
<h1>Chapter Seventeen</h1>
<p>1. Wherever we have said that a found article belongs to the finder, he does not gain possession of it until it reaches his hand or his premises. But if a man noticed lost property, and even fell upon it, and another came and seized it, he that seized it has acquired title to it.</p>
<p>2. If, riding an animal, a man saw lost property and said to his friend: &#x201C;Acquire title to it for me,&#x201D; as soon as the other picked it up for him, the rider acquired title to it even before it reached his hand. But if the rider said to his friend: &#x201C;Give it to me,&#x201D; and the latter took it and said: &#x201C;I have acquired title to it,&#x201D; he has acquired title to it indeed by taking it. If, however, after having given it to the rider he said: &#x201C;I acquired title to it first,&#x201D; he said nothing at all [to his advantage; his claim is invalid].</p>
<p>8. A man&#x2019;s courtyard can acquire property for him without his knowledge, and if a lost object fell in there, it belongs to the owner of the courtyard.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Eighteen</h1>
<p>9. If one has found a deed of gift, [the law is this]: If the donor made the gift while in good health, the finder should return it neither to the donor nor to the donee, even if both admit that the deed is valid. For the donor may possibly have written the deed for the purpose of presenting the gift to the named donee but failed to do so and, instead, sold the field or gave it to another person but has now retracted. The reason he admits having made the gift to this one is that he plans to defraud the last party to whom he gave or sold the field. If, however, the gift was made when the donor was on the verge of death, [the law is this]: If he admits that it is valid, the finder should return it to the donee ; if not, he should not return it, because if a person on the verge of death has given property to two people, one after the other, the second one gains title to it, as will be explained.</p>
<p>14. All lost documents that legally are not to be returned are valid if the finder has returned them, and they are enforceable and must not be taken away from their possessor. They are presumed to be valid and are not subject to suspicion.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>ASSAULT AND BATTERY</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. If a man wounded a fellow man, he must pay him compensation on five counts, namely: injury, pain, medical treatment, forced idleness, and humiliation. These things are paid out of the defendant&#x2019;s best property, in keeping with the law concerning all injurers.</p>
<p>2. How is compensation for injury determined? If one cut off a man&#x2019;s hand or foot, the court determines, as if he were a slave to be sold on the market, how much he was worth previously and how much he is worth now. The defendant must then pay the amount by which he decreased the value of the injured man, as it is written: &#x201C;An eye for an eye&#x201D; (Exodus 21:24); traditionally interpreted it means remuneration for injury sustained.</p>
<p>3. When the Torah says: &#x201C;If a man disfigures a person, as he has done so shall it be done to him&#x201D; (Leviticus 24:20), it does not mean to inflict injury on this man as he did on the other, but that the offender fittingly deserves to be deprived of a limb or wounded in the same manner as he did, and must therefore indemnify the damage he caused. Furthermore, the Torah says: &#x201C;You shall accept no ransom for the life of a murderer&#x201D; (Numbers 35:31), implying that only for a murderer no ransom is accepted, but compensation is taken for the loss of limbs or for injuries sustained.</p>
<p>4. So too, when it is written concerning one who wounds another and causes him injury: &#x201C;You must have no pity on him&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 19:13), the meaning is that no pity is to be had when exacting compensation. Lest you say: &#x201C;He is a poor man, and he injured the other without intention, I must have mercy on him,&#x201D; it is written: &#x201C;You must have no pity on him.&#x201D;</p>
<p>5. How do we know that what is written concerning the loss of limbs, &#x201C;an eye for an eye,&#x201D; means compensation? In the same context it is written: &#x201C;A wound for a wound&#x201D; (Exodus 21:25), and it is also written explicitly: &#x201C;If one strikes the other with a stone or with his fist &#x2026; he must pay for the man&#x2019;s loss of time and also see that he is thoroughly restored to health&#x201D; (Exodus 21:18-19). Hence, you may infer that the word <italic>for</italic> (<italic>ta&#x1E25;ath</italic>), used in <italic>wound for wound</italic>, signifies compensation. The same applies to [the word] <italic>for</italic> used in connection with the eye and the other organs.</p>
<p>7. How do we know that if one injures another, he has to compensate for the pain separately? It is written concerning a man guilty of rape: &#x201C;Because he violated her&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 22:29). The same applies to anyone who inflicts physical suffering on another: he must compensate for the pain sustained.</p>
<p>8. How do we know that he must compensate for the loss of time and pay for the medical treatment separately? It is written: &#x201C;He must pay for the man&#x2019;s loss of time and also see that he is thoroughly restored to health&#x201D; (Exodus 21:19).</p>
<p>9. How do we know that he has to compensate for the humiliation separately? It is written: &#x201C;If she put out her hand and seized him by the private parts, you shall cut off her hand&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 25:11-12). Anyone who humiliates a person is included in this law.</p>
<p>10. The man who humiliated someone does not have to compensate for the humiliation unless he acted intentionally, as it is written: &#x201C;If she put out her hand.&#x201D; If, however, he humiliated another unintentionally, he is exempt. Accordingly, if one caused humiliation while asleep, or the like, he is exempt.</p>
<p>11. A human being is always regarded as a <italic>mu&#x2019;ad</italic> (forewarned), whether he acts unwittingly or deliberately, whether he is awake or asleep or intoxicated; and if he has injured another or caused damage to his property, he must pay compensation out of the best of his own property. The law that a man who does injury while asleep must pay compensation applies only in a case where two men lay down to sleep at the same time and one turned over in his sleep and injured the other or tore his clothing. If, however, one was asleep and another came and lay down beside him, the one who came last is the <italic>mu&#x2019;ad</italic>, and if the sleeping one injured him, he is exempt. So too, if one placed a utensil alongside a sleeping individual and the latter broke it, he is exempt. The reason is that the person who put it there was the <italic>mu&#x2019;ad</italic> and at fault.</p>
<p>16. If a man intentionally injured another, he is liable on five counts under all circumstances. Even if an individual entered one&#x2019;s premises without permission and the owner injured him, he is held liable, because he has a right to expel him but he has no right to injure him.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>17. If a man chopped wood in a public domain and a piece of wood flew off and caused injury in a private domain, or if one chopped in a private domain and caused injury in a public domain, or if one chopped in a private domain and caused injury in another private domain, or if one entered a carpenter&#x2019;s shop, with or without permission, and a chip of wood flew off and struck his face, in each of these cases the injurer is liable on four counts but is exempt from compensation for humiliation.</p>
<p>18. Just as we appraise the likely cause of death [in cases of fatal outcome], so must such an appraisal be made in cases of injury. If, for instance, a man struck another with a small pebble not large enough to cause injury, or with a small chip of wood, and it inflicted a wound that an object of this kind was unlikely to inflict, he is exempt, as it is written: &#x201C;With stone or with fist&#x201D; (Exodus 21: 18) ; that is, an object capable of causing injury. Yet, he is liable only for the humiliation sustained. Even if one spat on the person of another, he is held liable for humiliation. The witnesses must therefore know with what the defendant inflicted the injury; and the object with which he inflicted the injury must be brought to court to appraise it and to come to a judicial decision on the basis of it. If the object is lost and the offender says: &#x201C;It was not capable of inflicting an injury and it is as if I had been a victim of an unavoidable accident,&#x201D; while the injured party says: &#x201C;It was capable of inflicting an injury,&#x201D; the injured one may take an oath and collect damages, as will be explained.</p>
<p>19. No appraisal is to be made in the case of iron: even a small needle can kill, let alone injure a person.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Two</h1>
<p>1. If a man inflicted on another a wound for which he should pay on all five counts, he must compensate for the five. If he injured another on four counts, he must compensate for the four; if on three counts, he must pay for three ; if on two counts, he must pay for two ; if on one count, he must pay for one.</p>
<p>2. If, for instance, a man cut off another&#x2019;s hand, foot, finger, or toe, or blinded his eye, he must pay on five counts: injury, pain, medical treatment, loss of time, and humiliation. If he struck him on the hand so that it swelled but will eventually recover, or on his eye so that it became inflamed but will eventually heal, he must pay on four counts: pain, medical treatment, loss of time, and humiliation. If he struck him on the head and it swelled, he must pay on three counts: pain, medical treatment, and humiliation. If he struck him on a spot that is not visible &#x2014; &#x2014; if, for example, he struck him on his knees or his back, he must pay on two counts : pain and medical treatment. If he struck him with his handkerchief or with a document, and the like, he should pay only on one count, namely : humiliation.</p>
<p>5. Hence, you may infer that anyone who deprives another of an organ that will not regenerate is held liable on all five counts.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>6. Even if he deprived him of a tiny piece of skin, he is held liable on five counts, because the skin does not grow back but is marred by a scar. Accordingly, if a man injured another and tore the skin and made him bleed, he is held liable on five counts.</p>
<p>7. If a man frightened another, he is exempt from legal but not moral responsibility, even if the other became ill from fright, provided that he did not touch him; for instance, he shouted behind him or suddenly confronted him in the dark. So too, if a man shouted into somebody&#x2019;s ear and deafened him, he is exempt by the laws of man and held liable by the laws of Heaven.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>8. It seems to me, that if the injured person says: &#x201C;I am deafened and I can not hear,&#x201D; or: &#x201C;My eye is blinded and I cannot see,&#x201D; he is not believed ; since we do not know the matter; he may be acting with cunning [playing blind or deaf]. Hence, he should not collect damages unless he has been examined in ample time, and it is confirmed that he has lost his eyesight or has become deafened. Only then should the defendant pay compensation.</p>
<p>9. How much is compensation for pain? It all depends on the injured party. One individual may be most tender and delicate and wealthy, that even for a large amount of money he would not submit to a little pain. Another individual may be hard-working, robust and poor, and would undergo severe pain for a single <italic>zuz.</italic> According to these considerations we appraise and determine the indemnity for pain.</p>
<p>10. How should pain be assessed in a case where a man deprived another of an organ? For example, if he cut off another&#x2019;s hand or finger, we estimate how much such a person would pay for the difference between having his limb removed by means of a drug and having it cut off by means of a sword&#x2014;if the king decreed to have his hand or foot cut off. When the difference has been estimated, the offender has to pay it.</p>
<p>11. How should loss of time be assessed? If the offender did not deprive the injured person of a limb but the latter became ill and bedridden, or his hand became swollen but will eventually return to health, he must pay him for his daily loss of time at the rate an unemployed workman of the same occupation would lose by being unemployed.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>12. If a man boxed another&#x2019;s ear, or seized him and blew into his ear, and deafened him, he must pay him all that he was worth, since he is no longer fit for any work at all.</p>
<p>18. If the offender said to the injured person: &#x201C;I will cure you myself,&#x201D; or: &#x201C;I have a physician who will treat you free of charge,&#x201D; we should not pay attention to him ; but he must bring a competent physician to treat him for a fee.</p>
<p>19. &#x2014; &#x2014; If the patient disobeyed the physician and his illness got worse, the man who injured him is not obligated to provide him with further medical treatment.</p>
<p>20. When the court has determined the amount of damages to be paid by the defendant, it must collect all of it from him immediately, without designating a time limit whatsoever for his payment. If, however, he is required to pay compensation for humiliation only, he is given time to pay, since he did not cause the other a loss of money.</p>
<h1>Chapter Three</h1>
<p>1. How should humiliation be assessed? It all depends on the social positions of the insulting individual and the person insulted. An insult received from a person of light esteem cannot be compared with an insult received from a person of considerable prestige. The humiliation caused by a lesser individual is more painful.</p>
<p>5. If a man insulted another verbally or spat on his clothes, he is exempt from paying compensation ; but the court should prevent this, everywhere and at all times, as they see fit. If one insulted a scholar, he must pay him full compensation, even though he only humiliated him verbally.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>6. Such cases occurred frequently in Spain, where we lived. Some scholars used to condone this, as it was proper to do. Others would sue for redress, and then a settlement would be reached between the parties. The judges, on the other hand, would tell the offender: &#x201C;You ought to give him a pound of gold.&#x201D;</p>
<p>7. Although the person who verbally insults people is exempt from paying compensation, it is a grave sin. Only an evil fool reviles and abuses people. The ancient sages declared: &#x201C;Anyone who puts a worthy Jew to shame in public has no share in the world to come.&#x201D;</p>
<h1>Chapter Four</h1>
<p>20. It is harmful to clash with a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor: if a man injures one of these, he is held liable; if they injure other people, they are exempt. Even after a deaf-mute has been cured of his defect, or an imbecile has become normal, or a minor has grown up, he is not held liable for payment, because none of these was sensible when he inflicted the injury.</p>
<h1>Chapter Five</h1>
<p>1. A man is forbidden to injure himself or another. Not only one who inflicts a wound, but anyone who strikes a worthy Jew, whether an adult or a minor, whether a man or a woman, breaks a prohibitive law, as it is written: &#x201C;He must not lash him excessively&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 25:3). If the Torah has warned against excess in lashing an offender, how much more should this apply to striking an innocent man.</p>
<p>2. It is forbidden even to raise a hand against another; if anyone does raise a hand against another, even though he has not struck him, he is wicked.</p>
<p>9. A man who inflicts physical injury upon another is unlike one who damages another&#x2019;s property. If one damaged another&#x2019;s property, as soon as he has paid what he is required to pay he obtains atonement. If, on the other hand, he wounded another person, even though he has paid compensation on five counts he does not obtain atonement, even if he has offered up all the rams of Nevaioth, unless he asks forgiveness of the injured person who should pardon him.</p>
<p>10. The injured person is forbidden to be cruel by not forgiving; this is not the Jewish way. But as soon as the offender has asked forgiveness a first time and a second time, and he knows that he has turned from his sin and is sorry about his evil, he should pardon him. Anyone who hastens to forgive deserves praise and meets with the approval of the sages.</p>
<h1>Chapter Six</h1>
<p>1. If a man damaged the property of another person, he has to pay full compensation; whether he acted unwittingly or accidentally, he is regarded as if he acted willfully.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>3. This applies only [to damage done] on the premises of the injured party; on the premises of the defendant, however, he must pay only if he caused the damage willfully ; but if he acted unwittingly or accidentally, he is exempt.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>8. If two men were walking on a public domain, one carrying a jar and the other a beam, and the jar of the one was broken by the beam of the other, the latter is exempt, because each alike has the right of passage.</p>
<p>9. If two were proceeding on a public domain, one walking and the other running, and one was injured by the other unintentionally, the one running is held liable, because he behaved unusually [by running instead of walking].&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Eight</h1>
<p>1. If an informer turned another&#x2019;s property into the hands of an oppressor, he must pay compensation out of his best property.&#x2014; &#x2014; Whether the oppressor was Jewish or not, the informer must make good whatever the oppressor took away.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. This rule applies only when the informer pointed out the property of his own accord. If, however, he was compelled by a non-Jewish or a Jewish oppressor to do so, he is exempt from paying compensation.&#x2014; &#x2014; One who saves himself at the expense of another&#x2019;s property must pay for it.</p>
<p>4. If one took another&#x2019;s money and gave it to an oppressor, he must repay under all circumstances, even if the king compelled him to deliver it.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>9. It is forbidden to turn a Jew over into the hands of a heathen, whether physically or financially, even if he happens to be wicked and sinful, and even if he is the cause of one&#x2019;s distress and pain. Anyone who hands a Jew over into the hands of heathen, whether physically or financially, has no share in the world to come.</p>
<p>10. An informer may be slain anywhere, even at the present time when Jewish courts do not try capital cases. It is permissible to slay him before he has informed. As soon as he says that he is about to inform against an individual or his property, even a small amount of money, he has surrendered himself to death [as an outlaw]. He must be warned and told: &#x201C;Do not inform.&#x201D; If he has acted impudently, replying: &#x201C;Not so, I will inform against him,&#x201D; it is a religious duty to slay him ; whoever hastens to kill him attains merit.</p>
<p>11. If the informer has executed what he planned, and reported, it seems to me that it is forbidden to kill him, unless he is a confirmed informer, in which case he should be killed lest he continue to inform against others. There are frequent cases in the cities of Northern Africa where informers, who are known to report Jewish funds to oppressors, are killed or handed over to the non-Jewish authorities to be executed, beaten, or imprisoned, in accordance with their wickedness.&#x2014; &#x2014; It is forbidden to destroy the property of an informer, even though it is permissible to destroy him physically, since his property belongs to his heirs.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>HOMICIDE AND LIFE PRESERVATION</title>
<h1>Chapter Two</h1>
<p>1. If anyone killed another with his own hand, as when he struck him down with a sword or a deadly rock, strangled him to death or burned him alive, he must be executed by the court, because at any rate he murdered a man by himself.</p>
<p>2. On the other hand, if a man hired a murderer to kill somebody, or sent servants to kill him, or tied him up and put him in front of a lion or similar beast and it killed him, and also if an individual attempted suicide, each of these is guilty of shedding blood and bears the crime of murder; he deserves to die by an act of God, but is not executed by the court.</p>
<p>3. How do we know that to be the law? It is written : &#x201C;Whoever sheds human blood, by human hands shall his own blood be shed&#x201D; (Genesis 9:6). This refers to one who commits murder himself and not through an agent. &#x201C;I will require your lifeblood&#x201D; (9:5) refers to suicide. &#x201C;I will require it of any beast&#x201D; refers to one who puts a man in front of a beast to devour him. &#x201C;Of man I will require a reckoning for human life, of every man for that of his fellow man&#x201D; (9:5) refers to one who hires others to kill his fellow man. The verb <italic>require</italic> is explicitly iterated in the three cases to show that the verdict is left with God.</p>
<p>4. Any of these and similar murderers, who are not sentenced to death by a court, might be put to death by a royal decree if a Jewish king desires this for the benefit of society.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>5. If the king did not have them executed, if circumstances did not demand such a measure, the court must at any rate have them lashed to the point of death, and harshly imprisoned for many years, punishing them severely in order to terrify and frighten other criminals, so that this may not turn into a pitfall and a snare for others as to say: &#x201C;I will arrange to kill my enemy indirectly as did so-and-so, and I will be acquitted.&#x201D;</p>
<p>6. Whether a man killed an adult or an infant of one day, male or female, he must be executed if he committed deliberate murder, or exiled if he killed unwittingly.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>7. Whether a man killed a healthy individual or a sick man on the verge of death, or even a dying person, he must be executed.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>10. Whether a man killed a Jew or a Canaanite slave, he must be executed on his account; if he killed him unwittingly, he must go into exile.</p>
<p>12. The difference between one&#x2019;s own slave and the slave of others is that he has the right to strike his own slave. Accordingly, if he struck him hard enough to kill, and he was on the verge of death for twenty-four hours and then died, he should not be put to death on account of his slave, even though he died as a result of the blow, for it is written: &#x201C;If the slave survives a day or two, he shall not be punished, for the slave is his property&#x201D; (Exodus 21:21). The phrase <italic>day or two</italic> means a day that is like two, namely: twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>13. But if a man struck a slave not his own, even if the slave died on account of the blow several days afterwards, the man is put to death, as in the case of any freeman, because he struck him hard enough to kill.</p>
<p>14. It seems to me, that if a man struck his slave with a knife or a sword, with a stone or a fist, and the like, and the slave was considered to be fatally wounded and then he died, the law concerning &#x201C;a day or two&#x201D; is not applicable to him ; even if the slave died after a year, his master should be put to death on account of him. For this reason it is written : &#x201C;If a man strikes his slave &#x2026; with a rod&#x201D; (Exodus 21:20), because the Torah has permitted him to strike his slave merely with a rod or a stick or a strap, and the like, but not a murderous blow.</p>
<h1>Chapter Three</h1>
<p>1. If a man willfully struck a person with a stone or a piece of wood and killed him, we should appraise the object with which he knocked him down and the place on which he dealt the blow, to determine whether that object was or was not capable of killing by striking that vital organ.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>4. The Torah has stated no minimal size for an instrument of iron, as it is written: &#x201C;If he struck the person with an iron tool, so that he died, the man is a murderer&#x201D; (Numbers 35:16), even if he used a needle.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>5. If a man knocked a person down and killed him without a tool, if he struck him with his hand or foot, or bumped his head against him and killed him, we should appraise the strength of the assailant as well as the strength of the slain man, and the place of the blow. There is no comparison between pushing a person with a finger and kicking him with full might, between striking him in the heart and hitting him on the hip, between a weak person striking a robust and strong individual and a strong and healthy man striking a weak and sickly person.</p>
<p>9. If a man pushed a person into water or fire, the case should be evaluated : If the victim could have escaped, the offender is exempt from the death-penalty by the court; otherwise, he is held liable.&#x2014; &#x2014; The same applies to a man who put his hand over a person&#x2019;s mouth and nose and left him in convulsions and unable to live, or a man who tied another up and placed him in the cold or in the heat, so that he died, &#x2014; &#x2014; or one who put another into a cave or a house and filled it with smoke, so that he died.&#x2014; &#x2014; In each of these cases the culprit must be executed on account of the victim, since he is regarded as if he suffocated him with his own hand.</p>
<h1>Chapter Four</h1>
<p>1. If a man intended to kill A and killed B, he is exempt from a death-penalty imposed by the court, from payment of compensation, and from banishment. &#x2014; &#x2014; Accordingly, if a man threw a stone into a group of Jews and killed one of them, he is exempt from a death-penalty imposed by the court.</p>
<p>3. If a man struck a person with a stone or fist, or the like, an appraisal should be made. If it is considered likely that he will live, the offender pays compensation on five counts and is released. Even if the victim fell ill, took a turn for the worse and died from the blow, the offender is exempt. If, however, he is considered likely to die, the assailant must immediately be put into prison, while we wait for further developments. If the victim dies, the assailant is executed; but if he has improved and recovered completely, being able to walk along in the street like any other healthy individual, the assailant pays compensation on five counts and is released.</p>
<p>4. When the Torah says &#x201C;upon his staff,&#x201D; it does not mean that he can walk leaning on his staff or on another person ; even a dying man is able to walk leaning on a staff. The phrase <italic>upon his staff</italic> only means that he can walk, leaning on his own strength, without requiring the strength of another person for support.</p>
<h1>Chapter Five</h1>
<p>1. Anyone who has killed inadvertently is banished from the town where he has slain to the cities of refuge. It is a positive command to banish him, as it is written: &#x201C;There he shall remain until the death of the high priest&#x201D; (Numbers 35:25). The court has been warned not to accept ransom from a man who has killed inadvertently, allowing him to stay in his own town, as it is written : &#x201C;You must not accept ransom [in order to allow one to stay home] instead of his flight to a city of refuge&#x201D; (35:32).</p>
<p>2. The man who killed inadvertently is not banished unless the victim died immediately. But if a man wounded a person inadvertently, even though the victim was judged to be fatally hurt and he fell ill and died, the man is not banished, because the victim may have hastened his own death.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>7. Originally, a manslayer with or without intent would flee immediately to one of the cities of refuge, and the court of the town where he killed a person would send and fetch him from there and try him.&#x2014; &#x2014; If condemned to death, he was executed;&#x2014; &#x2014; if acquitted, he was set free;&#x2014; &#x2014; if condemned to exile, he was sent back to his place.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>11. If he unwittingly left the limits of his city of refuge, whoever killed him was banished on account of him, whether blood-avenger or any other man. If a man killed him within the limits of his city of refuge, he was executed on account of him, even if he was a blood-avenger.</p>
<h1>Chapter Seven</h1>
<p>1. If a student was banished to a city of refuge, his teacher must be exiled with him, as it is written: &#x201C;And he shall live&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 19:5); that is, make it possible for him to live. Life without study is like death for scholars who seek wisdom. So too, if a teacher went into exile, his school must be exiled with him.</p>
<p>7. If a homicide was exiled to a city of refuge and its inhabitants wished to honor him, he must say to them: &#x201C;I am a homicide.&#x201D; If they replied: &#x201C;Nevertheless,&#x201D; he should accept the honor from them.</p>
<p>8. An exiled man must never leave his city of refuge, not even to fulfill a religious duty or bear witness in a civil or a capital case, &#x2014; &#x2014; not even if all Israel needs his help, as that of Joab ben Zeruiah; he must not leave the city until the death of the high priest. If he did leave, he surrendered himself to death [as an outlaw], as we have explained.</p>
<p>13. A homicide who returned to his town, after the death of the high priest, was regarded as any other man; if the blood-avenger killed him, he would be executed on account of him, having already obtained atonement in his exile.</p>
<p>14. Even though he had obtained atonement, he could never come back to public office held by him previously. He was deprived of his high office throughout his life, because such a dire mishap had occurred through him.</p>
<h1>Chapter Eight</h1>
<p>1. The Torah commands to set aside cities of refuge, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall set apart three cities&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 19:7). The laws concerning the cities of refuge were observed only in Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p>2. There were six such cities : three were set apart by Moses in Transjordan, and three by Joshua in the Land of Canaan.</p>
<p>5. The court is required to build direct roads to the cities of refuge, to keep them in repair and to have them made wide. All obstacles and obstructions must be removed from them &#x2014; &#x2014; in order not to delay an escaping person, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall prepare the road&#x201D; (19:3). <italic>Refuge, refuge</italic> was written on each crossroad, so that the homicides could know where to turn.</p>
<p>9. All the cities of the Levites offer asylum, each one being a city of refuge, as it is written: &#x201C;In addition to [the six cities of refuge assigned to the Levites] you shall give forty-two cities ; all the cities which you give to the Levites shall be forty-eight&#x201D; (Numbers 35:6-7). The Torah regards them all alike in terms of refuge.</p>
<p>10. What is the difference between the cities of refuge that were set apart as a refuge and the cities of the Levites? The cities of refuge afford asylum with or without consent, as soon as the homicide enters he is given asylum; but the other cities belonging to the Levites afford asylum only if he entered with their consent. Then, too, a homicide residing in one of the cities of refuge need not pay rent, but one who lives in a city of the Levites must pay rent to the landlord.</p>
<h1>Chapter Eleven</h1>
<p>1. The Torah commands that one should make a parapet for his roof, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall make a parapet for your roof&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 22:8). This law applies only to a dwelling house; but a storehouse, a stable, or the like, does not require it. Any house less than four square cubits is exempt from the need of a parapet.</p>
<p>4. There is no difference between a roof or anything else that is dangerous and likely to cause death to a person who might stumble. If, for instance, one has a well or a pit in his courtyard &#x2014; &#x2014; he must build an enclosing ring ten handbreadths high, or put a cover over it, so that a person should not fall into it and die. So too, any obstruction that is a danger to life must be removed as a matter of positive duty and extremely necessary caution.</p>
<p>5. The sages have prohibited many things because they are dangerous to life. If anyone disregards them and says : &#x201C;What claim have others on me if I risk my own life?&#x201D; or: &#x201C;I do not mind this,&#x201D; he should be lashed for disobedience.</p>
<p>6. The rules are: A person must never put his mouth to a pipe spouting water and drink; he must not drink from rivers or ponds at night, for fear that he might swallow a leech without seeing; he must not drink uncovered water, for fear that a snake or any other reptile drank it, and he might die.</p>
<p>14. Even if nine people drank from an uncovered jar and did not die, a tenth one may not drink from it. The sages have reported a case where a tenth person drank and died, since the poison of a snake sinks to the bottom. There is a poison of venomous reptiles that floats on the top and another that remains suspended in the liquid. For this reason, all of it is forbidden, even if the liquid has been passed through a strainer. So too, if nine ate of an uncovered melon and did not die, let not a tenth person eat of it.</p>
<h1>Chapter Twelve</h1>
<p>4. One must not put small change or denars into his mouth, because they may bear the dry saliva of one who suffers from a skin disease or leprosy; they may bear perspiration, and all human perspiration is deadly poison, except that which comes from the face.</p>
<p>12. It is forbidden to sell arms of any kind to heathen ; one should not sharpen their weapons; one should not sell them a knife &#x2014; &#x2014; or anything that is likely to be a public danger. Shields, however, may be sold to them, since they are used only for defense.</p>
<p>13. Just as the sages have prohibited the sale of arms to a heathen, so have they prohibited selling the same to a Jew who sells to a heathen. On the other hand, weapons may be sold to the local citizens&#x2019; force, since they protect the Jewish population.</p>
<p>14. Whatever must not be sold to a heathen must not be sold to a Jewish bandit, since this will encourage a criminal and misdirect him. So too, anyone who misdirects a person, blind on any subject, by giving him wrong advice, or encourages a criminal, who is blind and cannot see the way of truth because of his greedy lust, is transgressing a prohibitive command, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall not place a stumbling block before the blind&#x201D; (Leviticus 19:14), meaning that if a man comes to you for advice, you should give him an advice fitting his needs.</p>
<h1>Chapter Thirteen</h1>
<p>1. If, on the road, one meets a person whose animal is lying helpless under its load, he must help to release the animal whether or not the load is more than it can carry. This is a positive command, as it is written: &#x201C;You must help him&#x201D; (Exodus 23:5).</p>
<p>4. This is the general rule: In any case where, if the animal were his own he would load or unload it, he must load or unload it when it belongs to another person.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>5. If he unloaded and reloaded an animal and it fell down again, he must load and unload again, even a hundred times, as it is written: &#x201C;You must help him. You must help him raise it&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 22:4; 23:5). Accordingly, he should help the owner pull the animal as much as a Persian mile, unless he tells him: &#x201C;I do not need you.&#x201D;</p>
<p>13. If a person encountered two animals, one crouching under its load and the other in need of help in reloading it, he should help unload first to prevent the animal from suffering, and then load the other. This rule applies only where the owners are both enemies or both friends of the person in question. But if one is an enemy and the other a friend, he is required to load for the enemy first, in order to subdue his evil impulse.</p>
<p>14. The enemy mentioned in the Torah (Exodus 23:5) is of Jewish origin, and not a foreign enemy.&#x2014; &#x2014; If one finds him aghast with his load, one must help him load or unload and not leave him there to die. He may possibly stay on because of his property and be exposed to danger, and the Torah insists on saving Jewish lives, whether they are wicked or upright, since they are attached to the Lord and believe in the principles of religion, as it is written: &#x201C;Tell them: By my life, says the Lord God, I have no desire for the death of the wicked man, but for him to live by giving up his evil course&#x201D; (Ezekiel 33:11).</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>SALES</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. Title to an article purchased is not acquired by verbal agreement alone, even if witnesses have testified to such an agreement. If, for example, one said to a person: &#x201C;I am selling you this house, I am selling you this wine, I am selling you this slave,&#x201D; and both agreed on the price: the purchaser was pleased and said &#x201C;I have bought it,&#x201D; and the seller was pleased and said &#x201C;I have sold it&#x201D;; then they said to witnesses: &#x201C;You be our witnesses that A has made a sale and B has procured a purchase,&#x201D; this counts as nothing, as if there had never been an oral agreement between them. The same applies to donor and donee in the case of a gift.</p>
<p>2. But if the article purchased was acquired by one of the modes of acquisition, the purchaser has gained title to it; they need no witnesses, and neither of them may retract.</p>
<p>3. In what manner is title acquired to anything bought? In the case of landed property, by one of the following three things: by money, by deed, or by undisturbed possession.</p>
<p>4. How is title acquired by money? If A sold a house or a field to B, and B paid the price to A, then B has acquired title. This applies only in a place where it is not customary to write a deed of sale ; where, however, it is customary to write a deed of sale, the purchaser acquires title only after the seller has written a deed of sale. Landed property cannot be acquired by less than a penny&#x2019;s worth [as a nominal consideration].</p>
<p>7. How is title acquired by deed? If the seller wrote on a paper or a potsherd or on a leaf: &#x201C;My field is given to you, my field is sold to you,&#x201D; as soon as the deed has reached the hand of the transferee, he has acquired title.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>8. How is title acquired by undisturbed possession? If A sold a house or a field to B, or gave it to him as a gift, as soon as B locked, fenced, or tore down something, for the improvement of the property, he has acquired title to it.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>9. If a man sold a house to a person and handed him the key, it is as if he told the transferee: &#x201C;Go, take possession and acquire title.&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>10. How can a man acquire title by locking? If, for example, a man sold a house or a courtyard with an open door, and the purchaser locked it and then reopened it, he has thereby performed an act of possession and acquired title, since he has made effective use of the property.</p>
<h1>Chapter Two</h1>
<p>1. A Canaanite slave is like landed property as to acquisition of title, and is acquired by money or by writ of sale or by an act of possession.</p>
<p>2. What constitutes an act of possession in the acquisition of slaves? By using them in the manner slaves are employed.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>5. An animal, large or small, is acquired by drawing [it into possession].&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>6. How is an animal acquired by drawing? Needless to say that if the buyer pulled the animal and it moved along, or he mounted it and it moved with him, he has thereby acquired title to it; but even if he merely called the animal and it came, or he struck it with a stick and it ran before him, the moment it moved its legs to go, he acquired title to it, provided he performed the act of drawing in the presence of the owner. If, however, he performed the act of drawing in the absence of the owner, it is necessary that the owner should have told him before the drawing: &#x201C;Go, draw and acquire.&#x201D;</p>
<h1>Chapter Three</h1>
<p>1. According to biblical law, title to both cattle and movable goods is acquired by the payment of cash; as soon as the buyer has paid the cash he has acquired title, and neither party can retract. The sages, however, have ruled that title to movable goods can be acquired only by lifting, or by drawing where lifting is not feasible.</p>
<p>5. Why did the sages institute this rule about movable goods? It was a preventive measure in a case where the object that was bought and paid for by the purchaser has been lost by accident. If, for example, a fire broke out and the object was burned, or robbers came and took it away, the seller might delay and make no effort to save the object, if the title to it should be vested in the purchaser. The sages therefore placed the object in the ownership of the seller, in order that he should strive to save it, since he is held liable to pay for it if it is lost.</p>
<h1>Chapter Four</h1>
<p>11. Be mindful of this important general rule: In buying movables, if a man agreed on the price and then performed the act of lifting up, he has acquired title; but if he first lifted the object, replaced it, and then agreed on the price, he has not acquired title by that lifting. He should lift, or pull the object that is not liftable, after agreeing on the price.</p>
<p>15. It is immaterial whether one performs the act of pulling or that of lifting or that of taking possession by himself, or he tells another to lift or take possession for him, title is thus acquired by him. So too, in other modes of acquisition.</p>
<h1>Chapter Five</h1>
<p>1. All movable property acquires other movable property. If, for example, a person has bartered a cow for a donkey or wine for oil, even though the parties are particular about the price and have made the exchange following an assessment of the worth of each article, as soon as one of them performed the act of pulling or lifting, the other has acquired title to the movables given in exchange wherever they may be at the time; they become his possession, though he has not pulled them.</p>
<p>2. If one has bartered a donkey for a cow and a lamb, and he pulled the cow and not yet the lamb, he has not acquired title, because the act of pulling has not been complete. And so in all similar cases.</p>
<p>5. Landed property, slaves, cattle and all the rest of movables may be acquired by a symbolical form of barter, known as <italic>kinyan.</italic> The principle of this method is that the buyer transfers to the seller an object of no matter how small a value and says to him: &#x201C;Acquire this object in exchange for the courtyard or the wine or the cattle or the slave that you sold me for so much.&#x201D; Thereupon the moment the seller lifted the object and acquired it, the buyer has acquired title to the land or all the aforementioned movables even though he has not pulled them or paid their price, and neither party may retract.</p>
<p>6. A <italic>kinyan</italic> can be made only by means of objects, even if they are not worth a penny. It cannot be made with anything from which it is forbidden to derive a benefit, nor with fruit products, nor with a coin. A <italic>kinyan</italic> cannot be made with objects owned by the seller; instead, objects owned by the buyer must be used.</p>
<p>7. If a third person made a <italic>kinyan</italic> by transferring an article to the seller so that the buyer should thereby acquire title to the object for sale, then the buyer has acquired title to it. Even though the third party transferred the article to the seller on condition that the latter should return it to him, the transaction has been consummated and the buyer has acquired title, because a present made with the condition that it must be returned is legally considered a valid gift.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Six</h1>
<p>1. Although fruit products cannot be used as a means of <italic>kinyan</italic>, as we have explained, they may be acquired by <italic>kinyan.</italic> Coins, however, can neither serve as a means of <italic>kinyan</italic> nor be acquired by <italic>kinyan.</italic> Hence, a coin is not to be acquired by <italic>kinyan</italic> [in terms of a commodity], and should not be used as a means of <italic>kinyan</italic> to effect the acquisition of other objects.</p>
<p>2. Lumps of gold or silver are like bars of iron or copper, all of which are like any other movable property and may be acquired by <italic>kinyan</italic>, and acquire each other in a form of exchange, as we have explained. But silver coins, gold denars, or copper small change are all regarded as purchasing money in relation to any other movable property. Thus, if one has given any of these as the price of movables, he has not acquired title to the movables unless he pulled or lifted them, as we have explained. None of the coins can be acquired by <italic>kinyan</italic> or used as a means of <italic>kinyan.</italic></p>
<p>3. This applies only where one intends to acquire other movables, slaves and landed property, by means of the aforementioned coins. However, gold denars in relation to silver coins have the status of fruit products; so too, copper small change is comparable to fruit products with regard to silver coins.</p>
<p>4. If, for instance, one gave to a person a gold denar in exchange for its equivalent twenty-five silver denars, he has acquired title to the silver even though it has not yet reached him, and the other party is obligated to deliver the twenty-five silver denars, according to the bargain made. If they agreed on new coins, he must deliver new coins; if old coins, he must deliver old coins. If, on the other hand, he gave him twenty-five silver denars in exchange for a gold denar, he has not acquired title to the gold denar unless he has taken it in his hand ; otherwise, either party may retract.</p>
<p>6. So too, disused currency that the government or the state has canceled, or denars that are not current in that state and are not used as a means of transaction unless they are recast into another coin, are regarded as fruit products in every respect and can be acquired by <italic>kinyan;</italic> they can acquire title to money, but money cannot acquire title to them, just as all fruit products [cannot be used as a means of <italic>kinyan</italic>].</p>
<h1>Chapter Seven</h1>
<p>1. If a man paid the price but has not drawn the product [from the seller into his possession], even though title to the article has not been acquired, as we have explained, the one who retracts, whether the buyer or the seller, does not act properly as a Jew should, and must receive the curse expressed in the formula &#x201C;He who punished&#x2026;&#x201D; Even if the man gave only the earnest money, the one who retracts receives the curse beginning with the phrase &#x201C;He who punished&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>
<p>2. How is he to receive this curse? They speak a curse against him as follows: &#x201C;He who punished the generation of the flood and the generation of the tower of Babel, the men of Sodom and Gomorrah, and the Egyptians who were drowned in the sea, will punish him who does not stand by his word.&#x201D; Then the money is refunded.</p>
<p>4. If a person to whom a debt was due said to the debtor: &#x201C;Sell me a cask of wine for the debt you owe me,&#x201D; and the seller agreed, it is as if the creditor paid the money now, and therefore the one who retracts must receive the curse formula. Accordingly, if one has sold a piece of land to a person for a debt he owed him, neither of them can retract, even though the money of the debt is not available at the time of the sale.</p>
<p>5. If one buys from a person land or slaves or other movable property, both having agreed on the price, and the buyer has deposited a pledge for the money, he has not acquired title ; and either of them may retract without being required to receive the curse [against one who fails to keep his word].</p>
<p>6. If one sold an article to a person merely by verbal agreement, both having agreed on the price, and the buyer has marked the purchased article in order to have a distinct sign indicating that it is his, even though he has not yet paid any money, then either one who retracts must receive the curse formula.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>8. Anyone who transacts business by verbal agreement alone should keep his word, although he has received no money, made no mark, and left no pledge. If either of them, purchaser or seller, retracts, he belongs to the class of dishonest men and the sages are displeased with him, although he is not required to receive the curse formula.</p>
<p>10. If one gave money to a person to buy for him land or movable property, and the person put away the other&#x2019;s money and went ahead and purchased the property for himself with his own money, what he has done is done, and he is included among the cheats.</p>
<h1>Chapter Eleven</h1>
<p>1. If one has transferred land or movable property and stipulated conditions that are possible of performance, title to the object is acquired if the conditions are fulfilled, whether they were stated by the transferor or the transferee. The latter cannot acquire title if the conditions are not fulfilled. We have already explained the rules of conditions in the section dealing with the laws of matrimony.</p>
<p>8. If one sold his courtyard or his field and specified at the time that he was selling it in order to make a journey to a certain place, or owing to want of rain, &#x2014; &#x2014; it is as if he made the sale on condition. Accordingly, if rain fell after he had made the sale &#x2014; &#x2014; or it became impossible for him to make the trip to that particular country, &#x2014; &#x2014; he may refund the money and the land will be restored to him, because he stated explicitly that he was selling only to accomplish a specific thing, and it was not accomplished. And so in all similar cases.</p>
<p>9. If, however, one sells unconditionally, even though he has in mind the reason why he is making the sale, and although circumstances make it clear that he is selling merely to accomplish a certain thing, he cannot retract if it is not accomplished, because he has not specified it, and mental reservations are not effective.</p>
<p>12. It once happened that a woman appointed Reuben as her agent to buy her a courtyard from Simeon who was her relative. Simeon, the seller, said to Reuben, the agent: &#x201C;When I will have money, will that lady who is my relative return this land to me?&#x201D; And Reuben replied: &#x201C;You and that lady are as close as brother and sister,&#x201D; as if he meant to say: &#x201C;It is very likely that she will restore it to you, since she does not care much for it.&#x201D; When this case reached the sages, they declared: &#x201C;This agent had acquired no title, because the relative had not relied on the words of the agent who had given him no definite reply; hence, he had not resolved to sell.&#x201D; And so in all similar cases.</p>
<p>15. If a person has obligated himself unconditionally to pay an amount of money to another person, whom he owes nothing at all, he must pay it.&#x2014; &#x2014; If, for example, a man said to witnesses: &#x201C;Be witnesses that I owe that person one hundred shekels,&#x201D; &#x2014; &#x2014; or, in the presence of witnesses, he said to another: &#x201C;I owe you one hundred shekels by writ,&#x201D; he must pay; even though he omitted saying &#x201C;be my witnesses,&#x201D; it is as if he said it, because he used the phrase &#x201C;by writ.&#x201D; Even though both parties admit, and the witnesses know that he owes him nothing, he has obligated himself like one who has made a guaranty. The majority of the Geonim have decided the case in this manner.</p>
<h1>Chapter Twelve</h1>
<p>1. Both seller and buyer are forbidden to defraud each other, as it is written : &#x201C;When you sell to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor, you shall not wrong each other&#x201D; (Leviticus 25:14).&#x2014; &#x2014; Whether one has deceived deliberately or has not been aware of the fraud in a particular sale, he must repay.</p>
<p>2. What are the legal limits of deceit requiring repayment? A sixth of the value of the article. If, for example, one has sold an article worth six denars for five, or worth seven for six, or worth six for seven, or worth five for six, it is a fraud where the transaction is valid but the defrauder has to repay the defrauded amount to the person deceived.</p>
<p>3. If the fraud has amounted somewhat less than that, &#x2014; &#x2014; the defrauder is not required to restore anything, since it is generally customary to forego anything less than a sixth.</p>
<p>4. If the fraud has amounted somewhat more than a sixth, &#x2014; &#x2014; the transaction is void and the defrauded party may return the article and not buy it at all. The defrauder, however, cannot retract if the other person is pleased and accepts the deal.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>8. The law against defrauding applies to an ordinary purchaser and a merchant alike, even though he is an expert. The law against defrauding applies to coins as well as to fruit products and cattle.</p>
<p>9. If, for example, a golden denar was valued at twenty-four silver denars and he exchanged it for twenty or twenty-eight denars, he must refund the amount defrauded. If it was more than this, the exchange deal is invalid; if less than this, it is remitted.</p>
<h1>Chapter Thirteen</h1>
<p>5. If one transacts business on word of honor, the law against defrauding does not apply to him. If, for example, one says : &#x201C;I have bought this article for so much and I make so much profit on it,&#x201D; the purchaser can have no claim of fraud against him.</p>
<p>8. The law of defrauding does not apply to the following items : real estate, slaves, deeds, and Temple property. Even if one has sold them for one denar when they are worth a thousand, or for a thousand when they are worth one denar, the law against defrauding does not apply to them, as it is written: &#x201C;&#x2026; or buy from your neighbor&#x2019;s hand&#x201D; (Leviticus 25:14), meaning something transferred from hand to hand. Real estate is excluded, and so are slaves who are compared to landed property; deeds are excluded, since they have no intrinsic value and serve only for the evidence they contain. The term &#x201C;your neighbor&#x201D; excludes Temple property.</p>
<h1>Chapter Fourteen</h1>
<p>1. We have already explained that if one transacts business on word of honor and has said: &#x201C;I am making so much profit,&#x201D; the law against defrauding does not apply to him. Even if he said: &#x201C;I have bought this article for one <italic>sela</italic> and am selling it for ten,&#x201D; it is legitimate. The courts, however, are required to fix prices and appoint officers for that purpose, so that any merchant should not make all the profit he desires; the law courts should establish one-sixth of the price as the merchants&#x2019; profit; and let the seller not profit more than one-sixth.</p>
<p>2. This rule applies only to commodities that are necessary to life, such as wines, oils, kinds of flour; but for spices such as costus roots, frankincense, and the like, no market price should be fixed, and let the merchant make all the profit he desires.</p>
<p>12. Just as there is a law against defrauding in buying and selling, so there is a law against wronging a person by means of words, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall not wrong each other, but you shall fear your God; I am the Lord&#x201D; (Leviticus 25:17). This refers to wounding the feelings of another by words.</p>
<p>13. If, for instance, someone is a repentant sinner, one must not say to him: &#x201C;Remember your former deeds.&#x201D; If a proselyte comes to study Torah, one must not say to him: &#x201C;Shall the mouth that ate unclean and forbidden food study Torah which has been given by the Lord?&#x201D; If a person has been afflicted with disease and suffering, or if he has buried his children, one must not say to him in the words used by Job&#x2019;s companions in addressing Job: &#x201C;Let your piety reassure you&#x2026; Think now, what guiltless man has ever perished?&#x201D; (Job 4:6-7).</p>
<p>18. A wrong inflicted by means of words is worse than a wrong inflicted in financial dealings, because restitution can be made for one and not the other; one is financial, while the other is personal. Concerning the wrong we do by means of words, the Torah says: &#x201C;You shall fear your God&#x201D; (Leviticus 25:17), since it is a matter entrusted to the heart [over which the legal authorities have no control]. Indeed, anything that is left to the conscience of the individual is referred to by the biblical expression <italic>you shall fear your God.</italic> Whoever cries out to God on account of a wrong done by means of words is answered immediately, as it is written: &#x201C;&#x2026; for I am the Lord&#x201D; (Leviticus 25:17).</p>
<h1>Chapter Eighteen</h1>
<p>1. It is forbidden to deceive people in business dealings, as well as by false pretenses; non-Jews and Jews are all alike in this respect. If one is aware of a defect in the article he is selling, he must let the purchaser know about it. It is forbidden to cheat people even by the use of mere words.</p>
<h1>Chapter Twenty-Two</h1>
<p>1. One cannot tranfser title to what does not yet exist whether by sale, or by gift, or by bequest of a person who is critically ill. If, for example, a person says to another: &#x201C;What this field will yield is sold to you, what this tree will yield is given to you, give to so-and-so what this animal will bear,&#x201D; no title is acquired thereby. And so in all similar cases.</p>
<h1>Chapter Twenty-Three</h1>
<p>5. If one sells the soil itself for a specified time, it is a valid sale and the purchaser may use the land as he pleases, enjoying its fruit products throughout the period of the sale. At the end of the period, the land reverts to its original owner.</p>
<p>6. What difference is there between a person who sells land for a specified period and one who transfers it for the use of its fruit products? One who buys land for the use of its fruit products may not alter the shape of the land and may not build or demolish anything on it; on the other hand, one who buys it for a specified period may build or demolish on it, doing with it during the entire specified time as one who buys it in perpetuity.</p>
<p>7. What is the difference between one who sells a field for the use of its products and one who sells only the products of that field to another? When one merely sells the products of the field, the buyer may not make use of that field at all, not even enter it, except for the purpose of removing the products, while the owner of the field may use it as he pleases. But the owner of a field who sells it for the use of its products may enter it only with the consent of the purchaser, while the purchaser may make use of it as he pleases.</p>
<p>8. What is the difference between one who buys a field for the use of its products and one who rents a field from another? One who buys a field for the use of its products may plant it or sow it whenever he pleases, or leave it untilled ; but the person who rents it may not do so, as it will be explained in connection with leasing. Besides, the person who rents something may not rent it out to a third party; but one who buys may transfer to others whatever he has bought.</p>
<p>9. If one sells the products of a dovecot or the products of a beehive to another, the latter has acquired title ; and it is not considered as if he were selling something nonexistent, because he is not selling doves that will be born or honey that will come into the hive, but he is selling the dovecot for the use of its products or the beehive for the use of its honey. It is like one who leases a pond to another person, where the latter may benefit from whatever he catches there. So too, the person who transfers this dovecot for the use of its products is like one who sells a tree for the use of its fruit.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Twenty-Nine</h1>
<p>1. There are three whose purchase or sale is invalid according to biblical law: the deaf-mute, the imbecile, and the minor. The sages, however, have enacted that the deaf-mute or the minor may have valid business dealings for his livelihood.</p>
<p>2. How does a deaf-mute make a transaction? If one neither hears nor speaks, or speaks but hears nothing, he can buy movable goods by signs, but not landed property. Even with movable goods, his transactions are valid only after he has passed many tests and the court has duly deliberated the case.</p>
<p>3. A speechless person who hears though he cannot speak, or one who has been paralyzed and rendered speechless, both his purchase or sale is valid, and so are his gifts valid in every respect, both in movable goods and in landed property, provided he has been examined by the court in the manner that tests are given in divorce cases, or if he can write with his own hand.</p>
<p>4. Neither the purchase nor the sale of an imbecile is valid, nor are his gifts valid. The court appoints an administrator for imbeciles as it does for minors.</p>
<p>5. One who is alternately insane and sane, as in the case of epileptics, the rule is that when he is sane all his dealings are valid and he may acquire ownership for himself and for others like any sensible person. The witnesses should investigate the matter thoroughly to be sure that he did not perform the act toward the end or at the beginning of his lapse into insanity.</p>
<p>8. The minor should be tested whether or not he is familiar with the nature of business. Sometimes a seven-year-old youngster is clever and intelligent, while another as old as thirteen knows nothing about the nature of a transaction. If a youngster, knowing the nature of business and having no guardian, has made a deal in movable goods and committed an error, his legal status is that of an adult : less than one-sixth is remitted ; one-sixth, the difference is refunded ; [an overcharge of] more than one-sixth, the transaction is invalid, as we have explained.</p>
<p>18. The purchase or sale by a drunken man, and his gifts, are valid. If, however, he has reached the drunken condition of Lot, being too drunk to know what he is doing, his transactions mean nothing, since he has the legal status of a youngster less than six years old.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>ACQUISITION AND GIFTS</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. Whoever takes possession of ownerless property gains title to it. Similarly, whatever is available in deserts, rivers and streams, is ownerless property ; whoever comes first, gains title to it; for example, grass, wood, fruit of forest trees, and the like.</p>
<p>2. If one catches fish in lakes and rivers, or if he catches birds and various wild animals, he gains title, because they are ownerless. However, one should not catch them in another&#x2019;s field ; but if he did catch them there, he has gained title. If the fish, animals and birds, are kept in vivariums owned by others, even if it is a large vivarium where they still must be hunted, they belong to the owner of the vivarium, and whoever hunts there is a robber.</p>
<h1>Chapter Three</h1>
<p>1. If one presents a gift to a person, the donee acquires title to it only by one of several ways whereby a buyer acquires title to the object he has purchased. If, for example, one wishes to make a gift to a person of some movable property, the donee acquires title after lifting it, or drawing it [to his possession] where lifting is not feasible, or by other means whereby movable goods are acquired. If it is landed property or slaves that he gives him, the donee acquires title only after performing an act of possession as a buyer would, or after obtaining the deed of gift. The donee does not gain title by mere words, in which case either of the two may still retract.</p>
<p>6. Whoever has made a gift conditionally, regardless of whether the donor or the donee has imposed the condition, and the donee has taken possession and title, then the gift is valid if the condition has been fulfilled; if not, the gift is null and void, and the donee must restore the products he has consumed; provided the condition is properly phrased.</p>
<p>7. We have already explained that all conditions in connection with gifts, purchases and sales, must contain a double stipulation; the affirmative must be stated before the negative; the condition must precede the act: and the condition must be possible of performance. If one of these provisions is missing, the condition is null and void, as if there has been no condition.</p>
<p>8. Anyone who says &#x201C;on condition&#x201D; is as if he were to say &#x201C;from now on,&#x201D; and is not required to use a double stipulation. I am inclined to agree with some Geonim who formulated this decision. My teachers, however, have taught that only in cases of divorce and marriage is it required to state a double stipulation, where the affirmative should precede the negative. But there is no proof that this is so.</p>
<h1>Chapter Five</h1>
<p>1. If one presents a gift, whether in a state of good health or in illness, it should be open and publicized. If a person said to witnesses: &#x201C;Write a deed of gift secretly and give it to him,&#x201D; it is not effective, because he may be acting subtly so as to cause a loss to others by selling it to someone after having presented it as a gift.</p>
<p>5. It once happened that a man wanted to marry a certain woman, who told him: &#x201C;I will not be wedded to you unless you deed all your property to me.&#x201D; His adult son heard of this and complained that he was leaving him without anything. The father thereupon said to witnesses: &#x201C;Go hide yourselves and deed all my estate to my son as a gift.&#x201D; Then he deeded all his estate to the woman and married her. When the case came before the sages, they said: Neither the son nor the woman acquired title, since the man manifested his unwillingness to deed it to her when he first presented it to his son, even though the gift was invalid because it was concealed. It is as if he had acted under compulsion [when deeding his entire estate to his future wife]. And so it is in all similar cases.</p>
<h1>Chapter Six</h1>
<p>1. We should always appraise the intention of the donor. If circumstances show his final intention, we should act according to the appraisal, even though he failed to specify. To illustrate: A man whose son had gone abroad heard that he died, so he deeded his estate to another person as a completely undisguised gift, and then his son arrived home. The gift in such a case is invalid, because the circumstances make it evident that had he known that his son was alive he would not have given away his entire estate. Accordingly, if he has reserved some of his estate for himself, whether landed or movable property, his gift would be valid.</p>
<p>2. So too, if one deeded his entire estate as a gift to one of his sons, it is immaterial whether he was at the time in good health or dangerously ill, then even if the son is only an infant lying in the cradle, [it is assumed that] the father has appointed him merely as an administrator, and he shares the entire estate equally with his brothers. It is assumed that the father merely intended to have his brothers submit to his authority. However, if he had reserved anything for himself, whether land or movables, the son would have gained title to the gift.</p>
<p>3. This applies only where he deeded the gift to one of his sons. If, however, he deeded his entire estate to a son among daughters or to a daughter among daughters or to one heir among other heirs, then even if he has not reserved anything for himself his gift is valid.</p>
<h1>Chapter Seven</h1>
<p>1. There is a widespread custom in most countries that when a man marries, his friends and acquaintances send him money whereby to recover from the strain of expense in providing for his wife. Those friends and acquaintances who have sent him money come to eat and drink with the groom during the seven days of celebration, or some of them, all in accordance with local custom. The money they send is referred to as wedding gifts, and those who send the money and eat and drink with the groom are referred to as groomsmen.</p>
<p>2. A groomsman&#x2019;s gift is not a perfect gift. It is well known that he has not sent ten denars to eat and drink for it ; he has sent it only with the intention of having his friend send it back to him upon the occasion of his own marriage. Hence, if he got married and the other failed to restore his wedding gift, he can sue him and collect.</p>
<p>3. He cannot sue him unless he marries in the same manner as the other did. If, for instance, Reuben married a maiden and Simeon sent him a wedding gift, and then Simeon married a widow. He cannot sue Reuben to restore the wedding gift to him, because Reuben may plead: &#x201C;I will return it to you only if you marry a maiden, as when you gave me a gift.&#x201D; Similarly, if a man sent a groomsman&#x2019;s gift to one who married a widow, he cannot claim it back when he marries a maiden.</p>
<p>4. If Reuben made a public feast and Simeon made one privately, or if Reuben made a private feast and Simeon made one publicly, they cannot claim anything from each other, because each may plead: &#x201C;I will do for you only as you have done for me.&#x201D;</p>
<p>13. Five things have been asserted about a groomsman&#x2019;s gift: it is collectible through the court, because it is only a loan; it is paid at the proper time only, when the donor marries in the same manner as has the donee, because it is considered as if he had sent the gift on that condition, although he did not explicitly say so; the law against usury does not apply here; that is, even if he sent one denar and the other repaid ten denars it is permissible, because he did not send the denar on condition that the other should return it with an increase; the sabbatical year does not cancel it, because the donor cannot press for its return unless he himself gets married in the manner of the donee ; the firstborn does not obtain a double share of it if it is repaid to the heirs, because it is only prospective, and the firstborn does not take a double share of what is expected to fall due to the father&#x2019;s estate, as it will be explained in the right place.</p>
<h1>Chapter Eight</h1>
<p>1. A blind man, a lame man, a one-armed man, or a person with a headache, or one with a sore eye, or one whose hand or foot hurts, or the like, is legally considered in sound health in reference to everything : his buying, selling, and transfer of gifts [are valid].</p>
<p>2. However, a sick person whose entire body has weakened and whose strength has given way owing to disease, so that he cannot walk in the street but is confined to bed, is referred to as critically ill ; the rules governing his gifts are unlike those that govern the gift of a healthy man. If, for example, a person who is critically ill bequeaths a certain amount to a certain individual, then regardless of whether he stated this on a weekday or on the Sabbath, in writing or not, the donee acquires title to whatever the man has left him upon his death ; no <italic>kinyan</italic> is required, since the verbal statement of one who is critically ill is like a deed written and delivered. This is one of the rabbinic enactments. Even though it is merely a rabbinic enactment, it has been given the force of a biblical law, that the patient&#x2019;s mind might not become deranged knowing that his words are invalid.</p>
<p>23. If a moribund person made a bequest because of imminent death, as when he intimated that he felt sure he was dying, he may retract if he has recovered, even though part of his estate was acquired by means of a symbolical <italic>kinyan.</italic></p>
<p>24. If a man departs on a sea voyage or sets out with a caravan or is led out in chains or is on the verge of death, having been suddenly overwhelmed by a sickness which worsened, his instructions in each of the four situations are deemed orders of a man on the verge of death, and his words are like a deed written and delivered ; they are made valid if he dies. If he has been saved or has recovered, he may retract even if there has been a <italic>kinyan</italic> for part of his estate, in keeping with the legal status of anyone who makes a bequest because of imminent death.</p>
<h1>Chapter Nine</h1>
<p>15. If a dying man deeded his estate to one person and then to another, the last one has acquired it, because the moribund can retract until he dies.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>20. If a dying person has made a sale, it is as valid as that made by a healthy man.</p>
<p>22. In the case of a gift deed made out indefinitely, in which it was not specified whether the donor was in sound health or on the verge of death, if the donor claims: &#x201C;I was critically ill, and now that I have recovered I retract my gift,&#x201D; and the donee declares: &#x201C;He was in good health and he cannot retract,&#x201D; then the donee must bring proof that the donor was in good health. If he has found no proof, the donor takes an exemption oath whereby he is freed, and the land remains in the possession of the donor.</p>
<h1>Chapter Twelve</h1>
<p>1. If a dying person said: &#x201C;This son of mine shall be my heir,&#x201D; then that son alone is his heir and the other sons are not. So too, if he said this in reference to one of his daughters or one of his brothers or other heirs, his words are valid.</p>
<p>2. However, if a man in good health makes such a statement, his words are invalid.</p>
<p>14. If a deed of gift made by a person in sound health contains the phrase <italic>from today and after death</italic>, it is like a gift of a moribund person, title to which is acquired only ofter the donor&#x2019;s death, because the meaning of these words is that, though the donee has acquired the substance as of today, he obtains possession of it and may eat its products only after the donor&#x2019;s death.</p>
<p>15. If it is written in a deed of gift that a certain party shall acquire title to a certain piece of land after the donor&#x2019;s death, it is immaterial whether or not the deed contains a <italic>kinyan</italic>, and the beneficiary acquires title now to become effective after the donor&#x2019;s death. Since the deed contains a date, and on that date the donor was alive, the date proves that he transferred title to the donee while still alive. Had the donor intended to transfer title by this document [not while alive but] after his death, he would not have stated the date. Accordingly, even if it is not written in the document <italic>from today and after death</italic>, the beneficiary has the right of ownership after the donor&#x2019;s death. The reason that we do write in all gift and sale documents <italic>from now</italic>, even if they are dated, is only to expatiate by inserting what is not absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>16. If a man in sound health gave a gift and wrote in the deed <italic>in life and in death</italic>, it is a perfectly valid gift in life, since <italic>in life</italic> is written in the document. The phrase <italic>and in death</italic> means about the same as <italic>henceforth and forever</italic>, and it is one of those embellishments inserted in the texture of a deed.</p>
<p>17. Sincerely upright men of good works do not accept gifts from men; they trust in God, blessed be he, and not in philanthropists. Indeed, it is written: &#x201C;He who hates gifts will live&#x201D; (Proverbs 15:27).</p>

<title>NEIGHBORS</title>
<h1>Chapter Six</h1>
<p>1. The inhabitants of a town may lawfully compel one another to share in building a defense wall, gates and bars for the town, to help build a synagogue for their use, and to purchase a <italic>Sefer Torah</italic> and books of the Prophets and Sacred Writings, so that any member of the community may read them whenever he pleases.</p>
<p>2. If a person has bought a town in Eretz Yisrael, the court induces him to buy for himself land in all the four directions of the town for purposes of creating a Jewish settlement in Eretz Yisrael. The owners of a stretch of fields may compel one another to dig a large ditch and a small ditch between them.</p>
<p>3. If a man has a courtyard in another town, the inhabitants of that town may lawfully compel him to share in digging cisterns, trenches, caves, and a water-channel; but they cannot impose other duties upon him. If he has been residing among them in that town, they may coerce him to share in everything.</p>
<p>4. When funds are collected from the city residents for building the defense wall, they should collect according to the proximity of the homes to the wall; the closer one lives to the wall the more he should contribute.</p>
<p>5. Anyone who has lived in the town for twelve months, or bought a residential house there, must share with the residents of the town in everything that is needed for the repair of the wall and the gates, the hire of the horsemen who guard the city, and all similar things that pertain to the safeguarding of the town.</p>
<p>6. All things needed for the safeguarding of the city are taken from the citizens, including orphans, but not from Torah scholars, since the scholars are not in need of extra protection: the Torah is their protection. But for the repair of the roads and the streets even scholars are taxed. If the entire population comes out to do the repairing by themselves, scholars should not come out with them, because it is not right for scholars to degrade themselves in the presence of the common people.</p>
<p>8. The residents of an alley may lawfully prevent one another from letting a tailor or a tanner or any other craftsman settle among them. If a craftsman has been in an alley without being hindered, or if there has been a bathhouse or a shop or a mill, and someone comes and makes another bathhouse next to the first, or another mill, the owner of the first cannot prevent him, claiming: &#x201C;You are cutting off my livelihood.&#x201D; Even if the owner of the second is from another alley, he cannot be prevented, since that type of craft is already in their midst. A stranger from another country, however, who comes to open a shop or a bathhouse close to one that is there already, may well be prevented. But if he has contributed along with the other citizens toward payment of the royal tax, he cannot be prevented.</p>
<p>9. The citizens cannot lawfully hinder peddlers who travel from town to town, because there is a regulation adopted by Ezra permitting them to peddle, so that perfume may be readily available to the daughters of Israel. But they cannot establish permanent residence without the consent of the inhabitants of the town. If the peddler is a scholar, he may establish residence anywhere he pleases.</p>
<p>10. The citizens may lawfully prevent merchants from bringing their merchandise for sale inside the towns; if the traders sell only on the market day, they cannot be prevented, provided they do the selling in the market ; but they must not go from door to door even on a market day. If they have debts to collect in town, they may sell as much as they need for their livelihood even on a non-market day, until they collect their debts and leave.</p>
<p>11. If one of the residents of a blind alley wishes to become a general practitioner or a surgeon or a weaver, or a teacher of heathen children, the residents of the alley may lawfully prevent him, because he would increase the number of people coming and going. So too, if one has a house in a cooperative courtyard, he must not rent it out to a general practitioner or a surgeon or a weaver, or a Jewish scribe who writes deeds, or a teacher of heathen children.</p>
<p>12. If there is a shop in a courtyard, the residents may interfere with the owner and say to him: &#x201C;We cannot sleep on account of the noise of those who come and go. He should therefore do his work in his shop and sell the product in the market. But they cannot protest and tell him: &#x201C;We cannot sleep on account of the noise of the hammer or the mill,&#x201D; since he has already established the right to do this. So too, he has the right to teach Torah to Jewish children in his house, and the partners cannot protest and claim: &#x201C;We cannot sleep because of the noise of the school children.&#x201D;</p>
<h1>Chapter Ten</h1>
<p>1. A tree may not be grown within twenty-five cubits from the town, or fifty cubits if it is a carob or a sycamore tree, in order to preserve the beauty of the town. Every tree that is found closer to town should be cut down. If the tree was there first, the residents of the town must compensate the owner for it. If it is doubtful which was there first, the owner of the tree is not compensated; he takes his wood and leaves.</p>
<p>3. Carcasses, graves, and tanneries must be removed fifty cubits from the town.</p>
<p>4. A tannery may be set up only on the east side of the town, because the east wind is warm and reduces the bad odor resulting from tanning.</p>
<p>7. If one has a tree in his field close to the cistern of his neighbor, the owner of the cistern cannot interfere with him by claiming: &#x201C;The roots of the tree will penetrate my cistern and damage it,&#x201D; because this is a damage that comes automatically after some time ; when he planted the tree he caused no harm to the cistern. Just as the one may dig in his premises, so may the other plant in his own. So too, if Reuben dug a cistern, and as he descended he found roots of Simeon&#x2019;s tree in his field, he may cut the roots and continue digging, and the wood belongs to him.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Twelve</h1>
<p>4. If one of the brothers or partners has sold his share to a stranger, the buyer may lawfully be removed. The other brothers or partners reimburse him and he leaves, so that a stranger might not thrust himself upon them.</p>
<p>5. Furthermore, if a man sold his land to a stranger, his neighbor owning adjoining land has the right to pay the price back to the buyer and evict him; the distant buyer is treated as if he were an agent of the owner of the adjacent field. The law of pre-emption prevails regardless of whether the sale was made by the owner in person or through an agent or by the court. Even if the [new] buyer is a scholar, a neighbor, or a relative to the seller, and the owner of the adjacent field is ignorant and distant, the latter has nevertheless priority and may lawfully evict the buyer. This rule is derived from the biblical expression : &#x201C;Do what is right and good in the sight of the Lord&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 6:18). The sages have declared : Since the purchaser can as easily buy a similar field elsewhere, it is good and right that the owner of the adjacent land should buy this place rather than a distant person. (Bava Metzia 108a).</p>
<p>9. If one gave property as a mortgage and then sold it to the mortgagee, the law of pre-emption does not apply. So too, if one sold a distant piece of property that he might redeem one that is close to his home, or if he sold an inferior field that he might redeem a better one for its price, or if he sold land to pay the royal tax or to take care of funeral expenses or for maintenance to wife or daughters, the neighbor&#x2019;s right of pre-emption does not apply to any of these cases, and the buyer acquires title. Why does not the right of pre-emption apply in such cases? Because in all these, the owners are anxious to sell because of urgent need. If you were to apply to them the rule of pre-emption, they would find no buyer, for one would say: &#x201C;Why should I bother and purchase so that the adjacent landowner may come and evict me? The owners cannot afford to wait until the adjacent landowner will bring money and buy the property.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>AGENTS AND PARTNERS</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. If one said to his messenger: &#x201C;Go out and sell a piece of land for me,&#x201D; or &#x201C;movable goods,&#x201D; or &#x201C;buy for me,&#x201D; the latter can sell and buy and act as his agent, and all his actions are valid.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. If an agent has transgressed the bidding of his principal, his acts are void. So too, if he has committed an error in any quantity soever, whether in realty or in movables, his principal may lawfully retract, because he can say: &#x201C;I have sent you to do the right thing as my agent and not the wrong thing.&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Two</h1>
<p>6. A broker is an agent who is paid for his services. Accordingly, if he acted otherwise than his principal&#x2019;s instructions, he must pay for the loss he has caused. If, for example, Reuben gave an object to Simeon the broker and told him: &#x201C;Sell this for me, but do not sell it for less than one hundred,&#x201D; and he went and sold it for fifty, he must pay fifty of his own. If, however, he sold it for two hundred, it all belongs to Reuben. And so it is in all similar cases.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Three</h1>
<p>1. If a man has a piece of land in the care of another person, or if he has movables deposited, and he wishes to appoint an agent to enter a lawsuit against that person and to take the land or the deposited object away from him, he should write an authorization for him. This authorization should be confirmed by the symbolical transfer of some article, referred to as <italic>kinyan</italic>, and he should address him in writing with these words: &#x201C;Plead, acquire, and dispossess for yourself,&#x201D; or something like this. If he has not written such an authorization for the agent, the latter cannot enter a suit against the other, who can say to him: &#x201C;You are not entitled to sue me.&#x201D; And even if he has written such an authorization for the agent, the latter remains no more than an agent, and whatever he wins belongs to his principal. All the expenses that the agent incurs in a case to which he has been authorized must be defrayed by his principal, for it is written in the deed of authorization: &#x201C;Whatever you will spend on this case I will have to pay.&#x201D;</p>
<p>7. If one has money deposited with another and he wishes to authorize an an agent to obtain it for him, the formal authorization is of no avail in such a case, because coins cannot be acquired by symbolic barter. How then should he do? He should give the agent any piece of land soever and transfer title to the money along with it, so that he may obtain the money by means of this authorization. The agent can then proceed to sue the other party and obtain the money.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Six</h1>
<p>1. If two persons transact business with funds held in partnership, even though the money has been provided by only one of the two, it is called a partnership ; in the case of either a loss or a profit, it is divided equally.&#x2014; &#x2014; But if only one of the partners transacts business with the money held in partnership, even though the money has been provided by both, it is called <italic>&#x00E9;sek</italic>, and the one who carries on the business is called <italic>mithassek</italic>, because it is he alone who engages in the transactions ; his partner who does not carry on the business is called the investor.</p>
<p>2. The sages have provided that when someone gives money to another person to do business, half the amount should be regarded as a loan, so that the one who engages in the transactions (<italic>mithassek</italic>) is held responsible for it, even if it is lost by accident; the other half should be in the form of a deposit, so that the investor remains responsible for it. Accordingly, if half the amount that is regarded as a deposit is stolen or lost, the <italic>mithassek</italic> is not required to pay. Hence, the profit made by this half belongs to the investor.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>3. The sages have furthermore provided that when anyone advances capital to another to do business, and there is a loss or a profit, and he does not care to pay the other the daily wages for his work, nor have they made any agreement as to wages, one-third of the profit made by the half that is considered a deposit, which is one-sixth of the profit of the entire amount, should serve as the wage of the <italic>mithassek</italic> as to the half serving as a deposit. Accordingly, if they have made a profit, the <italic>mithassek</italic> will receive two-thirds of the profit: half the profit for half the amount in the form of a loan, and one-sixth of the entire profit as compensation for doing business with the deposit, totaling in all two-thirds of the profit, while the investor will receive one-third of the entire profit. In the case of a loss, the <italic>mithassek</italic> (operator) will bear one-third of it, since he is responsible for half the loss owing to half the amount in the form of a loan, but he is allowed one-sixth as compensation for handling the half which is regarded as a deposit; hence, one-third of the loss is borne by him, and the investor bears two-thirds of the loss.</p>
<h1>Chapter Nine</h1>
<p>1. All partners, tenants, guardians appointed by the court over orphans, &#x2014; &#x2014; must each take an oath imposed by the sages in a case of doubtful claim (suspicion of fraud) : perhaps he has robbed the other in a transaction, or maybe he was careless in computing the accounts between them. Why did the sages institute this oath? Because these people are likely to decide the law to their advantage, thinking that whatever they take from the property of the investor belongs rightfully to them, inasmuch as they carry on the business and do all the work. Hence, the sages have ruled that they should be required to take an oath in a doubtful claim, so that they may do all their work justly and faithfully.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>SLAVES</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. A Hebrew slave spoken of in the Torah is an Israelite whom the court sold into servitude forcibly, or one who sold himself voluntarily. If, for example, a man committed a theft and has no means to pay the value of the stolen object, the court sells him, as we have stated in the section concerning theft. With the exception of a thief, the court may not sell any Israelite. When the Torah says: &#x201C;If you buy a Hebrew slave&#x201D; (Exodus 21:2), it refers to one whom the court has sold. Of such a one it is written in Deuteronomy: &#x201C;If your fellow Hebrew is sold to you&#x201D; (15:12). The person who voluntarily sells himself into slavery is an Israelite who has become exceedingly poor, and the Torah has permitted him to sell himself, as it is written: &#x201C;If your brother becomes poor and sells himself to you&#x201D; (Leviticus 25:39). He is not permitted to sell himself and put the money away or buy merchandise or utensils with it, or give it to a creditor. He can sell his freedom only if he needs the money for food. One is not permitted to sell himself unless he has nothing left, not even clothing. Only then may he sell himself.</p>
<p>2. We have already explained that a woman may not be sold by the court for theft, nor may she sell herself.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>3. If the court sells a Hebrew slave, it sells him only to an Israelite or to a true proselyte. So too, if one voluntarily sells himself, he must not sell himself to a heathen, or even to a resident alien who renounced idolatry. If, however, he broke the law and sold himself even to an idolater, or even to the idol itself [to take care of it], he is sold, as it is written: &#x201C;If he sells himself to the resident alien &#x2026; or to an offshoot of an alien&#x2019;s family&#x201D; (Leviticus 25:47). <italic>Offshoot</italic> alludes to one who sells himself [to be of service] to the idol itself.</p>
<p>4. If one comes and tells you: &#x201C;I am going to sell myself to a heathen,&#x201D; you are not obligated to pay attention to him unless he has sold himself already. But after he has sold himself to a heathen, even though he has broken the law and acted wrongfully, it is a duty to redeem him, so that he may not become assimilated with idolaters, as it is written: &#x201C;After he has sold himself he should be bought back.&#x201D;</p>
<p>5. Whether he sells himself or is sold by the court, he must not be sold publicly at an auction place or in a backstreet, as slaves are generally sold, for it is written: &#x201C;They must not be sold as slaves are sold&#x201D; (Leviticus 25:42). He should rather be sold privately and politely.</p>
<p>6. It is forbidden to work a Hebrew slave ruthlessly. What is meant by ruthless work? It is work that has no definite time or limit, or needless work designed only to keep the slave working and occupied. Hence, the sages have said: The master should not tell the Hebrew slave: &#x201C;Pluck weeds under the vines until I arrive,&#x201D; because he has not given him a time limit. He should rather tell him : Pluck weeds until a certain hour or up to a certain place. Nor should he say to him: &#x201C;Dig up this place,&#x201D; when he does not need it. It is even forbidden to tell him to prepare a glass of hot or cold water for him if he does not need it. By doing this he breaks a prohibitive law, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall not rule over him ruthlessly&#x201D; (43). This implies that the Hebrew slave is to do for the master only what is time-marked and needed.</p>
<p>7. An Israelite who bought any Hebrew slave is forbidden to impose upon him humiliating tasks, performed by slaves only, such as making him carry his clothing to the bathhouse, or take off his shoes, as it is written: &#x201C;Do not subject him to the treatment of a slave&#x201D; (39). He must treat him as a hired worker, as it is written: &#x201C;You must let him stay with you as a hired servant and a resident alien&#x201D; (40).&#x2014; &#x2014; This applies only to a Hebrew slave, who feels humiliated by having been sold. It is, however, permissible to impose the work of a slave upon an Israelite who has not been sold, since the latter is doing this work voluntarily and with his own consent.</p>
<p>9. The master must treat his Hebrew male and female slaves as his equals as to food, drink, clothing, and shelter, as it is written: &#x201C;Because he fares well with you&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 15:16), meaning that you should not eat white bread, and the slave black bread; you should not drink old wine, and he new wine; you should not sleep on a feather bed, and he on straw; you should not live in the city, and he in the village; or you in the village, and he in the city, as it is written: &#x201C;He shall come out from staying with you&#x201D; (Leviticus 25:41). Hence, the sages have declared: &#x201C;He who has bought a Hebrew slave is like one who has acquired a master for himself&#x201D; (Kiddushin 20a). He should treat him brotherly, as it is written : &#x201C;You must not lord it over your brothers the children of Israel&#x201D; (Leviticus 25:46). Nevertheless, the slave should behave as a slave in the servile work he does for his master.</p>
<p>10. The laws pertaining to Hebrew female and male slaves are applicable only when the law of the jubilee year applies, regardless of whether it is a Hebrew slave who has sold himself or one whom the court has sold. We have already explained as to when jubilees were discontinued.</p>
<h1>Chapter Two</h1>
<p>2. If the court has sold him, he serves six years from the day he was sold. At the beginning of his seventh year he goes free. If the sabbatical year intervenes during the six years, he continues to serve in it. If, however, the jubilee year intervenes, even though he was sold only one year before jubilee, he goes free, as it is written : &#x201C;He shall serve with you only until the jubilee year&#x201D; (Leviticus 25:40). &#x201C;In this year of jubilee, each of you shall return to his possession&#x201D; (13).</p>
<p>3. If one sells himself into servitude, he may sell himself for more than six years. If, for example, he sold himself for ten or twenty years, and the jubilee year intervened, even after one year, he goes free during the jubilee, as it is written: &#x201C;He shall serve with you only until the jubilee year.&#x201D;</p>
<p>8. It is immaterial whether one sold himself or was sold by the court, to an Israelite or to a heathen, he can deduct the time he has already served from the amount of his redemption and go free. If, for example, he was sold for sixty denars, and he has served four years and found means to liberate himself, he pays twenty denars and goes free. So too, if he sold himself to serve for ten years, he deducts four denars for each year that he has served and pays for the rest with money or its equivalent and goes free.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Three</h1>
<p>4. A Hebrew slave is not permitted to marry a Canaanite bondmaid unless he already has an Israelite wife and children. If, however, he has no Israelite wife and children, his master must not give him a Canaanite bondmaid to marry. This rule is a matter of tradition. Even if the one sold is of a priestly family, he is permitted to live with a Canaanite bondmaid throughout the time of his servitude.</p>
<p>6. One who sold himself is not subject to the law of having his ear pierced (Exodus 21:6) ; if, however, the court sold him and he has served six years and refuses to go free, his ear is pierced and he continues to serve until the jubilee year, or until the death of the master.</p>
<h1>Chapter Four</h1>
<p>2. A father may not lawfully sell his daughter into servitude unless he has become poor and has nothing whatsoever left of land or movables or even personal clothing. And yet, the father should be compelled to buy her back after he has sold her because it disgraces the family. If the father has fled or died or had no means to buy her back, she must serve until she goes free.</p>
<p>4. A Hebrew bondmaid serves six years, like a Hebrew slave whom the court has sold, as it is written: &#x201C;If your fellow Hebrew, man or woman, is sold to you, he shall serve you six years&#x2026;&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 15:12); and she goes free at the beginning of the seventh year. If the jubilee year intervened during the six years, she goes free without payment, like a male slave. If the master has died, even though he has left a son, she goes free, as in the case of a male slave whose ear has been pierced, as it is written: &#x201C;Do the same with your female slave&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 15:17).</p>
<h1>Chapter Nine</h1>
<p>8. It is permissible to work a heathen slave relentlessly. Even though it is lawful, the quality of benevolence and the paths of wisdom demand of a human being to be merciful and striving for justice. One should not press his heavy yoke on his slave and torment him, but should give him to eat and drink of everything. The sages of old were in the habit of sharing with the slave every dish they ate, and they fed the cattle as well as the slaves before they themselves sat down to eat.&#x2014; &#x2014; Nor should a master disgrace his servant by hand or by words; the biblical law surrendered them to servitude, but not to disgrace (Niddah 47a). He should not madly scream at his servant, but speak to him gently and listen to his complaints.&#x2014; &#x2014; Cruelty is frequently to be found only among heathen who worship idols. The progeny of our father Abraham, however, the people of Israel upon whom God bestowed the goodness of the Torah, commanding them to keep the laws of goodness, are merciful toward all creatures. So too, in speaking of the divine attributes, which he has commanded us to imitate, the psalmist says: &#x201C;His mercy is over all his works&#x201D; (Psalm 145:9). Whoever is merciful will receive mercy, as it is written: &#x201C;He will be merciful and compassionate to you and multiply you&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 13:18).</p>

<title>HIRING</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. Four guardians have been mentioned in the Torah, but only three rules govern their liability. The four guardians are: 1) the gratuitous guardian 2) the borrower, 3) the paid guardian, and 4) the hirer.</p>
<p>2. The three rules that govern their liability are:<br/>a) A gratuitous guardian from whom the deposited object was stolen or lost, and needless to say if it was overcome by a major accident, as in the case of an animal that dropped dead or was carried off, may take an oath that he had guarded it properly and be free from liability, as it is written: &#x201C;When a man gives money or goods to another for safekeeping, and they are stolen from the man&#x2019;s house &#x2026; the owner of the house shall depose before the judges (Exodus 22:6-7).<br/>b) A borrower must make restitution in every case, whether the object borrowed was lost or stolen or overcome by a major accident, as when a borrowed animal dropped dead or was injured or carried off. Concerning the borrower it is written: &#x201C;When a man borrows [an animal] from another, and it was injured or died, its owner not being with it, he must make restitution&#x201D; (13).<br/>c) A paid guardian and a hirer are both subject to one rule. They are obligated to make restitution if either the hired object or the deposit for a fee was stolen or lost. But if something worse happened [through a superior force], as in the case of an animal that dropped dead or was injured, carried off, or torn by beasts, the paid guardian or the hirer may take an oath that the animal met with an accident and be released from liability, as it is written: &#x201C;When a man gives to another a donkey, an ox, a sheep or any other animal to guard, and it dies or is injured, or is carried off, with no witness about, an oath before the Lord shall decide between the two of them&#x201D; (9-10). It is written moreover: &#x201C;But if it was stolen from him, he shall make restitution to its owner&#x201D; (11).<br/>Hence it follows that the gratuitous guardian clears himself by his oath in all cases; the borrower pays in all cases, except in the case of an animal that died from work, as will be explained ; the receiver of a fee and the hirer pay for what is lost or stolen, but they take an oath about the major accidents, namely about the injured or captured or dead or torn animal; or in a case where the object was lost in shipwreck or was taken by armed robbers; and so too, all similar major accidents.<br/>3. When a man gives something to another for safekeeping, whether gratuitously or for a fee, or if he lent or rented it to him, the guardian is free from all responsibility if he borrowed or hired the services of the owner. Even if he was negligent with regard to the safekeeping of the object and it was lost through his fault, he is not answerable, as it is written: &#x201C;If its owner was with it, no restitution need be paid; but if it was hired, he loses the hiring fee&#x201D; (14).&#x2014; &#x2014; This [biblical verse] has been traditionally interpreted to mean that if the lender was with the borrower at the moment of the borrowing, though he was not with him at the time of the theft or the death of the animal, the borrower is exempt. But if the lender was not with the borrower at the moment of the borrowing, even though he was with him at the time the animal died or was carried off, the borrower is liable. The same rule applies to all other bailees: they are exempt if the owners were present, even in a case of negligence.</p>
<h1>Chapter Seven</h1>
<p>2. If a man rented his house to another for a year, and it became a leap-year, the advantage of an extra month is gained by the tenant. If the lease was made by the month, the benefit of the extra month accrues to the lessor.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>5. If a man leased an orchard, or if it was mortgaged to him, for ten years, and it dried up during the term of the lease, the dead trees should be sold and land should be purchased for the price realized from the sale. The lessee or mortgagee may enjoy its fruit products until the end of the lease or the mortgage. Neither the creditor nor the debtor may use the trees that dried up or were cut, since they would constitute a form of usury.</p>
<h1>Chapter Eight</h1>
<p>2. The man who rents a field or an orchard to cultivate and to spend money on it, giving the landowner one-third or one-fourth of the produce, or anything they have stipulated, is called share-cropper. Whatever is spent on fencing the land, the landowner is required to pay ; and whatever is spent on extra precaution, the tenant or share-cropper is required to pay.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>8. If one leased a field from another and refused to weed it, saying to the lessor: &#x201C;What are you losing? I am paying you rent, anyway,&#x201D; we should not listen to him, since the lessor may reply: &#x201C;Tomorrow you may probably vacate it, and it will yield me nothing but weeds.&#x201D; Even if the lessee said: &#x201C;I will plough it up at the end of my term,&#x201D; we should not listen to him.</p>
<p>9. If one leased a field from another to sow it in barley, he may not sow it in wheat, since wheat exhausts the soil more than barley. If he leased it to sow it in wheat, he may sow it in barley; in pulse, he may not sow it in grain; in grain, he may sow it in pulse.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Nine</h1>
<p>1. If a man hired workers and told them to work early or to work late, he cannot compel them to do so where it is customary not to work early or not to work late.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>3. If a man said to his agent: &#x201C;Go and hire workers for me at three <italic>zuz</italic>,&#x201D; and he went and hired them at four, then if the agent said to them: &#x201C;I am responsible for your wages,&#x201D; he must pay them four even though he receives only three from the employer, and he loses one out of his own pocket. If, however, he said to them: &#x201C;The employer is responsible for your wages,&#x201D; the employer should pay them according to local custom.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Eleven</h1>
<p>1. It is a positive command to pay the hired man his wages on time, as it is written: &#x201C;You must pay him his wages on the same day&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 24:15). If the employer delayed the payment till after it was due, he has transgressed a prohibitive command, as it is written: &#x201C;Let not the sun go down upon it.&#x201D; The transgressor is not to be lashed for this, since he is required to pay money. One must pay on time not only the hire of a human being but also the hire of an animal and the hire of implements. If one put off the payment, he has transgressed a prohibitive command.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. Anyone who detains the wages of a hired man is as if he took his life, as it is written: &#x201C;His life depends on it&#x201D; (15). &#x2014; &#x2014; When are wages due? A hireling for the day collects his wages all night, and about him it is written: &#x201C;You shall not detain overnight the wages of your day laborer until morning&#x201D; (Leviticus 19:13). A hireling for the night collects all day, and about him it is written: &#x201C;You must pay him his wages on the same day&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 24:15). A hireling by the hour during the day collects all day; a hireling by the hour during the night collects all that night ; a hireling by the week, by the month, by the year, by a seven-year period, collects all day if his term ends in the daytime; if his term ends in the night, he collects all that night.</p>
<p>3. If a man gave his garment to a craftsman and the craftsman completed his work on it and informed the owner about it, the latter has not broken a law even if he has delayed the payment for a period of ten days, as long as the object remains in the hands of the craftsman. If the craftsman gave him the garment in the middle of the day, the owner has transgressed the law against withholding the wages overnight as soon as the sun went down, because contract work is like hire, and the employer is required to pay the employee on time.</p>
<p>4. If a man said to his agent: &#x201C;Go and hire workers for me,&#x201D; and the agent told them: &#x201C;The employer is responsible for your wages,&#x201D; neither of them transgresses the law against withholding overnight: the employer, because he did not hire them ; and the agent, because they did not work for him. If, however, the agent did not say to them: &#x201C;The employer is responsible for your wages,&#x201D; the agent commits a transgression if they are not paid on time. The hirer commits a transgression only when the employee has asked for the wages and he has failed to pay. But if the employee has not asked to be paid, or if he did ask and the employer did not have the money to pay, or if he gave the employee a draft on another person and the employee accepted it, the employer is free from liability [if the employee fails to collect the draft within the set time].</p>
<p>5. If a man withheld the wages of an employee until after it was due, he must pay him immediately even though he has already transgressed a positive as well as a negative command. And as long as he keeps withholding the wages thereafter, he transgresses a negative command based on the words of the sages, as it is written: &#x201C;Never say to your fellow man: Go, and come again&#x201D; (Proverbs 3:28).</p>
<p>6. If an employee that was hired in the presence of witnesses demanded his wages within the set time and the employer told him : &#x201C;I have given you your wages,&#x201D; while the employee claimed: &#x201C;I have received nothing,&#x201D; then, by an enactment of the sages, the employee should take an oath while holding a sacred object in his hand, and collect what he claims, as in the case of any claimant who swears and collects, because the employer is preoccupied with his workmen [and may have forgotten to pay], while the employee sets his heart upon this wage. Even if the employer is a minor, the employee takes an oath and collects.<br/>If, however, the employer hired the man in the absence of witnesses, he is believed when he says: &#x201C;I have hired you and paid your wage,&#x201D; since he could say: &#x201C;Nothing of the sort, I have never hired you.&#x201D; The employer therefore takes a rabbinic oath of exemption that he has paid, or a biblical oath if he admitted part of the claim, as in the case of all other lawsuits.<br/>If the employee had one witness that the man hired him, he is of no help to him. So too, if the employee asked to be paid subsequent to the time when the wage was due, even though he had been hired in the presence of witnesses, [the rule applied to him is that] the man who claims anything from another must bring proof. If the employee has produced no evidence [that he had been asking for his wage ever since it had become due], the employer takes a rabbinic exemption oath. If, however, the employee has produced evidence that he had been demanding the wage all the time, he takes an oath and collects the same day of his demand. If, for example, he worked for the employer on a Monday until evening, payment is due throughout the night preceding Tuesday, but he cannot take an oath and collect on Tuesday. If, however, he has brought witnesses that he had been demanding his wage throughout the night preceding Tuesday, he takes an oath and collects throughout Tuesday. But from the night preceding Wednesday and thereafter, the rule is applied: the man who claims anything from another must produce proof. So too, if he has brought witnesses that he had kept demanding his wage until Thursday, he takes an oath and collects throughout Thursday.</p>
<p>7. If the employer says: &#x201C;I have agreed to pay you two <italic>zuz</italic>,&#x201D; and the employee claims: &#x201C;You have agreed to pay me three <italic>zuz</italic>,&#x201D; in such a case the sages have not enacted that the employee should take an oath, but: the man who claims anything from another must produce proof. If he has brought no evidence, the employer takes an oath while holding a sacred object, even though he has already given him two <italic>zuz</italic> or told him: &#x201C;Here they are.&#x201D; This rule is by rabbinic enactment, so that the employee should not walk away discouraged. This applies only where the hiring took place in the presence of witnesses who did not know how much the employer agreed to pay to the employee, who demanded his wage within the set time. If, however, he was hired in the absence of witnesses, or if he demanded his wage after the time it had become due, let the employer take an exemption oath that he did not agree to pay the employee more than what he has already paid him, or that he owes him no more than what he has offered to pay, as is the rule regarding all claims.</p>
<p>8. If a man gives his garment to a craftsman for repair and then the craftsman says: &#x201C;You have stipulated to pay me two <italic>zuz</italic>,&#x201D; and the employer says: &#x201C;I have stipulated only one,&#x201D; as long as the garment is in the hands of the craftsman and he is in position to claim that he has acquired it by purchase, he may take an oath while holding a sacred object and collect. He may claim it for all it is worth as his payment. But if the garment is out of his possession or if he has no <italic>&#x1E25;azakah</italic> (right of possession) in it and cannot claim that he has acquired it by purchase, [the rule applied is :] the man who claims anything from another must produce evidence. If he has not produced evidence, the owner of the garment takes an exemption oath, or a biblical oath if he has admitted part of the claim, as is the rule in all claims. The law of a hired man is not applicable to such a case.</p>
<p>9. A hired worker who comes to take an oath should not be treated with strictness, and should not be made to take additional oaths at all; he is to swear only that he has not received his wage and be paid. All others who come to take an oath are not to be treated as leniently as a hired man, for whom we should make it easy. The court should open proceedings by saying to him: &#x201C;Do not grieve; take an oath and collect.&#x201D; Even if his wage was only a penny, and the employer claims <italic>I have paid it</italic>, the hired man can collect only by oath. So too, all the claimants who take an oath and collect cannot collect even a penny without a quasi-biblical oath [while holding a sacred object].</p>
<h1>Chapter Twelve</h1>
<p>1. When men are working at anything that grows from the soil, while the work is yet unfinished, whether it is detached from the soil or still attached to it and the men are engaged in the final processing, the employer is enjoined to allow them to eat of whatever they are working on, as it is written: &#x201C;When you enter your neighbor&#x2019;s vineyard, you may eat as many of his grapes as you wish &#x2026; When you go through your neighbor&#x2019;s grainfield, you may pluck some of the ears with your hand&#x2026;&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 23:25-26). Traditionally interpreted, this verse refers only to a hired worker. If he was not hired, who permitted him to enter the vineyard or the grainfield of his neighbor without the latter&#x2019;s consent? Hence, Scripture means to say: if you enter the owner&#x2019;s domain for work, you may eat.</p>
<p>2. What difference is there between one who is working on something that is detached from the soil and one who is working on something that is still attached to the soil? The man who is working at a fruit already plucked may partake of it until it has been completely processed, and is forbidden to partake of it after it has been completely processed; but the one who is working at something that is still attached to the soil, such as a gatherer of grapes or a reaper, may partake of it only after he has completed his work. If, for example, the hired worker gathered the grapes, filled the basket, shook it out into another place, came back and filled the basket with more grapes that he gathered, he might not partake of the grapes until he filled all the baskets.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>14. If a man, working together with his wife, children and servants, stipulated with the employer that none of them should partake of what they were working on, they must not eat of it. This rule applies only to adults who, being sensible, are fully aware that they have renounced their privilege to eat; but as to minors, one may not stipulate that they shall not eat, because what they eat neither belongs to their father nor to their master; it belongs to God.</p>
<h1>Chapter Thirteen</h1>
<p>7. Just as the employer is warned against robbing the wage of the poor workman, and against delaying it, so is the poor workman warned against robbing the employer by idling away his time on the job, a little here and a little there, thus wasting the entire day deceitfully. He must be scrupulous throughout the time of work. Also, he is required to work to the best of his ability, as the upright Jacob said: &#x201C;I have served your father with all my strength&#x201D; (Genesis 31:6). For this reason, he was rewarded even in this world, as it is written: &#x201C;The man became exceedingly rich&#x201D; (30:43).</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>BORROWING AND DEPOSITING</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. If a man borrowed implements, or an animal or any movables, from another person, and the thing borrowed was lost or stolen, even if subjected to a major accident, as in the case of an animal that was injured or captured or it died, he must make full restitution, as it is written: &#x201C;When a man borrows [an animal] from another and it is injured or dies, its owner not being with it, he must make full restitution&#x201D; (Exodus 22:13). This applies only when the accident happened while the animal was not at work ; if, however, a man borrowed an animal from another to plough with it and it died while ploughing, he is free from liability. But he is held liable if it died before or after the ploughing ; or if, instead of ploughing with it, he rode on it or threshed grain with it, and it died during the threshing or riding. And so it is in all similar cases.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>5. If a man borrowed an instrument or an animal from another for an indefinite period, the lender may demand its return at any time he pleases. If he borrowed the object for a definite period, once he acquired a right to it by drawing it [to himself], the owner cannot demand its return until the end of the borrowing term. &#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>6. If a man borrowed from another an implement with which to do a certain piece of work, the lender cannot demand its return until the borrower has completed that particular work. So too, if one borrowed an animal to take him to a certain place, the lender cannot demand its return until the borrower has gone to that place and returned from it.</p>
<h1>Chapter Four</h1>
<p>1. If a man deposited anything with another gratuitously and it was stolen or lost, the bailee takes an oath and is released from liability, as it is written: &#x201C;When a man gives money or any article to another for safekeeping and it is stolen from the man&#x2019;s house &#x2026; the owner of the house shall depose before the judges that he has not laid hands on his neighbor&#x2019;s property&#x201D; (Exodus 22:6-7). An additional oath is imposed on him : that it was not his fault but he took normal care of it, after the manner of bailees, and made no use of it before it was stolen. If the bailee had made use of the deposit before it was stolen, he is held responsible for it.</p>
<p>2. Since Scripture has acquitted a gratuitous guardian in the case of theft, it stands to reason that he is all the more free from liability in the case of such major accidents as injury, capture or death of an animal, provided that he did not make use of the object deposited; if he did, he is held responsible in the case of accidents. What is the normal manner of bailees? It is all according to the deposit. There is a deposit that is placed at the gate-house for safekeeping; for example, beams and stones; there is a type of deposit that is put in the courtyard for safekeeping; for example, large bundles of flax and the like; another type of deposit is placed in the house for safekeeping; for example, a garment or a cloak; still another type of deposit is put in a box or a chest and locked for safekeeping; for example, silk garments and silver or gold objects, and the like.</p>
<p>3. If a bailee put the deposit in an unsuitable place, and it was stolen from there or lost, even if a major accident befell it, as where a fire broke out and the entire house was burned down, he is charged with negligence and must make restitution. Even if the bailee put the deposit together with his own belongings, [the rule is that] if the place was suitable for safekeeping, he is free from liability; if the place was not suitable for safekeeping, he is liable. He is permitted to be careless with his own property, and not with the property of others.</p>
<h1>Chapter Five</h1>
<p>2. If a man deposited money or valuable objects with another, and thieves came upon the bailee who forestalled them and gave them the deposit in order to save himself, he is held responsible if he was reputed to be a man of wealth, since the presumption is that the thieves came because of him, and that he saved himself with the other&#x2019;s money. But if he was not considered wealthy, the presumption is that they came only for the deposit, and he is free from responsibility. This applies to all similar cases.</p>
<h1>Chapter Eight</h1>
<p>1. If a man left an animal or implements with another for safekeeping and they were stolen or lost, and the bailee said: &#x201C;I will rather make restitution than take an oath,&#x201D; and then the thief was found, the thief must make twofold restitution, and if he had slaughtered or sold the animal he must make fourfold or fivefold restitution to the bailee who had agreed to pay [rather than take an oath].&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. A gratuitous guardian who said <italic>it was my fault</italic> is entitled to the double payment, since he obligated himself to pay when he could have said <italic>it was stolen or lost</italic> and been free from liability. So too, a paid guardian or a hirer who said <italic>it was stolen</italic> is entitled to the double payment, since he obligated himself to pay when he could have said <italic>the animal died</italic> and been released from liability. The borrower, however, is not entitled to the double payment unless he has actually paid voluntarily. If he had paid before the thief was discovered, the latter must make the fourfold or fivefold restitution to the borrower.</p>
<p>3. Whoever is entitled to the double payment is entitled to the spontaneous increase in value. If, for example, a man deposited four measures of grain with another when they were worth one <italic>sela</italic> and they were stolen or lost, and the bailee said <italic>I will rather pay a sela than take an oath</italic>, and then they were discovered and found to be worth four <italic>selas</italic>, they belong to the bailee, and he pays only one <italic>sela</italic> to the owner.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>CREDITOR AND DEBTOR</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. It is a biblical positive command to lend to Israelite poor people, as it is written: &#x201C;If you lend money to my people, to the poor among you&#x201D; (Exodus 22:24).&#x2014; &#x2014; This precept is greater than giving charity to a poor man who asks for it, since the one is already in need of begging while the other has not yet reached that stage. The Torah is strict with a person who refrains from lending to the poor, as it is written: &#x201C;Beware lest &#x2026; you grudge help to your needy brother&#x2026;&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 15:9).</p>
<p>2. Anyone who acts as a creditor toward the poor, when he knows that the debtor has nothing to repay, breaks a prohibitive command, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall not act like an extortioner toward him&#x201D; (Exodus 22:24).&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>3. One is forbidden to show himself to his debtor, or even to pass in front of him, when he knows that the debtor has no money to repay, lest he might frighten or embarrass him, although he makes no demand upon him, and needless to say if he does demand payment. Just as the creditor is forbidden to demand payment, so is the debtor forbidden to detain the creditor&#x2019;s money in his possession and to say to him <italic>go and come again</italic>, provided he has the money, as it is written: &#x201C;Do not say to your neighbor: Go, and come again&#x201D; (Proverbs 3:28). So too, the debtor is forbidden to borrow money and spend it for no purpose or waste it, so that the creditor will find nothing to collect, even if the creditor is very rich. Anyone who acts in this manner is evil, as it is written: &#x201C;The godless never pays back what he borrows&#x201D; (Psalm 38:21). The sages have enjoined: &#x201C;Let your friend&#x2019;s property be as precious to you as your own&#x201D; (Avoth 2:17).</p>
<h1>Chapter Four</h1>
<p>1. The Hebrew terms <italic>neshekh</italic> and <italic>marbith</italic> (usury and interest) are one and the same thing, as it is written: &#x201C;Do not lend him your money at advance interest, do not give him your food at accrued interest&#x201D; (Leviticus 25:37). Thereafter the Torah says: &#x201C;You shall not deduct interest from loans to your brother, whether in money or food or anything else that can be deducted as interest&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 23:20). Why is it called <italic>neshekh</italic> (biting)? Because the usurer bites, inflicting pain to another person and eating his flesh. Why has Scripture used two different terms for interest? So that the usurer should be punished for transgressing two prohibitive commands.</p>
<p>2. Just as it is forbidden to lend money on interest, so is it forbidden to borrow on interest, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall not cause your brother to bite&#x201D; (20), which is traditionally interpreted as a warning to the borrower, namely: do not let yourself be bitten by your brother.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Fifteen</h1>
<p>1. If a man lent money to another in the presence of witnesses and told him: &#x201C;Pay me only in the presence of witnesses,&#x201D; the borrower must pay him in the presence of witnesses on account of the stipulation, whether the lender told him so at the time he made the loan or thereafter. If the borrower claimed, saying to him: &#x201C;I did what you told me and paid you in the presence of so-and-so who have gone overseas or died,&#x201D; he is believed, and he takes an exemption oath and is released.&#x2014; &#x2014; If, however, he told him: &#x201C;Pay me only in the presence of so-and-so,&#x201D; and the borrower said: &#x201C;I paid you in the presence of others who have died or have gone overseas,&#x201D; he is not believed. It was to forestall such a plea that the lender stipulated with the borrower, saying to him: &#x201C;Pay me only in the presence of Reuben and Simeon,&#x201D; who were staying with him in the same place, so that the borrower should not dismiss him by claiming: &#x201C;I have paid in the presence of others who are gone.&#x201D;</p>
<p>2. There are talumdic texts in which it is written: &#x201C;If a man said to another <italic>pay me only in the presence of witnesses</italic>, and the borrower then claimed <italic>I have paid you in the presence of so-and-so who have gone overseas</italic>, he is not believed.&#x201D; This is a scribal error. Those who have given a decision in accordance with those texts have been in error. I have examined the old texts and found therein that he is believed. In Egypt, I have obtained a fragment of an old text of the Talmud written on parchment, upon which they used to write some five hundred years ago, and I have found this <italic>halakhah</italic> (rule) written on two specimens of parchment as follows: &#x201C;If he said <italic>I have paid in the presence of so-and-so who have gone overseas</italic>, he is believed.&#x201D; Because of this error, which has occurred in some texts, some Geonim have taught that if he told him <italic>pay me only in the presence of so-and-so</italic>, and he paid him in the presence of others, he is not believed even if he has produced the witnesses in whose presence he paid him. This too is a serious error. The true law is that if witnesses came and testified that the borrower had paid the lender in their presence, the borrower is released; and there is no room here for any doubt.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>3. If the lender stipulated with the borrower that he should be believed at any time he might say that the latter has not paid him, he collects what he claims without an oath, even though the borrower pleads that he has paid him. But if the borrower produced witnesses of payment, the lender collects nothing.</p>
<p>5. If the borrower paid the debt and the lender claimed that he had not been paid, and the borrower paid him a second time because of the stipulation, the borrower may sue the lender, telling him: &#x201C;You owe me such an amount because I have paid you twice.&#x201D; If the lender has admitted, he must pay back the extra amount ; if he has denied, he must take an exemption oath to the effect that the borrower paid him only once. The same applies to all similar cases.</p>
<h1>Chapter Eighteen</h1>
<p>1. If a man lent money to another vaguely (without express terms), all the debtor&#x2019;s estate serves as security for the loan. Accordingly, when the creditor comes to collect the debt, he sues the debtor first. If he has found property in his possession, whether movables or real estate, he collects out of these with the debtor&#x2019;s consent; and if the debtor has refused to give his consent, the court compels him to pay. If the debtor&#x2019;s available property has been insufficient to cover the amount of the promissory note, the creditor may collect out of all the landed property which belonged to the debtor previously, even though it has been sold, or transferred in the form of a gift to others. The creditor may evict the buyers or the donees, since the debtor sold the property, or transferred it in the form of a gift to others, after he had become obligated for the debt. A creditor seizing the property which has been sold by the debtor is called in Hebrew <italic>toref</italic> (seizor, one who seizes). This applies only to landed property owned by the debtor at the time he borrowed the money ; but property which he acquired after he had borrowed the money has not been mortgaged to the creditor, and he may not seize it. If, however, the creditor stipulated that all the property which the debtor should ever acquire should serve as mortgage for the payment of the debt, and the debtor acquired property after he had taken the loan and then sold it, or transferred it in the form of a gift, the creditor may seize it.</p>
<p>2. All this applies only to landed property, but movables do not serve as security.&#x2014; &#x2014; If, however, the debtor conveyed a security title to all his movables in conjunction with such title to his land, the creditor may seize such movables. &#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Twenty</h1>
<p>1. If a man has many debts, the creditor whose loan was advanced first collects first whether from the property of the debtor himself or from the purchasers. If a creditor who is next in time hastened to collect first, the court takes it back from him, because the lender who is prior in time is prior in right. This rule applies only to landed property which the debtor owned at the time he took the loan ; however, the law of priority does not apply with respect to property which the debtor acquired after he had borrowed from many creditors, even if he did write in the note which he gave to each creditor: &#x201C;What I will acquire is mortgaged to you.&#x201D; All such creditors are equal, and if one of them collected first, he was entitled to do so, even if he was the last one.</p>
<p>2. &#x2014; &#x2014; The law of priority does not exist with respect to movables, but whoever hastened to collect from them was entitled to it, even if he was the last. If a non-creditor seized some of the debtor&#x2019;s movables to obtain title on behalf of one of the creditors, the latter has not acquired title, because anyone who seizes movables on behalf of a creditor where there is another debt outstanding against the debtor does not acquire title on behalf of such a creditor. But if there is no other debt outstanding against the debtor, he does acquire title on the creditor&#x2019;s behalf.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>PLAINTIFF AND DEFENDANT</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. If a man sues another concerning movables and the other admits that he owes a portion of the goods claimed, he must pay what he admits and take a biblical oath about the balance, as it is written: &#x201C;Where one claims that the thing is his, both parties shall present their case before the judges&#x201D; (Exodus 22:8). So too, if the defendant denies everything and says: &#x201C;It never happened,&#x201D; and one witness testifies that it did, he must take a biblical oath. It has been traditionally inferred that wherever the testimony of two witnesses subjects a party to payment liability, the testimony of one witness subjects him to taking an oath.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. None but the following three is required to take a biblical oath: 1) one who admits that he owes a portion of the movables claimed ; 2) one against whom a single witness testifies that he owes money; 3) the bailee. &#x2014; &#x2014; Every one of these three takes an oath and is released from payment. But all those who take an oath and collect &#x2014; &#x2014; do so only by virtue of a rabbinic ordinance. All these oaths, though taken on rabbinic grounds, resemble the biblical oaths and are administered while holding a sacred object.</p>
<p>3. If a man lodged a claim against another concerning movables and the defendant denied the entire claim and said <italic>it is absolutely untrue</italic>, or if he admitted the claim in part and immediately handed it to him, saying: &#x201C;This is all you have on me, take it,&#x201D; or if the defendant said: &#x201C;It is true that you have had a claim on me, but you have remitted it to me,&#x201D; or &#x201C;you have presented it to me,&#x201D; &#x2014; &#x2014; in all such cases the defendant is exempt from a biblical oath, but the sages of the Talmud ordained that the defendant should take an exemption oath and be released. This oath is unlike the biblical oath, since it is administered without holding a sacred object. We have already explained, in the section concerning oaths, how the biblical oath and the exemption oath are administered.</p>
<p>6. Anyone who is required to take an exemption oath may shift it to the plaintiff, if he so desires, so that the plaintiff swears and collects from the defendant. This is the only case where the plaintiff collects from the defendant by taking the exemption oath which has been shifted to him by the defendant. Only an exemption oath can be so shifted; but a biblical oath, or a rabbinic oath that is quasi-biblical cannot be shifted.</p>
<p>7. An exemption oath is imposed only in the case of a certainty claim; if the claim is based on doubt, the defendant is exempt from such an oath. If, for example, the plaintiff says: &#x201C;It seems to me that you owe me one hundred <italic>zuz</italic>,&#x201D; or if he says: &#x201C;I lent you one hundred <italic>zuz</italic>, and it seems to me that you have not repaid me&#x201D; &#x2014; &#x2014; and the defendant says: &#x201C;I owe you nothing,&#x201D; he is free from taking even an exemption oath. The same applies to all similar cases.</p>
<h1>Chapter Six</h1>
<p>1. If litigants came into the law court, and one of them said: &#x201C;I have a claim on this man for one hundred <italic>zuz</italic> which I lent him, deposited with him, he stole from me, he owes me in wages,&#x201D; and the like, and the defendant replied: &#x201C;I owe you nothing, you have no claim on me, you are making a false claim,&#x201D; it is not a correct answer. The court will say to him: &#x201C;Refute his claim, and be specific in your reply as he was in his claim. State whether you did or did not borrow money from him, whether he did or did not deposit with you, whether you did or did not rob him, whether you did or did not hire him. And so with other claims.<br/>Why does not the court accept a reply that is not specific? For fear that the defendant is in error and might unwittingly swear falsely; for it is possible that the plaintiff lent money to the defendant, as he claims, and that the defendant paid the debt to the plaintiff&#x2019;s son or wife, or presented him with a gift equivalent to the debt, and he imagines that he has thereby been released from the debt. He is therefore told by the court: &#x201C;How can you say <italic>I owe him nothing</italic> when you may be lawfully required to make restitution without your being aware of it? Inform the judges precisely what you mean, and they will let you know whether or not you owe anything. Even if the defendant is a great scholar, he is told: &#x201C;You will lose nothing by replying to the plaintiff&#x2019;s claim and informing us as to why you do not owe him anything, whether because his claim is absolutely untrue or because you have repaid what you owed.&#x2014; &#x2014;<br/>If the plaintiff lodged a claim against the defendant for one hundred <italic>zuz</italic> that he had lent him, and the defendant answered him <italic>it is absolutely untrue</italic>, and the plaintiff produced witnesses thereafter who testified that he had lent him the money in their presence, whereupon the defendant retracted and said : &#x201C;It was indeed so, but I borrowed and repaid,&#x201D; we should lend no attention to him; he is considered a liar, and must make restitution. If, however, he answered: &#x201C;I do not owe,&#x201D; or &#x201C;you have no claim on me,&#x201D; or &#x201C;you are making a false claim,&#x201D; and the like, and the plaintiff produced witnesses thereafter that he had lent him in their presence, while the defendant said: &#x201C;Yes indeed, it was so, but I have returned his deposit,&#x201D; or &#x201C;I have repaid what I owed him,&#x201D; he is not considered a liar; he takes an exemption oath and is released.</p>
<p>2. If witnesses saw a man count money and give it to another, but they did not know what the money was for, and then the first man lodged a claim against the other, demanding: &#x201C;Give me the money I lent you,&#x201D; and the second man said: &#x201C;You gave me the money as a gift,&#x201D; or &#x201C;in payment of a debt,&#x201D; he is believed ; he takes an exemption oath and is released. If, however, the defendant said <italic>it is absolutely untrue</italic>, and then witnesses appeared and testified that the plaintiff had counted the money and given it to the defendant in their presence, the defendant is deemed a liar. A man is never deemed dishonest unless he makes a denial in court and two witnesses come and contradict his denial.</p>
<h1>Chapter Eight</h1>
<p>1. All movable goods are presumed to be the property of the person in whose possession they are, even though the plaintiff has produced witnesses that those movables are known to be his. If, for example, the plaintiff says: &#x201C;This garment, or this instrument which you have in your hand, or in your house, is mine, or I deposited it with you, or I lent it to you, and here are witnesses who know that it was previously in my possession,&#x201D; while the defendant says: &#x201C;It is not so; you have sold it to me, or presented it to me as a gift,&#x201D; the defendant takes an exemption oath and is released.</p>
<p>3. This applies only in regard to things that are not likely to be lent or rented out, such as garments, farm products, household utensils, merchandise, and the like. But things that are likely to be lent or rented out are presumed to be the property of the original owner, even though they are in the possession of the defendant, and even though the plaintiff did not lend or rent out the object in the presence of witnesses. If, for example, Reuben owned an instrument that was likely to be lent or rented out ; he has witnesses that it was known to be his ; the instrument is now in the possession of Simeon; Reuben claims that it was lent or rented, while Simeon claims: &#x201C;You have sold it to me, you have presented it to me as a gift, you have left it with me as a pledge,&#x201D; he is not believed. Reuben takes an exemption oath to offset Simeon&#x2019;s claim and recovers his instrument. Even if Simeon died, Reuben recovers the instrument. But the Geonim have taught that Reuben must take an exemption oath, because the court pleads for the heir.</p>
<p>9. Do not be confused, as many great men were, concerning the difference between things that are likely to be lent or rented out and things that are usually lent or rented out. Indeed, all things are suitable to be lent or rented out; even a man&#x2019;s undershirt, his mattress and bed are fit to be lent. But things that are likely to be lent or rented out are those instruments which the residents of a particular town produce primarily for the purpose of lending or renting them and receiving a fee for them. They are to the owner like landed property, the products of which he enjoys while the principal remains. These utensils, too, are made essentially for the purpose of enjoying the fee they bring, as in the case of the large copper kettles which are used for cooking at banquet halls, or the [gilded] copper ornament which is rented out to a bride for adornment. These objects are not made for sale or for use by the owner in his home, but for the purpose of lending them to others in order to receive in return an equivalent benefit, or renting them out and receiving a fee for their use.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>10. &#x2014; &#x2014; This is an essential legal principle. It is sensible and should be relied upon in judging. It is clear to those who find knowledge, and the judge should duly place it before his eyes, so that he may not depart from the truth.</p>
<h1>Chapter Eleven</h1>
<p>1. All landed property known to belong to a certain owner is presumed to be the property of that owner, even though it is now in the possession of others. If, for example, Reuben was using a courtyard in the manner people use their courtyards: he lived in it or leased it to others, or built and tore down. But after some time Simeon came and lodged a claim against him, saying to him: &#x201C;This courtyard which is in your possession is mine; it is merely rented, or lent, to you.&#x201D; Whereupon Reuben answered him: &#x201C;It was yours and you sold it to me,&#x201D; or &#x201C;you presented it to me as a gift.&#x201D; If Simeon has no witnesses that the courtyard was known to have been his, Reuben takes an exemption oath and remains where he is; if, however, Simeon produced witnesses testifying that this courtyard was his, it is presumed to be the property of Simeon, and the court tells Reuben: &#x201C;Produce evidence that he has sold it to you or presented it to you.&#x201D; If he has not produced evidence, we evict him from the property and seize it for Simeon, even though Reuben does not admit that it was Simeon&#x2019;s; indeed, Simeon has witnesses to that effect.</p>
<p>2. What has just been stated, that we make it necessary for Reuben to produce evidence or else he is evicted from the property, applies only in case he has not been using the property for a long time. If, however, he has produced witnesses that he has enjoyed the produce of the land for three years in succession, and derived as much benefit from the whole of it as every person would from that type of land, provided the original owner could know that another took possession of it and he entered no protest, we let it remain in the possession of Reuben who takes an exemption oath that Simeon sold or presented it to him, and he is released. Because we say to Simeon: &#x201C;If what you claim is true, namely that you have neither sold it nor given it away, why have you not protested when this man has made use of your land year after year without your having a rent note or a mortgage note?&#x201D; If he put forth a claim, saying: &#x201C;Because I was in a distant country, the information failed to reach me,&#x201D; we say to him: &#x201C;It is impossible that the information should not have reached you in the course of three years, and when it reached you, you should have entered a protest in the presence of witnesses, telling them : So-and-so has robbed me ; I will sue him at law tomorrow. Since you have not protested, you have occasioned your own loss.&#x201D; Accordingly, if it was a time of war, or a dangerous road between the locality where Reuben was and the locality where Simeon was, the property is taken away from Reuben and restored to Simeon, even if Reuben enjoyed its produce for ten years, because Simeon may say : &#x201C;I was unaware that he was using my land.&#x201D;</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>INHERITANCE</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. Following is the order of legal heirs: If a man died, his children are his heirs; they have priority over anyone else; the males have priority over the females.</p>
<p>2. A female does not share an inheritance with a male. If a man died without leaving children, his father inherits his property; the mother does not inherit from her children. This rule is based upon tradition.</p>
<p>3. Whoever has priority in the order of heirs, his descendants have priority likewise. Accordingly, if anyone died, man or woman, leaving a son, he inherits everything. If there is no son living, we look carefully into the son&#x2019;s descendants, males or females ; even the son&#x2019;s daughter&#x2019;s daughter&#x2019;s daughter, to the end of the line, shall inherit everything. If the son left no descendants, we resort to the daughter, who inherits everything. If there is no daughter living, we look to the daughter&#x2019;s descendants, males or females, to the end of the line, who shall inherit everything. If his daughter left no offspring, the inheritance returns to his father. If his father is not living, we look to the father&#x2019;s offspring, being the brothers of the deceased. If he had a brother, or the descendant of a brother, he shall inherit everything; if not, we resort to the sister. If the deceased had a sister living, or her children, they shall inherit everything.&#x2014; &#x2014; In this manner the inheritance keeps ascending to the beginning of the generations. Accordingly, there is no man in Israel without an heir.</p>
<h1>Chapter Two</h1>
<p>1. The firstborn son receives a double share of his father&#x2019;s estate, as it is written: &#x201C;To give him a double portion&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 21:17).&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. The firstborn son who was born after his father&#x2019;s death does not receive a double share of his father&#x2019;s estate, as it is written: &#x201C;When he wills his property to his sons &#x2026; he must recognize as his firstborn the son of the unloved one&#x201D; (16-17).&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>8. The firstborn does not receive a double share of his mother&#x2019;s estate. A firstborn and a plain brother, for example, share equally their mother&#x2019;s estate ; it makes no difference whether he is a firstborn [from the side of his father] with the privilege of a double share or a firstling [from the side of his mother].</p>
<p>9. A firstborn with the privilege of a double share is the first son of his father, as it is written: &#x201C;Since he is the first fruit of his vigor&#x201D; (17). We disregard the mother: even if she previously gave birth to several children, the firstborn from the side of his father inherits a double share.</p>
<h1>Chapter Three</h1>
<p>1. The firstborn does not receive a double share of the property that is due to his father posthumously, but only of property held in the possession of his father, as it is written: &#x201C;Of whatever he happens to own&#x201D; (17).&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>SANHEDRIN</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>2. Only in Eretz Yisrael are we required to set up courts of law in every district and every city, &#x2014; &#x2014; as it is written: &#x201C;You shall appoint judges &#x2026; for your tribes in all the cities that the Lord your God is giving you&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 16:18).</p>
<p>3. How many regular courts of law are to be in Israel, and how many members should each include? To begin with, a supreme court named <italic>Great Sanhedrin</italic> is established in the Temple; it consists of seventy-one members, as it is written: &#x201C;Gather for me seventy of the elders of Israel,&#x201D; presided over by Moses, as it is written: &#x201C;Let them present themselves beside you&#x201D; Numbers 11:16-17), thus totaling seventy-one. The greatest sage among them all is appointed their presiding officer, who also serves as head of the academy. He is designated by the sages as <italic>Nasi</italic> (president), who occupies the position of our teacher Moses. The most eminent member of the seventy is placed second in rank and is seated to the right of the <italic>Nasi.</italic> He is referred to as <italic>Av-beth-din</italic> (tribunal chairman). The rest of the seventy are seated in front of both, according to their distinction : the greater in knowledge, the closer he is placed to the left of the <italic>Nasi.</italic> They sit in the form of a semicircle, so that the <italic>Nasi</italic> and the <italic>Av-beth-din</italic> may see all of them.<br/>Two other tribunals, each consisting of twenty-three members, are set up [next to the Great Sanhedrin], one at the entrance of the Temple Court and the other at the entrance of the Temple Mount. Besides, a Small Sanhedrin is set up in every town of Israel with a population of one hundred and twenty or more, and is to meet at the gate of the town, as it is written: &#x201C;Let justice prevail at the gate&#x201D; (Amos 5:15). How many members make up the Small Sanhedrin? Twenty-three judges. The most learned man among them presides over them; the rest are seated in the form of a semicircular threshing floor, so that the presiding judge may see all of them.</p>
<p>4. If a town has less than one hundred and twenty residents, three judges are appointed there, since no court can be sustained by less than three, sufficient to form a majority and a minority if there is a dispute among them about a point of law.</p>
<p>5. Any town that does not have two eminent scholars, one competent to teach the entire Torah and the other competent to comprehend and discuss, is not entitled to have a Sanhedrin established inside it, even if its population consists of thousands of Israelites.</p>
<p>7. Three rows of scholars are seated in front of every Small Sanhedrin, each row numbering twenty-three. The first row is near the Sanhedrin; the second row is behind the first, and the third row is behind the second. They are seated in each row according to their distinction in scholarship.</p>
<p>8. If the members of the Sanhedrin dispute about something and must ordain a new member to increase their number, they ordain the outstanding scholar of the first row. Thereupon the first in the second row takes the last seat in the first row, and the first in the third row takes the last seat in the second. Then they choose a new member out of the rest of the community to occupy the last seat in the third row. The same procedure is followed if they must ordain a second or a third additional member.</p>
<p>9. Wherever there is a Sanhedrin, two legal clerks stand before the judges, one to the right and the other to the left; one records the words of those who favor conviction, and the other the words of those who favor acquittal.</p>
<p>10. Why is a Sanhedrin set up only in a town that has a population of one hundred and twenty or more? The population must be sufficiently large to provide twenty-three judges, three rows comprising sixty-nine alternates, ten men of leisure for the synagogue (<italic>minyan</italic>), two clerks, two sheriffs, two litigants, two witnesses, two men to refute a testimony, two men to rebut those who refute, two charity collectors, plus one to constitute a minimum of three for the distribution of charity, a competent surgeon, a scribe, an elementary teacher; thus totaling one hundred and twenty.</p>
<h1>Chapter Two</h1>
<p>1. Only wise and intelligent men, who are eminent in Torah scholarship and possess extensive knowledge, should be appointed members of either the Great or the Small Sanhedrin. They should be somewhat aware of such branches as medicine, mathematics, astronomy, forecasting constellations, astrology, methods of soothsayers, augurs and wizards as well as idolatrous superstitions, and the like, in order to be competent in dealing with them.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>3. A man who is advanced in years &#x2014; &#x2014; or one who is childless must not be appointed member of any Sanhedrin, since he is required to be compassionate.</p>
<p>4. A king of Israel must not be seated among the Sanhedrin, since it is unlawful to disagree with him or to defy him. But a high priest may be given a seat on the Sanhedrin, provided he is well qualified in terms of wisdom.</p>
<p>6. Just as the members of a court of law must be cleared with respect to uprightness, so must they be clear of any physical defect. Every effort should be exerted in an intensive search for sufficiently mature candidates, who are tall and handsome, easily articulate and conversant with most of the spoken tongues, so that the Sanhedrin may dispense with an interpreter.</p>
<p>7. Although we do not insist upon all these requirements in the case of a court-of-three, nevertheless it is desirable that each of the three should be endowed with the following qualifications: wisdom, humility, reverence, disdain of gain, love of truth, loved by fellow men, and of a good reputation.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>8. The sages have reported that the supreme court used to send agents throughout Eretz Yisrael to examine candidates for the office of judge. Whoever was found to be wise, sin-fearing, humble, contrite, respectful and well-liked by people, was made judge in his town; from the local court he was promoted to the court situated at the entrance of the Temple Mount; from there he was promoted to the court situated at the entrance of the Temple Court; and from there he was promoted to the supreme court.</p>
<p>11. If one is publicly regarded as well-qualified, or if he received permission, from the court, he is permitted to try cases alone ; and yet he is not considered a full-fledged court. Though he is permitted to act as sole judge, the sages have enjoined him to associate others with himself. They have declared: &#x201C;Do not judge alone, for none may judge alone except One&#x201D; (Avoth 4:8).</p>
<p>12. One may take the law into his own hands, if he has the power to do so. Since he acts according to the law, he is not obligated to take the trouble of coming to court, even if no material loss would result if he were to postpone action and come to court. Accordingly, if his legal opponent has protested and taken him to court, and after careful investigation it has been found that the defendant has acted lawfully on his own behalf, his own verdict is not nullified.</p>
<p>14. A scholarly person must not sit down in judgment unless he knows the persons with whom he is to sit, for fear that he might associate with unworthy men and be included in a band of renegades instead of a court of law.</p>
<h1>Chapter Three</h1>
<p>2. The supreme court of seventy-one is not required to be in plenary session at their sanctuary place constantly. They all convene only when necessary ; at other times, anyone who has some business to attend leaves to take care of it and then returns, provided that during the session period no less than a quorum of twenty-three is always present. If one of them has to leave, he looks around to make sure that twenty-three members remain without him ; if not, he must not leave before another one comes in.</p>
<p>7. The Divine Presence is always to be found in the midst of a just Jewish tribunal. For this reason, the judges should sit in a serious frame of mind and dressed properly. They are forbidden to behave frivolously, to jest or engage in idle talk; they should discuss only topics of Torah and wisdom.</p>
<p>8. If a Sanhedrin, or king or exilarch, appointed an unworthy judge in a Jewish community, who is not sufficiently versed in the lore of the Torah and qualified to be a judge, though he is otherwise altogether lovable and possesses fine qualities, the one responsible for his appointment has broken a prohibitive commandment, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall not be partial in judgment&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 1:17). This verse has been traditionally interpreted to refer to one who is in charge of appointing judges. The sages have declared that if you say: &#x201C;I will appoint a certain individual to serve as judge because he is handsome &#x2026; because he is a hero &#x2026; because he is my relative &#x2026; because he is a linguist,&#x201D; the result will be that he will acquit the guilty and condemn the innocent, not because he is evil but because he is lacking in knowledge. It is therefore written: You shall not be partial in judgment&#x201D; (Sifr&#x00E9;).&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>9. It is forbidden to rise before a judge who has paid money to be appointed. The sages tell us to look upon him with utter contempt.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>10. This was the manner of the ancient sages : they shunned being appointed ; they made many straining efforts to avoid sitting in judgment, unless they knew that there was none as qualified for the office as they, and that if they refrained to serve, the line of justice might be upset. Nevertheless, they would not act as judges unless the people and the elders exerted pressure upon them to do so.</p>
<h1>Chapter Four</h1>
<p>1. In order to act as a judge in the supreme court or in a Small Sanhedrin or in a court-of-three, one must be ordained by someone who has been ordained. Our teacher Moses ordained Joshua by placing his hands upon him, as it is written: &#x201C;He laid his hands on him and commissioned him&#x201D; (Numbers 27:23). He also ordained the seventy elders, and the Divine Presence rested upon them. The elders ordained others, who in turn ordained others.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. What has been the manner of ordination in the course of generations? They have not placed their hands upon the head of the elder, but conferred upon him the title <italic>Rabbi</italic>, saying to him: &#x201C;You are ordained and authorized to sit in judgment even on cases dealing with fines.&#x201D;</p>
<p>4. A court cannot be referred to as <italic>Elohim</italic> unless its members have been ordained exclusively in Eretz Yisrael; they are the wise men, qualified to sit in judgment, who have been examined in the court of Eretz Yisrael, where they have been ordained and appointed to judgeship.</p>
<p>5. Originally, every ordained teacher would ordain his own students. As a mark of honor to the house of Hillel the Elder, however, the sages later enacted that no person could be ordained without the authorization of the <italic>Nasi</italic>, and that the <italic>Nasi</italic> was to ordain only in the presence of the <italic>Av-beth-din;</italic> the <italic>Av-beth-din</italic>, in turn, was to ordain only in the presence of the <italic>Nasi.</italic> Each member of the college was authorized to ordain by permission of the <italic>Nasi</italic>, provided that he was joined by two men, since the ordination ceremony must be performed in the presence of no fewer than three.</p>
<p>6. No scholars may be ordained outside Eretz Yisrael, even though the ordainers have been ordained in Eretz Yisrael. Even if the ordainers are in Eretz Yisrael, and the man to be ordained is outside the country, they cannot ordain him. Needless to say that this applies to a case where the ordainers are outside Eretz Yisrael, and those to be ordained are inside the land. If both are in Eretz Yisrael, ordination may be conferred upon the candidate, even if they do not reside in the same place, in which case they inform him by a messenger or in writing that he is ordained; and he is thus granted authorization to conduct lawsuits involving fines. It is because both ordainer and ordained are inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael. Every part of Eretz Yisrael that was occupied by the Israelites who came up from Egypt is qualified for the performance of ordination ceremonies.</p>
<p>7. Ordainers may ordain even one hundred candidates at one time.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>12. Court members who were ordained in Eretz Yisrael and then went abroad are qualified to try penalty cases even there, just as they are qualified in Eretz Yisrael, since the Sanhedrin may conduct its office within Eretz Yisrael or outside Eretz Yisrael, if only its members have been ordained.</p>
<p>13. The Babylonian exilarchs take the place of a king; they may govern and sit in judgment over Israel anywhere, whether the latter wish it or not, as it is written: &#x201C;The scepter shall not depart from Judah&#x201D; (Genesis 49:10) ; this alludes to the Babylonian exilarchs [members of the tribe of Judah].</p>
<p>14. Hence, any competent judge who has been permitted by the exilarch to act as judge has the right to function as such everywhere, within Eretz Yisrael or outside Eretz Yisrael, even if the litigants do not consent, even though he is not qualified to try penalty cases.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>15. If a man who is not qualified to act as judge, because he lacks knowledge or is unworthy, has been wrongly authorized by the exilarch or the court, the authorization avails him nothing; for, if a man dedicated a blemished animal for the altar [in Temple times], the consecration did not take effect.</p>
<h1>Chapter Five</h1>
<p>1. A king can be appointed only with the consent of the supreme court of seventy-one. A Small Sanhedrin for every tribe and every town can be formed only with the consent of the supreme court of seventy-one.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. Capital cases cannot be tried by fewer than twenty-three, constituting a Small Sanhedrin.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>4. Three judges may try a case involving the penalty of lashing, even though the person lashed may die as a result.</p>
<p>8. Cases involving penalties, such as larceny, injuries, twofold and fourfold restitution, rape, seduction, and the like, can be tried only by three expert judges who have been ordained in Eretz Yisrael. But civil cases, such as admission of indebtedness and contraction of loans, do not require experts; even three laymen, or even one expert, may try them. Accordingly, cases of admission and contraction of loans, and the like, may be tried even outside Eretz Yisrael. Although a Diaspora court is not referred to as <italic>Elohim</italic>, it performs in the capacity of an agent for the court of Eretz Yisrael. Diaspora judges are not authorized, however, to adjudicate penalties as agents for the court of Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p>9. A Diaspora court may try only frequent cases that involve a loss of money, such as admission of indebtedness, contraction of loans, and damage done to a person&#x2019;s property.&#x2014; &#x2014; So too, Diaspora judges cannot collect any of the fines imposed by the sages in case one strikes another with a clenched fist, or slaps his face, and the like.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>13. If a man has stolen or robbed, the Diaspora judges can collect the principal, but not the additional penalty.</p>
<p>15. Cases of indirect damages are unlike penalty cases, hence they are tried and collected in the Diaspora.</p>
<p>16. So too, the Diaspora judges may sit in judgment over a person who has acted as an informer, delivering another&#x2019;s property [into the hands of persecutors], even though the informer has not committed an overt act.</p>
<p>17. The practice of the Diaspora academies has been to excommunicate the offender, though they cannot collect fines, until he finally compensates his opponent, or goes to Eretz Yisrael with him for trial.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>18. In the case of one who is publicly recognized as an experienced judge, even though he may try civil cases by himself alone, an admission made in his presence is not deemed an admission made in a court, even if he is an ordained judge. But in case of a court-of-three, even though it consists of unordained laymen, who cannot be called <italic>Elohim</italic>, an admission made before them is deemed an admission before a court of justice.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Seven</h1>
<p>1. If one of the litigants said <italic>let that man try my case</italic>, and the other said <italic>let that man try my case</italic>, the two men thus chosen, one to each litigant, jointly select a third person, and the three act as judges for both litigants, so that a correct verdict is likely to result.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Eight</h1>
<p>1. If the members of a court are divided, some voting for acquittal and others for conviction, the majority opinion is followed. This is a biblical positive command, as it is written: &#x201C;Incline after the many&#x201D; (Exodus 23:1). This applies to civil cases and to ritual laws as to what is prohibited and what is permitted, what is unclean and what is clean, and the like. But in capital cases, if there is a division of opinion whether the culprit should suffer death or not, he is acquitted if the majority is for acquittal; but if the majority is for conviction, he is put to death only when those who favor conviction exceed those who favor acquittal by at least two. According to a traditional intrepretation, this is what the Torah has meant by the warning: &#x201C;You must not follow a majority to do wrong&#x201D; (23:2); that is to say, if the majority is inclined to do wrong, to kill, do not follow it, unless it consists of a larger majority of at least two judges, as it is written: &#x201C;To incline toward a majority that can decide&#x201D; (23:2). Your verdict of acquittal is reached by the decision of a majority of one, but your verdict of condemnation must be reached by a majority of two. These interpretations are based on tradition.</p>
<p>2. If a court-of-three is divided, two finding the defendant innocent and one finding him guilty, he is declared innocent. If two find him guilty and one finds him innocent, he is declared guilty. If one says that the defendant is innocent and one says that he is guilty, while one says <italic>I do not know</italic>, two more judges are added. Thus five judges are now discussing the case. If three of them find him innocent and two find him guilty, he is declared innocent. If three find him guilty and two find him innocent, he is declared guilty. If two find him innocent and two find him guilty, while one says <italic>I do not know</italic>, two more judges are added. But if four judges find him innocent or guilty while one says <italic>I do not know</italic>, &#x2014; &#x2014; the majority opinion is followed.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>3. The judge who says <italic>I do not know</italic> is not required to give a reason for his statement or to indicate why he is in doubt, whereas the judge who favors acquittal or conviction must outline his reasons.</p>
<h1>Chapter Ten</h1>
<p>6. &#x2014; &#x2014; In capital cases, we do not begin with the opinion of the eldest judge, for fear that the others might depend on his view, considering themselves incompetent to disagree with him. Each judge should express his own preference.</p>
<p>7. Furthermore, capital cases must not begin with reasons for conviction but for acquittal. For example, the judges should say to the defendant: &#x201C;If you have not committed the thing with which you are charged by the witnesses, do not be afraid of what they say.&#x201D;</p>
<p>9. If a court gave a wrong decision in a capital case, declaring an innocent man guilty and passing sentence on him for conviction, and later discovered a reason for reversing the sentence so as to clear the accused, the decision of the court is revoked and he is tried again. If, however, the judges gave a wrong decision and acquitted one who deserved death, the decision is not revoked and he is not brought back for a new trial.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Twelve</h1>
<p>1. How is a trial held in a capital case? When witnesses appear in court, stating: &#x201C;We saw that man commit the offense,&#x201D; they are asked: &#x201C;Do you know him? Did you warn him?&#x201D; If they have said <italic>we do not know him</italic>, or <italic>we are in doubt</italic>, or if they failed to warn him, he is acquitted.</p>
<p>2. Whether the accused is scholarly or ignorant, a warning is required, inasmuch as the purpose of warning is that of distinguishing between the unwitting and the willful transgressor, since he might have committed the offense unintentionally. How should he be warned? The witnesses should say to him : &#x201C;Abstain, you must not do this; it is an offense for which you are liable to suffer death at the hands of the court of justice, or be lashed.&#x201D; If he abstained, he is free.&#x2014; &#x2014; He is liable only in case he commits the offense immediately after the warning, within as much time as is needed for an utterance. But if the interval is longer than the duration of an utterance, another warning is required.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>3. If the witnesses have said: &#x201C;The accused had due warning and we know him,&#x201D; the court admonishes them. How are the witnesses in capital cases admonished? They are told: &#x201C;Perhaps what you are about to say is based on mere conjecture or hearsay, on secondhand information, on what <italic>we have heard from a trustworthy person.</italic> Perhaps you are not aware that we will, in the course of the trial, subject you to examination and searching inquiry. You must know that capital cases are unlike non-capital cases, where a person may make restitution and redeem his guilt by money. In capital cases, the witness is accountable for the blood of the person wrongfully condemned and for the blood of his potential posterity until the end of time. Regarding Cain, it is written: &#x201C;Your brother&#x2019;s bloods cry out to me&#x201D; (Genesis 4:10); that is, his blood and the blood of his potential descendants. For this reason, Adam was created alone, to show that should anyone destroy a single life he shall be called to account as though he had destroyed a complete world; and should anyone preserve a single life, he is credited as though he had preserved a complete world. Furthermore, all men are fashioned after the pattern of the first man, yet no two faces are exactly alike. Therefore, every man may well say: For my sake the world was created.&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Even if there are a hundred witnesses, each is subjected to close examination and searching inquiry. If their evidence tallies, the discussion begins with arguments in favor of the accused, as we have explained. He is told: &#x201C;If you have committed no offense, do not be afraid of what they say.&#x201D; Then he is tried. If he is found innocent, he is set free; if he is not found innocent, he is imprisoned until the next day. The same day the members of the Sanhedrin meet in pairs to study the case. All that day, they eat but little and do not drink wine. All night, each judge keeps discussing the case with his colleague, or deliberates upon it single-handedly in his home. The following day, they come to court early in the morning. He who favors acquittal says: &#x201C;I have declared him innocent and I still declare him innocent.&#x201D; He who favors conviction says: &#x201C;I have declared him guilty and I still declare him guilty.&#x201D; Or, &#x201C;I have changed my opinion, and am now for acquittal.&#x201D; &#x2014; &#x2014; If the majority is for conviction, and the accused is pronounced guilty, he is taken out to be executed. The place of execution was far away from the court.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>4. As soon as he is convicted, he is executed on the same day, without delay.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Thirteen</h1>
<p>1. The person who is condemned to death is removed from the court.&#x2014; &#x2014; Even if he himself said thereafter: &#x201C;I have something to say in favor of my acquittal,&#x201D; though there is nothing of substance in his words, he is returned to the court once and again, since he might have come to the end of his pleas on account of fear, and upon his return to the court he might perhaps come to himself again and offer a plausible plea. If after he has been returned to court nothing substantial is found in his words, he is taken out to the place of execution a third time. If he asserted a third time that he had something to say in favor of his acquittal, he is brought back even a hundred times if there is any substance in his statement. For this reason, he is given two scholars to accompany him that they may hear what he has to say. If there is substance in his words, he is brought back; if not, he is not brought back. If nothing has been found in favor of his acquittal, he is taken out, and the witnesses execute him by the mode of death prescribed for him.&#x2014; &#x2014; If he does not know how to confess, he is told to say: &#x201C;May my death be an expiation for all my sins.&#x201D; Even if he knows that the evidence against him was false, he makes this confession.</p>
<p>2. After he has confessed, he is given a cup of wine containing a grain of frankincense to induce a loss of consciousness through intoxication. Then he is executed by the mode of death prescribed for him.</p>
<p>4. The members of the court must not come out to follow the person who has been condemned to death. Any court that has executed a person must not eat all that day. This is implied in the prohibitive command: &#x201C;You shall not eat with the blood&#x201D; (Leviticus 19:26).&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Fourteen</h1>
<p>1. The court has power to inflict four death penalties: stoning, burning, beheading, and strangling.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>4. Stoning is severer than burning; burning is severer than beheading; beheading is severer than strangling. Anyone who deserves two death penalties is punished by the severer kind of the two.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>10. The court must ponder over capital cases and be moderate; it must not be hasty. Any court that condemns a person to death in seven years is destructive. Nevertheless, it must condemn to death day after day if there are compelling circumstances. No two offenders, however, should be tried on the same day, but one today and the other the following day.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>11. Capital cases are tried only when the Temple is in existence, provided that the supreme court is in the chamber of hewn stone within the sanctuary, as it is written concerning the rebellious scholar: &#x201C;The man who acts insolently and refuses to listen to the priest who serves there the Lord your God, or the judge&#x2026;&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 17:12). Traditionally interpreted, this verse means that capital cases are tried only when there is a priest presenting offerings upon the altar, provided that the supreme court is in its proper place [in the Temple].</p>
<p>13. Forty years before the destruction of the Second Temple, capital trials ceased in Israel even when the Temple was still in existence, because the Sanhedrin went into exile and was no longer situated in its assigned place within the sanctuary.</p>
<p>14. So long as capital cases are tried in Eretz Yisrael, they are tried in the Diaspora, provided that the members of the Sanhedrin are ordained in Eretz Yisrael, as we have explained, because the Sanhedrin conducts its office both in Eretz Yisrael and the Diaspora.</p>
<h1>Chapter Sixteen</h1>
<p>4. A person is liable to lashes only when there have been witnesses and a due warning. The witnesses are subjected to an examination and searching inquiry, as it is practised in capital cases.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Twenty-Three</h1>
<p>6. A judge must not conduct legal proceedings for his own friend, even if the latter has not been his best man nor one to whom he has been intimately attached. Neither should he act as judge for one whom he dislikes, even though he is not his avowed enemy nor one who means to injure him. It is necessary that both parties to a lawsuit should be equal in the eyes and the minds of the judges. The judge who fails to know either litigant and his activities is most likely to be a rightful judge.</p>
<p>7. Two scholars who dislike each other must not act as judges together, since this might result in perverted justice. Owing to the hostility between them, each will be inclined to refute the other.</p>
<p>8. A judge should ever regard himself as if a sword were placed upon his neck, with <italic>Gehinnom</italic> gaping under him. He should know whom he is judging, before whom he is judging, and who will punish him for deviating from the line of truth, as it is written: &#x201C;God stands in the divine assembly, in the midst of the judges&#x201D; (Psalm 82:1).&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>10. Ever regard the litigants as guilty when they are facing you, on the presumption that each of them has a false claim, and judge according to the arguments of which you approve. But when they go away from you, regard them both as innocent after having submitted to the judgment; regard each of them favorably.</p>
<h1>Chapter Twenty-Five</h1>
<p>1. A judge must not behave toward the community in a domineering and arrogant manner, but with humility and reverence. Any leader who casts exaggerated fear upon the community for ulterior motives will be punished.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. So too, he must not behave toward the people contemptuously, even if they happen to be ignorant. He must not stride over the heads of a holy people. Even if they happen to be uninformed and lowly, they are still the children of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>3. Just as the judge is charged with this duty, so is the community charged with the duty of treating the judge with respect.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>4. As soon as a person is appointed leader of the community, he must not do menial work in the presence of three men, so that he does not degrade himself in front of them. If he must not do menial work in public, it stands to reason that he is even more forbidden to eat and drink and get intoxicated in the presence of many people.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>EVIDENCE</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>4. It is a biblical positive command to investigate the witnesses and to subject them to searching inquiry and many questions, &#x2014; &#x2014; as it is written: &#x201C;You shall investigate and inquire and interrogate thoroughly&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 13:15). The judges should be careful in examining the witnesses, lest through the inquiry the witnesses learn to tell lies. The judges must examine the witnesses by asking them seven types of questions: In what seven-year cycle was the crime committed? In what year? In what month? On what day of the month? On what day of the week? At what hour? In what place? &#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>6. They must furthermore question the witnesses exhaustively concerning things that are not essential for the testimony, the validity of which does not depend on them. These are referred to as <italic>bedikoth</italic> (cross-examination). The more <italic>bedikoth</italic> a judge uses [to test the evidence], the more praise he deserves. Here is an example of <italic>bedikoth:</italic> If witnesses testified that a man killed a person, they were subjected to the seven types of questions we have enumerated, relating to the exact time and place. If, upon being questioned, they gave a precise description of the act itself and the weapon with which the accused had killed a person, they are cross-examined as follows : What clothes did the slain or the slayer wear? Were they white or black? Was the dust of the earth, where the slaying took place, white or red? Such questions are <italic>bedikoth.</italic> It once happened that the witnesses stated that the accused had killed a person on a certain spot under a fig tree. When they were cross-examined, they were asked: Were the figs black or white? Were the stalks long or short? (Sanhedrin 40a).</p>
<h1>Chapter Two</h1>
<p>1. Wherein does examination differ from cross-examination? In the examination, if one witness has given a definite answer and the other says <italic>I do not know</italic>, their evidence beomes invalid. But in the cross-examination, if both say <italic>we do not know</italic>, their evidence remains valid. Yet if they contradict each other even in the cross-examination, their evidence becomes invalid. If, for example, they testified that the accused had killed a person and, when questioned, one said: &#x201C;It happened during the seven-year-cycle &#x2026; in the year &#x2026; the month &#x2026; the day of the month &#x2026; the fourth day of the week, the sixth hour of the day; he killed him at that place.&#x201D; When questioned: &#x201C;With what weapon did he kill him,&#x201D; he replied: &#x201C;He killed him with a sword.&#x201D; The second witness, likewise, gave precise answers to all questions, except the one concerning the hour of the day, when he said : &#x201C;I do not know at what time it happened&#x201D; ; or, he agreed as to the time, but said: &#x201C;I do not know with what weapon he killed him, I did not investigate the weapon in his hand&#x201D; ; in a case such as this their evidence is invalid. But if they gave precise answers to all questions except when the judges asked them: &#x201C;Were his clothes black or white,&#x201D; if they replied: &#x201C;We do not know, we paid no attention to such unsubstantial things,&#x201D; their evidence remains valid.</p>
<p>2. If one witness said: &#x201C;He wore black clothes,&#x201D; and the other said: &#x201C;It is not true, he wore white clothes,&#x201D; their evidence is invalid. It is as if one said <italic>Wednesday</italic> and the other said <italic>Thursady</italic>, in which case there would be no evidence ; or, as if one said <italic>he killed him with a sword</italic> and the other said <italic>with a spear</italic>, then there is no evidence, as it is written: &#x201C;The thing is certain&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 13:15). Since they have contradicted each other in any one of the things, it is no longer certain.</p>
<p>3. If there were many witnesses, two of whom gave definite answers to the examination questions, and the third said <italic>I do not know</italic>, the evidence is sustained by the two and the accused is put to death ; but if the third witness contradicted them, even during the cross-examination, their evidence is void.</p>
<h1>Chapter Five</h1>
<p>1. No verdict is determined on the testimony of a single witness, whether in civil or capital cases, as it is written: &#x201C;A single witness shall not take the stand against a man in regard to any crime or any offense&#x201D; (19:15).</p>
<p>8. Any witness who has testified in a capital case must not act as one of the judges dealing with the same case; he must neither defend nor prosecute the accused. If he said: &#x201C;I have something in favor of the accused,&#x201D; he is to be silenced. &#x2014; &#x2014; In civil cases, however, he may defend or prosecute the defendant, but he cannot be included among the judges in the lawsuit, since no witness can act as a judge even in civil cases.</p>
<h1>Chapter Eleven</h1>
<p>1. He who has no knowledge of Scripture or Mishnah or right conduct is presumed to be sinful, and is therefore disqualified as a witness, on rabbinic grounds. The presumption is that anyone who is on such a low level commits most of the sins that come within his reach.</p>
<p>2. Accordingly, no evidence is entrusted to a boorish person, nor is his evidence accepted, unless he is known to be an observer of religious duties, or one who practises benevolence, leads an upright life and is courteous. His testimony is accepted, even though he is ignorant and has no knowledge of Scripture or Mishnah.</p>
<p>3. Hence, you may infer that every scholar is deemed eligible to bear witness unless he becomes disqualified ; every ignoramus is considered ineligible unless it becomes certain that he follows the right paths.</p>
<p>5. So too, contemptible persons are ineligible to bear witness, on rabbinic grounds. They are men who eat while walking in the street, in front of all the people ; and those who go about undressed in the market, while they are occupied with filthy work; and similar individuals who lack a sense of shame. All these are doggish and will not hesitate to bear false witness.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Eighteen</h1>
<p>1. If one has given false testimony and it has become known through witnesses that he has testified falsely, he is referred to as a scheming witness. It is a biblical positive command to do to him as he intended to do to the person against whom he testified. All those who testified and were proved plotting witnesses concerning an offense punishable by stoning must be stoned; if it is punishable by burning, they must be burned ; and so, the other modes of punishment by death. If the scheming witnesses bore evidence concerning an offense punishable by lashing, each of them is lashed like all offenders who deserve to be lashed ; his physical endurance is appraised, and he is lashed accordingly. If they testified to render a person liable to paying a penalty, each is assessed an equal share of the fine, according to the number of witnesses; each pays his proportionate share. They are not lashed where they have to pay compensation.</p>
<p>2. This applies only to witnesses who were convicted of scheming. But if two sets of witnesses contradict each other so that the evidence is invalid, neither of them is punished, because we do not know which is the lying set. What is the difference between contradiction and refutation? Contradiction affects the evidence itself: one set says that <italic>this event happened</italic>, and the other set says that <italic>this event did not happen</italic>, or implies that it did not happen. Refutation affects the witnesses ; those who refute them do not know whether the thing did or did not happen. If, for example, witnesses appeared and said: &#x201C;We saw this man killing a person,&#x201D; or &#x201C;lending one hundred <italic>zuz</italic> to that man, on such-and-such a day and in such-and-such a place.&#x201D; Then, after they had testified and been examined, two other witnesses came and said: &#x201C;On that very day and in that very place we were together with you and these individuals the entire day, and what you say is absolutely untrue: the accused did not kill that person,&#x201D; or &#x201C;the plaintiff did not lend money to the defendant,&#x201D; this is contradiction. So too, if they said to them: &#x201C;How can you testify like that? On that day the alleged homicide, or the slain person, or the borrower, or the lender, was with us in another city&#x0021;&#x201D; This is contradicted evidence, since it is as if one were to say: the accused did not kill the man, or the alleged creditor did not lend money to the alleged borrower, for they were with us and it did not happen. The same applies to all similar cases.<br/>If, however, the second set said to the first set: &#x201C;We do not know whether the accused killed the victim in Jerusalem on that day, as you assert, or whether he did not kill him, but we bear witness that you yourselves were with us in Babylon on that day,&#x201D; the first witnesses are thus turned out to be scheming witnesses and are put to death, or ordered to make restitution, since the refuting witnesses were not at all concerned with the testimony, whether it was true or false.</p>
<p>3. It is by divine decree that the Torah has accepted the evidence of the second set of witnesses rather than the first. Even if the first set consisted of a hundred witnesses, and two men came and refuted their evidence, saying to them : &#x201C;We bear witness that the entire hundred of you were with us that day in such-and-such a place,&#x201D; all of them are punished on the testimony of the two, since the evidence of two is as valid as that of a hundred and the testimony of a hundred is no more effective than that of two. So too, in the case of two sets of witnesses that contradict each other, we do not follow the one that is more numerous but dismiss the evidence of both.</p>
<h1>Chapter Twenty</h1>
<p>1. Scheming witnesses are neither put to death, nor lashed, nor ordered to make restitution, unless the two of them are eligible witnesses, and both are found to be scheming, and the scheming is detected after sentence has been passed. But if only one of them was refuted, or if both were refuted before sentence was passed, or even if both were refuted after sentence had been passed, and it was discovered that one of them was a relative or disqualified, they are not punished, although they have been refuted and become ineligible to bear witness in whatever case mentioned in the Torah.</p>
<p>2. If they were refuted after the execution of the person against whom they had testified, they are not put to death, owing to a decisive inference, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall do to him as he schemed to do&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 19:19), but has not yet done. This interpretation is based on tradition. However, if the accused against whom they had testified was lashed, they are lashed. So too, if by the evidence submitted by them, money was handed over from the defendant to the plaintiff, it is returned to the defendant and they make restitution to him.</p>
<p>3. If three witnesses, or even a hundred, testified in court one after the other within brief intervals, lasting as much as is needed for a mere utterance, and some of them were refuted, they are not punished unless all of them are refuted. If, however, the interval between the witnesses was longer than that needed for an utterance, or a student&#x2019;s greeting addressed to his teacher, the evidence has thus been divided: the two who were refuted suffer punishment, but the other two who testified after the prolonged interval are not punished. Although the entire evidence has become invalid, since they all constitute one set of witnesses, and if the evidence of some is disqualified, all of it is disqualified.</p>
<p>7. If witnesses testified that a person who was afflicted with a fatal disease killed someone, and they have been refuted, they are not put to death, because even if they had killed him with their own hands, they would not be executed, since he was anyway incurable.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>

<title>REBELS</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>1. The Supreme Court in Jerusalem represents the essence of the Oral Torah. Its members are the pillars of direction; law and order emanate from them to all of Israel. Concerning them the Torah assures us, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall act in accordance with the directions they give you&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 17:11). This is a positive command. Anyone who believes in Moses, our teacher, and in his Torah, must relate religious practices to them and lean upon them.</p>
<p>2. &#x2014; &#x2014; Whether their direction is based upon what they have learned from tradition, referred to as the Oral Torah, or it is derived from what they have independently discovered by means of any of the rules whereby the Torah is interpreted, and meets with their approval, or it is in the form of temporary regulations designed to preserve the biblical laws, measures consisting of decrees and ordinances and customs, we are biblically commanded to obey our sages with regard to any of these three categories. Whoever disregards one of them breaks a prohibitive command.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>3. There has never been dissension [among the sages] with regard to laws handed down by tradition. Anything concerning which there has been dissension is certainly not a tradition dating back to Moses, our teacher. Rules derived by rational inference, if sanctioned by all the members of the Supreme Court, are invested with authority indeed; if there is a divergence of opinion among the sages, we follow the majority and formulate the law according to the greater number. The same applies to the decrees, ordinances and customs : if some sages felt that it was appropriate to issue a decree or to enact an ordinance, or that the people should abandon a certain custom, and others felt that it was improper to issue that decree or to enact that ordinance, or that the people should not discontinue that custom, they would debate the subject and follow the majority opinion, formulating the law according to the greater number.</p>
<p>4. When the Supreme Court was in existence, there was no religious dissension among the people of Israel. If doubt came to the mind of a Jew concerning any law, he consulted the court of his home town. If they knew, they told him; if not, he was joined by that court or its agents and together they went up to Jerusalem where they submitted the question to the court that was situated at the entrance of the Temple Mount. If they knew, they told him; if not, they all proceeded to the court at the entrance of the Temple Court. If they knew, they told them; if not, they all went to the Supreme Court which occupied the chamber of hewn stone, and put the question to the judges. If the law concerning which they were all in doubt was known to the Supreme Court, either from tradition or from a principle of biblical interpretation, they stated it immediately. If the members of the Supreme Court were uncertain about that specific law, they dealt with it in their own time, and debated it until they eventually reached unanimous agreement or passed the measure by vote, following the majority opinion, and told all the questioners: &#x201C;This is the law.&#x201D; And they went away. When, however, the Supreme Court ceased to exist, religious dissension increased in Israel: one scholar would declare a thing <italic>unclean</italic> and give a reason for his statement, while another would declare it <italic>clean</italic> and give a reason for his statement; one would forbid, while the other would permit.</p>
<p>5. If two scholars, or two courts of law, whether contemporary or not, are in disagreement at a time when a Sanhedrin is nonexistent, or before a specific law has become clear to the Sanhedrin, follow the stringent view with regard to biblical law and the lenient view with regard to rabbinic law, if you do not know which way the law is prone.</p>
<h1>Chapter Two</h1>
<p>2. If a Supreme Court issued a decree or enacted an ordinance or introduced a custom, which has become widespread throughout Israel, and a subsequent court desires to abolish the instructions of the predecessors and to eradicate that particular ordinance, decree or custom, it cannot do so, unless it is superior both in wisdom and in number. If it exceeds the other court in wisdom but not in number, or in number but not in wisdom, it cannot annul its instructions. Even if the reason for which the predecessors introduced the decree or ordinance exists no more, the successors cannot revoke anything introduced by the predecessors unless they exceed them. But how can any Supreme Court exceed another in number when each Supreme Court consists of seventy-one members? The reference is to the number of contemporary sages who have agreed to accept the decision of the Supreme Court, or have not opposed it.</p>
<h1>Chapter Three</h1>
<p>1. One who does not believe in the Oral Torah is not to be identified with the rebellious elder spoken of in the Torah, but is classed with the epicureans (heretics).&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>4. The rebellious elder mentioned in the Torah is indeed one of the sages of Israel, who is familiar with the traditional lore, acts as judge, and instructs in subjects of Torah, as do all the wise men of Israel; but he has disagreed with the Supreme Court on a point of law, refusing to yield to their point of view. Instead, he has opposed them and taught others to act contrary to the court&#x2019;s ruling. The Torah has condemned him to death, and if he confesses before being executed he has a share in the world to come. Although he argues just as well as they do, he received the traditional lore just as well as they did, yet the Torah has honored them [favoring their view]. Even if the members of the court are willing to forego their honor and leave him alone, they cannot do so, in order to prevent many dissensions in Israel.</p>
<p>5. A rebellious elder is not guilty of death unless he is one of the sages of Israel, fit to render decisions, having been ordained by the Sanhedrin, and he is opposed to the court on a matter punishable by <italic>kareth</italic> for willful action, and by a sin-offering for action in error.&#x2014; &#x2014; But if he is a student who has not yet reached the stage of rendering decisions, and he has given a decision concerning what should be done, he is not liable, as it is written: &#x201C;If a case is too baffling for you to decide&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 17:8) ; that is, one who is capable of solving any problem except a superior one.</p>
<p>6. If the elder is the chief scholar of the court, and he differed, imparting his views to others persistently but giving no decision concerning what should be done, he is not liable, as it is written: &#x201C;The man who acts presumptuously&#x201D; (12); not that he <italic>says</italic> something presumptuously, but instructs others to <italic>act</italic>, or himself, acts presumptuously.</p>
<h1>Chapter Six</h1>
<p>1. It is a great positive precept to honor father and mother; so too, to pay reverence to father and mother. Scripture considers the duty of honoring parents and revering them equal to the duty of honoring and revering God. It is written: &#x201C;Honor your father and your mother&#x201D; (Exodus 20:12), and it is also written: &#x201C;Honor the Lord with your wealth&#x201D; (Proverbs 3:9). Concerning one&#x2019;s father and mother it is written: &#x201C;You shall each revere his mother and his father&#x201D; (Leviticus 19:3), and it is also written: &#x201C;Revere the Lord your God&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 6:13). Just as God commanded us to honor and revere his great Name, so he has commanded us to honor and revere our parents.</p>
<p>3. What is the distinction between reverence and honor? Reverence signifies that the son must neither stand nor sit in his father&#x2019;s place; he must not contradict his father nor decide against him.&#x2014; &#x2014; What does honoring signify? The son must provide his father and mother with food and drink and clothing, paid for by the father. If the father has no money and the son has, he is compelled to maintain his father and mother as much as he can. He must manage his father&#x2019;s affairs, conducting him in and out, and doing for him the kind of service that is performed by servants for their master ; he should rise before him, as he should rise before his teacher.</p>
<p>7. To what lengths should the honoring of one&#x2019;s father and mother go? Even if they took a pocketful of gold pieces belonging to him and cast it into the sea right in his presence, he must not shame them or scream and be angry at them; instead, he should accept the divine decree and keep silent. To what lengths should the duty of revering them go? Even if he wore costly clothes while presiding over a public assembly, and his father and mother came and tore his clothes, struck him on the head, and spat in his face, he must not embarrass them but keep silent. He should revere and fear the supreme King of kings who has thus commanded him. Had a mortal king laid a more painful restraint on him, he would be powerless to struggle against it; so much the more if the decree comes from him who spoke and the world came into being by his will.</p>
<p>8. Although we have been commanded to behave thus [generously and reverently toward our parents], a man must not impose too heavy a yoke upon his children by being too strict with them in regard to his honor, that he might not cause them to stumble; he should rather forgive and ignore, since a father may well forego the honor due him [allowing the son to omit the acts of reverence, and the son may avail himself of the permission] ; the father&#x2019;s honor may well be remitted.</p>
<p>10. If one&#x2019;s father or mother has become mentally disordered, he should make an effort to behave toward them according to their state of mind until they will be shown mercy [and get cured]. But if he is unable to endure the strain any longer, because they have become utterly insane, he may leave them and go elsewhere, charging others to take proper care of them.</p>
<p>12. If a man was ordered by his father to transgress the words of the Torah, and break either a prohibitive or a positive precept, or even a rabbinic enactsment, he must not listen to him, as it is written: &#x201C;You shall each revere his mother and his father, and keep my sabbaths&#x201D; (Leviticus 19:3); that is, all of you [including your parents] are required to honor me.</p>
<h1>Chapter Seven</h1>
<p>1. The penalty incurred by a rebellious son, who is spoken of in the Torah, has been stated to be death by stoning. But Scripture never condemns to punishment unless it has expressed a warning. Where has it expressed that warning? It is written: &#x201C;You shall not eat anything with its blood&#x201D; (Leviticus 19:26); that is, you must not eat in a manner that induces bloodshed. This alludes to the kind of eating in which the rebellious son indulges: he is put to death only for his repulsive manner of eating, as it is written: &#x201C;He is a glutton and a drunkard&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 21:20). Traditionally interpreted, a glutton is one who eats meat voraciously; a drunkard is one who drinks wine ravenously.</p>
<p>2. This eating for which he is liable is restricted by many limitations that are derived from traditional law: He does not deserve stoning unless he steals from his father and buys meat and wine cheaply [in order to have large quantities] ; or if he eats and drinks outside his father&#x2019;s premises in company of entirely ignorant and worthless men; eats the meat partially raw and partially cooked, the way thieves eat ; drinks the wine partially diluted, the way gobblers drink.&#x2014; &#x2014; If he stole from his father and ate like this in the premises of his father, or he stole from others and ate in this repulsive manner whether in his father&#x2019;s premises or in the premises of others, he is not liable. So too, if he stole from his father and ate in such a repulsive fashion in the premises of others, but it was in connection with the performance of a religious duty, even a rabbinic precept, or in connection with the performance of a transgression, even on rabbinic grounds, he is not liable, as it is written: &#x201C;He does not listen to our voice&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 21:20); that is, he disobeys his parents only by this eating, excluding this one who in so doing transgressed the precepts of the Torah.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>MOURNING</title>
<h1>Chapter Six</h1>
<p>1. According to rabbinic law, a mourner should observe some of the mourning customs throughout thirty days. From what biblical passage have the sages derived the number of thirty days? It is written: &#x201C;She shall mourn her father and mother for a full month&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 21:13). Hence, a mourner ought to grieve throughout thirty days.</p>
<p>2. Following are the things which a mourner must not do during the thirty days: he must not take a haircut, wear ironed clothes, get married, attend a social festivity, travel from one town to another on business&#x2014;a total of five things.</p>
<h1>Chapter Twelve</h1>
<p>1. Funeral rites are held in honor of the deceased. Accordingly, the heirs are compelled to pay a fee to wailing men and women who eulogize the dead. But if the deceased charged in his will not to eulogize him, he should not be eulogized. If, however, he charged in his will not to bury him, his wish is not heeded, because burying the dead is a religious duty, as it is written: &#x201C;You must bury him&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 21:23).</p>
<p>2. Anyone who is too indolent to mourn for a scholar will not enjoy longevity; anyone who is too indolent to mourn for a worthy man deserves to be buried alive. Anyone who sheds tears for a worthy person, there is a reward in store for him with God.</p>
<h1>Chapter Thirteen</h1>
<p>1. How is consolation offered to the mourners? When the corpse has been buried, the mourners assemble and remain standing at the border of the cemetery. All who have escorted the deceased stand around them, row after row.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>2. The mourners stand on the left of those who offer consolation, while all the comforters, one by one, approach the mourners and say to them: &#x201C;May you be comforted by God.&#x201D; Then each mourner goes home. On each of the seven days of mourning, people come to offer him consolation.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>11. One should not grieve too much over his deceased relative, as it is written : &#x201C;Weep not for him who is dead, wail not over him&#x201D; (Jeremiah 22:10); that is, weep not for him too much, since this is the way of the world. He who grieves too much over what is bound to happen is a fool. What measure of mourning should one follow? Three days for weeping, seven for lamenting, thirty days for abstaining from a haircut, and the rest of the five things.</p>
<h1>Chapter Fourteen</h1>
<p>1. It is a rabbinic positive precept to visit the sick, comfort the mourners, escort the dead, dower the bride, accompany the [departing] guests &#x2014; &#x2014; as well as to cheer the bride and the groom, and to assist them in whatever they need. Even though all these precepts are of rabbinic origin, they are implied in the biblical verse: &#x201C;You shall love your neighbor as yourself&#x201D; (Leviticus 19:18); that is, whatever you would have others do to you, do to your brothers in Torah and precepts.</p>
<p>2. The reward for escorting a stranger is greater than any reward. It is a practice introduced by our father Abraham, a way of kindness which was habitual with him. He served food and drink to wayfarers and escorted them. Hospitality to wayfarers is greater than welcoming the Divine Presence, as it is written: &#x201C;He saw three men &#x2026; he ran to meet them&#x201D; (Genesis 18:2). Escorting them is even greater than receiving them. The sages have declared: &#x201C;Anyone who does not escort his guests is almost guilty of bloodshed&#x201D; (Sotah 46b).</p>
<p>3. Local residents are compelled to provide escorts for wayfarers just as they are compelled to contribute to charity. The court used to provide agents to escort any person who would pass from one locality to another. Those who shirked this duty were regarded as if they shed blood [because of the dangerous roads]. Even if one accompanies another the distance of four cubits, he will be amply rewarded.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>4. The duty of visiting the sick applies to everybody. Even an eminent person must visit one who is of minor importance. The visits should be made several times a day. The more often one visits the sick, the more praise he deserves, provided that he does not weary the patient. Whoever visits a patient is as though he took away part of his illness and lightened his pain. Whoever does not visit the sick is almost guilty of bloodshed.</p>
<p>5. A sick person should be visited only from the third day on. If his illness came on suddenly and his condition has become worse, he should be visited immediately. A patient should not be visited either during the first three hours or the last three hours of the day, because he is being attended to at the time.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>22. All the clothes that are thrown on the deceased and on the casket in which he is buried must not be used, lest they become mixed up with the shrouds [which of course must not be used for anything else].</p>
<p>24. One should be trained not to be destructive, not to suffer a loss of garments by casting them into a devastating [grave]. It is better to give them to the poor rather than casting them to worms and moths. Anyone who throws many garments upon the dead transgresses the prohibitive precept: &#x201C;You shall not destroy&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 20:19).</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>KINGS</title>
<h1>Chapter One</h1>
<p>5. No woman is appointed head of the government, as it is written: &#x201C;I will set a king over you&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 17:15), and not a queen. So too, only a man is appointed to whatever office that is established over the people of Israel.</p>
<p>7. When a king is inaugurated, he is anointed with anointing oil, as it is written: &#x201C;Samuel took a flask of oil and poured it over his head and kissed him&#x201D; (I Samuel 10:1). Once the king is anointed, he wins the office for himself and his children forever. Kingship is inheritable, as it is written: &#x201C;In order that he and his descendants may reign long in the midst of Israel&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 17:20). If he left a little son, the kingship is kept for him until he grows up, as Jehoiada did for Joash. Whoever has priority in what concerns inheritance has priority in what concerns the inheritance of royalty. The elder son has precedence over the younger one. Not only royalty, but all appointive offices over the people of Israel are inherited by son and grandson forever, provided that the son succeeds his parents in wisdom and piety. If, however, he succeeds them in piety only, he is nevertheless appointed in the place of his father, even though he does not succeed him in wisdom, and he is given instruction thereafter. One who has no reverence for God is not appointed to any office over the people of Israel, even if he possesses great knowledge.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>12. The son of a king is not anointed unless there has been dissension or fighting [over the throne], in which case he is anointed to put an end to the dissension. Accordingly, Solomon was anointed because of Adonijah, Joash because of Athaliah, and Jehoahaz because of Jehoiakim his brother.</p>
<h1>Chapter Two</h1>
<p>1. The king is treated with great respect. The heart of everyone must be inspired with awe and reverence for him.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>3. He must not be seen when he is naked, or when he is taking a haircut or a bath, or when he dries himself after a bath.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>6. Even as Scripture has conferred great honor upon him and imposed on all the duty of respecting him, it likewise charged him to humble himself profoundly, as it is written: &#x201C;My heart is pierced within me&#x201D; (Psalm 109:22). He must not behave arrogantly toward Israel, as it is written: &#x201C;He shall not act haughtily toward his brethren&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 17:20). He should treat both small and great graciously and compassionately, directing them in their best interests, and respecting the honor of the lowliest. When addressing the public in general, he should speak gently, as it is written: &#x201C;Hear me, my brothers, my people&#x201D; (I Chronicles 28:2). It is written moreover: &#x201C;If you will be a servant to this people today &#x2026; if you speak favorable words to them, they will be your servants for all time&#x201D; (I Kings 12:7). He should ever practise deep humility. We have none greater than Moses, our teacher; yet, he said: &#x201C;What then are we? Your grumbling is not against us&#x201D; (Exodus 16:8). He should bear the heavy burden of them along with their bickering and anger, as a nurse puts up with an infant. Scripture calls him <italic>shepherd</italic>, as it is written: &#x201C;To be a shepherd over his people Jacob&#x201D; (Psalm 78:71). The way of a shepherd is plainly stated in the prophetic text: &#x201C;Like a shepherd he feeds his flock; in his arms he gathers the lambs, carrying them in his bosom&#x2026;&#x201D; (Isaiah 40:11).</p>
<h1>Chapter Three</h1>
<p>1. When the new king is seated on his royal throne, he must have a <italic>Sefer Torah</italic> written for himself, in addition to the one he has inherited from his parents. He must have the new copy proofread by the Supreme Court of seventy-one from the copy deposited in the Temple Court. If his parents left him no copy or it was lost, he must write two copies of the Torah: one he should place in his archives; he is ordered to write this one like any member of Israel; the second must not be removed from him except when &#x2014; &#x2014; he enters a place that is not suitable for reading. When he sets out to make war, it must be with him; when he comes back from war, it must be with him; when he sits in judgment, it must be with him ; when he sits down to eat, it must be in front of him, as it is written: &#x201C;It shall remain with him, and he shall read it all the days of his life&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 17:19).</p>
<p>5. The king must not drink to the point of intoxication, as it is written: &#x201C;It is not for kings to be drinking wine&#x201D; (Proverbs 31:4). He should rather be occupied day and night with Torah and the needs of his people Israel, as it is written: &#x201C;It shall remain with him, and he shall read it all the days of his life.&#x201D;</p>
<p>8. The king has a right to execute anyone who rebels against him.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>9. If a person disregards a royal decree because he happens to be busy with religious duties, even one light precept, he is not punished : where the words of the Master and the words of a servant are in conflict, those of the Master have precedence. It is needless to say that if the king decreed to abolish a religious precept, he should be disobeyed.</p>
<h1>Chapter Five</h1>
<p>1. At first, the king may wage only a religious war. Which is called a war for religious purposes? The war against the seven nations [of Canaan], the battle against Amalek, in defense of Israel from attacking enemies. Thereafter he may wage an optional war, a war against other peoples, to extend Jewish territory and to augment his military prestige.</p>
<p>2. In the case of a religious war, the king does not have to obtain the sanction of the Supreme Court. He may at any time set out independently and compel the people to come out with him. But in case of an optional war, he can bring out the people only by a decision of the court of seventy-one.</p>
<p>3. The king may break through anyone&#x2019;s property to make a road for himself, and none may protest against him. No limit is prescribed for the king&#x2019;s road. He makes use of as much as he needs. He is not required to proceed by a detour because of somebody&#x2019;s vineyard or field. He takes the straight line and pursues his battles.</p>
<p>9. One must not leave Eretz Yisrael for any other country except when going to study Torah, or to get married, or to save something from heathen, while planning to return. One may leave Eretz Yisrael also for business purposes, but not to establish residence in the Diaspora, unless a famine has become so severe in Eretz Yisrael that a denar&#x2019;s worth of wheat is priced two denars. This applies only when money is available and farm products are high; but if farm products are cheap and money is not obtainable, if one cannot make wages and is penniless, he may go to any place where he can earn a living. Yet, even though it is permissible to leave, it is not an act of piety.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>10. The great sages used to kiss the rocks within the area of Eretz Yisrael, rolling themselves in its dust, as it is written: &#x201C;Thy servants hold her stones dear, and favor her dust&#x201D; (Psalm 102:15).</p>
<p>11. The sages have declared: &#x201C;Whoever resides in Eretz Yisrael, his sins are forgiven.&#x201D; &#x2014; &#x2014; So too, whoever is buried in Eretz Yisrael obtains atonement, as if the place wherein he is buried were an altar of atonement, as it is written: &#x201C;The land makes expiation for his people&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 32:43). But when Scripture speaks of punishment, it is written: &#x201C;You shall die in an unclean land&#x201D; (Amos 7:17). There is no comparison between one whom Eretz Yisrael absorbs while he is alive and one whom it absorbs after his death. Nevertheless, the great sages used to bring their dead to Eretz Yisrael. Think of Jacob our father and of the upright Joseph&#x0021;</p>
<p>12. One should ever live in Eretz Yisrael, even in a town that is inhabited mostly by heathen ; one should not live in the Diaspora, even in a town that is mostly inhabited by Jews; whoever moves from Eretz Yisrael to the Diaspora is regarded as if he yielded to idolatry.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Six</h1>
<p>1. No war is to be waged with anyone in the world before offering him terms of peace, whether it is an optional or a religious war, as it is written: &#x201C;When you approach a town to attack it, you shall first offer it terms of peace&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 20:10). If the inhabitants have responded peaceably and accepted the seven precepts imposed upon the descendants of Noah, none of them should be slain but taxed, as it is written: &#x201C;They shall do forced labor for you and serve you&#x201D; (11).&#x2014; &#x2014; The tax imposed upon them consists in being prepared to serve the king physically and financially, as in the case of building walls and fortifying strongholds, or constructing a palace for the king, and the like.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>3. It is forbidden to prove false to the pact made with them, to deceive them when they have accepted the terms of peace and the seven precepts.</p>
<p>7. When a city is besieged in order to capture it, it must not be surrounded on all four sides but only on three sides, so as to leave room for a refugee, and anyone who wishes to escape.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Seven</h1>
<p>1. Whether in case of a religious or an optional war, a priest is appointed to address the troops ; he is anointed with the anointing oil, and is designated as the anointed-for-battle.</p>
<p>2. The anointed-for-battle addresses the troops on two occasions: once on the frontier, when they are about to set out, just before the battle is started; he says to the people: &#x201C;Is there anyone who has planted a vineyard but has never enjoyed its fruits? Let him go back to his home&#x2026;&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 20:6). Hearing this, anyone belonging to this category within the ranks returns home. The second time, he addresses those joining the battle: &#x201C;Do not be afraid; do not be alarmed&#x201D; (3).</p>
<p>3. When the battle lines are drawn up, and they are drawing near the attack, the anointed-for-battle mounts a platform and, facing the armed forces, addresses them in Hebrew: &#x201C;Hear, O Israel&#x0021; You are about to join battle with your enemies. Do not lose courage, fear not, tremble not, be not afraid of them; for it is the Lord your God who goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to bring you victory&#x201D; (3-4). Thus far the anointed-for-battle speaks; another priest loudly repeats this to all the people. The anointed-for-battle then continues: &#x201C;Is there anyone who has built a new house but has not dedicated it? Let him go back to his home&#x2026; Is there anyone who has planted a vineyard but has never yet enjoyed its fruits? Let him go back to his home&#x2026; Is there anyone who has betrothed a woman and has not yet taken her as his wife? Let him go back home&#x2026;&#x201D; (5-7). Thus far the anointed-for-battle speaks; and an officer loudly repeats this to all the people. Then the officer continues on his own: &#x201C;Is there anyone who is afraid and weakhearted? Let him go back home&#x201D; (8) ; and another officer loudly repeats this to all the people.</p>
<p>4. When all those entitled to return home have gone back from among the troops, the battle lines are set in order; military officers are appointed to head the troops; strong and brave guards are stationed behind each line; they hold iron axes in their hands. If anyone desires to retreat from the battle field, they have a right to cut off his leg, since flight is the beginning of defeat.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>9. All those who went back home from among the troops, after hearing the priest&#x2019;s proclamation, return now and provide water and food for their fellow soldiers and fix the roads.</p>
<p>15. &#x201C;Anyone who is afraid and weakhearted&#x201D; is to be understood literally; that is, his heart is not strong enough to join the battle ranks. But after joining the battle ranks, he must rely on God who is the hope of Israel, its savior in time of need. He should know that he is fighting for the Oneness of God; he should take his life in his hand, and fear nothing; he should not think of his wife nor of his children but blot out their memory from his mind and concentrate on the battle. Anyone who starts thinking and reflecting in the midst of battle, and gets himself alarmed, transgresses a prohibitive command, as it is written: &#x201C;Be not weakhearted or afraid; be neither alarmed nor frightened by them&#x201D; (3). Furthermore, he is answerable for all the blood of Israel. If he has not fought with all his heart and soul, it is as if he had shed the blood of all, as it is written: &#x201C;Lest his comrades lose heart like himself&#x201D; (8).&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Eleven</h1>
<p>1. King Messiah will arise and restore David&#x2019;s realm to its former status, its original sovereignty.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>3. Do not suppose that King Messiah will have to perform signs and wonders, create new things in the world, revive the dead, or similar acts. It is not so. Rabbi Akiva was a great sage, one of the authors of the Mishnah, yet he was the right-hand man of Ben Koziva, the ruler, whom he thought to be King Messiah. He and all the sages of his generation imagined Bar Kohkba to be King Messiah until he was slain unfortunately. Once he was slain, it dawned on them that he was not [Messiah]. Yet the sages had not asked him for an omen or a wonder. Basically, things are as follows: This Torah of ours, its statutes and laws, will never be subject to change. Nothing is to be added to or taken away from them. Whoever has added or taken away anything, or has misinterpreted the Torah and rendered the commands in opposition to their literal sense, is an impostor, a sinful man, a heretic.</p>
<p>4. If a king will arise from the house of David, a student of Torah, performing good deeds like his ancestor David, in the spirit of both the Written and the Oral Torah, and prevail upon all Israel to reinstate the Torah and to follow its direction, and will fight the battles of the Lord, he will presumably be the Messiah. If he has done these things and succeeded, having overcome the surrounding enemy nations and rebuilt the sanctuary on its site and gathered the dispersed of Israel, he will certainly be the Messiah. If he has not succeeded to such an extent, or has been slain, it is certain that he is not the one concerning whom the Torah has assured us.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<h1>Chapter Twelve</h1>
<p>1. It must not be supposed that in the messianic days any of the laws of nature will cease to exist, or that some new creation will then come into being within the created universe. Indeed, the world will continue in its normal course [without change]. What is written in Isaiah: &#x201C;The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid&#x201D; (11:6) should be understood figuratively. It signifies that the Israelite people will dwell securely among the world&#x2019;s evil men who are likened to wolves and leopards, as it is written : &#x201C;Wolves of the desert ravage them, leopards keep watch round their cities&#x201D; (Jeremiah 5:6). They will all turn to the true religion, and will neither plunder nor destroy; they will indeed eat what is permissible, gently, along with Israel, as it is written: &#x201C;The lion shall eat straw like any ox&#x201D; (7). So too, all similar biblical passages referring to the Messiah are metaphorical. During the messianic era, their precise metaphorical significance will become known to all.</p>
<p>2. The sages have declared : &#x201C;The only difference between the present world and the messianic era is our present subjection to foreign powers&#x201D; (Berakhoth 34b). From a literal interpretation of the Prophets it appears that at the beginning of the messianic age the war of Gog and Magog will be launched, and that prior to that war a prophet will arise among the people of Israel to keep their heart steadfast, as it is written: &#x201C;Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet&#x201D; (Malachi 3:23).&#x2014; &#x2014; He will come only to establish peace in the world, as it is written: &#x201C;He will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers&#x201D; (24). Some of the sages declare that Elijah will appear before the advent of King Messiah. No person is in a position to know how all these things and their like will happen until they will eventually take place. They are mentioned by the prophets vaguely, not explicitly. Nor have the sages any traditional knowledge concerning these matters, except what they gather from the implication of the biblical verses. Hence, there is disagreement among them on this subject. At any rate, neither the sequence of these events nor their minute details are of basic importance in religion. One should never deal with legendary topics, nor stretch midrashic statements on these and similar subjects. He should not consider them essential, since they do not lead to love and reverence [for God]. Nor should one reckon the end of days [from biblical indications]. The sages have said: &#x201C;Let despair come to those who make calculations&#x201D; (Sanhedrin 97b). One should rather hopefully wait, and believe in the principles of things, as we have explained.</p>
<p>4. The prophets and the sages longed for the messianic days not in order to dominate the nations of the world, nor to rule over them, nor to be exalted by them, nor to eat and drink and rejoice, but to be free to study Torah, with no one to oppress or disturb them, so as to deserve life in the world to come, as we have explained in the section on repentance.</p>
<p>5. In that era there will be no famine, no war, no envy, no strife. Prosperity will be plentiful, and all kinds of luxuries will be available like dust. The universal preoccupation will be primarily to know the Lord. Consequently, the people of Israel will be very wise; the things that are now vague and deeply hidden will be revealed to all; they will attain a knowledge of their Creator to the utmost human capacity, as it is written: &#x201C;The land shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea&#x201D; (Isaiah 11:9).</p>
