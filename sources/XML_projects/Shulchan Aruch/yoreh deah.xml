<title>PREFACE</title>
<p>The present work is the first in a contemplated series of volumes of the entire Code of Hebrew Law and embodies an attempt to present an unabridged English translation of the <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an &#x2018;Aruk</italic> of <italic>R. Joseph Caro</italic> including the Glosses of his contemporary <italic>R. Moses Isserles.</italic> The translation is accompanied by an extensive commentary based on the classical commentaries usually printed along with the text in the Romm ed., Wilna 1873. The original Hebrew text of <italic>Caro</italic> and <italic>Isserles</italic> has also been included with punctuation marks.</p>
<p>The translation is a literal rendering of the original and in order to make the text more comprehensible, words and passages which are not found in the original have been placed in square brackets.</p>
<p>The commentary aims to indicate the source of each law in Rabbinic literature as found in the <italic>Be&#x2019;er ha-Golah</italic> and the invaluable comments of the <italic>Wilna Gaon</italic> in addition to many sources adduced in compilations of later date. Each law is elucidated and interpreted in accordance with the standard authorities, viz., <italic>Ture</italic> Z<italic>ahab</italic> by <italic>R. David b. Samuel ha-Lewi</italic> (Lublin 1646), the <italic>Sifthe Kohen</italic> by <italic>R. Shabbethai b. Meir ha-Kohen</italic> (Cracow 1647), the notes of <italic>R. Akiba Eger</italic> (Konigsberg 1859), the <italic>Ba&#x2019;er Heteb</italic> of <italic>R.</italic> Z<italic>echariah Mendel</italic> (Amsterdam 1754), the <italic>Pith&#x1E25;e Teshubah</italic> of <italic>R. Hirsch Eisenstadt</italic> (Wilna 1836) and many others. Wherever it was deemed necessary resort has been made to modern scholarship.</p>
<p>The constant aim has been to trace each law beginning with the sources through the <italic>Later Codifiers</italic>, such as, <italic>&#x1E24;okmath Adam, &#x2018;Arok ha-Shul&#x1E25;an</italic> and present-day <italic>Responsa</italic> literature.</p>
<p>The general character of the translation and the commentary may be summed up in the following Talmudic passage: &#x2018;What is the meaning of the text, <italic>And they read in the book, in the law of God, with an interpretation, and they gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1">1</xref></sup> <italic>And they read in the book, in the law of God</italic>: this refers to the [Hebrew] text; <italic>with an interpretation</italic>: this refers to the <italic>Targum</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn2">2</xref></sup> <italic>and they gave the sense</italic>: this refers to the division of the verses; <italic>and caused them to understand the reading</italic>: this refers to the cantillation,<sup><xref rid="fn3">3</xref></sup> or according to another report, the traditional version of the text.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn4">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The need for such a work cannot be over-emphasized and if it please God that this work shall answer the end by really aiding both scholars and laymen to gain a good knowledge of Hebrew Law, the coveted reward of my labour will have been vouchsafed.</p>

<intro>
<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>The first attempts to collect final legal decisions for practical purposes were made after the Talmud was finally redacted by Rabina (c. 499). This was done, on the one hand, by <italic>epitomizers</italic> who endeavoured to abridge the legal discussions in the Talmud, omitting Aggadic and unnecessary material, while still adhering to the general sequence of Talmudic expositions; and, on the other hand, by <italic>Codifiers</italic> who abstracted legal rulings and arranged them in a systematic and methodical order.</p>
<p>Among the earliest efforts made along these lines were that of <italic>R. Yehudai Gaon</italic> of Sura (8th cent.) in his <italic>Halakoth Ketu&#x2018;oth</italic> (&#x201C;Abridged Laws&#x201D;) and that of <italic>R. Simon of Kahira</italic> (9th cent.) in his <italic>Halakoth Gedoloth</italic> (&#x201C;Great Laws&#x201D;).</p>
<p>The most important <italic>epitomizers</italic> of the Talmud were <italic>R. Isaac Alfasi</italic> and <italic>R. Asher b. Ye&#x1E25;iel.</italic> The former (1013-1103) in his <italic>Halakoth</italic> retained all the practical laws in the form and style of the Talmud but omitted all Aggadic matter as well as those laws that were no longer in force since the destruction of the Temple. He also condensed many lengthy Talmudic discussions and recorded his own decisions in undecided cases. The latter (1250-1328) adopted the plan of <italic>Alfasi&#x2019;s Halakoth</italic> and also included the opinions of the later authorities.</p>
<p>Among the <italic>Codifiers, Maimonides</italic> (1135-1204) in his <italic>Mishneh Torah</italic> occupies first place. This is the most comprehensive and systematically arranged Code of all laws found in the entire Rabbinic literature. In addition, <italic>Maimonides</italic> occasionally adds the opinions of the <italic>Geonim.</italic></p>
<p>The <italic>Sefer Mi&#x1E93;woth ha-Gadol</italic> (&#x201C;The Large Book of Commandments&#x201D;) by <italic>R. Moses b. Jacob</italic> of Coucy, France, (first half of 13th cent.) who was a French <italic>Tosafist</italic> and <italic>Codifier</italic>, presents all of Hebrew Law according to the 613 positive and negative commandments. An abridgment of this Code was made by <italic>R. Isaac b. Joseph</italic> of Corbeil (13th cent.) known as the <italic>Sefer Mi&#x1E93;woth ha-katan.</italic></p>
<p>The standard Code for all Jews up to the time of the <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an &#x2018;Aruk</italic> was the <italic>Tur</italic>, produced by <italic>R. Jacob</italic>, son of the celebrated <italic>R. Asher b. Ye&#x1E25;iel</italic> mentioned above. This Code is divided into four parts, called: <italic>Tur Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic>, treating of liturgical laws; <italic>Tur Yoreh De&#x2018;ah</italic>, treating of the ritual laws; <italic>Tur Eben ha-Ezer</italic>, treating of marriage laws, and <italic>Tur &#x1E24;oshen ha-Mishpat</italic>, treating of civil laws.</p>
<h1>THE SHUL&#x1E24;AN &#x2018;ARUK</h1>
<p>The Spanish Inquisition which resulted in the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492 was in no small measure responsible for the new orientation in Rabbinics and Cabbalistic teachings which finally produced a luminary such as <italic>R. Joseph Caro</italic>, the author of the <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an &#x2018;Aruk</italic>.</p>
<p>The perplexed and bewildered exiles were confronted by new problems of adjustment which required a re-interpretation of Jewish Law. There were numerous compilations on the elucidation of Jewish Law available. Yet, there was a heart-felt need for one to codify the law so that the entire community of Jews should be able to guide itself in accordance with a systematically arranged body of laws and regulations.</p>
<p><italic>R. Joseph b. Ephraim b. Joseph</italic> (1488-1575) was born in Spain or Portugal and after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain his parents moved to Nicopolis in European Turkey and brought him there at the age of four. His father, an eminent Talmudist, was his first teacher in Talmud. Later, <italic>Caro</italic> moved to Adrianople where he earned for himself a reputation as a master of Rabbinic learning and had a great following of disciples. When <italic>Shelomo Molko</italic>, the Messianic dreamer subsequently arrived in Adrianople, he roused <italic>Caro&#x2019;s</italic> mystical inclinations and induced him to emigrate to the Holy Land. <italic>Caro</italic> settled in Safed c. 1535.</p>
<p><italic>Caro</italic> devoted considerable time to the study of the Mishna which he could recite by heart. He wrote a commentary on the Mishna and super-commentaries to the commentaries of <italic>Rashi</italic> and <italic>Na&#x1E25;manides</italic> on the Pentateuch, which apparently were not preserved. In order to facilitate the study of the Talmud, he wrote a methodology of the Talmud.<sup><xref rid="fn5">1</xref></sup> He left with us an extensive commentary to Maimonides&#x2019; <italic>Mishneh Torah</italic> or <italic>Yad ha-&#x1E24;azakah</italic> entitled <italic>Kesef Mishneh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn6">2</xref></sup> in which he traced the source of every <italic>halakah</italic> stated by <italic>Maimonides</italic> and defended the latter against the strictures of <italic>R. Abraham b. David</italic> of Posquieres.</p>
<p><italic>R. Joseph Caro</italic> was a disciple of <italic>R. Jacob Berab</italic> by whom he was subsequently ordained. The latter strove to revive the original system of <italic>Ordination</italic> (<italic>Semikah</italic>) and to re-establish the <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> as a central authority in Jewish life. Already during the days of the Patriarch Hillel II the seats of Jewish learning in Tiberias, Sepphoris and Lod, the last strongholds of Judaism in the Land of Israel, were destroyed, and the long uninterrupted chain of <italic>Ordination</italic> beginning with Moses had come to an end. Since that period, all Judges merely acted as the agents of the former authoritative Judges (<italic>Mum&#x1E25;im</italic>) who alone were referred to by the Scriptural term &#x2018;<italic>Elohim</italic>,&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn7">3</xref></sup> viz., experienced scholars versed in matters of law. Consequently, judges were no longer qualified to adjudicate fines and other important matters which were dealt with originally by the members of the <italic>Sanhedrin.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn8">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet, there were sources in the writings of <italic>Maimonides</italic> that prior to the advent of the Messiah, if the entire body of scholars in the Land of Israel were to reach a unanimous agreement to reinstitute the original system of <italic>Ordination</italic> and re-establish the <italic>Sanhedrin</italic>, they were free to do so and would be regarded as <italic>Mum&#x1E25;im</italic>, although the chain was broken in the days of Hillel II.<sup><xref rid="fn9">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>This was the plan of <italic>R. Jacob Berab</italic> who settled in Safed about 1534. However, he committed a blunder by not consulting at first with the Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem, <italic>R. Lewi b. &#x1E24;abib</italic>, who felt that not only was he slighted personally but that since the Holy City would in such an undertaking have to become the center of authority, the convocation of Rabbinic authorities summoned for this purpose by <italic>Jacob Berab</italic> in Safed, should have been held in Jerusalem. In addition he had other legal arguments against this venture and finally <italic>Ibn &#x1E24;abib&#x2019;s</italic> opposition led to the collapse of the whole plan.</p>
<p><italic>Caro</italic>, however, attempted to realize his master&#x2019;s aims in a different form, although not without considerable counteraction at first.</p>
<p>As seen above, Hebrew Law was in a chaotic state, since every Rabbinic authority rendered legal decisions based on individual logical opinions. As <italic>Caro</italic> puts it, &#x201C;<italic>The Torah had become like many Torahs due to the many books on the exposition of its judgments and laws</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn10">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Consequently, <italic>Caro</italic> decided to produce a work which would harmonize the conflicting views so that we have &#x201C;<italic>one Torah and one law</italic>,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn11">7</xref></sup> viz., a Code that would be acceptable as the central authority in Jewish life.</p>
<p>Following the arrangement of <italic>R. Jacob b. Asher</italic> in his <italic>Arba&#x2018;ah Turim</italic> (&#x201C;Four Rows&#x201D;),<sup><xref rid="fn12">8</xref></sup> he wrote his masterpiece, the <italic>Beth Yosef</italic> (&#x201C;House of Joseph&#x201D;) in four parts,<sup><xref rid="fn13">9</xref></sup> tracing each <italic>halakah</italic> to its source in the Bible, Mishna, Talmud, <italic>halakic Midrashim, Responsa</italic> literature of the <italic>Geonim</italic> and the <italic>Codifiers</italic> until <italic>R. Isaac Abuhab</italic> and <italic>R. Jacob b. &#x1E24;abib</italic>, the <italic>Sephardic</italic> scholars of his times.<sup><xref rid="fn14">10</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Caro</italic> possessed a logical mind. His style is clear and concise. After quoting the conflicting opinions cited by the <italic>Tur</italic>, he subjects them to a thorough analysis and finally renders a decision. Where the opinions carry equal weight, he relies upon <italic>Alfasi, Maimonides</italic> and <italic>Asheri</italic>, whom he accepts as his standards in cases where the latter are all in agreement, or he accepts two out of the three when there is no complete harmony between them save in cases where most of the earlier authorities opposed them.<sup><xref rid="fn15">11</xref></sup> When the Zohar conflicts with the Talmud he accepts the latter as binding.<sup><xref rid="fn16">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>He began to write his <italic>Beth Yosef</italic> in Adrianople at the age of thirty-four (1522) and completed it after twenty years in Safed (1542) and then spent twelve more years in reexamining and revising his work.<sup><xref rid="fn17">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>In order to present in concise form a digest of his <italic>Beth Yosef, Caro</italic> wrote in his old age, the <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an &#x2018;Aruk</italic> (&#x201C;Prepared Table&#x201D;)<sup><xref rid="fn18">14</xref></sup> for those who were not educated enough to understand his <italic>Beth Yosef</italic> and at the same time serving as a review of Hebrew Law for the sake of scholars.<sup><xref rid="fn19">15</xref></sup></p>
<h1>GLOSSES OF R. MOSES ISSERLES</h1>
<p>When conditions in Germany during the period of the Crusades (1096-1189) became unbearable, many German Jews emigrated to Poland where they were permitted to practice their religious beliefs openly and were under the protection of the Polish Princes.</p>
<p><italic>Caro&#x2019;s Shul&#x1E25;an &#x2018;Aruk</italic> could not appeal to the German and Polish Rabbinic authorities for the simple reason that it was a codification of the opinions of the <italic>Sephardic</italic> Rabbis only and did not take into consideration the customs and decisions of the <italic>Ashkenazim</italic> as a result of which it was vehemently attacked by the latter.</p>
<p>Then emerged <italic>R. Moses Isserles</italic>, who instead of discarding completely the <italic>Shul&#x1E25;an &#x2018;Aruk</italic> of <italic>Caro</italic>, supplemented the text with the opinions of the <italic>Ashkenazic</italic> scholars together with the Franco-German <italic>Tosafists</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn20">16</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>R. Moses Isserles</italic> was born at Cracow about 1520 and died May 1, 1572. His father was a wealthy and prominent Talmudist and was the lay leader of the Cracow community.<sup><xref rid="fn21">17</xref></sup> <italic>Isserles</italic> was a pupil <italic>of R. Shalom Skakna</italic> of Lublin whose daughter he later married. After completing his studies at Lublin, he returned to his native city, where, for a period of twenty years he headed the <italic>Yeshiba</italic> and also maintained it at his own expense. He embraced many fields of knowledge including <italic>Cabbalah</italic> and Philosophy. He was a lover of truth and a very peaceful and humble person. Contrary to many authorities of his day, he opposed <italic>Pilpul</italic> and held that the Talmud should be understood in a simple way.<sup><xref rid="fn22">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>As <italic>Caro</italic>, so too, did <italic>Isserles</italic> write a commentary to the <italic>Tur</italic> including the <italic>Beth Yosef</italic>, entitled <italic>Darke Moshe</italic> (&#x201C;The Ways of Moses&#x201D;)<sup><xref rid="fn23">19</xref></sup> in which he takes <italic>Caro</italic> to task for omitting the opinions, customs and decisions of the German and Polish authorities, and again, as <italic>Caro</italic>, he later made a digest of his <italic>Darke Moshe</italic> which he incorporated as <italic>Glosses</italic> both as a criticism as well as a supplement to <italic>Caro&#x2019;s</italic> text, which he called <italic>Mappah</italic> (&#x201C;Table Cloth&#x201D;).<sup><xref rid="fn24">20</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Isserles</italic> regarded <italic>Caro</italic> as a great scholar and a saintly person.<sup><xref rid="fn25">21</xref></sup> Hence, he did not write a separate Code of Law for the <italic>Ashkenazim</italic> but merely provided the &#x201C;Prepared Table&#x201D; with a &#x201C;Table-cloth.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Many of his decisions he based on the prevailing local custom, and although he vindicates many an <italic>Ashkenazic</italic> custom, yet, when the custom (<italic>Minhag</italic>) appears absurd he declares it to be erroneous and unacceptable.<sup><xref rid="fn26">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Contrary to <italic>Graetz</italic><sup><xref rid="fn27">23</xref></sup> who regards <italic>Isserles</italic> as strict and uncompromising, anyone who is <italic>en courant</italic> with the latter&#x2019;s writings will easily discover that the opposite view is correct.<sup><xref rid="fn28">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus <italic>Isserles</italic> became for the <italic>Ashkenazim</italic> what <italic>Caro</italic> was for the <italic>Sephardim.</italic></p>

<title>LAWS OF VISITING THE SICK</title>
</part>
<chapter>
<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 335: WHEN TO VISIT THE SICK; WHICH SICK PERSONS SHOULD BE VISITED; HOW TO PRAY FOR THE SICK. Contains ten paragraphs.</title>
<p><b>LAWS OF VISITING THE SICK; HEALING; THE APPROACH OF DEATH AND ONE IN A DYING CONDITION.</b><br/>1. It is a religious duty to visit the sick.<sup><xref rid="fn29">1</xref></sup> Relatives and friends<sup><xref rid="fn30">2</xref></sup> may enter at once and strangers after three days. If the sickness overtakes him<sup><xref rid="fn31">3</xref></sup> both may enter forthwith.<sup><xref rid="fn32">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. Even a prominent person must visit a humble one;<sup><xref rid="fn33">5</xref></sup> even many times a day and even if the visitor is of his affinity.<sup><xref rid="fn34">6</xref></sup> One who increases [his visits] is considered praiseworthy,<sup><xref rid="fn35">7</xref></sup> provided he does not trouble him.<sup><xref rid="fn36">8</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>Some say that an enemy may visit a sick person</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn37">9</xref></sup> <italic>However, this does not seem plausible to me; but he should not visit a sick person nor comfort a mourner whom he hates, so that</italic> [<italic>the latter</italic>] <italic>should not think that he rejoices at his misfortune, and thereby feel depressed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn38">10</xref></sup> <italic>Thus seems to me</italic> [<italic>to be the correct view</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn39">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. One who visits the sick may neither sit upon a bed, nor upon a chair, nor upon a stool, but must [reverently] wrap himself and sit in front of him [the invalid], for the Divine Presence is above the top-side of his bed.<sup><xref rid="fn40">12</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: [<italic>This applies</italic>] <italic>only if the sick person lies on the ground so that he who sits</italic> [<italic>near him</italic>] <italic>will be on a higher level; but when he lies upon the bed, it is permissible</italic> [<italic>for the visitor</italic>] <italic>to sit on a chair or a stool</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn41">13</xref></sup> <italic>And thus is our accepted practice</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn42">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. One must not visit the sick during the first three hours of the day, &#x2014; for every invalid&#x2019;s illness is alleviated in the morning and [consequently] one will not trouble himself to pray<sup><xref rid="fn43">15</xref></sup> for him; and not during the last three hours of the day, &#x2014; for then his illness grows worse and one will give up hope to pray for him.<sup><xref rid="fn44">16</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>One who visited</italic> [<italic>a sick person</italic>] <italic>and did not pray for him has not fulfilled the religious duty</italic> [<italic>of visiting the sick</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn45">17</xref></sup></p>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 336: LAWS OF THE PHYSICIAN. Contains three paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. The Torah has granted the physician permission to heal,<sup><xref rid="fn63">1</xref></sup> and it is a religious duty<sup><xref rid="fn64">2</xref></sup> which comes under the rule of saving an endangered life.<sup><xref rid="fn65">3</xref></sup> If he withholds [treatment] he is regarded as one who sheds blood;<sup><xref rid="fn66">4</xref></sup> and even if there is someone else who can heal him; for not from every one does one merit to be healed.<sup><xref rid="fn67">5</xref></sup> Nevertheless, on should not occupy himself with medical treatment unless he is an expert and there is none other greater than he; for if not so, he is regarded as one who sheds blood.<sup><xref rid="fn68">6</xref></sup> If one administered medical treatment without the permission of the Jewish Court,<sup><xref rid="fn69">7</xref></sup> he is subject to payment of indemnities, even if he is an expert; and if he administered medical treatment, having the permission of the Jewish Court, and erred, causing [thereby] injury [to the patient], he is exempt by the laws of man and is held responsible by the laws of Heaven.<sup><xref rid="fn70">8</xref></sup> If he caused death and it became known to him that he acted inadvertently, he is banished<sup><xref rid="fn70">8</xref></sup> on account of him.<sup><xref rid="fn71">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. The physician is forbidden to take payment for his wisdow and learning<sup><xref rid="fn72">10</xref></sup> but he may receive payment for his trouble<sup><xref rid="fn73">11</xref></sup> and lost time.<sup><xref rid="fn74">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. One who has medical ingredients and his neighbour is sick and requires them, is forbidden to raise the price above the standard value.<sup><xref rid="fn75">13</xref></sup> Furthermore, even if they agreed to pay him an excessive amount, due to the need of the hour, &#x2014; for they found that only he possessed the medical ingredients, &#x2014; he is entitled only to the [standard] price.<sup><xref rid="fn76">14</xref></sup> However, if one stipulated an excessive sum as payment to the physician, he is obligated to give it to him, for he sold him his learning which cannot be valued in [terms of] money.<sup><xref rid="fn77">15</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>Although he is required on account of the religious duty</italic><sup><xref rid="fn78">16</xref></sup> <italic>to heal him</italic>, &#x2014; <italic>for every positive command which rests upon every person</italic> [<italic>to fulfil</italic>], &#x2014; [<italic>yet</italic>] <italic>if it chances to come to one&#x2019;s hand and he agrees to execute it only for money</italic>, &#x2014; [<italic>the law is that</italic>] <italic>we do not claim the money from him</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn79">17</xref></sup> <italic>nor do we make him cancel his</italic><sup><xref rid="fn80">18</xref></sup> <italic>obligation</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn81">19</xref></sup></p>

But not every person merits such consequences. Man, therefore, has to rely upon natural cures too, through the permission granted the medical man to administer treatment, who in turn is religiously dutibound to perform his duty &#x2014; <italic>Ta</italic>Z.

Hence, this includes giving medical advice which may save the patient and restore his person to good health. Consequently, this must be done gratuitously. Cf. Bek. 29a, &#x2018;Just as I teach gratuitously, so must you teach gratuitously,&#x2019; for one must not receive remuneration for the performance of a religious duty. V. <italic>ibid.</italic> Mishna. Advising the patient which medicine to take would refer to learning and wisdom which must be offered <italic>gratis</italic>; visiting the patient or writing a prescription would refer to trouble and lost time for which payment may be accepted &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>

Eger.</italic> Although the physician is forbidden to receive payment (v. <italic>supra</italic> par. 2), it is different, however, if the patient had obligated himself to pay. For the physician may put forth a valid claim that it was not only his own duty to study medicine, since everyone has the opportunity to master this field. Nevertheless, in the case of the man who escaped from prison (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 14) and offered the ferryman an exorbitant fee to take him across the river, the law is that he was obliged to pay only the normal rates, despite the fact, that in this case too, the ferryman may claim that every person has the opportunity to learn his type of work, for in the latter case there exists an established rate, whereas in the former case the knowledge of the physician cannot be measured in terms of money. Consequently the stipulation must be fulfilled &#x2014; <italic>Ta</italic>Z.</ftnote>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 338: THE SICK PERSON&#x2019;S CONFESSION AND IN WHAT MANNER HE IS INSTRUCTED. Contains two paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. If one feels death approaching, he is instructed, &#x2018;Confess [your sins]&#x0021;&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn84">1</xref></sup> And they say to him, &#x2018;Many confessed [their sins] and died not, and many who have not confessed, died; and as a reward, should you confess, you will live;<sup><xref rid="fn85">2</xref></sup> and he who confesses [his sins] has a portion in the world to come.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn86">3</xref></sup> And if he is unable to make confession with his mouth, he should confess in his heart.<sup><xref rid="fn85">2</xref></sup> <italic>If he knows not what to confess, they instruct him, say, &#x2018;My death should be an expiation for all my sins</italic>.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn87">4</xref></sup> All these instructions are given to him, not in the presence of illiterate people, nor women, nor minors, lest they cry and break his heart.<sup><xref rid="fn85">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. The order of confession<sup><xref rid="fn88">5</xref></sup> for a dangerously ill person, is, &#x2018;I confess before Thee O Lord, my God and the God of my fathers, that my healing and my death are in your hand. May it be Thy will, to heal me completely, and if I die, my death should be an expiation for all sins, wrongs and rebellious acts,<sup><xref rid="fn89">6</xref></sup> which I have committed sinfully, wrongfully and rebelliously before Thee, and grant me a share in Paradise, and favour me with the world to come which is stored away for the Righteous.&#x2019; <italic>And if he desires to prolong as in the confession for the Day of Atonement</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn90">7</xref></sup> <italic>he has the right to do so</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn91">8</xref></sup></p>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 339: LAWS CONCERNING ONE IN A DYING CONDITION; (RECITAL OF &#x1E92;IDDUK HADDIN);<sup><xref rid="fn92">1</xref></sup> WHICH ARE THE AUSPICIOUS OMENS.<sup><xref rid="fn93">2</xref></sup> Contains five paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. One in a dying condition is considered a living being in all respects.<sup><xref rid="fn94">3</xref></sup> We may not tie up his jaws,<sup><xref rid="fn95">4</xref></sup> nor may we annoint him with oil, nor wash him,<sup><xref rid="fn96">5</xref></sup> nor stop off his organs of the extremities,<sup><xref rid="fn97">6</xref></sup> nor may we remove the pillow from under him, nor may we place him on sand, clay-ground or earth, nor may we place on his stomach a dish, a shovel, a flask of water or a globule of salt,<sup><xref rid="fn98">7</xref></sup> nor may we summon the towns on his behalf, nor may we hire pipers and lamenting women, nor may we close his eyes<sup><xref rid="fn99">8</xref></sup> before his soul departs.<sup><xref rid="fn100">9</xref></sup> And whosoever closes [the dying person&#x2019;s] eyes before death<sup><xref rid="fn101">10</xref></sup> is regarded as one who sheds blood.<sup><xref rid="fn102">11</xref></sup> One may not rend garments, nor bare the shoulder in mourning, nor make a lamentation for him, nor bring a coffin into the house in his presence before he dies,<sup><xref rid="fn103">12</xref></sup> nor may we begin the recital of <italic>&#x1E92;idduk Haddin</italic><sup><xref rid="fn92">1</xref></sup> before his soul departs.<sup><xref rid="fn104">13</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>Some say that we may not dig out a grave for him. although it is not</italic> [<italic>done</italic>] <italic>in his presence</italic>, [<italic>i.e.</italic>,] <italic>in the house, &#x2014; before he dies</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn105">14</xref></sup> <italic>It is</italic> [<italic>likewise</italic>] <italic>forbidden to dig out any grave to be</italic> [<italic>left</italic>] <italic>open until the next day, in which the corpse will not be buried the same day, and there is danger in this</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn106">15</xref></sup> <italic>It is likewise forbidden to cause</italic> [<italic>aught</italic>] <italic>to hasten the death of one who is in a dying condition, e.g., one who has been in a dying condition for a long time, and could not depart</italic>, &#x2014; [<italic>the law is that</italic>] <italic>we may not remove the pillow or the mattress from under him</italic> [<italic>just</italic>] <italic>because some say that there are feathers from some fowl which cause this</italic> [<italic>prolongation of death</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn107">16</xref></sup> <italic>He may likewise not be moved from his place. It is also forbidden to place the Synagogue keys under his head in order that he may depart</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn108">17</xref></sup> <italic>However, if there is aught which causes a hindrance to the departure of the soul, e.g.</italic>, [<italic>if</italic>] <italic>near that house there is a knocking sound, viz., a wood-cutter, or there is salt on his tongue, and these hinder the departure of the soul, it is permitted to remove it therefrom, for there is no</italic> [<italic>direct</italic>] <italic>act</italic> [<italic>involved</italic>] <italic>in this, since he merely removes the hindrance</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn109">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. One who is informed, &#x2018;We saw your relative in a dying condition three days ago,&#x2019; is bound to mourn for him,<sup><xref rid="fn110">19</xref></sup> <italic>For it is certain that he has already died</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn111">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. <italic>&#x1E92;idduk Haddin</italic><sup><xref rid="fn92">1</xref></sup> is recited when the soul departs,<sup><xref rid="fn112">21</xref></sup> and when he reaches [the words] &#x2018;Judge of Truth,&#x2019; the mourner rends his garments.</p>
<p>4. As soon as he feels death approaching, they should not separate themselves from him, lest his soul depart whilst he is alone.<sup><xref rid="fn113">22</xref></sup> <italic>And it is a religious duty to stand near the</italic> [<italic>dying</italic>] <italic>person during the departure of the soul, as it is written</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn114">23</xref></sup> &#x2018;<italic>That he should still live alway; that he should not see the pit. For he seeth that wise men die, the fool and the brutish together perish etc</italic>.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn115">24</xref></sup></p>

<title>LAWS OF RENDING GARMENTS</title>
</part>
<chapter>
<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 340: THE SUBJECT OF RENDING GARMENTS; THE EXTENT AND REGION THEREOF; FOR WHOM AND WHEN ONE RENDS GARMENTS. Contains thirty-nine paragraphs.</title>
<p><b>LAWS OF RENDING GARMENTS</b><br/>1. One who suffered a bereavement, namely, [one] of [his] near-of-kin<sup><xref rid="fn117">1</xref></sup> [died], for whom he is required to observe mourning rites, must rend [his garments] for him.<sup><xref rid="fn118">2</xref></sup> One must rend [his garments] while standing;<sup><xref rid="fn119">3</xref></sup> and if one rent [his garments] while sitting, he has not discharged his duty;<sup><xref rid="fn120">4</xref></sup> <italic>and he must rend again</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn121">5</xref></sup> <italic>In the first instance one must rend</italic> [<italic>his garments</italic>] <italic>before he conceals the face of the corpse</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn122">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. The region for rending is all along the neck of the garment in the forepart; but if he rent in the back part, <italic>or in the lower parts of the garment</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn123">7</xref></sup> or on the sides, he has not discharged his duty.<sup><xref rid="fn124">8</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>Some say that one discharges his duty if he rends in the lower parts of the garment; and thus is the common practice to adopt the more lenient view</italic>, [<italic>viz.</italic>,] <italic>to rend in the lower parts of the garment</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn125">9</xref></sup> <italic>when rending for all other dead, for whom one does not observe mourning rites;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn126">10</xref></sup> <italic>but for near-of-kin, for whom one must observe mourning rites, he does not discharge his duty with this rending, but must rend in the neck of the garment. And thus is the common practice</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn127">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. The extent of rending is a handbreadth.<sup><xref rid="fn128">12</xref></sup> If he rent [his garment] upon suffering a bereavement, and extends the rent, on sustaining another bereavement; if [the second bereavement] is after the seven [days, the additional rent] may be as small [as he wishes]; if during the seven [days], a handbreadth is required.<sup><xref rid="fn129">13</xref></sup> However, for his father and mother, [after having suffered a previous bereavement], even after seven [days], he rends until he bares his chest.<sup><xref rid="fn130">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. Just as he rends for his near-of-kin, for whom he observes mourning rites, so does he rend in the presence of his near-of-kin, when the latter sustains a bereavement. In what respect? If his son&#x2019;s son dies, or his son&#x2019;s brother,<sup><xref rid="fn131">15</xref></sup> or the mother<sup><xref rid="fn132">16</xref></sup> of his son, he is required to rend in the presence of his son. So too, does he rend for his father-in-law and his mother-in-law, and a woman rends for her father-in-law and her mother-in-law.<sup><xref rid="fn133">17</xref></sup> <italic>Nowadays we do not follow this practice as will be explained infra &#x00A7; 374 in the subject of mourning.</italic></p>
<p>5. One who is present at the time of the departure of the soul of a Jewish man<sup><xref rid="fn134">18</xref></sup> or woman,<sup><xref rid="fn135">19</xref></sup> is dutibound to rend garments;<sup><xref rid="fn136">20</xref></sup> and even if at times [the person who died], committed a sin because of an irresistible desire, or [would] forsake the performance of a religious duty on account of trouble involved.<sup><xref rid="fn137">21</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>But one who was in the habit of committing sins, is not mourned for</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn138">22</xref></sup> <italic>and so much the more for one who is an apostate in respect of idolatry</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn139">23</xref></sup> <italic>Some say that an apostate who was killed by a Gentile</italic>-[<italic>robber</italic>], <italic>is mourned for</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn140">24</xref></sup> <italic>So too</italic>, [<italic>does one mourn for</italic>] <italic>a minor who commits apostasy along with his father or mother</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn141">25</xref></sup> <italic>since he was under pressure</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn142">26</xref></sup> <italic>and some say that we observe no mourning rites</italic> [<italic>for him</italic>], <italic>and this is the</italic> [<italic>accepted</italic>] <italic>fundamental principle</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn143">27</xref></sup> <italic>Those who dissociate themselves from the practices of the community, although they are not mourned for</italic>, [<italic>nevertheless</italic>], <italic>their children are mourned for</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn144">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. For a worthy person,<sup><xref rid="fn145">29</xref></sup> against whom no suspicion is entertained with respect to any sin, or neglect of any religious duty, and who is not ill-reputed,<sup><xref rid="fn146">30</xref></sup> although he is not great in learning,<sup><xref rid="fn147">31</xref></sup> &#x2014; [the law is that] even if one was not present at the time of the departure of the soul, he is dutibound to rend [garments for him], provided he was present there between death and burial.<sup><xref rid="fn148">32</xref></sup> Scholars, however, are exempt from this rending.<sup><xref rid="fn149">33</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>Some say that one is not dutibound to rend</italic> [<italic>garments</italic>] <italic>for a worthy person unless one is present at the time of the departure of the soul; but one is required to weep and to mourn for him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn150">34</xref></sup> <italic>And thus is the accepted practice, to adopt the lenient view</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn151">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. For a scholar or a disciple who is questioned on a matter of <italic>Halachah</italic> in any reference and is able to answer it, one rends garments,<sup><xref rid="fn152">36</xref></sup> even after burial, on the day the [death] report [is received],<sup><xref rid="fn153">37</xref></sup> if it is within thirty days [from death];<sup><xref rid="fn154">38</xref></sup> and one rends [garments] for him at the time of his lament.<sup><xref rid="fn155">39</xref></sup> <italic>If one did not rend</italic> [<italic>garments</italic>] <italic>on the day the</italic> [<italic>death</italic>]-<italic>report</italic> [<italic>is received</italic>], <italic>and the time of the lament had already passed and he</italic> [<italic>still</italic>] <italic>had not rent, he no longer rends</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn156">40</xref></sup> And [garments] are rent for him until the chest is bared;<sup><xref rid="fn157">41</xref></sup> and it is an accepted practice among scholars everywhere to rend [garments] for each other to the extent of a handbreadth, although they are equals and neither is considered a teacher of the other.<sup><xref rid="fn158">42</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>Some say that</italic> [<italic>garments</italic>] <italic>are not rent for a scholar unless the latter is his teacher, or</italic> [<italic>if</italic>] <italic>we know of the novel interpretations which he expounded, for this is</italic> [<italic>what is meant</italic>] <italic>by his teacher&#x2019;;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn159">43</xref></sup> <italic>and thus is the practice to adopt the more lenient view in our countries</italic>.</p>
<p>8. For his teacher from whom he derived the greater part of his wisdom, whether in Bible, Mishna or Gemara,<sup><xref rid="fn160">44</xref></sup> one rends all his garments until he bares his chest.<sup><xref rid="fn161">45</xref></sup> And some say that he rends only to the extent of a handbreadth,<sup><xref rid="fn162">46</xref></sup> and he never resews the rent;<sup><xref rid="fn163">47</xref></sup> even if he receives distant tidings,<sup><xref rid="fn164">48</xref></sup> he must always rend [garments] for him. However, if he did not derive the greater part of his wisdom from him, he rends [garments] for him only according to the law of other dead, for whom he [must] mourn; and even if he learnt from him only a single matter, whether small or great, he must rend [garments] for him.<sup><xref rid="fn165">49</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>Some say that a rent made for one&#x2019;s teacher who is not distinguished</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn166">50</xref></sup> <italic>must also not be resewn</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn167">51</xref></sup> [<italic>With respect to</italic>] <italic>scholars who sit together, debate with, and resolve problems for one another, and study together, some say that they are considered to be in the category of a teacher who is not distinguished; others say that they are in the category of a teacher who is distinguished</italic><sup><xref rid="fn168">52</xref></sup>; [<italic>still</italic>] <italic>others say that</italic> [<italic>garments</italic>] <italic>are to be rent only for one&#x2019;s teacher who taught him the greater part of his knowledge, but for fellow-collegiates who study together or for one who enlightened his eyes in a single matter</italic>, [<italic>rending garments</italic>] <italic>is merely an</italic> [<italic>additional</italic>] <italic>stingency</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn169">53</xref></sup> <italic>and wherever such is the practice, it is followed, and wherever such is not the practice, it is not followed; but we do not rule thus</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn170">54</xref></sup> <italic>Hence it is the common practice to adopt the more lenient view in these countries</italic>.</p>
<p>9. For all other dead, one rends [to the extent of] a hand-breadth in the uppermost garment, and this is sufficient; but for one&#x2019;s father and mother, one rends all his garments, even though he be wearing ten, until he bares his chest.<sup><xref rid="fn171">55</xref></sup> If he did not rend all his garments, he has not discharged his duty,<sup><xref rid="fn172">56</xref></sup> and he is rebuked [for this];<sup><xref rid="fn173">57</xref></sup> and as long as the garment is upon him, he is instructed, &#x2018;Rend&#x0021;,&#x2019; even after thirty days.</p>
<p>10. One is not required to rend his epikarsion.<sup><xref rid="fn174">58</xref></sup> Some explain that it refers to the sweat-shirt, next to his skin;<sup><xref rid="fn175">59</xref></sup> others explain that it refers to he uppermost garment which is called Caffa.<sup><xref rid="fn176">60</xref></sup> And the custom has spread not to rend the Caffa for any dead whatsoever, even [not] for one&#x2019;s father or mother; and to rend for one&#x2019;s father or mother also the garment called chemise.<sup><xref rid="fn177">61</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>In these countries we do not follow this custom</italic>, [<italic>but the law is that</italic>] <italic>we do not rend the linen garment, namely, the sweat-shirt, nor</italic> [<italic>do we rend</italic>] <italic>the top mantle</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn178">62</xref></sup> <italic>but all other garments one must rend for his father or mother</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn179">63</xref></sup> <italic>and in</italic> [<italic>the case of</italic>] <italic>other dead, the top garment under the mantle</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn180">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. Both the man as well as the woman are alike with respect to the law of rending [garments], only that the woman rends her undermost garment [first] and turns it front to back, and then rends her uppermost garment.<sup><xref rid="fn181">65</xref></sup></p> 
<p>12. For all other dead, if one desires, he leaves the upper selvage-border [around the neck] intact, and rends from under the border downwards; for his father or mother he must rend the entire border.<sup><xref rid="fn182">66</xref></sup> <italic>Some say that even for other dead he must rend the border</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn183">67</xref></sup> <italic>And thus is the accepted practice.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn184">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. For all [other] dead one should rend inside, [i.e.,] not in the presence of people. Hence, he brings his hand inside and rends in privacy.<sup><xref rid="fn185">69</xref></sup> However, for one&#x2019;s father and mother one rends only outside, [i.e.,] in the presence of all people.<sup><xref rid="fn186">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. For all other dead, if one desires, he rends with the hand or if he desires he rends with an instrument; for one&#x2019;s father and mother, [one rends] with the hand.<sup><xref rid="fn187">71</xref></sup> For all other dead, if one has occasion to change his garment during the seven days, he changes, but does not rend [afresh]; for one&#x2019;s father and mother, if one changes during the seven days, he rends all the garments [into] which he changes,<sup><xref rid="fn188">72</xref></sup> and never resews the rents, as in the first instance [of rending].<sup><xref rid="fn189">73</xref></sup> <italic>For all other dead, one may turn the rent front to back during seven</italic> [<italic>days</italic>]; <italic>but not for one&#x2019;s father or mother</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn190">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. For all other dead, one bastes the rent together, &#x2014; <italic>this means to sew with irregular stitches</italic> &#x2014; after seven days, and resews the edges after thirty days,<sup><xref rid="fn191">75</xref></sup> <italic>and it matters not whether the Festival occurred therein or not</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn192">76</xref></sup> for one&#x2019;s father or mother, one bastes the rent together after thirty days and never resews the edges;<sup><xref rid="fn193">77</xref></sup> and a woman may baste [the rent] together forthwith out of respect due to her. <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>As long as it is forbidden to baste together, it is likewise forbidden to fasten the edges of the rent with a needle. There are localities where it is customary to be stringent even for other dead, viz., not to baste together within thirty days, and then it is even forbidden to fasten the edges of he rent with a needle</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn194">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. For all other dead, if he desires, he bares his shoulder [in mourning];<sup><xref rid="fn195">79</xref></sup> for his father or mother, he is obliged to bare his shoulder;<sup><xref rid="fn196">80</xref></sup> and thus he walks before the bier until [the corpse] is interred.<sup><xref rid="fn197">81</xref></sup> If the son is a great man and it is not dignified for him to walk with his shoulder bared, he is not dutibound to do so.<sup><xref rid="fn198">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. A <italic>Nasi</italic> is equal to one&#x2019;s father with respect to baring the shoulder [in mourning], rending publicly and resewing the edges.<sup><xref rid="fn199">83</xref></sup> All those who rend garments for a Sage who died, &#x2014; [the law is] that as soon as they have turned away their faces from the rear of the bier, they may baste together the rent<sup><xref rid="fn200">84</xref></sup> and resew the edges on the following day. On receiving the news of the death of a Sage, [after rending the garment], one bastes together the rent on the very same day, and resews the edges the next day;<sup><xref rid="fn201">85</xref></sup> and for a <italic>Nasi</italic> and one&#x2019;s distinguished teacher, one bastes together the next day but never resews the edges.<sup><xref rid="fn202">86</xref></sup> For a Sage one bares the shoulder on the right; for the <italic>Ab Beth Din</italic>, on the left, and for a <italic>Nasi</italic> on both sides.<sup><xref rid="fn203">87</xref></sup> For one&#x2019;s father, mother and distinguished teacher, if he desires he bares either side or if he desires he bares both sides.<sup><xref rid="fn204">88</xref></sup> <italic>Some say that nowadays it is not customary to bare the shoulder at all</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn205">89</xref></sup> <italic>And thus is the accepted practice today.</italic></p>
<p>18. For all other dead, if one did not receive the [death-] report until after thirty days, he does not rend.<sup><xref rid="fn206">90</xref></sup> One who had no garment [at that time that is required to be rent according to law],<sup><xref rid="fn207">91</xref></sup> and [later, a garment that is required to be rent], chanced to come to his hand, &#x2014; [the law is that if the garment was obtained] during the seven [days], he rends [it]; [if] after the seven [days], he does not rend [it]. However, for his father and mother he always<sup><xref rid="fn208">92</xref></sup> rends<sup><xref rid="fn209">93</xref></sup> <italic>all his garments</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn210">94</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. Just as he is forbidden to mend a rent which must not be resewn, so also is it forbidden to turn a garment upside down and resew the rent.<sup><xref rid="fn211">95</xref></sup> Even the one who buys it is forbidden to resew [the rent]. Therefore, the vendor must inform the buyer thereof.<sup><xref rid="fn212">96</xref></sup> And if he sold it to him without specifying and did not inform him [about the rent in the garment], the latter is forbidden to resew the rent until he knows that it is not one of the rents that may not be resewn.<sup><xref rid="fn213">97</xref></sup> It is forbidden to sell it to a Gentile.<sup><xref rid="fn214">98</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. One who rends his garment in a part that has been mended by hemming or chain-stitches, or where the edges were gathered up by cross or ladder-stitch, has not discharged his duty;<sup><xref rid="fn215">99</xref></sup> but if [he rent] in a part that has been reunited by the Alexandrian mending,<sup><xref rid="fn216">100</xref></sup> i.e., by stitching which is even on the surface and projects on the bottom,<sup><xref rid="fn217">101</xref></sup> he has discharged his duty.</p>
<p>21. [If] one rent [his garment] on sustaining a bereavement, and then suffered another bereavement; [if] during the seven days [of the first bereavement], he rends anew;<sup><xref rid="fn218">102</xref></sup> [if] after the seven days, he extends the first rent a little. [If] he suffered a third bereavement after the seven days of the second one, he extends the rent a little;<sup><xref rid="fn219">103</xref></sup> and thus he continues to extend until [the region of] his navel. Having reached the [region of the] navel, &#x2014; [on sustaining another bereavement], he moves away a distance of three fingers [from the previous rent] and rends anew. [If] the forepart [of his garment] has become full [of rents], he turns [the garment] front to back;<sup><xref rid="fn220">104</xref></sup> [if] it becomes full [of rents] in the upper parts, he turns the garment upside down;<sup><xref rid="fn221">105</xref></sup> [if] both these regions have become full [of rents], he is considered as one who has no garment and does not have to rend.<sup><xref rid="fn222">106</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. [If] one was informed that his father died and he rent [his garment], and after seven [days] his son died and he added thereto; the lower part may be resewn but not the upper part. [If] one was informed that his son died and he rent [his garment], and after seven [days] his father died, he does not add thereto, but makes another rent,<sup><xref rid="fn223">107</xref></sup> because [a rent made] for one&#x2019;s father or mother is not added to [a previous rent].<sup><xref rid="fn224">108</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. One who suffered two bereavements simultaneously, or two such reports reached him at the same time, makes one rent for both.<sup><xref rid="fn225">109</xref></sup> [If] after he rent [his garment] he suffered another bereavement <italic>within the seven</italic> [<italic>days</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn226">110</xref></sup> he makes a separate rent, either in the very same rent to which he adds and rends another handbreadth, or he moves away a distance of three fingers and rends a handbreadth; [if] after seven [days], he extends the first rent a little.<sup><xref rid="fn227">111</xref></sup> [If] his father of his mother and one of his [other] near-of-kin died, he rends first for his father or his mother down to [the region of] the heart and moves away [a distance of] three fingers and rends a handbreadth for the other dead. [If] his father died and he rent [his garment] and after seven [days] one of his near-of-kin died, he adds to the first rent; and the lower part may be resewn but not the upper part. [If] one of his near-of-kin died and he rent [his garment], and then his father or his mother died, &#x2014; [the law is that] whether it was during or after the seven [days], he moves away a distance of three fingers and rends on the side in the border of the garment, for he has to separate the selvage-border,<sup><xref rid="fn228">112</xref></sup> and he rends until he reaches the [region of the] heart.<sup><xref rid="fn229">113</xref></sup> [If] his father and his mother died simultaneously, he makes one rent for both.<sup><xref rid="fn230">114</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. [If] one was informed that his father died and he rent [his garment], and then it was discovered that it was his son [who died], he has discharged his duty of rending,<sup><xref rid="fn231">115</xref></sup> provided it became known to him within the period of an utterance.<sup><xref rid="fn232">116</xref></sup> However, if it became known to him after the period of an utterance, he has not discharged his duty. But if he was informed that he suffered a bereavement, and thinking that it was his father, he rent [his garment], and then it was discovered to have been his son [who died], &#x2014; [the law is that] he has discharged his duty, even if it became known to him only after the period of an utterance.<sup><xref rid="fn233">117</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. One who has an invalid who fell into a swoon [and appears to be dead], and he rent [his garment] for him, and subsequently [the invalid] died; if he died within the period of an utterance from the time of rending, he is not dutibound to make another rending, but if not, he requires another rending.<sup><xref rid="fn234">118</xref></sup></p>
<p>26. [If] one was informed that his father died and he rent [his garment] and observed some days of mourning, and subsequently was informed that he did not die, and he discontinued the observance [of mourning rites], after which he was again told that he did die the first time according to the report of the first people, he has discharged his duty of rending.<sup><xref rid="fn235">119</xref></sup></p>
<p>27. [With respect to] a minor who suffered a bereavement, &#x2014; [the law is that] we rend [his garment] for him.<sup><xref rid="fn236">120</xref></sup></p>
<p>28. One who rends [his garments] on the Sabbath for his dead, although he desecrated the Sabbath, has discharged his duty of rending.<sup><xref rid="fn237">121</xref></sup></p>
<p>29. One who rends in a garment that was acquired illegitimately, has not discharged his duty.<sup><xref rid="fn238">122</xref></sup></p>
<p>30. For a child regarding whom we do not know for certain that its months [of pregnancy] were complete, who died within thirty [days from birth] or even on the thirtieth day, we do not rend [garments].<sup><xref rid="fn239">123</xref></sup></p>
<p>31. One does not rend [garments] on a Festival day,<sup><xref rid="fn240">124</xref></sup> even on the second Festival day of the Diaspora;<sup><xref rid="fn241">125</xref></sup> even the near-of-kin of the dead. However, during <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn242">125&#x002A;</xref></sup> one rends according to whatever the case may be, [viz.,] if one is present at the time of the departure of the soul, or if it is for a worthy person or for a scholar; for everyone according to the law as has been explained.<sup><xref rid="fn243">126</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>Some say that it is customary to rend</italic> [<italic>garments</italic>] <italic>during &#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn242">125&#x002A;</xref></sup> <italic>only for one&#x2019;s father and mother, and for all other dead one rends after the Festival</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn244">127</xref></sup> <italic>And in a locality where there is no accepted practice, one must rend for all</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn245">128</xref></sup></p>
<p>32. One who received near tidings during a Festival [i.e., on <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn242">125&#x002A;</xref></sup> must rend [garments] even if after the Festival it becomes distant tidings.<sup><xref rid="fn246">129</xref></sup></p>
<p>33. One who goes forth before the dead with a garment already rent, [and] who makes show that he has rent but actually has not rent [his garment], robs the living and the dead.<sup><xref rid="fn247">130</xref></sup></p>
<p>34. One who says to his friend, &#x2018;Lend me your garment that I may visit my father who is ill,&#x2019; and he went and found him already dead, rends it and resews the rent<sup><xref rid="fn248">131</xref></sup> and returns the garment to him and compensates him for the damage done by the rent. But if he did not inform him [that he is going to visit his father],<sup><xref rid="fn249">132</xref></sup> he must not touch it.<sup><xref rid="fn250">133</xref></sup></p>
<p>35. One who lends his friend a garment to go to the house of mourning, is not permitted to take it back from him until the days of mourning are over.<sup><xref rid="fn251">134</xref></sup> <italic>In &#x1E24;.M. &#x00A7; 341 he</italic> [<italic>Caro</italic>] <italic>does not rule thus</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn252">135</xref></sup></p>
<p>36. One must rend [garments] on hearing evil tidings, e.g., when the majority [of the people] of the community gathered for war and a report was received that they were smitten before their enemies,<sup><xref rid="fn253">136</xref></sup> even if [only] a minority of them was put to death.<sup><xref rid="fn254">137</xref></sup> <italic>Thus also if they went into captivity</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn255">138</xref></sup></p>
<p>37. One who hears the Divine Name,<sup><xref rid="fn256">139</xref></sup> or even an attribute of the Divine Name, blasphemed,<sup><xref rid="fn257">140</xref></sup> &#x2014; <italic>and even if it was uttered in a foreign tongue it is considered an attribute</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn258">141</xref></sup> &#x2014; is dutibound to rend [garments], provided he hears it from an Israelite,<sup><xref rid="fn259">142</xref></sup> &#x2014; <italic>and some say that nowadays an apostate Israelite has the status of a Gentile</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn260">143</xref></sup> and even if one hears it from witnesses [who testify to the effect] that a certain person blasphemed [the Name], is dutibound to rend [garments].<sup><xref rid="fn261">144</xref></sup> The witnesses, however, are not required to rend [their garments] again [on reporting].<sup><xref rid="fn262">145</xref></sup> One who sees a Scroll of Law,<sup><xref rid="fn263">146</xref></sup> or phylacteries,<sup><xref rid="fn264">147</xref></sup> or even one Scroll of the Prophets or Hagioprapha<sup><xref rid="fn265">148</xref></sup> that was burnt,<sup><xref rid="fn266">149</xref></sup> makes two rents,<sup><xref rid="fn267">150</xref></sup> provided only that it is burnt by force,<sup><xref rid="fn268">151</xref></sup> and only in the same manner as it once happened.<sup><xref rid="fn265">148</xref></sup></p> 
<p>38. One who sees the cities of Judea in ruin, or [at the sight of] Jerusalem or the Holy Temple, is dutibound to rend [garments].<sup><xref rid="fn269">152</xref></sup></p>
<p>39.

<ftnote id="fn152">36) <italic>Tur</italic> from <italic>Asheri</italic> who derives this from <italic>RaBaD</italic>, based upon the case of R. Safra M.K. 25a and the case of R. Bun (or Abbun) Y.M.K. III, 7(83b): &#x2018;Just as garments are rent for scholars, so also for their disciples etc.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn153">37) Derived from the above case of R. Safra for whom the Rabbis did not rend their garments. Their reason was that they did not learn from him directly. When Abaye reported to them the teaching that when a scholar dies all are considered his near-of-kin, the Rabbis took the view that what was done was done. However, Abaye said to them, &#x2018;we learnt that if a scholar dies, as long as they are still engaged in a lament for him one is dutibound to rend garments for him. Hence, the ruling here. This is also derived from the case of Samuel (<italic>ibid.</italic> 24a) who, when informed that Rab died, rent thirteen garments for him, and said that the man before whom he trembled is gone. The same was done by R. Jo&#x1E25;anan when the death of R. &#x1E24;anina was reported to him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn154">38) <italic>Ibid.</italic> 20b. If he did not rend garments for him at the time the death report was brought to him, he must rend at the time the lament is made, provided it takes place within the thirty days from death; but after the thirty days one does not rend even at the time that the lament is held &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn232">116) The period of an utterance means the time it takes to extend a greeting. Cf. Naz. 20b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn233">117) Ned. 87a. Thus <italic>Alfasi, Asheri</italic> and <italic>RaN. Ba&#x1E24;</italic> rejects this ruling and states that the individual has not discharged his duty, because his act is not considered unspecified, since he thought it was his father. It would be regarded as unspecified only if he were to rend the garment <italic>&#x2018;for whomever it is&#x2019;</italic> and not to think that it was his father, in which case he would have fulfilled his duty and not have to rend again, even if it becomes known to him after the period of an utterance. This reasoning finds support in <italic>D.M.</italic> on the authority of <italic>N.Yos.</italic>, who writes that if one sustains a bereavement and knows not who it is, and rends garments without specifying for whom he does this, and later discovers who it was, discharges his duty on the principle of <italic>Bererah</italic> (v. Glos.). V. also Yad, <italic>Ebel</italic> VIII, 8; Sem(H) IX, 16; Y. M.K. 7(83c).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn234">118) Cf. Ned. <italic>ibid.; infra</italic> &#x00A7; 375, 1 <italic>Gloss.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn235">119) This is based upon the same principle stated <italic>supra</italic> in par. 25, viz., that another rending is required only if the death did not take place within the period of an utterance from the time of rending. Similarly here, according to the final report he received which verified the first tidings, the rending took place at the proper time. This, however, would not apply were he still alive at the time the first report was brought to him, for then it would be after the period of an utterance &#x2014; <italic>Ta</italic>Z and <italic>ShaK</italic>. In the latter case he would have to recite again the benediction, &#x2018;<italic>Judge of Truth</italic>&#x2019; &#x2014; <italic>Sede &#x1E24;emed</italic>. Regarding the seven day period of mourning which he observed partially, it may be stated that since the mourning took effect through his initial observance, he does not have to complete the days he missed unwillfully. They are, therefore, counted in as part of his period of mourning. This matter, however, requires further study (cf. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 396) &#x2014; <italic>ShaK</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn236">120) M.K. <italic>ibid.</italic> The reason given (<italic>ibid</italic>.) is in order to stir up grief. According to <italic>Ghayyat</italic> the law of rending the minor&#x2019;s garments falls into the same category as all other religious duties into which minor children must be introduced. <italic>B.Yos.</italic> states that this is done even when the reason to stir up grief does not apply. <italic>Derisha</italic> holds that a minor who has reached the age when children are introduced into religious practices, must also observe all rites of mourning. This viewpoint is accepted by <italic>Ta</italic>Z. <italic>ShaK</italic> in <italic>Nek. HaK</italic>. rejects this comparison. His reason is that only when the minor becomes of age during the seven days of mourning does the problem arise whether he should observe seven complete days of mourning. But if he is still a minor (less than thirteen years plus one day) this problem does not apply. <italic>D.Merb.</italic> agrees with <italic>ShaK.</italic> His reason is that by requiring him to observe the mourning rites, we thereby cause him to neglect the study of the Torah, which is not so in the case of rending garments. Cf. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 396, 3, notes 10-11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn237">121) Shab. 105b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn238">122) <italic>Tur</italic> on the authority of <italic>N</italic>, who derives it from Y. Shab. XIII, 3(14a). This case differs from the one mentioned in the previous par., since here the object proper was obtained illegitimately and the rending is regarded as a religious act achieved through a wrong deed (cf. Suk. 30a) ; whereas in the former case only the act of rending was a sin.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn239">123) Shab. 136b, because the rending of garments is a Rabbinical enactment and in a doubtful case we follow the more lenient view&#x2014; <italic>Ta</italic>Z. But when we know for certain that its months were complete we must rend garments and observe mourning rites &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn240">124) Mishna, M.K. 24b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn241">125) Yad, <italic>Ebel</italic> XI, 1 and <italic>N.</italic> In the Diaspora every Festival which is observed for one day is kept for two days because of doubt. For example, Passover occurs on the fifteenth of <italic>Nisan.</italic> It was necessary, therefore, to know when the New Moon appears in order to determine when the Festival was to be fixed. This was done through the testimony of witnesses. However, this applied only to the thirtieth day of the month, but the thirty-first day could be consecrated even without the confirmation of witnesses, since the moon renewed itself about every twenty-nine and a half days. Those who lived in the Land of Israel proper were easily contacted through messengers who were sent out to inform the people whether the <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> in the city of Jerusalem had consecrated the thirtieth or the thirty-first day of the month, thus making the month just passed full or defective. Hence, those who lived in the Diaspora could not be informed in time and because of doubt observed two Festival days. E.g., Passover was kept on the fifteenth and the sixteenth of <italic>Nisan.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn243">126) M.K. <italic>ibid.</italic>, Mishna and Gem. V. <italic>Mishna le-Melek</italic>, Yad, <italic>Ebel ibid.</italic>, who writes that for one who died and was interred (by Gentiles) on the first Festival day, he is not permitted to rend garments during the Festival week (<italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic>), but must postpone the rending until after the entire Festival is over, at which time mourning rites take effect. But if one suffered a bereavement during the Festival week, he is permitted to rend garments immediately after death at the moment of excitement (cf. O.&#x1E24;. &#x00A7; 547, 3) &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn244">127) <italic>Ter. Had.</italic> &#x00A7; 288 &#x2014; <italic>G</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn245">128) According to the custom not to rend garments during <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic>, a distinction is made between one&#x2019;s parents and other near-of-kin ; and according to the custom to rend garments during <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic> (which finds support in Mishna <italic>ibid.</italic>), one must rend for all near-of-kin &#x2014; <italic>Ta</italic>Z. And even with respect to the former opinion, not to rend garments during <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic>, it applies only if it is still possible to rend after the Festival, but where during the Festival the tidings are &#x2018;near,&#x2019; and after the Festival they become &#x2018;distant&#x2019;, the law is that we rend during <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic> &#x2014; <italic>Ba&#x1E24;.</italic> For &#x2018;distant tidings one does not rend during <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic>, even for parents, since the mourning rites are over, consequently the rending is also not made &#x2014; <italic>RaShaL.</italic> Cf. O.&#x1E24;. &#x00A7; 546, 6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn246">129) <italic>Tur</italic> citing <italic>N.</italic> According to the Talmud, rending of garments and observance of mourning for seven days are interrelated, &#x2018;There is no rending without seven days (of mourning).&#x2019; It might have been thought that in the present case one should not rend garments, since the mourning rites will not be observed after the Festival but for one day, for then the tidings become distant. We are therefore, informed in this par. otherwise. For the interrelationship between rending and mourning applies only if one receives the death report on the Festival day proper, when it is forbidden to rend garments, and after the entire Festival it becomes distant tidings, at which time the mourning rites are completely suspended but for one day. In such a case only do we apply the aforementioned principle, &#x2018;There is no rending without mourning.&#x2019; However, when near tidings are received during <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic>, when rending garments is permissible (v. <italic>supra</italic> par. 31), he rends even if it becomes distant tidings after the Festival. For the Festival merely interrupts the mourning rites but not the rending &#x2014; <italic>Ta</italic>Z and <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn247">130) M.K. 26b. For he thereby deceives everyone.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn248">131) Although the law is that for a father we must never resew the edges of the rent (cf. <italic>supra</italic> par. 15), in this case it is different, since he was only given implicit permission to rend the garment, in order to avoid embarrassment to the borrower, but he was never given acquisition rights. Consequently, he mends the rent &#x2014; <italic>Ta</italic>Z and <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn249">132) He did not express the wish to visit his sick father.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn250">133) M.K. <italic>ibid.</italic> Cf. Sem(H). IX, 20. And even if he rends the garment, he has not discharged his duty, for he is regarded as a borrower without the knowledge of the owner, who is considered under such circumstances a robber (Cf. <italic>supra</italic> par. 29) &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn251">134) Cf. Sem(H). <italic>ibid.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn252">135) There is no contradiction between these rulings. In &#x1E24;.M. we deal with a case of one who borrows <span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D5;&#x05D0;&#x05DC;</span> a garment from his friend in order to visit a house of mourning and return, i.e., the borrower himself made this request of the lender. Therefore, since the lender agreed to accomodate the borrower, he may say, &#x2018;I loaned you the garment for one day only,&#x2019; i.e., to go and return. In our present case, it was the lender <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05E9;&#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05DC;</span> who approached the borrower to go and perform the condolence rites. Hence, this precept rests upon the borrower every day of the seven days of mourning, and therefore, the lender must not demand the return of the garment before the entire period of mourning is over &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn253">136) M.K. <italic>ibid.</italic> Derived from, <italic>&#x2018;Then David took hold of his clothes and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him. And they wailed and wept and fasted until even, for Saul and for Jonathan his son and for the people of the Lord and for the house of Israel, because they were fallen by the sword&#x2019;</italic> (II Sam. I, 11-12). From this verse it appears that one must observe mourning rites all day. Therefore, the rent should be stitched together the following day. Likewise, may the rent be resewn on the next day &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> This latter statement of <italic>ShaK</italic>, viz., that &#x2018;the rent may be resewn the next day&#x2019; is attacked by the commentators (v. <italic>P.Tesh</italic>.), for according to the Talmud (v. also <italic>infra</italic> par. 39), a rent made on hearing evil tidings must never be resewn. It is, however, possible, that <italic>ShaK</italic> refers not to this case, but to other cases, viz., where a rent may be resewn, and on the basis of the above-mentioned verse, he holds that this should be done, not on the day the mourning rites are over, but rather on the following day.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 341: ONE WHOSE DEAD LIES BEFORE HIM ON THE SABBATH OR THE FESTIVAL AND THE LAWS OF THE ONEN.<sup><xref rid="fn272">1</xref></sup> Contains six paragraphs.</title>
<p><b>LAWS OF ANINUTH</b><br/>1. One who suffered a bereavement for whom he is dutibound to observe mourning rites,<sup><xref rid="fn273">2</xref></sup> &#x2014; [the law is that] before burial,<sup><xref rid="fn274">3</xref></sup> he eats in another house [room].<sup><xref rid="fn275">4</xref></sup> [If] he has no other house, he eats in his friend&#x2019;s house; [if] his friend has no house [available],<sup><xref rid="fn276">5</xref></sup> he makes him a partition<sup><xref rid="fn277">6</xref></sup> and eats;<sup><xref rid="fn278">7</xref></sup> even a partition of a sheet is sufficient, [provided] he fastened the bottom of the sheet in a manner that it would not be moved by an [ordinary] wind;<sup><xref rid="fn279">8</xref></sup> and if he has not the wherewithal to make a partition, he turns away his face and eats.<sup><xref rid="fn278">7</xref></sup> Whichever the case may be; even if he is in another city,<sup><xref rid="fn280">9</xref></sup> he does not eat reclining,<sup><xref rid="fn281">10</xref></sup> and he eats not meat nor drinks wine,<sup><xref rid="fn282">11</xref></sup> nor does he recite the benediction before meals,<sup><xref rid="fn283">12</xref></sup> nor does he say grace after meals, nor do others recite the benediction [before meals] on his behalf, nor does he join in grace after meals.<sup><xref rid="fn284">13</xref></sup> Even if he eats with others he should not repeat <italic>Amen</italic> after them [when they recite the benediction before meals].<sup><xref rid="fn285">14</xref></sup> And he is exempt from [the performance] of all religious duties enjoined in the Torah,<sup><xref rid="fn286">15</xref></sup> even if he is not required to attend to the preparations needed for the dead, e.g., [when] he has others who attend to [this] for him.<sup><xref rid="fn287">16</xref></sup> And some say that even if he desires to adopt for himself a stricter view, [viz.,] to recite the benediction [before meals], or to repeat <italic>Amen</italic> after those who recite the benediction [before meals], he is not permitted [to do so].<sup><xref rid="fn288">17</xref></sup> And on the Sabbath or Festival, he eats meat and drinks wine,<sup><xref rid="fn289">18</xref></sup> <italic>if he so desires</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn290">19</xref></sup> and recites the benediction [before meals] and is dutibound to perforrm all religious duties save the use of the conjugal couch wherein he is forbidden,<sup><xref rid="fn291">20</xref></sup> <italic>and he is permitted to go to the Synagogue on the Sabbath, and even on weekdays there is no prohibition, but since he is forbidden to recite the prayers</italic> [<italic>on weekdays</italic>], <italic>what will he do there</italic>?<sup><xref rid="fn292">21</xref></sup> If one must go to await nightfall at the Sabbath limit to [be ready] to attend to the preparations needed for the dead [at the exit of the Sabbath], the observance of <italic>Aninuth</italic> rests upon him, insofar as the prohibition extends to everything from the moment he begins to go to await nightfall at the Sabbath limit.<sup><xref rid="fn293">22</xref></sup> If he wishes to bury him on the first Festival day by Gentiles, the prohibition extends to everything;<sup><xref rid="fn294">23</xref></sup> so much the more on the second Festival day, when he himself may bury him, that all the laws of <italic>Aninuth</italic> rest upon him.<sup><xref rid="fn295">24</xref></sup> <italic>Some say that a student who observes Aninuth rites for his distinguished teacher is forbidden to eat meat or</italic> [<italic>drink</italic>] <italic>wine as long as the dead lies in one&#x2019;s presence</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn296">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. One who suffered a bereavement on the Sabbath,<sup><xref rid="fn297">26</xref></sup> may eat on the night following the Sabbath without reciting the <italic>Habdalah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn298">27</xref></sup> nor the evening or the morning <italic>Tefillah</italic> prior to burial; and after burial, one should recite the morning <italic>Tefillah</italic> if its prescribed time limit has not lapsed;<sup><xref rid="fn299">28</xref></sup> but the [preceding] evening <italic>Tefillah</italic> one should not recite, since its prescribed time limit has already lapsed;<sup><xref rid="fn300">29</xref></sup> and this is not similar to the case of one who forgot to recite the evening <italic>Tefillah</italic>, who may recite the morning <italic>Tefillah</italic> twice,<sup><xref rid="fn301">30</xref></sup> since he was not dutibound to recite the <italic>Tefillah</italic> during the [previous] night.<sup><xref rid="fn302">31</xref></sup> With respect to the <italic>Habdalah</italic>, one should recite [it] after the corpse is buried.<sup><xref rid="fn303">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. [In] a locality where it is the accepted practice that pall-bearers are apointed to take out the corpse [for burial], and after the near-of-kin attend to the burial needs, they give him<sup><xref rid="fn304">33</xref></sup> over to them<sup><xref rid="fn305">34</xref></sup> and they bury him, &#x2014; [the law is] that as soon as they<sup><xref rid="fn306">35</xref></sup> gave him over to them,<sup><xref rid="fn305">34</xref></sup> the near-of-kin are permitted to [eat] meat and [drink] wine,<sup><xref rid="fn307">36</xref></sup> even before they take him out of the house,<sup><xref rid="fn308">37</xref></sup> since the [burial] no longer rests upon them.<sup><xref rid="fn306">35</xref></sup> [<italic>In</italic>] <italic>a locality where the corpse is borne from one city to another</italic> [<italic>for burial</italic>], <italic>if it is a near place, it is as though he</italic><sup><xref rid="fn304">33</xref></sup> <italic>lies before him</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn306">35</xref></sup> <italic>but if it is a distant place, e.g., a journeying distance of two days, it is permissible</italic> [<italic>for the near-of-kin to eat meat and drink wine</italic>] <italic>until they arrive at the city where the burial</italic> [<italic>will take place</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn309">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. If one died in prison and was not given over for burial,<sup><xref rid="fn310">39</xref></sup> the observance of <italic>Aninuth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn311">40</xref></sup> as well as mourning does not take effect upon the near-of-kin,<sup><xref rid="fn312">41</xref></sup> since they have not given up hope of burying him.<sup><xref rid="fn313">42</xref></sup> Likewise, if the near-of-kin of the dead person are in prison, the observance of <italic>Aninuth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn311">40</xref></sup> does not take effect upon them.<sup><xref rid="fn314">43</xref></sup> So too, if one was murdered on the road or a beast dragged him away or if a stream carried him off and they have not given up hope of burying him, the law of <italic>Aninuth</italic> or of mourning does not take effect upon the near-of-kin. And one counts for him the seven and the thirty [days] from the day that they give up hope of burying him.<sup><xref rid="fn315">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. As long as the corpse is not buried one does not remove his shoes or sandals and is not required to [perform] the muffling of the head,<sup><xref rid="fn316">45</xref></sup> nor the overturning of the couch,<sup><xref rid="fn317">46</xref></sup> but one is forbidden to sit or sleep on a couch even if it is overturned.<sup><xref rid="fn318">47</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>So much the more that one is forbidden to use the conjugal couch;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn319">48</xref></sup> <italic>and some say that he is prohibited against bathing, annointing, rejoicing, greeting, haircutting and work</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn320">49</xref></sup> <italic>but he is permitted to leave his house</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn321">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. The one who guards the corpse, even if it is not his own dead, is exempt from the reading of the <italic>Shema</italic> and from all religious duties enjoined in the Torah. If there were two [watchmen], one guards and the other reads<sup><xref rid="fn322">51</xref></sup>.</p>

<ftnote id="fn292">21) <italic>Kol Bo</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> In order to clarify many rulings pertaining to the period of <italic>Aninuth</italic>, it should be observed that a difference of opinion exists among the <italic>Codifiers</italic> as to whether matters forbidden during the mourning period are likewise prohibited during <italic>Aninuth.</italic> a) <italic>Maim.</italic> in Yad, <italic>Ebel</italic> I, 2; <italic>RITBA</italic> (M.K. 15) ; <italic>Tur</italic> (a.l. and <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 398) state that <italic>Aninuth</italic> and mourning rites are not <italic>on an</italic> equal footing.

<ftnote id="fn300">29) And on the preceding night he was entirely exempt therefrom. This is applicable only to a case where one suffered a loss on the Sabbath before the night set in, so that the obligation of reciting the evening <italic>Tefillah</italic> never took effect.

<ftnote id="fn302">31) <italic>Derisha</italic> holds that similarly one who occupies himself with communal needs which interfere with the prescribed time to pray is exempt from a complementary <italic>Tefillah</italic> at the following service (v. previous note). For in both cases, viz., in the case of the sustained loss mentioned above, and in the case of preoccupation with communal needs, there is unavoidable interference. <italic>Ta</italic>Z opposes this and makes the following distinction between the two cases : In the case of a sustained loss the interference is a result, not of the individual&#x2019;s incapacity to recite prayers, but rather of external circumstances, namely, the <italic>Aninuth</italic> which exempts him. Under such conditions one is not required to recite a complementary prayer at the following service. But in the case of preoccupation with communal needs, the individual proper is busily engaged. Hence, he is dutibound to make up the prayer when he becomes free. <italic>Nek. Hak.</italic> refutes <italic>Ta</italic>Z and agrees with <italic>Derisha</italic>, by showing that both cases are on an equal footing insofar as in both instances the individual is legally exempt on the principle that, &#x2018;One who is engaged in a religious act is exempt from other religious duties&#x2019; (Suk. 25a). When, however, the person is legally not exempt, but there it an unavoidable interference, the <italic>Tefillah</italic> is temporarily suspended until the following service at which time a complementary prayer is said.</ftnote>

Later in his <italic>Decisions</italic>, he abandoned this view and accepted the view of R. Judah (<italic>ibid.</italic> Cf. <italic>Tur</italic> a.l.) who held that one should not recite the <italic>Habdalah</italic> after (burial. V. <italic>Ta</italic>Z <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 396 who disagrees with both views and advances another explanation. After burial when the <italic>Habdalah</italic> prayer is recited it is said only over a cup of wine without the fragrant spices and the candle. If the bereavement was sustained on a Festival day, the <italic>Habdalah</italic> prayer may be said only on the following day after burial, but not as in the case of the Sabbath where the law is that it may be said even until the third day. An <italic>Onen</italic> who was ignorant of this ruling and recited the <italic>Habdalah</italic> on the night following the Sabbath is not required to recite it again after burial &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> On the question whether an <italic>Onen</italic> who has a child to be circumcised should perform the circumcision before or after burial, a difference of opinion exists among the <italic>Codifiers. RaShaL</italic> maintains that the circumcision should be performed first. <italic>Isserles</italic> (in <italic>Resp.</italic>) holds that first the burial should be held, for being an <italic>Onen</italic> he cannot recite the benediction, &#x2018;Blessed art Thou &#x2026; and commanded us to introduce my son into the covenant of Abraham our father.&#x2019; <italic>Ta</italic>Z rules that if possible, the burial should be held in the morning. However, if this is not feasible, the circumcision is performed first and the <italic>Sandek</italic> recites the benediction, and it matters not whether the circumcision is held during the prescribed time, i.e., on the eight day or later. <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic> accepts <italic>RaShaL&#x2019;s</italic> ruling. <italic>Bir. Yos.</italic> and others agree with <italic>Ta</italic>Z. A <italic>Kohen</italic> who is an <italic>Onen</italic>, and there is no other <italic>Kohen</italic> available, may officiate at the redemption of a firstborn.

<p><b>LAWS OF MOURNING</b><br/>1.

<ftnote id="fn323">1) <italic>Ba&#x1E24;</italic> states that this obtains only if all the wedding preparations were made.

<ftnote id="fn327">5) Ket. 3b-4a. Even if the groom&#x2019;s mother died or other near-of-kin, in which case there is still his father available to make all the preparations at a future date, nevertheless, since the bride has no one available to make her preparations in addition to the loss involved at present, the wedding is not postponed, and they are brought into the bridal chamber as stated anon. Nowadays if a parent dies the wedding is postponed until after the seven days of mourning &#x2014; <italic>Ba&#x2019;er Heteb, &#x1E24;atam Sofer.</italic> On the eve of Passover after midday it is permissible for a groom or bride who are in mourning to be married, since with the advent of the Passover Festival and the period of counting the <italic>Omer</italic> that follows it is forbidden to hold marriages. This is in accord with <italic>Isserles&#x2019;</italic> ruling (v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 399) that after midday on the eve of a Festival mourning rites have no legal effect, <italic>contra ShaK</italic> (<italic>ibid.</italic>). This applies to a groom who was never married before and did not yet comply with the duty of propagation &#x2014; <italic>Zekor le-Abraham, Net&#x2019;a Sorek.</italic> If they suffered a loss after the marriage was already performed, the groom must not perform the marital act until after the seven days of mourning, after which, follow the seven days of the wedding-feast (v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 383). One who was in a dying condition and instructed his daughter&#x2019;s marriage to take place and he died after the dutiful marital act had already been performed, the law is that the daughter is not permitted to attend the funeral, since it is already regarded as a Festival period for her, and were she to attend the funeral, it would be considered tantamount to observing mourning rites publicly on a Festival which is forbidden &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn331">9) The law is that on the first day mourning rites are Rabbinical (v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 399, 13).

A. Eeger</italic> a.l. It may be asked, however, how is it possible for the seven days of the wedding-feast to override a case of Biblical mourning, for the day of death and burial is considered Biblical (it is only when the burial is not held on the same day as death that the first day of mourning is Rabbinical)? This difficulty may be removed because the first day of a groom&#x2019;s marriage is considered Biblical, for it is written, <italic>&#x2018;In the day of his espousals and in the day of the gladness of his heart&#x2019;</italic> (Song of Songs III, 11) &#x2014; <italic>Asheri.</italic> Although an <italic>Onen</italic> is forbidden the use of the conjugal couch (v. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 341), the Rabbis were lenient in this case and put it on an equal footing with one who had given up hope of burying his dead in which case he is permitted to eat meat and drink wine and use the conjugal couch &#x2014; <italic>RITBA.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn332">10) As to the question of rending garments, there is a difference of opinion among the authorities. <italic>MaHaRIL</italic> (Laws of Mourning) states that the garments are rent after the seven days of the wedding-feast. <italic>She&#x2019;elath Yabe&#x1E93;</italic> maintains that garments should be rent forthwith since it is not a Biblical Festival. <italic>Sede &#x1E24;emed</italic> accepts <italic>MaHaRIL&#x2019;s</italic> ruling. <italic>Mishmereth Shalom</italic> agrees with <italic>Yabe&#x1E93;.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn333">11) Yad, <italic>Ebel</italic> XI, 8. <italic>Tur</italic> on the authority of <italic>RaBaD</italic> writes that he is only forbidden to use the conjugal couch or to be alone with her, but the mixing of the cup, the making of the bed and the washing of his face, hands and feet are permitted to be done in each other&#x2019;s presence. <italic>ShaK</italic> rejects this on the basis of numerous sources in the Talmud and Codes and extends the prohibition to embracing and kissing as well.</ftnote>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 344: THE OBLIGATION [TO MAKE] A FUNERARY LAMENTATION; THE GREATNESS OF ITS [DIVINE] REWARD; IN WHAT MANNER ONE MAKES A LAMENTATION AND FOR WHOM. Contains twenty paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. It is an important religious duty to lament the dead fittingly;<sup><xref rid="fn352">1</xref></sup> and the religious duty [is fulfilled] when one raises his voice [in funereal lamentations] to utter over him [the dead] words which break the heart in order to cause much weeping, and to mention his praise.<sup><xref rid="fn353">2</xref></sup> It is forbidden to over-praise him too much, save to mention his good characteristic features [to which] a little may be added,<sup><xref rid="fn354">3</xref></sup> provided one does not overexaggerate. And if he possessed no good characteristic features whatever, one should not mention [this] regarding him. [With respect to] a Sage and a pious man one may mention their wisdom and piety [respectively].<sup><xref rid="fn355">4</xref></sup> And one who mentions [aught] regarding one who did not possess [it] at all, or exaggerates too much that which he did possess, causes harm to himself<sup><xref rid="fn356">5</xref></sup> and to the dead.<sup><xref rid="fn357">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. Just as [funerary] lamentations are made for men, so too, are [funerary] lamentations made for women as is fitting for them.<sup><xref rid="fn358">7</xref></sup> <italic>And they are lamented amongst men and scholars</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn359">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. In a locality where it is customary to hire wailing women to make the lamentation, one is dutibound to hire wailing women to make the lamentation for his wife. If he [the husband] was unwilling [to provide wailing women], her father comes and provides [this] and collects from him [the husband] against his will.<sup><xref rid="fn360">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. How old must an infant be with respect to making a lamentation for him? &#x2014; With respect to the poor<sup><xref rid="fn361">10</xref></sup> [a lamentation is made] for children of five years old; with respect to the rich, for children of six years old, and with respect to the children of elders, they are [regarded] as the children of the poor.<sup><xref rid="fn362">11</xref></sup> However, one should recite Z<italic>idduk Haddin</italic> and <italic>Kaddish</italic> for an infant [who died] after thirty days have passed [from birth].<sup><xref rid="fn363">12</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>We do not follow this practice</italic><sup><xref rid="fn364">13</xref></sup> <italic>unless the infant is twelve months old</italic><sup><xref rid="fn365">14</xref></sup> <italic>and is taken out</italic> [<italic>for burial</italic>] <italic>on a bier as explained infra</italic> &#x00A7; 353, <italic>par.</italic> 5.</p>
<p>5. [In the case of] the children of the rich and the children of scholars, one may add a little to the praise of their deeds.<sup><xref rid="fn366">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. For a child who knows how to argue,<sup><xref rid="fn367">16</xref></sup> a lamentation is made on account of his own deeds; and if he has no deeds, a lamentation is made for him on account of his parents&#x2019; deeds;<sup><xref rid="fn368">17</xref></sup> and if they [the parents] possess no deeds, a lamentation is made for them<sup><xref rid="fn369">18</xref></sup> on account of the deeds of his relatives.<sup><xref rid="fn370">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. For a<sup><xref rid="fn371">20</xref></sup> daughter-in-law a lamentation is made both on account of her father&#x2019;s deeds as well as on account of her husband&#x2019;s deeds.<sup><xref rid="fn372">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. [For an embryo that came out] by pieces or with its feet foremost;<sup><xref rid="fn373">22</xref></sup> for premature-born children; for a [viable] birth [which takes place after] eight [months of pregnancy] or a still birth [after] nine [months of pregnancy]; for a heathen or slaves, one does not engage in making a lamentation nor does one follow the funeral procession.<sup><xref rid="fn374">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. Heirs who refuse to pay the honorarium of the funerary orator are made to pay against their will.<sup><xref rid="fn375">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. One who left instructions that no lamentation be made for him, is obeyed.<sup><xref rid="fn376">25</xref></sup> <italic>But if one instructed not to observe for him the seven or the restrictions of the thirty</italic> [<italic>days of mourning</italic>] <italic>is not obeyed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn377">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. The prohibition against tearing the hair or lacerating the flesh [in token of mourning] for a dead person, is found [supra] &#x00A7; 180.</p>
<p>12. The people who are engaged in the lamentation, as long as the corpse lies before them, they slip out one by one and read the <italic>Shema</italic> and recite the <italic>Tefillah</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn378">27</xref></sup> [if] the corpse does not lie before them,<sup><xref rid="fn379">28</xref></sup> they sit and read [the <italic>Shema</italic>] and the <italic>Onen</italic> sits in silence;<sup><xref rid="fn380">29</xref></sup> they stand and recite the <italic>Tefillah</italic> and he acknowledges the justice of the [Divine] verdict, and says, &#x2018;May it be Thy Will, O Lord, my God, that Thou repare our breaches and the breaches of Thy people the House of Israel.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn381">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. After burial, the lamentation is interrupted both for the purpose of reading the <italic>Shema</italic> as well as [the recital of] the <italic>Tefillah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn382">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. Two lamentations<sup><xref rid="fn383">32</xref></sup> are not made [simultaneously] in the same city, unless there is a multitude of people that could be divided into two [groups, so that] at every lamentation there will be a sufficient number of people [present].<sup><xref rid="fn384">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. Two lamentations<sup><xref rid="fn385">34</xref></sup> are not made [simultaneously] in the same city, unless there is [a funerary orator available] in order to tell the praises of one [dead] and [another funerary orator to tell] the praises of the other [dead].<sup><xref rid="fn386">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. One may discuss in the presence of the corpse only those matters which concern the dead person, e.g., [matters pertaining to] his burial needs and lamentation; but all other matters are forbidden.<sup><xref rid="fn387">36</xref></sup> And this ruling obtains only with respect to Torah discussions, but in [the case of] secular matters we do not mind.<sup><xref rid="fn388">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. It is permissible to recite Biblical verses and [render] expositions in honour of the dead person<sup><xref rid="fn389">38</xref></sup> within his four cubits,<sup><xref rid="fn390">39</xref></sup> or on the cemetery.<sup><xref rid="fn391">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. When a <italic>Hakam</italic><sup><xref rid="fn392">41</xref></sup> dies, his Academy is in recess, for they make a lamentation for him throughout the seven [days of mourning]; but [all] the other Academies engage in [the study of] the Torah, even during the time that the lamentation is held; and after the lamentation his disciples do not assemble in his Academy,<sup><xref rid="fn393">42</xref></sup> but join in pairs and study at their homes.<sup><xref rid="fn394">43</xref></sup> When an <italic>Ab Beth Din</italic><sup><xref rid="fn392">41</xref></sup> dies, all the Academies of the city are in recess, and those who are in the habit of saying their prayers [the <italic>Tefillah</italic>] in the Synagogue, change their [customary] places.<sup><xref rid="fn395">44</xref></sup> When a <italic>Nasi</italic><sup><xref rid="fn392">41</xref></sup> dies, all Academies, wherever a lamentation is made for him, are in recess; and after the lamentation, they do not enter the Academy, but join in pairs and study at their homes, and all the townspeople say their prayers [the <italic>Tefillah</italic>] in the house of mourning, both on a weekday and on the Sabbath save the reading of [the weekly portions] of the Torah on the Sabbath, the second and the fifth [days of the week] which they read in the Synagogue. And they should not walk about in the street, but they sit [at home] in family groups and feel the affliction all day.<sup><xref rid="fn396">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. Lamentations are made for scholars and their wives in the Synagogue and in the Academy, but not for the rest of the people.<sup><xref rid="fn397">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. A <italic>Hakam</italic><sup><xref rid="fn392">41</xref></sup> or an <italic>Aluf</italic><sup><xref rid="fn392">41</xref></sup> or a <italic>Gaon</italic><sup><xref rid="fn392">41</xref></sup> is brought into the Academy<sup><xref rid="fn398">47</xref></sup> and the bier is placed on the spot where he used to lecture and a lamentation is made for him there, and when they take the bier out they make a lamentation for him until [they reach] the cemetery, and on the seventh day they go up to the cemetery and visit him,<sup><xref rid="fn399">48</xref></sup> and likewise on the thirtieth day, and [thus] for twelve complete months they visit [him] and recite the <italic>Hashkabah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn392">41</xref></sup></p>

One must however, attend to the preparations of the bier and the burial &#x2014; <italic>Tur.</italic> Although we have seen (<italic>supra</italic> par. 4) that a lamentation is never made for a child before it is five years old, and the present case would follow <italic>a fortiori</italic>, nevertheless, in the case of a normal birth one may, if he so desires, have a lamentation made even prior to that age. Not so, however, in the cases enumerated here &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn375">24) In accord with the final decision of the Talmud (San. 46b) that a funeral lamentation is made in honour of the dead and not the living. Hence, the heirs cannot dispense with it and are obliged to pay. For this reason we comply with the instructions of a person who dies that no lamentation be made for him. V. also &#x1E24;.M. &#x00A7; 253, 30. This law however, is applicable only if the heirs inherited the estate of the deceased. Otherwise, they cannot be made to pay the honorarium against their will (v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 348, 2) &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn376">25) San. <italic>ibid.</italic> However, if a prominent scholar leaves such instructions he may be disobeyed. Cases are cited by the <italic>Codifiers</italic> where such instructions left by very prominent scholars, were not followed &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> Others make no distinction between illiterate or learned people with respect to this ruling. In both cases no funeral oration should be pronounced &#x2014; <italic>Bir. Yos.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn377">26) <italic>MaHaRIW</italic> s. 7 &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Some hold, <italic>contra Isserles</italic>, that even with respect to the observance of the seven days of mourning and the rending of garments, the instructions of the deceased should be obeyed, since these too, fall into the category of &#x2018;honouring the dead.&#x2019; Others agree with <italic>Isserles</italic> &#x2014; <italic>P. Tesh.</italic> V. however, <italic>R. A. Eger</italic> a.l. If parents instructed children not to observe the mourning period of twelve months, their wishes should be carried out. The reason for this is that since this mourning period applies to parents only and not to other dead, it becomes part of the Biblical injunction of &#x2018;honouring parents&#x2019; &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> If one instructs that the <italic>Kaddish</italic> be not recited for him, he is obeyed &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn378">27) Were this permitted in the presence of the dead, it would be considered &#x2018;mocking or deriding the poor,&#x2019; i.e. the dead (v. Prov. XVII, 5). Cf. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 341, n. 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn379">28) I.e., either the lamentation is not made in the same room wherein the corpse lies, or if in the same room, not within four cubits of the dead.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn382">31) O.H. &#x00A7; 72 &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> This ruling follows from <italic>supra</italic> par. 12. According to <italic>N</italic> in <italic>T.H.</italic> (who, it seems had a different reading in Y. <italic>ibid.</italic>), before burial, in the presence of the dead, one may slip out to read the <italic>Shema</italic> but not to recite the <italic>Tefillah, contra Caro</italic> (<italic>supra</italic> par. 12) &#x2014; <italic>W.G.</italic></ftnote>

Matters which concern the dead, if they fall into the category of Torah discussions, are permitted within the four cubits. The common practice is to expound Aggadic material and Biblical verses leading to the praise of the dead, even within his four cubits (v. <italic>infra</italic> par. 17). The entire room in which a corpse lies is considered four cubits &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> Cf. also Shab. 153a; Y.Naz. VII, 1(56a); Sem(H). III, 6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn389">38) Contrary to those whose sole desire is to demonstrate their speaking ability &#x2014; <italic>Ta</italic>Z. If one receives a report of a death after twelve months had elapsed from the time of death, a lamentation is no longer made &#x2014; <italic>T.H.</italic></ftnote>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 345: THE LAW REGARDING ONE WHO COMMITS SUICIDE WILFULLY; AN EXCOMMUNICANT; THOSE EXECUTED BY COURT; AND ONE WHO DISSOCIATES HIMSELF FROM [THE PRACTICES] OF THE COMMUNITY. Contains eight paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. One who commits suicide wilfully is not attended to at all;<sup><xref rid="fn400">1</xref></sup> and one does not mourn for him and no lamentation is made for him, nor does one rend [garments] or bare [the shoulder in mourning for him], but one stands for him in the line [of comforters], and one recites over him the mourners&#x2019; blessing, and whatever [brings] honour [only] to the living [may be done].<sup><xref rid="fn401">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. Who is [considered] a wilful suicide? &#x2014; For example, if one stated that he is going up to the roof-top, and they saw him go up at once in anger; or he was in distress, and [then] fell down<sup><xref rid="fn402">3</xref></sup> and died, &#x2014; [the law is that] such a person is presumed to have committed suicide wilfully. But if they discovered him<sup><xref rid="fn403">4</xref></sup> strangled and hung upon a tree, or [they found him] killed<sup><xref rid="fn404">5</xref></sup> and thrown upon his sword, he is presumed to be like all [other] dead,<sup><xref rid="fn405">6</xref></sup> and they attend to him and withhold not from him anything.<sup><xref rid="fn406">7</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>One who stole or robbed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn407">8</xref></sup>, <italic>as a result of which was executed by government law</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn408">9</xref></sup> <italic>is to be mourned for, if no danger will</italic> [<italic>result</italic>] <italic>through him on account of the fear of the government;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn409">10</xref></sup> <italic>and he is not designated a wilful suicided</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn410">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. A minor who commits suicide wilfullly, is considered as though it were [done] unintentionally.<sup><xref rid="fn411">12</xref></sup> And likewise, one who was of age, and committed suicide wilfully, [being under pressure, as [in the case of] King Saul,<sup><xref rid="fn412">13</xref></sup> &#x2014; [the law is that] they withhold not from him a thing.</p>
<p>4. An excommunicant who died, is adjudged as one who committed suicide wilfully.<sup><xref rid="fn413">14</xref></sup> They rend no [garments], nor bare [the shoulder in mourning], nor make a lamentation for him,<sup><xref rid="fn413">14</xref></sup> and they place a stone on his coffin.<sup><xref rid="fn414">15</xref></sup> This ruling obtains in [a case where the person was excommunicated for] sheer contumacy,<sup><xref rid="fn415">16</xref></sup> [i.e.,] where one transgresses the teachings of the Law [out of contempt], but in [a case where one was excommunicated because of refusal to pay] indemnities, &#x2014; [the law is that] as soon as he<sup><xref rid="fn416">17</xref></sup> dies, he is declared free from their<sup><xref rid="fn417">18</xref></sup> decree, and they do not place a stone on his coffin, and they make a lamentation for him as is fit.<sup><xref rid="fn418">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. All those who dissociate themselves from the practices of the community, viz.,<sup><xref rid="fn419">20</xref></sup> those people who have cast off the yoke of the precepts from their neck,<sup><xref rid="fn420">21</xref></sup> and are not included within the community of Israel in the observance thereof,<sup><xref rid="fn421">22</xref></sup> [nor] in [showing] respect [towards] the Festivals, [nor] in attending Synagogues and Study-Houses, but are as freemen for themselves, like the [people of] other nations [who have not accepted God]; and likewise, those who are apostates and informers, &#x2014; [the law is that] for all these, one does not observe <italic>Aninuth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn422">23</xref></sup> or mourning rites<sup><xref rid="fn423">24</xref></sup>, but their brethren and other relations put on white clothes and wrap themselves in white<sup><xref rid="fn424">25</xref></sup> and eat and drink and rejoice.<sup><xref rid="fn425">26</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>One who dissociates himself from</italic> [<italic>the practices</italic>] <italic>of the community and refuses to carry the burden with them of imposts and Arnona</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn426">27</xref></sup> <italic>is mourned for</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn427">28</xref></sup> <italic>but all the other townspeople are not required to abstain from work on account of him in order to attend to him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn428">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. A minor [who is] one or two years olld, who commits apostasy [along] with his mother,<sup><xref rid="fn429">30</xref></sup> and [then] he died, is not to be mourned for.<sup><xref rid="fn430">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. One who fell into the sea or was drowned in the river or a beast devoured him, &#x2014; [the law is that] one does not withhold anything from him.<sup><xref rid="fn431">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. A coffin that passes [on its way] from place to place,&#x2014;if the body, <italic>i.e., the spinal column and its ribs</italic>, is intact, they stand in the [comforters&#x2019;] line and recite on account of him the mourner&#x2019;s benediction and offer condolence to the mourners, if there are mourners who mourn for him; but if the body is not intact, they do not stand in the [comforters&#x2019;] line and do not recite the mourners&#x2019; benediction, nor do they offer condolence to the mourners.<sup><xref rid="fn432">33</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn400">1) Lit. &#x2018;in every respect.&#x2019; For it is written: &#x2018;And <italic>surely your blood of your lives will I require&#x2019;</italic> (Gen. IX, 5), regarding which R. Eleazar remarked that it means, &#x2018;I will require your blood if shed by yourselves&#x2019; (B.K. 91b). <italic>RaShBA</italic> writes that although the law is that we do not attend to one who commits suicide, nevertheless, this does not apply to burial and shrouds, but only to rending of garments and baring the shoulder in mourning &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn401">2) Sem(H). II, 1. Thus also Yad, <italic>Ebel</italic> I, 11. <italic>N</italic> holds that garments are rent for a suicide and that the passage in Sem. from which our ruling is derived refers to strangers only but not to near-of-kin &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> In a case where the surviving members of the family of a suicide would suffer shame and humiliation, it is permitted to allow them to observe mourning rites &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> If no doubts are entertained as to the commision of suicide, the law is that where there are other mourners present at the Synagogue services, the children of a suicidal case should not recite the <italic>Kaddish.</italic> But if any doubts exist as to whether the person really committed suicide, the children should recite the <italic>Kaddish</italic> &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn402">3) By throwing himself down from the roof-top.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn403">4) Sem. has &#x2018;they found him.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn404">5) V. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 364, 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn405">6) For it may have been the result of an accident and unintentional.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn406">7) Yad <italic>ibid.</italic>, derived from Sem(H). II, 2-3. The following rules determine a suicidal case: a) The actual commission of suicide must be observed. A mere indication of suicide is not relied upon, unless the suicide&#x2019;s previous actions clearly indicate such commision. b) It must be committed wilfully and clearheadedly. c) The expressed intention for such commision must be followed by the act proper. d) In the case of a person found hung, even if the surrounding circumstances lead one to believe that the person took his life, nevertheless, he is not considered a suicide &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> If one was not seen going up to the roof-top to take his life in accord with his previous expressed intention, the law is that even if he was later found dead, he is not presumed to be a suicide (<italic>RaSHaL</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> V. <italic>supra</italic> c.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn407">8) The fact that stealing or robbing are punishable by death in no way indicates that the culprit, being aware of the outcome of his crime, may have committed suicide, for it is quite possible that he might have thought that he would not be caught. Nor is he regarded as one who dissociates himself from the practices of the community (v. <italic>infra</italic> par. 5). If a thief or a robber die a natural death, they are mourned for, provided they repented (<italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 340, 5 refers to one who did not repent) &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn408">9) <italic>Mord.</italic> states that mourning rites are not observed for one who was executed by the government on account of theft. Such a case should be considered as suicide. <italic>MaHaRIW</italic> (source of this gloss) opposes the ruling of <italic>Mord.</italic>, and maintains that one executed by the government, should be mourned for and is not on an equal footing with a suicide. He holds that <italic>Mord.</italic> was misled by a corrupt text in Sem. V. San. 47b where a distinction is made between one executed by a Gentile government and one executed by the <italic>Beth Din.</italic> In the former case, where execution is not in accordance with Jewish Law, one obtains forgiveness, and should be mourned for; in the latter case death is justly meted out and one is not forgiven. Cf. <italic>D.M.</italic> and <italic>W.G.</italic> a.l.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn409">10) V. San. 11a; Sota 48b. Otherwise, mourning could be regarded as an act of provocation. One who threw himself into the river is not considered a suicide, for prior to drowning, he is cast about by the waves, and no doubt, before he drowns, he repents &#x2014; <italic>G.Mah.</italic> One who murdered a fellow Jew and was exemuted by government law is mourned for &#x2014; <italic>B.L.Y.</italic> One who takes his life in order to avoid being subjected by others to inhuman torture is not considered a suicide &#x2014; <italic>B.L.Y.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn410">11) <italic>MaHaRIW</italic> s. 114 &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn411">12) Sem(H). II, 4-5. Since he is of immature mind. The same is applicable to an imbecile &#x2014; <italic>Tur.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn412">13) For whom suicide was permitted lest the Philistines torture him. V. Yeb. 78b: <italic>&#x2018;&#x201C;For Saul&#x201D;</italic> (II Sam. XXI, 1) because he was not mourned for properly.&#x2019; V. also Gen. R. <italic>Noah</italic> XXXIV, 13. Thus also <italic>N</italic> and <italic>Asheri.</italic> On King Saul&#x2019;s tragic death v. I Sam. XXXI.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn413">14) <italic>N</italic> in <italic>T.H.</italic> Since he is put to shame by the stone which is placed upon his coffin (v. <italic>infra</italic> n. 15), it follows that no honour should be extended to him. However, honour which accrues to the living is extended, viz., forming the line of comforters in order to console the mourners. With respect to burial and shrouds he is considered like all other dead &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn414">15) M.K. 15a in accord with R. Judah. Cf. also Sem(H). V, 13. This is done in order to carry out the ordinance of stoning. V. Josh. VII, 25.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn423">24) However, their burial needs are attended to &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> One should observe mourning rites at the time apostasy is committed &#x2014; <italic>B.L.Y.</italic> This is the accepted practice and applies only to one whose son or daughter committed apostasy, but not to other near-of-kin. In <italic>Hag. Asheri</italic> to M.K. it is stated that <italic>R. Gershom</italic> observed mourning rites for his son who became an apostate. According to <italic>Ta</italic>Z and <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic> the mourning rites were observed by <italic>R. Gershom</italic> after his son died. <italic>T.T. wa-Da&#x2018;ath</italic> maintains that the mourning rites were observed during the son&#x2019;s lifetime, after he committed apostasy.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn424">25) It follows that mourners should wear dark clothes, and every locality should abide by its accepted practice &#x2014; <italic>Ghayyat</italic> cited by <italic>Tur.</italic> V. also <italic>Kol Bo</italic>(<italic>G</italic>) I, p. 29, s. 10.</ftnote>

<p>1.

Our accepted practice upon completion of the [first] year to bewail and to memorialize the souls [of the dead],<sup><xref rid="fn449">11</xref></sup> seems to me, is not included in this principle,<sup><xref rid="fn450">12</xref></sup> and it is permissible to do so close to the Festival.<sup><xref rid="fn451">13</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn439">1) Lit. &#x2018;close to.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn440">2) The dead.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn441">3) Lit. &#x2018;enter.&#x2019; M.K. 8a; Y.M.K. I, 5(80d). Since the dead will not be put out of mind for at least thirty days (M.K. <italic>ibid</italic>. in accord with Samuel), and if a lament is held during this period, his grief and bitterness would be roused during the Festival. This applies even if the lamentation is performed <italic>gratis</italic> (cf. opinion of Rab <italic>ibid</italic>.). V. <italic>Tur</italic> a.l. Prior to <italic>Rosh Hashana</italic> and <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> it would be permissible &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn442">4) Thus <italic>RaBaD.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn443">5) For in the case of the new bereavement his grief would not be roused any more than it is, which would not be the case were he to make a lamentation for the old bereavement too, as a result of which the festive spirit of the Holiday would be greatly diminished.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn444">6) The new dead.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn445">7) If a renowned scholar dies, it is permissible to make a lamentation even within thirty days of the Festival, on accoun of the honour which we are dutibound to extend towards him &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> The entire ruling as stated here is also found in O.&#x1E24;. &#x00A7; 547, 3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn446">8) Since the grief is fixed and will not be roused any more than it is on account of the lament. Consequently, this case is similar to a new bereavement suffered within thirty days prior to the Festival at which time it is permitted to hold a lament (cf. <italic>supra</italic> par. 1).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn447">9) The dead person.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn448">10) I.e., the death occurred before the thirty days prior to the Festival. This law is based by <italic>Caro</italic> on Y.M.K. <italic>ibid.</italic> and is also found in O.&#x1E24;. <italic>ibid.</italic> par. 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn449">11) Thus was the custom in Spain.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn450">12) V. <italic>supra</italic> par. 1. The reason was that this memorial marked the conclusion of the mourning period at which time it was customary to change from dark to light garments.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn451">13) I.e., within the thirty days. It is permissible to memorialize the souls of departed ones for the first time, even during the Festival &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> For the source of this ruling cf. <italic>B.Yos.</italic> to O.&#x1E24;. <italic>ibid.</italic> par. 5. One is permitted to recite the <italic>Yizkor</italic> Memorial prayers during the first year after death and must not wait until a complete year has passed &#x2014; <italic>Sukkath Shalom.</italic> It is customary for those whose parents are living to leave the Synagogue during the <italic>Yizkor</italic> Service so as not to disturb those who recite these prayers &#x2014; <italic>Minhage Yeshurun.</italic></ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 349: THE PROHIBITION EXTENDING TO ANY BENEFIT THAT MAY BE DERIVED FROM A DEAD PERSON AND HIS SHROUDS. Contains four paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. [When] one dies, whether he is a Gentile&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn465">1</xref></sup> or an Israelite, his shrouds are forbidden [to be employed] for profitable use,<sup><xref rid="fn466">2</xref></sup> and [this is applicable] only if one designated them for his need<sup><xref rid="fn467">3</xref></sup> and also placed them upon him;<sup><xref rid="fn467">3</xref></sup> but mere designation, even if one made them [the shrouds] for his<sup><xref rid="fn467">3</xref></sup> need after he died, they [the shrouds] do not become forbidden [before being placed upon the dead], for mere designation is not a reality.<sup><xref rid="fn468">4</xref></sup> Likewise, if one placed them [the shrouds] upon him,<sup><xref rid="fn467">3</xref></sup> but did not designate them for such a purpose in the beginning, they are still not considered forbidden.<sup><xref rid="fn469">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. The ornaments of the dead which are attached to his body, e.g., a wig<sup><xref rid="fn470">6</xref></sup> and anything similar to that, are forbidden [to be employed for profitable use] just as the dead person proper;<sup><xref rid="fn471">7</xref></sup> <italic>and only when they are tied</italic><sup><xref rid="fn472">8</xref></sup> <italic>to the hair of the body, but if they are not tied, it is permitted.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn473">9</xref></sup> <italic>Accordingly it is permitted to remove rings from the hand</italic>[<italic>s</italic>] <italic>of corpses and anything similar to that</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn474">10</xref></sup> This applies only to a case where no instructions were given,<sup><xref rid="fn475">11</xref></sup> but if one instructed that the ornaments of his body which are attached thereto, should be given to his son or to his daughter, or for any other purpose, they are permitted;<sup><xref rid="fn476">12</xref></sup> but one&#x2019;s real hair, even if he left instructions regarding it, &#x2014; [the law is that] it is forbidden to make any use of it.<sup><xref rid="fn477">13</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>If a woman is about to be put to death, use may be made of her hair</italic>, [<italic>for</italic>] <italic>although her trial is ended, her hair does not become forbidden until she is executed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn478">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. If one&#x2019;s father and mother were throwing garments upon him,<sup><xref rid="fn479">15</xref></sup> it is a religious duty for others to save them [the garments],<sup><xref rid="fn480">16</xref></sup> [provided] if they [the garments] did not touch the bier which is buried with him.<sup><xref rid="fn481">17</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>And if one saved them he is bound to guard them, and if one returned them to his father and mother and again they threw them and</italic> [<italic>consequently</italic>] <italic>they became prohibited</italic> [<italic>for use</italic>], <italic>the one who restored</italic> [<italic>them</italic>] <italic>is responsible to compensate</italic> [<italic>the loss</italic>], <italic>for he is like one who threw them in a place where there are hordes of wild beasts and robbers</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn482">18</xref></sup> However, if they [the garments] did touch it [the bier], they are prohibited [for profitable use],<sup><xref rid="fn483">19</xref></sup> [provided] if they belong to the one upon whom they threw them,<sup><xref rid="fn484">20</xref></sup> and provided [too] that one threw them with the intention<sup><xref rid="fn485">21</xref></sup> that he should bury them with him.<sup><xref rid="fn486">22</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>The board upon which they cleansed</italic> [<italic>the corpse</italic>] <italic>and the entire equipment upon which they carry the corpse to burial, do not become prohibited</italic> [<italic>for profitable use</italic>], <italic>for one does not place them there for the sake of burying</italic> [<italic>them</italic>] <italic>with him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn487">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. Whoever [throws recklessly] many garments upon the dead,<sup><xref rid="fn488">24</xref></sup> commits a sin because of &#x2018;Do not destroy&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn489">25</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn465">1) <italic>RaShBA, Resp.</italic> 365. Cf. also Yad, <italic>Ebel</italic> XIV, 21 who makes no distinction between a Gentile and an Israelite with respect to the prohibition extending to any benefit that may be derived from a dead person. According to the following sources one may derive profitable use from a heathen corpse: Y.Shab. X, 6(12c); B.K. 10a, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D4;&#x05E9;&#x05D5;&#x05E8;</span>; <italic>RaShBA</italic> in his comments to B.K. <italic>ibid., RaN</italic> to Shab. 94b; <italic>N</italic> in <italic>T.H.</italic>; The case of David who married King Saul&#x2019;s daughter, Michal for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines. <italic>W.G.</italic> (Cf. also <italic>Mishneh le-Melek</italic>, Yad, <italic>Ebel ibid.</italic>) rules that one may derive profitable use from a heathen corpse. <italic>Shebuth Ya&#x2018;akob</italic> maintains that one is permitted to derive profitable use from a heathen corpse only if the latter was acquired by an Israelite (v. <italic>Tosaf</italic> B.K. <italic>ibid.</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>Yad Abraham. G.Mah.</italic> cites a dissenting opinion. Jewish dead are forbidden to be put to profitable use, Biblically; heathen dead only Rabbinically &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn466">2) This is deduced from the similar expression &#x2018;there&#x2019; used both in connection with the heifer whose neck was to be broken (Deut. XXI, 4), and the death of Miriam (Num. XX, 1). Just as the heifer was forbidden to be employed for profitable use, so also in the case of a dead person and his shrouds, the same prohibition applies &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> V. A.Z. 29b. This holds even if the benefit thus derived was not the result of employing the article in its normal or natural way &#x2014; <italic>R. A. Eger.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn467">3) I.e., the dead person. Derived from San. 47b-48a, where Abaye holds that &#x2018;designation is considered a reality.&#x2019; Hence, by mere designation for the dead person, the article becomes subject to the prohibition against profitable use, as though it were already used for the designated purpose. Raba, however, maintains that &#x2018;mere designation is not considered a reality.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn468">4) In accord with Raba&#x2019;s ruling. V. O.&#x1E24;. &#x00A7; 42, 3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn469">5) In accord with R. &#x1E24;isda (San. <italic>ibid.</italic>) that we require both designation and the use of the designated article. Cf. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 364, 1. On this principle, if a person prepared shrouds for himself, he may change his mind later, and use them for another purpose &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> Changing the form and the name of the object <span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05D5;&#x05D9;</span> does not apply, as it would in the case of an illegitimately obtained article &#x2014; <italic>Ba&#x2019;er Heteb</italic> on the authority of <italic>Ba&#x1E24;</italic> in <italic>Resp</italic>. To perform an autopsy in order to determine the cause of death is forbidden. Thus <italic>N.B., &#x1E24;atam Sofer, Binyan &#x1E92;ion, MaHaRaM ShiK</italic> a.o. The following reasons are advanced for this prohibition. a) Disgrace to the corpse <span dir="rtl">&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05D5;&#x05D5;&#x05DC; &#x05D4;&#x05DE;&#x05EA;</span>. b) A corpse must not be put to profitable use <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05E1;&#x05D5;&#x05E8; &#x05D4;&#x05E0;&#x05D0;&#x05D4;</span> c) The possibility that certain parts of the corpse will not be buried. This prohibition stands even if only one of the above reasons applies. <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic> rules that even if one agreed during his lifetime that after he dies an autopsy be performed on him, it is still forbidden. Others, however, permit under these conditions. One who desires that his son should study medicine in which case autopsies play a very important role, should leave instructions that after he dies he grants permission to have an autopsy performed on him &#x2014; <italic>Kol Bo</italic>(<italic>G</italic>) I, p. 40-41; <italic>Sh.M.B.</italic> IV p. 255-6. On the question of embalming, v. Kol Bo(G) I, p. 51-53. Blood which was removed from the corpse through embalming requires burial &#x2014;<italic>Kol Bo</italic>(<italic>G</italic>) <italic>ibid.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn470">6) Lit. &#x2018;strange (false) curls.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn471">7) &#x2018;Arak. 7b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn472">8) Even if the hair is plaited and not tied or fastened, it is still prohibited. Only when not fastened at all, i.e., it (the wig) hangs on a peg or hook, is it permitted &#x2014; <italic>Ba&#x1E24;</italic>. Artifical teeth even if made from the bone of a <italic>Nebelah</italic> (v. Glos.) should not be removed from the corpse, but should be buried with it &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn473">9) Derived from <italic>Rashi</italic>, &#x2018;Arak. <italic>ibid.</italic> (s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05E4;&#x05D0;&#x05D4; &#x05E0;&#x05DB;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05EA;</span>) &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn474">10) From this it follows that if a gold or silver ornament or the like is attached to the corpse, it should not be removed. But this may be questioned. For according to &#x2018;Arak, <italic>ibid.</italic> only those ornaments which appear as part of his body (e.g., a wig or artifical teeth) should not be removed. But other ornaments, which do not appear as part of the corpse, even if attached, should not be any different from clothes worn at the time of death, which, even if fastened to the dead man&#x2019;s body, do not become prohibited &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn475">11) Lit. &#x2018;an undefined (case).&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn476">12) &#x2018;Arak. <italic>ibid.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn477">13) Cf. also <italic>Kesef Mishneh</italic> to Yad, <italic>Ebel ibid</italic>. and <italic>B.Yos.</italic> a.l. <italic>Maim.</italic> and <italic>SeMaG</italic> rule that it is permitted to make use of a dead person&#x2019;s hair. A closer examination of the Talmudic discussion in &#x2018;Arak. <italic>ibid</italic> will reveal that the opinion which permits is correct &#x2014; <italic>Nek. Hak.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn478">14) <italic>Tur</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> In accord with R. Na&#x1E25;man b. Isaac (&#x2018;Arak. <italic>ibid</italic>.).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn479">15) Their dead son.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn480">16) One is religiously dutibound to remove the garments from the corpse and thereby restore lost property, for the parents will certainly regret their action later &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn481">17) Upon which he was carried out for burial as was the custom in those days. Derived from San. 48a-b in accord with R. Simeon b. Gamaliel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn482">18) <italic>Resp.</italic> of <italic>R. Meir of Rothenberg</italic>, cited in <italic>Mord</italic>. B.B. V. &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn483">19) The prohibition is Rabbinical, since the garments might be confused with the shrouds of the dead, and if permitted for use, people would apply this to the shrouds as well (San. <italic>ibid</italic>.).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn484">20) <italic>Tur</italic> from <italic>N</italic> in <italic>T.H.</italic> who derives it from Yeb. 66b. Otherwise the law is that a person cannot prohibit something which does not belong to him &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn485">21) I.e., in a manner expressing extreme grief and embitterment, in order to bury the garments along with the corpse, and the garments touched the bier which is also buried. This excludes a mattress or cushion usually placed under the head of the corpse, or a sheet or <italic>Talith</italic> spread over the coffin or bier in which the corpse is carried out for burial &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> If the dead person possessed a becoming <italic>Talith</italic>, it should not be exchanged for one of inferior quality, for the principle, &#x2018;Do not destroy,&#x2019; does not apply here (cf. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 348, n. 2) &#x2014; <italic>B.L.Y.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn486">22) <italic>Tur</italic> on the authority of <italic>Asheri</italic> M.K. end &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Prohibited articles were not buried together with the dead person, in the same grave, but rather in the earth surrounding the grave which becomes the possession of the corpse &#x2014; <italic>T.H.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn497">2) Mishna Kil. IX, 4. V. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 301, 7. This ruling is based upon the following: &#x2018;R.

<ftnote id="fn501">6) Three opinions are recorded here with respect to fringes in the garments of a corpse. a) <italic>Caro</italic> holds that the corpse must be buried in a <italic>Talith</italic> that has fringes. Thus also opinion of <italic>N</italic> V. Men. 41a. b) <italic>R. Tam</italic> maintains that fringes are not required (even when the corpse is carried out for burial). V. Ber. 18a, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D1;&#x05DC;</span>; B.B. 74a, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05E4;&#x05E1;&#x05E7;&#x05D9;</span>; A.Z. 65b, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D1;&#x05DC;</span>; Nid. 61b, <italic>Tosa</italic>f<italic>.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D1;&#x05DC;</span>.

XII, 11 (v. also <italic>ibid.</italic> p. 241). that the accepted custom is to bury the corpse with fringes, provided some disqualification is made in them. The fringes are regarded as accessories of religious observances (<span dir="rtl">&#x05EA;&#x05E9;&#x05DE;&#x05D9;&#x05E9;&#x05D9; &#x05DE;&#x05E6;&#x05D5;&#x05D4;</span>) which may be thrown away when disused, and hence in this case they do not have to be removed, <italic>contra</italic> Abba Saul who it seems considers them (i.e., the fringes) as accessories of holiness (<span dir="rtl">&#x05EA;&#x05E9;&#x05DE;&#x05D9;&#x05E9;&#x05D9; &#x05E7;&#x05D3;&#x05D5;&#x05E9;&#x05D4;</span>) which are usually stored away. V. Meg. 26b. This opinion is also accepted by <italic>RIBA</italic> and <italic>RaSHaL</italic> (cited by <italic>Ba&#x1E24;</italic>)<italic>.</italic> There are two more opinions regarding this problem, viz., that of <italic>Ra&#x2019;BIaH</italic> who holds that one who observed the precept of <italic>&#x1E92;i&#x1E93;ith</italic> during lifetime should be buried with <italic>&#x1E92;i&#x1E93;ith;</italic> otherwise, he should not be buried with <italic>&#x1E92;i&#x1E93;ith;</italic> and that of <italic>R. Isaac b. Malki &#x1E92;edek</italic> and <italic>RaZaH</italic> to carry out the corpse for burial covered by a <italic>Talith</italic> with <italic>&#x1E92;i&#x1E93;ith</italic> which is removed before burial. Thus is the custom of the Land of Israel (v. <italic>Gesher ha-&#x1E24;ayyim</italic> I, 10; II, 14). Thus also opinion of <italic>RI</italic> in <italic>Tosaf.</italic> B.B. <italic>ibid.</italic> Cf. also <italic>Asheri</italic> to M.K. III for a lengthy discussion on this problem and also suggestions in order to remove the difficulty between this ruling and <italic>supra</italic> par. 1 according to which the dead are exempt from religious observances. <italic>Derisha</italic> removes this apparent contradiction by stating that the precept of <italic>&#x1E92;i&#x1E93;ith</italic> is different, since it is as important as all precepts put together. Furthermore, &#x2018;diverse kinds&#x2019; are forbidden by the Torah only if they afford warmth to the individual, which is not applicable in the case of the dead. One who through no fault of his own but on account of unavoidable circumstances could not observe the precept of <italic>&#x1E92;i&#x1E93;ith</italic> during his lifetime, may be buried in a <italic>Talith</italic>, provided he left sufficient funds with which to buy one. But if money has to be spent from the public charity fund, it is not permitted &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>

<p>1. The corpse is not buried in expensive shrouds even [if it is] for the <italic>Nasi</italic><sup><xref rid="fn503">2</xref></sup> of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn504">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. The accepted custom is to bury [the dead] in white garments.<sup><xref rid="fn505">4</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn504">3) Derived from M.K. 27b where it is reported that formerly the expense of taking the dead out for burial was more burden-some on his near-of-kin than his death proper, as a result of which the dead person&#x2019;s near-of-kin would forsake him. Until Rabban Gamaliel, the Elder, who was <italic>Nasi</italic> in Israel, ordained, that he be buried in flaxen garments instead of woolen ones of an expensive sort, and this practice was adopted later by everyone, viz., to use for shrouds even rough cloth worth a <italic>Zuz.</italic> In addition to this measure adopted for the general good, &#x2014; to be buried in expensive garments smacks of presumptuousness and is a transgression of the law prohibiting to ruin anything wantonly (Deut. XX, 19) &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> Cf. Yad, <italic>Ebel</italic> IV, 2. However, the flaxen shrouds may be of a finer quality but not of the best &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> V. <italic>Ba&#x2019;er Heteb</italic> a.l. Only the <italic>Talith</italic> should be of wool. However, it is permissible to bury one in a silken <italic>Talith</italic> if worn by the individual during lifetime &#x2014; <italic>Yad Sha&#x2019;ul.</italic> A new <italic>Talith</italic> should not be exchanged for an old one, for it is appropriate to bury the dead in the <italic>Talith</italic> he prayed during lifetime.

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 353: IN WHAT MANNER ONE TAKES OUT [FOR BURIAL] A DEAD PERSON OF AGE OR A MINOR, AND IN WHICH KIND OF BIER. Contains seven paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. Formerly, they used to uncover the face of the rich [dead] and cover the face of the poor [dead] because their faces [i.e., of the poor dead] turned black in years of dearth and the surviving poor [near-of-kin] felt ashamed; hence, they ordained that one should cover everyone&#x2019;s face.<sup><xref rid="fn512">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. A scroll of Law is not placed on a scholar&#x2019;s bier.<sup><xref rid="fn513">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. The honour of a scholar [requires] that he be taken out [in his bier] through the door and not to lower him from the roof; and [he should be taken out] on the first bier<sup><xref rid="fn514">3</xref></sup> and not to transfer him from one bier to another.<sup><xref rid="fn515">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. An infant [who dies] within thirty days [after birth] is carried out in one&#x2019;s arms<sup><xref rid="fn516">5</xref></sup> to the cemetery and not in a coffin, and is buried by one woman and two men but not by one man and two women, on account of privacy.<sup><xref rid="fn517">6</xref></sup> And one does not stand in the line [of comforters] for him,<sup><xref rid="fn518">7</xref></sup> nor does one recite for him the mourners&#x2019; benediction,<sup><xref rid="fn519">8</xref></sup> nor does one offer condolence to the mourners,<sup><xref rid="fn520">9</xref></sup> even if we are certain that his months [of pregnancy] were complete.<sup><xref rid="fn521">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. One who is thirty complete days old, is taken out [for burial] in a case, (<italic>i.e., a coffin; &#x2018;and he was put in a coffin</italic>&#x2019;,<sup><xref rid="fn522">11</xref></sup> <italic>is rendered by Targum Jonathan</italic>, <span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05E9;&#x05D5;&#x05D5;&#x05DF; &#x05D9;&#x05EA;&#x05D9;&#x05D4; &#x05D1;&#x05D2;&#x05DC;&#x05D5;&#x05E1;&#x05E7;&#x05DE;&#x05D0;</span>),<sup><xref rid="fn523">12</xref></sup> that is carried in the arms,<sup><xref rid="fn524">13</xref></sup> (<italic>i.e., a wide board;</italic> <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D2;&#x05E4;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span> <italic>means arms</italic>); and one stands in the line [of comforters] for it, and one recites for it the mourners&#x2019; benediction, and one offers condolence to the mourners.<sup><xref rid="fn525">14</xref></sup> One twelve months old is taken out [for burial] on a bier. For one who is taken out on a bier the public show their grief; for one who is not taken out on a bier the public need not show their grief.<sup><xref rid="fn526">15</xref></sup> And whoever is known to the people at large,<sup><xref rid="fn527">16</xref></sup> the public should attend to him; and whoever is not known to the people at large, the public need not attend to him.<sup><xref rid="fn528">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. [With respect to] an infant that died<sup><xref rid="fn529">18</xref></sup> before it was circumcised,<sup><xref rid="fn530">19</xref></sup> [the law is that] one circumcises it at its grave<sup><xref rid="fn531">20</xref></sup> without [reciting the usual] benediction; and one [also] names it [then].<sup><xref rid="fn532">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. A corpse is not taken out [for burial] on a bier unless its head and the greater part of its body are intact.<sup><xref rid="fn533">22</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn512">1) M.K. 27a. Cf. <italic>ibid.</italic> for other customs which were in vogue formerly but were changed later out of respect to those who would suffer embarrassment. Once the corpse is placed in the coffin and covered one must not open it in order to view the body &#x2014; <italic>Kol Bo</italic>(<italic>G</italic>) I, p. 36.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn513">2) Derived from M.K. 25a in connection with the death of R. Huna. Should, however, the scroll of Law be placed on a stool or the like in the presence of the dead, it would be permissible &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> Nowadays even this is no longer practiced &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn515">4) M.K. <italic>ibid.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn516">5) Lit. &#x2018;bosom.&#x2019; This means that one is not required to carry out the infant save in one&#x2019;s arms. Should one, however, desire to use a bier, it would be permissible &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn517">6) Cf. Kid. 80b where it is stated: &#x2018;A man may not be alone with two women, but one woman may be alone with two men.&#x2019; If the two women are related to the infant it is permissible, for since they are in grief on the loss of the infant, they will not yield to temptation &#x2014; <italic>D.M.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn518">7) I.e., one is not required to do so, but may, if he so desires. Upon returning from the cemetery, the people would pass by the mourners in a line and would say <span dir="rtl">&#x05EA;&#x05EA;&#x05E0;&#x05D7;&#x05DE;&#x05D5;</span> &#x2018;Be comforted.&#x2019; Cf.

<p>1. It is prohibited to leave the corpse [unburied] over night, unless they left him over night for the sake of his honour, [viz.,] to provide for him a coffin or shrouds,<sup><xref rid="fn552">1</xref></sup> or [professional] lamenting women,<sup><xref rid="fn553">2</xref></sup> or in order that relatives should [have time] to come,<sup><xref rid="fn554">3</xref></sup> or to assemble [surrounding] townships [for his funeral].<sup><xref rid="fn555">4</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn552">1) Mishna San. 46a: &#x2018;Whoever leaves his dead lie over night, transgresses both the positive command, <italic>&#x201C;but thou shalt surely bury him the same day,&#x201D;</italic> and the negative command, <italic>&#x201C;his body shall not remain all night upon the tree&#x201D;</italic> (Deut.

<ftnote id="fn561">2) V.

<ftnote id="fn562">3) According to one opinion this means half an hour prior to the prescribed period for reading the <italic>Shema.</italic> The expression &#x2018;close to&#x2019; employed here is similar to the expression &#x2018;close to <italic>Min&#x1E25;ah&#x2019;</italic> found in Pes. 99b. Hence, in the morning, since the time for reading the <italic>Shema</italic> in the first instance (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DC;&#x05DB;&#x05EA;&#x05D7;&#x05D9;&#x05DC;&#x05D4;</span>) is &#x2018;when one sees his friend at a distance of four cubits and recognizes him,&#x2019; until the &#x2018;sparklings of the rising sun&#x2019; appear (Ber. 9b; O.&#x1E24;. &#x00A7; 58, 1; &#x00A7; 89, 1), a corpse may be taken out for burial at least half an hour before this period. Otherwise, we apprehend that there will be insufficient time to complete the burial and read the <italic>Shema</italic> in time &#x2014; <italic>Disciples of R. Jonah</italic> (Ber. 19a). In Y.Ber. III, 2(6b) one hour is mentioned, which is explained (v. <italic>R. Jonah ibid.</italic>) to mean, as long as there is sufficient time to complete the burial before the prescribed period arrives. Hence, &#x2018;close to&#x2019; does not refer to the half hour period. In Y. <italic>ibid.</italic> the following question is raised: Since we learn in the following Mishna (Ber. <italic>ibid</italic>.): &#x2018;When they have buried the dead and returned, if they can begin (the <italic>Shema</italic>) and complete it before reaching the (mourners&#x2019;) line, they begin it; but if they can not, they do not begin it,&#x2019; it follows that the <italic>Shema</italic> is never read during the time that the corpse is borne for the purpose of burial (for as we have seen one must take the corpse out for burial prior to the prescribed time for reading the <italic>Shema</italic>). Consequently, we may ask, why does the Mishnah make a distinction with respect to the <italic>Shema</italic> at the time the corpse is carried out for burial? In order to remove this apparent difficulty, Y. <italic>ibid.</italic> explains that it applies only to a case where they thought that there was ample time to complete the burial before the prescribed time for reading the <italic>Shema</italic> arrived, and they erred. In Ber. <italic>ibid.</italic> it is stated that it refers to a distinguished person who may be taken out for burial even close to the prescribed period for the reading of the <italic>Shema.</italic> The custom today is to take out the corpse for burial after the morning Service at the Synagogue is over, so that many people will be able to attend the burial &#x2014; <italic>B.Hillel.</italic> Cf. <italic>G.</italic> anon.</ftnote>

<p>1. Wherever it is the accepted custom for women to precede the bier, they may do so; wherever it is the accepted practice to follow the bier, they may do so.<sup><xref rid="fn579">2</xref></sup> Now it is customary for them only to follow the bier, and [this custom] should not be changed.</p>

<ftnote id="fn579">2) San. 20a; Y. <italic>ibid.</italic> II, 4(20b). In Y. the following reasons are advanced for these customs: a) The custom of women preceding the bier is due to the fact that they were the first to cause death in the world (cf. Gen. III); b) The custom of women following the bier is on account of propriety, so that the men should not have to gaze at the women. The latter custom was adopted, for it avoids the possibility of commiting a sin. Cf. San. <italic>ibid., Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05E0;&#x05E9;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>; Gen.

<ftnote id="fn580">3) I.e., they may follow the bier in the funeral procession (as <italic>supra</italic> par. 1), but they are not permitted to enter the cemetery grounds when the corpse is interred.

<p>1. If a funeral procession<sup><xref rid="fn581">1</xref></sup> and a bridal procession<sup><xref rid="fn582">2</xref></sup> meet each other [on the way], the funeral procession is made to make way for the bridal procession.<sup><xref rid="fn583">3</xref></sup> Likewise, if there are not sufficient [people] in the city [to attend] both,<sup><xref rid="fn584">4</xref></sup> they bring in the bride [under the bridal] canopy first, and then they bury the dead;<sup><xref rid="fn585">5</xref></sup> but after she has been brought in [under the bridal] canopy and there is before him [the duty] to comfort a mourner and to gladden a bridegroom, comforting the mourner comes first.

It is only in the case where the wedding ceremonies had already taken place that visiting the house of mourning takes precedence over the wedding-feast that follows the marriage. This applies only if the duty of attending the wedding-feast will not be neglected entirely, but should one not be able to attend to both, as a result of which, one precept will be completely neglected, attending the wedding-feast takes precedence.

<chapter>
<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 361: ESCORTING THE DEAD AND SUSPENDING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH IN ORDER TO ATTEND THE DEAD TO THE GRAVE. Contains five paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. One suspends the study of the Torah for the sake of taking out the dead [for burial].<sup><xref rid="fn594">1</xref></sup> For one who taught others there is no limit, [i.e.,] even if there are many thousands [present] with him [the dead], one must suspend himself [from studies] for his sake. For one who read [Bible] and studied [<italic>Mishna</italic>], i.e., one who read [Bible] and studied [<italic>Mishna</italic>] but has not yet taught students, &#x2014; if there are sixty myriads [attending the funeral], one need not suspend himself [from studies] for his sake.<sup><xref rid="fn595">2</xref></sup> For one who has not read [Bible] nor studied [<italic>Mishna</italic>], &#x2014; as long as there is someone looking after [his burial needs], one need not suspend himself [from studies] for his sake,<sup><xref rid="fn596">3</xref></sup> provided that [at least] ten people are [present] there.<sup><xref rid="fn597">4</xref></sup> <italic>Some say that today</italic>, [<italic>even</italic>] <italic>without knowing</italic> [<italic>one&#x2019;s scholastic ability</italic>] <italic>we suspend</italic> [<italic>studies</italic>], <italic>for there is no man from among Israel nowadays, who is not</italic> [<italic>versed</italic>] <italic>in Bible or Mishna</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn598">5</xref></sup> [With respect to] a woman, some say that her status<sup><xref rid="fn599">6</xref></sup> is like one who read [Bible] and studied [<italic>Mishna</italic>];<sup><xref rid="fn600">7</xref></sup> and some say that her status<sup><xref rid="fn599">6</xref></sup> is like one who has not read [Bible] nor studied [<italic>Mishna</italic>]. And thus is the accepted practice regarding a woman and a child, &#x2014; to adopt the lenient view.<sup><xref rid="fn601">8</xref></sup> One does not suspend the study of the Torah for the sake of attending to [the burial needs of] the dead, when there is someone [else] who will attend to his need[s] sufficiently; but one occupies himself with [the study of] the Torah and is not required to go out and see whether all his [burial] need[s] are [attended to] or not; but as long as there is some one who will perform the [necessary] work [with respect to the corpse], his study of the Torah has priority.<sup><xref rid="fn602">9</xref></sup> School children are not suspended [from their studies] at all.<sup><xref rid="fn603">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. When does this apply, [viz.,] that we suspend the study of the Torah to escort him [for burial]? &#x2014; [Only] during the time he is brought out [for burial]; but as long as he still] lies awaiting burial, we do not suspend for his sake the study of the Torah, only that if there are [burial] associations in the city, of which each one [association] attends to [the burial needs] on its [particular] day, [then] the one [association] for whom [this] is not its [particular] day, is permitted both study and other types of work. During the time [the corpse] is brought out [for burial] we suspend [ourselves] from all types of work and come to escort him, even if he did not read [Bible] nor study [<italic>Mishna</italic>], for [the law is that] we make a distinction in the case of one who did not read [Bible] nor study [<italic>Mishna</italic>] only regarding suspension of the study of the Torah, but in the case of other occupations, even if one did not read [Bible] nor study [<italic>Mishna</italic>] all are suspended [from work], and come to escort him. If, however, there are no [burial] associations in the city, all workmen are required to be suspended [from work] and to attend to him until he is buried, but they are required to be suspended from the study of the Torah only at the time of the funeral escort as we have stated.<sup><xref rid="fn604">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. One who sees a corpse and does not escort him transgresses thereby, &#x2018;<italic>Whoso mocketh the poor</italic><sup><xref rid="fn605">12</xref></sup> [<italic>blasphemeth his Maker</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn606">13</xref></sup> and should be placed under a ban;<sup><xref rid="fn607">14</xref></sup> and one should escort him at least four cubits.<sup><xref rid="fn608">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. Even where one is not required to escort the dead he is dutibound to rise before him.<sup><xref rid="fn609">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. A coffin which passes [on its way] from place to place, &#x2014; if the remains have retained the shape of the body they must escort him as at the time the corpse was brought out [for burial).<sup><xref rid="fn610">17</xref></sup></p>

Not so <italic>RITBA</italic> (cited by <italic>B.Yos.</italic>) where it is implied that a knowledge of either one is sufficient. The number sixty myriads is explained by the Gemara (<italic>ibid.</italic>) as follows: &#x2018;The taking away of the Torah (on account of a scholar&#x2019;s death) must correspond to its giving. As its giving was in the presence of sixty myriads (600,000), so also its taking away must be in the presence of sixty myriads.&#x2019;</ftnote>

They do not bury two corpses one alongside the other,<sup><xref rid="fn618">8</xref></sup> unless the [intervening] wall of the grave separates between them.<sup><xref rid="fn619">9</xref></sup> Nor [do they bury] a corpse alongside the bones [of another corpse], or the bones [of a corpse] alongside [another] corpse.<sup><xref rid="fn620">10</xref></sup> However, a man may be buried with his minor daughter and a woman with her minor son or her son&#x2019;s minor son [in the same grave]. This is the general rule, &#x2014; whosoever sleeps with him during lifetime may be buried with him when he dies.<sup><xref rid="fn621">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. They do not place two coffins, one above the other.<sup><xref rid="fn622">12</xref></sup> If one placed [them in this position], they may compel [the owner of the] one above that it be removed. If between them [the coffins]<sup><xref rid="fn623">13</xref></sup> there are six handbreadths<sup><xref rid="fn624">14</xref></sup> of earth, it is permissible.<sup><xref rid="fn625">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. They do not bury a wicked man beside a righteous one;<sup><xref rid="fn626">16</xref></sup> even a grossly wicked person [is not buried] alongside a moderately wicked one.<sup><xref rid="fn627">17</xref></sup> And likewise they do not bury a righteous person, and so much the more<sup><xref rid="fn628">18</xref></sup> an average individual beside an extremely pious one.<sup><xref rid="fn629">19</xref></sup> <italic>However, they may bury a repentent sinner beside a perfectly righteous person</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn630">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. Two [people] who were enemies of each other,<sup><xref rid="fn631">21</xref></sup> should not be buried together.<sup><xref rid="fn632">22</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn611">1) The coffin. V. <italic>Perisha.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn612">2) Derived from San. 46b where it is stated that R. Jo&#x1E25;anan said that burial in the earth is referred to by the Torah in the verse, <italic>&#x2018;Thou shalt surely bury him&#x2019;</italic> (Deut. XXI, 23). The emphatic infinitive (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E7;&#x05D1;&#x05D5;&#x05E8; &#x05EA;&#x05E7;&#x05D1;&#x05E8;&#x05E0;&#x05D5;</span>) denotes burial in the earth. Otherwise, one transgresses the injunction, <italic>&#x2018;His body shall not remain all night&#x2019;</italic> (<italic>ibid</italic>.). Placing the corpse in a coffin is alluded to in the question that King Shapor asked R. Huna (San. <italic>ibid</italic>.). It is not obligatory to bury an amputated limb of a living being. However, since it defiles, <italic>Kohanim</italic> are prohibited against being in the same room with it &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn613">3) Y.M.K. I, 5(80c bot.); Y.San. VI, 12(23d bot.): &#x2018;In former days they buried them (the convicts) in deep pits etc. and they were placed in a coffin&#x2019; (v. <italic>W.G.</italic>), i.e., after the flesh became decomposed they were placed in a coffin. Thus also <italic>Asheri.</italic> V. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 363, 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn614">4) V. <italic>Ba&#x1E24;</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn615">5) Y.Ket. XII, 3(35a top); Y.Kil. IX, 4(32b top); Gen. R. s. 100. In these sources R. Judah, the Prince, prior to his death gave the following instructions: &#x2018;Let my coffin be perforated at the bottom.&#x2019; <italic>N</italic> explains that what he meant was that the bottom of the coffin should be removed so that the body should be in contact with the ground, since burial in the earth is a religious duty and applies not only to the Land of Israel but also when one is buried outside the Land of Israel, for it is written, <italic>&#x2018;And to dust thou shalt return&#x2019;</italic> (Gen. III, 19). Cremation is forbidden according to Jewish Law. V. <italic>Beth Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic>; <italic>Eben Yekarah; &#x2018;Arugoth Habosem; Imre Yosher</italic> and others who strongly prohibit cremation. One who left instructions to be cremated after death is regarded as one who dissociates himself from the practices of the Congregation and is considered a heretic. Hence, he has the same status as those for whom one does not observe <italic>Aninuth</italic> or mourning rites. The ashes of a cremated person are forbidden to be buried in a Jewish cemetery. On the question of cremation cf. also lengthy article by Dr. H. Higger, appended to his <italic>Halakoth Wa-Agadoth</italic> pp. 161-183.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn616">6) Y.Naz. IX, 3(57d): &#x2018;What is considered lying in its usual position? &#x2014; If the corpse is found with its feet stretched out and its hands on the heart.&#x2019; This indicates that the corpse is interred on its back. Cf. also Naz. 65a: <italic>&#x2018;Lying</italic>, but not in a sitting position; <italic>in the usual position</italic>, &#x2014; excludes the head lying between the thighs.&#x2019; (this corresponds to the expression <span dir="rtl">&#x05E7;&#x05DE;&#x05E6;&#x05D5;&#x05E5;</span> i.e., a doubled position, found in Y. <italic>ibid</italic>). Burial is also permissible on one&#x2019;s side. V. Y.Ket. XII, 3(35a) as part of the instructions given by R. Jeremiah: &#x2018;Let them place me on my side.&#x2019; (v. <italic>Tur.</italic> who has the reading <span dir="rtl">&#x05E2;&#x05DC; &#x05D2;&#x05D1;&#x05D9;</span> &#x2018;on my back,&#x2019; which is emended by <italic>Perisha</italic> to <span dir="rtl">&#x05E2;&#x05DC; &#x05E1;&#x05D9;&#x05D8;&#x05E8;&#x05D0;</span> &#x2018;on my side&#x2019; found in cur. edd.). Cf. B.B. 101a-b according to which burial in an upright position is regarded as the burial of asses. If a corpse is placed in an upright or sitting position it is considered disrespectful. It is customary to cover the top of the coffin and not to throw earth directly on the corpse, which would be considered disgraceful &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> V. however, <italic>Tur</italic> who quotes <italic>Resp.</italic> of <italic>R. Natronai Gaon</italic> regarding different customs of burial depending on dry or moist localities, and cf. also <italic>Perisha</italic> a.l.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn617">7) Cf. Ber. 13b according to which it is forbidden to sleep on the back. V. however, B.B. 74a where it is stated that the &#x2018;Dead of the Wilderness&#x2019; slept on their backs.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn618">8) In some localities the corpse is buried with head northward and feet southward; in others, the head westward and the feet eastward. Whatever custom is adopted, the position on each cemetery should be the same for all dead &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote> 
<ftnote id="fn619">9) According to the Mishna in B.B. 100b which deals with sepulchral chambers (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05D5;&#x05DB;&#x05D9;&#x05DF;</span>), the thickness of the wall between grottos was one cubit (i.e., six handbreadths). Hence, the thickness of the wall of the grotto was half a cubit. Accordingly, some rule (v. <italic>R. A. Eger; G.Mah.; Yad Abraham</italic> and others) that the intervening wall should be one cubit in thickness. This follows the opinion of the First Tanna in the Mishna ibid. <italic>Caro</italic> here and in <italic>B.Yos.</italic> seems to rule in accord with the opinion of R. Simeon b. Gamaliel (<italic>ibid.</italic> V. <italic>W.G.</italic> a.l.) that everything depends upon the quality of the intervening earth or rock. If it is hard, one may make more sepulchral chambers, since less intervening space for the walls would be required. On the other hand, if the earth is soft, more space would be required for the intervening walls. Hence, the number of grottos would be less. <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> states that the custom to bury the dead close to each other stems from the fact the land available to us for cemeteries is quite limited. V. <italic>Ta</italic>Z &#x00A7; 364, n. 2. <italic>A.H.</italic> rules that legally no specific thickness for the intervening wall is required. As long as it is able to stand without caving in. It must be at least six fingerbreadths in thickness.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn620">10) Sem(H). XIII, 8. V. also <italic>Baraithoth Ebel Rabbathi ibid.</italic> p. 232, 236.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn621">11) Sem(H). <italic>ibid.</italic> in accord with R. Judah. This ruling refers only to a minor son, but a son or daughter of majority age are not permitted to be interred with the father or mother respectively. The mention of her son&#x2019;s minor son does not exclude the daughter of his son or the daughter of his daughter &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> A man may be buried next to his wife &#x2014; <italic>Peri ha-Sadeh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn622">12) In <italic>&#x2018;En Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic> it is stated that if a new cemetery could be bought only on the condition that at some later date the corpses will have to be removed, they may cover the old cemetery with earth so that there will be an intervening layer of earth six handbreadths in thickness and then bury the new dead. <italic>Lebushe Mordekai</italic> states that this was done in the city of Presburg. This was also done in the city of Cracow &#x2014; <italic>Ba&#x1E24;.</italic> In <italic>Beth Yi&#x1E93;&#x1E25;ak</italic> it is reported that in the city of Paris a rock would be placed between the upper and the lower coffins. For only in the case of intervening earth are six handbreadths required, but not in the case of rock.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 363: THE PROHIBITION AGAINST REMOVING A CORPSE AND BONES FROM THEIR [BURIAL] PLACE. Contains seven paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. One should not remove a corpse and bones<sup><xref rid="fn633">1</xref></sup> from a dignified grave to [another] dignified grave, nor from an undignified grave to [another] undignified grave, nor from an undignified one to a dignified one, and needless to say [that it is forbidden] from a dignified one to an undignified one. And [to remove a corpse] into his own,<sup><xref rid="fn634">2</xref></sup> even from a dignified [grave] to an undignified one, is permissible,<sup><xref rid="fn635">3</xref></sup> for it is pleasant for a man that he rest beside his ancestors.<sup><xref rid="fn636">4</xref></sup> And likewise, in order to bury him in the Land of Israel, it is permissible [to remove him].<sup><xref rid="fn637">5</xref></sup> If they placed him there [originally] with the intention that he be removed [later], it is permissible under all conditions.<sup><xref rid="fn638">6</xref></sup> If he is not safe in this grave, for there is apprehension that heathens may take him out, or that water may enter therein, or that it is a grave that has been found,<sup><xref rid="fn639">7</xref></sup> it is a religious duty to remove him [therefrom].<sup><xref rid="fn640">8</xref></sup> <italic>Some are wont to place some earth from the Land of Israel in the grave</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn641">9</xref></sup> (<italic>and this custom has a basis</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn642">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. They do not convey a corpse from a city wherein there is a cemetery to <italic>another</italic> city, unless it is from outside the Land into the Land [of Israel],<sup><xref rid="fn643">11</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>Or if they convey him to the place of his ancestral sepulchre</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn644">12</xref></sup> <italic>And if he left instructions to convey him from one place to</italic> [<italic>another</italic>] <italic>place, or</italic> [<italic>if</italic>] <italic>he left instructions to bury him at his home and not in the cemetery, he is obeyed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn645">13</xref></sup> <italic>It is permitted to place lime upon him, in order to decompose the flesh rapidly</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn646">14</xref></sup> <italic>and</italic> [<italic>then</italic>] <italic>to convey him to the place</italic> [<italic>concerning</italic>] <italic>which he left instructions</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn647">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. One may not collect bones from a<sup><xref rid="fn648">16</xref></sup> coffin, nor [may one gather the bones] from a<sup><xref rid="fn648">16</xref></sup> grave to one<sup><xref rid="fn649">17</xref></sup> side [in order] to bury therein another corpse, nor for the need of the place.<sup><xref rid="fn650">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. [In] a locality where it is customary to bury [the dead first] in depressions, (<italic>i.e</italic>., <italic>deep pits</italic>, &#x2014; <italic>derived from, &#x2018;into deep pits that they rise not up again&#x2019;</italic>,)<sup><xref rid="fn651">19</xref></sup> without a coffin, until the flesh is decomposed, and afterwards one collects the bones and buries them in a coffin, it is permitted.<sup><xref rid="fn652">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. [If] one cleared a coffin [of its corpse] it is forbidden for profitable use. If it [was made] of stone<sup><xref rid="fn653">21</xref></sup> or of earthenware, it should be broken; [if] of wood, it should be burnt.<sup><xref rid="fn654">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. One who finds boards on the cemetery, should not move them from their place.<sup><xref rid="fn655">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. It is forbidden to open the grave after it was closed [by] the <italic>Golel</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn656">24</xref></sup> even if the heirs protest to open it in order to examine [the corpse] whether he has grown<sup><xref rid="fn657">25</xref></sup> two hairs.<sup><xref rid="fn658">26</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn633">1) Two reasons are advanced for this prohibition: a) The disturbance of removal is hard on the dead &#x2014; <italic>Ta</italic>Z, <italic>ShaK</italic>. Cf. I Sam. XXVIII, 15; Job III, 13; b) Removal is considered a disrespectful treatment of the dead &#x2014; <italic>RIDBaZ</italic> to Yad, <italic>Ebel</italic> XIV, 15. One who was buried in a non-Jewish cemetery may be removed to a Jewish one &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh., G.Mah.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn634">2) To his family grave.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn635">3) V. <italic>M.Abr.</italic> to O.&#x1E24;. &#x00A7; 526, n. 18.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn636">4) Y.M.K. II, 4(81b); Sem(H). XIII, 7. V. M.K. 13a, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05DF;</span>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn637">5) For it is a means of atonement for the dead and relieves them from judgment. Cf. Y.M.K. I, 5(80c); Y.San. VI, 12(23d); Deut. XXXII, 43: <italic>&#x2018;And his land doth make expiation for his people.&#x2019;</italic> The rendering of this verse is in accord with Ket. 111a. One who expressed his opinion during lifetime that it is not praiseworthy to be removed from outside of Israel for burial in the Land of Israel (cf. Y.Kil. IX, 4(32d); Y.Ket. XII, 3(35b), is permitted to be removed by his children for burial in the Land of Israel, unless he left specific instructions not to be buried in Israel &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn638">6) Cf. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 364, 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn639">7) A grave in which a corpse was buried without the knowledge or consent of the owner of the ground. In other words, this particular spot was just discovered to be a grave.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn640">8) <italic>Hag. Asheri</italic> to M.K. III.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn641">9) <italic>Or Zaru&#x2018;a</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn642">10) Tan&#x1E25;. <italic>Vay-ye&#x1E25;i</italic> s. 3 (B. VI) &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn643">11) <italic>Hag. Asheri</italic> to M.K. III. For this is disrespectful to the other dead who are buried in the cemetery from which this corpse is removed &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> Others claim that the reason is on account of disgrace which results to the corpse proper. For according to the first reason, the corpse should not be removed even in the case where it is considered a religious act (e.g., removal to the Land of Israel) &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh., R. A. Eger.</italic> V. however, <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn644">12) Thus implied in <italic>Or Zaru&#x2019;a</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Cf. Mak. 11b where it is taught that if a murderer died while in banishment prior to the death of the High Priest (v. Num. XXXV, 9-34), on the latter&#x2019;s death, they transfer the remains of the murderer to his ancestral sepulchre. This is based upon the verse (<italic>ibid.</italic>) <italic>&#x2018;And after the death of the High Priest the slayer shall return to the land of his possession.&#x2019;</italic> The words, <italic>&#x2018;land of his possession&#x2019;</italic> refer to burial in one&#x2019;s ancestral grave. Cf. <italic>supra</italic> par. 1. V. <italic>Rashi</italic> (Gemara <italic>ibid.</italic>) s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05EA;&#x05E0;&#x05D0;</span> and <italic>W.G.</italic> a.l.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn645">13) <italic>Or Zaru&#x2018;a ibid.</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> This means even if he was already buried &#x2014; <italic>G.Mah.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn646">14) Cf. Job XIV, 22: <italic>&#x2018;But his flesh grieveth for him,&#x2019;</italic> which is explained in Ber. 18b, &#x2018;The worm is as painful to the dead body as a needle in sound flesh.&#x2019; This shows that the dead is aware of the pain of its decaying flesh and has no rest from judgment whilst the decomposition goes on &#x2014; <italic>Ta</italic>Z.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn647">15) <italic>RaShBA Resp.</italic> 369 &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> V. <italic>D.M.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn648">16) Lit. &#x2018;inside.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn649">17) Lit. &#x2018;this.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn650">18) <italic>N</italic> in <italic>T.H.</italic> on the authority of Sem. Not found in cur. edd. V. Sem(H). <italic>Baraithoth Ebel Rabbathi</italic> &#x00A7; II, p. 233. <italic>N</italic> (<italic>ibid.</italic>) writes that this is based upon the verse, <italic>&#x2018;Remove not the ancient landmarks&#x2019;</italic> (Prov. XXII, 28), for the grave becomes the possession of the dead person buried therein. V. however, Sifre, <italic>Shofetim</italic> s. 188 where the prohibition is derived from, <italic>&#x2018;Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour&#x2019;s landmark which they of old have set etc.&#x2019;</italic> (Deut. XIX, 14). According to <italic>Or Samea&#x1E25;</italic> (to Yad, <italic>Ebel</italic> XIV, 15) the latter verse is sourse of the prohibition. Where it is customary to remove bones, it is done only after decomposition of the flesh, for the purpose of permanent burial. V. Y.M.K. I, 5(80c); Y.San. VI, 12(23d) and <italic>infra</italic> par. 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn651">19) Ps. CXL, 11. Cf. <italic>Ibn Ezra, Me&#x2019;iri</italic> (ed. Meki&#x1E93;e Nirdamim, Jerusalem 1936) and <italic>Me&#x1E93;udath David</italic> a.l. V. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 403, n. 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn652">20) V. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 362, n. 3. One must be careful not to mix bones of two corpses. V. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 403, 8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn653">21) <italic>N</italic> in <italic>T.H.</italic> has, &#x2018;if of stone it should be buried.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn654">22) Sem(H). XIII, 9; Y.Meg. III, 1(73d). Everything that is buried with the dead is forbidden to be employed for profitable use. V. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 349.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn655">23) Sem. <italic>ibid.</italic> For we apprehend lest this was a coffin that was cleared and is prohibited for profitable use. This applies also to one who finds broken pieces of earthenware &#x2014; <italic>Perisha.</italic> He is not required to burn the boards, since he is not certain that they were part of a coffin &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn656">24) I.e., earth had already been put on the coffin. Otherwise, it may be opened. On <italic>Golel</italic> v. Glos.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn657">25) Lit. &#x2018;brought.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn658">26) The signs of maturity. This ruling is found in Sem(H). IV, 7. Cf. B.B. 154a and 155a where it is related that a certain person who sold his father&#x2019;s estate, died, and the heirs insisted that the deceased was a minor at the time of death, who was legally ineligible to sell any of the father&#x2019;s estate. Consequently, they claimed that the estate should be returned to the surviving heirs. When they asked to have the body exhumed, they were told that it was not permitted because a) one would thereby dishonour the dead, and b) the signs of maturity undergo a change after death. If a deserted wife (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E2;&#x05D2;&#x05D5;&#x05E0;&#x05D4;</span>) claims that she has signs for identifying her husband, the law is that in this case we do open the grave in order to establish whether it was her husband or not &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> Likewise, if they forgot to include the shrouds, the grave may be opened &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> The general principle is that a) anything that is required for the dead proper which was omitted during burial (e.g., shrouds), or b) in the case where a religious act would thereby be performed (e.g., the case of a deserted wife), or c) where there is a loss of money involved (e.g., <italic>supra</italic> in the case of the person who sold his father&#x2019;s estate, were the buyers to insist to have the body exhumed in order to verify whether the seller was a minor or not, so as to avoid a possible loss for themselves), the grave may be opened. For only if the surviving heirs insist to open the grave is it forbidden.

<p>1. A built grave is forbidden for profitable use, but natural<sup><xref rid="fn659">1</xref></sup> earth of a grave is not forbidden.<sup><xref rid="fn660">2</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>Some say</italic><sup><xref rid="fn661">3</xref></sup> <italic>that the earth which they removed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn662">4</xref></sup> <italic>from the grave and then placed it back upon him</italic> [<italic>the dead person</italic>], <italic>which is</italic> [<italic>then</italic>] <italic>regarded as an object</italic> [<italic>originally</italic>] <italic>loose that one subsequently attached is forbidden for profitable use</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn663">5</xref></sup> <italic>Furthermore</italic>, <italic>some prohibit to sit on the stone that is placed upon the grave as a monument</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn664">6</xref></sup> <italic>and some differ with</italic> [<italic>this ruling</italic>] <italic>and permit.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn665">7</xref></sup> <italic>The implements wherewith they dig</italic> [<italic>graves</italic>] <italic>and bury</italic> [<italic>the dead</italic>] <italic>are permitted for profitable use, and one is permitted to make use of them only with the knowledge of the communal manager as in all other</italic> [<italic>cases of public</italic>] <italic>charity</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn666">8</xref></sup> This [ruling viz.,] that a built grave is prohibited [for profitable use] forever, [applies only when one built it for the sake of a dead person and [also] placed him<sup><xref rid="fn667">9</xref></sup> therein,<sup><xref rid="fn668">10</xref></sup> even [if done] with the intention to remove him<sup><xref rid="fn667">9</xref></sup> [later];<sup><xref rid="fn669">11</xref></sup> and even if one placed therein a prematureborn child; but if one built it for his<sup><xref rid="fn667">9</xref></sup> sake and did not place him<sup><xref rid="fn667">9</xref></sup> therein, it is permitted [for profitable use]. Likewise, if he placed him<sup><xref rid="fn667">9</xref></sup> therein with the intention to remove him [later], but did not designate it [for the dead] from the beginning, it is permitted [for profitable use] after he removed him<sup><xref rid="fn667">9</xref></sup> [therefrom].<sup><xref rid="fn670">12</xref></sup> However<sup><xref rid="fn671">13</xref></sup> if he placed him therein with the intention that he remain<sup><xref rid="fn672">14</xref></sup> there forever, it is prohibited [for profitable use] even after he removed him [therefrom; and] even [if] he did not build it for his<sup><xref rid="fn667">9</xref></sup> sake.<sup><xref rid="fn673">15</xref></sup> And if he did not build it for his<sup><xref rid="fn667">9</xref></sup> sake, and he<sup><xref rid="fn667">9</xref></sup> was placed therein and he added a single row of stones, <italic>i.e., a layer, viz., a row of</italic> [<italic>stones</italic>] <italic>in the wall structure</italic> for his<sup><xref rid="fn667">9</xref></sup> sake, the entire [structure] is prohibited [for profitable use]<sup><xref rid="fn674">16</xref></sup> even after he removed him, and even if he buried him therein with the intention to remove him [later].<sup><xref rid="fn673">15</xref></sup> If he recognizes the row of stones that he added for his<sup><xref rid="fn667">9</xref></sup> sake, he removes it and it alone is prohibited, but the rest of the grave is permissible [for profitable use].<sup><xref rid="fn673">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. A grave that has been discovered<sup><xref rid="fn675">17</xref></sup> may be cleared;<sup><xref rid="fn676">18</xref></sup> after it is cleared, the place thereof is [levitically] clean<sup><xref rid="fn677">19</xref></sup> and is permitted for use.<sup><xref rid="fn678">20</xref></sup> A known grave<sup><xref rid="fn679">21</xref></sup> may not be cleared; if it has been cleared, the place thereof is unclean and forbidden for use.<sup><xref rid="fn680">22</xref></sup> Maimonides&#x2019; [version] reads: A grave that has been discovered may be cleared; after it is cleared, the place thereof<sup><xref rid="fn681">23</xref></sup> is unclean and forbidden for use. A known grave may not be cleared; if it has been cleared, the place thereof is [levitically] clean<sup><xref rid="fn682">24</xref></sup> and permitted for use.<sup><xref rid="fn683">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. A <italic>Meth Mi&#x1E93;wah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn684">26</xref></sup> whom one found in a field and buried him therein even without the knowledge of the owner of the field,<sup><xref rid="fn685">27</xref></sup> is forbidden to be cleared away, for a <italic>Meth Mi&#x1E93;wah</italic> takes possession of his place, and when one finds him he must bury him on the spot wherein he found him.<sup><xref rid="fn686">28</xref></sup> If he found him [lying broadways] across a narrow path<sup><xref rid="fn687">29</xref></sup> he must remove <span class="underline">him</span> therefrom on account of the public, so that they should not convey uncleanness by overshadowing him.<sup><xref rid="fn688">30</xref></sup> If he found him between an uncultivated field, <italic>i.e., one that is unplanted and unsown</italic> and a fallow field, <italic>i.e., one that was ploughed but unsown</italic>, &#x2014; he removes him to the uncultivated field;<sup><xref rid="fn689">31</xref></sup> [if] between a fallow field and a field with seed, he removes him to the fallow field;<sup><xref rid="fn690">32</xref></sup> [if] between a field with seed and a tree-planted field, he removes him to the field with seed; if betwwen a tree-planted field and a vineyard field, he removes him to the tree-planted field; but if both [fields] are equal he removes him to the nearer one; and if both are equal in nearness, he may remove [him] to whichever one he prefers.<sup><xref rid="fn691">33</xref></sup> When does this apply? &#x2014; [If he found him] outside the [cemetery]<sup><xref rid="fn692">34</xref></sup> limits, but if he found him within the [cemetery]<sup><xref rid="fn692">34</xref></sup> limits he conveys him to the cemetery.<sup><xref rid="fn693">35</xref></sup> He is designated a <italic>Meth Mi&#x1E93;wah</italic> only if he found his head and the larger portion [of his body].<sup><xref rid="fn694">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. If they found a slain Israelite, they may bury him [in the same condition] as they found him, [viz.,] without shrouds, and they do not even remove his shoes.<sup><xref rid="fn695">37</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>Thus they do</italic> [<italic>with respect</italic>] <italic>to a woman in confinement who died, or regarding a person who fell down</italic><sup><xref rid="fn696">38</xref></sup> <italic>and died</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn697">39</xref></sup> <italic>Some say that they wrap them over their garments</italic> [<italic>with</italic>] <italic>shrouds</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn698">40</xref></sup> <italic>The accepted practice is that one makes no shrouds for them as</italic> [<italic>for</italic>] <italic>other dead, but one buries them in their garments over which</italic> [<italic>they place</italic>] <italic>a sheet as</italic> [<italic>in the case</italic>] <italic>of other dead</italic>.</p>
<p>5. A grave which injures the public, e.g., it is close to the [public] road,<sup><xref rid="fn699">41</xref></sup> even if he was buried therein with the knowledge of the owner of the field, may be cleared,<sup><xref rid="fn700">42</xref></sup> but is prohibited for use,<sup><xref rid="fn701">43</xref></sup> [provided] the grave was there first;<sup><xref rid="fn702">44</xref></sup> but if the road was there first, the place thereof is permitted for use.<sup><xref rid="fn703">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. A grave which one cleared, where it is permitted for use,<sup><xref rid="fn704">46</xref></sup> one may not make of it a shed for straw,<sup><xref rid="fn705">47</xref></sup> or a shed for wood or a storehouse.<sup><xref rid="fn706">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. One who hews a grave for his [dead] father and [then] buried him elsewhere, may himself never be buried therein, on account of his father&#x2019;s honour,<sup><xref rid="fn707">49</xref></sup> but another [person] is permitted to be buried therein.<sup><xref rid="fn708">50</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn659">1) Lit. &#x2018;world.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn660">2) San. 47b regarding the earth of Rab&#x2019;s grave. This is derived (<italic>ibid.</italic>) from, <italic>&#x2018;And he cast the dust thereof</italic> (i.e., of the <italic>Ashera</italic>) <italic>upon the graves of the common people&#x2019;</italic> (II Kings XXIII, 6) whence we learn that the graves of the common people are compared to idols. And just as idols are not prohibited when they are attached, as it is written, <italic>&#x2018;Ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations that ye are to dispossess served their gods, upon the high mountains&#x2019;</italic> (Deut. XII, 2), i.e., their gods which are <italic>upon</italic> the high mountains (are forbidden for use), but not the mountains which themselves are their gods, &#x2014; so too, whatever belongs to the dead, i.e., attached, is not prohibited. However, a built grave is not considered attached to the soil, and as in the case of detached idols, is prohibited (v. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 145, 3). V. Meg. 29a and <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 363, 1, according to which even natural soil of burial grounds is forbidden for profitable use and consequently contradicts the present ruling. <italic>B.Hillel</italic> therefore, explains that in our case (Gemara San. <italic>ibid.</italic>) where it is reported that Samuel permitted people to take earth from Rab&#x2019;s grave and apply it as a remedy on the first day of an attack of fever, we deal with natural soil taken from a grave and applied as a remedy only, which is permissible; whereas in the other passage (Gemara Meg. <italic>ibid.</italic>) the natural soil was not used for a remedial purpose, and consequently, is forbidden for profitable use, not because legally this is so, but rather because this is considered disrespectful treatment of the dead. Cf. also <italic>Mord.</italic> Meg. <italic>ibid.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn661">3) <italic>Hag. Asheri</italic> M.K. III.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn662">4) Lit. &#x2018;they took.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn663">5) <italic>Tur</italic> on the authority of <italic>R. Isaiah</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> What is natural soil? &#x2014; One who hews a grotto in a rock that was never detached (<italic>Tur</italic>). The sides of the grave and the bottom are certainly not forbidden. The example of the grotto is cited in order to emphasize that even the earth above it is not prohibited but is regarded as natural soil &#x2014; <italic>ShaK. A.H.</italic> elucidates the ruling here as follows: An object originally loose and subsequently attached (<span dir="rtl">&#x05EA;&#x05DC;&#x05D5;&#x05E9; &#x05D5;&#x05DC;&#x05D1;&#x05E1;&#x05D5;&#x05E3; &#x05D7;&#x05D1;&#x05E8;&#x05D5;</span>) is forbidden only if it was removed from one place and attached in another place, as in the case of idols. For this reason a built grave is forbidden for use. Not so, however, in the case of earth which was dug out for burial purposes and then put back into the same grave. In the latter case it should be considered &#x2018;natural soil&#x2019; <italic>contra R. Isaiah</italic> and in agreement with those authorities who permit (v. <italic>infra Isserles</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn664">6) <italic>Tur</italic> on the authority of <italic>R. Isaiah.</italic> Thus also <italic>Hag. Asheri</italic> in the name of <italic>Or Zaru&#x2018;a M.K.</italic> III &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> This is considered &#x2018;an object originally loose and subsequently attached,&#x2019; and refers as stated here, only to the stone placed on the grave proper. But the tombstone that is placed at the side of the grave is permissible for use. V. <italic>A.H.</italic> It is forbidden to sell a broken tombstone or to lean on a tombstone or to tread upon graves &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> Two reasons are advanced for this prohibition, a) it is forbidden for profitable use, b) it is disrespectful to the dead &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> Cf. also <italic>G.Mah.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn665">7) <italic>Twr</italic> on the authority of <italic>Asheri</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> V. <italic>supra</italic> n. 5. Cf. B.B. 101a, <italic>RaShBaM</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05E7;&#x05DE;&#x05D9;&#x05EA;&#x05D3;&#x05E9;&#x05D9;</span> according to which temporary treading upon graves in order to reach another place on the cemetery, is permitted. Old tombstones may be used for other dead, but are forbidden for profitable use. V. <italic>supra</italic> n. 6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn666">8) <italic>RaShBA Resp.</italic> 97 &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> V. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 349.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn667">9) The dead person.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn668">10 In accord with San. 48a that both designation and the material act are required.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn669">11) In accord with the interpretation of <italic>N</italic> to San. <italic>ibid.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05E2;</span>&#x2019;<span dir="rtl">&#x05D2; &#x05D3;&#x05E4;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05D4;</span> i.e., the prohibition remains in force even if the corpse was later removed therefrom. V. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 363, 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn670">12) San. <italic>ibid.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn671">13) Lit. &#x2018;but.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn672">14) Lit. &#x2018;be.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn673">15) San. <italic>ibid.</italic> The very fact that his intention is to place the corpse therein forever constitutes &#x2018;designation&#x2019; which coincides with &#x2018;the material act&#x2019; of placing the corpse therein &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn674">16) Since it is unknown which row was added.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn675">17) One in which the corpse was buried without the consent of the owner of the ground.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn676">18) We do not say that perhaps a <italic>Meth Mi&#x1E93;wah</italic> (v. Glos.) was buried therein who takes possession of his place (v. <italic>infra</italic> par. 3), for if this were so, the matter would have been known (San. 47b).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn677">19) Since the corpse was buried therein without the consent of the owner of the ground, he does not take possession of his place.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn678">20) For a person cannot prohibit something which does not belong to him (Pes. 90a. V. Yeb. 66b). We deal here with a &#x2018;built grave,&#x2019; for if it refers to &#x2018;natural soil&#x2019; of a grave, it would not be prohibited in any case (v. <italic>supra</italic> par. 1) &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn679">21) In which one was buried with the owner&#x2019;s consent.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn680">22) San. 47b. This was a Rabbinical precautionary measure against unwarranted removal of bones.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn681">23) &#x2018;The place thereof&#x2019; refers to the surrounding parts of the field where more bones may be discovered.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn682">24) Since it is known that no other graves are found in the environs.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn683">25) Yad, <italic>Tumath Meth</italic> VIII, 5 (V. <italic>Kes. Mish.</italic> a.l.) derived from Y.Naz. IX, 3(57d). Cf. Tosef(Z). Ohol. XVI, 9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn684">26) V. Glos.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn685">27) Derived from San. <italic>ibid.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn686">28) One of the ten enactments laid down by Joshua upon entering the Land of Israel was that a <italic>Meth Mi&#x1E93;wah</italic> should be buried in whatever spot he is found (B.K. 81a-b; &#x2018;Er. 17a; Sot. 45b and cf. San. 47b). Nowadays this law is no longer applicable and we follow the law of the land &#x2014; <italic>Ta</italic>Z, <italic>ShaK, A.H.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn687">29) Obstructing the way so that people passing by are compelled to step over the corpse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn688">30) So as not to cause defilement to Priests and those who abserve levitical purity through overshadowing or forming a shelter over the corpse. Cf. Ohol. III, 1 seq.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn689">31) In order to reduce the damage as much as possible.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn690">32) B.K. 81b and &#x2018;Er. 17b in accord with R. Bibi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn691">33) Sem(H). IV, 18; Y.Naz. VII, 1(56b). The latter source adds: &#x2018;If found between a tree-planted field and a vineyard, he should remove him to the vineyard.&#x2019; Thus Yad, <italic>Tumath Meth</italic> VIII, 7 and <italic>Sefer Ha-Eshkol.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn692">34) Thus <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn693">35) Y.Naz. VII, 1(55d-56a-b). Thus also in Sem. <italic>ibid.</italic> according to the version of <italic>N</italic> in <italic>T.H.</italic> Not found in cur. ed. of Sem (V. <italic>Baraithoth Ebel Rabbathi</italic> IV, p. 245).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn694">36) Y.Naz. <italic>ibid.</italic> and Sem. in accord with version of <italic>N.</italic> Needless to say that the law of <italic>Meth Mi&#x1E93;wah</italic> applies only if the head and the larger portion of the body were found intact. With respect to the head if found in one place and the body in another, v. Mishna Sot. 45b and Gemara <italic>ibid.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn695">37) <italic>B.Yos.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn696">38) E.g., from a roof top.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn697">39) <italic>MaHaRIL</italic> s. 65 &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> If there was bleeding, the <italic>Tohorah</italic> (v. Glos.) should not be performed, for the blood which also requires burial (v. <italic>infra</italic>) will thereby be removed. The dead person should therefore be buried in his clothes. This applies only if the person died while wearing his clothes, but if after suffering a fall, the person was confined to bed and died some days later, after his clothes were removed, and there was no bleeding, the <italic>Tohorah</italic> is performed and the corpse is wrapped in shrouds as usual. There is however, a distinction to be made between the case of one who fell from a roof top and one who was murdered. In the latter case, even if the blood flow had ceased when the corpse was found, he is buried in the condition he was found in order &#x2018;to raise our anger&#x2019; and possibly avenge the slain person; whereas in the former case where the person fell from a roof top, this is not applicable. Similarly, in the case of a woman who died in confinement, and the blood flow still continues, we bury her in the garments she wore at the time of death. But if death occurred some days or weeks later, at which time the blood flow had already ceased, we deal with her as with other dead and bury her in shrouds. A further reason for burying a slain person in his clothes is that there is fear that at least a fourth of a <italic>Log</italic> (v. Glos.) of blood that escaped, &#x2014; the smallest quantity required to sustain life, &#x2014; is absorbed in the clothes. Hence, he should be buried in his clothes. For the very same reason even the shoes should not be removed, since there may be a similar quantity absorbed in them. Even the earth surrounding him, which absorbed blood, should be buried. The same principle would therefore apply to one who fell from a roof top, or in the case of a house which collapsed upon a person, or a confinement case, where there was a flow of blood, and consequently there is an absorption thereof in the garments, &#x2014; in all these cases, since there is an absorption of blood in the garments, &#x2014; they should be buried with the corpse. This would not apply to one who froze to death or was drowned, for since there was no flow of bloood, they are buried in shrouds as usual &#x2014; <italic>MaHaRIL</italic> (<italic>ibid</italic>.), <italic>Ta</italic>Z and <italic>ShaK</italic>. V. <italic>P.Tesh</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn698">40) <italic>Hag. Maim.</italic> on the authority of <italic>R. Isaac b. Meir Dueren</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn699">41) San. 47b. It thereby causes defilement to all passers-by.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn700">42) Since this ruling follows the ruling (San. <italic>ibid.</italic>) of a &#x2018;known grave&#x2019; (v. <italic>supra</italic> par. 2), it follows that in this case even if the owner&#x2019;s consent was obtained, it may be cleared. Hence, <italic>Caro&#x2019;s</italic> ruling &#x2014; <italic>W.G.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn701">43) The injury caused to the public does not warrant a decree of impurity to the place thereof, but it is forbidden for profitable use, since the prohibition is Biblical, and does not lapse even after the corpse is removed. This refers to a &#x2018;built grave&#x2019; (v. <italic>supra</italic> par. 1 and notes) &#x2014; <italic>Ta</italic>Z</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn702">44) Derived from Y.Naz. IX, 3(57d).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn703">45) On the principle that a person cannot prohibit that which does not belong to him. In this case the road belongs to the public &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn704">46) E.g., if the corpse was buried therein without the owner&#x2019;s consent.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn705">47) Sem. adds: &#x2018;or a stall.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn706">48) Sem(H). XIII, 9; <italic>Mord.</italic> M.K. III end. These are prohibited because of disrespect to one&#x2019;s father who was buried therein. However, a dwelling would not be regarded disrespectful &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn707">49) San. 48a. V. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 240, 9. Even &#x2018;natural soil&#x2019; is considered forbidden in this case &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> On account of one&#x2019;s father mere designation prohibits. V. <italic>supra</italic> n. 10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn708">50) V. San. 47b, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05EA;&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05D4;</span>. <italic>N</italic> writes that this accords with Abaye; according to Raba it would be prohibited to everyone. V. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 349 and notes. All relatives excluding the sons and daughters are permitted to be buried therein.

<p>1. One who sells his [family] grave, the path to his grave, the place of his [funeral] halt<sup><xref rid="fn714">1</xref></sup> and the place of his lamentation, the members of the family may come and bury him against the will of the buyer,<sup><xref rid="fn715">2</xref></sup> and they return his money.<sup><xref rid="fn716">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. A woman who inherited a grave from her family maybe buried in it herself, but not her descendants,<sup><xref rid="fn717">4</xref></sup> unless she saw them during her lifetime.<sup><xref rid="fn718">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. [If] her father says, &#x2018;Let her be buried beside me,&#x2019; and her husband says, &#x2018;Let her be buried beside me,&#x2019; &#x2014; she is buried beside her husband.<sup><xref rid="fn719">6</xref></sup> And some [versions] read,<sup><xref rid="fn720">7</xref></sup> &#x2014; she is buried beside her father. If she has children, and says, &#x2018;[Bury me] beside my children,&#x2019; &#x2014; they bury her beside her children.</p>
<p>4. [If] her father says, &#x2018;Let her not be buried beside me,&#x2019; and her husband [also] says, &#x2018;Let her not be buried beside me,&#x2019; &#x2014; they bury her beside her husband.<sup><xref rid="fn721">8</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn714">1) Seven halts were made by the funeral escort upon returning from a burial for the purpose of lamentation or consolation.

And as to the ruling (<italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 344, 10) that if one left instructions not to make a lamentation for him after death, he is obeyed, it is different in the present case, because a) his financial position compelled him to act thus; whereas in the former ruling (<italic>supra</italic>) the instructions were given at death; or b) here by selling the place for lamentation, it is derogatory to all the members of the family; whereas there he only denied himself a lament; or c) the very fact that here strangers will come and make their lamentation casts a slur upon the whole family &#x2014; <italic>N, B.Yos.</italic> and <italic>ShaK.</italic> This ruling applies also to one who sells his family pew in the Synagogue (&#x1E24;.M. &#x00A7; 175, 53 <italic>G.</italic>).</ftnote>

<p>3.

<p>2. [With respect to trees] that one plants on a cemetery, &#x2014; [the law is that] it is permitted to harvest their fruit, since they are not [planted] on the graves proper.<sup><xref rid="fn757">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. A new grave is measured, sold and divided and an old one is not measured nor sold nor divided.<sup><xref rid="fn758">19</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn740">1) Meg. 29a. The reason is because of respect to the dead (Gemara <italic>ibid</italic>.). This applies not only to the individual graves, but to the entire cemetery, for once a piece of ground has been set aside to be used as a cemetery, it enjoys a status of holiness, on the same principle as a Synagogue (v. Shab. 45a; O.&#x1E24;. &#x00A7; 152, 1).

<ftnote id="fn758">19) Sem(H). XIV, 3.

In the case of an old grave in which a corpse was once buried, but for some valid reason was removed, it is forbidden for use. Actually measuring is not forbidden, but since an old grave is not sold or divided, for the reason just stated, it follows that measuring is not necessary &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> Cf. <italic>Tur</italic> for another explanation.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn759">1) V. Glos.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn760">2) The <italic>Kohen</italic> stands cautioned with respect to defilement for the dead as is written: <italic>&#x2018;There shall non defile himself for the dead among his people&#x2019;</italic> (Lev. XXI, 1). An abortion defiles through contact (i.e., to become unclean when touching uncleanness), carriage (i.e., to become unclean when carrying uncleanness) and overshadowing (i.e., levitical uncleanness arising from being under the same shelter with, or forming a shelter over, a corpse etc.). V. Ohol. II, 1; VII, 4; XVIII, 7. V. Ohol. II, 1, where among those things which defile by overshadowing, a corpse is mentioned, which refers according to Naz. 50a to an abortion of less than the size of an olive in which the limbs were not tied together by the sinews. Hence, if a woman miscarries after forty days elapse from conception, it is forbidden for a <italic>Kohen</italic> to be present in the same house where the miscarriage takes place. Prior to the forty days it is regarded as a mere fluid. This ruling applies even if the <italic>Kohen&#x2019;s</italic> wife miscarried &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> In the case of the uncleanness of carrion (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D8;&#x05D5;&#x05DE;&#x05D0;&#x05EA; &#x05E0;&#x05D1;&#x05DC;&#x05D4;</span>) creeping things (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D8;&#x05D5;&#x05DE;&#x05D0;&#x05EA; &#x05E9;&#x05E8;&#x05E6;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>) or one experiencing a seminal emission (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D6;&#x05D1;, &#x05D6;&#x05D1;&#x05D4;</span>). the law of the <italic>Kohen</italic> is similar to that of the Israelite.</ftnote> 
<ftnote id="fn761">3) E.g., blood and the like. Sifra Lev. <italic>ibid.</italic> Cf. <italic>Torah Temimah</italic> a.l.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn762">4) The sources of defilement enumerated here are mentioned in Naz. VII, 2-3 and Gemara <italic>ibid.</italic> For some of these sources of uncleanness, the Nazirite (v. Glos.) upon contracting them had to cut his hair; for others he did not have to cut his hair. In Sem(H). IV, 12 (cf. also Tosef(Z). Mak. IV, 17) it is stated: &#x2018;Every defilement (contracted from a corpse), for which the Nazirite must cut his hair, (a <italic>Kohen</italic>, if he defiles himself for such uncleanness) receives forty (in reality thirty-nine) lashes; and a defilement for which the Nazirite must not cut his hair, (a <italic>Kohen</italic>) does not receive forty lashes.&#x2019; This is explained (v. <italic>Be&#x2019;er ha-Golah</italic>) that even in a case where a <italic>Kohen</italic> defiles himself for an uncleanness which does not involve flogging, viz., when the Nazirite is not required to crop his hair, the prohibition still stands.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn763">5) <italic>Golel</italic> (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D2;&#x05D5;&#x05DC;&#x05DC;</span>) refers to the stone that covers the corpse; <italic>Dofek</italic> (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D3;&#x05D5;&#x05E4;&#x05E7;</span>), to the side stones. <italic>Rashi</italic> (Ket. 4b) explains that <italic>Golel</italic> is the cover on the coffin. The rt. is <span dir="rtl">&#x05D2;&#x05DC;&#x05DC;</span> which means &#x2018;to roll,&#x2019; i.e., a stone that was too heavy to be lifted but had to be rolled into position. V. Gen. XXIX, 3; Prov. XXVI, 27; Ezra V, 8. <italic>Dofek</italic> is from the rt. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D3;&#x05E4;&#x05E7;</span> &#x2018;to knock or strike against,&#x2019; i.e., the frame supporting the <italic>Golel.</italic> Cf. other explanations in <italic>Tur</italic> a.l. and v. <italic>J.E.</italic> XII, p. 188; <italic>Levy</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D2;&#x05D5;&#x05DC;&#x05DC;</span>; <italic>Krauss</italic> T.A.

<ftnote id="fn764">6) Even if it is a limb severed from the <italic>Kohen</italic>&#x2019;s body. V. Yad, <italic>Tum&#x2019;ath Meth</italic> III, beg.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn765">7) V. Ohol. VIII, 2. Although the uncleanness is doubtful, yet the <italic>Kohen</italic> is cautioned against defiling himself for it. If, however, it were known where the uncleanness is found, it would be permissible for him to stand under those parts which do not overshadow &#x2014; <italic>Ta</italic>Z, <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn766">8) V. Ohol. XVII, 1. Also &#x2018;Er. 47a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn767">9) I.e., the graves which are unknown. V. also Ohol. XVII, 1. This refers to the time when the soil of the Land of Israel was presumed to be clean and it was not permissible for a <italic>Kohen</italic> to go to the land of the heathens, i.e., outside the Land of Israel, for the heathens buried their dead everywhere &#x2014; <italic>Ta</italic>Z, <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>

Hence, a <italic>Kohen</italic> too, is cautioned against it and becomes unclean through overshadowing (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 4). Those authorities, however, who permit, maintain that a) according to Tosef. Ohol. I, a Nazirite does not cut his hair for such defilement, and b) today we are all considered to be in the category of those made unclean through contact with a corpse and since we have no ashes of the red heifer used for lustration purposes (Num. XIX), we remain in the same state of uncleanness, but do not increase it &#x2014; <italic>W.G., A.H.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn771">13) I.e., they may defile themselves for a sword or the like that was in contact with a corpse. A <italic>Kohen</italic> may enter a house in which there is a tombstone that was removed from a grave &#x2014; <italic>&#x1E24;okmath Adam</italic> a.o.</ftnote>

According to another opinion, since the Bible in speaking of the Nazirite&#x2019;s prohibition against uncleanness even for near-of-kin, states: <italic>&#x2018;When they die&#x2019;</italic> (Num.

<p>1. A <italic>Kohen</italic><sup><xref rid="fn783">23</xref></sup> is forbidden to enter beneath an overshadowed space<sup><xref rid="fn782">1</xref></sup> under which there is a corpse, even if it is very large;<sup><xref rid="fn784">2</xref></sup> and [he is] even [forbidden to enter] into another [adjoining] house or another [adjoining] upper storey, which open into that house by means of an opening a square handbreadth in size, and [the prohibition also applies to entering] a house [which opens] into that [latter] house ad infinitum.<sup><xref rid="fn785">3</xref></sup> But if one stopped up the opening, it is permissible for him to enter the other [adjoining] house, for the closure forms a partition [against the uncleanness], even if one has not renounced ownership therein<sup><xref rid="fn786">4</xref></sup> so that it remain there forever.<sup><xref rid="fn787">5</xref></sup> This applies only if one stopped up the entire opening, but if one did not stop up the entire opening, but [only] reduced it from [the size of] a [square] handbreadth, &#x2014; [the law is that] if one placed it<sup><xref rid="fn788">6</xref></sup> to remain there forever, it reduces [the size of the opening] and forms a partition against<sup><xref rid="fn789">7</xref></sup> the uncleanness so that it pass not through; and if [one did] not [place it<sup><xref rid="fn788">6</xref></sup> to remain there forever], it does not reduce [the size of the opening].<sup><xref rid="fn790">8</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>Everything that contracts uncleanness forms not a partition against uncleanness</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn791">9</xref></sup> <italic>A closure in a window space is regarded</italic> [<italic>effective</italic>] <italic>only if it can remain</italic> [<italic>therein</italic>] <italic>without support.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn792">10</xref></sup></p>

<p>4. A forecourt that is surrounded by wall-projections<sup><xref rid="fn799">17</xref></sup> and porticoes,<sup><xref rid="fn800">18</xref></sup> and there is uncleanness in one of the houses; if all the doors<sup><xref rid="fn801">19</xref></sup> of the houses and the windows are locked up, the uncleanness spreads<sup><xref rid="fn802">20</xref></sup> under the wall-projections and the porticoes,<sup><xref rid="fn803">21</xref></sup> &#x2014; <italic>the reason being that since ultimately the uncleanness will leave therefrom, we regard</italic> [<italic>the uncleanness</italic>] <italic>as though it had already left</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn804">22</xref></sup> <italic>Therefore, some adopt the stricter view</italic> [<italic>regarding</italic>] <italic>Kohanim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn783">23</xref></sup> &#x2014; [<italic>viz., not</italic>] <italic>to go through the city gate through which the corpse will ultimately leave</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn805">24</xref></sup> <italic>and some permit</italic> [<italic>this</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn806">25</xref></sup> <italic>And he who adopts the lenient view loses nothing in a locality where it is not the custom to adopt the stricter view.</italic> And if a window or a door was opened<sup><xref rid="fn807">26</xref></sup> from the other side,<sup><xref rid="fn808">27</xref></sup> and those of the side [facing] the forecourt were all locked up, the uncleanness does not spread<sup><xref rid="fn802">20</xref></sup> under the wall-projections.<sup><xref rid="fn809">28</xref></sup> And if one of them<sup><xref rid="fn810">29</xref></sup> was also opened toward the side of the wall-projections, the uncleanness spreads<sup><xref rid="fn802">20</xref></sup> from the house under the wall-projections.<sup><xref rid="fn811">30</xref></sup> Likewise, if [there is] uncleanness under the wall-projections, it enters from under them into the house.<sup><xref rid="fn812">31</xref></sup> So too,<sup><xref rid="fn813">32</xref></sup> roofs that project above toward the outside over the doors<sup><xref rid="fn814">33</xref></sup> of the houses, and [there is] uncleanness in one of the houses, &#x2014; [the law is that] all the houses, the doors of which are open, are unclean.<sup><xref rid="fn815">34</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>Two roofs</italic> [<italic>alongside each other</italic>] <italic>that do not touch one another, although there is between them only</italic> [<italic>a space</italic>] <italic>of less than three</italic> [<italic>handbreadths</italic>], <italic>are not considered as connected with respect to uncleanness, for we do not apply</italic><sup><xref rid="fn816">35</xref></sup> [<italic>the principle of</italic>] <italic>Labud</italic><sup><xref rid="fn817">36</xref></sup> <italic>in order to adopt a stricter view.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn818">37</xref></sup> <italic>And if they</italic><sup><xref rid="fn819">38</xref></sup> [<italic>projected</italic>] <italic>one above the other, although they</italic><sup><xref rid="fn819">38</xref></sup> <italic>do not touch</italic> [<italic>each other</italic>], <italic>we apply</italic> [<italic>the principle of</italic>] <italic>&#x2018;press</italic> [<italic>and</italic>] <italic>throw</italic> [<italic>it</italic>] <italic>down,&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn820">39</xref></sup> <italic>and</italic> [<italic>they are considered</italic>] <italic>as though they touched</italic> [<italic>each other</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn821">40</xref></sup> <italic>The Kohanim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn783">23</xref></sup> <italic>cannot compel the near-of-kin of the corpse that they remove the dead person in order that they be permitted to enter their</italic> [<italic>adjoining</italic>] <italic>house</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn822">41</xref></sup> <italic>unless</italic> [<italic>it is</italic>] <italic>in a locality where it is the accepted custom to take out all the corpses</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn823">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. It is forbidden [for a <italic>Kohen</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn783">23</xref></sup> to draw near within four cubits of a corpse<sup><xref rid="fn824">43</xref></sup> or a grave. This applies only if the grave is not marked by partitions at a height of ten handbreadths, but if it is distinctly marked by partitions at a height of ten handbreadths or by a ditch ten handbreadths deep, he must keep away only [at a distance of] four handbreadths.<sup><xref rid="fn825">44</xref></sup> <italic>It is permissible for a Kohen</italic><sup><xref rid="fn783">23</xref></sup> <italic>to stand beside a house in which there is a corpse and he is permitted to touch its walls, provided that nothing overshadows upon him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn826">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. A corpse that lies in a boat, if it<sup><xref rid="fn827">46</xref></sup> is small [so] that it rocks when one treads in it, it is forbidden for a <italic>Kohen</italic><sup><xref rid="fn783">23</xref></sup> to enter it.<sup><xref rid="fn828">47</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn782">1) Lit. &#x2018;a tent.&#x2019; Uncleanness through overshadowing (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D8;&#x05D5;&#x05DE;&#x05D0;&#x05EA; &#x05D0;&#x05D4;&#x05DC;</span>) takes place in one of three ways: a) when a person or a vessel or food are present together with a corpse (or an olive&#x2019;s bulk from a corpse) under the same roof space. In this case another object (the roof) forms a tent over the person etc. and the corpse (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D3;&#x05D1;&#x05E8; &#x05D0;&#x05D7;&#x05E8; &#x05DE;&#x05D0;&#x05D4;&#x05D9;&#x05DC; &#x05E2;&#x05DC;&#x05D9;&#x05D5; &#x05D5;&#x05E2;&#x05DC; &#x05D4;&#x05DE;&#x05EA;</span>); b) when a corpse or an olive&#x2019;s bulk from a corpse overshadow from above, a person or vessels beneath. In this case the corpse forms the tent; c) when the person is present above the corpse or the olive&#x2019;s bulk from a corpse. In this case the person overshadows. Cf. Num. XIX, 14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn783">23) V. Glos.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn784">2) Meg. 26b a.e.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn785">3) V. Ohol. III, 6-7 from which the following principles are derived: a) If a corpse lies in a room, whatever is within the room suffers corpse-uncleanness, and if the room has many doors or exits, even if they are closed, all objects which lie beneath the lintels of these doors or exits become unclean, because we assume that the corpse may be removed through any one of the exits, at which time the corpse and the objects will be together under the lintels, and the objects will suffer uncleanness through overshadowing (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 1a). Hence, we regard the objects and the corpse as if they were already present under the lintels of the door or exits. But if we know through which exit the corpse will be removed, then only that particular exit suffers uncleanness, not the others. This means that that particular exit saves the objects beneath the other exits from uncleanness through overshadowing. The minimum size of such an exit must be one handbreadth square for an olive&#x2019;s bulk from a corpse in the room, to prevent uncleanness from spreading to the other exits, and a minimum of four handbreadths square opening will prevent the uncleanness from spreading to the other exits in the case where an entire corpse is present in the room. The reason for the different sizes regarding the openings, depends upon the size of the uncleanness, for it is feasible to remove an olive&#x2019;s bulk from a corpse through an opening one handbreadth square, and an entire corpse through an opening four handbreadths square (v. also Ohol. VII, 3); b) If there are two adjoining houses or rooms and in the intervening wall there is an opening of one handbreadth square, and in one of the houses or rooms there is a corpse or an olive&#x2019;s bulk from a corpse, the uncleanness passes to the adjoining room or house in which all objects become unclean. In this case the opening need not be more than a square handbreadth in order to give passage to the uncleanness of an entire corpse; c) An object (e.g., a board) which is one handbreadth square and one handbreadth high (i.e., between the board above and the olive&#x2019;s bulk from a corpse which lies beneath, there is a space of not less than one handbreadth), brings uncleanness to other objects in the same space and forms a partition against uncleanness to objects above it. But if the roof (i.e., the top of the board) is less than one handbreadth high, the uncleanness breaks through the solid matter and rises and goes down. Cf. Ohol. VI, 6; VII, 1-2; IX, 13, 14, 16; X, 6-7; XII, 6-7; XV, 1, 3, 7. <italic>ShaK</italic> states that the wife of a <italic>Kohen</italic>, who is pregnant may enter the &#x2018;tent of a corpse&#x2019; and there is no fear that she may give birth to a male child who would then be forbidden to be present there, for a double doubt exists: a) perhaps it will be a non-viable birth to which this apprehension does not apply, or b) if it is a viable birth, perhaps it will be a female child. This point, however, is questioned on the principle that &#x2018;a clean object that has been swallowed (in this case, the child within the mother) cannot be rendered unclean&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D8;&#x05D4;&#x05E8;&#x05D4; &#x05D1;&#x05DC;&#x05D5;&#x05E2;&#x05D4;</span>) (Hul. 71a). Consequently, the following explanation of the above case is offered: We deal here with a case where the time for giving birth has already approached, and there is fear that the child might push out its head and be regarded as born and hence is not regarded as a &#x2018;swallowed object.&#x2019; Consequently, since there is a double doubt, the pregnant wife of the <italic>Kohen</italic> may enter the &#x2018;tent of a corpse&#x2019; &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> Uncleanness is not conveyed through many openings which together make up one square handbreadth, e.g., in the case of trellis-work. The square handbreadth must be open in one spot for the uncleanness to pass through. Otherwise, the opening is considered stopped up (cf. Ohol. XIII, 1) &#x2014; <italic>Ta</italic>Z, <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>

V. <italic>R. Samson of Sens</italic> and <italic>Maim</italic>. to Ohol. VI, 2 and cf O.&#x1E24; &#x00A7; 629, 8. <italic>Ta</italic>Z reports the ruling of a certain authority in the following case which he analyses and rejects: There was an uncleanness in a house adjoining a Synagogue, which passed through the [Synagogue window in the women&#x2019;s section, and a ruling was given by a certain authority, that in order to form a partition against the uncleanness, the window opening should be stopped up by the curtain which served as a partition between the men&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s section, and was suspended on iron hooks. <italic>Ta</italic>Z opposes this ruling (v. however, <italic>&#x1E24;id. ha-Gershuni</italic> who accepts it) and claims that it is erroneous for the following reasons: a) According to the Mishna Ohol. VIII, 1, a sheet or a mat form a partition against uncleanness only if spread out tentwise, which is not the case here, and hence, the curtain cannot form a partition against the uncleanness of the adjoining house (v. <italic>R. Samson of Sens ibid.</italic> and Yad, <italic>Tumath Meth</italic> XIII); b) The reason that the curtain cannot form a partition against the uncleanness is because the law states that vessels (in this case the curtain hooks) cannot form a partition, since the curtain without the hooks would not remain suspended. Consequently, the main items are the hooks and not the curtain (v. Yad <italic>Tumath Meth</italic> XVIII; B.B. 19b s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05E8;&#x05D5;&#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05DF;</span> V. this note beg.) c) A partition formed by a door or window that cannot stand without the support of metal hinges is not considered valid (although the hinges are considered as attached to the ground and do not contract uncleanness. V. Kel. XI, 2 and cf. Ohol. VI, 2). Hence, the same applies with respect to the curtain and the hooks. <italic>ShaK</italic>, however, rejects this. Cf. <italic>G.Mah.</italic> A closure of trellis-work in a metal door does not prevent passage of uncleanness (v. <italic>ShaK</italic> who modifies this ruling) &#x2014; <italic>Ta</italic>Z. It is permissible for a <italic>Kohen</italic> to travel by train, although there is a possibility that a corpse is being transported. Likewise, is it permitted for a <italic>Kohen</italic> to travel by plane, although the plane passes over burial grounds &#x2014; <italic>Sh.M.B.</italic> (vol IV, p. 278-9).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn793">11) Ohol. X, 1ff. Quite a number of laws are enumerated <italic>ibid.</italic> with respect to overshadowing in connection with hatchways, yet the present law is stated because it contains a novel ruling, viz., that it is permissible to enter the ground floor where the uncleanness is found, and not the upper storey &#x2014; <italic>B.Yos.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn794">12) For the uncleanness breaks through and rises (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D8;&#x05D5;&#x05DE;&#x05D0;&#x05D4; &#x05D1;&#x05D5;&#x05E7;&#x05E2;&#x05EA; &#x05D5;&#x05E2;&#x05D5;&#x05DC;&#x05D4;</span> v. Ohol. VI, 6), since it lies directly under the hatchway, despite the fact that the hatchway is less than a square handbreadth in size. The uncleanness does not spread to the sides of the ground floor, for it has an opening above in order to rise &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> The uncleanness does not cleave downwards, back into the lower floor, since the opening is less than a square handbreadth (<italic>Asheri</italic>). And again, since there is only an olive&#x2019;s bulk from a corpse in the ground floor, the law is that although the uncleanness will eventually be removed through the door opening, the ground floor does not become unclean now, because the uncleanness which rose to the upper storey, is already regarded as present in the public domain, for the opening is less than a square handbreadth. Hence, we may infer that if a room in a ground floor has no roof space over it (but there is a roof over the upper storey. Thus <italic>&#x1E24;id. ha-Gershuni</italic> on <italic>Ta</italic>Z), it is forbidden for a <italic>Kohen</italic> to be present in any part of the ground floor, for since the uncleanness will ultimately be removed through the door opening of this uncovered ground-room, the uncleanness cleaves back into it and thence through the door opening, for it must be borne in mind that the entire ground-room is uncovered unlike above where the hatchway is less than a square handbreadth in size (v. <italic>&#x1E24;id. ha-Gershuni</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>Ta</italic>Z.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn795">13) And there are no other openings from the rooms save the one leading to the house.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn796">14) For the uncleanness must eventually pass through the house. Hence, the house is regarded as having uncleanness of an olive&#x2019;s bulk in size.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn797">15) The rooms are clean because the uncleanness in one room must not pass through the other room. The closed doors form a partition against that which is in the rooms, but do not prevent the passage of the uncleanness into the house. V. Kel. VIII, 6.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn803">21) Derived from Ohol. VII, 3. If all the doors of the house in which there is uncleanness are locked up, i.e., both those facing the forecourt and those behind the house, the uncleanness spreads under the wall-projections and the porticoes, and everything beneath them becomes unclean. For since the uncleanness will ultimately be removed through the opening facing the forecourt, it is regarded as if the uncleanness is already present there, and spreads under the overshadowed space to the other houses (<italic>ShaK</italic>) if the latter have an opening of a square handbreadth in size. But if all the openings or doors of the adjoining houses are locked up, the houses are clean.

<ftnote id="fn815">34) Hence if a <italic>Kohen</italic> is present in one of the houses or rooms to which the uncleanness spreads, the doors and windows of which are shut up, and he is aware that the uncleanness reaches his dwelling, it is forbidden for him to leave before the corpse is removed. Likewise, if there are two rooms, one within the other, i.e., the outer one opens into the courtyard and the inner one has right of way through the outer one, and the corpse lies in the outer one, the <italic>Kohen</italic> may enter the inner room and lock up all the doors and windows leading to the outer room. But if the corpse is in the inner room, the <italic>Kohen</italic> is forbidden to be present in the outer one, even if he locked up the doors of the inner room. However, if each room has a separate door leading to the outside, and it is intended to remove the corpse through the door of the inner room the <italic>Kohen</italic> is permitted to remain in the outer room. Likewise is it permissible to keep the corpse in a cellar which has a separate door leading to the outside. But if the cellar has no door leading to the outside, and the corpse will ultimately be removed through the house, two conditions must be fulfilled in order to permit the <italic>Kohen</italic> to remain in the house above the cellar, viz., a) that there should be an opening in the cellar at least four handbreadths square, and b) that there should be no overshadowing space a handbreadth in width over the cellar opening. So too, if the corpse is in an upper storey that has an opening through which the corpse will be removed, and the opening has no overshadowing space above it, <italic>Kohanim</italic> are then permitted to remain on the ground floor. If there is a cross-beam above an alley-entry (v. &#x2018;Er. I, 1ff) which is one handbreadth in width, and this cross-beam connects houses from one side of the alley-entry to the other, even if one end of the cross-beam is less than one handbreadth in width, the law is that it gives passage to the uncleanness to the other side. And if there is uncleanness in one of the houses on one side of the alley-entry, it is forbidden for <italic>Kohanim</italic> to enter the houses on the other side &#x2014; <italic>Digest of Later Authorities.</italic></ftnote>

Thus <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer</italic> Y.D. &#x00A7; 340, 2), forms a partition against the uncleanness (Ber. 19b).

In this case his entry would not be considered a flagrant act, but if he entered the corpse&#x2019;s tent when it was already forbidden to do so, even if done unwittingly, it is regarded as a flagrant act &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh. Contra Isserles</italic>, the <italic>Kohen</italic> should put on the most essential garments in the case where the reason for leaving was specified to him &#x2014; <italic>D.Merb.</italic> V. <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> for additional reasons <italic>pro</italic> and <italic>con Isserles.</italic></ftnote>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 373: WHICH KOHEN<sup><xref rid="fn847">1</xref></sup> IS CAUTIONED AGAINST UNCLEANNESS; FOR WHICH DEAD DOES HE DEFILE HIMSELF; AND UNTIL WHEN DOES HE DEFILE HIMSELF. Contains nine paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. Even as the Kohen<sup><xref rid="fn847">1</xref></sup> is cautioned not to defile himself, so too, are the older [Kohanim]<sup><xref rid="fn848">2</xref></sup> cautioned concerning the minor ones.<sup><xref rid="fn849">3</xref></sup> <italic>And</italic> [<italic>the warning applies</italic>] <italic>only with respect to defiling them with one&#x2019;s own hands</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn850">4</xref></sup> <italic>but if the minors defile themselves, V. O.&#x1E24;. &#x00A7; 343, whether it is necessary to separate them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn851">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. Even [a <italic>Kohen</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn847">1</xref></sup> who has a blemish, is cautioned not to defile himself,<sup><xref rid="fn852">6</xref></sup> but one of profaned [Priestly stock]<sup><xref rid="fn853">7</xref></sup> and a daughter of a <italic>Kohen</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn854">8</xref></sup> are permitted to defile themselves.</p>
<p>3. All the dead [near-of-kin] mentioned in the Scriptural section<sup><xref rid="fn855">9</xref></sup> for whom a <italic>Kohen</italic><sup><xref rid="fn847">1</xref></sup> may defile himself, &#x2014; [the law is that] it is a religious duty that he defile himself for them; and if he does not wish to [do so], he is defiled against his will.<sup><xref rid="fn856">10</xref></sup> [This applies] both to the man and to the woman.<sup><xref rid="fn857">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. The following are the near-of-kin for whom [a <italic>Kohen</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn847">1</xref></sup> defiles himself, [viz.,]<sup><xref rid="fn858">12</xref></sup> his lawful married wife, but for his unlawful wife,<sup><xref rid="fn859">13</xref></sup> or his divorced wife,<sup><xref rid="fn860">14</xref></sup> or [his wife who was only] betrothed [to him],<sup><xref rid="fn861">15</xref></sup> he does not observe the laws of <italic>Onen</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn847">1</xref></sup> nor may he defile himself for her; and likewise, she [in the case of his death] does not observe the laws of <italic>Onen</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn847">1</xref></sup> nor may she defile herself for him.<sup><xref rid="fn862">16</xref></sup> He defiles himself for his mother, even if she became profaned,<sup><xref rid="fn863">17</xref></sup> and for his son and daughter, where it is certain that its [the infant&#x2019;s] months [of pregnancy] were complete, or that they are over thirty days old,<sup><xref rid="fn864">18</xref></sup> even if they are illegitimate, excluding his son and daughter of a slave or a heathen.<sup><xref rid="fn865">19</xref></sup> [He defiles himself] for his paternal brother and sister,<sup><xref rid="fn866">20</xref></sup> even if they are illegitimate, unless they are the offspring of a slave or a heathen.<sup><xref rid="fn865">19</xref></sup> But for his maternal brother or sister he does not defile himself.<sup><xref rid="fn867">21</xref></sup> <italic>And likewise he does not defile himself</italic> for his betrothed sister, even if she were betrothed to a <italic>Kohen</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn868">22</xref></sup> nor for [a sister] who was outraged or seduced,<sup><xref rid="fn869">23</xref></sup> but he defiles himself for his betrothed sister who was divorced<sup><xref rid="fn870">24</xref></sup> and [for] one who is adolescent<sup><xref rid="fn869">23</xref></sup> and [for] one who was wounded.<sup><xref rid="fn871">25</xref></sup> He [likewise] defiles himself for a woman awaiting the [decision] of the levir,<sup><xref rid="fn872">26</xref></sup> even if [her deceased husband] wrote in her <italic>Kethubah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn847">1</xref></sup> &#x2018;if you die childless, your <italic>Kethubah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn847">1</xref></sup> will return to the paternal house&#x2019;,<sup><xref rid="fn873">27</xref></sup> <italic>i.e., her father&#x2019;s house.</italic></p>
<p>5. All those [near-of-kin] for whom he<sup><xref rid="fn874">28</xref></sup> defiles himself [applies] even [to a defilement] which is not for the requirements [of the corpse].<sup><xref rid="fn875">29</xref></sup> And some say, only for the requirements [of the corpse].<sup><xref rid="fn876">30</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>And according to the former opinion, even if he</italic><sup><xref rid="fn874">28</xref></sup> <italic>suffered a bereavement on the Sabbath where it is impossible to bury him the same day</italic> [<italic>on account of the Sabbath</italic>], <italic>he</italic><sup><xref rid="fn874">28</xref></sup> <italic>is permitted to defile himself for him and guard him so that he should not lie in disgrace.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn877">31</xref></sup> <italic>It is proper to adopt the stringent view according to the latter opinion</italic> [<italic>viz.</italic>,] <italic>that he</italic><sup><xref rid="fn874">28</xref></sup> <italic>should defile himself only for the requirements of the burial</italic><sup><xref rid="fn878">32</xref></sup> <italic>and</italic> [<italic>in order</italic>] <italic>to bring him a coffin and shrouds.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn879">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. He<sup><xref rid="fn874">28</xref></sup> defiles himself for them<sup><xref rid="fn880">34</xref></sup> only until the closing of the <italic>Golel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn881">35</xref></sup> <italic>And if his intention is to clear him away</italic> [<italic>therefrom</italic>], <italic>he is permitted to defile himself for him for the sake of</italic> [<italic>his</italic>] <italic>needs until the closing of the second Golel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn882">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. It is forbidden for a <italic>Kohen</italic><sup><xref rid="fn847">1</xref></sup> to defile himself for [another] corpse even while he defiles himself for his near-of-kin. Therefore, a <italic>Kohen</italic><sup><xref rid="fn847">1</xref></sup> who suffered a bereavement must be careful and bury him [the corpse] at the end of the cemetery, so that he should not [have] to enter the cemetery and will not [thereby] defile himself through other graves when he buries his dead.<sup><xref rid="fn883">37</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>And</italic> [<italic>this applies</italic>] <italic>only after he departs from his dead, but while he attends to his dead, he is permitted to defile himself even for other</italic> [<italic>corpses</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn884">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. A <italic>Kohen</italic><sup><xref rid="fn847">1</xref></sup> whose parents dissociated themselves from the practices of the community, e.g., informers, &#x2014; does not defile himself for them,<sup><xref rid="fn885">39</xref></sup> nor for those executed by a Jewish Court, nor for one who commits suicide wilfully,<sup><xref rid="fn886">40</xref></sup> nor for one of uncertain [parentage], e.g., if her child became mixed up with her friend&#x2019;s child,<sup><xref rid="fn887">41</xref></sup> or it is not known [whether] it is a nine months&#x2019; child by the former [husband] or a sevenmonths&#x2019; child by the latter [husband].<sup><xref rid="fn888">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. The <italic>Kohen</italic><sup><xref rid="fn847">1</xref></sup> does not defile himself for a limb [severed] from his father while [the latter] was still alive, nor for a bone of his father&#x2019;s bones.<sup><xref rid="fn889">43</xref></sup> And so too, he who collects bones,<sup><xref rid="fn890">44</xref></sup> &#x2014; [the law is that] he<sup><xref rid="fn874">28</xref></sup> does not defile himself for them, although the spinal column is intact.<sup><xref rid="fn891">45</xref></sup> [If] a small part is missing,<sup><xref rid="fn892">46</xref></sup> even if it lies beside him [the corpse], he does not defile himself for him, for he defiles himself only when he is whole.<sup><xref rid="fn893">47</xref></sup> And there is one [authority] who says that this applies only if he [the corpse becomes] defective after death,<sup><xref rid="fn894">48</xref></sup> but if there is a limb missing from him during his lifetime, and [then] he died, &#x2014; he<sup><xref rid="fn874">28</xref></sup> defiles himself for him [the corpse], although he is not whole.<sup><xref rid="fn895">49</xref></sup> <italic>And some say that he</italic><sup><xref rid="fn874">28</xref></sup> <italic>does not defile himself for a slain person, for he</italic> [<italic>the slain person</italic>] <italic>is designated defective</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn896">50</xref></sup> <italic>And it is proper to adopt the stringent view</italic>.</p>
<ftnote id="fn847">1) V. Glos.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn848">2) Or Israelites &#x2014; <italic>Perisha, A.H.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn849">3) Yeb. 114a, for it is written: <italic>&#x2018;Speak &#x2026; and say&#x2019;</italic> (Lev. XXI, 1), where the verb <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05DE;&#x05E8;</span> &#x2018;to say or speak&#x2019; is repeated, whence the Rabbis derive that adults must not defile minors with their own hands. A minor <italic>Kohen</italic> who is asleep in the same tent wherein a corpse is present, need not be awakened and removed therefrom. However, in order to train the child in religious practices, it is advisable to awaken him (<italic>Agudah</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>Ta</italic>Z, <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn850">4) Gemara <italic>ibid.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn851">5) <italic>RaShBA</italic> s. 128 and <italic>MaHaRIW; Tur</italic>, however, on the authority of <italic>Maim.</italic> (Yad, <italic>Ebel</italic> III, 12), writes that it is not necessary (to separate them) &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> &#x2018;To separate them,&#x2019; means to take the uncleanness away from them. This refers to the <italic>Beth Din</italic>, but the minor&#x2019;s father should separate him once he has reached the age for minors to be trained in religious practices (v. Yad <italic>ibid.</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn852">6) Sifra <italic>Emor</italic> beg. V. also <italic>Rashi</italic> on Torah <italic>ibid.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn853">7) Heb. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D7;&#x05DC;&#x05DC;</span> i.e., one unfit for Priesthood on account of his father&#x2019;s illegitimate marriage (Lev. XXI, 7; 14). Sifra <italic>ibid.;</italic> Yeb. 100b; San. 5b. The ruling here applies only to one who is regarded of profaned Priestly stock Biblically, e.g., one who was the issue of the illegitimate connection of a <italic>Kohen</italic> and a divorcee (v. Lev. <italic>ibid.</italic>), but if he is regarded so only Rabbinically, e.g., one who was the issue of a woman released from leviratical marriage by <italic>&#x1E24;ali&#x1E93;ah</italic> (v. Glos.), he is forbidden to defile himself. Wherever it is doubtful if he is the issue of a divorcee etc., we adopt the stringent view and he is disqualified from the Priesthood (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DD;&#x05E4;&#x05D9;&#x05E7;&#x05D0; &#x05D3;&#x05D0;&#x05D5;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05EA;&#x05D0; &#x05DC;&#x05D7;&#x05D5;&#x05DE;&#x05E8;&#x05D0;</span>), but in a doubtful case which is only Rabbinical, he is considered a <italic>Kohen</italic> in all respects (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DD;&#x05E4;&#x05D9;&#x05E7;&#x05D0; &#x05D3;&#x05E8;&#x05D1;&#x05E0;&#x05DF; &#x05DC;&#x05E7;&#x05D5;&#x05DC;&#x05D0;</span>).

<ftnote id="fn863">17) Sifra <italic>ibid.</italic> This refers to a case where after this <italic>Kohen</italic> was born, his mother was unlawfully married to another <italic>Kohen</italic> after having been divorced from her previous marriage &#x2014; <italic>ShaK. Tur</italic> includes his father for whom the <italic>Kohen</italic> defiles himself.

<ftnote id="fn864">18) Even if the months of pregnancy were not complete. V. Shab. 136a and Sifra <italic>ibid.</italic> For a doubtful non-viable birth he does not defile himself both in the case of a son, a daughter, a brother and a sister &#x2014; <italic>Shak.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn872">26) Where the widow of a husband who has died childless (v. Deut. V, 5-9) waits for the brother-in-law to marry or to reject her.

<ftnote id="fn875">29) Sem(H). IV, 7 (according to the reading of <italic>N</italic> in <italic>T.H.</italic> cited by <italic>B.Yos.</italic>) where three opinions are mentioned with respect to how long he is permitted to defile himself for his near-of-kin: &#x2018;How long is he permitted to defile himself for them? &#x2014; R. Meir says, the entire day. R. Simeon says, three days. R. Judah says on the authority of R. Tarfon, until the closing of the tomb by the <italic>Golel.&#x2019;</italic> From an actual case reported <italic>ibid.</italic>, the third view was accepted by the Rabbis (v. <italic>infra</italic> par. 6 and notes). Hence, we infer from this that he may defile himself for his near-of-kin even in the case where the defilement is not required for the corpse&#x2019;s needs, e.g., preparation of shrouds etc. Accordingly, this defilement is considered obligatory &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn876">30) E.g., all burial requirements, such as a coffin, shrouds etc. But if these are not required, the <italic>Kohen</italic> may not defile himself for them &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> V.

<ftnote id="fn878">32) On a weekday the <italic>Kohen</italic> may be present in the house where his dead near-of-kin lies awaiting burial, even if there are others who attend to the burial needs, since there may be something with respect to the burial needs concerning which his presence is required. Hence, this is regarded as a defilement for the needs of the corpse &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.

<ftnote id="fn881">35) Sem. <italic>ibid.</italic> Regarding the meaning of the term <italic>Golel</italic> there is a difference of opinion between <italic>Rashi</italic> and <italic>R. Tam</italic> (v. Ket. 4b; <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 369, n. 5). According to the former, it refers to the cover or lid of the coffin ; according to the latter, to the stone placed upon the grave (this should not be confused with the tombstone). From <italic>Rashi</italic>&#x2019;s interpretation it might appear that once the coffin is covered in the house, the <italic>Kohen</italic> should not be permitted to defile himself for the corpse (since this would be regarded as the closing of the <italic>Golel</italic>), but in reality, <italic>Rashi</italic> too, it may be shown from Shab. 152a refers to the closing of the <italic>Golel</italic> when the coffin is placed in the grave. Hence, it follows that even in accordance with <italic>Rashi</italic>&#x2019;s interpretation of <italic>Golel</italic>, the <italic>Kohen</italic> may defile himself for his near-of-kin while the coffin stands covered in the house &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 374: DEFILEMENT OF A KOHEN<sup><xref rid="fn897">1</xref></sup> FOR A CORPSE [WHOSE BURIAL IS] A RELIGIOUS DUTY;<sup><xref rid="fn898">2</xref></sup> FOR A NASI;<sup><xref rid="fn897">1</xref></sup> FOR ONE&#x2019;S TEACHER; AND FOR WHICH DEAD ONE OBSERVES MOURNING RITES. Contains eleven paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. It is a religious obligation to defile oneself for a corpse [whose burial is] a religious duty,<sup><xref rid="fn898">2</xref></sup> even if one is a High priest or<sup><xref rid="fn899">3</xref></sup> a Nazirite and he was going to slaughter his Paschal lamb or<sup><xref rid="fn899">3</xref></sup> to circumcise his son and [on the way] he found a corpse [whose burial is] a religious duty, &#x2014; [the law is that] he defiles himself for him.<sup><xref rid="fn900">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. He is designated a corpse [whose burial is] a religious duty with respect to this matter [of defilement], only if he found his head and the larger portion [of his body].<sup><xref rid="fn901">5</xref></sup> If, however, he found his head and the larger portion [of his body] save one limb, he may [later] return to defile himself for that limb [when he finds it].<sup><xref rid="fn902">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. Who is regarded as a corpse [whose burial] is a religious duty? &#x2014; One whom he<sup><xref rid="fn903">7</xref></sup> found on the road or in a town of heathens, and there is no one [available] to bury him, and from the spot where he<sup><xref rid="fn903">7</xref></sup> found him he could not call upon an Israelite to answer him<sup><xref rid="fn903">7</xref></sup> and come to attend to him<sup><xref rid="fn904">8</xref></sup> and bury him, &#x2014; [the law is that] he<sup><xref rid="fn903">7</xref></sup> is forbidden to depart therefrom and leave the corpse, even to go to the town [in order] to fetch [people] to attend to the burial rites, but he<sup><xref rid="fn903">7</xref></sup> should defile himself [for him] and bury him. But if there were Israelites [available] in proximity of the spot of the corpse, [so] that if the one who finds him<sup><xref rid="fn904">8</xref></sup> would call upon them, they would answer him,<sup><xref rid="fn903">7</xref></sup> and come to bury him, &#x2014; such a one is not regarded as a corpse [whose burial] is a religious duty for whom the <italic>Kohen</italic><sup><xref rid="fn897">1</xref></sup> should defile himself, but he<sup><xref rid="fn903">7</xref></sup> calls upon them and they bury [him].<sup><xref rid="fn905">9</xref></sup> [If] the townspeople came, [then the law is that] if his<sup><xref rid="fn904">8</xref></sup> needs are adequately attended to,<sup><xref rid="fn906">10</xref></sup> he<sup><xref rid="fn903">7</xref></sup> withdraws himself.<sup><xref rid="fn907">11</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>Some say that if he is able to secure people to bury him only</italic> [<italic>if he hires them</italic>] <italic>for money, he is not bound to hire</italic> [<italic>them</italic>] <italic>with his own</italic> [<italic>money</italic>], <italic>but he may defile himself</italic> [<italic>for the corpse</italic>], <italic>if he so desires.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn908">12</xref></sup> [<italic>In the case of</italic>] <italic>a corpse that is found and we do not know whether he is a Gentile or an Israelite</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn909">13</xref></sup> <italic>we decide</italic><sup><xref rid="fn910">14</xref></sup> <italic>according to the majority of those present there</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn911">15</xref></sup> <italic>unless</italic><sup><xref rid="fn912">16</xref></sup> <italic>we can apply</italic><sup><xref rid="fn913">17</xref></sup> [<italic>the principle</italic>] <italic>that everything which is stationary is regarded as half to half</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn914">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. For all the near-of-kin for whom the <italic>Kohen</italic><sup><xref rid="fn897">1</xref></sup> defiles himself, viz., his father, mother, son, daughter, [paternal] brother, paternal virgin sister and wife, &#x2014; one is dutibound to observe mourning rites.<sup><xref rid="fn915">19</xref></sup> To these they added one&#x2019;s maternal brother and one&#x2019;s maternal sister whether a virgin or married, and one&#x2019;s paternal married sister, &#x2014; for whom one is dutibound to observe mourning rites, although a <italic>Kohen</italic><sup><xref rid="fn897">1</xref></sup> does not defile himself for them.<sup><xref rid="fn916">20</xref></sup> And even as he observes mourning rites for his wife, so too, does she observe mourning rites for him.<sup><xref rid="fn917">21</xref></sup> [This applies] only to one&#x2019;s lawful married wife, but for one&#x2019;s unlawful or betrothed [wife] one does not [observe mourning rites].<sup><xref rid="fn918">22</xref></sup> For one&#x2019;s son, daughter, brother or sister, even if they are illegitimate, he observes mourning, save [in the case of] his son, daughter, brother or sister who are [the issue] of a slave or a heathen, for whom one does not observe mourning rites.<sup><xref rid="fn919">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. A stranger who became a proselyte along with<sup><xref rid="fn920">24</xref></sup> his sons, or a slave who was emancipated<sup><xref rid="fn921">25</xref></sup> along with<sup><xref rid="fn920">24</xref></sup> his mother, do not observe mourning rites for one another.<sup><xref rid="fn922">26</xref></sup> <italic>Likewise</italic>, [<italic>if</italic>] <italic>a stranger became a proselyte along</italic><sup><xref rid="fn920">24</xref></sup> <italic>with his mother, he does not observe mourning rites for them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn923">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. Whomever he mourns for he [also] mourns with<sup><xref rid="fn924">28</xref></sup> if he suffers a breavement.<sup><xref rid="fn925">29</xref></sup> [This applies] only whilst he is in his presence,<sup><xref rid="fn926">30</xref></sup> but when not in his presence, he is not bound to observe mourning rites save [in the case of] his wife, although he mourns for her, &#x2014; [the law is that] he mourns with her only for her father or her mother [in the case of their death] out of respect to his father-in-law and his mother-in-law; but for her brother and her sister or her son and her daughter [who are the issue] of another man, he does not mourn with her.<sup><xref rid="fn927">31</xref></sup> Nevertheless, he may not compel his [mourning] wife to adorn herself, but she may mix his wine for him and make his bed and wash his face, hands and feet.<sup><xref rid="fn928">32</xref></sup> So too, she mourns with him only when her father-in-law or her mother-in-law died, but [for] all his other near-of-kin who died, she does not mourn with him.<sup><xref rid="fn929">33</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>Some say that nowadays we adopt a lenient view regarding this</italic> [<italic>type</italic>] <italic>of mourning with respect to those who mourn with him, for this is only out of respect to those who observe mourning rites, but now it is the common practice to forego</italic> [<italic>this honour</italic>], <italic>and thus is the accepted practice nowadays</italic>, [<italic>viz.</italic>,] <italic>not to mourn at all with those who observe mourning rites</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn930">34</xref></sup> <italic>He who adopts a stringent view in this</italic> [<italic>matter</italic>] <italic>is one of those who make people wonder</italic> [<italic>at their strange conduct</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn931">35</xref></sup> <italic>Nevertheless, it is the accepted practice that all the near-of-kin of the dead person who are disqualified to offer testimony in his</italic><sup><xref rid="fn932">36</xref></sup> <italic>behalf</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn933">37</xref></sup> <italic>exhibit some</italic> [<italic>signs</italic>] <italic>of mourning</italic> [<italic>by placing</italic>] <italic>themselves</italic> [<italic>under this stringency</italic>] <italic>the first entire week, i.e., until after the first Sabbath</italic> [<italic>in</italic>] <italic>that they do not wash</italic> [<italic>themselves</italic>] <italic>nor change some of their clothes</italic><sup><xref rid="fn934">38</xref></sup> <italic>as on other Sabbaths.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn935">39</xref></sup> <italic>There are, however, localities where the accepted usage is to adopt additional stringencies in other matters</italic> [<italic>pertaining to this type of mourning</italic>], <italic>but</italic><sup><xref rid="fn936">40</xref></sup> <italic>the fundamental principle is as I have written</italic> [<italic>above</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn937">41</xref></sup> <italic>All this</italic> [<italic>pertains</italic>] <italic>to near tidings</italic><sup><xref rid="fn938">42</xref></sup> <italic>or to one who was present at the</italic> [<italic>time of</italic>] <italic>death, but in</italic> [<italic>the case of</italic>] <italic>distant tidings</italic><sup><xref rid="fn939">43</xref></sup> <italic>this type of mourning is entirely out of place.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn940">44</xref></sup> <italic>One who desires to place himself under a stringency</italic>, [<italic>viz</italic>.,] <italic>to observe mourning rites for one for whom he is not dutibound</italic> [<italic>to mourn</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn941">45</xref></sup> <italic>or to put on dark clothes</italic> [<italic>in mourning</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn942">46</xref></sup> <italic>for his near-of-kin, is not reproved</italic> [<italic>for doing so</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn943">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. One mourns with [his] near-of-kin who mourn for them<sup><xref rid="fn944">48</xref></sup> only when they mourn for a [blood] and flesh relationship, e.g., [in the case of] one&#x2019;s son and brother who mourn for a son and daughter of theirs; but for a relationship [only] through [their] marriage, e.g., if the wife of one&#x2019;s son died or the wife of one&#x2019;s brother or the husband of one&#x2019;s daughter or the husband of one&#x2019;s sister, &#x2014; one does not observe mourning rites.<sup><xref rid="fn945">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. For an infant throughout the entire thirty days [after birth]<sup><xref rid="fn946">50</xref></sup> including the thirtieth day<sup><xref rid="fn947">51</xref></sup> [who died], one does not observe mourning rites, even if its hair and nails were fully developed;<sup><xref rid="fn948">52</xref></sup> and thenceforth one mourns for it unless it was known that it was [born after] eight months [of pregnancy].<sup><xref rid="fn949">53</xref></sup> But if one knows for certain that its months [of pregnancy] were complete,<sup><xref rid="fn950">54</xref></sup> e.g., [in the case] where [the husband] performed sexual intercourse and then separated himself [from her],<sup><xref rid="fn951">55</xref></sup> and [the infant] was born alive after nine complete months [of pregnancy],<sup><xref rid="fn952">56</xref></sup> even if it died on the day it was born, one observes mourning rites for it. <italic>If it is not known whether it</italic> [<italic>was born after</italic>] <italic>nine months</italic> [<italic>of pregnancy</italic>] <italic>by the former</italic> [<italic>husband</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn953">57</xref></sup> <italic>or seven months</italic> [<italic>of pregnancy</italic>] <italic>by the latter</italic> [<italic>husband</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn954">58</xref></sup> <italic>both</italic> [<italic>husbands</italic>] <italic>observe mourning rites</italic><sup><xref rid="fn955">59</xref></sup> <italic>for it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn956">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. There is an authority who says that twins of whom one died within thirty days [after birth] and the other [continued to] live after thirty days, one does not observe mourning rites for [the one who died].<sup><xref rid="fn957">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. For his teacher who taught him wisdom, he observes the laws of <italic>Aninuth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn958">62</xref></sup> only that he may recite the benediction [before] and say grace [after meals],<sup><xref rid="fn959">63</xref></sup> and he mourns for him by removing his sandals [or shoes], and [he observes] all the laws of mourning for one day [only].<sup><xref rid="fn960">64</xref></sup> <italic>Caro writes on the authority of R. Sim&#x1e25;a that he is required to change his</italic> [<italic>customary</italic>] <italic>place in the Synagogue</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn961">65</xref></sup> <italic>However</italic>, [<italic>if one does this only</italic>] <italic>during part of the day</italic> [<italic>it</italic>] <italic>suffices</italic>.</p>
<p>11. [With respect to] a <italic>Nasi</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn962">66</xref></sup> despite the fact that all people may defile themselves for him, &#x2014; [the law is that] one does not mourn for him.<sup><xref rid="fn963">67</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>Some say that one does not mourn for his first son</italic><sup><xref rid="fn964">68</xref></sup> <italic>or</italic> [<italic>even</italic>] <italic>his firstborn son, who died</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn965">69</xref></sup> <italic>However, this custom is erroneous, but one is dutibound to mourn for them. Nevertheless, the custom has spread in our city that a father and mother do not follow</italic> [<italic>the funeral procession of</italic>] <italic>their first son</italic> [<italic>on its way</italic>] <italic>to the cemetery. Some say that during the time a plague</italic> [<italic>rages</italic>] <italic>one does not observe mourning rites out of fear</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn966">70</xref></sup> <italic>and I have heard that some have adopted this practice</italic>.</p>

<ftnote id="fn917">21) The reason being that since a mourner observes mourning rites for all near-of-kin for whom a <italic>Kohen</italic> defiles himself, it follows that just as a woman defiles herself for her husband, she also observes mourning rites for him &#x2014; <italic>B.Yos.</italic> Cf.

<ftnote id="fn919">23) Mishna Yeb. II, 5 (22a). If one quarreled with his wife and decided to divorce her, and then immediately following the dispute, she died, the husband is not dutibound to mourn for her &#x2014; <italic>R. A.

Hence, if the husband is a <italic>Kohen</italic>, he defiles himself and observes mourning rites for her. If she was divorced on a condition and subsequently the husband died, she is not dutibound to observe mourning rites for him. However, if she desires to adopt a stringency, she is permitted to weep over him and to follow his bier &#x2014; <italic>E.H.</italic> &#x00A7; 145, 9, Gloss.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn921">25) This refers to a Canaanite slave who was sold to a Jew and enjoyed a semi-Jewish status. He had to observe all religious duties that were binding on women. He was permitted to marry only a woman slave but not a Jewess. If he was set free by his owner, who then gave him a writ of emancipation to that effect, he then became entirely Jewish.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn922">26) Derived from Mishna Yeb. XI, 2 (97b). V. also Gemara <italic>ibid.</italic>, &#x2018;He who has become a proselyte is like a child newly born.&#x2019; Hence, all his previous family relationships cease to exist and mourning does not apply.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn925">29) E.g., if his father&#x2019;s father dies, he mourns with his father. Similarly, if his son&#x2019;s son dies.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn926">30) Since the reason for this type of mourning is out of respect to the mourning relative, it must therefore be observed only in the latter&#x2019;s presence.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn946">50) Shab. 135b in accord with R. Simeon b.

This shows that since he is redeemed only after the thirty days are completely over, it follows that only then is the infant regarded as a viable birth, but not before.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn947">51) Bek. 29a in accord with R. Ashi. An infant who died on the thirty-first day after birth prior to the twenty-four hours from the hour of birth, is mourned for &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn948">52) The case in question is where we are not certain whether the months of pregnancy were complete, although the infant&#x2019;s hair and nails were fully developed <italic>contra Hag.

<ftnote id="fn949">53) In which case one does not mourn for it, for it is doubtful whether the infant will live. Cf. Yad, <italic>Ebel</italic> I, 7-8; <italic>ibid.

<ftnote id="fn951">55) <italic>Hag. Maim., Ebel</italic> I, 7 on the authority of <italic>Rashi.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn952">56) Even if some of the months of the nine months&#x2019; period consist of twenty-nine days, we mourn for the infant &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn953">57) From whom she was divorced and did not wait the required three months before her remarriage. Three months were required in order to determine whether she was with child from her first husband.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn954">58) Yeb. 36b, Tosaf. s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05D0;</span> end. This ruling is applicable only if during the first three months after her marriage to the second husband she was in our presence, but we did not notice whether she was with child or not. Hence, we cannot apply the principle of following the majority of births which take place after nine months of pregnancy. Consequently, the majority is impaired and therefore both the first and the second husband are required to mourn for the child. But in a case where she was in our presence only after the three months&#x2019; period of her remarriage elapsed, we presume that she became pregnant by the first husband who alone is then required to mourn for the infant, since this birth belongs to the majority of births that take place after nine months of pregnancy. However, in the case of inheritance, we say that this child does not inherit the first husband after the latter&#x2019;s death, for &#x2018;in monetary matters we do not follow the status of the majority&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05DF; &#x05D4;&#x05D5;&#x05DC;&#x05DB;&#x05D9;&#x05DF; &#x05D1;&#x05DE;&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05DF; &#x05D0;&#x05D7;&#x05E8; &#x05D4;&#x05E8;&#x05D5;&#x05D1;</span>) &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn955">59) Although mourning is only Rabbinical, nevertheless in a doubtful case such as this, we adopt a stringent view, for it would be disrespectful not to mourn for the infant at all &#x2014; <italic>Ta</italic>Z. But if the question of disrespect does not enter, e.g., where one of the husbands died, in which case, it would be said that he was the real father, we adopt a lenient view and the other husband observes no mourning rites for the infant, for mourning is only Rabbinical &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> In the event that both fathers died, the son must mourn for both &#x2014; <italic>Ibid.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn957">61) Thus according to the corrected version of <italic>Ta</italic>Z and <italic>ShaK</italic> who show that the source of this ruling (<italic>O.</italic>Z.) substantiates their emendation of <italic>Caro</italic>&#x2019;s text.

This explanation is rejected by <italic>Ta</italic>Z and <italic>ShaK</italic> according to whom, if the second one dies after thirty days we are dutibound to mourn for him alone and we do not say that since the second one is a viable birth then the first should also be considered viable.

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 375: WHEN DOES THE MOURNING PERIOD COMMENCE? AND [THE LAW WITH RESPECT TO MOURNING] FOR ONE WHO IS REMOVED FROM ONE GRAVE TO ANOTHER. Contains eleven paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. From what time does the mourning [-period] take effect? &#x2014; As soon as [the corpse] has been buried and the closing of the grave with earth has been completed, the mourning [-period] commences forthwith.<sup><xref rid="fn967">1</xref></sup> He [the mourner] wraps his head [in mourning]<sup><xref rid="fn968">2</xref></sup> but does not remove his shoes until he reaches his house.<sup><xref rid="fn969">3</xref></sup> Now it is customary to remove one&#x2019;s shoes [in mourning] immediately after the closing of [the grave] by the <italic>Golel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn970">4</xref></sup> as stated in &#x00A7; 376. <italic>Gloss</italic>:<sup><xref rid="fn971">5</xref></sup> <italic>If one thought that the grave had been closed and commenced to observe mourning rites and later it became known to him that he was mistaken, he begins the observance of mourning rites anew.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn972">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. Those who are wont to send the corpse to another large town for burial and they know not when he [the corpse] will be buried, &#x2014; [the law is that] as soon as they [the mourners] turn their faces [to come back] from escorting [the corpse], they begin to count the seven and thirty [days of mourning] and commence [forthwith] the observance of mourning rites,<sup><xref rid="fn973">7</xref></sup> and those who accompany<sup><xref rid="fn974">8</xref></sup> him [the corpse], count [the days of mourning] from [the time] that he is buried. However, if the chief of the family accompanies him [the corpse &#x2014; the law is that] even those who remain here, count only from [the time] he is buried.<sup><xref rid="fn975">9</xref></sup> The chief of the family<sup><xref rid="fn976">10</xref></sup> means the one upon whom [the people of] the household depend and who are guided by him, irrespective whether he is a brother or a young son.<sup><xref rid="fn977">11</xref></sup> However, there is one authority who says that he must be [at least] thirteen years old.<sup><xref rid="fn978">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. If they remove the corpse from one grave to another grave, &#x2014; [the law is that] if they buried him in the first grave with the intention that he remain buried therein forever, only that subsequently they decided to remove him therefrom, they count [the days of mourning] only from the [time] that he was buried in the first grave, even if they removed him within the seven [days of mourning]. But if at the outset they buried him with the intention to remove him [therefrom] whenever the matter will come to hand, they commence the mourning [-period] forthwith; if, however, [in this case] they removed him within the seven [days of mourning], they [begin to] count again [the seven days of mourning] from [the moment] that he is buried a second time. If they did not remove him until after the seven [days of mourning, then] their mourning [-period] has passed, and they do not observe mourning for him a second time;<sup><xref rid="fn979">13</xref></sup> and if at the outset their intention was to remove him therefrom within the seven [days of mourning], they do not begin to count until he is buried in the second grave.<sup><xref rid="fn980">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. If they placed the corpse in a coffin and put it<sup><xref rid="fn981">15</xref></sup> into another house because the city was under siege, they [should begin to] count for him forthwith the seven and the thirty [days of mourning], although their intention is to bury him in the cemetery after the siege [is over] and the closing of the coffin [in this case] is regarded as burial<sup><xref rid="fn982">16</xref></sup> and mourning rites become effective upon them forthwith.</p>
<p>5. Those executed by the government<sup><xref rid="fn983">17</xref></sup> who are not permitted [by the ruler] to be buried, &#x2014; when does one begin to observe mourning rites for them and to count the seven and thirty [days of mourning]? &#x2014; From [the moment] that they have given up hope to [continue] to request the ruler&#x2019;s [permission] to bury them,<sup><xref rid="fn984">18</xref></sup> although they have not given up hope of carrying them off stealthily.<sup><xref rid="fn985">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. One who was informed that heathens have impaled his near-of-kin in another town and [as a result of which] commenced the observance of mourning rites forthwith, but subsequently it became known to him that he<sup><xref rid="fn986">20</xref></sup> is still awaiting impalement, &#x2014; [the law is that] the mourning rites [already observed] do not count for him [as valid] and he must count again from [the time] that [the corpse] is buried or from [the time] they have given up hope of burying him.<sup><xref rid="fn987">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. For one who drowned in waters<sup><xref rid="fn988">22</xref></sup> that have an end,<sup><xref rid="fn989">23</xref></sup> or for one regarding whom a rumour circulated that robbers have murdered him, or for one whom a beast dragged away,&#x2014; from what time does one count [the days of mourning]? &#x2014; From [the time] they have given up the search [for him].<sup><xref rid="fn990">24</xref></sup> [If] they found him in limbs and they recognize him through his body marks, one does not count [the days of mourning] for him until he finds his head and the larger portion of his [body], or if they have given up their search [for him].<sup><xref rid="fn991">25</xref></sup> If he was found after they had given up hope of [recovering] him, the near-of-kin are not required to observe mourning rites again,<sup><xref rid="fn992">26</xref></sup> but the children [of the dead person], if they were present there at the time he was found, observe mourning rites for him on that day [only],<sup><xref rid="fn993">27</xref></sup> for this is not less important than [the case of] a collection [that is made] of his father&#x2019;s bones.<sup><xref rid="fn994">28</xref></sup> However, if they [the children] are not present there, and they heard [about it] after the day was over, they are not required to observe mourning rites. <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>If they sent their dead to another city</italic> [<italic>for burial, regarding which</italic>] <italic>the law is that they should begin</italic> [<italic>to observe</italic>] <italic>mourning rites from</italic> [<italic>the time</italic>] <italic>that they turn their faces</italic> [<italic>to return from the funeral escort</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn995">29</xref></sup> <italic>and they commenced to count the days of mourning, but subsequently the corpse was seized, and it was not released for burial for a long time, &#x2014;</italic> [<italic>the law is that</italic>] <italic>they are not required to interrupt their observance of mourning rites, nor are they required subsequently</italic><sup><xref rid="fn996">30</xref></sup> <italic>to observe mourning rites again, for since the law</italic> [<italic>permits</italic>] <italic>them to begin</italic> [<italic>the observance of mourning rites</italic>] <italic>forthwith, they are not required to interrupt</italic> [<italic>the mourning</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn997">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. One whose near-of-kin died<sup><xref rid="fn998">32</xref></sup> and he did not know [about it] until he arrived at the place where the person died or at the place of burial,<sup><xref rid="fn999">33</xref></sup> &#x2014; [the law is that] if he was [at the time the death occurred] in a near place, viz., a distance of ten parasangs [away],<sup><xref rid="fn1000">34</xref></sup> so that it was possible for him to arrive in one day,<sup><xref rid="fn1001">35</xref></sup> even if he arrived on the seventh day,<sup><xref rid="fn1002">36</xref></sup>&#x2014;[the law is that] if [upon arrival] he found comforters in the presence of<sup><xref rid="fn1003">37</xref></sup> the chief of the household, even if they were [already] preparing [themselves] to get up<sup><xref rid="fn1004">38</xref></sup> [and leave, nevertheless], since he found comforters, <italic>i.e., they were still observing mourning rites</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1005">39</xref></sup> he is credited [with the mourning already observed],<sup><xref rid="fn1006">40</xref></sup> and he counts with them the completion of the thirty day [mourning period]. But if he did not find comforters [upon his arrival], he counts on his own. So too, if he was in a distant place, even if he arrived on the second day, he counts on his own the seven and thirty [days of mourning] from the day he arrives. <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>And some say that even if one arrived and the chief</italic> [<italic>of the household</italic>] <italic>is not home, but had left</italic> [<italic>to attend</italic>] <italic>to the needs of the corpse,&#x2014;</italic> [<italic>the law is that</italic>] <italic>if he returned within three days, he is regarded as if he were at home, and the one who arrives within the three days counts with them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1007">41</xref></sup> <italic>and the lenient view should be adopted in accord with this opinion. And one who in accordance with the law counts with them, &#x2014;</italic> [<italic>the law is that</italic>] <italic>even if he later returned to his home, he</italic> [<italic>still continues to</italic>] <italic>count with them.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1008">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. This<sup><xref rid="fn1009">43</xref></sup> applies only [to a case] where he did not hear that he [his near-of-kin] had died until he arrived [at the place of death or burial], but if it became known to him [in his place] on the second day and he commenced to observe mourning rites, he should not shorten his [period of] mourning on grounds that he [now] has arrived in their midst.<sup><xref rid="fn1010">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. One who was in mourning and within the seven [days] suffered another bereavement, counts seven days of mourning from [the time] of the latter bereavement, and [the days thus observed] are accounted for him also as the completion of the seven days of mourning after the first bereavement.<sup><xref rid="fn1011">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. One who recited the evening <italic>Tefillah</italic> and it is still day,<sup><xref rid="fn1012">46</xref></sup> and [then heard that he had suffered a bereavement, there is an authoriity who says that he counts [the days of mourning] from the following day and that day [the previous day] does not enter [into the counting].<sup><xref rid="fn1013">47</xref></sup></p>

Hence, only on the cemetery grounds the mourner should remove his shoes, but when he returns to his home he should put them on, since it is disgraceful to walk barefooted outside &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> It is, however, quite possible that the reference &#x00A7; 372 is a misprint and should be &#x00A7; 373 in which par. 6 deals with the defilement of a <italic>Kohen</italic> for his near-of-kin which is permitted until the closing of the tomb by the <italic>Golel.</italic> According to <italic>Tosefeth Shabbath</italic> it should read infra &#x00A7; 382 which see.</ftnote>

Here we deal with a case where one commenced the observance of mourning rites during the day and later he discovered that the burial had actually taken place at night. Consequently, the day cannot be counted as one of the seven days of mourning &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> Regarding the recital of <italic>Kaddish</italic>, v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 376 difference of opinion between <italic>Ta</italic>Z and <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn973">7) Yad, <italic>Ebel</italic> I, 5 &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Derived from M.K. 22a in accord with Raba. This ruling applies only where they sent the corpse for burial in another city, but if the burial takes place on the outskirts of the same city, the law is that those who return from the city gates, commence their mourning rites only after they are informed that the corpse had already been buried. Thus <italic>N</italic> in <italic>T.H.</italic> and <italic>B.Yos.</italic> &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> However, if after returning from the city gates where the corpse was buried on the outskirts of the city, they removed their shoes and commenced the observance of mourning rites, and later, after nightfall, those who accompanied the corpse to the graveyard, returned and reported that the corpse was interred when it was still day, the law is that although the mourners commenced their mourning whilst being unaware of the time of burial, the day is regarded as part of the mourning period. This follows from <italic>Isserles</italic> ruling <italic>supra</italic> par. 1, where one is required to begin the observance of mourning anew, only when he discovered later that he was mistaken, from which it follows, that if subsequently, as in the present case, it was found that mourning rites began at the proper time, the mourning already observed counts as part of the required period &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn975">9) Y.M.K. III, 5(82c) cited by <italic>Tosaf.</italic> M.K. 22a s.v. (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D4;&#x05D3;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05EA;&#x05DF;</span>) and <italic>Asheri ibid.</italic>, although both had different readings in Y. There are three interpretations on this ruling, viz., a) <italic>Asheri</italic> followed by <italic>Tur:</italic> If the chief of the family remains here, then even all those who accompany the corpse to the burial place, count the period of mourning from the time that the corpse leaves. If, however, the family chief accompanies the corpse, then even those who remain at home count from the time that the corpse is interred. b) <italic>Tosaf.</italic> adopts a stringent view, viz., that if the family chief accompanies the corpse, everyone counts from the time of burial (similar to <italic>Asheri</italic>), but if he remains here, then those who remain with him commence the observance of mourning forthwith, and those who accompany the corpse are required to begin the observance of formal mourning from the time of burial. However, those who accompany the corpse should observe some mourning rites forthwith out of respect to the family chief, although the seven day period of formal mourning begins for them after burial. c) <italic>Caro:</italic> If the chief of the family accompanies the corpse, then even those who remain here count from the time of burial, from which it follows that if the family chief remains here, we revert to the first ruling recorded at the outset of this par. viz., that those who remain here begin to count the seven days of mourning forthwith, and those who accompany the corpse from the time of burial. Hence, <italic>Caro</italic>&#x2019;s interpretation is in accord neither with a) nor b). For according to b) even if the family chief remains here, those who accompany the corpse, it is true, commence the observance of formal mourning from burial, but they are also required to observe some mourning rites forthwith out of respect to the family chief, and according to a) if the family chief remains here, then all, &#x2014; even those who accompany the corpse, begin the counting of the seven days of mourning from the time the corpse leaves. <italic>Caro</italic>&#x2019;s interpretation may be the result of a) a different reading in Y. <italic>ibid.</italic>, or b) he follows <italic>Maim</italic>. in Yad <italic>ibid</italic>. and makes no distinction regarding the family chief and consequently does not take into consideration the stringency of <italic>Tosaf.</italic> &#x2014; <italic>ShaK. A.H. Caro</italic>&#x2019;s ruling, viz., that when the family chief accompanied the corpse, even those who remain here count from the time of burial, applies only if the family chief will reach the burial place within three days, otherwise they begin counting forthwith and the family chief from burial (v. M.K. 22a) &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> V. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 399, 14 where <italic>Caro</italic> rules that &#x2018;one who suffered a bereavement on the eve of a Festival day and he was afraid lest he have not sufficient time to bury the corpse prior to the advent of the Festival whilst it is still day and gave the corpse over to Gentiles to attend to the burial, the law is that as soon as they carry the corpse out of the city and he can no longer be seen by the near-of-kin, mourning takes effect upon him, and if it is one hour prior to the Festival and he observed mourning rites therein, the restrictions of the seven days become annulled although he was buried on the Festival proper.&#x2019; This means that even if the corpse was buried on the Festival, in which case mourning is usually postponed until after the Holiday period is over, yet, since the corpse was transferred to the Gentiles prior to the advent of the Festival, it is considered as if the burial had taken place before the Festival and the seven days of mourning become annulled. This presents a difficulty. For in the present ruling it is implied (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 7) that if the burial takes place on the outskirts of the city, the mourning period begins from the time of burial. How is it possible for <italic>Caro</italic> (<italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 399) to rule that the entire period of mourning becomes annulled even if the burial attended to by the Gentiles took place after the advent of the Festival? This apparent contradiction is removed only if we assume that <italic>Caro</italic> holds that in the case of a Festival the law is different, since from the moment the Jew transfers the corpse to the Gentiles for burial we regard the corpse as having been already interred which is similar to the case of one who is taken out for burial to another city where mourning rites begin from the moment they turn away their faces &#x2014; <italic>D.Merb.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn982">16) Cf. Sem. and <italic>Asheri ibid.</italic> Although the law is that mourning takes effect only after burial (v. <italic>supra</italic> par. 1), in the case of a besieged city it is different. Hence, as soon as the closed coffin is placed in another house, this is considered its burial and is comparable to the ruling (v. <italic>infra</italic> par. 5) where hope was abandoned to bury the corpse, despite the fact that the mourners still entertain the hope of burying the corpse in the cemetery after the siege is lifted, for there is the possibility that the city might be conquered, and consequently, the corpse will have to remain in this condition &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> This applies even if the siege was over within the seven days of mourning, at which time interment was made in the cemetery grounds &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1013">47) <italic>Mord. ibid.</italic> Were we to permit him to count the previous day as part of the mourning period, it would result in adopting two contradictory leniencies.

However, if he had not yet recited the evening <italic>Tefillah</italic>, the day is counted in his mourning period (<italic>MaHaRShaL</italic> and <italic>Ba&#x1E24;</italic>), although the Congregation had already recited it &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> One who received &#x2018;near tidings&#x2019; (i.e., news of a death received within thirty days after death) at twilight, may count the preceding day as part of his mourning period &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh. Caro</italic>&#x2019;s ruling has reference only to the observance of mourning rites, but as far as <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> (anniversary of death) is concerned, that day is counted as the day on which <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> is fixed &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> Although in <italic>Caro</italic>&#x2019;s ruling mourning begins on the following day, the <italic>Tefillin</italic> (phylacteries), however, should be donned (v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 388) &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 376: THE DEPORTMENT OF THE COMFORTERS [AT THE HOUSE OF MOURNING] AND THE LAW OF A DEAD PERSON [WHO LEAVES] NO [MOURNERS TO BE CONSOLED BY] COMFORTERS. Contains four paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. The comforters are not permitted to open [conversation] until the mourner opens first; and the mourner reclines at the head [of the mourner&#x2019;s meal];<sup><xref rid="fn1014">2</xref></sup> and as soon as the mourner nods his head in a manner from which it is indicative that he dismisses the comforters,<sup><xref rid="fn1015">3</xref></sup> they are not permitted to remain seated by him.<sup><xref rid="fn1016">4</xref></sup> <italic>A mourner or a sick person are not required to rise even on account of a Nasi</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1017">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. To one who comes to show honour to his friend<sup><xref rid="fn1018">6</xref></sup> and to rise at his presence, [the latter] should say, &#x2018;Be seated,&#x2019; unless he is a mourner or a sick person,<sup><xref rid="fn1019">7</xref></sup> &#x2014; for [such a statement] would imply, &#x2018;Be seated in your mourning,&#x2019; or &#x2018;Be seated in your illness.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1020">8</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>A man should not say, &#x2018;I was not punished in accordance with my</italic> [<italic>evil</italic>] <italic>deeds,&#x2019; or anything similar to these words, for a man should never utter anything in such a way as to give Satan an opening</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1021">9</xref></sup> <italic>Neither should a man say to a mourner, &#x2018;What could you have done; it is impossible to change</italic> [<italic>God&#x2019;s verdict</italic>],&#x2019; <italic>for this is regarded as blashphemy, since it implies that were it possible to change</italic> [<italic>the verdict</italic>] <italic>he would have done so; but one should accept God&#x2019;s decree out of love</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1022">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. A corpse who leaves<sup><xref rid="fn1023">11</xref></sup> no mournerrs to be comforted,&#x2014; [the law is that] ten worthy people come and sit in his place<sup><xref rid="fn1024">12</xref></sup> throughout the seven days of mourning and the rest of the people assemble unto them. If ten permanent people were not present there daily, ten of the rest of the people assemble and sit in his place.<sup><xref rid="fn1025">13</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>However, I have not seen this custom in practice.

MaHaRShaL</italic> rejects this ruling in view of the fact that King David uttered a similar statement on the loss of his child, viz., <italic>&#x2018;But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast</italic>? <italic>Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me&#x2019;</italic> (II Sam. XII, 23), which implies that were it possible to bring him back again, he would have done so. <italic>Ta</italic>Z opposes <italic>MaHaRShaL</italic> and defends this ruling on the grounds that in the case of King David he merely expressed the fact that after death, fasting etc. is of no avail, but prior to death, needless to say, one should engage in prayer and fasting in order to counteract impending death. But once a person has suffered a bereavement, prayer and fasting no longer help. Hence, if one says to a mourner, &#x2018;What could you have done etc.&#x2019; it is tantamount to blashphemy. V. also <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> For this very reason the <italic>Ta&#x1E25;anun</italic> prayer is not recited in a mourner&#x2019;s home, since it contains the words, &#x2018;I have sinned etc.,&#x2019; nor the penitential prayer (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05D4;&#x05D5;&#x05D0; &#x05E8;&#x05D7;&#x05D5;&#x05DD;</span>) which contains, &#x2018;deal not with us according to our sins&#x2019; &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> V. <italic>infra</italic> par. 3 and notes.

Nor is the <italic>Hallel</italic> said in a mourner&#x2019;s house on <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh</italic>, for it contains the verse, <italic>&#x2018;the dead praise not the Lord&#x2019;</italic> and this would be regarded as mocking the poor (-dead) &#x2014; <italic>Ta</italic>Z. It is customary, however, that <italic>Hallel</italic> is said in a house of mourning, only that the mourners leave the room when the <italic>Hallel</italic> is recited. There is a further reason why the <italic>Hallel</italic> is omitted by mourners. For it contains verses such as, <italic>&#x2018;This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will be glad and rejoice thereon,&#x2019;</italic> which is not in keeping with mourning rites. A mourner may recite the <italic>Habdalah</italic> prayer during the mourning period, but should omit the introductory verses which express joy.

<ftnote id="fn1058">46) The following is a summary of the laws of precedence with respect to the recital of <italic>Kaddish</italic> based upon <italic>ShaK, Ta</italic>Z and the <italic>Later Authorities:</italic> a) A resident takes precedence over a stranger; b) It is only the first time a stranger comes to the services that he has a right to lead the service and has priority rights to recite one <italic>Kaddish</italic> where the resident has similar rights; c) Some adopt the practice that a stranger is on an equal footing with a resident with respect to <italic>Kaddish</italic>, as long as he is a permanent resident in the city, even if he does not pay taxes; d) One who is within the seven days of his mourning period, whether a resident or a stranger, whether of minority or majority age, takes precedence over the other mourners with respect to all the <italic>Kaddishim</italic> recited, and even if a Festival arrived at which time the seven or thirty days of mourning become annulled (v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 399), it does not apply to the recital of <italic>Kaddish.</italic> Furthermore, with respect to <italic>Kaddish</italic> we do not apply the principle &#x2018;that part of the day is considered as the whole day.&#x2019; This means that one is regarded to be within his seven or thirty days with respect to the recital of <italic>Kaddish</italic> until seven or thirty complete days have passed. As to the observance of mourning rites, the above principle applies (v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 395) ; e) One who is within his thirty days of mourning and one observing <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> each have a right to recite one <italic>Kaddish;</italic> f) One who is within his thirty days of mourning takes precedence over one observing <italic>Yahrzeit</italic>, although the latter has a right to recite one <italic>Kaddish</italic> (v. however, <italic>supra</italic> n. 45) ; g) If there are many observing <italic>Yahrzeit</italic>, the one who is within his thirty days is overridden; h) If there are many observing <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> and one who is within his seven days of mourning, the latter has a right to one <italic>Kaddish</italic> and the others cast lots; i) If there are many who are within their thirty days of mourning, one observing <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> and one within his twelve month period of mourning, the latter is overridden entirely, and all the <italic>Kaddishim</italic> of that day belong to the one observing <italic>Yahrzeit;</italic> j) The <italic>Kaddish</italic> recited after the daily Psalm (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D9;&#x05E8; &#x05E9;&#x05DC; &#x05D9;&#x05D5;&#x05DD;</span>) and after the Sabbath Psalm (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D6;&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05E8; &#x05E9;&#x05D9;&#x05E8; &#x05DC;&#x05D9;&#x05D5;&#x05DD; &#x05D4;&#x05E9;&#x05D1;&#x05EA;</span>) belong to the mourners.

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 378: THE LAWS OF THE MOURNER&#x2019;S MEAL WITH RESPECT TO A MAN AND A WOMAN. Contains thirteen paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. A mourner is forbidden to eat of his own at the first meal [after burial],<sup><xref rid="fn1080">1</xref></sup> but at the second [meal] he is permitted [to eat of his own] even on the first day [of mourning].<sup><xref rid="fn1081">2</xref></sup> A religious duty rests upon his neighbours to provide food for him of their own in order that he should not eat of his own.<sup><xref rid="fn1082">3</xref></sup> One may provide food for another person during the latter&#x2019;s mourning and the latter may in turn provide food for the former during his mourning,<sup><xref rid="fn1083">4</xref></sup> provided they do not make such a stipulation at the outset.<sup><xref rid="fn1084">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. If mourning befell a woman, men should not provide the mourner&#x2019;s meal for her,<sup><xref rid="fn1085">6</xref></sup> but women should provide her with the mourner&#x2019;s meal.<sup><xref rid="fn1086">7</xref></sup> If mourning befell a married woman, she may not eat the first meal [after burial] of her husband.<sup><xref rid="fn1087">8</xref></sup> So too, one who has [in his employment] a scribe or a hired man, if [each of them] receives meals as his payment, and mourning befell him, he should not eat the first meal of his employer. But one who feeds a poor person or an orphan [because it is a meritorious act] or his son and daughter without any stipulation,<sup><xref rid="fn1088">9</xref></sup> and mourning befell them, &#x2014; [the law is that] they may eat the first meal of the master of the house.</p>
<p>3. If the mourner desires not to eat on the first day,<sup><xref rid="fn1089">10</xref></sup> he may eat of his own<sup><xref rid="fn1090">11</xref></sup> even the first meal. <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>So too, if he was not provided with the mourner&#x2019;s meal on the first day until</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1091">12</xref></sup> <italic>the night, he is permitted to eat at night of his own</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1092">13</xref></sup> <italic>and he is not required to be provided with the mourner&#x2019;s meal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1093">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. It was customary to fast on the day of the death of scholars.<sup><xref rid="fn1094">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. [In the case of] one who was buried on the eve of the Sabbath close to nightfall prior to twilight,<sup><xref rid="fn1095">16</xref></sup> there is an authority who says that he should be provided then with the mourner&#x2019;s meal.<sup><xref rid="fn1096">17</xref></sup> But it seems to me that since this is not obligatory,<sup><xref rid="fn1097">18</xref></sup> it is better not to provide him then with the mourner&#x2019;s meal on account of the honour due to the Sabbath.<sup><xref rid="fn1098">19</xref></sup> And thus is the accepted custom.</p>
<p>6. The mourner&#x2019;s meal is not provided for [one whose] infant child died, unless it was thirty complete days old,<sup><xref rid="fn1099">20</xref></sup> or one knows for certain that its months [of pregnancy] were complete.<sup><xref rid="fn1100">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. One may sprinkle or sweep [the floors] in the house of mourning and wash dishes, cups, flasks and drinking vessels.<sup><xref rid="fn1101">22</xref></sup> However, one does not bring therein perfumes or spices,<sup><xref rid="fn1102">23</xref></sup> but he may bring them into a house wherein the corpse lies,<sup><xref rid="fn1103">24</xref></sup> and one does not recite a benediction over them.<sup><xref rid="fn1104">25</xref></sup> One does not expound legal matters or homiletical interpretations in the house of mourning,<sup><xref rid="fn1105">26</xref></sup> but one sits and is silent.</p>
<p>8. As soon as the corpse is buried, he<sup><xref rid="fn1106">27</xref></sup> may eat meat and drink some wine<sup><xref rid="fn1107">28</xref></sup> during the meal in order to dissolve the food in his bowels, but [he must] not drink to the full.<sup><xref rid="fn1108">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. [In] a locality where it is the adopted custom to provide the mourner&#x2019;s meal with meat, wine and savoury dishes, they do so.<sup><xref rid="fn1109">30</xref></sup> [However], at first they provide the mourner&#x2019;s meal with eggs or a dish of lentils as a symbol of mourning,<sup><xref rid="fn1110">31</xref></sup> and then they eat their sufficient requirement.</p>
<p>10. A great number of people should not [assemble] to eat with the mourner, for this would necessitate that they separate themselves to two different places.<sup><xref rid="fn1111">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. Where one is required to count seven [days of mourning] after the Festival,<sup><xref rid="fn1112">33</xref></sup> and so too, if one heard [near] tidings on the Sabbath,<sup><xref rid="fn1113">34</xref></sup> the first mourner&#x2019;s meal which is partaken of during the days of mourning must be provided [by others].<sup><xref rid="fn1114">35</xref></sup> <italic>However, some say that since the first day</italic> [<italic>of mourning</italic>] <italic>was postponed, the mourner&#x2019;s meal is not provided</italic> [<italic>by others</italic>]. <italic>And thus is the common practice</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1115">36</xref></sup> <italic>even where the</italic> [<italic>first day</italic>] <italic>enters into the counting of the seven</italic> [<italic>days of mourning</italic>], <italic>e.g., in localities where two</italic> [<italic>Festival</italic>] <italic>days are observed</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1116">37</xref></sup> [<italic>in which case</italic>] <italic>the second</italic> [<italic>Festival</italic>] <italic>day is counted</italic> [<italic>in the seven days of mourning</italic>].</p>
<p>12. The mourner&#x2019;s meal is not provided in the case of distant tidings.<sup><xref rid="fn1117">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. The distinguished comforter among them breaks bread, <italic>i.e., breaks bread to recite the blessing before the meal</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1118">39</xref></sup> and on the Sabbath he<sup><xref rid="fn1119">40</xref></sup> breaks bread in his usual manner.<sup><xref rid="fn1120">41</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1080">1) M.K. 27b in accord with R. Judah on the authority of Rab. Derived from the words of God to Ezekiel, <italic>&#x2018;And eat thou not the bread of men&#x2019;</italic> (Ezek. XXIV, 17) whence it follows that for others it is done. Should others, however, not provide him with the first meal, or in the case where he is the only Jewish resident in town, he may eat of his own &#x2014; <italic>Ta</italic>Z. Some explain that the reason the first meal is provided by others is that usually the mourner immediately after burial refuses to eat and in some cases prefers death &#x2014; <italic>Perisha.</italic> The main part of the mourner&#x2019;s meal is the bread as may be seen from the verse in Ezek. <italic>ibid.</italic>, but he may eat other dishes of his own even at the first meal &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> It is customary to bring him bread with eggs or lentils. Cf. B.B. 16b where it is stated that on the day that Abraham our father died, Jacob made a broth of lentils to comfort his father Isaac (v. Gen. XXV, 29-30 and <italic>Rashi</italic> a.l.), and the reason it was of lentils is that &#x2018;just as the lentil has no mouth (i.e., no cleft), so too, the mourner has no mouth (i.e., for speech)&#x2019;. Others say, &#x2018;Just as the lentil is round, so too, mourning rolls and goes around to all the denizens of this world.&#x2019; The practical difference between these two explanations is whether we should comfort with eggs, which have no cleft, but are not perfectly round. Hence, according to the first reason offered in the Talmud (B.B. <italic>ibid.</italic>) one may provide the mourner&#x2019;s meal with eggs. Some of the <italic>Later Authorities</italic> hold that also beverages should be provided by others at the first mourner&#x2019;s meal &#x2014; <italic>Le&#x1E25;em ha-Panim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1081">2) Thus also <italic>Tur</italic> and <italic>Asheri</italic> who explain that the words, &#x2018;on the first day&#x2019; mentioned in M.K. <italic>ibid.</italic> apply only to the first meal. Cf. Pes. 36a where the expression &#x2018;first day&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D9;&#x05D5;&#x05DE;&#x05D0; &#x05E7;&#x05DE;&#x05D0;</span>) refers to one meal. So also <italic>Hag. Maim. Ebel</italic> IV, 9 citing <italic>SeMaG</italic>, for the underlying principle is that we follow the lenient authority in laws of mourning (M.K. 18a; &#x2018;Er. 46a a.e.). <italic>Tosaf.</italic> (M.K. 20b s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05DB;&#x05D1;&#x05E8;</span> and 27b s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D9;&#x05D5;&#x05DD;</span>) maintain that the mourner must be provided with all the meals he requires on the first day, for they take &#x2018;first day&#x2019; to mean the meals of the entire day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1082">3) Y.M.K III, 5(82b). This refers only to the first meal.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1083">4) Even though both are in mourning. M.K. 27b in the case of Rabbah and R. Joseph.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1084">5) Thus <italic>Asheri.</italic> For if such a stipulation is made it would be considered as though each one ate of his own.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1085">6) Sem(H). XI, 2 because it offers an occasion for sin.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1086">7) <italic>Asheri</italic> on the authority of <italic>R. Meir of Rothenberg.</italic> Cf. Lev. R. VI, 3 and Lam. R. IV, 10 (Buber), according to which a woman should provide the mourner&#x2019;s meal for another woman in mourning.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1087">8) <italic>Asheri ibid.</italic> For since the husband is required to feed her, the food is regarded as her own. When she provides other women with the mourner&#x2019;s meal, she does not have to obtain her husband&#x2019;s consent, for this is considered a small matter for which the husband&#x2019;s approval is unnecessary. V. &#x1E24;.M. &#x00A7; 358 and <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 248. However, if the husband refuses, she may not bring the mourner&#x2019;s meal to other women. If both the husband and the wife are mourners, men are permitted to provide the mourner&#x2019;s meal for both, since the meal in this case is provided mainly for the husband, and indirectly she eats too &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> For the same reason, one who obligated himself to feed his son and daughter-in-law or his daughter and son-in-law, and mourning befell them, the latter may not eat of his food &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1088">9) V. <italic>supra</italic> par. 1, n. 5. Cf. B.B. 43b, <italic>RaShBaM</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D6;&#x05D4; &#x05E9;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05DA;</span>.</ftnote>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 379: THE LAW OF GRACE AFTER MEALS IN THE HOUSE OF MOURNING. Contains five paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. When grace is recited after meals in the house of mourning, one recites in the fourth benediction the following version:<sup><xref rid="fn1121">1</xref></sup> &#x2018;Blessed art Thou, Lord our God, King of the Universe, O God our Father, our King, our Creator, our Redeemer, our Holy One, the Holy One of Jacob, [our Shepherd, the Shepherd of Israel, the good King, who does good to all, who day by day has dealt kindly and will deal kindly with us],<sup><xref rid="fn1122">2</xref></sup> the living King, who is good and does good, God of Truth, Judge of Truth, who judges in righteousness. <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>Who takes away souls in judgment, who is Ruler in His Universe to do as it pleaseth him in it, for all his ways are judgment and we are His people and His servants and for everything we are dutibound to give thanks unto Him and to bless Him. He who fences in the breaches of Israel will fence in this breach from upon us and from upon this mourner for the sake of life and peace</italic>.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1123">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. Some<sup><xref rid="fn1124">4</xref></sup> add in the third benediction,<sup><xref rid="fn1125">5</xref></sup> [&#x2018;and rebuild Jerusalem, the Holy City speedily in our days,&#x2019; &#x2014; the words], &#x2018;Comfort, O Lord our God, the mourners of Jerusalem and the mourners who are observing this mourning. Comfort them from this mourning and make them rejoice from their sorrow,<sup><xref rid="fn1126">6</xref></sup> as it is said, <italic>one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1127">7</xref></sup> Blessed art Thou, O God, who comfortest Zion in the rebuilding of Jerusalem.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1128">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. Some say in the introductory benediction to say grace, &#x2018;Let us bless the Comforter of mourners whose food we have eaten.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1129">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. On the Sabbath [during the seven days of mourning], if the [mourner] said grace privately or even if grace was said with three mourners [present],<sup><xref rid="fn1130">10</xref></sup> one recites the benediction in the same manner as it is recited during the weekdays,<sup><xref rid="fn1131">11</xref></sup> for this is [considered mourning of domestic] privacy; and if others<sup><xref rid="fn1132">12</xref></sup> ate with him and said grace, one does not mention the nature of the occasion,<sup><xref rid="fn1133">13</xref></sup> for since there are others<sup><xref rid="fn1132">12</xref></sup> present, it is no longer [considered] private mourning.<sup><xref rid="fn1134">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. A mourner is counted in the number [requisite] for <italic>Tefillah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1135">15</xref></sup> and the saying of common grace<sup><xref rid="fn1136">16</xref></sup> both with respect to the number of three and ten.<sup><xref rid="fn1137">17</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1121">1) Ber. 46b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1122">2) The words in brackets should also be included, for it goes without saying that these words which are part of the regular version should also be recited &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> V. <italic>Siddur</italic> of Daily Services and also <italic>O&#x1E93;ar Hat.</italic> Vol. I, p. 765.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1123">3) <italic>Tur</italic> on the authority of <italic>Asheri</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Thus also Ber. 46b, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05E8;</span>. After inserting this version, the mourner continues with the regular text, &#x2018;Thou hast bestowed etc.&#x2019; &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> The mourner is given the priority to lead in the saying of grace and to recite the benediction over the cup of grace, even if he arrived towards the end of the meal, &#x2014; only during the seven days of mourning, for then he sits at the head (v. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 376), but not after the seven days. Furthermore, this (viz., that during the seven days the mourner has priority) applies only if both the mourner and the comforter are of equal distinction, but if the head of the house is a mourner and there is a guest present, or even if the guest is a mourner, then the law is that if the head of the house desires to lead in the saying of grace and to recite the blessing over the cup (even after the seven days), he has a right to do so &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> and <italic>Later Codifiers.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1124">4) <italic>Kol Bo</italic> s. 115. Thus also <italic>R. Amram; Tanya</italic> s. 68; <italic>Abudraham, Laws of Benedictions.</italic> Cf. the prayer <span dir="rtl">&#x05E0;&#x05D7;&#x05DD;</span> recited on the ninth day of Ab.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1125">5) V. <italic>O&#x1E93;ar Hat. ibid.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1126">6) Cf. Jer. XXXI, 12.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1127">7) Is. LXVI, 13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1128">8) One should not say, &#x2018;Blessed art thou &#x2026; who comfortest mourners <italic>and</italic> rebuildest Jerusalem,&#x2019; for the closing formula must never contain two subjects. One may, however, say, &#x2018;Blessed art Thou &#x2026; who comfortest Zion <italic>and</italic> rebuildest Jerusalem, for both these subjects relate to the same idea. This latter closing formula is said at the <italic>Min&#x1E25;a</italic> service on the ninth day of Ab in the <span dir="rtl">&#x05E0;&#x05D7;&#x05DD;</span> prayer &#x2014; <italic>Shak.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1129">9) <italic>Tur</italic> on the authority of <italic>R. Amram.</italic> Thus also <italic>N</italic> in <italic>T.H.</italic> In introducing the grace, the leader says, &#x2018;Let us bless the Comforter of mourners whose food we have eaten and through whose goodness we live,&#x2019; after which they respond, &#x2018;Blessed is the Comforter of mourners whose food we have eaten and through whose goodness we live.&#x2019; This is repeated by the leader. When ten people are present, the leader includes the words, &#x2018;our God&#x2019; after &#x2018;Blessed be.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1130">10) Or more.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1131">11) Since they are all mourners.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1132">12) Who are not mourners.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1133">13) The special additions in the grace after meals mentioned <italic>supra.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1134">14) For public mourning is not observed on the Sabbath or Festival days. Thus <italic>Tur</italic> on the authority of <italic>N</italic> in <italic>T.H.</italic> Cf. M.K. 20b, <italic>Tosaf</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05E7;&#x05D5;&#x05E8;&#x05E2;</span> end. V. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 400.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1135">15) V. Glos.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1136">16) Mord. M.K. III end. V. also Ket. 8b, <italic>Rashi</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05D1;&#x05E8;&#x05DB;&#x05EA;</span> and <italic>Tosaf., ibid.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05D9;</span>. However, at the first mourner&#x2019;s meal which is provided by others, the mourner is not counted in the number required to say common grace. Thus it follows from <italic>Mord. ibid.</italic> and also <italic>Rokea&#x1E25;.</italic> This is derived from Ket. 8b where it is stated that the mourners are not included in the number with respect to the benediction recited in the &#x2018;open space&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05E8;&#x05DB;&#x05EA; &#x05E8;&#x05D7;&#x05D1;&#x05D4;</span>). The &#x2018;open space&#x2019; is explained by <italic>Rashi</italic> (<italic>ibid.</italic>) to have reference to the place where the mourners were provided with the first meal by others (v. Meg. 23b). In the case however, of other meals that are partaken of by the mourners during the seven days of mourning, they are counted in the required number to recite grace in unison &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1137">17) When ten people say grace together, the words, &#x2018;our Lord,&#x2019; are included in the introduction to the grace.</ftnote>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 380: THINGS FORBIDDEN TO THE MOURNER. Contains twenty-five paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. The following are the things forbidden to the mourner:<sup><xref rid="fn1138">1</xref></sup> [He is forbidden] to engage in work,<sup><xref rid="fn1139">2</xref></sup> to bathe,<sup><xref rid="fn1140">3</xref></sup> to annoint himself,<sup><xref rid="fn1140">3</xref></sup> to put on sandals [or shoes],<sup><xref rid="fn1141">4</xref></sup> to have marital intercourse;<sup><xref rid="fn1142">5</xref></sup> he is forbidden to read the Pentateuch;<sup><xref rid="fn1143">6</xref></sup> he is forbidden to greet one &#x2018;with peace,&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1144">7</xref></sup> to wash [his garments],<sup><xref rid="fn1145">8</xref></sup> and he is dutibound to muffle his head<sup><xref rid="fn1146">9</xref></sup> and to invert his couch<sup><xref rid="fn1147">10</xref></sup> throughout the seven [days of mourning]; and he is forbidden to put on <italic>Tefillin</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1148">11</xref></sup> on the first day [of mourning];<sup><xref rid="fn1149">12</xref></sup> and he is forbidden to don laundried garments,<sup><xref rid="fn1145">8</xref></sup> to cut his hair,<sup><xref rid="fn1150">13</xref></sup> to rejoice<sup><xref rid="fn1151">14</xref></sup> and to resew a rent during the whole of the thirty days [of mourning].<sup><xref rid="fn1152">15</xref></sup> <italic>And all matters pertaining to mourning rites apply both during the day and during the night</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1153">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. In what respect [is a mourner forbidden to engage] in work?<sup><xref rid="fn1154">17</xref></sup> &#x2014; During the whole of the first three days he is forbidden [to engage] in work, even [if he is] a poor man who is supported from charity;<sup><xref rid="fn1155">18</xref></sup> thereafter, if he is a poor man and he has naught to eat,<sup><xref rid="fn1156">19</xref></sup> he does [his work] in privacy in his house;<sup><xref rid="fn1157">20</xref></sup> and a woman plies the spindle in her house;<sup><xref rid="fn1158">21</xref></sup> but the Sages said, &#x2018;May a curse<sup><xref rid="fn1159">22</xref></sup> come upon his neighbours, who, [by not providing his maintenance] were the cause of his need to thus [engage in work].&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1160">23</xref></sup> <italic>In the manner that one is permitted to write on &#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1148">11</xref></sup> <italic>so is</italic> [<italic>the mourner</italic>] <italic>permitted to write during his mourning, but not in any other way</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1161">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. Just as he is forbidden to do work [during mourning] even so is he forbidden to engage in business or to go from one town to another with [his] wares.<sup><xref rid="fn1162">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. Even business that might be lost [if postponed]<sup><xref rid="fn1163">26</xref></sup> the mourner is forbidden to engage in,<sup><xref rid="fn1164">27</xref></sup> both he as well as his male and female slaves, his sons and daughters<sup><xref rid="fn1165">28</xref></sup> whose labour belongs to him.<sup><xref rid="fn1166">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. [The mourner] is forbidden to do his work through [the agency of] others,<sup><xref rid="fn1167">30</xref></sup> <italic>even</italic> [<italic>through the agency of</italic>] <italic>a Gentile</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1168">31</xref></sup> unless it is business that might be lost [if postponed], for any business that might be lost [if postponed], the mourner is permitted to engage in through [the agency of] others;<sup><xref rid="fn1169">32</xref></sup> even aught that is forbidden during [<italic>&#x1E24;ol</italic>] <italic>ha-Moed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1148">11</xref></sup> on account of labour involved, is permissible [during mourning],<sup><xref rid="fn1170">33</xref></sup> even if it is skilled work. <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>And some say</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1171">34</xref></sup> <italic>that if he is unable to do the work through</italic> [<italic>the agency of</italic>] <italic>others, and it is business that might be lost</italic> [<italic>if postponed, the mourner</italic>] <italic>is permitted to do</italic> [<italic>it</italic>] <italic>himself;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1172">35</xref></sup> <italic>and after the first three days one may adopt the lenient practice, and even within the three days, if it involves a great loss.</italic></p>
<p>6. [With respect to selling] his wares in [the case of] business [which if postponed] might entail a loss, [namely], if he should not sell [now] he would suffer the loss of the principal, &#x2014; [the law is that] the sale may be made through [the agency of] others. However, if he should not suffer the loss of the principal, only that if he sells it now, he will make more profit than if he sells it later, it is forbidden.<sup><xref rid="fn1173">36</xref></sup> Yet, if caravans or ships arrived,<sup><xref rid="fn1174">37</xref></sup> or desire to leave, and are selling [goods] at a low price, or are buying [goods] at a high price, it is permissible [for the mourner] to sell or to buy through [the agency of] others,<sup><xref rid="fn1175">38</xref></sup> even if it is not required for his [personel] use, but rather to transact business [in order] to make a profit.<sup><xref rid="fn1176">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. [With respect] to lending money to a heathen on interest, [namely], to those who are accustomed to borrow from him, &#x2014; [the law is that] he is permitted to lend money through [the agency of] others, for this is considered business which [if postponed] entails a loss.<sup><xref rid="fn1177">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. One who has a monetary claim against others, and now [during the seven days of mourning] he is able to find them, but afterwards he is not able to find them, is permitted to send [other people] to them [in order to recover his debt].<sup><xref rid="fn1178">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. If he has a legal claim against another person, he should not summon [the latter to judgment] during the whole of the seven [days of mourning]. But if it is a matter which, [if postponed], entails a loss, e.g., if [the defendant] wishes to go to a foreign country,<sup><xref rid="fn1179">42</xref></sup> or his witnesses are ill,<sup><xref rid="fn1180">43</xref></sup> he may appoint a mandatory who litigates with him.<sup><xref rid="fn1181">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. All matters which they<sup><xref rid="fn1182">45</xref></sup> permitted on [<italic>&#x1E24;ol</italic>] <italic>ha-Moed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1148">11</xref></sup> on account of the Festival needs,<sup><xref rid="fn1183">46</xref></sup> are forbidden in [the case of] a mourner, even [if done] through [the agency of] others.<sup><xref rid="fn1184">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. A mourner whose field was in the possession of others on terms of metayage,<sup><xref rid="fn1185">48</xref></sup> or on a fixed rental lease,<sup><xref rid="fn1186">49</xref></sup> or on a labour contract,<sup><xref rid="fn1187">50</xref></sup> &#x2014; [the law is that] such persons may work in their usual way during the [seven] days of mourning of the owner of the field.<sup><xref rid="fn1188">51</xref></sup> And even if the time of their tenure expired before [the owner commenced mourning rites],<sup><xref rid="fn1189">52</xref></sup> and they remained in the field as they were [prior to the expiry date].<sup><xref rid="fn1190">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>12. If the mourner is a metayer<sup><xref rid="fn1191">54</xref></sup> [or a tenant farmer<sup><xref rid="fn1191">54</xref></sup> or a contractor of labour]<sup><xref rid="fn1191">54</xref></sup> in a field that belongs to others, he himself must not do the work, but through [the agency of] others it is permissible.<sup><xref rid="fn1192">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. If there is a daily worker<sup><xref rid="fn1193">56</xref></sup> who cultivates the mourner&#x2019;s field, even [if he is] in another town,<sup><xref rid="fn1194">57</xref></sup> &#x2014; [the law is that] he may not work.<sup><xref rid="fn1195">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. If the mourner has an ass or a ship rented<sup><xref rid="fn1196">59</xref></sup> or hired out<sup><xref rid="fn1197">60</xref></sup> to another person, the latter should not engage in work during the [seven] days of mourning of the owner of the ass or the ship, unless he hired it before he [the mourner] began the observance of mourning and the period [of rental] had not yet expired;<sup><xref rid="fn1198">61</xref></sup> but if the period of [rental] had expired, it is forbidden [to do work].<sup><xref rid="fn1199">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>15. If the ass or the ship were [rented out] to others on shares of one-half, one-third or one-fourth [of the earnings], some permit [them to work during the seven days of the owner&#x2019;s mourning],<sup><xref rid="fn1200">63</xref></sup> and others prohibit [this].<sup><xref rid="fn1201">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>16. If the mourner is in the hire of another person [and the period of his employment had not expired], he must not engage in work during his mourning,<sup><xref rid="fn1202">65</xref></sup> <italic>but through</italic> [<italic>the agency of</italic>] <italic>others, he is permitted</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1203">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>17. [If] others&#x2019; work was in his hand, even in the case of loose matter, e.g., [material] for weaving,<sup><xref rid="fn1204">67</xref></sup> whether it is a contract job or not a contract job, &#x2014; [the law is that] he may not do [work on] it.<sup><xref rid="fn1205">68</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>And if it is a matter which entails an irretrievable loss</italic> [<italic>if postponed</italic>], <italic>he may do</italic> [<italic>work on</italic>] <italic>it through</italic> [<italic>the agency of</italic>] <italic>others</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1206">69</xref></sup> <italic>One is permitted to receive work during the</italic> [<italic>seven</italic>] <italic>days of his mourning to be executed later, only that he should not weigh or measure</italic> [<italic>the material</italic>] <italic>after the manner in which he</italic> [<italic>usually</italic>] <italic>does this on other occasions</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1207">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>18. [If] his work was in the hand of others on a labour contract, [viz.,] in [the case of] loose material, &#x2014; they may not do [work on it] in his own house, but in the others&#x2019; house they may do [work on it],<sup><xref rid="fn1208">71</xref></sup> <italic>provided they received the work before he became a mourner</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1209">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>19. [If] one had a building [under construction] by others on contract,<sup><xref rid="fn1210">73</xref></sup> &#x2014; [the law is that] on a weekday, or on <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1148">11</xref></sup> they must not work, even if it is outside the city limits;<sup><xref rid="fn1211">74</xref></sup> and if these contractors are non-Jews, they are permitted to built it on a Sabbath or Festival, which fell during the days of [his] mourning, if it is outside the city limits,<sup><xref rid="fn1212">75</xref></sup> and [provided] there is no other city in which there are Jews within the limits of that house.<sup><xref rid="fn1213">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>20. If others undertook [on contract] to plough and sow his field, some say that they are permitted to plough and sow during the [seven] days of mourning of the owner of the field.<sup><xref rid="fn1214">77</xref></sup> However, there is [an authority] who prohibits [such work].<sup><xref rid="fn1215">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>21. Two [individuals who were] partners in a shop,<sup><xref rid="fn1216">79</xref></sup> and mourning befell one of them, close their shop so that the [other] partner should not do work publicly, but he may do work privately in his house, even work pertinent to the partnership. But if the mourner is a prominent person and the partnership is called by his name, so that even if [the other partner] will do work in his own house it is known that the mourner has a share in it, &#x2014; [the law is that] the other partner is forbidden to do work even in his house.<sup><xref rid="fn1217">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>22. Sweeping the house, washing cups and making the beds, are not considered as work [forbidden] to the mourner.<sup><xref rid="fn1218">81</xref></sup> Likewise, is it permissible for a woman to bake and cook during the days of her mourning<sup><xref rid="fn1219">82</xref></sup> <italic>all that she requires, but whatever she does not require is forbidden.</italic> So too, a woman who is a servant in another person&#x2019;s home and mourning befell her, is permitted to bake, cook and do other household needs, whether she serves gratuitously or for remuneration.<sup><xref rid="fn1220">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>23. One who goes from place to place for business and received near tidings<sup><xref rid="fn1221">84</xref></sup> [while on the way], &#x2014; [the law is that] if he can reduce [his work] not to conduct any business affairs in that city, it is well; if not, [i.e.,] if he will not buy in that city, he will not find [the same opportunity] elsewhere], he may [only] buy [what he requires] for the needs on the way<sup><xref rid="fn1222">85</xref></sup> [those] things which are considered the necessaries of life.<sup><xref rid="fn1223">86</xref></sup></p>
<p>24. For all [other] dead,<sup><xref rid="fn1224">87</xref></sup> if he desires to reduce his business affairs which are permissible for him [to engage in],<sup><xref rid="fn1225">88</xref></sup> e.g., any business which entails an irretrievable loss [if postponed], he may reduce; if he desires, he may not reduce; [but] for his father or mother he should reduce [his business].<sup><xref rid="fn1226">89</xref></sup></p>
<p>25. For all [other] dead, he is forbidden up to thirty days to go [out] for business on a distant [journey], for this involves great publicity and is similar to rejoicing, since one [ordinarily] travels in a caravan group and they rejoice much [while] on the road; in [the case of] his father or mother [he is forbidden] until his friends rebuke him<sup><xref rid="fn1227">90</xref></sup> and say, &#x2018;Go with us&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1228">91</xref></sup>.</p>

<ftnote id="fn1171">34) Even if it involves labour and is considered skilled work. Thus R. Simeon b.

If it is impossible to do the work privately, one who is in difficult financial circumstances, may do it even publicly, for we compare the law of the mourner to <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic>, and as in the latter case it is permitted to engage publicly in work, which if postponed, involves an irretrievable loss, so too, in the case of the mourner &#x2014; <italic>Heshib Moshe, &#x1E24;atam Sofer, Tifereth</italic> Z<italic>ebi</italic>, <italic>Sh.M.B.</italic></ftnote>

II, 3(81b). (<italic>Asheri</italic>&#x2019;s version of Y. <italic>ibid.</italic> is different from cur. edd.). If a buyer should suffer a loss on account of the seller who is in mourning, the latter is permitted to sell through the agency of others, and it is quite possible that even the mourner himself may sell directly &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> A distinction should be made between two kinds of business deals, viz., a) In the case of a business deal in which the mourner became interested only incidentally, but his main livelihood is derived from other sources, the law is that he is permitted to transact this incidental deal through the agency of others only when he suffers a loss if it is postponed; b) In the case of one, however, whose permanent source of income depends upon such transactions, even the prospective profit may be considered on the same footing as the principal, for the individual depends upon it for his livelihood. Consequently, the prohibition applies only in the case where he would make more profit now than later. But if, at present, he would make the same profit as later, it is permissible to sell through the agency of others, since there is also the possibility that later he will not make any profit at all &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1174">37) Similarly, if the market day coincides with his seven days of mourning, even if it is on a small scale, he is permitted to transact business through the agency of others.

Consequently, if the mourner were not permitted to lend the money through the agency of others, he would suffer a loss (<italic>Tur</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> The same principle applies also to other wares which they are accustomed to buy from him &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1178">41) <italic>Tur</italic> on the authority of <italic>N</italic> in <italic>T.H.</italic> For in this case too, it is considered an irretrievable loss should he have to wait until the seven day mourning period is over.

<ftnote id="fn1208">71) M.K. 11b. <italic>R.

<ftnote id="fn1216">79) Lit. &#x2018;who are shopkeepers.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1217">80) Y.M.K. III, 5(82) bot. where the ruling is mentioned that &#x2018;two partners &#x2026; must close their shop.&#x2019; However, from M.K. 11b in the case of Marion, the son of Rabin and Mar, the son of R. A&#x1E25;a, it appears that only in the case of a distinguished person we would rule thus, but not in other cases. This apparent contradiction is removed by <italic>RaBaD</italic> as follows: In Y. we deal with work done publicly (cf. the term <span dir="rtl">&#x05D7;&#x05E0;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;</span> -shop used <italic>ibid.</italic>), whereas in B. it refers to work carried on privately. Hence, Caro&#x2019;s ruling here. There are many authorities who adopt a lenient view with respect to partnership. Moreover, the leniency is extended even to cases where the shop belongs to the mourner alone, on the principle that it is impossible to keep one&#x2019;s shop closed for the entire week which would entail great losses. The question, however, may be raised, &#x2014; on what basis is such a leniency adopted? For even drawing up a bill of sale between the mourner and his partner or any other person, would not be helpful since the reason for the prohibition is on account of &#x2018;appearance sake&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05E8;&#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05EA; &#x05E2;&#x05D9;&#x05DF;</span>) and consequently, people will still know that the shop belongs to the mourner. <italic>RaShaL</italic> (<italic>Resp.</italic> 66) is lenient in this matter after three days (and part of the third day is considered a full day). Yet <italic>Maim.</italic> in Yad, <italic>Ebel</italic> V, 9 states that the prohibition remains in force for seven days. <italic>A.H.</italic> advances the following argument in favour of the lenient practice: With respect to a matter which entails an irretrievable loss if postponed, we find that mourning and <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic> are on an equal footing (v. O.&#x1E24;. &#x00A7; 539 where it is stated that if the market day falls on <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic> the individual may sit in his shop). Hence, we see that if a loss is involved, the question of conducting business publicly does not enter. Similarly, in the case of mourning. In Prague it was customary to dissolve the partnership or to transfer one&#x2019;s business by means of <span dir="rtl">&#x05E7;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05DF; &#x05E1;&#x05D5;&#x05D3;&#x05E8;</span>, i.e., a legal form of acquisition by handing over an article (e.g., a scarf) from one party to the other as a symbol that the object itself has been transferred. Some would transfer the business while still in the observance of <italic>Aninuth;</italic> others, whilst the person was in his dying condition. V. also <italic>P.Tesh.</italic> and <italic>Later Authorities.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1220">83) <italic>Ter. ha-Deshen.</italic> There is no contradiction between this ruling and that of par. 16 <italic>supra</italic>. The latter case deals with real work for a profitable purpose, whereas here it refers to attending to the household needs, which work is permitted for the mistress proper. Consequently, a woman servant (or any attendant) whom mourning befell, is permitted to do only such work which pertains to the household needs. The servant, however, must not leave the house during mourning &#x2014; <italic>Ta</italic>Z. A Synagogue attendant (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05DE;&#x05E9;</span>) who is in mourning, is permitted to attend to the Synagogue needs on the eve of the Sabbath &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 381: THE PROHIBITION OF BATHING AND ANNOINTING WITH RESPECT TO THE MOURNER. Contains six paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. In what manner is bathing [forbidden]?<sup><xref rid="fn1229">1</xref></sup> &#x2014; He is forbidden to bathe his whole body even in cold water, but his face, hands and feet he is forbidden [to wash] in warm water,<sup><xref rid="fn1230">2</xref></sup> [but] in cold water he is permitted.<sup><xref rid="fn1231">3</xref></sup> However, if he was soiled with mud or excrement, he may bathe in his usual way without any apprehension.<sup><xref rid="fn1232">4</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>And all this is forbidden legally only for seven</italic> [<italic>days</italic>], <italic>but subsequently he is permitted to bathe</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1233">5</xref></sup> <italic>only that nowadays it is the adopted practice to prohibit bathing throughout the thirty days</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1234">6</xref></sup> <italic>and even to cleanse the head is forbidden</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1235">7</xref></sup> <italic>And this custom should not be altered, for it is an ancient custom and was established by pious men</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1236">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. In what manner is annointing [forbidden]? &#x2014; Any annointing<sup><xref rid="fn1237">9</xref></sup> whatsoever is forbidden, if his intention is merely for the sake of pleasure;<sup><xref rid="fn1238">10</xref></sup> but if it is to remove dirt, it is permissible, and needless to say [that it is permitted if used] as a medicine, e.g., if he had scabs on his head.<sup><xref rid="fn1239">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. A woman in mourning after childbirth who requires to bathe,<sup><xref rid="fn1240">12</xref></sup> is permitted [to do so].<sup><xref rid="fn1241">13</xref></sup> Likewise, one who has scabs on his head,<sup><xref rid="fn1242">14</xref></sup> is permitted to cleanse his head in warm water, for [this case] is not less important than [the case of] a delicate person, <italic>i.e., one who is frigid in body and is overcome by cold</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1243">15</xref></sup> who is permitted to bathe his whole body. However, we do not permit anyone who says, &#x2018;I am a delicate person&#x2019; [to bathe], unless it is known that he is a delicate person and comports himself in cleanliness<sup><xref rid="fn1244">16</xref></sup> and should he not bathe he would suffer much and take ill.<sup><xref rid="fn1245">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. One who suffered a bereavement followed close on another [bereavement], [i.e.,] two mournings befell him, one immediately after the other, is permitted to bathe his whole body in cold water.<sup><xref rid="fn1246">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. A menstruous woman whose time for immersion became due during her [seven days of] mourning, does not immerse.<sup><xref rid="fn1247">19</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>So much the more that she does not bathe in order to put on</italic> [<italic>her</italic>] <italic>white garments</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1248">20</xref></sup> [<italic>worn during the counting of the seven days of cleanliness</italic>]. <italic>However, immediately after the seven days</italic> [<italic>of mourning</italic>], &#x2014; <italic>although it is the common practice to adopt a prohibition against bathing for the entire thirty days</italic>, &#x2014; <italic>yet, she is permitted</italic> [<italic>to bathe then</italic>], &#x2014; <italic>only that she should alter the</italic> [<italic>mode of</italic>] <italic>bathing a little</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1249">21</xref></sup> <italic>and she may put on a plain white frock</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1250">22</xref></sup> <italic>and spread out a</italic> [<italic>clean</italic>] <italic>white sheet</italic> [<italic>on her couch</italic>] <italic>so that she does not come to any doubt</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1251">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. A woman should not paint [her eyelids]<sup><xref rid="fn1252">24</xref></sup> nor rouge [her face]<sup><xref rid="fn1252">24</xref></sup> during the days of her mourning, for all these [things] are forbidden as bathing.<sup><xref rid="fn1253">25</xref></sup> A married woman is forbidden [to do this] only during the seven [days], but after the seven [days] she is permitted everything, so that she does not become repulsive to her husband.<sup><xref rid="fn1254">26</xref></sup> A bride whom mourning befell within the thirty days [subsequent] to her marriage, is permitted to adorn herself,<sup><xref rid="fn1255">27</xref></sup> even within the seven [days of mourning]. A girl who has reached adolescence,<sup><xref rid="fn1256">28</xref></sup> whom mourning befell, &#x2014; [the law is that] since she is ready for marriage, she is permitted painting [of the eyelids] and rouging [of the face],<sup><xref rid="fn1257">29</xref></sup> but is forbidden to bathe the entire body in warm water.<sup><xref rid="fn1258">30</xref></sup> A girl who has not reached adolenscence,<sup><xref rid="fn1259">31</xref></sup> who is a mourner, is forbidden even painting [of the eyelids] and rouging [of the face].<sup><xref rid="fn1260">32</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1229">1) M.K. 15b, derived from, <italic>&#x2018;And Joab sent to Tekoa and fetched thence a wise woman and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner etc&#x2026; and annoint not thyself with oil&#x2019;</italic> (II Sam. XIV, 2). Bathing is implied in the prohibition of annointing. V. Ruth III, 3; Ps. CIX, 18; Yad, <italic>Ebel</italic> V, 3 and cf. Yoma 76b.</ftnote>

Ebel</italic> X &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> The translation here &#x2018;bathing throughout the thirty days,&#x2019; follows <italic>ShaK</italic>&#x2019;s reading. Hence, it follows that in cold water it would be permissible during the thirty days. The undefined term <span dir="rtl">&#x05E8;&#x05D7;&#x05D9;&#x05E6;&#x05D4;</span> (bathing) refers to warm water (v. Y.M.K. III, 5(82d) ; cf. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 399 and O.H. &#x00A7; 549). Moreover, bathing in cold water is not considered pleasure (<span dir="rtl">&#x05EA;&#x05E2;&#x05E0;&#x05D5;&#x05D2;</span>) &#x2014; <italic>ShaK. D.Merb.</italic> and <italic>R. A. Eger</italic> maintain <italic>contra ShaK</italic> that even in cold water it is permissible to bathe only one&#x2019;s face, hands and feet, but the entire body should not be bathed in cold water for thirty days. <italic>A.H.</italic> agrees with <italic>ShaK. Or Zaru&#x2018;a</italic> explains that this prohibition regarding bathing within the thirty days is on account of combing the hair, which is forbidden within the thirty days. But since we permit combing of the hair today (v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 390), it would be permissible to bathe after seven days. <italic>RaShaL&#x2019;s</italic> reason for the prohibition of bathing is on account of hair-cutting. Hence, bathing should be forbidden just as hair-cutting is. On <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic>, however, we find that hair-cutting is forbidden and bathing is permitted. This difficulty may be removed on the grounds that on <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic> the prohibition of hair-cutting applies to everyone as a result of which people will remember and be careful. Consequently, bathing is permitted. But in the case of mourning, it applies only to the individual mourner. Hence, there is fear lest he forget (cf. Mishna Shab. 147a, <italic>Rashi</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D1;&#x05DC;</span>) &#x2014; <italic>Ta</italic>Z.</ftnote>

During the seven days of mourning he is forbidden to bathe unless a physician instructs him otherwise, although he is not considered a dangerously ill person &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> Bathing in public, however, is forbidden throughout the thirty days. V. <italic>Kol Bo</italic>(<italic>G</italic>) I, p. 356.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1237">9) With oil or washing with soap or the application of perfumes or the like &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> The prohibition extends both to the body and the hair, whether in the case of a man or a woman &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1240">12) In warm water &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> Even on the first day. However, if the need is not so great, we should be stringent on the first day of mourning (<italic>Later Authorities</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>

<p>1. A mourner is forbidden to put on sandals [or shoes]<sup><xref rid="fn1261">1</xref></sup> only if [they are made] of leather, but a pair of shoes made of cloth,<sup><xref rid="fn1262">2</xref></sup> reeds, hair or wood, is permissible,<sup><xref rid="fn1263">3</xref></sup> for an [ordinary] shoe is [usually made] of leather.<sup><xref rid="fn1264">4</xref></sup> However, if it [was made] of wood and covered over by leather, it is forbidden.</p>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 383: THE PROHIBITION OF MARITAL INTERCOURSE WITH RESPECT TO THE MOURNER. Contains two paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. A mourner is forbidden marital intercourse,<sup><xref rid="fn1274">1</xref></sup> but any other type of contact is permissible, [namely], even the mixing of the cup [for him], making the bed [for him] and washing his face, hands or feet, [irrespective] whether it is his mourning or her mourning [that is being observed].<sup><xref rid="fn1275">2</xref></sup> <italic>However with regard to embracing and kissing one should adopt a stringent view.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1276">3</xref></sup> She is permitted to eat with him from the same dish,<sup><xref rid="fn1277">4</xref></sup> and she is [also] permitted to sleep with him, [provided] he [is] in his garment and she [is] in her garment.<sup><xref rid="fn1278">5</xref></sup> However, since we say, &#x2018;take a roundabout route, O, Nazirite, [and do not come near the vineyard&#x2019;],<sup><xref rid="fn1279">6</xref></sup> one should adopt a stringent view, so that he should not sleep [with her]<sup><xref rid="fn1280">7</xref></sup> in the [same] bed at all.</p>
<p>2. The [above ruling] applies only with respect to [all] other [cases] of mourning, but if the father of the bridegroom died, or the mother of the bride, [in which case], they bring the corpse into a room, and the bridegroom and the bride into a bridal chamber, and he performs the dutiful marital act, and [then] separates [himself from her], and they observe [first] the seven days of the [wedding-] feast and after that [they observe] the seven days of mourning,<sup><xref rid="fn1281">8</xref></sup>&#x2014;[the law is that] he is forbidden to be alone with her throughout the fourteen days, [and] he sleeps only among the men and she sleeps among the women as is stated in &#x00A7; 342.<sup><xref rid="fn1282">9</xref></sup> But if he [already] married her and the days of the [wedding-] feast had begun, and subsequently he suffered a bereavement, he is permitted to be alone with her as in [all] the other [cases] of mourning,<sup><xref rid="fn1283">10</xref></sup> provided he had cohabited with her;<sup><xref rid="fn1284">11</xref></sup> however, if he had not cohabited with her, he is forbidden to be alone with her throughout the days of mourning, whether on a weekday or on a Sabbath.<sup><xref rid="fn1285">12</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn1283">10) Thus <italic>Asheri</italic> implied in Ket. <italic>ibid.</italic> In this case the seven days of the wedding-feast began legally and are not the result of leniency. Likewise, if one suffered a bereavement on a Festival, he is permitted to be alone with his wife (v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 399, 2 <italic>Gloss</italic>), for here too, the Festival sets in by itself and the question of leniency is not involved. Furthermore, the joy experienced on a Festival is not as great as in the case of a groom &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1284">11) In accord with the dictum of R. Joseph in Ket. 4a.</ftnote>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 384: THE MOURNER IS FORBIDDEN TO STUDY TORAH. Contains five paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. A mourner throughout the seven days [of mourning] is forbidden to read the Pentateuch, Prophets or Hagiographa, [or to study] <italic>Mishna, Gemara, Halakoth</italic> or <italic>Aggadoth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1286">1</xref></sup> If, however, the public have need of him<sup><xref rid="fn1287">2</xref></sup> in order that they receive instruction [from him], he is permitted [to study and thus prepare for the lecture],<sup><xref rid="fn1288">3</xref></sup> provided that [during the exposition of his lecture] he does not place [at his side] an interpreter, but he should expound [first] to another person, who, in turn, [conveys the exposition] to the interpreter, and the latter announces it to the public.<sup><xref rid="fn1289">4</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>Or he may himself expound</italic> [<italic>directly to the public</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn1290">5</xref></sup> <italic>One may render decisions in matters of ritual law to an individual inquirer</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1291">6</xref></sup> <italic>provided he is the only one available</italic> [<italic>to render such decisions</italic>] <italic>and the public have need of him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1292">7</xref></sup> <italic>But he is forbidden to expound Halaka to his students. Thus is the common practice, although some are lenient</italic> [<italic>in this matter</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn1293">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. If a mourner is a <italic>Kohen</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1294">9</xref></sup> and there is no other <italic>Kohen</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1294">9</xref></sup> [present] in the Synagogue, he is forbidden to go up to the reading of the Torah<sup><xref rid="fn1295">10</xref></sup> [as <italic>Kohen</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn1294">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. If there is no one else [present] who is [capable] of leading in the [Congregational] prayers to act on behalf of the public in order that they perform their duty, the mourner may lead in the [Congregational] prayers,<sup><xref rid="fn1296">11</xref></sup> and thus cause [the listeners] to perform their duty.<sup><xref rid="fn1297">12</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>It is a religious duty to recite the</italic> [<italic>daily</italic>] <italic>prayers at the morning and evening services in the place where the person died, even if there is no</italic> [<italic>surviving</italic>] <italic>mourner, for this affords gratification to the soul</italic> [<italic>of the departed</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn1298">13</xref></sup> <italic>and the mourner is counted in the Minyan.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1299">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. A mourner is permitted to read Job, Lamentations, the sad parts of Jeremiah and the Laws of Mourning.<sup><xref rid="fn1300">15</xref></sup> This applies only [if he reads or studies] privately, but he must not study with others, only that they [others] may sit and debate on the laws of Mourning [in his presence], and if they err, he may refute them in low indistinct speech,<sup><xref rid="fn1301">16</xref></sup> but he may not ask [them] questions.<sup><xref rid="fn1302">17</xref></sup> However, this applies only if the public have no need of him, but if the public have need of him, &#x2014; [the law is that] even with respect to other laws he is permitted [to engage in the study thereof] as we have already stated.<sup><xref rid="fn1303">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. A mourner who has minor children should not suspend them from their studies.<sup><xref rid="fn1304">19</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1286">1) V. Glos. for Heb. terms. M.K. 15a, 21a, derived from the words of God to Ezekiel, <italic>&#x2018;Sigh in silence.&#x2019;</italic> (Ez. XXIV, 17). According to Y.M.K. III, 5(82d) this ruling is derived from Job II, 13, <italic>&#x2018;And none spoke a word to him,&#x2019;</italic> where <italic>&#x2018;a word&#x2019;</italic> is taken in the sense of Torah. The study of the Torah is forbidden throughout the seven days contrary to the opinion of some authorities who hold that the prohibition against Torah-study should last for one day only as in the case of <italic>Tefillin</italic> (v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 388). The underlying reason for the prohibition is that the study of the Torah affords one joy (cf. Ps. XIX; CXIX, vv. 14, 16, 24, 47). Hence, the prohibition applies to the entire week. Cf. also M.K. 21a, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05DC;&#x05D5;</span> and <italic>T.H.</italic> A mourner is permitted to read Job, Lamentations, the sad parts of Jeremiah and the Laws of Mourning (<italic>infra</italic> par. 4). On a Festival day, however, when these subjects are forbidden to be studied, since they are not in keeping with the spirit of the Holiday, one may study all topics, for it is not proper to pass the time idly. On the fast day of the ninth of Ab (<italic>Tish&#x2019;a be-Ab</italic>), a mourner may be called to the reading of the Torah or to recite the <italic>Haftarah</italic>, since everyone is then in mourning and only the study of calamitous topics is permitted &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1287">2) M.K. 21a. After the third day of mourning (according to <italic>ShaK</italic> even on the first day), a teacher (even if there is another teacher available &#x2014; <italic>G.Mah.</italic>), may expound <italic>Halakoth</italic> to his pupils, for this comes within the category of &#x2018;the public have need of him&#x2019; (<italic>ShaK</italic> adds that passing the time idly would be considered with regard to children who have to be taught, &#x2018;a matter which entails an irretrievable loss, if postponed&#x2019;). <italic>Gelilah</italic> (also <italic>Hagbahah</italic>) is permissible for the mourner &#x2014; <italic>Ta</italic>Z. If the seventh day of mourning falls on the Sabbath, a mourner may be called to the reading of the Torah at the <italic>Min&#x1E25;a</italic> service. Actually, from a legal point of view, this should be permitted even at the morning service (v. <italic>Ta</italic>Z, <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 402, n. 5).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1294">9) Or a Levite. V. Glos.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1295">10) <italic>Tur</italic> on the authority of <italic>Ghayyat</italic>, since a lay Israelite may be called in the place of the <italic>Kohen</italic>, and much more so in a case where a distinguished lay Israelite is present, as in the case of Rab, who, although not a <italic>Kohen</italic> nor a Levite, read the Torah in place of <italic>Kohen</italic> (Meg. 22a). In par. 1 <italic>supra</italic>, we allow a mourner to engage in Torah study only when the public have need of him, but not in this case, since the law that a <italic>Kohen</italic> reads first was laid down in the interests of peace. V. Git. 59a-b. Cf. however, <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 400, 2, where <italic>Isserles</italic> states that if on the Sabbath there is no other <italic>Kohen</italic> present save the mourner, he may be called to the reading of the Torah. There is no contradiction between these two rulings. The ruling (<italic>infra</italic>) with respect to a <italic>Kohen</italic>-mourner on the Sabbath is due to the fact that on the Sabbath public mourning alone is forbidden. Hence, if the <italic>Kohen</italic> is not called to the reading of the Torah, it would indicate that he is observing public mourning which is forbidden on the Sabbath. The present ruling applies to a weekday when the study of the Torah is forbidden both privately and publicly &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1296">11) This implies that if there is someone else present who is capable of leading the service, the mourner is not required to do so, which contradicts the ruling mentioned <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 376, 4 <italic>Gloss.</italic> This apparent contradiction may be removed as follows: In the ruling (<italic>supra</italic>) we deal with one who is mourning for a parent, in which case the law is that leading the services is even more efficacious than reciting the mourner&#x2019;s <italic>Kaddish;</italic> whereas in the present ruling we deal with other cases of mourning where the mourner is not dutibound to recite the <italic>Kaddish</italic> &#x2014; <italic>Beth Hillel</italic>. This ruling, however, is rejected by many authorities (v. <italic>Ba&#x1E24;</italic>), and the law is that even in this case it is obligatory for the mourner to lead in the congregational services &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> A mourner may act as the Torah-reader if there is no one else available &#x2014; <italic>Mishmereth Shalom</italic>.</ftnote>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 385: THE LAW OF EXTENDING A GREETING OF PEACE WITH RESPECT TO THE MOURNER. Contains three paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. In what manner is a mourner forbidden to extend a greeting of peace?<sup><xref rid="fn1305">1</xref></sup> &#x2014; [During] the first three days<sup><xref rid="fn1306">2</xref></sup> he does not extend a greeting of peace to anyone. If others were unaware that he is a mourner, and extended to him a greeting of peace, he should not respond to them, but should inform them that he is a mourner.

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 386: THE LAW OF MUFFFLING THE-HEAD WITH RESPECT TO THE MOURNER. Contains one paragraph.</title>
<p>1. A mourner is required to muffle the head,<sup><xref rid="fn1325">1</xref></sup> i.e., to cover his head with a mantle or a piece of cloth [so that] part of it enfolds his mouth and the tip of the nose.<sup><xref rid="fn1326">2</xref></sup> And this [matter, viz.,] that a mourner is required to muffle [his head] all day, applies [only when he is alone], but when comforters come to him, he uncovers his head out of respect to them.<sup><xref rid="fn1327">3</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>Some say that in these countries we do not adopt the practice of muffling the head.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1328">4</xref></sup> <italic>Thus is the common practice, and one should not adopt the stringent view to make changes regarding a matter which our fathers did not practice.</italic></p>
<ftnote id="fn1325">1) M.K. 15a, derived from, &#x2018;<italic>And cover not thine upper lip&#x2019;</italic> (Ez. XXIV, 17) whence we infer that everyone else is required to do this.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1326">2) <italic>Tur</italic> on the authority of <italic>R. Hai Gaon</italic>, derived from the dictum of Samuel, &#x2018;a covering that is not like the covering of the Ishmaelites (up to the lips) is not a mourner&#x2019;s covering&#x2019; (M.K. 24a), and also from R. Na&#x1E25;man who demonstrated this by covering himself up in his mantle up to the sides of the beard (<italic>ibid.</italic>). Only the nose and eyes remained exposed. Cf. also Y.M.K. III, 5(82d) top, &#x2018;From this we learn that the mourner should cover his mouth. But let him cover his mouth from beneath? &#x2014; So that they should not say, he has an ailing on his mouth (and therefore ties it up).&#x2019; On muffling the head with a mantle or a piece of cloth, cf. <italic>T.H.</italic> on the authority of <italic>R.

<chapter>
<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 387: THE LAW OF OVERTURNING THE COUCH. Contains two paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. A mourner is required to overturn the couch.<sup><xref rid="fn1329">1</xref></sup> When the time for sleeping or eating [arrives], he may sit [or sleep] on an overturned couch, but during the entire day he may not sit even on an overturned couch save on the ground. So too, the comforters are not permitted to sit save on the ground.<sup><xref rid="fn1330">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. Now it is not the common practice to overturn the couch because the Gentiles will say that it is [a kind] of sorcery. Moreover, our couches are not made like their couches in order that overturning should be discernible [as it was in former days].<sup><xref rid="fn1331">3</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1329">1) M.K. 15a-b, 27a: &#x2018;A mourner is required to overturn his couch (bed), for Bar Kappara taught. &#x201C;I (the Lord) had placed my image among you, and for your sins I upset it; upset now your beds&#x201D;&#x2019; (cf. Ez. XXIV, 23). In Y.Ber. III, 1(6a); Y.M.K. III, 5(83a) this is derived from Job. II, 13, <italic>&#x2018;So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days.&#x2019;</italic> It was customary in those days for people to sit on couches or beds throughout the year. Hence, the mourner is required to overturn his couch and sit on the ground. Cf. however, M.K. 27a where it is stated that in a case of mourning, on the eve of the Sabbath, from the time of the <italic>Min&#x1E25;a</italic> (afternoon) service and onwards, the couches were placed in erect position, but the mourner did not sit down on them until it was dark. This shows that the overturning of the couches or beds was on account of the prohibition against sitting on them (v. ibid., Tosaf. s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05DF; &#x05D4;&#x05DE;&#x05E0;&#x05D7;&#x05D4; &#x05D5;&#x05DC;&#x05DE;&#x05E2;&#x05DC;&#x05D4;</span>). According to the opinion of Bar Kappara, even if the mourner sat or slept on the ground, he had to overturn all the beds or couches in his home save a couch used specifically for vestments (<italic>ibid.</italic> 27a).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1330">2) On overturning the couch, consult the following sources: Sem(H). XI, 10-19; Tosef. M.K. II, 9; Y.Ber. III, 1(5b-6a); Y.M.K. III, 5(82c-83a) ; Y.San.

Support for this may be found in Y.Ber. III, 1(6a); Y.M.K. III, 5(83a), where the reason for overturning the couches is derived from Job. II, 13, <italic>&#x2018;So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days&#x2019;</italic> (v. <italic>supra</italic> par. 1, n. 1).

One who is feeble in health or a pregnant woman may sit on ordinary stools or chairs. On the eve of the Sabbath, a few hours before nightfall, the mourner may rise from the low stools and close to the time of kindling the Sabbath lights, he may put his shoes on &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>

It is also forbidden to wash the sheets and bed-covers,<sup><xref rid="fn1345">8</xref></sup> or to spread out those already washed. And so too, hand-towels, although it is permissible to wash them during [<italic>&#x1E24;ol-</italic>] <italic>ha-Moed</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1346">9</xref></sup> and likewise, [the garments of] all those [persons] of whom we learnt<sup><xref rid="fn1347">10</xref></sup> that they may wash [their garments] during [<italic>&#x1E24;ol-</italic>] <italic>ha-Moed</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1346">9</xref></sup> e.g., one coming out of captivity or prison, or one under a ban and was released by the Sages, or one who applied to a Sage and was released [from a vow],<sup><xref rid="fn1348">11</xref></sup> or one arriving from beyond the sea<sup><xref rid="fn1349">12</xref></sup> [for the purpose of conducting business] in order to make profit and had no opportunity to cut his hair,<sup><xref rid="fn1350">13</xref></sup> &#x2014; are forbidden [to be washed] during one&#x2019;s mourning,<sup><xref rid="fn1351">14</xref></sup> &#x2014; for if one of these [aforementioned] things happened to him [the mourner] prior to the [period of his] mourning, and he [thus] entered forthwith into the [period of] mourning, &#x2014; [the law is that] he is forbidden to wash [his garments], unless one of these [aforementioned] things happened to him, following which he suffered one bereavement immediately after another, [in which case only] is he permitted to wash [his garments], even in natron and lye, and even during the seven [days of mourning], provided he does it in privacy in his home; and after [the period wherein] he suffered one bereavement immediately after another [is over], he is permitted to wash [his garments] in water, but not in natron, or in the [ingredients of the] alcalic plant.</p>
<p>2. It is permissible to wash the garments of minor children whose father<sup><xref rid="fn1352">15</xref></sup> died.<sup><xref rid="fn1353">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. It is forbidden to wear during the seven [days of mourning] new dyed garments or old clothes coming out of the press,<sup><xref rid="fn1354">17</xref></sup> <italic>i.e., an instrument for pressing clothes</italic>. <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>Some say that it is forbidden to wear Sabbath garments during the first four weeks</italic> [<italic>of mourning</italic>], <italic>but subsequent to that it is permissible, even</italic> [<italic>for one who is in mourning</italic>] <italic>for his father or mother</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1355">18</xref></sup> <italic>So too</italic>, [<italic>is it permissible</italic>] <italic>to make new garments</italic> [<italic>after the first week of mourning</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn1356">19</xref></sup> <italic>However, the common practice is to treat this</italic> [<italic>matter</italic>] <italic>as forbidden for the entire twelve months.</italic></p>
<p>4. [The mourner] is forbidden during the seven [days of mourning] to wash [garments] and put [them] away [for later use], whether he himself [does the washing] or through others.<sup><xref rid="fn1357">20</xref></sup> However, if his garment was in the hand of others on a labour contract, [the laundryman] may wash it in his usual manner as [in the case of] other work of his, [viz., his] loose material that is in the hand of others<sup><xref rid="fn1358">21</xref></sup> under a labour contract.<sup><xref rid="fn1359">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. [During] the entire thirty days [the mourner] is forbidden to wear, <italic>or to spread out under him</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1360">23</xref></sup> a pressed garment, provided it is white and new,<sup><xref rid="fn1361">24</xref></sup> and even if it is a flaxen [garment].<sup><xref rid="fn1362">25</xref></sup> [One in mourning] for his father or mother is forbidden [to wear pressed garments] until the [first] Festival after the thirty days arrives and his friends rebuke him.<sup><xref rid="fn1363">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. [As to the meaning of] laundry work, some say<sup><xref rid="fn1364">27</xref></sup> [that it corresponds to] SQL<sup><xref rid="fn1365">28</xref></sup> in the Arabic language; others say that it means washing [garments] in water and ashes or in natron and soap.<sup><xref rid="fn1366">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. After the seven [days of mourning, the mourner] is permitted to do laundry work both for himself<sup><xref rid="fn1367">30</xref></sup> and for others. The [prohibition against] laundry work for thirty days was stated only with respect to wearing [laundried garments].<sup><xref rid="fn1368">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. There is an authority<sup><xref rid="fn1369">32</xref></sup> who states that nowadays there is no prohibition against laundry work, for they<sup><xref rid="fn1370">33</xref></sup> said, &#x2018;Our laundry work is like their washing.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1371">34</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1338">1) In Talmudic days there were two kinds of washing: a) <span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05D9;&#x05D1;&#x05D5;&#x05E1;</span> i.e., plain washing, and b) <span dir="rtl">&#x05D2;&#x05D9;&#x05D4;&#x05D5;&#x05E5;</span> i.e., laundry work. In Ket. 10b it is stated that &#x2018;our (i.e., Babylonian) laundry work is like their (i.e., Ere&#x1E93; Israel) washing.&#x2019; In the Land of Israel the plain washing was superior to the Babylonian, because they had either better water or better ingredients for washing. In order to procure satisfactory results, they would have to do fine laundry work in Babylonia, and that would include smoothing the cloth or garment with a stone, or according to <italic>Rashi</italic> (<italic>ibid</italic>.) with a gloss-stone. V. S. <italic>Krauss T.A.</italic> I, 156, 581 and cf. Ta&#x2018;an. 29b. There are two main views held among the authorities regarding these terms. 1) During the seven days of mourning every type of washing is forbidden for two reasons &#x2014; a) It entails work. Hence, not only the mourner is forbidden to wash his clothes, but others are also forbidden to do this for him (v. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 380); b) There is a prohibition against wearing even garments that were washed prior to the time that mourning sets in. <italic>This is derived from, &#x2018;And Joab sent to Tekoa and fetched thence a wise woman and said unto her: I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner and put on mourning apparel, I pray thee, and annoint not thyself with oil but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead&#x2019;</italic> (II Sam. XIV, 2) &#x2014; M.K. 15a. With respect to the thirty days of mourning, no prohibition against washing (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05D9;&#x05D1;&#x05D5;&#x05E1;</span>) is found in the Talmud; only the prohibition against laundry work (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D2;&#x05D9;&#x05D4;&#x05D5;&#x05E5;</span>) applies then. During the entire thirty days the mourner is forbidden to wear laundried garments (M.K. 23a), and R. Eleazar b. R. Simeon forbade only new white linen clothes, and Raba (<italic>ibid.</italic>) rules in accord with the latter. V. also <italic>ibid.</italic> 27b; Yeb. 43a and <italic>Rashi</italic> a.l.; Yad, <italic>Ebel</italic> V, 1, 3; VI, 4. This represents the view of <italic>Rashi, Maim.</italic> and <italic>Alfasi.</italic> 2) Even washing (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05D9;&#x05D1;&#x05D5;&#x05E1;</span>) is forbidden for thirty days. This is derived from Sem(H). VII, 4, where it is stated, &#x2018;One who did not wash garments on the eve of a Festival should not wash for thirty days.&#x2019; The Talmudic texts (cited <italic>supra</italic> 1) are explained as follows: Yeb. <italic>ibid.</italic> is interpreted according to this viewpoint as referring only to those persons enumerated in Mishna, M.K. III, 2. Regarding M.K. 27b, the text should be emended to read, &#x2018;thirty days for washing (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05D9;&#x05D1;&#x05D5;&#x05E1;</span>), and as to M.K. 15a, it should be understood as referring to washing in water only, which is permitted during the thirty days save the seven days of mourning. However, washing with natron and lye is forbidden (M.K. 23a, Tosaf. s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05DC;</span>). &#x2014; This is the viewpoint held by <italic>RIBA. Caro</italic> accepts the first viewpoint which represents the majority of the authorities.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1339">2) M.K. 17b, derived by R. &#x1E24;isda from the Baraitha concerning one who suffered one bereavement immediately after another. V. also Ta&#x2018;an. 13a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1340">3) I.e., all types of washing.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1341">4) I.e., prior to the mourning period (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 1). V. <italic>T.H. contra Rashi.</italic> Cf. M.K. 24b, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05E8;&#x05DB;&#x05EA;</span>. V. also O.&#x1E24;. &#x00A7; 551, 3.</ftnote>

On the contrary, is has a legal basis (v. <italic>supra</italic> n. 1) in accordance with the viewpoint of <italic>RIBA.</italic> However, as far as the law is concerned, we accept the view of the majority of the authorities. Thus also <italic>B.Yos.</italic> &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1344">7) <italic>Kol Bo</italic> and <italic>SeMaK</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Nowadays we do not practice the custom of giving another person the garments to put on first, for we adopt a lenient view with respect to an undergarment or shirt, since they are not worn for the sake of pleasure. One may therefore, change his undershirt on account of perspiration and <italic>RIBA</italic> may be referring to other garments usually worn on the Sabbath. During the seven days of mourning, one may put on a clean undershirt, if necessary, on account of perspiration or in a case where one suffers from a skin disease. It is only in the case of a garment that is worn for the sake of pleasure that the prohibition applies on the same principle as in the case of bathing (v. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 381 and notes) &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1354">17) <italic>Tur</italic> on the authority of <italic>T.H.</italic>, derived from M.K. 23a: &#x2018;Our Rabbis taught: (Throughout the entire) thirty days (the mourner) is prohibited against wearing pressed garments. It matters not whether they be old or new garments coming out of the press. Rabbi says, They only forbade new garments. R. Eleazar b. R. Simeon says, They only forbade new white linen garments.&#x2019; Since in matters of mourning we follow the lenient view, consequently, we adopt the lenient view of R. Eleazar b. R. Simeon. This view, however, applies only during the thirty days, whence it follows that during the seven days of mourning it is forbidden.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1355">18) <italic>Birke Yos.</italic> (<italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 400) rules that on the Sabbath one is permitted to wear Sabbath garments, for otherwise this will be regarded as public mourning which is prohibited on the Sabbath.

<chapter>
<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 390: THE LAWS OF CUTTING AND COMBING THE HAIR WITH RESPECT TO THE MOURNER. Contains seven paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. A mourner is forbidden to cut his hair,<sup><xref rid="fn1372">1</xref></sup> both the hair of his head as well as the hair of his beard, or any hair that he has [on his body], even that of the secret parts, &#x2014; for the entire thirty days.<sup><xref rid="fn1373">2</xref></sup> [As to] the hair of the upper lip and that which [droops] on the sides,<sup><xref rid="fn1374">3</xref></sup> &#x2014; [the law is that] whatsoever causes a hindrance in partaking of food,<sup><xref rid="fn1375">4</xref></sup> is forbidden [to be trimmed] during the seven [days of mourning] and permitted after the seven [days of mourning].<sup><xref rid="fn1376">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. [If a man] sat down to have his hair cut, and he was told that his father<sup><xref rid="fn1377">6</xref></sup> died, he may complete [cutting the hair of] his head, both if the hair-cutter as well as the one who was having his hair cut [suffered the bereavement];<sup><xref rid="fn1378">7</xref></sup> and the fact that the hair-cutter may complete [the hair-cut, even after he was informed that he suffered a bereavement] applies [only in the case] where no other hair-cutter is available in the town.<sup><xref rid="fn1379">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. All those concerning whom they [the Sages] said that it is permissible [for them] to cut their hair during <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1380">9</xref></sup>, &#x2014; if any of these things happened to one prior to the [period of his] mourning, and [subsequently] he entered forthwith into the [period of his] mourning, &#x2014; [the law is that] he is forbidden to cut his hair; but if one of these things happened to him [the mourner], and [following which], he suffered one bereavement immediately after another,<sup><xref rid="fn1381">10</xref></sup> &#x2014; [the law is that] he cuts his hair in his usual manner, both with a razor or a scissors, even during the seven [days of mourning].<sup><xref rid="fn1382">11</xref></sup> However, another person who suffered one bereavement after another,<sup><xref rid="fn1383">12</xref></sup> may make his hair lighter with a razor but not with a scissors,<sup><xref rid="fn1384">13</xref></sup> <italic>provided he does it in privacy</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1385">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. For all dead he cuts his hair after thirty days; for his father or mother [he lets his hair grow]<sup><xref rid="fn1386">15</xref></sup> until his friends rebuke him.<sup><xref rid="fn1387">16</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>An</italic> [<italic>intervening</italic>] <italic>Festival has no legal effect</italic>, [<italic>viz., to suspend the aforementioned law</italic>], <italic>if it</italic> [<italic>the Festival</italic>] <italic>occurs prior</italic> [<italic>to the time</italic>] <italic>that his friends rebuke him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1388">17</xref></sup> <italic>As to the time limit</italic> [<italic>after which</italic>] <italic>a rebuke</italic> [<italic>should take place</italic>], <italic>there is a difference of opinion</italic> [<italic>among the authorities</italic>], <italic>and the common practice is</italic> [<italic>to wait</italic>] <italic>three months</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1389">18</xref></sup> <italic>And in these localities it is the adopted practice not to cut one&#x2019;s hair</italic> [<italic>when in mourning</italic>] <italic>for a father or mother, during the entire twelve months</italic> [<italic>of mourning</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn1390">19</xref></sup> <italic>unless the need</italic> [<italic>is great</italic>], <italic>e.g., if his hair is too heavy upon him or he goes among gentiles and appears repulsive to them with his hair, in which case he is permitted to cut his hair</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1391">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. A woman is permitted to remove hair after the seven [days of mourning].<sup><xref rid="fn1392">21</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>And some declare this forbidden even for a woman;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1393">22</xref></sup> <italic>and thus is the</italic> [<italic>accepted</italic>] <italic>fundamental principle</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1394">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. One is permitted to comb [the hair] of his head with a comb,<sup><xref rid="fn1395">24</xref></sup> even during the seven [days of mourning].<sup><xref rid="fn1396">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. Just as it is forbidden to cut hair during the entire thirty days [of mourning],<sup><xref rid="fn1397">26</xref></sup> so also is it forbidden to cut one&#x2019;s nails<sup><xref rid="fn1398">27</xref></sup> with a nail-cutter, but [if done] with one&#x2019;s hands or teeth, it is permissible,<sup><xref rid="fn1399">28</xref></sup> even during the seven days [of mourning].<sup><xref rid="fn1400">29</xref></sup> A woman whose immersion [in the ritual bath] occurs after the seven, [but] during the thirty [days of mourning], if she should remove her nails with her hands or teeth, she would not remove them well, but she should [rather] instruct a Gentile woman to remove them for her with a razor or scissors.<sup><xref rid="fn1401">30</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>And not necessarily a Gentile woman, but this may likewise be done by a Jewish woman</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1402">31</xref></sup> <italic>but he</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1403">32</xref></sup> <italic>used the customary phraseology mentioned with respect to &#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1404">33</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1372">1) M.K. 14a, b, derived from the Biblical injunction, <italic>&#x2018;Let not the hair of your heads go loose&#x2019;</italic> (Lev. X, 6), whence we infer that for everyone else cutting the hair is forbidden. Cf. Ez. XLIV, 20. If a mourner is invited to be the <italic>Sandek</italic> at a circumcision, or if he is the <italic>Mohel</italic>, he is forbidden to cut his hair and this does not come within the ruling mentioned <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 391, 2 <italic>Gloss</italic> on the authority of <italic>MaHaRIL</italic> &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1373">2) Sem(H). VII, 11. V. also <italic>ibid.</italic> p. 230. Cf. <italic>Asheri</italic> to M.K. 23a; Yeb. 43a, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05DE;&#x05E7;&#x05D5;&#x05DD;</span>.</ftnote>

M.K. <italic>ibid., Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05D1;&#x05D2;&#x05E0;&#x05D5;&#x05E1;&#x05D8;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;</span>. In <italic>B.Yos. Caro</italic> states that this was permitted only on <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic> in accord with Yad, <italic>Ebel</italic> V, 2 and <italic>RaBaD</italic>, but not with respect to mourning. V. <italic>Kes. Mish. ibid.</italic> Sem(H) <italic>ibid.</italic> is adduced that trimming the upper lip and the drooping sides was permitted only with respect to <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic>, but not regarding mourning. <italic>N</italic> in <italic>T.H.</italic> cites Y.M.K. III, 1(82a) according to which even during the seven days of mourning this would be permitted. <italic>Caro</italic> (in <italic>B.Yos</italic>.) also quotes Y. <italic>ibid.</italic>, but makes a compromise and rules in accord with <italic>Ghayyat. W.G.</italic> states that the ruling of <italic>N</italic> in <italic>T.H.</italic> is fundamental.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1377">6) Or any other near-of-kin for whom he must observe mourning rites.</ftnote>

Since this law is also found in Y.Shab. <italic>ibid.</italic> it seems that in the present ruling too, the same standard of time applies as in the case of hair-cutting on the eve of the Sabbath, viz., that hair-cutting commences from the time he places the hair-cutter&#x2019;s wrap upon his knees (Shab. 9b) &#x2014; <italic>R.A.Eger.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1383">12) I.e., one to whom the aforementioned things did not happen (v. n. 9 <italic>supra</italic>). The second bereavement was sustained at the conclusion of the thirty days of mourning after the first bereavement.</ftnote>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 391: A MOURNER IS FORBIDDEN ALL TYPES OF JOYOUS ENTERTAINMENT. Contains three paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. A mourner is forbidden joyous entertainment.<sup><xref rid="fn1405">1</xref></sup> Therefore, he should not take an infant in his arms<sup><xref rid="fn1406">2</xref></sup>, lest he be amused [thereby].<sup><xref rid="fn1407">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. [One in mourning] for all [other] dead may enter a house of feasting after thirty days; for his father and mother [not] until after twelve months [of mourning].<sup><xref rid="fn1408">4</xref></sup> And even if the year is a leap year, he is permitted [to enter a house of feasting] after twelve months.<sup><xref rid="fn1409">5</xref></sup> However, [in the case of] a joyous entertainment of companions,<sup><xref rid="fn1410">6</xref></sup> which he [the mourner] is obliged to reciprocate forthwith, he is permitted to hold it immediately after the seven days;<sup><xref rid="fn1411">7</xref></sup> but if he is not obliged to reciprocate it, he is forbidden to enter [the place of such entertainment] until thirty days;<sup><xref rid="fn1412">8</xref></sup> and [one in mourning] for his father or mother, even if he is obliged to reciprocate it, he is forbidden <italic>until</italic> after twelve months.<sup><xref rid="fn1413">9</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>And in</italic> [<italic>the case of</italic>] <italic>a group</italic> [<italic>gathered</italic>] <italic>for a religious purpose, e.g., one</italic> [<italic>a mourner</italic>] <italic>who gives away in marriage a male or female orphan</italic> [<italic>thus performing a religious act</italic>] <italic>for the sake of heaven, and should he not eat there</italic>, [<italic>his meritorious</italic>] <italic>act might become suspended</italic>, &#x2014; [<italic>the law is that</italic>] <italic>he is permitted</italic> [<italic>to join in the festivities</italic>] <italic>after thirty</italic> [<italic>days</italic>];<sup><xref rid="fn1414">10</xref></sup> <italic>but within the thirty</italic> [<italic>days of mourning</italic>], <italic>he is forbidden</italic> [<italic>to join</italic>] <italic>in any feast whatsoever that is connected with a religious deed.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1415">11</xref></sup> <italic>However, he may enter</italic> [<italic>to join in</italic>] <italic>a feast that is connected with a religious act that has no joyous entertainment</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1416">12</xref></sup> <italic>e.g., the redemption of the</italic> [<italic>firstborn</italic>] <italic>son, or a feast of circumcision</italic>, [<italic>in which case</italic>] <italic>he is permitted to eat there, even during the seven</italic> [<italic>days of mourning</italic>], <italic>provided he does not leave the door of his house;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1417">13</xref></sup> <italic>but there are some who prohibit</italic> [<italic>this</italic>] <italic>in</italic> [<italic>the case of</italic>] <italic>a feast of circumcision.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1418">14</xref></sup> <italic>The accepted practice, however, is, not to eat at any feast whatsoever, for the entire twelve months</italic> [<italic>of mourning</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn1419">15</xref></sup> &#x2014; <italic>if it is outside of his home; and in his home we adopt the lenient view</italic>, [<italic>viz.</italic>,] <italic>that he may eat in his home at a feast of circumcision, and much more so at other feasts that have no joyous entertainment;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1420">16</xref></sup> <italic>but in</italic> [<italic>the case of</italic>] <italic>a marriage-feast the stringent view should be adopted. Thus seems to me</italic> [<italic>to be the correct view</italic>]. <italic>A mourner who is a Sandek</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1421">17</xref></sup> <italic>or a Mohel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1421">17</xref></sup> <italic>may wear Sabbath garments until after the circumcision, and he is permitted to enter a circumcision ceremony</italic> [<italic>and</italic>] <italic>to eat there, if it is after the thirty</italic> [<italic>days of mourning</italic>], <italic>although the circumcision does not</italic> [<italic>take place</italic>] <italic>in his home</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1422">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. [With respect] to [a mourner] entering [a place wherein] a marriage ceremony [is held], [i.e.,] not at the time that the wedding-meal is served, [but only] to hear the benedictions [recited under the canopy], &#x2014; some permit,<sup><xref rid="fn1423">19</xref></sup> and others prohibit, [unless] he remains only outside the building [wherein the marriage ceremony is held] in order to hear the benedictions.<sup><xref rid="fn1424">20</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>But he should not enter the building at all at the time that</italic> [<italic>people who conduct</italic>] <italic>the musical entertainment for the groom and bride, are present therein.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1425">21</xref></sup> <italic>And this is the common practice in Germany</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1426">22</xref></sup> <italic>and in these countries.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1427">23</xref></sup> <italic>However, all this</italic> [<italic>refers to</italic>] <italic>the house wherein the wedding</italic> [<italic>-feast</italic>] <italic>is held</italic>, [<italic>viz., to the place</italic>] <italic>wherein they eat, drink and make merry, but as to</italic> [<italic>the wedding ceremony under</italic>] <italic>the canopy which is held in the Synagogue</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1428">24</xref></sup> <italic>where they recite the betrothal and marriage benedictions, and where there is no joyous entertainment</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1429">25</xref></sup> <italic>at all, it is permissible</italic> [<italic>to enter therein</italic>] <italic>immediately after the seven</italic> [<italic>days of mourning</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn1430">26</xref></sup> <italic>and some prohibit until thirty</italic> [<italic>days</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn1431">27</xref></sup> <italic>and thus seems to me</italic> [<italic>to be the correct view</italic>]. <italic>There are some localities where a stringent view is adopted for the mourner to remain during the entire twelve months outside the Synagogue</italic> [<italic>with respect</italic>] <italic>to hearing the benedictions</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1432">28</xref></sup> <italic>Nevertheless, it seems</italic> [<italic>to me</italic>] <italic>that a mourner may recite the benedictions of betrothal and marriage under the canopy in the synaagogue</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1433">29</xref></sup> <italic>and he may likewise lead a groom</italic> [<italic>to the canopy</italic>] <italic>in accordance with the usage of our country that two persons lead the groom under the canopy, and he</italic> [<italic>the mourner</italic>] <italic>may wear some</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1434">30</xref></sup> <italic>of</italic> [<italic>his</italic>] <italic>Sabbath garments at the time that they lead</italic> [<italic>the groom under the canopy</italic>], <italic>provided it is after thirty</italic> [<italic>days of mourning</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn1435">31</xref></sup> <italic>And thus is the common practice</italic>. <italic>Some permit a mourner to eat at a wedding banquet or a circumcision with those who wait upon</italic> [<italic>the guests</italic>], <italic>provided it is not in a place of joyous entertainment, e.g.</italic>, [<italic>where</italic>] <italic>he is in another room</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn1436">32</xref></sup> <italic>and some prohibit</italic> [<italic>this</italic>];<sup><xref rid="fn1437">33</xref></sup> <italic>and thus is the accepted practice, only that the mourner waits upon</italic> [<italic>the guests</italic>] <italic>there, if he so desires, but eats in his house of whatever</italic> [<italic>food</italic>] <italic>they send to him from the</italic> [<italic>wedding</italic>-] <italic>meal.

<ftnote id="fn1405">1) M.K. 22b. V. <italic>infra</italic> par. 3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1406">2) Lit. &#x2018;in his lap.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1407">3) M.K. 26b in accord with dictum of R. Papa on the authority of Ebel Rabbathi. This is one of the three texts cited by Amoraim in the Talmud not found in our texts of Sem. V. Sem(H). pp. 14-15, 230. Amusement (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D7;&#x05D5;&#x05E7;</span>) is not regarded as real joyous entertainment, but is related thereto. Hence, the prohibition applies only for seven days. Cf. Yad, <italic>Ebel</italic> V, 20. <span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D7;&#x05D5;&#x05E7;</span> is the reverse of <span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05DB;&#x05D9;</span> (weeping). V. Koh. III, 4: <italic>&#x2018;A time to weep and a time to laugh.&#x2019;</italic> Therefore, during the seven days, the first three of which are for weeping (M.K. 27a), laughter or amusement is forbidden, but not during the remainder of the thirty days of mourning. Thus <italic>Tur</italic> and <italic>Caro.</italic> <italic>Caro</italic>&#x2019;s text here, however, presents a difficulty. He begins with &#x2018;joyous entertainment&#x2019; and then states &#x2018;therefore he should not etc.,&#x2019; but as explained above, amusement (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D7;&#x05D5;&#x05E7;</span>) is not complete joyous entertainment. The text should therefore, be understood thus, &#x2014; &#x2018;therefore etc.,&#x2019; i.e. since <span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D7;&#x05D5;&#x05E7;</span> is not equivalent to joyous entertainment (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05DE;&#x05D7;&#x05D4;</span>), the prohibition lasts only for seven days &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> During the seven days of mourning a mourner may recite the prayers relating to the sanctification of the New Moon, provided that after the seven days the time limit to recite these prayers will have lapsed. On the <italic>Habdalah</italic> prayer during the seven days of mourning, v. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 376, 3, n. 14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1408">4) M.K. 22b; Y.M.K. III, 8(83d); Sem(H). IX, 15. <italic>Tur</italic> and <italic>Caro</italic> use the term <span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05EA; &#x05D4;&#x05DE;&#x05E9;&#x05EA;&#x05D4;</span> following Sem. In B. and Y. <italic>ibid.</italic> the term <span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05EA; &#x05D4;&#x05E9;&#x05DE;&#x05D7;&#x05D4;</span> (house of joy) is found. Cf. <italic>Tosef.</italic> M.K. II end according to which these two terms connote two different aspects of joyous entertainment. <italic>Tur</italic> and <italic>Caro</italic> use <span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05EA; &#x05D4;&#x05DE;&#x05E9;&#x05EA;&#x05D4;</span> (house of feasting) in a general sense including all types of joyous entertainment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1409">5) Since in the aforementioned texts twelve months are mentioned, not a year. Thus <italic>Asheri</italic> on the authority of <italic>Ra&#x2019;BlaH a.o.</italic> Some texts omit this. V. however, <italic>Nek. Hak.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1410">6) This refers to social gatherings of feasting which take place one day in the home of one person, and the next day in another&#x2019;s home, and so on. Cf. Job. I, 4. This is not regarded as complete joyous entertainment. Moreover, the person is indebted to reciprocate. V. M.K. <italic>ibid., Rashi</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05D0; &#x05D1;&#x05D0;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05E1;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;&#x05D0;</span>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1411">7) M.K. <italic>ibid.</italic> in accord with Amemar&#x2019;s comments on the Baraitha.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1412">8) Thus M.K. <italic>ibid.</italic> in removing contradiction between two Baraithas.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1413">9) Thus <italic>Alfasi; Asheri;</italic> Yad, <italic>Ebel</italic> VI, 7; <italic>T.H.</italic> The reason for this ruling is that the Gemara <italic>ibid.</italic> makes a distinction only with respect to the thirty days of mourning, whence we infer that in the case of one&#x2019;s parent, the prohibition remains in force for twelve months even in the case where the mourner&#x2019;s turn to reciprocate had arrived.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1414">10) This refers to one in mourning for a parent. In the case of other near-of-kin he is permitted even during the thirty days. Thus <italic>Ba&#x1E24;</italic>. <italic>ShaK</italic> makes no such distinction. <italic>Nod&#x2018;ah Bihudah</italic> agrees with <italic>Ba&#x1E24;</italic> &#x2014; <italic>D.Merb., P.Tesh</italic>. For additional sources on <italic>Isserles&#x2019;</italic> ruling, v. Koh. R. IX, 9; <italic>M.V.</italic> Ebel p. 238 (Hor.); M.K. 22b, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v, <span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05DC;&#x05E9;&#x05DE;&#x05D7;&#x05EA;</span>; Yeb. 43b-44a, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D0;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;</span>; Ket. 4a, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D1;&#x05DC; &#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05E4;&#x05DB;&#x05D0; &#x05DC;&#x05D0;</span>; <italic>T.H.; Sem.</italic> of <italic>R.

<ftnote id="fn1416">12) For according to this viewpoint joyous entertainment refers only to a marriage feast where &#x2018;<span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D4;&#x05E9;&#x05DE;&#x05D7;&#x05D4; &#x05D1;&#x05DE;&#x05E2;&#x05D5;&#x05E0;&#x05D5;</span>&#x2019; (&#x2018;the joy is in his dwelling&#x2019;) is recited &#x2014; <italic>N.Yos.</italic></ftnote>

CXIX, 162), they still continue to observe with joy.&#x2019; There are some nowadays who adopt the practice to go and participate in a circumcision feast or any other feast that is connected with a religious duty in accord with the ruling of <italic>Ta</italic>Z, for according to this viewpoint only a feast that has a secular nature is prohibited but not one that has a religious purpose &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 392: A MOURNER IS FORBIDDEN TO TAKE A WIFE DURING THE ENTIRE THIRTY DAYS [OF MOURNING]. Contains six paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. [The mourner] is forbidden to take a wife during the entire thirty days [of mourning],<sup><xref rid="fn1443">1</xref></sup> even without [making] a [wedding-] feast;<sup><xref rid="fn1444">2</xref></sup> and after thirty [days], he is permitted, even [if he is in mourning] for his father and mother,<sup><xref rid="fn1445">3</xref></sup> and he is even [permitted] to make a [wedding-] feast.<sup><xref rid="fn1445">3</xref></sup> However, he is permitted to betroth a wife,<sup><xref rid="fn1446">4</xref></sup> even on the day of death [of his near-of-kin],<sup><xref rid="fn1447">5</xref></sup> provided he does not make a feast [of betrothal], unless thirty days have gone by [at which time a feast is permissible].<sup><xref rid="fn1448">6</xref></sup> <italic>And some say that even betrothal is forbidden the entire thirty days</italic> [<italic>of mourning</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn1449">7</xref></sup> <italic>And thus is the fundamental principle</italic>.</p>
<p>2. If his wife died, he is forbidden to take another [wife] until three Festivals have gone by her [death].<sup><xref rid="fn1450">8</xref></sup> <italic>However, as to entering a house of feasting, the law regarding him is as</italic> [<italic>in the case of</italic>] <italic>other near-of-kin</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1451">9</xref></sup> The New Year and the Day of Atonement are not regarded as Festivals in this respect.<sup><xref rid="fn1452">10</xref></sup> If he has not complied [yet] with the duty of propagation,<sup><xref rid="fn1453">11</xref></sup> or [if] he has small children, or [if] he has no one to attend to him,<sup><xref rid="fn1454">12</xref></sup> he may betroth forthwith and wed [her] after the seven [days of mourning],<sup><xref rid="fn1455">13</xref></sup> but he should not cohabit with her until after thirty days,<sup><xref rid="fn1456">14</xref></sup> unless he has not [yet] complied with the duty of propagation, for [only] then is he permitted to cohabit with her after the seven [days of mourning].<sup><xref rid="fn1457">15</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>The same principle applies to other mourning, even to mourning for one&#x2019;s father and mother</italic>, [<italic>viz., that</italic>] <italic>he is permitted to marry and cohabit with her after the seven</italic> [<italic>days of mourning</italic>], [<italic>only</italic>] <italic>if he has not</italic> [<italic>yet</italic>] <italic>complied with the duty of propagation. Some say that even one who is wealthy and can afford to hire men and women servants</italic> [<italic>to attend to him</italic>], &#x2014; <italic>yet, if his daughter or daughter-in-law are not present with him at his home so that</italic> [<italic>either of them</italic>] <italic>should be able to attend to him</italic>, [<italic>e.g</italic>.,] <italic>in the cleansing of his head or</italic> [<italic>in</italic>] <italic>other</italic> [<italic>private</italic>] <italic>matters, &#x2014; for he feels embarrassed</italic> [<italic>when</italic>] <italic>others</italic> [<italic>do this for him</italic>], &#x2014; [<italic>the law is that</italic>] <italic>he is regarded</italic> [<italic>as one who</italic>] <italic>has no one to attend to him, and</italic> [<italic>the same ruling applies to</italic>] <italic>everything similar to this</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1458">16</xref></sup> <italic>And it is for this reason that the custom has spread that many people adopt a lenient view in</italic> [<italic>this matter, and take wives within</italic> [<italic>the period of</italic>] <italic>three Festivals, but a conscientious person should bethink himself</italic> [<italic>in doing this</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn1459">17</xref></sup> [<italic>In the case of</italic>] <italic>one who was seized by the Governor, and</italic> [<italic>the latter</italic>] <italic>refuses to let him go from his detention until he takes a wife within</italic> [<italic>the period of</italic>] <italic>three Festivals after his</italic> [<italic>former</italic>] <italic>wife&#x2019;s death, some permit</italic> [<italic>him to remarry</italic>] <italic>on account of his suffering</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1460">18</xref></sup> <italic>And thus seems to me to be the fundamental principle</italic>.</p>
<p>3. One who had not [yet] complied with the duty of propagation and had completed negotiations with a woman preliminary to betrothal,<sup><xref rid="fn1461">19</xref></sup> and after he made the wedding preparations, the brother of the woman who was proposed to [by him], died, &#x2014; [the law is that] he is permitted to wed her and to cohabit with her after the seven [days of mourning].<sup><xref rid="fn1462">20</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>Similarly, if he has small children and he agreed</italic> [<italic>to marry</italic>] <italic>his wife&#x2019;s sister, he is permitted to wed her</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1463">21</xref></sup> <italic>for she shows mercy to her sister&#x2019;s children more than another</italic> [<italic>woman</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn1464">22</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1443">1) <italic>Tur</italic> derived from M.K. 23a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1444">2) The same ruling applies prior to the week during which the fast of the ninth of Ab occurs. V. Yeb. 43a-b and O.&#x1E24;. &#x00A7; 551, 2 (Isserles (<italic>ibid.</italic>)rules, however, that it is prohibited to take a wife from the seventeenth of Tammuz until the ninth of Ab incl.). For the marriage proper is considered a joyous occasion. It matters not whether he is a bachelor or a widower, or whether he is marrying a spinster or a widow.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1445">3) Although in all other laws pertaining to mourning, the law of twelve months applies to one in mourning for a parent, in the case of marriage, however, the Rabbis were not stringent and put the law of mourning for a parent on an equal footing with one who mourns the loss of other near-of-kin, who observes mourning rites for thirty days only. Consequently, he may even prepare a feast, despite the fact that he is in mourning for a parent. V. Yeb. 43b, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D0;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;</span>; Ket. 4a, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D1;&#x05DC;</span>; <italic>Asheri</italic> on the authority of <italic>R. Tam;</italic> Sem(H). IX, 14; VIII, 15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1446">4) To become engaged.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1447">5) Yad, <italic>Ebel</italic> VI, 5. Maimonides&#x2019; reason is that M.K. <italic>ibid.</italic> mentions only marriage, but not betrothal. Therefore, since in Yeb. <italic>ibid.</italic> there is a difference of opinion between R. Judah and R. Jose, the latter maintaining that it is forbidden to betroth, &#x2014; yet, since M.K. would harmonize with R. Judah&#x2019;s view, who permits betrothal, this is the law &#x2014; <italic>Le&#x1E25;. Mish.</italic> Furthermore, just as we find that on the fast day of the ninth of Ab, one may betroth lest another man get ahead of him in proposing to the woman he desires to marry (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05DE;&#x05D0; &#x05D9;&#x05E7;&#x05D3;&#x05DE;&#x05E0;&#x05D5; &#x05D0;&#x05D7;&#x05E8;</span>), the same applies according to Maim. to mourning rites. However, most of the authorities dispute this ruling of <italic>Maim</italic>., for they hold that the law is in accord with R. Jose (Yeb. <italic>ibid</italic>.), and this law cannot be derived from the ninth of Ab, since in the latter case it is considered &#x2018;an ancient mourning&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05DC;&#x05D5;&#x05EA; &#x05D9;&#x05E9;&#x05E0;&#x05D4;</span>). Accordingly, the reason M.K. <italic>ibid.</italic> mentions only marriage, is primarily for the sake of introducing a remarkable feature, viz., marriage during mourning, but this does not exclude betrothal from the same ruling. <italic>Isserles</italic>, therefore, rules (v. anon) that even betrothal is forbidden for the entire thirty days.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1448">6) V. <italic>Kes. Mish.</italic> to Yad, <italic>ibid.</italic> and <italic>B.Yos.</italic> a.l.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1449">7) <italic>Tur, Asheri</italic> and <italic>N</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> Cf. n. 5 <italic>supra.</italic> Negotiations preliminary to betrothal (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D9;&#x05D3;&#x05D5;&#x05DB;&#x05D9;&#x05DF;</span>) are permitted even on the day of death (<italic>Ba&#x1E24;</italic>), provided no feast is made &#x2014; <italic>ShaK, A.H.</italic> Cf. <italic>Sh.M.B.</italic> IV, p. 309-10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1450">8) M.K. 23a in accord with the First Tanna; Sem(H). VII, 15. Thus also Yad, <italic>Ebel</italic> VI, 5 cited by <italic>Tur, contra</italic> second opinion stated by R. Judah (M.K. <italic>ibid.</italic>) that the prohibition extends only until the second Festival, but before the third he is permitted. <italic>Tosaf. ibid.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05E2;&#x05E8;</span> state on the authority of <italic>R. Jonah</italic> that R. Judah&#x2019;s opinion cannot be accepted on the principle that in all matters pertaining to mourning the law is in accord with the lenient authority (this is in fact the ruling of <italic>Ghayyat, N</italic> and <italic>Asheri</italic> that we we must accept R. Judah&#x2019;s view since he represents the lenient opinion), for in the case of remarriage after his former wife&#x2019;s death, the days of mourning (i.e., the thirty days) have already gone by and the reason for the requirement of three Festivals has no bearing upon mourning rites. <italic>Tosaf. ibid.</italic> advances various reasons why the husband must wait until three Festivals have passed prior to remarriage, &#x2014; a) that by waiting for three Festivals to pass without the joy of marital life, he will not forget his former wife&#x2019;s love and consequently, he will be inspired to remarry; b) to give the husband a chance to forget his former wife&#x2019;s love, so that when he remarries, he will not mention his former wife&#x2019;s love and devotion to his second wife, and thereby will avoid domestic friction. The law of three Festivals applies whether his former wife was at the time of marriage a spinster or a widow, or whether it was his first or second marriage. Likewise, whether his former wife was healthy or sick, or whether he lived peacefully or had disputes with her &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> The lenient view of R. Judah that two Festivals suffice, may be relied upon in a case of emergency &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> In the case where her husband died, she mourns only for thirty days, but she is forbidden to become engaged or to remarry before three months go by, in order to determine whether she is with child by her former husband or not (v. E.H. &#x00A7; 13). <italic>Mord.</italic> states that the reason why a woman does not have to wait until three Festivals have gone by before remarriage, is that she is satisfied to lead a married life than to remain single (v. Kid. 7a), and consequently, she is more apt to forget her former husband after thirty days of mourning and to devote herself to her new partner. If it happened that he married her within her thirty days of mourning for other near-of-kin, she should not cohabit with him before the thirty days of mourning are over. Thus opinion of <italic>Maim.</italic> (Yad, <italic>ibid</italic>), in accord with <italic>Ba&#x1E24;&#x2019;s</italic> interpretation &#x2014; <italic>Ta</italic>Z, <italic>ShaK</italic>. <italic>Shemini A&#x1E93;ereth</italic> is considered an independent Festival with respect to the waiting period of three Festivals &#x2014; <italic>D.Merb. R.A.Eger</italic>, however, disagrees with the latter. One whose wife died on <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic> of the Passover Festival, and he wishes to remarry on the twentieth of Adar II, i.e., after twelve months will have gone by, the law is that although three Festivals will not have elapsed, he is nevertheless, permitted &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1451">9) <italic>Tur</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> V. Yeb. 43b, <italic>Tosaf.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05D0;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;</span>.

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 393: WHEN MAY THE MOURNER LEAVE HIS HOUSE? Contains four paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. A mourner does not go out during the first three days [of mourning] to a house of mourning nor to a cemetery [to attend a funeral];<sup><xref rid="fn1465">1</xref></sup> thereafter, if others suffered a bereavement in his neighbourhood, he goes out after the bier to the cemetery,<sup><xref rid="fn1466">2</xref></sup> but does not sit among the comforters, but [rather] among those who are to be comforted.<sup><xref rid="fn1467">3</xref></sup> However, if there are not enough [people] there [to carry the bier] and to attend to its burial, he may leave [his house], even on the first day, and even [if this takes place] in another neighbourhood.<sup><xref rid="fn1468">4</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>And part of the third is regarded as a complete day</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn1469">5</xref></sup> <italic>but I have not seen this custom practiced now, for the mourner does not go to the cemetery nor to a house of mourning for the entire seven days</italic> [<italic>of mourning</italic>], <italic>and perhaps this</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1470">6</xref></sup> <italic>is not obligatory but is only optional, and</italic> [<italic>furthermore</italic>,] <italic>since one is not comforted now as</italic> [<italic>was the practice</italic>] <italic>in their days</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1471">7</xref></sup> [<italic>consequently</italic>], <italic>&#x2018;Sit and do nothing&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1472">8</xref></sup> <italic>is better</italic>.</p>
<p>2. A mourner during the first week [of mourning] does not leave the door of his house,<sup><xref rid="fn1473">9</xref></sup> even to hear the benedictions of the marriage ceremony or the benedictions of the circumcision ceremony.<sup><xref rid="fn1474">10</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>But one who adopts a lenient view</italic>, [<italic>viz</italic>.,] <italic>to go out at night</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1475">11</xref></sup> <italic>because of necessity, loses nothing;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1476">12</xref></sup> <italic>and as to the fact that he is forbidden to leave his house, it applies only to walking about</italic> [<italic>at leisure</italic>], <italic>or to engage in business or the like, but if a ruler summoned him</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1477">13</xref></sup> <italic>or where he must go on the road, or for other pressing matters that require him, e.g., a matter</italic> [<italic>which, if postponed</italic>] <italic>will entail an irretrievable loss, he is permitted to go out</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1478">14</xref></sup> <italic>And thus is the accepted custom. As to the law with respect to wearing shoes, v. supra</italic> &#x00A7; 382.<sup><xref rid="fn1479">15</xref></sup> The second week [of mourning] he goes out but does not sit in his [customary] place [in the Synagogue],<sup><xref rid="fn1473">9</xref></sup> nor does he engage in conversation. The third week [of mourning] he may sit in his place but does not engage in conversation.<sup><xref rid="fn1473">9</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>However, if he desires not to sit in his</italic> [<italic>customary</italic>] <italic>place during the third week</italic> [<italic>of mourning</italic>], <italic>but</italic> [<italic>he desires</italic>] <italic>to engage in conversation, he has the right to do so</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1480">16</xref></sup> <italic>And now the accepted practice is that one does not sit in one&#x2019;s</italic> [<italic>customary</italic>] <italic>place</italic> [<italic>in the Synagogue</italic>] <italic>for the entire thirty days</italic> [<italic>of mourning</italic>], <italic>and</italic> [<italic>one in mourning</italic>] <italic>for his father and mother, &#x2014; for the entire twelve months</italic> [<italic>of mourning</italic>]. <italic>However, this custom has no fundamental basis. Yet, one should not change from the accepted practice</italic>, &#x2014; <italic>for every locality</italic> [<italic>should act</italic>] <italic>in accordance with its adopted custom</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1481">17</xref></sup> The fourth week [of mourning] he is like any other person,<sup><xref rid="fn1473">9</xref></sup> even if the first three weeks [of mourning] were not complete, e.g., [in a case] where the person died in the middle of the week, &#x2014; [the law is that] as soon as that week and two [more] weeks following it, ended, the next week is considered the fourth.<sup><xref rid="fn1482">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. The mourner does not go out on a weekday to the Synagogue, but on the Sabbath he may go out,<sup><xref rid="fn1483">19</xref></sup> <italic>and thus also to the House of Study</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1484">20</xref></sup> &#x2014; and we adopt the practice that on every day [of the week] when the Torah is read, he goes to the Synagogue. <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>However, in these countries, it is the accepted practice that he goes out</italic> [<italic>to the Synagogue</italic>] <italic>only on the Sabbath</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1485">21</xref></sup> <italic>If the mourner is a Mohel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1486">22</xref></sup> <italic>or a Sandek</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1486">22</xref></sup> &#x2014; [<italic>if</italic>] <italic>after three</italic> [<italic>days of mourning have passed, &#x2014; the law is that</italic>] <italic>he should</italic> [<italic>still</italic>] <italic>recite his prayers at home, and when the infant is brought</italic> [<italic>to the Synagogue</italic>] <italic>to be circumcised, the mourner may</italic> [<italic>then</italic>] <italic>go to the Synagogue;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1487">23</xref></sup> <italic>but within the three</italic> [<italic>days of mourning</italic>], <italic>he should not go, unless there is no other Mohel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1486">22</xref></sup> [<italic>available</italic>] <italic>in the city</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1488">24</xref></sup> <italic>Some adopt a lenient view even during the three</italic> [<italic>days of mourning</italic>], <italic>even if there is another Mohel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1486">22</xref></sup> [<italic>available</italic>] <italic>in the city</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1489">25</xref></sup> <italic>He is permitted to prepare his nails and to cut</italic> [<italic>them</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn1490">26</xref></sup> [<italic>a matter which is</italic>] <italic>required</italic> [<italic>to be done</italic>] <italic>on account of the circumsicion, but if there is another Mohel</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1486">22</xref></sup> [<italic>available</italic>], <italic>it is forbidden</italic> [<italic>to do this</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn1491">27</xref></sup> <italic>Likewise</italic>, [<italic>in the case of</italic>] <italic>every matter connected with a religious duty that cannot be performed without the mourner, he is permitted to go out in order to perform the religious duty</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1492">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. Those who adopt the practice when they are mourners not to change their [customary] place in the Synagogue on the Sabbath, are correct in doing so.<sup><xref rid="fn1493">29</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>Some say that on the Sabbath he should also change his</italic> [<italic>customary</italic>] <italic>place</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1494">30</xref></sup> <italic>and thus is the common practice, and one should not alter</italic> [<italic>this</italic>] <italic>custom</italic>.</p>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 394: ONE MUST NOT GRIEVE EXCESSIVELY FOR THE DEAD. Contains six paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. One should not grieve excessively for the dead, and whosoever grieves excessively for him, will weep for another [dead]<sup><xref rid="fn1495">1</xref></sup> save that three days [are designated] for weeping, seven for lamenting, thirty [to abstain from] cutting the hair and wearing laundried garments.<sup><xref rid="fn1496">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. This applies to the rest of the people, but [as to] scholars [who died], everything is according to their wisdom;<sup><xref rid="fn1497">3</xref></sup> and one does not weep for them more than thirty days,<sup><xref rid="fn1498">4</xref></sup> nor does one make a lamentation for them more than twelve months,<sup><xref rid="fn1499">5</xref></sup> and likewise, a Sage whose [death] report was received after twelve months, is not lamented.<sup><xref rid="fn1500">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. One may go out to the cemetery and visit the dead until three days [after being placed in the sepulchral chamber], for perhaps he is still alive.<sup><xref rid="fn1501">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. During the first three days [of mourning], the mourner should look upon himself as if a sword is resting between his shoulders; from the third to the seventh, as if it is standing in the corner facing him; from the seventh to the thirtieth, as if it is passing before him in the market place; and throughout the entire year, the judgment is aimed against that family. But if a male child is born in that family, the entire family becomes healed.<sup><xref rid="fn1502">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. When one [member] of a company dies, the whole company should feel troubled.<sup><xref rid="fn1503">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. Whosoever does not observe mourning rites as the Sages commanded is a cruel person, but one should fear and be troubled and investigate his conduct and repent.<sup><xref rid="fn1504">10</xref></sup></p>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 395: A PART OF THE SEVENTH AND THE THIRTIETH DAYS IS REGARDED AS THE WHOLE DAY. Contains three paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. As soon as the comforters have risen [to leave] from the presence of the mourner on the seventh day, he<sup><xref rid="fn1505">1</xref></sup> is permitted [to do] everything that he was forbidden during the seven [days of mourning], for part of the [seventh] day [is regarded] as the whole day,<sup><xref rid="fn1506">2</xref></sup> [and furthermore, there is] no difference whether it is part of the seventh day or part of the thirtieth day [of mourning],<sup><xref rid="fn1507">3</xref></sup> for as soon as the sun has risen on the thirtieth day, the restrictions of the thiry [days] cease to exist for him.<sup><xref rid="fn1508">4</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>And in these countries where it is not customary for the comforters to come on the seventh day, one is required to wait until the hour when it is customary for the comforters to come on other days, viz., after the departure</italic> [<italic>of the worshippers</italic>] <italic>from the Synagogue</italic>, [<italic>at which time</italic>] <italic>it is customary for comforters to come. Thus seems to me</italic> [<italic>to be the correct view</italic>], <italic>and not as the common practice is to wait an hour after the day</italic> [<italic>has commenced</italic>], <italic>for the matter depends solely upon the comforters rising</italic> [<italic>to depart</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn1509">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. One who heard [a death report of] distant tidings<sup><xref rid="fn1510">6</xref></sup> at night, &#x2014; since one hour [of mourning] is sufficient [in such a case], it is accounted as valid even [if observed] at night.<sup><xref rid="fn1511">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. One whose father or mother died on the first day of the month of <italic>Nisan</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1512">8</xref></sup> &#x2014; [the law is that] we do not say on the twenty-ninth day of <italic>Adar</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1512">8</xref></sup> following, &#x2018;A part of the day [is regarded] as the whole day,&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1513">9</xref></sup> but one must observe those things that are prohibited during the twelve months [of mourning] until the first day of the month of <italic>Nisan</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1512">8</xref></sup> arrives.<sup><xref rid="fn1514">10</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>It is also customary to include the day wherein</italic> [<italic>one&#x2019;s</italic>] <italic>father or mother died</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1515">11</xref></sup> [<italic>viz.</italic>,] <italic>to treat it</italic> [<italic>in accordance with</italic>] <italic>the law of the twelve months&#x2019;</italic> [<italic>period of mourning</italic>] <italic>and this is the proper</italic> [<italic>usage</italic>].</p>

However, in matters pertaining to the performance of a religiuos duty, e.g., Torah-study, marital intercourse we adopt the lenient view and consider part of the night of the seventh day as equivalent to the entire seventh day; in matters where no religious duty is involved, e.g., bathing, anointing etc. we rule that part of the seventh day following the night, is regarded as the whole day &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 396: THE LAW REGARDING A MOURNER WHO DID NOT OBSERVE MOURNING RITES THROUGHOUT THE SEVEN DAYS. Contains three paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. A mourner who did not observe his mourning rites during the seven [days of mourning], whether inadvertently or wilfully,<sup><xref rid="fn1516">1</xref></sup> may make up for it<sup><xref rid="fn1517">2</xref></sup> during the entire thirty [days of mourning] save for the rending of garments<sup><xref rid="fn1518">3</xref></sup> [concerning which the law is] that if he did not rend garments at the moment of excitement,<sup><xref rid="fn1519">4</xref></sup> he may rend only during the seven days [of mourning] save [in the case of] his father or mother [the law is] that he may rend even after the seven days [of mourning].<sup><xref rid="fn1520">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. This<sup><xref rid="fn1521">6</xref></sup> applies only if he did not observe mourning rites at all for the entire seven [days of mourning], but if he was neglectful in [the observance of] some days during which he did not observe mourning rites, e.g., one who was informed on the first day that he suffered a bereavement, and [at the time this was reported to him] he was in another town and did not observe mourning rites,<sup><xref rid="fn1522">7</xref></sup> and on the second day he arrived in his own town and observed mourning rites, &#x2014; [the law is that] he is not required to complete [the days of mourning that he missed], but counts the seven days from the first day.<sup><xref rid="fn1523">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. A minor<sup><xref rid="fn1524">9</xref></sup> whose father or/and mother died, even if he became of age within the seven [days of mourning], &#x2014; the entire law of mourning lapses from him<sup><xref rid="fn1525">10</xref></sup> and he is not obligated therein.<sup><xref rid="fn1526">11</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1516">1) Or in the case of an unavoidable interference through no fault of his own &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1517">2) Lit. &#x2018;complete.&#x2019; I.e., the mourning rites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1518">3) V. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 340, 18.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1519">4) Immediately after death.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1520">5) <italic>Tur</italic> on the authority of <italic>RaBaD</italic>, derived from M.K. 20a where it is stated that if one <italic>observed</italic> the rite of overturning the couch three days prior to a Festival, he is not required to overturn it any more after the Festival. Since it states (M.K. <italic>ibid.</italic>) &#x2018;if one <italic>observed&#x2019;</italic> and it does not say, &#x2018;one who <italic>buried</italic> his dead three days prior to the Festival,&#x2019; <italic>RaBaD</italic> infers that only if the mourner <italic>observed</italic> mourning rites before the Festival is the mourning period interrupted by the intervening Festival, but not otherwise. Consequently, the mourning rites must be observed after the Festival. However, this excludes rending of garments which must be done immediately after death from the moment of excitement&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05E2;&#x05EA; &#x05D7;&#x05D9;&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05DD;</span>), and the entire seven days are considered a &#x2018;moment of excitement.&#x2019; Hence, the ruling here. Thus also <italic>Asheri</italic> and <italic>N</italic> in <italic>T.H.</italic> One who was ill or was not in a normal state of mind at the time his near-of-kin died and consequently, did not rend garments, should rend his garments when he becomes well again, even during the entire thirty days, for when he ultimately becomes aware of his loss, it is considered for him a moment of excitement &#x2014; <italic>ShaK, Ba&#x1E24;</italic> and <italic>A.H.</italic> V. <italic>Ba&#x2019;er Heteb</italic> and <italic>Na&#x1E25;. &#x1E92;ebi.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1522">7) The same applies even if he were in the same town &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1523">8) <italic>Tur</italic> citing <italic>Asheri Resp.</italic> If one was informed that he suffered a bereavement and then commenced mourning rites, after which this report was denied, and consequently, he discontinued the observance of mourning rites, but then he was again informed that the original death report was correct, the law is that although on account of the denial he neglected the observance of mourning during some of the seven days, nevertheless, the days missed are counted in the seven days of mourning. Likewise, if one received a report that his father died and a relative of his informed him that the death report was incorrect and after two days elapsed the relative informed him that the original report was correct, the law is that the mourner counts from the time he received the first death report &#x2014; <italic>P.Tesh.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1524">9) Mourning does not obtain in the case of a minor. V. M.K. 14b and cf.

<ftnote id="fn1525">10) On this question there is a difference of opinion between <italic>R. Meir of Rothenberg</italic> and his disciple <italic>Asheri.</italic> According to the former mourning does not obtain in the case of a minor, but he must count the seven and thirty days of mourning and thus observe mourning rites from the moment he becomes of age. The latter, however, exempts him even when he becomes of age (thus ruling of <italic>Caro</italic> here), since mourning did not apply to him at the time of burial. This is not to be compared to a Festival, in which case mourning is postponed until after the Festival (v. <italic>infra</italic> &#x00A7; 399), for in the latter case the individual proper was obligated to observe mourning rites, only that the Festival interrupts this. Moreover, on a Festival private mourning is still observed. Nor is this case be compared to the law of <italic>Habdalah</italic> with respect to a mourner (v. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 341, 23 and notes), for the <italic>Habdalah</italic> prayer may be recited during the first three days of the week (v. <italic>ibid</italic>.), whereas mourning rites take effect from the moment the tomb is closed by the <italic>Golel</italic>, and since at that moment the minor was exempt, mourning no longer takes effect. V. <italic>Ta</italic>Z for lengthy discussion on this ruling who finally agrees with <italic>Caro.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1526">11) The twelve month period, however, should be observed by the minor who became of age after burial, since this is done out of deference to one&#x2019;s parents and is considered an independent mourning rite not connected with the seven and thirty days of mourning. Consequently, it does not depend upon the closing of the tomb by the <italic>Golel</italic> &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> As to rending of garments in the case of a minor, v. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 340, 27.</ftnote>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 397: LAWS CONCERNING THE OBSERVANCE OF MOURNING RITES ON THE TESTIMONY OF WITNESSES. Contains two paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. One observes mourning rites on the testimony of a single witness or [on the testimony of] a witness testifying to what he has heard from an [eye-] witness or if a Gentile makes an incidental statement [regarding] one&#x2019;s death.<sup><xref rid="fn1527">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. [If] two [witnesses] say, &#x2018;He died,&#x2019; and two [other witnesses say, &#x2018;He did not die,&#x2019; the [near-of-kin] does not observe mourning rites.<sup><xref rid="fn1528">2</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1527">1) <italic>Tur</italic> citing <italic>T.H.</italic>, for the general principle is that any type of evidence on which we grant a woman permission to remarry, mourning rites are also observed (E.H. &#x00A7; 17, 3; <italic>Asheri</italic> M.K. III). V. Pes. 4a; M.K. 20b; San. 5a on the question of mourning rites observed on the evidence of a single witness. Furthermore, the principle is that in &#x2018;any matter which eventually will be exposed people do not lie&#x2019; (v. R.H. 22b; Yeb. 93b). Although we compare mourning to the laws of evidence on which a woman is permitted to remarry, we may ask the following: In the case of a woman there is an additional reason (excluding the reason of evidence) for granting her permission to remarry, viz., &#x2018;A woman is careful to make inquiries prior to remarriage&#x2019; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05E7;&#x05D0; &#x05D5;&#x05DE;&#x05E0;&#x05E1;&#x05D1;&#x05D0;</span>) (Yeb. 116b), which is not so in the case of mourning. How can we therefore, compare the two cases? There are, therefore, some authorities who hold that the permission granted the woman is based mainly on the evidence of the single witness. It may, however, be possible that in the case of the woman we adopt a stringent view and require both the principle of evidence plus the fact that she also makes her own inquiries, whereas in the case of mourning a lenient view is adopted and the principle of evidence alone suffices &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> (Evidence offered in writing is also accepted in the case of permitting a woman to remarry. V. E.H. <italic>ibid</italic>). One who received a letter informing him that his near-of-kin died, and in the letter it is not stated whether it is still within or after the thirty days of mourning, the law is that if the sender is not a learned person, we presume that the deceased person was alive until the time that the letter was written and dispatched (for an exposition of this type of presumption v. <italic>A.H.</italic> a.l.). Hence, the receiver of the letter must observe mourning rites. But if the sender was a learned person, we presume that the thirty day period is over, for were it possible for the letter to reach the mourner within the thirty days of mourning, the sender would not have stated the death report without defining the matter &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> But if the deceased person was his father or mother, since the adopted custom is to inform the mourner about the death of a parent forthwith, in any case, the mourner is required to observe mourning rites &#x2014; <italic>Birke Yos.</italic> If it happened that in a doubtful case it was ruled for one not to observe mourning, and subsequetly it became known to the individual that originally when the doubt was entertained regarding the death of his near-of-kin, the latter had really died, and it was still at the time the doubt was entertained within the thirty days, the law is that the mourner does not have to observe mourning rites (thus corrected text of <italic>ShaK</italic> in <italic>Nek. Hak.</italic>) V. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 396 beg. (the reason being that now since it is already after the thirty days, mourning does not obtain) &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> One who receives a death report via telegram should observe mourning rites &#x2014; <italic>Sh.M.B.</italic> If a Gentile offers formal testimony (not incidentally), it is not accepted &#x2014; <italic>Mord.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1528">2) For in a doubtful case we adopt the lenient view and presume that he is still alive. V. Sot. 31a, 47b and cf. Bek. 49a. In the case of one reported to be in a dying condition, v. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 399, 2.</ftnote>

<p>1. [With respect to the observance of] mourning rites on the first day, &#x2014; [the law is that] if it is the day of death and burial, it is regarded as Biblical and the remaining days [of mourning] are Rabbinical.<sup><xref rid="fn1529">1</xref></sup> This applies only to the seven dead [near-of-kin] explicitly mentioned in the Bible for whom a <italic>Kohen</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1530">2</xref></sup> may defile himself;<sup><xref rid="fn1531">3</xref></sup> but those dead [near-of-kin] which were added to them [by Rabbinical exposition]<sup><xref rid="fn1532">4</xref></sup> as stated in &#x00A7; 374, &#x2014; even on the first day are regarded as Rabbinical [regarding the observance of mourning rites]. However, some say that even mourning on the first day [which is both the day] of death and burial is regarded as Rabbinical in all cases of dead [near-of-kin].<sup><xref rid="fn1533">5</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1529">1) The following authorities differ with respect to mourning on the first day: a) The <italic>Geonim, Maim.</italic> (Yad, <italic>Ebel</italic> I, 1), <italic>Alfasi</italic> (Ber. II; M.K. III), <italic>RaShBA</italic>, hold that the first day of mourning is Biblical, provided the burial is held on the same day as death, and the remaining days are Rabbinical. b) <italic>RaBaD</italic> adds to a) the thirty days forbidden to wear laundried garments and the prohibition against hair-cutting, as Biblical. <italic>T.H.</italic> rejects this. c) <italic>RI</italic> and <italic>R.

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 399: THE LAWS OF MOURNING ON A FESTIVAL, THE NEW YEAR AND THE SECOND FESTIVAL DAY OBSERVED BY THOSE LIVING ABROAD. Contains fourteen paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. One who buries his dead before a Festival in a case where mourning takes effect upon him, and he observed [mourning rites] accordingly even one hour<sup><xref rid="fn1534">1</xref></sup> prior to the [advent of] the Festival, &#x2014; [the law is that] the Festival interrupts the mourning and annuls for him the restrictions of the seven [days of mourning],<sup><xref rid="fn1535">2</xref></sup> and the Festival days are included for him in the counting of the thirty [days of mourning]; hence, there are seven [days] before the Festival<sup><xref rid="fn1536">3</xref></sup> and [in addition] the days of the Festival [proper], after which he completes the thirty [days].<sup><xref rid="fn1537">4</xref></sup> This rule applies provided that he observed mourning rites at that moment,<sup><xref rid="fn1538">5</xref></sup> even if he observed only matters pertaining to private [mourning],<sup><xref rid="fn1539">6</xref></sup> e.g., [even if] he received near tidings on the Sabbath day which fell on the eve of the Festival, &#x2014; [the law is that] although he observes [on the Sabbath] only matters pertaining to private mourning,<sup><xref rid="fn1540">7</xref></sup> the Festival interrupts [the seven and thirty days of mourning]. However, if inadvertently <italic>or</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1541">8</xref></sup> wilfully he did not observe mourning [prior to the Festival], or it was close to nightfall, and [consequently], he was not able to observe [mourning rites], the Festival does not interrupt the mourning. And much more so if he was unaware of the person&#x2019;s death prior to the Festival, &#x2014; [the law is] that the Festival does not interrupt [the mourning rites]<sup><xref rid="fn1542">9</xref></sup> save that he observes during the Festival matters pertaining to private [mourning]<sup><xref rid="fn1543">10</xref></sup> and [begins to] count the seven days [of mourning] after the Festival,<sup><xref rid="fn1544">11</xref></sup> and during those seven days his work is done [for him] by others,<sup><xref rid="fn1545">12</xref></sup> and his male and female servants do [work] privately indoors,<sup><xref rid="fn1546">13</xref></sup> for since he has already been suspended from work during the seven days of the Festival, although he was not suspended [from work] on account of the mourning, but [rather] because of the Festival, &#x2014; yet, after all, [the fact is that] he [automatically] observed the law [similar to that] of mourning with respect to work [during mourning], &#x2014; hence, we do not adopt any stringency in this matter<sup><xref rid="fn1547">14</xref></sup> as in the case of other mourning, and his work may be done [for him] by others; and throughout the Festival days the public busies itself with him to offer him comfort;<sup><xref rid="fn1548">15</xref></sup> hence, they do not busy themselves with him to offer him comfort after the Festival.<sup><xref rid="fn1549">16</xref></sup> However, the Festival enters into the counting of the thirty [days],<sup><xref rid="fn1550">17</xref></sup> for the law of thirty, viz., [with respect to the prohibition against] laundry work and hair-cutting, applies to the Festival [as well], and not only on account of the legal status of the Festival is he forbidden [to do] those things, but also because of the law of mourning,<sup><xref rid="fn1551">18</xref></sup> &#x2014; for as far as the legal status of the Festival is concerned, he is permitted to put on new white laundried garments and he may cut his nails with a scissors [on <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn1552">19</xref></sup> and may rejoice at social gatherings,<sup><xref rid="fn1553">20</xref></sup> and [likewise] one arriving from beyond the sea or coming out of captivity and the others whom the Sages enumerated and permitted to cut the hair and to wash garments [on <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn1552">19</xref></sup> but with respect to the law of mourning one is prohibited against doing all these things as on a weekday.</p>
<p>2. One who buries his dead during the Festival on <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1552">19</xref></sup> observes the law of <italic>Aninuth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1552">19</xref></sup> so long as the [corpse] is not buried;<sup><xref rid="fn1554">21</xref></sup> and after it is buried he observes matters pertaining to private [mourning],<sup><xref rid="fn1555">22</xref></sup>, &#x2014; <italic>nevertheless, he is permitted to be alone with his wife</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1556">23</xref></sup> &#x2014; and the Festival is counted in the number of the thirty [days of mourning], after which he completes the thirty.<sup><xref rid="fn1555">22</xref></sup> Even if he buried him on the Festival of <italic>Sukkoth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1552">19</xref></sup> we do not say that <italic>Shemini A&#x1E93;ereth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1552">19</xref></sup> annuls [the thirty days];<sup><xref rid="fn1557">24</xref></sup> and one may busy himself during the Festival to offer him comfort.<sup><xref rid="fn1558">25</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>And all work which is permitted to be done for him during &#x1E25;ol ha-Moed</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1552">19</xref></sup> [<italic>viz</italic>.,] <italic>a matter, the postponement of which, entails an irretrievable loss</italic>, &#x2014; <italic>he</italic> [<italic>the mourner</italic>] <italic>is permitted to do himself; and if it is a matter, the postponement of which, does not entail an irretrievable loss, it may be done by others in their homes. However, his male and female servants may do</italic> [<italic>this type of work</italic>] <italic>privately in his house</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1559">26</xref></sup> And after the Festival he begins to count the seven [days];<sup><xref rid="fn1560">27</xref></sup> and when the seven days after the person&#x2019;s death are over,&#x2014; although the seven days of mourning are still not over, &#x2014; his work may be done by others<sup><xref rid="fn1561">28</xref></sup> in their homes,<sup><xref rid="fn1562">29</xref></sup> and his servants may do [his work] for him privately in his home, and the public does not busy itself to offer him comfort after the Festival [for a period of days corresponding to] the number of days that they offered him comfort during the Festival, but they may visit him,<sup><xref rid="fn1563">30</xref></sup> e.g., if he buried him during [any of] the three latter days of a Festival his work may be done by others during the three latter days of mourning. However, in localities where they make two Festival days, he counts the seven [days beginning with] the second and final day of the Holiday,<sup><xref rid="fn1564">31</xref></sup> [for] since it is only Rabbinical, it is counted in the number [of the seven days] and he counts thereafter only six [more] days.</p>
<p>3. If he buried his dead seven days before the Festival during which he observed the [mourning] restrictions of the seven [days], &#x2014; the [advent of the] Festival annuls for him the [mourning] restrictions of the thirty [days],<sup><xref rid="fn1565">32</xref></sup> even if the seventh day fell on the eve of the Festival, &#x2014; for part of the day is regarded as the entire day, [and the seventh day] enters into the counting here<sup><xref rid="fn1566">33</xref></sup> and there;<sup><xref rid="fn1567">34</xref></sup> and he is permitted to wash garments, bathe and cut his hair<sup><xref rid="fn1568">35</xref></sup> on the eve of the Festival,<sup><xref rid="fn1569">36</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>close to nightfall</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1570">37</xref></sup> <italic>And on the eve of Passover he is permitted</italic> [<italic>to do</italic>] <italic>everything</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1571">38</xref></sup> <italic>after mid-day, i.e., from the time the Passover sacrifice is slaughtered and onward.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1572">39</xref></sup> <italic>It is, however, preferable that he cut his hair before midday, since other people are forbidden to cut hair after midday.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1573">40</xref></sup> Likewise, if the eighth [day] fell on a Sabbath which occurred on the eve of the Festival, he is permitted to wash garments, bathe and cut his hair on the eve of the Sabbath,<sup><xref rid="fn1574">41</xref></sup> and [even] if he did not cut his hair on the eve of the Holiday, or on the eve of the Sabbath, he is permitted to cut his hair after the Festival, &#x2014; for the restrictions of the thirty [days] have already been annulled for him. However, on <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1552">19</xref></sup> he should not cut his hair, since it was possible for him to cut his hair before the Festival. If his seventh day fell on the Sabbath [which occurred] on the eve of the Festival, he is forbidden to cut his hair on the eve of the Sabbath,<sup><xref rid="fn1575">42</xref></sup> but he is permitted to cut his hair after the Festival,<sup><xref rid="fn1576">43</xref></sup> and likewise, on <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1552">19</xref></sup> since he was unable to cut his hair before the Festival.<sup><xref rid="fn1577">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. As [to the law] that an [intervening] Festival annuls the restrictions of thirty, &#x2014; [it applies] to other dead; but in [the case of one in mourning for] his father and/or mother who is forbidden <italic>to cut his hair</italic> until his friends rebuke him, &#x2014; [the law is that] even if the Festival occurred after thirty days, it does not annul [this prohibition].<sup><xref rid="fn1578">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. If one of the days of mourning<sup><xref rid="fn1579">46</xref></sup>, excluding the seventh day,<sup><xref rid="fn1580">47</xref></sup> fell on the eve of the Festival,<sup><xref rid="fn1581">48</xref></sup> he is permitted to wash his garment,<sup><xref rid="fn1582">49</xref></sup> but must not put it on until night [arrives]; and it is better to be careful not to wash garments until after midday, so that it should be known that he washes his garments on account of the Festival;<sup><xref rid="fn1583">50</xref></sup> but to bathe<sup><xref rid="fn1584">51</xref></sup> is forbidden until night [arrives].<sup><xref rid="fn1585">52</xref></sup> Some permit bathing after the <italic>Min&#x1E25;a</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1552">19</xref></sup> service,<sup><xref rid="fn1586">53</xref></sup> close to nightfall, <italic>and this is the accepted custom.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1587">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. The New Year and the Dav of Atonement are regarded as Festivals [with respect] to annulling the mourning rites.<sup><xref rid="fn1588">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. [If] he observed one hour<sup><xref rid="fn1589">56</xref></sup> [of mourning rites] prior to the Passover [Festival], &#x2014; that hour is regarded as seven [days of mourning] and [with] the eight days of Passover, we have fifteen [days], and [then] he completes [the thirty days] by adding fifteen more [days after Passover].<sup><xref rid="fn1590">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. [If he observed] one hour<sup><xref rid="fn1589">56</xref></sup> [of mourning] prior to the Feast of Weeks, it is regarded as seven [days] and [as to the first day of] the Feast of Weeks, since [the law is] that if one did not offer the [prescribed] offerings of the Feast of Weeks on the Feast of Weeks he has a supplementary period of full seven [days], &#x2014; it is regarded as seven days. Hence, we have fourteen [days], and he completes [the thirty days] by adding fifteen more [days after the Festival]<sup><xref rid="fn1591">58</xref></sup>, and the second day of the Feast of Weeks enters into the counting of the fifteen [days].<sup><xref rid="fn1592">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. [If he observed] one hour<sup><xref rid="fn1589">56</xref></sup> [of mourning] prior to the New Year, the restrictions of the seven [days] are annulled for him on account of the [advent of] the New Year,<sup><xref rid="fn1593">60</xref></sup> and the Day of Atonement annuls for him the restrictions of the thirty [days]; and he may cut his hair on the eve of the Day of Atonement.<sup><xref rid="fn1594">61</xref></sup> Likewise, with respect to one who buries his dead on the third [day] of <italic>Tishri</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1552">19</xref></sup> &#x2014; [the law is] that he may cut his hair on the eve of the Day of Atonement.<sup><xref rid="fn1594">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. [If he observed] one hour<sup><xref rid="fn1589">56</xref></sup> [of mourning] prior to the Day of Atonement, the restrictions of the seven [days] are annulled for him on account of the Day of Atonement, and the Feast [of Tabernacles] annuls for him the restrictions of the thirty [days], and he may cut his hair on the eve of the Feast [of Tabernacles].<sup><xref rid="fn1595">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>11. [If he observed] one hour<sup><xref rid="fn1589">56</xref></sup> [of mourning] prior to the Feast [of Tabernacles, the restrictions of the seven days are annulled for him] and [with] the Feast [of Tabernacles] there are fourteen [days], and <italic>Shemini A&#x1E93;ereth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1552">19</xref></sup> [is regarded as] seven [days, so that in all] there are twenty-one [days],<sup><xref rid="fn1596">63</xref></sup> and [with] the second day of <italic>Shemini A&#x1E93;ereth</italic> [<italic>Sim&#x1E25;ath Torah</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn1552">19</xref></sup> there are twenty-two; hence, he completes [the thirty days] by adding eight more [days].</p>
<p>12. One who buries his dead one hour<sup><xref rid="fn1589">56</xref></sup> prior to the Festival, &#x2014; [the law is that] that hour and the Festival are together] regarded as fourteen [days] and immediately after the Festival, he [the mourner] has the legal status of the third week with respect [to the law] that [the mourner] may sit [then] in his [customary] place [in the Synagogue], but must not engage in conversation.<sup><xref rid="fn1597">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>13. In localities where two Festival days<sup><xref rid="fn1598">65</xref></sup> are observed, &#x2014; one who suffered a bereavement on the second Festival day, viz., the last Festival day of Passover or <italic>Sukkoth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1552">19</xref></sup> or the second Festival day of Pentecost, and he buried [the corpse] on the same day, &#x2014; [the mourner] observes on that [day] the mourning rites, since the second Festival day is [only] Rabbinical, and [since] mourning on the first day, &#x2014; if it is the day of death and burial, &#x2014; is Biblical, &#x2014; [the law is] that a Rabbinical precept is superseded in face of a Biblical precept.<sup><xref rid="fn1599">66</xref></sup> However, if he died on the second Festival day of the New Year, and he buried him on the same day, he does not observe mourning rites, for both days [of the New Year] are [regarded] as one continuous day [of holiness].<sup><xref rid="fn1600">67</xref></sup> This applies to the seven dead mentioned explicitly in the Bible for whom a <italic>Kohen</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1552">19</xref></sup> may defile himself, but those who were added to them as stated in &#x00A7; 374, the observance of mourning rites for them is only Rabbinical. Hence, he does not observe mourning for them on any Festival whatsoever. [Furthermore], even those [dead] for whom we said that he observes mourning on the second Festival day, &#x2014; [the law is that] he does not rend garments [on their account].<sup><xref rid="fn1598">65</xref></sup> People, however, have adopted the practice not to observe mourning rites on the second Festival day of the Diaspora for any dead whatsoever, even if it the day of death and burial,<sup><xref rid="fn1601">68</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>For they accept the opinion of those who say that no mourning is Biblical, and this is the accepted practice and should not be altered</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1602">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>14. One who suffered a bereavement on the eve of a Festival day and he was afraid lest he have not sufficient time to bury him [before the advent of the Festival] whilst it is still day, and [consequently], gave [the corpse] over to Gentiles [in order] that they take him away for burial, &#x2014; [the law is that] as soon as they carry him out of the city and he [the corpse] becomes hidden from the eyes of the near-of-kin, mourning takes effect upon him,<sup><xref rid="fn1603">70</xref></sup> and if it is one hour<sup><xref rid="fn1589">56</xref></sup> prior to the Festival and he observed mourning rites therein, the restrictions of the seven [days] become annulled [with the advent of the Festival] although he was buried on the Festival [proper].<sup><xref rid="fn1604">71</xref></sup></p>

Cf., therefore, <italic>B.Yos.</italic> who holds that in reality the entire day is permissible &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1571">38) With respect to bathing and washing garments on the eve of Passover, the law is that Passover is similar to any other eve of a Festival, where it is permissible only close to nightfall (<italic>Resp.

<ftnote id="fn1572">39) V. Mishna Pes. V, 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1573">40) <italic>Resp. R. Judah Min&#x1E93;</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G.</italic> For after midday in Temple days, the Paschal lamb was offered and work was no longer done from that time and onward. Hence, since everyone else is also forbidden to cut hair on account of the festive nature of the day (v. Pes. 55b; M.K. 13a), therefore, if he should wait until after midday to cut his hair, he will be compelled to do it by himself, for no one will be available to cut his hair for him &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> Even if the eve of Passover occurred during the seven days of mourning, the restrictions of the seven days are also annulled for him after mid-day when mourning is no longer in effect &#x2014; <italic>&#x1E24;ok Adam, Mishmereth Shalom.</italic> Likewise, if the eve of <italic>Yom Kippur</italic> occurred during the seven days, one is permitted to bathe an hour or two before nightfall &#x2014; O.&#x1E24;. &#x00A7; 606 and <italic>M.Abr. ibid.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1574">41) Since the eve of the Festival falls on the Sabbath when he is forbidden to attend to these matters, we allow him to do this on the eve of the Sabbath although it is not the Festival eve.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1575">42) He may, however, wear Sabbath garments and return to his customary seat in the Synagogue (<italic>Beth Hillel</italic>) &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic> Cf. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 393, 4.</ftnote>

However, with respect to the prohibition against bathing, washing garments, laundry work and cutting nails, one in mourning for a parent is on an equal footing with one in mourning for other dead. Hence, the Festival annuls these restrictions of the thirty days &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1579">46) Even the first day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1580">47) V. par. 3 <italic>supra.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1581">48) In which case the Festival merely annuls the restrictions of the seven but not the thirty days.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1587">54) However, after the Festival bathing and washing of garments is forbidden until the thirty days are completed, since the restrictions of the thirty days were not annulled. V. O.&#x1E24;. &#x00A7; 548, 10 where the same ruling is found. Cf. however, <italic>Isserles ibid.</italic> that bathing is forbidden which contradicts his ruling here (v. <italic>Ta</italic>Z and <italic>Shak</italic> a.l.). <italic>Isserles&#x2019;</italic> ruling is fundamental here, since here is the source of the laws of mourning &#x2014; <italic>A.H.</italic></ftnote>

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 400: LAWS OF MOURNING ON THE SABBATH. Contains two paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. The Sabbath does not interrupt the mourning and enters into the counting of the seven [days],<sup><xref rid="fn1605">1</xref></sup> for some of the laws of mourning are observed therein, viz., matters of privacy, as the use of the conjugal couch and bathing, but matters that affect public mourning [<italic>one does</italic>] <italic>not</italic> [<italic>observe</italic>]. [Hence, he should] remove the mourner&#x2019;s wrapping,<sup><xref rid="fn1606">2</xref></sup> <italic>and</italic> [<italic>this applies</italic>] <italic>only if he</italic> [<italic>the mourner</italic>] <italic>is wrapped up in a covering of Ishmaelites as was explained supra</italic> &#x00A7; 386, <italic>but</italic> [<italic>if</italic>] <italic>only</italic> [<italic>wrapped in</italic>] <italic>part of a covering, which is the practice in some localities for the entire thirty</italic> [<italic>days</italic>], <italic>he is not required to remove</italic> [<italic>it</italic>] <italic>on the Sabbath, since he has shoes on his feet</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn1607">3</xref></sup> and [he must]<sup><xref rid="fn1608">4</xref></sup> put on his shoes<sup><xref rid="fn1609">5</xref></sup> and put up the couch from its overturned [position],<sup><xref rid="fn1610">6</xref></sup> and he should not wear a rent garment, but changes it; and if he has no [garment] to change [into], he turns the rent side [of his garment front] to back. [With respect to] the study of Torah, it is [regarded] as a matter pertaining to private [mourning].<sup><xref rid="fn1611">7</xref></sup> However, to review the [weekly Biblical] portion, &#x2014; [the law is that] since a person is dutibound to complete [the weekly Biblical] portion with the Congregation,<sup><xref rid="fn1612">8</xref></sup> he is [regarded] as one who reads the <italic>Shema</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1613">9</xref></sup> and is permitted. If the mourner was called to the reading of the Torah, he is required to go up, for should he refrain [from so doing], it would be [regarded as] a matter of public [mourning, which is forbidden on the Sabbath]. <italic>R.Tam</italic> would always be called [to the reading of the Torah on the Sabbath as] third, and [when] mourning [once] befell him and the <italic>&#x1E24;azzan</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1613">9</xref></sup> did not call him [as usual], he went up of his own accord and stated [that since] he was accustomed to be called as third on every Sabbath, one who notices that he does not go up [now] will say that on account of mourning he refrained [from going up] and [consequently], this would be regarded as a matter pertaining to public mourning [which is forbidden on the Sabbath]. <italic>Likewise, if the Kohen</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1613">9</xref></sup> <italic>is a mourner, and there is no other Kohen</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1613">9</xref></sup> <italic>in the Synagogue, it is permissible to call him</italic> [<italic>to the reading of the Torah</italic>], <italic>but otherwise it is forbidden</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1614">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. If a beast dragged him away or [there is a rumour that] robbers have murdered him,<sup><xref rid="fn1615">11</xref></sup> and on the Sabbath the search [for him] was given up,<sup><xref rid="fn1616">12</xref></sup> &#x2014; [the law is that] since he observes matters pertaining to private [mourning] on the Sabbath, it enters into [the counting] of one day<sup><xref rid="fn1617">13</xref></sup> [of the seven days of mourning]. <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>If the thirtieth day of mourning fell on the Sabbath and the twenty-ninth day on the eve of the Sabbath, he is permitted to bathe on the eve of the Sabbath</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1618">14</xref></sup> <italic>even in localities where it is customary not to bathe for the entire thirty</italic> [<italic>days</italic>], <italic>for since legally</italic> [<italic>bathing</italic>] <italic>is permissible after the seven</italic> [<italic>days</italic>], <italic>only that</italic> [<italic>people</italic>] <italic>have adopted a stringent view for the entire thirty</italic> [<italic>days</italic>], &#x2014; <italic>in a case such as this, it is permissible out of respect to the Sabbath</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1619">15</xref></sup> <italic>And likewise, anything similar to this, e.g.</italic>, [<italic>it is permissible for him</italic>] <italic>to return to his</italic> [<italic>customary</italic>] <italic>place in the Synagogue on the Sabbath night and to wear Sabbath garments, for this too, is merely a custom</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1620">16</xref></sup> <italic>as has been explained supra</italic> &#x00A7; 389 <italic>and</italic> &#x00A7; 390; <italic>and although a distinction may be drawn between bathing, which is forbidden on the Sabbath and these</italic> [<italic>aforementioned</italic>] <italic>matters which it is possible for him to do on the Sabbath, yet, it does not seem to me</italic> [<italic>that there is a need for</italic>] <italic>making such a distinction</italic>.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1605">1) Mishna M.K. 19a. For were the Sabbath not included there would never be seven consecutive days of mourning. Thus Y.M.K. III, 5(83a). V. also Gen. R. &#x00A7; C.

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 401: MATTERS WHICH OBTAIN ON &#x1E24;OL HA-MOED. Contains seven paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. The bier is not to be set down in the open street during <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> so as not to give occasion for lamentation;<sup><xref rid="fn1622">2</xref></sup> for it is forbidden to give occasion for lamentation during <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> unless it is [done] out of deference to a scholar.<sup><xref rid="fn1623">3</xref></sup> Therefore, the corpse is not taken out to the cemetery during <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> unless the entire grave is prepared and is at one&#x2019;s disposal.<sup><xref rid="fn1624">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. Only one who is required to rend [garments] during <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> does so, as stated in &#x00A7; 340,<sup><xref rid="fn1625">5</xref></sup> but one who is not dutibound [to do so] and desires to rend [garments during <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> out of respect [to the dead], is forbidden [to do so].</p>
<p>3. [If] one received during the Festival a report of near tidings,<sup><xref rid="fn1626">6</xref></sup> he is dutibound to rend [garments].<sup><xref rid="fn1627">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. One does not bare the shoulder [in mourning] during [<italic>&#x1E24;ol</italic>] <italic>ha-Moed</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> and only the near-of-kin of the dead are provided therein with the mourner&#x2019;s meal.<sup><xref rid="fn1628">8</xref></sup> However, [this means that] the mourner&#x2019;s meal is provided [only for] the near-of-kin [who are dutibound to observe mourning rites].<sup><xref rid="fn1629">9</xref></sup> Likewise, on <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> <italic>Purim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> and <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> [the same rule applies].<sup><xref rid="fn1630">10</xref></sup> And when the mourner&#x2019;s meal is provided [during <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> it is done only on couches set up [in the usual manner].<sup><xref rid="fn1631">11</xref></sup> However, on a Festival day, even on the second Festival day [of the Diaspora], one does not rend garments, nor bare [the shoulder in mourning], nor does one provide the mourner&#x2019;s meal.<sup><xref rid="fn1632">12</xref></sup> And during <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> all [who are in mourning] for a Sage, may be provided with the mourner&#x2019;s meal in the open space [of the town]<sup><xref rid="fn1633">13</xref></sup> in the [same] manner as the near-of-kin<sup><xref rid="fn1634">14</xref></sup> are provided with the mourner&#x2019;s meal, for all are like his near-of-kin.<sup><xref rid="fn1634">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. During <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> women may sing dirges, i.e., they all sing dirges in chorus, but may not clap, i.e., to clap their hands [in grief].<sup><xref rid="fn1635">15</xref></sup> On <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup>, <italic>Hanukkah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> and <italic>Purim</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> they may sing dirges and may clap their hands [in grief], but may not wail, i.e., when one speaks and all respond after her. After the corpse has been interred, they neither sing dirges, nor clap their hands [in grief].<sup><xref rid="fn1635">15</xref></sup> This ruling obtains only with respect to an ordinary person, but as regards a scholar [who died, the law is that] both during <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> as well as <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> and <italic>Purim</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> they may sing dirges and may wail as is their usual custom during a weekday.<sup><xref rid="fn1636">16</xref></sup> However, this ruling obtains only in his [the corpse&#x2019;s] presence, but away from his presence no [lament is permitted]. And the day of [receiving] the tidings [of his death], &#x2014; even distant [tidings], is regarded the same as in his presence.<sup><xref rid="fn1637">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. [On <italic>&#x1E24;ol ha-Moed</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> one recites for the dead <italic>&#x1E92;idduk Ha-din</italic> and <italic>Kaddish</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> as usual; likewise, on the second Festival day [of the Diaspora], but on the first day of a Festival, since we do not attend to [the burial needs of] the dead, it [<italic>&#x1E92;idduk Haddin</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> is not recited.<sup><xref rid="fn1638">18</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: <italic>Some differ</italic> [<italic>with this ruling and maintain</italic>] <italic>that &#x1E92;idduk Haddin</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> <italic>should not be recited on</italic> [<italic>&#x1E24;ol</italic>] <italic>ha-Moed</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn1639">19</xref></sup> <italic>and thus is the common practice in these countries</italic>, [<italic>viz</italic>.,] <italic>not to recite &#x1E92;idduk Haddin</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> <italic>on all days during which Ta&#x1E25;anun</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> <italic>is not recited</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1640">20</xref></sup> <italic>Hence</italic>, [<italic>it</italic>] <italic>is also not said after midday on the eve of the Sabbath</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1641">21</xref></sup> <italic>Some say that if the corpse is interred at night, Kaddish</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> <italic>and &#x1E92;idduk Haddin</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> <italic>are not recited</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1642">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. One who suffered a bereavement before <italic>Purim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> and then <italic>Purim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> occurred,<sup><xref rid="fn1643">23</xref></sup> it does not interrupt [the period of] mourning. Yet, no mourning is observed therein, neither on the fourteenth nor on the fifteenth [day of <italic>Adar</italic>];<sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> only matters pertaining to private mourning one observes,<sup><xref rid="fn1644">24</xref></sup> and one is dutibound to send gifts [to others as is customary on <italic>Purim</italic>];<sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> and although one observes no mourning rites therein, they [i.e., the fourteenth and the fifteenth of <italic>Adar</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn1621">1</xref></sup> enter for him into the counting of the seven [days of mourning] as [in the case of the] Sabbath.</p>

Hence, only private mourning is observed (v. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 400, 1). <italic>RaShaL</italic> writes that all laws of mourning must be observed on <italic>Purim.</italic> Thus <italic>Caro</italic> in O.&#x1E24;. &#x00A7; 696, 4. The apparent contradiction between <italic>Caro</italic>&#x2019;s ruling here and in O.&#x1E24;. <italic>ibid.</italic> is removed by <italic>Derisha</italic> as follows: In O.&#x1E24;. <italic>Caro</italic> deals with a case where the death occurred on <italic>Purim;</italic> in the present ruling he deals with a case where the death occurred prior to <italic>Purim. ShaK</italic>, however, claims that this is a strained interpretation. <italic>Isserles</italic> (in O.&#x1E24;. <italic>ibid.</italic>) rules like <italic>Caro</italic> here and writes that this is the accepted custom (i.e., even if the first day of mourning falls on <italic>Purim.</italic> Thus <italic>D.Merb.</italic>). Some remove the contradiction between <italic>Caro</italic>&#x2019;s rulings by suggesting that in O.&#x1E24;. <italic>ibid.</italic> an error crept into the text (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05D7;&#x05E0;&#x05D5;&#x05DB;&#x05D4;</span> which is found in all our cur. edd. should be emended to <span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05D7;&#x05E0;&#x05D5;&#x05DB;&#x05D4; .&#x05D1;&#x05E6;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05E2;&#x05D0;</span> is out of place among the laws dealing with <italic>Purim</italic>) and the ruling (in O.&#x1E24;.) should read as follows: &#x2018;All matters of mourning apply (only) in privacy on <italic>Purim&#x2019;</italic> &#x2014; <italic>Ba&#x2019;er Heteb.</italic> A mourner during the seven days of mourning is forbidden to read the <italic>Megillah</italic> (Scroll of Esther) in the Synagogue &#x2014; <italic>Imre Baruk</italic> on the authority of <italic>MaHaRIL.</italic> But if no other competent reader is available who could read as well as the mourner according to the laws of the accents (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D8;&#x05E2;&#x05DE;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>) and the principles of Grammar, the mourner may read under the circumstances &#x2014; <italic>Binyan Olam; Resp.

<p>1. One to whom a report came that he suffered the loss of a near-of-kin [for whom one is dutibound to observe mourning rites], &#x2014; if the report reached him within thirty days [after burial],<sup><xref rid="fn1645">1</xref></sup> even [if he received it] on the thirtieth day proper,<sup><xref rid="fn1646">2</xref></sup> it is considered near tidings and he is dutibound to observe seven days of mourning from the day that the [death] report reached him, and he rends [garments]<sup><xref rid="fn1647">3</xref></sup> and counts thirty days <italic>from the day the report</italic> [<italic>is received</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn1648">4</xref></sup> with respect to [the prohibition against] hair-cutting [and] with [regard to] other matters [which obtain in the case of other dead.<sup><xref rid="fn1649">5</xref></sup> The general principle of the matter is [that] the day of his [receiving] near tidings [is regarded] as the day of burial.<sup><xref rid="fn1650">6</xref></sup> However, if he received the report after the thirtieth day and onward, &#x2014; he is required to observe [mourning rites] only for one hour,<sup><xref rid="fn1651">7</xref></sup> [and] there is no difference whether he received the [death] report during the day<sup><xref rid="fn1652">8</xref></sup> or during the night,<sup><xref rid="fn1653">9</xref></sup> [for even] if he received the [death] report at night and observed some mourning rites at night for one hour,<sup><xref rid="fn1654">10</xref></sup> it counts for him [as valid]; and even if he received a report [of distant tidings] about [the death of] his father and/or mother [the same principle obtains].<sup><xref rid="fn1655">11</xref></sup> And this, &#x2014; [viz., that even in the case of receiving distant tidings about the death of one&#x2019;s parents, one hour of mourning suffices], applies only with respect to the restrictions of the seven [days of mourning which fall away in the case of distant tidings],<sup><xref rid="fn1656">12</xref></sup> but as to the restrictions of the thirty [which apply in the case of other dead],<sup><xref rid="fn1657">13</xref></sup> &#x2014; he observes [in the case of receiving distant tidings] about [the death of] his father and/or mother the [prohibition against] hair-cutting until his friends rebuke him, and with respect to laundry work, &#x2014; until the Festival arrives and they rebuke him, and likewise, with respect to extending a greeting of peace or entering a house of feasting. However, [in the aforementioned restrictions],<sup><xref rid="fn1658">14</xref></sup> he counts<sup><xref rid="fn1659">15</xref></sup> from the day of death and not from the day that the [death] report [is received]. Therefore, if a report reached him about [the death of] his father and/or mother after twelve months [from the day of death], he observes only one day<sup><xref rid="fn1660">16</xref></sup> of mourning [and] even with respect to the restrictions of the thirty [days in the case of other dead the same principle applies].</p>

One who hears distant tidings is not required to observe the entire law of mourning rites, but it is sufficient for him to remove [his] shoe[s] and he is not required [to observe in addition] muffling [of the head] or overturning the couch, and he is permitted to work, bathe, annoint himself, use of the conjugal couch and Torah-study. However, if he has no shoes on his feet [at the time the distant tidings are reported to him], he is required to overturn his couch or to muffle his head, for he is required to perform a [positive] act whereby it may be seen that he acts [thus] on account of mourning. If, however, he was engaged in the study of the Torah, or work, or he was bathing or annointing himself, and a [belated death] report came to him, &#x2014; he interrupts [this] for one hour on account of mourning, and [subsequently] returns to what he was doing.<sup><xref rid="fn1661">17</xref></sup> But if he was wearing <italic>Tefillin</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1662">18</xref></sup> [at the time the distant tidings were received], he is not required to remove them.<sup><xref rid="fn1663">19</xref></sup> Yet, he does not discharge his duty of mourning through this [aformentioned] interruption, and is required to perform a [positive] act whereby it may be seen that he acts [thus] on account of mourning, e.g., [by] removing [his] shoes or over-turning the couch and muffling [the head]. However, one [such act] is sufficient.</p>
<p>3. One does not provide the mourner&#x2019;s meal on account of distant tidings.<sup><xref rid="fn1664">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. [For all other near-of-kin] one does not rend [garments] on account of distant tidings;<sup><xref rid="fn1665">21</xref></sup> for one&#x2019;s father and/or mother one always rends [garments],<sup><xref rid="fn1666">22</xref></sup> &#x2014; <italic>and in a case where one does not have to rend</italic> [<italic>garments</italic>], <italic>one is forbidden to place himself under greater stringencies</italic> [<italic>than the law requires</italic>] <italic>and rend</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1667">23</xref></sup> [<italic>garments</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn1668">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>5.

<p>6.

<p>7. One who received near tidings on the Sabbath, &#x2014; [the law is that] the Sabbath enters for him [into the counting of] one day [of the seven days of mourning], and the following day he rends [his garments], and the sixth day [after the Sabbath] is considered for him the seventh day of mourning.<sup><xref rid="fn1673">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>8. [If] ten days after the Festival of <italic>Sukkoth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1662">18</xref></sup> one received a report that he had suffered a bereavement on the eve of the Festival [of <italic>Sukkoth</italic>], &#x2014; although, if we should count one hour before the [advent of] the Festival [of <italic>Sukkoth</italic> as equivalent to] seven [days] and the seven days of the Festival [of <italic>Sukkoth</italic>] and the day of <italic>Shemini A&#x1E93;ereth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1662">18</xref></sup> [which in itself counts as seven days, we would have] twenty-one days, and ten more days following, these would be [in all] thirty-one days, &#x2014; [yet] this [death report] does not have the status of distant tidings,<sup><xref rid="fn1674">30</xref></sup> but [rather] of near tidings,<sup><xref rid="fn1675">31</xref></sup> since the Festival does not enter [into the counting] for one who did not observe mourning prior to it [the Festival] at all, and much more so for one who knew not that he had suffered a bereavement.<sup><xref rid="fn1676">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. [If] one received two reports of distant tidings on one day, one observes for them only one day [of mourning].<sup><xref rid="fn1677">33</xref></sup> [If] they were [both reports of] near [tidings], or one suffered two bereavements simultaneously,<sup><xref rid="fn1678">34</xref></sup> one counts for both at the same time the seven and thirty [days of mourning]. [If] one heard one<sup><xref rid="fn1679">35</xref></sup> [report of near tidings] today and the other<sup><xref rid="fn1679">35</xref></sup> [on] the following day, one counts for [the first from the first day and] for the second from the day the [death] report [is received] the seven and thirty [days of mourning].<sup><xref rid="fn1680">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. One who received near tidings on the Sabbath [that fell on the] eve of the Festival, &#x2014; [the law is that] since one observes [then] matters pertaining to private [mourning], that Sabbath [day] enters for him into the counting of the seven [days of mourning].<sup><xref rid="fn1681">37</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn1645">1) Yad, <italic>Ebel</italic> VII, 1 derived from M.K. 20a. One who receives a death report and does not know whether it is still within or after the thirty days, &#x2014; there is a difference of opinion among the <italic>Codifiers. Ta</italic>Z rules that he does not have to observe mourning rites. V. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 397, 1, n. 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1646">2) Thus <italic>Alfasi</italic> and <italic>N</italic> in <italic>T.H.</italic> This is derived (M.K. 20b) from the case of one who receives near tidings on the Sabbath, and by the termination of the Sabbath it has become distant tidings in which case the law is that he observes one day of mourning only (actually one hour. V. <italic>infra</italic>). From this we conclude that the Sabbath must have been the thirtieth day, and since one observes on the Sabbath only mourning pertaining to private matters, formal mourning cannot continue after the Sabbath. Hence, with the termination of the Sabbath the death report is regarded as distant tidings. Were the Sabbath the twenty-ninth day, the entire seven days of formal mourning would have to be observed. Consequently, we may conclude that a death report received on the thirtieth day (excluding the Sabbath) is regarded as near tidings. The thirtieth day is calculated according to the locality of the mourner and not the place of death, e.g., if one who lives in United States or Canada receives a death report from Europe on the thirtieth day, although in Europe at that time it was already the thirty-first day, we follow the locality of the mourner with respect to determining whether it is near or distant tidings &#x2014; <italic>Resp. Abne Zikaron</italic>.</ftnote> 
<ftnote id="fn1647">3) Derived from M.K. 20b where the question is raised whether or not one rends garments on hearing near tiding on the Sabbath which becomes distant tidings at the termination of the Sabbath, whence it follows that during the thirty days one must rend garments. Furthermore in M.K. 25a it is stated that if a <italic>&#x1E24;akam</italic> died all must rend garments. This undoubtedly refers to near tidings, for if not, i.e., if it refers to the time between death and burial, then even in the case of any worthy person <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D3;&#x05DD; &#x05DB;&#x05E9;&#x05E8;</span> who dies one must rend garments, and not only in the case of a <italic>&#x1E24;akam.</italic> V. &#x00A7; 401, 3 and <italic>W.G.</italic> a.l.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1655">11) <italic>N</italic> and <italic>Asheri</italic>, derived from the following case of Rab and R. &#x1E24;iyya in M.K. 20a-b and parallel references: &#x2018;. . he (R. &#x1E24;iyya) said to his nephew (Rab), &#x201C;Is father alive&#x201D;? &#x2014; He replied, &#x201C;Mother is alive.&#x201D; (Again) he asked, &#x201C;Is mother alive&#x201D;? &#x2014; He replied, &#x201C;Father is alive.&#x201D; R. &#x1E24;iyya then said to his attendant, &#x201C;Take off my shoes and bring along my things to the (public) bath-house.&#x201D; From this we learn three things: We learn that a mourner is forbidden to put on shoes; that (on hearing) distant tidings (one observes mourning rites) for one day only; and that part of the day is (regarded) as a whole day.&#x2019; According to R. <italic>&#x1E24;ananel</italic>, R &#x1E24;iyya referred to his own parents when questioning Rab about them (v. <italic>Rashi and Tosaf. ibid.</italic> s.v. <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05D1;&#x05D5;</span> for other interpretations).

If, however, three or four days elapsed between death and burial, the law is that the first year one observes the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> on the day of burial and every succeeding year on the the day of death &#x2014;<italic>ShaK.</italic> On the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> day a lamp is lit. If one observes <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> for both parents on the same day, two lamps or candles are lit &#x2014; <italic>Sefer Amarkol.</italic> For one who died at twilight (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05D9;&#x05DF; &#x05D4;&#x05E9;&#x05DE;&#x05E9;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;</span>), one observes the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> on the following day &#x2014; <italic>Resp. Min&#x1E25;ath Elazar.</italic> If one who observes <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> on the Sabbath, forgot to light the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> lamp before the advent of the Sabbath, &#x2014; if he reminds himself on the eve of the Sabbath at twilight, he may instruct a non-Jew to light it for him &#x2014; <italic>M.Abr.</italic> (O.&#x1E24;. &#x00A7; 261, n. 6). One may light a <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> lamp on a Holiday &#x2014; <italic>Ketab Sofer.</italic> One who is in doubt whether the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> should be observed on the fourth or the fifth day of the month, &#x2014; the law is that if he has other brothers elsewhere who know the exact day when <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> falls (it is understood that he is unable to contact them in order to determine the correct day), he should observe the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> on the fourth day (i.e., the first doubtful day). But it there is no one else in the family to observe the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic>, he must observe both days &#x2014; <italic>&#x1E24;atam Sofer.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1692">48) Thus also if the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> day falls on the day when one&#x2019;s child is to be circumcised, the father or the <italic>Sandek</italic> or the <italic>Mohel</italic>, who may be observing <italic>Yahrzeit</italic>, do not fast. Likewise, in the case of the redemption of a first-born child, the father or the <italic>Kohen</italic> who may be observing <italic>Yahrzeit</italic>, do not fast &#x2014; O.&#x1E24;. <italic>ibid.</italic> par. 9. V. <italic>Ta</italic>Z and <italic>Sha&#x2018;are Tesh. ibid.</italic> So too, a groom during the seven days of his wedding-feast, does not fast on the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> day. However, one observing <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> is not permitted to eat at the feast held on the completion of a Talmudical tracate (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E1;&#x05D9;&#x05D5;&#x05DD;</span>) &#x2014; <italic>ShaK.</italic> One who does not know the day of his father&#x2019;s or mother&#x2019;s death, should select a certain day during the year on which to observe the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> and fast, but he may not encroach upon the rights of others with respect to the <italic>Kaddish</italic> &#x2014; <italic>M.Abr.</italic> (O.&#x1E24;. &#x00A7; 568, n. 20). If one who has to observe <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> is unable to say Kaddish, e.g., when he is on the road, he may recite <italic>Kaddish</italic> at the evening service (<italic>Ma&#x2018;arib</italic>) following the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> day &#x2014; <italic>Matte Efrayyim</italic>. If at the place of death it was already night when the person died and at the place of the near-of-kin it was still day, the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> day is fixed according to the place of death &#x2014; <italic>Sh.M.B. contra Kol Bo</italic>(<italic>G</italic>). Cf. <italic>supra</italic> par. 1, n. 2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1693">49) In an ordinary year.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1694">50) I.e., the following year or years when <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> is observed. Thus <italic>M.Abr.</italic></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1696">52) <italic>Ibid.</italic> &#x2014; <italic>G. I.e.</italic>, in a subsequent leap-year he fasts during the <italic>Adar</italic> that death occurred, and in the following ordinary years he fasts during <italic>Adar.</italic> If the death occurred during an ordinary year, then in a subsequent leap-year he fasts during <italic>Adar</italic> I and during <italic>Adar</italic> II he recites the <italic>Kaddish</italic> but does not take precedence over others in leading the services etc. &#x2014; <italic>ShaK, P.Tesh., M.Abr.</italic> The month of <italic>&#x1E24;eshvan</italic> is sometimes full (i.e., it consists of thirty days in which case the first of the month (<italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh</italic>) of <italic>Kislev</italic>, following, consists of two days, of which the first day of <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh</italic> is the thirtieth day of <italic>&#x1E24;eshvan</italic> and the second day of <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh</italic> is the first day of <italic>Kislev</italic>) and sometimes the month of <italic>&#x1E24;eshvan</italic> is defective (i.e., it consists of twenty-nine days, in which case, <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh Kislev</italic>, following, is observed only one day). Consequently, if one dies on <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh Kislev</italic> when <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh</italic> is observed only one day, &#x2014; the law is that in a subsequent year when <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh Kislev</italic> consists of two days, the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> should be observed on the second day of <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh</italic>, which is the first day of the month of <italic>Kislev.</italic> However, if one died on the first day of <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh Kislev</italic> when <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh</italic> consisted of two days, the question is &#x2014; when should one observe <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> in a subsequent year when <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh Kislev</italic> consists of one day only? Should one observe the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> on the twenty-ninth day of <italic>&#x1E24;eshvan</italic>, since the death took place on the last day of <italic>&#x1E24;eshvan</italic>, or do we say that since in matters pertaining to vows (v. end of <italic>Gloss anon</italic>) we follow the language of the people, he should observe <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> on <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh Kislev?</italic> &#x2014; The following procedure should be adopted: If during the first year following the death, <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh Kislev</italic> is observed for one day only, the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> should be observed on the twenty-ninth day of <italic>&#x1E24;eshvan.</italic> Thus also whenever the month of <italic>&#x1E24;eshvan</italic> is defective, then on the following day (i.e., <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh Kislev</italic>), if there are no mourners in the Synagogue, he should also recite the <italic>Kaddish</italic> and lead the services. But if during the year following the death, <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh Kislev</italic> consists of two days, consequently, the <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> becomes fixed for <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh Kislev</italic> and he should observe it thus every subsequent year, even when <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh Kislev</italic> consists of one day. The same principle applies to other months which are sometimes full and sometimes defective &#x2014; <italic>M.Abr.</italic> Since <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh Tebeth</italic> is sometimes observed one day, in which case the sixth day of <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> is the first of <italic>Tebeth</italic>, the seventh day, &#x2014; the second of <italic>Tebeth</italic> and the eighth day, &#x2014; the third of <italic>Tebeth;</italic> and sometimes <italic>Rosh &#x1E24;odesh Tebeth</italic> consists of two days, i.e., the sixth and seventh day of <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic>, in which case the seventh day of <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> is the first day of <italic>Tebeth</italic> and the eighth day, &#x2014; the second day of <italic>Tebeth</italic>, &#x2014; consequently, one who observes <italic>Yahrzeit</italic> during these days should not err by counting the days of <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic>, but one must always count the days of the month &#x2014; <italic>M.Abr.</italic></ftnote>

Should one, however, be ill or should there be any other reason which prevents him from observing the fast-day, he must first be released from his vow. But if, prior to observing the first fast-day, one explicitly stated that he fasts on the condition that this should not be regarded as a vow for the following year, he does not require any release (v.

<title>C<small>HAPTER</small> 403: THE LAWS OF ONE WHO COLLECTS BONES [FOR FINAL BURIAL].<sup><xref rid="fn1699">1</xref></sup> Contains ten paragraphs.</title>
<p>1. One who collects his father&#x2019;s [or his mother&#x2019;s] bones<sup><xref rid="fn1700">2</xref></sup> or [the bones] of other near-of-kin for whom one observes mourning rites,<sup><xref rid="fn1701">3</xref></sup> mourns for them all day<sup><xref rid="fn1702">4</xref></sup> in [that he observes] all matters which apply to a mourner, [viz.,] by over-turning the couch, muffling the head, [by debarring himself from] wearing shoes, [from] using the conjugal couch, [from] bathing and annointing himself.<sup><xref rid="fn1703">5</xref></sup> However, in the evening one does not observe mouring rites for them, even if he had them by him tied up in a sheet.<sup><xref rid="fn1704">6</xref></sup> [If] he was standing and collecting [the bones] and night fell, he is permitted [the aforementioned matters which are forbidden to a mourner], on the following day. Therefore, one should not collect them close to nightfall so that it should not turn out that he observed no mourning rites for the collection of his father&#x2019;s [or mother&#x2019;s] bones.<sup><xref rid="fn1705">7</xref></sup> <italic>Aninuth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1706">8</xref></sup> <italic>does not</italic> [<italic>take effect</italic>] <italic>in</italic> [<italic>the case of</italic>] <italic>a collection of bones</italic> [<italic>for final burial</italic>];<sup><xref rid="fn1707">9</xref></sup> <italic>only mourning rites become effective forthwith</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1708">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>2. Whosoever rends [garments] for him at the time of his death, rends [garments] for him at the time of [his] bone-collection; and every [rent] which is not resewn at the time of his death, is not resewn at the time of [his] bone-collection.<sup><xref rid="fn1709">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>3. [With respect to] bones [which are collected for final burial], one does not stand for them in the line [of comforters], but one says words of comfort on their own account.<sup><xref rid="fn1710">12</xref></sup> One does not provide the mourner&#x2019;s meal for them<sup><xref rid="fn1711">13</xref></sup> in the town-group,<sup><xref rid="fn1712">14</xref></sup> but one provides the mourner&#x2019;s meal for them in his<sup><xref rid="fn1713">15</xref></sup> house.<sup><xref rid="fn1714">16</xref></sup> One does not recite for them lamentations and elegies, but one says for them [words of] praise,<sup><xref rid="fn1715">17</xref></sup> [i.e.,] <italic>the praise of the departed</italic> [<italic>whose bones were collected</italic>] <italic>and one praises the Lord who puts to death and makes alive</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1716">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>4. One may not collect his father&#x2019;s [or mother&#x2019;s] bones on [<italic>&#x1E24;ol</italic>-] <italic>ha-Moed</italic>, and needless to say, the bones of other near-of-kin.<sup><xref rid="fn1717">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>5. One who heard that today they collected the bones of his near-of-kin for whom he observes mourning rites, &#x2014; although he was not [present] there, &#x2014; observes mourning rites for them.<sup><xref rid="fn1718">20</xref></sup> <italic>But if he heard that</italic> [<italic>the bones</italic>] <italic>were collected yesterday, he does not observe mourning rites for them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1719">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>6. One must not take apart the [collected] bones nor sever the sinews.<sup><xref rid="fn1720">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>7. A collection of bones [for final burial] is made only after the flesh has become decomposed;<sup><xref rid="fn1721">23</xref></sup> [for] once the flesh is decomposed, the shape of the corpse is no longer discernible through the bones.<sup><xref rid="fn1722">24</xref></sup> Therefore, one may collect by himself<sup><xref rid="fn1723">25</xref></sup> his father&#x2019;s and mother&#x2019;s bones. Yet, it is [more] proper that one should not collect them by himself. [This is derived] from that [which is related] about R. Eliezer b. &#x1E92;adok [as stated] anon.</p>
<p>8. A person may collect the bones of two corpses at one time, [viz., he places the bones of one corpse] at the end of [his] <italic>epikarsion</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1724">26</xref></sup> on one side, and [the bones of another corpse] at the [other] end of the [same] <italic>epikarsion</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1724">26</xref></sup> on the other side. These are the words of R. Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Nuri. R. Akiba<sup><xref rid="fn1725">27</xref></sup> says, eventually the <italic>epikarsion</italic> will rot and it will turn out that the bones of two corpses will be mixed up [which is forbidden]; [therefore], one should rather collect and place [the bones of] each one separately in a coffin of cedar wood. Said R. Eliezer b. &#x1E92;adok, &#x2014; thus said my father to me at the time of his death, &#x2014; &#x2018;At first bury me in a depression<sup><xref rid="fn1726">28</xref></sup> and later [after the flesh is decomposed] collect my bones and place them in [a coffin] of cedar wood and do not collect them yourself,<sup><xref rid="fn1727">29</xref></sup> so that they do not become reprehensible to you&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn1728">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>9. One who collects bones [for final burial] and one who guards the corpse and the one who carries them from place to place is exempt from the reading of the <italic>Shema</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1706">8</xref></sup> <italic>from Tefillah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1706">8</xref></sup> from <italic>Tefillin</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1706">8</xref></sup> and from all religious duties enjoined in the Torah, both during a weekday as well as during the Sabbath,<sup><xref rid="fn1729">31</xref></sup> and there is no difference whether [these are] the bones of near-of-kin or of strangers, both if he is in a boat or on the road, even if the collectors [of the bones] are many.<sup><xref rid="fn1730">32</xref></sup> If one desires to place himself under greater stringencies [than the law requires] he should not do so out of deference [to the collected] bones.<sup><xref rid="fn1730">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>10. One who carries bones from place to place should not put them in a sack or saddle-bag and place them across [the back of] an ass and sit on them, because it is a disrespectful way of treating them;<sup><xref rid="fn1731">33</xref></sup> but if he throws it<sup><xref rid="fn1732">34</xref></sup> over his shoulder on the ass,<sup><xref rid="fn1733">35</xref></sup> it is all right.<sup><xref rid="fn1734">36</xref></sup> However, if he was afraid of robbers and rovers, it is permitted [to sit on them].<sup><xref rid="fn1735">37</xref></sup> <italic>Gloss</italic>: [<italic>R. Meir used to say, it is written, &#x2018;It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting; for that is the end of all men</italic>] <italic>and the living will lay it to heart&#x2019;</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1736">38</xref></sup> [<italic>viz.</italic>,] <italic>matters pertaining to death; if one makes a lamentation, others will make a lamentation for him; if one helps at burial, others will bury him; if one carries</italic> [<italic>the bier</italic>], <italic>others will carry him; if one raises</italic> [<italic>his voice in funereal lamentations</italic>], <italic>others will raise</italic> [<italic>their voice</italic>] <italic>for him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1737">39</xref></sup> <italic>Great is the peace that was given to the righteous, for when a righteous man departs</italic> [<italic>this world</italic>] <italic>three companies of ministering Angels extend to him a greeting of peace</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1738">40</xref></sup> <italic>and exclaim, &#x2018;He shall enter into peace&#x2019;</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1739">41</xref></sup> (<italic>And everyone that is written unto life shall be called holy</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1740">42</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote">&#x2018;HE WILL SWALLOW UP DEATH FOR EVER; AND THE LORD GOD, WILL WIPE AWAY TEARS FROM OFF ALL FACES&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn1741">43</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1699">1) There are three main reasons for collecting bones for final burial: a) In order to transfer the remains from outside the Land of Israel to the Land of Israel proper. V. Gen. XLIX, 29-30 ; b) In order to transfer the remains from one place to another place so that the dead should rest among relatives. Cf. <italic>Josephus Flavius, Wars of the Jews</italic> I, 9a; Num. R. XXIII, 13; c) In order to transfer the bones of those executed by Court. According to the Mishna, those executed by Court were not interred in their ancestral tombs, but two burial places were prepared by the <italic>Beth Din;</italic> one for those who were decapitated or strangled, and the other for those who were stoned or burned, and when the flesh was completely decomposed, the bones were collected and interred in their proper place (Mishna San. 46a). Cf. Y.Pes. VIII, 7(36b); Y.M.K. I, 5(80c-d); Y.San. VI, 12(23d); <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 362, n. 3; Sem(H). Int. VI, 10.</ftnote>

V. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 375, 7. A <italic>Kohen</italic> is forbidden to collect the bones of his father lest the corpse is defective, in which case he is for-bidden to defile himself for him (v. <italic>supra</italic> &#x00A7; 373, 9) &#x2014; <italic>ShaK, Derisha</italic>.</ftnote>
