<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<h1>&#x00A7; 1. S<small>HORT</small> A<small>CCOUNT OF THE</small> B<small>OOK AND ITS</small> H<small>ISTORY</small></h1>
<p>T<small>HE</small> book usually designated <span dir="rtl">&#x05E4;&#x05E8;&#x05E7;&#x05D9; &#x05D3;&#x05E8;&#x05F3; &#x05D0;&#x05DC;&#x05D9;&#x05E2;&#x05D6;&#x05E8;</span>, <italic>Pir&#x1E33;&#x00EA; de Rabbi Eliezer</italic> (<italic>Chapters of Rabbi Eliezer</italic>), is not the least important of the Rabbinic Pseudepigrapha. The attention recently given to the study of the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha has, to a certain extent, been limited by the neglect of the Rabbinic side of the subject. The only Hebrew works translated in the magnificent Oxford edition of the <italic>Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha</italic> are the <italic>Pir&#x1E33;&#x00EA; Aboth</italic> and the <italic>Fragments of a Zadokite Work.</italic> The selection of these two books is singularly unfortunate, since neither belongs to the Pseudepigrapha proper. More appropriate would have been the inclusion in the afore-mentioned <italic>corpus</italic> of such works as the <italic>Othijoth de Rabbi &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba</italic> or the <italic>Pir&#x1E33;&#x00EA; de Rabbi Eliezer</italic>, now presented, for the first time, in an English translation.</p>
<p>The name of the writer of the book is unknown. The putative author is Rabbi Eliezer, son of Hyr&#x1E33;anos, who lived in the latter half of the first century <small>C.E.</small> and in the first decades of the second century. He was famous on account of his great erudition, but in spite of his reputation as a scholar he was ultimately excommunicated. Was it on account of this very fact that the actual writer of our book deliberately selected the name of this famous master in Israel as its supposed author? In many respects the book is polemical and unorthodox&#x2014;polemical in opposing doctrines and traditions current in certain circles in former times, unorthodox in revealing certain mysteries which were reputed to have been taught in the school of Rabban Jochanan ben &#x1E92;akkai, the teacher of our Rabbi Eliezer. Did our author deem it dangerous to expose his own identity? Did he not run the risk of being placed under the ban for the daring displayed in writing his book? What name was more honoured, in spite of the excommunication which had made it so prominent, than Rabbi Eliezer the Great, who is quoted in Mishnah and Talmud more frequently than any one of his contemporaries?</p>
<p>The book enjoyed considerable popularity in Jewish circles in former days, for there are more than two dozen editions. There is also a Latin version with an elaborate commentary by Vorstius (1644), indicating a certain interest in the book even in non-Jewish circles. The first edition was printed in Constantinople in 1514, the second edition appeared in Venice, 1544, the third edition was published in Sabbioneta in 1567. Later editions of value are those of Amsterdam and Prague. The folio edition of Rabbi David Luria (Vilna, 1837) is the best extant. His critical commentary is a mine of valuable information which has been constantly laid under contribution in the preparation of the notes in the present volume. The editions of Brode and Einhorn have also been consulted.</p>
<p>The text adopted for translation is a valuable unedited MS. belonging to Abraham Epstein of Vienna. This treasure contains not only the entire work as printed in the various editions, but a small section of the last chapter which has never been printed. Wertheimer&#x2019;s <italic>Bott&#x00EA; Midrashoth</italic>, iii. pp. 29&#x2013;34, contains a parallel text to the last chapter, but not as complete as our MS. text. The MS. is probably the work of a Spanish scribe of the twelfth or thirteenth century. It was formerly the property of N. Coronel. In very many instances the text preserved in the MS. is superior to that contained in the printed editions. The MS. used by the editor of the <italic>editio princeps</italic> was fairly accurate, as this text is on the whole correct and consecutive. This edition was used by the editor of the beautiful second edition, in which some of the errors incidental to a first edition have been rectified. This text has been used by all subsequent editors and was adopted by Vorstius for his Latin version.</p>
<p>In addition to Epstein&#x2019;s MS., the present writer has used an old MS. fragment of the astronomical chapters (VI.&#x2013;VIII.) belonging to the Rev. Dr. M. Gaster, and also his MS. (9), which, however, is incomplete. Several fragments from the Cairo Geni&#x1E93;ah belonging to Mr. Elkan N. Adler, M.A., have been collated. The Geni&#x1E93;ah fragments belonging to the Cambridge University have been copied by Dr. A. Marmorstein and his transcript has been used. The MSS. of the Bodleian Library, Oxford, have also been collated. The fragment MS. in the British Museum, edited by Horowitz, has likewise been consulted.</p>
<p>In the printed texts there are fifty-four chapters, whereas in our MS. there are only fifty-three chapters, due to the fact that the last two are combined into one. In its present form the book is undoubtedly incomplete. In all the editions the last chapter breaks off in the middle of a sentence. The MSS. referred to in the <italic>Jewish Encyclopedia</italic> (x. p. 59b) have not been available.</p>
<h1>&#x00A7; 2. P<small>LAN AND</small> C<small>ONTENTS OF THE</small> B<small>OOK</small></h1>
<p>The book, as we now know it, is, in all probability, a composite work, consisting of three originally distinct sections. The object of one of these parts was to describe in detail the &#x201C;ten descents&#x201D; from heaven to earth, which God is said in Holy Scripture to have made in the past. The books of old told of the Ascension of Isaiah, as well as of the Assumption of Moses and other worthies; our book essayed the more sacred task of revealing the ten Divine descents on earth. The purpose of the Pistis Sophia is somewhat similar, of course from the standpoint of the Christian gnostic. The last chapter in our book deals with the eighth descent. The missing part of the work is claimed to be preserved in the text published by M. Friedmann in the <italic>Pseudo-Tanna de b&#x00EA; Elijahu</italic>. The authenticity of this material has, however, not been established thus far.</p>
<p>Another section incorporated in our present work professed to give a detailed account of Rabbinic mysticism, more particularly the ancient mysteries of the Creation (Ma&#x2018;aseh Bereshith), the Divine Chariot (Ma&#x2018;aseh Merkabah), as well as the secret of the Calendar (S&#x00F4;d Ha-&#x2018;Ibbur) and the secret of the Redemption (S&#x00F4;d Ge&#x2019;ullah). The mysteries of the heaven above, the earth beneath, and the waters under the earth are all revealed. Paradise and Gehenna, this world and the new world, are all explored. We hear of the Ministering Angels, Sammael and the angels &#x201C;who fell from their holy place in heaven,&#x201D; and also concerning Leviathan and Behemoth. The life hereafter, the resurrection of the dead, and the Messianic Age are discussed. The doctrine of the &#x201C;Last Things,&#x201D; usually known as Eschatology, is not entirely forgotten.</p>
<p>The possibility of a third book in our work is to be detected in the fragment of a Midrash on the <italic>Shemoneh &#x2018;Esreh</italic> (the Jewish prayer <italic>par excellence</italic>), which is contained in the latter part of the &#x201C;Chapters.&#x201D; Whether the three chapters (VI.&#x2013;VIII.) dealing with the Calendar are an integral part of the section previously discussed or whether they belong to the actual <italic>Pir&#x1E33;&#x00EA; de Rabbi Eliezer</italic> is a moot point, which cannot be decided off-hand. The result of the combination of the different sections may be seen in the repetition of several narratives (<italic>e.g</italic>. the creation of Adam), in obvious contradictions (<italic>e.g.</italic> Chapter III. and Chapter XVIII.; Chapter XXX. and Chapter XXXI., on the question of the difference between the ages of Isaac and Ishmael), and finally in the absence of consecutive order in the arrangement of the material. Likewise the order in which the different chapters are arranged is a further proof of the composite nature of the entire book. Moreover, the first two chapters form an independent section which has been prefixed for the purpose of providing a preface in order to justify the authorship attributed to Rabbi Eliezer. The two chapters are entirely biographical, setting forth the call of Rabbi Eliezer. Our contention as to the relation of these two chapters towards the rest of the book, as we now know it, seems to be supported by the fact that the MS. of the first part of our book in the British Museum begins at Chapter III. of the printed text. The same fact applies to the portion of our book which has been incorporated by R. Asher Ha-Levi in his <italic>Sepher Ha-Zikhronoth</italic> (Bodleian MS. Heb. d. 11, No. 2797). Dr. Marmorstein finds in MS. Adler (522, p. 143b), Chapter XLIV. quoted. This corresponds to Chapter XLII. in the printed texts. Again, on p. 79a, Chapter XLI. is mentioned, corresponding to Chapter XXXIX. in our text. In Gaster MS. (9) ten anciently written chapters have been inserted which are all enumerated as though the book began with Chapter III. This clearly shows that in some MSS, the first two chapters were missing, and, as we have suggested, did not form part of the original work.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Chapters III.&#x2013;XI. deal with the work of the Creation.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Chapters XII.&#x2013;XX. refer to Adam and Eve.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Chapters XXI. and XXII. give the story of Cain, Abel, and the other descendants of Adam and Eve.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Chapters XXIII. and XXIV. contain the history of Noah and his sons and the narrative of the Flood.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Chapter XXV. sets forth the sin and doom of Sodom.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Chapters XXVI.&#x2013;XXXI. cover the life story of Abraham, including the story of the &#x2018;A&#x1E33;edah (or the binding of Isaac).</p>
<p align="blockquote">Chapters XXXII. and XXXIII. deal with the life of Isaac.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Chapter XXXIV. is devoted to an account of the resurrection of the dead.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Chapters XXXV.&#x2013;XXXVII. present the story of Jacob&#x2019;s life.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Chapters XXXVIII. and XXXIX. refer to Joseph.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Chapter XL. discusses the signs given by God to Moses.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Chapter XLI. is concerned with the revelation on Sinai.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Chapters XLII. and XLIII. (which are evidently out of place) contain the narrative of the Exodus (which should precede the story of the revelation on Sinai).</p>
<p align="blockquote">Chapter XLIV. unfolds the history of Amalek.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Chapters XLV.&#x2013;XLVII. set forth the story of the Golden Calf.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Chapter XLVIII. resumes the subject of the Exodus.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Chapters XLIX. and L. give the story of Haman and Mordecai.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Chapter LI. is eschatological.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Chapter LII. describes the wonders of old.</p>
<p align="blockquote">Chapter LIII. reverts to the history of Israel in the wilderness, <italic>e.g</italic>. the &#x201C;Brazen&#x201D; Serpent and Miriam.</p>
<p>In the second half of the book we see the fragment of the Midrash on the <italic>Shemoneh</italic> &#x2018;<italic>Esreh</italic>, furnishing a series of links connecting the various sections of this part of the book. Thus the first benediction is referred to in Chapter XXVII. in connection with Abraham. The second benediction occurs in Chapters XXXI. and XXXIV., in connection with Isaac. The third in Chapter XXXV. (Jacob), the fourth in Chapter XL. (Moses), the fifth in Chapter XLIII. in connection with Manasseh and Nineveh, the sixth in Chapter XLVI. in connection with Israel in the wilderness, the seventh in Chapter LI. (Messianic), and the eighth in Chapters LII. and LIII. (Miriam). The fact that only eight descents and only eight benedictions are dealt with in the book is noteworthy, and points to the present incomplete condition of the work.</p>

<p>The book is usually known by the title <italic>Pir&#x1E33;&#x00EA; de Rabbi Eliezer.</italic> Our MS. uses this designation, adding &#x201C;Ha-Gadol&#x201D; (&#x201C;the Great&#x201D;). The first to quote our book are the Geonim or Rabbis of Babylon, see <italic>Siddur</italic> of <italic>Rab</italic> &#x2018;Amram (<italic>c.</italic> 850 <small>C.E.</small>), p. 32a. Mach&#x1E93;or Vitry (ed. S. Hurwitz), p. 117, quotes our book by the title &#x201C;Pera&#x1E33;im&#x201D; (&#x201C;The Chapters&#x201D;). In the Tosaphoth to Kethuboth, 99a, R. Tam calls it &#x201C;Haggadath de Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyr&#x1E33;anos.&#x201D; The &#x2018;Arukh terms it &#x201C;Baraitha de Rabbi Eliezer.&#x201D; Dr. Marmorstein finds our book mentioned in Midrash Ha-Ch&#x00EA;f&#x00EA;z (B.M. 2351, p. 89b) under the title of &#x201C;Mishnah de R. Eliezer&#x201D;; the same designation occurs in a bookseller&#x2019;s catalogue of the twelfth to thirteenth century, see <italic>J.Q.R.</italic> xiii. p. 53.</p>
<p>The usual title <italic>Pir&#x1E33;&#x00EA; de Rabbi Eliezer</italic> is employed by Rashi (<italic>e.g.</italic> on Gen. xxvii. 9; Deut. xii. 17; Jonah i. 7), Jehudah Ha-Levi (Khazari iii. 65 and iv. 29), and Maimonides (Moreh Nebukhim i. 70 and ii. 26). For further references see the excellent chapter on our book in Zunz, <italic>Gottesdienstliche Vortr&#x00E4;ge der Juden</italic> (2nd ed.), p. 283, note <italic>f</italic>.</p>
<p>In addition to the writers and books mentioned in the previous paragraphs, quotations from our book are to be found in R. Achai Gaon in She&#x2018;eltoth, in Na&#x1E6D;ronai Gaon in Chemdah Genu&#x1E93;ah No. 93, in R. Moses of Coucy&#x2019;s <italic>S.M.G</italic>., in Halakhoth Gedoloth (ed. Hildesheimer, p. 5), in Midrash Haggadol (ed. Schechter), Midrash Agadah (ed. Buber), Jal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D; Shim&#x2019;oni, Jal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D; Makhiri, Midrash Sekhel &#x1E6C;ob (ed. Buber), also in the commentaries on the Pentateuch by R. Bechai and Nachmanides, as well as in the latter&#x2019;s Torath Ha-Adam, and many other books too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>In addition to the bibliography to be found in the <italic>Jewish Encyclopedia</italic> (x. p. 60a) and in Wolff, <italic>Bibl. Hebr.</italic> i. p. 173, iii. p. 110, and iv. p. 1032, the following references have been furnished by Dr. Marmorstein:</p>

<h1>&#x00A7; 4. <italic>P.R.E.</italic> <small>AND</small> T<small>ALMUD</small>, T<small>ARGUM</small>, M<small>IDRASH</small>, &#x1E92;<small>OHAR, AND</small> L<small>ITURGY</small></h1>
<p>The fact that with two exceptions all the names of the Rabbis quoted in our book are Palestinian teachers has been duly noted by scholars, see <italic>J.E.</italic> x. p. 59a. Equally remarkable is the fact that the direct quotations from the Talmud are to be found in the Palestinian Talmud only. The inference to be drawn from this circumstance is that the author was probably a Palestinian. Again, there is a very close connection between the Palestinian Targum to the Pentateuch, usually known as the Pseudo-Jonathan ben U&#x1E93;&#x1E93;iel, and our author.</p>
<p>The present writer inclines to the view that our book was one of the sources used by this Targumist. There is also evidence which goes to show that the author of the Second Targum to Esther used our book. Likewise there is reason to believe that the &#x1E92;ohar has used many of the interpretations and doctrines which are to be found in our work. In all probability a similar statement applies to the Book of Jashar.</p>
<p>On the other hand, our author has laid Genesis Rabbah under contribution. In the notes attention will be drawn to some of the parallels to be found in Talmudic and Midrashic literature.</p>
<p>The question of interdependence arises in connection with the <italic>Baraitha de Sh&#x2019;muel</italic>. The date 776 <small>C.E.</small> is mentioned in this work, and shortly after this date the work was most probably written. Have we, however, the original <italic>Baraitha</italic>? Was our book used by the writer of this <italic>Baraitha</italic>? Were the two works originally united in one book? Are we to believe, as Dr. Gaster seems to urge in his valuable Introduction to <italic>Jera&#x1E25;meel</italic>, that the three astronomical chapters (VI.&#x2013;VIII.)are part of the original <italic>Baraitha</italic>? These problems must remain for the present unsolved. The views of Zunz on this question will be referred to in the notes. On the entire problem Bornstein&#x2019;s note on pp. 177 f. in Sokolow&#x2019;s Jubilee Volume (1904) should be consulted. A similar unsolved problem arises in connection with the Sepher Jezirah; some of the points of contact between this book and <italic>P.R.E.</italic> will be mentioned in the notes.</p>
<p>Many of the Midrashic explanations and legends contained in our book have been utilized by the Paye&#x1E6D;anim (liturgical poets) whose poems have enriched the liturgy of the Synagogue. The commentary to the Mach&#x1E93;or by Heidenheim draws attention to many parallels in our book.</p>
<p>Recent investigation has proved that the date hitherto assigned to &#x1E32;alir must be altered to an earlier period (c. seventh century). According to Zunz, <italic>G.V.</italic> (p. 290) &#x1E32;alir used <italic>P.R.E.</italic> in his liturgical compositions, and if this be so, he must have had an earlier form of our book than has come down to us.</p>
<p>The Jozeroth as well as the daily and Sabbath liturgy of the Synagogue point to the direct influence exerted by our book. One instance will illustrate this point. The &#x1E32;edushah of the Mussaph for Sabbath and Holyday is to be found in its earliest form in our book (see p. 26 and cf. <italic>M.G.W.J</italic>., 1887, pp. 550 ff.). Does this fact enable us to determine the provenance of our &#x201C;Chapters&#x201D;? Dr. B&#x00FC;chler has pointed out to the present writer that the phrase on p. 169, &#x201C;Through me will all the righteous crown Thee with a crown of sovereignty,&#x201D; shows that the author knew the special form of the &#x1E32;edushah of the mystics known as the &#x201C;Jored&#x00EA; Merkabah,&#x201D; discussed by P. Bloch in <italic>M.G.W.J.</italic>, 1893 (37), p. 310, and by Dr. B&#x00FC;chler in <italic>R.&#x00C9;.J.</italic> liii. p. 220.</p>
<p>In connection with this subject, it is interesting to note that the tenth chapter seems to be a homily for the Day of Atonement. According to Horowitz, <italic>Beth</italic> &#x2018;<italic>E&#x1E33;ed Ha-Hagadoth</italic>, p. 21, Chapter XXX., which has been incorporated in the Midrash of the Ten Kings, was also written for liturgical purposes, probably as a Midrash for the Sabbath preceding the 9th of Ab. Possibly Chapters XXV. and XXVI. were homilies for the New Year. The sections from Chapters III., IV., V., VI., IX., and XI. dealing with the Creation and Adam, which are preserved in the B.M. MS. 27089 and printed by Horowitz, <italic>Sammlung kleiner Midraschim</italic>, i. pp. 4 ff., may have served a liturgical purpose in connection with the New Year, because according to our author Adam was created on the New Year. Similar Midrashic sections are&#x2014;(1) Chapter XLII., for Sabbath Shirah or for the seventh Day of Passover; (2) Chapter XLI., for Pentecost; (3) Chapter IV., dealing with the Cherubim and the Divine Throne for Pentecost (the Haph&#x1E6D;arah being Ezek. i.); and (4) Chapter XXXIII., for the Intermediate Sabbath in Passover (the Haph&#x1E6D;arah being Ezek. xxxvii.). Several chapters are also to be regarded as Midrashim to the weekly Portion (Sedra). Finally, Chapter XLIV. and Chapter XLIX. are probably Midrashim for Sabbath &#x1E92;akh&#x00F4;r, whilst Chapter L. is a Midrashic reading for Purim. Chapter XXXI., which deals with the &#x2018;A&#x1E33;edah, may have been a homily for the New Year or for Sabbath Vay&#x00EA;ra. Chapter XXXIII. was most likely the Midrash to the Haph&#x1E6D;arah for Sabbath Vay&#x00EA;ra.</p>
<h1>&#x00A7; 5. <italic>P.R.E.</italic> <small>AND THE</small> P<small>SEUDEPIGRAPHA AND</small> A<small>POCRYPHA</small></h1>
<p>Among the most valuable writings in the second volume of the Oxford edition of the <italic>Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha</italic> are Jubilees, the two Books of Enoch, the Testaments of the XII Patriarchs, 4 Ezra, and the Books of Adam and Eve. With all these books there are points of contact in the <italic>Pir&#x1E33;&#x00EA; de R. Eliezer</italic>. For instance, the Biblical narrative covered by our book agrees to a considerable extent with the material dealt with by the Book of Jubilees. We shall find frequent occasion in the notes to refer not only to the points of similarity between the two works, but also to several points of dissimilarity. There seems to be reasonable ground for assuming that the author of our book was acquainted not only with Jubilees, but also with the pseudepigraphic Books of Enoch (Ethiopic and Slavonic), and very probably with the Testaments of the XII Patriarchs, or with the sources of these books.</p>
<p>Jubilees and our book are alike in being practically Midrashic paraphrases and expansions of the narratives contained in the Book of Genesis and part of the Book of Exodus. Our book contains more than this, but it is a later compilation. Both books deal with the Calendar (see Jubilees vi. 28&#x2013;33), and in this respect they recall the Books of Enoch (Eth. Enoch lxxii.&#x2013;lxxxii.). In all these books we have chapters setting forth the story of the Creation (Ma&#x2019;aseh Bereshith). The mysteries and secrets contained in some of the above-mentioned books of the Pseudepigrapha reappear in our book. The past is recalled and the future revealed. The nature of God, angels, and man is unfolded. We read of sin and grace, repentance and atonement, good and evil, life and death, Paradise and Gehenna, Satan and Messiah. The same anthropomorphic expressions occur in all this literature and reappear in our book. The Index will enable the reader to find easily in our book its teaching on all these points.</p>
<p>Our book does not merely re-echo the esoteric doctrines of Apocalypse, it occasionally dares to speak with its own voice and at times deliberately modifies the teaching of the old Pseudepigrapha. For instance, the Calendar doctrines set forth in Jubilees and part of the Enoch literature are rejected and opposed. The Calendar section in our book is of more than passing interest, because it may indicate&#x2014;(1) The probable date when our book was written, (2) its provenance, and (8) the motive for its composition. According to S. Pozna&#x0144;ski (Hastings&#x2019; <italic>Ency. of Religion and Ethics</italic>, iii. 117) the probable date is in the period of the Geonim (<italic>c</italic>. 800), its origin was in Babylon, and the purpose of the book was to oppose factions or sects who at this period had their individual calendars. Reference should be made to the <italic>J.Q.R.</italic> x. 152&#x2013;161 for the discussion on the Calendar disputes in the days of Sa&#x2019;adiah (892&#x2013;942), see also <italic>J.Q.R.</italic> xiv. pp. 87 ff. and (new series) v. 4, pp. 543 ff.</p>
<p>The various forms of the Calendar, which were probably the occasion of attack or defence, <italic>e.g.</italic> the systems set forth in Jubilees and the Books of Enoch, as well as the calendars of the Samaritans and Karaites, and the systems elaborated in the Rabbinic and Patristic literature and also in the Hellenistic Jewish writings, would have to be carefully considered before we can be in a position to formulate the purpose of the Calendar in our book.</p>
<p>To revert to the Book of Jubilees in relation to our book, the following passages in the former seem to have some connection with our text.</p>
<p>Jub. i. 29 refers to the renewal of the heavens and the earth (cf. <italic>ibid.</italic> iv. 26 and xxiii. 26&#x2013;28, and Charles&#x2019; note on p. 10 of his edition of Jubilees); Chapter LI. (pp. 410 ff.) in our book is devoted to this theme.</p>
<p>In Jub. i. and ii. reference is made to the intercourse between Moses and the angels; the same subject reappears in our book (Chapter XLVI. pp. 361 f.), where we also read of &#x201C;letters and tablets for healing&#x201D; (p. 362) given to Moses by the angels, this is similar to Jub. x. 12, 13.</p>
<p>According to Jub. ii. 17&#x2013;21, when the Israelites observe the Sabbath, they resemble the angels; this belief reappears in our book (Chapter XLVI. p. 364), except for the fact that Sabbath is replaced by the Day of Atonement (<italic>i.e.</italic> the Sabbath of Sabbaths).</p>
<p>Very striking is the passage in Jub. ii. dealing with the selection of Israel to keep the Sabbath and the nature of the Sabbath observance, &#x201C;eating, drinking, and blessing God&#x201D; (ii. 21). This must be compared with <italic>P.R.E.</italic> xix. p. 138: &#x201C;The Holy One, blessed be He, blessed and hallowed the Sabbath day, and <italic>Israel</italic> is bound only to keep and to hallow the Sabbath day&#x2026;. Whosoever says the benediction and sanctification over the wine on the eves of Sabbaths.&#x201D; Jub. ii. 29, 30, should also be compared with <italic>P.R.E.</italic>, <italic>loc. cit.</italic></p>
<p>Both books protest against the exposure of the person; thus in Jub. iii. 31 and vii. 20 this ordinance is laid down in connection with Noah, whilst in our book, xxii. p. 160, this sin is one of the causes of the flood.</p>
<p>The offering brought by Noah, according to Jub. vi. 3, consisted of an ox, a goat, a sheep, kids, salt, a turtle-dove, and the young of a dove; in our book, xxiii. p. 171, this reappears as &#x201C;ox, a sheep, a turtle-dove, and pigeons.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Jub. vi. 17 f. lays great stress on the importance of the festival of Pentecost, even attributing its institution to Noah and the patriarchs; our book varies this by connecting the institution of Passover with Adam and the patriarchs (pp. 153, 236).</p>
<p>Jub. vi. 23&#x2013;29 dwells on the importance of the New Moon; this occurs also in our book, p. 410.</p>
<p>Jub. vii. 2, 35 ff., xvi. 20&#x2013;31, and xxi. 7&#x2013;17 refers to the age of the patriarchs various laws other than the seven precepts of the sons of Noah. This tendency is followed by our book, which mentions Sha&#x2019;atne&#x1E93; (p. 154; see Lev. xix. 19), Sabbath (p. 142), Habdalah (pp. 145 f.), and the wedding benediction (pp. 89 f.) in connection with the life of Adam.</p>
<p>Noah divides the earth among his three sons (Jub. viii. 11). Dr. Charles (<italic>in loc</italic>.) refers to Beer, who quotes <italic>P.R.E.</italic> xxiv. The actual text in Jub. viii. 11&#x2013;30 should be compared with the last paragraph in <italic>P.R.E.</italic> xxiii. (pp. 172 f.), which might reasonably be looked upon as a condensed version of the twenty verses in Jubilees. Thus the first sentence in <italic>P.R.E.</italic> (<italic>loc. cit.</italic>) reads: &#x201C;Noah brought his sons and <italic>his grandsons</italic>, and he blessed them with their (several) settlements, and he gave them as an inheritance all the earth.&#x201D; Jubilees (viii. 11) reads: &#x201C;And he called his sons, and they drew nigh to him, they and <italic>their children</italic>, and he divided the earth into the lots, which his three sons were to take in possession.&#x201D; Shem receives according to Jubilees (viii. 12) &#x201C;the middle of the earth,&#x201D; and according to <italic>P.R.E.</italic> (<italic>loc. cit.</italic>) he inherits &#x201C;the habitable land.&#x201D; Ham receives &#x201C;beyond the Gihon&#x2026; and it extends towards the west to the sea of &#x2019;At&#x00EA;l, and it extends&#x2026; till it reaches the sea of M&#x00E2;&#x2019;&#x00FB;k&#x201D; (Jub. viii. 22). Dr. Charles (<italic>in loc.</italic>) thinks that M&#x00E2;&#x2019;&#x00FB;k is a distortion of &#x2019;&#x03A9;<italic>&#x03BA;&#x03F5;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;&#x00F3;&#x03C2;</italic>, the great ocean stream. <italic>P.R.E.</italic> (<italic>loc. cit.</italic>) reads: &#x201C;He blessed Ham and his sons&#x2026; and he gave them as an inheritance the coast of the sea.&#x201D; Japhet&#x2019;s portion is Northern Asia, Europe, and five great islands (Jub. viii. 25&#x2013;29a); and according to <italic>P.R.E.</italic> (<italic>loc. cit.</italic>) he receives &#x201C;for an inheritance the desert and its fields.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Both books agree (Jub. xii. 26, <italic>P.R.E</italic>. p. 188) in saying that Abraham spoke Hebrew, the holy language of the Creation. In both books Satan (or Sammael in <italic>P.R.E</italic>., Mastema in Jubilees) plays a striking part, he is a chief or prince (see Jub. xvii. 16 and xlviii. 2, and <italic>P.R.E.</italic> p. 92). Jub. x. 11 identifies Satan and Mastema; a parallel to this section of Jubilees (x. 8&#x2013;11) is to be found in our book (p. 363 f.). According to Jub. iii. 17 the serpent alone was the cause of the fall of Eve; our author (p. 92), following other legends, describes Sammael as using the serpent in his plot against Eve. In Jub. xviii. 9, 12, Mastema is put to shame at the sacrifice of Isaac; this legend reappears in <italic>P.R.E.</italic> (pp. 228, 233 f.), according to which Sammael attempts to hinder Abraham.</p>
<p>The fundamental importance of circumcision is insisted upon in both books (Jub. xv. 11 ff. and <italic>P.R.E.</italic> xxix.), and they both refer to the serious neglect of the rite (Jub. xv. 33 f. and <italic>P.R.E.</italic> pp. 212 ff.). According to Jub. xv. 30&#x2013;32 and <italic>P.R.E.</italic> p. 177, Israel alone is subject to God, whilst the nations of the world are subject to the dominion of the angels. Both books, Jub. xvii. 17 and <italic>P.R.E.</italic> pp. 187 ff., refer to the ten trials of Abraham. Again, both books (Jub. xxi. 17; <italic>P.R.E.</italic> pp. 61, 212) lay stress on the duty of covering the blood with dust. They also agree (Jub. xxii. 16; <italic>P.R.E.</italic> pp. 208, 301) in ordaining restrictions as to the food of non-Jews. Isaac&#x2019;s oath to the Philistines (Jub. xxiv. 25,33) reappears in our book, pp. 278 f. Jub. xxxii. 2 f. has a close parallel in our book (p. 284), about the story of the choice of Levi as the tithe devoted to God.</p>
<p>There is considerable agreement in both books on Angelology and Demonology. Both books teach the eternal validity of the Law, older than creation and coming from the custody of the angels in heaven.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are many divergent teachings. We have already referred to the Calendar. According to Jub. i. 27 (see Charles&#x2019; ed. p. lxiv f.) an angel reveals the Law to Moses; our author (p. 320) opposes this doctrine, which was taught in Hellenistic Jewish and Christian circles (see LXX to Deut. xxxiii. 2 and Acts of the Apostles vii. 53, and cf. Josephus quoted in the Westminster N.T. ed. of Acts, <italic>loc. cit.</italic>). In <italic>P.R.E.</italic> (<italic>loc. cit.</italic> and pp. 324 f. and 327) God alone gives the Law, although myriads of ministering angels are present. Jub. ii. 2&#x2013;3 fixes the first day for the creation of the angels, our book (p. 20) gives the second day. According to Jub. ii. 7 the garden of Eden was created on the third day, whereas in our book (p. 11) it belongs to the premundane creation. Jub. iv. 15, 22, identifies the angels of the Lord who descended on the earth with the Watchers who sinned with the daughters of men. This interpretation of the &#x201C;sons of Elohim&#x201D; is accepted by our author (p. 160), who qualifies it by adding that the Israelites are also called &#x201C;sons of God&#x201D; (p. 161). Dr. Charles (<italic>Jubilees</italic>, pp. 33 ff., note 14) refers to the Christian interpretation of &#x201C;the sons of God&#x201D; as indicating &#x201C;the good among mankind, the descendants of Seth, and the daughters of men to be the descendants of Cain.&#x201D; Our author (p. 158 f.) tells us that, &#x201C;all the generations of the righteous arose from Seth,&#x201D; whereas &#x201C;from Cain arose and were descended all the generations of the wicked.&#x201D; Jub. v. 7 teaches that the sons of the angels who rebelled against God slew one another with the sword, but our author (p. 162) varies this by letting them perish in the flood. In Jub. xii. 14, Haran, the brother of Abraham, is burnt in the fire, whereas according to our book (p. 188) it is Abraham who is cast into the fire and rescued by Divine interposition.</p>
<p>In Jub. xix. 11 the marriage of Abraham with Keturah is spoken of as his third marriage, &#x201C;for Hagar had died before Sarah&#x201D;; this is contradicted by our author (p. 219), who identifies Keturah and Hagar. Jub. xxx. 2 ff. gives the praise of Simeon and Levi in connection with the punishment which they inflicted upon Shechem; this is omitted in our book (pp. 288 f.), which speaks of Jacob cursing the wrath of his sons, &#x201C;and he also cursed their sword in the Greek language&#x201D;; Jubilees (xxx. 25) adds, &#x201C;And he reproached them because they had put the city to the sword and he feared those who dwelt in the land.&#x201D; In Jub. xxxiv. 12, 18 f., the institution of the Day of Atonement is connected with the sale of Joseph; this view is controverted by our book (p. 204) by associating the Day with Abraham. In Jub. xxxviii. 2, Jacob is represented as slaying Esau; our author (p. 809) varies this tradition by referring the incident to the action of Chushim, the son of Dan, a deaf mute, on the occasion of the burial of Jacob. Jub. xl. 10 rejects the legend which formed the basis of the Hellenistic Jewish romance dealing with the history of Asenath (see Hastings&#x2019; <italic>Bible Dict.</italic> i. 162), according to which Asenath was of the house of Israel; our book (pp. 272 f., 287 f.) adopts this legend, and states that she was the daughter of Dinah. Our book differs from Jubilees by omitting the sins of Reuben and Judah and by enunciating the doctrine of the resurrection. There are many other points of connection between the two books, some of which will be indicated in the notes.</p>
<p>The most valuable contribution to the study of Jubilees in its relation to the Midrashim is B. Beer&#x2019;s <italic>Das Buch der Jubil&#x00E4;en</italic> (1856). This was amplified by a second essay by the same author. These important pioneer works are indispensable. Dr. Marmorstein has a chapter on &#x201C;Jubilees and Pal. Targum&#x201D; in his <italic>Studien zum Pseud-Jonathan Targum</italic> (1905), pp. 22&#x2013;26. Dr. Kohler&#x2019;s article on Jubilees in <italic>J.E.</italic> vii. pp. 801 ff. should also be consulted in this connection.</p>
<p>Ethiopic Enoch, usually known as 1 Enoch, also contains many ideas which seem to be repeated or reflected in our book. The notes contain the references to many of these similar thoughts. Some of the most interesting points of contact are the following:</p>
<p>1 Enoch vi. 2: &#x201C;The angels&#x201D; are &#x201C;the children of heaven&#x201D;; cf. <italic>P.R.E.</italic> p. 161: &#x201C;Whilst they (the angels) were still in their holy place in heaven, these were called <italic>the sons of God</italic>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x2014; vi. 4: &#x201C;Let us all swear an oath and all bind ourselves by mutual imprecations,&#x201D; cf. <italic>P.R.E.</italic> (p. 298), which reads: &#x201C;Let us swear among ourselves&#x2026; and they proclaimed the ban&#x201D; (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D7;&#x05E8;&#x05DD;</span>).</p>
<p>&#x2014; vii. 1&#x2013;5: &#x201C;And all the others together with them took unto themselves wives&#x2026; and they began to go in unto them&#x2026; and they bare great giants&#x2026; who consumed all the acquisitions of men. The giants turned against them and devoured mankind&#x2026; and drunk the blood.&#x201D; Cf. <italic>P.R.E.</italic> (pp. 160 f.): &#x201C;The angels&#x2026; took wives from amongst them&#x2026; from them were born the giants&#x2026; who stretched forth their hands to all (kinds of) robbery and violence, and shedding of blood.&#x201D;</p>
<p>1 Enoch viii. 1, 2: &#x201C;And the beautifying of the eyelids&#x2026; and they committed fornication, and they were led astray&#x201D;; cf. <italic>P.R.E.</italic> (p. 160): &#x201C;their eyes painted like harlots, and they went astray after them.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x2014; ix. 1: &#x201C;Michael, Uriel, Raphael, and Gabriel&#x201D;; cf. <italic>P.R.E.</italic> (p. 22): &#x201C;Michael&#x2026; Gabriel&#x2026; Uriel&#x2026; and Raphael.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x2014; ix. 1, 2 and x. 2: &#x201C;Much blood being shed upon the earth, and all lawlessness being wrought upon the earth&#x2026;. The earth made without inhabitant cries the voice of their crying up to the gates of heaven&#x2026; and a deluge is about to come&#x201D;; cf. <italic>P.R.E</italic>., <italic>loc. cit.</italic> and also p. 162: &#x201C;Behold, we will restrain ourselves from multiplying and increasing, so as not to produce the offspring of the children of men&#x2026;. They said, If He bring from heaven the waters of the flood.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x2014; x. 4: &#x201C;Bind Azazel&#x2026; and make an opening in the desert&#x2026; and cast him therein&#x201D;; cf. <italic>P.R.E.</italic> p. 363: &#x201C;and the lot for Azazel was the goat as a sin offering&#x201D; (cf. Charles&#x2019; note on p. 22 of <italic>Jubilees</italic>).</p>
<p>&#x2014; xii. 4 (and cf. xv. 3): &#x201C;The Watchers of the heaven who have left the high heaven, the holy eternal place&#x201D;; cf. <italic>P.R.E.</italic> p. 160: &#x201C;The angels who fell from their holy place in heaven,&#x201D; cf. <italic>ibid.</italic> pp. 46, 92, and 194.</p>
<p>&#x2014; xiv. 9 ff.: &#x201C;Crystals&#x2026; and fiery cherubim between them, (that house) was hot as fire and cold as ice&#x2026; fear covered me and tremblings gat hold upon me&#x2026; and I looked and saw therein a lofty throne, its appearance was as crystal, and the wheels thereof as the shining sun, and there was the vision of the Cherubim. And from underneath the throne came streams of flaming fire so that I could not look thereon. And the Great Glory sat thereon. None of the angels could enter and could behold His face&#x2026;. The flaming fire was round about Him&#x2026; ten thousand times ten thousand (angels stood) before Him.&#x201D; Cf. <italic>P.R.E.</italic>, Chapter IV. (pp. 21&#x2013;25), where we read of the &#x201C;crystal&#x2026; and the fiery ministering angels and the Shekhinah of the Holy One&#x2026; sitting on a throne high and exalted. The appearance of His <italic>Glory</italic> is like the colour of amber (or crystal). One half (of His Glory) is fire and the other half is hail&#x2026; and a veil is spread before Him, and the seven angels&#x2026; minister before Him&#x2026;. Fire is flashing continually around His throne, and the Chajj&#x00F4;th (around the throne)&#x2026; are the Cherubim&#x2026; the whirling wheels of the Chariot, lightnings&#x2026; go forth&#x2026;. The Chajj&#x00F4;th&#x2026; do not know the place of His Glory&#x2026; a river of fire arises and goes forth before Him&#x2026;. The Seraphim&#x2026; cover their face so as not to behold the presence of the Shekhinah.&#x201D;</p>
<p>1 Enoch xvii. 5 refers to the river of fire, cf. <italic>P.R.E</italic>. pp. 25 and 412.</p>
<p>&#x2014; xviii. 2: &#x201C;And I saw the Corner Stone of the Earth,&#x201D; cf. <italic>P.R.E.</italic> p. 71: &#x201C;and he saw there the Foundation Stone,&#x201D; and cf. <italic>ibid.</italic> p. 266.</p>
<p>&#x2014; xviii. 5: &#x201C;The firmament of the heaven above,&#x201D; cf. <italic>P.R.E.</italic> p. 21: &#x201C;The firmament which is above the head of the four Chajj&#x00F4;th.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x2014; xviii. 8: &#x201C;And the summit of the throne was of sapphire,&#x201D; cf. <italic>P.R.E.</italic> p. 23: &#x201C;And the likeness of His throne is like a sapphire throne.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x2014; xx. 2&#x2013;8: here the Seven Archangels are mentioned; <italic>P.R.E.</italic> p. 23 refers to &#x201C;the seven angels, which were created first, (who) minister before God.&#x201D; Four of these seven angels mentioned in 1 Enoch are Uriel, Raphael, Michael, and Gabriel; these four names occur also in <italic>P.R.E.</italic> p. 22; cf. also 1 Enoch xl. 9.</p>
<p>&#x2014; xxv. 5: &#x201C;Its fruit shall be good for the elect: it shall be transplanted to the holy place, to the temple of the Lord,&#x201D; cf. <italic>P.R.E.</italic> p. 418 f.</p>

<p>Dr. Ginzberg&#x2019;s article on the Book of Adam and Eve in the first volume of the <italic>Jewish Encyclopedia</italic> should be read, and the notes on the Books of Adam and Eve in <italic>A. and P.</italic> ii. might be consulted. Many of the references to similar phrases and ideas given in this Introduction are not repeated in the notes to <italic>P.R.E.</italic></p>
<p>The Apocalypse of Abraham (see <italic>P.R.E.</italic> pp. 70,76) should also be read as a side-light to our book. Thus, the interpretation of &#x201C;Ur of the Chaldees&#x201D; as the fire of the Chaldees is common to both. The attempt of Azazel to disturb Abraham when offering his sacrifice to God is somewhat similar to the attempt of Sammael to hinder Abraham&#x2019;s sacrifice of the ram instead of Isaac. The &#x201C;unclean bird&#x201D; which swoops down upon the carcasses, as well as &#x201C;the vision&#x201D; of Abraham between the pieces, beholding the world in its future career, reappear in our book. Both writings refer to the Divine throne and the Cherubim as well as to the revelation of the secrets of the deep (Leviathan). Sammael (or Azazel) had twelve wings according to our book and the Apocalypse. Dr. Ginzberg, in his interesting article on the Apocalypse in the <italic>J.E.</italic> i. 92, refers to Chapters IX., XIII., XX., XXI., and XXVIII. of the <italic>Pir&#x1E33;&#x00EA; de Rabbi Eliezer.</italic></p>

<p>We have by no means exhausted the material in the foregoing paragraphs. Such books as <italic>Schatzh&#x00F6;hle, Kebra Nagast</italic>, and the Book of the Bee, not to mention the Koran and its famous commentaries, contain much material in common with our &#x201C;Chapters.&#x201D; Philo and Ecclesiasticus also offer several interesting parallels.</p>
<p>It is not by any means definitely established that our author actually copied any of the afore-mentioned books. What is maintained, however, is the existence of some sort of literary connection between <italic>P.R.E.</italic> and these books. This may be explained by the existence of compositions based on the Pseudepigrapha or used by the authors of this class of literature. The link is missing and it would be extremely hazardous to do more than point out the existence of similar ideas and occasionally actual parallel phrases. It must not be forgotten that many of the ideas common to the Midrashim and the Pseudepigrapha were, so to say, common property, floating traditions which were recorded not only in Enoch or Jubilees, but also in the Books of Adam and Eve, and later in our book, and later still in such compositions as the Book of the Bee.</p>
<p>One lesson seems to be driven home from our study, and that is the impossibility of properly understanding the Apocryphal and Pseudepigraphic writings without the assistance of the teaching of Rabbinics. So also <italic>vice versa</italic>, we must illustrate Rabbinical literature by the teaching of the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha.</p>
<h1>&#x00A7; 6. <italic>P.R.E.</italic> <small>AND</small> P<small>ATRISTIC</small> L<small>ITERATURE</small></h1>
<p>Ginzberg, Goldfahn, Graetz, Kohler, Rahmer, and others have discussed various aspects of Patristic literature in connection with Midrashic teaching. This field of inquiry is by no means exhausted. Very many interesting parallels to some of the teaching in our &#x201C;Chapters&#x201D; are to be found in the writings of the Church Fathers. It would be advantageous to read the Patristic literature in the light of Midrashic exegesis and interpretation and <italic>vice versa</italic>. One or two instances will explain this standpoint.</p>
<p><italic>The Statutes of the Apostles</italic> (ed. Horner), &#x00A7; 70, p. 215, direct that &#x201C;seven days should be kept for a memorial of the living and the dead.&#x201D; This rule will be appreciated if compared with the Jewish institution of the &#x201C;seven days of mourning&#x201D; (see <italic>P.R.E</italic>. p. 115). Again, the 48th statute directs prayers to be said five times daily (<italic>op. cit.</italic> pp. 182 f.). This rule should be illustrated by the Rabbinic custom of praying thrice daily (see <italic>P.R.E.</italic> p. 110).</p>
<p>Vorstius and many scholars after him have not disguised their profound contempt for the legends contained in our &#x201C;Chapters&#x201D; and in other Midrashic writings. This attitude must give place to a more sympathetic understanding of the fact that Midrash exists not only in the works of the Rabbis but also in the New Testament and in Patristic literature. Many legends preserved in our &#x201C;Chapters&#x201D; are also to be found in the interesting volumes of the &#x201C;Ante-Nicene Christian Library.&#x201D; Many of these parallels are mentioned in the notes to our &#x201C;Chapters.&#x201D;</p>
<h1>&#x00A7; 7. D<small>ATE AND</small> O<small>RIGIN OF</small> <italic>P.R.E</italic>.</h1>
<p>A few historical and literary clues, disclosed by a careful study of our book, enable us to fix the date of its final redaction. This is probably either the second or the third decade of the ninth century. This late date does not, however, indicate that most of the material at the disposal of the redactor did not belong to a much earlier period. We have already mentioned 776 <small>C.E.</small> in connection with the <italic>Baraitha de R. Sh&#x2019;muel</italic>, and if this treatise proved to be an independent work, which has been partially incorporated into our book, we can safely assert that the three astronomical chapters belong to a date at least half a century prior to the final redaction of the book. The Creation legends, which go back to the Books of Enoch and Jubilees as well as to the Books of Adam and Eve, contain material which is earlier than the first century <small>C.E.</small> Again, the legends dealing with the Flood have elements in common with traditions preserved by Hippolytus, whose activity was in the first decades of the third century (<italic>c</italic>. 200&#x2013;236). Jean Gagnier, who was at Oxford in the eighteenth century, drew attention to a parallel in Hippolytus to <italic>P.R.E</italic>., duly noted by Fabricius in his stately edition of the writings of the Church Father.</p>
<p>Scholars are by no means agreed as to the locality whence <italic>P.R.E.</italic> emanated. The latest opinion is that of Dr. Samuel Krauss, who refers to it as a Byzantine production, see <italic>Studien zur Byzantinisch-J&#x00FC;dischen Geschichte</italic> (1914), pp. 145 f. M. Gr&#x00FC;nbaum in his learned book, <italic>Neue Beitr&#x00E4;ge zur Semitischen Sagenkunde</italic> (1893), inclines to the view that <italic>P.R.E.</italic> was written in an Arabian atmosphere. There are clear indications of contact with Mohammedan material (cf. <italic>P.R.E.</italic> xxx.), the names Fatimah (p. 219) and &#x2018;Ayeshah (p. 218) as wives of Ishmael occur and betray Islamic influence. In Chapter XXX. (pp. 221 f.) two brothers who are reigning simultaneously are indicated; Graetz has long ago pointed to this passage as referring to the two sons of Harun al-Rashid, Alemin and Elmamum, who ruled in the early years of the ninth century. M&#x00FC;ller has drawn attention to the Minhagim or religious customs which are peculiar to our book, and as a result of his investigation he is of opinion that <italic>P.R.E.</italic> is a Palestinian production. There are many subsidiary points which seem to support this view. The fact already mentioned, that the direct quotations from the Talmud are only from the Palestinian recension; and the use made of another Palestinian work, Genesis Rabbah, seem to support a Palestinian origin. There are striking references to the Holy Land, its privileges and superiority, which point to a Palestinian authorship. On the other hand, there are reasons for regarding Babylon as the home of <italic>P.R.E.</italic> Dr. B&#x00FC;chler&#x2019;s studies dealing with the ban, which will be quoted in the notes (pp. 301 f.), seem to point to Babylon as the source whence our book came. Other lines of inquiry, <italic>e.g.</italic> the punishment inflicted on a woman guilty of immorality (see p. 100), point in the same direction. It is extremely difficult to decide in a question of this kind, especially when eminent authorities hold such divergent views. It is right to point out that the views of Graetz referred to on pp. 221 f. have been refuted by Steinschneider (see note on p. 222). Likewise his theory (<italic>Geschichte</italic>, v. p. 446) that our book in Chapter XXX. is indebted to the Secrets of R. Simeon ben Jochai in connection with the misrule of the Ishmaelites, has been controverted by Horowitz, <italic>Beth &#x2018;E&#x1E33;ed Ha-Hagadoth</italic>, p. 24. Both, however, agree that the date of the composition of our book is about 750 <small>C.E.</small></p>
<h1>&#x00A7; 8. P<small>OLEMICAL</small> T<small>ENDENCY IN</small> <italic>P.R.E.</italic></h1>
<p>Apparently there is no direct reference to Christianity. On the other hand, there are several allusions to Islam as the &#x201C;Fourth Kingdom&#x201D; destined to persecute the Chosen People prior to the dawn of the Messianic Kingdom. There are also several echoes from the old controversies which the ancient teachers in Israel waged against the Gnostics (cf. pp. 17, 79 f.). One of the set purposes of part of the work is to combat certain teachings contained in some of the Pseudepigrapha, especially in the Book of Jubilees. It is noteworthy that the Cairo Geni&#x1E93;ah has restored to us Aramaic fragments based on the Book of Jubilees and also on the Testaments of the XII Patriarchs. The &#x1E92;ohar refers to a book of Enoch (Lev. 10a) which seems to have been in Aramaic. We believe we have established the fact that there is close connection between our &#x201C;Chapters&#x201D; and the afore-mentioned pseudepigraphic books.</p>
<p>Our author lays great stress on the doctrine of the resurrection of the body (cf. pp. 228, 249 f.). This may be directed against the teaching set forth in many of the pseudepigraphic and apocryphal books, which deny the physical resurrection.</p>
<p>On page 254 he opposes, as the Talmud, the destruction of fruit-bearing trees (see Krauss in <span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05E9;&#x05D9;&#x05DC;&#x05D7;</span>, 1908, xix. 28 ff.; and <italic>T.A</italic>. ii. p. 205).</p>
<p>There may be a polemical interest in the description of the Teraphim (pp. 273 f.), possibly the worship of relics is attacked here. The belief in the possibility of the Deity having physical offspring (see p. 85, note 10) is opposed. Celibacy (p. 89, note 2) seems to be regarded with disfavour, and possibly divorce (see p. 219) is likewise disapproved.</p>
<h1>&#x00A7; 9. T<small>HEOLOGY OF</small> <italic>P.R.E</italic>.</h1>
<p>The note struck in the first two chapters, proclaiming the supreme value of the Torah, the Law of God, is in harmony with the teaching in the rest of the book. The Law belongs to the premundane creation (p. 11), it was with God at the Creation (p. 12), even consulted by the Divine Architect when He was planning the Universe (<italic>ibid.</italic>) and creating man (p. 76). The Torah had its home in heaven and was entrusted to Israel because the other nations refused to accept its teaching (p. 319). Some of the precepts of the Torah were kept in heaven by God and the Angels (pp. 137 f.), and also by Adam and the patriarchs (pp. 126, 143, 204) prior to the revelation on Sinai.</p>
<p>The love or goodness of God impelled Him to the creation of man (p. 76). The belief in original sin is not countenanced (pp. 158 f.). Moral evil was brought into the world by Sammael (p. 158) and the offspring of the fallen angels (pp. 160 f.). The angelology in our book is interesting on account of its connection with the Pseudepigrapha. Michael, Sammael (with whom Azazel is identified), demons and merciful angels, the fall of the angels, Cherubim, Chajj&#x00F4;th, Seraphim, and the heavenly host, are all dealt with. The Index will enable the reader to find our author&#x2019;s views on this theme.</p>
<p>The ethical tone is excellently expressed in the chapter on the Two Ways (pp. 102 f.). The duty of loving service is set forth in two chapters (pp. 106 ff.) and in many passages throughout the book. The sacredness of human life (pp. 176, 386) is emphasized. The day of judgment and retribution is not forgotten (p. 416). The value of repentance is dealt with in a special chapter (pp. 337 ff.). There are chapters devoted to eschatology (pp. 410 ff.) and the resurrection (pp. 252 ff.). For references to God, Shekhinah, the Divine throne, Messiah, Leviathan and Behemoth, Gehenna and Paradise, the future world and death, the reader can consult the Index.</p>
<p>The quotations from the O.T. are given according to the chapters and verses in the Revised Version. This translation has frequently been modified in order to express the Haggadic interpretation of our author. The quotations in the original are rarely given in full, but in order to understand the teaching in question the entire verse should be read. To facilitate reference the source of every Biblical quotation is given, a labour already done by Vorstius and Luria. The headings at the head of each chapter have been added by the present writer. Most of the printed editions contain a summary of the contents of each chapter. The method of transliteration adopted has not been uniformly followed, especially when a name is well known by reason of appearing in the Revised Version, <italic>e.g.</italic> Eliezer. The R.V. names have generally been retained. The letter <span dir="rtl">&#x05D7;</span> is represented by <italic>ch</italic>, <span dir="rtl">&#x05D8;</span> by <italic>&#x1E6D;</italic>, <span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;</span> by <italic>kh</italic>, <span dir="rtl">&#xFB3B;</span> by <italic>k</italic>, <span dir="rtl">&#x05E7;</span> by <italic>&#x1E33;</italic>, <span dir="rtl">&#x05D6;</span> by <italic>&#x1E93;</italic>, <span dir="rtl">&#x05E6;</span> by <italic>z</italic>, <span dir="rtl">&#x05E2;</span> by &#x2018;.</p>

<h1><small>RABBI ELIEZER AND THE TORAH</small><sup><xref rid="fn4">2</xref></sup> [1<small>B</small>. i.]</h1>
<p>T<small>HE</small> following befell Rabbi Eliezer, son of Hyr&#x1E33;anos. His father had many ploughmen<sup><xref rid="fn5">3</xref></sup> who were ploughing arable ground,<sup><xref rid="fn6">4</xref></sup> whereas he was ploughing a stony plot; he sat down and wept. His father said to him: O my son&#x0021; Why dost thou weep? Art thou perchance distressed because thou dost plough a stony plot? In the past thou hast ploughed a stony plot,<sup><xref rid="fn7">1</xref></sup> now behold thou shalt plough with us arable soil.<sup><xref rid="fn8">2</xref></sup> He sat down on the arable ground and wept. His father said to him: But why dost thou weep? Art thou perchance distressed because thou art ploughing the arable land? He replied to him: No. (Hyr&#x1E33;anos) said to him: Why dost thou weep? He answered him: I weep only because I desire to learn Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn9">3</xref></sup> (Hyr&#x1E33;anos) said to him: Verily thou art twenty-eight years old<sup><xref rid="fn10">4</xref></sup>&#x2014;yet dost thou desire to learn Torah? Nay, go, take thee a wife and beget sons and thou wilt take them to the school.<sup><xref rid="fn11">5</xref></sup> He fasted two weeks<sup><xref rid="fn12">6</xref></sup> not tasting &#x007C;&#x007C; anything, until Elijah<sup><xref rid="fn13">7</xref></sup>&#x2014; may he be remembered for good<sup><xref rid="fn14">8</xref></sup>&#x2014;appeared to him and said to him: Son of Hyr&#x1E33;anos&#x0021; Why dost thou weep? He replied to him: Because I desire to learn Torah. (Elijah) said to him: If thou desirest to learn Torah get thee up to Jerusalem to Rabban Jochanan ben &#x1E92;akkai.<sup><xref rid="fn15">9</xref></sup> He arose and went up to Jerusalem to R. Jochanan ben &#x1E92;akkai and sat down and wept. (R. Jochanan) said to him: Why dost thou weep? He answered him: Because I wish to learn Torah. (R. Jochanan) said to him: Whose son art thou? But he did not tell him.</p>
<p>(R. Jochanan) asked him: Hast thou never learnt<sup><xref rid="fn16">1</xref></sup> to read the Shema&#x2018;,<sup><xref rid="fn17">2</xref></sup> or the Tephillah,<sup><xref rid="fn18">3</xref></sup> or the Grace after meals?<sup><xref rid="fn19">4</xref></sup> He replied to him: No. He arose<sup><xref rid="fn20">5</xref></sup> and (R. Jochanan) taught him the three (prayers).<sup><xref rid="fn21">6</xref></sup> (Again) he sat down and wept. (R. Jochanan) said to him: My son, why dost thou weep? He replied: Because I desire to learn Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn22">7</xref></sup> He (thereupon) taught him two rules (of the Law)<sup><xref rid="fn23">8</xref></sup> every day of the week, and on the Sabbath<sup><xref rid="fn24">9</xref></sup> (Eliezer) repeated them and assimilated them.<sup><xref rid="fn25">10</xref></sup> He kept a fast for eight days without tasting anything until the odour of his mouth attracted the attention of R. Jochanan ben &#x1E92;akkai, who directed him to withdraw from his presence. He sat down and wept. (R. Jochanan) said to him: My son, why dost thou weep? He rejoined: Because thou didst make me withdraw from thy presence just as a man makes his fellow withdraw, when the latter is afflicted with leprosy. (R. Jochanan) said to him: My son, just as &#x007C;&#x007C; the odour of thy mouth has ascended before me, so may the savour of the statutes of the Torah ascend from thy mouth to Heaven.<sup><xref rid="fn26">11</xref></sup> He said to him: My son&#x0021; Whose son art thou? He replied: I am the son of Hyr&#x1E33;anos. Then said (R. Jochanan): Art thou not the son of one of the great men of the world,<sup><xref rid="fn27">1</xref></sup> and thou didst not tell me? By thy life&#x0021; he continued, This day shalt thou eat with me.<sup><xref rid="fn28">2</xref></sup> (Eliezer) answered: I have eaten already with my host.<sup><xref rid="fn29">3</xref></sup> (R. Jochanan) asked: Who is thy host? He replied: R. Joshua ben Chananjah<sup><xref rid="fn30">4</xref></sup> and R. Jos&#x00E9; the Priest.<sup><xref rid="fn31">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>(R. Jochanan) sent to inquire of his hosts, saying to them: Did Eliezer eat with you this day? They answered: No; moreover has he not fasted eight days without tasting any food?<sup><xref rid="fn32">6</xref></sup> R. Joshua ben Chananjah and R. Jos&#x00E9; the Priest<sup><xref rid="fn33">7</xref></sup> went and said<sup><xref rid="fn34">8</xref></sup> to R. Jochanan ben &#x1E33;akkai: Verily during the last eight days (Eliezer) has not partaken of any food.<sup><xref rid="fn35">9</xref></sup></p>

The third chapter opens with the name of Rabbi Eliezer. The MS. fragment of our book in the British Museum which Horowitz has edited in his <italic>Sammlung Kleiner Midraschim,</italic> i. 4 ff., begins with the third chapter.

Our &#x201C;Chapters&#x201D; contain about twenty dicta attributed to R. Eliezer; see Bacher, <italic>op. cit.</italic> pp. 122 f., who considers all these sayings as pseudepigraphic. The subject-matter of the first two chapters of our book is to be found in Aboth d. R. Nathan (<italic>a</italic>) vi., (<italic>b</italic>) xiii., Jal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D;, Gen. &#x00A7;72, and Gen.

<h1><small>R. ELIEZER AND HIS BRETHREN</small> [2<small>A</small>. i.]</h1>
<p>T<small>HE</small> sons of Hyr&#x1E33;anos said to their father: Get thee up to Jerusalem and vow that thy son Eliezer should not enjoy any of thy possessions.<sup><xref rid="fn36">1</xref></sup> He went up to Jerusalem to disinherit him, and it happened that a festival was being celebrated there by R. Jochanan ben &#x1E92;akkai. All the magnates of the district were dining with him; (such as) Ben Zizith Hakkeseth,<sup><xref rid="fn37">2</xref></sup> Nicodemus ben Gorion,<sup><xref rid="fn38">3</xref></sup> and Ben Kalba S&#x2019;bu&#x2018;a.<sup><xref rid="fn39">4</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C;</p>
<p>Why was his name called Ben Zizith Hakkeseth? Because he reclined at table in a higher position than the other magnates of Jerusalem.<sup><xref rid="fn40">5</xref></sup> Concerning Nicodemus ben Gorion, people said that he had (stored) provisions containing 3 S&#x2019;ah<sup><xref rid="fn41">6</xref></sup> of fine flour for every inhabitant of Jerusalem. When the zealots<sup><xref rid="fn42">1</xref></sup> arose and burnt all the storehouses, they measured and found that he had had provisions for three years for every inhabitant in Jerusalem.<sup><xref rid="fn43">2</xref></sup> Concerning Ben Kalba S&#x2019;bua it was told that he had a house measuring 4 Kors<sup><xref rid="fn44">3</xref></sup> with roofs covered with gold.<sup><xref rid="fn45">4</xref></sup> The people said (to R. Jochanan): Behold, the father of R. Eliezer has arrived. He bade them saying: Prepare a place for him, and seat him next to us.<sup><xref rid="fn46">5</xref></sup> (R. Jochanan) fixed his gaze<sup><xref rid="fn47">6</xref></sup> on R. Eliezer, saying to him,<sup><xref rid="fn48">7</xref></sup> Tell us some words<sup><xref rid="fn49">8</xref></sup> of the Torah. (R. Eliezer) answered him saying: Rabbi&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn50">9</xref></sup> I will tell thee a parable. To what is the matter like? To this well which cannot yield more water than the amount which it has drawn (from the earth); likewise am I unable to speak words of the Torah in excess of what I have received from thee.<sup><xref rid="fn51">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>(R. Jochanan) said to him, I will (also) tell thee a parable. To what is the matter like? To this fountain which is bubbling and sending forth its water, and it is able to effect a discharge more powerful &#x007C;&#x007C; than what it secretes; in like manner art thou able to speak words of the Torah in excess of what Moses<sup><xref rid="fn52">11</xref></sup> received at Sinai. (R. Jochanan) continued: Lest thou shouldst feel ashamed on my account, behold I will arise and go away from thee. Rabban Jochanan ben &#x1E92;akkai arose and went outside. (Thereupon) R. Eliezer sat down and expounded.<sup><xref rid="fn53">1</xref></sup> His face shone like the light of the sun and his effulgence beamed forth like that of Moses,<sup><xref rid="fn54">2</xref></sup> so that no one knew whether it was day or night.<sup><xref rid="fn55">3</xref></sup> They went and said to Rabban Jochanan ben &#x1E92;akkai: Come and see R. Eliezer sitting and expounding, his face shining like the light of the sun and his effulgence beaming like that of Moses, so that no one knows whether it be day or night.<sup><xref rid="fn56">4</xref></sup> He came from (his place) behind him<sup><xref rid="fn57">5</xref></sup> and kissed him on his head, saying to him: Happy are ye, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because this one has come forth from your loins.</p>
<p>Hyr&#x1E33;anos his father said: To whom does (R. Jochanan) speak thus? The people answered: To Eliezer thy son. He said to them: (R. Jochanan) should not have spoken in that manner, but (in this wise), &#x201C;Happy am I because he has come forth from my loins.&#x201D; Whilst R. Eliezer was sitting and expounding, his father was standing upon his feet. When &#x007C;&#x007C; (Eliezer) saw his father standing upon his feet, he became agitated and said to him: My father&#x0021; be seated, for I cannot utter the words of the Torah when thou art standing on thy feet.<sup><xref rid="fn58">6</xref></sup> (Hyr&#x1E33;anos) replied to him: My son, it was not for this reason that I came, but my intention was to disinherit thee. Now that I have come and I have witnessed all this praise; behold thy brothers are disinherited and their portion is given to thee as a gift.<sup><xref rid="fn59">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Eliezer) replied: Verily I am not equal to one of them.<sup><xref rid="fn60">2</xref></sup> If I had asked the Holy One, blessed be He, for land, it would be possible for Him to give this to me, as it is said, &#x201C;The earth is the Lord&#x2019;s, and the fulness thereof&#x201D; (Ps. xxiv. 1). Had I asked the Holy One, blessed be He, for silver and gold, He could have given them to me, as it is said, &#x201C;The silver is mine, and the gold is mine&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn61">3</xref></sup> (Hag. ii. 8). But I asked the Holy One, blessed be He, that I might be worthy (to learn the) Torah only, as it is said, &#x201C;Therefore I esteem all precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way&#x201D; (Ps. cxix. 128).</p>
<ftnote id="fn36"><sup>1</sup> Lit. &#x201C;and ban thy son Eliezer from thy possessions.&#x201D; The Geni&#x1E93;ah Fragment reads: &#x201C;to put him in the ban.&#x201D; The brothers claimed that Eliezer should be disinherited because he had left his old father without permission. For a parallel text see Gen. Rab. xlii. (ed. Theodor, p. 398), Aboth d. R. Nathan (<italic>a</italic>) vi. Was it the custom to resort to the Synhedrion in order to disinherit one&#x2019;s son?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn37"><sup>2</sup> See Lam. Rab. i. 5 (31), Eccles. Rab. to Eccles. vii. 11, and T.B. Gi&#x1E6D;&#x1E6D;in, 56a. According to the Talmud (<italic>loc. cit</italic>.) the name Ben Zizith Hakkeseth was due to his intercourse (<italic>Kis&#x00EA;, i.e.</italic> seat) with the great men of Rome.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn38"><sup>3</sup> See <italic>J.E.</italic> ix. 300, where the reference to T.B. Ta&#x2018;anith should be emended to 20a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn39"><sup>4</sup> Ben Kalba S&#x2019;bu&#x2018;a, this name is the result of a pun. According to T.B. Gi&#x1E6D;&#x1E6D;in, <italic>loc. cit.,</italic> anyone who came to him even as hungry as a dog (<italic>keleb</italic>) was dismissed fully satisfied (<italic>sab&#x2018;a</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn40"><sup>5</sup> T.B. Gi&#x1E6D;&#x1E6D;in, <italic>loc. cit.,</italic> gives another explanation of this name, due to the tradition that the fringes (<italic>Zizith</italic>) of the man&#x2019;s garments were hanging over the cushions of his seat. The Arukh (ed. Kohut, vii. 40a, <italic>s.v.</italic>) appears to have had a text of our passage in accordance with the Talmudic reading, but unlike our text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn41"><sup>6</sup> S&#x2019;ah, a dry measure, the size of which is held to equal 12 148 litres or 10 696 qts. The Geni&#x1E93;ah Fragment reads &#x201C;three years&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;three S&#x2019;ah.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn42"><sup>1</sup> On the Zealots or Sicarii see Josephus, <italic>Wars,</italic> iv. 3. 9 ff.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn43"><sup>2</sup> This passage is missing in the printed editions, but it occurs in the Geni&#x1E93;ah Fragment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn44"><sup>3</sup> The Kor is assumed by Gesenius (Oxford ed. p. 499) to be the same as the Chomer, which was thirty times the S&#x2019;ah. On these measures see <italic>Enc. Bib.</italic> iv. 5294 ff.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn45"><sup>4</sup> The first printed editions read: &#x201C;gardens crushed with gold.&#x201D; Luria reads: &#x201C;he had a palace with an area covering 4 Kors, all the beams were overlaid with gold.&#x201D; He thinks that the text should read: &#x201C;he had a palace covering 4 Kors with treasuries containing gold.&#x201D; The MS. seems to have preserved the true reading, which is also the reading in the Geni&#x1E93;ah Fragment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn46"><sup>5</sup> The 1st and 2nd eds. read: &#x201C;They prepared a place for him and seated him next to him&#x201D; (<italic>i.e</italic>. R. Jochanan). The Geni&#x1E93;ah Fragment reads: &#x201C;and seat him next to yourselves; they prepared a place for him and placed him next to him&#x201D; (R. Jochanan). In the MS. the first paragraph ends here.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn47"><sup>6</sup> For this expression see T.B. Synhedrin, 11a: &#x201C;the sages fixed their gaze upon Hillel the Elder.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn48"><sup>7</sup> The Geni&#x1E93;ah Fragment adds: &#x201C;O my son&#x0021;&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn49"><sup>8</sup> Lit. &#x201C;One word.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn50"><sup>9</sup> Perhaps &#x201C;Rabban&#x201D; would be more correct. The MS. uses an abbreviation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn51"><sup>10</sup> See Aboth ii. 10, where Eliezer is described as a &#x201C;plastered cistern which loses not a drop,&#x201D; and cf. Taylor&#x2019;s note on p. 34 of his (2nd) edition of Aboth. The second paragraph ends here in the MS.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn52"><sup>11</sup> The 1st and 2nd eds. read, &#x201C;they received.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn53"><sup>1</sup> According to Gen. Rab. <small>XLII.</small> i., the text of Eliezer&#x2019;s exposition was Ps. xxxvii. 14, &#x201C;The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow; to cast down the poor and needy, to slay such as be upright in the way.&#x201D; The brothers of Eliezer might possibly be described in the terms of this text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn54"><sup>2</sup> The reference is to Ex. xxxiv. 35, &#x201C;And the skin of Moses&#x2019; face shone.&#x201D; See also Eccles. viii. 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn55"><sup>3</sup> The third paragraph ends here.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn56"><sup>4</sup> This sentence is wanting in the printed editions. There seems to be some confusion in the text. The MS. concludes here the fourth paragraph.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn57"><sup>5</sup> According to Aboth d. R. Nathan (<italic>b</italic>) xiii. R. Jochanan had gone forth from the assembly so as not to embarrass R. Eliezer. While Eliezer is expounding. R. Joshua and R. Simeon ben Nathaniel leave the assembly to find R. Jochanan, to whom they say, &#x201C;Come and see&#x0021; R. Eliezer is sitting and expounding things more profoundly than (the things) told to Moses at Sinai.&#x201D; For another instance of kissing by the same teacher see T.B. Chagigah, 14b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn58"><sup>6</sup> It would be disrespectful for a son to sit in the presence of his parent, who would be standing; cf. T.B. &#x1E92;iddushin, 33b, where this theme is discussed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn59"><sup>1</sup> The fifth paragraph ends here in the MS.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn60"><sup>2</sup> This section to the end of the chapter is to be found in Jal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D; Makhiri to Psalms (Ps. cxix.), &#x00A7; 77, with slight variations in the reading. The last sentence reads: &#x201C;But I prayed to Him only that I might be found worthy, as it is said, &#x2018;Therefore I esteem all precepts,&#x2019;&#x201D; etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn61"><sup>3</sup> The 1st ed. and subsequent editions continue the rest of the verse, but a strange error has crept into their texts; they read &#x201C;amar&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;n&#x2019;um,&#x201D; which is the actual reading in Haggai. This error is also in the Talmud (B.) &#x1E32;iddushin, 82b.</ftnote>

<h1><small>PREMUNDANE CREATION, AND THE WORK OF THE FIRST DAY</small> [2<small>B</small>. ii.]</h1>
<p>R. E<small>LIEZER</small><sup><xref rid="fn63">2</xref></sup> <small>BEN</small> H<small>YR&#x1E32;ANOS</small> opened<sup><xref rid="fn64">3</xref></sup> (his discourse with the text), &#x201C;Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord, or<sup><xref rid="fn65">4</xref></sup> shew forth all his praise?&#x201D; (Ps. cvi. 2).<sup><xref rid="fn66">5</xref></sup> Is there any man<sup><xref rid="fn67">6</xref></sup> who can utter the mighty acts of the Holy One, blessed be He, or who can shew forth all His praise?<sup><xref rid="fn68">7</xref></sup> Not even the ministering angels<sup><xref rid="fn69">8</xref></sup> are able to narrate (the Divine praise). But to investigate a part of His mighty deeds with reference to what He has done, and what He will do in the future (is permissible), so that His name should be exalted among His creatures, whom He has created, from one end of the world &#x007C;&#x007C; to the other, as it is said, &#x201C;One generation to another shall laud thy works&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> cxlv. 4).<sup><xref rid="fn70">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Before the world was created, the Holy One, blessed be He, with His Name<sup><xref rid="fn71">2</xref></sup> alone existed, and the thought arose in Him to create the world. He began to trace (the foundations of)<sup><xref rid="fn72">3</xref></sup> the world before Himself, but it would not stand. They<sup><xref rid="fn73">4</xref></sup> told a parable, To what is the matter like? To a king who wishes to build a palace<sup><xref rid="fn74">5</xref></sup> for himself. If he had not traced in the earth its foundations, its exits and its entrances,<sup><xref rid="fn75">6</xref></sup> he does not begin to build.<sup><xref rid="fn76">7</xref></sup> Likewise the Holy One, blessed be He, was tracing (the plans of) the world before Himself, but it did not remain standing until He created repentance.<sup><xref rid="fn77">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Seven things<sup><xref rid="fn78">9</xref></sup> were created before the world was created. They are: The Torah, Gehinnom, the Garden of Eden,<sup><xref rid="fn79">1</xref></sup> the Throne of Glory, the Temple, Repentance, and the Name of the Messiah.</p>
<p>Whence do we know that this applies to the Torah? Because it is said, &#x201C;The Lord possessed me<sup><xref rid="fn80">2</xref></sup> in the beginning of his way, before his works <italic>of old</italic>&#x201D; (Prov. viii. 22). &#x201C;Of old&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn81">3</xref></sup> means before the world was created.<sup><xref rid="fn82">4</xref></sup> Whence do we know this with regard to the Garden of Eden? Because it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord God planted a garden <italic>of old</italic>&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn83">5</xref></sup> (Gen. ii. 8). &#x201C;<italic>Of old</italic>,&#x201D; whilst as yet the world had not been created. Whence do we know this with reference to the Throne of Glory?<sup><xref rid="fn84">6</xref></sup> Because it is said, &#x201C;Thy throne is established <italic>of old</italic>&#x201D; (Ps. xciii. 2). &#x201C;Of old,&#x201D; whilst as yet the world had not been created. Whence do we know that Repentance (was premundane)? Because it is said, &#x201C;<italic>Before</italic> the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xc. 2);<sup><xref rid="fn85">1</xref></sup> and then in close proximity (we read), &#x201C;Thou turnest man to contrition&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 3). &#x201C;Before,&#x201D; <italic>i.e.</italic> before &#x007C;&#x007C; the world was created. Whence do we know this with regard to the Temple? Because it is said, &#x201C;A glorious throne, set on high <italic>from the beginning</italic>, is the place of our <italic>sanctuary</italic>&#x201D; (Jer. xvii. 12). &#x201C;From the beginning,&#x201D; whilst as yet the world had not been created.<sup><xref rid="fn86">2</xref></sup> Whence we do know that the name of the Messiah (was premundane)? Because it is said, &#x201C;His name shall endure for ever; before the sun Yinn&#x00F4;n was his name&#x201D; (Ps. lxxii. 17).<sup><xref rid="fn87">3</xref></sup> &#x201C;Yinn&#x00F4;n,&#x201D; before the world had been created. Another verse says, &#x201C;But thou, Bethlehem Ephrathah,<sup><xref rid="fn88">4</xref></sup> which art to be least among the thousands of Judah, from thee shall he come forth unto me who is to be ruler over Israel; whose ancestry belongs to the <italic>past</italic>, even to the days of old<sup><xref rid="fn89">5</xref></sup>&#x201D; (Mic. v. 2). &#x201C;The past,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn90">6</xref></sup> whilst as yet the world had not been created.</p>
<p>Forthwith<sup><xref rid="fn91">7</xref></sup> the Holy One, blessed be He, took counsel with the Torah whose name is Tushijah (Stability or Wisdom) with reference to the creation of the world. (The Torah) replied and said to Him: Sovereign of the worlds &#x0021; if there be no host for the king<sup><xref rid="fn92">1</xref></sup> and if there be no camp for the king, over whom does he rule? If there be no people to praise the king, where is the honour of the king? The Holy One, blessed be He, heard this and it pleased Him. The Torah spake: The Holy One, blessed be He, took counsel with me concerning the creation of the world, as it is said, &#x201C;Counsel is mine, and sound knowledge;<sup><xref rid="fn93">2</xref></sup> I am understanding; I have might&#x201D; (Prov. viii. 14). Hence they<sup><xref rid="fn94">3</xref></sup> say, Every government which has no counsellors is not a proper government.<sup><xref rid="fn95">4</xref></sup> Whence do we know this? From the government of the House of David which employed counsellors, as it is said, &#x201C;And Jonathan David&#x2019;s uncle<sup><xref rid="fn96">5</xref></sup> was a counsellor, a man of understanding, and a scribe&#x201D; (1 Chron. xxvii. 32). If the government of the House of David had counsellors, how much more so should other people act likewise. This is of benefit to them, as it is said, &#x201C;But he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise&#x201D; (Prov. xii. 15), &#x007C;&#x007C; and (Scripture) says, &#x201C;But in the multitude of counsellors there is safety&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xi. 14).</p>
<p>Eight<sup><xref rid="fn97">6</xref></sup> things were created on the first day, namely, Heaven, Earth, Light, Darkness, Tohu (Chaos), Bohu (Void), Wind (or Spirit), and Water, as it is said, &#x201C;And the <italic>wind</italic> of God was moving upon the face of the <italic>waters</italic>&#x201D; (Gen. i. 2).<sup><xref rid="fn98">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Whence were the heavens created? From the light of the garment with which He was robed.<sup><xref rid="fn99">1</xref></sup> He took (of this light) and stretched it like a garment and (the heavens) began to extend continually until He caused them to hear, &#x201C;It is sufficient.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn100">2</xref></sup> Therefore is He called God Almighty (<italic>El Shaddai</italic>), who said to the world:<sup><xref rid="fn101">3</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>It is sufficient</italic>,&#x201D; and it stood (firm). Whence do we know that the heavens were created from the light of His garment? Because it is said, &#x201C;Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment; who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain&#x201D; (Ps. civ. 2).<sup><xref rid="fn102">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Whence was the earth created? He took of the snow<sup><xref rid="fn103">5</xref></sup> (or ice) which was beneath His Throne of Glory and threw it upon the waters, and the waters became congealed so that the dust of the earth was formed, as it is said, &#x201C;He saith to the snow, Be thou earth&#x201D; (Job xxxvii. 6).<sup><xref rid="fn104">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The hooks<sup><xref rid="fn105">2</xref></sup> of the heavens are fixed in the waters of the ocean.<sup><xref rid="fn106">3</xref></sup> The waters of the ocean are situated between the ends of the heavens and the ends of the earth. The ends of the heavens are spread out over the waters of the ocean, as it is said, &#x201C;Who layeth the beams of his chambers<sup><xref rid="fn107">4</xref></sup> in the waters&#x201D; (Ps. civ. 3).<sup><xref rid="fn108">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The dome (or inside shape) of the heavens ascends upwards like a tub,<sup><xref rid="fn109">6</xref></sup> (that is to say) like a tent (<italic>denda</italic>) which is spread out<sup><xref rid="fn110">7</xref></sup> with its extremities (fixed) &#x007C;&#x007C; downwards<sup><xref rid="fn111">8</xref></sup> and its dome stretching upwards so that people can sit beneath it and their feet stand on the earth, whilst all of them are inside the tent; in like wise are the heavens, their extremities are (fixed) downwards and their dome stretches upwards and all creatures dwell beneath them as in a tent, as it is said, &#x201C;And he spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in&#x201D; (Isa. xl. 22).<sup><xref rid="fn112">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Four quarters<sup><xref rid="fn113">2</xref></sup> have been created in the world; the quarter facing the east, that facing the south, that facing the west and that facing the north. From the quarter facing the east the light goeth forth to the world.<sup><xref rid="fn114">3</xref></sup> From the quarter facing south the dews of blessing and the rains of blessing<sup><xref rid="fn115">4</xref></sup> go forth to the world.<sup><xref rid="fn116">5</xref></sup> From the quarter facing west<sup><xref rid="fn117">6</xref></sup> where are the treasuries<sup><xref rid="fn118">7</xref></sup> of snow and the treasuries of hail, and thence come forth into the world cold and heat and rains. From the quarter facing north darkness goeth forth into the world. The quarter facing north He created, but He did not complete it, for He said, Anyone who says: I am a God, let him come and complete this quarter which I have left (incomplete) and all will know that he is a God.<sup><xref rid="fn119">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>There (in the north) is the abode of the destroying spirits, earthquakes, winds, demons, lightnings and thunders; thence evil issues forth into the world, as it is said, &#x201C;Out of the north evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the earth&#x201D; (Jer. i. 14).<sup><xref rid="fn120">9</xref></sup> Some say by ten Sayings was the world created<sup><xref rid="fn121">1</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C; and in three (Divine attributes) are these (ten Sayings) comprised,<sup><xref rid="fn122">2</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;The Lord by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens, by his knowledge the depths were broken up&#x201D; (Prov. iii. 19, 20). By these three (attributes) was the Tabernacle made, as it is said, &#x201C;And I have filled him with the spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, and with knowledge&#x201D; (Ex. xxxi. 3).

<ftnote id="fn78"><sup>9</sup> This passage is borrowed from T.B. Pesachim, 54a, or T.B. Nedarim, 39b, the order being varied by Repentance coming after the Torah. See also Jal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D; on Jeremiah, &#x00A7; 298, and cf. Gen. Rab. i. 4 (Theodor, p. 6 note, <italic>in loc</italic>.) and Tanna de b&#x00EA; Elijahu Rab. xxxi. p. 160, where only six subjects are enumerated. Friedmann (note 33, <italic>in loc.</italic>) points out that by comparing the various readings in Talmud and Midrash we find that there were nine premundane things, cf. &#x1E92;ohar, Lev. 34b. It is important to bear in mind, in reading Gen. Rab. i. 4. that of the six premundane things some were actually created and some were only ideally present in the mind of the Creator. The Torah and the Throne of Glory were created, but the patriarchs, Israel, the Temple, and the Name of the Messiah were only in the thought of God. In the Book of Enoch (Ethiopic) xlviii. 3, the Messiah is said to have had his name named <italic>before</italic> the sun and the signs were created; see my <italic>Hellenism and Christianity,</italic> pp. 15 ff., on the question of the pre-existence of the Messiah, and cf. Assumption of Moses i. 14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn79"><sup>1</sup> &#x201C;The Garden of Eden&#x201D; is usually rendered by the term Paradise. The fact that Gehenna is in juxtaposition to &#x201C;Gan Eden&#x201D; would lead one to infer that Paradise was referred to in this context. Our author is probably opposing the view that the Garden of Eden was created on the &#x201C;third day&#x201D;; see Jubilees ii. 7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn80"><sup>2</sup> The verse might be rendered: &#x201C;The Lord formed me as the beginning of his way.&#x201D; The reference is to Wisdom, which is here personified; see <italic>Hellenism and Christianity,</italic> pp. 64 ff. Christianity under the influence of Alexandrian Jewish thought identified Wisdom with its Messiah, whilst Palestinian Judaism identified Wisdom with the Torah.</ftnote>

Topheth was a place in the Hinnom Valley (<italic>i.e.</italic> Ge-henna or Ge-Hinnom) where the hateful and cruel Moloch abominations had been perpetrated; see W. R. Smith, <italic>Religion of the Semites,</italic> p. 357.

<ftnote id="fn85"><sup>1</sup> The translation in the Revised Version might be consulted, in order to see how the Midrashic point of view, based on a literal translation, agrees with or differs from the ordinary interpretation. In the 1st ed. this section follows that dealing with the Temple.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn86"><sup>2</sup> The premundane or Heavenly Temple was known to the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews, ix. 11, who speaks of the &#x201C;greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, <italic>not of this creation.&#x201D;</italic> See Wisdom ix. 8, and Odes of Solomon iv. 3. Maimonides, <italic>Guide</italic> 1. ix., discusses our theme. See also Menorath Ha-Maor, Introduction to the fourth book, where we are cautioned not to take the words in this passage in their literal meaning.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn87"><sup>3</sup> The R.V. reads: &#x201C;His name shall be continued as long as (or, &#x201C;before&#x201D;) the sun.&#x201D; For Yinn&#x00F4;n as a Messianic name see T.B.

<ftnote id="fn92"><sup>1</sup> This is quoted in Ginzberg&#x2019;s <italic>Geonica,</italic> ii. p. 88.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn93"><sup>2</sup> The idea of Wisdom or the Torah being with God prior to the Creation is generally assumed to be expressed in the famous passage verses 22-31 of this eighth chapter of Proverbs. This is, however, a mistaken view; see <italic>Hellenism and Christianity,</italic> pp. 65 ff. The source is rather to be found in the LXX Prov. viii. 30. Our Midrashic passage is based on Gen. Rab. 1. i.; see also Jal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D; on Prov. viii. 14, &#x00A7; 941, and see Bacher, P. i. p. 107 (note), who refers to the parallel in Philo.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn94"><sup>3</sup> The 1st ed. reads: &#x201C;The wise men.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn95"><sup>4</sup> Might one infer from this passage that the writer of <italic>P.R.E.</italic> was living in a land where the r&#x00E9;gime was not conducted in accordance with the rule laid down? Perhaps the reference is to the rule of the Mohammedans in Palestine, Egypt, or Babylon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn96"><sup>5</sup> The 1st and 2nd eds. have the reading &#x201C;the son of David.&#x201D; This is an error.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn97"><sup>6</sup> The fifth paragraph in the MS. begins here. These eight things are almost identical with the seven things enumerated in Jubilees ii. 2, if &#x201C;the abysses&#x201D; of the latter correspond to the &#x201C;Chaos and Void&#x201D; of our text. See Jera&#x1E25;meel i. 3, which is based on our text. This suggested identification seems to be warranted by the fact that Philo (<italic>loc</italic>. <italic>cit.</italic> 7) agrees with the enumeration in our text and Jubilees in the following six objects of creation: heaven, earth, darkness, water, spirit, and light. As the seventh object created on the first day he gives the abyss. This is also the reading in the Midrash Tadsheh vi., where Tehomoth &#x003D; abyss. It seems that Philo knew a cosmology which was known to Jubilees, to Midrash Tadsheh, and to our author; see Charles, <italic>Jubilees,</italic> pp. 11 f. T.B. Chagigah, 12a, which gives appropriate quotations to support the view enunciated, enumerates ten things as being created on the first day. Neither the Talmud nor <italic>P.R.E.</italic> mention Tehomoth, which is the equivalent to abyss, but they both have Tohu and Bohu.</ftnote>

<p>This reading occurs in Jera&#x1E25;meel i. 3, 4, but not in the B.M. MS. of <italic>P.R.E.</italic> The latter continues: &#x201C;Whence was the water created?

Light signifies nought else but water, as it is said, &#x2018;He spreadeth abroad the cloud of his light&#x2019;&#x201D; (Job xxxvii. 11).</p>
<ftnote id="fn99"><sup>1</sup> See Ex. Rab. <small>L</small>. i. The idea of this Midrash is that God created the heavens without any help from any intermediary. God alone is the Creator. &#x201C;The light of His robe&#x201D; means His will or favour. The world has been created by Divine love and favour for the benefit of mankind, the children of the Heavenly Father.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn100"><sup>2</sup> See T.B.

This psalm in verse 15 speaks of God sending out&#x201C;his commandment upon (the) earth; his word runneth very swiftly&#x201D;&#x2014;pointing to the word of creation. See Bacher, P. iii. 218. The verse quoted from Job (xxxvii. 6) is rendered by the R.V., &#x201C;He saith to the snow, Fall thou on the earth.&#x201D; See also Sepher Jezirah i. 11 for a parallel.

<h1><small>THE CREATION ON THE SECOND DAY</small> [4<small>A</small>. i.]</h1>
<p>O<small>N</small> the second day<sup><xref rid="fn149">1</xref></sup> the Holy One, blessed be He, created the firmament,<sup><xref rid="fn150">2</xref></sup> the angels,<sup><xref rid="fn151">3</xref></sup> fire for flesh and blood,<sup><xref rid="fn152">4</xref></sup> and the fire of Gehinnom.<sup><xref rid="fn153">5</xref></sup> Were not heaven and earth created on the first day, as it is said, &#x201C;In the beginning God created<sup><xref rid="fn154">6</xref></sup> the heaven and the earth&#x201D; (Gen. i. 1)? Which firmament was created on the second day? Rabbi Eliezer said: &#x007C;&#x007C; It was the firmament which is above the heads of the four Chajj&#x00F4;th (living creatures),<sup><xref rid="fn155">1</xref></sup> (as it is said<sup><xref rid="fn156">2</xref></sup>), &#x201C;And over the head of the Chajj&#x00F4;th there was the likeness of a firmament, like the colour of the terrible crystal&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn157">3</xref></sup> (Ezek. i. 22). What is the meaning of (the expression), &#x201C;like the colour of the terrible crystal&#x201D;? It means like precious stones and pearls; it illuminates all the heavens like a lamp which is illuminating<sup><xref rid="fn158">4</xref></sup> the whole house and like the sun which is shining with maximum intensity at noonday, as it is said, &#x201C;The light dwelleth with him&#x201D; (Dan. ii. 22);<sup><xref rid="fn159">5</xref></sup> and like this in the future will the righteous shed light,<sup><xref rid="fn160">6</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xii. 3).<sup><xref rid="fn161">7</xref></sup> Were it not for that firmament the world would be engulfed by the waters above it and below it;<sup><xref rid="fn162">8</xref></sup> but (the firmament) divides the waters (above) from the waters (below), as it is said, &#x201C;And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, (and let it divide the waters from the waters)&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn163">9</xref></sup> (Gen. i. 6), it illuminates<sup><xref rid="fn164">10</xref></sup> between the waters above and the waters below.<sup><xref rid="fn165">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>(As for) the angels created on the second<sup><xref rid="fn166">12</xref></sup> day, when they are sent (as messengers) by His word they are changed into winds, and when they minister before Him they are changed into fire, as it is said, &#x201C;Who maketh his angels winds; his ministers a flaming fire&#x201D; (Ps. civ. 4).<sup><xref rid="fn167">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Four<sup><xref rid="fn168">2</xref></sup> classes of ministering angels minister and utter praise<sup><xref rid="fn169">3</xref></sup> before the Holy One, blessed be He: the first camp (led by) Michael<sup><xref rid="fn170">4</xref></sup> on His right, the second camp (led by) Gabriel<sup><xref rid="fn171">5</xref></sup> on His left, the third camp &#x007C;&#x007C; (led by) Uriel<sup><xref rid="fn172">6</xref></sup> before Him, and the fourth camp (led by) Raphael<sup><xref rid="fn173">7</xref></sup> behind Him; and the Shekhinah of the Holy One, blessed be He, is in the centre. He<sup><xref rid="fn174">8</xref></sup> is sitting on a throne high and exalted.<sup><xref rid="fn175">9</xref></sup> His throne is high and suspended above in the air. The appearance of His Glory is like the colour of amber.<sup><xref rid="fn176">10</xref></sup> And the adornment of a crown is on His head, and the Ineffable Name<sup><xref rid="fn177">11</xref></sup> is upon His forehead.<sup><xref rid="fn178">12</xref></sup> One half (of His glory) is fire the other half is hail,<sup><xref rid="fn179">13</xref></sup> at His right hand is life and at His left is death. He has a sceptre of fire in His hand and a veil<sup><xref rid="fn180">1</xref></sup> is spread before Him, and His eyes run to and fro throughout the whole earth,<sup><xref rid="fn181">2</xref></sup> and the seven angels,<sup><xref rid="fn182">3</xref></sup> which were created first,<sup><xref rid="fn183">4</xref></sup> minister before Him within the veil, and this (veil) is called Pargod.<sup><xref rid="fn184">5</xref></sup> His footstool is like fire and hail.<sup><xref rid="fn185">6</xref></sup> Fire is flashing continually around His throne,<sup><xref rid="fn186">7</xref></sup> righteousness and judgment are the foundation of His throne.<sup><xref rid="fn187">8</xref></sup> And the likeness of His throne is like a sapphire throne with four legs,<sup><xref rid="fn188">9</xref></sup> and the four holy Chajj&#x00F4;th are fixed to each leg, each one<sup><xref rid="fn189">10</xref></sup> has four faces and each one has four wings, as it is said, &#x201C;And every one had four faces and four wings&#x201D; (Ezek. i. 6), and these (Chajj&#x00F4;th) are the Cherubim.</p>
<p>When<sup><xref rid="fn190">1</xref></sup> He &#x007C;&#x007C; speaks towards the west He speaks between the two Cherubim with the face of the ox, when He speaks towards the north He speaks between the two Cherubim with the face of an eagle.</p>
<p>Over against them<sup><xref rid="fn191">2</xref></sup> are the Ophanim (Wheels) and the Whirling Wheels of the Chariot,<sup><xref rid="fn192">3</xref></sup> and when He looketh upon the earth His chariots are upon the Ophanim, and owing to the noise caused by the whirling wheels of the Chariot&#x2014;lightnings and thunder go forth into the world.<sup><xref rid="fn193">1</xref></sup> When He dwells<sup><xref rid="fn194">2</xref></sup> in heaven He rideth upon a swift cloud.<sup><xref rid="fn195">3</xref></sup> When He hastens He flies upon the wings of the wind, as it is said, &#x201C;And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly; yea, he flew swiftly upon the wings of the wind&#x201D; (Ps. xviii. 10).</p>
<p>The Chajj&#x00F4;th stand next to the throne of His glory and they do not know the place of His glory.<sup><xref rid="fn196">4</xref></sup> The Chajj&#x00F4;th stand in awe and dread,<sup><xref rid="fn197">5</xref></sup> in fear and trembling, and from the perspiration of their faces a river of fire arises and goes forth<sup><xref rid="fn198">6</xref></sup> before Him, as it is said, &#x201C;A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him&#x2026;&#x201D;(Dan. vii. 10). And the wings of Gallizur<sup><xref rid="fn199">7</xref></sup> the angel, who stands next to the Chajj&#x00F4;th, (are spread forth) so that the fire which consumes the fire of the angels should not burn (them). Two Seraphim stand, one on His right and one on His left, each one has six wings,<sup><xref rid="fn200">8</xref></sup> with twain they cover their face<sup><xref rid="fn201">9</xref></sup> so as not to behold the presence of the Shekhinah, with twain they cover their feet so that they should not be seen before the presence of the Shekhinah, &#x007C;&#x007C; so that the standing of the foot of the calf<sup><xref rid="fn202">10</xref></sup> might be forgotten. With twain do they fly, praising and reverencing, and they sanctify.<sup><xref rid="fn203">1</xref></sup> One answers and another calls,<sup><xref rid="fn204">2</xref></sup> one calls and another answers, and they say, &#x201C;Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory&#x201D; (Isa. vi. 3).<sup><xref rid="fn205">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Chajj&#x00F4;th stand at the side of the throne of His glory and they do not know the place of His glory;<sup><xref rid="fn206">4</xref></sup> they respond and say in every place where His glory<sup><xref rid="fn207">5</xref></sup> is, &#x201C;Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place&#x201D; (Ezek. iii. 12). Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn208">6</xref></sup> a nation unique on the earth,<sup><xref rid="fn209">7</xref></sup> declares daily<sup><xref rid="fn210">8</xref></sup> the unity of His great Name, saying, &#x201C;Hear, O Israel: the Lord is our God, the Lord is one&#x201D; (Deut. vi. 4). He answers His people Israel and says to them, I am the Lord your God who has delivered<sup><xref rid="fn211">9</xref></sup> you from every trouble.<sup><xref rid="fn212">10</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn149"><sup>1</sup> See Jal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D;, Gen. &#x00A7;5, and Jal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D;, Ezek. &#x00A7; 338.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn150"><sup>2</sup> According to Jubilees ii. 4, the firmament <italic>only</italic> was created on the second day; see Slav. Enoch xxvi.&#x2013;xxvii.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn151"><sup>3</sup> In Gen. Rab. i. 3 and iii. 8, the question is discussed as to which day of the week of creation were the angels called into being. According to R. Jochanan it was the second day, as in our text, whereas according to R. Chanina it was the fifth day. Theodor (<italic>in loc.</italic>) gives the various parallel sources in notes 7 and 8. See also Pal. Targum on Gen. i. 26, where the creation of the angels is also assigned to the second day, as in Slavonic Enoch xxix. 1 ff. In Jubilees ii. 2 this event is said to have been on the <italic>first</italic> day; see Charles&#x2019; note 2 on pp. 12 f. Our book opposes this view. The Church Fathers sometimes held this view; see Epiphanius, <italic>adv. H&#x0153;r.</italic> lxv. 4. The Rabbis were fully aware of the teaching that God was assisted at the creation by angels or the Messiah, and in order to oppose such doctrine the creation of the angels was fixed on the second or fifth day; cf. Ex. Rab. xv. 22.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn152"><sup>4</sup> See T.B. Pesachim, 54a, and Gen. Rab. xi. 2 for the view that this fire was created at the termination of the first Sabbath. As the angels are often of fire (cf. Rev. xiv. 18), both angels and fire are held by our author to have been created on the second day. This view is held in spite of the statement that <italic>light</italic> was created on the first day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn153"><sup>5</sup> The fire of Gehenna is mentioned in the New Testament; see Matt, v. 22, and cf. Rev. xx. 10. See also Eth. Enoch xc. 24 and 26, the Apocalypse of Baruch lix. 10, 11, and the Apocalypse of Peter for an account of Gehenna. The 21st book of Augustine s <italic>de Civitate Dei</italic> is devoted to this theme. The Rabbis came to the conclusion that the fire of Gehenna must have been created on the second day, because the Scripture does not say with reference to this day &#x201C;and it was good,&#x201D; which, however, does occur in the story of the other five days of creation; see T.B. Pesachim, 54a, Ex. Rab. xv. 22, and Jal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D;, Gen. &#x00A7; 15.</ftnote>

The Chajj&#x00F4;th are to be identified with the &#x201C;creature&#x201D; of Rev. iv. 7. Do they correspond with the angels of the presence of Jubilees ii. 2?

<h1><small>THE GATHERING OF THE WATERS</small> [5<small>A.</small> i.]</h1>
<p>O<small>N</small> the third day<sup><xref rid="fn216">1</xref></sup> all the earth was flat like a plain and the waters covered the surface of all the earth. When the word of the Almighty<sup><xref rid="fn217">2</xref></sup> was uttered, &#x201C;Let the waters be gathered together&#x201D; (Gen. i. 9), the mountains and hills arose from the ends of the earth and they were scattered<sup><xref rid="fn218">3</xref></sup> over the surface of all the earth, and valleys were formed over the inner parts of the earth; and the waters were rolled together and gathered into the valleys, as it is said, &#x201C;And the gathering together of the waters he called seas&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 10).<sup><xref rid="fn219">4</xref></sup> Forthwith the waters became proud<sup><xref rid="fn220">5</xref></sup> and they arose to cover the earth as at first, when the Holy One, blessed be He, rebuked them &#x007C;&#x007C; and subdued them,<sup><xref rid="fn221">6</xref></sup> and placed them beneath the soles of His feet,<sup><xref rid="fn222">7</xref></sup> and measured them with the hollow of His hand<sup><xref rid="fn223">1</xref></sup> that they should neither decrease nor increase. He made the sand as the boundary of the sea, just like a man who makes a fence for his vineyard. When they rise and see the sand before them they return to their former place,<sup><xref rid="fn224">2</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Fear ye not me? saith the Lord<sup><xref rid="fn225">3</xref></sup>: will ye not tremble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea?&#x201D; (Jer. v. 22).</p>
<p>Before the waters were gathered together the depths<sup><xref rid="fn226">4</xref></sup> were created. These are the depths which are beneath the earth; for the earth is spread<sup><xref rid="fn227">5</xref></sup> upon the water like a ship which floats in the midst of the sea, so likewise is the earth spread out over the water, as it is said, &#x201C;To him that spread forth the earth above the waters&#x2026;&#x201D; (Ps. cxxxvi. 6). He opened an entrance to the Garden of Eden<sup><xref rid="fn228">6</xref></sup> because thence were planted upon the face of all the earth all kinds of trees yielding fruit according to their kind, and all kinds of herbs and grass<sup><xref rid="fn229">1</xref></sup> thereof, and in them (was seed), as it is said, &#x201C;Wherein is the seed thereof, upon the earth&#x201D; (Gen. i. 11).</p>
<p>He prepared a table for the creatures whilst as yet they were not created,<sup><xref rid="fn230">2</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Thou preparest a table before me&#x201D; (Ps. xxiii. 5). All the fountains arise from the depths to give water to all creatures.<sup><xref rid="fn231">3</xref></sup> Rabbi Joshua said: The diameter<sup><xref rid="fn232">4</xref></sup> of the earth is equal to a journey of sixty years,<sup><xref rid="fn233">5</xref></sup> and one of the depths which is near to Gehinnom bubbles with water and produces water<sup><xref rid="fn234">6</xref></sup> for the delight of the sons of man.</p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah &#x007C;&#x007C; said: Once every month ducts<sup><xref rid="fn235">7</xref></sup> rise from the depths to irrigate the face of all the earth, as it is said, &#x201C;And there went up a <italic>mist</italic> from the earth and watered<sup><xref rid="fn236">8</xref></sup> the whole face of the ground&#x201D; (Gen. ii. 6).<sup><xref rid="fn237">9</xref></sup> The clouds cause the seas to hear the sound of their waterspouts,<sup><xref rid="fn238">10</xref></sup> and the seas cause the depths to hear the sound of their waterspouts, and the deep calls to the deep to bring up waters to give them to the clouds, as it is said, &#x201C;Deep calleth unto deep at the sound of thy waterspouts&#x201D; (Ps. xlii. 7).<sup><xref rid="fn239">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The clouds draw water from the depths, as it is said, &#x201C;He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends<sup><xref rid="fn240">2</xref></sup> of the earth&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> cxxxv. 7), and in every place where the King commands them,<sup><xref rid="fn241">3</xref></sup> there they cause rain (to fall), and forthwith the earth becomes fruitful and yields produce like a widow who becomes pregnant through debauchery.<sup><xref rid="fn242">4</xref></sup> But when the Holy One, blessed be He, desires to bless the produce of the earth,<sup><xref rid="fn243">5</xref></sup> and to give provision to the creatures,<sup><xref rid="fn244">6</xref></sup> He opens the good treasuries in heaven and sends rain upon the earth, namely, the fructifying rain,<sup><xref rid="fn245">7</xref></sup> and forthwith the earth becomes fruitful like a bride who conceives from her first husband and produces offspring of blessing, as it is said, &#x201C;The Lord shall open unto thee his good treasury the heaven&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn246">8</xref></sup> (Deut. xxviii. 12).</p>
<ftnote id="fn216"><sup>1</sup> Of the week of creation. Our Book agrees here with the Book of Jubilees, which states: &#x201C;And on the third day He commanded the waters to pass from off the face of the whole earth&#x201D; (ii. 5). Cf. Ps. civ. 6, according to which the mountains were beneath the water, the surface of which was like a plain.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn217"><sup>2</sup> Jal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D;, Gen. &#x00A7; 8, reads: &#x201C;The Holy One, blessed be He.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn218"><sup>3</sup> The gathering of the waters revealed the hills and valleys which had hitherto been covered by the water.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn219"><sup>4</sup> In the MS. the tenth paragraph (of the fourth chapter) is marked here. For a parallel text see Wertheimer, <italic>op. cit.,</italic> i. p. 6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn220"><sup>5</sup> The Oxford MS. (d. 35) reads: &#x201C;The waters became insolent and attempted to ascend to Heaven as at first until He rebuked and subdued them and placed them beneath the soles of His feet, as it is said: &#x2018; Who maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters&#x2019;&#x201D; (Isa. xliii. 16). The first editions agree with our MS.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn221"><sup>6</sup> See Ps. civ. 7, Job xxxviii. 8&#x2013;10, and Prov. viii. 29. Eth. Enoch offers a parallel: &#x201C;the sea was created, and as its foundation He set for it <italic>the sand against the time of anger,</italic> and it dare not pass beyond it from the creation of the world unto eternity&#x201D; (lxix. 18).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn222"><sup>7</sup> See Job ix. 8, Ps. lxxvii. 19, and Shocher &#x1E6C;ob, Ps. xciii. 5, where our text is preserved; cf. Midrash K&#x00F4;nen, p. 25. The 1st ed. (<italic>P.R.E</italic>.) reads: &#x201C;and He subdued them beneath the ends of His feet.&#x201D; The Midrash should be compared with Tanchuma, Chu&#x1E33;&#x1E33;ath. &#x00A7; 1, and see T.B.

<ftnote id="fn225"><sup>3</sup> The second half of the verse is not given in the MS., which reads &#x201C;etc.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn226"><sup>4</sup> The Venice edition adds the words &#x201C;the luminaries&#x201D; before the words &#x201C;the depths.&#x201D; This is clearly a mistake.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn227"><sup>5</sup> Jal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D; Makhiri to Psalms (Ps. cxxxvi. 11) reads: &#x201C;the earth floats upon the depths.&#x201D; The text of this section in the Jal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D; is more correct than the printed editions of <italic>P.R.E.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn228"><sup>6</sup> This agrees with the Book of Adam and Eve (ed. Malan) 1. i.: &#x201C;And to the north of the garden there is a sea of water.&#x201D; See Jal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D; Makhiri (<italic>loc. cit.</italic>) for a parallel to our text. The Venice edition differs slightly from the 1st ed. and reads: &#x201C;The entrance to the Garden of Eden opened therein and He brought forth thence plants upon the face of all the earth.&#x201D; This 5th chapter is devoted to the account of the creation on the third day. Thus far we find the following things enumerated: (1) the gathering of the waters, (2) the appearance of the mountains and hills, (3) the transference of the plants and trees from the Garden of Eden, and we shall have (4) an account of the mists and clouds which water the face of the earth. The Book of Jubilees seems to offer a parallel: (1) &#x201C;And the dry land appeared, and on that day He created for them (2) all the seas according to their separate gathering-places, and all the rivers, and the gathering of the waters in the mountains and on all the earth and all the lakes, (3) and all the dew of the earth, (4) and the seed which is sown, and all sprouting things, and fruit-bearing trees, and trees of the wood, and the Garden of Eden in Eden, and all (plants after their kind). These four great works God created on the third day&#x201D; (ii. 6, 7). It seems strange that both books in connection with the third day refer to the Garden of Eden, especially as our book has already dealt with this as one of the pre-mundane creations. According to Gen. Rab. xv. 3 the Garden of Eden was created <italic>before</italic> the creation <italic>of man,</italic> who was created on the sixth day, whereas Eden was created on the third day. This tradition is preserved in Slavonic Enoch (A and B) xxx. 1 and in the Book of Adam and Eve (ed. Malan), <italic>loc. cit.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn229"><sup>1</sup> The Venice edition adds: &#x201C;He planted thereof, and in them was their seed upon the earth.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn230"><sup>2</sup> The reading in the first editions is: &#x201C;whilst as yet the world was not created.&#x201D; This &#x201C;table&#x201D; is not one of the premundane creations; see T.B.

<p>What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do,<sup><xref rid="fn257">9</xref></sup> so that there should be peace between them? He made the one larger and the other smaller,<sup><xref rid="fn258">10</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;The <italic>greater</italic> light to rule the day,<sup><xref rid="fn259">11</xref></sup> and the <italic>lesser</italic> light to rule the night and the stars he also made&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn260">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>All the stars minister<sup><xref rid="fn261">1</xref></sup> to the seven planets,<sup><xref rid="fn262">2</xref></sup> and their names are: Sun, Venus, Mercury, the Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars.<sup><xref rid="fn263">3</xref></sup> The mnemonic of their service is KZNSh ChLM, by night; ChLM KZNSh by day and KLSh ZMChN for the hours of the night; ChNKL ShZM for the hours of the day.<sup><xref rid="fn264">4</xref></sup> On the first day Mercury and the Sun, on the second day Jupiter and the Moon, on the third day Venus and Mars, on the fourth day Saturn and Mercury, on the fifth day the Sun and Jupiter, on the sixth day the Moon and Venus, on the seventh day Mars and Saturn.<sup><xref rid="fn265">5</xref></sup> All of them minister to the twelve constellations<sup><xref rid="fn266">1</xref></sup> which correspond to the twelve months. The constellations are: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, and Pisces.<sup><xref rid="fn267">2</xref></sup> All the constellations minister to<sup><xref rid="fn268">3</xref></sup> the days of the sun.<sup><xref rid="fn269">4</xref></sup> Now the days of the solar month are 30 days, 10 hours and a half,<sup><xref rid="fn270">5</xref></sup> and each constellation ministers to the &#x007C;&#x007C; days of the solar month for two days and a half, so that two constellations (minister for) five days.<sup><xref rid="fn271">1</xref></sup> The chief<sup><xref rid="fn272">2</xref></sup> which begins at the beginning of the solar month is the same chief which completes<sup><xref rid="fn273">3</xref></sup> at the end of the solar month; the one which opens is the one which closes.<sup><xref rid="fn274">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The great cycle of the sun is 28 years,<sup><xref rid="fn275">5</xref></sup> and therein are seven small cycles each of four years.<sup><xref rid="fn276">6</xref></sup> The number of days of the solar year<sup><xref rid="fn277">7</xref></sup> is 365 and a quarter of a day. The seasons<sup><xref rid="fn278">8</xref></sup> of the solar year are four, each season (consisting of) 91 days <img src="images/Art_P3.jpg" alt="art" /> hours. The beginnings of the cycles of the seasons are the 4th, 2nd, 7th, 5th, 3rd, 1st, and 6th (days).<sup><xref rid="fn279">9</xref></sup> Between each cycle there are 5 days and 6 (hours).<sup><xref rid="fn280">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Te&#x1E33;uphoth (<italic>i.e.</italic> seasons) of the small cycle are four in each year, some of them (last) 91 days <img src="images/Art_P4.jpg" alt="art" /> hours and some last 92 days.<sup><xref rid="fn281">1</xref></sup> The first year of the cycle (of four years) has its Te&#x1E33;uphah in Nisan at 6 p.m.; in the second year at 12 p.m.; in the third year at 6 a.m.; in the fourth year at 12 a.m.<sup><xref rid="fn282">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The four beginnings of the Te&#x1E33;uphah of the four months of Nisan<sup><xref rid="fn283">3</xref></sup> commence at the beginning of the night,<sup><xref rid="fn284">4</xref></sup> at midnight, at the beginning of the day,<sup><xref rid="fn285">5</xref></sup> and at noon (respectively). The rest of the other (days of the) &#x007C;&#x007C; Te&#x1E33;uphoth are as follows: &#x1E92;Ch; GYCh; VACh; &#x1E6C;DCh.<sup><xref rid="fn286">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The first Te&#x1E33;uphah of Nisan<sup><xref rid="fn287">7</xref></sup> took place at the beginning (of the hours) of Saturn.<sup><xref rid="fn288">1</xref></sup> The Te&#x1E33;uphah of Tammu&#x1E93; (took place) at the middle (of the hours) of Saturn.<sup><xref rid="fn289">2</xref></sup> The Te&#x1E33;uphah of Tishri (occurred) at the beginning of the hours of Jupiter.<sup><xref rid="fn290">3</xref></sup> The Te&#x1E33;uphah of &#x1E6C;ebeth (took place) at the middle (of the hours) of Jupiter.<sup><xref rid="fn291">4</xref></sup> And thus with all the other Te&#x1E33;uphoth, which occur at the beginning of the hours or at the middle of the hours.<sup><xref rid="fn292">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The first cycle<sup><xref rid="fn293">6</xref></sup> took place at the beginning of the hour of Saturn, (and the names of the Planets of the hours are) Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, and the Moon. The second cycle occurred in the hour (of the Planet) which is in front of it,<sup><xref rid="fn294">7</xref></sup> (<italic>i.e.</italic>) at the beginning of the hour of Jupiter. The third cycle occurred at the beginning of the hour of Mars. The fourth cycle entered at the beginning of the hour of the Sun. The fifth cycle entered at the beginning of the hour of Venus. The sixth cycle entered at the beginning of the hour of Mercury. The seventh cycle entered at the beginning (of the hour) of the Moon. (At) the end of seven hours,<sup><xref rid="fn295">8</xref></sup> at the end of seven cycles, at the end of 35 days<sup><xref rid="fn296">1</xref></sup> of the great cycle of 28 years, the Te&#x1E33;uphah cycle returns (<italic>i.e.</italic> begins again) at the beginning of the fourth day<sup><xref rid="fn297">2</xref></sup> in the hour of Saturn in the hour when it was created.</p>
<p>In 366 (degrees)<sup><xref rid="fn298">3</xref></sup> the sun rises and declines, it rises 183 (degrees) &#x007C;&#x007C; in the east, and it declines 183 (degrees) in the west corresponding to the 365<sup><xref rid="fn299">4</xref></sup> days of the solar year. (The sun) goes forth through 366<sup><xref rid="fn300">5</xref></sup> apertures and enters by the east; 90 days<sup><xref rid="fn301">1</xref></sup> it is in the south (east) quarter, 91 days in the north (east) quarter and one aperture is in the middle<sup><xref rid="fn302">2</xref></sup> and its name is Nogah.<sup><xref rid="fn303">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>(At) the Te&#x1E33;uphah of Tishri<sup><xref rid="fn304">4</xref></sup> (the sun) begins from the aperture of Nogah and goes through its revolutions towards the south quarter, through one aperture after another until it reaches the aperture of Bilgah.<sup><xref rid="fn305">5</xref></sup> (At) the Te&#x1E33;uphah of &#x1E6C;ebeth (the sun) begins from the aperture of Bilgah<sup><xref rid="fn305">5</xref></sup> and continues its course, returning backward through one aperture after another until it reaches the aperture of Ta&#x2018;alumah,<sup><xref rid="fn306">6</xref></sup> through which the light goes forth,<sup><xref rid="fn307">7</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;<italic>And the thing that is hid</italic> bringeth he forth to light&#x201D; (Job xxviii. 11). (At) the Te&#x1E33;uphah of Nisan (the sun) begins from the aperture of Ta&#x2018;alumah,<sup><xref rid="fn308">8</xref></sup> and it<sup><xref rid="fn309">9</xref></sup> goes to the north quarter through one aperture after another until it reaches the aperture No&#x2019;aman.<sup><xref rid="fn310">10</xref></sup> (At) the Te&#x1E33;uphah of &#x1E6C;ammu&#x1E93; (the sun) begins from the aperture No&#x2018;aman and goes on its course, returning backwards through aperture after aperture until it reaches the aperture Cheder<sup><xref rid="fn311">11</xref></sup> whence the whirlwind goes forth, as it is said, &#x201C;Out of <italic>the chamber</italic> cometh the storm<sup><xref rid="fn312">1</xref></sup> and cold out of the scattering winds&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxxvii. 9).</p>
<p>Through these apertures which are in the east (the sun) &#x007C;&#x007C; goes forth and opposite to them<sup><xref rid="fn313">2</xref></sup> in the west (the sun) sets. The Shekhinah is always in the west.<sup><xref rid="fn314">3</xref></sup> (The sun) sets and worships<sup><xref rid="fn315">4</xref></sup> before the King of Kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, saying: Lord of all worlds&#x0021; I have done according to all that Thou hast commanded me.<sup><xref rid="fn316">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aperture which is in the midst of the firmament is named M&#x2019;&#x1E93;arim<sup><xref rid="fn317">6</xref></sup> and (the sun) does not go forth or set<sup><xref rid="fn318">7</xref></sup> therein except once in its great cycle;<sup><xref rid="fn319">8</xref></sup> (thereon) it goes through it as on the day when it was created.<sup><xref rid="fn320">9</xref></sup> At night the sun is in the west.<sup><xref rid="fn321">10</xref></sup> At the Te&#x1E33;uphah of Tishri and at the Te&#x1E33;uphah of &#x1E6C;ebeth the sun goes on its course in the south quarter and in the waters of the Ocean<sup><xref rid="fn322">11</xref></sup> (which are) between the ends of the heavens and the ends of the earth where it is submerged.<sup><xref rid="fn323">12</xref></sup> For the night is long and the way is long<sup><xref rid="fn324">13</xref></sup> until (the sun) reaches the aperture which is in the east, (even) the aperture through which it desires to go forth,<sup><xref rid="fn325">14</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;It goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north&#x201D; (Eccles. i. 6).<sup><xref rid="fn326">1</xref></sup> It goes to the south at the Te&#x1E33;uphah of Tishri and at the Te&#x1E33;uphah of &#x1E6C;ebeth, and turns to the north at the Te&#x1E33;uphah of Nisan and at the Te&#x1E33;uphah of Tammu&#x1E93;. It goes on its course for six months in the south quarter, and for six months in the north quarter, and owing to its circuits the sun<sup><xref rid="fn327">2</xref></sup> returns to the aperture which is in the east. The sun has three letters of (God&#x2019;s) Name written upon his heart,<sup><xref rid="fn328">3</xref></sup> and the angels lead him;<sup><xref rid="fn329">4</xref></sup> such &#x007C;&#x007C; as lead him by day do not lead him by night, and such as lead him by night do not lead him by day. The sun rides in a chariot and rises, crowned as a bridegroom,<sup><xref rid="fn330">5</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run his course&#x201D; (Ps. xix. 5). The sun&#x2019;s rays and face, which are turned downwards (to the earth), are of hail;<sup><xref rid="fn331">6</xref></sup> and were it not for the hail which quenches the flames of fire<sup><xref rid="fn332">7</xref></sup> the world would be consumed by fire, as it is said, &#x201C;And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 6). In winter (the sun) turns the upper (half of) his face downwards,<sup><xref rid="fn333">8</xref></sup> and were it not for the fire which warms the face of hail the world could not endure because of the ice (cold), as it is said, &#x201C;Who can stand before his cold?&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> cxlvii. 17). These are the ends of the ways of the sun.<sup><xref rid="fn334">9</xref></sup></p>

These editions continue: &#x201C;And they minister to the seven days of the week.&#x201D; The idea implied is that each planet influences the world for one hour by day and by night. Thus&#x2014;</ftnote>
<p><img src="images/Art_P5.jpg" alt="art" /></p>
<p>The Jewish day begins at 6 p.m. (<italic>i.e.</italic> six hours earlier than the usual time in vogue in this country). For full explanation see Rashi on T.B. Berakhoth, 59b, and on T.B. &#x2018;Erubin, 56a. The seven planets are mentioned in the Sepher Jezirah iv. 7 by the same names as in our text. See also Baraitha d. Shemuel, ch. iii.</p>
<ftnote id="fn263"><sup>3</sup> The seven planets in the order of the text are represented by the following letters: Ch (Sun), N (Venus), K (Mercury), L (Moon), Sh (Saturn), Z (Jupiter), M (Mars). The letters represent the Hebrew names of the planets.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn264"><sup>4</sup> The whole of this sentence is missing in the printed editions.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn265"><sup>5</sup> The seven planets were believed to move in seven different orbits; see Philo, <italic>op. cit.</italic> 38, i. M. 27, C.W. i. 112. Origen, <italic>contra Celsum,</italic> vi. 21, speaks of &#x201C;the spheres of the planets.&#x201D; In the next chapter of Origen we hear of the mysteries of Mithras, and in connection with the rites of this cult the seven planets are mentioned. The order is as follows: Saturn, Venus, Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, the Moon, the Sun. This is exactly the reverse order of the mnemonic in our text for the service of the planets by day. In chapter xxxi. Origen deals with the &#x201C;ruling spirits&#x201D; accepted by the teaching of the Gnostics; these &#x201C;ruling spirits&#x201D; are the seven planets. The system has fortunately been preserved in the <italic>Pistis Sophia</italic> (ed. Mead), pp. 360 ff. The Church Father John of Damascus, in his <italic>Doctrine of Faith,</italic> ii. 7, also mentions the seven planets. See also Hippolytus, <italic>Philosophumena,</italic> iv. 6 ff.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn266"><sup>1</sup> <italic>i.e.</italic> the Zodiac. On this subject see John of Damascus, <italic>loc. cit.,</italic> and cf. <italic>J.E.</italic> iv. 244 f. Slavonic Enoch xxx. reads: &#x201C;The sun that he should go according to each sign of the Zodiac; and the course of the moon through the twelve signs of the Zodiac,&#x201D; and see Eth. Enoch lxxiii.&#x2013;lxxiv.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn267"><sup>2</sup> The first editions add: &#x201C;These (<italic>i.e.</italic> the constellations) were created in the work of the Creation to rule the world, and thus are their ordinances. And these seven servants<sup><xref rid="fn335">1</xref></sup> were created, and He placed them in the firmament of the heavens.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn336">2</xref></sup> Our MS. agrees here with the Oxford MS. (d. 35).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn268"><sup>3</sup> Perhaps the word should be rendered &#x201C;serve&#x201D;; see <italic>supra,</italic> p. 32, note 1. Gaster&#x2019;s Jera&#x1E25;meel iv. 2 has &#x201C;rules&#x201D; in reference to the sun, and &#x201C;serves&#x201D; in connection with the other planets.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn269"><sup>4</sup> Does this mean that the constellations influence the months, there being twelve constellations corresponding to the twelve months? Perhaps the reference is to the fact that the sun is in each constellation for 30 days, 10 hours, 30 minutes (<italic>i.e.</italic> a solar month). The Oxford MS. (d. 35) reads, &#x201C;the days of the solar year.&#x201D; The Venice edition reads: &#x201C;the days of the solar month.&#x201D; According to John of Damascus (<italic>loc. cit.</italic>)&#x2014;</ftnote>
<p><img src="images/Art_P6.jpg" alt="art" /></p>
<p>The 1st ed. adds &#x201C;Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Venus, Saturn. Sun, Moon, Saturn, and Mercury minister to each constellation 30 (days) 4 hours like an attendant, and just as the Sun and Moon and Mercury enter simultaneously.&#x201D; The text is evidently corrupt.</p>
<ftnote id="fn270"><sup>5</sup> The 1st ed. adds here: &#x201C;and during the days of the lunar month two constellations serve for four days and eight hours.&#x201D; The meaning is not evident. 4 days, 8 hours &#x00D7; 7 &#x003D; 30 days, 8 hours.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn271"><sup>1</sup> The sense to be conveyed seems to be that in a solar month every <img src="images/Art_P7.jpg" alt="art" /> days is under the influence of a constellation, the last <img src="images/Art_P8.jpg" alt="art" /> hours being reckoned as part of the service of the constellation which is next in order to that constellation which was placed over the last <img src="images/Art_P9.jpg" alt="art" /> days of the month. We shall see that each constellation is served by the Moon for <img src="images/Art_P10.jpg" alt="art" /> days, or, as John of Damascus says (<italic>loc. cit.</italic>), &#x201C;The Moon passes through the twelve constellations in each month.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn272"><sup>2</sup> <italic>i.e.</italic> the constellation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn273"><sup>3</sup> This would then mean that the next constellation begins its influence at the beginning of the next solar month.</ftnote>

Berakhoth, <italic>loc. cit.</italic> where we learn that the first Te&#x1E33;uphah of Nisan at the Creation was on the fourth day (Wednesday). Can Jubilees i. 14 and ii. 9 refer to Te&#x1E33;uphah? See Pal. Targ. Gen. i. 14, which reads: &#x201C;And God said: Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens, to distinguish between the day and the night; and let them be for signs and seasons for festivals and for the numbering by them of the calculation of the days and for the sanctification by them of new moons and new years, (for) intercalations of months and intercalations of years and Te&#x1E33;uphoth of the Sun and the Molad of the Moon and cycles.&#x201D; Etheridge&#x2019;s version (<italic>The Targums,</italic> i. p. 159) is inaccurate.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn279"><sup>9</sup> The seven days respectively of the seven small cycles. The Oxford MS.

<ftnote id="fn300"><sup>5</sup> The printed texts read 366 apertures. According to T.J. Rosh Ha-Shanah ii. 5, 58a, l. 41 ff., &#x201C;The Holy One, blessed be He, created 365 windows for the service of the world: 182 in the east and 182 in the west and one in the centre of the firmament, whence it came forth at the beginning at the Creation.&#x201D; See also Ex. Rab. xv. 22: &#x201C;The Holy One, blessed be He, created 365 windows in the firmament, 183 on the east and 182 on the west.&#x201D; The Jal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D; on 1 Kings, &#x00A7;185. compares the knops mentioned in 1 Kings vii. 24 to &#x201C;the 365 windows which are in the east and in the west, for the sun rises in one in the east and sets in one in the west.&#x201D; This section of the Jal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D; is taken from the Midrash Tadsheh (cf. Epstein, Midrash Tadsheh, p. xvi). Further parallels are to be found in Buber&#x2019;s Shocher &#x1E6C;ob, Ps. xix. 11, and Jal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D; on Psalms (xix.), &#x00A7; 673, and on Eccles. &#x00A7; 967. The astronomical theories of our book are not in agreement with the Rabbinical system set forth in the Talmud and Midrashim. It seems that our author held the view that the solar year had 366 days. Each half-year the sun passes through 91, plus 91, plus 1 apertures, or in one year through 366 apertures. Now we find a parallel teaching in the Slavonic Enoch xiii. 2: &#x201C;And I saw the six great gates open, each gate having sixty-one stadia.&#x201D; Thus far Text B.; see Charles&#x2019; ed.. p. 15, and cf. Eth. Enoch lxxii. 2 ff. on the course of the sun. Here also &#x201C;windows&#x201D; are mentioned. The whole of this chapter should be read in comparison with our text. Eth. Enoch adopts the strange calculation that the solar year has 364 days, though he was acquainted with the year of <img src="images/Art_P21.jpg" alt="art" /> days. Does our book attempt a new solution? or, as I venture to suggest, did our author borrow from Slavonic Enoch? This seems the most probable view.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn301"><sup>1</sup> The first editions read 91 days. This agrees with the Oxford MSS. (d. 35) and (O. 167) and also Gaster&#x2019;s MS.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn302"><sup>2</sup> This aperture separates the 91 N.E. windows from the 91 S.E. windows, and the sum total equals 183, which agrees with our text: &#x201C;it rises 183 (degrees) in the east.&#x201D;</ftnote>

The chief<sup><xref rid="fn364">6</xref></sup> which begins on the new moon (of the lunar month) is the same which concludes at the end of the lunar month.<sup><xref rid="fn365">7</xref></sup> The moon becomes new at every Molad, once at night and the next time<sup><xref rid="fn366">1</xref></sup> by day, &#x007C;&#x007C; and this is their sign: &#x201C;And it was evening and it was morning&#x201D; (Gen. i. 5). Between one Molad and (the corresponding) Molad in the ensuing year (there elapse) 4 days, 8 hours, and 876 parts.<sup><xref rid="fn367">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>From one small cycle to the next cycle (elapse) 13 days, 2619 parts.<sup><xref rid="fn368">3</xref></sup> When<sup><xref rid="fn369">4</xref></sup> the sun goes in the south quarter, the moon goes in the north quarter, and when the sun goes in the north quarter<sup><xref rid="fn370">5</xref></sup> the moon goes in the south quarter. All the hours serve for the beginning of the Molad of the moon in a retrospective order, according to the order &#x201C;ShLKNChM and Z.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn371">6</xref></sup> In the first year at the beginning of the night of the fourth day the beginning of the Molad (conjunction of the moon) is in the hour of Saturn (Sh). In the second year<sup><xref rid="fn372">7</xref></sup> the beginning of the conjunction of the moon is in the hour of the Moon (L). In the third year, in the following hour, the beginning of the conjunction of the moon is in the hour of Mercury (K).<sup><xref rid="fn373">1</xref></sup> In the fourth year the beginning of the conjunction of the moon is in the hour of Venus (N). In the fifth year, in the hour following, the beginning of the conjunction of the moon is in the hour of the Sun (Ch). In the sixth year the beginning of the conjunction of the moon is in the hour of Mars (M). In the seventh year, in the hour following, the beginning of the conjunction of the moon is &#x007C;&#x007C; in the hour of Jupiter (Z) in the hour following.<sup><xref rid="fn374">2</xref></sup> The third and fifth years are like the seventh. In like manner for three times these hours serve at the conjunction of the moon retrospectively until the (expiration of) the 21 years of the cycle.</p>
<p>All the constellations serve the moon by night from the four corners of the world:<sup><xref rid="fn375">3</xref></sup> 3 in the north, 3 in the south, 3 in the east, and 3 in the west. All the hours<sup><xref rid="fn376">4</xref></sup> serve the moon by night from the four corners of the world: 2 in the south, 2 in the north, 2 in the east, and 2 in the west. In the hour in which it began to serve in the south, (therein) it finishes in the west;<sup><xref rid="fn377">1</xref></sup> and so with all its circuits.</p>
<p>All the great<sup><xref rid="fn378">2</xref></sup> luminaries of the stars<sup><xref rid="fn379">3</xref></sup> are situated in the south except Ursa Major,<sup><xref rid="fn380">4</xref></sup> which is placed in the north.

<p>10 days, 21 hours, and 204 parts are the excess of the days of the solar year over the days of the lunar year;<sup><xref rid="fn389">13</xref></sup> and the intercalation is introduced to equalize the days of the solar &#x007C;&#x007C; year with the days of the lunar year.<sup><xref rid="fn390">1</xref></sup> The sun and the moon begin (their courses) at the new moon of Nisan, the sun goes before the moon at its Te&#x1E33;uphah;<sup><xref rid="fn391">2</xref></sup> and Aries begins to serve before it by day, and all the constellations serve thereafter<sup><xref rid="fn392">3</xref></sup> according to their order. The moon goes in the opposite direction<sup><xref rid="fn393">4</xref></sup> and Aries begins to serve before it<sup><xref rid="fn394">5</xref></sup> by night, and all the constellations serve thereafter according to their order, until the year of the small cycle, until the year of intercalation (comes round). (When) the intercalated month comes round it supersedes (or thrusts aside) the new moon (of Nisan) and remains at the new moon of Sheba&#x1E6D;,<sup><xref rid="fn395">6</xref></sup> and so on until the twelve<sup><xref rid="fn396">7</xref></sup> intercalated months (come round) when the sun and the moon are equal (again) at the commencement of the eve of the fourth day in the hour of Saturn in the hour when they were created. Between each Molad (conjunction of the moon and sun) there are only 86 hours, 40 minutes, and 73<sup><xref rid="fn397">1</xref></sup> minims (parts).</p>
<p>The moon does not disappear from the firmament save for the twinkling of an eye; even though there were a full thread (of light) surrounding it in the east and in the west,<sup><xref rid="fn398">2</xref></sup> the eye has not the power to see the moon until eight large<sup><xref rid="fn399">3</xref></sup> hours (have elapsed). (The large hours) are two hours for each (large) hour, either at the beginning of the Molad (conjunction) of the moon or at the end of the Molad of the moon.</p>
<p>The number of the days of the lunar year is 854 days, a third of a day, and 876 minims.<sup><xref rid="fn400">4</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C; All the hours of a lunar month are 708 hours and 40 minutes; all the hours of a lunar year are 8504 hours.<sup><xref rid="fn401">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>All the constellations serve the Molad of the moon and also the generations<sup><xref rid="fn402">6</xref></sup> of the children of men;<sup><xref rid="fn403">7</xref></sup> upon them the world stands, and everyone who is wise and understands, he understands the Molad of the moon and the generations of the children of men, and concerning them the text says, &#x201C;And let them be for signs,<sup><xref rid="fn404">1</xref></sup> and for seasons&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 14). The <italic>signs</italic> of the hours shall not depart from serving the sun by day and the moon by night.</p>
<p>In three cycles of the sun or in four cycles of the moon<sup><xref rid="fn405">2</xref></sup> there are 84 years, which are one hour<sup><xref rid="fn406">3</xref></sup> of the day of the Holy One, blessed be He. When the sun and moon become equal<sup><xref rid="fn407">4</xref></sup> at the beginning of the eve of the fourth day and at the hour of Saturn in the hour when they were created, and in the hour when the flames of the moon reach the sun by day at the degree (or ascent) of 60 (degrees), it passes therein and extinguishes its light; and in the hour when the flames of the sun reach the moon at night in the degree (or ascent) of 40 (degrees), it passes through it and extinguishes its light.<sup><xref rid="fn408">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Nehorai said: It is the decree of the King<sup><xref rid="fn409">6</xref></sup> that when Israel sins &#x007C;&#x007C; and fails to intercalate the year as is becoming, the Holy One, blessed be He, acts in His mercy at the time when the flame of the sun reaches the moon by night at 40 degrees (or ascents), then the Holy One, blessed be He, makes the moon dim and hides one of the Synhedrion.<sup><xref rid="fn410">1</xref></sup> When Israel does the will of the Holy One, blessed be He, in His great mercy He makes the sun dim and He sends forth His anger upon the nations of the world,<sup><xref rid="fn411">2</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Thus saith the Lord, Learn not the way of the <italic>nations</italic>, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven,<sup><xref rid="fn412">3</xref></sup> for the <italic>nations</italic> are dismayed at them&#x201D; (Jer. x. 2).<sup><xref rid="fn413">4</xref></sup> Just as the moon&#x2019;s light does not rule over the sun&#x2019;s light<sup><xref rid="fn414">5</xref></sup> by day, nor does the sun&#x2019;s light rule over the moon&#x2019;s light<sup><xref rid="fn415">6</xref></sup> by night, likewise the calculation of the moon does not rule by day nor does the calculation of the sun (obtain) by night,<sup><xref rid="fn416">7</xref></sup> and the one does not trespass on the boundary of the other.<sup><xref rid="fn417">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The dwelling of the moon is between cloud and thick darkness<sup><xref rid="fn418">9</xref></sup> made like two dishes turned one over the other,<sup><xref rid="fn419">10</xref></sup> and when it is the conjunction of the moon these two clouds turn in the east quarter<sup><xref rid="fn420">11</xref></sup> and (the moon) goes forth from between them<sup><xref rid="fn421">12</xref></sup> like a ram&#x2019;s horn.<sup><xref rid="fn422">13</xref></sup> On the first night (is revealed) one measure (of light), on the second night the second measure, and so on until the half of the month when the moon is fully revealed, and from the middle of the month these two clouds turn their faces in the west quarter.<sup><xref rid="fn423">1</xref></sup> The corner (<italic>i.e.</italic> crescent) of the moon with which it comes forth first,<sup><xref rid="fn424">2</xref></sup> (the same) begins to enter and is covered therein by the two (clouds) on the first night<sup><xref rid="fn425">3</xref></sup> (by) one measure, on the second night (by) a second measure, and so on to the end of the month until &#x007C;&#x007C; it is entirely covered.

<ftnote id="fn356"><sup>7</sup> The 1st ed. reads: &#x201C;28 days.&#x201D; The Venice text reads: &#x201C;30 days,&#x201D; which seems to be more correct than &#x201C;41 days&#x201D; of our MS. Our author seems to treat numbers without any regard to the exact amount. By treating fractions as though they were whole numbers, we may find an explanation of the difficulty which has already occurred in the previous chapter; perhaps the <img src="images/Art_P23.jpg" alt="art" /> days of the year were described as 366 so as to avoid the fraction. The text should probably read thus: &#x201C;The distance covered by the sun in 12 days is covered by the moon in 1 day, and (the distance) covered by the sun all the days of the year, the moon traverses in 30 days.&#x201D; See, however, T.J. Rosh Ha-Shanah ii. 5, p. 58a, which is possibly the source of our text here. The lunar month according to the Hebrew astronomers was said to be 29 days, 12 hours, and <img src="images/Art_P24.jpg" alt="art" /> parts of an hour (1 minute&#x003D;18 parts). Our book sometimes treats this as a whole number by saying, &#x201C;the month has 30 days,&#x201D; or we find the more exact reference to 29 days, 12 hours, and 40 minutes, neglecting the 4 minutes, <img src="images/Art_P25.jpg" alt="art" /> seconds, which really belong to the sum total.

<ftnote id="fn357"><sup>8</sup> The series of the small cycles of three years in which the Molad of the next cycle falls on the day which was anterior to that on which the previous Molad fell. The calculation is based on the length of the lunar month being reckoned as measuring 29 days, 12 hours, 40 minutes, so that in one year the surplus over the complete week equals 4 days, 8 hours (since each lunar month has 4 complete weeks and 1 day, 12 hours and 40 minutes; and this surplus multiplied by 12 equals 18 days, 8 hours, <italic>i.e.</italic> 4 days, 8 hours beyond the two weeks), and in three years we have a surplus of 13 days (two weeks less one day); therefore the day of the next series to the one in question will be one day earlier than the preceding series; see Schwarz, <italic>op. cit.</italic> p. 23, and Lewisohn, <italic>Geschichte und System des j&#x00FC;dischen Kalenderwesens,</italic> p. 25, note 84.</ftnote>

<p>Speaking of the sun and moon, Eth. Enoch says (lxxviii. 5): &#x201C;And they set and enter the portals of the west, and make their revolutions to the north and come forth through the eastern portals on the face of the heaven.&#x201D; The old Jewish belief as to the relation between the motion of the sun and moon was as follows: According to Rashi (T.B. Rosh Ha-Shanah, <italic>loc. cit.</italic>) the conjunction of every Molad (new moon) takes place when the moon is in the south-west corner of its orbit.</p>
<p>In winter since the sun does not traverse the west in the daytime save when it sets, therefore the moon is in the west before the sun gets there, because the moon during the first half of the lunar month goes to the north, whilst the sun revolves in the south.</p>
<p>In summer the sun goes over the greater part of the west in the daytime; and as it is then revolving in the north it is there before the moon, for then the moon is chiefly in the south. Where the sun sets there the moon rises.</p>

<ftnote id="fn389"><sup>13</sup> The <img src="images/Art_P30.jpg" alt="art" />; Luria holds that this is a later addition to our text. On the astronomical question see Gen. Rab. xxxiii. 7. Our reading has been used by the Pal. Targum, Gen. i. 16 (see Ginsburger, <italic>Pseudo-Jonathan,</italic> p. 2, note 8). The Slavonic Enoch says, &#x201C;And there remain 11 days over, which belong to the solar circle of the whole year&#x201D; (xvi. 5). According to Eth. Enoch lxxviii. 15, 16, the lunar year has 354 days and the solar year has 364 days, thus the difference between them amounts to 10 days. Jubilees vi. 32&#x2013;36 holds that the moon &#x201C;comes in from year to year 10 days too soon.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn395"><sup>6</sup> The intercalated month is always interposed between Adar and Nisan, so as to ensure the fall of the Passover in the early spring. The first printed editions read here, &#x201C;Adar,&#x201D; which appears to be the correct reading. The Venice edition adds: &#x201C;and thus is it until the year of the small cycle<sup><xref rid="fn430">1</xref></sup> comes round; (when) the intercalated month comes it displaces the new moon and remains at the new moon of &#x1E6C;ebeth.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn431">2</xref></sup></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn396"><sup>7</sup> The text is questioned by Luria and others. If instead of &#x201C;12&#x201D; we read &#x201C;7&#x201D; then we have the cycle of 19 years with 7 intercalated months, which will be presently considered. Luria thinks that &#x201C;the sun and moon are equal at the commencement of the eve of the fourth day in the hour of Saturn,&#x201D; as &#x201C;when they were created&#x201D; only applies at the end of the cycle of 84 years. This number is obtained by multiplying 12 (the number of the constellations) by 7 (the number of the planets); or by multiplying the solar cycle of 28 years by 3; or by multiplying the lunar cycle of 21 years by 4; possibly this 84-year cycle was intended to be used for astrological purposes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn397"><sup>1</sup> The &#x201C;73 minims&#x201D; must be considered as an interpolation; see <italic>supra,</italic> p. 43, note 5.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn399"><sup>3</sup> The large hour equals two ordinary hours, as is explained in the next line of the text. This passage explaining the large hour is not in the printed editions. According to T.B. Rosh Ha-Shanah, <italic>loc. cit.,</italic> the Palestinian Jews were unable to discern the moon at the Molad, for 6 hours after and 18 hours before the Molad; in Babylon the reverse rule obtained. The reading &#x201C;6 hours&#x201D; in this Talmudic passage seems to Luria to be the appropriate reading in our text. Assuming, however, that our text is correct, we might argue that Palestine could not be the place where our book arose.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn400"><sup>4</sup> 876 minims equal <img src="images/Art_P31.jpg" alt="art" /> minutes. There is evidently something amiss here, because the next sentence tells us that the lunar month has 708 hours and 40 minutes, which means that the lunar month equals 29 days, 12 hours, and 40 minutes. On this basis the lunar year has 354 days, 8 hours. Must we assume that the &#x201C;876 minims&#x201D; are an interpolation? This figure equals <img src="images/Art_P32.jpg" alt="art" /> minutes, which in one lunar month equal <img src="images/Art_P33.jpg" alt="art" /> minutes or 73 minims.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn403"><sup>7</sup> The knowledge of the influence of the stars and planets on terrestrial affairs or, in other words, astrology was believed to enable men to know the future. Our book bases this on the text, which is quoted in this paragraph; also Gen. v. 1, which was read as follows: &#x201C;This is the calculation of the generations of man.&#x201D; See also Job xxxviii. 19, &#x201C;Where is the way to the dwelling of light&#x2026; And that thou shouldst discern the paths to the house thereof? Thou knowest for thou wast then born.&#x201D; The sun, moon, and the planets are referred to in this chapter, showing that they have some connection with the time and duration of life. Slav. Enoch xix. 2 says, &#x201C;And these orders arrange and study the revolutions of the stars, and the changes of the moon, and revolutions of the sun, and superintend the good and evil condition of the world.&#x201D; The N.T. also implies a belief in the doctrines of astrology, <italic>e.g.</italic> Matt. ii. 9; see Jeremias, <italic>Babylonisches im N.T.,</italic> p. 52. This book of Jeremias is the best book on N.T. astrology; for astrology among the Jews see L&#x00F6;w, <italic>Gesammelte Schriften</italic>, ii. 115 ff.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn406"><sup>3</sup> God&#x2019;s day equals 1000 years, therefore 1 hour (reckoning 12 hours to the day) equals <img src="images/Art_P34.jpg" alt="art" /> years. The third part of the year is reckoned as a whole year. This is another instance of the use of fractions as whole numbers, which seems to be a characteristic of our author. The Church Fathers use this idea of God&#x2019;s day lasting 1000 years; see Justin Martyr, <italic>Dialogue with Trypho,</italic> lxxxi., and Iren&#x00E6;us, <italic>adv. H&#x00E6;r.</italic> v. 28. 3; and cf. Slavonic Enoch xxxiii. 1 f.</ftnote>

Instead of the reading &#x201C;by a word&#x201D; Luria suggests the reading &#x201C;in the world,&#x201D; referring to the eclipses which are visible over a large portion of the world.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn410"><sup>1</sup> Cf. T.B. Synhedrin, 37a, and Cant. Rab. on Cant. vii. 3. Here &#x201C;to hide&#x201D; means to conceal in the future life; this, in other words, is a warning not to neglect the intercalation. According to the Jesod &#x2018;Olam iii. 17 the moon is the &#x201C;chief&#x201D; of the Synhedrion, which dies at the eclipse by being <italic>hidden.</italic> For eclipse in N.T. see Luke xxiii. 44, 45.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER VIII<sup><xref rid="fn432">1</xref></sup></title>
<h1><small>THE PRINCIPLE OF INTERCALATION</small> [9<small>A</small>. i.]</h1>
<p>O<small>N</small> the 28th of Ellul the sun and the moon were created.<sup><xref rid="fn433">2</xref></sup> The number of years, months, days, nights,<sup><xref rid="fn434">3</xref></sup> terms, seasons, cycles, and intercalation were before the Holy One, blessed be He,<sup><xref rid="fn435">4</xref></sup> and He intercalated the years and afterwards He delivered the (calculations) to the first man in the garden of Eden,<sup><xref rid="fn436">5</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;This is the calculation<sup><xref rid="fn437">6</xref></sup> for the generations of Adam&#x201D; (Gen. v. 1), the calculation of the world is therein for the generations of the children of Adam.</p>
<p>Adam handed on the tradition to Enoch,<sup><xref rid="fn438">7</xref></sup> who was initiated in the principle of intercalation, and he intercalated the year, as it is said, &#x201C;And Enoch walked with God&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 22). Enoch walked in the ways of the calculation concerning the world which God had delivered to Adam. And Enoch delivered the principle of intercalation to Noah,<sup><xref rid="fn439">1</xref></sup> and he was initiated in the principle of intercalation, and he intercalated the year, as it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn440">2</xref></sup> &#x201C;While the earth remaineth,<sup><xref rid="fn441">3</xref></sup> seed-time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> viii. 22). &#x201C;Seed-time&#x201D; refers to the Te&#x1E33;uphah of Tishri,<sup><xref rid="fn442">4</xref></sup> &#x201C;harvest&#x201D; refers to the Te&#x1E33;uphah of Nisan, &#x201C;cold&#x201D; refers to the Te&#x1E33;uphah of &#x1E6C;ebeth, and &#x201C;heat&#x201D; refers to the Te&#x1E33;uphah of Tammu&#x1E93;; &#x201C;summer&#x201D; is in its season and &#x201C;winter&#x201D; is in its season.<sup><xref rid="fn443">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The counting of the sun is <italic>by day</italic> &#x007C;&#x007C; and the counting of the moon is <italic>by night</italic>, &#x201C;<italic>they shall not cease</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn444">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Noah handed on the tradition to Shem, and he was initiated in the principle of intercalation; he intercalated the years and he was called a priest, as it is said, &#x201C;And Melchizedek<sup><xref rid="fn445">7</xref></sup> king of Salem&#x2026; was a priest of God Most High&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xiv. 18). Was Shem the son of Noah a priest? But because he was the first-born, and because he ministered to his God by day and by night, therefore was he called a priest.<sup><xref rid="fn446">8</xref></sup> Shem delivered the tradition to Abraham; he was initiated in the principle of intercalation and he intercalated the year, and he (also) was called priest, as it is said, &#x201C;The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent,<sup><xref rid="fn447">1</xref></sup> Thou art a priest for ever after the order<sup><xref rid="fn448">2</xref></sup> of Melchizedek&#x201D; (Ps. cx. 4). Whence do we know that Shem delivered the tradition to Abraham? Because it is said, &#x201C;After the order of Melchizedek&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). Abraham delivered the tradition to Isaac, and he was initiated in the principle of intercalation, and he intercalated the year after the death of our father Abraham, as it is said, &#x201C;And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son&#x201D; (Gen. xxv. 11), because he had been initiated in the principle of intercalation and had intercalated the year (therefore) He blessed him with the blessing of eternity.<sup><xref rid="fn449">3</xref></sup> Isaac gave to Jacob<sup><xref rid="fn450">4</xref></sup> all the blessings and delivered to him the principle of intercalation. When Jacob went out of the (Holy) Land, he attempted to intercalate the year outside the (Holy) Land. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Jacob&#x0021; Thou hast no authority to intercalate the year outside the land (of Israel); behold, Isaac thy father is in the (Holy) Land,<sup><xref rid="fn451">5</xref></sup> he will intercalate the year, as it is said, &#x201C;And God appeared unto Jacob again, &#x007C;&#x007C; when he came from Paddan-Aram, and blessed him&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxxv. 9). Why &#x201C;again&#x201D;? Because the first time He was revealed to him, He prevented him from intercalating the year outside the (Holy) Land; but when he came to the (Holy) Land the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Jacob &#x0021; Arise, intercalate the year, as it is said, &#x201C;And God appeared unto Jacob <italic>again</italic>,&#x2026; and blessed him&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>), because he was initiated in the principle of the intercalation, and He blessed him (with) the blessing of the world.<sup><xref rid="fn452">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Jacob delivered to Joseph and his brethren the principle of intercalation, and they intercalated the year in the land of Egypt. (When) Joseph and his brethren died, the intercalations ceased from Israel in Egypt, as it is said, &#x201C;And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation&#x201D; (Ex. i. 6). Just as the intercalations were diminished from the Israelites in the land<sup><xref rid="fn453">2</xref></sup> of Egypt, likewise in the future will the intercalations be diminished at the end of the fourth kingdom<sup><xref rid="fn454">3</xref></sup> until Elijah, be he remembered for good, shall come.<sup><xref rid="fn455">4</xref></sup> Just as the Holy One, blessed be He, was revealed to Moses and Aaron in Egypt, likewise in the future will He be revealed to them<sup><xref rid="fn456">5</xref></sup> at the end of the fourth kingdom,<sup><xref rid="fn457">6</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt <italic>saying</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn458">7</xref></sup> This month shall be unto you the beginning of months&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xii. 1, 2). What is the significance of the word &#x201C;saying&#x201D;? Say to them,<sup><xref rid="fn459">8</xref></sup> Till now<sup><xref rid="fn460">9</xref></sup> the principle of intercalation was with Me, henceforth it is your right to intercalate thereby the year.<sup><xref rid="fn461">10</xref></sup> Thus were the Israelites wont to intercalate the year in the (Holy) Land. When they were exiled to Babylon &#x007C;&#x007C; they intercalated the year through those who were left in the (Holy) Land. When they were all exiled and there were not any (Jews) left in the (Holy) Land,<sup><xref rid="fn462">1</xref></sup> they intercalated the year in Babylon. (When) Ezra and all the community with him<sup><xref rid="fn463">2</xref></sup> went (to Palestine), Ezekiel<sup><xref rid="fn464">3</xref></sup> wished to intercalate the year in Babylon; (then) the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Ezekiel &#x0021; Thou hast no authority to intercalate the year outside the Land; behold, Israel thy brethren,<sup><xref rid="fn465">4</xref></sup> they will intercalate the year,<sup><xref rid="fn466">5</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Son of man, when the house of Israel dwell in their <italic>own</italic> land&#x201D; (Ezek. xxxvi. 17). Hence (the Sages) have said, Even when the righteous and the wise are outside the Land, and the keeper of sheep and herds are in the Land, they do not intercalate the year<sup><xref rid="fn467">6</xref></sup> except through the keeper of sheep and herds in the Land. Even when prophets are outside the Land and the ignorant<sup><xref rid="fn468">7</xref></sup> are in the Land they do not intercalate the year except through the ignorant who are in the land (of Israel),<sup><xref rid="fn469">8</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Son of man, when the house of Israel dwell in their <italic>own</italic> land&#x201D;(<italic>ibid.</italic>) it is their duty to intercalate the year.</p>
<p>On account of three things<sup><xref rid="fn470">9</xref></sup> is the year intercalated, on account of trees, grass, and the seasons (Te&#x1E33;uphoth). If two of these (signs) be available and not the third, they do not intercalate the year, (that is to say) neither because of the trees nor because of the grass. If one (sign)<sup><xref rid="fn471">1</xref></sup> be available and the other two be absent, they do not intercalate the year on account of the Tekuphoth.<sup><xref rid="fn472">2</xref></sup> If the Te&#x1E33;uphah of &#x1E6C;ebeth had occurred on the 20th<sup><xref rid="fn473">3</xref></sup> day of &#x007C;&#x007C; the month or later, they intercalate the year; but till the 20th day of the month &#x1E6C;ebeth or earlier they do not intercalate the year.</p>
<p>The cycle of intercalation is 19 years, and there are 7 small cycles<sup><xref rid="fn474">4</xref></sup> therein; some of these are (separated by) 3 years, some (by) 2 years, others (are separated by) 3 or 2 years, or (by) 3, 3, and 3 years (the order of the cycles being): 3rd, 6th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 19th years. There are two (sets) of three years&#x2019; cycles.<sup><xref rid="fn475">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The intercalation takes place in the presence of three;<sup><xref rid="fn476">1</xref></sup> Rabbi Eliezer says that ten (men are required), as it is said, &#x201C;God standeth in the congregation<sup><xref rid="fn477">2</xref></sup> of God&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn478">3</xref></sup> (Ps. lxxxii. 1), and if they become less<sup><xref rid="fn479">4</xref></sup> than ten, since they are diminished they place a scroll of the Torah before them,<sup><xref rid="fn480">5</xref></sup> and they are seated in a circle in the court-room,<sup><xref rid="fn481">6</xref></sup> and the greatest (among them) sits first,<sup><xref rid="fn482">7</xref></sup> and the least sits last; and they direct their gaze downwards<sup><xref rid="fn483">8</xref></sup> to the earth and (then) they stand and spread out their hands<sup><xref rid="fn484">9</xref></sup> before their Father who is in heaven, and the chief of the assembly<sup><xref rid="fn485">10</xref></sup> proclaims<sup><xref rid="fn486">11</xref></sup> the name (of God), and they hear a Bath &#x1E32;ol<sup><xref rid="fn487">1</xref></sup> (saying) the following words,<sup><xref rid="fn488">2</xref></sup> &#x201C;And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron&#x2026; saying,<sup><xref rid="fn489">3</xref></sup> This month shall be unto you&#x201D; (Ex. xii. 1, 2).</p>
<p>If, owing to the iniquity of the generation, they do not hear anything at all;<sup><xref rid="fn490">4</xref></sup> then, if one may say so,<sup><xref rid="fn491">5</xref></sup> He is unable to let His glory abide among them. Happy were they who stood in that place<sup><xref rid="fn492">6</xref></sup> in that hour,<sup><xref rid="fn493">7</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Happy is the people who know the joyful sound:<sup><xref rid="fn494">8</xref></sup> they walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance&#x201D; (Ps. lxxxix. 15); in the light of the countenance of the Holy One, blessed be He, they walk.<sup><xref rid="fn495">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the New Moon of Nisan &#x007C;&#x007C; the Holy One, blessed be He, was revealed to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, and it was the 15th<sup><xref rid="fn496">10</xref></sup> year of the great cycle of the moon, the 16th year of the cycle of intercalation,<sup><xref rid="fn497">11</xref></sup> (and He said): &#x201C;henceforward the counting devolves on you.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn498">12</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn433"><sup>2</sup> See T.B. Rosh Ha-Shanah, 11a and 27a, for the view of R. Eliezer that the world was created in Tishri. The heavenly bodies were created on Ellul the 28th. The work of creation began on the 25th of Ellul, see also Lev. Rab. xxix. 1. In the preceding chapters the assumption was that the Creation took place in Nisan, cf. <italic>supra,</italic> pp. 35 f., 47. This opinion has also the support of the Talmud B. Rosh Ha-Shanah, 12a. Part of this chapter is quoted in the &#x201C;Megillah of Abiathar,&#x201D; edited by Schechter in <italic>J.Q.R.</italic> xiv. pp. 463 ff.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn434"><sup>3</sup> The first editions add: &#x201C;hours.&#x201D; Cf. Wisdom vii. 18 f.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn435"><sup>4</sup> See Gen. Rab. iii. 7 as to the calculations prior to the Creation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn436"><sup>5</sup> In a holy place; for, according to our book, the Garden of Eden was near Mount Moriah in Palestine. See <italic>infra,</italic> p. 143.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn437"><sup>6</sup> See <italic>supra,</italic> p. 48, note 7, and cf. T.J. Rosh Ha-Shanah i. 3. 57b and Pesi&#x1E33;ta de R. Kahana P. Ha-Chodesh, p. 43b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn438"><sup>7</sup> The mention of Enoch in connection with the Calendar is significant, suggesting an acquaintance with the Calendar systems associated with Enoch in the pseudepigraphic literature. The fact that according to the O.T. Enoch lived 365 years is also noteworthy in this connection.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn439"><sup>1</sup> This should probably read &#x201C;Methuselah,&#x201D; and the text should continue, &#x201C;who handed it on to Noah.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn440"><sup>2</sup> Luria&#x2019;s text here needs correction.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn441"><sup>3</sup> The rest of the verse is given by the first editions.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn442"><sup>4</sup> Pal. Targum of this verse reads: &#x201C;During all the days of the earth, (there shall be) sowing at the Te&#x1E33;uphah of Tishri, and harvest at the Te&#x1E33;uphah of Nisan, cold at the Te&#x1E33;uphah of &#x1E6C;ebeth and warmth at the Te&#x1E33;uphah of Tammu&#x1E93;, and summer and winter, and days and night shall not fail.&#x201D; Te&#x1E33;uphah means not only season, but also the time of solstice and equinox according to the season.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn443"><sup>5</sup> The &#x201C;Megillah of Abiathar,&#x201D; p. 463, adds: &#x201C;summer in its season and winter in its season.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn444"><sup>6</sup> This section is based on the text &#x201C;day and night shall not cease&#x201D; (Gen. viii. 22).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn445"><sup>7</sup> Melchizedek is identified by our book with Shem. According to T.B. Nedarim, 32b, the priestly office held by Melchizedek&#x2019;s successors passed to those of Abraham; see Beer, <italic>Buch der Jubil&#x00E4;en,</italic> p. 74. The question of the identification of Shem with Melchizedek occurs in the Talmud (<italic>loc. cit.</italic> in this note), and see Buber&#x2019;s note 18 on p. 30 of the Midrash Agadah, cf. also Pal. Targum and Jer. Targum on Gen. xiv. 18, and Gen. Rab. xliii. 6 and lvi. 9. See also the note of Charles in his ed. of <italic>Jubilees,</italic> p. 101. A considerable part of this section of our text occurs in Jal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D; Makhiri, Ps. cx. 16, but the quotation from Gen. xiv. 18 is omitted. There are other variations in the text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn446"><sup>8</sup> The verse from Gen. xiv. 18 occurs here in the printed editions, and not above as in our MS.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn447"><sup>1</sup> The rest of the verse is not given by the MS., which merely adds &#x201C;etc.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn448"><sup>2</sup> Cf. Heb. v. 6 ff., on this theme. The Hebrew <span dir="rtl">&#x05D3;&#x05D1;&#x05E8;&#x05EA;&#x05D9;</span> might suggest the meaning of &#x201C;ruling&#x201D;; the Oxford <italic>Gesenius,</italic> p. 184, renders the word: &#x201C;after the order,&#x201D; or &#x201C;manner of.&#x201D; Is it merely a coincidence that the Test. XII Pat., Benj. x. 6, mentions the same names as in our text and in the same order?&#x2014; &#x201C;Then shall ye see Enoch, Noah, and Shem, and Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn449"><sup>3</sup> Or &#x201C;of the world.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn450"><sup>4</sup> See Jal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D; Makhiri, Pss. <italic>loc. cit.,</italic> which reads: &#x201C;And Isaac handed on to Jacob all the blessings, and handed to him the principle of intercalation,&#x201D; confirming the accuracy of the text of our MS. The printed editions read: &#x201C;Isaac delivered the tradition to Jacob, and he was initiated in the principle of intercalation, and he intercalated the year.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn451"><sup>5</sup> Although Isaac was blind, nevertheless the duty of intercalating the year devolved upon him and not upon Jacob when absent from the Holy Land. The Church offers a parallel to the subject-matter of our text in the famous controversy as to the right calculation for Easter; see the epistle sent to Pope Hilarus by Victorius in the fifth century. In this letter we have several references to the lunar cycle of 84 years which also occurs in our book. (For text see Thalhofer&#x2019;s <italic>Bibliothek der Kirchenv&#x00E4;ter,</italic> Die Briefe der P&#x00E4;pste, vi. pp. 16&#x2013;30; cf. also Ideler, <italic>Handbuch der Chronologie,</italic> 11, p. 276, and see also &#x201C;The Paschal Canon of Anatolius of Alexandria,&#x201D; in <italic>A.N.C.L.</italic> xiv. pp. 411 ff.)</ftnote>

In the first editions here follows the section beginning with the words: &#x201C;Hence the (Sages) have said.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn455"><sup>4</sup> The first editions read: &#x201C;until King Messiah shall come.&#x201D; This sign, due to the ignorance which will obtain in the period just before the advent of the Messiah, is to be compared with the &#x201C;woes of the Messianic age&#x201D; in Jubilees xxiii. 19: &#x201C;For they have forgotten commandment, and covenant, and feasts, and months, and Sabbaths, and jubilees.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn467"><sup>6</sup> This passage if rendered literally reads: &#x201C;Even the righteous and the wise outside the Land and the keeper of sheep and herds in the Land, then the year is intercalated only by the keeper of sheep and herds.&#x201D; See T.B. Synhedrin, 18b and 26a, for instances of intercalation by shepherds. Cf. the narrative of the Magi and the Star in Matt. ii. 1 ff.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn469"><sup>8</sup> The printed editions differ from our MS. here with reference to the arrangement of the material.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn470"><sup>9</sup> The first editions read: &#x201C;signs.&#x201D; This is also the reading in the Oxford MS. (d. 35). See <italic>Rabbinic Philosophy and Ethics,</italic> p. 221, note 3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn471"><sup>1</sup> <italic>i.e.</italic> the Te&#x1E33;uphah. Luria thinks that the reading should be as follows: &#x201C;If two signs be available and not the third we intercalate on account of the presence of the trees and the grass; if one sign be available and the other two be absent we do not intercalate on account of the Te&#x1E33;uphah&#x201D; (see T.B. Synhedrin, 12a, b, and cf. T.B. Rosh Ha-Shanah, 21a).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn472"><sup>2</sup> &#x201C;This is an error,&#x201D; says Luria; &#x201C;it should be the 16th&#x201D;; see T.B. Rosh Ha-Shanah, <italic>loc. cit.,</italic> and T.B. Synhedrin, 13a: for if the Te&#x1E33;uphah of &#x1E6C;ebeth fell on the 21st of &#x1E6C;ebeth, then the Te&#x1E33;uphah of Nisan would be on the 24th of Nisan (91 days&#x2019; interval), which is the day after Passover, accordingly Passover would not be in Abib (the Te&#x1E33;uphah in Nisan), and therefore Adar Sh&#x00EA;ni should be intercalated. The reading in our text (the 20th) is approved by Schwarz (<italic>Der j&#x00FC;dische Kalender,</italic> p. 36, note 3). The &#x201C;Megillah of Abiathar&#x201D; (<italic>op. cit.</italic> p. 471) reads: &#x201C;If the Te&#x1E33;uphah of &#x1E6C;ebeth had occurred from half (of the month) and later they intercalate the year, but till half (of the month) and earlier they do not intercalate the year.&#x201D; The printed editions read: &#x201C;If the Te&#x1E33;uphah had occurred by the 20th day of the month or earlier they intercalate the year; but from the 20th day of the month or later they do not intercalate the year.&#x201D; This is clearly wrong. The correct reading is preserved by our MS., which is confirmed by the Oxford MS. (d. 35). On this subject see Maimonides, &#x1E32;iddush Ha-Chodesh iv. 2, Sch&#x00FC;rer, i. (3rd ed.), pp. 752 ff.; F. K. Ginzel, <italic>Handbuch der Mathematischen und Technischen Chronologie,</italic> ii. p. 67; and L.Wreschner, <italic>Samaritanische Traditionen,</italic> p. 10. In the past year (5675) the Te&#x1E33;uphah of &#x1E6C;ebeth fell on Wednesday, January 6, 1915, at 10.30 p.m., <italic>i.e.</italic> the fifth day of the Hebrew week, the 21st of &#x1E6C;ebeth, and the Te&#x1E33;uphah of Nisan fell on Thursday, April 8, 1915, at 6 a.m., <italic>i.e.</italic> the 24th of Nisan, <italic>after</italic> the termination of the Passover festival. The rule in our text does not apply now in actual practice. See Jozeroth, ed. Arnheim, p. 73.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn473"><sup>3</sup> The first editions read: &#x201C;they intercalate the year on account of the Te&#x1E33;uphoth.&#x201D; This reading agrees with &#x201C;Megillah of Abiathar,&#x201D; p. 469.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn474"><sup>4</sup> Of intercalated years.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn475"><sup>5</sup> Our text has the following order of years, 3rd, 6th (the 3rd after the preceding year of intercalation), the 8th (<italic>i.e.</italic> two years after the preceding year), 11th (again three years&#x2019; interval), 14th (again three years&#x2019; interval), 17th (three years&#x2019; interval), and the 19th year (two years&#x2019; interval). On this question see Ginzel, <italic>op. cit.</italic> pp. 75 f.; and cf. Jesod &#x2018;Olam iv. ii. p. 63b, and the works on the Calendar by Lewisohn, p. 40, and Schwarz, p. 78. According to the Oxford MS. (d. 35) the text should read thus: the 3rd, 5th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 16th, and 19th, agreeing with the cycle of Meton the Greek astronomer, with the exception that the latter has the 13th year instead of the 14th year.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn477"><sup>2</sup> The &#x201C;congregation&#x201D; consists of ten, the Minyan; this is derived from the use of the word &#x201C;congregation&#x201D; in connection with the ten spies who brought a false report to Moses in the wilderness (Num. xiv. 27). The Oxford MS. (d. 35) reads here: &#x201C;&#x2018;In the congregation of God.&#x2019; &#x2018;Congregation&#x2019; means only ten (men), as it is said: &#x2018;How long shall I bear with this evil congregation,&#x2019;&#x201D; etc. (Num. xiv. 27).

<ftnote id="fn479"><sup>4</sup> <italic>e.g.</italic> if one or more of the ten men go away, see T.B. Berakhoth, 47b.

<title>CHAPTER IX<sup><xref rid="fn499">1</xref></sup></title>
<h1><small>THE CREATION AND WONDERS OF THE FIFTH DAY</small> [10<small>A</small>. ii.]</h1>
<p>O<small>N</small> the fifth day<sup><xref rid="fn500">2</xref></sup> He caused the waters to bring forth abundantly all kinds of winged fowls, male and female, unclean and clean. By two signs<sup><xref rid="fn501">3</xref></sup> are they declared to be clean, by the crop, and by the craw peeling off. Rabbi Eliezer said: (Another sign was) also by the projecting toe of the claw. Two kinds of birds have been chosen for the offering of a burnt sacrifice,<sup><xref rid="fn502">4</xref></sup> namely, the turtle-dove and the young pigeon.</p>
<p>He<sup><xref rid="fn503">5</xref></sup> caused the waters to bring forth abundantly all kinds of fish, male and female, unclean and clean. By two signs are they declared to be clean, by the fins and by their scales;<sup><xref rid="fn504">6</xref></sup> and if they do not have them (<italic>i.e.</italic> both signs) they are unclean.</p>
<p>On the fifth day He caused the waters to bring forth abundantly all kinds of locusts,<sup><xref rid="fn505">7</xref></sup> male and female, clean and unclean. By two signs are they declared to be clean: by their long legs with which they jump,<sup><xref rid="fn506">8</xref></sup> and by the wings which cover the entire body, such are clean. Such (living things) as were brought forth from the water, namely, fish and locusts,<sup><xref rid="fn507">1</xref></sup> are (eaten) without (being subject to the laws of) Shechi&#x1E6D;ah<sup><xref rid="fn508">2</xref></sup> (with the ritual slaughtering), but the bird cannot be eaten unless (it be killed) by (the method of) Shechi&#x1E33;ah. Such creatures which have been created from the earth<sup><xref rid="fn509">3</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C; have their blood covered with earth, and such as have been created from the water must have their blood poured out like water.<sup><xref rid="fn510">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer said: Not only concerning the water does the Scripture say that &#x201C;the waters should bring forth abundantly&#x201D; (Gen. i. 20), but also concerning the birds<sup><xref rid="fn511">1</xref></sup> which are compared with water, as it is said, &#x201C;And the uproar of many peoples, which roar like the roaring of the seas&#x201D; (Isa. xvii. 12), and just as the waters brought forth abundantly on the fifth day, likewise in the future will the nations of the world swarm in the fifth world,<sup><xref rid="fn512">2</xref></sup> and they will fight one another to destroy<sup><xref rid="fn513">3</xref></sup> (one another), as it is said, &#x201C;And they were broken in pieces, nation against nation, and city against city;<sup><xref rid="fn514">4</xref></sup> for God did vex them with all adversity&#x201D; (2 Chron. xv. 6). What is written (immediately) afterwards? The Salvation of Israel (is mentioned), as it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn515">5</xref></sup> &#x201C;But be ye strong; and your hands shall not be slack&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 7).</p>
<p>All rivers flowing on the earth,<sup><xref rid="fn516">6</xref></sup> as soon as they flow on the earth, they are blessed and good and sweet. There is some benefit to the world through them;<sup><xref rid="fn517">7</xref></sup> (when) they flow into the sea they are bad,<sup><xref rid="fn518">8</xref></sup> cursed, and bitter, and they are of no benefit to the world. Why are they similar to Israel? For when the Israelites rely upon the protection of their Creator and do His will, they are blessed and good and sweet, and there is some benefit to the world through them, and for their sake<sup><xref rid="fn519">1</xref></sup> the world stands. (When) the men of Israel depart from their Creator and trust in the statutes of the nations,<sup><xref rid="fn520">2</xref></sup> they are bad, accursed, and bitter, &#x007C;&#x007C; and there is no benefit in them for the world. Just as the waters of the rivers (are) the food of the waters of the sea,<sup><xref rid="fn521">3</xref></sup> so are (the sinners destined to be) fuel for Gehinnom. All the rains that descend into the sea are (as) seed for (all creatures) in them,<sup><xref rid="fn522">4</xref></sup> and thereby the fish are fed.<sup><xref rid="fn523">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the fifth day the waters in Egypt<sup><xref rid="fn524">6</xref></sup> were changed into blood. On the fifth day our forefathers went forth from Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn525">7</xref></sup> On the same (<italic>i.e</italic>. fifth) day the waters of the Jordan stood still before the ark of the Covenant of God.<sup><xref rid="fn526">8</xref></sup> On the same (<italic>i.e.</italic> fifth) day Hezekiah stopped the fountains which were in Jerusalem, as it is said, &#x201C;This same<sup><xref rid="fn527">9</xref></sup> Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxxii. 80).<sup><xref rid="fn528">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the fifth day He brought forth from the water the Leviathan,<sup><xref rid="fn529">11</xref></sup> the flying serpent, and its dwelling is in the lowest waters; and between its fins<sup><xref rid="fn530">1</xref></sup> rests the middle bar of the earth.<sup><xref rid="fn531">2</xref></sup> All the great sea monsters in the sea are the food for the Leviathan. Every day<sup><xref rid="fn532">3</xref></sup> it opens its mouth, and the great sea monster destined to be eaten that day (tries) to escape and flee, but it enters the mouth of the Leviathan; and the Holy One, blessed be He, plays with it, as it is said, &#x201C;This is the Leviathan, whom thou hast created to play with him&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn533">4</xref></sup> (Ps. civ. 26).</p>
<p>Rabbi Mana<sup><xref rid="fn534">5</xref></sup> said: Such creatures which have been created from the earth increase and multiply on the earth, and such which have been brought forth from the water increase and multiply in the water, except all kinds of winged birds, for their creation was &#x007C;&#x007C; from the water, yet they increase and multiply on the earth, as it is said, &#x201C;And let the fowl multiply in the earth&#x201D; (Gen. i. 22). Such as were brought forth from the water increase and multiply by the egg;<sup><xref rid="fn535">6</xref></sup> and such as were created from the earth increase and multiply by f&#x0153;tus (<italic>i.e.</italic> living offspring).<sup><xref rid="fn536">7</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn510"><sup>4</sup> Luria reads: &#x201C;Such as have been created from the water may have their blood consumed like water, and such as have been created from the earth, their blood is prohibited to be consumed: the exception is the fowl; for although it has been created from the water its blood is prohibited to be consumed, and, moreover, it requires that the blood which falls upon the earth when it is killed must be covered by dust.&#x201D; The traditional text found in our MS. as well as in the first editions is probably correct in view of the unusual Halakhah (or Law) preserved in the <italic>Fragments of a Zadokite Work</italic> (ed. Charles), xiv. 13: &#x201C;Nor shall fish be eaten unless they are split alive and their blood was shed.&#x201D; Dr Schechter thinks that this rule was&#x201D; &#x201C;directed against the Rabbinic opinion permitting the eating of the blood of the fish.

Chullin, 27b, &#x201C;where,&#x201D; says Dr. Schechter, &#x201C;we have a homily to the effect that cattle have to be killed in a certain way because they were created out of the dry land (earth); fish, again, require no killing, being created out of the water; whilst birds, which were created out of alluvial mud (a combination of water and earth), occupy also, with regard to their ritual killing, a middle place between cattle and fish. The notion was that the mode of killing is in some way connected with the element out of which the animal in question was created.&#x201D; See Wreschner, <italic>op. cit.</italic> p. 54.

<title>CHAPTER X<sup><xref rid="fn537">1</xref></sup></title>
<h1><small>THE HISTORY OF JONAH</small> [11 <small>A</small>. i.]</h1>
<p>O<small>N</small> the fifth day Jonah<sup><xref rid="fn538">2</xref></sup> fled before his God. Why did he flee? Because on the first occasion when (God) sent him to restore the border of Israel, his words were fulfilled, as it is said, &#x201C;And he restored the border of Israel<sup><xref rid="fn539">3</xref></sup> from the entering in of Hamath&#x201D; (2 Kings xiv. 25).<sup><xref rid="fn540">4</xref></sup> On the second occasion (God) sent him to Jerusalem to (prophesy that He would) destroy it. But<sup><xref rid="fn541">5</xref></sup> the Holy One, blessed be He, did according to the abundance of His tender mercy and repented of the evil (decree), and He did not destroy it;<sup><xref rid="fn542">6</xref></sup> thereupon<sup><xref rid="fn543">7</xref></sup> they called him a lying prophet.<sup><xref rid="fn544">8</xref></sup> On the third occasion<sup><xref rid="fn545">9</xref></sup> (God) sent him against Nineveh<sup><xref rid="fn546">10</xref></sup> to destroy it. Jonah argued with himself, saying, I know that the nations are nigh to repentance,<sup><xref rid="fn547">1</xref></sup> now they will repent and the Holy One, blessed be He, will direct His anger against Israel. And is it not enough for me that Israel should call me a lying prophet; but shall also the nations of the world (do likewise)? Therefore, behold, I will escape from His presence to a place where His glory is not declared. (If) I ascend above the heavens, it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn548">2</xref></sup> &#x201C;Above the heavens is his glory&#x201D; (Ps. cxiii. 4). (If) above the earth,<sup><xref rid="fn549">3</xref></sup> (it is said), &#x201C;The whole earth is full of his glory&#x201D; (Isa. vi. 8); behold, I will escape to the sea,<sup><xref rid="fn550">4</xref></sup> to a place &#x007C;&#x007C; where His glory is not proclaimed. Jonah went down to Joppa, but he did not find there a ship in which he could embark, for the ship in which Jonah might have embarked was two days&#x2019; journey away from Joppa,<sup><xref rid="fn551">5</xref></sup> in order to test<sup><xref rid="fn552">6</xref></sup> Jonah. What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He sent against it a mighty tempest on the sea and brought it back to Joppa. Then Jonah saw and rejoiced in his heart, saying, Now I know that my ways will prosper before me.</p>
<p>He said to the (sailors), We<sup><xref rid="fn553">7</xref></sup> will embark with you. They replied to him, Behold, we are going to the islands of the sea, to Tarshish.<sup><xref rid="fn554">1</xref></sup> He said to them, We<sup><xref rid="fn555">2</xref></sup> will go with you. Now (this) is the custom on all ships that when a man disembarks therefrom he pays his fare; but Jonah, in the joy of his heart, paid his fare in advance,<sup><xref rid="fn556">3</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord; and he went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish; so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it,<sup><xref rid="fn557">4</xref></sup> to go with them&#x201D; (Jonah i. 3).</p>
<p>They had travelled one day&#x2019;s journey, and a mighty tempest<sup><xref rid="fn558">5</xref></sup> on the sea arose against them on their right hand and on their left hand; but the movement<sup><xref rid="fn559">6</xref></sup> of all the ships passing<sup><xref rid="fn560">7</xref></sup> to and fro was peaceful in a quiet sea, but the ship into which Jonah had embarked was in great peril of shipwreck, as it is said, &#x201C;But the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so<sup><xref rid="fn561">8</xref></sup> that the ship was like &#x007C;&#x007C; to be broken&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 4).</p>
<p>Rabbi Chanina<sup><xref rid="fn562">9</xref></sup> said: (Men) of the seventy languages<sup><xref rid="fn563">10</xref></sup> were there on the ship, and each one had his god in his hand, (each one) saying:<sup><xref rid="fn564">1</xref></sup> And the God who shall reply and deliver us from this trouble, He shall be God.<sup><xref rid="fn565">2</xref></sup> They arose and every one called upon the name of his god, but it availed nought.<sup><xref rid="fn566">3</xref></sup> Now Jonah, because of the anguish of his soul, was slumbering and asleep. The captain of the ship came to him, saying, Behold, we are standing betwixt death and life, and thou art slumbering and sleeping; of what people art thou? He answered them, &#x201C;I am an Hebrew&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 9). (The captain) said to him, Have we not heard that the God of the Hebrews is great? Arise, call upon thy God, perhaps He will work (salvation) for us according to all His miracles which He did for you at the Reed Sea. He answered them,<sup><xref rid="fn567">4</xref></sup> It is on my account that this misfortune has befallen you; take me up and cast me into the sea and the sea will become calm unto you, as it is said, &#x201C;And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 12).</p>
<p>Rabbi Simeon said: The men would not consent to throw Jonah into the sea; but they cast lots among themselves and the lot fell upon Jonah.<sup><xref rid="fn568">5</xref></sup> What did they do? They took all their utensils which were in the ship, and cast them into the sea<sup><xref rid="fn569">6</xref></sup> in order to lighten it for their (safety), but it availed nought. &#x007C;&#x007C; They wanted to return<sup><xref rid="fn570">7</xref></sup> to the dry land, but they were unable, as it is said, &#x201C;Nevertheless the men rowed hard to get them back to the land; but they could not&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 13).<sup><xref rid="fn571">1</xref></sup> What did they do? They took Jonah and they stood on the side of the ship, saying, God of the world &#x0021; O Lord &#x0021; Do not lay upon us innocent blood, for we do not know what sort of person is this man; and he says deliberately,<sup><xref rid="fn572">2</xref></sup> On my account has this misfortune befallen you.<sup><xref rid="fn573">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>They took him (and cast him into the sea) up to his knee-joints, and the sea-storm abated. They took him up again to themselves and the sea became agitated again against them.<sup><xref rid="fn574">4</xref></sup> They cast him in (again) up to his neck, and the sea-storm abated. Once more they lifted him up in their midst and the sea was again agitated against them, until they cast him in entirely and forthwith the sea-storm abated,<sup><xref rid="fn575">5</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 15).</p>
<p>&#x201C;And the Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 17).<sup><xref rid="fn576">6</xref></sup> Rabbi &#x1E6C;arphon said: That fish was specially appointed from the six days of Creation<sup><xref rid="fn577">7</xref></sup> to swallow up Jonah, as it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord <italic>had</italic> prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). He entered its mouth just as a man enters the great synagogue, and he stood (therein). The two eyes of the fish were like windows<sup><xref rid="fn578">8</xref></sup> of glass giving light to Jonah.</p>
<p>Rabbi Meir said: &#x007C;&#x007C; One pearl was suspended inside the belly of the fish and it gave illumination to Jonah, like this sun which shines with its might at noon; and it showed to Jonah all that was in the sea and in the depths,<sup><xref rid="fn579">1</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Light is sown for the righteous&#x201D; (Ps. xcvii. 11).</p>
<p>The fish said to Jonah, Dost thou not know that my day had arrived to be devoured in the midst of Leviathan&#x2019;s mouth? Jonah replied, Take me beside it, and I will deliver thee and myself from its mouth. It brought him next to the Leviathan. (Jonah) said to the Leviathan, On thy account have I descended to see thy abode in the sea, for, moreover, in the future will I descend and put a rope in thy tongue,<sup><xref rid="fn580">2</xref></sup> and I will bring thee up and prepare<sup><xref rid="fn581">3</xref></sup> thee for the great feast of the righteous.<sup><xref rid="fn582">4</xref></sup> (Jonah) showed it the seal of our father<sup><xref rid="fn583">5</xref></sup> Abraham (saying),<sup><xref rid="fn584">6</xref></sup> Look at the Covenant (seal), and Leviathan saw it and fled before Jonah a distance of two days&#x2019; journey. (Jonah) said to it (<italic>i.e</italic>. the fish), Behold, I have saved thee from the mouth of Leviathan, show me what is in the sea and in the depths. It showed him the great river of the waters of the Ocean,<sup><xref rid="fn585">7</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;The deep was round about me&#x201D; (Jonah ii. 5), and it showed him the paths of the Reed Sea<sup><xref rid="fn586">8</xref></sup> through which Israel passed, as it is said, &#x201C;The reeds were wrapped about my head&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>); and it showed him the place whence the waves of the sea and its billows flow,<sup><xref rid="fn587">9</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;All &#x007C;&#x007C; thy waves and thy billows passed over me&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 3); and it showed him the pillars of the earth in its foundations, as it is said, &#x201C;The earth with her bars <italic>for the world</italic> were by me&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 6);<sup><xref rid="fn588">1</xref></sup> and it showed him the lowest Sheol,<sup><xref rid="fn589">2</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Yet hast thou brought up my life from destruction,<sup><xref rid="fn590">3</xref></sup> O Lord, my God&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>); and it showed him Gehinnom,<sup><xref rid="fn591">4</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Out of the belly of Sheol I cried,<sup><xref rid="fn592">5</xref></sup> and thou didst hear my voice&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 2); and it showed him (what was) beneath the Temple of God, as it is said,&#x201C;(I went down) to the bottom of the mountains&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn593">6</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic> 6). Hence we may learn that Jerusalem stands upon seven (hills<sup><xref rid="fn594">7</xref></sup>), and he saw there the Eben Shethiyah<sup><xref rid="fn595">8</xref></sup> (Foundation Stone) fixed in the depths.<sup><xref rid="fn596">9</xref></sup> He saw there the sons of Korah<sup><xref rid="fn597">10</xref></sup> standing and praying over it. They<sup><xref rid="fn598">11</xref></sup> said to Jonah, Behold thou dost stand beneath the Temple of God, pray and thou wilt be answered. Forthwith Jonah said to the fish, Stand in the place where thou art standing, because I wish to pray. The fish stood (still), and Jonah began to pray before the Holy One, blessed be He, and he said: Sovereign of all the Universe &#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn599">1</xref></sup> Thou art called &#x201C;the One who kills&#x201D; and &#x201C;the One who makes alive,&#x201D; behold, my soul has reached unto death, now restore me to life. He was not answered until this word came forth from his mouth, &#x201C;What I have vowed I will perform&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 9), namely, I vowed to draw up Leviathan and to prepare<sup><xref rid="fn600">2</xref></sup> it before Thee, I will perform (this) on the day of the Salvation<sup><xref rid="fn601">3</xref></sup> of Israel, as it is said, &#x201C;But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn602">4</xref></sup> Forthwith the Holy One, blessed be He, hinted (to the fish) and it vomited out<sup><xref rid="fn603">5</xref></sup> Jonah &#x007C;&#x007C; upon the dry land, as it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah<sup><xref rid="fn604">6</xref></sup> upon the dry land&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 10).</p>
<p>The sailors saw all the signs, the miracles, and the great wonders which the Holy One, blessed be He, did unto Jonah, and they stood and they cast away<sup><xref rid="fn605">7</xref></sup> every one his God, as it is said, &#x201C;They that regard lying vanities forsake their own shame&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn606">8</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic> 8). They returned to Joppa and went up to Jerusalem and circumcised the flesh of their foreskins, as it is said, &#x201C;And the men<sup><xref rid="fn607">9</xref></sup> feared the Lord exceedingly; and they offered a sacrifice unto the Lord&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> i. 16). Did they offer sacrifice?<sup><xref rid="fn608">10</xref></sup> But this (sacrifice) refers to the blood of the covenant of circumcision, which is like the blood of a sacrifice.<sup><xref rid="fn609">11</xref></sup> And they made vows every one to bring his children and all belonging to him to the God<sup><xref rid="fn610">12</xref></sup> of Jonah; and they made vows and performed them, and concerning them it says, &#x201C;Upon the proselytes, the proselytes of righteousness.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn611">1</xref></sup></p>

This Midrash, as well as our chapter, undoubtedly formed one of the Homilies for the service of the Day of Atonement, the Book of Jonah forming the lesson from the Prophets for the afternoon service of that day. This point is of importance in our estimate of the probable use which our book was intended to render. Was it a book for the Synagogue? Was it intended to supply Midrashic material for the preacher in his public discourses? As far as this 10th Chapter is concerned, the answer is in the affirmative. We shall find further evidence to support this view in the course of our study of this book.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn553"><sup>6</sup> Perhaps the text should read: &#x201C;In order to test Jonah what did the Holy One, blessed be He, do?&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn561"><sup>7</sup> The versions in Tanchuma Vaji&#x1E33;ra, &#x00A7; viii., and Jal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D; Jonah, <italic>loc. cit.,</italic> differ somewhat. Our text is, however, the source whence the Midrashim have drawn their material. &#x1E32;imchi on Jonah i. 7 remarks: &#x201C;I have found in the Pir&#x1E33;&#x00EA; R. Eliezer, A great tempest arose against them on the sea, and on their right hand and on their left hand all the ships were passing to and fro in peace in the tranquillity of the sea; and the ship into which Jonah had embarked was in great distress so that one thought that it would be broken in pieces.&#x201D; See Gen. Rab. xxiv. 4 with reference to the wind sent to hinder Jonah; cf. Lev. Rab. xv. 1 on same point.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn562"><sup>8</sup> The first editions omit the preceding part of the quotation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn563"><sup>9</sup> The first editions read &#x201C;Chananjah.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn564"><sup>10</sup> The seventy nations of humanity have each one a representative on board. The ship is a type of the world, which only can find its salvation through the willing martyrdom of the Hebrew, who, although he be inoffensive in his conduct with his fellow-men of all nationalities, is nevertheless quite willing to allow himself to be doomed to destruction in order to relieve his fellow-men of their threatened ruin. This universalistic aspect of the mission of the Hebrew is familiar to the student of the Bible. Abraham, Moses, and the suffering servant of God, who is none other than Israel, represent this teaching, which our book enforces. The basis for the Midrashic idea of the seventy nations is afforded by comparing the text of Jonah i. 5, which says, &#x201C;<italic>And every man</italic> cried unto his God,&#x201D; with the text in Mic. iv. 5, &#x201C;For <italic>all the people</italic> will walk <italic>every man</italic> in the name of his God.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<p>The story of Jonah is interpreted in a fine Midrashic spirit by Zeno in his 17th tractate. Ephraim (29th chap. on the prophet Jonah) refers to Jonah&#x2019;s dread of being called a &#x201C;lying prophet,&#x201D; and mentions also the dread inspired by Jonah among the terrible monsters of the deep. A very interesting point is suggested by a passage in Origen, <italic>contra Celsum,</italic> vii. 57, according to which Jonah was considered to be the Messiah in place of Jesus. Our book ascribes certain Messianic functions to Jonah in connection with the Leviathan and the Day of Israel&#x2019;s salvation. Perhaps he is a type of the &#x201C;Messiah ben Joseph&#x201D; who is to overcome the Anti-Christ or Satan (<italic>i.e.</italic> the Leviathan). The New Testament connects the story of Jonah with its Messiah; see Matt. xii. 39&#x2013;41 and <italic>ibid.</italic> xvi. 4; cf. Luke xi. 29&#x2013;32. The &#x201C;Fish&#x201D; as a Christian Messianic emblem may be associated with the Jonah legends.</p>

<h1><small>THE WORK OF CREATION ON THE SIXTH DAY</small> [12<small>B</small>. i.]</h1>
<p>O<small>N</small> the sixth day (God) brought forth from the earth all kinds of animals, male and female, clean and unclean. By two signs<sup><xref rid="fn614">2</xref></sup> are they declared to be clean: (the signs are) chewing the cud, and dividing the hoof.<sup><xref rid="fn615">3</xref></sup> Three<sup><xref rid="fn616">4</xref></sup> kinds of animals were chosen for the sacrifice of a burnt-offering, namely, the ox, the lamb, and the goat. Every kind of clean animal which is neither <italic>Nevelah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn617">5</xref></sup> (<italic>i.e.</italic> which has not been slaughtered according to the rules of Shechi&#x1E6D;ah<sup><xref rid="fn618">6</xref></sup>) nor &#x1E6C;erephah<sup><xref rid="fn619">7</xref></sup> (<italic>i.e.</italic> torn) in the field<sup><xref rid="fn620">8</xref></sup> is permitted to be eaten, except with regard to three parts, namely, the fat, &#x007C;&#x007C; the blood, and the sinew of the thigh,<sup><xref rid="fn621">9</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;As the green herb have I given you all&#x201D; (Gen. ix. 3).<sup><xref rid="fn622">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the sixth day (God) brought forth from the earth seven clean beasts;<sup><xref rid="fn623">1</xref></sup> their slaughter and the method of consumption are similar<sup><xref rid="fn624">2</xref></sup> to the (rules observed) with a bird; and all the rest of the beasts in the field are entirely<sup><xref rid="fn625">3</xref></sup> unclean.</p>
<p>He<sup><xref rid="fn626">4</xref></sup> brought forth from the earth all kinds of abominations<sup><xref rid="fn627">5</xref></sup> and creeping things, all of them are unclean.<sup><xref rid="fn628">6</xref></sup> Such (creatures) which have been created from the earth, their life (or soul) and body are from the earth, and when they return they touch their dust<sup><xref rid="fn629">7</xref></sup> at the place whence they were created, as it is said, &#x201C;Thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn630">8</xref></sup> (Ps. civ. 29); and it is written, &#x201C;And the spirit of the beast goes downward to the earth&#x201D; (Eccles. iii. 21).<sup><xref rid="fn631">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the sixth day He brought forth from the earth a beast (Behemoth) which lies stretched out on a thousand hills<sup><xref rid="fn632">10</xref></sup> and every day has its pasture on a thousand hills, and overnight (the verdure) grows of its own account as though he had not touched it, as it is said, &#x201C;Surely the mountains bring him forth food&#x201D; (Job xl. 20). The waters of the Jordan give him water to drink, for the waters of the Jordan surround all the earth,<sup><xref rid="fn633">1</xref></sup> half thereof (flow) above the earth and the other half below the earth,<sup><xref rid="fn634">2</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;He is confident, though Jordan swell even to his mouth&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 23). This (creature) is destined for the day of sacrifice, for the great banquet of the righteous,<sup><xref rid="fn635">3</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;He only that made him can make his sword<sup><xref rid="fn636">4</xref></sup> to approach unto him&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 19).</p>
<p>The<sup><xref rid="fn637">5</xref></sup> Holy One, blessed be He, spake to the Torah:<sup><xref rid="fn638">6</xref></sup> &#x201C;Let us make &#x007C;&#x007C; man in our image, after our likeness&#x201D; (Gen. i. 26). (The Torah) spake before Him: Sovereign of all the worlds &#x0021; The man<sup><xref rid="fn639">7</xref></sup> whom Thou wouldst<sup><xref rid="fn640">8</xref></sup> create will be limited in days and full of anger; and he will come into the power of sin. Unless Thou wilt be long-suffering with him, it would be well for him not to have come into the world.<sup><xref rid="fn641">9</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, rejoined: And is it for nought that I am called &#x201C;slow to anger&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn642">10</xref></sup> and &#x201C;abounding in love&#x201D;? He began to collect the dust of the first man from the four corners of the world;<sup><xref rid="fn643">11</xref></sup> red, black, white,<sup><xref rid="fn644">1</xref></sup> and &#x201C;pale green,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn645">2</xref></sup> (which) refers to the body.</p>
<p>Why (did He gather man&#x2019;s dust) from the four comers of the world?<sup><xref rid="fn646">3</xref></sup> Thus spake the Holy One, blessed be He: If a man should come from the east to the west, or from the west to the east,<sup><xref rid="fn647">4</xref></sup> and his time comes to depart from the world, then the earth<sup><xref rid="fn648">5</xref></sup> shall not say, The dust of thy body is not mine,<sup><xref rid="fn649">6</xref></sup> return to the place whence thou wast created.<sup><xref rid="fn650">7</xref></sup> But (this circumstance) teaches thee that in every place where a man goes or comes,<sup><xref rid="fn651">8</xref></sup> and his end approaches when he must depart from the world, thence is the dust of his body, and there it returns to the dust, as it is said, &#x201C;For dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> iii. 19).</p>
<p>The day had twelve hours;<sup><xref rid="fn652">9</xref></sup> in the first hour He collected the dust for (the body of) Adam, in the second (hour) He formed it into a mass,<sup><xref rid="fn653">1</xref></sup> in the third (hour) He gave it its shape, in the fourth (hour) He endowed &#x007C;&#x007C; it with breath,<sup><xref rid="fn654">2</xref></sup> in the fifth (hour) he stood on his feet,<sup><xref rid="fn655">3</xref></sup> in the sixth (hour) he called the (animals by their) names, in the seventh (hour) Eve was joined to him (in wedlock), in the eighth (hour) they were commanded concerning the fruits of the tree, in the ninth (hour) they went up to (their) couch as two and descended as four,<sup><xref rid="fn656">4</xref></sup> in the tenth (hour)<sup><xref rid="fn657">5</xref></sup> they transgressed His commandment, in the eleventh (hour) they were judged, in the twelfth (hour) they were driven forth, as it is said, &#x201C;So he drove out the man&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 24).</p>
<p>And He formed<sup><xref rid="fn658">6</xref></sup> the lumps of the dust of the first man into a mass<sup><xref rid="fn659">7</xref></sup> in a clean place,<sup><xref rid="fn660">8</xref></sup> (it was) on the navel<sup><xref rid="fn661">9</xref></sup> of the earth. He shaped him and prepared<sup><xref rid="fn662">10</xref></sup> him, but breath and soul were not in him. What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He breathed with the breath of the soul of His mouth, and a soul was cast<sup><xref rid="fn663">11</xref></sup> into him, as it is said, &#x201C;And he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> ii. 7).</p>
<p>Adam stood and he began to gaze upwards and downwards.<sup><xref rid="fn664">1</xref></sup> He saw all the creatures which the Holy One, blessed be He, had created; and he<sup><xref rid="fn665">2</xref></sup> was wondering in his heart, and he began to praise and glorify his Creator, saying, &#x201C;O Lord, how manifold are thy works &#x0021;&#x201D; (Ps. civ. 24).<sup><xref rid="fn666">3</xref></sup> He stood on his feet and was adorned with the Divine Image. His height was from east to west, as it is said, &#x201C;Thou hast beset me behind and before&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> cxxxix. 5). &#x201C;Behind&#x201D; refers to the west, &#x201C;before&#x201D; refers to the east.<sup><xref rid="fn667">4</xref></sup> All the creatures saw him and became afraid<sup><xref rid="fn668">5</xref></sup> of him, thinking that he was their Creator, and they came to prostrate &#x007C;&#x007C; themselves before him.</p>
<p>Adam said to them: What (is this), ye creatures &#x0021; Why are ye come to prostrate yourselves before me?<sup><xref rid="fn669">6</xref></sup> Come, I and you, let us go and adorn in majesty and might, and acclaim as King over us the One<sup><xref rid="fn670">1</xref></sup> who created us. If there be no people to acclaim the king as king, the king acclaims himself.<sup><xref rid="fn671">2</xref></sup> If there be no people to praise the king, the king praises himself. In that hour Adam opened his mouth and all the creatures answered after him, and they adorned in majesty and might and acclaimed their Creator as King over themselves, and they said, &#x201C;The Lord reigneth, he is apparelled with majesty&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xciii. 1).<sup><xref rid="fn672">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ten kings ruled from one end of the world to the other. The first king was the Holy One, blessed be He, who rules in heaven and on earth,<sup><xref rid="fn673">4</xref></sup> and it was His intention to raise up kings on earth, as it is said, &#x201C;And he changeth the times and the seasons;<sup><xref rid="fn674">5</xref></sup> he removeth kings, and setteth up kings&#x201D; (Dan. ii. 21).</p>
<p>The second king was Nimrod, who ruled from one end of the world to the other, for all the creatures were dwelling in one place and they were afraid of the waters of the flood,<sup><xref rid="fn675">6</xref></sup> and Nimrod was king over them,<sup><xref rid="fn676">7</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And the <italic>beginning</italic> of his kingdom was Babel&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn677">8</xref></sup> (Gen. x. 10).</p>
<p>The third king was Joseph, who ruled from one end of the world to the other, as it is said, &#x201C;And <italic>all</italic> the earth came &#x007C;&#x007C; into Egypt to Joseph&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xli. 57). It is not written here &#x201C;Egypt came,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn678">1</xref></sup> but &#x201C;they came into Egypt,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn679">2</xref></sup> for they brought their tribute and their presents to Joseph to buy (corn); for forty years he was second to the king,<sup><xref rid="fn680">3</xref></sup> and for forty years he was king<sup><xref rid="fn681">4</xref></sup> alone, as it is said, &#x201C;Now there arose a <italic>new</italic> king over Egypt&#x201D; (Ex. i. 8).<sup><xref rid="fn682">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The fourth king was Solomon, who reigned from one end of the world to the other, as it is said, &#x201C;And Solomon ruled over <italic>all</italic> the kingdoms&#x201D; (1 Kings iv. 21); and it says, &#x201C;And they brought every man his present,<sup><xref rid="fn683">6</xref></sup> vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> x. 25).</p>
<p>The fifth king was Ahab, king of Israel, who ruled from one end of the world to the other,<sup><xref rid="fn684">7</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;As the Lord thy God liveth, there is <italic>no</italic> nation or kingdom,<sup><xref rid="fn685">8</xref></sup> whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xviii. 10). All the princes of the provinces<sup><xref rid="fn686">9</xref></sup> were controlled<sup><xref rid="fn687">10</xref></sup> by him; they sent and brought their tribute and their presents to Ahab. Are not all the princes of the provinces of the world two hundred and thirty-two?<sup><xref rid="fn688">11</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Then he mustered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xx. 15).</p>
<p>The sixth king was Nebuchadnezzar, who<sup><xref rid="fn689">1</xref></sup> ruled from one end of the world to the other.<sup><xref rid="fn690">2</xref></sup> Moreover, he ruled over the beasts of the field and the birds of heaven, and they could not open their mouth except by the permission of Nebuchadnezzar, &#x007C;&#x007C; as it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn691">3</xref></sup> &#x201C;And <italic>wheresoever</italic> the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand&#x201D; (Dan. ii. 88).</p>
<p>The seventh king was Cyrus,<sup><xref rid="fn692">4</xref></sup> who ruled from one end of the world to the other, as it is said, &#x201C;Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia,<sup><xref rid="fn693">5</xref></sup> <italic>All</italic> the kingdoms of the earth hath the Lord, the God of heaven, given me&#x201D; (2 Chron. xxxvi. 23). Ahasuerus ruled over half the world. Is not half the world but 116 provinces, as it is said, &#x201C;This is Ahasuerus, who reigned from India unto Ethiopia&#x201D; (Esth. i. 1).<sup><xref rid="fn694">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The eighth king was Alexander<sup><xref rid="fn695">7</xref></sup> of Macedonia, who ruled from one end of the world to the other, as it is said, &#x201C;And as I was considering, behold, an he-goat came from the west<sup><xref rid="fn696">8</xref></sup> over the face of the <italic>whole</italic> earth&#x201D; (Dan. viii. 5). &#x201C;Over the earth&#x201D; is not written here, but &#x201C;over the face of the <italic>whole</italic> earth.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn697">9</xref></sup> And not only that, but he wished to ascend to heaven in order to know what is in heaven, and to descend into the depths in order to know what is in the depths,<sup><xref rid="fn698">1</xref></sup> and not only that, but he attempted to go to the ends of the earth in order to know what was at the ends of the earth. The Holy One, blessed be He, divided his kingdom<sup><xref rid="fn699">2</xref></sup> among the four corners (or winds) of the heavens, as it is said, &#x201C;And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided towards the four winds of the heaven&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xi. 4).</p>
<p>The ninth king is King &#x007C;&#x007C; Messiah, who, in the future, will rule from one end of the world to the other,<sup><xref rid="fn700">3</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;He shall have dominion also from sea to sea&#x201D; (Ps. lxxii. 8);<sup><xref rid="fn701">4</xref></sup> and another Scripture text says, &#x201C;And the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled <italic>the whole earth</italic>&#x201D; (Dan. ii. 35).<sup><xref rid="fn702">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The tenth king will restore the sovereignty to its owners.<sup><xref rid="fn703">6</xref></sup> He who was the first king will be the last king, as it is said, &#x201C;Thus saith the Lord, the King&#x2026; I am the first, and I am the last;<sup><xref rid="fn704">7</xref></sup> and beside me there is no God&#x201D; (Isa. xliv. 6); and it is written, &#x201C;And the Lord shall be king over <italic>all</italic> the earth&#x201D; (Zech. xiv. 9).<sup><xref rid="fn705">8</xref></sup></p>

The attention drawn to the ritual regulations of Shechi&#x1E6D;ah and to the clean animals is what one would expect in a popular treatise for perusal in the home or Synagogue. This seems to be the tendency of much of the Pseudepigrapha, such as the Book of Jubilees or the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs. The Jewish law as to clean animals is explained allegorically by the Epistle of Barnabas x.</ftnote>

<h1><small>ADAM IN PARADISE</small> [14<small>A</small>. ii.]</h1>
<p>W<small>ITH</small> love abounding did the Holy One, blessed be He, love the first man, inasmuch as He created him in<sup><xref rid="fn711">2</xref></sup> a pure locality, in the place of the Temple,<sup><xref rid="fn712">3</xref></sup> and He brought him into His palace,<sup><xref rid="fn713">4</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden<sup><xref rid="fn714">5</xref></sup> to dress it and to keep it&#x201D; (Gen. ii. 15). From which place did He take him? From the place of the Temple, and He brought him into His palace, which is Eden, as it is said, &#x201C;And he put him into the garden of Eden to dress it&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn715">6</xref></sup> Perhaps thou wilt say:<sup><xref rid="fn716">7</xref></sup> To plough (the fields) and cast out<sup><xref rid="fn717">8</xref></sup> the stones from the ground.<sup><xref rid="fn718">1</xref></sup> But did not all the trees grow up of their own accord?<sup><xref rid="fn719">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Perhaps thou wilt say: There was some other work (to be done) in the garden of Eden, (such as) to water the garden. But did not a river flow through and issue forth from Eden, and water the garden, as it is said, &#x007C;&#x007C; &#x201C;And a river went out of Eden to water the garden&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 10)?</p>
<p>What then is the meaning of this expression: &#x201C;to dress it and to keep it&#x201D;? (The text) does not say &#x201C;to dress it and to keep it&#x201D; except (in the sense) of being occupied with the words of the Torah<sup><xref rid="fn720">3</xref></sup> and keeping all its commandments,<sup><xref rid="fn721">4</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;to keep the way of the tree of life&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> iii. 24). But the &#x201C;tree of life&#x201D; signifies only the Torah,<sup><xref rid="fn722">5</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;It is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon it&#x201D; (Prov. iii. 18).</p>
<p>And (Adam) was at his leisure in the garden of Eden, like one of the ministering angels.<sup><xref rid="fn723">6</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, said: I am alone in My world and this one (Adam) also is alone in his<sup><xref rid="fn724">7</xref></sup> world. There is no propagation before Me and this one (Adam) has no propagation in his life;<sup><xref rid="fn725">8</xref></sup> hereafter all the creatures<sup><xref rid="fn726">9</xref></sup> will say: Since there was no propagation in his life,<sup><xref rid="fn725">8</xref></sup> it is he who has created us.<sup><xref rid="fn727">10</xref></sup> It is not good for man to be alone, as it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord God said, It is not good for man to be alone; I will make him an help meet for him &#x2026;&#x201D; (Gen. ii. 18).<sup><xref rid="fn728">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah said:<sup><xref rid="fn729">2</xref></sup> If he be worthy she shall be an help meet for him; if not, she shall be against him to fight him.<sup><xref rid="fn730">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>When the earth heard this expression<sup><xref rid="fn731">4</xref></sup> thereupon it trembled and quaked, crying before its Creator: Sovereign of all worlds &#x0021; I have not the power to feed the multitude<sup><xref rid="fn732">5</xref></sup> of mankind. The Holy One, blessed be He, replied: I and thou will (together) feed the multitude<sup><xref rid="fn732">5</xref></sup> of mankind. They agreed to divide (the task) between themselves: the night was for the Holy One, blessed be He, &#x007C;&#x007C; and the day (was apportioned) to the earth.<sup><xref rid="fn733">6</xref></sup> What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He created the sleep of life,<sup><xref rid="fn734">7</xref></sup> so that man lies down and sleeps whilst He sustains him and heals him and (gives) him life and repose, as it is said, &#x201C;I should have slept: then had I been at rest&#x201D; (Job iii. 18). The Holy One, blessed be He, supports (man) with<sup><xref rid="fn735">1</xref></sup> the earth, giving it water; and it yields its fruit and food for all creatures&#x2014;but the first<sup><xref rid="fn736">2</xref></sup> man&#x2019;s food &#x201C;in toil<sup><xref rid="fn737">3</xref></sup> shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life&#x201D; (Gen. iii. 17).</p>
<p>The Holy One, blessed be He, had compassion upon the first man (Adam), and, in order that he should not feel any pain, He cast upon him the sleep of deep slumber,<sup><xref rid="fn738">4</xref></sup> and He made him sleep whilst He took one of his bones from his side and flesh from his heart<sup><xref rid="fn739">5</xref></sup> and made it into an help (meet for him) and placed her opposite to him. When he awoke from his sleep he saw her standing opposite to him.<sup><xref rid="fn740">6</xref></sup> And he said, &#x201C;Bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> ii. 28). As long as he was alone he was called Adam (man).<sup><xref rid="fn741">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah<sup><xref rid="fn742">8</xref></sup> said: Because of the name Adamah (ground) whence he was taken, his name was called Adam. Rabbi Joshua ben &#x1E32;orchah said: He was called Adam because of his flesh and blood (<italic>d&#x0101;m</italic><sup><xref rid="fn743">9</xref></sup>). He said to him: Adam &#x0021; Adam &#x0021; And when an help-mate had been built for him, his name was called <italic>&#x00EA;sh</italic> (fire), and she (was called) <italic>&#x00EA;sh</italic> (fire).<sup><xref rid="fn744">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He put His name (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D9;&#x05D4;</span>) between their (names), saying: If they go in My ways &#x007C;&#x007C; and keep all My precepts, behold My name is given to them,<sup><xref rid="fn745">2</xref></sup> it will deliver them from all distress. If they do not (walk in My ways), behold I will take away My name from their (names), and they will become <italic>&#x00EA;sh</italic> (fire).<sup><xref rid="fn746">3</xref></sup> And fire consumes fire, as it is said, &#x201C;For it is a <italic>fire</italic> that consumeth unto destruction&#x201D; (Job xxxi. 12).<sup><xref rid="fn747">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Holy One, blessed be He, made ten wedding canopies<sup><xref rid="fn748">5</xref></sup> for Adam in the garden of Eden. They were all (made) of precious stones, pearls, and gold. Is it not a fact that only one wedding canopy is made for every bridegroom,<sup><xref rid="fn749">6</xref></sup> whilst three wedding canopies are made for a king?<sup><xref rid="fn750">7</xref></sup> But in order to bestow special honour upon the first man, the Holy One, blessed be He, made ten (wedding canopies) in the garden of Eden, as it is said, &#x201C;Wast thou in Eden the garden of God; was every precious stone<sup><xref rid="fn751">8</xref></sup> thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold?&#x201D; (Ezek. xxviii. 13).<sup><xref rid="fn752">9</xref></sup> Behold these are the ten canopies. The angels were playing upon timbrels and dancing with pipes,<sup><xref rid="fn753">1</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;The workmanship<sup><xref rid="fn754">2</xref></sup> of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was with thee&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>On the day when the first man was created, as it is said, &#x201C;In the day when thou<sup><xref rid="fn755">3</xref></sup> wast created they were prepared&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>), the Holy One, blessed be He, said to the ministering angels: Come, let us descend and render loving service to the first man and to his help-mate, for the world rests upon the attribute of the service of loving-kindness.<sup><xref rid="fn756">4</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, said: More beloved is the service of loving-kindness than the sacrifices and burnt-offerings which Israel will bring in the future upon the altar before Me, as it is said, &#x007C;&#x007C; &#x201C;For I desire love, and not sacrifice&#x201D; (Hos. vi. 6).<sup><xref rid="fn757">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The ministering angels were going to and fro and walking before him like friends who guard the wedding canopies,<sup><xref rid="fn758">6</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;For he shall give his angels charge over thee,<sup><xref rid="fn759">7</xref></sup> to keep thee in all thy <italic>ways</italic>&#x201D; (Ps. xci. 11). (The word) &#x201C;<italic>way</italic>&#x201D; here means only the way<sup><xref rid="fn760">8</xref></sup> of bridegrooms. The Holy One, blessed be He, was like a precentor.<sup><xref rid="fn761">9</xref></sup> What is the custom observed by the precentor? He stands and blesses the bride in the midst of her wedding chamber.<sup><xref rid="fn762">1</xref></sup> Likewise the Holy One, blessed be He, stood and blessed Adam and his help-mate, as it is said, &#x201C;And God blessed them&#x201D; (Gen. i. 28).<sup><xref rid="fn763">2</xref></sup></p>

<h1><small>THE SERPENT IN PARADISE</small> [15<small>A</small>. ii.]</h1>
<p>&#x201C;E<small>NVY</small>, cupidity, and ambition remove man (Adam) from the world.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn769">2</xref></sup> The ministering angels<sup><xref rid="fn770">3</xref></sup> spake before the Holy One, blessed be He, saying: Sovereign of all Worlds&#x0021; &#x201C;What is man, that thou shouldst take note of him?&#x201D; (Ps. cxliv. 3). &#x201C;Man (Adam) is like unto vanity&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn771">4</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic> 4), upon earth there is not his like.<sup><xref rid="fn772">5</xref></sup> (God) answered them: Just as all of you praise Me in the heights of heaven so he professes My Unity on earth,<sup><xref rid="fn773">6</xref></sup> nay, moreover, are you able to stand up and call the names for all the creatures which I have created? They stood up, but were unable (to give the names). Forthwith Adam stood up and called the names for all His creatures, as it is said, &#x201C;And the man gave names to all cattle&#x201D; (Gen. ii. 20). When the ministering angels saw this they retreated,<sup><xref rid="fn774">7</xref></sup> and the ministering angels said: If we do not take &#x007C;&#x007C; counsel against this man so that he sin before his Creator, we cannot prevail against him.<sup><xref rid="fn775">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Sammael was the great prince in heaven;<sup><xref rid="fn776">1</xref></sup> the Chajj&#x00F4;th<sup><xref rid="fn777">2</xref></sup> had four wings and the Seraphim had six wings, and Sammael had twelve wings. What did Sammael do? He took his band<sup><xref rid="fn778">3</xref></sup> and descended<sup><xref rid="fn779">4</xref></sup> and saw all the creatures which the Holy One, blessed be He, had created in His world and he found among them none so skilled to do evil as the serpent, as it is said, &#x201C;Now the serpent was more subtil<sup><xref rid="fn780">5</xref></sup> than any beast of the field&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> iii. 1). Its appearance was something like that of the camel,<sup><xref rid="fn781">6</xref></sup> and he<sup><xref rid="fn782">7</xref></sup> mounted and rode upon it.<sup><xref rid="fn783">8</xref></sup> The Torah began to cry aloud, saying, Why, O Sammael&#x0021; now that the world is created, is it the time<sup><xref rid="fn784">9</xref></sup> to rebel against the Omnipresent? Is it like a time when thou shouldst lift up thyself on high?<sup><xref rid="fn785">10</xref></sup> The Lord of the world &#x201C;will laugh at the horse and its rider&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn786">11</xref></sup> (Job xxxix. 18).</p>
<p>A parable, to what is the matter like?<sup><xref rid="fn787">12</xref></sup> To a man in whom there was an evil spirit. All the deeds which he does,<sup><xref rid="fn788">1</xref></sup> or all the words which he utters, does he speak by his own intention? Does he not act only according to the idea of the evil spirit, which (rules) over him? So (was it with) the serpent. All the deeds which it did, and all the words which it spake, it did not speak<sup><xref rid="fn789">2</xref></sup> except by the intention of Sammael. Concerning him, the Scripture says, &#x201C;The wicked is thrust down in his evil-doing&#x201D; (Prov. xiv. 32).<sup><xref rid="fn790">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>A parable, to what is the matter like? To a king &#x007C;&#x007C; who married a woman and made her supreme over all that he had.<sup><xref rid="fn791">4</xref></sup> He said to her: All that I have shall be in thy hands, except this house,<sup><xref rid="fn792">5</xref></sup> which is full of scorpions. A certain old man visited her; he asks, for instance,<sup><xref rid="fn793">6</xref></sup> for vinegar. He said to her: Wilt thou argue that he deals kindly with thee?<sup><xref rid="fn794">7</xref></sup> He deals with me (thus): over all that he possesses has he made me supreme. Thus said he to her: Behold, all that I have is given into thy hands except this house,<sup><xref rid="fn792">5</xref></sup> which is full of scorpions. (The old man) said to her: Is not all the jewellery<sup><xref rid="fn795">8</xref></sup> of the king indeed in this house<sup><xref rid="fn792">5</xref></sup>? But<sup><xref rid="fn796">9</xref></sup> he wishes to marry another woman, and to give them to her. The king is the first man (Adam), the woman is Eve, and the one who asked for vinegar is the serpent;<sup><xref rid="fn797">10</xref></sup> and concerning them (the text) says, &#x201C;There are the workers of iniquity fallen, they are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn798">11</xref></sup> (Ps. xxxvi. 12).</p>
<p>The serpent argued with itself, saying: If I go and speak to Adam, I know that he will not listen to me, for a man is always hard<sup><xref rid="fn799">1</xref></sup> (to be persuaded), as it is said, &#x201C;For a man is churlish and evil in his doings&#x201D; (1 Sam. xxv. 3); but behold I will speak to Eve,<sup><xref rid="fn800">2</xref></sup> for I know that she will listen to me; for women listen to all creatures, as it is said, &#x201C;She is simple and knoweth nothing&#x201D; (Prov. ix. 18). The serpent went and spake to the woman:<sup><xref rid="fn801">3</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C; Is it<sup><xref rid="fn802">4</xref></sup> (true that) you also have been commanded concerning the fruit of the tree?<sup><xref rid="fn803">5</xref></sup> She said (to him): Yes, as it is said, &#x201C;Of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden&#x201D; (Gen. iii. 8). And when the serpent heard the words of Eve, he found a way<sup><xref rid="fn804">6</xref></sup> through which he could enter (to approach her), so he said to her: This precept is nought else except the evil eye, for in the hour when ye eat thereof, ye will be like Him, a God. Just as<sup><xref rid="fn805">7</xref></sup> He creates worlds and destroys worlds,<sup><xref rid="fn806">8</xref></sup> so will ye be able to create worlds and to destroy worlds. Just as He slays and brings to life, so also will ye be able to kill and to bring to life, as it is said, &#x201C;For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof,<sup><xref rid="fn807">1</xref></sup> then your eyes shall be opened&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 5).<sup><xref rid="fn808">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The serpent went and touched the tree, which commenced to cry out, saying:<sup><xref rid="fn809">3</xref></sup> Wicked One&#x0021; do not touch me&#x0021; as it is said, &#x201C;Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked drive me away. There are the workers of iniquity fallen&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn810">4</xref></sup> (Ps. xxxvi. 11, 12).</p>
<p>The serpent went and said to the woman: Behold, I touched it, but I did not die; thou also mayest touch it, and thou wilt not die.<sup><xref rid="fn811">5</xref></sup> The woman went and touched the tree, and she saw the angel of death<sup><xref rid="fn812">6</xref></sup> coming towards her; she said: Woe is me &#x0021; I shall now die, and the Holy One, blessed be He, will make another woman<sup><xref rid="fn813">7</xref></sup> and give her to Adam,<sup><xref rid="fn814">8</xref></sup> but behold I will cause &#x007C;&#x007C; him to eat with me; if we shall die, we shall both die,<sup><xref rid="fn815">9</xref></sup> and if we shall live, we shall both live. And she took of the fruits of the tree, and ate thereof, and also gave (of its fruits) to her husband, so that he should eat with her, as it is said, &#x201C;And she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also unto her husband with her&#x201D; (Gen. iii. 6). When Adam had eaten of the fruit of the tree, he saw that he was naked,<sup><xref rid="fn816">10</xref></sup> and his eyes were opened, and his teeth were set on edge. He said to her: What is this that thou hast given me to eat, that my eyes should be opened and my teeth set on edge?<sup><xref rid="fn817">11</xref></sup> Just as my teeth were set on edge, so shall the teeth of all generations be set on edge.<sup><xref rid="fn818">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>CHAPTER XIV</title>
<h1><small>THE SIN OF ADAM AND EVE</small> [16<small>A</small>. ii.]</h1>
<p>T<small>EN</small> descents upon the earth<sup><xref rid="fn819">1</xref></sup> were made by the Holy One, blessed be He; they were: (1) Once in the Garden of Eden; (2) once at (the time of) the generation of the Dispersion;<sup><xref rid="fn820">2</xref></sup> (8) once at Sodom;<sup><xref rid="fn821">3</xref></sup> (4) once at the thorn-bush;<sup><xref rid="fn822">4</xref></sup> (5) once in Egypt;<sup><xref rid="fn823">5</xref></sup> (6) once at Sinai;<sup><xref rid="fn824">6</xref></sup> (7) once at the cleft of the rock;<sup><xref rid="fn825">7</xref></sup> (8) and (9) twice in the tent of Assembly;<sup><xref rid="fn826">8</xref></sup> (10) once in the future.<sup><xref rid="fn827">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Once in the Garden of Eden; whence do we know? Because it is said, &#x201C;And they heard the voice of the Lord God <italic>walking</italic> in the garden<sup><xref rid="fn828">10</xref></sup> in the cool of the day&#x201D; (Gen. iii. 8). And it is written,<sup><xref rid="fn829">11</xref></sup> &#x201C;My beloved<sup><xref rid="fn830">12</xref></sup> <italic>is gone down</italic> to his garden, to the beds of spices&#x201D; (Cant. vi. 2). (God) sat in judgment,<sup><xref rid="fn831">1</xref></sup> and He judged with judgment. He said to him (Adam): Why didst thou flee<sup><xref rid="fn832">2</xref></sup> before Me? He answered Him: I heard Thy voice<sup><xref rid="fn833">3</xref></sup> and my bones trembled,<sup><xref rid="fn834">4</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, &#x007C;&#x007C; because I was naked: and I hid myself&#x201D; (Gen. iii. 10).<sup><xref rid="fn835">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>What was the dress of the first man? A skin of nail,<sup><xref rid="fn836">6</xref></sup> and a cloud of glory covered him. When he ate of the fruits of the tree, the nail-skin was stripped off him,<sup><xref rid="fn837">7</xref></sup> and the cloud of glory departed from him, and he saw himself naked, as it is said, &#x201C;And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked?<sup><xref rid="fn838">8</xref></sup> Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee?&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 11).</p>
<p>Adam said before the Holy One, blessed be He: Sovereign of all worlds&#x0021; When I was alone, I did not sin against Thee. But the woman whom Thou hast brought to me enticed me away from Thy ways,<sup><xref rid="fn839">1</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;The woman whom thou gavest to be with me,<sup><xref rid="fn840">2</xref></sup> she gave me of the tree, and I did eat&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 12). The Holy One, blessed be He, called<sup><xref rid="fn841">3</xref></sup> unto Eve, and said to her: Was it not enough for thee that thou didst sin in thy own person? But (also) that thou shouldst make Adam sin? She spake before Him: Sovereign of the world&#x0021; The serpent enticed my mind to sin before Thee, as it is said, &#x201C;The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 13). He brought the three<sup><xref rid="fn842">4</xref></sup> of them and passed sentence of judgment upon them, consisting of nine curses and death.</p>
<p>He cast down Sammael<sup><xref rid="fn843">5</xref></sup> and his troop from their holy place in heaven,<sup><xref rid="fn844">6</xref></sup> and cut off the feet of the serpent,<sup><xref rid="fn845">7</xref></sup> and decreed that it should cast its skin and suffer pain once in seven years in great pain, and cursed it &#x007C;&#x007C; that it should drag itself with its belly (on the ground), and its food is turned in its belly into dust<sup><xref rid="fn846">8</xref></sup> and the gall of asps,<sup><xref rid="fn847">9</xref></sup> and death is in its mouth,<sup><xref rid="fn848">10</xref></sup> and He put hatred between it and the children of the woman,<sup><xref rid="fn849">11</xref></sup> so that they should bruise its head,<sup><xref rid="fn850">1</xref></sup> and after all these (curses comes) death.<sup><xref rid="fn851">2</xref></sup> He gave the woman nine curses and death: the afflictions arising from menstruation and the tokens of virginity;<sup><xref rid="fn852">3</xref></sup> the affliction of conception in the womb; and the affliction of child-birth; and the affliction of bringing up children; and her head is covered like a mourner,<sup><xref rid="fn853">4</xref></sup> and it is not shaved except on account of immorality, and her ear is pierced like (the ears of) perpetual slaves;<sup><xref rid="fn854">5</xref></sup> and like a hand-maid she waits upon her husband; and she is not believed in (a matter of) testimony;<sup><xref rid="fn855">6</xref></sup> and after all these (curses comes) death.</p>
<p>He extended pardon<sup><xref rid="fn856">7</xref></sup> to Adam (as to a part of the) nine curses and death. He curtailed his strength, and He shortened his stature<sup><xref rid="fn857">8</xref></sup> by reason of the impurity connected with issues and with pollution;<sup><xref rid="fn858">9</xref></sup> as well as the impurity arising from sexual intercourse; he was to sow wheat and to reap thistles,<sup><xref rid="fn859">10</xref></sup> and his food was to be the grass of the earth, like that of the beast; and (he was to earn) his bread in anxiety, and his food by the sweat (of his brow); and after all these (curses came) death.<sup><xref rid="fn860">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>If Adam sinned, what was the sin of the earth, that it should be cursed? Because it did not speak against the (evil) deed,<sup><xref rid="fn861">2</xref></sup> therefore it was cursed; for in the hour when the sons of man transgress the graver sins &#x007C;&#x007C; God sends a plague<sup><xref rid="fn862">3</xref></sup> to the sons of man; and in the hour when the sons of man transgress sins less vital, He smites the fruits of the earth,<sup><xref rid="fn863">4</xref></sup> because of (the sins of) the sons of man, as it is said. &#x201C;Cursed is the ground for thy sake&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 17).</p>

Similarly also did the woman (receive) toil, and labour, and groans, and the pangs of parturition, and a state of subjection, that is, that she should serve her husband; so that they should neither perish altogether when cursed by God, nor, by remaining unreprimanded, should be led to despise God.

<title>CHAPTER XV</title>
<h1><small>THE TWO WAYS</small> [17<small>A</small>. i.]</h1>
<p>R<small>ABBI</small> E<small>LIEZER</small> said: I heard with my ear<sup><xref rid="fn866">1</xref></sup> the Lord of hosts speaking. What did He speak? He said: &#x201C;See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil&#x201D; (Deut. xxx. 15). The Holy One, blessed be He, said: Behold, these two ways<sup><xref rid="fn867">2</xref></sup> have I given to Israel, one is good, the other is evil. The one which is good, is of life; and the one which is evil, is of death.<sup><xref rid="fn868">3</xref></sup> The good way has two byways, one of righteousness and the other of love, and Elijah,<sup><xref rid="fn869">4</xref></sup> be he remembered for good, is placed exactly between these two ways.<sup><xref rid="fn870">5</xref></sup> When a man comes to enter (one of these ways), Elijah,<sup><xref rid="fn871">6</xref></sup> be he remembered for good, cries aloud concerning him, saying, &#x201C;Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth truth may enter in&#x201D; (Isa. xxvi. 2). And there cometh Samuel the prophet, and he places himself between these two byways.<sup><xref rid="fn872">1</xref></sup> He says: On which of these (two byways) shall I go? If I go on the way of righteousness, then (the path) of &#x007C;&#x007C; love is better than the former; if I go on the way of love, (the way) of righteousness is better: but I call heaven and earth to be my witnesses<sup><xref rid="fn873">2</xref></sup> that I will not give up either of them.<sup><xref rid="fn874">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Samuel &#x0021; Thou hast placed thyself between these two good byways. By thy life&#x0021; I will give to thee three good gifts. This teaches thee that everyone who doeth<sup><xref rid="fn875">4</xref></sup> righteousness and sheweth the service of love, shall inherit three good gifts, and they are: life, righteousness, and glory, as it is said, &#x201C;He that followeth after righteousness and love, findeth life, righteousness, and glory&#x201D; (Prov. xxi. 21). It is only written here (in the text): &#x201C;He findeth life, righteousness, and glory.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn876">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>(Leading) to the way of evil, there are four<sup><xref rid="fn877">6</xref></sup> doors, and at each door seven angels<sup><xref rid="fn878">7</xref></sup> are standing&#x2014;four without, and three within. The (angels) without are merciful, and those within are cruel. When a man comes to enter,<sup><xref rid="fn879">8</xref></sup> the merciful angels go to meet him and say to him: What hast thou to do with the fire yonder? What hast thou to do with those glowing coals?<sup><xref rid="fn880">9</xref></sup> Listen to us and repent.<sup><xref rid="fn881">1</xref></sup> If he hearken to them and repent, behold it is well, and if not, he says to them:<sup><xref rid="fn882">2</xref></sup> Amongst them (yonder) let my life (be). &#x007C;&#x007C; They say to him: Thou hast entered the first door; do not enter the second door. When he comes to enter the second door, the merciful angels go to meet him and say to him: What benefit is it to thee to be erased<sup><xref rid="fn883">3</xref></sup> from the Torah of thy God?<sup><xref rid="fn884">4</xref></sup> Would it not be better to be inscribed in the Torah of thy God? Hearken unto us and repent. If he listen to them and repent, it is well; and if not, he says to them:<sup><xref rid="fn885">5</xref></sup> With them yonder let my life (be). They say to him: Behold thou hast entered the second door, do not enter the third door. When he is about to enter the third door the merciful angels go to meet him and say to him:<sup><xref rid="fn886">6</xref></sup> What benefit is to thee that they (<italic>i.e</italic>. the good angels) should flee from thee and call thee &#x201C;Unclean&#x201D;? Would it not be better that they should call thee &#x201C;Pure One&#x201D; and not &#x201C;Unclean&#x201D;? Hearken to us and repent. If he hearken unto them, behold, it is well; and if not, he says unto them: With them (yonder) let my life (be). They say to him: Behold thou hast entered the third door; do not enter the fourth door&#x0021; When he is about to enter the fourth door the merciful angels go to meet him and say to him: Behold, thou hast entered these doors, and thou hast not hearkened nor returned.<sup><xref rid="fn887">7</xref></sup> Thus far the Holy One, blessed be He, receives &#x007C;&#x007C; the penitent; thus far the Holy One, blessed be He, pardons<sup><xref rid="fn888">1</xref></sup> and forgives,<sup><xref rid="fn889">2</xref></sup> and every day He says: Return, ye children of man, as it is said:<sup><xref rid="fn890">3</xref></sup> &#x201C;Thou turnest man to contrition&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn891">4</xref></sup> (Ps. xc. 8).</p>
<p>The cruel angels<sup><xref rid="fn892">5</xref></sup> say: Since he would not hearken to the first (angels), let us cause his spirit to depart, as it is said, &#x201C;Let his spirit go forth, let him return to his earth&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> cxlvi. 4). And concerning them<sup><xref rid="fn893">6</xref></sup> (the Scripture) says:<sup><xref rid="fn894">7</xref></sup> &#x201C;Upon the third and upon the fourth generation of them that hate me&#x201D; (Ex. xx. 5); and another verse says: &#x201C;Lo, all these things doth God work, twice, yea thrice, with a man&#x201D; (Job xxxiii. 29). And thus He calls to Eliezer.<sup><xref rid="fn895">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Holy One, blessed be He, said: Eliezer &#x0021; Thou hast made thyself like a threefold cord,<sup><xref rid="fn896">9</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And a threefold cord is not quickly broken&#x201D; (Eccles. iv. 12). I also will apply to thee this verse: &#x201C;Thou shalt be perfect with the Lord thy God&#x201D; (Deut. xviii. 18). Do not read thus, but: &#x201C;Thou shalt be perfect <italic>before</italic><sup><xref rid="fn897">10</xref></sup> the Lord thy God.&#x201D;</p>
<ftnote id="fn866"><sup>1</sup> See Isa. v. 9, and note the Targum thereon. R. Eliezer ben Hyr&#x1E33;anos was held to be worthy of being endowed with the Holy Spirit; see T.J. So&#x1E6D;ah (end) and T.B. Synhedrin, 11a; Jal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D;, Job, &#x00A7; 919.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn867"><sup>2</sup> The theme of this chapter of our book is the Jewish doctrine of the Two Ways, the ways of good and evil, or of life and death. Adam did not keep the &#x201C;way of life&#x201D; (see <italic>supra</italic>, p. 85); he disobeyed God by taking of the fruit of the tree of &#x201C;good and evil.&#x201D; The &#x201C;Way of Life&#x201D; in Paradise was guarded by the Cherubim, and the earthly way of &#x201C;good and evil&#x201D; is likewise in the charge of angels, good and evil. Slavonic Enoch xxx. 15 connects the &#x201C;two ways&#x201D; with Adam before his disobedience. On the &#x201C;Two Ways&#x201D; see <italic>Jewish Sources of the Sermon on the Mount</italic>, pp. 239 ff. See also Gen. Rab. xxi. 5. The Christian literature has also its doctrine of the Two Ways; see the <italic>Apostolic Constitutions</italic>, vii. 1; Epistle of Barnabas xviii.&#x2013;xx.; Hermas, Mand. vi. 2; Pseudo-Clementine Homilies, v. 7; and for &#x201C;Heaven and Hell&#x201D; see the <italic>Revelation of Peter</italic> (ed. Robinson and James, 1892, pp. 48 ff.). See also Test. XII Pat., Asher i. 3, with Charles&#x2019; note <italic>in loc</italic>. Some of the printed texts read &#x201C;two words&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;two ways.&#x201D; The latter is, of course, the correct reading; see Jal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D;, Job, <italic>loc. cit</italic>.</ftnote>

On the idea in our Midrash see 1 Sam. ii. 26; according to this text, Samuel grew in favour with God and man. The favour of God is the result of &#x201C;righteousness,&#x201D; whilst the favour of man is due to &#x201C;love&#x201D; between man and his fellow.</ftnote>

The &#x201C;flaming fire&#x201D; is outside Paradise. For the &#x201C;everlasting fire&#x201D; in the New Testament see Matt. xxv. 41; the old editions (<italic>e.g</italic>.

<title>CHAPTER XVI</title>
<h1><small>THE SERVICE OF LOVING-KINDNESS</small> [17<small>B</small>. ii.]</h1>
<p>T<small>HE</small> world rests upon three things: upon the Torah, upon Divine Worship, and upon the service of loving-kindness.<sup><xref rid="fn900">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;Upon the Torah,&#x201D; whence do we know (this)? Because it is written, &#x201C;If my covenant<sup><xref rid="fn901">2</xref></sup> of <italic>day and night</italic> stand not&#x201D; (Jer. xxxiii. 25); and (another text) says, &#x201C;This book of the Torah shall not depart out of thy mouth,<sup><xref rid="fn902">3</xref></sup> but thou shalt meditate therein <italic>day and night</italic>&#x201D; (Josh. i. 8). Whence do we know (that the world rests) upon the service of loving-kindness? Because it is said, &#x201C;For I desired love, &#x007C;&#x007C; and not sacrifice&#x201D; (Hos. vi. 6). Whence do we know (that the world rests) upon Divine Worship? Because it is written, &#x201C;And the prayer of the upright is his delight&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn903">4</xref></sup> (Prov. xv. 8).<sup><xref rid="fn904">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Whence do we learn of the service of loving-kindness for bridegrooms? We learn (this) from the Holy One, blessed be He; for He Himself bestowed loving-kindness upon Adam and his help-mate. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to the ministering angels: Come ye and let us show loving-kindness to Adam and his help-mate. The Holy One, blessed be He, descended with the ministering angels to show loving-kindness to Adam and his help-mate.<sup><xref rid="fn905">1</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, said: More beloved unto Me is the service of loving-kindness than sacrifices and burnt-offering which Israel, in the future, will bring on the altar before Me, as it is said, &#x201C;For I <italic>desired</italic> love, and not sacrifice&#x201D; (Hos. vi. 6).<sup><xref rid="fn906">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jos&#x00E9; said: From whom do we learn of the seven days of banquet?<sup><xref rid="fn907">3</xref></sup> From our father Jacob.<sup><xref rid="fn908">4</xref></sup> For when our father Jacob married Leah, he made a banquet with rejoicing for seven days, as it is said, &#x201C;Fulfil the <italic>week</italic><sup><xref rid="fn909">5</xref></sup> of this one&#x201D; (Gen. xxix. 27).<sup><xref rid="fn910">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Simeon<sup><xref rid="fn911">1</xref></sup> said: Our father Abraham wrote (in his will and bequeathed) all that he had as an inheritance<sup><xref rid="fn912">2</xref></sup> to Isaac, as it is said, &#x201C;And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxv. 5). He took the document and gave it into the hands of Eliezer, his servant, (who) said, Since the document is in my hand all his money is in my hand,<sup><xref rid="fn913">3</xref></sup> so that he might go and be recommended<sup><xref rid="fn914">4</xref></sup> (thereby) in his<sup><xref rid="fn915">5</xref></sup> father&#x2019;s house and with his family.</p>
<p>From Kirjath &#x007C;&#x007C; Arba unto Haran was a journey of seventeen days; and in three hours<sup><xref rid="fn916">6</xref></sup> the servant came to Haran. He was astonished in his mind<sup><xref rid="fn917">7</xref></sup> and he said: This day I went forth, and this day I arrived, as it is said, &#x201C;And I came <italic>this day</italic> unto the fountain&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxiv. 42).</p>
<p>Rabbi Abbahu said: The Holy One, blessed be He, wished to show loving-kindness to Isaac, and he sent an angel<sup><xref rid="fn918">8</xref></sup> before Eliezer; and the way was shortened for him, so that the servant came to Haran in three hours.</p>
<p>And everything<sup><xref rid="fn919">9</xref></sup> is revealed before the Holy One, blessed be He. A daughter of kings,<sup><xref rid="fn920">10</xref></sup> who in all her life had never gone forth to draw water, went out to draw water in that hour. And the girl, who did not know who the man<sup><xref rid="fn921">11</xref></sup> was, accepted (the proposal) to be married to Isaac. Why? Because she had been destined<sup><xref rid="fn922">1</xref></sup> for him from his mother&#x2019;s womb,<sup><xref rid="fn923">2</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;In the balances they will go up, they are together lighter than vanity&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn924">3</xref></sup> (Ps. lxii. 9).</p>
<p>Laban and Bethuel answered: Since (this) word has come forth from the mouth of the Almighty, we cannot prevent it, as it is said, &#x201C;Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the Lord:<sup><xref rid="fn925">4</xref></sup> we cannot speak unto thee bad or good&#x201D; (Gen. xxiv. 50). &#x201C;Behold, Rebecca is before thee; take her and go&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 51).</p>
<p>The servant arose early in the morning and saw the angel standing and waiting for him in the street. He said to them:<sup><xref rid="fn926">5</xref></sup> &#x201C;Do not hinder me,<sup><xref rid="fn927">6</xref></sup> for the Lord hath prospered my way&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 56). For behold, the man who came with me yesterday, he has prospered my way; behold, he is standing &#x007C;&#x007C; and waiting for me in the street,<sup><xref rid="fn928">7</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And he said to them, Do not hinder me, for the Lord hath prospered my way.&#x201D; They ate and drank at Rebecca&#x2019;s (bridal) banquet.<sup><xref rid="fn929">8</xref></sup> Like a precentor, who is standing and blessing the bride in her bridal canopy,<sup><xref rid="fn930">9</xref></sup> so they stood and blessed Rebecca their sister (wedded) to Isaac, as it is said, &#x201C;And they blessed Rebecca, and said unto her, Our sister&#x2026;&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 60).<sup><xref rid="fn931">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>At six hours of the day<sup><xref rid="fn932">11</xref></sup> the servant went forth from Haran, and he took Rebecca and Deborah her nurse and made them ride upon the camels. So that the servant should not be alone with the maiden (Rebecca) by night, the earth was contracted<sup><xref rid="fn933">1</xref></sup> before him, and in three hours the servant came to Hebron at the time of the prayer of the afternoon-evening.<sup><xref rid="fn934">2</xref></sup> And Isaac had gone forth to say the afternoon-evening prayer, as it is said, &#x201C;And Isaac went forth to <italic>meditate</italic> in the field towards even&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 63).<sup><xref rid="fn935">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Simeon<sup><xref rid="fn936">4</xref></sup> said: Abraham spake to Isaac his son (saying), This servant<sup><xref rid="fn937">5</xref></sup> is suspected of all the transgressions of the Torah, and deceit is in this servant,<sup><xref rid="fn938">6</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;He is a Canaanite,<sup><xref rid="fn939">7</xref></sup> the balances of deceit are in his hand; he loveth to defraud&#x201D; (Hos. xii. 7). See, lest he has defiled her,<sup><xref rid="fn940">8</xref></sup> therefore bring the girl into the tent and examine her tactually;<sup><xref rid="fn941">9</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C; and if she be undefiled, behold, she is destined for thee from her mother&#x2019;s womb.<sup><xref rid="fn942">1</xref></sup> He brought her into the tent and examined her tactually, and he showed the result to Abraham his father, and afterwards he took her to be his wife, as it is said, &#x201C;And Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother&#x2026; And Isaac was comforted after his mother&#x2019;s death&#x201D; (Gen. xxiv. 67);<sup><xref rid="fn943">2</xref></sup> for the deeds of Rebecca were like unto those of Sarah.<sup><xref rid="fn944">3</xref></sup> Hence the Israelites have the custom of producing the tokens of the damsel&#x2019;s virginity,<sup><xref rid="fn945">4</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel&#x2019;s virginity&#x201D; (Deut. xxii. 15).<sup><xref rid="fn946">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The steward of Abraham&#x2019;s household<sup><xref rid="fn947">6</xref></sup> was his servant Eliezer, and whence was his servant? When (Abraham) went forth from Ur of the Chaldees all the magnates of the kingdom<sup><xref rid="fn948">7</xref></sup> came to give him gifts; and Nimrod<sup><xref rid="fn949">8</xref></sup> took his first-born (son)<sup><xref rid="fn950">9</xref></sup> Eliezer and gave him to (Abraham) as a perpetual slave.</p>
<p>When (Eliezer had thus) dealt kindly with Isaac, he set him free, and the Holy One, blessed be He, gave him his reward in this world, so that there should not be a reward for the wicked in the world to come;<sup><xref rid="fn951">1</xref></sup> and He raised him to kingship, and he is Og, king of Bashan.<sup><xref rid="fn952">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jos&#x00E9;<sup><xref rid="fn953">3</xref></sup> said: From whom do we learn (that there should be) seven days of (the wedding) banquet?<sup><xref rid="fn954">4</xref></sup> From our father Jacob, who &#x007C;&#x007C; made a banquet with rejoicing for seven days, and he took Leah (as his wife). Again he kept another seven days of banquet and rejoicing, and took Rachel (as his wife), as it is said, &#x201C;And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast&#x201D; (Gen. xxix. 22). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them: Ye have shown loving-kindness to Jacob, My servant. I will give a reward to your children, so that there be no reward for the wicked in the world to come: &#x201C;Because by him the Lord <italic>had given</italic> victory unto Syria&#x201D; (2 Kings v. 1). From whom do we learn (that there should be) seven days of banquet? From Samson the Nazirite of God, for when he went down to the land of the Philistines, he took a wife and kept seven days of banquet and rejoicing, as it is said, &#x201C;And it came to pass, when they saw him,<sup><xref rid="fn955">5</xref></sup> that they brought thirty companions to be with him&#x201D; (Judg. xiv. 11). What were they doing with him? They were eating and drinking and rejoicing,<sup><xref rid="fn956">6</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And Samson said unto them, Let me now put forth a riddle unto you&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 12); and another text says, &#x201C;They could not declare the riddle in three days&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 14).<sup><xref rid="fn957">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The bridegroom is like a king. Just as a king is praised by everybody,<sup><xref rid="fn958">8</xref></sup> so is the bridegroom praised by everybody (during) the seven days of the feast. Just as a king is dressed in garments of glory,<sup><xref rid="fn959">1</xref></sup> so the bridegroom is dressed in garments of glory.<sup><xref rid="fn960">2</xref></sup> Just as a king is rejoicing, with feasts in his presence, all his days, so &#x007C;&#x007C; the bridegroom is rejoicing and has feasts before him all the seven days of the banquet. Just as the king does not go into the market-place alone, likewise the bridegroom does not go into the market-place alone.<sup><xref rid="fn961">3</xref></sup> Just as the face of a king is shining like the light of a sun,<sup><xref rid="fn962">4</xref></sup> so the face of the bridegroom is shining like the light of a sun, as it is said, &#x201C;And he<sup><xref rid="fn963">5</xref></sup> is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,<sup><xref rid="fn964">6</xref></sup> and rejoicing to run his course&#x201D; (Ps. xix. 5).</p>

<ftnote id="fn901"><sup>2</sup> God&#x2019;s covenant is the Torah; see T.B. Sabbath, 33a; cf. T.B. Pesachim, 54a; and T.B. Nedarim, 32a. The argument by analogy afforded by comparing similar words in two different verses of Scripture is known as &#x201C;Ge&#x1E93;erah Shavah,&#x201D; and is employed here. For examples see Levy, <italic>N.H.W.</italic> i. 320 f.; and cf. Bacher&#x2019;s <italic>Terminologie,</italic> i. <italic>s.v.</italic> pp. 13 ff.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn902"><sup>3</sup> The rest of the verse is omitted by our MS.; it occurs in the first editions. The MS. adds the paragraph following dealing with the service of loving-kindness.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn903"><sup>4</sup> Luria thinks that the text should read: &#x201C;(The world rests) upon Divine Worship. What is this (Worship)? Prayer.&#x201D; The preceding part of the verse quoted reads: &#x201C;The <italic>sacrifice</italic> of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord, and the prayer of the upright is his <italic>delight</italic>&#x201D; (Prov. xv. 8). In Mal. ii. 13 &#x201C;delight&#x201D; is used instead of &#x201C;offering.&#x201D; On this theme see Aboth de R. Nathan (<italic>a</italic>) iv. p. 9b; T. J. Megillah iii. 7. 74b; Num. Rab. xii. 12. The ethical lesson here is noteworthy: knowledge of God&#x2019;s Law must find expression, on the one hand, in Divine Worship, and, on the other, in the service of loving-kindness to humanity. Judaism claims to be the highest expression of religious truth, and stands or falls by the ethical teaching it enunciates.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn904"><sup>5</sup> The first editions add: &#x201C;What is the Divine Worship? Prayer, for thus we find in Daniel, to whom Darius said: &#x2018;Thy God whom thou <italic>servest</italic> continually, he will deliver thee&#x2019; (Dan. vi. 16). Was there any Divine Worship in Babylon?<sup><xref rid="fn965">1</xref></sup> But this (refers to) Prayer.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn905"><sup>1</sup> In the Garden of Eden; see <italic>supra,</italic> pp. 88 ff.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn906"><sup>2</sup> See <italic>supra,</italic> pp. 76, 84, 89, for the idea that the world rests on love. Here the stress is on &#x201C;<italic>I desired</italic>,&#x201D; since God&#x2019;s desire or will is the cause of the world&#x2019;s existence. The bridegroom is especially mentioned, because the study of the Torah is to be set aside in order to render the service of loving-kindness to the bride and bridegroom. The Jewish teachers did not encourage celibacy; neither was the cult of virginity considered a desirable element in religion, as was the case in the Christian Church. It is possible that the emphasis laid on the Divine participation in Adam&#x2019;s nuptials was intended to counteract the attitude of the Church towards marriage; see I Cor. vii. 8; Matt. xix. 10, 12. This section in our book should be compared with the latter part of Chapter XII.; see also Pesi&#x1E33;ta de R. Kahana, p. 172b (end).</ftnote>

The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them: Ye have shown loving-kindness to Jacob, My servant.

<h1><small>LOVING SERVICE TO MOURNERS</small> [19<small>A</small>. ii.]</h1>
<p>C<small>ONCERNING</small> the one who tenders the service of loving-kindness to mourners.<sup><xref rid="fn971">1</xref></sup> Whence do we learn of the service of loving-kindness to mourners?<sup><xref rid="fn972">2</xref></sup> From the Omnipresent, who alone showed loving-kindness to Moses, His servant, and buried him<sup><xref rid="fn973">3</xref></sup> with His own hand. If this story had not been written (in the Torah) it would be impossible to say it, as it is said, &#x201C;And he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab&#x201D; (Deut. xxxiv. 6).<sup><xref rid="fn974">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabban Gamaliel,<sup><xref rid="fn975">5</xref></sup> the son of R. Jehudah, said: Not to Moses alone did He show loving-kindness, but also to Aaron. For when they<sup><xref rid="fn976">6</xref></sup> went up Mount Hor all the tribes of Israel were contending and saying, Moses and Eleazar have left Aaron on Mount Hor and have gone down (by themselves).<sup><xref rid="fn977">7</xref></sup> They did not believe that he was dead. To show loving-kindness to him, what did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He took Aaron&#x2019;s coffin and brought it above the camp of Israel, and all Israel saw Aaron&#x2019;s coffin flying and moving in the air.<sup><xref rid="fn978">1</xref></sup> They then believed that he was dead, and they showed loving-kindness to him, as it is said: &#x007C;&#x007C; &#x201C;And <italic>all</italic> the congregation <italic>saw</italic> that Aaron was dead&#x201D; (Num. xx. 29). Only the men<sup><xref rid="fn979">2</xref></sup> showed loving-kindness to Moses, as it is said, &#x201C;And the <italic>sons</italic> of Israel wept for Moses&#x201D; (Deut. xxxiv. 8). The men and the women and the children<sup><xref rid="fn980">3</xref></sup> showed loving-kindness to Aaron.</p>
<p>Why (was this)? Because he loved peace and pursued peace,<sup><xref rid="fn981">4</xref></sup> and passed daily through the entire camp of Israel and promoted peace between a man and his wife, and between a man and his neighbour; therefore <italic>all</italic> Israel showed loving-kindness to him, as it is said, &#x201C;And when <italic>all</italic> the congregation saw that Aaron was dead,<sup><xref rid="fn982">5</xref></sup> they wept for Aaron thirty days, even <italic>all</italic> the house of Israel&#x201D; (Num. xx. 29).<sup><xref rid="fn983">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jos&#x00E9; said: From whom do we learn of the seven days of mourning?<sup><xref rid="fn984">7</xref></sup> From Jacob, our father, for thus did his son Joseph unto him,<sup><xref rid="fn985">8</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And he made a mourning for his father seven days&#x201D; (Gen. 1. 10).<sup><xref rid="fn986">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Whence do we learn (the duty of) showing loving-kindness to mourners? From Jezebel, the daughter of Ethbaal.<sup><xref rid="fn987">1</xref></sup> The palace of Jezebel, daughter of Ethbaal, was near the market-place.<sup><xref rid="fn988">2</xref></sup> When any corpse was carried through the market-place, she would go forth from her palace, and she clapped<sup><xref rid="fn989">3</xref></sup> with the palms of her hands and praised with her mouth, and she followed the corpse<sup><xref rid="fn990">4</xref></sup> ten steps. Concerning her, Elijah, be he remembered for good,<sup><xref rid="fn991">5</xref></sup> prophesied (and said): &#x201C;In the portion of Jezreel shall the dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel&#x201D; (2 Kings ix. 36). But over the limbs which were (employed in) showing loving-kindness, the dogs had no power, as it is said, &#x201C;And they went &#x007C;&#x007C; to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 35).<sup><xref rid="fn992">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Whence do we learn (the duty of) showing loving-kindness to mourners? From the men of Jabesh-Gilead. For when Saul and his sons were slain, the men of Jabesh Gilead said: Are we not bound to show loving-kindness to the man who delivered us from the disgrace of the sons of Ammon?<sup><xref rid="fn993">1</xref></sup> All their mighty men arose and went all night to the walls of Beth-Shan,<sup><xref rid="fn994">2</xref></sup> and they took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the walls of Beth-Shan, as it is said, &#x201C;All the valiant men arose, and took away the body of Saul&#x201D; (1 Chron. x. 12).</p>
<p>The mourners are comforted with bread and wine,<sup><xref rid="fn995">3</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto the bitter in soul&#x201D; (Prov. xxxi. 6).<sup><xref rid="fn996">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The men of Jabesh-Gilead showed (loving-kindness<sup><xref rid="fn997">5</xref></sup>) to Saul and his sons.<sup><xref rid="fn998">6</xref></sup> (God said,) I will also give you and your sons your reward in the future; for when the Holy One, blessed be He, in the future will gather Israel from the four corners of the world, the first whom He will gather, will be the half-tribe of Manasseh,<sup><xref rid="fn999">7</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine&#x201D; (Ps. lx. 7). Afterwards (will He gather in) Ephraim,<sup><xref rid="fn1000">1</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Ephraim is the defence of mine head&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). Afterwards Judah (will be gathered in), as it is said, &#x201C;Judah is my sceptre&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>&#x201C;Gilead is mine,&#x201D; refers to Ahab, king of Israel, who died in Ramoth-Gilead;<sup><xref rid="fn1001">2</xref></sup> &#x201C;and Manasseh is mine,&#x201D; is to be taken literally; &#x201C;Ephraim is the defence of mine head,&#x201D; refers to Jeroboam;<sup><xref rid="fn1002">3</xref></sup> &#x201C;Judah &#x007C;&#x007C; is my sceptre,&#x201D; points to Ahithophel;<sup><xref rid="fn1003">4</xref></sup> &#x201C;Moab is my <italic>washpot</italic>&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 8), means Gehazi;<sup><xref rid="fn1004">5</xref></sup> &#x201C;upon Edom will I cast my shoe&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>), refers to Doeg;<sup><xref rid="fn1005">6</xref></sup> &#x201C;Philistia, shout thou because of me&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). The Holy One, blessed be He, said:<sup><xref rid="fn1006">7</xref></sup> It is for Me to search for merit on their behalf,<sup><xref rid="fn1007">8</xref></sup> and to make them friendly towards one another.<sup><xref rid="fn1008">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Phineas said: Thirty years<sup><xref rid="fn1009">10</xref></sup> after Saul and his sons had been killed, a famine lasting three years arose in the days of David, year after year,<sup><xref rid="fn1010">11</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year&#x201D; (2 Sam. xxi. 1). Why was it year after year? In the first year all Israel went up to (celebrate the great) festivals. David said to them: Go and look if perchance there be among you some who worship idols, for because of the sin of idolatry rain is withheld, as it is said, &#x201C;Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived,<sup><xref rid="fn1011">12</xref></sup> and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them&#x201D; (Deut. xi. 16). What is written after this? &#x201C;And the anger of the Lord will be kindled against you, and he will shut up the heaven, that there be no rain&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 17).<sup><xref rid="fn1012">1</xref></sup> They went forth and investigated, but did not find (any idolatry).</p>
<p>In the second year<sup><xref rid="fn1013">2</xref></sup> all Israel went up (to celebrate) the festivals. David said to them: Go forth and see if there be among you people who lead immoral lives, because owing to the sin of immorality the heavens<sup><xref rid="fn1014">3</xref></sup> are closed, as it is said, &#x201C;And thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1015">4</xref></sup> (Jer. iii. 2). What is written after this in this context? &#x201C;Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 3). They investigated, but they did not find (any immoral people).</p>
<p>In the third &#x007C;&#x007C; year all Israel went up (to celebrate) the festivals. David said to them: Go forth and see if there be among you people who shed blood, because on account of the sin of those who murder<sup><xref rid="fn1016">5</xref></sup> the rain is withheld, as it is said, &#x201C;So ye shall not pollute the land<sup><xref rid="fn1017">6</xref></sup> wherein ye are; for blood, it polluteth the land&#x201D; (Num. xxxv. 33). They went forth and investigated, but they did not find (any murderer). David said to them: Henceforth the matter only depends upon me.</p>
<p>David arose and prayed before the Holy One, blessed be He. And He answered him: It is for Saul;<sup><xref rid="fn1018">7</xref></sup> was not Saul one who was anointed with the oil of consecration? and was it not Saul in whose days there was no idolatry in Israel? and was it not Saul who secured his portion<sup><xref rid="fn1019">8</xref></sup> with Samuel the prophet? Yet ye are in the land (of Israel) and he is (buried) outside the land (of Israel).</p>
<p>David forthwith arose and gathered together all the elders of Israel and the nobles, and they crossed the Jordan. They came to Jabesh-Gilead and they found the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son. No worm<sup><xref rid="fn1020">1</xref></sup> had been able to touch<sup><xref rid="fn1021">2</xref></sup> them, as it is said, &#x201C;He keepeth all his bones,<sup><xref rid="fn1022">3</xref></sup> not one of them is broken&#x201D; (Ps. xxxiv. 20). They took the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son, and placed them in a coffin, and they crossed the Jordan, as it is said, &#x201C;And they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son&#x2026; and they performed<sup><xref rid="fn1023">4</xref></sup> all that the king commanded&#x201D; (2 Sam. xxi. 14). The king commanded that they should bring the coffin of Saul in all the borders of each tribe. And it came to pass that the tribe &#x007C;&#x007C; wherein they brought the coffin of Saul, the people (there) with their wives and their sons and their daughters came forth and displayed loving-kindness to Saul and to his sons, so that all Israel should discharge their obligation of showing loving-kindness. And thus (did they do) until it came to the border of his possession to the border of Jerusalem,<sup><xref rid="fn1024">5</xref></sup> in the land of Benjamin<sup><xref rid="fn1025">6</xref></sup> in Jerusalem, as it is said, &#x201C;And they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn1026">7</xref></sup> in the vicinity of Jerusalem. When the Holy One, blessed be He, saw that all Israel had displayed loving-kindness (to him<sup><xref rid="fn1027">8</xref></sup>), He was forthwith full of compassion, and He sent rain upon the land, as it is said, &#x201C;And after that God was intreated for the land&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>Rabbi Nathaniel said: Three hundred years<sup><xref rid="fn1028">1</xref></sup> before the birth of Josiah, was his name mentioned,<sup><xref rid="fn1029">2</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Behold, a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name&#x201D; (1 Kings xiii. 2); &#x201C;And he was eight years old when he began to reign&#x201D; (2 Kings xxii. 1). What is the disposition of a lad of eight years of age?<sup><xref rid="fn1030">3</xref></sup> He despised<sup><xref rid="fn1031">4</xref></sup> the idols and broke in pieces the pillars, and smashed the images<sup><xref rid="fn1032">5</xref></sup> and cut down the groves.<sup><xref rid="fn1033">6</xref></sup> His merit was great<sup><xref rid="fn1034">7</xref></sup> before the<sup><xref rid="fn1035">8</xref></sup> Throne of Glory. Because of the evil which Israel did in secret<sup><xref rid="fn1036">9</xref></sup> the righteous one<sup><xref rid="fn1037">10</xref></sup> was gathered (to his fathers), as it is said, &#x201C;For the righteous is taken away because of the evil&#x201D; (Isa. lvii. 1).<sup><xref rid="fn1038">11</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C; All<sup><xref rid="fn1039">12</xref></sup> Judah gathered together also with Jeremiah the prophet to show loving-kindness to Josiah, as it is said, &#x201C;And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah,<sup><xref rid="fn1040">13</xref></sup> and all <italic>the singing men</italic> and <italic>the singing women</italic> spake of Josiah&#x201D; (2 Chron. xxxv. 25). Rabbi Meir said: &#x201C;The singing men&#x201D; refer to the Levites, who stood upon the platform<sup><xref rid="fn1041">14</xref></sup> singing; &#x201C;and the singing women&#x201D; refer to their wives. Rabbi Simeon said: These terms do not refer merely to the Levites and their wives; but to the skilled women, as it is said, &#x201C;Thus saith the Lord of hosts,<sup><xref rid="fn1042">1</xref></sup> Consider ye, and call for the mourning women,<sup><xref rid="fn1043">2</xref></sup> that they may come; and send for the <italic>cunning</italic> women, that they may come: and let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us&#x201D; (Jer. ix. 17, 18). Hence the wise men instituted (the rule) that this should be done<sup><xref rid="fn1044">3</xref></sup> to all the <italic>wise</italic> men of Israel and to their great<sup><xref rid="fn1045">4</xref></sup> men, as it is said, &#x201C;And they made them an ordinance in Israel&#x201D; (2 Chron. xxxv. 25).</p>
<p>Solomon saw that the observance<sup><xref rid="fn1046">5</xref></sup> of loving-kindness was great before the Holy One, blessed be He. When he built the Temple he erected two gates, one for the bridegrooms, and the other for the mourners and the excommunicated. On Sabbaths the Israelites went and sat between those two gates; and they knew that anyone who entered through the gate of the bridegrooms<sup><xref rid="fn1047">6</xref></sup> was a bridegroom, and they said to him, May He who dwells in this house cause thee to rejoice with sons and daughters. If one entered through the gate of the mourners with his upper lip covered, then they knew that he was a mourner, and they would say to him. May He who dwells &#x007C;&#x007C; in this house comfort thee. If one entered through the gate of the mourners without<sup><xref rid="fn1048">7</xref></sup> having his upper lip covered, then they knew that he was excommunicated, and they would say to him, May He who dwells in this house<sup><xref rid="fn1049">8</xref></sup> put into thy heart (the desire) to listen to<sup><xref rid="fn1050">9</xref></sup> the words of thy associates, and may He put into the hearts of thy associates that they may draw thee near (to themselves), so that all Israel may discharge their duty by rendering the service of loving-kindness.</p>
<p>When the Temple was destroyed, the sages<sup><xref rid="fn1051">1</xref></sup> instituted (the rule) that the bridegrooms and mourners should go to the synagogues and to the houses of study. The men of the place see the bridegroom and rejoice with him; and they see the mourner and sit with him upon the earth, so that<sup><xref rid="fn1052">2</xref></sup> all the Israelites may discharge their duty in the service of loving-kindness. With reference to them he<sup><xref rid="fn1053">3</xref></sup> says: Blessed art Thou,<sup><xref rid="fn1054">4</xref></sup> who giveth a good reward to those who show loving-kindness.<sup><xref rid="fn1055">5</xref></sup></p>

<p>T<small>EN</small> things were created (on the eve of the Sabbath) in the twilight (namely):<sup><xref rid="fn1067">2</xref></sup> the mouth of the earth;<sup><xref rid="fn1068">3</xref></sup> the mouth of the well;<sup><xref rid="fn1069">4</xref></sup> the mouth of the ass;<sup><xref rid="fn1070">5</xref></sup> the rainbow;<sup><xref rid="fn1071">6</xref></sup> the Manna;<sup><xref rid="fn1072">7</xref></sup> the Shamir;<sup><xref rid="fn1073">8</xref></sup> the shape of the alphabet;<sup><xref rid="fn1074">9</xref></sup> the writing<sup><xref rid="fn1075">10</xref></sup> and the tables (of the law);<sup><xref rid="fn1076">11</xref></sup> and the ram of Abraham.<sup><xref rid="fn1077">1</xref></sup> (Some sages say: the destroying spirits<sup><xref rid="fn1078">2</xref></sup> also, and the sepulchre of Moses,<sup><xref rid="fn1079">3</xref></sup> and the ram of Isaac; and other sages say: the tongs also.<sup><xref rid="fn1080">4</xref></sup>)</p>
<p>At the seventh hour (of the day<sup><xref rid="fn1081">5</xref></sup> on Friday<sup><xref rid="fn1082">6</xref></sup>), the first man entered the garden of Eden, and the ministering &#x007C;&#x007C; angels were praising before him,<sup><xref rid="fn1083">7</xref></sup> and dancing before him, and escorting him<sup><xref rid="fn1084">8</xref></sup> into the garden of Eden; and at twilight at the eve of Sabbath,<sup><xref rid="fn1085">9</xref></sup> he was driven forth, and he went out. The ministering angels were crying aloud concerning him, saying to him: &#x201C;Man<sup><xref rid="fn1086">10</xref></sup> in glory tarrieth not overnight,<sup><xref rid="fn1087">11</xref></sup> when he is like the beasts that pass away&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1088">12</xref></sup> (Ps.xlix. 12).</p>
<p>&#x201C;Like a beast that passes away&#x201D; is not written here, but &#x201C;like the beasts that pass away,&#x201D; (so) were they both.<sup><xref rid="fn1089">13</xref></sup> The Sabbath day arrived and became an advocate<sup><xref rid="fn1090">14</xref></sup> for the first man, and it spake before Him: Sovereign of all worlds&#x0021; No murderer<sup><xref rid="fn1091">1</xref></sup> has been slain in the world during the six days of creation, and wilt Thou commence (to do this) with me?<sup><xref rid="fn1092">2</xref></sup> Is this its sanctity, and is this its blessing? as it is said, &#x201C;And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it&#x201D; (Gen. ii. 8). By the merit of the Sabbath day Adam was saved from the judgment of Gehinnom.<sup><xref rid="fn1093">3</xref></sup> When Adam perceived the power of the Sabbath, he said: Not for nought did the Holy One, blessed be He, bless and hallow<sup><xref rid="fn1094">4</xref></sup> the Sabbath day. He began to observe (the Sabbath)<sup><xref rid="fn1095">5</xref></sup> and to utter a psalm for the Sabbath day, and he said: &#x201C;A psalm, a song for the Sabbath day&#x201D; (Ps. xcii. 1).<sup><xref rid="fn1096">6</xref></sup> Rabbi Simeon<sup><xref rid="fn1097">7</xref></sup> said: The first man said this psalm, and it was forgotten throughout all the generations until Moses<sup><xref rid="fn1098">8</xref></sup> came and renewed it &#x007C;&#x007C; according to his name,<sup><xref rid="fn1099">9</xref></sup> &#x201C;A psalm, a song for the Sabbath day&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>), for the day which is entirely Sabbath and rest in the life of eternity.<sup><xref rid="fn1100">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;It is good to confess<sup><xref rid="fn1101">11</xref></sup> to the Lord&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). The first man said: Let all the generations learn from me,<sup><xref rid="fn1102">12</xref></sup> that whosoever sings and utters psalms to the name of the Most High, and confesses his transgressions in the court of justice<sup><xref rid="fn1103">13</xref></sup> and abandons (them), will be delivered from the judgment of Gehinnom,<sup><xref rid="fn1104">1</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;It is good to confess to the Lord&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>&#x201C;To declare thy loving-kindness in the <italic>morning</italic>&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 2). Adam said: (This refers to) all who enter this world<sup><xref rid="fn1105">2</xref></sup> which is like unto the night;<sup><xref rid="fn1106">3</xref></sup> and to all who come into the world to come, which is like unto the morning.<sup><xref rid="fn1107">4</xref></sup> They shall declare the faithfulness and love of the Holy One, blessed be He, which He has shown to me,<sup><xref rid="fn1108">5</xref></sup> (for He has) delivered me from the judgment of Gehinnom, as it is said, &#x201C;To declare thy loving-kindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>&#x201C;Upon a ten-stringed instrument and upon the psaltery&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 8). All testimonies reliable to Israel are (celebrated) with ten (males). The harp upon which David played had ten strings.<sup><xref rid="fn1109">6</xref></sup> The testimony for the dead is through ten (males).<sup><xref rid="fn1110">7</xref></sup> The testimony for the (public) benediction of (God&#x2019;s) Name is through ten (males).<sup><xref rid="fn1111">8</xref></sup> The testimony of the covenant of circumcision is through ten (males).<sup><xref rid="fn1112">9</xref></sup> The testimony for Chalizah<sup><xref rid="fn1113">10</xref></sup> is through ten (males),<sup><xref rid="fn1114">11</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And he<sup><xref rid="fn1115">1</xref></sup> took ten men of the elders of the city&#x201D; (Ruth iv. 2).<sup><xref rid="fn1116">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Holy One, blessed be He, said: I desire of Israel the meditation of their mouths like<sup><xref rid="fn1117">3</xref></sup> the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings,<sup><xref rid="fn1118">4</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;With<sup><xref rid="fn1119">5</xref></sup> the meditation of &#x007C;&#x007C; the harp&#x201D; (Ps. xcii. 3).</p>
<p>&#x201C;For thou, O Lord, hast made me glad through thy work&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 4). Adam said: The Holy One, blessed be He, had made me glad and brought me into the garden of Eden, and showed me the place of the abode of the righteous in the garden of Eden,<sup><xref rid="fn1120">6</xref></sup> and He showed me the four kingdoms,<sup><xref rid="fn1121">7</xref></sup> their rule and their destruction;<sup><xref rid="fn1122">8</xref></sup> and He showed me David,<sup><xref rid="fn1123">9</xref></sup> the son of Jesse, and his dominion in the future that is to come.<sup><xref rid="fn1124">10</xref></sup> I took from my years seventy years<sup><xref rid="fn1125">11</xref></sup> and added them to his days,<sup><xref rid="fn1126">12</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Thou wilt add days to the days of the king;<sup><xref rid="fn1127">1</xref></sup> his years shall be as many generations&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> lxi. 6). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Thou wilt add days to the days of (the king Messiah); I also will add to his years in the future which is to come, as though they were many generations, as it is said, &#x201C;His years shall be as many generations&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1128">2</xref></sup> I have given to God praise, and song (lauding) His works, as it is said, &#x201C;I will sing of the works of thy hands&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xcii. 4).</p>
<p>&#x201C;How great are thy works, O Lord&#x0021;&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 5). Adam began to glorify and to praise the Name of the Most High, as it is said, &#x201C;How great are thy works, O Lord&#x0021;&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>) but Thy thoughts are very deep,<sup><xref rid="fn1129">3</xref></sup> like the great deep<sup><xref rid="fn1130">4</xref></sup> exceedingly (deep), as it is said, &#x201C;Thy thoughts are very deep&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). &#x201C;A brutish man knoweth not&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 6). Every man of Israel<sup><xref rid="fn1131">5</xref></sup> who is brutish (in knowledge) and has not learnt understanding, let the wise men of Israel teach him the ways of the Torah,<sup><xref rid="fn1132">6</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Consider, ye brutish among the people&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xciv. 8).<sup><xref rid="fn1133">7</xref></sup> But a man who is an expert among the nations of the world<sup><xref rid="fn1134">8</xref></sup> is still foolish. Why? For he knoweth not the words of the Torah, as it is said, &#x201C;Neither doth a fool &#x007C;&#x007C; understand <italic>this</italic>&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1135">9</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic> xcii. 6).</p>
<p>&#x201C;When the wicked spring up as the grass&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 7). True<sup><xref rid="fn1136">10</xref></sup> (it is) that Thou, O Lord, beholdest the wicked, that they are as numerous<sup><xref rid="fn1137">11</xref></sup> as the grass to cover the face of all the earth,<sup><xref rid="fn1138">12</xref></sup> and all the worshippers of idols flourish,<sup><xref rid="fn1139">13</xref></sup> (Thou knowest) that they and their works are an evil iniquity<sup><xref rid="fn1140">1</xref></sup> for the days of the Messiah.<sup><xref rid="fn1141">2</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, has only multiplied them in order to destroy them from this world<sup><xref rid="fn1142">3</xref></sup> and from the world to come, as it is said, &#x201C;To have them destroyed for ever and ever. And thou, O Lord, art on high for evermore&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 7, 8). David saw that the wicked increased like grass, (so as) to cover the face of all the earth, and that all the worshippers of idols flourished, and that they and their works were iniquity, and he did not say &#x201C;Hallelujah&#x201D; (&#x201C;praise ye the Lord&#x201D;) until he perceived that in the future they would be destroyed from<sup><xref rid="fn1143">4</xref></sup> this world and from the world to come; and he said &#x201C;Hallelujah,&#x201D; as it is said, &#x201C;Sinners shall be consumed out of the earth,<sup><xref rid="fn1144">5</xref></sup> and the wicked shall be no more. Bless the Lord, O my soul. <italic>Praise ye the Lord</italic>&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> civ. 35).<sup><xref rid="fn1145">6</xref></sup> (Then will He be) King exalted<sup><xref rid="fn1146">7</xref></sup> in the heights and in the depths, as it is said, &#x201C;And thou, O Lord, art on high for evermore&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xcii. 8).</p>
<p>&#x201C;For, lo, thine enemies, O Lord&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 9); Israel said: Sovereign of all worlds&#x0021; Thou hast placed all our enemies over us<sup><xref rid="fn1147">8</xref></sup> (to afflict us with) a heavy yoke on our backs, but we know that they are doomed to destruction, as it is said, &#x201C;O Lord, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1148">9</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic>). And all &#x007C;&#x007C; idolaters, for they and their works are iniquity, shall be scattered like chaff<sup><xref rid="fn1149">10</xref></sup> before the wind.<sup><xref rid="fn1150">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;But my horn hast thou exalted like that of the re&#x00EA;m&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1151">1</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic> 10). Just as the horns of the re&#x00EA;m<sup><xref rid="fn1152">2</xref></sup> are taller than those of all beasts and animals,<sup><xref rid="fn1153">3</xref></sup> and it gores to its right and to its left, likewise (is it with) Menachem, son of &#x2018;Ammiel, son of Joseph,<sup><xref rid="fn1154">4</xref></sup> his horns are taller than those of all kings,<sup><xref rid="fn1155">5</xref></sup> and he will gore in the future towards the four corners of the heavens, and concerning him Moses said this verse, &#x201C;His firstling bullock, majesty is his, and his horns are the horns of the re&#x00EA;m: with them he shall gore<sup><xref rid="fn1156">6</xref></sup> the peoples all of them, even the ends of the earth&#x201D; (Deut. xxxiii. 17). All<sup><xref rid="fn1157">7</xref></sup> the kings will rise up against him to slay him, as it is said, &#x201C;The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers (take counsel together)&#x201D; (Ps. ii. 2). And Israel who (will be) in the Land (of Palestine) (will experience) great trouble,<sup><xref rid="fn1158">8</xref></sup> but in their troubles they (will be) like a green olive,<sup><xref rid="fn1159">9</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;I am anointed with fresh oil&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xcii. 10).<sup><xref rid="fn1160">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;Mine eyes have looked on mine enemies&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 11). The Israelites in the Land (of Israel<sup><xref rid="fn1161">1</xref></sup>) behold the downfall of their enemies, as it is said, &#x201C;Mine eyes have looked on mine enemies&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). And<sup><xref rid="fn1162">2</xref></sup> such who in the future will come against them (Israel), their ears shall hear of their destruction, as it is said, &#x201C;Mine ears have heard concerning the evil-doers that rise up against me&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>&#x201C;The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 12). Just as this palm tree is beautiful in all its appearance,<sup><xref rid="fn1163">3</xref></sup> and all its fruits are sweet and good,<sup><xref rid="fn1164">4</xref></sup> likewise the son of David<sup><xref rid="fn1165">5</xref></sup> is beautiful in his appearance<sup><xref rid="fn1166">6</xref></sup> and in his glory, and all his deeds &#x007C;&#x007C; are good and sweet before the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is said, &#x201C;The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). Just as this cedar has very many roots beneath the earth, and even if the four winds<sup><xref rid="fn1167">7</xref></sup> of the world came<sup><xref rid="fn1168">8</xref></sup> against it, they could not move it from its place,<sup><xref rid="fn1169">9</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. They that are planted in the house of the Lord&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 12, 13). In the future when the Holy One, blessed be He, will gather Israel from the four corners of the world,<sup><xref rid="fn1170">10</xref></sup> just like this gardener who transplants<sup><xref rid="fn1171">11</xref></sup> his fir trees from one garden-bed to another garden-bed, likewise in the future will the Holy One, blessed be He, gather them<sup><xref rid="fn1172">1</xref></sup> from an impure land and (plant them) in a pure land,<sup><xref rid="fn1173">2</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;They that are planted in the house of the Lord&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). Like this grass, they shall blossom and sprout forth in the Temple, as it is said, &#x201C;In the courts of our God they shall flourish&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>&#x201C;They shall still bring forth fruit in old age&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 14). Just as this<sup><xref rid="fn1174">3</xref></sup> old age is glory and honour to old men,<sup><xref rid="fn1175">4</xref></sup> so shall they be in glory and honour<sup><xref rid="fn1176">5</xref></sup> before the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is said, &#x201C;They shall be full of sap and green&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1177">6</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic>). These are the mighty heroes by reason of their good deeds, as it is said, &#x201C;They shall be full of sap and green, to declare that the Lord is upright&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 14, 15). Why all these (statements)?<sup><xref rid="fn1178">7</xref></sup> To declare, and to proclaim clearly the works of the Holy One, blessed be He, for He is righteous and upright, and that there is no unrighteousness (in Him), as it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn1179">8</xref></sup> &#x201C;And there is no unrighteousness in him&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 15).<sup><xref rid="fn1180">9</xref></sup></p>

<h1><small>THE SABBATH</small> [22<small>B</small>. ii.]</h1>
<p>T<small>HE</small> School of Shammai said: The heavens<sup><xref rid="fn1184">2</xref></sup> were created first, and the earth afterwards, as it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn1185">3</xref></sup> &#x201C;In the beginning God created <italic>the heavens</italic> and the earth&#x201D; (Gen. i. 1). The School of Hillel said: The earth was created first, and the heavens afterwards, as it is said, &#x201C;Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the <italic>earth</italic>; and the heavens are the work of thy hands&#x201D; (Ps. cii. 25).<sup><xref rid="fn1186">4</xref></sup> The School of Shammai said: The heavens were created first, and the earth afterwards, as it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn1187">5</xref></sup> &#x201C;These are the generations of the <italic>heavens</italic> and of the earth&#x201D; (Gen. ii. 4). The School of Hillel said: The earth was created first, and the heavens afterwards, as it is said, &#x201C;In the day that the Lord God made <italic>earth</italic> and heaven&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). The School of Shammai said: The heavens were created first, because it is said, &#x201C;And the <italic>heavens</italic> and the earth were finished&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 1). The School of Hillel said: The earth was created first, and the heavens afterwards, as it is said, &#x201C;Yea, mine hand hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spread out the heavens&#x201D; (Isa. xlviii. 18). The School of Shammai said: The heavens were created first, and the earth afterwards, because it is said, &#x201C;Thus saith the Lord, The <italic>heaven</italic> is my throne, and the earth is my footstool&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> lxvi. 1). Contention arose between them (<italic>i.e.</italic> the Schools<sup><xref rid="fn1188">1</xref></sup>) on this question, until the Holy Spirit<sup><xref rid="fn1189">2</xref></sup> rested between them, and they both agreed that both (heavens and earth) were created in one hour and at one moment.<sup><xref rid="fn1190">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He put forth His right hand and stretched forth the heavens, and He put forth His left hand and founded the earth, as it is said, &#x201C;Yea, mine <italic>hand</italic> &#x007C;&#x007C; hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my <italic>right hand</italic> hath spread out the heavens:<sup><xref rid="fn1191">4</xref></sup> when I called unto them, they stood up <italic>together</italic>&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xlviii. 13). Both of them were created simultaneously, as it is said, &#x201C;And the <italic>heavens</italic> and the <italic>earth</italic> were finished, and all their host&#x201D; (Gen. ii. 1).<sup><xref rid="fn1192">5</xref></sup> And, indeed, were the heavens and the earth completed (so as not to require God&#x2019;s providence) for their continued existence and maintenance? Has it not been written concerning them, &#x201C;Thus saith the Lord, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool&#x201D; (Isa. lxvi. 1)?<sup><xref rid="fn1193">6</xref></sup> But they were finished with reference to the original deed (of creation) and with reference to the work (of being created) and being called into existence. Therefore it is said, &#x201C;And the heavens and the earth <italic>were finished</italic>&#x201D; (Gen. ii. 1).</p>
<p>Israel spake before the Holy One, blessed be He: Sovereign of the worlds&#x0021; Thou didst complete the heavens and the earth with reference to being made, created, and called into existence;<sup><xref rid="fn1194">7</xref></sup> let not Thy mercy and loving-kindness be withheld,<sup><xref rid="fn1195">1</xref></sup> for if Thou withholdest Thy mercy and loving-kindness we are unable to exist,<sup><xref rid="fn1196">2</xref></sup> because the world rests upon Thy mercy and loving-kindness,<sup><xref rid="fn1197">3</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;For the mountains shall depart,<sup><xref rid="fn1198">4</xref></sup> and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee&#x2026; saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee&#x201D; (Isa. liv. 10);<sup><xref rid="fn1199">5</xref></sup> and it says (elsewhere), &#x201C;Remember, O Lord, thy tender mercies and thy loving-kindnesses; for they have been ever of old&#x201D; (Ps. xxv. 6).<sup><xref rid="fn1200">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;And on the seventh day God finished<sup><xref rid="fn1201">7</xref></sup> his work&#x201D; (Gen. ii. 2). The Holy One, blessed be He, created seven dedications,<sup><xref rid="fn1202">8</xref></sup> six of them He dedicated, and one is reserved for the (future) generations. He created the first day and finished all His work and dedicated it,<sup><xref rid="fn1203">9</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And it was evening, and it was morning, one day&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> i. 5). He created the second day and finished all His work and dedicated it, as it is said, &#x007C;&#x007C; &#x201C;And it was evening, and it was morning, a second day&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 8); and so through the six days of creation. He created the seventh day, (but) not for work, because it is not said in connection therewith, &#x201C;And it was evening and it was morning.&#x201D; Why? For it is reserved for the generations (to come), as it is said, &#x201C;And there shall be one day which is known unto the Lord; not <italic>day</italic>, and not <italic>night</italic>&#x201D; (Zech. xiv. 7).<sup><xref rid="fn1204">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>A parable: To what is this matter to be compared? To a man who had precious utensils.<sup><xref rid="fn1205">2</xref></sup> And he did not desire to give them as an inheritance except to his son;<sup><xref rid="fn1206">3</xref></sup> likewise with the Holy One, blessed be He. The day of blessing and holiness<sup><xref rid="fn1207">4</xref></sup> which was before Him, He did not desire to give it as an inheritance except to Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn1208">5</xref></sup> Know that it is so &#x0021; Come and see &#x0021; for when the Israelites went forth from Egypt,<sup><xref rid="fn1209">6</xref></sup> whilst yet the Torah had not been given to them, He gave them the Sabbath as an inheritance. Israel kept two Sabbaths<sup><xref rid="fn1210">7</xref></sup> whilst as yet the Torah had not been given to them, as it is said, &#x201C;And thou madest known unto them thy holy Sabbath&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1211">8</xref></sup> (Neh. ix. 14). And afterwards He gave them the Torah, as it is said, &#x201C;And commandedst them commandments, and statutes, and <italic>Torah</italic> by the hand of Moses, thy servant&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1212">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Holy One, blessed be He, observed and sanctified the Sabbath,<sup><xref rid="fn1213">1</xref></sup> and Israel is obliged<sup><xref rid="fn1214">2</xref></sup> only to observe and sanctify the Sabbath. Know that it is so&#x0021; Come and see&#x0021; for when He gave them the Manna, He gave it to them in the wilderness during forty years on the six days of creation,<sup><xref rid="fn1215">3</xref></sup> but on the Sabbath He did not give (it) &#x007C;&#x007C; to them. Wilt thou say that He did not have power enough to give it to them every day?<sup><xref rid="fn1216">4</xref></sup> But (the fact was) the Sabbath was before Him; therefore He gave to them bread for two days on the Friday, as it is said, &#x201C;See, for that the Lord hath given you the Sabbath,<sup><xref rid="fn1217">5</xref></sup> therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days&#x201D; (Ex. xvi. 29). When the people<sup><xref rid="fn1218">6</xref></sup> saw that Sabbath (was observed) before Him, they also rested, as it is said, &#x201C;So the people rested on the seventh day&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 30).</p>
<p>&#x201C;And God blessed the seventh day,<sup><xref rid="fn1219">7</xref></sup> and hallowed it&#x201D; (Gen. ii. 3). The Holy One, blessed be He, blessed and hallowed the Sabbath day, and Israel is bound only to <italic>keep</italic> and to hallow the Sabbath day.<sup><xref rid="fn1220">8</xref></sup> Hence they<sup><xref rid="fn1221">9</xref></sup> said: Whosoever says the benediction and sanctification over the wine on the eves of Sabbath,<sup><xref rid="fn1222">10</xref></sup> his days<sup><xref rid="fn1223">11</xref></sup> will be increased in this world, and<sup><xref rid="fn1224">12</xref></sup> in the world to come, as it is said, &#x201C;For by me thy days shall be multiplied&#x201D; (Prov. ix. 11) in this world; &#x201C;and the years of thy life shall be increased&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>) in the world to come.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Ye shall keep the Sabbath,<sup><xref rid="fn1225">13</xref></sup> for it is holy unto you&#x201D; (Ex. xxxi. 14). What is the keeping of the Sabbath? Neither to do any work thereon,<sup><xref rid="fn1226">1</xref></sup> nor to kindle fire thereon, neither to take forth nor to bring in beyond the Techum (limit)<sup><xref rid="fn1227">2</xref></sup> of the Sabbath even one foot,<sup><xref rid="fn1228">3</xref></sup> nor to fetch in his hand something<sup><xref rid="fn1229">4</xref></sup> which is not his food nor the food for his cattle.<sup><xref rid="fn1230">5</xref></sup> This is the keeping of the Sabbath,<sup><xref rid="fn1231">6</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 16).</p>
<p>&#x201C;It<sup><xref rid="fn1232">7</xref></sup> is a sign between me and the children of Israel<sup><xref rid="fn1233">8</xref></sup> for ever&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 17). The Holy One, blessed be He, said: This (Sabbath) have I given to Israel<sup><xref rid="fn1234">9</xref></sup> as a sign between Me &#x007C;&#x007C; and them; for in the six days of creation I fashioned all the world, and on the Sabbath I rested, therefore have I given to Israel the six days of work, and on the Sabbath, a day<sup><xref rid="fn1235">10</xref></sup> (for) blessing and sanctification,<sup><xref rid="fn1236">11</xref></sup> for Me and for them; therefore it is said, &#x201C;Between me and the children of Israel it is a sign for ever&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1237">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Holy One, blessed be He, created seven<sup><xref rid="fn1238">1</xref></sup> firmaments, and He selected from them all &#x2018;Araboth<sup><xref rid="fn1239">2</xref></sup> only for the place of the throne of glory of His kingdom, as it is said, &#x201C;Cast up a highway for him that rideth on the &#x2018;Araboth,<sup><xref rid="fn1240">3</xref></sup> with Jah, his name&#x201D; (Ps. lxviii. 4). The Holy One, blessed be He, created seven lands,<sup><xref rid="fn1241">4</xref></sup> and He chose from all of them the land of Israel only, as it is said, &#x201C;A land&#x2026; the eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year&#x201D; (Deut. xi. 12).<sup><xref rid="fn1242">5</xref></sup> Another verse says, &#x201C;I said, I shall not see the Lord, even the Lord in the land of the living&#x201D; (Isa. xxxviii. 11).<sup><xref rid="fn1243">6</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, created seven deserts, and of them all He chose the <italic>desert</italic> of Sinai<sup><xref rid="fn1244">7</xref></sup> only to give therein the Torah, as it is said, &#x201C;The <italic>mountain</italic> which God hath desired for his abode&#x201D; (Ps. lxviii. 16).</p>
<p>The Holy One, blessed be He, created seven seas,<sup><xref rid="fn1245">8</xref></sup> and of them all He chose the Sea of Kinnereth<sup><xref rid="fn1246">1</xref></sup> only, and gave it as an inheritance to the tribe of Naphtali,<sup><xref rid="fn1247">2</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;O Naphtali, <italic>satisfied with favour</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1248">3</xref></sup> and full with the blessing of the Lord:<sup><xref rid="fn1249">4</xref></sup> possess thou the <italic>sea</italic> and the south&#x201D; (Deut. xxxiii. 23). What is the &#x201C;blessing of the Lord&#x201D;? (It means) that He blessed him and gave him as an inheritance the sea and the south, as it is said, &#x201C;Possess thou the sea and the south&#x201D; (<italic>ibid</italic>.).<sup><xref rid="fn1250">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Holy One, blessed be He, created seven &#x00E6;ons, &#x2225; and of them all He chose the seventh &#x00E6;on<sup><xref rid="fn1251">6</xref></sup> only; the six &#x00E6;ons are for the going in and coming out (of God&#x2019;s creatures) for war and peace. The seventh &#x00E6;on is entirely Sabbath and rest in the life everlasting.<sup><xref rid="fn1252">7</xref></sup> Seven lamps were made for the sanctuary, and the lamp of Sabbath was illuminating opposite the other six (lamps), as it is said, &#x201C;In front of the lamp-stand the seven lamps shall give light&#x201D; (Num. viii. 2).<sup><xref rid="fn1253">8</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, created seven days, and of them all He chose the seventh day only, as it is said, &#x201C;And God <italic>blessed</italic> the seventh day, and hallowed it&#x201D; (Gen. ii. 3).<sup><xref rid="fn1254">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Everyone<sup><xref rid="fn1255">10</xref></sup> who keeps the Sabbath, happy is he in this world and happy will he be in the world to come,<sup><xref rid="fn1256">11</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Happy is the <italic>man</italic> that doeth this, and the <italic>son of man</italic> that holdeth fast by it: who keepeth the Sabbath from profaning it&#x201D; (Isa. lvi. 2).

<ftnote id="fn1183"><sup>1</sup> This is ch. xviii. in the printed editions.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1184"><sup>2</sup> The history of the creation of man is associated by the Rabbis with the fundamental law of Jewish ethics, the rule of loving-kindness. To quote their dictum, &#x201C;The Torah begins and ends with the service of loving-kindness&#x201D; (T.B. So&#x1E6D;ah, 14a). The preceding chapters xvi. and xvii. dealt with the service of loving-kindness, and the story of the Creation is now resumed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1185"><sup>3</sup> The controversy was evoked by the precedence given to heaven or earth in the texts of Scripture quoted by the different teachers; see <italic>Rabbinic Philosophy and Ethics,</italic> pp. 6 f.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1186"><sup>4</sup> See T.B. Chagigah, 12a; T.J. Chagigah ii. 1, 77c, d; Gen. Rab. i. 15; Lev. Rab. xxxvi. 1; Midrash on Samuel v. (where the School of Shammai is represented as expressing the opinions which are elsewhere attributed to the School of Hillel); and cf. Sepher Ha-Bahir, &#x00A7; 17, and Bacher, T. i. 14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1187"><sup>5</sup> The first editions quote here Isa. xlviii. 13: &#x201C;Yea, mine hand hath laid the foundation of the earth.&#x201D; The earth is mentioned <italic>first</italic> in this verse, and therefore the opinion of the School of Hillel is thereby substantiated. The &#x201C;School of Hillel&#x201D; is the correct reading, as in our MS. The following passage until &#x201C;Yea, mine hand&#x201D; is omitted in the printed texts.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1190"><sup>3</sup> The &#x1E92;ohar, Gen. 17b, has this idea; cf. <italic>ibid.</italic> 29b. The basis for this third view is afforded by the text Isa. xlviii. 13: &#x201C;When I called unto them, they stood up together.&#x201D; The Targum renders this text thus: &#x201C;Yea, with my word I completed the earth, and with my power I expanded the heavens; I called to them, they stood together.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1196"><sup>2</sup> Man sins, and therefore needs God&#x2019;s grace and mercy. This idea is well expressed by the teaching of 4 Ezra vii. 135&#x2013;137. The Bible text, &#x201C;Remember, O Lord, thy tender mercies and thy loving-kindnesses, for they have been <italic>ever of old</italic>&#x201D; (Ps. xxv. 6), is a parallel to our passage; cf. Targum of this verse, which renders the last words, &#x201C;for they have been from eternity.&#x201D; Cf. Gen. Rab. xxii. 1, Jal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D;, Ps. &#x00A7; 702, and Shocher &#x1E6C;ob to Ps. xxv. 8, p. 107a, where the question is discussed. How would mankind have arisen if God had dealt with Adam with strict justice? The grace of God was granted to Adam so as to enable mankind to arise and flourish on earth before the doom of death over-took him. There may be an attempt here to counteract the un-Jewish doctrines of the Pauline school, which taught that, owing to Adam&#x2019;s sin, God&#x2019;s grace was withdrawn, and only through the advent of a Second Adam (or Christ) could this Divine grace be restored to the world. The theologians who suggest that Judaism has something to learn from the Pauline doctrine of grace must be unaware of the Jewish teaching on this theme.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER XX</title>
<h1><small>ADAM&#x2019;S PENITENCE</small> [24<small>A</small>. i.]</h1>
<p>&#x201C;So he <italic>drove out</italic> the man&#x201D; (Gen. iii. 24). <italic>Driving out</italic> (<italic>i.e</italic>.) and he went forth outside the garden of Eden (and he abode)<sup><xref rid="fn1262">1</xref></sup> on Mount Moriah, for the gate of the garden of Eden is nigh unto Mount Moriah.<sup><xref rid="fn1263">2</xref></sup> Thence He took him and thither He made him return to the place whence he was taken, as it is said, &#x201C;To till the ground from whence he was taken&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 23).<sup><xref rid="fn1264">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah said: The Holy One, blessed be He, kept the Sabbath<sup><xref rid="fn1265">4</xref></sup> first in the heavenly regions, and Adam kept the &#x007C;&#x007C; Sabbath first in the lower regions. The Sabbath day protected him from all evil, and comforted<sup><xref rid="fn1266">5</xref></sup> him on account of all the doubts of his heart, as it is said, &#x201C;In the multitude of my doubts within me, thy comforts delight my soul&#x201D; (Ps. xciv. 19).</p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua ben &#x1E32;orchah said: From the tree under which they hid themselves,<sup><xref rid="fn1267">1</xref></sup> they took leaves and sewed (them), as it is said, &#x201C;And they sewed fig leaves together,<sup><xref rid="fn1268">2</xref></sup> and made themselves aprons&#x201D; (Gen. iii. 7). Rabbi Eliezer said: From the skin<sup><xref rid="fn1269">3</xref></sup> which the serpent sloughed off, the Holy One, blessed be He, took<sup><xref rid="fn1270">4</xref></sup> and made coats of glory<sup><xref rid="fn1271">5</xref></sup> for Adam and his wife, as it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skin, and clothed them&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 21).</p>
<p>At twilight on Saturday<sup><xref rid="fn1272">6</xref></sup> (evening), Adam was<sup><xref rid="fn1273">7</xref></sup> meditating in his heart and saying:<sup><xref rid="fn1274">8</xref></sup> Perhaps the serpent, which deceived me, will come in the evening,<sup><xref rid="fn1275">9</xref></sup> and he will bruise me in the heel. A pillar of fire was sent to him to give illumination about him and to guard him from all evil.<sup><xref rid="fn1276">10</xref></sup> Adam saw the pillar of fire and rejoiced in his heart,<sup><xref rid="fn1277">11</xref></sup> and he put forth his hands<sup><xref rid="fn1278">12</xref></sup> to the light of the fire, and said: Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who creates the flames of fire.<sup><xref rid="fn1279">13</xref></sup> And when he removed his hands<sup><xref rid="fn1280">1</xref></sup> from the light of the fire,<sup><xref rid="fn1281">2</xref></sup> he said: Now I know that the holy day has been separated from the work day here below (on earth), for fire may not be kindled on the Sabbath day; and in that hour he said: Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who divides &#x007C;&#x007C; the holy from the profane,<sup><xref rid="fn1282">3</xref></sup> the light from the darkness.</p>
<p>Rabbi Mana said: How must<sup><xref rid="fn1283">4</xref></sup> a man say the Habdalah blessing? (He does this) over the cup of wine, with the light of fire,<sup><xref rid="fn1284">5</xref></sup> and he says: Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who creates the various flames of fire; and when he removes his hand from the fire (flame) he says: Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who divides the holy from the profane.</p>
<p>If he have no wine he puts forth his hands<sup><xref rid="fn1285">6</xref></sup> towards the light of the lamp and looks at his nails,<sup><xref rid="fn1286">7</xref></sup> which are whiter than his body, and he says: Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who creates various flames of fire; and when he has removed his hands<sup><xref rid="fn1287">8</xref></sup> from the fire, he says: Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who divides the holy from the profane.</p>
<p>If he be on a journey,<sup><xref rid="fn1288">1</xref></sup> he puts forth his hand<sup><xref rid="fn1289">2</xref></sup> to the light of the stars, which are also fire,<sup><xref rid="fn1290">3</xref></sup> and says: Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who creates the various flames of fire. If the heavens be darkened,<sup><xref rid="fn1291">4</xref></sup> he lifts up a stone outside,<sup><xref rid="fn1292">5</xref></sup> and says:<sup><xref rid="fn1293">6</xref></sup> Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, who creates the various flames of fire.<sup><xref rid="fn1294">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Zadok said: Whosoever does not make Habdalah<sup><xref rid="fn1295">8</xref></sup> at the termination of Sabbaths, or does not listen to those who perform the ceremony of Habdalah, will never see a sign<sup><xref rid="fn1296">9</xref></sup> of blessing.<sup><xref rid="fn1297">10</xref></sup> Everyone who makes Habdalah at the termination of Sabbaths, or whosoever hears those who perform the Habdalah, the Holy One, blessed be He, calls him holy to be His holy treasure, and delivers him from the affliction of the peoples, as it is said, &#x201C;And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the Lord am holy&#x201D; (Lev. xx. 26).<sup><xref rid="fn1298">1</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C;</p>
<p>On the first day of the week<sup><xref rid="fn1299">2</xref></sup> he<sup><xref rid="fn1300">3</xref></sup> went into the waters of the upper Gihon<sup><xref rid="fn1301">4</xref></sup> until the waters reached up to his neck, and he fasted seven weeks of days,<sup><xref rid="fn1302">5</xref></sup> until his body became like a species of seaweed.<sup><xref rid="fn1303">6</xref></sup> Adam said before the Holy One, blessed be He: Sovereign of all worlds &#x0021; Remove, I pray Thee, my sins from me and accept my repentance, and all the generations will learn that repentance is a reality.<sup><xref rid="fn1304">7</xref></sup> What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He put forth His right hand,<sup><xref rid="fn1305">8</xref></sup> and accepted his repentance,<sup><xref rid="fn1306">9</xref></sup> and took away from him his sin, as it is said, &#x201C;I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid:<sup><xref rid="fn1307">10</xref></sup> I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah&#x201D; (Ps. xxxii. 5). Selah<sup><xref rid="fn1308">11</xref></sup> in this world and Selah in the world to come. Adam returned<sup><xref rid="fn1309">12</xref></sup> and meditated in his heart, and said: I</p>
<p>know that death will remove me<sup><xref rid="fn1310">1</xref></sup> (to) &#x201C;the house appointed for all living&#x201D; (Job xxx. 28). Adam said: Whilst I am yet alive<sup><xref rid="fn1311">2</xref></sup> I will<sup><xref rid="fn1312">3</xref></sup> build for myself a mausoleum to rest therein.<sup><xref rid="fn1313">4</xref></sup> He planned<sup><xref rid="fn1314">5</xref></sup> and built for himself a mausoleum to rest therein beyond<sup><xref rid="fn1315">6</xref></sup> Mount Moriah. Adam said: If in the case of the tables (of stone), just because in the future they will be written by the finger (of God), the waters of the Jordan are destined to flee before them;<sup><xref rid="fn1316">7</xref></sup> how much more so will this be the case with my body which His two hands<sup><xref rid="fn1317">8</xref></sup> kneaded, and because He breathed into my nostrils the breath of the spirit of His mouth? After my death they will come and take my bones, and they will make them into an image for idolatry;<sup><xref rid="fn1318">9</xref></sup> but verily I will put &#x007C;&#x007C; my coffin deep down beneath the cave and within the cave.<sup><xref rid="fn1319">10</xref></sup> Therefore it is called the Cave of Machpelah, which is a double cave.<sup><xref rid="fn1320">11</xref></sup> There Adam was put and his help-meet,<sup><xref rid="fn1321">12</xref></sup> Abraham and his help-meet, Isaac and his help-meet, Jacob and his help-meet. Therefore it is called &#x201C;the city of four&#x201D; (Kirjath Arba&#x2018;); for four pairs (were buried there),<sup><xref rid="fn1322">1</xref></sup> and concerning them the verse says, &#x201C;He entereth into peace; they rest in their beds,<sup><xref rid="fn1323">2</xref></sup> each one that walketh in his up-rightness&#x201D; (Isa. lvii. 2).<sup><xref rid="fn1324">3</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1262"><sup>1</sup> The MS. does not read: &#x201C;and he abode.&#x201D; This is the reading of the first editions. Jal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D;, Gen. &#x00A7; 34 (end), adds: &#x201C;outside the garden of Eden.&#x201D; The new abode of Adam was near the garden of Eden. The Midrash appears to understand, Gen. iii. 24, thus: &#x201C;So he drove out the man and he dwelt at the east of the garden of Eden.&#x201D; This Haggadic interpretation already appears in the LXX.</ftnote>

<p>&#x201C;B<small>UT</small><sup><xref rid="fn1327">1</xref></sup> of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden&#x201D; (Gen. iii. 3). It was taught in a Baraitha,<sup><xref rid="fn1328">2</xref></sup> Rabbi &#x1E92;e&#x2019;era said: &#x201C;Of the fruit of the tree&#x201D;&#x2014;here &#x201C;tree&#x201D; only means man, who is compared to the tree, as it is said, &#x201C;For man is the <italic>tree</italic> of the field&#x201D; (Deut. xx. 19). &#x201C;Which is in the midst of the garden&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;in the midst of the garden&#x201D; is here merely an euphemism.<sup><xref rid="fn1329">3</xref></sup> &#x201C;Which is in the midst of the garden&#x201D;&#x2014;for &#x201C;garden&#x201D; means here merely woman, who is compared to a garden, as it is said, &#x201C;A garden shut up is my sister, a bride&#x201D; (Cant. iv. 12). Just as with this garden whatever is sown therein, it produces and brings forth, so (with) this woman, what seed she receives, she conceives and bears<sup><xref rid="fn1330">4</xref></sup> through sexual intercourse.</p>
<p>(Sammael) riding on the serpent came to her, and she conceived;<sup><xref rid="fn1331">5</xref></sup> afterwards Adam came to her, and she conceived Abel,<sup><xref rid="fn1332">1</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And Adam knew Eve his wife&#x201D; (Gen. iv. 1). What is the meaning of &#x201C;knew&#x201D;? (He knew) that she had conceived.<sup><xref rid="fn1333">2</xref></sup> And she saw his<sup><xref rid="fn1334">3</xref></sup> likeness that it was not of the earthly beings, but of the heavenly beings, and she prophesied<sup><xref rid="fn1335">4</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C; and said: &#x201C;I have gotten a man with the Lord&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1336">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Miasha<sup><xref rid="fn1337">1</xref></sup> said: Cain was born, and his wife,<sup><xref rid="fn1338">2</xref></sup> his twin-sister,<sup><xref rid="fn1339">3</xref></sup> with him.<sup><xref rid="fn1340">4</xref></sup> Rabbi Simeon<sup><xref rid="fn1341">5</xref></sup> said to him: Has it not already been said, &#x201C;And if a man shall take his sister, his father&#x2019;s daughter, or his mother&#x2019;s daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a shameful thing&#x201D;?<sup><xref rid="fn1342">6</xref></sup> (Lev. xx. 17). From these words know that there were no other women whom they could marry, and these were permitted to them, as it is said, &#x201C;For I have said, The world shall be built up by love&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1343">7</xref></sup> (Ps. lxxxix. 2). With love was the world built up before the Torah had been given.<sup><xref rid="fn1344">8</xref></sup> Rabbi Joseph<sup><xref rid="fn1345">9</xref></sup> said: Cain and Abel were twins,<sup><xref rid="fn1346">10</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And she conceived, and bare (with) Cain&#x201D; (Gen. iv. 1). At that hour she had an additional capacity for child-bearing (as it is said), &#x201C;And she <italic>continued</italic> to bear his brother Abel&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 2).<sup><xref rid="fn1347">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now Cain was a man who loved the ground in order to sow seed; and Abel was a man who loved to tend the sheep; the one gave of his produce as food for the other, and the latter gave of his produce as food for his (brother). The evening of the festival of Passover<sup><xref rid="fn1348">1</xref></sup> arrived. Adam called his sons and said to them: In this (night) in the future Israel will bring Paschal offerings, bring ye also (offerings) before your Creator.</p>
<p>(Cain) brought the remnants of his meal of roasted grain, (and) the seed of flax,<sup><xref rid="fn1349">2</xref></sup> and Abel brought of the firstlings of his sheep, and of their fat, he-lambs, which had not been shorn of their wool.<sup><xref rid="fn1350">3</xref></sup> The offering of &#x007C;&#x007C; Cain was precluded,<sup><xref rid="fn1351">4</xref></sup> and the offering of Abel was acceptable, as it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 4).</p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua ben &#x1E32;orchah said: The Holy One, blessed be He, said: Heaven forbid &#x0021; Never let the offerings<sup><xref rid="fn1352">1</xref></sup> of Cain and Abel be mixed up (with one another), even in the weaving of a garment, as it is said, &#x201C;Thou shalt not wear a mingled stuff, <italic>wool</italic> and <italic>linen</italic> together&#x201D; (Deut. xxii. 11). And even if it be combined<sup><xref rid="fn1353">2</xref></sup> let it not come upon thee, as it is said, &#x201C;Neither shall there come upon thee a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together&#x201D; (Lev. xix. 19).</p>
<p>Rabbi Zadok said: A great hatred<sup><xref rid="fn1354">3</xref></sup> entered Cain&#x2019;s heart against his brother Abel, because his offering had been accepted.<sup><xref rid="fn1355">4</xref></sup> Not only (on this account), but also because Abel&#x2019;s twin-sister was the most beautiful of women, and he desired her in his heart. Moreover he said: I will slay Abel my brother, and I will take his twin-sister<sup><xref rid="fn1356">5</xref></sup> from him, as it is said, &#x201C;And it came to pass when they were in the <italic>field</italic>&#x201D; (Gen. iv. 8).</p>
<p>&#x201C;In the field&#x201D; means woman, who is compared to a field.<sup><xref rid="fn1357">6</xref></sup> He took the stone and embedded it in the forehead<sup><xref rid="fn1358">7</xref></sup> of Abel, and slew him, as it is said, &#x201C;And Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>Rabbi Jochanan said: Cain did not know that the secrets are revealed before the Holy One, blessed be He.<sup><xref rid="fn1359">1</xref></sup> He took the corpse of his brother Abel and hid it in the field.<sup><xref rid="fn1360">2</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: &#x201C;Where is Abel thy brother?&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 9). He replied to Him: Sovereign of the world &#x0021; A keeper of vineyard and field hast Thou made me.<sup><xref rid="fn1361">3</xref></sup> A keeper of my brother Thou hast not made me; as it is said, &#x201C;Am I my brother&#x2019;s keeper?&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: &#x007C;&#x007C; &#x201C;Hast thou killed, and also taken possession?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1362">4</xref></sup> (1 Kings xxi. 19). &#x201C;The voice of thy brother&#x2019;s blood crieth unto me from the ground&#x201D; (Gen. iv. 10). When Cain heard this word<sup><xref rid="fn1363">5</xref></sup> he was confused. And He cursed him, that he became<sup><xref rid="fn1364">6</xref></sup> a wanderer on the earth because of the shedding of the blood,<sup><xref rid="fn1365">7</xref></sup> and because of the evil death.</p>
<p>Cain spake before the Holy One, blessed be He: Sovereign of all the worlds &#x0021; &#x201C;My sin is too great to be borne&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 13), for it has no atonement.<sup><xref rid="fn1366">8</xref></sup> This utterance was reckoned to him as repentance,<sup><xref rid="fn1367">1</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And Cain said unto the Lord, My sin is too great to be borne&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>); further, Cain said before the Holy One, blessed be He: Now will a certain righteous one<sup><xref rid="fn1368">2</xref></sup> arise on the earth and mention Thy great Name against me and slay me.<sup><xref rid="fn1369">3</xref></sup> What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He took one letter from the twenty-two letters,<sup><xref rid="fn1370">4</xref></sup> and put (it) upon Cain&#x2019;s arm<sup><xref rid="fn1371">5</xref></sup> that he should not be killed, as it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord appointed a sign for Cain&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 15). The dog<sup><xref rid="fn1372">6</xref></sup> which was guarding Abel&#x2019;s flock also guarded<sup><xref rid="fn1373">7</xref></sup> his corpse<sup><xref rid="fn1374">8</xref></sup> from all the beasts of the field and all the fowl of the heavens.<sup><xref rid="fn1375">9</xref></sup> Adam and his helpmate were sitting and weeping and mourning<sup><xref rid="fn1376">10</xref></sup> for him, and they did not know what to do (with Abel), for they were unaccustomed to burial. A raven<sup><xref rid="fn1377">11</xref></sup> (came), one of its fellow birds was dead (at its side). (The raven) said: I will teach this man what to do. It took its fellow and dug in the earth, hid it and buried it before them. Adam said: Like this raven will I act. He took &#x007C;&#x007C; the corpse of Abel and dug in the earth and buried it. The Holy One, blessed be He, gave a good reward to the ravens in this world. What reward did He give them? When they bear their young and see that they are white<sup><xref rid="fn1378">12</xref></sup> they fly from them, thinking that they are the offspring of a serpent, and the Holy One, blessed be He, gives them their sustenance<sup><xref rid="fn1379">13</xref></sup> without lack, as it is said, &#x201C;Who provideth for the raven his food, when his young ones cry unto God, and wander for lack of meat&#x201D; (Job xxxviii. 41). Moreover, that rain should be given<sup><xref rid="fn1380">1</xref></sup> upon the earth (for their sakes), and the Holy One, blessed be He, answers them, as it is said, &#x201C;He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry&#x201D; (Ps. cxlvii. 9).<sup><xref rid="fn1381">2</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1327"><sup>1</sup> The first editions begin the chapter with the expression: &#x201C;It is written.&#x201D; Our MS. agrees with the Oxford MSS. here.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1328"><sup>2</sup> &#x201C;A tannaite tradition not incorporated in the Mishnah,&#x201D; see <italic>J.E.</italic> ii. 513.

<ftnote id="fn1329"><sup>3</sup> The first editions read here: &#x201C;Just as &#x2018; in the <italic>middle</italic> of the body&#x2019; (has its implication, likewise), &#x2018;in the midst of the garden&#x2019; refers to that which is in the middle of the woman, because &#x2018; garden&#x2019; means woman,&#x201D; etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1330"><sup>4</sup> The first editions read &#x201C;from her husband.&#x201D; This allegorical interpretation of the Paradise narrative is exceptionally bold. The &#x1E92;ohar, Gen. 35b, offers a parallel, having used our book as its original; see also Nachmanides, Torath Ha-Adam, 102b. The texts (Isa. lxi. 3, lx. 21, and xvii. 11) quoted by the &#x1E92;ohar <italic>in loc. cit.</italic> afford the scriptural basis for the interpretation in question.</ftnote>

Targ. Gen. iv. I, which has used our author. This Haggadah occurs also in the Church Father Ephraim (in Gen. vol. i. p. 35); he says that the serpent was made to crawl on its belly &#x201C;for having increased the pangs of child-bearing, through the seduction of Eve&#x201D;; see also Slavonic Enoch xxxi. 6. The legend was most probably known to Paul, who refers to the &#x201C;serpent&#x201D; as having &#x201C;beguiled Eve in his craftiness&#x201D;; see 2 Cor. xi. 2, 3, and cf. 1 Tim. ii. 14, 15; and Protevangelium of James, 13 (<italic>A.N.C.L</italic>. xvi. p. 8), and cf. 4 Macc. xviii. 8.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1344"><sup>8</sup> R. Ishmael seems to imply that, prior to the giving of the Law (Torah), the world&#x2019;s law was based on the impulses of nature and therefore immoral. See the Book of Adam and Eve (ed. Malan) 11. vii., as to the marriage of Adam&#x2019;s son Seth. Epiphanius, <italic>op. cit.</italic> xxxix. 5, refers to this subject.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1348"><sup>1</sup> Our book lays stress on the Passover in contradistinction to Jubilees, which exalts Pentecost and Tabernacles. Luria argues that as there was a tradition that the world was created on the 1st of Nisan, Adam was therefore created on the 6th, and &#x201C;at the end of days&#x201D; (Gen. iv. 3) means one week, and these numbers equal thirteen, and after this day is the 14th, which is the eve of Passover. The offering was brought on the 14th, and eaten that day at even, which is the beginning of the 15th. On the other hand, according to our book, <italic>supra,</italic> p. 52, the creation began on the 25th of Ellul, and Adam was fashioned on the 1st of Tishri; &#x201C;at the end of days&#x201D; would be interpreted as the change in the seasons from autumn to spring, when the first-fruits would be brought. Cf. <italic>infra,</italic> p. 236. Our text is reproduced by Pal. Targ. Gen. iv. 3, and Midrash Agadah (ed. Buber), Gen. p. 10, and see <italic>ibid.</italic> note 6.</ftnote>
<p>According to Dr. B&#x00FC;chler (<italic>J.Q.R</italic>. v. 442), in the first year of the triennial cycle of reading the Torah, a Palestinian custom, on the first day of Passover, Gen. iii. 22&#x2013;iv. 26 was read. Now, the story of the offering of Cain and Abel occurs in Gen. iv. 3 ff., and would fall in the Passover week. This explains our text, &#x201C;the night of the festival of Passover arrived.&#x201D; See <italic>J.E.</italic> xii. p. 256a, line 6; Gen. iii., which is quoted there, should probably be Gen. iv.</p>
<p>Chrysostomus (about 175 <small>C.E.</small>) declared that it was customary to begin reading from Genesis during Lent, <italic>i.e.</italic> Nisan. This shows that the Early Church followed the old Jewish custom of commencing the reading of the Torah in Nisan, the beginning of the Jewish ecclesiastical new year; see <italic>J.E. ibid.</italic> p. 257b. For a parallel reading, with slight variants, see Midrash Haggadol, c. 106 f.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1349"><sup>2</sup> In Tanchuma, Bereshith, &#x00A7; ix., we read: &#x201C;Some sages say, The remnants of his meal; other sages say, The seed of flax.&#x201D; See &#x2018;Arukh (ed. Kohut) iv. p. 229b; and cf. &#x1E92;ohar, Lev. 87a, where flax is mentioned as the offering of Cain.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1350"><sup>3</sup> The offering was the first-fruit of the animal and the first shearing of the wool.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1351"><sup>4</sup> This is also the reading of Oxford MS. (e. 76). The Oxford MS. (O.A. 167) and the first editions read &#x201C;was abhorred&#x201D;; cf. Prov. xxviii. 9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1352"><sup>1</sup> Wool from Abel&#x2019;s sheep and flax from Cain&#x2019;s offering. The two combined would come under the prohibition of Sha&#x2019;a&#x1E6D;ne&#x1E93; (cf. Deut. xxii. 11). Perhaps the prohibition of Kilayim (Lev. xix. 19) is also intended. This reference to Adam in connection with Sha&#x2019;atnez is probably intentional, and is our author&#x2019;s imitation of Jubilees, which also connects various laws with the Patriarchs. See Tanchuma, Bereshith, <italic>loc. cit</italic>., for a variant reading, and cf. &#x2018;Arukh, <italic>loc. cit., s.v.

<h1><small>THE FALL OF THE ANGELS</small> [26<small>A</small>. i.]</h1>
<p>&#x201C;A<small>ND</small><sup><xref rid="fn1384">1</xref></sup> Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and he begat in his own likeness after his image&#x201D; (Gen. v. 3). Hence thou mayest learn that Cain was not of Adam&#x2019;s seed,<sup><xref rid="fn1385">2</xref></sup> nor after his likeness, nor after his image.<sup><xref rid="fn1386">3</xref></sup> (Adam did not beget in his own image)<sup><xref rid="fn1387">4</xref></sup> until Seth was born, who was<sup><xref rid="fn1388">5</xref></sup> after his father Adam&#x2019;s likeness and image,<sup><xref rid="fn1389">6</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And he begat in his own likeness, after his image&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>Rabbi Simeon<sup><xref rid="fn1390">7</xref></sup> said: From Seth arose and were descended<sup><xref rid="fn1391">8</xref></sup> all the generations of the righteous.<sup><xref rid="fn1392">9</xref></sup> From Cain arose and were descended all the generations of the wicked, who rebel<sup><xref rid="fn1393">1</xref></sup> and sin, who rebelled against their Rock,<sup><xref rid="fn1394">2</xref></sup> and they said: We do not need the drops of Thy rain,<sup><xref rid="fn1395">3</xref></sup> neither to walk in Thy ways, as it is said, &#x201C;Yet they said unto God, Depart from us&#x201D; (Job xxi. 14).</p>
<p>Rabbi Meir said: &#x007C;&#x007C; The generations of Cain went about stark naked,<sup><xref rid="fn1396">4</xref></sup> men and women, just like the beasts,<sup><xref rid="fn1397">5</xref></sup> and they defiled themselves with all kinds of immorality, a man with his mother or his daughter, or the wife of his brother,<sup><xref rid="fn1398">6</xref></sup> or the wife of his neighbour, in public<sup><xref rid="fn1399">7</xref></sup> and in the streets, with evil inclination which is in the thought of their heart,<sup><xref rid="fn1400">8</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great<sup><xref rid="fn1401">1</xref></sup> in the earth&#x201D; (Gen. vi. 5).</p>
<p>Rabbi said: The angels who fell<sup><xref rid="fn1402">2</xref></sup> from their holy place in heaven saw the daughters of the generations of Cain<sup><xref rid="fn1403">3</xref></sup> walking about naked, with their eyes painted<sup><xref rid="fn1404">4</xref></sup> like harlots, and they went astray after them,<sup><xref rid="fn1405">5</xref></sup> and took wives from amongst them, as it is said, &#x201C;And the sons of Elohim<sup><xref rid="fn1406">6</xref></sup> saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all that they chose&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1407">7</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic> 2).</p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua<sup><xref rid="fn1408">8</xref></sup> said: The angels are flaming fire, as it is said, &#x201C;His servants are a flaming fire&#x201D; (Ps. civ. 4), and fire came with the coition of flesh and blood, but did not burn the body;<sup><xref rid="fn1409">9</xref></sup> but when they fell from heaven, from their holy place, their strength and stature (became) like that of the sons of men, and their frame was (made of) clods of dust, as it is said, &#x201C;My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust&#x201D; (Job vii. 5).</p>
<p>Rabbi Zadok said: From them were born the giants (Anakim),<sup><xref rid="fn1410">1</xref></sup> who walked with pride in their heart,<sup><xref rid="fn1411">2</xref></sup> and who stretched forth their hand to all (kinds of) robbery and violence, and shedding of blood,<sup><xref rid="fn1412">3</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And there we saw the Nephilim,<sup><xref rid="fn1413">4</xref></sup> the sons of Anak&#x201D; (Num. xiii. 33); and it says, &#x201C;The Nephilim were on the earth in those days&#x201D; (Gen. vi. 4).</p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua<sup><xref rid="fn1414">5</xref></sup> said: &#x007C;&#x007C; The Israelites are called &#x201C;Sons of God,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1415">6</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Ye are the sons of the Lord your God&#x201D; (Deut. xiv. 1). The angels are called &#x201C;Sons of God,&#x201D; as it is said, &#x201C;When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy&#x201D; (Job xxxviii. 7);<sup><xref rid="fn1416">7</xref></sup> and whilst they were still in their holy place in heaven, these were called &#x201C;Sons of God,&#x201D; as it is said, &#x201C;And also after that, when<sup><xref rid="fn1417">8</xref></sup> the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them; the same became the mighty men, which were of old, men of renown&#x201D; (Gen. vi. 4).<sup><xref rid="fn1418">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Levi said: They bare their sons and increased and multiplied<sup><xref rid="fn1419">10</xref></sup> like a great reptile, six children at each birth.<sup><xref rid="fn1420">11</xref></sup> In that very hour they<sup><xref rid="fn1421">12</xref></sup> stood on their feet, and spoke the holy language, and danced before them like sheep, as it is said, &#x201C;They cast their young like sheep, and their children danced&#x201D; (Job xxi. 11).</p>
<p>Noah<sup><xref rid="fn1422">13</xref></sup> said to them: Turn from your ways and evil deeds, so that He bring not upon you the waters of the Flood, and destroy all the seed of the children of men.<sup><xref rid="fn1423">1</xref></sup> They said to him: Behold, we will restrain ourselves from multiplying and increasing, so as not to produce the offspring of the children of men. What did they do? When they came to their wives they spilled the issue of their seed upon the earth<sup><xref rid="fn1424">2</xref></sup> so as not to produce offspring of the children of men, as it is said, &#x201C;And God saw the earth, and behold it was spilled&#x201D; (Gen. vi. 12). They said: If He bring from heaven the waters of the Flood upon us, behold, we are of high stature, and the waters will not reach &#x007C;&#x007C; up to our necks;<sup><xref rid="fn1425">3</xref></sup> and if He bring the waters of the depths against us, behold, the soles of our feet can close up all the depths. What did they do? They put forth the soles of their feet, and closed up all the depths.<sup><xref rid="fn1426">4</xref></sup> What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He heated the waters of the deep, and they arose and burnt their flesh, and peeled off their skin from them, as it is said, &#x201C;What time they wax warm, they vanish; when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place&#x201D; (Job vi. 17).

<ftnote id="fn1385"><sup>2</sup> See <italic>supra,</italic> pp. 150 f., for the statement that Cain was the offspring of Eve and Sammael. The Scripture text seems to have afforded ground for the distinction which the Rabbis and others drew between Cain and Seth: &#x201C;And Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bare Cain, and <italic>she</italic> said, I have acquired a man (child) from the Lord&#x201D; (Gen. iv. 1). Concerning Abel the Bible states, &#x201C;And she continued to bare his brother Abel&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 2), without adding any further qualification as in the case of Cain. With reference to Seth the text says, &#x201C;And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and he begat in <italic>his own likeness</italic> after <italic>his image,</italic> and <italic>he</italic> called his name Seth&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> v. 3). The fifth chapter of Genesis begins afresh the history of Adam&#x2019;s offspring, but omits all reference to Cain, whose descendants are mentioned in ch. iv. The Pal. Targum to Gen. v. 3 adds: &#x201C;but before Eve had borne Cain, who was not like to him&#x201D; (<italic>i.e.</italic> Adam).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1386"><sup>3</sup> The words &#x201C;likeness and image&#x201D; are not mentioned in the story of Cain&#x2019;s birth. The first editions add: &#x201C;neither did his deeds resemble those of Abel his brother.&#x201D; Cain inherited the nature of Sammael, the angel of Death, and became a murderer.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1387"><sup>4</sup> The words in brackets are not in the text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1388"><sup>5</sup> The first editions add: &#x201C;of his seed.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1389"><sup>6</sup> The first editions add: &#x201C;and his deeds were similar to those of Abel his brother.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1390"><sup>7</sup> The first editions read: &#x201C;Ishmael.&#x201D; Our MS. agrees with the Midrash Haggadol, c. 117, and the Oxford MS. (O.A. 167). Dr. B&#x00FC;chler observes: &#x201C;Also in the text of the Talmud Ishmael and Simeon are very frequently interchanged.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1391"><sup>8</sup> The first editions add: &#x201C;all the creatures.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1392"><sup>9</sup> See <italic>supra,</italic> p. 151, note 5, for this paragraph. There is probably some confusion in the texts here. &#x201C;The generations of the righteous&#x201D; are the offspring of Seth mentioned in Gen. v.; and &#x201C;the generations of the wicked&#x201D; are the offspring of Cain enumerated in Gen. iv. See &#x1E92;ohar, Gen. 35b, and Gen. Rab. xxiii. 1. Pal. Targum to Gen., <italic>loc. cit.</italic>, adds: &#x201C;And Cain was cast out; neither is his seed enumerated in the &#x2018;Book of the generations of Adam.&#x2019;&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1394"><sup>2</sup> Cf. <italic>infra,</italic> p. 341. The expression is often used to denote God as Creator. The first editions read: &#x201C;The Omnipresent.&#x201D; The Oxford MS.

The fact that our book protests so strongly against the immodest vogue which probably obtained at the period and in the place where the author lived might point to the &#x201C;origin&#x201D; of our book, if we could only locate the fact referred to. One is apt to think of the vagaries of certain classes of recluses who belonged to the Christian Church and led solitary lives in the deserts of Egypt. Thus, in the <italic>Paradise of the Holy Fathers</italic> (ed. Budge, vol. i. p. 242), we read of the Abba Bessarion, who &#x201C;wandered hither and thither like one possessed; in the season of frost he went naked.&#x201D; In the Jal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D; quoted above, the passage states (on the text, Deut. xxxii. 21, &#x201C;They have moved me to jealousy with that which is <italic>not God</italic>&#x201D;): &#x201C;this refers to those who come from Barbary (or Mauretania) who walk naked in the street.&#x201D; See also Siphr&#x00EA;, Deut. &#x00A7; 320.

<title>CHAPTER XXIII</title>
<h1><small>THE ARK AND THE FLOOD</small> [26<small>B</small>. ii.]</h1>
<p>&#x201C;<italic>And this</italic> is how thou shalt make the ark&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1428">1</xref></sup> (Gen. vi. 15). R. Shemiah taught: The Holy One, blessed be He, showed Noah with a finger<sup><xref rid="fn1429">2</xref></sup> and said to him, Like this and that shalt thou do to the ark. One hundred and fifty rooms<sup><xref rid="fn1430">3</xref></sup> were along the length at the left<sup><xref rid="fn1431">4</xref></sup> side of the ark, thirty-three<sup><xref rid="fn1432">5</xref></sup> rooms across the width in the side within,<sup><xref rid="fn1433">6</xref></sup> and thirty-three rooms in the side across the width on the outside;<sup><xref rid="fn1434">7</xref></sup> and ten compartments in the centre, which were for the storerooms for the food.<sup><xref rid="fn1435">8</xref></sup> And there were five protected cisterns<sup><xref rid="fn1436">9</xref></sup> on the right side of the ark, and fifty<sup><xref rid="fn1437">10</xref></sup> protected cisterns on the left side of the ark, and the openings for the water pipes opened and closed, and so was it in the lowest division;<sup><xref rid="fn1438">1</xref></sup> and so &#x007C;&#x007C; on the second floor, and so on the third floor.<sup><xref rid="fn1439">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The dwelling-place of all the cattle and animals<sup><xref rid="fn1440">3</xref></sup> was in the lowest compartment, the dwelling-place for all fowl was in the second compartment, and the dwelling-place for the reptiles<sup><xref rid="fn1441">4</xref></sup> and the human beings was in the third compartment.<sup><xref rid="fn1442">5</xref></sup> Hence thou mayest learn<sup><xref rid="fn1443">6</xref></sup> that there were 366 kinds of cattle on the earth, and 366 kinds of fowl on the earth, and 366 kinds of reptiles on the earth, for thus was (the number) in the lowest compartment,<sup><xref rid="fn1444">7</xref></sup> so in the second compartment, and so in the third floor, as it is said, &#x201C;With lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 16).</p>
<p>Rabbi Tachanah<sup><xref rid="fn1445">8</xref></sup> said: Noah made the ark during fifty-two years,<sup><xref rid="fn1446">9</xref></sup> so that they should repent of their ways.<sup><xref rid="fn1447">10</xref></sup> But they did not repent. Whilst yet the Flood had not come, the unclean (animals) were more numerous than the clean (animals). But when the waters of the Flood came, and the Holy One, blessed be He, wished to increase the clean and to diminish the unclean (animals), He called to Noah and said to him: Take to thee into the ark of all clean beasts seven and seven,<sup><xref rid="fn1448">1</xref></sup> the male and his female; and of the unclean beasts two and two, the male and his female, as it is said, &#x201C;Of every &#x007C;&#x007C; clean beast thou shalt take to thee<sup><xref rid="fn1449">2</xref></sup> seven and seven, the male and his female; and of the beasts that are not clean two, the male and his female&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> vii. 2).</p>
<p>Noah said to the Holy One, blessed be He: Sovereign of all the world &#x0021; Have I then the strength to collect them unto me to the ark? The angels appointed over each kind went down and gathered them,<sup><xref rid="fn1450">3</xref></sup> and with them all their food unto him to the ark. They came to him of their own accord,<sup><xref rid="fn1451">4</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And <italic>they</italic> came unto Noah into the ark&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 9); they came by themselves. &#x201C;And they brought (them) to Noah&#x201D; is not written here, but, &#x201C;And they <italic>came</italic> unto Noah into the ark.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1452">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Mana said: When all the creatures had entered (the ark), the Holy One, blessed be He, closed and sealed<sup><xref rid="fn1453">6</xref></sup> with His hand the gate<sup><xref rid="fn1454">7</xref></sup> of the ark, as it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord shut him in&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 16).</p>
<p>Rabbi Meir said: One pearl was suspended in the ark, and shed light upon all the creatures in the ark, like a lamp which gives light<sup><xref rid="fn1455">8</xref></sup> inside<sup><xref rid="fn1456">9</xref></sup> the house, and like the sun yonder which shines in his might, as it is said, &#x201C;A light shalt thou make to the ark&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> vi. 16).</p>
<p>Rabbi Zadok said: On the 10th of Marcheshvan all the creatures entered the ark; on the 17th of the same<sup><xref rid="fn1457">1</xref></sup> (month) the waters of the Flood descended from heaven upon the earth, for they were the waters (endowed with the) male (principle). And there came up the waters of the depths, for they are the waters (endowed) with the female (principle),<sup><xref rid="fn1458">2</xref></sup> and they were joined with one another, and they prevailed so as to destroy &#x007C;&#x007C; the world,<sup><xref rid="fn1459">3</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> vii.	19).</p>
<p>And all living things which were upon the face of the earth decayed,<sup><xref rid="fn1460">4</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And every living thing was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 23), except Noah and those who were with him in the ark, as it is said, &#x201C;And Noah only was left, and they that were with him in the ark&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>), except Og,<sup><xref rid="fn1461">5</xref></sup> king of Bashan, who sat down on a piece of wood under the gutter<sup><xref rid="fn1462">6</xref></sup> of the ark. He swore to Noah and to his sons that he would be their servant for ever.<sup><xref rid="fn1463">7</xref></sup> What did Noah do? He bored an aperture in the ark, and he put (through it) his food daily for him, and he also was left, as it is said, &#x201C;For only Og, king of Bashan, remained of the remnant of the giants&#x201D; (Deut. iii. 11).</p>
<p>(The Flood was universal) except in the land of Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn1464">8</xref></sup> upon which the water of the Flood did not descend from heaven, but the waters were gathered together from all lands, and they entered therein, as it is said, &#x201C;Son of man, say unto her, Thou art a land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon, in the day of indignation&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1465">1</xref></sup> (Ezek. xxii. 24). He<sup><xref rid="fn1466">2</xref></sup> sent forth the raven to ascertain what was (the state of) the world. It went and found a carcase of a man cast upon the summit of a mountain,<sup><xref rid="fn1467">3</xref></sup> and it settled thereon for its food,<sup><xref rid="fn1468">4</xref></sup> and it did not return with its message to its sender, as it is said, &#x201C;And he sent forth the raven&#x201D; (Gen. viii. 7). He sent forth the dove to see what was (the state of) the world, and she brought back her message to her sender, as it is said, &#x201C;And the dove came in to him at eventide,<sup><xref rid="fn1469">5</xref></sup> and, lo, in her mouth an olive leaf pluckt off&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1470">6</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic> 11). And why in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off? &#x007C;&#x007C; The dove spake before the Holy One, blessed be He, saying: Sovereign of all worlds &#x0021; Let my food be bitter like this olive, and let it be entrusted<sup><xref rid="fn1471">7</xref></sup> to Thy hand, and let it not be sweet (even) as honey, and given by the hand of flesh and blood.<sup><xref rid="fn1472">8</xref></sup> Hence they<sup><xref rid="fn1473">9</xref></sup> said: He who sends a message by the hand of an unclean (messenger)<sup><xref rid="fn1474">10</xref></sup> is (like) sending by the hand of a fool, and he who sends a message by the hands of a clean (messenger) is like sending by the hand of a messenger faithful to his senders.<sup><xref rid="fn1475">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Zadok said: For twelve<sup><xref rid="fn1476">12</xref></sup> months all the creatures were in the ark; and Noah stood and prayed before the Holy One, blessed be He, saying before Him:<sup><xref rid="fn1477">1</xref></sup> Sovereign of all worlds &#x0021; Bring me forth from this prison, for my soul is faint, because of the stench<sup><xref rid="fn1478">2</xref></sup> of lions.<sup><xref rid="fn1479">3</xref></sup> Through me will all the righteous crown Thee with a crown of sovereignty,<sup><xref rid="fn1480">4</xref></sup> because Thou hast brought me forth from this prison, as it is said, &#x201C;Bring my soul out of prison,<sup><xref rid="fn1481">5</xref></sup> that I may give thanks unto thy name: for the righteous shall crown me, when thou wilt have dealt bountifully with me&#x201D; (Ps. cxlii. 7).<sup><xref rid="fn1482">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Levitas, a man of Jamnia, said: He separated the males from the females of all which came to the ark<sup><xref rid="fn1483">7</xref></sup> when they came into the ark, as it is said, &#x201C;And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons&#x2019; wives&#x201D; (Gen. vii. 7). Verily the males were on one side.<sup><xref rid="fn1484">8</xref></sup> When they went forth from the ark, He caused the males to be joined with the females, as it is said, &#x201C;Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife,<sup><xref rid="fn1485">9</xref></sup> and thy sons, and thy sons&#x2019; wives with thee&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> viii. 16). Verily a man with his wife (went forth), &#x201C;Thy sons, and thy sons&#x2019; wives with thee&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1486">10</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic>) &#x007C;&#x007C; He blessed them, that they might increase and multiply on the earth, as it is said, &#x201C;And God blessed Noah and his sons,<sup><xref rid="fn1487">11</xref></sup> and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> ix. 1). The sons of Noah were fruitful and multiplied, and they begat sons with their twins with them.<sup><xref rid="fn1488">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Noah found a vine which was lying there,<sup><xref rid="fn1489">2</xref></sup> which had come out of the garden of Eden.<sup><xref rid="fn1490">3</xref></sup> It had its clusters with it, and he took of its fruit and ate, and rejoiced in his heart,<sup><xref rid="fn1491">4</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;My wine, which cheereth God and man&#x201D; (Judg. ix. 13). He planted a vineyard with it. On the selfsame day it produced and became ripe<sup><xref rid="fn1492">5</xref></sup> with its fruits, as it is said, &#x201C;In the day of thy planting thou dost make it grow,<sup><xref rid="fn1493">6</xref></sup> and in the morning thou makest thy seed to blossom&#x201D; (Isa. xvii. 11).<sup><xref rid="fn1494">7</xref></sup> He drank wine thereof, and he became exposed in the midst of the tent, as it is said, &#x201C;And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent&#x201D; (Gen. ix. 21).<sup><xref rid="fn1495">8</xref></sup> Canaan entered and saw the nakedness of Noah, and he bound a thread (where the mark of) the Covenant<sup><xref rid="fn1496">9</xref></sup> was, and emasculated him. He went forth and told his brethren. Ham entered and saw his nakedness. He did not take to heart the duty of honouring (one&#x2019;s father<sup><xref rid="fn1497">10</xref></sup>). But he<sup><xref rid="fn1498">11</xref></sup> told his two brothers in the market,<sup><xref rid="fn1499">12</xref></sup> making sport<sup><xref rid="fn1500">13</xref></sup> of his father. His two brothers rebuked him. What did they do? They took the curtain of the east<sup><xref rid="fn1501">1</xref></sup> with them, and they went backwards and covered<sup><xref rid="fn1502">2</xref></sup> the nakedness of their father, as it is said, &#x201C;And Shem and Japheth took a garment,<sup><xref rid="fn1503">3</xref></sup> and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father&#x2019;s nakedness&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 23).</p>
<p>Noah awoke from his wine, and he knew what the younger son of Ham had done unto him, and he cursed him,<sup><xref rid="fn1504">4</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And he said, Cursed be Canaan&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 25). Noah sat and mused in his heart, saying: The Holy One, blessed be He, delivered me &#x007C;&#x007C; from the waters of the Flood, and brought me forth from that prison, and am I not obliged to bring before Thee a sacrifice and burnt offerings?<sup><xref rid="fn1505">5</xref></sup> What did Noah do? He took from the clean<sup><xref rid="fn1506">6</xref></sup> animals an ox and a sheep,<sup><xref rid="fn1507">7</xref></sup> and from all the clean birds, a turtle-dove and pigeons; and he built up the first altar upon which Cain and Abel<sup><xref rid="fn1508">8</xref></sup> had brought offerings, and he brought four burnt offerings, as it is said, &#x201C;And Noah builded an altar unto the Lord; and took of every<sup><xref rid="fn1509">9</xref></sup> clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and he offered burnt offerings on the altar&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> viii. 20). It is written here only, &#x201C;and he offered burnt offerings on the altar,&#x201D; and the sweet savour ascended before the Holy One, blessed be He, and<sup><xref rid="fn1510">10</xref></sup> it was pleasing to Him, as it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord smelled the sweet savour&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 21). What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He put forth His right hand, and swore to Noah<sup><xref rid="fn1511">1</xref></sup> that He would not<sup><xref rid="fn1512">2</xref></sup> bring the waters of the Flood upon the earth, as it is said, &#x201C;For this is as the waters of Noah unto me; for as I have sworn<sup><xref rid="fn1513">3</xref></sup> that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth&#x201D; (Isa. liv. 9). And He gave a sign in the rainbow as a sign of the covenant of the oath between Himself and the people, as it is said, &#x201C;I do set my bow in the cloud,<sup><xref rid="fn1514">4</xref></sup> and it shall be for a token of a covenant&#x201D; (Gen. ix. 13).</p>
<p>And thus our sages instituted<sup><xref rid="fn1515">5</xref></sup> that they should (mention)<sup><xref rid="fn1516">6</xref></sup> the oath to Noah every day, as it is said, &#x201C;That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, upon the land<sup><xref rid="fn1517">7</xref></sup> which the Lord sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth&#x201D; (Deut. xi. 21).</p>
<p>Noah brought his sons and his grandsons, and he blessed them with their (several) settlements,<sup><xref rid="fn1518">8</xref></sup> and he gave them as an inheritance all the earth.<sup><xref rid="fn1519">9</xref></sup> He especially blessed<sup><xref rid="fn1520">10</xref></sup> Shem and his sons, (making them) dark but comely,<sup><xref rid="fn1521">11</xref></sup> and he gave them the habitable earth.<sup><xref rid="fn1522">12</xref></sup> He blessed Ham and his sons, (making them) dark &#x007C;&#x007C; like the raven,<sup><xref rid="fn1523">1</xref></sup> and he gave them as an inheritance the coast of the sea.<sup><xref rid="fn1524">2</xref></sup> He blessed Japheth and his sons, (making) them entirely white,<sup><xref rid="fn1525">3</xref></sup> and he gave them for an inheritance the desert and its fields;<sup><xref rid="fn1526">4</xref></sup> these (are the inheritances with) which he endowed them.<sup><xref rid="fn1527">5</xref></sup></p>

<h1><small>NIMROD AND THE TOWER OF BABEL</small> [28<small>B</small>. i.]</h1>
<p>R<small>ABBI</small> E<small>LIEZER</small><sup><xref rid="fn1528">1</xref></sup> said: They begat their sons and increased and multiplied like a great reptile, six at each birth,<sup><xref rid="fn1529">2</xref></sup> and they were all one people, and one heart, and one language, as it is said, &#x201C;And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech&#x201D; (Gen. xi. 1).<sup><xref rid="fn1530">3</xref></sup> They despised the pleasant land,<sup><xref rid="fn1531">4</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And it came to pass, as they journeyed<sup><xref rid="fn1532">5</xref></sup> in the east&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 2). They went to the land of Shinar, and found there a large stone,<sup><xref rid="fn1533">6</xref></sup> very extensive, and the whole plain, and they dwelt there, as it is said, &#x201C;And they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>Rabbi &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: They cast off the Kingdom of Heaven<sup><xref rid="fn1534">7</xref></sup> from themselves, and appointed Nimrod king over themselves; a slave son of a slave. Are not all the sons of Ham slaves?<sup><xref rid="fn1535">8</xref></sup> And woe to the land when a slave rules,<sup><xref rid="fn1536">9</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;For a servant, when he is king&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1537">10</xref></sup> (Prov. xxx. 22).</p>
<p>Rabbi Chakhinai<sup><xref rid="fn1538">11</xref></sup> said: Nimrod was a mighty hero, as it is said, &#x201C;And Cush begat Nimrod, who began to be a mighty one in the earth&#x201D; (Gen. x. 8). Rabbi Jehudah said:<sup><xref rid="fn1539">1</xref></sup> The coats<sup><xref rid="fn1540">2</xref></sup> which the Holy One, blessed be He, made for Adam and his wife, were with Noah<sup><xref rid="fn1541">3</xref></sup> in the ark, and when they went forth from the ark, &#x007C;&#x007C; Ham, the son of Noah, brought them forth with him, and gave them as an inheritance to Nimrod.<sup><xref rid="fn1542">4</xref></sup> When he put them on, all beasts, animals, and birds, when they saw the coats,<sup><xref rid="fn1543">5</xref></sup> came and prostrated themselves before him.<sup><xref rid="fn1544">6</xref></sup> The sons of men<sup><xref rid="fn1545">7</xref></sup> thought that this (was due) to the power of his might; therefore they made him king over themselves, as it is said, &#x201C;Wherefore it is said, Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the Lord&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 9).<sup><xref rid="fn1546">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nimrod said to his people:<sup><xref rid="fn1547">9</xref></sup> Come, let us build a great city for ourselves, and let us dwell therein, lest we be scattered upon the face of all the earth, as the first people<sup><xref rid="fn1548">10</xref></sup> (were). Let us build a great tower in its midst, ascending to heaven,<sup><xref rid="fn1549">11</xref></sup> for the power of the Holy One, blessed be He, is only in the water,<sup><xref rid="fn1550">12</xref></sup> and let us make us a great name on the earth, as it is said, &#x201C;And let us make us a name&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xi. 4).</p>
<p>Rabbi Phineas said: There were no stones there where-with to build the city and the tower. What did they do? They baked bricks and burnt them like a builder<sup><xref rid="fn1551">1</xref></sup> (would do), until they built it seven<sup><xref rid="fn1552">2</xref></sup> mils<sup><xref rid="fn1553">3</xref></sup> high, and it had ascents on its east and west. (The labourers) who took up the bricks went up on the eastern (ascent), and those who descended went down on the western (descent). If a man fell and died they paid no heed to him, but if a brick fell they &#x007C;&#x007C; sat down and wept, and said: Woe is us &#x0021; when will another one come in its stead?<sup><xref rid="fn1554">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>And Abraham,<sup><xref rid="fn1555">5</xref></sup> son of Terah,<sup><xref rid="fn1556">6</xref></sup> passed by, and saw them building the city and the tower, and he cursed them in the name of his God,<sup><xref rid="fn1557">7</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Swallow up, O Lord, divide their language&#x201D; (Ps. lv. 9). But they rejected his words,<sup><xref rid="fn1558">8</xref></sup> like a stone cast upon the ground. Is it not a fact that every choice and good<sup><xref rid="fn1559">9</xref></sup> stone is only put at the corner of a building? and with reference to this, the text says, &#x201C;The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> cxviii. 22).</p>
<p>Rabbi Simeon said: The Holy One, blessed be He, called to the seventy<sup><xref rid="fn1560">10</xref></sup> angels, who surround the throne of His glory, and He said to them: Come, let us descend and let us confuse the seventy nations and the seventy languages.<sup><xref rid="fn1561">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Whence (do we know) that the Holy One, blessed be He, spake<sup><xref rid="fn1562">1</xref></sup> to them? Because it is said, &#x201C;Go to, let <italic>us</italic> go down&#x201D; (Gen. xi. 7). &#x201C;I will go down&#x201D; is not written, but &#x201C;Go to, let <italic>us</italic> go down.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1563">2</xref></sup> And they cast lots among them. Because it is said, &#x201C;When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance&#x201D; (Deut. xxxii. 8). The lot of the Holy One, blessed be He, fell upon Abraham and upon his seed,<sup><xref rid="fn1564">3</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;For the Lord&#x2019;s portion is his people; Jacob is the <italic>lot</italic> of his inheritance&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 9).</p>
<p>The Holy One, blessed be He, said: The portion and lot which have fallen to Me,<sup><xref rid="fn1565">4</xref></sup> My soul liveth thereby,<sup><xref rid="fn1566">5</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;The lots have fallen unto me in pleasures; yea, I have a goodly heritage&#x201D; (Ps. xvi. 6). The Holy One, blessed be He, descended with the seventy angels, who surround &#x007C;&#x007C; the throne of His glory, and they confused their speech into seventy<sup><xref rid="fn1567">6</xref></sup> nations and seventy languages. Whence do we know that the Holy One, blessed be He, descended? Because it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord God <italic>came down</italic> to see the city and the tower&#x201D; (Gen. xi. 5). This was the second descent.<sup><xref rid="fn1568">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>And they wished to speak one to another in the language<sup><xref rid="fn1569">8</xref></sup> of his fellow-countryman, but one did not understand the language of his fellow. What did they do? Every one took his sword, and they fought one another to destroy (each other), and half the world fell there by the sword, and thence the Lord scattered them upon the face of all the earth, as it is said, &#x201C;So the Lord scattered them abroad on that account, upon the face of all the earth&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 8).</p>
<p>Rabbi Meir said: Esau, the brother of Jacob, saw the coats<sup><xref rid="fn1570">1</xref></sup> of Nimrod, and in his heart he coveted them,<sup><xref rid="fn1571">2</xref></sup> and he slew him,<sup><xref rid="fn1572">3</xref></sup> and took them from him.<sup><xref rid="fn1573">4</xref></sup> Whence (do we know) that they were desirable in his sight? Because it is said, &#x201C;And Rebecca took the <italic>precious</italic> raiment of Esau, her elder son&#x201D; (<italic>ibid</italic>, xxvii. 15). When he put them on he also became, by means of them, a mighty<sup><xref rid="fn1574">5</xref></sup> hero, as it is said, &#x201C;And Esau was a cunning hunter&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxv. 27). And when Jacob went forth<sup><xref rid="fn1575">6</xref></sup> from the presence of Isaac, his father, he said: Esau, the wicked one, is not worthy to wear these coats. What did he do? He dug in the earth and hid them there, as it is said, &#x201C;A noose<sup><xref rid="fn1576">7</xref></sup> is hid for him in the earth&#x201D; (Job xviii. 10).</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> third descent<sup><xref rid="fn1577">1</xref></sup> which He descended<sup><xref rid="fn1578">2</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C; was at Sodom, as it is said, &#x201C;I will go down now and see&#x201D; (Gen. xviii. 21). The Holy One, blessed be He, said: Shall I not<sup><xref rid="fn1579">3</xref></sup> tell My friend Abraham an important matter which I will do in My world in the future, as it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham that which I do?&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 17). Rabbi Chanina, son of Dosa,<sup><xref rid="fn1580">4</xref></sup> said: The Holy One, blessed be He, was revealed, and three angels<sup><xref rid="fn1581">5</xref></sup> (appeared) unto our father Abraham, as it is said, &#x201C;And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 2). He<sup><xref rid="fn1582">6</xref></sup> began to inform him about the conception<sup><xref rid="fn1583">7</xref></sup> of the womb by Sarah his wife, as it is said, &#x201C;I will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh round&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 10). Afterwards He<sup><xref rid="fn1584">8</xref></sup> told (him) about the doom<sup><xref rid="fn1585">9</xref></sup> of Sodom,<sup><xref rid="fn1586">10</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 20).</p>
<p>Hence thou mayest learn:<sup><xref rid="fn1587">1</xref></sup> Everyone, who wishes to tell his companion a matter which is a disgrace to him, begins with a good word<sup><xref rid="fn1588">2</xref></sup> and concludes with the evil matter which is unpleasant to him. Whence do we learn this? From the Holy One, blessed be He, for when He was revealed to our father Abraham, He began to announce to him (the good news) concerning the conception by Sarah his wife. Afterwards He told him about the fate of Sodom, as it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1589">3</xref></sup> (Abraham) began to ask for compassion before Him on behalf of Lot, the son of his brother. He spake before Him: Sovereign of all worlds &#x0021; Like the death of the wicked shall the death of the &#x007C;&#x007C; righteous be? (As it is said),<sup><xref rid="fn1590">4</xref></sup> &#x201C;Wilt thou consume the righteous<sup><xref rid="fn1591">5</xref></sup> with the wicked?&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 23). The Holy One, blessed be He, answered him: Abraham &#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn1592">6</xref></sup> By the merit of the righteous<sup><xref rid="fn1593">7</xref></sup> (one) will I forgive Sodom.<sup><xref rid="fn1594">8</xref></sup> &#x201C;If I find in Sodom fifty righteous&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 26), then will I forgive it all its<sup><xref rid="fn1595">9</xref></sup> sins.</p>
<p>Hence they<sup><xref rid="fn1596">10</xref></sup> said: If there be fifty righteous in the world, the world exists through their righteousness. (Abraham) arose and began to beseech (God), and made supplication before Him until he brought (the number down to) ten. Hence (the sages said):<sup><xref rid="fn1597">11</xref></sup> (When there are) ten people in a place, the place is delivered by their righteousness, as it is said, &#x201C;And he said, I will not destroy it for the sake of the ten&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 32).<sup><xref rid="fn1598">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi &#x1E92;e&#x2019;era said: The men of Sodom were the wealthy men of prosperity,<sup><xref rid="fn1599">1</xref></sup> on account of the good and fruitful land<sup><xref rid="fn1600">2</xref></sup> whereon they dwelt. For every need which the world requires, they obtained therefrom. They procured gold therefrom, as it is said, &#x201C;And it had dust of gold&#x201D; (Job xxviii. 6). What<sup><xref rid="fn1601">3</xref></sup> is the meaning (of the text), &#x201C;And it had dust of gold&#x201D;? At the hour when one of them wished to buy a vegetable, he would say to his servant, Go and purchase for me (for the value of) an assar.<sup><xref rid="fn1602">4</xref></sup> He went and bought (it), and found beneath it heaps of gold;<sup><xref rid="fn1603">5</xref></sup> thus it is written, &#x201C;And it had dust of gold&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1604">6</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic>). They obtained silver therefrom, as it is said, &#x201C;Surely there is a mine for silver&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 1). They procured precious stones and pearls thence, as it is said, &#x007C;&#x007C; &#x201C;The stones thereof are the place of sapphires&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 6). They obtained bread therefrom, as it is said, &#x201C;As for the earth, out of it cometh bread&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 5). But they did not trust in the shadow of their Creator, but (they trusted) in the multitude of their wealth,<sup><xref rid="fn1605">7</xref></sup> for wealth thrusts aside its owners from the fear of Heaven,<sup><xref rid="fn1606">8</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;They that trust in their wealth&#x201D; (Ps. xlix. 6).<sup><xref rid="fn1607">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Nathaniel<sup><xref rid="fn1608">10</xref></sup> said: The men of Sodom had no consideration for the honour of their Owner by (not) distributing food to the wayfarer and the stranger,<sup><xref rid="fn1609">1</xref></sup> but they (even) fenced in<sup><xref rid="fn1610">2</xref></sup> all the trees on top above their fruit so that they should not be seized;<sup><xref rid="fn1611">3</xref></sup> (not) even by the bird of heaven, as it is said, &#x201C;That path no bird of prey knoweth&#x201D; (Job xxviii. 7).</p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua, son of &#x1E32;orchah,<sup><xref rid="fn1612">4</xref></sup> said: They appointed over themselves judges who were lying judges, and they oppressed every wayfarer<sup><xref rid="fn1609">1</xref></sup> and stranger who entered Sodom by their perverse judgment, and they sent them forth naked, as it is said, &#x201C;They have oppressed the stranger without judgment&#x201D; (Ezek. xxii. 29).<sup><xref rid="fn1613">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>They were dwelling in security without care and at ease, without the fear of war from all their surroundings, as it is said, &#x201C;Their houses are safe from fear&#x201D; (Job xxi. 9).<sup><xref rid="fn1614">6</xref></sup> They were sated with all the produce of the earth, but they did not strengthen with the loaf of bread either the hand of the needy or of the poor,<sup><xref rid="fn1615">7</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom; pride, fulness of bread,<sup><xref rid="fn1616">8</xref></sup> and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy&#x201D; (Ezek. xvi. 49).<sup><xref rid="fn1617">9</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C;</p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah said: They made a proclamation in Sodom (saying): Everyone who strengthens the hand of the poor or the needy with a loaf of bread shall be burnt by fire. Pele&#x1E6D;ith,<sup><xref rid="fn1618">1</xref></sup> daughter of Lot, was wedded to one of the magnates of Sodom. She saw a certain very<sup><xref rid="fn1619">2</xref></sup> poor man in the street of the city, and her soul was grieved on his account, as it is said, &#x201C;Was not my soul grieved for the needy?&#x201D; (Job xxx. 25).<sup><xref rid="fn1620">3</xref></sup> What did she do? Every day when she went out to draw water she put in her bucket all sorts of provisions from her home, and she fed that poor man. The men of Sodom said: How does this poor man live? When they ascertained the facts, they brought her forth to be burnt with fire. She said: Sovereign of all worlds &#x0021; Maintain my right and my cause<sup><xref rid="fn1621">4</xref></sup> (at the hands of) the men of Sodom. And her cry ascended before the Throne of Glory. In that hour the Holy One, blessed be He, said: &#x201C;I will now descend, and I will see&#x201D; (Gen. xviii. 21)<sup><xref rid="fn1622">5</xref></sup> whether the men of Sodom have done according to the cry<sup><xref rid="fn1623">6</xref></sup> of this young woman, I will turn her foundations upwards,<sup><xref rid="fn1624">7</xref></sup> and the surface thereof shall be turned downwards, as it is said, &#x201C;I will now descend, and I will see whether they have done altogether according to her cry, which is come unto me&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). &#x201C;According to <italic>their</italic> cry&#x201D; is not written here (in the text), only &#x201C;According to her cry.&#x201D;</p>
<p>And thus the text says,<sup><xref rid="fn1625">8</xref></sup> &#x201C;He who walketh with wise men shall be wise: but the companion of fools shall be broken&#x201D; (Prov. xiii. 20). &#x007C;&#x007C; &#x201C;He who walketh with wise men shall be wise.&#x201D; To what is this like? To one who enters a perfumer&#x2019;s shop, although he neither takes anything nor gives anything,<sup><xref rid="fn1626">1</xref></sup> nevertheless he absorbs a good scent, and goes away (therewith). Likewise everyone who walks with the righteous acquires some of their good ways and deeds. Therefore it is said, &#x201C;He who walketh with wise men shall be wise.&#x201D; &#x201C;But the companion of fools shall be broken&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). To what is this comparable? To a man who enters a tannery, although he neither takes or gives anything,<sup><xref rid="fn1626">1</xref></sup> nevertheless he has absorbed a foul odour.<sup><xref rid="fn1627">2</xref></sup> Likewise he who walks with the wicked acquires some of their evil ways and deeds, that is according to what is written,<sup><xref rid="fn1628">3</xref></sup> &#x201C;But the companion of fools shall be broken&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>Another explanation:<sup><xref rid="fn1629">4</xref></sup> &#x201C;He who walketh with wise men shall be wise&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). This refers to Lot,<sup><xref rid="fn1630">5</xref></sup> who walked with our father Abraham, and learned of his good deeds and ways. They<sup><xref rid="fn1631">6</xref></sup> said: What did our father Abraham do? He made for himself a house opposite to Haran,<sup><xref rid="fn1632">7</xref></sup> and he received everyone who entered into or went out from Haran, and he gave him to eat and to drink. He said to them: Say ye, The God of Abraham is the only one in the universe.<sup><xref rid="fn1633">8</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C; When Lot came to Sodom he did likewise. When they made proclamation in Sodom: All who strengthen the hand of the poor or needy with a loaf of bread shall be burnt by fire,<sup><xref rid="fn1634">9</xref></sup> he was afraid of the men of the city, (and did not venture) to do so by day, but he did it by night, as it is said, &#x201C;And the two angels came to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom&#x201D; (Gen. xix. 1). Why did Lot sit in the gate of Sodom?<sup><xref rid="fn1635">1</xref></sup> Because he was afraid of the men of the city, (and did not venture) to act (charitably) by day, but he did so by night. He saw the two angels walking in the street of the city, and he thought that they were wayfarers in the land, and he ran to meet them. He said to them: Come and lodge ye overnight in my house, eat and drink, and ye shall go your way in peace. But the men would not accept this for themselves, and he took them by the hand against their will, and brought them inside his house, as it is said, &#x201C;And he urged them greatly&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 8).</p>
<p>A certain young man of the people of that city saw them, and he ran and told all the men of that city, and they all gathered together at the door of the house to do according to their wont, even deeds of sodomy,<sup><xref rid="fn1636">2</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, &#x007C;&#x007C; Where<sup><xref rid="fn1637">3</xref></sup> are the men who came to thee to-night? bring them forth unto us that we may know<sup><xref rid="fn1638">4</xref></sup> them&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 5). What did Lot do? Just as Moses gave his life for the people,<sup><xref rid="fn1639">5</xref></sup> so Lot<sup><xref rid="fn1640">6</xref></sup> gave up his two daughters instead of the two angels, as it is said, &#x201C;Behold, now, I have two daughters&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 8). But the men<sup><xref rid="fn1641">7</xref></sup> would not agree (and did not accept them). What did the angels do to them? They smote them with blindness until the dawn of the (next) morning. All were treated with (measure for) measure.<sup><xref rid="fn1642">8</xref></sup> Just as he had taken them by the hand without their will and taken them into his house, so they took hold of his hand,<sup><xref rid="fn1643">1</xref></sup> and the hand of his wife, and the hand of his two daughters, and took them outside the city, as it is said, &#x201C;But he lingered; and the men laid hold upon his hand&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 16). And they<sup><xref rid="fn1644">2</xref></sup> said to them:<sup><xref rid="fn1645">3</xref></sup> Do not look behind you, for verily the Shekhinah of the Holy One, blessed be He, has descended in order to rain upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire.<sup><xref rid="fn1646">4</xref></sup> The pity of &#x2018;Edith<sup><xref rid="fn1647">5</xref></sup> the wife of Lot was stirred for her daughters, who were married in Sodom,<sup><xref rid="fn1648">6</xref></sup> and she looked back behind her to see if they were coming after her or not. And she saw behind<sup><xref rid="fn1649">7</xref></sup> the Shekhinah, and she became a pillar of salt, as it is said, &#x201C;And his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 26).<sup><xref rid="fn1650">8</xref></sup></p>

Jer. v. 1 is the Biblical authority for the doctrine that the merit of the individual procures Divine forgiveness; cf. Ezek. xiv. 19. The inference as to the salvation of the <italic>world</italic> by the merit of fifty righteous people is derived from God&#x2019;s words in Gen. xviii. 26: &#x201C;And I will spare for their sake <italic>all</italic> the place&#x201D; (<italic>i.e.</italic> every place).

<title>CHAPTER XXVI</title>
<h1><small>THE TRIALS OF ABRAHAM</small> [31<small>A</small>. ii.]</h1>
<p>O<small>UR</small> father Abraham was tried with ten trials,<sup><xref rid="fn1652">1</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C; and he stood firm in them all.<sup><xref rid="fn1653">2</xref></sup> The first trial<sup><xref rid="fn1654">3</xref></sup> was when our father Abraham was born; all the magnates of the kingdom<sup><xref rid="fn1655">4</xref></sup> and the magicians sought to kill him, and he was hidden under the earth<sup><xref rid="fn1656">5</xref></sup> for thirteen years without seeing sun or moon. After thirteen years<sup><xref rid="fn1657">6</xref></sup> he went forth from beneath the earth, speaking the holy language;<sup><xref rid="fn1658">1</xref></sup> and he despised idols<sup><xref rid="fn1659">2</xref></sup> and held in abomination the graven images, and he trusted in the shadow of his Creator, and said:<sup><xref rid="fn1660">3</xref></sup> &#x201C;Blessed is the man who trusts in thee&#x201D; (Ps. lxxxiv. 12).</p>
<p>The second trial was when he was put into prison for ten years&#x2014;three years in Kuthi,<sup><xref rid="fn1661">4</xref></sup> seven years in Budri.<sup><xref rid="fn1662">5</xref></sup> After<sup><xref rid="fn1663">6</xref></sup> ten years they sent and brought him forth and cast him into the furnace of fire,<sup><xref rid="fn1664">7</xref></sup> and the King of Glory<sup><xref rid="fn1665">8</xref></sup> put forth His right hand<sup><xref rid="fn1666">9</xref></sup> and delivered him from the furnace of fire, as it is said, &#x201C;And he said to him, I am the Lord who brought thee out of the furnace<sup><xref rid="fn1667">10</xref></sup> of the Chaldees&#x201D; (Gen. xv. 7). Another verse (says), &#x201C;Thou art the Lord the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of the furnace of the Chaldees&#x201D; (Neh. ix. 7).<sup><xref rid="fn1668">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The third trial was his migration<sup><xref rid="fn1669">12</xref></sup> from his father&#x2019;s house<sup><xref rid="fn1670">13</xref></sup> and from the land of his birth; and He brought him to Haran,<sup><xref rid="fn1671">1</xref></sup> and there his father Terah died,<sup><xref rid="fn1672">2</xref></sup> and Athrai<sup><xref rid="fn1673">3</xref></sup> his mother.<sup><xref rid="fn1674">4</xref></sup> Migration is harder for man than for any other creature.<sup><xref rid="fn1675">5</xref></sup> Whence do we know of his migration? Because it is said, &#x201C;Now the Lord said &#x007C;&#x007C; unto Abram, Get thee out&#x201D; (Gen. xii. 1).<sup><xref rid="fn1676">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The fourth trial (was the famine). From the day when the heavens and the earth were created, the Holy One, blessed be He, had not brought into the world a famine but only in the days of Abraham,<sup><xref rid="fn1677">7</xref></sup> and not in any of the lands but only in the land of Canaan,<sup><xref rid="fn1678">8</xref></sup> in order to try him and to bring him down into Egypt, as it is said, &#x201C;And there was a famine in the land, and Abram went down into Egypt&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 10).</p>
<p>The fifth trial was when Sarah his wife was taken to Pharaoh to be (his) wife. And is there any man, who seeing his wife taken away to another man, would not rend his garments? But (he trusted in the Holy One, blessed be He,) that he would not approach her.<sup><xref rid="fn1679">9</xref></sup> Whence do we know that Sarah was taken to Pharaoh to be his wife? Because it is said, &#x201C;And the princes of Pharaoh saw her&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 15).<sup><xref rid="fn1680">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua, son of &#x1E32;orchah,<sup><xref rid="fn1681">11</xref></sup> said: In that night when our mother Sarah was taken, it was Passover night,<sup><xref rid="fn1682">12</xref></sup> and the Holy One, blessed be He, brought upon Pharaoh and upon his house great plagues,<sup><xref rid="fn1683">1</xref></sup> to make known<sup><xref rid="fn1684">2</xref></sup> that thus in the future would He smite the people of his land,<sup><xref rid="fn1685">3</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house with great <italic>plagues</italic>&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 17). Concerning the Egyptians it is written, &#x201C;Yet one <italic>plague</italic> more will I bring upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt&#x201D; (Ex. xi. 1). Was this a plague? Was it not (the slaying of) the first-born of the Egyptians? But the slaying is compared with the plagues, therefore it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord <italic>plagued</italic> &#x007C;&#x007C; Pharaoh&#x201D; (Gen. xii. 17).<sup><xref rid="fn1686">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua ben &#x1E32;orchah said: Because of his love for her, (Pharaoh)<sup><xref rid="fn1687">5</xref></sup> wrote in her marriage document (giving her) all his wealth,<sup><xref rid="fn1688">6</xref></sup> whether in silver, or in gold, or in man-servants, or land,<sup><xref rid="fn1689">7</xref></sup> and he wrote (giving) her the land of Goshen for a possession. Therefore the children of Israel dwelt in the land of Goshen, in the land of their mother Sarah.<sup><xref rid="fn1690">8</xref></sup> He (also) wrote (giving) her Hagar, his daughter<sup><xref rid="fn1691">9</xref></sup> from a concubine, as her handmaid. And whence do we know that Hagar was the daughter of Pharaoh?<sup><xref rid="fn1692">10</xref></sup> Because it is said, &#x201C;Now Sarai Abram&#x2019;s wife bare him no children; and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xvi. 1). Pharaoh rose up early in the morning confused<sup><xref rid="fn1693">11</xref></sup> because he had not approached her,<sup><xref rid="fn1694">12</xref></sup> and he sent and called Abraham, and said to him: Behold, Sarai thy wife is before thee, and all the deeds of her marriage contract are with her, take (her) and go, do not tarry in this land, as it is said, &#x201C;Now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xii. 19).<sup><xref rid="fn1695">1</xref></sup> &#x201C;And Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him,<sup><xref rid="fn1696">2</xref></sup> and they sent him forth&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 20). And he had Abraham led so as to come<sup><xref rid="fn1697">3</xref></sup> to the land of Canaan. He sojourned in the land of the Philistines<sup><xref rid="fn1698">4</xref></sup> in order to be refreshed there. And he went away. And everything is foreseen by the Holy One, blessed be He, and Abimelech<sup><xref rid="fn1699">5</xref></sup> sent and took Sarah, thinking to raise up children from her, as it is said, &#x201C;And Abimelech&#x2026; sent, and took Sarah&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xx. 2).</p>
<p>And Abimelech became impotent, and all the women of his house became barren,<sup><xref rid="fn1700">6</xref></sup> even &#x007C;&#x007C; to the smallest insect (which also became) barren, as it is said, &#x201C;For the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 18). And the angel Michael descended and drew his sword against him.<sup><xref rid="fn1701">7</xref></sup> Abimelech said to him:	Is this a true judgment and a true sentence to slay me as long as I had no knowledge?<sup><xref rid="fn1702">8</xref></sup> &#x201C;Wilt thou slay even a righteous nation?&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 4).<sup><xref rid="fn1703">9</xref></sup> He said unto him:<sup><xref rid="fn1704">10</xref></sup> &#x201C;Restore the man&#x2019;s wife, for he is a prophet&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 7).<sup><xref rid="fn1705">1</xref></sup> &#x201C;And he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua, son of &#x1E32;orchah, (rehearsed) before Rabbi &#x1E6C;arphon (saying): Whatever Pharaoh gave, he gave to Sarah; whatever Abimelech gave, he gave to Abraham; as it is said, &#x201C;And Abimelech took sheep and oxen&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 14).<sup><xref rid="fn1706">2</xref></sup> Abraham arose and prayed before the Holy One, blessed be He, and said before Him: Sovereign of all the worlds &#x0021; Thou hast created the whole world to increase and multiply, and let Abimelech and all the females of his household increase and multiply. The Holy One, blessed be He, was entreated of him, as it is said, &#x201C;And Abraham prayed<sup><xref rid="fn1707">3</xref></sup> unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants;<sup><xref rid="fn1708">4</xref></sup> and they bare children&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 17).</p>

This agrees with Jubilees xi. 16, which also speaks of his learning writing. Our author varies this by referring to his knowledge of the Holy language.

Afterwards they took Lot captive, and all his wealth, as it is said, &#x201C;And they took Lot&#x2026; and<sup><xref rid="fn1719">9</xref></sup> his goods&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 12).</p>
<p>Michael came and told Abraham, as it is said, &#x201C;And there came <italic>one who had escaped</italic>, and told Abram<sup><xref rid="fn1720">10</xref></sup> the Hebrew&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 13). He<sup><xref rid="fn1721">11</xref></sup> is the prince of the world, he was the one who told, as it is said, &#x201C;Curse not the king, no, not in thy thought;&#x2026; <italic>he who hath wings</italic> shall tell the matter&#x201D; (Eccles. x. 20). Why was his name called &#x201C;Pali&#x1E6D;&#x201D; (&#x201C;One who had escaped&#x201D;)? Because in the hour when the Holy One, blessed be He, caused Sammael and his band to descend from heaven from their holy place,<sup><xref rid="fn1722">1</xref></sup> he caught hold of <italic>the wings</italic> of Michael to make him fall<sup><xref rid="fn1723">2</xref></sup> with himself, and the Holy One, blessed be He, saved<sup><xref rid="fn1724">3</xref></sup> him from his power;<sup><xref rid="fn1725">4</xref></sup> therefore was his name called &#x201C;The one who had escaped.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1726">5</xref></sup> Concerning him Ezekiel said, &#x201C;One who had escaped<sup><xref rid="fn1727">6</xref></sup> out of Jerusalem came to me, saying, The city is smitten&#x201D; (Ezek. xxxiii. 21).</p>
<p>Abraham rose up early in the morning, and he took his three disciples, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre, with him, and Eliezer<sup><xref rid="fn1728">7</xref></sup> his servant with him (also), and he pursued after them as far as Dan, which is Pameas,<sup><xref rid="fn1729">8</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And he pursued as far as Dan&#x201D; (Gen. xiv. 14). And there the righteous man<sup><xref rid="fn1730">9</xref></sup> was hindered, for there it was told him: Abraham, know thou that in the future<sup><xref rid="fn1731">10</xref></sup> thy children&#x2019;s children will serve idols in this place; therefore was he hindered there. Whence do we know that Israel served idols there? Because it is said, &#x201C;And he made two calves of gold&#x2026; and he set the &#x007C;&#x007C; one<sup><xref rid="fn1732">11</xref></sup> in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan&#x201D; (1 Kings xii. 28, 29). There he left his three disciples,<sup><xref rid="fn1733">12</xref></sup> and he took his servant Eliezer. The numerical value of the letters of his name equals 318.<sup><xref rid="fn1734">13</xref></sup> He pursued them as far as the left of Damascus,<sup><xref rid="fn1735">1</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And he pursued them unto Hobah&#x201D; (Gen. xiv. 15).</p>
<p>Samuel the Younger said: There the night was divided for him; (the night) when the children of Israel went forth out of Egypt,<sup><xref rid="fn1736">2</xref></sup> that was the night in which Abraham smote the kings and their camps with them, as it is said, &#x201C;And he divided himself against them by night, he and his servants&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1737">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hillel the Elder said: Abraham took all the wealth of Sodom and Gomorrah and all the wealth of Lot, the son of his brother, and he returned in peace,<sup><xref rid="fn1738">4</xref></sup> and not even one of his men failed<sup><xref rid="fn1739">5</xref></sup> him, as it is said, &#x201C;And he brought back <italic>all</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1740">6</xref></sup> the goods, and also his brother Lot&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 16).<sup><xref rid="fn1741">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua<sup><xref rid="fn1742">8</xref></sup> said: Abraham was the first to begin to give a tithe. He took all the tithe of the kings and all the tithe of the wealth of Lot, the son of his brother, and gave (it) to Shem,<sup><xref rid="fn1743">9</xref></sup> the son of Noah, as it is said, &#x201C;And he gave him a tenth of all&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 20).</p>
<p>Shem, the son of Noah, came forth to meet him,<sup><xref rid="fn1744">1</xref></sup> and when he saw all the deeds which he had done and all the wealth which he had brought back, &#x007C;&#x007C; he wondered in his heart. He began to praise, to glorify, and to laud the name of the Most High, saying: &#x201C;And blessed be God the Most High, who hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). Abraham arose and prayed before the Holy One, blessed be He, saying: Sovereign of all worlds &#x0021; Not by the power of my hand, nor by the power of my right hand have I done all these things, but by the power of Thy right hand with which Thou dost shield me in this world and in the world to come, as it is said, &#x201C;But thou, O Lord, art a shield about me&#x201D; (Ps. iii. 3) in this world; &#x201C;my glory, and the lifter up of mine head&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn1745">2</xref></sup> in the world to come.<sup><xref rid="fn1746">3</xref></sup> The angels answered and said: Blessed art Thou, O Lord, the shield of Abraham.<sup><xref rid="fn1747">4</xref></sup></p>

<p>Rabbi Eliezer<sup><xref rid="fn1757">5</xref></sup> said: The Holy One, blessed be He, showed to our father Abraham (at the covenant) between the pieces<sup><xref rid="fn1758">6</xref></sup> the four kingdoms, their dominion and their downfall, as it is said, &#x201C;And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 9). &#x201C;An heifer of three years old&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>) refers to the kingdom of Edom,<sup><xref rid="fn1759">7</xref></sup> which is like the heifer of a sheep. &#x201C;And a she-goat of three years old&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>) refers to the kingdom of Greece,<sup><xref rid="fn1760">8</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly&#x201D; (Dan. viii. 8). &#x201C;And a ram of three years old&#x201D; (Gen. xv. 9); this is the kingdom of Media and Persia, as it is said, &#x201C;And the ram which thou sawest that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia&#x201D; (Dan. viii. 20).	&#x201C;And a turtle-dove&#x201D; (Gen. xv. 9); this refers to the sons of Ishmael.<sup><xref rid="fn1761">1</xref></sup> This expression is not to be understood in the literal meaning of T&#x00F4;r (turtle-dove), but in the Aramaic language, in which T&#x00F4;r means <italic>Ox</italic>, for when the male ox is harnessed to the female, they will open and break all the valleys,<sup><xref rid="fn1762">2</xref></sup> even as it says (about) &#x201C;the fourth beast&#x201D; (Dan. vii. 19).<sup><xref rid="fn1763">3</xref></sup> &#x201C;And a young pigeon&#x201D; (Gen. xv. 9); this refers to the Israelites, who are compared &#x007C;&#x007C; to a young pigeon, as it is said, &#x201C;O my dove, thou art in the clefts of the rock&#x201D; (Cant. ii. 14). For thy voice is pleasant in prayer, and thy appearance is beautiful in good deeds. &#x201C;And a young pigeon&#x201D; (Gen. xv. 9); this refers to the Israelites, who are compared to a young pigeon: &#x201C;My dove, my perfect (one), is (but) one&#x201D; (Cant. vi. 9).<sup><xref rid="fn1764">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Acha ben Jacob said: This expression, &#x201C;three years old&#x201D; (Gen. xv. 9), is said only with reference to the mighty in power, as it is said, &#x201C;And a threefold cord is not quickly broken&#x201D; (Eccles. iv. 12).<sup><xref rid="fn1765">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Mesharshyah<sup><xref rid="fn1766">6</xref></sup> said: (Three years old) refers to a threefold (dominion) which they would exercise three times in the future in the land of Israel. At the first time each one would rule by himself; at the second time two together (would rule); on the third occasion (all) altogether to fight against the house of David,<sup><xref rid="fn1767">7</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;The kings of the earth set themselves,<sup><xref rid="fn1768">1</xref></sup> and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his <italic>anointed</italic>&#x201D; (Ps. ii. 2).</p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua said: Abraham took his sword and divided them, each one into two parts, as it is said, &#x201C;And he took him all these, and he divided them in the midst&#x201D; (Gen. xv. 10). Were it not for the fact that he divided them, the world would not have been able to exist, but because he divided them, he weakened their strength, and he brought each part against its corresponding part, as it is said, &#x201C;And he laid each half over against the other&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). And the young pigeon he left alive, as it is said, &#x201C;But the bird he divided not&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). Hence thou mayest learn that there was not any other bird there except a young pigeon.<sup><xref rid="fn1769">2</xref></sup> The bird of prey came down upon them &#x007C;&#x007C; to scatter them and to destroy them.<sup><xref rid="fn1770">3</xref></sup> &#x201C;The bird of prey&#x201D; is nought else but David, the son of Jesse,<sup><xref rid="fn1771">4</xref></sup> who is compared to a &#x201C;speckled bird of prey,&#x201D; as it is said, &#x201C;<italic>Is mine heritage</italic> unto me as a speckled <italic>bird of prey</italic>?&#x201D; (Jer. xii. 9).</p>
<p>When the sun was about to rise in the east, Abraham sat down and waved his scarf over them, so that the bird of prey should not prevail over them until the raven came.<sup><xref rid="fn1772">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Ela&#x1E93;ar ben &#x2018;A&#x1E93;ariah said: From this incident thou mayest learn that the rule of these four kingdoms will only last one day<sup><xref rid="fn1773">6</xref></sup> according to the day of the Holy One, blessed be He. Rabbi Ela&#x1E93;ar ben &#x2018;Arakh said unto him: Verily it is so, according to thy word, as it is said, &#x201C;He hath made me desolate and faint <italic>all the day</italic>&#x201D; (Lam. i. 13), except for two-thirds of an hour (of God). Know that it is so. Come and see, for when the sun turns to set in the west, (during) two hours<sup><xref rid="fn1774">1</xref></sup> its power is weakened,<sup><xref rid="fn1775">2</xref></sup> and it has no light, likewise whilst the evening has not yet come, the light of Israel shall arise,<sup><xref rid="fn1776">3</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And it shall come to pass, that at <italic>evening time</italic> there shall be <italic>light</italic>&#x201D; (Zech. xiv. 7).</p>
<p>Abraham arose and prayed before the Holy One, blessed be He, that his children should not be enslaved by these four kingdoms. A deep sleep fell upon him, and he slept, as it is said, &#x201C;A deep sleep fell upon Abram&#x201D; (Gen. xv. 12). Does then a man lie down and sleep, and yet be able to pray? But this teaches thee that Abraham was lying down and sleeping because of the intensity of his prayer that his children might enslave &#x007C;&#x007C; these four kingdoms,<sup><xref rid="fn1777">4</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1778">5</xref></sup> &#x201C;Horror&#x201D; refers to the kingdom of Edom, as it is written, &#x201C;And behold a fourth beast, <italic>terrible</italic> and powerful, and strong exceedingly&#x201D; (Dan. vii. 7). &#x201C;Darkness&#x201D; is the kingdom<sup><xref rid="fn1779">6</xref></sup> of those who <italic>darken</italic> the eyes of Israel (by preventing the observance of) all the precepts which are in the Torah. &#x201C;Great&#x201D; (Gen. xv. 12) refers to the kingdom of Media and Persia, which was <italic>great</italic> (enough to be able to afford) to sell Israel for nought.<sup><xref rid="fn1780">7</xref></sup> &#x201C;Fell&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>) refers to the kingdom of Babylon, because in their hand <italic>fell</italic> the crown<sup><xref rid="fn1781">8</xref></sup> of Israel, as it is said, &#x201C;Babylon is fallen, is fallen&#x201D; (Isa. xxi. 9). &#x201C;<italic>Upon him</italic>&#x201D; (Gen. xv. 12) refers to the Ishmaelites, <italic>upon whom</italic> the Son of David will flourish,<sup><xref rid="fn1782">1</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;His enemies will I clothe with shame:<sup><xref rid="fn1783">2</xref></sup> but <italic>upon him</italic> shall his crown flourish&#x201D; (Ps. cxxxii. 18).</p>
<p>Rabbi &#x1E92;e&#x2019;era<sup><xref rid="fn1784">3</xref></sup> said: These kingdoms were created only as fuel for Gehinnom, as it is said, &#x201C;Behold, a smoking furnace,<sup><xref rid="fn1785">4</xref></sup> and a flaming torch that passed&#x201D; (Gen. xv. 17). Here the word &#x201C;furnace&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1786">5</xref></sup> signifies only Gehinnom, which is compared to a furnace, as it is said, &#x201C;Saith the Lord, whose <italic>fire</italic> is in Zion, and his <italic>furnace</italic> in Jerusalem&#x201D; (Isa. xxxi. 9).</p>

<h1><small>THE TRIALS OF ABRAHAM</small> (<italic>continued</italic>)</h1>
<h2><italic>The Covenant of Circumcision</italic> [33<small>B</small>. ii.]</h2>
<p>T<small>HE</small> eighth trial (was as follows): &#x201C;And when Abram was ninety-nine years old&#x201D; (Gen. xvii. 1),<sup><xref rid="fn1787">1</xref></sup> the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Until now thou hast not been perfect before Me; but circumcise the flesh of thy foreskin, and &#x201C;walk before me, and be thou perfect&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1788">2</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic>). Moreover, the foreskin is a reproach, as it is said, &#x201C;For that is a reproach unto us&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxxiv. 14), because the foreskin is more unclean than all unclean things, as it is said, &#x201C;For henceforth there shall no more &#x007C;&#x007C; come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean&#x201D; (Isa. lii. 1). For the foreskin is a blemish above all blemishes. Circumcise the flesh of thy foreskin and be perfect.</p>
<p>Rabban Gamaliel said: Abraham sent and called for Shem,<sup><xref rid="fn1789">3</xref></sup> the son of Noah, and he circumcised the flesh of the foreskin of our father Abraham,<sup><xref rid="fn1790">4</xref></sup> and the flesh of the foreskin of Ishmael his son, as it is said, &#x201C;In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1791">5</xref></sup> (Gen. xvii. 26). &#x201C;In the selfsame day&#x201D; (means) in the might of the sun at midday.<sup><xref rid="fn1792">6</xref></sup> Not only that, but (it indicates) the tenth day of the month,<sup><xref rid="fn1793">1</xref></sup> the Day of Atonement. It is written in connection with the Day of Atonement, &#x201C;Ye shall do no manner of work on that <italic>selfsame day</italic>, for it is a day of atonement&#x201D; (Lev. xxiii. 28); and in the present instance the text says, &#x201C;In the <italic>selfsame day</italic> was Abraham circumcised&#x201D; (Gen. xvii. 26). Know then that on the Day of Atonement Abraham our father was circumcised.<sup><xref rid="fn1794">2</xref></sup> Every year the Holy One, blessed be He, sees the blood of our father Abraham&#x2019;s circumcision, and He forgives all the sins of Israel, as it is said, &#x201C;<italic>For on this</italic> day<sup><xref rid="fn1795">3</xref></sup> shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you&#x201D; (Lev. xvi. 30). In that place where Abraham was circumcised and his blood remained, there the altar was built,<sup><xref rid="fn1796">4</xref></sup> and therefore, &#x201C;And all the blood thereof shall he pour out at the base of the altar&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> iv. 30). (It says also),<sup><xref rid="fn1797">5</xref></sup> &#x201C;I said unto thee, In thy blood, live;<sup><xref rid="fn1798">6</xref></sup> yea, I said unto thee, In thy blood, live&#x201D; (Ezek. xvi. 6).</p>
<p>Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa said: All who are circumcised have (excessive) pain on the third day, as it is said, &#x201C;And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore&#x201D; (Gen. xxxiv. 25).<sup><xref rid="fn1799">7</xref></sup> They may wash &#x007C;&#x007C; the child on the third day,<sup><xref rid="fn1800">8</xref></sup> when it happens to fall on the Sabbath, and all things necessary for a circumcision<sup><xref rid="fn1801">9</xref></sup> are permitted to be done on the Sabbath.<sup><xref rid="fn1802">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Every uncircumcised (man) shall not eat (of the Paschal offering), and shall not touch the sanctuary. He who separates himself from circumcision is like one separated from the Holy One, blessed be He.</p>
<p>Rabban Gamaliel,<sup><xref rid="fn1803">1</xref></sup> the son of Rabbi Jehudah the Prince, said: When our father Abraham was circumcised, on the third day he was very sore,<sup><xref rid="fn1804">2</xref></sup> in order to test him.<sup><xref rid="fn1805">3</xref></sup> What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He pierced one hole in the midst of Gehinnom, and He made the day hot, like the day of the wicked.<sup><xref rid="fn1806">4</xref></sup> He<sup><xref rid="fn1807">5</xref></sup> went forth, and sat down at the entrance of the tent in the cool of the day, as it is said, &#x201C;And he sat at the tent door (in the heat of the day)&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xviii. 1). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to the ministering angels: Come ye, let us descend and visit the sick, for the virtue of visiting the sick is great before Me.<sup><xref rid="fn1808">6</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, and the angels descended to visit our father Abraham, as it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord appeared unto him&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to the ministering angels: Come ye and see ye<sup><xref rid="fn1809">7</xref></sup> the power of circumcision.<sup><xref rid="fn1810">8</xref></sup> Before Abraham was circumcised he fell<sup><xref rid="fn1811">9</xref></sup> on his face (before Me), and afterwards I spake with him, as it is said, &#x201C;And Abraham fell upon his face&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xvii. 17). Now that he is circumcised he sits and I stand. Whence do we know that the Holy One, blessed be He, was standing? Because it is said, &#x201C;And he looked, and, lo, three men <italic>stood</italic> over against him&#x201D; (<italic>ibid</italic>, xviii. 2).</p>
<p>Rabbi &#x1E92;e&#x2019;era &#x007C;&#x007C; said: There are five<sup><xref rid="fn1812">1</xref></sup> kinds of &#x2018;Orlah (things uncircumcised) in the world: four with reference to man, and one concerning trees. Whence do we know this concerning the four (terms) applying to man? (Namely,) the uncircumcision of the ear, the uncircumcision of the lips, the uncircumcision of the heart, and the uncircumcision of the flesh. Whence do we know of the uncircumcision of the ear? Because it is said, &#x201C;Behold, their ear is uncircumcised&#x201D; (Jer. vi. 10). Whence do we know of the uncircumcision of the lips? Because it is said, &#x201C;For I am of uncircumcised lips&#x201D; (Ex. vi. 12). Whence do we know of the uncircumcision of the heart? Because it is said, &#x201C;Circumcise the foreskin of your heart&#x201D; (Deut. x. 16); and (the text) says, &#x201C;For all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart&#x201D; (Jer. ix. 26). Whence do we know of the uncircumcision of the flesh? Because it is said, &#x201C;And the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin&#x201D; (Gen. xvii. 14). And &#x201C;all the nations are uncircumcised&#x201D; in all the four cases, and &#x201C;all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.&#x201D; The uncircumcision of the heart does not suffer Israel to do the will of their Creator. And in the future the Holy One, blessed be He, will take away from Israel the uncircumcision of the heart, and they will not harden their stubborn (heart) any more before their Creator, as it is said, &#x201C;And I will take away the stony heart<sup><xref rid="fn1813">2</xref></sup> out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh&#x201D; (Ezek. xxxvi. 26); and it is said, &#x201C;And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1814">3</xref></sup> (Gen. xvii. 11). Whence do we know concerning the one (&#x2018;Orlah) for trees?<sup><xref rid="fn1815">4</xref></sup> Because it is said, &#x201C;And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as their uncircumcision:<sup><xref rid="fn1816">1</xref></sup> three years shall they be as uncircumcised unto you&#x201D; (Lev. xix. 23).</p>
<p>Rabbi &#x1E92;e&#x2019;era<sup><xref rid="fn1817">2</xref></sup> taught: The tree &#x007C;&#x007C; which is mentioned here is none other than the vine tree.<sup><xref rid="fn1818">3</xref></sup> If they do not cut off from the tree the fruit of the first three years, all the fruit which it yields will be gleanings fit to be pluckt off, and not good; and its wine will be disqualified for the altar; but if they cut off from the tree the fruit of the first three years, all the fruit which it yields will be good for the sight, and their wine will be selected to be brought upon the altar. So with our father Abraham; before he was circumcised, the fruit which he produced was not good [in its effects,<sup><xref rid="fn1819">4</xref></sup> and was disqualified from the altar; but when he had been circumcised, the fruit which he produced was good in its effects,<sup><xref rid="fn1820">5</xref></sup> and his wine]<sup><xref rid="fn1821">6</xref></sup> was chosen to be put upon the altar like wine for a libation, as it is said, &#x201C;And wine for the drink offering&#x201D; (Num. xv. 5).</p>
<p>Rabbi<sup><xref rid="fn1822">7</xref></sup> said: Abraham did not delay aught<sup><xref rid="fn1823">8</xref></sup> with reference to all (things) which He commanded him, as it is said, &#x201C;And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised&#x201D; (Gen. xvii. 12); and when Isaac was born, (and when) he was eight days old (Abraham) brought him to be circumcised, as it is said, &#x201C;And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxi. 4). Hence thou mayest learn that everyone who brings his son for circumcision is as though (he were) a high priest bringing his meal offering and his drink offering upon the top of the altar.<sup><xref rid="fn1824">9</xref></sup> Hence the sages said: A man is bound to make festivities and a banquet on that day when he has the merit of having his son<sup><xref rid="fn1825">1</xref></sup> circumcised, like Abraham our father, who circumcised his son, as it is said, &#x201C;And Abraham circumcised &#x007C;&#x007C; his son Isaac&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1826">2</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>Rabbi Jochanan said: All heathens who come to Israel are circumcised by their own freewill and with their consent, and in the fear of Heaven are they circumcised. We do not believe a proselyte until seven generations (have passed), so that the waters should not return to their source.<sup><xref rid="fn1827">3</xref></sup> But slaves are circumcised both by their freewill and with their consent as well as without their consent, and no confidence is placed in slaves. Likewise with all the slaves who were circumcised with our father Abraham, they did not remain true (converts) in Israel, neither they nor their seed, because it is said, &#x201C;All the men of his house, those born in the house,<sup><xref rid="fn1828">4</xref></sup> and those bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xvii. 27). Why did he circumcise them? Because of purity, so that they should not defile their masters with their food and with their drink, for whosoever eateth with an uncircumcised person is as though he were eating flesh of abomination.<sup><xref rid="fn1829">5</xref></sup> All who bathe with the uncircumcised are as though they bathed with carrion,<sup><xref rid="fn1830">6</xref></sup> and all who touch an uncircumcised person are as though they touched the dead, for in their lifetime they are like (the) dead;<sup><xref rid="fn1831">7</xref></sup> and in their death they are like the carrion of the beast,<sup><xref rid="fn1832">1</xref></sup> and their prayer does not come before the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is said, &#x201C;The dead praise not the Lord&#x201D; (Ps. cxv. 17). But Israel who are circumcised, their prayer comes before the Holy One, blessed be He, &#x007C;&#x007C; like a sweet savour, as it is said, &#x201C;But <italic>we will bless</italic> the Lord<sup><xref rid="fn1833">2</xref></sup> from this time forth and for evermore. Praise ye the Lord&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 18).</p>
<p>Rabbi said: Isaac circumcised Jacob, and Esau;<sup><xref rid="fn1834">3</xref></sup> and Esau despised the covenant of circumcision just as he despised the birthright, as it is said, &#x201C;So Esau despised his birthright&#x201D; (Gen. xxv. 34). Jacob clung to the covenant of circumcision, and circumcised his sons and his grandsons. Whence (do we know) that the sons of Jacob were circumcised? Because it is said, &#x201C;Only on this condition will the men consent unto us to dwell<sup><xref rid="fn1835">4</xref></sup> with us&#x2026; if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxxiv. 22). Another text says, &#x201C;Only on this condition will we consent unto you: if ye will be as we be&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 15).<sup><xref rid="fn1836">5</xref></sup> Hence thou canst learn that the sons of Jacob were circumcised. The sons of Jacob circumcised their sons and their grandsons. They gave it to them as an inheritance for an everlasting statute, until Pharaoh the Wicked arose<sup><xref rid="fn1837">6</xref></sup> and decreed harsh laws concerning them, and withheld from them the covenant of circumcision. And on the day when the children of Israel went forth from Egypt all the people were circumcised, both young and old, as it is said, &#x201C;For all the people that came out were circumcised&#x201D; (Josh. v. 5).</p>
<p>The Israelites took the blood of the covenant of circumcision,<sup><xref rid="fn1838">1</xref></sup> and they put (it)<sup><xref rid="fn1839">2</xref></sup> upon the lintel of their houses, and when the Holy One, blessed be He, passed over to plague the Egyptians, He saw the blood of the covenant of circumcision upon the lintel of their houses and the blood of the Paschal lamb, He was filled &#x007C;&#x007C; with compassion<sup><xref rid="fn1840">3</xref></sup> on Israel, as it is said, &#x201C;And when I passed by thee, and saw thee weltering in thy (twofold) blood,<sup><xref rid="fn1841">4</xref></sup> I said unto thee, In thy (twofold) blood, live; yea, I said unto thee, In thy (twofold) blood, live&#x201D; (Ezek. xvi. 6). &#x201C;In thy blood&#x201D; is not written here, but in &#x201C;thy (twofold) blood,&#x201D; with twofold blood, the blood of the covenant of circumcision and the blood of the Paschal lamb; therefore it is said, &#x201C;I said unto thee, In thy (twofold) blood, live; yea, I said unto thee, In thy (twofold) blood, live&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer said: Why<sup><xref rid="fn1842">5</xref></sup> did the text say twice, &#x201C;I said unto thee, In thy blood, live; yea, I said unto thee, In thy blood, live&#x201D;? But the Holy One, blessed be He, said: By the merit of the blood of the covenant of circumcision and the blood of the Paschal lamb ye shall be redeemed from Egypt, and by the merit of the covenant of circumcision and by the merit of the covenant of the Passover in the future ye shall be redeemed at the end of the fourth kingdom;<sup><xref rid="fn1843">6</xref></sup> therefore it is said, &#x201C;I said unto thee, In thy blood, live; yea, I said unto thee, In thy blood, live&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1844">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are three afflictions,<sup><xref rid="fn1845">2</xref></sup> (namely,) the affliction of the fast, the affliction of the prison, and the affliction of the road.<sup><xref rid="fn1846">3</xref></sup> Whence do we know of the affliction of the fast? (Because it is said,)<sup><xref rid="fn1847">4</xref></sup> &#x201C;I <italic>afflicted</italic> my soul with <italic>fasting</italic>&#x201D; (Ps. xxxv. 13). Whence do we know of the affliction of the prison? (Because it is said,)<sup><xref rid="fn1847">4</xref></sup> &#x201C;They <italic>hurt</italic> his feet with <italic>fetters</italic>&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> cv. 18). Whence do we know of the affliction of the road? (Because it is said,)<sup><xref rid="fn1847">4</xref></sup> &#x201C;He weakened my strength <italic>in the way</italic>&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> cii. 23). On account of the affliction of the road, (the children of Israel)<sup><xref rid="fn1847">4</xref></sup> did not circumcise, and when they went forth from Egypt all the people were circumcised, both young and old, as it is said, &#x201C;For all the people that came out were circumcised&#x201D; &#x007C;&#x007C; (Josh. v. 5).<sup><xref rid="fn1848">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Ishmael said: Did the uncircumcised<sup><xref rid="fn1849">6</xref></sup> hear the voice of the Holy One, blessed be He, on Mount Sinai, saying, &#x201C;I am the Lord thy God&#x201D; (Ex. xx. 2)?<sup><xref rid="fn1850">7</xref></sup> They were circumcised, but not according to its regulation.<sup><xref rid="fn1851">8</xref></sup> They had cut off the foreskin, but they had not uncovered the corona. Everyone who has been circumcised, but has not had the corona uncovered, is as though he had not been circumcised, therefore the text says, &#x201C;Israel was not circumcised of old.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1852">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>When they came to the land (of Canaan),<sup><xref rid="fn1853">10</xref></sup> the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Joshua: Joshua &#x0021; Dost thou not know that the Israelites are not circumcised according to the proper regulation? He again circumcised them a second time, as it is said, &#x201C;The Lord said unto Joshua, Make thee knives of flint,<sup><xref rid="fn1854">1</xref></sup> and circumcise again the children of Israel a second time&#x201D; (Josh. v. 2). &#x201C;And Joshua made him knives of flint&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 3), and he gathered all the foreskins until he made them (as high) as a hill, as it is said, &#x201C;And he circumcised the children of Israel at the <italic>hill</italic> of the foreskins&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). The Israelites took the foreskin and the blood<sup><xref rid="fn1855">2</xref></sup> and covered them with the dust<sup><xref rid="fn1856">3</xref></sup> of the wilderness. When Balaam<sup><xref rid="fn1857">4</xref></sup> came, he saw all the wilderness filled with the foreskins of the Israelites, he said: Who will be able to arise by the merit of the blood of the covenant of this circumcision, which is covered by the dust? as it is said, &#x201C;Who can count the dust of Jacob?&#x201D; (Num. xxiii. 10).</p>
<p>Hence &#x007C;&#x007C; the sages instituted that they should cover the foreskin and the blood with the dust of the earth,<sup><xref rid="fn1858">5</xref></sup> because they<sup><xref rid="fn1859">6</xref></sup> are compared to the dust of the earth, as it is said, &#x201C;And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth&#x201D; (Gen. xxviii. 14). Thus the Israelites were wont to circumcise until they were divided into two kingdoms. The kingdom of Ephraim cast off from themselves the covenant of circumcision.<sup><xref rid="fn1860">7</xref></sup> Elijah, may he be remembered for good, arose and was zealous with a mighty passion, and he adjured the heavens to send down neither dew nor rain upon the earth. Jezebel heard (thereof), and sought to slay him. Elijah arose and prayed before the Holy One, blessed be He.</p>
<p>The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: &#x201C;Art thou better than thy fathers?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1861">8</xref></sup> Esau sought to slay Jacob, but he fled before him,<sup><xref rid="fn1862">1</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And Jacob fled into the field of Aram&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1863">2</xref></sup> (Hos. xii. 12). Pharaoh sought to slay Moses, who fled before him and he was saved, as it is said, &#x201C;Now when Pharaoh heard this thing,<sup><xref rid="fn1864">3</xref></sup> he sought to slay Moses. And Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh&#x201D; (Ex. ii. 15). Saul sought to slay David, who fled before him and was saved, as it is said, &#x201C;If thou save not thy life to-night, to-morrow thou shalt be slain&#x201D; (1 Sam. xix. 11).<sup><xref rid="fn1865">4</xref></sup> Another text says, &#x201C;And David fled and escaped&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 18). Learn that everyone, who flees, is saved. Elijah, may he be remembered for good, arose and fled from the land of Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn1866">5</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C; and he betook himself to Mount Horeb, as it is said, &#x201C;And he arose, and did eat and drink&#x201D; (1 Kings xix. 8). There the Holy One, blessed be He, was revealed unto him, and He said to him: &#x201C;What doest thou here, Elijah?&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 9). He answered Him, saying: &#x201C;I have been very zealous&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 10). (The Holy One, blessed be)<sup><xref rid="fn1867">6</xref></sup> He, said to him: Thou art always zealous &#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn1868">7</xref></sup> Thou wast zealous in Shittim<sup><xref rid="fn1869">8</xref></sup> on account of the immorality. Because it is said, &#x201C;Phineas,<sup><xref rid="fn1870">9</xref></sup> the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest,<sup><xref rid="fn1871">10</xref></sup> turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, in that he was zealous with my zeal among them&#x201D; (Num. xxv. 11). Here also art thou zealous. By thy life &#x0021; They<sup><xref rid="fn1872">11</xref></sup> shall not observe the covenant of circumcision until thou seest it (done) with thine eyes.</p>
<p>Hence the sages<sup><xref rid="fn1873">1</xref></sup> instituted (the custom) that people should have a seat of honour for the Messenger of the Covenant; for Elijah, may he be remembered for good, is called the Messenger of the Covenant, as it is said, &#x201C;And the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in, behold, he cometh&#x201D; (Mal. iii. 1).<sup><xref rid="fn1874">2</xref></sup></p>

<h1><small>THE TRIALS OF ABRAHAM</small> (<italic>continued</italic>)</h1>
<h2><italic>Abraham and Ishmael</italic> [36<small>A</small>. ii.]</h2>
<p>T<small>HE</small> ninth trial (was as follows): Ishmael was born with (the prophecy of the) bow,<sup><xref rid="fn1879">1</xref></sup> and he grew up with the bow,<sup><xref rid="fn1880">2</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And God was with the lad, and he grew &#x2026;<sup><xref rid="fn1881">3</xref></sup> and he became an archer&#x201D; (Gen. xxi. 20). He took bow and arrows and began to shoot at the birds.<sup><xref rid="fn1882">4</xref></sup> He saw Isaac sitting by himself, and he shot an arrow<sup><xref rid="fn1883">5</xref></sup> at him to slay him.<sup><xref rid="fn1884">6</xref></sup> Sarah saw (this), and told Abraham. She said to him: Thus and thus has Ishmael done to Isaac, but (now) arise and write (a will in favour) of Isaac, (giving him) all that the Holy One has sworn to give &#x007C;&#x007C; to thee and to thy seed.<sup><xref rid="fn1885">7</xref></sup> The son of this handmaid shall not inherit with my son, with Isaac, as it is said, &#x201C;And she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 10).</p>
<p>Ben Tema<sup><xref rid="fn1886">8</xref></sup> said: Sarah said to Abraham, Write<sup><xref rid="fn1887">9</xref></sup> a bill of divorce,<sup><xref rid="fn1888">1</xref></sup> and send away this handmaid and her son from me and from Isaac my son, in this world and from the world to come. More than all the misfortunes which overtook Abraham, this matter was exceedingly evil in his eyes, as it is said, &#x201C;And the thing was very grievous in Abraham&#x2019;s sight on account of his son&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 11).<sup><xref rid="fn1889">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah<sup><xref rid="fn1890">3</xref></sup> said: In that night the Holy One, blessed be He, was revealed unto him. He said to him: Abraham &#x0021; Dost thou not know that Sarah was appointed to thee for a wife<sup><xref rid="fn1891">4</xref></sup> from her mother&#x2019;s womb? She is thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant;<sup><xref rid="fn1892">5</xref></sup> Sarah is not called thy handmaid, but thy wife;<sup><xref rid="fn1893">6</xref></sup> neither is Hagar called thy wife, but thy handmaid; and all that Sarah has spoken<sup><xref rid="fn1894">7</xref></sup> she has uttered truthfully. Let it not be grievous in thine eyes, as it is said, &#x201C;And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 12).</p>
<p>Abraham rose up early,<sup><xref rid="fn1895">8</xref></sup> and wrote a bill of divorce, and gave it to Hagar, and he sent her and her son away from himself, and from Isaac his son, from this world and from the world to come, as it is said, &#x201C;And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took<sup><xref rid="fn1896">9</xref></sup> bread and a bottle of water&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 14). He sent her away &#x007C;&#x007C; with a bill of divorcement, and he took the veil,<sup><xref rid="fn1897">10</xref></sup> and he bound it around her waist, so that it should drag behind her to disclose (the fact) that she was a bondwoman.<sup><xref rid="fn1898">11</xref></sup> Not only this, but also because Abraham desired to see Ishmael, his son, and to see the way whereon they went.</p>
<p>By the merit of our father Abraham the water did not fail in the bottle, but when she reached the entrance to the wilderness, she began to go astray after the idolatry of her father&#x2019;s house;<sup><xref rid="fn1899">1</xref></sup> and forthwith the water in the bottle was spent, as it is said, &#x201C;And she departed and wandered&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>), Ishmael was seventeen<sup><xref rid="fn1900">2</xref></sup> years old (when) he went forth from the house of Abraham, and Isaac was forty<sup><xref rid="fn1901">3</xref></sup> years old. By the merit of our father Abraham the water did not fail in the bottle, but when she reached the entrance to the wilderness, she began to go astray after the idolatry of her father&#x2019;s house; the water in the bottle was spent,<sup><xref rid="fn1902">4</xref></sup> and the soul of Ishmael was faint with thirst.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And she departed and wandered&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). The meaning of &#x201C;and she wandered&#x201D; is merely idolatry, because it is written, concerning (this root),<sup><xref rid="fn1903">5</xref></sup> &#x201C;They are vanity, a work of delusion&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1904">6</xref></sup> (Jer. x. 15).<sup><xref rid="fn1905">7</xref></sup> He went and cast himself beneath the thorns of the wilderness,<sup><xref rid="fn1906">8</xref></sup> so that the moisture might be upon him, and he said: O God of my father Abraham &#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn1907">9</xref></sup> Thine are the issues of death; take away from me my soul, for I would not die of thirst. And He was entreated of him, as it is said, &#x201C;For God hath heard the &#x007C;&#x007C; voice of the lad where he is&#x201D; (Gen. xxi. 17). The well<sup><xref rid="fn1908">1</xref></sup> which was created at twilight<sup><xref rid="fn1909">2</xref></sup> was opened for them there, and they went and drank and filled the bottle with water, as it is said, &#x201C;And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 19). And there<sup><xref rid="fn1910">3</xref></sup> they left the well,<sup><xref rid="fn1911">4</xref></sup> and thence they started on their way,<sup><xref rid="fn1912">5</xref></sup> and went through all the wilderness until they came to the wilderness of Paran, and they found there streams of water, and they dwelt there, as it is said, &#x201C;And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 21). Ishmael sent for a wife from among the daughters<sup><xref rid="fn1913">6</xref></sup> of Moab, and &#x2018;Ayeshah<sup><xref rid="fn1914">7</xref></sup> was her name. After three years<sup><xref rid="fn1915">8</xref></sup> Abraham went to see Ishmael his son, having sworn to Sarah that he would not descend from the camel in the place where Ishmael dwelt. He arrived there at midday and found there the wife of Ishmael. He said<sup><xref rid="fn1916">9</xref></sup> to her: Where is Ishmael? She said to him: He has gone with his mother to fetch the fruit of the palms<sup><xref rid="fn1917">10</xref></sup> from the wilderness. He said to her: Give me a little bread and a little water,<sup><xref rid="fn1918">11</xref></sup> for my soul is faint after the journey in the desert. She said to him: I have neither bread nor water. He said to her: When Ishmael comes (home) tell him this &#x007C;&#x007C; story, and say to him: A certain old man came from the land of Canaan to see thee, and he said, Exchange<sup><xref rid="fn1919">12</xref></sup> the threshold of thy house, for it is not good for thee. When Ishmael came (home) his wife told him the story. A son of a wise man is like half a wise man. Ishmael understood. His mother sent and took for him a wife from her father&#x2019;s house,<sup><xref rid="fn1920">1</xref></sup> and her name was Fatimah.<sup><xref rid="fn1921">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Again after three years Abraham went to see his son Ishmael, having sworn to Sarah as on the first occasion that he would not descend from the camel in the place where Ishmael dwelt. He came there at midday, and found there Ishmael&#x2019;s wife. He said to her: Where is Ishmael? She replied to him: He has gone with his mother to feed the camels in the desert. He said to her: Give me a little bread and water, for my soul is faint after the journey<sup><xref rid="fn1922">3</xref></sup> of the desert. She fetched it and gave it to him. Abraham arose and prayed before the Holy One, blessed be He, for his son, and (thereupon) Ishmael&#x2019;s house was filled with all good things of the various blessings.<sup><xref rid="fn1923">4</xref></sup> When Ishmael came (home) his wife told him what had happened, and Ishmael knew that his father&#x2019;s love was still extended to him, as it is said, &#x007C;&#x007C; &#x201C;Like as a father pitieth his sons&#x201D; (Ps. ciii. 13). After the death of Sarah, Abraham again took (Hagar) his divorced (wife), as it is said, &#x201C;And Abraham again<sup><xref rid="fn1924">5</xref></sup> took a wife, and her name was Keturah&#x201D; (Gen. xxv. 1). Why does it say &#x201C;And he <italic>again</italic>&#x201D;? Because on the first occasion she was his wife, and he <italic>again</italic> betook himself to her. Her name was Keturah, because she was perfumed with all kinds of scents.<sup><xref rid="fn1925">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another explanation of Keturah (is): because her actions were beautiful like <italic>incense</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1926">1</xref></sup> and she bare him six sons,<sup><xref rid="fn1927">2</xref></sup> and they were all called according to the name of Ishmael,<sup><xref rid="fn1928">3</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And she bare him Zimran (<italic>ibid.</italic> 2).</p>
<p>Like a woman sent away from her husband, so likewise Abraham arose and sent them away from Isaac his son, from this world and from the world to come, as it is said, &#x201C;But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had,<sup><xref rid="fn1929">4</xref></sup> Abraham gave gifts, and he sent them<sup><xref rid="fn1930">5</xref></sup> away from Isaac his son&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 6), by a deed of divorcement.</p>
<p>Corresponding to the name of Ishmael&#x2019;s son<sup><xref rid="fn1931">6</xref></sup> Kedar, the <italic>sons of Kedar</italic> were so called, as it is said, &#x201C;Of Kedar, and of the kingdoms of Hazor&#x201D; (Jer. xlix. 28). Corresponding to the name of Ishmael&#x2019;s son &#x201C;Kedemah&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1932">7</xref></sup> (Gen. xxv. 15), the &#x201C;sons of &#x1E32;edem&#x201D; were so called.<sup><xref rid="fn1933">8</xref></sup> Because they dwelt in the territory belonging to Cain, his children were called &#x201C;sons of Cain,&#x201D; as it is said, &#x201C;Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from Cain&#x201D; (Judg. iv. 11). Were not all the sons of Cain cut off<sup><xref rid="fn1934">9</xref></sup> by the waters of the Flood? But because they dwelt in the territory of the children of Cain, his children were called &#x201C;sons of Cain,&#x201D; as it is said, &#x201C;Nevertheless &#x007C;&#x007C; Cain shall be wasted,<sup><xref rid="fn1935">10</xref></sup> as long as Asshur shall dwell in thy place&#x201D; (Num. xxiv. 22). &#x201C;Nevertheless Cain shall be wasted away&#x201D; by fire, through the seed of Ishmael, the latter shall cause the kingdom of Assyria to cease.<sup><xref rid="fn1936">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Balaam said: Of the seventy nations that the Holy One, blessed be He, created in His world, He did not put His name on any one of them except on Isra<italic>el</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn1937">2</xref></sup> and since the Holy One, blessed be He, made the name of Ishma<italic>el</italic> similar to the name of Isra<italic>el</italic>, woe to him who shall live in his days, as it is said, &#x201C;Alas, who shall live when God establisheth him?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1938">3</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic> 23).</p>
<p>Rabbi Ishmael said: In the future the children of Ishmael will do fifteen things in the land (of Israel) in the latter days, and they are: They will measure the land with ropes;<sup><xref rid="fn1939">4</xref></sup> they will change a cemetery into a resting-place for sheep (and) a dunghill; they will measure with them and from them upon the tops of the mountains; falsehood will multiply and truth will be hidden; the statutes will be removed far from Israel; sins will be multiplied in Israel; worm-crimson will be in the wool, and he will cover<sup><xref rid="fn1940">5</xref></sup> with insects paper and pen; he will hew down the rock of the kingdom,<sup><xref rid="fn1941">6</xref></sup> and they will rebuild the desolated cities and sweep the ways; and they will plant gardens and parks, and fence in the broken walls of the Temple; and they will build a building in the Holy Place; and two brothers will arise over them,<sup><xref rid="fn1942">7</xref></sup> princes at the end; and in their days the Branch, the Son of David, will arise, as it is said, &#x007C;&#x007C; &#x201C;And in the days of those kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed&#x201D; (Dan. ii. 44).</p>
<p>Rabbi Ishmael also said: Three wars of trouble<sup><xref rid="fn1943">1</xref></sup> will the sons of Ishmael in the future wage on the earth in the latter days, as it is said, &#x201C;For they fled away from the swords&#x201D; (Isa. xxi. 15). &#x201C;Swords&#x201D; signify only wars, one in the forest of Arabia, as it is said, &#x201C;From the drawn sword&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>); another on the sea, as it is said, &#x201C;From the bent bow&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>); and one in the great city which is in Rome,<sup><xref rid="fn1944">2</xref></sup> which will be more grievous than the other two, as it is said, &#x201C;And from the grievousness of the war&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). From there the Son of David shall flourish and see the destruction of<sup><xref rid="fn1945">3</xref></sup> <italic>these and these</italic>, and thence will He come to the land of Israel, as it is said, &#x201C;Who is this that cometh from Edom,<sup><xref rid="fn1946">4</xref></sup> with crimsoned garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, marching in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save&#x201D; (<italic>ibid</italic>, lxiii. 1).</p>

(God) answered him:	In every place where thou dost see My glory abiding and waiting for thee there, and saying,<sup><xref rid="fn1959">6</xref></sup> This is Mount Moriah;<sup><xref rid="fn1960">7</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Upon one of the mountains which <italic>I will tell thee</italic> of&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn1961">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Abraham rose up early in the morning, and he took with him Ishmael, and Eliezer, and Isaac his son, and he saddled the ass. Upon this ass did Abraham ride. This was the ass, the offspring of that ass which was created during the twilight,<sup><xref rid="fn1962">9</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 8).<sup><xref rid="fn1963">10</xref></sup> The same ass was also ridden upon by Moses when he came to Egypt, as it is said, &#x201C;And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon <italic>the</italic> ass&#x201D; (Ex. iv. 20). This &#x007C;&#x007C; same ass will be ridden upon in the future by the Son of David,<sup><xref rid="fn1964">1</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy king cometh unto thee: he is just, and saved;<sup><xref rid="fn1965">2</xref></sup> lowly, and riding upon an <italic>ass</italic>, even upon a colt, the foal of an ass&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn1966">3</xref></sup> (Zech. ix. 9).</p>
<p>Isaac was thirty-seven years old<sup><xref rid="fn1967">4</xref></sup> when he went to Mount Moriah, and Ishmael was fifty years old. Contention arose between Eliezer and Ishmael. Ishmael said to Eliezer: Now that Abraham will offer Isaac his son for a burnt offering, kindled upon the altar,<sup><xref rid="fn1968">5</xref></sup> and I am his first-born son, I will inherit (the possessions of) Abraham. Eliezer replied to him, saying: He has already driven thee out like a woman divorced from her husband, and he has sent thee<sup><xref rid="fn1969">6</xref></sup> away to the wilderness, but I am his servant, serving him by day and by night, and I shall be the heir of Abraham. The Holy Spirit answered them, saying to them: Neither this one nor that one shall inherit.<sup><xref rid="fn1970">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the third day they reached Zophim,<sup><xref rid="fn1971">8</xref></sup> and when they reached Zophim they saw the glory of the Shekhinah<sup><xref rid="fn1972">9</xref></sup> resting upon the top of the mountain, as it is said, &#x201C;On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw <italic>the place</italic> afar off&#x201D; (Gen. xxii. 4). What did he see? (He saw) a pillar of fire standing from the earth to the heavens.<sup><xref rid="fn1973">1</xref></sup> Abraham understood that the lad had been accepted for the perfect burnt offering. He said to Ishmael and Eliezer: Do ye see anything upon one of those mountains? &#x007C;&#x007C; They said to him: No. He considered them (as dull) as an ass. He told them: Since ye do not see anything, &#x201C;Abide ye here with the ass&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 5),<sup><xref rid="fn1974">2</xref></sup> with such who are similar to the ass.<sup><xref rid="fn1975">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>He took the wood and placed it upon the back of his son Isaac, and he took the fire and the knife in his hand, and they went both of them together.<sup><xref rid="fn1976">4</xref></sup> Isaac said to his father: O my father &#x0021; Behold the fire and the wood, where is the lamb for the burnt offering? He replied to him: My son &#x0021; Thou art the lamb for the burnt offering, as it is said, &#x201C;And Abraham said, God will provide<sup><xref rid="fn1977">5</xref></sup> for himself the lamb&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 8).</p>
<p>Rabbi Simeon<sup><xref rid="fn1978">6</xref></sup> said: The Holy One, blessed be He, pointed out<sup><xref rid="fn1979">1</xref></sup> the altar with a finger to Abraham our father, and said to him: This is the altar. That was the altar<sup><xref rid="fn1980">2</xref></sup> whereon Cain and Abel sacrificed; it was the same altar whereon Noah<sup><xref rid="fn1981">3</xref></sup> and his sons sacrificed, as it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn1982">4</xref></sup> &#x201C;And Abraham built <italic>the</italic> altar there&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 9). &#x201C;And Abraham built an altar there&#x201D; is not written here, but &#x201C;And Abraham built <italic>the</italic> altar there.&#x201D; That was the altar whereon the first ones (of old) had sacrificed.<sup><xref rid="fn1983">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Isaac said to his father Abraham: O my father &#x0021; Bind for me my two hands, and my two feet, so that I do not curse<sup><xref rid="fn1984">6</xref></sup> thee; for instance, a word may issue from the mouth because of the violence and dread of death, and I shall be found to have slighted &#x007C;&#x007C; the precept, &#x201C;Honour thy father&#x201D; (Ex. xx. 12).<sup><xref rid="fn1985">7</xref></sup> He bound his two hands and his two feet, and bound him upon the top of the altar, and he strengthened his two arms and his two knees<sup><xref rid="fn1986">8</xref></sup> upon him, and put the fire and wood in order, and he stretched forth his hand and took the knife. Like a high priest<sup><xref rid="fn1987">9</xref></sup> he brought near his meal offering, and his drink offering;<sup><xref rid="fn1988">10</xref></sup> and the Holy One, blessed be He, was sitting and beholding the father binding with all (his) heart and the son bound with all (his) heart. And the ministering angels<sup><xref rid="fn1989">11</xref></sup> cried aloud and wept, as it is said, &#x201C;Behold, the Erelim<sup><xref rid="fn1990">1</xref></sup> cry<sup><xref rid="fn1991">2</xref></sup> without; the angels of peace weep bitterly&#x201D; (Isa. xxxiii. 7). The ministering angels said before the Holy One, blessed be He: Sovereign of all the worlds &#x0021; Thou art called merciful and compassionate, whose mercy is upon all His works;<sup><xref rid="fn1992">3</xref></sup> have mercy upon Isaac, for he is a human being, and the son of a human being, and is bound before Thee like an animal. &#x201C;O Lord, Thou preservest man and beast&#x201D;; as it is said, &#x201C;Thy righteousness is like the mighty mountains;<sup><xref rid="fn1991">2</xref></sup> thy judgments are like a great deep: O Lord, thou preservest man and beast&#x201D; (Ps. xxxvi. 6).</p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah said: When the blade<sup><xref rid="fn1993">4</xref></sup> touched his neck, the soul of Isaac fled and departed, (but) when he heard His voice from between the two Cherubim,<sup><xref rid="fn1994">5</xref></sup> saying (to Abraham), &#x201C;Lay not thine hand upon the lad&#x201D; (Gen. xxii. 12), his soul returned to his body, and (Abraham) set him free, and Isaac stood upon his feet. And Isaac knew<sup><xref rid="fn1995">6</xref></sup> that in this manner the dead in the future will be quickened. He opened (his mouth), and said:	Blessed art thou, O Lord, who quickeneth the dead.<sup><xref rid="fn1996">7</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C;</p>
<p>Rabbi Zechariah said: That ram, which was created at the twilight,<sup><xref rid="fn1997">8</xref></sup> ran and came to be offered up instead of Isaac, but Sammael<sup><xref rid="fn1998">9</xref></sup> was standing by, and distracting it, in order to annul the offering of our father Abraham. And it was caught by its two horns in the trees, as it is said, &#x201C;And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught in the thicket by its horns&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 13). What did that ram do? It put forth its leg and took hold of the coat of our father Abraham, and Abraham looked, saw the ram, and he went and set it free. He offered it up instead of Isaac his son, as it is said, &#x201C;And Abraham went and took the ram,<sup><xref rid="fn1999">1</xref></sup> and offered it up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>Rabbi Berachiah said: The sweet savour (of the ram) ascended before the Holy One, blessed be He, as though it were the sweet savour of Isaac,<sup><xref rid="fn2000">2</xref></sup> and He swore that He would bless him<sup><xref rid="fn2001">3</xref></sup> in this world and in the world to come, as it is said, &#x201C;By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, because thou hast done this thing&#x201D;; and it says, &#x201C;That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed, as the stars of the heaven&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 16, 17). &#x201C;That in blessing&#x201D; (refers) to this world; &#x201C;I will bless thee,&#x201D; in the world to come; and &#x201C;I will greatly multiply thy seed,&#x201D; in the future that is to come.</p>
<p>Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa said:<sup><xref rid="fn2002">4</xref></sup> From that ram, which was created at the twilight, nothing came forth which was useless.<sup><xref rid="fn2003">5</xref></sup> The ashes of the ram<sup><xref rid="fn2004">6</xref></sup> were &#x007C;&#x007C; the base<sup><xref rid="fn2005">7</xref></sup> which was upon the top of the inner altar.<sup><xref rid="fn2006">8</xref></sup> The sinews of the ram were the strings<sup><xref rid="fn2007">9</xref></sup> of the harp whereon David played. The ram&#x2019;s skin<sup><xref rid="fn2008">10</xref></sup> was the girdle (around) the loins of Elijah, may he be remembered for good, as it is said, &#x201C;And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins&#x201D; (2 Kings i. 8).<sup><xref rid="fn2009">1</xref></sup> The horn<sup><xref rid="fn2010">2</xref></sup> of the ram of the left side<sup><xref rid="fn2011">3</xref></sup> (was the one) wherein He blew upon Mount Sinai, as it is said, &#x201C;And it shall come to pass, that when the ram&#x2019;s horn soundeth long&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2012">4</xref></sup> (Josh. vi. 5). (The horn) of the right side, which is larger than that of the left, is destined in the future to be sounded in the world that is to come,<sup><xref rid="fn2013">5</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great trumpet shall be blown&#x201D; (Isa. xxvii. 13);<sup><xref rid="fn2014">6</xref></sup> and it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord shall be king over all the earth&#x201D; (Zech. xiv. 9).</p>
<p>Rabbi Isaac said: Nothing has been created except by the merit of worship.

<ftnote id="fn1972"><sup>9</sup> This passage is of considerable interest. We are in the domain of Philonic interpretation of the Bible. Thus Clement of Alexandria, under the influence of Philo&#x2019;s allegorical interpretation, says on the text, Gen. xxii. 3, 4: &#x201C;Abraham, when he came to the place which God told him of on the third day, looking up, saw the place afar off. For the first day is that which is constituted by the sight of good things; and the second is the soul&#x2019;s best desire; on the third, the mind perceives spiritual things&#x201D; (<italic>Strom.</italic> v. 11).</ftnote>
<p>Our book identifies the place (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05E7;&#x05D5;&#x05DD;</span>) with the Shekhinah, just as Philo does (<italic>De Somniis</italic>, i. M. i. 638, C.W. iii. p. 213); see Gen. Rab. lvi. 1 f.; and cf. the valuable note in Weinstein&#x2019;s <italic>Zur Genesis der Agada</italic>, p. 88. The representation of the Shekhinah as a &#x201C;Pillar of Fire&#x201D; corresponds with Philo&#x2019;s identification of the Logos with the &#x201C;Pillar of Cloud,&#x201D; which at night became the &#x201C;Pillar of Fire&#x201D; in the wilderness, leading God&#x2019;s people to the Holy Land; see <italic>Hellenism and Christianity</italic>, p. 25, note. According to Jubilees xviii. 4: &#x201C;And he came to a <italic>well of water</italic> and he said to his young men, &#x2018; Abide ye here with the ass.&#x2019;&#x201D; Does our author intentionally vary this by substituting the &#x201C;cloud&#x201D; for the well?</p>

<title>CHAPTER XXXII</title>
<h1><small>THE DEATH OF SARAH AND THE STORY OF ISAAC AND REBECCA</small> [39<small>B</small>. i.]</h1>
<p>S<small>IX</small> (people) were called by their names before they were created,<sup><xref rid="fn2017">1</xref></sup> and they are: Isaac, Ishmael, Moses,<sup><xref rid="fn2018">2</xref></sup> Solomon, Josiah, and King Messiah.<sup><xref rid="fn2019">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Whence do we know about Ishmael? Because it is said, &#x201C;And the angel of the Lord said unto her, Behold, thou art with child,<sup><xref rid="fn2020">4</xref></sup>&#x2026; and thou shalt call his name Ishmael&#x201D; (Gen. xvi. 11). Why was his name &#x007C;&#x007C; called Ishmael?<sup><xref rid="fn2021">5</xref></sup> Because in the future the Holy One, blessed be He, will <italic>hearken</italic> to the cry<sup><xref rid="fn2022">6</xref></sup> of the people arising from (the oppression) which the children of Ishmael will bring about in the land in the last (days);<sup><xref rid="fn2023">7</xref></sup> therefore was his name called Ishmael.<sup><xref rid="fn2024">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>How do we know (this with reference to) Isaac? Because it is said, &#x201C;And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xvii. 19). Why was his name called Isaac?<sup><xref rid="fn2025">1</xref></sup> Because Yad (the first Hebrew letter of Isaac indicates) the <italic>ten</italic> trials<sup><xref rid="fn2026">2</xref></sup> wherewith our father Abraham was tried; and he withstood them all. Zaddi (the second letter indicates) the <italic>ninety</italic> (years), for his mother was ninety years (at the birth of Isaac), as it is said, &#x201C;And shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 17). Cheth (the third letter points to) the <italic>eighth</italic> (day), for he was circumcised on the eighth day, as it is said, &#x201C;And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac, being eight days old&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxi. 4). &#x1E32;uf (the fourth letter of the name marks) the <italic>hundred</italic> (years), for his father was an hundred years old (at Isaac&#x2019;s birth), as it is said, &#x201C;And Abraham was an hundred years old&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 5).</p>
<p>Whence do we know about Moses?<sup><xref rid="fn2027">3</xref></sup> Because it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord said, My spirit shall not abide in man for ever in their going astray&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> vi. 3). What is the implication (of the expression), &#x201C;In their going astray&#x201D;?<sup><xref rid="fn2028">4</xref></sup> Retrospectively his name was called Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn2029">5</xref></sup> For the life of Moses was one hundred and twenty years, as it is said, &#x201C;His days shall be an hundred and twenty years&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>Whence do we know concerning Solomon? Because it is said, &#x201C;Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest,&#x2026; for his name shall be <italic>Solomon</italic>&#x201D; (1 Chron. xxii. 9).<sup><xref rid="fn2030">1</xref></sup> Why was his name called Solomon? Because his name was called Solomon in the Aramaic language, as it is said, &#x201C;I will give <italic>peace</italic> (Shalom) and quietness unto Israel in his days&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2031">2</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C;</p>
<p>Whence do we know about Josiah? Because it is said, &#x201C;Behold, a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name&#x201D; (1 Kings xiii. 2). Why was his name called Josiah? (Because he was as acceptable)<sup><xref rid="fn2032">3</xref></sup> as an offering upon the altar; she<sup><xref rid="fn2033">4</xref></sup> said: A worthy offering let him be before Thee.<sup><xref rid="fn2034">5</xref></sup> Therefore was his name called Josiah, as it is said, &#x201C;And he cried against the altar,&#x201D; etc. (<italic>ibid.</italic> 2).</p>
<p>Whence do we know concerning King Messiah? Because it is said, &#x201C;His name shall endure for ever. Before the sun his name shall be continued (Yinnon)&#x201D; (Ps. lxxii. 17).<sup><xref rid="fn2035">6</xref></sup> Why was his name called Yinnon? For he will <italic>awaken</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2036">7</xref></sup> those who sleep at Hebron out of the dust of the earth, therefore is his name called Yinnon, as it is said, &#x201C;Before the sun his name is Yinnon&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>When Abraham returned from Mount Moriah in peace, the anger of Sammael<sup><xref rid="fn2037">8</xref></sup> was kindled, for he saw that the desire of his heart to frustrate the offering of our father Abraham had not been realized. What did he do? He went and said to Sarah: Hast thou not heard what has happened in the world? She said to him: No. He said to her: Thy husband, Abraham,<sup><xref rid="fn2038">1</xref></sup> has taken thy son Isaac and slain him and offered him up as a burnt offering upon the altar.<sup><xref rid="fn2039">2</xref></sup> She began to weep and to cry aloud three times,<sup><xref rid="fn2040">3</xref></sup> corresponding to the three sustained notes (of the Shophar),<sup><xref rid="fn2041">4</xref></sup> and (she gave forth) three howlings corresponding to the three disconnected short notes<sup><xref rid="fn2042">5</xref></sup> (of the Shophar), and her soul fled, and she died.<sup><xref rid="fn2043">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Abraham came and found that she was dead. Whence did he come? From Mount Moriah,<sup><xref rid="fn2044">7</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah&#x201D; (Gen. xxiii. 2).</p>
<p>Rabbi Jos&#x00E9; said: Isaac observed mourning during three years<sup><xref rid="fn2045">8</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C; for his mother. After three years he married Rebecca, and forgot the mourning for his mother.<sup><xref rid="fn2046">9</xref></sup> Hence thou mayest learn that until a man marries a wife his love centres in his parents. When he marries a wife his love is bestowed upon his wife, as it is said, &#x201C;Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and he shall cleave unto his wife&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> ii. 24). Does a man then <italic>leave</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2047">10</xref></sup> his father and mother with reference to the precept, &#x201C;Honour&#x201D;?<sup><xref rid="fn2048">11</xref></sup> But the love of his soul cleaves unto his wife, as it is said, &#x201C;And his soul clave (unto Dinah)&#x201D; (<italic>ibid</italic>, xxxiv. 3); and it says, &#x201C;And he shall cleave unto his wife&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> ii. 24).</p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah said: Rebecca<sup><xref rid="fn2049">1</xref></sup> was barren for twenty years. After twenty years (Isaac) took Rebecca and went (with her) to Mount Moriah, to the place where he had been bound, and he prayed on her behalf concerning the conception of the womb; and the Holy One, blessed be He, was entreated of him,<sup><xref rid="fn2050">2</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And Isaac intreated the Lord&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxv. 21). The children were contending with one another<sup><xref rid="fn2051">3</xref></sup> within her womb like mighty warriors, as it is said, &#x201C;And the children struggled together within her&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 22). The time of her confinement came round, and her soul was nigh unto death owing to her pains.<sup><xref rid="fn2052">4</xref></sup> And she went to pray in the place<sup><xref rid="fn2053">5</xref></sup> whither she and Isaac had gone, as it is said, &#x201C;And she went to inquire of the Lord&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). What did the Holy One, blessed be He,<sup><xref rid="fn2054">6</xref></sup> do? Jacob took hold of the heels of Esau to make him fall, as it is said, &#x201C;And after that came forth his brother, and his hand had hold on Esau&#x2019;s heel&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 26). Hence thou mayest learn that the descendants of Esau will not fall until a remnant &#x007C;&#x007C; from Jacob will come and cut off the feet of the children of Esau from the mountain of Seir, as it is said, &#x201C;Forasmuch as thou sawest that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands&#x201D; (Dan. ii. 45).<sup><xref rid="fn2055">7</xref></sup> Another Scripture text says, &#x201C;Vengeance is mine, and a recompence,<sup><xref rid="fn2056">8</xref></sup> at the time when their <italic>foot</italic> shall slide&#x201D; (Deut. xxxii. 35).</p>
<p>Rabbi Tanchuma<sup><xref rid="fn2057">9</xref></sup> said: The two lads grew up; the one went by the way of life, and the other went by the way of death,<sup><xref rid="fn2058">10</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And the boys grew, and Esau was a cunning hunter&#x201D; (Gen. xxv. 27). Jacob went on the way of life, for he was dwelling in tents,<sup><xref rid="fn2059">1</xref></sup> and he studied the Torah all his days.<sup><xref rid="fn2060">2</xref></sup> Esau went on the way of death, because he slew Nimrod and his son Chavir, and he almost sought to kill Jacob his brother, as it is said, &#x201C;The days of mourning for my father are at hand, and I will slay my brother Jacob&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxvii. 41).</p>
<p>Rabbi Simeon said: In the hour when Isaac was bound, he lifted up his eyes heavenwards and saw the glory of the Shekhinah, as it is written, &#x201C;For man shall not see me and live&#x201D; (Ex. xxxiii. 20). Instead of death his eyes grew dim<sup><xref rid="fn2061">3</xref></sup> in his old age, as it is said, &#x201C;And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, that his eyes were dim, so that he could not see&#x201D; (Gen. xxvii. 1). Hence thou mayest learn that the blind man is as though he were dead.<sup><xref rid="fn2062">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The night-fall of the festival day of Passover came,<sup><xref rid="fn2063">5</xref></sup> and Isaac called unto Esau his elder son, and said: O my son &#x0021; To-night the heavenly ones<sup><xref rid="fn2064">6</xref></sup> utter songs,<sup><xref rid="fn2065">7</xref></sup> on this night the treasuries<sup><xref rid="fn2066">8</xref></sup> of dew<sup><xref rid="fn2067">9</xref></sup> are opened; on this day the blessing of the dews (is bestowed). Make me savoury meat whilst I am still alive, and I will bless thee. &#x007C;&#x007C; The Holy Spirit rejoined, saying to him: &#x201C;Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye,<sup><xref rid="fn2068">10</xref></sup> neither desire thou his dainties&#x201D; (Prov. xxiii. 6). He went to fetch it, and was delayed there.<sup><xref rid="fn2069">11</xref></sup> Rebecca said to Jacob his (other) son:<sup><xref rid="fn2070">12</xref></sup> On this night the treasuries of dew will be opened, and on this night the angels utter a song.<sup><xref rid="fn2071">1</xref></sup> Make savoury meat for thy father, that he may eat and whilst he still lives he may bless thee.</p>
<p>Now (Jacob) was skilled in the Torah,<sup><xref rid="fn2072">2</xref></sup> and his heart dreaded the curse of his father. His mother said to him: My son &#x0021; If it be a blessing, may it be upon thee and upon thy seed; if it be a curse, let it be upon me<sup><xref rid="fn2073">3</xref></sup> and upon my soul, as it is said, &#x201C;And his mother said to him, Upon me be thy curse, my son&#x201D; (Gen. xxvii. 13). He went and brought two kids of the goats. Were two kids of the goats the food for Isaac? But he brought one as a Paschal offering,<sup><xref rid="fn2074">4</xref></sup> and with the other he prepared the savoury meat to eat; and he brought it to his father,<sup><xref rid="fn2075">5</xref></sup> and he said to him: &#x201C;Arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 19).<sup><xref rid="fn2076">6</xref></sup> Isaac said: &#x201C;The voice is the voice of Jacob&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 22). Jacob (declares) the unity of God. &#x201C;The voice is the voice of Jacob&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2077">7</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic>) in the meditation of the Torah. &#x201C;And the hands are the hands of Esau&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>), in all shedding of blood and in every evil death. Not only this, but also when they proclaim in heaven, &#x201C;The voice is the voice of Jacob,&#x201D; the heavens tremble.<sup><xref rid="fn2078">8</xref></sup> And when they proclaim on earth, &#x201C;The voice is the voice of Jacob&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>), every one who hears will make his portion with &#x201C;The voice which is the voice of Jacob.&#x201D; And every one &#x007C;&#x007C; who does not hear and does not act (obediently), his portion is with &#x201C;The hands, which are the hands of Esau.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah said: Isaac blessed Jacob with ten blessings concerning the dews of heaven and the corn of the earth, corresponding to the ten words<sup><xref rid="fn2079">1</xref></sup> whereby the world was created, as it is said, &#x201C;And God give thee of the dew of the heaven&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 28); &#x201C;Let peoples serve thee, &#x2026;&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 29). When Jacob went forth from the presence of his father Isaac, he went forth crowned like a bridegroom, and like a bride in her adornment,<sup><xref rid="fn2080">2</xref></sup> and the quickening dew from heaven descended upon him, and refreshed his bones,<sup><xref rid="fn2081">3</xref></sup> and he also became a mighty hero; therefore it is said, &#x201C;By the hands of the mighty Jacob, from thence is the shepherd, the stone<sup><xref rid="fn2082">4</xref></sup> of Israel&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xlix. 24).</p>
<ftnote id="fn2017"><sup>1</sup> In Mekhilta, B&#x00F4;, xvi. p. 19a; only Isaac, Solomon, and Josiah are mentioned. See Agadath Bereshith, 65, and Midrash Haggadol, c. 246. In T. J. Berakhoth i. 8 four names are mentioned, the three as in the Mekhilta and, in addition, Ishmael; cf. Gen. Rab. xlv. 8. In T.B. Chullin, 139b, the name of Moses is mentioned, as also the names of Mordecai, Esther, and Haman, all these names being hinted at in the Torah. Luria observes that Cyrus (Is. xliv. 28 and xlv. 1) should have been mentioned in the list of people named before their birth. This fact would not warrant the inference that all these people were pre-existent. This reasoning is, however, often applied to the name of the Messiah, as though it meant that the Messiah pre-existed because his name was named before his birth; see <italic>Hellenism and Christianity</italic>, p. 17.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER XXXIII</title>
<h1><small>ELISHA AND THE SHUNAMMITE WOMAN</small><sup><xref rid="fn2084">1</xref></sup> [41<small>A</small>. i.]</h1>
<p>&#x201C;A<small>ND</small><sup><xref rid="fn2085">2</xref></sup> Isaac sowed in that land&#x201D; (Gen. xxvi. <bold>12</bold>). Rabbi Eliezer said: Did Isaac sow the seed of corn?<sup><xref rid="fn2086">3</xref></sup> Heaven forbid &#x0021; But he took all his wealth,<sup><xref rid="fn2087">4</xref></sup> and sowed it in charity to the needy, as it is said, &#x201C;Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap according to love&#x201D; (Hos. x. 12).<sup><xref rid="fn2088">5</xref></sup> Everything which he tithed, the Holy One, blessed be He, sent him (in return) one hundred times (the value) in different kinds of blessings, as it is said, &#x201C;And he found in the same year an hundredfold: and the Lord blessed him&#x201D; (Gen. xxvi. 12).</p>
<p>Rabbi Simeon said: Owing to the power of &#x007C;&#x007C; charity the dead will be quickened<sup><xref rid="fn2089">6</xref></sup> in the future. Whence do we learn this? From Elijah the Tishbite.<sup><xref rid="fn2090">7</xref></sup> For he betook himself to Zarephath, and a woman (who was) a widow received him with great honour.<sup><xref rid="fn2091">1</xref></sup> She was the mother of Jonah,<sup><xref rid="fn2092">2</xref></sup> and they were eating and drinking<sup><xref rid="fn2093">3</xref></sup> his<sup><xref rid="fn2094">4</xref></sup> bread and oil; he, she, and her son, as it is said, &#x201C;And she did eat, and he also&#x201D; (1 Kings xvii. 15).<sup><xref rid="fn2095">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;He and she&#x201D; (indicate that it was) by the merit of Elijah that they had to eat. After (a period of) days, the son of the woman fell sick and died,<sup><xref rid="fn2096">6</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And it came to pass after these things that the son of the woman fell sick&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 17). The woman said to him (Elijah): Thou didst come unto me<sup><xref rid="fn2097">7</xref></sup> for coition, and thou wilt bring my sin to remembrance against me, and my son is dead. Now take away all that which thou hast brought<sup><xref rid="fn2098">8</xref></sup> to me, and give me my son. Elijah, may he be remembered for good, arose and prayed before the Holy One, blessed be He, and said before Him: Sovereign of all the worlds &#x0021; Is it not enough (to endure) all the evils which have befallen me,<sup><xref rid="fn2099">9</xref></sup> but also this woman; for I know<sup><xref rid="fn2100">10</xref></sup> that out of sorrow for her son has she spoken of a matter which has not occurred, which she has brought against me to vex me.<sup><xref rid="fn2101">11</xref></sup> Now let all the generations learn<sup><xref rid="fn2102">12</xref></sup> that there is a resurrection of the dead, and restore the soul of this lad within him; and He was entreated of him, as it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord hearkened unto the voice of Elijah&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 22). Another Scripture text says, &#x201C;And Elijah &#x007C;&#x007C; took the child&#x2026; See, thy son liveth&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 23).<sup><xref rid="fn2103">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua ben &#x1E32;orchah said: Art thou astonished at this?<sup><xref rid="fn2104">2</xref></sup> Do not be astonished, come and see, (learn) from Elisha, the son of Shaphat, for no woman was able to gaze at his face without dying; and he went from mount to mount, and from cave to cave, and he went to Shunem, and a great woman received him with great honour. She was a sister of Abishag,<sup><xref rid="fn2105">3</xref></sup> the Shunammite, the mother<sup><xref rid="fn2106">4</xref></sup> of Oded, the prophet, as it is said, &#x201C;And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem&#x201D; (2 Kings iv. 8), and the woman said to her husband: This man of God is (holy),<sup><xref rid="fn2107">5</xref></sup> no woman is able to gaze at his face without dying; but,<sup><xref rid="fn2108">6</xref></sup> &#x201C;Let us make, I pray thee, a little chamber on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a lampstand&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 10). And every time that he passes he can turn thither into the chamber,<sup><xref rid="fn2109">7</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 11). And he called for the Shunammite, as it is said, &#x201C;And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood at the door&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 15). Why did she stand at the door? Because she was unable to gaze at his face,<sup><xref rid="fn2110">8</xref></sup> so that she should not die. He said to her:</p>
<p>&#x201C;At this season, when the time cometh round, thou shalt embrace a son&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 16), the fruit of thy womb. She said to him: My lord is very old, and the way of women has departed from me, &#x007C;&#x007C; and it is impossible to do this thing.<sup><xref rid="fn2111">1</xref></sup> &#x201C;Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2112">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Zechariah said: &#x201C;He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him&#x201D; (Ps. cxlv. 19).<sup><xref rid="fn2113">3</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, fulfilled the desire of the prophet. She conceived and bare, and the child grew. He went forth to refresh<sup><xref rid="fn2114">4</xref></sup> himself, and to look at the reapers. A mishap overtook him,<sup><xref rid="fn2115">5</xref></sup> and he died, as it is said, &#x201C;It fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers&#x201D; (2 Kings iv. 18); this restrained them (from work) until he came (among them),<sup><xref rid="fn2116">6</xref></sup> and he died, as it is said, &#x201C;And he sat on her knees till noon, and then died&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 20).</p>
<p>The woman went to Mount Carmel, and fell on her face to the ground before Elisha, saying to him: Would that my vessel<sup><xref rid="fn2117">7</xref></sup> had remained empty &#x0021; But it was filled, and now its contents are spilt. The prophet answered: Everything which the Holy One, blessed be He, doeth, He telleth to me, but He has hidden this matter, as it is said, &#x201C;And when she came to the man of God<sup><xref rid="fn2118">8</xref></sup>&#x2026; and Gehazi came near to thrust her away&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2119">9</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic> 27). What is the meaning of &#x201C;to thrust her away&#x201D;? To teach us that he put his hand upon (her) pride, which was upon her breasts,<sup><xref rid="fn2120">10</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And the man of God said, Let her alone<sup><xref rid="fn2121">11</xref></sup>&#x2026; and the Lord hath hid it from me, and hath not told me&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). He took the staff which was in his hand, and gave it to Gehazi, saying to him: Do not speak with thy mouth any word at all; know that<sup><xref rid="fn2122">1</xref></sup> thou goest and placest the staff upon the face of the lad, that he may live.</p>
<p>Now as for Gehazi, the matter was laughable in his eyes,<sup><xref rid="fn2123">2</xref></sup> and to every man whom he met &#x007C;&#x007C; he said: Dost thou believe that this staff will bring the dead to life? Therefore he did not succeed<sup><xref rid="fn2124">3</xref></sup> until (Elisha) went on foot and put his face<sup><xref rid="fn2125">4</xref></sup> upon the face (of the child), and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands, and he began to pray before the Holy One, blessed be He: Sovereign of all the worlds &#x0021; Just as Thou didst perform miracles by the hand of Elijah, my master, and brought the dead to life, likewise let this child live; and He was entreated of him, as it is said, &#x201C;Then he returned, and walked in the house once to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 35); &#x201C;and the child sneezed seven times&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>Rabbi Azariah<sup><xref rid="fn2126">5</xref></sup> said: Know thou the efficacy of charity.<sup><xref rid="fn2127">6</xref></sup> Come and see from the instance of Shallum,<sup><xref rid="fn2128">7</xref></sup> son of Tikvah, who was one of the important men of his generation, giving charity every day. What did he do? He filled the bottle with water, and sat at the entrance of the city, and he would give water to every person who came on the way, restoring his soul to him.<sup><xref rid="fn2129">8</xref></sup> On account of the charity which he did, the Holy Spirit rested upon his wife,<sup><xref rid="fn2130">9</xref></sup> as it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn2131">1</xref></sup> &#x201C;So Hilkiah the priest&#x2026; went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum, the son of Tikvah&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxii. 14). Originally his name was &#x201C;the son of Sachrah&#x201D;;<sup><xref rid="fn2132">2</xref></sup> just as thou dost say, &#x201C;Merchandise is better<sup><xref rid="fn2133">3</xref></sup> than the circulation of money&#x201D; (Prov. iii. 14). One Scripture text &#x007C;&#x007C; says, &#x201C;The son of Sachrah.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2134">4</xref></sup> When her husband died, the charitable deeds of her husband ceased,<sup><xref rid="fn2135">5</xref></sup> and all Israel went forth to show loving-kindness to Shallum, son of Tikvah. But they spied the band,<sup><xref rid="fn2136">6</xref></sup> and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha,<sup><xref rid="fn2137">7</xref></sup> and he came to life, as it is said, &#x201C;And as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha, he revived&#x201D; (2 Kings xiii. 21); and afterwards he begat Chanameel,<sup><xref rid="fn2138">8</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Behold, Chanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee&#x201D; (Jer. xxxii. 7).</p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer<sup><xref rid="fn2139">9</xref></sup> said: Know thou the power of charity.<sup><xref rid="fn2140">10</xref></sup> Come and see from (the instance of) Saul, the son of Kish, who removed the witches and the necromancers from off the earth, and once again he loved that which he had hated.<sup><xref rid="fn2141">11</xref></sup> He went to En Dor, to the wife<sup><xref rid="fn2142">12</xref></sup> of Zephaniah, the mother of Abner, and he inquired of her for himself by the familiar spirit, and she brought for him Samuel the prophet, and the dead saw Samuel ascending, and they ascended with him,<sup><xref rid="fn2143">1</xref></sup> thinking that the resurrection of the dead had come,<sup><xref rid="fn2144">2</xref></sup> and the woman beheld, and she became very much confused, as it is said, &#x201C;And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what seest thou?&#x201D; (1 Sam. xxviii. 13).<sup><xref rid="fn2145">3</xref></sup> Some say: Many righteous men like (Samuel) came up with him in that hour.<sup><xref rid="fn2146">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer said: All the dead will arise at the resurrection of the dead, dressed in their shrouds.<sup><xref rid="fn2147">5</xref></sup> Know thou that this is the case. Come and see from (the analogy of) the one who plants (seed) in the earth. He plants naked<sup><xref rid="fn2148">6</xref></sup> (seeds) &#x007C;&#x007C; and they arise covered with many coverings; and the people who descend into the earth dressed (with their garments), will they not rise up dressed (with their garments)?<sup><xref rid="fn2149">7</xref></sup> Not only this, but come and see from Chananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, who went down into the fiery furnace dressed in their garments,<sup><xref rid="fn2150">8</xref></sup> as it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn2151">9</xref></sup> &#x201C;And the satraps&#x2026; being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power upon their bodies&#x2026; neither were their hosen changed&#x201D; (Dan. iii. 27). Learn<sup><xref rid="fn2152">10</xref></sup> from Samuel, the prophet, who came up clothed with his robe, as it is said, &#x201C;And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a robe&#x201D; (1 Sam. xxviii. 14).</p>
<p>Rabbi Jochanan<sup><xref rid="fn2153">1</xref></sup> said: All the prophets prophesied in their lifetime, and Samuel prophesied in his lifetime, and after his death, because Samuel said to Saul: If thou wilt hearken to my advice to fall by the sword, then shall thy death be an atonement for thee,<sup><xref rid="fn2154">2</xref></sup> and thy lot<sup><xref rid="fn2155">3</xref></sup> shall be with me in the place where I abide.<sup><xref rid="fn2156">4</xref></sup> Saul harkened to his advice, and fell by the sword, he and all his sons,<sup><xref rid="fn2157">5</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;So Saul died, and his three sons&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxxi. 6). Why? So that his portion might be with Samuel the prophet in the future life, as it is said, &#x201C;And to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxviii. 19). What is the meaning of &#x201C;with me&#x201D;? Rabbi Jochanan said: With me in my division in heaven.<sup><xref rid="fn2158">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hillel, the Elder, said: Samuel spake to Saul, saying, Was it not enough for thee that thou didst not hearken &#x007C;&#x007C; unto His voice, neither didst thou execute His fierce anger upon Amalek,<sup><xref rid="fn2159">7</xref></sup> but thou dost also inquire<sup><xref rid="fn2160">8</xref></sup> through one possessed of a familiar spirit,<sup><xref rid="fn2161">9</xref></sup> and thou seekest (to know the future). Woe is the shepherd, and woe is his flock&#x0021; For on thy account has the Holy One, blessed be He, given Israel thy people into the hands of the Philistines, as it is said, &#x201C;Moreover, the Lord will deliver Israel also with thee into the hand of the Philistines&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>Rabbi Tachanah<sup><xref rid="fn2162">1</xref></sup> said: Israel was exiled<sup><xref rid="fn2163">2</xref></sup> to Babylon, and did not forsake their evil deeds. Ahab, son of Kolaiah, and Zedekiah, son of Maaseiah,<sup><xref rid="fn2164">3</xref></sup> became lying healers,<sup><xref rid="fn2165">4</xref></sup> and they healed the wives of the Chaldeans, and came unto them for coition.<sup><xref rid="fn2166">5</xref></sup> The king heard thereof, and commanded that they should be burnt. They both said: Let us say that Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, was with us, and he will save<sup><xref rid="fn2167">6</xref></sup> us from the burning with fire. They said to him: O our lord, O king, this man was with us in every matter. The king commanded that the three should be burnt by fire. And the angel Michael<sup><xref rid="fn2168">7</xref></sup> descended and saved Joshua from the fiery flames, and brought him up before the throne of glory, as it is said, &#x201C;And he shewed me Joshua,<sup><xref rid="fn2169">8</xref></sup> the high priest&#x201D; (Zech. iii. 1); and the other two were burnt by fire, as it is said, &#x201C;And of them shall be taken up a curse&#x2026;. The Lord make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire&#x201D; (Jer. xxix. 22). It is not written here &#x201C;whom the king of Babylon burnt with fire,&#x201D; but &#x201C;whom he roasted,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2170">9</xref></sup> hence we learn &#x007C;&#x007C; that his<sup><xref rid="fn2171">10</xref></sup> hairs were singed on account of their sins, as it is said, &#x201C;In the pride of the wicked the poor is <italic>hotly</italic> pursued&#x201D; (Ps. x. 2). Whence do we know that he was delivered? Because it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord said unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan.&#x2026; Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?&#x201D; (Zech. iii. 2).</p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah said: When Nebuchadnezzar brought a false accusation<sup><xref rid="fn2172">1</xref></sup> against Israel to slay them, he set up an idol in the plain of Dura, and caused a herald to proclaim: Any one who does not bow down to this idol shall be burnt by fire. Israel did not trust in the shadow<sup><xref rid="fn2173">2</xref></sup> of their Creator, and came with their wives and sons and bowed down to the idolatrous image<sup><xref rid="fn2174">3</xref></sup>&#x2014;except Daniel, whom they called by the name of their God,<sup><xref rid="fn2175">4</xref></sup> and it would have been a disgrace to them to burn him<sup><xref rid="fn2176">5</xref></sup> in fire, as it is said, &#x201C;But at the last Daniel came in before me&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2177">6</xref></sup> (Dan. iv. 8). And they took Chananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, and put them into the fiery furnace, and the angel Gabriel<sup><xref rid="fn2178">7</xref></sup> descended and saved them from the fiery furnace.<sup><xref rid="fn2179">8</xref></sup> The king said to them:<sup><xref rid="fn2180">9</xref></sup> Ye knew that ye had a God who saves and delivers; why have ye forsaken your God and worshipped idols which have no power to deliver? But just as ye did in your own land and destroyed it, so do ye attempt to do in this land, (namely) to destroy it. The king commanded, &#x007C;&#x007C; and they slew all of them. Whence do we know that they were all slain by the sword? Because it is said, &#x201C;Then said he unto me, Prophesy&#x2026; O breath, and breathe upon these <italic>slain</italic>, that they may live&#x201D; (Ezek. xxxvii. 9).<sup><xref rid="fn2181">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Phineas said: After twenty years, when all of them had been slain in Babylon,<sup><xref rid="fn2182">11</xref></sup> the Holy Spirit rested upon Ezekiel, and brought him forth into the plain of Dura, and called unto him very dry bones, and said to him: Son of Man &#x0021; What dost thou see? He answered: I see here dry bones. (The Spirit) said to him: Have I power to revive them? The prophet did not say:<sup><xref rid="fn2183">1</xref></sup> Sovereign of all the worlds &#x0021; Thou hast power to do even more than (this) here; but he said: &#x201C;O Lord God, thou knowest&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 3), as though he did not believe;<sup><xref rid="fn2184">2</xref></sup> therefore his own bones were not <italic>buried</italic> in a pure land,<sup><xref rid="fn2185">3</xref></sup> but in an unclean land, as it is said, &#x201C;And thou shalt die in a land that is unclean&#x201D; (Amos vii. 17).<sup><xref rid="fn2186">4</xref></sup> &#x201C;Prophesy over these bones&#x201D; (Ezek. xxxvii. 4). He said before Him: Sovereign of all the worlds &#x0021; What &#x0021; will the prophecy bring upon them flesh and sinews and bones?<sup><xref rid="fn2187">5</xref></sup> Or will the prophecy bring upon them all the flesh and bones which cattle, beast, and bird have eaten, and they (also) have died in the land?<sup><xref rid="fn2188">6</xref></sup> Immediately the Holy One, blessed be He, caused His voice to be heard, and the earth shook, as it is said, &#x201C;And as I prophesied there was a thundering, and behold an earthquake&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 7), &#x007C;&#x007C; and every animal, beast, and bird which had eaten thereof and died in another land<sup><xref rid="fn2189">7</xref></sup> the earth brought together, &#x201C;bone to his bone&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2190">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua ben &#x1E32;orchah said: There came down upon them the quickening dew<sup><xref rid="fn2191">9</xref></sup> from heaven, which was like a fountain,<sup><xref rid="fn2192">1</xref></sup> which was bubbling and bringing forth water; so likewise (the bones) were moving and bringing forth upon themselves flesh, (other) bones<sup><xref rid="fn2193">2</xref></sup> and sinews, as it is said, &#x201C;And I beheld, and lo, there were sinews upon them, and flesh came up, and <italic>skin</italic> covered them above&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 8). He said to him: Prophesy unto the wind, as it is said, &#x201C;Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto<sup><xref rid="fn2194">3</xref></sup> the wind.&#x2026; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 9). In that hour the four winds of the heaven went forth, and opened the treasure-house of the souls, and each spirit returned to the body of flesh of man, as it is said, &#x201C;So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived,&#x2026; an <italic>exceeding</italic> great army&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 10); and it is written about Egypt, &#x201C;And the children of Israel were fruitful,&#x2026; and waxed <italic>exceeding</italic> mighty&#x201D; (Ex. i. 7). What is the meaning of &#x201C;exceeding&#x201D;? Just as in the latter case there were 600,000 (men), so in the former case there were 600,000 (men), and they all stood upon their feet except one man. The prophet said: Sovereign of all the worlds &#x0021; What is the nature of this man? He answered him: He gave out money for usury,<sup><xref rid="fn2195">4</xref></sup> and he took with interest. &#x007C;&#x007C; As I live, he shall not live. In that hour the Israelites were sitting and weeping, and saying: We hoped for light, and darkness came. We hoped to stand up with <italic>all</italic> Israel at the resurrection of the dead, and now &#x201C;our hope is lost&#x201D; (Ezek. xxxvii. 11). We hoped to arise so as to be gathered with <italic>all</italic> Israel, and now &#x201C;we are clean cut off&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). In that hour the Holy One, blessed be He, said to the prophet: Therefore, say to them, As I live, I will cause you to stand at the resurrection of the dead in the future that is to come, and I will gather you with all Israel<sup><xref rid="fn2196">5</xref></sup> to the land, as it is said, &#x201C;Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves&#x2026; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.&#x2026; And I will put my spirit in you, and ye shall live&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 12, 14).</p>

The doubt of Ezekiel is noted by Tertullian, <italic>On the Resurrection of the Flesh</italic>, xxx. In this passage the Church Father interprets the vision in a literal sense, rejecting the allegorical meaning which was given to the vision in his day. Justin Martyr (<italic>First Apology</italic>, lii.) refers to this prophecy as pointing to the resurrection to be brought about by the Christian Messiah at his second coming; his words are: &#x201C;By Ezekiel the prophet it was said: &#x2018;Joint shall be joined to joint, and bone to bone, and flesh shall grow again; and every knee shall bow to the Lord, and every tongue shall confess Him&#x2019;&#x201D; (Ezek. xxxvii. 7, 8, and Isa. xlv. 23).

<h1><small>THE RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD</small> [43<small>B</small>. ii.]</h1>
<p>&#x201C;S<small>EE</small> now that I, even I, am he,<sup><xref rid="fn2198">1</xref></sup> and there is no God with me&#x201D; (Deut. xxxii. 89). Only the Holy One, blessed be He, said: &#x201C;<italic>I am</italic>&#x201D; in this world, and &#x201C;<italic>I am</italic>&#x201D; in the world to come; <italic>I am</italic> the one who redeemed Israel from Egypt, and <italic>I am</italic> the one who, in the future, will redeem them at the end of the fourth kingdom; therefore it is said, &#x201C;I, even I, am he, and there is no God with me&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). Every nation who say that there is a second God, I will slay them as with a second death<sup><xref rid="fn2199">2</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C; which has no resurrection; and every nation who say that there is no second God, I will quicken them for the eternal life. And in the future I will slay those (first mentioned) and quicken these, therefore it is said, &#x201C;I kill, and I make alive&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). I have wounded<sup><xref rid="fn2200">3</xref></sup> Jerusalem and her people on the day of My anger, and in great mercy<sup><xref rid="fn2201">4</xref></sup> I <italic>will</italic> heal them,<sup><xref rid="fn2202">5</xref></sup> therefore it is said, &#x201C;I have wounded, and I <italic>will</italic> heal&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). Neither any angel nor any seraph<sup><xref rid="fn2203">6</xref></sup> will deliver the wicked from the judgment of Gehinnom, as it is said, &#x201C;And there is none that can deliver out of my hand&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>Rabbi Jochanan<sup><xref rid="fn2204">7</xref></sup> said: All the dead will arise at the resurrection of the dead, except the generation of the Flood,<sup><xref rid="fn2205">1</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;The dead shall not live, the deceased (Rephaim)<sup><xref rid="fn2206">2</xref></sup> shall not rise&#x201D; (Isa. xxvi. 14). &#x201C;The dead (who) shall not live&#x201D; refer to the heathens, who are like the carcase of cattle;<sup><xref rid="fn2207">3</xref></sup> they shall arise for the day of judgment,<sup><xref rid="fn2208">4</xref></sup> yet they shall not live; but the men of the generation of the Flood, even for the day of judgment they shall not arise, as it is said, &#x201C;The Rephaim shall not rise&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). All their souls become winds,<sup><xref rid="fn2209">5</xref></sup> accursed, injuring<sup><xref rid="fn2210">6</xref></sup> the sons of men, and in the future world the Holy One, blessed be He, will destroy them out of the world, so that they should not do harm to a single Israelite, as it is said, &#x201C;Therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them,<sup><xref rid="fn2211">7</xref></sup> and made all their memory to perish&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2212">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Zechariah said: The sleep at night is like this world, and the awakening of the morning<sup><xref rid="fn2213">9</xref></sup> is like the world to come. And just as &#x007C;&#x007C; in the sleep of the night a man lies down and sleeps, and his spirit wanders over all the earth, and tells him in a dream<sup><xref rid="fn2214">10</xref></sup> whatever happens, as it is said, &#x201C;In a dream, in a vision of the night&#x2026; then he openeth the ears of men&#x201D; (Job xxxiii. 15, 16), likewise (with) the dead, their spirit wanders over all the earth, and tells them all things<sup><xref rid="fn2215">11</xref></sup> that happen in the world, but they are silent and (yet) they give song and praise to God, who will quicken them in the future, as it is said, &#x201C;Let the saints exult in glory&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2216">12</xref></sup> (Ps. cxlix. 5). The awakening in the morning is like the future world. A parable<sup><xref rid="fn2217">1</xref></sup>&#x2014;unto what is the matter to be likened? To a man who awakens out of his sleep, in like manner will the dead awaken in the future world, as it is said, &#x201C;O satisfy us in the <italic>morning</italic> with thy loving-kindness&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2218">2</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic> xc. 14).</p>
<p>The voices of five (objects of creation)<sup><xref rid="fn2219">3</xref></sup> go from one end of the world to the other, and their voices are inaudible.<sup><xref rid="fn2220">4</xref></sup> When people cut down the wood of the tree<sup><xref rid="fn2221">5</xref></sup> which yields fruit, its cry goes from one end of the world to the other, and the voice is inaudible. When the serpent sloughs off its skin,<sup><xref rid="fn2222">6</xref></sup> its cry goes from one end of the world to the other and its voice is not heard.<sup><xref rid="fn2223">7</xref></sup> When a woman is divorced from her husband,<sup><xref rid="fn2224">8</xref></sup> her voice goeth forth from one end of the world to the other, but the voice is inaudible.<sup><xref rid="fn2225">9</xref></sup> When the infant &#x007C;&#x007C; comes forth from its mother&#x2019;s<sup><xref rid="fn2226">10</xref></sup> womb.<sup><xref rid="fn2227">11</xref></sup> When the soul departs from the body,<sup><xref rid="fn2228">12</xref></sup> the cry goes forth from one end of the world to the other, and the voice is not heard.

All the heathens who die<sup><xref rid="fn2241">12</xref></sup> in the land of Israel have their souls cast outside the land (of Israel<sup><xref rid="fn2242">13</xref></sup>), as it is said, &#x201C;And the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as from the hollow of a sling&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>), (even) beyond the land (of Israel).</p>
<p>In the future world the Holy One, blessed be He, will take hold of the corners of the land of Israel, and shake it (free) from all unclean (things),<sup><xref rid="fn2243">1</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;That it might take hold of the ends of the earth,<sup><xref rid="fn2244">2</xref></sup> and the wicked be shaken out of it&#x201D; (Job xxxviii. 13).</p>
<p>A man has three friends &#x007C;&#x007C; in his lifetime, and they are: his sons and his household,<sup><xref rid="fn2245">3</xref></sup> his money, and his good deeds. At the hour of a man&#x2019;s departure from the world he gathers his sons and his household, and he says to them: I beg of you to come and save me from the judgment of this evil death.<sup><xref rid="fn2246">4</xref></sup> They answer him, saying to him: Hast thou not heard that there is no one who can prevail over the day of death? and is it not written thus, &#x201C;None of them can by any means redeem his brother&#x201D; (Ps. xlix. 7)?<sup><xref rid="fn2247">5</xref></sup> &#x201C;For the redemption of their soul is costly&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2248">6</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic> 8). And he has his money fetched, and says to it:<sup><xref rid="fn2249">7</xref></sup> I beseech thee, save me from the judgment of this evil death. It answers him, saying: Hast thou not heard, &#x201C;Riches profit not in the day of wrath&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2250">1</xref></sup> (Prov. xi. 4)? He (then) has his good deeds fetched, and he says to them: I beseech you, come and deliver me from the judgment of this evil death.<sup><xref rid="fn2251">2</xref></sup> And they answer him and say to him:<sup><xref rid="fn2252">3</xref></sup> Before thou goest, verily, we will go in advance of thee, as it is said, &#x201C;And charity delivereth from death&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). Does then charity deliver from death? (This refers) to an evil death only. Another Scripture says, &#x201C;And thy righteousness shall go before thee,<sup><xref rid="fn2253">4</xref></sup> the glory of the Lord shall be thy rearward&#x201D; (Isa. lviii. 8).<sup><xref rid="fn2254">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>All the seven days of mourning the soul goeth forth and returneth from its (former) home to its sepulchral abode, and from its sepulchral abode to its (former) home.<sup><xref rid="fn2255">6</xref></sup> After the seven days of mourning the body &#x007C;&#x007C; begins to breed worms,<sup><xref rid="fn2256">7</xref></sup> and it decays and returns to the dust,<sup><xref rid="fn2257">8</xref></sup> as it originally was, as it is said, &#x201C;And the dust returns to the earth as it was&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2258">9</xref></sup> (Eccles. xii. 7). The soul goes forth and returns to the place whence it was given, from heaven, as it is said, &#x201C;And the soul<sup><xref rid="fn2259">10</xref></sup> returns unto God who gave it&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). And whence do we learn that the soul has been given from heaven?<sup><xref rid="fn2260">11</xref></sup> Come and see. When the Holy One, blessed be He, formed man, he did not have in him the spirit.<sup><xref rid="fn2261">1</xref></sup> What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He breathed with the spirit of the breath of His mouth, and cast a soul<sup><xref rid="fn2262">2</xref></sup> into him, as it is said, &#x201C;And he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life&#x201D; (Gen. ii. 7).<sup><xref rid="fn2263">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Ishmael<sup><xref rid="fn2264">4</xref></sup> said: All the bodies crumble<sup><xref rid="fn2265">5</xref></sup> into the dust of the earth, until nothing remains of the body except a spoonful of earthy matter.<sup><xref rid="fn2266">6</xref></sup> In the future life, when the Holy One, blessed be He, calls<sup><xref rid="fn2267">7</xref></sup> to the earth to return all the bodies deposited with it,<sup><xref rid="fn2268">8</xref></sup> that which had become mixed with the dust of the earth, like the yeast which is mixed with the dough, improves and increases, and it raises up all the body.<sup><xref rid="fn2269">9</xref></sup> When the Holy One, blessed be He, calls to the earth to return all the bodies deposited with it, that which has become mixed with the dust of the earth, improves and increases and raises up all the body without water.<sup><xref rid="fn2270">10</xref></sup> Forthwith the earth quakes and the mountains tremble,<sup><xref rid="fn2271">11</xref></sup> and the graves are opened,<sup><xref rid="fn2272">12</xref></sup> and the stones of the graves are scattered about one from the other, as it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord God shall save them &#x007C;&#x007C; in that day as the flock of his people:<sup><xref rid="fn2273">13</xref></sup> for they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifted on high over his land&#x201D; (Zech. ix. 16).</p>
<p>Rabbi Azariah said: All the souls are in the hands of the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is said, &#x201C;In whose hand is the soul of every living thing&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2274">1</xref></sup> (Job xii. 10). A parable&#x2014;to what is the matter like? To a person who was going in the market with the key of his house in his hand. As long as the key is in his hand, all his money is in his hand. Likewise the Holy One, blessed be He, has the key of the graves,<sup><xref rid="fn2275">2</xref></sup> and the key of the treasure-houses of the souls;<sup><xref rid="fn2276">3</xref></sup> and He will restore every spirit to the body of flesh of man, as it is said, &#x201C;Thou sendest forth thy spirit,<sup><xref rid="fn2277">4</xref></sup> they are created;<sup><xref rid="fn2278">5</xref></sup> and thou renewest the face of the ground&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2279">6</xref></sup> (Ps. civ. 30).</p>
<p>The soul is like its Creator.<sup><xref rid="fn2280">7</xref></sup> Just as the Holy One, blessed be He, sees and is not visible, so the soul sees and is not visible.<sup><xref rid="fn2281">8</xref></sup> Just as the Holy One, blessed be He, has no sleep in His presence,<sup><xref rid="fn2282">9</xref></sup> so the soul does not sleep.<sup><xref rid="fn2283">10</xref></sup> Just as the Holy One, blessed be He, bears His world,<sup><xref rid="fn2284">11</xref></sup> so the soul bears all the body.<sup><xref rid="fn2285">12</xref></sup> All souls are His, as it is said, &#x201C;Behold, all souls are mine&#x201D; (Ezek. xviii. 4).</p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah said: From the day when the Temple was destroyed, the land (of Israel) is <italic>broken down</italic> on account of the wickedness of those who dwell therein; like a man who is sick and has no power to stand, so is the land broken down and is without power to yield her fruits, as it is said, &#x201C;The earth also is polluted under the inhabitants thereof&#x201D; (Isa. xxiv. 5).<sup><xref rid="fn2286">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the future life the Holy One, blessed be He, will cause the reviving dew to descend, and He will quicken the dead and renew all things, as it is said, &#x201C;<italic>Thy</italic> dead shall live&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxvi. 19). They are the Israelites, who died trusting in His name. &#x007C;&#x007C; &#x201C;<italic>My</italic> dead bodies shall arise&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). They are the heathens, who are like the carcase of the beast;<sup><xref rid="fn2287">1</xref></sup> they shall arise for the day of judgment, but they shall not live. &#x201C;Awake and sing, ye that dwell in the dust&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). They are the righteous, for they dwell<sup><xref rid="fn2288">2</xref></sup> in the dust. &#x201C;For thy dew is as the dew of light&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). The dew of the righteous is not the dew of darkness,<sup><xref rid="fn2289">3</xref></sup> but (it is) the dew of light, as it is said, &#x201C;For thy dew is as the dew of light&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>); and it gives healing to the earth, as it is said, &#x201C;And the earth shall cast forth the dead&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2290">4</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic>).

<title>CHAPTER XXXV</title>
<h1><small>THE VISION OF JACOB AT BETHEL</small> [45<small>B</small> i.]</h1>
<p>&#x201C;B<small>ETTER</small> is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof&#x201D; (Eccles. vii. 8). The first blessings wherewith Isaac blessed Jacob were concerning the dews of heaven, and concerning the corn of the earth,<sup><xref rid="fn2303">1</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And God give thee of the dew of heaven,<sup><xref rid="fn2304">2</xref></sup> and of the fatness of the earth&#x201D; (Gen. xxvii. 28). The final blessings were the blessings of the foundation of the world, and in them there is no (interruption),<sup><xref rid="fn2305">3</xref></sup> either in this world or in the world to come, as it is said, &#x201C;And God Almighty bless thee&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxviii. 3). And he further added unto him the blessing of Abraham, &#x007C;&#x007C; as it is said, &#x201C;And may he give thee the blessing of Abraham,<sup><xref rid="fn2306">4</xref></sup> to thee and to thy seed with thee&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2307">5</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic> 4). Therefore (say)<sup><xref rid="fn2308">6</xref></sup>: &#x201C;Better is the end of a thing<sup><xref rid="fn2309">7</xref></sup> than the beginning thereof&#x201D; (Eccles. vii. 8). &#x201C;Better is the patient in spirit than the proud in spirit&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2310">8</xref></sup> &#x201C;Better is the patient in spirit&#x201D;&#x2014;this (saying) is applicable<sup><xref rid="fn2311">9</xref></sup> to our father Jacob, for every day he was patient in spirit, and he spake all kinds of words of entreaty.<sup><xref rid="fn2312">1</xref></sup> (The words) &#x201C;than the proud in spirit&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>) refer to the wicked Esau, because every day he was eating the flesh of that which he had hunted. Owing to his pride he did not give any of his food to Jacob. Once he went out to hunt but he did not meet with any success. He saw Jacob eating lentil food, and he desired this in his heart, and he said to him: &#x201C;Let me gulp down, I pray thee, some of that red pottage&#x201D; (Gen. xxv. 30). Jacob said to him: Thou camest forth red at thy birth from thy mother; (now) thou dost desire to eat (this) <italic>red</italic> food; therefore he called his name &#x201C;Edom&#x201D; (red), as it is said, &#x201C;And Esau said to Jacob&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer said: Lentils are the food of mourning<sup><xref rid="fn2313">2</xref></sup> and sorrow. Know thou that this is so, for when Abel had been killed, his parents were eating lentil food (as a sign) of their mourning for him in mourning and sorrow.<sup><xref rid="fn2314">3</xref></sup> And Jacob was eating lentil food in mourning and sorrow<sup><xref rid="fn2315">4</xref></sup> because the kingdom, the dominion, and the birthright belonged to Esau. Moreover, on that day Abraham, his grandfather, died.<sup><xref rid="fn2316">5</xref></sup> The Israelites eat lentil food in mourning and sorrow on account of the mourning &#x007C;&#x007C; and sorrow for the Temple,<sup><xref rid="fn2317">6</xref></sup> and on account of the exile of Israel. Hence thou mayest learn that the children of Esau will not fall until a remnant from Israel shall come and give to the children of Esau lentil food in mourning and sorrow, and will take away from them the dominion of the kingdom and the birthright, which Jacob acquired from (Esau) by oath, as it is said, &#x201C;And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 33).</p>
<p>Rabbi &#x2018; A&#x1E33;iba said: Every place where our forefathers went, the well went in front of them, and they<sup><xref rid="fn2318">1</xref></sup> dug three times and found it before them.<sup><xref rid="fn2319">2</xref></sup> Abraham dug three times and found it before him, as it is said, &#x201C;And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxvi. 18). And Isaac dug in the land (of Canaan) four times,<sup><xref rid="fn2320">3</xref></sup> and found it before him, as it is said, &#x201C;And Isaac&#x2019;s servants digged in the valley&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 19).<sup><xref rid="fn2321">4</xref></sup> And it is written about Jerusalem, &#x201C;And it shall come to pass in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem&#x201D; (Zech. xiv. 8). This refers to the well which will arise in Jerusalem in the future,<sup><xref rid="fn2322">5</xref></sup> and will water all its surroundings. Because they found (the well) seven<sup><xref rid="fn2323">6</xref></sup> times, he<sup><xref rid="fn2324">7</xref></sup> called it Shib&#x2019;ah (seven).<sup><xref rid="fn2325">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Jacob was seventy-seven years old<sup><xref rid="fn2326">9</xref></sup> when he went forth from his father&#x2019;s house, and the well went before him.<sup><xref rid="fn2327">10</xref></sup> From Beer-Sheba as far as Mount Moriah is a journey of two days, &#x007C;&#x007C; and he arrived there<sup><xref rid="fn2328">11</xref></sup> at midday, and the Holy One, blessed be He, met him, as it is said, &#x201C;And he met in the place,<sup><xref rid="fn2329">1</xref></sup> and tarried there all night, because the sun was set&#x201D; (Gen. xxviii. 11). Why is the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, called Ma&#x1E33;om?<sup><xref rid="fn2330">2</xref></sup> Because in every <italic>place</italic> where the righteous are<sup><xref rid="fn2331">3</xref></sup> He is found with them<sup><xref rid="fn2332">4</xref></sup> there, as it is said, &#x201C;In every <italic>place</italic> (Ma&#x1E33;om) where I record my name<sup><xref rid="fn2333">5</xref></sup> I will come unto thee, and bless thee&#x201D; (Ex. xx. 24). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Jacob &#x0021; The bread is in thy bag,<sup><xref rid="fn2334">6</xref></sup> and the well is before thee, so that thou mayest eat and drink<sup><xref rid="fn2335">7</xref></sup> and sleep in this place. He said before Him: Sovereign of all the worlds &#x0021; Till now the sun has still fifty degrees to set,<sup><xref rid="fn2336">8</xref></sup> and I am lying down in this place. And (thereupon) the sun set in the west, although not in its proper time. Jacob looked and saw the sun setting in the west, and he tarried there, as it is said, &#x201C;And he tarried there all night, because the sun was set&#x201D; (Gen. xxviii. 11).</p>
<p>Jacob took twelve stones<sup><xref rid="fn2337">9</xref></sup> of the stones of the altar, whereon his father Isaac had been bound, and he set them for his pillow in that place,<sup><xref rid="fn2338">10</xref></sup> to indicate to himself that twelve tribes were destined to arise from him. And they all became one stone, to indicate to him that all (the tribes) were destined to become one people<sup><xref rid="fn2339">11</xref></sup> on the earth, as it is said, &#x201C;And who is like thy people Israel, <italic>a nation that is alone</italic> on the earth&#x201D; (1 Chron. xvii. 21).</p>
<p>Rabbi Levi said: In that night the Holy One, blessed be He, showed him all the signs. He showed him a ladder standing from the earth to the heaven, as it is said, &#x201C;And he dreamed, and behold &#x007C;&#x007C; a ladder<sup><xref rid="fn2340">1</xref></sup> set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven&#x201D; (Gen. xxviii. 12). And the ministering angels were ascending and descending thereon, and they beheld the face of Jacob, and they said: This is the face<sup><xref rid="fn2341">2</xref></sup> like the face of the Chayyah,<sup><xref rid="fn2342">3</xref></sup> which is on the Throne of Glory.<sup><xref rid="fn2343">4</xref></sup> Such (angels) who were (on earth) below were ascending to see the face of Jacob among the faces of the Chayyah, (for it was) like the face of the Chayyah, which is on the Throne of Glory. Some (angels) ascended and some descended,<sup><xref rid="fn2344">5</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And behold the angels of God were ascending and descending on it&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2345">6</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, showed him the four kingdoms, their rule and their destruction, and He showed him the prince of the kingdom of Babylon ascending [seventy rungs, and descending; and He showed him the prince of the kingdom of]<sup><xref rid="fn2346">7</xref></sup> Media ascending fifty-two rungs and descending; [and He showed him the prince of the kingdom of Greece ascending 180 ascents and descending;]<sup><xref rid="fn2346">7</xref></sup> and He showed him the prince of the kingdom of Edom ascending, and he was not descending, but was saying, &#x201C;I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High&#x201D; (Isa. xiv. 14). Jacob replied to him: &#x201C;Yet thou shalt be brought down to Sheol,<sup><xref rid="fn2347">8</xref></sup> to the uttermost parts of the pit&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 15). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Even &#x201C;though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle&#x201D; (Jer. xlix. 16).</p>
<p>Jacob rose up early in the morning in great fear, and said:<sup><xref rid="fn2348">9</xref></sup> The house of the Holy One, blessed be He, is in this place, as it is said, &#x201C;And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place &#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn2349">1</xref></sup> this is none other but the house of God&#x201D; (Gen. xxviii. 17). Hence thou canst learn that every one who prays in Jerusalem<sup><xref rid="fn2350">2</xref></sup> is (reckoned) as though he had prayed before the Throne of Glory,<sup><xref rid="fn2351">3</xref></sup> for the gate of heaven is there, and it is open to hear the prayers of Israel, as it is said, &#x201C;And this is the gate of heaven&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>And Jacob returned to gather the stones, and he found them all (turned into) one stone, and he set &#x007C;&#x007C; it up for a pillar in the midst of the place, and oil descended for him from heaven,<sup><xref rid="fn2352">4</xref></sup> and he poured it thereon, as it is said, &#x201C;And he poured oil upon the top of it&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 18).<sup><xref rid="fn2353">5</xref></sup> What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He placed (thereon)<sup><xref rid="fn2354">6</xref></sup> His right foot,<sup><xref rid="fn2355">7</xref></sup> and sank the stone to the bottom of the depths, and He made it<sup><xref rid="fn2356">8</xref></sup> the keystone of the earth, just like a man who sets a keystone in an arch;<sup><xref rid="fn2357">9</xref></sup> therefore it is called the <italic>foundation</italic> stone,<sup><xref rid="fn2358">10</xref></sup> for there is the navel of the earth, and therefrom was all the earth evolved, and upon it the Sanctuary of God<sup><xref rid="fn2359">11</xref></sup> stands, as it is said, &#x201C;And this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God&#x2019;s house&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 22).</p>
<p>And Jacob fell upon his face to the ground before the foundation stone, and he prayed before the Holy One, blessed be He, saying: Sovereign of all worlds &#x0021; If Thou wilt bring me back to this place in peace, I will sacrifice before Thee offerings of thanksgiving and burnt offerings,<sup><xref rid="fn2360">12</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And Jacob vowed a vow, saying&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 20). There he left the well,<sup><xref rid="fn2361">1</xref></sup> and thence he lifted up his feet, and in the twinkle of the eye he came to Haran, as it is said, &#x201C;And Jacob went on his journey,<sup><xref rid="fn2362">2</xref></sup> and came to the land of the children of the east&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxix. 1); and the (text) says, &#x201C;And Jacob went<sup><xref rid="fn2362">2</xref></sup> from Beer-Sheba, and went to Haran&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxviii. 10). &#x201C;And the Holy God is sanctified in righteousness&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2363">3</xref></sup> (Isa. v. 16). The angels answered and said: Blessed art Thou, O Lord, the Holy God.<sup><xref rid="fn2364">4</xref></sup></p>

<title>CHAPTER XXXVI</title>
<h1><small>JACOB AND LABAN</small> [46<small>B</small>. ii.]</h1>
<p>&#x201C;W<small>HEN</small> thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and if thou runnest, &#x007C;&#x007C; thou shalt not stumble&#x201D; (Prov. iv. 12).</p>
<p>Jacob&#x2019;s steps were not straitened,<sup><xref rid="fn2365">1</xref></sup> and his strength did not fail,<sup><xref rid="fn2366">2</xref></sup> and like a strong hero he rolled away the stone from the mouth of the well, and the well came up, and spread forth water outside itself,<sup><xref rid="fn2367">3</xref></sup> and the shepherds saw and they all wondered, for all of them were unable to roll away the stone<sup><xref rid="fn2368">4</xref></sup> from the mouth of the well; but Jacob alone rolled the stone from off the mouth of the well,<sup><xref rid="fn2369">5</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well&#x2019;s mouth&#x201D; (Gen. xxix. 10).</p>
<p>Rabbi &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: Anyone who enters a city,<sup><xref rid="fn2370">6</xref></sup> and finds maidens coming forth before him, his way will be prosperous (before him). Whence dost thou know this? Know that it is so. Come and see from Eliezer, the servant of our father Abraham, who, whilst he had not yet entered the city, found maidens coming out before him, as it is said, &#x201C;Behold, I stand<sup><xref rid="fn2371">7</xref></sup> by the fountain of water,&#x201D; etc.<sup><xref rid="fn2372">8</xref></sup> (Gen. xxiv. 43). And He prospered his way.<sup><xref rid="fn2373">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Whence again dost thou learn this? Know that it is so. Come and see from Moses, for, although he had not yet entered the city, he found maidens coming out before him, as it is said, &#x201C;Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters; and they came&#x201D; (Ex. ii. 16). And He prospered his way, and he redeemed Israel from Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn2374">1</xref></sup> Whence dost thou know this? Know that it<sup><xref rid="fn2375">2</xref></sup> is so. Come and see from Saul, for whilst he had not yet entered the city, he found maidens coming forth before him, as it is said, &#x201C;As they went up the ascent<sup><xref rid="fn2376">3</xref></sup> to the city, they found young maidens going out&#x201D; (1 Sam. ix. 11).<sup><xref rid="fn2377">4</xref></sup> And He prospered his way and he acquired the sovereignty. &#x007C;&#x007C; And whence do we know this? Know thou that it is so. Come and learn from Jacob, for whilst he had not yet entered the city, he found maidens coming forth before him, as it is said, &#x201C;And, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh&#x201D; (Gen. xxix. 6).</p>
<p>Rab Huna said: Everything is revealed and foreseen before the Holy One, blessed be He. Before Jacob came to Haran, what did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He sent a plague among the sheep of Laban, and few were left out of many, and Rachel was tending<sup><xref rid="fn2378">5</xref></sup> these, as it is said, &#x201C;Rachel came with her father&#x2019;s sheep;<sup><xref rid="fn2379">6</xref></sup> for she kept them&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 9). Whence do we know that few remained of the many? Because it is said, &#x201C;And Jacob fed the <italic>rest</italic> of Laban&#x2019;s flocks&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxx. 86), &#x201C;the rest&#x201D; (which remained) after the plague, in order to increase and multiply Laban&#x2019;s flocks at the feet of Jacob.<sup><xref rid="fn2380">7</xref></sup> Hence (the sages) said: Sometimes the foot of man destroys the house, and sometimes the foot of man blesses the house,<sup><xref rid="fn2381">1</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord hath blessed thee at my foot&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 80). Likewise Laban<sup><xref rid="fn2382">2</xref></sup> said to Jacob: &#x201C;I have divined<sup><xref rid="fn2383">3</xref></sup> that the Lord hath blessed me for thy sake&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 27).</p>
<p>When Laban heard the tidings of Jacob, the son of his sister, and the power of his might which he had displayed at the well, he ran to meet him, to kiss him, and to embrace him, as it is said, &#x201C;And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob, his sister&#x2019;s son&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxix. 13). &#x201C;And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 15). Was he then his brother? Was he not the son of his sister? This teaches thee that the son of a man&#x2019;s sister is like his son,<sup><xref rid="fn2384">4</xref></sup> and the son of a man&#x2019;s brother &#x007C;&#x007C; is like his brother. Whence do we learn (this)? From Abraham, our father, because it is said, &#x201C;And Abram said to Lot, Let there not be strife<sup><xref rid="fn2385">5</xref></sup>&#x2026; for we are brethren&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xiii. 8). Another verse (says), &#x201C;And when Abram<sup><xref rid="fn2386">6</xref></sup> heard that his brother was taken captive&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xiv. 14). Was he his brother?<sup><xref rid="fn2387">7</xref></sup> Was he not the son of his brother? But it teaches thee that the sons of a man&#x2019;s brother are like his own brothers.</p>
<p>The sons of a man&#x2019;s sons are like his own sons. Whence do we learn (this)? From Jacob, because it is said, &#x201C;Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, shall be mine&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xlviii. 5). Were they his sons? Were they not the sons of his son? But it teaches thee that the sons of a man&#x2019;s sons are as his own sons. And the sons of one&#x2019;s daughters are as one&#x2019;s own sons. Whence do we learn (this)? From Laban, because it is said, &#x201C;And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the sons are my sons&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxxi. 43).<sup><xref rid="fn2388">1</xref></sup> Were they then his sons? Were they not the sons of his daughters? But it teaches thee that the sons of a man&#x2019;s daughters are like his own sons.</p>
<p>Jacob began to serve for a wife<sup><xref rid="fn2389">2</xref></sup> for seven years. He<sup><xref rid="fn2390">3</xref></sup> made a banquet and rejoicing for seven days,<sup><xref rid="fn2391">4</xref></sup> and married Rachel,<sup><xref rid="fn2392">5</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Fulfil the week of this one&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxix. 27). &#x201C;And Jacob did so, and fulfilled the week of this one&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2393">6</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic> 28).<sup><xref rid="fn2394">7</xref></sup> All the men of the place were gathered together to show loving-kindness to our father Jacob, as it is said, &#x201C;And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 22).</p>
<p>The Holy One, blessed be He, said: Ye have shown loving-kindness to Jacob, My servant, I also will give &#x007C;&#x007C; you and your sons your reward<sup><xref rid="fn2395">8</xref></sup> in this world, so that there be no reward for the wicked in the future world, as it is said, &#x201C;Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Aram<sup><xref rid="fn2396">9</xref></sup>&#x2026; because by him the Lord had given victory unto Aram&#x201D; (2 Kings v. 1).</p>
<p>(Laban) took his two handmaids, and gave them to his two daughters. Were they his handmaids? Were they not his daughters?<sup><xref rid="fn2397">10</xref></sup> But according to the law of the land the daughters<sup><xref rid="fn2398">1</xref></sup> of a man by his concubines are called handmaids, as it is said, &#x201C;And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter<sup><xref rid="fn2399">2</xref></sup> Bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid&#x201D; (Gen. xxix. 29).<sup><xref rid="fn2400">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Levi said: The Holy One, blessed be He, saw the sorrow of Leah, and He gave her power to conceive, (bringing) consolation to her soul;<sup><xref rid="fn2401">4</xref></sup> and she bare a male child, goodly in appearance, and wise; and she said: <italic>See ye a son</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2402">5</xref></sup> which the Holy One, blessed be He, has given me, as it is said, &#x201C;And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben; for she said, Because the Lord hath looked <italic>upon my affliction</italic>&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 32). Therefore he<sup><xref rid="fn2403">6</xref></sup> called his name Reuben.</p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer said: Leah bare her sons after seven months,<sup><xref rid="fn2404">7</xref></sup> and in seven years there were born unto Jacob eleven sons<sup><xref rid="fn2405">8</xref></sup> and one daughter.<sup><xref rid="fn2406">9</xref></sup> And all of them were born, each with his partner<sup><xref rid="fn2407">10</xref></sup> with him, except Joseph, whose partner was not born with him, for Asenath, the daughter of Dinah, was destined to be his wife,<sup><xref rid="fn2408">11</xref></sup> and (also) except Dinah, whose partner was not born with her. She<sup><xref rid="fn2409">1</xref></sup> said: This child is (according to) justice and judgment,<sup><xref rid="fn2410">2</xref></sup> therefore she called her name Dinah.<sup><xref rid="fn2411">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer also said: Jacob fled in order to come to Laban, and he fled to get away from Laban. Whence do we know that he fled in order to come to Laban? Because it is said, &#x201C;And Jacob <italic>fled</italic> &#x007C;&#x007C; into the field of Aram&#x201D; (Hos. xii. 12). (Whence do we know that)<sup><xref rid="fn2412">4</xref></sup> he fled in order to get away from Laban? Because it is said, &#x201C;And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled&#x201D; (Gen. xxxi. 22). Why did he flee? Because the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Jacob &#x0021; I cannot suffer My Shekhinah to dwell with thee outside the land,<sup><xref rid="fn2413">5</xref></sup> but &#x201C;return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 3).<sup><xref rid="fn2414">6</xref></sup> Therefore he fled. And Laban took all the men of his city, mighty men, and he pursued after him, seeking to slay him. The angel Michael descended, and drew his sword behind him,<sup><xref rid="fn2415">7</xref></sup> seeking to slay him. He said to him: Do not speak to Jacob, either good or bad, as it is said, &#x201C;And God came to Laban the Aram&#x00E6;an in a dream of the night,<sup><xref rid="fn2416">8</xref></sup> and said unto him, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 24). Laban rose up early in the morning, and saw all that Jacob had, and he said (to him):<sup><xref rid="fn2417">9</xref></sup> All these are mine, and since thou hast taken all these, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my Teraphim, which I worshipped?<sup><xref rid="fn2418">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>What are the Teraphim? They slay a man, a firstborn, and he is red (in colour). All that a man requires (to know) is not written here. This is impossible, since the men who dispute about the knowledge of making (the Teraphim) have increased. Everyone who follows that knowledge will ultimately go down to Gehinnom.<sup><xref rid="fn2419">1</xref></sup> And they pinch off his head, and salt it with salt,<sup><xref rid="fn2420">2</xref></sup> and they write upon a golden plate<sup><xref rid="fn2421">3</xref></sup> the name of an unclean (spirit),<sup><xref rid="fn2422">4</xref></sup> and place it under his tongue,<sup><xref rid="fn2423">5</xref></sup> and they put it in the wall, and they kindle lamps<sup><xref rid="fn2424">6</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C; before it, and bow down to it, and it<sup><xref rid="fn2425">7</xref></sup> speaks unto them. Whence do we know that the Teraphim speak? Because it is said, &#x201C;For the Teraphim have spoken vanity&#x201D; (Zech. x. 2).<sup><xref rid="fn2426">8</xref></sup> On that account had Rachel stolen them, so that they should not tell Laban that Jacob had fled, and not only that, but also to remove idolatrous worship from her father&#x2019;s house.<sup><xref rid="fn2427">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now Jacob knew nothing of all this, and he said: Anyone who has stolen thy Teraphim shall die before his proper time;<sup><xref rid="fn2428">1</xref></sup> and the utterance<sup><xref rid="fn2429">2</xref></sup> of a righteous person is like the speech from the mouth of an angel,<sup><xref rid="fn2430">3</xref></sup> and (Rachel) bare and died, as it is said, &#x201C;And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, for she died&#x201D; (Gen. xxxv. 18).</p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah said: Three forefathers made covenants with the people of the land.<sup><xref rid="fn2431">4</xref></sup> (With reference to) Abraham (the circumstances were as follows).<sup><xref rid="fn2432">5</xref></sup> When the angels were revealed unto him, he thought that they were travellers (from among) the people of the land,<sup><xref rid="fn2433">6</xref></sup> and he ran to meet them, and he wished to prepare for them a great banquet,<sup><xref rid="fn2434">7</xref></sup> and he told Sarah to prepare cakes for them. When Sarah was kneading, she perceived that the manner of women was upon her,<sup><xref rid="fn2435">8</xref></sup> therefore he did not hand them any of the cakes. He ran to fetch a calf. But the calf fled from before him, and went into the Cave of Machpelah, and he went in there after it, and he found Adam and his help-meet<sup><xref rid="fn2436">9</xref></sup> lying there upon their beds,<sup><xref rid="fn2437">10</xref></sup> and they slept, and lights were kindled above them,<sup><xref rid="fn2438">11</xref></sup> and a sweet scent was upon them like a sweet savour, therefore he desired to have the Cave of Machpelah as a burial possession. He spoke to the sons of Jebus, in order to purchase from them the Cave of &#x007C;&#x007C; Machpelah by a purchase with gold,<sup><xref rid="fn2439">12</xref></sup> and by a perpetual deed for a possession of a burying-place. Were they Jebusites? Were they not Hittites? But they were called Jebusites according to the name of the city of Jebus.<sup><xref rid="fn2440">1</xref></sup> The men did not accept (this request).<sup><xref rid="fn2441">2</xref></sup> He began to bow down and prostrate himself unto them, as it is said, &#x201C;And Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxiii. 12).</p>
<p>They said to him: We know that the Holy One, blessed be He, will give to thee and to thy seed in the future all these lands; make a covenant with us by an oath that thy seed shall not take possession of the cities<sup><xref rid="fn2442">3</xref></sup> of Jebus, and we will sell unto thee the Cave of Machpelah by a purchase with gold and by a perpetual deed and for a perpetual possession. He made with them a covenant with an oath that the Israelites would not take possession of the city of Jebus<sup><xref rid="fn2443">4</xref></sup> save by the consent of the sons of Jebus, and afterwards he bought the Cave of Machpelah by a purchase with gold, and a perpetual deed, for a perpetual possession,<sup><xref rid="fn2444">5</xref></sup> (as it is said), &#x201C;And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron;<sup><xref rid="fn2445">6</xref></sup> and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the hearing of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 16).</p>
<p>What did the men of Jebus do? They made images of copper, and set them up in the street of the city, and wrote upon them the covenant of the oath of Abraham. When the Israelites came to the land (of Canaan), they wished to enter the city of the Jebusites,<sup><xref rid="fn2446">7</xref></sup> but they were not able (to enter),<sup><xref rid="fn2447">1</xref></sup> because of the sign of the covenant of Abraham&#x2019;s oath,<sup><xref rid="fn2448">2</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And the children of Benjamin did not drive out<sup><xref rid="fn2449">3</xref></sup> the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem&#x201D; (Judg. i. 21). &#x007C;&#x007C; When David reigned<sup><xref rid="fn2450">4</xref></sup> he desired to enter the city of the Jebusites, (but) they did not allow him, as it is said, &#x201C;And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land; which<sup><xref rid="fn2451">5</xref></sup> spake unto David, saying, Thou shalt not come in hither&#x201D; (2 Sam. v. 6).</p>
<p>(Although) the Israelites were like the sand of the sea,<sup><xref rid="fn2452">6</xref></sup> yet it was owing to the force of the sign of the covenant of Abraham&#x2019;s oath.<sup><xref rid="fn2453">7</xref></sup> David saw (this) and turned backwards, as it is said, &#x201C;And David dwelt in the stronghold&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 9).<sup><xref rid="fn2454">8</xref></sup> They said to him: Thou wilt not be able to enter the city of the Jebusites until thou hast removed all those images upon which the sign of the covenant of Abraham&#x2019;s oath is written,<sup><xref rid="fn2455">9</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Except thou take away the blind and the lame&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 6). &#x201C;The lame&#x201D; refers to the images, as it is said, &#x201C;Wherefore they say, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 8). Lest thou shouldst say, The blind and the lame did not enter the Sanctuary, Heaven forbid (that we should say this), but these &#x201C;blind and lame&#x201D; refer to the images which have eyes and see not, feet and they walk not, (as it is said),<sup><xref rid="fn2456">10</xref></sup> &#x201C;That are hated of David&#x2019;s soul&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). Because David hated to hear of and to see idolatry, as it is said, &#x201C;Wherefore they say, The blind and the lame shall <italic>not</italic> come into the house&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>David said to his men: Whoever will go up first, and remove those images upon which the sign of the covenant of Abraham&#x2019;s oath<sup><xref rid="fn2457">1</xref></sup> is written, he shall be the chief.<sup><xref rid="fn2458">2</xref></sup> And Joab, the son of Zeruiah, went up,<sup><xref rid="fn2459">3</xref></sup> and he became the chief, as it is said, &#x201C;And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, &#x007C;&#x007C; and was made chief&#x201D; (1 Chron. xi. 6). Afterwards he<sup><xref rid="fn2460">4</xref></sup> bought the city of the Jebusites for Israel by a purchase with gold and with a perpetual deed for a perpetual possession. What did David do? He took from each tribe fifty shekels; verily all of them amounted to six hundred shekels,<sup><xref rid="fn2461">5</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;So David gave to Ornan<sup><xref rid="fn2462">6</xref></sup> for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxi. 25).</p>
<p>Isaac<sup><xref rid="fn2463">7</xref></sup> made a covenant with the people of the land, when he sojourned in the land of the Philistines. He noticed that they turned their faces away from him. He went away from them in peace, and Abimelech and all his magnates<sup><xref rid="fn2464">8</xref></sup> came after him. He said to them: Ye turned aside your faces from me, and now ye come unto me, as it is said, &#x201C;And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore are ye come unto me,<sup><xref rid="fn2465">9</xref></sup> seeing ye hate me?&#x201D; (Gen. xxvi. 27). &#x201C;And they said, We saw plainly that the Lord was with thee&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 28). They said: We know that the Holy One, blessed be He, will give to thy seed in the future all these lands; make a covenant of an oath with us, that thy seed will not take possession of the land of the Philistines. He made a covenant of an oath with them.<sup><xref rid="fn2466">10</xref></sup> What did Isaac do? He cut off one cubit<sup><xref rid="fn2467">11</xref></sup> of the bridle of the ass upon which he was riding, and he gave it to them that it might be in their hands<sup><xref rid="fn2468">1</xref></sup> for a sign of the covenant of the oath.</p>
<p>When David reigned, he desired to enter the land of the Philistines, but he was unable (to do so) because of the power of the sign of the covenant<sup><xref rid="fn2469">2</xref></sup> oath of &#x007C;&#x007C; Isaac, until he had taken from them the sign of the covenant of Isaac&#x2019;s oath, as it is said, &#x201C;And David took the bridle of the cubit<sup><xref rid="fn2470">3</xref></sup> out of the hand of the Philistines&#x201D; (2 Sam. viii. 1),<sup><xref rid="fn2471">4</xref></sup> as it is written, &#x201C;So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more within the border of Israel&#x201D; (1 Sam. vii. 13).<sup><xref rid="fn2472">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Jacob made a covenant with the people of the land, because Laban said to him: I know that the Holy One, blessed be He, will give to thy seed in the future all these lands; make a covenant of an oath with me, that the Israelites will not take possession of the land of Edom.<sup><xref rid="fn2473">6</xref></sup> He<sup><xref rid="fn2474">7</xref></sup> made with him a covenant with an oath, as it is said, &#x201C;And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather ye stones&#x201D; (Gen. xxxi. 46). Were they his brethren? Were they not his sons? But this teaches thee that a man&#x2019;s sons are like his brethren.<sup><xref rid="fn2475">8</xref></sup> Laban said to him: If the Israelites obtain possession of the land (of Canaan), then they must not come into the land of Edom<sup><xref rid="fn2476">9</xref></sup> for an evil purpose,<sup><xref rid="fn2477">10</xref></sup> and if Edom obtain possession they must not come into the land of Israel for evil, as it is said, &#x201C;That I will not pass over this heap to thee,<sup><xref rid="fn2478">1</xref></sup> and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 52).</p>
<p>When David reigned, he wished to come into the land of Edom,<sup><xref rid="fn2479">2</xref></sup> but he was unable on account of the power of the covenant of Jacob&#x2019;s oath until he had broken that pillar. Concerning this, Solomon<sup><xref rid="fn2480">3</xref></sup> said: &#x201C;And break in pieces their pillars&#x201D; (Ex. xxiii. 24). Afterwards he conquered the land of Edom,<sup><xref rid="fn2479">2</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;David smote also Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah,<sup><xref rid="fn2481">4</xref></sup> as he went to recover his dominion at the river&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2482">5</xref></sup> (2 Sam. viii. 3).<sup><xref rid="fn2483">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>CHAPTER XXXVII</title>
<h1><small>JACOB AND THE ANGEL</small> [49<small>A</small>. ii.]</h1>
<p>&#x201C;As if a man did flee from a lion &#x007C;&#x007C; and a bear met him&#x201D; (Amos v. 19). The &#x201C;lion&#x201D; means Laban, who pursued (Jacob) like a lion to destroy<sup><xref rid="fn2488">1</xref></sup> his life. The &#x201C;bear&#x201D; refers to Esau, who stood by the way like a bear bereaved by man,<sup><xref rid="fn2489">2</xref></sup> to slay the mother with the children. The lion is shamefaced, the bear is not shamefaced.<sup><xref rid="fn2490">3</xref></sup> Jacob arose and prayed before the Holy One, blessed be He, saying: Sovereign of all the Universe &#x0021; Hast Thou not spoken thus unto me, &#x201C;Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred, and I will be with thee&#x201D;? (Gen. xxxi. 3).</p>
<p>And behold, Esau, the evil one, has now come to slay me; but I fear him and he does not fear Thee. Hence (the sages) say: Do not fear an executive officer or a ruler, but (fear) a man who has no fear of Heaven. (Esau) stood by the way like a bear bereaved by man, to slay mother and child.</p>
<p>What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He sent an angel<sup><xref rid="fn2491">4</xref></sup> to him to deliver him, and to save him from the hand<sup><xref rid="fn2492">5</xref></sup> of Esau; and he appeared unto him like a man, as it is said, &#x201C;And there wrestled <italic>a man</italic> with him<sup><xref rid="fn2493">6</xref></sup> until the breaking of the day&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxxii. 24). As soon as the dawn appeared, the angel said to him: Let me go, for the time has arrived when I must stand<sup><xref rid="fn2494">1</xref></sup> to sing<sup><xref rid="fn2495">2</xref></sup> and to chant praises before the Holy One, blessed be He. But Jacob did not wish to let him go. What did the angel do? He began to sing and to chant praises from the earth, &#x007C;&#x007C; and when the angels (on high) heard the voice of the angel who was singing and praising from the earth, they said: Because of the honour of the righteous (one) do we hear<sup><xref rid="fn2496">3</xref></sup> the voice of the angel who is singing and praising from the earth; and concerning him the verse says, &#x201C;From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs,<sup><xref rid="fn2497">4</xref></sup> glory to the righteous&#x201D; (Isa. xxiv. 16).</p>
<p>Again the angel said to him: &#x201C;Let me go&#x201D; (Gen. xxxii. 26). Jacob answered him: I will not let thee go until thou hast blessed me;<sup><xref rid="fn2498">5</xref></sup> and he blessed him, as it is said, &#x201C;And he blessed him there&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 29). Again he said to him: &#x201C;Let me go&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 26). He answered him: I will not let thee go until thou tellest me what thy name<sup><xref rid="fn2499">6</xref></sup> is. And (the angel) called his name Israel<sup><xref rid="fn2500">7</xref></sup> like his own name, for his own name was called Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn2501">8</xref></sup> Jacob wished to prevail over the angel, and to throw him down upon the earth. What did the angel do? He took hold of the sinew of the hip, which was upon the hollow of Jacob&#x2019;s thigh, and he lifted the sinew of his hip (out of its place), and it became like the fat<sup><xref rid="fn2502">1</xref></sup> of the dead. Therefore the children of Israel are forbidden to eat of the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the animal&#x2019;s thigh, as it is said, &#x201C;Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 82).</p>
<p>Jacob wished to cross the ford of the Jabbok, and he was detained<sup><xref rid="fn2503">2</xref></sup> there. The angel said to him: Didst thou not speak thus<sup><xref rid="fn2504">3</xref></sup>&#x2014;&#x201C;Of all that thou shalt give me<sup><xref rid="fn2505">4</xref></sup> I will surely give a tenth unto thee&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxviii. 22)? What did our father Jacob do? He took &#x007C;&#x007C; all the cattle in his possession which he had brought from Paddan-Aram, and he gave a tithe of them amounting to 550 (animals).<sup><xref rid="fn2506">5</xref></sup> Hence thou mayest learn that all the cattle in the possession of our father Jacob, which he had brought from Paddan-Aram, amounted to 5500 (animals).<sup><xref rid="fn2507">6</xref></sup> Again Jacob wished to cross the ford of the Jabbok, but he was hindered here. The angel said: Didst thou not speak thus&#x2014;&#x201C;<italic>Of all</italic> that thou shalt give me<sup><xref rid="fn2508">7</xref></sup> I will surely give a tenth unto thee&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>)? Behold, thou hast sons. Thou hast not given a tithe of them. What did Jacob do? He put apart the four firstborn<sup><xref rid="fn2509">8</xref></sup> children of the four mothers, and eight children remained. He began (to count) from Simeon, and finished with Benjamin, who was still in his mother&#x2019;s womb.<sup><xref rid="fn2510">9</xref></sup> Again he began (to count) from Simeon, and he included Benjamin, and Levi was reckoned as the tithe, holy to God, as it is said, &#x201C;The tenth shall be holy unto the Lord&#x201D; (Lev. xxvii. 82).</p>
<p>Rabbi Ishmael said: All firstborns are required to have a tithe taken (only) when they fall under the observation<sup><xref rid="fn2511">1</xref></sup> of the eye.<sup><xref rid="fn2512">2</xref></sup> Only Jacob observed the law of tithe in advance; he began with Benjamin, who was in his mother&#x2019;s womb, and Levi was reckoned as holy to the Lord,<sup><xref rid="fn2513">3</xref></sup> and concerning him the Scripture says, &#x201C;The tenth shall be holy unto the Lord&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>Michael, the angel, descended and took Levi, and brought him up before the Throne of Glory,<sup><xref rid="fn2514">4</xref></sup> and he spake before Him: Sovereign of all &#x007C;&#x007C; the universe &#x0021; This is Thy lot,<sup><xref rid="fn2515">5</xref></sup> and the portion<sup><xref rid="fn2516">6</xref></sup> of Thy works.<sup><xref rid="fn2517">7</xref></sup> And He put forth His right hand and blessed him, that the sons of Levi should minister on earth<sup><xref rid="fn2518">8</xref></sup> before Him, like the ministering angels in heaven.<sup><xref rid="fn2519">9</xref></sup> Michael spake before the Holy One, blessed be He: Sovereign of all worlds &#x0021; Do not such who serve the king have provision of their food given to them? Therefore He gave to the sons of Levi all holy things which accrue to His Name,<sup><xref rid="fn2520">10</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;They shall eat the offerings of the Lord made by fire, and his inheritance&#x201D; (Deut. xviii. 1).</p>
<p>When Jacob passed to come into the land of Canaan, Esau came to him from Mount Seir in violent anger, contriving to slay him, as it is said, &#x201C;The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth&#x201D; (Ps. xxxvii. 12). Esau said: I will not slay Jacob with bow and arrows, but with my mouth and with my teeth will I slay him, and suck his blood, as it is said, &#x201C;And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him; and they wept&#x201D; (Gen. xxxiii. 4). Do not read <italic>vayishak&#x00EA;hu</italic> (and he kissed him), but (read) <italic>vayishk&#x00EA;hu</italic> (and he bit him). But Jacob&#x2019;s neck became like ivory, and concerning him the Scripture says, &#x201C;Thy neck is like the tower of ivory&#x201D; (Cant. vii. 4). The wicked (Esau&#x2019;s) teeth became blunt,<sup><xref rid="fn2521">1</xref></sup> and when the wicked one saw that the desire of his heart was not realized he began to be angry, and to gnash with his teeth, as it is said, &#x201C;The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away&#x201D; (Ps. cxii. 10).</p>
<p>Jacob took all the tithe of his possessions and sent it by the hand of his servants, and gave it to Esau, saying to them: Say ye &#x007C;&#x007C; to him, &#x201C;Thus saith thy servant Jacob&#x201D; (Gen. xxxii. 4). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Jacob &#x0021; That which was holy hast thou made profane? He replied to Him: Sovereign of all worlds &#x0021; I flatter the wicked, so that he should not slay me. Hence the (wise men) say, we may flatter the wicked in this world for the sake of the ways of peace.<sup><xref rid="fn2522">2</xref></sup> Esau said to him: O my brother, I have enough; as it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn2523">3</xref></sup> &#x201C;And Esau said, I have enough&#x201D; (Gen. xxxiii. 9). And because he gave honour to Jacob,<sup><xref rid="fn2524">4</xref></sup> therefore the sons of Jacob paid honour to the sons of Esau with the same expression;<sup><xref rid="fn2525">1</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Ye have compassed this mountain long <italic>enough</italic>&#x201D; (Deut. ii. 8). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Jacob &#x0021; Is it not enough for thee that thou hast made profane that which is holy? Nay, but I have said, &#x201C;And the <italic>elder</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2526">2</xref></sup> shall serve the younger&#x201D; (Gen. xxv. 23); and yet thou hast said, &#x201C;Thy servant Jacob&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxxii. 4). By thy life &#x0021; it shall be according to thy words; he shall rule over thee in this world, and thou shalt rule over him in the world to come. Therefore Jacob said to him (Esau): &#x201C;Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxxiii. 14). Hence thou mayest learn that the sons of Esau will not fall until a remnant from Jacob shall come, and cut off the feet of the children of Esau from Mount Seir,<sup><xref rid="fn2527">3</xref></sup> and the Holy One, blessed be He, will descend.<sup><xref rid="fn2528">4</xref></sup> &#x201C;And there shall not be any remaining to the house of Esau;<sup><xref rid="fn2529">5</xref></sup> for the Lord hath spoken it&#x201D; (Obad. 18).</p>

The idea of this Haggadah seems to be: the angel is named according to the mission entrusted to him by God. Here it was to announce the ideal for Jacob to pursue, namely, that he was to live as Israel, the warrior of God, destined in his seed to do battle with everything which opposes the establishment on earth of the Kingdom of God. Therefore the angel is named Israel. Israel must fear neither man nor angel; he has prevailed over the powers above man, and need fear only God. See Judg. xiii. 3 ff. for the case of the angel and Manoah, where the same principle obtains. The angel is called <span dir="rtl">&#x05E4;&#x05DC;&#x05D0;&#x05D9;</span>, which suggests <span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05E4;&#x05DC;&#x05D0;&#x05D4;</span>, &#x201C;the separation&#x201D; involved in the Nazirate of Samson. It may also be that the angel was the guardian angel of Israel and therefore bore the name &#x201C;Israel.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER XXXVIII</title>
<h1><small>JOSEPH AND HIS BRETHREN</small> [50<small>B</small>. i.]</h1>
<p>&#x201C;O<small>R</small> went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall, and the serpent bit him&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2530">1</xref></sup> (Amos v. 19). When Jacob went into his house in the land of Canaan<sup><xref rid="fn2531">2</xref></sup> the serpent bit him. &#x007C;&#x007C; And who was the serpent? This was Shechem, the son of Chamor.<sup><xref rid="fn2532">3</xref></sup> Because the daughter of Jacob was abiding in the tents, and she did not go into the street;<sup><xref rid="fn2533">4</xref></sup> what did Shechem, the son of Chamor, do? He brought dancing girls who were (also) playing on pipes<sup><xref rid="fn2534">5</xref></sup> in the streets.<sup><xref rid="fn2535">6</xref></sup> Dinah went forth to see those girls who were making merry; and he seized her,<sup><xref rid="fn2536">7</xref></sup> and he slept with her, and she conceived and bare Asenath.<sup><xref rid="fn2537">8</xref></sup> The sons of Israel said that she should be killed, for they said that now people would say in all the land<sup><xref rid="fn2538">9</xref></sup> that there was an immoral daughter<sup><xref rid="fn2539">10</xref></sup> in the tents of Jacob.</p>
<p>What did (Jacob)<sup><xref rid="fn2540">1</xref></sup> do? He wrote the Holy Name upon a golden plate,<sup><xref rid="fn2541">2</xref></sup> and suspended it about her<sup><xref rid="fn2542">3</xref></sup> neck and sent her away. She went her way. Everything is revealed before the Holy One, blessed be He, and Michael the angel descended<sup><xref rid="fn2543">4</xref></sup> and took her, and brought her down to Egypt to the house of Potiphera; because Asenath was destined to become the wife of Joseph.<sup><xref rid="fn2544">5</xref></sup> Now the wife of Potiphera was barren, and (Asenath) grew up with her as a daughter.<sup><xref rid="fn2545">6</xref></sup> When Joseph came down to Egypt he married her, as it is said, &#x201C;And he<sup><xref rid="fn2546">7</xref></sup> gave him<sup><xref rid="fn2547">8</xref></sup> to wife Asenath<sup><xref rid="fn2548">9</xref></sup> the daughter of Potiphera priest of On&#x201D; (Gen. xli. 45).</p>
<p>Simeon and Levi were moved by a great zeal on account of the immorality, as it is said, &#x201C;And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxxiv. 31). And each man<sup><xref rid="fn2549">10</xref></sup> took his sword and slew all the men of Shechem. When Jacob heard thereof, he became sorely afraid.<sup><xref rid="fn2550">11</xref></sup> For he said: Now all the people of the land will hear, and they will gather together against me &#x007C;&#x007C; and smite me. He began to curse the wrath of his sons, as it is said, &#x201C;Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xlix. 7); and he also cursed their sword<sup><xref rid="fn2551">12</xref></sup> in the Greek language, for he said: &#x201C;Weapons of violence are their <italic>swords</italic>&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2552">1</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic> 5).<sup><xref rid="fn2553">2</xref></sup> All the kings<sup><xref rid="fn2554">3</xref></sup> of the earth heard (thereof) and feared very much, saying: If two sons of Jacob have done all these great things, if they all band themselves together, they will be able to destroy the world.<sup><xref rid="fn2555">4</xref></sup> And the dread of the Holy One, blessed be He, fell upon them, as it is said, &#x201C;And the terror of God<sup><xref rid="fn2556">5</xref></sup> was<sup><xref rid="fn2557">6</xref></sup> upon the cities,&#x2026; and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxxv. 5).</p>
<p>Jacob took his sons and his grandsons,<sup><xref rid="fn2558">7</xref></sup> and his wives, and he went to Kirjath Arba (so as to be) near Isaac his father. And he found there Esau and his sons and his wives dwelling in the tents of Isaac.<sup><xref rid="fn2559">8</xref></sup> And he spread his tent apart from him;<sup><xref rid="fn2560">9</xref></sup> and Isaac saw Jacob, his wives,<sup><xref rid="fn2561">10</xref></sup> his daughters, and all that belonged to him, and he rejoiced in his heart exceedingly. Concerning him the Scripture saith, &#x201C;Yea, thou shalt see thy children&#x2019;s children, <italic>peace be upon Israel</italic>&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2562">11</xref></sup> (Ps. cxxviii. 6).</p>
<p>Rabbi Levi said: In the hour of the ingathering<sup><xref rid="fn2563">12</xref></sup> of Isaac, he left his cattle and his possessions, and all that he had, to his two sons; therefore they both rendered loving-kindness (to him), as it is said, &#x201C;And Esau and Jacob his sons buried him&#x201D; (Gen. xxxv. 29).</p>
<p>Esau said to Jacob: Divide all that my father has left into two portions, and I will choose<sup><xref rid="fn2564">13</xref></sup> (first), because I am the elder.<sup><xref rid="fn2565">14</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C; Jacob said: This wicked man has not satisfied his eye with wealth, as it is said, &#x201C;Neither are his eyes satisfied with riches&#x201D; (Eccles. iv. 8). What did Jacob do? He divided all that his father had left as the one part, and the other part was to be the land of Israel and the Cave of Machpelah.<sup><xref rid="fn2566">1</xref></sup> What did Esau do? He went to Ishmael<sup><xref rid="fn2567">2</xref></sup> in the wilderness in order to consult him, as it is said, &#x201C;And Esau went unto Ishmael&#x201D; (Gen. xxviii. 9). Ishmael said to Esau: The Amorite and the Canaanite<sup><xref rid="fn2568">3</xref></sup> are in the land, and Jacob trusts (in God) that he will inherit the land, therefore take all that thy father has left, and Jacob will have nothing.<sup><xref rid="fn2569">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>And Esau took all that his father had left, and he gave to Jacob the land of Israel, and the Cave of Machpelah, and they wrote a perpetual deed between them.<sup><xref rid="fn2570">5</xref></sup> Jacob said to Esau: Go from the land of my possession, from the land of Canaan. Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all that he had, [as it is said, &#x201C;And Esau took his wives&#x2026; and all his possessions which he had gathered in the land of Canaan],<sup><xref rid="fn2571">6</xref></sup> and went into a land<sup><xref rid="fn2572">7</xref></sup> away from his brother Jacob&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxxvi. 6). And as a reward<sup><xref rid="fn2573">8</xref></sup> because he removed all his belongings on account of Jacob his brother, He gave him one hundred provinces from Seir unto Magdiel, and Magdiel is Rome, as it is said, &#x201C;Duke Magdiel, Duke Iram&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 43).<sup><xref rid="fn2574">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Then Jacob dwelt safely and in peace in the land of his possession,<sup><xref rid="fn2575">1</xref></sup> and in the land of his birth, and in the land of the sojournings of his father.<sup><xref rid="fn2576">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Ishmael said: Every son of the old age &#x007C;&#x007C; is beloved of his father, as it is said, &#x201C;Now Israel loved Joseph<sup><xref rid="fn2577">3</xref></sup> more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxxvii. 3). Was he then the son of his old age? Was not Benjamin the son of his old age?<sup><xref rid="fn2578">4</xref></sup> But owing to the fact that (Jacob) saw by his prophetic power that (Joseph) would rule<sup><xref rid="fn2579">5</xref></sup> in the future, therefore he loved him more than all his sons. And they envied him with a great envy, as it is said, &#x201C;And his brethren saw that<sup><xref rid="fn2577">3</xref></sup> their father loved him more than all his brethren; and they hated him&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 4). Further, because he saw in his dream that in the future he would rule, and he told his father, and they envied him yet more and more, as it is said, &#x201C;And they hated<sup><xref rid="fn2577">3</xref></sup> him yet the more&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 8). Moreover, he saw the sons of his father&#x2019;s concubines<sup><xref rid="fn2580">6</xref></sup> eating the flesh of the roes and the flesh of the sheep whilst they were alive,<sup><xref rid="fn2581">7</xref></sup> and he brought a reproach<sup><xref rid="fn2582">8</xref></sup> against them before Jacob their father, so that they could not see his face any more (in peace), as it is said, &#x201C;And they could not speak peaceably unto him&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 4). Jacob said to Joseph: Joseph, my son &#x0021; Verily I have (waited) many days without hearing of the welfare of thy brethren, and of the welfare of the flock, as it is said, &#x201C;Go now, see whether it be well with thy brethren,<sup><xref rid="fn2583">1</xref></sup> and well with the flock&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 14). And the lad<sup><xref rid="fn2584">2</xref></sup> was wandering<sup><xref rid="fn2585">3</xref></sup> in the field, and the angel Gabriel<sup><xref rid="fn2586">4</xref></sup> met him, as it is said, &#x201C;And a certain <italic>man</italic> found him, and, behold, he was wandering<sup><xref rid="fn2587">5</xref></sup> in the field&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 15). (The word) &#x201C;man&#x201D; (here in this context) is Gabriel only, as it is said, &#x201C;The <italic>man</italic> Gabriel,<sup><xref rid="fn2587">5</xref></sup> whom I had seen in the vision&#x201D; (Dan. ix. 21).</p>
<p>And (Gabriel) said to him: What seekest thou? He said to him: I seek my brethren, as it is said, &#x201C;And he said, I seek my brethren&#x201D; (Gen. xxxvii. 16). And he led him to &#x007C;&#x007C; his brethren, and they saw him and sought to slay him, as it is said, &#x201C;And they saw him afar off&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 18). Reuben said to them: Do not shed his blood, as it is said, &#x201C;And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood;<sup><xref rid="fn2587">5</xref></sup> cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 22). And<sup><xref rid="fn2588">6</xref></sup> his brethren listened to him, and they took Joseph and cast him into the pit, as it is said, &#x201C;And they took him, and cast him into the pit&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 24). What did Reuben do? He went and stayed on one of the mountains, so as to go down by night to bring up Joseph out of the pit. And his nine brethren were sitting down<sup><xref rid="fn2589">7</xref></sup> in one place, all of them like one man, with one heart and one plan.<sup><xref rid="fn2590">8</xref></sup> Ishmaelites passed by them, and (the brethren) said: Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and they will lead him to the end of the wilderness, and Jacob will not hear any further report concerning him.</p>
<p>(The brethren) sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces<sup><xref rid="fn2591">1</xref></sup> of silver, and each one of them took two pieces of silver (apiece) to purchase shoes for their feet, as it is said, &#x201C;Thus saith the Lord,&#x2026; Because they have sold<sup><xref rid="fn2592">2</xref></sup> the righteous for <italic>silver</italic>, and the needy for a pair of <italic>shoes</italic>&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2593">3</xref></sup> (Amos ii. 6). They said: Let us swear<sup><xref rid="fn2594">4</xref></sup> among ourselves that no one of us shall declare the matter to our father Jacob.<sup><xref rid="fn2595">5</xref></sup> Judah said to them: Reuben is not here, and the ban cannot be valid through nine (adults).<sup><xref rid="fn2596">6</xref></sup> What did they do? They associated the Omnipresent with them and proclaimed the ban.</p>
<p>And Reuben &#x007C;&#x007C; went down by night to bring up Joseph out of the pit, but he did not find him there.<sup><xref rid="fn2597">7</xref></sup> He said to them: Ye have slain Joseph; &#x201C;and I, whither shall I go?&#x201D; (Gen. xxxvii. 80). And they told him what they had done, and the ban which they had proclaimed; and Reuben heard of the ban, and was silent; the Holy One, blessed be He, because of the ban, did not tell the matter to Jacob, and (though) concerning Him it is written, &#x201C;He sheweth his word unto Jacob&#x201D; (Ps. cxlvii. 19); but this word He did not shew unto Jacob, therefore Jacob did not know what had been done to Joseph, and he said: &#x201C;Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces&#x201D; (Gen. xxxvii. 33).</p>
<p>Rabbi Jannai said: The sale of Joseph was not atoned by the tribes<sup><xref rid="fn2598">8</xref></sup> until they<sup><xref rid="fn2599">9</xref></sup> died, as it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord of hosts revealed Himself in mine ears, Surely this iniquity shall not be purged<sup><xref rid="fn2600">1</xref></sup> from you till ye die&#x201D; (Isa. xxii. 14).<sup><xref rid="fn2601">2</xref></sup> Owing to the sale (of Joseph) a famine came into the land of Israel for seven years, and the brethren of Joseph &#x201C;went down to buy corn&#x201D; (Gen. xlii. 3) in Egypt. And they found Joseph (still) living, and they absolved themselves of the ban;<sup><xref rid="fn2602">3</xref></sup> and Jacob heard about Joseph that he was living, and his soul and his spirit revived.<sup><xref rid="fn2603">4</xref></sup> Did their father Jacob&#x2019;s spirit die, so that it had to be revived? But, owing to the ban, the Holy Spirit had departed from him, and when they had removed the ban the Holy Spirit rested on him as at first; that &#x007C;&#x007C; is what is written, &#x201C;The spirit of Jacob their father revived&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xlv. 27).<sup><xref rid="fn2604">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: The ban is as much as the oath, and an oath is as much as the ban; and everyone who violates the ban is as though he had violated the oath, and everyone who violates the oath is as though he had violated the ban. Everyone who knows the matter and does not declare<sup><xref rid="fn2605">6</xref></sup> it, the ban falls upon him and destroys his timber and his stones, as it is said, &#x201C;I will cause it to go forth, saith the Lord&#x2026; and it shall enter into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name&#x2026; and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof&#x201D; (Zech. v. 4).<sup><xref rid="fn2606">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Know the power of the ban.<sup><xref rid="fn2607">8</xref></sup> Come and see from Joshua, the son of Nun, who put Jericho under the ban; it was to be burnt with all things therein by fire. Achan, son of Carmi,<sup><xref rid="fn2608">1</xref></sup> son of Zerach, saw the Teraphim,<sup><xref rid="fn2609">2</xref></sup> and the silver which they brought (as offerings) before it, and the mantle which was spread before it, and one tongue of gold in its mouth. And in his heart he coveted them, and went and<sup><xref rid="fn2610">3</xref></sup> buried them in the midst of his tent. On account of his trespass which he had committed, thirty-six righteous men died on his account,<sup><xref rid="fn2611">4</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And the men of Ai smote of them<sup><xref rid="fn2612">5</xref></sup> about thirty and six men&#x201D; (Josh. vii. 5).</p>
<p>Joshua went and rent his garments, and fell upon his face to the ground before the Ark of the Covenant of God, and he sought (to effect) repentance, and the Holy One, blessed be He, was appeased by him, and He said to him: Joshua &#x0021; Israel has trespassed the sin of trespass in the matter of the devoted things, as it is said, &#x201C;Israel hath sinned&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 11). Joshua gazed at the twelve &#x007C;&#x007C; stones which were upon the High Priest, which correspond to the twelve tribes.<sup><xref rid="fn2613">6</xref></sup> Every tribe that had done some transgression, the light (of its stone) became dim,<sup><xref rid="fn2614">7</xref></sup> and he saw the stone of the tribe of Judah,<sup><xref rid="fn2615">8</xref></sup> the light of which became dim. And he knew that the tribe of Judah had transgressed in the matter of the devoted thing. He cast lots, and Achan was taken, as it is said, &#x201C;And he brought near<sup><xref rid="fn2616">9</xref></sup> his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, was taken&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 18). Joshua took Achan, the son of Zerach,<sup><xref rid="fn2617">10</xref></sup> with the silver and the mantle and the tongue of gold, and his sons and his daughters, and all that he had, and he brought them up into the valley of Achor.<sup><xref rid="fn2618">1</xref></sup> And it is written, &#x201C;The fathers shall not be put to death for the children,<sup><xref rid="fn2619">2</xref></sup> neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers&#x201D; (Deut. xxiv. 16). But because they were cognizant of the matter, and did not report it,<sup><xref rid="fn2620">3</xref></sup> he stoned them and burnt them.<sup><xref rid="fn2621">4</xref></sup> If there was a burning, why (was there) a stoning, and if a stoning, why a burning? But the stoning was because they knew of the matter and did not report it; burning (was inflicted) because thirty-six righteous men died through him,<sup><xref rid="fn2622">5</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And the men of Ai smote of them<sup><xref rid="fn2623">6</xref></sup> about thirty and six men&#x201D; (Josh. vii. 5).</p>
<p>Because (Achan) confessed<sup><xref rid="fn2624">7</xref></sup> before the Name of the Holy One, blessed be He, he has a portion in the world to come, as it is said, &#x201C;And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us?<sup><xref rid="fn2625">8</xref></sup> The Lord shall trouble thee <italic>this day</italic>&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 25). &#x201C;This day&#x201D; thou art troubled, but thou shalt not be troubled in the future world.<sup><xref rid="fn2626">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Know thou the power of the ban. Come and see from the (story of) the tribes, who were zealous because of immorality against &#x007C;&#x007C; the tribe of Benjamin.<sup><xref rid="fn2627">10</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them: Ye are zealous because of the immorality,<sup><xref rid="fn2628">11</xref></sup> and ye are not zealous because of the image of Micah. Therefore the Benjamites slew some of them a first and a second<sup><xref rid="fn2629">12</xref></sup> and a third time, until they went<sup><xref rid="fn2630">13</xref></sup> before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord seeking repentance, and they were forgiven. They decreed<sup><xref rid="fn2631">1</xref></sup> that all Israel should (make peace) with them,<sup><xref rid="fn2632">2</xref></sup> and they repented<sup><xref rid="fn2633">3</xref></sup> both old and young, as it is said, &#x201C;For they made a great oath<sup><xref rid="fn2634">4</xref></sup> concerning him that came not up unto the Lord to Mizpah&#x201D; (Judg. xxi. 5). Did all Israel take an oath? But the ban is the same as the oath.</p>
<p>The men of Jabesh-Gilead neither went up nor did they go with them in the assembly, and they incurred (the penalty of) death, as it is said, &#x201C;Concerning him that came not up<sup><xref rid="fn2635">5</xref></sup> unto the Lord to Mizpah, saying, He shall surely be put to death&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>Know thou the power of the ban. Come and see from (the story of) Saul, the son of Kish, who decreed that all people, both young and old, should fast, as it is said, &#x201C;Cursed be the man that eateth any food<sup><xref rid="fn2634">4</xref></sup> until it be evening&#x201D; (1 Sam. xiv. 24). Jonathan did not hear (of this), and ate a little honey,<sup><xref rid="fn2636">6</xref></sup> and his eyes were enlightened,<sup><xref rid="fn2637">7</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And his eyes<sup><xref rid="fn2638">8</xref></sup> were enlightened&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 27). Saul saw the Philistines returning against Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn2639">9</xref></sup> and he knew that Israel had trespassed in the matter of the ban. He looked at the twelve stones;<sup><xref rid="fn2640">10</xref></sup> for each tribe which performed one of the precepts had its stone &#x007C;&#x007C; (on the High Priest&#x2019;s breast-plate) shining with its light, and each tribe which transgressed, the light of its stone was dim.<sup><xref rid="fn2641">11</xref></sup> He knew that the tribe of Benjamin had trespassed in the matter of the ban. He cast lots<sup><xref rid="fn2642">1</xref></sup> concerning Benjamin, and Saul and Jonathan were taken, as it is said, &#x201C;And Jonathan<sup><xref rid="fn2643">2</xref></sup> and Saul<sup><xref rid="fn2644">3</xref></sup> were taken&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 41). Saul took his sword to slay his son, as it is said, &#x201C;God do so,<sup><xref rid="fn2645">4</xref></sup> and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 44). The people said to him: Our lord king &#x0021; It is an error. They brought on his behalf a sacrifice of a burnt offering for his error, and He was entreated of him, and they saved him from an evil death, as it is said, &#x201C;So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 45).<sup><xref rid="fn2646">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Cutheans<sup><xref rid="fn2647">6</xref></sup> are not considered as a nation<sup><xref rid="fn2648">7</xref></sup> of the seventy languages, but they were the remnant of the five nations precious to the king,<sup><xref rid="fn2649">8</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And the king of Assyria brought<sup><xref rid="fn2650">9</xref></sup> men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Avva, and from Hamath and Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel&#x201D; (2 Kings xvii. 24).</p>
<p>Rabbi Jos&#x00E9; said: He added four more nations to them, and they were in all nine nations,<sup><xref rid="fn2651">10</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;The Dinaites, and the Apharsathchites,<sup><xref rid="fn2652">11</xref></sup> the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Shushanchites, the Dehaites, the Elamites, and the rest of the nations&#x2026; set in the city of Samaria&#x201D; (Ezra iv. 9, 10).</p>
<p>And when the Israelites were exiled<sup><xref rid="fn2653">1</xref></sup> from Samaria to Babylon, the king sent his servants, and he caused them to dwell in Samaria, to raise tribute for (his) kingdom. What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He sent lions among them, &#x007C;&#x007C; which killed some of them, as it is said, &#x201C;And so it was, at the beginning of their dwelling there,<sup><xref rid="fn2654">2</xref></sup> that they feared not the Lord: therefore the Lord sent lions among them, which killed some of them&#x201D; (2 Kings xvii. 25).<sup><xref rid="fn2655">3</xref></sup> They sent to the king,<sup><xref rid="fn2656">4</xref></sup> saying: Our lord, the king &#x0021; The land whither thou hast sent us will not receive us, for we are left but a few out of many.<sup><xref rid="fn2657">5</xref></sup> The king sent and called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them: All those years during which ye were in your land, the beasts of the field did not bereave you, and now it will not receive my servants. They gave him a word of advice, (thinking) perhaps he would restore them to their land. They said to him: Our lord, O king&#x0021; That land does not receive a nation who do not study the Torah; behold, that land does not receive a nation who are not circumcised.<sup><xref rid="fn2658">6</xref></sup> The king said to them: Give me two of you, who shall go and circumcise them and teach them the book of the Torah; and there is no refusal to the word of the king. They sent Rabbi Dosethai<sup><xref rid="fn2659">7</xref></sup> of the Court-House,<sup><xref rid="fn2660">8</xref></sup> and Rabbi Micaiah,<sup><xref rid="fn2661">9</xref></sup> and they circumcised them, and they taught them the book of the Torah in the No&#x1E6D;ari&#x1E33;on<sup><xref rid="fn2662">10</xref></sup> script, and they<sup><xref rid="fn2663">1</xref></sup> wept. Those nations followed the statutes of the Torah, and they served (also) their own gods.<sup><xref rid="fn2664">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Ezra came up<sup><xref rid="fn2665">3</xref></sup> (with) Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua, &#x007C;&#x007C; son of Jehozadak, they began to build<sup><xref rid="fn2666">4</xref></sup> the Temple of the Lord, as it is said, &#x201C;Then rose up Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel,<sup><xref rid="fn2667">5</xref></sup> and Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, <italic>and began to build the house of God</italic>&#x201D; (Ezra v. 2). And the Samaritans came against them to fight (with) 180,000 (men).<sup><xref rid="fn2668">6</xref></sup> Were they Samaritans? Were they not Cutheans?<sup><xref rid="fn2669">7</xref></sup> But they were called Samaritans because of the city of Samaria. And further, they sought to kill Nehemiah, as it is said, &#x201C;Come, let us<sup><xref rid="fn2670">8</xref></sup> meet together<sup><xref rid="fn2671">9</xref></sup> in one of the villages,&#x2026; but they thought to do me mischief&#x201D; (Neh. vi. 2). Moreover, they made the work<sup><xref rid="fn2672">10</xref></sup> of the Lord to cease<sup><xref rid="fn2673">11</xref></sup> for two years<sup><xref rid="fn2674">12</xref></sup> [&#x201C;Then <italic>ceased the work of the house of God</italic>, which is at Jerusalem];<sup><xref rid="fn2675">13</xref></sup> and it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius, king of Persia&#x201D; (Ezra iv. 24).</p>
<p>What did Ezra, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua son of Jehozadak, do?<sup><xref rid="fn2676">1</xref></sup> They gathered all the congregation to the Temple of the Lord, and they brought 800 priests, 800 children,<sup><xref rid="fn2677">2</xref></sup> and 800 scrolls of the Torah in their hands,<sup><xref rid="fn2678">3</xref></sup> and they blew<sup><xref rid="fn2679">4</xref></sup> (the trumpets), and the Levites sang songs and praises, and they excommunicated the Cutheans with the mystery of the Ineffable Name, and with the script such as was written upon the tables (of the Law), and by the ban of the heavenly Court of Justice, and by the ban of the earthly Court of Justice (decreeing) that no one of Israel should eat the bread of the Cutheans.<sup><xref rid="fn2680">5</xref></sup> Hence (the sages) said: Everyone who eats the bread<sup><xref rid="fn2681">6</xref></sup> of the Cutheans is as though he had eaten of the flesh of swine.<sup><xref rid="fn2682">7</xref></sup> Let no man make a proselyte in Israel from among the Cutheans.<sup><xref rid="fn2683">8</xref></sup> They have no &#x007C;&#x007C; portion in the resurrection of the dead,<sup><xref rid="fn2684">1</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Ye have nothing to do with us<sup><xref rid="fn2685">2</xref></sup> to build an house unto our God&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 3), neither in this world, nor in the world to come. So that they should have neither portion nor inheritance in Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn2686">3</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;But ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2687">4</xref></sup> (Neh. ii. 20).</p>
<p>They sent the ban (letter) to the Israelites who were in Babylon. Moreover, they added an additional ban upon them, and King Cyrus ordained it as a perpetual ban upon them, (as it is said,)<sup><xref rid="fn2688">5</xref></sup> &#x201C;And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there<sup><xref rid="fn2689">6</xref></sup> overthrow all kings and peoples that shall put forth their hand to alter the same, to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I, Darius, have made a decree; let it be done with all diligence&#x201D; (Ezra vi. 12).</p>

The form of the ban, and the prohibition of eating the bread of the Samaritans, have been exhaustively considered by Dr. B&#x00FC;chler in <italic>R.&#x00C9;.J</italic>. xliii. pp. 50 ff., where the following results are stated: (1) The form of the ban and its accompanying circumstances&#x2014;(<italic>a</italic>) children as witnesses, (<italic>b</italic>) scrolls of law to sanctify the pronouncement, and (<italic>c</italic>) sounding of the Shofar&#x2014;tally with the practice known to the Geonim of Babylon in the ninth century (<italic>e.g</italic>.

Jellinek, <italic>B.H.M</italic>. iii. p. 84). The prohibition of eating the <italic>bread</italic> of the Samaritans mentioned by our author does not find any support in the Talmudic literature (see T.J. Shebi&#x2018;ith vii. 38b, line 69), but is &#x201C;an institution of the Geonic age&#x201D; (p. 64). The decree says that Samaritans could not be received as proselytes. Where the texts of the Talmud speak of <span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;&#x05D9;</span>, &#x201C;Samaritan,&#x201D; we have probably to read <span dir="rtl">&#x05E0;&#x05DB;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;</span>. There was a sect who were put on this footing by the Gaon Na&#x1E6D;ronai (Teshuboth Ha-Geonim, Sha&#x2018;ar&#x00EA; Zede&#x1E33;, p. 24a, Nos. 7 and 27). The Halakhoth Gedoloth (ed. Hildesheimer, 443) states that &#x201C;Cutheans, Seboneans, and <italic>Samaritans</italic> are not to be received as proselytes.&#x201D; This again appears in the Tanna de b&#x00EA; Elijahu &#x1E92;u&#x1E6D;&#x1E6D;a (p. 169). The Karaites in the ninth century mutilated the Bible text, and in their reading agreed with the Samaritans (p. 67). In other words the literature of the Samaritans of the ninth century exercised a baneful influence in creating sects opposed to orthodox Judaism. Hence the ban against them. Moreover, the word for ban (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D7;&#x05E8;&#x05DD;</span>) does not occur in the Talmud (B. Shebu&#x2018;oth, 35b&#x2013;36a), but is common in the Geonic period.

<title>CHAPTER XXXIX</title>
<h1><small>JOSEPH IN EGYPT</small> [53<small>B</small>. ii.]</h1>
<p>T<small>HE</small> fourth descent was (when) He descended into Egypt, (as it is said),<sup><xref rid="fn2690">1</xref></sup> &#x201C;I will go down with thee into Egypt&#x201D; (Gen xlvi. 4). Jacob heard concerning Joseph that he was living, and he was thinking in his heart, saying: Can I forsake the land of my fathers, the land of my birth, the land of the sojournings of my fathers,<sup><xref rid="fn2691">2</xref></sup> the land where the Shekhinah of the Holy One, blessed be He, is in its midst, and shall I go to an unclean land in their midst,<sup><xref rid="fn2692">3</xref></sup> for there is no fear of Heaven therein?<sup><xref rid="fn2693">4</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Jacob, do not fear; &#x201C;I will go down with thee into Egypt,<sup><xref rid="fn2694">5</xref></sup> and I will also surely bring thee up again&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>Jacob heard this word, and he took his<sup><xref rid="fn2695">6</xref></sup> wives,<sup><xref rid="fn2696">7</xref></sup> and his sons, and his daughters, and the daughters of his sons.<sup><xref rid="fn2697">8</xref></sup> Another Scripture says, &#x201C;With his daughter Dinah&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 15). And all that he had, and he brought them to Egypt, as it is said, &#x201C;His sons, and his sons&#x2019; sons &#x007C;&#x007C; with him,&#x201D; etc. (<italic>ibid.</italic> 7). Another Scripture says, &#x201C;With his daughter, Dinah&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 15). Whereas another text says, &#x201C;His daughters&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 7), to teach thee that the daughters of Jacob were the wives of his sons.<sup><xref rid="fn2698">1</xref></sup> And all the seed of Jacob<sup><xref rid="fn2699">2</xref></sup> married their sisters and their blood-relations, so that they should not intermarry with the people of the lands, therefore they were called a true seed, as it is said, &#x201C;Yet I had planted thee a noble vine,<sup><xref rid="fn2700">3</xref></sup> wholly a true seed&#x201D; (Jer. ii. 21).</p>
<p>When they came to the border of Egypt,<sup><xref rid="fn2701">4</xref></sup> all the males were enrolled (in genealogical lists to the number of) sixty-six, Joseph with his two sons in Egypt (made the total) sixty-nine.<sup><xref rid="fn2702">5</xref></sup> And it is written, &#x201C;With seventy persons<sup><xref rid="fn2703">6</xref></sup> thy fathers went down into Egypt&#x201D; (Deut. x. 22).<sup><xref rid="fn2704">7</xref></sup> What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He entered<sup><xref rid="fn2705">8</xref></sup> into the number with them, and the total became seventy, to fulfil that which is said, &#x201C;I will go down with thee<sup><xref rid="fn2706">9</xref></sup> into Egypt&#x201D; (Gen. xlvi. 4). When Israel came up from Egypt all the mighty men were enrolled, (amounting to) 600,000, less one. What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He entered<sup><xref rid="fn2705">8</xref></sup> into the number with them, and their total amounted to 600,000, to fulfil that which is said, &#x201C;I will go down with thee into Egypt,<sup><xref rid="fn2707">10</xref></sup> and I will also surely bring thee up again&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>Rabbi Ishmael said: Ten times<sup><xref rid="fn2708">11</xref></sup> did the sons of Jacob say to Joseph, &#x201C;thy servant, our father.&#x201D; Joseph heard the word, and was silent. Silence gives consent; therefore were ten years deducted from his life.<sup><xref rid="fn2709">1</xref></sup> Joseph heard &#x007C;&#x007C; that his father had come to the border<sup><xref rid="fn2710">2</xref></sup> of Egypt, and he took all the men who had intercourse with him,<sup><xref rid="fn2711">3</xref></sup> and he went to meet his father. All the people go forth to meet the king, but the king does not go forth to meet any man. But this teaches thee that the father of a man is like his king.</p>
<p>Rabbi Phineas said: The Holy Spirit<sup><xref rid="fn2712">4</xref></sup> rested on Joseph from his youth;<sup><xref rid="fn2713">5</xref></sup> and it led him in all matters of wisdom like a shepherd who leads his flock, as it is said, &#x201C;Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn2714">6</xref></sup> thou that leadest Joseph like a flock, thou that sittest upon the cherubim&#x201D; (Ps. lxxx. 1). In all his wisdom a certain woman<sup><xref rid="fn2715">7</xref></sup> enticed<sup><xref rid="fn2716">8</xref></sup> (him), and when he wished to accustom himself to sin,<sup><xref rid="fn2717">9</xref></sup> he saw the image<sup><xref rid="fn2718">10</xref></sup> of his father, and repented concerning it.<sup><xref rid="fn2719">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Three people conquered their passion<sup><xref rid="fn2720">12</xref></sup> before their Creator, and they were Joseph, Boaz, and Palt&#x00EA;, son of Laish. It was fit that twelve tribes should have arisen from Joseph,<sup><xref rid="fn2721">13</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And the <italic>seed</italic> of his hands was active&#x201D; (Gen. xlix. 24), but there remained two (tribes), Manasseh and Ephraim. The woman brought grave charges against him to vex him, and he was confined in prison<sup><xref rid="fn2722">1</xref></sup> for ten years. There he interpreted the dreams of the servants of Pharaoh, (he interpreted for) each one according to his dream just as though the events were taking place before him, as it is said, &#x201C;And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xli. 13).</p>
<p>And he interpreted the dream of &#x007C;&#x007C; Pharaoh when the Holy Spirit rested upon him, as it is said, &#x201C;And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this,<sup><xref rid="fn2723">2</xref></sup> a man in whom the spirit of God is?&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 38).</p>
<p>All the nations came to Joseph to purchase food from Joseph. And Joseph spoke to each people according to their different tongue. And he knew what they were speaking. Therefore his name was called Jehoseph,<sup><xref rid="fn2724">3</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;For Joseph understood them, for there was an interpreter between them&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2725">4</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic> xlii. 23).</p>
<p>Moreover, when he went into the market-place he saw the people forming themselves into various companies and groups, and each one would speak in his own tongue, and he knew what they were saying,<sup><xref rid="fn2726">5</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;He appointed it in Joseph for a testimony,<sup><xref rid="fn2727">6</xref></sup> when he went out over the land of Egypt, when I heard the speech of one that I knew not&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2728">7</xref></sup> (Ps. lxxxi. 5). Further, when he was riding in the chariot, and passed through all the borders of the land of Egypt, the Egyptian girls were climbing<sup><xref rid="fn2729">1</xref></sup> up the walls for his sake, and they threw to him rings of gold, so that perchance he might look at them, and (they could) see the beauty of his<sup><xref rid="fn2730">2</xref></sup> figure, but nobody&#x2019;s eye degraded<sup><xref rid="fn2731">3</xref></sup> him, for he was highly esteemed<sup><xref rid="fn2732">4</xref></sup> in the eyes of everyone, as it is said, &#x201C;Joseph is a <italic>fruitful</italic> bough<sup><xref rid="fn2733">5</xref></sup>&#x2026; his daughters run over the wall&#x201D; (Gen. xlix. 22).<sup><xref rid="fn2734">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>All the nations came to purchase food. And they brought to Joseph their tribute (and) a present (and money) to purchase (food). And he spoke to each people according to their different tongue; &#x007C;&#x007C; therefore was his name called Turgeman,<sup><xref rid="fn2735">7</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;For there was an <italic>interpreter</italic> between them&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2736">8</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic> xlii. 23), therefore was he speaking.<sup><xref rid="fn2737">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Some of them were buying grain on account of the famine in their houses, and they went forth, and others came to buy food; and one asked his fellow as to the price in the market. From their reply they opened the price of the market.<sup><xref rid="fn2738">10</xref></sup> When they came to Joseph he said to them: Just as ye have heard, so it is; in order that the market should not be scarce (and prices dear). Hence (the sages) said: He who makes a corner in the market will never see a sign of blessing.<sup><xref rid="fn2739">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Tanchum<sup><xref rid="fn2740">1</xref></sup> said: Joseph commanded and they built the treasure-houses in each city, and he gathered all the produce of the lands into the treasure-houses. The Egyptians were scoffing at him, saying: Now the worms will eat the stores of Joseph. But no worm had any power over them; neither did the (stores) diminish until the day of his death.<sup><xref rid="fn2741">2</xref></sup> And he supported<sup><xref rid="fn2742">3</xref></sup> the land in the famine of bread, therefore was his name called Kalkol.<sup><xref rid="fn2743">4</xref></sup> And Kalkol is Joseph, as it is said, &#x201C;And Joseph nourished&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2744">5</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic> xlvii. 12). Moreover, he nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father&#x2019;s house, in the famine with bread to their satisfaction. &#x201C;And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father&#x2019;s household, with bread, according to their families&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn2745">6</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C;</p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer said: In the hour of the death of Jacob he called to his son Joseph, and said to him: O my son&#x0021; Swear to me by the covenant of circumcision that thou wilt take me up to the burial-place of my fathers in the land of Canaan to the Cave of Machpelah. The<sup><xref rid="fn2746">7</xref></sup> ancients used to swear by the covenant of circumcision prior to the giving of the Torah, as it is said, &#x201C;Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 29), and &#x201C;he sware unto him&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 31). He kept (the oath) and did (accordingly), as it is said, &#x201C;And he said, Swear unto me&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). And all the mighty men of the kingdom went up with him to bury him, and to show loving-kindness to Jacob his father, as it is said, &#x201C;And Joseph went up to bury his father&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> l. 7). The camp of Israel numbered 5040 (people). All the (people of the) land were bringing food on account of the famine to the camp of Joseph.<sup><xref rid="fn2747">1</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them: Ye have shown loving-kindness<sup><xref rid="fn2748">2</xref></sup> to Jacob, My servant, I also will give you your reward, and also unto your children in this world. When the Egyptians died in the Reed Sea they did not die in the water,<sup><xref rid="fn2749">3</xref></sup> but they were deemed worthy to be buried in the earth. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them: Ye have submitted yourselves<sup><xref rid="fn2750">4</xref></sup> to the divine punishment; I also will give you a place of burial, as it is said, &#x201C;Thou stretchedst forth thy right hand, the earth swallowed them&#x201D; (Ex. xv. 12).<sup><xref rid="fn2751">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>When they came to the Cave of Machpelah, Esau came against them &#x007C;&#x007C; from Mount Horeb<sup><xref rid="fn2752">6</xref></sup> to stir up strife,<sup><xref rid="fn2753">7</xref></sup> saying: The Cave of Machpelah is mine.<sup><xref rid="fn2754">8</xref></sup> What did Joseph do? He sent Naphtali to subdue the constellations,<sup><xref rid="fn2755">9</xref></sup> and to go down to Egypt to bring up the perpetual deed which was between them,<sup><xref rid="fn2756">10</xref></sup> therefore it is said, &#x201C;Naphtali is a hind let loose&#x201D; (Gen. xlix. 21). Chushim, the son of Dan, had defective hearing and speech,<sup><xref rid="fn2757">11</xref></sup> and he said to them: Why are we sitting here? He was pointing (to Esau) with his finger. They said to him: Because this man will not let us bury our father Jacob. What did he do? He drew his sword and cut off Esau&#x2019;s head with the sword, and took the head into the Cave of Machpelah. And they sent his body to the land of his possession, to Mount Seir.</p>
<p>What did Isaac do? He grasped the head of Esau and prayed before the Holy One, blessed be He, and said: Sovereign of all the universe &#x0021; Let mercy be shown<sup><xref rid="fn2758">1</xref></sup> to this wicked one, for he had not learnt all the precepts of the Torah, as it is said, &#x201C;Let favour be shewed to the wicked,<sup><xref rid="fn2759">1</xref></sup> yet will he not learn righteousness&#x201D; (Isa. xxvi. 10). He was speaking in iniquity concerning the land of Israel and the Cave of Machpelah, as it is said, &#x201C;In<sup><xref rid="fn2760">2</xref></sup> the land of uprightness will he deal wrongfully&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit answered him, saying: As I live&#x0021; he shall not see the majesty of God.<sup><xref rid="fn2761">3</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn2757"><sup>11</sup> See the Book of Jashar, ch. lvi., for a parallel account of the legend, which practically agrees with <italic>P.R.E</italic>. According to Charles the legend in the Book of Jashar &#x201C;has borrowed its materials from the Midrash in Josippon&#x201D;; see <italic>Jubilees</italic>, ed. Charles, p. 215, note. Charles refers to Bousset, <italic>Z.f.N.T. Wissensch</italic>., 1900, p. 205. In this connection the legend of the wars between the sons of Jacob and Esau with his sons in Jubilees xxxvii., xxxviii., the Testament of Judah (Test. XII Pat.) ix., and Jera&#x1E25;meel, pp. 80&#x2013;87, must be considered very briefly. According to Charles, &#x201C;the oldest form of the legend is found in Jubilees and in the Test. Jud. ix.; the next oldest is the Jal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D; and Chronicles of Jera&#x1E25;meel, and the latest is the Book of Jashar&#x201D; (<italic>Jubilees</italic>, p. 215). The account in the Book of Jashar contains two parts: (1) the death of Esau by the hands of Chushim, son of Dan, at the burial of Jacob. This part of the legend is taken directly from our book, which was also the source used by Pal. Targum on Gen. l. 13. The source of our Midrash was T.B. So&#x1E6D;ah, <italic>loc. cit</italic>. Then (2) the account of the wars between the sons of Esau and the sons of Jacob which the Book of Jashar gives is undoubtedly connected with the account of Zepho, son of Eliphas, and &#x00C6;neas of Africa, given in the history of Josippon. Now the Chronicles of Jera&#x1E25;meel agree with the Book of Jubilees in making Jacob the slayer of his brother Esau, and they agree in fixing the occasion of the conflict at the mourning for Leah. According to Beer, <italic>Das Buck der Jubil&#x00E4;en</italic>, pp. 4 ff., the original form of the legend was that Judah slew Esau at the burial of Isaac. The death of Esau at the hands of Judah is mentioned in T. J. Kethuboth 1. 5 (p. 25c); T.J. Gi&#x1E6D;&#x1E6D;in v. 6 (p. 47a); Siphr&#x00EA;, Deut. &#x00A7; 348; Shocher &#x1E6C;ob, Ps. xviii. 40 (sect. 32); see also Jal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D;, Gen. &#x00A7; 162; and Jal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D;, Samuel, &#x00A7; 163. The later form of the legend is preserved in T.B. So&#x1E6D;ah, <italic>loc. cit</italic>., which attributes the death of Esau to Chushim, who was deaf and dumb, at the burial of Jacob. Jal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D;, Gen. <italic>loc. cit</italic>., combines both forms of the legend. Jal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D;, Pss. &#x00A7; 776, agrees with our book in the details of the death of Esau. Beer draws attention to the fact that the Jews of Palestine in the time of Hadrian (<italic>c</italic>. 135 <small>C.E.</small>) attributed the fierce hatred on the part of the Romans to the belief that Judah, the forefather of the Jews, had slain Esau, the forefather of the Romans, who were identified with the Edomites descended from Esau. In order to remove the &#x201C;historical&#x201D; foundation for this hostility, later forms of the legend transferred the deed to an irresponsible person, Chushim, whose descendants, the tribe of Dan, had long since disappeared from the land of Israel, having been carried away into exile, and, as some of the Rabbis taught, lost for all time. Jubilees holds to the original legend, owing to the opposition which it represents to the orthodox Rabbinic traditions of Palestine obtaining in the period prior to and following the rise of Christianity. Pirk&#x00EA; de R. Eliezer is aware of the teaching of Jubilees, and tries to correct and refute it on all fundamental points of controversy. This is sometimes done as strikingly by omission as by a variant doctrine, or story.</ftnote>

<h1><small>MOSES AT THE BURNING BUSH</small> [55<small>A</small>. ii.]</h1>
<p>T<small>HE</small> fifth descent<sup><xref rid="fn2762">1</xref></sup> was when He came down to the thorn-bush, as it is said, &#x201C;And I am come down &#x007C;&#x007C; to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians&#x201D; (Ex. iii. 8). He abandoned the entire mountain,<sup><xref rid="fn2763">2</xref></sup> and descended into the thorn-bush, and He abode therein. And the thorn-bush was (an emblem of) grief and distress,<sup><xref rid="fn2764">3</xref></sup> and it was<sup><xref rid="fn2765">4</xref></sup> full of thorns and thistles. Why did He abide in the midst of the thorn-bush which was (an emblem of) grief and distress? Because He saw Israel in great grief and He also dwelt with them,<sup><xref rid="fn2766">5</xref></sup> thus fulfilling that which is said, &#x201C;In all<sup><xref rid="fn2767">6</xref></sup> their affliction He was afflicted&#x201D; (Isa. lxiii. 9).<sup><xref rid="fn2768">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Levi said: That rod<sup><xref rid="fn2769">8</xref></sup> which was created in the twilight<sup><xref rid="fn2770">9</xref></sup> was delivered to the first man<sup><xref rid="fn2771">10</xref></sup> out of the garden of Eden. Adam delivered it to Enoch, and Enoch delivered it to Noah,<sup><xref rid="fn2772">1</xref></sup> and Noah [handed it on]<sup><xref rid="fn2773">2</xref></sup> to Shem. Shem passed it on to Abraham, Abraham [transmitted it]<sup><xref rid="fn2773">2</xref></sup> to Isaac, and Isaac [gave it over]<sup><xref rid="fn2773">2</xref></sup> to Jacob,<sup><xref rid="fn2774">3</xref></sup> and Jacob brought it down into Egypt and passed it on to his son Joseph,<sup><xref rid="fn2775">4</xref></sup> and when Joseph died and they pillaged his household goods, it was placed in the palace of Pharaoh. And Jethro<sup><xref rid="fn2776">5</xref></sup> was one of the magicians of Egypt, and he saw the rod and the letters which were upon it, and he desired in his heart (to have it), and he took it and brought it, and planted it<sup><xref rid="fn2777">6</xref></sup> in the midst of the garden of his house.<sup><xref rid="fn2778">7</xref></sup> No one was able to approach it<sup><xref rid="fn2779">8</xref></sup> any more.</p>
<p>When Moses came to his house he went into the garden of Jethro&#x2019;s house, and saw the rod and read the letters<sup><xref rid="fn2780">9</xref></sup> which were upon it, and he put forth his hand and took it. Jethro watched &#x007C;&#x007C; Moses, and said: This one in the future will redeem Israel from Egypt. Therefore he gave him Zipporah his daughter to wife, as it is said, &#x201C;And Moses was content to dwell with the man;<sup><xref rid="fn2781">10</xref></sup> and he gave Moses Zipporah, his daughter&#x201D; (Ex. ii. 21).</p>
<p>Moses was keeping the sheep of Jethro for forty years,<sup><xref rid="fn2782">1</xref></sup> and the beasts of the field did not consume them, but they increased and multiplied exceedingly,<sup><xref rid="fn2783">2</xref></sup> and concerning them the Scripture saith, &#x201C;As the flock of holy things&#x201D; (Ezek. xxxvi. 38).<sup><xref rid="fn2784">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>And he led the flock until he came to Horeb, as it is said, &#x201C;And he led the flock to the back of the wilderness,<sup><xref rid="fn2785">4</xref></sup> and came to the mountain of God, unto Horeb&#x201D; (Ex. iii. 1). There the Holy One, blessed be He, was revealed unto him from the midst of the thorn-bush. Moses saw the bush burning with fire, and the fire did not consume the bush, and the bush did not extinguish the flames of fire.<sup><xref rid="fn2786">5</xref></sup> Now the bush does not grow in the earth unless it has water beneath it. Moses saw and was wondering very much in his heart, and he said: What kind of glory<sup><xref rid="fn2787">6</xref></sup> is there in its midst? He said: I will now turn aside and see this great sight, why the thorn-bush is not burnt. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Moses &#x0021; Stand where thou art standing, for there in the future will I give the Torah to Israel, as it is said, &#x201C;And he said, Draw not nigh hither;<sup><xref rid="fn2788">7</xref></sup> put off thy shoes from off thy feet,<sup><xref rid="fn2789">8</xref></sup> for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 5). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Go.<sup><xref rid="fn2790">9</xref></sup> Hence (the sages) said: Anyone who enters the Temple<sup><xref rid="fn2791">10</xref></sup> must remove &#x007C;&#x007C; his shoe, for thus spake the Holy One, blessed be He, to Moses: &#x201C;Put off thy shoes from off thy feet&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: &#x201C;Come and I will send thee unto Pharaoh&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 10). He answered before Him: Sovereign of all worlds &#x0021; Have I not spoken thus to Thee three or four times, that I have no power, for I have a defective tongue, as it is said, &#x201C;And Moses said unto the Lord, O Lord, I am not eloquent&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> iv. 10). Not only this, but moreover Thou dost send me into the power of my enemy who seeks my hurt.<sup><xref rid="fn2792">1</xref></sup> For this reason I fled from him, as it is said, &#x201C;But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> ii. 15). He answered him: Do not fear him,<sup><xref rid="fn2793">2</xref></sup> for all the men who sought thy life are already dead.</p>
<p>Were they dead? Were they not alive? Only they had diminished<sup><xref rid="fn2794">3</xref></sup> their wealth. Hence thou mayest learn that all who lose their wealth are as though they were dead, therefore it is said, &#x201C;For all the men are dead who sought thy life&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> iv. 19). (God) said to him: &#x201C;Come and I will send thee unto Pharaoh&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> iii. 10). He replied to Him: Sovereign of all worlds&#x0021; &#x201C;Send by the hand of him whom thou wilt send&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> iv. 13)&#x2014;that is to say, by the hand of that man whom Thou wilt send in the future.<sup><xref rid="fn2795">4</xref></sup> He said to him: I have not said, &#x201C;Come and I will send thee to Israel,&#x201D; but &#x201C;Come and I will send thee unto Pharaoh&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> iii. 10). And as for that man of whom thou sayest that I should send him to Israel in the future that is to come, so it is said, &#x007C;&#x007C; &#x201C;Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet<sup><xref rid="fn2796">5</xref></sup> before the great and terrible day of the Lord come&#x201D; (Mal. iv. 5). &#x201C;And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 6).</p>
<p>(Moses) spake before Him: Sovereign of all worlds &#x0021; Give me a wonder or a sign.<sup><xref rid="fn2797">6</xref></sup> He said to him: Cast thy staff to the ground. He cast his staff to the ground, and it became a fiery serpent. Why did the Holy One, blessed be He, show unto Moses (a sign) with a fiery serpent,<sup><xref rid="fn2798">1</xref></sup> and why did He not show it to him with something else? But just as the serpent bites and kills the sons of man, likewise Pharaoh and his people bit and slew the Israelites. Afterwards it became again like a dry stick. Thus He spake: Likewise Pharaoh and his people shall become like this dry stick,<sup><xref rid="fn2799">2</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord said unto Moses: Put forth thine hand,<sup><xref rid="fn2800">3</xref></sup> and take it by the tail&#x201D; (Ex. iv. 4). He spake before Him: Sovereign of all worlds &#x0021; Give me a wonder. He said to him: &#x201C;Put now thine hand into thy bosom&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 6). And he put his hand into his bosom, and he brought it out leprous like snow. Why did the Holy One, blessed be He, show unto Moses (a sign) by means of an unclean thing, and (why) did He not show it by means of a clean thing? But just as the leper is unclean and causes uncleanliness, likewise Pharaoh and his people were unclean, and they caused Israel to be unclean.<sup><xref rid="fn2801">4</xref></sup> Afterwards (Moses) became clean again,<sup><xref rid="fn2802">5</xref></sup> and He spake to him: Likewise shall Israel become clean from the uncleanliness of the Egyptians, as it is said, &#x201C;And he said, Put now thine hand into thy bosom&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>Why did He show unto Moses the fire in the midst of the thorn-bush? &#x007C;&#x007C; But the fire refers to Israel, who are compared to fire,<sup><xref rid="fn2803">6</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And the house of Jacob shall be a fire&#x201D; (Obad. 18). The thorn-bush refers to the nations of the world,<sup><xref rid="fn2804">7</xref></sup> who are compared to thorns and thistles. He said to him: Likewise shall Israel be in the midst of the nations. The fire of Israel shall not consume the nations, who are compared to thorns and thistles; but the nations of the world shall extinguish the flames of Israel&#x2014;(these flames) are the words of the Torah. But in the future that is to come the fire of Israel will consume all the nations, who are compared to thorns and thistles,<sup><xref rid="fn2805">1</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And the peoples shall be as the burnings of lime&#x201D; (Isa. xxxiii. 12).</p>
<p>Moses said before the Holy One, blessed be He: Sovereign of all worlds&#x0021; Make known to me Thy great and holy Name, that I may call on Thee by Thy Name,<sup><xref rid="fn2806">2</xref></sup> and Thou wilt answer me, as it is said, &#x201C;And God said unto Moses, I am that I am&#x201D; (Ex. iii. 14). &#x201C;And God further said<sup><xref rid="fn2807">3</xref></sup> (to Moses)&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 15).</p>
<p>The angels saw that the Holy One, blessed be He, had transmitted the secret of the Ineffable Name<sup><xref rid="fn2808">4</xref></sup> to Moses, and they rejoined: Blessed art thou, O Lord, who graciously bestoweth knowledge.<sup><xref rid="fn2809">5</xref></sup></p>

<h1><small>THE REVELATION ON SINAI</small> [56<small>B</small>. i.]</h1>
<p>T<small>HE</small> sixth descent<sup><xref rid="fn2810">1</xref></sup> was when He came down on Sinai, as it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai&#x201D; (Ex. xix. 20). On the sixth of Sivan<sup><xref rid="fn2811">2</xref></sup> the Holy One, blessed be He, was revealed unto Israel<sup><xref rid="fn2812">3</xref></sup> on Sinai,<sup><xref rid="fn2813">4</xref></sup> and from His place was He revealed (on) Mount Sinai,<sup><xref rid="fn2814">5</xref></sup> and the heavens were opened, &#x007C;&#x007C; and the summit of the mountain entered into the heavens. Thick darkness covered the mountain, and the Holy One, blessed be He, sat upon His throne, and His feet stood on the thick darkness, as it is said, &#x201C;He bowed the heavens also, and came down;<sup><xref rid="fn2815">6</xref></sup> and thick darkness was under his feet&#x201D; (2 Sam. xxii. 10).<sup><xref rid="fn2816">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi &#x1E6C;arphon said: The Holy One, blessed be He, rose and came from Mount Sinai<sup><xref rid="fn2817">8</xref></sup> and was revealed unto the sons of Esau, as it is said, &#x201C;And he said, The Lord came from Sinai, and rose<sup><xref rid="fn2815">6</xref></sup> from Seir unto them&#x201D; (Deut. xxxiii. 2). And &#x201C;Seir&#x201D; means only the sons of Esau, as it is said, &#x201C;And Esau dwelt in Mount Seir&#x201D; (Gen. xxxvi. 8). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them: Will ye accept for yourselves the Torah? They said to Him: What is written therein? He answered them: It is written therein, &#x201C;Thou shalt do no murder&#x201D; (Ex. xx. 13). They replied to Him: We are unable to abandon the blessing with which Isaac blessed Esau, for he said to him, &#x201C;By thy sword shalt thou live&#x201D; (Gen. xxvii. 40). Thence He turned and was revealed unto the children of Ishmael, as it is said, &#x201C;He shined forth from Mount Paran&#x201D; (Deut. xxxiii. 2). &#x201C;Paran&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2818">1</xref></sup> means only the sons of Ishmael, as it is said, &#x201C;And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran&#x201D; (Gen. xxi. 21). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them: Will ye accept for yourselves the Torah? They said to Him: What is written therein? He answered them: &#x201C;Thou shalt not steal&#x201D; (Ex. xx. 15) is written therein. They said to Him: We are not able to abandon the usage which our fathers observed, for they<sup><xref rid="fn2819">2</xref></sup> brought Joseph down into Egypt, as it is said, &#x201C;For indeed I was stolen away<sup><xref rid="fn2820">3</xref></sup> out of the land of the Hebrews&#x201D; (Gen. xl. 15).<sup><xref rid="fn2821">4</xref></sup> Thence<sup><xref rid="fn2822">5</xref></sup> He sent &#x007C;&#x007C; messengers to all the nations of the world. He said unto them: Will ye receive for yourselves the Torah? They said to Him: What is written therein? He said to them: &#x201C;Thou shalt have no other gods before me&#x201D; (Ex. xx. 3). They said to Him:<sup><xref rid="fn2823">6</xref></sup> We have no delight in the Torah, therefore let Him give His Torah to His people, as it is said, &#x201C;The Lord will give strength<sup><xref rid="fn2824">7</xref></sup> unto his people; the Lord will bless<sup><xref rid="fn2825">8</xref></sup> his people with peace&#x201D; (Ps. xxix. 11).<sup><xref rid="fn2826">9</xref></sup> Thence He returned and was revealed unto the children of Israel, as it is said, &#x201C;And <italic>he came from the ten thousands</italic> of holy ones&#x201D; (Deut. xxxiii. 2). The expression &#x201C;ten thousands&#x201D; means the children of Israel, as it is said, &#x201C;And when it rested, he said,<sup><xref rid="fn2827">1</xref></sup> <italic>Return</italic>, O Lord, <italic>unto the ten thousands</italic> of the thousands of Israel&#x201D; (Num. x. 36). With Him were thousands twice-told of chariots, even twenty thousand<sup><xref rid="fn2828">2</xref></sup> of holy angels,<sup><xref rid="fn2829">3</xref></sup> and His right hand was holding the Torah, as it is said, &#x201C;At his right hand was a fiery law unto them&#x201D; (Deut. xxxiii. 2).</p>
<p>Hence thou mayest learn that the words of the Torah are like coals of fire.<sup><xref rid="fn2830">4</xref></sup> Why was it &#x201C;at his right hand&#x201D;? Whence do we know (that it was given to them) with expression of love? Because it is said, &#x201C;The Lord hath sworn by his right hand,<sup><xref rid="fn2831">5</xref></sup> and by the arm of his strength&#x201D; (Isa. lxii. 8).<sup><xref rid="fn2832">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer said: From the day when the Israelites went forth from Egypt, they were journeying and encamping in smoothness,<sup><xref rid="fn2833">7</xref></sup> they were journeying in smoothness and they were encamping in smoothness, as it is said, &#x201C;And they journeyed (from Rephidim, and they came to the wilderness of Sinai),<sup><xref rid="fn2834">1</xref></sup> and they encamped in the wilderness&#x201D; (Ex. xix. 2); until they all came to Mount Sinai, and they all encamped opposite the mountain, like one man with one heart, as it is said, &#x201C;And there Israel encamped<sup><xref rid="fn2835">2</xref></sup> before the mount&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). The Holy One, blessed be He, spake to them: Will ye receive for yourselves &#x007C;&#x007C; the Torah? Whilst the Torah had not yet been heard they said to Him: We will keep and observe all the precepts which are in the Torah, as it is said, &#x201C;And they said, All that the Lord hath spoken will we do, and be obedient&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2836">3</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxiv. 7).</p>
<p>Rabbi Ela&#x1E93;ar of Modein said: From the day when the heavens and the earth were created, the name of the mountain was Horeb.<sup><xref rid="fn2837">4</xref></sup> When the Holy One, blessed be He, was revealed unto Moses out of the thorn-bush, because of the word for the thorn-bush (<italic>S&#x2019;neh</italic>) it was called Sinai (<italic>Sinai</italic>), and that is Horeb. And whence do we know that Israel accepted the Torah at Mount Horeb? Because it is said, &#x201C;The day that thou stoodest before the Lord thy God in Horeb&#x201D; (Deut. iv. 10).<sup><xref rid="fn2838">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Phineas said: On the eve of Sabbath<sup><xref rid="fn2839">6</xref></sup> the Israelites stood at Mount Sinai, arranged with the men apart and the women apart.<sup><xref rid="fn2840">7</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses: Go, speak to the daughters of Israel, (asking them) whether they wish to receive the Torah. Why were the women asked (first)? Because the way of men is to follow the opinion of women,<sup><xref rid="fn2841">8</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Thus shalt thou say to the <italic>house of Jacob</italic>&#x201D; (Ex. xix. 3); these are the women. &#x201C;And tell the children of Israel&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>); these are the men. They all replied (as) with one mouth, and they said: &#x201C;All that the Lord hath spoken we will do, and be obedient&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxiv. 7). (The Scripture also says,) &#x201C;They that sing<sup><xref rid="fn2842">1</xref></sup> as well as they that dance<sup><xref rid="fn2843">2</xref></sup> (shall say), All my fountains are in thee&#x201D; (Ps. lxxxvii. 7).<sup><xref rid="fn2844">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Chanina<sup><xref rid="fn2845">4</xref></sup> said: &#x007C;&#x007C; In the third month the day is double the night,<sup><xref rid="fn2846">5</xref></sup> and the Israelites slept until two hours of the day, for sleep on the day of the (feast of) &#x2018;Azereth<sup><xref rid="fn2847">6</xref></sup> is pleasant,<sup><xref rid="fn2848">7</xref></sup> the night being short. And Moses went forth and came to the camp of the Israelites, and he aroused the Israelites from their sleep, saying to them: Arise ye from your sleep,<sup><xref rid="fn2849">8</xref></sup> for behold, your God desires to give the Torah to you. Already the bridegroom wishes to lead the bride and to enter the bridal chamber. The hour has come for giving you the Torah,<sup><xref rid="fn2850">9</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And Moses brought forth the people<sup><xref rid="fn2851">10</xref></sup> out of the camp to meet God&#x201D; (Ex. xix. 17). And the Holy One, blessed be He, also went forth to meet them; like a bridegroom who goes forth to meet the bride, so the Holy One, blessed be He, went forth to meet them to give them<sup><xref rid="fn2852">11</xref></sup> the Torah, as it is said, &#x201C;O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people&#x201D; (Ps. lxviii. 7).</p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua ben &#x1E32;orchah said: The feet of Moses stood on the mount,<sup><xref rid="fn2853">12</xref></sup> and all (his body) was in the midst of the heaven, like a tent<sup><xref rid="fn2854">1</xref></sup> which is spread out, and the children of men stand<sup><xref rid="fn2855">2</xref></sup> inside it, but their feet stand on the earth,<sup><xref rid="fn2856">3</xref></sup> and all of them are inside the tent; so was it with Moses, his feet stood on the mountain, and all his (body) was in the heavens, beholding and seeing everything that is in the heavens. The Holy One, blessed be He, was speaking with him like a man who &#x007C;&#x007C; is conversing with his companion, as it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord spake unto Moses face<sup><xref rid="fn2857">4</xref></sup> to face&#x201D; (Ex. xxxiii. 11).<sup><xref rid="fn2858">5</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses: Go and sanctify the Israelites for two days, as it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord said unto Moses,<sup><xref rid="fn2859">6</xref></sup> Go unto the people, and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xix. 10). What then was the sanctity of Israel in the wilderness? There were no uncircumcised people<sup><xref rid="fn2860">7</xref></sup> in their midst; the manna descended from heaven for them; they drank water out of the Well;<sup><xref rid="fn2861">8</xref></sup> clouds of glory surrounded them. What then was the sanctity of Israel in the wilderness? It refers to their avoidance of sexual intercourse.</p>
<p>Moses argued with himself. Moses said: A man of Israel may have gone to his wife, and they will be found to be prevented from receiving the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn2862">9</xref></sup> What did he do? He added one day (more) for them on his own account, so that if a man of Israel went to his wife<sup><xref rid="fn2863">10</xref></sup> they would be found to be clean for two (complete) days; therefore he added one day for them on his own account.</p>
<p>The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Moses&#x0021; How many souls of the children of men would have come forth from Israel in that night? What thou hast done has been (rightly) accomplished.<sup><xref rid="fn2864">1</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, approved his action.<sup><xref rid="fn2865">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>(The Holy One, blessed be He, said:<sup><xref rid="fn2866">3</xref></sup>) Let Moses descend to the camp, and afterwards will I cause My Torah to be proclaimed.<sup><xref rid="fn2867">4</xref></sup> He said to him: &#x201C;Go down, charge the people&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 21). Moses was wishing to be &#x007C;&#x007C; there,<sup><xref rid="fn2868">5</xref></sup> and he said to Him: I have already charged the people. He said to him: Go, and call thy Rabbi.<sup><xref rid="fn2869">6</xref></sup> Moses descended to the camp to call Aaron, and the Holy One, blessed be He, proclaimed His Torah unto His people, as it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn2870">7</xref></sup> &#x201C;So Moses went down unto the people,<sup><xref rid="fn2871">8</xref></sup> and told them&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 25). What is written after this? &#x201C;And God spake all these words, saying, I, the Lord, am (to be) thy God,<sup><xref rid="fn2871">8</xref></sup> who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xx. 1, 2).</p>
<p>The voice of the first (commandment) went forth,<sup><xref rid="fn2872">9</xref></sup> and the heavens and earth quaked thereat,<sup><xref rid="fn2873">10</xref></sup> and the waters and rivers fled,<sup><xref rid="fn2874">11</xref></sup> and the mountains and hills were moved,<sup><xref rid="fn2875">12</xref></sup> and all the trees fell prostrate,<sup><xref rid="fn2876">1</xref></sup> and the dead who were in Sheol revived, and stood on their feet till the end of all the generations,<sup><xref rid="fn2877">2</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;But with him that standeth here with us this day&#x201D; (Deut. xxix. 15),<sup><xref rid="fn2878">3</xref></sup> and those (also) who in the future will be created, until the end of all the generations, there they stood with them at Mount Sinai, as it is said, &#x201C;And also with him that is <italic>not</italic> here<sup><xref rid="fn2879">4</xref></sup> with us this day&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn2880">5</xref></sup> The Israelites who were alive (then) fell upon their faces and died.</p>
<p>The voice of the second (commandment) went forth, and they were quickened,<sup><xref rid="fn2881">6</xref></sup> and they stood upon their feet and said to Moses: Moses, our teacher&#x0021; We are unable to hear any more the voice of the Holy One, blessed be He, for we shall die even as we died (just now), as it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn2882">7</xref></sup> &#x201C;And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us,<sup><xref rid="fn2879">4</xref></sup> and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, <italic>lest we die</italic>&#x201D; (Ex. xx. 19). And now, why should we die as we died (just now)? The Holy One, blessed be He, heard the voice of Israel, and it was pleasing to Him, and He sent for Michael &#x007C;&#x007C; and Gabriel, and they took hold of the two hands of Moses against his will,<sup><xref rid="fn2883">8</xref></sup> and they brought him near unto the thick darkness, as it is said, &#x201C;And Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 21).</p>
<p>It is only written here (in the text concerning) Moses (that) &#x201C;he drew near.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2884">9</xref></sup> The rest of the commandments He spake through the mouth of Moses,<sup><xref rid="fn2885">10</xref></sup> and concerning him the text says, &#x201C;As the cold of snow in the time of harvest,<sup><xref rid="fn2886">1</xref></sup> so is a faithful messenger to them that send him&#x201D; (Prov. xxv. 13).</p>
<p>And it came to pass, &#x201C;When ye hear the sound of the trumpet&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2887">2</xref></sup> (2 Sam. xv. 10). Why did the Holy One, blessed be He, cause His voice to be heard out of the midst of the<sup><xref rid="fn2888">3</xref></sup> darkness, and not out of the midst of the light? A parable: to what is the matter to be likened? To a king<sup><xref rid="fn2889">4</xref></sup> who was having his son married to a woman, and he suspended in the wedding chamber of his son black curtains,<sup><xref rid="fn2890">5</xref></sup> and not white curtains.<sup><xref rid="fn2891">6</xref></sup> He said to them: I know that my son will not remain with his wife except for forty days; so that on the morrow they should not say the king was an astrologer, but he did not know what would happen to his son. So with the King, who is the Holy One, blessed be He, and His son is Israel, and the bride is the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn2892">7</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, knew that Israel would not remain (loyal) to the commandments except for forty days, therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, caused them to hear His voice out of the midst of<sup><xref rid="fn2893">8</xref></sup> darkness, and not out of the midst of light, therefore it is said, &#x201C;And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice&#x201D; (Deut. v. 28).</p>

In the N.T. we have it also; see Gal. iii. 19, Acts vii. 53, and Heb. ii. 2. The idea is not Palestinian, but seems to be Alexandrian. This is perhaps an indication pointing to Alexandria as the home of Jubilees, just as Hebrews, Acts, and Paul&#x2019;s teaching are all representative of Alexandrine teaching. Our Midrash combats the notion that the Torah was given to Israel by the angels: God Himself gives His law to His people.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER XLII</title>
<h1><small>THE EXODUS</small> [58<small>B.</small> i.]</h1>
<p>&#x201C;A<small>ND</small> it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go&#x201D; (Ex. xiii. 17). This is what the Scripture says, &#x201C;Thy shoots<sup><xref rid="fn2910">1</xref></sup> are a garden of pomegranates&#x201D; (Cant. iv. 13). Just as this garden is full of (various) kinds of trees, each one bearing<sup><xref rid="fn2911">2</xref></sup> according to its kind, so the Israelites, when they went forth from Egypt, were full of all good, (endowed with) the various kinds of blessings, as it is said, &#x201C;Thy shoots are (like) a garden of pomegranates&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>Rabban Gamaliel said: The Egyptians pursued after the children of Israel as far as the Reed Sea, and encamped behind them. The enemy was behind them<sup><xref rid="fn2912">3</xref></sup> and the sea &#x007C;&#x007C; was in front of them. And the Israelites saw the Egyptians, and feared very greatly, and there they cast away from themselves all the Egyptian abominations,<sup><xref rid="fn2913">4</xref></sup> and they repented very sincerely, and called upon their God, as it is said, &#x201C;And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted<sup><xref rid="fn2914">5</xref></sup> up their eyes&#x201D; (Ex. xiv. 10). Moses beheld the anguish of Israel, and arose to pray on their behalf.<sup><xref rid="fn2915">6</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: &#x201C;Speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 15).</p>
<p>Moses spake before the Holy One, blessed be He, saying: Sovereign of all worlds &#x0021; The enemy is behind them, and the sea is in front of them, which way shall they go forward? What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He sent<sup><xref rid="fn2916">1</xref></sup> Michael,<sup><xref rid="fn2917">2</xref></sup> and he became a wall of fire<sup><xref rid="fn2918">3</xref></sup> between (Israel and<sup><xref rid="fn2919">4</xref></sup>) the Egyptians. The Egyptians desired<sup><xref rid="fn2920">5</xref></sup> to follow after Israel, but they are unable to come (near) because of the fire. The angels beheld the misfortune of Israel all the night, and they uttered neither praise nor sanctification<sup><xref rid="fn2921">6</xref></sup> to their Creator,<sup><xref rid="fn2922">7</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And the one came not near the other all the night&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 20).</p>
<p>The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses: Moses&#x0021; &#x201C;Stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 16). &#x201C;And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 21), but the sea refused to be divided.<sup><xref rid="fn2923">8</xref></sup> What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He looked at the sea, and the waters saw the face of the Holy One, blessed be He, and they trembled and quaked,<sup><xref rid="fn2924">1</xref></sup> and descended into the depths, as it is said, &#x201C;The waters saw thee, O God;<sup><xref rid="fn2925">2</xref></sup> the waters saw thee, they were afraid: the depths also trembled&#x201D; (Ps. lxxvii. 16).</p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer said: &#x007C;&#x007C; On the day when He said, &#x201C;Let the waters be gathered together&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2926">3</xref></sup> (Gen. i. 9), on that very day were the waters congealed, and they were made into twelve valleys,<sup><xref rid="fn2927">4</xref></sup> corresponding to the twelve tribes, and they were made into walls of water<sup><xref rid="fn2928">5</xref></sup> between each path,<sup><xref rid="fn2929">6</xref></sup> and (the people) could see one another,<sup><xref rid="fn2930">7</xref></sup> and they saw the Holy One, blessed be He, walking before them, but the heels of His feet<sup><xref rid="fn2931">8</xref></sup> they did not see,<sup><xref rid="fn2932">9</xref></sup> as it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn2933">10</xref></sup> &#x201C;Thy way was in the sea,<sup><xref rid="fn2934">11</xref></sup> and thy paths in the great waters, and thy footsteps were not known&#x201D; (Ps. lxxvii. 19).</p>
<p>Rabbi &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: The Israelites advanced to enter the Reed Sea, but they turned backwards, fearing lest the waters would come over them.<sup><xref rid="fn2935">12</xref></sup> The tribe of Judah sanctified His great Name, and entered the sea first, and under the dominion of the hand likewise of the sons of Judah<sup><xref rid="fn2936">1</xref></sup> (did all Israel enter the sea after them), as it is said, &#x201C;Judah became his sanctuary,<sup><xref rid="fn2937">2</xref></sup> Israel his dominion&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2938">3</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic> cxiv. 2). The Egyptians desired<sup><xref rid="fn2939">4</xref></sup> to follow after Israel, but they turned backwards,<sup><xref rid="fn2940">5</xref></sup> fearing lest the waters would return over them. What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He appeared before them like a man riding on the back of a mare, as it is said, &#x201C;To a steed in Pharaoh&#x2019;s chariots&#x201D; (Cant. i. 9). The horse on which Pharaoh rode saw the mare (of God), and it neighed and ran and entered the sea after it.<sup><xref rid="fn2941">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Egyptians saw that Pharaoh had entered the sea, and all of them entered the sea after him, as it is said, &#x201C;And the Egyptians pursued<sup><xref rid="fn2942">7</xref></sup> after them&#x201D; (Ex. xiv. 9). Forth-with the waters returned, and covered them, as it is said, &#x201C;And the waters returned, and covered<sup><xref rid="fn2943">8</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C; the chariots, and the horsemen&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 28).<sup><xref rid="fn2944">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ben &#x2018;A&#x1E93;&#x1E93;ai said: Everything is (judged according to the principle of) measure (for measure); just as the Egyptians were proud, and cast the male children into the river,<sup><xref rid="fn2945">10</xref></sup> so the Holy One, blessed be He, cast them into the sea, as it is said, &#x201C;I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed triumphantly<sup><xref rid="fn2946">1</xref></sup>; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xv. 1).</p>
<p>Rabbi Shela said: All the children (of the Israelites) whom the Egyptians cast into the river did not die, for the river cast them up, and threw them into the desert of Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn2947">2</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, brought a rock to the mouth of each one, and a rock to the side of each one. The rock which was at his mouth was feeding him with honey and milk, and the rock which was at their side was anointing<sup><xref rid="fn2948">3</xref></sup> them with oil, like a lying-in woman who anoints<sup><xref rid="fn2949">4</xref></sup> her son,<sup><xref rid="fn2950">5</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And he made him to suck honey out of the rock,<sup><xref rid="fn2951">6</xref></sup> and oil out of the flinty rock&#x201D; (Deut. xxxii. 13). When Israel came to the sea, they saw the Holy One, blessed be He, and they recognized Him, and praised Him, and sanctified Him, as it is said, &#x201C;This is my God, and I will praise him&#x201D; (Ex. xv. 2).</p>
<p>Rabbi Simon said: On the fourth day the Israelites encamped by the edge of the sea, and to the south<sup><xref rid="fn2952">7</xref></sup> of the sea. The Egyptians were floating like skin-bottles upon the surface of the waters,<sup><xref rid="fn2953">8</xref></sup> and a north wind went forth and cast them opposite the camp of Israel, and the Israelites went and saw them, and they recognized them, and they said:<sup><xref rid="fn2954">1</xref></sup> These (here) were the officials of the palace of Pharaoh, and those (there) were the taskmasters, and they recognized every one, as it is said, &#x201C;And Israel saw the Egyptians<sup><xref rid="fn2955">2</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C; dead upon the sea shore&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xiv. 30).</p>
<p>Rabbi Reuben said: The entire body follows the head,<sup><xref rid="fn2956">3</xref></sup> and when<sup><xref rid="fn2957">4</xref></sup> the shepherd goes astray the sheep go astray after him, as it is said, &#x201C;For the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned,<sup><xref rid="fn2958">5</xref></sup> and wherewith he made Israel to sin&#x201D; (1 Kings xv. 30). When the shepherd is good, all follow after him.<sup><xref rid="fn2959">6</xref></sup> Moses began to sing, and to utter praises before the Holy One, blessed be He, and all Israel followed him,<sup><xref rid="fn2960">7</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Then sang Moses and the children of Israel&#x201D; (Ex. xv. 1). Miriam began to sing and to utter praises, before the Holy One, blessed be He, and all the women followed her, as it is said, &#x201C;And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron,<sup><xref rid="fn2961">8</xref></sup> took a timbrel&#x2026; and all the women went out after her&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 20). Whence did they have timbrels and chorus in the wilderness?<sup><xref rid="fn2962">9</xref></sup> But the righteous always know and conciliate (God), and are assured that the Omnipresent, blessed be He, performs for them miracles and mighty deeds. Before (the time of) their departure from Egypt they prepared for themselves timbrels and chorus.</p>
<p>Israel spake before the Holy One, blessed be He: Sovereign of all worlds&#x0021; These (Egyptians) who have arisen to come against us to destroy us from Thy world,<sup><xref rid="fn2963">10</xref></sup> as well as all who rise up against us, are as though they had risen up against Thee. Let the majesty of Thy might and Thy fierce anger consume them like stubble, as it is said, &#x201C;And in the greatness of thine excellency thou overthrowest <italic>them that rise up</italic> against thee:<sup><xref rid="fn2964">1</xref></sup> thou sendeth forth thy wrath, it consumeth them as stubble&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 7).</p>
<p>Israel spake before the Holy One, blessed be He: Sovereign of all worlds &#x0021; There is none like Thee among the ministering angels,<sup><xref rid="fn2965">2</xref></sup> and therefore all their descriptive names (contain part of the word) <italic>Elo</italic>him (&#x201C;God&#x201D;); <italic>e.g.</italic> Micha<italic>el</italic> &#x007C;&#x007C; and Gabri<italic>el</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2966">3</xref></sup> &#x201C;Who is like unto thee among the divine creatures,<sup><xref rid="fn2967">4</xref></sup> O Lord?&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 11). Pharaoh<sup><xref rid="fn2968">5</xref></sup> replied after them<sup><xref rid="fn2969">6</xref></sup> with the tongue,<sup><xref rid="fn2970">7</xref></sup> saying: &#x201C;Who is like thee, glorious in holiness,<sup><xref rid="fn2971">8</xref></sup> fearful in praises, doing wonders?&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). &#x201C;Fearful in praise&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn2972">9</xref></sup> is not written here, but &#x201C;fearful in praises&#x201D;; for the praises of the ministering angels are on high, and the praises of Israel are (uttered on earth) below. &#x201C;Fearful in praises, doing wonders&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>), and thus Scripture says, &#x201C;But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel&#x201D; (Ps. xxii. 3).</p>
<p>&#x201C;Thou stretchedst out thy right hand,<sup><xref rid="fn2973">10</xref></sup> the earth swallowed them&#x201D; (Ex. xv. 12). The Holy One, blessed be He, told the earth to bury the slain.<sup><xref rid="fn2974">11</xref></sup> (The earth) said unto Him: Sovereign of all worlds&#x0021; The waters have killed them, let the waters swallow<sup><xref rid="fn2975">12</xref></sup> them. He answered (the earth) saying: On this occasion receive them; on another occasion such that be killed by thee in the future will I cast into the sea, namely, Sisera and all his host, these will I cast into the sea, as it is said, &#x201C;The river Kishon swept them<sup><xref rid="fn2976">1</xref></sup> away,<sup><xref rid="fn2977">2</xref></sup> that ancient river&#x201D; (Judg. v. 21 ).<sup><xref rid="fn2978">3</xref></sup> (The earth) continued, saying to Him: Give me the oath by Thy right hand, that Thou wilt not claim them at my hand.<sup><xref rid="fn2979">4</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, put forth His right hand, and swore to the earth that He would not claim them, as it is said, &#x201C;Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them&#x201D; (Ex. xv. 12).<sup><xref rid="fn2980">5</xref></sup> All the kings<sup><xref rid="fn2981">6</xref></sup> of the earth heard of the departure from Egypt, and the dividing of the Reed Sea; they trembled and feared,<sup><xref rid="fn2982">7</xref></sup> and fled from their place, as it is said, &#x201C;The peoples have heard, they tremble&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 14).</p>
<p>Moses spake before the Holy One, blessed be He: Sovereign of all worlds &#x0021; Put Thy dread &#x007C;&#x007C; and Thy fear upon them, that their heart may be as stone, until Israel has passed through the Jordan,<sup><xref rid="fn2983">8</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Till thy people pass over<sup><xref rid="fn2984">9</xref></sup>&#x2026; thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 16, 17).<sup><xref rid="fn2985">10</xref></sup> Thou shalt bring them in to Thy holy mountain. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses: Moses&#x0021; Thou hast not said, &#x201C;Bring <italic>us</italic> in<sup><xref rid="fn2984">9</xref></sup> and plant <italic>us</italic>,&#x201D; but (thou hast said), &#x201C;Thou shalt bring <italic>them</italic> in<sup><xref rid="fn2986">1</xref></sup> and plant <italic>them</italic>.&#x201D; The One who brings in, He also brings out. By thy life &#x0021; According to thy words so shall it be.<sup><xref rid="fn2987">2</xref></sup> In this world I shall<sup><xref rid="fn2988">3</xref></sup> bring them<sup><xref rid="fn2989">4</xref></sup> in, and in the world to come I will plant them as a true plant<sup><xref rid="fn2990">5</xref></sup> which shall not be plucked up out of their land,<sup><xref rid="fn2991">6</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be plucked up out of their land which I have given them, saith the Lord thy God&#x201D; (Amos ix. 15); and it (also) says, &#x201C;The Lord shall reign for ever and ever&#x201D; (Ex. xv. 18).<sup><xref rid="fn2992">7</xref></sup></p>

<title>CHAPTER XLIII</title>
<h1><small>THE POWER OF REPENTANCE</small> [60<small>A</small>. i.]</h1>
<p>R<small>EPENTANCE</small> and good deeds<sup><xref rid="fn3000">1</xref></sup> are a shield against punishment. Rabbi Ishmael<sup><xref rid="fn3001">2</xref></sup> said: If repentance had not been created,<sup><xref rid="fn3002">3</xref></sup> the world would not stand. But since repentance has been created, the right hand of the Holy One, blessed be He, is stretched forth to receive the penitent<sup><xref rid="fn3003">4</xref></sup> every day, and He says, Repent, ye children of men. &#x201C;Repent, ye children of men&#x201D; (Ps. xc. 8).<sup><xref rid="fn3004">5</xref></sup> Know thou the power of repentance.<sup><xref rid="fn3005">6</xref></sup> Come and see from Ahab, king of Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn3006">7</xref></sup> for he had robbed, coveted,<sup><xref rid="fn3007">8</xref></sup> and murdered,<sup><xref rid="fn3008">9</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Hast thou killed, and also taken possession?&#x201D; (1 Kings xxi. 19). He sent and called for Jehoshaphat, king of Judah,<sup><xref rid="fn3009">10</xref></sup> who gave him thrice daily forty stripes, and in fasting and with prayer he rose up early and retired late, before the Holy One, blessed be He,<sup><xref rid="fn3010">11</xref></sup> and he did not return any more to his evil deeds. His repentance was accepted, as it is said, &#x007C;&#x007C; &#x201C;Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself<sup><xref rid="fn3011">1</xref></sup> before me? Because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 29).</p>
<p>Rabbi Abbahu said: Know thou the power of repentance. Come and see from David, king of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn3012">2</xref></sup> For the Holy One, blessed be He, had sworn to the forefathers that He would multiply their seed like the stars of the heavens. And David came to count their number. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: David &#x0021; I have sworn to the forefathers that I would multiply their seed as the stars of the heavens. And thou comest to annul My word. For thy sake the flock is given over to destruction;<sup><xref rid="fn3013">3</xref></sup> and in three hours there fell seventy thousand men,<sup><xref rid="fn3014">4</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And there fell of Israel seventy thousand men&#x201D; (1 Chron. xxi. 14). Rabbi Simeon said: Only Abishai, son of Zeruiah, fell amongst the Israelites, for he was equal in his good deeds and his knowledge of the Torah to the seventy thousand men,<sup><xref rid="fn3015">5</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And there fell of Israel seventy thousand men&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). &#x201C;Men&#x201D; is not written here, only &#x201C;man.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3016">6</xref></sup> And David heard and rent his garments, and clothed himself in sackcloth and ashes, and he fell upon his face to the ground before the ark of the covenant of God.<sup><xref rid="fn3017">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>He sought (to do) penitence, and spake before the Holy One, blessed be He: Sovereign of all worlds &#x0021; It is I who have sinned; forgive me, I beseech Thee, my sin. His repentance was accepted, and He said to the angel who had destroyed many (<italic>Rab</italic>) among the people: &#x201C;Stay thine hand&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3018">8</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic> 15). What is the meaning of &#x007C;&#x007C; &#x201C;many&#x201D; (<italic>Rab</italic>)? He said to him: <italic>Rab</italic> (the teacher) has fallen in Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn3019">9</xref></sup> What did the angel do? He took his sword and cleaned it with the garment<sup><xref rid="fn3020">1</xref></sup> of David. David saw the sword of the angel,<sup><xref rid="fn3021">2</xref></sup> and he trembled in all his limbs until<sup><xref rid="fn3022">3</xref></sup> his death<sup><xref rid="fn3023">4</xref></sup> (as it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn3024">5</xref></sup>) &#x201C;But David could not go before it<sup><xref rid="fn3025">6</xref></sup> to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the Lord&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 30).</p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua said: Know thou the power of repentance. Come and see from Manasseh,<sup><xref rid="fn3026">7</xref></sup> son of Hezekiah, who perpetrated all the evil abominations much more than all the nations.<sup><xref rid="fn3027">8</xref></sup> He made his son to pass through the fire to Baal outside Jerusalem, causing (doves) to fly,<sup><xref rid="fn3028">9</xref></sup> and sacrificing to all the host of heaven. The princes of the troops of the king of Babylon came,<sup><xref rid="fn3029">10</xref></sup> and they caught him by the hair of his head, and brought him down to Babylon, and they put him in a pan (over) a fire,<sup><xref rid="fn3030">1</xref></sup> and there he called upon all the other gods<sup><xref rid="fn3031">2</xref></sup> to whom he had sacrificed, and not one of them either answered him or saved him. He said: I will call on the God of my fathers with all my heart; perhaps He will do unto me according to all His wonders which He did unto my father. And he called on the God of his fathers with all his heart, and He was entreated of him, and He heard his supplication, as it is said, &#x201C;And he prayed unto him; and he was intreated of him,<sup><xref rid="fn3032">3</xref></sup> and heard his supplication&#x2026; then Manasseh knew that the Lord he was God&#x201D; (2 Chron. xxxiii. 18). In that hour Manasseh said: There is both judgment as well as a judge.</p>
<p>Ben &#x2018;A&#x1E93;&#x1E93;ai<sup><xref rid="fn3033">4</xref></sup> said: Know thou the power of repentance. Come and see from (the story of) Rabbi Simeon, son of La&#x1E33;ish. He with two &#x007C;&#x007C; of his friends<sup><xref rid="fn3034">5</xref></sup> in the mountains, were robbing<sup><xref rid="fn3035">6</xref></sup> all who passed them on the way. What did he do? He forsook his two companions who were plundering on the mountains, and he returned to the God of his fathers with all his heart. Fasting and praying he arose early and retired late,<sup><xref rid="fn3036">7</xref></sup> before the Holy One, blessed be He, and he was studying the Torah all (the rest of) his days, and (giving) gifts to the needy. He did not return any more to his evil deeds, and his repentance was accepted. On the day when he died, his two companions, who were plundering on the mountains, also died. And they gave a portion in the treasury of the living<sup><xref rid="fn3037">8</xref></sup> to Rabbi Simeon, son of La&#x1E33;ish, but his two companions (were put) in the lowest Sheol.</p>
<p>The two companions spake before the Holy One, blessed be He: Sovereign of all the universe &#x0021; There is before Thee respect for certain persons. This one was plundering with us on the mountains, and he is in the treasury of the living, whilst the other men are<sup><xref rid="fn3038">1</xref></sup> in the lowest Sheol. He said to them: This one repented in his lifetime, but ye have not repented. They said to Him: Give us the opportunity, and we will repent very sincerely. He said to them: Repentance is only possible until one&#x2019;s death.<sup><xref rid="fn3039">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>A parable&#x2014;To what is the matter comparable? To a man who wished to take a voyage at sea. If he did not take with him bread and water from an inhabited land, he will not find anything to eat or to drink on the sea. Again, &#x007C;&#x007C; if a man wish to go to the end of the wilderness, unless he take from some inhabited place bread and water, he will not find anything to eat or to drink in the wilderness. Likewise, if a man did not repent in his lifetime, after his death he cannot repent.<sup><xref rid="fn3040">3</xref></sup> But (God) gives to a man according to his ways, as it is said, &#x201C;I<sup><xref rid="fn3041">4</xref></sup> the Lord search the heart,<sup><xref rid="fn3042">5</xref></sup> I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, according to the fruit of his doings&#x201D; (Jer. xvii. 10).</p>
<p>Rabbi Nechunia, son of Ha&#x1E33;&#x1E33;anah, said: Know thou the power of repentance. Come and see from Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who rebelled most grievously against the Rock, the Most High,<sup><xref rid="fn3043">6</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Who is the Lord, that I should hearken unto his voice?&#x201D; (Ex. v. 2).<sup><xref rid="fn3044">7</xref></sup> In the same terms of speech in which he sinned, he repented, as it is said &#x201C;Who is like thee, O Lord, among the mighty?&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xv. 11). The Holy One, blessed be He, delivered him from amongst the dead. Whence (do we know) that he died?<sup><xref rid="fn3045">1</xref></sup> Because it is said, &#x201C;For now I had put forth my hand,<sup><xref rid="fn3046">2</xref></sup> and smitten thee&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> ix. 15).<sup><xref rid="fn3047">3</xref></sup> He went and ruled in Nineveh. The men of Nineveh were writing fraudulent deeds, and everyone robbed his neighbour, and they committed sodomy,<sup><xref rid="fn3048">4</xref></sup> and such-like wicked actions. When the Holy One, blessed be He, sent for Jonah, to prophesy against (the city) its destruction, Pharaoh hearkened and arose from his throne, rent his garments and clothed himself in sackcloth and ashes, and had a proclamation made to all his people, that all the people should fast for two<sup><xref rid="fn3049">5</xref></sup> days, &#x007C;&#x007C; and all who did these (wicked) things<sup><xref rid="fn3050">6</xref></sup> should be burnt by fire. What did they<sup><xref rid="fn3051">7</xref></sup> do? The men were<sup><xref rid="fn3052">8</xref></sup> on one side, and the women on the other, and their children were by themselves; all the clean animals were on one side,<sup><xref rid="fn3053">9</xref></sup> and their offspring were by themselves. The infants saw the breasts of their mothers, (and they wished<sup><xref rid="fn3054">1</xref></sup>) to have suck,<sup><xref rid="fn3055">2</xref></sup> and they wept. The mothers saw their children, (and they wished<sup><xref rid="fn3054">1</xref></sup>) to give them suck. By the merit of 4123 children more than twelve hundred thousand men (were saved), as it is said, &#x201C;And should not I have pity on Nineveh,<sup><xref rid="fn3056">3</xref></sup> that great city; wherein are more than six score thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?&#x201D; (Jonah iv. 11); &#x201C;And the Lord<sup><xref rid="fn3057">4</xref></sup> repented of the evil,<sup><xref rid="fn3058">5</xref></sup> which he said he would do unto them&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3059">6</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic> iii. 10).

<p>R<small>ABBI</small> J<small>OCHANAN</small>, son of Nuri, said: (After)<sup><xref rid="fn3081">1</xref></sup> all the mighty deeds and wonders which the Holy One, blessed be He, did unto Israel in Egypt, and at the Reed Sea, they repeatedly tempted the Omnipresent<sup><xref rid="fn3082">2</xref></sup> ten times,<sup><xref rid="fn3083">3</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Yet have they tempted me these ten times&#x201D; (Num. xiv. 22).

Amalek came against them to punish them. He who comes from &#x007C;&#x007C; a journey should be met on the way with food and drink.

The cloud<sup><xref rid="fn3095">6</xref></sup> was surrounding<sup><xref rid="fn3096">7</xref></sup> the camp of Israel like a city surrounded by a wall.<sup><xref rid="fn3097">8</xref></sup> The adversary and enemy<sup><xref rid="fn3098">9</xref></sup> were unable to touch them, but (when) anyone needed a ritual bath<sup><xref rid="fn3099">10</xref></sup> the cloud excluded him from the camp of Israel, because the camp of Israel was holy, as it is said, &#x201C;Therefore shall thy camp be holy&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxiii. 14), and (then) Amalek was smiting and slaying<sup><xref rid="fn3100">11</xref></sup> the hindmost of those who were beyond the cloud,<sup><xref rid="fn3101">12</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And he smote the hindmost of thee,<sup><xref rid="fn3102">13</xref></sup> all that were feeble behind thee&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxv. 18).</p>
<p>Moses said to Joshua: Choose men for us, houses<sup><xref rid="fn3103">14</xref></sup> of the fathers,<sup><xref rid="fn3104">15</xref></sup> men who are mighty in strength and valour,<sup><xref rid="fn3105">16</xref></sup> and go forth and do battle with Amalek. Moses, Aaron, and Hur stood on a high place,<sup><xref rid="fn3106">17</xref></sup> in the camp<sup><xref rid="fn3107">18</xref></sup> of Israel, one on his right hand, and one on his left. Hence thou mayest learn that the precentor<sup><xref rid="fn3108">19</xref></sup> is prohibited to officiate unless there are two (men) standing with him,<sup><xref rid="fn3109">1</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C; one on his right hand and one on his left.</p>
<p>All the Israelites (were standing<sup><xref rid="fn3110">2</xref></sup>) outside (their tents<sup><xref rid="fn3111">3</xref></sup>); they had gone forth from their tents, and saw Moses kneeling on his knees, and they were kneeling on their knees.<sup><xref rid="fn3112">4</xref></sup> He fell on his face to the ground, and they fell on their faces to the ground. He spread out the palms of his hands towards the heavens, and they spread out their hands to heaven.<sup><xref rid="fn3113">5</xref></sup> Just as<sup><xref rid="fn3114">6</xref></sup> the precentor officiates, in like manner all the people answer<sup><xref rid="fn3115">7</xref></sup> after him.</p>
<p>The Holy One, blessed be He, caused Amalek and his people to fall into the hand of Joshua,<sup><xref rid="fn3116">8</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And Joshua discomfited<sup><xref rid="fn3117">9</xref></sup> Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword&#x201D; (Ex. xvii. 13).<sup><xref rid="fn3118">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Shela said: The Holy One, blessed be He, wished to destroy, to cut off all the seed of Amalek. What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He put forth His right hand and took hold of the throne of His glory, and swore that He would destroy and cut off all the seed of Amalek,<sup><xref rid="fn3119">11</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And he said, Because there is a hand against the throne<sup><xref rid="fn3117">9</xref></sup> of the Lord, the Lord will wage war against Amalek&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 16).</p>
<p>Rabbi Phineas said: (After<sup><xref rid="fn3120">12</xref></sup>) forty years Moses wished to say to Israel: Do ye remember that which ye said in the wilderness&#x2014;&#x201C;Is the Lord among us,<sup><xref rid="fn3121">13</xref></sup> or not?&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 7).<sup><xref rid="fn3122">1</xref></sup> But Moses said: If I speak<sup><xref rid="fn3123">2</xref></sup> thus to Israel, behold I will put them to shame, and whosoever puts (his fellow) to shame will have no portion in the world to come.<sup><xref rid="fn3124">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>A parable&#x2014;To what is the matter to be compared? To a king<sup><xref rid="fn3125">4</xref></sup> who had &#x007C;&#x007C; a garden and a dog chained at the entrance to the garden. The king was sitting in his upper room, watching and looking at all that (transpired) in the garden. The friend of the king entered to steal (fruit) from the garden, and he incited the dog against him, and it tore his garments. The king said: If I say to my friend, Why didst thou enter my garden? behold I will put him to shame; therefore, behold, I will say to him: Didst thou see that mad dog, how it tore thy clothes?<sup><xref rid="fn3126">5</xref></sup> And he will understand what he has done. Likewise spake Moses: Behold, I will tell Israel the story of Amalek, and they will understand what is written before it; therefore Moses said: &#x201C;Remember what Amalek did unto thee<sup><xref rid="fn3127">6</xref></sup> by the way, as ye came forth out of Egypt&#x201D; (Deut. xxv. 17).</p>
<p>The Israelites said to our teacher Moses: Moses &#x0021; One Scripture text says, &#x201C;Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy&#x201D; (Ex. xx. 8); and it is written, &#x201C;Remember what Amalek did unto thee&#x201D; (Deut. xxv. 17). How can these two texts be fulfilled?<sup><xref rid="fn3128">7</xref></sup> He said to them: The cup of spiced wine<sup><xref rid="fn3129">8</xref></sup> is not to be compared to the cup of vinegar.<sup><xref rid="fn3130">1</xref></sup> This &#x201C;Remember&#x201D; is in order to observe and to sanctify the Sabbath day,<sup><xref rid="fn3131">2</xref></sup> and the other &#x201C;Remember&#x201D; is in order to destroy and to cut off all the seed of Amalek, as it is said, &#x201C;Therefore it shall be, when the Lord thy God hath given thee rest<sup><xref rid="fn3132">3</xref></sup> from all thine enemies&#x2026; thou shalt not forget&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 19).<sup><xref rid="fn3133">4</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C; Israel forgot to destroy and to cut off all the seed of Amalek, but the Holy One, blessed be He, did not forget.<sup><xref rid="fn3134">5</xref></sup> When Saul reigned, Samuel said to him: &#x201C;Thus saith the Lord of hosts, I have marked that which Amalek did to Israel&#x2026;. Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have&#x201D; (1 Sam. xv. 2, 3). What is the meaning of &#x201C;all that they have&#x201D;? Even all the living male creatures.<sup><xref rid="fn3135">6</xref></sup> &#x201C;Spare them not, but slay&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). Saul took the men of war, and he went out to meet Amalek. When Saul came to the crossing of the ways, he stood still, and thought in his heart,<sup><xref rid="fn3136">7</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And Saul came to the city of Amalek,<sup><xref rid="fn3137">8</xref></sup> and argued<sup><xref rid="fn3138">9</xref></sup> in the valley&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 5). Saul said: If the men have sinned, what<sup><xref rid="fn3139">10</xref></sup> have the beasts done amiss? A Bath &#x1E32;ol<sup><xref rid="fn3140">11</xref></sup> came forth, saying to him: Saul &#x0021; Be not more righteous than thy Creator,<sup><xref rid="fn3141">1</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Be not righteous overmuch&#x201D; (Eccles. vii. 16).</p>
<p>Rabbi said: When Saul came to the camp of Amalek he saw the children of Israel tarrying<sup><xref rid="fn3142">2</xref></sup> in the midst of Amalek.<sup><xref rid="fn3143">3</xref></sup> He said to them: Separate yourselves from the midst of Amalek, as it is said, &#x201C;And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down<sup><xref rid="fn3144">4</xref></sup> from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them&#x201D; (1 Sam. xv. 6). Did Jethro show loving-kindness to all Israel? But did he not show loving-kindness to Moses our teacher alone? Hence thou mayest learn &#x007C;&#x007C; that whosoever shows loving-kindness unto one of the great men of Israel is considered as though he had shown loving-kindness unto Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn3145">5</xref></sup> Because of the loving-kindness which he showed, his children were saved from among the Amalekites.<sup><xref rid="fn3146">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jos&#x00E9; said: When Sennacherib came to the land (of Israel), all the nations who were in the regions round about the land of Israel saw the camp of Sennacherib, and feared greatly, and every man fled from his place, as it is said, &#x201C;I have removed the bounds of the peoples,<sup><xref rid="fn3144">4</xref></sup> and have robbed their treasures&#x201D; (Isa. x. 13). They went into the wilderness, and intermixed with the children of Ishmael,<sup><xref rid="fn3147">7</xref></sup> and all of them were (composed of) ten peoples, as it is said, &#x201C;The tents of Edom, and the Ishmaelites;<sup><xref rid="fn3148">8</xref></sup> Moab, and the Hagarenes; Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia, with the inhabitants of Tyre; Assyria also is joined with them&#x201D; (Ps. lxxxiii. 6, 7, 8).<sup><xref rid="fn3149">9</xref></sup> All of them are destined to fall by the hand of the Son of David, as it is said, &#x201C;O my God, make them like the whirling dust&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 13).<sup><xref rid="fn3150">1</xref></sup> &#x201C;As the fire that burneth the forest,<sup><xref rid="fn3151">2</xref></sup> and as the flame that setteth the mountains on fire&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 14). &#x201C;So pursue them with thy tempest,<sup><xref rid="fn3151">2</xref></sup> and terrify them with thy storm&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 15).</p>

<h1><small>THE GOLDEN CALF</small> [62<small>B</small>. ii.]</h1>
<p>R<small>ABBI</small> S<small>IMEON BEN</small> J<small>OCHAI</small> said: When the Holy One, blessed be He, was revealed to Moses out of the thorn-bush, in order to send him to Egypt, Moses spake before the Holy One, blessed be He (saying): Sovereign of all the worlds&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn3154">1</xref></sup> Swear to me that all things which I desire to do,<sup><xref rid="fn3155">2</xref></sup> Thou wilt do, so that I should not speak words before Pharaoh, and Thou wilt not fulfil them, for then will he slay me. And He swore unto him that &#x201C;whatsoever thou &#x007C;&#x007C; desirest to do, I will do, except with reference to two things,&#x201D; (namely,) to let him enter the land (of Canaan),<sup><xref rid="fn3156">3</xref></sup> and (to postpone) the day of (his) death. Whence do we know that He swore unto him? Because it is said, &#x201C;By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, the word is gone forth from my mouth in righteousness&#x201D; (Isa. xlv. 23).<sup><xref rid="fn3157">4</xref></sup> When Israel received the commandments they forgot their God<sup><xref rid="fn3158">5</xref></sup> after forty days, and they said to Aaron: The Egyptians were carrying their god, and they were singing and uttering hymns<sup><xref rid="fn3159">6</xref></sup> before it, and they saw it before them. Make unto us a god like the gods of the Egyptians, and let us see it before us, as it is said, &#x201C;Up, make us a god&#x201D; (Ex. xxxii. 1).</p>
<p>They betook themselves to the one who carried out the words of Moses,<sup><xref rid="fn3160">1</xref></sup> (to) Aaron his brother, and Hur, the son of his sister. Whence (do we know) that Hur was the son of (Moses&#x2019;) sister? Because it is said, &#x201C;And Caleb took unto him Ephrath,<sup><xref rid="fn3161">2</xref></sup> which bare him Hur&#x201D; (1 Chron. ii. 19). Why was Miriam&#x2019;s name called Ephrath?<sup><xref rid="fn3162">3</xref></sup> Because she was a daughter of the palace,<sup><xref rid="fn3163">4</xref></sup> a daughter of kings, one of the magnates of the generation; for every prince and great man who arose in Israel had his name called an Ephrathite, as it is said, &#x201C;And Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3164">5</xref></sup> (1 Kings xi. 26); and it says, &#x201C;And David was the son of that Ephrathite&#x201D; (1 Sam. xvii. 12). Was he then an Ephrathite? Was he not of the tribe of Judah? But he was a nobleman,<sup><xref rid="fn3163">4</xref></sup> a son of kings, one of the magnates of the generation. But since Hur was of the tribe of Judah, and one of the magnates of the generation, he began to reprove Israel with harsh words,<sup><xref rid="fn3165">6</xref></sup> and the plunderers<sup><xref rid="fn3166">7</xref></sup> who were in Israel arose against him, and slew him.</p>
<p>Aaron arose &#x007C;&#x007C; and saw that Hur, the son of his sister, was slain; and he built for them an altar, as it is said, &#x201C;And when Aaron saw this,<sup><xref rid="fn3167">8</xref></sup> he built an altar before it&#x201D; (Ex. xxxii. 5).</p>
<p>Aaron argued with himself, saying: If I say to Israel, Give ye to me gold and silver, they will bring it immediately; but behold I will say to them, Give ye to me the earrings of your wives, and of your sons,<sup><xref rid="fn3168">1</xref></sup> and forthwith the matter will fail,<sup><xref rid="fn3169">2</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And Aaron said to them, Break off the golden rings&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 2). The women heard (this), but they were unwilling<sup><xref rid="fn3170">3</xref></sup> to give their earrings to their husbands; but they said to them: Ye desire to<sup><xref rid="fn3171">4</xref></sup> make a graven image and a molten image without any power in it to deliver. The Holy One, blessed be He, gave the women their reward in this world and in the world to come. What reward did He give them in this world? That they should observe the New Moons<sup><xref rid="fn3172">5</xref></sup> more stringently than the men, and what reward will He give them in the world to come? They are destined to be renewed like the New Moons, as it is said, &#x201C;Who satisfieth thy years with good things;<sup><xref rid="fn3173">6</xref></sup> so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle&#x201D; (Ps. ciii. 5).</p>
<p>The men saw that the women would not consent to give their earrings to their husbands. What did they do? Until that hour the earrings were (also) in their own ears, after the fashion of the Egyptians, and after the fashion of the Arabs.<sup><xref rid="fn3174">7</xref></sup> They broke off their earrings which were in their own ears, and they gave (them) to Aaron, as it is said, &#x201C;And all the people brake off &#x007C;&#x007C; the golden rings which were in their ears&#x201D; (Ex. xxxii. 3). &#x201C;Which were in the ears of their wives&#x201D; is not written here, but &#x201C;which were in <italic>their</italic> ears.&#x201D; Aaron found among the earrings one plate of gold upon which the Holy Name was written, and engraven thereon was the figure of a calf, and that (plate) alone did he cast into the fiery furnace,<sup><xref rid="fn3175">8</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;So they gave <italic>it</italic> me:<sup><xref rid="fn3176">9</xref></sup> and I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 24). It is not written here, &#x201C;And I cast them in,&#x201D; but &#x201C;And I cast <italic>it</italic> in the fire, and there came out this calf.&#x201D; The calf came out lowing, and the Israelites saw it,<sup><xref rid="fn3177">1</xref></sup> and they went astray after it.</p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah said: Sammael<sup><xref rid="fn3178">2</xref></sup> entered into it, and he was lowing to mislead Israel, as it is said, &#x201C;The ox knoweth his owner&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3179">3</xref></sup> (Isa. i. 3).</p>
<p>The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses: Israel has forgotten the might of My power, which I wrought for them in Egypt and at the Reed Sea,<sup><xref rid="fn3180">4</xref></sup> and they have made an idol for themselves. He said to Moses:<sup><xref rid="fn3181">5</xref></sup> Go, get thee down from thy greatness.<sup><xref rid="fn3182">6</xref></sup> Moses spake before the Holy One, blessed be He: Sovereign of all the worlds&#x0021; Whilst Israel had not yet sinned before Thee, Thou didst call them &#x201C;My people,&#x201D; as it is said, &#x201C;And I will bring forth <italic>my</italic> hosts, <italic>my</italic> people&#x201D; (Ex. vii. 4). Now that they have sinned before Thee, Thou sayest unto me, &#x201C;Go, get thee down, for <italic>thy</italic> people have corrupted themselves&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxxii. 7). They are Thy people, and Thine inheritance, as it is said, &#x201C;Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance&#x201D; (Deut. ix. 29).</p>
<p>Moses took &#x007C;&#x007C; the tables (of the law),<sup><xref rid="fn3183">7</xref></sup> and he descended, and the tables carried their own weight<sup><xref rid="fn3184">8</xref></sup> and Moses with them; but when they beheld the calf and the dances,<sup><xref rid="fn3185">9</xref></sup> the writing fled from off the tables,<sup><xref rid="fn3186">10</xref></sup> and they became heavy in his hands,<sup><xref rid="fn3187">11</xref></sup> and Moses was not able to carry himself and the tables, and he cast them from his hand,<sup><xref rid="fn3188">1</xref></sup> and they were broken beneath the mount, as it is said, &#x201C;And Moses&#x2019; anger waxed hot,<sup><xref rid="fn3189">2</xref></sup> and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3190">3</xref></sup> (Ex. xxxii. 19).</p>
<p>Moses said to Aaron: What hast thou done to this people? Thou hast made them unruly, like a woman who is unchecked<sup><xref rid="fn3191">4</xref></sup> owing to immorality. He said to Moses: I saw what they did to Hur, and I feared very greatly.</p>
<p>Rabbi said: All the princes were not associated in the affair of the calf, as it is said, &#x201C;And upon the nobles<sup><xref rid="fn3192">5</xref></sup> of the children of Israel<sup><xref rid="fn3193">6</xref></sup> he laid not his hand&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxiv. 11). The word (&#x201C;Azil&#x00EA;&#x201D;) means the &#x201C;princes,&#x201D; therefore they were accounted worthy to gaze upon the glory<sup><xref rid="fn3194">7</xref></sup> of the Shekhinah, as it is said, &#x201C;And they saw the God of Israel&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 10).<sup><xref rid="fn3195">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah said: The tribe of Levi<sup><xref rid="fn3196">9</xref></sup> also did not associate itself in the affair of the calf, as it is said, &#x201C;Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp,<sup><xref rid="fn3193">6</xref></sup> and said, Whoso is on the Lord&#x2019;s side (let him come) unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxxii. 26). Moses saw that the tribe of Levi was with him.<sup><xref rid="fn3197">10</xref></sup> He became strengthened with his might, and he burnt the calf with fire,<sup><xref rid="fn3198">11</xref></sup> and powdered it, like the dust<sup><xref rid="fn3199">12</xref></sup> of the earth, and he cast its dust upon the face of the waters, as it is said, &#x201C;And he took the &#x007C;&#x007C; calf which they had made&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 20). He made Israel drink the water (with the dust of the calf). Everyone who had kissed the calf with all his heart, his upper lip and his bones<sup><xref rid="fn3200">1</xref></sup> became golden,<sup><xref rid="fn3201">2</xref></sup> and the tribe of Levi slew him,<sup><xref rid="fn3202">3</xref></sup> until there fell of Israel about three thousand men,<sup><xref rid="fn3203">4</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 28).</p>
<p>The Holy One, blessed be He, sent five angels to destroy Israel. (The angels were) Wrath, Anger, Temper, Destruction, and Glow of Anger.<sup><xref rid="fn3204">5</xref></sup> Moses heard,<sup><xref rid="fn3205">6</xref></sup> and he went to invoke Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob<sup><xref rid="fn3206">7</xref></sup> at the Cave of Machpelah, and he said: If ye be of the children of the world to come, stand ye before me in this hour, for behold your children are given over like sheep to the slaughter.<sup><xref rid="fn3207">8</xref></sup> Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob stood there before him. Moses spake before the Holy One, blessed be He (saying): Sovereign of all the worlds &#x0021; Didst Thou not swear to these (forefathers) thus to increase their seed like the stars of the heaven, as it is said, &#x201C;Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn3208">9</xref></sup> thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 18).</p>
<p>By the merit of the three patriarchs, the three angels, Wrath, Anger, and Temper, were restrained from (doing harm to) Israel. But two (angels) remained. Moses spake before the Holy One, blessed be He: Sovereign of all the universe &#x0021; For the sake of the oath which Thou didst swear unto them, keep back (the angel) Destruction &#x007C;&#x007C; from Israel, as it is said, &#x201C;To whom thou swarest by thine own self&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>); and Destruction was kept back from Israel, as it is said, &#x201C;But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity,<sup><xref rid="fn3209">1</xref></sup> and <italic>destroyed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3210">2</xref></sup> (them) not&#x201D; (Ps. lxxviii. 88). Moses spake before the Holy One, blessed be He: Sovereign of all worlds&#x0021; For the sake of Thy great and holy Name, which Thou didst make known unto me,<sup><xref rid="fn3211">3</xref></sup> hold back from Israel (the angel called) Glow of Anger, (as it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn3212">4</xref></sup>) &#x201C;Turn away from thy <italic>fierce</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3213">5</xref></sup> <italic>anger</italic>&#x201D; (Ex. xxxii. 12). What did Moses do? He dug in the earth in the possession of Gad,<sup><xref rid="fn3214">6</xref></sup> as (though for the foundation of) a large dwelling, and he buried &#x201C;Fierce Anger&#x201D; in the earth,<sup><xref rid="fn3215">7</xref></sup> like a man who is bound in the prison.<sup><xref rid="fn3216">8</xref></sup> Every time Israel sins it arises and opens its mouth to bite<sup><xref rid="fn3217">9</xref></sup> with its breath, and to destroy Israel. Moses pronounced against it the (divine) Name,<sup><xref rid="fn3218">10</xref></sup> and brought it down beneath the earth. Therefore is its name called Peor (the one who opens). When Moses died, what did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He put his burial-place opposite to it. Every time Israel sins<sup><xref rid="fn3219">11</xref></sup> it opens its mouth to bite with its breath, and to destroy Israel, but (when) it sees the burial-place of Moses opposite to it, it<sup><xref rid="fn3220">12</xref></sup> returns backward, as it is said, &#x201C;And he buried him in the valley,<sup><xref rid="fn3221">13</xref></sup> in the land of Moab, over against the house of Peor&#x201D; (Deut. xxxiv. 6).<sup><xref rid="fn3222">14</xref></sup></p>

<h1><small>MOSES ON THE MOUNT</small> [64<small>A</small>. ii.]</h1>
<p>R<small>ABBI</small> E<small>LA&#x1E93;AR</small>, son of &#x2018;A&#x1E93;ariah, said: On Friday, &#x007C;&#x007C; on the 6th of the month,<sup><xref rid="fn3224">1</xref></sup> at the sixth hour of the day, Israel received the Commandments.<sup><xref rid="fn3225">2</xref></sup> At the ninth hour of the day they returned to their tents, and the Manna was prepared for them for two days,<sup><xref rid="fn3226">3</xref></sup> and Israel rested on that Sabbath full of joy as (with) the joy of the festival, because they were worthy to hear the voice of the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is said, &#x201C;For who is there of all flesh,<sup><xref rid="fn3227">4</xref></sup> that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?&#x201D; (Deut. v. 26). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses in a pure expression of speech:<sup><xref rid="fn3228">5</xref></sup> Go, tell the children of Israel, that for My sake they should return to their tents, (as it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn3229">6</xref></sup>) &#x201C;Go, say to them, Return ye to your tents&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 30). It is possible that even thou (Moses) shouldst return. Hence thou mayest learn that from the hour when Moses brought down the Torah to Israel, he did not approach his wife,<sup><xref rid="fn3230">7</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;But as for thee, stand thou <italic>here by me</italic>&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 31).</p>
<p>Rabbi Joshua, son of &#x1E32;orchah, said: Forty days was Moses on the mountain, reading the Written Law by day, and studying the Oral Law<sup><xref rid="fn3231">1</xref></sup> by night. After the forty days he took the tables (of the Law) and descended into the camp on the 17th of Tammu&#x1E93;,<sup><xref rid="fn3232">2</xref></sup> and he broke in pieces the tables, and slew the sinners<sup><xref rid="fn3233">3</xref></sup> in Israel. He then spent forty days in the camp, until he had burnt the calf, and powdered it like<sup><xref rid="fn3234">4</xref></sup> the dust of the earth,<sup><xref rid="fn3235">5</xref></sup> and he had destroyed the idol worship from Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn3236">6</xref></sup> and he instituted every tribe in its place. And on the New Moon of Ellul<sup><xref rid="fn3237">7</xref></sup> the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: &#x201C;Come up &#x007C;&#x007C; to me on the mount&#x201D; (Ex. xxiv. 12), and let them sound the Shophar (trumpet) throughout the camp, for, behold, Moses has ascended the mount, so that they do not go astray again after the worship of idols. The Holy One, blessed be He, was exalted<sup><xref rid="fn3238">8</xref></sup> with that Shophar, as it is said, &#x201C;God is exalted<sup><xref rid="fn3239">9</xref></sup> with a shout,<sup><xref rid="fn3240">10</xref></sup> the Lord with the sound of a trumpet&#x201D; (Ps. xlvii. 5).</p>
<p>Therefore the sages instituted that the Shophar should be sounded on the New Moon of Ellul every year.<sup><xref rid="fn3241">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Tachanah<sup><xref rid="fn3242">12</xref></sup> said: The tables (of the Law) were not created out of the earth but out of the heavens, the handicraft<sup><xref rid="fn3243">13</xref></sup> of the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is said, &#x201C;And the tables, the work of God were <italic>they</italic>&#x201D; (Ex. xxxii. 16). <italic>They</italic> are the tables which were of old,<sup><xref rid="fn3244">1</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>and the writing</italic>&#x201D; was divine writing; that was the writing which was of old, &#x201C;<italic>graven</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3245">2</xref></sup> <italic>upon the tables</italic>.&#x201D; Do not read Charuth, &#x201C;graven,&#x201D; but (read) Ch&#x00EA;ruth, &#x201C;liberty.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3246">3</xref></sup> When the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses: &#x201C;Hew thee two tables of stone<sup><xref rid="fn3247">4</xref></sup> like unto the first&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxxiv. 1), a quarry of sapphires<sup><xref rid="fn3248">5</xref></sup> was created for Moses in the midst of his tent,<sup><xref rid="fn3249">6</xref></sup> and he cut them out (thence), as it is said, &#x201C;And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 4). Moses descended with the tables, and spent forty days on the mountain, sitting down before the Holy One, blessed be He, like a disciple who is sitting before his teacher,<sup><xref rid="fn3250">7</xref></sup> reading the Written Law, and repeating the Oral Law which he had learnt.</p>
<p>The ministering angels said to him: Moses &#x0021; This Torah has been given only for our sakes.<sup><xref rid="fn3251">8</xref></sup> Moses replied to them: It is written in the Torah, &#x201C;Honour thy father<sup><xref rid="fn3252">9</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C; and thy mother&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xx. 12). Have ye then father and mother? Again, it is written in the Torah, &#x201C;When a man dieth in the tent&#x201D; (Num. xix. 14). Does death happen among you?<sup><xref rid="fn3253">10</xref></sup> They were silent, and did not answer anything further.<sup><xref rid="fn3254">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hence (the sages) say: Moses went up to the heavenly regions with his wisdom, and brought down the might of the trust<sup><xref rid="fn3255">12</xref></sup> of the ministering angels, as it is said, &#x201C;A wise man<sup><xref rid="fn3256">13</xref></sup> scaleth the city of the mighty,<sup><xref rid="fn3257">1</xref></sup> and bringeth down the strength<sup><xref rid="fn3258">2</xref></sup> of the confidence thereof&#x201D; (Prov. xxi. 22). When the ministering angels saw that the Holy One, blessed be He, gave the Torah to Moses, they also arose and gave unto him presents and letters<sup><xref rid="fn3259">3</xref></sup> and tablets<sup><xref rid="fn3260">4</xref></sup> for healing the sons of man, as it is said, &#x201C;Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led thy captivity captive;<sup><xref rid="fn3261">5</xref></sup> thou hast received gifts among men&#x201D; (Ps. lxviii. 18).</p>
<p>The Son of Bethera said: Moses spent forty days on the mount, expounding the meaning of the words of the Torah, and examining its letters.<sup><xref rid="fn3262">6</xref></sup> After forty days he took the Torah, and descended on the tenth of the month,<sup><xref rid="fn3263">7</xref></sup> on the Day of Atonement, and gave it as an <italic>everlasting</italic> inheritance to the children of Israel, as it is said, &#x201C;And <italic>this</italic> shall be unto you an <italic>everlasting</italic> statute&#x201D; (Lev. xvi. 84).<sup><xref rid="fn3264">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Zechariah said: They read in the Torah<sup><xref rid="fn3265">9</xref></sup> and found written therein, &#x201C;And ye shall afflict your souls&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 29), and on the Day of Atonement<sup><xref rid="fn3266">10</xref></sup> they caused a Shophar to be sounded throughout all the camp and proclaimed a fast for all Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn3267">11</xref></sup> old and young.<sup><xref rid="fn3268">12</xref></sup> Were it not for the Day of Atonement the world could not stand,<sup><xref rid="fn3269">13</xref></sup> because the Day of Atonement is<sup><xref rid="fn3270">14</xref></sup> in this world and in the world to come,<sup><xref rid="fn3271">1</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C; as it is said, &#x201C;It is a sabbath of sabbaths unto you&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 31). &#x201C;A sabbath&#x201D; refers to this world, &#x201C;sabbaths&#x201D; refers to the world to come. Moreover, if all the festivals pass away,<sup><xref rid="fn3272">2</xref></sup> the Day of Atonement will not pass away, for the Day of Atonement effects reconciliation for serious offences<sup><xref rid="fn3273">3</xref></sup> as well as for slight offences. Whence do we know that the Day of Atonement effects reconciliation? Because it is said, &#x201C;For on this day shall atonement be made<sup><xref rid="fn3274">4</xref></sup> for you, to cleanse you; <italic>from all</italic> your sins shall ye be clean&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 30). &#x201C;From your sins&#x201D; is not written here, but &#x201C;from <italic>all</italic> your sins shall ye be clean before the Lord&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>Sammael<sup><xref rid="fn3275">5</xref></sup> said before the Holy One, blessed be He: Sovereign of all the universe &#x0021; Thou hast given me power<sup><xref rid="fn3276">6</xref></sup> over all the nations of the world, but over Israel Thou hast not given me power. He answered him, saying: Behold, thou hast power over them on the Day of Atonement if they have any sin, but if not, thou hast no power over them. Therefore they gave him a present<sup><xref rid="fn3277">7</xref></sup> on the Day of Atonement, in order that they should not bring their offering,<sup><xref rid="fn3278">8</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;One lot for the Lord, and the other lot for <italic>Azazel</italic>&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3279">9</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic> 8).</p>
<p>The lot for the Holy One, blessed be He, was the offering of a burnt offering, and the lot for Azazel was the goat as a sin offering, for all the iniquities of Israel were upon it, as it is said, &#x201C;And the goat shall bear upon him<sup><xref rid="fn3280">1</xref></sup> all their iniquities&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 22). Sammael saw that sin was not to be found among them on the Day of Atonement. He said before the Holy One, blessed be He: Sovereign of all the universe &#x0021; Thou hast one people like the ministering angels who are in heaven. Just as the ministering angels &#x007C;&#x007C; have bare feet,<sup><xref rid="fn3281">2</xref></sup> so have the Israelites bare feet on the Day of Atonement.<sup><xref rid="fn3282">3</xref></sup> Just as the ministering angels have neither food nor drink,<sup><xref rid="fn3283">4</xref></sup> so the Israelites have neither food nor drink on the Day of Atonement. Just as the ministering angels have no joints, in like wise the Israelites stand upon their feet. Just as the ministering angels have peace obtaining amongst them,<sup><xref rid="fn3284">5</xref></sup> so the Israelites have peace obtaining amongst them on the Day of Atonement.<sup><xref rid="fn3285">6</xref></sup> Just as the ministering angels are innocent of all sin on the Day of Atonement, so are the Israelites innocent of all sin on the Day of Atonement. The Holy One, blessed be He, hears the prayers<sup><xref rid="fn3286">7</xref></sup> of Israel rather than (the charges brought by) their accuser,<sup><xref rid="fn3287">8</xref></sup> and He makes atonement for the altar, and for the sanctuary, and for the priests,<sup><xref rid="fn3288">9</xref></sup> and for all the people of the congregation both great and small, as it is said, &#x201C;And he shall make atonement for the holy place&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 16).</p>
<p>Moses said: On the Day of Atonement I will behold the glory of the Holy One, blessed be He, and I will make atonement for the iniquities of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn3289">10</xref></sup> Moses spake before the Holy One, blessed be He: Sovereign of all the universe&#x0021; &#x201C;Shew me, I pray thee, thy glory&#x201D; (Ex. xxxiii. 18). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Moses&#x0021; Thou art not able to see My glory lest thou die, as it is said, &#x201C;For men shall not see me and live&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 20); but for the sake of the oath which I have sworn unto thee<sup><xref rid="fn3290">1</xref></sup> I will do thy will. Stand at the entrance of &#x007C;&#x007C; the cave,<sup><xref rid="fn3291">2</xref></sup> and I will make all the angels<sup><xref rid="fn3292">3</xref></sup> who move<sup><xref rid="fn3293">4</xref></sup> before Me pass before thy face. Stand in thy might, and do not fear, as it is said, &#x201C;And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 19). When thou dost hear the Name which I have spoken to thee,<sup><xref rid="fn3294">5</xref></sup> there am I before thee, as it is said, &#x201C;And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn3295">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The ministering angels said: Behold, we serve before Him by day and by night, and we are unable to see His glory,<sup><xref rid="fn3296">7</xref></sup> and this one born of woman<sup><xref rid="fn3297">8</xref></sup> desires to see His glory. And they arose<sup><xref rid="fn3298">9</xref></sup> in wrath and excitement<sup><xref rid="fn3299">10</xref></sup> to slay him, and his soul came nigh unto death.<sup><xref rid="fn3300">11</xref></sup> What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He revealed Himself unto him in a cloud,<sup><xref rid="fn3301">12</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord descended in the cloud&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxxiv. 5). This was the seventh descent.<sup><xref rid="fn3302">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Holy One, blessed be He, protected him<sup><xref rid="fn3303">14</xref></sup> with the hollow of His hand that he should not die, as it is said, &#x201C;And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by,<sup><xref rid="fn3304">15</xref></sup> that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover thee with my hand&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxxiii. 22). When the Holy One, blessed be He, had passed by, He removed the hollow of His hand from him, and he saw the traces of the Shekhinah, as it is said, &#x201C;And I will take away mine hand,<sup><xref rid="fn3305">1</xref></sup> and thou shalt see my back&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 28). Moses began to cry with a loud voice, and he said:<sup><xref rid="fn3306">2</xref></sup> &#x201C;O Lord, O Lord, a God full of compassion and gracious &#x2026;&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxxiv. 6).</p>
<p>Moses said before the Holy One, blessed be He: Sovereign of all worlds &#x0021; Pardon now the iniquities of this people.<sup><xref rid="fn3307">3</xref></sup> He said to him: Moses&#x0021; If thou hadst said, Pardon now the iniquities of all Israel, even to the end of all generations (He would have done so).<sup><xref rid="fn3308">4</xref></sup> It was an acceptable time. &#x007C;&#x007C; But thou hast said: Pardon, I beseech Thee, the iniquities of this people with reference to the affair of the calf. He said to him: Moses&#x0021; Behold, let it be according to thy words, as it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord said, I have pardoned according to thy word&#x201D; (Num. xiv. 20).<sup><xref rid="fn3309">5</xref></sup></p>

<title>CHAPTER XLVII</title>
<h1><small>THE ZEAL OF PHINEAS</small> [66<small>A</small>. i.]</h1>
<p><small>RABBI ELA&#x1E93;AR,</small> son of &#x2018;Arakh, said: When the Holy One, blessed be He, descended upon Mount Sinai to give the Torah to Israel, sixty myriads<sup><xref rid="fn3310">1</xref></sup> of the ministering angels descended with Him, corresponding to the sixty myriads of the mighty men of Israel, and in their hands were swords and crowns,<sup><xref rid="fn3311">2</xref></sup> and they crowned the Israelites with<sup><xref rid="fn3312">3</xref></sup> the Ineffable Name.<sup><xref rid="fn3313">4</xref></sup> All those days, whilst they had not done that deed,<sup><xref rid="fn3314">5</xref></sup> they were as good as<sup><xref rid="fn3315">6</xref></sup> the ministering angels before the Holy One, blessed be He. The Angel of Death did not hold sway over them, and they did not discharge any excretions<sup><xref rid="fn3316">7</xref></sup> like the children of man; but when they did that deed the Holy One, blessed be He, was angry with them, and He said to them: I thought that ye would be<sup><xref rid="fn3317">8</xref></sup> like the ministering angels, as it is said, &#x201C;I said, Ye are angels,<sup><xref rid="fn3318">9</xref></sup> and all of you sons of the Most High&#x201D; (Ps. lxxxii. 6). But now, &#x201C;Nevertheless, ye shall die like men&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 7).</p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah said: As long as a man is dressed in his garments of glory, he is beautiful in his appearance<sup><xref rid="fn3319">1</xref></sup> and in his honour;<sup><xref rid="fn3320">2</xref></sup> so were the Israelites when they apparelled themselves with that Name&#x2014;they were good before the Holy One, blessed be He, like the ministering angels. But when they did that deed (of the golden calf), the Holy One, blessed be He, was angry with them.<sup><xref rid="fn3321">3</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C; In that night the same<sup><xref rid="fn3322">4</xref></sup> sixty myriads of ministering angels<sup><xref rid="fn3323">5</xref></sup> descended,<sup><xref rid="fn3324">6</xref></sup> and they severally took from each one of them what they had put upon them, and they became bare,<sup><xref rid="fn3325">7</xref></sup> not according to their own wish, as it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn3326">8</xref></sup> &#x201C;And the children of Israel stripped themselves&#x201D; (Ex. xxxiii. 6). It is not written here,<sup><xref rid="fn3327">9</xref></sup> &#x201C;the children of Israel took away,&#x201D; but &#x201C;the children of Israel stripped themselves.&#x201D; Some say by itself (their adornment) was stripped off.<sup><xref rid="fn3328">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi said: At every place where Israel <italic>sat down</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3329">11</xref></sup> in the wilderness, they made idols<sup><xref rid="fn3330">12</xref></sup> for themselves, as it is said, &#x201C;And the people <italic>sat down</italic> to eat and to drink&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxxii. 6). What is written here? &#x201C;And they rose up to play&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>); they commenced to worship idols. One verse says, &#x201C;And Israel <italic>abode</italic> in Shittim&#x201D; (Num. xxv. 1). What is written here? &#x201C;And the people began to commit whoredom<sup><xref rid="fn3331">13</xref></sup> with the daughters of Moab&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). They commenced to be immoral.<sup><xref rid="fn3332">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah said: &#x201C;The counsel of the wicked is far from me&#x201D; (Job xxi. 16). This (text) refers to the counsel of Balaam, the wicked, who advised Midian, and there fell of Israel twenty-four thousand men. He said to them: You will not be able to prevail against this people, unless they have sinned before their Creator. They made for themselves booths<sup><xref rid="fn3333">1</xref></sup> outside the camp of Israel, and they sold all kinds of merchandise of the market. The young men of Israel went beyond the camp of Israel and they saw the daughters of Midian, who had painted<sup><xref rid="fn3334">2</xref></sup> their eyes like harlots, and they took wives of them, and went astray &#x007C;&#x007C; after them, as it is said, &#x201C;And the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab&#x201D; (Num. xxv. 1).<sup><xref rid="fn3335">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Simeon and Levi were exceedingly zealous because of the immorality, as it is said, &#x201C;And they said, As with an harlot<sup><xref rid="fn3336">4</xref></sup> should he deal with our sister?&#x201D; (Gen. xxxiv. 81). Each man took his sword and they slew the men of Shechem. The prince of the tribe of Simeon<sup><xref rid="fn3337">5</xref></sup> did not remember that which his ancestor<sup><xref rid="fn3338">6</xref></sup> had done, and he did not rebuke the young men of Israel, but he himself came<sup><xref rid="fn3339">7</xref></sup> publicly<sup><xref rid="fn3340">8</xref></sup> to the Midianitish woman for an immoral purpose, as it is said, &#x201C;Now the name of the man of Israel that was slain,<sup><xref rid="fn3336">4</xref></sup> who was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri&#x2026; a prince of a fathers&#x2019; house among the Simeonites&#x201D; (Num. xxv. 14).</p>
<p>All the princes with Moses, Eleazar, and Phineas saw the angel who was to destroy the people,<sup><xref rid="fn3341">1</xref></sup> and they sat down and wept, and they did not know what to do. Phineas saw how Zimri went publicly to the Midianitish woman for an immoral purpose, and he was moved by a great zeal,<sup><xref rid="fn3342">2</xref></sup> and he snatched the spear out of the hand of Moses, and ran after (Zimri) and pierced him through the back, through the pudenda, and the spear went into the belly of the woman. Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, gave a good reward to him and to his sons with the food of the shoulder.<sup><xref rid="fn3343">3</xref></sup> And the jaws were separated, the jaws of the man (from) the jaws of the woman; therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, gave him and his sons a good reward with the food of the cheeks,<sup><xref rid="fn3344">4</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And they shall give unto the priest the shoulder,<sup><xref rid="fn3345">5</xref></sup> and the two cheeks, and the maw&#x201D; (Deut. xviii. 3).</p>
<p>He arose like a great spiritual leader<sup><xref rid="fn3346">6</xref></sup> and he judged Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn3347">7</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Then stood up Phineas, &#x007C;&#x007C; and he executed <italic>judgment</italic>&#x201D; (Ps. cvi. 30). What is the meaning of this expression, &#x201C;And he executed judgment&#x201D;? Like a great judge. Just as thou dost say,<sup><xref rid="fn3348">8</xref></sup> &#x201C;And he shall pay as the judges determine&#x201D; (Ex. xxi. 22). And he smote the young men of Israel<sup><xref rid="fn3349">9</xref></sup> so that all Israel should see and fear, as it is said, &#x201C;And all Israel shall hear, and fear&#x201D; (Deut. xxi. 21).<sup><xref rid="fn3350">10</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, saw what Phineas had done, and forthwith was He filled with compassion; the plague was stayed, as it is said, &#x201C;And so the plague was stayed&#x201D; (Num. xvi. 50).</p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer said: He called<sup><xref rid="fn3351">1</xref></sup> the name of Phineas by<sup><xref rid="fn3352">2</xref></sup> the name of Elijah<sup><xref rid="fn3353">3</xref></sup>&#x2014;Elijah of blessed memory,<sup><xref rid="fn3354">4</xref></sup> (who was) of those who repented in Gilead, for he brought about the repentance of Israel<sup><xref rid="fn3355">5</xref></sup> in the land of Gilead. The Holy One, blessed be He, gave him the life of this world and the life of the world to come,<sup><xref rid="fn3356">6</xref></sup> as it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn3357">7</xref></sup> &#x201C;My covenant was with him<sup><xref rid="fn3358">8</xref></sup> of <italic>life</italic> and <italic>peace</italic>&#x201D; (Mal. ii. 5). He gave to him and to his sons a good reward,<sup><xref rid="fn3359">9</xref></sup> in order that (he might have) the everlasting priesthood, as it is said, &#x201C;And it shall be unto him, and to his seed<sup><xref rid="fn3360">10</xref></sup> after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood&#x201D; (Num. xxv. 13).</p>
<p>Rabbi Ela&#x1E93;ar of Modein said: Phineas arose, and pronounced the ban<sup><xref rid="fn3361">11</xref></sup> upon Israel by the mystery of the Ineffable Name, and with the script which was written on the tables (of the Law), and by the ban of the celestial Court of Justice,<sup><xref rid="fn3362">12</xref></sup> and by the ban of the terrestrial Court of Justice, that a man of Israel should not drink the wine of the nations<sup><xref rid="fn3363">1</xref></sup> unless it had been trodden by the feet, as it is said, &#x201C;And as for my sheep, that which ye have trodden with your feet<sup><xref rid="fn3364">2</xref></sup> they eat, and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3365">3</xref></sup> (Ezek. xxxiv. 19). Because all the wine of the nations was devoted to idolatry and immorality, for they took the first of their new wine for idolatry and immorality,<sup><xref rid="fn3366">4</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Whoredom and wine<sup><xref rid="fn3367">5</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C; and new wine take away the heart&#x201D; (Hos. iv. 11).</p>
<p>Rabbi Phineas said: The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses: Do ye remember what those Midianites did to you, for twenty-four thousand men fell in Israel? But before &#x201C;thou art gathered in,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3368">6</xref></sup> arise, execute vengeance,<sup><xref rid="fn3369">7</xref></sup> (as it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn3370">8</xref></sup>) &#x201C;Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites; afterwards shalt thou be gathered unto thy people&#x201D; (Num. xxxi. 2).<sup><xref rid="fn3371">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>What did Moses do? He took a thousand men<sup><xref rid="fn3372">10</xref></sup> (and) a prince<sup><xref rid="fn3373">11</xref></sup> from each tribe of the tribes of Israel. Behold, (there were) twelve thousand (men), and he who had been zealous because of the immorality, was the prince<sup><xref rid="fn3374">12</xref></sup> over them. The<sup><xref rid="fn3375">13</xref></sup> holy vestments and the trumpets of alarm<sup><xref rid="fn3376">14</xref></sup> were in his hand,<sup><xref rid="fn3377">1</xref></sup> and they went, and they took captive the daughters of Midian, and they brought them (to the camp).<sup><xref rid="fn3378">2</xref></sup> (Moses) said to (Phineas): Because of these did not twenty-four thousand men of Israel fall? as it is said, &#x201C;Behold, these<sup><xref rid="fn3379">3</xref></sup> caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam,<sup><xref rid="fn3380">4</xref></sup> to commit trespass against the Lord in the matter of Peor&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 16); and he began to be angry with them, as it is said, &#x201C;And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 14).<sup><xref rid="fn3381">5</xref></sup> During his anger the Holy Spirit departed from him.

<h1><small>THE EGYPTIAN BONDAGE</small> [67<small>A</small>. i.]</h1>
<p>R<small>ABBAN</small> J<small>OCHANAN</small>, son of &#x1E92;akkai, opened (his exposition with the text): &#x201C;In that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram,<sup><xref rid="fn3389">1</xref></sup> saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates&#x201D; (Gen. xv. 18). Abram said before the Holy One, blessed be He, Sovereign of all the universe &#x0021; Thou hast not given me seed, yet dost Thou say, &#x201C;Unto thy seed will I give<sup><xref rid="fn3390">2</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C; this land&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). He said: &#x201C;Whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 8). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Abram&#x0021; The entire world stands by My word,<sup><xref rid="fn3391">3</xref></sup> and thou dost not believe in My word, but thou sayest, &#x201C;Whereby <italic>shall I know</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3392">4</xref></sup> that I shall inherit it?&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). By thy life&#x0021; In two ways shalt thou surely know, as it is said, &#x201C;And he said to Abram, Know of <italic>a surety</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3393">5</xref></sup> that thy <italic>seed</italic> shall be a <italic>stranger</italic> in a land which is not theirs,&#x2026; and <italic>they shall afflict them</italic>&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 18).</p>
<p>Rabbi Ela&#x1E93;ar, son of &#x2018;A&#x1E93;ariah, said: Is it not so that the Israelites did not dwell in Egypt except for 210<sup><xref rid="fn3394">6</xref></sup> years? But in order to teach thee, know that this is so, come and see; for when Joseph went down to Egypt he was seventeen years old, and when he stood before Pharaoh he was thirty years old, as it is said, &#x201C;And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood<sup><xref rid="fn3395">1</xref></sup> before Pharaoh, king of Egypt&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xli. 46). And the seven years of plenty, and the two years of famine, behold, they are nine-and-thirty years (in all). And Levi, the son of Jacob, was six years older than Joseph,<sup><xref rid="fn3396">2</xref></sup> and when he went down to Egypt he was forty-five years,<sup><xref rid="fn3397">3</xref></sup> and the years of his life in Egypt were ninety-two years;<sup><xref rid="fn3398">4</xref></sup> behold, all of them (amount to) 137 years, (as it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn3399">5</xref></sup>) &#x201C;And the years of the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years&#x201D; (Ex. vi. 16). On his going down to Egypt, his wife bare unto him Jochebed, his daughter,<sup><xref rid="fn3400">6</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And the name of Amram&#x2019;s wife was Jochebed&#x201D; (Num.</p>
<p>xxvi.	59), and she was 130 years<sup><xref rid="fn3401">7</xref></sup> when she bare Moses, (as it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn3402">8</xref></sup>) &#x201C;And Moses was fourscore years old when he stood before Pharaoh&#x201D; (Ex. vii. 7). &#x007C;&#x007C; Behold, (the total is) 210 years in all.<sup><xref rid="fn3403">9</xref></sup> And thus it says, &#x201C;And they shall serve them; and they shall afflict them<sup><xref rid="fn3404">10</xref></sup> four hundred years&#x201D; (Gen. xv. 18).</p>
<p>Rabbi Ela&#x1E93;ar, son of &#x2018;Arakh, said to them:<sup><xref rid="fn3405">11</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, said this to Abraham only at the hour when he had seed, as it is said, &#x201C;Thy <italic>seed</italic> shall be a stranger<sup><xref rid="fn3406">1</xref></sup> in a land that is not theirs&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). From the time when Isaac was born until Israel went forth from Egypt 400 years (elapsed).<sup><xref rid="fn3407">2</xref></sup> (Rabban Jochanan, son of &#x1E92;akkai<sup><xref rid="fn3408">3</xref></sup>) said to him: Verily it is written, &#x201C;Now the sojourning of the children of Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn3409">4</xref></sup> which they sojourned in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years&#x201D; (Ex. xii. 40). He answered him, saying: 210<sup><xref rid="fn3410">5</xref></sup> years Israel abode in Egypt, and five years before Jacob came to Egypt there were born unto Joseph(the fathers of) two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim,<sup><xref rid="fn3411">6</xref></sup> and they belonged to the Israelites.<sup><xref rid="fn3412">7</xref></sup> Behold, (we have) 215 years of days and nights,<sup><xref rid="fn3413">8</xref></sup> (this equals) 430 years; for the Holy One, blessed be He, reduced<sup><xref rid="fn3414">9</xref></sup> the time for the sake of the merit of the Patriarchs, for they are the mountains of the world,<sup><xref rid="fn3415">10</xref></sup> and for the sake of the merit of the Mothers,<sup><xref rid="fn3416">11</xref></sup> for they are the hills of the world, and concerning them the Scripture says, &#x201C;The voice of my beloved &#x0021; Behold, he cometh,<sup><xref rid="fn3417">1</xref></sup> leaping upon the mountains, <italic>skipping</italic> over the hills&#x201D; (Cant. ii. 8).</p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer said: During all those years, when the Israelites abode in Egypt, they dwelt securely and peacefully at ease<sup><xref rid="fn3418">2</xref></sup> until Ganoon,<sup><xref rid="fn3419">3</xref></sup> one of the grandchildren of Ephraim, came and said to them, The Holy One, blessed be He, has revealed Himself to me,<sup><xref rid="fn3420">4</xref></sup> to lead you out of Egypt. The children of Ephraim, in the pride of their heart, for they were of the royal seed,<sup><xref rid="fn3421">5</xref></sup> and mighty men in battle,<sup><xref rid="fn3422">6</xref></sup> took their wives and their sons, &#x007C;&#x007C; and they went forth from Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn3423">7</xref></sup> The Egyptians pursued after them, and slew of them 200,000, all of them mighty men,<sup><xref rid="fn3424">8</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;The children of Ephraim,<sup><xref rid="fn3425">9</xref></sup> being armed and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle&#x201D; (Ps. lxxviii. 9).</p>
<p>Rabbi Jannai said: The Egyptians did not enslave the Israelites but for one hour of the day<sup><xref rid="fn3426">10</xref></sup> of the Holy One, blessed be He, (that is to say, for) <img src="images/Art_P36.jpg" alt="art" /> years. Whilst<sup><xref rid="fn3427">11</xref></sup> yet Moses was not born, the magicians said to Pharaoh: In the future a child will be born, and he will take Israel out of Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn3428">12</xref></sup> Pharaoh thought, and said:<sup><xref rid="fn3429">13</xref></sup> Cast ye all the male children into the river, and he<sup><xref rid="fn3430">1</xref></sup> will be thrown in with them,<sup><xref rid="fn3431">2</xref></sup> and thereby the word (of the magicians) will be frustrated; therefore they cast all the (male) children into the river.</p>
<p>Three years (elapsed) until<sup><xref rid="fn3432">3</xref></sup> the birth of Moses. When Moses was born they said (to Pharaoh): Behold, he is born, and he is hidden from our vision. (Pharaoh) said to them: Since he is born, henceforth ye shall not cast the male children into the river, but put upon them a hard yoke<sup><xref rid="fn3433">4</xref></sup> to embitter the years of their lives with hard labour,<sup><xref rid="fn3434">5</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And they made their lives bitter&#x201D; (Ex. i. 14).</p>
<p>Rabbi Nathaniel said: The parents of Moses saw the child, (for) his form was like that of an angel of God.<sup><xref rid="fn3435">6</xref></sup> They circumcised him on the eighth day,<sup><xref rid="fn3436">7</xref></sup> and they called his name Jekuthiel.<sup><xref rid="fn3437">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Simeon said: They called him &#x1E6C;ob (good), as it is said, &#x201C;And when she saw him that he was <italic>good</italic>&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> ii. 2). They concealed him in a house &#x007C;&#x007C; of<sup><xref rid="fn3438">9</xref></sup> the earth for three months. After three months<sup><xref rid="fn3439">10</xref></sup> she put him in an ark of bulrushes, and she cast him upon the bank of the river. All things are revealed before the Holy One, blessed be He. Now Bithyah,<sup><xref rid="fn3440">11</xref></sup> the daughter of Pharaoh, was<sup><xref rid="fn3441">12</xref></sup> smitten sorely with leprosy and she was not able to bathe in hot water,<sup><xref rid="fn3442">1</xref></sup> and she came to bathe in the river, and she saw the crying child. She put forth her hand and took hold of him, and she was healed.<sup><xref rid="fn3443">2</xref></sup> She said: This child is righteous, and I will preserve his life. Whosoever preserves a life<sup><xref rid="fn3444">3</xref></sup> is as though he had kept alive the whole world. Therefore was she worthy to (inherit) the life in this world and the life in the world to come.</p>
<p>All the household of Pharaoh&#x2019;s palace were (helping) to educate (Moses), as it is said, &#x201C;And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out unto his brethren&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 11).<sup><xref rid="fn3445">4</xref></sup> Moses went into the camp of Israel, and saw one of the taskmasters of Pharaoh smiting one of the sons of Kohath, the Levites, for they were his brethren, as it is said, &#x201C;And he saw an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, <italic>one of his brethren</italic>&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3446">5</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic>). He began to rebuke him with the sword of his lips,<sup><xref rid="fn3447">6</xref></sup> and he slew him, and buried him in the midst of the camp, as it is said, &#x201C;And he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 12). The word Ch&#x00F4;l (sand) signifies (here) Israel only, as it is said, &#x201C;Yet the number of children of Israel shall be as the <italic>sand</italic> of the sea&#x201D; (Hos. i. 10).</p>
<p>He went forth on the second day, and saw two Hebrew men striving. Who were they? &#x007C;&#x007C; Dathan and Abiram, as it is said, &#x201C;And he said to him that did the wrong,<sup><xref rid="fn3448">1</xref></sup> Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?&#x201D; (Ex. ii. 18).<sup><xref rid="fn3449">2</xref></sup> Dathan said to him: What&#x0021; Dost thou wish to kill me with the sword of thy mouth as thou didst kill the Egyptian yesterday, as it is said, &#x201C;Who made thee a prince and a judge over us?<sup><xref rid="fn3450">3</xref></sup> Speakest thou<sup><xref rid="fn3451">4</xref></sup> to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian?&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 14). &#x201C;Seekest thou to kill me&#x201D; is not written (in the Scripture) here, but &#x201C;Speakest thou to kill me.&#x201D;</p>
<p>When Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh, they said to him: &#x201C;Thus saith the Lord,<sup><xref rid="fn3448">1</xref></sup> the God of Israel, Let my people go&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> v. 1), that they may serve Me.<sup><xref rid="fn3452">5</xref></sup> He said: I know not the Lord. &#x201C;Who is the Lord,<sup><xref rid="fn3448">1</xref></sup> that I should hearken unto his voice to let Israel go? I know not the Lord, and moreover I will not let Israel go&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 2).<sup><xref rid="fn3453">6</xref></sup> Aaron cast down his rod,<sup><xref rid="fn3454">7</xref></sup> and it became a fiery serpent. The<sup><xref rid="fn3455">8</xref></sup> magicians also cast down their rods, and they became fiery serpents. The rod of Aaron ran and swallowed them up with their rods, as it is said, &#x201C;And Aaron&#x2019;s rod swallowed up their rods&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> vii. 12).</p>
<p>(Moses) put his hand into his bosom, and brought it forth leprous like snow, and the magicians also put their hands in their bosoms, and brought them forth leprous like snow. But they were not healed till the day of their death.<sup><xref rid="fn3456">1</xref></sup> Every plague which the Holy One, blessed be He, brought upon them,<sup><xref rid="fn3457">2</xref></sup> they also produced every plague until He brought upon them the boils, and they were not able to stand and to do likewise,<sup><xref rid="fn3458">3</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And the magicians could not<sup><xref rid="fn3459">4</xref></sup> stand before Moses because of the boils&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> ix. 11).</p>
<p>Rabbi &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: The executioners<sup><xref rid="fn3460">5</xref></sup> of Pharaoh used to strangle the Israelites in the walls of the houses,<sup><xref rid="fn3461">6</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C; and the Holy One, blessed be He, heard their cry, as it is said, &#x201C;And God heard their groaning,<sup><xref rid="fn3459">4</xref></sup> and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> ii. 24). Further, they burnt their children in the furnace of fire,<sup><xref rid="fn3462">7</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;But the Lord hath taken you,<sup><xref rid="fn3459">4</xref></sup> and brought you forth out of the iron <italic>furnace</italic>, out of Egypt&#x201D; (Deut. iv. 20).</p>
<p>When<sup><xref rid="fn3463">8</xref></sup> Israel went forth,<sup><xref rid="fn3464">9</xref></sup> what did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He cast down all the idols of their abominations, and they were broken,<sup><xref rid="fn3465">1</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Upon their gods also the Lord executed judgments&#x201D; (Num. xxxiii. 4).</p>
<p>Rabbi Joseph<sup><xref rid="fn3466">2</xref></sup> said: The Egyptians defiled the Israelites and their wives with them.<sup><xref rid="fn3467">3</xref></sup> Bedijah, the grandson of Dan, married a wife from his tribe, Shelomith, daughter of Dibri,<sup><xref rid="fn3468">4</xref></sup> and in that night the taskmasters of Pharaoh came in unto her, for they slew him and came in unto her, and she conceived and bare a son. In every case the offspring follows the (nature of) the seed:<sup><xref rid="fn3469">5</xref></sup> if it be sweet, it will be due to the sweet (seed); if it be bitter, it will be due to the bitter (seed). And when Israel went forth from Egypt, he<sup><xref rid="fn3470">6</xref></sup> began to blaspheme and revile the Name of the God of Israel, as it is said, &#x201C;And the son of the Israelitish woman blasphemed the<sup><xref rid="fn3471">7</xref></sup> Name, and cursed&#x201D; (Lev. xxiv. 11).</p>
<p>Rabbi Ishmael said: The five fingers of the right hand of the Holy One, blessed be He, all of them appertain to the mystery<sup><xref rid="fn3472">8</xref></sup> of the Redemption.<sup><xref rid="fn3473">9</xref></sup> He showed the little finger of the hand to Noah,<sup><xref rid="fn3474">10</xref></sup> (pointing out) how to make the ark, as it is said, &#x201C;And <italic>this</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3475">11</xref></sup> is how thou shalt make it&#x201D; (Gen. vi. 15). With the second finger, which is next to the little one, He smote the firstborn of the Egyptians,<sup><xref rid="fn3476">12</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;The magicians said unto Pharaoh, &#x007C;&#x007C; This is the finger of God&#x201D; (Ex. viii. 19). With how many (plagues) were they smitten with the finger? With ten plagues.<sup><xref rid="fn3477">1</xref></sup> With the third finger, which is the third (starting from) the little finger, He wrote the tables (of the Law), as it is said, &#x201C;And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end<sup><xref rid="fn3478">2</xref></sup> of communing with him&#x2026; tables of stone, written with the finger of God&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxxi. 18). With the fourth finger, which is next to the thumb, the Holy One, blessed be He, showed<sup><xref rid="fn3479">3</xref></sup> to Moses what the children of Israel should give for the redemption of their souls,<sup><xref rid="fn3480">4</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;<italic>This</italic> they shall give<sup><xref rid="fn3481">5</xref></sup>&#x2026; half a shekel for an offering to the Lord&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxx. 18). With the thumb and all the hand the Holy One, blessed be He, will smite in the future all the children of Esau, for they are His foes,<sup><xref rid="fn3482">6</xref></sup> and likewise (will He smite) the children of Ishmael, for they are His enemies, as it is said, &#x201C;Let thine <italic>hand</italic> be lifted up above thine adversaries, and let all thine enemies be cut off&#x201D; (Mic. v. 9).</p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer said: The five letters of the Torah, which alone of all the letters in the Torah are of double (shape),<sup><xref rid="fn3483">7</xref></sup> all appertain to the mystery of the Redemption.<sup><xref rid="fn3484">8</xref></sup> With &#x201C;Khaph&#x201D; &#x201C;Khaph&#x201D; our father Abraham was redeemed from Ur of the Chaldees, as it is said, (Le<italic>kh</italic> Le<italic>kha</italic>) &#x201C;Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred<sup><xref rid="fn3485">9</xref></sup>&#x2026; unto the land that I will shew thee&#x201D; (Gen. xii. 1). With &#x201C;Mem&#x201D; &#x201C;Mem&#x201D; our father Isaac was redeemed from the land<sup><xref rid="fn3486">1</xref></sup> of the Philistines, as it is said, &#x201C;Go from us:<sup><xref rid="fn3487">2</xref></sup> for thou art much mightier (<italic>M</italic>emennu <italic>M</italic>&#x2019;&#x00F4;d) than we&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxvi. 16). With &#x201C;Nun&#x201D; &#x201C;Nun&#x201D; our father Jacob was redeemed from the hand of Esau,<sup><xref rid="fn3488">3</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Deliver me, I pray thee,<sup><xref rid="fn3487">2</xref></sup> (Hazil&#x00EA;<italic>n</italic>e <italic>n</italic>a) from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxxii. 11). With &#x201C;P&#x00EA;&#x201D; &#x201C;P&#x00EA;&#x201D; Israel<sup><xref rid="fn3489">4</xref></sup> was redeemed from Egypt, as it is said, &#x201C;I have surely visited you,<sup><xref rid="fn3490">5</xref></sup> (<italic>P</italic>a&#x1E33;&#x00F4;d <italic>P</italic>a&#x1E33;adti) and (seen) that which is done to you in Egypt, and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt&#x201D; (Ex. iii. 16, 17). With &#x201C;Zaddi&#x201D; &#x201C;Zaddi&#x201D; the Holy One, blessed be He, in the future will redeem Israel from the oppression of the kingdoms,<sup><xref rid="fn3491">6</xref></sup> and He will say to them, I have caused a branch to spring forth for you, as it is said, &#x201C;Behold, the man whose name is (Zemach) the Branch;<sup><xref rid="fn3492">7</xref></sup> and he shall grow up (yizmach) &#x007C;&#x007C; out of his place,<sup><xref rid="fn3487">2</xref></sup> and he shall build the temple of the Lord&#x201D; (Zech. vi. 12).<sup><xref rid="fn3493">8</xref></sup> These letters were delivered only to our father Abraham. Our father Abraham delivered them to Isaac, and Isaac (delivered them) to Jacob, and Jacob delivered the mystery of the Redemption to Joseph, as it is said, &#x201C;But God will surely visit (<italic>P</italic>a&#x1E33;&#x00F4;d yi<italic>p</italic>h&#x1E33;&#x00F4;d) you&#x201D; (Gen. 1. 24). Joseph his son delivered the secret of the Redemption to his brethren. Asher, the son of Jacob, delivered the mystery of the Redemption to Serach<sup><xref rid="fn3494">9</xref></sup> his daughter. When Moses and Aaron came to the elders of Israel and performed the signs in their sight, the elders of Israel went to<sup><xref rid="fn3495">10</xref></sup> Serach, the daughter of Asher, and they said to her: A certain man has come, and he has performed signs in our sight, thus and thus.<sup><xref rid="fn3496">1</xref></sup> She said to them: There is no reality in the signs. They said to her: He said &#x201C;<italic>P</italic>a&#x1E33;&#x00F4;d yi<italic>p</italic>h&#x1E33;&#x00F4;d&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;God will surely visit you&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn3497">2</xref></sup> She said to them: He is the man who will redeem Israel in the future from Egypt, for thus did I hear,<sup><xref rid="fn3498">3</xref></sup> (&#x201C;<italic>P</italic>a&#x1E33;&#x00F4;d <italic>P</italic>a&#x1E33;adti&#x201D;) &#x201C;I have surely visited you&#x201D; (Ex. iii. 16). Forthwith the people believed<sup><xref rid="fn3499">4</xref></sup> in their God and in His messenger, as it is said, &#x201C;And the people believed,<sup><xref rid="fn3500">5</xref></sup> and when they heard that the Lord <italic>had visited</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3501">6</xref></sup> the children of Israel&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> iv. 31).<sup><xref rid="fn3502">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: The taskmasters of Pharaoh were beating the Israelites in order that they should make<sup><xref rid="fn3503">8</xref></sup> the tale of bricks, and it is said, &#x201C;And the tale of the bricks,<sup><xref rid="fn3504">9</xref></sup> which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> v. 8).<sup><xref rid="fn3505">10</xref></sup> The Israelites were gathering the straw of the wilderness, and they were carrying it on their asses and (also on) their wives,<sup><xref rid="fn3506">11</xref></sup> and their sons. The straw of the wilderness pierced their heels,<sup><xref rid="fn3507">12</xref></sup> and the blood was mingled<sup><xref rid="fn3508">13</xref></sup> with the mortar. Rachel, the granddaughter &#x007C;&#x007C; of Shuthelach,<sup><xref rid="fn3509">14</xref></sup> was near childbirth, and with her husband she was treading the mortar, and the child was born (there) and became entangled in the brick mould.<sup><xref rid="fn3510">1</xref></sup> Her cry ascended before the Throne of Glory.<sup><xref rid="fn3511">2</xref></sup> The angel Michael<sup><xref rid="fn3512">3</xref></sup> descended and took the brick mould with its clay, and brought it up before the Throne of Glory.<sup><xref rid="fn3513">4</xref></sup> That night the Holy One, blessed be He, descended,<sup><xref rid="fn3514">5</xref></sup> and smote the firstborn of the Egyptians, as it is said, &#x201C;And it came to pass at midnight<sup><xref rid="fn3515">6</xref></sup> that the Lord smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xii. 29).<sup><xref rid="fn3516">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jos&#x00E9;<sup><xref rid="fn3517">8</xref></sup> said: All that night the Israelites were eating and drinking, rejoicing and taking wine and praising<sup><xref rid="fn3518">9</xref></sup> their God with a loud voice,<sup><xref rid="fn3519">10</xref></sup> whilst the Egyptians were crying with a bitter soul,<sup><xref rid="fn3520">11</xref></sup> because of the plague<sup><xref rid="fn3521">12</xref></sup> which came upon them suddenly,<sup><xref rid="fn3522">13</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And there was a great cry in Egypt;<sup><xref rid="fn3523">14</xref></sup> for there was not a house where there was not one dead&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 80).</p>
<p>The Holy One, blessed be He, said: If I bring forth the Israelites by night, they<sup><xref rid="fn3524">15</xref></sup> will say, He has done His deeds like a thief.<sup><xref rid="fn3525">16</xref></sup> Therefore, behold, I will bring them forth when the sun is in his zenith at midday.<sup><xref rid="fn3526">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>By the merit of three things<sup><xref rid="fn3527">1</xref></sup> Israel went forth from Egypt: (1) They did not change their language; (2) they did not change their names;<sup><xref rid="fn3528">2</xref></sup> (8) and they did not slander one another. In the unity of (God&#x2019;s) Name Israel went forth from Egypt full of all good things, comprising (all) blessings,<sup><xref rid="fn3529">3</xref></sup> because He remembered the word which He spake to our father Abraham,<sup><xref rid="fn3530">4</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And also that nation, whom they shall serve,<sup><xref rid="fn3531">5</xref></sup> will I judge, and afterwards shall they come out with great substance&#x201D; (Gen. xv. 14).</p>

Israel was called God&#x2019;s firstborn. When God bade Pharaoh to send forth His firstborn son Israel, he refused. In return God smote his firstborn. The Jewish teaching as to the Divine method of retribution is well expressed by the Book of Wisdom xi. 16, which refers to the plagues thus: &#x201C;That they might know that by what things a man sinneth, thereby he is punished.&#x201D; Cf. Revelation of Peter, 7 and 9, for a parallel view of retribution. As a parallel to our text, the following verse from Wisdom xviii. 5 seems appropriate: &#x201C;But them who plotted to slay the infants of the holy ones (and when a single child had been exposed and saved) Thou to convict them didst deprive of the multitude of their children, and all together didst destroy them in a mighty flood.&#x201D; Jubilees xlviii. 14 says: &#x201C;A thousand strong and brave men perished for one infant whom they had cast into the river.&#x201D; For further illustrations see Goodrick, <italic>Wisdom,</italic> p. 352.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER XLIX</title>
<h1><small>THE SEED OF AMALEK</small> [69<small>B</small>. i.]</h1>
<p>&#x007C;&#x007C; R<small>ABBI</small> S<small>IMEON</small>, son of Jochai, said: The Holy One, blessed be He, wished to destroy and to cut off all the seed of Amalek.<sup><xref rid="fn3535">1</xref></sup> He sent to Saul, the son of Kish, to destroy and to cut off all the seed of Amalek. Saul and the people heard, and did not spare any vile man except Agag, as it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn3536">2</xref></sup> &#x201C;But Saul and the people spared<sup><xref rid="fn3537">3</xref></sup> Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen&#x201D; (1 Sam. xv. 9). Samuel heard (thereof), and he went to meet them, and he said to them: Ye have spared Amalek, and ye have left over a remnant of him.<sup><xref rid="fn3538">4</xref></sup> They said to him: The sheep and the oxen are for sacrifices<sup><xref rid="fn3539">5</xref></sup> unto thy God. (Samuel) said to (Saul): The Omnipresent hath no delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, but only in obeying His voice and in doing His will, as it is said, &#x201C;And Samuel said, Hath the Lord as great delight<sup><xref rid="fn3537">3</xref></sup> in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 22).</p>
<p>Rabbi Phineas said: The Holy One, blessed be He, saw that in the future there would arise from Agag a man, a great enemy and adversary of the Jews.<sup><xref rid="fn3540">6</xref></sup> Who was this? This was Haman, as it is said, &#x201C;Because Haman, the son of Hammedatha,<sup><xref rid="fn3541">1</xref></sup> the <italic>Agagite</italic>, the enemy of all the Jews&#x201D; (Esth. ix. 24). From the seed of Saul (arose) an avenger and a redeemer for Israel, (who delivered them) out of the hand of Haman. Who was this? This was Mordecai, as it is said, &#x201C;There was a certain Jew<sup><xref rid="fn3541">1</xref></sup> in Shushan, the capital, whose name was Mordecai&#x2026; the son of Kish, a Benjamite&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> ii. 5).</p>
<p>And there stood Samuel before the Holy One, blessed be He, and he said: Sovereign of all the Universe &#x0021; Do not forget the sin<sup><xref rid="fn3542">2</xref></sup> which Esau did to his father, &#x007C;&#x007C; for he took strange women (for his wives), who offered sacrifices and burnt incense to idols, to embitter the years of the life of his parents.<sup><xref rid="fn3543">3</xref></sup> Remember his sin unto his sons and unto his grandsons unto the end of all generations, as it is said, &#x201C;Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered<sup><xref rid="fn3541">1</xref></sup> with the Lord&#x201D; (Ps. cix. 14). Samuel heard the voice of Agag muttering with his mouth, saying: Perhaps the bitterness of the evil death has passed from me, as it is said, &#x201C;And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past&#x201D; (1 Sam. xv. 32). Samuel said to him:<sup><xref rid="fn3544">4</xref></sup> Just as the sword of Amalek thy ancestor consumed the young men of Israel who were outside the cloud,<sup><xref rid="fn3545">5</xref></sup> so that their women dwelt (as) childless women and widows,<sup><xref rid="fn3546">6</xref></sup> so by the prayer of the women<sup><xref rid="fn3547">7</xref></sup> all the sons<sup><xref rid="fn3548">8</xref></sup> of Amalek shall be slain, and their women shall dwell (as) childless women and widows. And by the prayer of Esther and her maidens all the sons of Amalek were slain and their women remained childless and widowed, as it is said, &#x201C;And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless,<sup><xref rid="fn3549">1</xref></sup> so shall thy mother be childless among women&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 33).</p>
<p>The prayer of Samuel destroyed<sup><xref rid="fn3550">2</xref></sup> the power of the children of Agag against Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn3551">3</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And Samuel broke<sup><xref rid="fn3552">4</xref></sup> Agag before the Lord in Gilgal&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>The Holy One, blessed be He, said: He has made his attack against the heavenly beings,<sup><xref rid="fn3553">5</xref></sup> (and God) will send against them insignificant things, to teach them that the power of their might is nought. When Titus,<sup><xref rid="fn3554">6</xref></sup> the wicked, entered the Holy of Holies, he said: No adversary &#x007C;&#x007C; or enemy can prevail against me. What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do to him? He sent a single gnat,<sup><xref rid="fn3555">7</xref></sup> and it went into his nostril, and it ate its way into his brain. That gnat became like a young pigeon, weighing two pounds,<sup><xref rid="fn3556">8</xref></sup> to teach him that there was nothing at all in the might of his power. When Israel<sup><xref rid="fn3557">9</xref></sup> walked in the Holy of Holies with a proud heart, and said: No adversary or enemy<sup><xref rid="fn3558">10</xref></sup> is able to stand before us. What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do to them? He sent against them a man, proud and like one sifting the sea, Nebuchadnezzar, whose name was Kabb&#x012B;r Mayim (like one sifting the sea),<sup><xref rid="fn3559">11</xref></sup> to teach; &#x201C;For by strength shall no man prevail&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> ii. 9).<sup><xref rid="fn3560">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Chakhinai<sup><xref rid="fn3561">2</xref></sup> said: The Holy One, blessed be He, set<sup><xref rid="fn3562">3</xref></sup> no limit to the kingdoms, except to the Egyptian bondage,<sup><xref rid="fn3563">4</xref></sup> and to the kingdom of Babylon. Whence do we know this about the Egyptian bondage? Because it is said, &#x201C;And they shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years&#x201D; (Gen. xv. 13). The Holy One, blessed be He, dealt according to the abundance of His tender mercy,<sup><xref rid="fn3564">5</xref></sup> and He shortened (this time limit) by its half,<sup><xref rid="fn3565">6</xref></sup> 210 years.<sup><xref rid="fn3566">7</xref></sup> Whence do we know about the Babylonian kingdom? Because it is said, &#x201C;For thus saith the Lord,<sup><xref rid="fn3567">8</xref></sup> After seventy years be accomplished for Babylon, I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place&#x201D; (Jer. xxix. 10).</p>
<p>Rabbi Abbahu said: Forty-five years did Nebuchadnezzar reign. Know that it is so. In the year<sup><xref rid="fn3568">9</xref></sup> when he began to reign, he went up to Jerusalem, and conquered Jehoiakim, king of Judah, as it is said, &#x201C;In the third year of the reign of &#x007C;&#x007C; Jehoiakim, king of Judah,<sup><xref rid="fn3569">10</xref></sup> came Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem, and besieged it&#x201D; (Dan. i. 1). For eight years he ruled over the kingdom of Jehoiakim, and eleven years Zedekiah ruled.<sup><xref rid="fn3570">11</xref></sup> (Behold,) nineteen years before he destroyed the Temple. (Thereafter he ruled) twenty-six years.<sup><xref rid="fn3571">1</xref></sup> Know that it is so. Come and see from the exile of Jehoiachin until his son Evil-Merodach<sup><xref rid="fn3572">2</xref></sup> reigned thirty-seven<sup><xref rid="fn3573">3</xref></sup> years elapsed, as it is said, &#x201C;And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin,<sup><xref rid="fn3574">4</xref></sup> king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-Merodach, king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, did lift up the head of Jehoiachin, king of Judah, out of prison&#x201D; (2 Kings xxv. 27).</p>
<p>Rabbi Jonathan said: The last of the kings of Media<sup><xref rid="fn3575">5</xref></sup> was Artaxerxes,<sup><xref rid="fn3576">6</xref></sup> king of Babylon, and he reigned thirty-two years, as it is said, &#x201C;But in all this time I was not in Jerusalem;<sup><xref rid="fn3577">7</xref></sup> for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes, king of Babylon, I went unto the king&#x201D; (Neh. xiii. 6).<sup><xref rid="fn3578">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Tachanah<sup><xref rid="fn3579">9</xref></sup> said: Come and see how wealthy Ahasuerus was, for he was wealthier than all the kings of Media and Persia, and concerning him the Scripture saith, &#x201C;And the fourth shall be far richer than they all&#x201D; (Dan. xi. 2). What was the wealth of Ahasuerus? He erected couches of gold and silver in the streets<sup><xref rid="fn3580">10</xref></sup> of the city, to show all the peoples<sup><xref rid="fn3581">11</xref></sup> how rich he was, as it is said, &#x201C;The couches were of gold and silver&#x201D; (Esth. i. 6). All the vessels used by Ahasuerus were not vessels of silver, but vessels of gold.<sup><xref rid="fn3582">1</xref></sup> He brought the vessels of the Temple, and all the vessels of his palace were changed in appearance,<sup><xref rid="fn3583">2</xref></sup> so that they became like lead, as it is said, &#x201C;The vessels being <italic>diverse</italic> one from another&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 7).</p>
<p>All the pavement of his palace consisted of precious stones and pearls, &#x007C;&#x007C; as it is said, &#x201C;Upon a pavement of porphyry, and white marble,<sup><xref rid="fn3584">3</xref></sup> and alabaster, and <italic>stone</italic> of blue colour&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 6).</p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer said: For half the year Ahasuerus made great banquets for all the peoples, as it is said, &#x201C;Many days, even an hundred and eighty days&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 4). Every people<sup><xref rid="fn3585">4</xref></sup> who ate its food in impurity,<sup><xref rid="fn3586">5</xref></sup> had its food provided in impurity, and every people who ate its food in purity<sup><xref rid="fn3587">6</xref></sup> had its food provided (according to the regulations of) purity,<sup><xref rid="fn3588">7</xref></sup> as it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn3589">8</xref></sup> &#x201C;That they should do according to every man&#x2019;s pleasure&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 8).<sup><xref rid="fn3590">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jos&#x00E9;<sup><xref rid="fn3591">10</xref></sup> said: It was the universal custom of the kings of Media<sup><xref rid="fn3592">11</xref></sup> when they were eating and drinking to cause their women to come before them stark naked, playing and dancing, in order to see the beauty of their figures. When the wine entered the heart of Ahasuerus, he wished to act in this manner<sup><xref rid="fn3593">12</xref></sup> with Vashti the queen. She was the daughter of a king,<sup><xref rid="fn3594">1</xref></sup> and she was not willing to do this.<sup><xref rid="fn3595">2</xref></sup> He decreed concerning her, and she was slain. When the wine had passed from the heart of Ahasuerus, he sought after Vashti, but he did not find her. They told him of the deed which had been done,<sup><xref rid="fn3596">3</xref></sup> and (also) of the decree which had been ordained concerning her. Why was the decree passed against her? Because she used to make the daughters of Israel come<sup><xref rid="fn3597">4</xref></sup> and toil for her on Sabbaths, therefore was the decree ordained against her that she should be slain naked on the Sabbath,<sup><xref rid="fn3598">5</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;He remembered Vashti,<sup><xref rid="fn3599">6</xref></sup> and <italic>what she had done</italic>, and what was decreed against her&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> ii. 1).</p>
<p>Rabbi Zechariah said: &#x007C;&#x007C; Merit is transmitted by the hand of the worthy. By the hand of Daniel<sup><xref rid="fn3600">7</xref></sup> the sovereignty was transferred to Esther, because he said to the king, Let not the king weep, since all that thou hast done<sup><xref rid="fn3601">8</xref></sup> thou hast done according to the Torah. And whosoever keeps the Torah,<sup><xref rid="fn3602">9</xref></sup> the Holy One, blessed be He, preserves his kingdom; for thus the Torah says that the man shall rule his wife, as it is said, &#x201C;And he shall rule over thee&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3603">10</xref></sup> (Gen. iii. 16). The king sent in all the provinces to do according to his words,<sup><xref rid="fn3604">1</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;That every man should<sup><xref rid="fn3605">2</xref></sup> bear rule in his own house&#x201D; (Esth. i. 22). He also said to the king: &#x201C;Let there be sought for the king<sup><xref rid="fn3605">2</xref></sup> fair young virgins&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> ii. 2). Not<sup><xref rid="fn3606">3</xref></sup> &#x201C;all young virgins,&#x201D; but &#x201C;fair young virgins.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3607">4</xref></sup> &#x201C;And let the maiden which pleaseth<sup><xref rid="fn3605">2</xref></sup> the king be queen instead of Vashti&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 4); and it is written elsewhere, &#x201C;And the maiden pleased him&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 9). This refers to Esther. The Holy One, blessed be He, invested her with grace and love<sup><xref rid="fn3608">5</xref></sup> in the eyes of all who saw her.<sup><xref rid="fn3607">4</xref></sup> &#x201C;And Esther obtained favour<sup><xref rid="fn3605">2</xref></sup> in the sight of all them that looked upon her&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 15 ).<sup><xref rid="fn3609">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>CHAPTER L</title>
<h1><small>HAMAN</small> [70<small>B</small>. ii.]</h1>
<p>&#x201C;T<small>HERE</small> was a certain Jew in Shushan, the capital,<sup><xref rid="fn3611">1</xref></sup> whose name was Mordecai&#x201D; (Esth. ii. 5). Rabbi Shema&#x2019;iah said: Was there then no other Jew in Shushan, the capital, except Mordecai alone? Lo&#x0021; it is written, &#x201C;And the Jews that were in Shushan&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> ix. 15). But because he was a Jew,<sup><xref rid="fn3612">2</xref></sup> and a direct descendant of the patriarchs and also of the royal seed, and he was engaged in (the study of) the Torah all his days, and he was not defiled by any forbidden<sup><xref rid="fn3613">3</xref></sup> food in his mouth, therefore was his name called &#x201C;a Jew.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3614">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;Whose name was Mordecai&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> ii. 5), because his prayer &#x007C;&#x007C; ascended before the Holy One, blessed be He, like the scent of <italic>pure myrrh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3615">5</xref></sup> (&#x05D8;&#x05E8; &#x05DC;&#x05DB;&#x05D9;). &#x201C;The son of Jair&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>), because he enlightened (<italic>Mair</italic>) the faces (of the scholars) in Halakhah.<sup><xref rid="fn3616">6</xref></sup> &#x201C;The son of Shimei&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>), who went forth to curse David.<sup><xref rid="fn3617">7</xref></sup> &#x201C;The son of Kish&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn3618">8</xref></sup> of the seed of those who could use both the right hand and the left,<sup><xref rid="fn3619">1</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows&#x201D; (Ps. lxxviii. 9).</p>
<p>Rabbi Simeon said: Come and see the wisdom of Mordecai, for he knew seventy languages,<sup><xref rid="fn3620">2</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Which came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua<sup><xref rid="fn3621">3</xref></sup>&#x2026; Mordecai, Bilshan&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3622">4</xref></sup> (Ezra ii. 2), and he sat in the gates of the king to see that Esther and her maidens should not become defiled by any kind of unclean<sup><xref rid="fn3623">5</xref></sup> food. He heard the two eunuchs of the king speaking in the language of the Chaldees,<sup><xref rid="fn3624">6</xref></sup> saying:<sup><xref rid="fn3625">7</xref></sup> Now will the king take the afternoon sleep, and when he arises<sup><xref rid="fn3626">8</xref></sup> he will say, Give me a little water; let a deadly poison<sup><xref rid="fn3627">9</xref></sup> be given to him in the golden vessel,<sup><xref rid="fn3628">10</xref></sup> and he will drink thereof and die. Mordecai<sup><xref rid="fn3629">11</xref></sup> went in and told Esther. Now Esther told the king in the name of Mordecai, as it is said, &#x201C;And Esther told the king in Mordecai&#x2019;s name&#x201D; (Esth. ii. 22). Hence (the Wise Men) have said: Whosoever tells a matter in the name of its author brings redemption into the world.<sup><xref rid="fn3630">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>When the king arose from his sleep, he said to his servants, his eunuchs, who were wont to give him something to drink: Give me a little water. They brought him the golden jug, and a deadly poison &#x007C;&#x007C; was therein. He said to them: Pour out the water before me. They said to him: O our lord, O king, this water is excellent, good, even choice. Why should we pour it out before thee? He said to them: Thus have I resolved to have it poured out before me. They poured it out before him, and he found therein the deadly poison,<sup><xref rid="fn3631">1</xref></sup> and he commanded that they should be hanged, as it is said, &#x201C;They were both hanged on a tree&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 23). They were both hanged on one tree, one after the other,<sup><xref rid="fn3632">2</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Upon a tree&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>); it is not written, &#x201C;Upon trees.&#x201D; All affairs which were enacted before the king they wrote before him, and they placed it in the king&#x2019;s box,<sup><xref rid="fn3633">3</xref></sup> and when the king wished to discover what had happened to him they read the documents, and he knew what had happened to him. So they wrote in the book the word which Mordecai had told, as it is said, &#x201C;And it was written in the book of the chronicles&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>Rabbi Phineas said: Two wealthy men arose in the world, one in Israel and one among the nations of the world,<sup><xref rid="fn3634">4</xref></sup> Korah in Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn3635">5</xref></sup> and Haman among the nations of the world,<sup><xref rid="fn3636">6</xref></sup> who took the treasures of the kings of Judah.<sup><xref rid="fn3637">7</xref></sup> (When) the king<sup><xref rid="fn3638">8</xref></sup> saw his wealth and his ten sons<sup><xref rid="fn3639">9</xref></sup> keeping guard before him, he exalted him, and aggrandized him, as it is said, &#x201C;After &#x007C;&#x007C; these things did king Ahasuerus promote<sup><xref rid="fn3640">10</xref></sup> Haman, the son of Hammedatha&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> iii. 1). The king commanded concerning him that all the people should bow down and show reverence to him.<sup><xref rid="fn3641">1</xref></sup> What did Haman do? He made for himself an image of an idol, and had it embroidered upon his dress, above his heart, so that everyone who bowed down to Haman also bowed down to the idol which he had made. Mordecai<sup><xref rid="fn3642">2</xref></sup> saw this, and did not consent to bow down to the idol,<sup><xref rid="fn3643">3</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;But Mordecai bowed not down, nor did him reverence&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 2); and (Haman) was full of wrath against him, and said: These Jews hated my forefathers from of old, and now will I say to the king that he should destroy them from the world. Haman entered before Ahasuerus, and said to him: O my lord, O king, &#x201C;There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples<sup><xref rid="fn3644">4</xref></sup> in all the provinces of thy kingdom&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 8), and they are of no benefit to thee and do not obey thee, and they do not perform thy will, and it is not for the king&#x2019;s profit to suffer them. If it please the king, accept half of my wealth and give me power<sup><xref rid="fn3645">5</xref></sup> over them, as it is said, &#x201C;If it please the king, let it be written that they be destroyed&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 9). (The king) said to him: Behold, they are given into thy hand for nought, as it is said, &#x201C;And the king said to Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 11). The Holy Spirit cried out, saying: &#x201C;Thus saith the Lord, Ye were sold for nought,<sup><xref rid="fn3644">4</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C; and ye shall be redeemed without money&#x201D; (Isa. lii. 3).<sup><xref rid="fn3646">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jos&#x00E9; said: Haman was an astrologer,<sup><xref rid="fn3647">7</xref></sup> and he wrote letters on slips,<sup><xref rid="fn3648">8</xref></sup> and cast lots by the constellations to know the distinction between one day and another, and between one month and another, and between one constellation and another, as it is said, &#x201C;They cast Pur, that is, the lot,<sup><xref rid="fn3649">1</xref></sup> before Haman from day to day, and from month to month&#x201D; (Esth. iii. 7). He wrote and sent throughout all the provinces to destroy and to slay and to exterminate all the Jews<sup><xref rid="fn3650">2</xref></sup> on the thirteenth day of<sup><xref rid="fn3651">3</xref></sup> the month Adar, on the third day in the constellation Leo.<sup><xref rid="fn3652">4</xref></sup> Mordecai heard (thereof), and rent his garments,<sup><xref rid="fn3653">5</xref></sup> and put on sackcloth with ashes, and he went forth into the midst of the city, as it is said, &#x201C;And Mordecai knew all that was done&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> iv. 1); and he cried before the Holy One, blessed be He, saying: Sovereign of all the worlds &#x0021; Thou didst swear to our fore-fathers to multiply their seed like the stars of the heaven, and now hast Thou given them like sheep to the slaughter.<sup><xref rid="fn3654">6</xref></sup> &#x201C;Remember Abraham,<sup><xref rid="fn3655">7</xref></sup> Isaac, and Israel&#x2026; to whom thou swarest&#x2026; I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven&#x201D; (Ex. xxxii. 13). Esther heard (thereof), and her strength failed, as it is said, &#x201C;And the queen was exceedingly enfeebled&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3656">8</xref></sup> (Esth. iv. 4). She sent and called for Hathach, the trusty (servant) of her household, to know what had been done<sup><xref rid="fn3657">9</xref></sup> to Mordecai. Hathach went forth to Mordecai, who told him the words.<sup><xref rid="fn3658">10</xref></sup> (Hathach) went in and told Esther. Haman saw Hathach coming and returning, and he slew him,<sup><xref rid="fn3659">11</xref></sup> and Esther did not find another man faithful enough to send to Mordecai. She said that it was her &#x007C;&#x007C; desire to return answer to Mordecai.<sup><xref rid="fn3660">1</xref></sup> <italic>She</italic> said to him, &#x201C;Go, gather together all the Jews<sup><xref rid="fn3661">2</xref></sup> that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 16). These (days) were the thirteenth, the fourteenth, and the fifteenth of Nisan.<sup><xref rid="fn3662">3</xref></sup> Mordecai said to her: Is not the third day<sup><xref rid="fn3663">4</xref></sup> (of the fast) the day of Passover? She said to him: Thou art the elder in Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn3664">5</xref></sup> If there be no Israel, wherefore is the Passover? Mordecai hearkened to her words, and he<sup><xref rid="fn3665">6</xref></sup> agreed with her. &#x201C;So Mordecai transgressed&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3666">7</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic> 17). What is the meaning of the expression, &#x201C;So he transgressed&#x201D;? That he transgressed the festivals and Sabbaths.<sup><xref rid="fn3667">8</xref></sup> On the third day (of the fast) Esther put on the royal apparel, and sent and invited the king and Haman to the banquet which she had prepared on the fifteenth of Nisan.<sup><xref rid="fn3668">9</xref></sup> When they had eaten and drunk, Haman said:<sup><xref rid="fn3669">10</xref></sup> The king exalts me, and his wife aggrandizes me, and there is none greater than I am in all the kingdoms; and Haman rejoiced very much in his heart, as it is said, &#x201C;Then went Haman forth that day, joyful<sup><xref rid="fn3670">1</xref></sup> and glad of heart&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> v. 9).</p>
<p>&#x201C;On that night the king&#x2019;s sleep fled&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> vi. 1). That night the throne<sup><xref rid="fn3671">2</xref></sup> of the King who is King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, became unsteady,<sup><xref rid="fn3672">3</xref></sup> because He saw that Israel was in great distress. The sleep of the king<sup><xref rid="fn3673">4</xref></sup> on earth fled, for he had seen in his dream Haman taking the sword to slay him;<sup><xref rid="fn3674">5</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C; and he became agitated and arose from his sleep,<sup><xref rid="fn3675">6</xref></sup> and he told the sons of Haman, the scribes,<sup><xref rid="fn3676">7</xref></sup> to read in the books so as to see what had happened to him. They opened the books, and found the incident which Mordecai had told,<sup><xref rid="fn3677">8</xref></sup> but they did not wish to read this, and they rolled up the scrolls. The king said to them: Read ye what is written before you. But they were unwilling to read, and the writing was read (of its own account)<sup><xref rid="fn3678">9</xref></sup> by itself, as it is said, &#x201C;And they were read before the king&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). It is not written here, &#x201C;They were reading,&#x201D; but &#x201C;They were read.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3679">10</xref></sup> The king spake to his servants: Call ye Haman to me. They said to him: Behold, he is standing outside. The king said: The thing is true which I saw in my dream;<sup><xref rid="fn3680">1</xref></sup> he has come only in this hour to slay me. He said: Let him come in. He entered before the king. The king said to him: I wish to exalt and aggrandize a certain man; what shall be done to him? Haman said in his heart, for the seed of Esau<sup><xref rid="fn3681">2</xref></sup> speak in their hearts, but never reveal their secret with their mouths, as it is said, &#x201C;And Haman said in his heart&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 6). Haman said in his heart: He does not desire to exalt any other man except me.<sup><xref rid="fn3682">3</xref></sup> I will speak words so that I shall be a king just as he is. He said to him: Let<sup><xref rid="fn3683">4</xref></sup> them bring the apparel &#x007C;&#x007C; which the king wore on the day of the coronation,<sup><xref rid="fn3684">5</xref></sup> and (let them bring) the horse upon which the king rode on the coronation day, and the crown which was put upon the head of the king on the day of coronation.<sup><xref rid="fn3685">6</xref></sup> The king was exceedingly angry because of the crown. The king said: It does not suffice this villain, but he must even desire the crown which is upon my head.<sup><xref rid="fn3686">7</xref></sup> Haman saw that the king was angry because of the crown; he said: &#x201C;And let the apparel and the horse be delivered<sup><xref rid="fn3687">8</xref></sup> to the hand of one of the king&#x2019;s most noble princes&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 9).<sup><xref rid="fn3688">9</xref></sup> (The king) said to him: Go, and do thus to Mordecai.<sup><xref rid="fn3689">10</xref></sup> As soon as Haman heard this he became greatly agitated,<sup><xref rid="fn3690">11</xref></sup> and he said to him: My lord, O king&#x0021; There are very many named Mordecai. The king answered: &#x201C;The Jew.&#x201D; (Haman) said to him: There are very many Jews.<sup><xref rid="fn3691">1</xref></sup> The king said to him: &#x201C;He who sits at the king&#x2019;s gate&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 10).<sup><xref rid="fn3692">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Haman took the apparel and the horse and went to Mordecai.<sup><xref rid="fn3693">3</xref></sup> (Haman) said to him: Arise, and put on the purple of the king. (Mordecai) said to him:<sup><xref rid="fn3694">4</xref></sup> Villain&#x0021; Dost thou not know that for three days I have put on sack-cloth with ashes,<sup><xref rid="fn3695">5</xref></sup> sitting on the ashes,<sup><xref rid="fn3696">6</xref></sup> because of that which thou hast done to me? Now take me to the bath-house,<sup><xref rid="fn3697">7</xref></sup> and afterwards will I put on the purple of the king. And he washed him and dressed him. (Haman) said to him: Mount and ride upon the horse. He said to (Haman): On account of the affliction of the fast I have no strength to mount and ride upon the horse. What did Haman do? He lowered himself, &#x007C;&#x007C; and Mordecai put his foot upon his neck, and he mounted and rode upon the horse.<sup><xref rid="fn3698">1</xref></sup> Mordecai<sup><xref rid="fn3699">2</xref></sup> said: Blessed be the Omnipresent, who hath not let aught of His words fall to the earth, to fulfil that which is said, &#x201C;But thou shalt tread upon their high places&#x201D; (Deut. xxxiii. 29). Mordecai<sup><xref rid="fn3700">3</xref></sup> betook himself to his seat of honour at the king&#x2019;s gate, whilst Haman was hurried along, and he went<sup><xref rid="fn3701">4</xref></sup> &#x201C;to his house mourning and having his head covered&#x201D; (Esth. vi. 12),<sup><xref rid="fn3702">5</xref></sup> because of that which had happened to him.<sup><xref rid="fn3703">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Zeresh his wife and all his astrologers<sup><xref rid="fn3704">7</xref></sup> said to him: Hast thou not heard what was done unto Pharaoh?<sup><xref rid="fn3705">8</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And Zeresh his wife said unto him, If Mordecai, before whom thou hast begun to fall, be of the seed of the Jews,<sup><xref rid="fn3706">9</xref></sup> thou shalt not prevail against him&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 13).</p>
<p>In that hour the pages of Esther came and took Haman to the banquet which she had prepared on the sixteenth<sup><xref rid="fn3707">1</xref></sup> of Nisan. When they had eaten and taken (wine) the king said to Esther: &#x201C;What is thy petition,<sup><xref rid="fn3708">2</xref></sup> queen Esther? and it shall be granted thee; and what is thy request?&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> vii. 2). She said to him: My lord, O king&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn3709">3</xref></sup> I ask nought of thee, except my life, and my people. Because one man has come and has bought us to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish.<sup><xref rid="fn3710">4</xref></sup> &#x201C;But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my peace&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 4). The king said to her:<sup><xref rid="fn3711">5</xref></sup> Who is this man? She answered him: This one is the wicked Haman,<sup><xref rid="fn3712">6</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And Esther said, An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 6). &#x201C;The king arose in his wrath&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 7).<sup><xref rid="fn3713">7</xref></sup> What did the angel Michael<sup><xref rid="fn3714">8</xref></sup> do? He began to cut down the plants in his presence.<sup><xref rid="fn3715">9</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C; Intense wrath was kindled within him, and the king returned from the palace garden to the place of the banquet of wine. What did the angel Michael do? He lifted up Haman<sup><xref rid="fn3716">10</xref></sup> from Esther. The king exclaimed:<sup><xref rid="fn3717">1</xref></sup> As for this villain, he is not satisfied with having purchased the people of Esther to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish, but he must needs come upon her&#x0021; &#x201C;Will he even force the queen before me in the house?&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 8).<sup><xref rid="fn3718">2</xref></sup> Haman heard this word and his countenance fell, as it is said, &#x201C;They covered Haman&#x2019;s face&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn3719">3</xref></sup> And the king commanded that he should be hanged on the gallows.<sup><xref rid="fn3720">4</xref></sup> What<sup><xref rid="fn3721">5</xref></sup> did Elijah, his memory be a blessing, do? He assumed the guise of Harbonah,<sup><xref rid="fn3722">6</xref></sup> one of the chamberlains of the king. He said to him: My lord, O king&#x0021; There is a tree<sup><xref rid="fn3723">7</xref></sup> in Haman&#x2019;s house (taken) from the Holy of Holies,<sup><xref rid="fn3724">8</xref></sup> fifty cubits high. Whence do we know that it was from the Holy of Holies? Because it is said, &#x201C;And he built the house of the forest of Lebanon&#x201D; (1 Kings vii. 2).<sup><xref rid="fn3725">9</xref></sup> Forthwith the king commanded that he should be hanged thereon, as it is said, &#x201C;And (the king<sup><xref rid="fn3726">10</xref></sup>) said, Hang him thereon&#x201D; (Esth. vii. 9), so as to fulfil that which is said, &#x201C;Let a beam be pulled out from his house,<sup><xref rid="fn3727">11</xref></sup> and let him be lifted up and fastened thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this&#x201D; (Ezra vi. 11). And it says, &#x201C;So they hanged Haman<sup><xref rid="fn3728">12</xref></sup> on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai&#x201D; (Esth. vii. 10). The king took all that belonged to Haman<sup><xref rid="fn3729">13</xref></sup> and gave it to Mordecai and to Esther.<sup><xref rid="fn3730">14</xref></sup> He<sup><xref rid="fn3731">15</xref></sup> said to them: Write concerning the Jews as seems good in your eyes<sup><xref rid="fn3732">1</xref></sup> in the name of the king. They wrote official letters, and they sent throughout all the provinces<sup><xref rid="fn3733">2</xref></sup> to destroy, to slay, &#x007C;&#x007C; and to cause all the enemies of the Jews to perish on the thirteenth of the month of Adar, on the third day in the constellation of Leo.<sup><xref rid="fn3734">3</xref></sup> Just as the lion<sup><xref rid="fn3735">4</xref></sup> is the king<sup><xref rid="fn3736">5</xref></sup> over all the beasts, and he turns his gaze towards any place as he wishes; likewise did he<sup><xref rid="fn3737">6</xref></sup> think fit, and he turned his face to destroy and to slay all the enemies of Israel, as it is said, &#x201C;In the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have rule over them&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> ix. 1).<sup><xref rid="fn3738">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer said: Haman had forty sons;<sup><xref rid="fn3739">8</xref></sup> ten of them were the scribes of the books of the king, and thirty were ruling in all the provinces, as it is said, &#x201C;And the ten sons of Haman, in the rest of the king&#x2019;s provinces&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 12). They were all hanged upon the gallows of their father, as it is said, &#x201C;And they hanged Haman&#x2019;s ten sons&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 14) upon the gallows. Another Scripture text says, &#x201C;And they hanged Haman&#x2019;s ten sons&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn3740">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Phineas said: Mordecai ruled<sup><xref rid="fn3741">10</xref></sup> over the Jews. Just as the king is dressed in purple, so was Mordecai dressed in purple, as it is said, &#x201C;And Mordecai went forth from the presence of the king<sup><xref rid="fn3742">11</xref></sup> in royal apparel&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> viii. 15).<sup><xref rid="fn3743">12</xref></sup> Just as the king has a crown upon his head, so Mordecai had a crown upon his head, as it is said, &#x201C;And Mordecai went forth<sup><xref rid="fn3744">13</xref></sup>&#x2026; with a great crown of gold&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). Just as the king&#x2019;s fear obtains in all the land, so was the fear of Mordecai upon them, as it is said, &#x201C;Because the fear of Mordecai was fallen upon them&#x2026;&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> ix. 3).<sup><xref rid="fn3745">1</xref></sup> Just as the king&#x2019;s money is current throughout the land, &#x007C;&#x007C; so was Mordecai&#x2019;s money current in all the land, as it is said, &#x201C;For Mordecai was great&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 4).<sup><xref rid="fn3746">2</xref></sup> What was the money of Mordecai? On the one side was (the face of) Mordecai and on the other (the face of) Esther. Wherefore?

<ftnote id="fn3678"><sup>9</sup> By a miracle. The Targum 11., <italic>loc. cit.,</italic> says: &#x201C;When Shimsh&#x00EA; the scribe saw what was told concerning Mordecai in the affair of Bigthan and Teresh, he turned over the leaves and did not want to read them.

<ftnote id="fn3681"><sup>2</sup> The first editions read: &#x201C;All the seed of Amalek.&#x201D; See T.B. Megillah, 7a, which infers that the Book of Esther was inspired, as otherwise we could not know what Haman thought in his heart.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3682"><sup>3</sup> The first editions read: &#x201C;To whom should the king desire to do honour more than to me.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3683"><sup>4</sup> The first editions omit the previous sentence and read here: &#x201C;My lord, O king&#x0021; if thou desirest to do honour to the man in whom thou takest delight.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3684"><sup>5</sup> See Targum 11. on Esth. vi. 7 for the dream and its fulfilment by Haman&#x2019;s words. Targum 1. on Esth. vi. 8 adds: &#x201C;on the day of his accession to the throne.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3685"><sup>6</sup> This is probably due to the text: &#x201C;And the royal crown which is set upon his head&#x201D; (Esth. vi. 8).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn3691"><sup>1</sup> The first editions add: &#x201C;who are named Mordecai.&#x201D;</ftnote>

As for this man, give him fields and vineyards and it will suffice for him; as for these other (honours), how will they benefit him? The king said to him: Go, do as thou hast spoken. I also am able to give him all that which thou hast decreed with thy mouth.<sup><xref rid="fn3750">1</xref></sup> The king said to him: By the life of my head and my kingdom&#x0021; It is becoming for thee to do thus.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3751">2</xref></sup></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn3695"><sup>5</sup> See Esth. iv. 1. Targum 11. on Esth. vi. 11 reads: (Haman says): &#x201C;Now arise from your sackcloth and ashes, and put on the royal garment.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3696"><sup>6</sup> See Esth. iv. 3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3697"><sup>7</sup> The first editions add here: &#x201C;What did Esther do? She ordained that any person who should stand (about) in the baths (the same) should not live. And if (Haman) should tell anyone to kindle lights, they should not hearken unto him. Haman went and (by) himself kindled the lights against his will. He sent his eldest son to call Mordecai into the baths. Mordecai received (him) and struck him with his foot, saying to him: Why did not thy father come himself? Is he not my servant? He returned to his father and told him, and he went against his will to take (Mordecai) to the baths, and he shaved his head and divested him (of his garments) and dressed him.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3698"><sup>1</sup> The first editions add here: &#x201C;And as he lifted up one leg, he struck him with the other foot. (Haman) said to him: Is it not written in the Torah (<italic>i.e.</italic> Bible): &#x2018;Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth&#x2019; (Prov. xxiv. 17)? (Mordecai) said to him: These words apply to Israel, but concerning the nations of the world (the text says): &#x2018;But thou shalt tread upon their high places&#x2019;&#x201D; (Deut. xxxiii. 29). The Amsterdam and Prague editions read &#x201C;idolaters&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;nations of the world&#x201D; just before the quotation from Deuteronomy. This long section is undoubtedly a later expansion of the simple original narrative which we have probably preserved in our MS. and in the Targum 11. The Venice text contains several Aramaic words which are quite alien to the language of the <italic>P.R.E.</italic></ftnote>

<h1><small>THE NEW HEAVENS AND EARTH</small> [73<small>B</small>. i.]</h1>
<p>R<small>ABBAN</small> G<small>AMALIEL</small> said: Just as the New Moons are renewed<sup><xref rid="fn3753">1</xref></sup> and sanctified in this world, so will Israel<sup><xref rid="fn3754">2</xref></sup> be sanctified<sup><xref rid="fn3755">3</xref></sup> and renewed in the future world just like the New Moons, as it is said, &#x201C;Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy:<sup><xref rid="fn3756">4</xref></sup> for I the Lord your God am holy&#x201D; (Lev. xix. 2). The sages say: The heavens and the earth are destined to pass away and to be renewed. What is written concerning them?	&#x201C;And all the host of the heaven shall be dissolved,<sup><xref rid="fn3757">5</xref></sup> and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll&#x201D; (Isa. xxxiv. 4). Just as when a man reads in a scroll of the Torah and he rolls it,<sup><xref rid="fn3758">6</xref></sup> and again he opens it to read therein and he rolls it (together), likewise in the future will the Holy One, blessed be He, roll together the heavens like a scroll, as it is said, &#x201C;And the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3759">1</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic>); &#x201C;And the earth shall wax old like a garment&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> li. 6); just as a man spreads out his garment and folds it<sup><xref rid="fn3760">2</xref></sup> up, and again he unfolds it &#x007C;&#x007C; and puts it on and renews it (thereby), likewise the Holy One, blessed be He, in the future will fold up the earth and again will He spread it out and put it in its place like a garment, as it is said. &#x201C;And the earth shall wax old like a garment&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>All its inhabitants shall taste the taste of death<sup><xref rid="fn3761">3</xref></sup> for two days, when there will be no soul of man or beast upon the earth, as it is said, &#x201C;And they that dwell therein shall die in like manner&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). On the third day He will renew them all and revive the dead, and He will establish it<sup><xref rid="fn3762">4</xref></sup> before Him, as it is said, &#x201C;On the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live before him&#x201D; (Hos. vi. 2).</p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer said: All the host of heaven in the future will pass away and will be renewed. What is written concerning them? &#x201C;And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3763">5</xref></sup> (Isa. xxxiv. 4). Just as the leaves fade<sup><xref rid="fn3764">6</xref></sup> from off the vine and the fig tree, and the latter remain standing as a dry tree, and again they blossom afresh and bear buds and produce new leaves and fresh leaves. Likewise<sup><xref rid="fn3765">7</xref></sup> in the future will all the host of heaven fade away like a vine and a fig tree, and they will again be renewed before Him to make known that there is passing away (which) does not (really) pass away. No more shall there be evil, and no more shall there be plague,<sup><xref rid="fn3766">1</xref></sup> and (there shall) not be the former misfortunes, as it is said, &#x201C;For, behold, I create new heavens&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> lxv. 17).</p>
<p>Rabbi Jannai said: &#x007C;&#x007C; All the hosts of heaven pass away and are renewed every day.<sup><xref rid="fn3767">2</xref></sup> What are the hosts of heaven? The sun, the moon, the stars, and the constellations.<sup><xref rid="fn3768">3</xref></sup> Know that it is so. Come and see, for when the sun turns in order to set in the west, it bathes in the waters of the Ocean<sup><xref rid="fn3769">4</xref></sup> and extinguishes the flames of the sun, and no light is left, and it has no flame all night long until it comes to the east. When it arrives at the east it washes itself in the river of fire,<sup><xref rid="fn3770">5</xref></sup> like a man who kindles his lamp in the midst of the fire. Likewise the sun kindles its lamps and puts on its flames and ascends to give light upon the earth, and it renews every day the work of the Creation.<sup><xref rid="fn3771">6</xref></sup> And thus (it is) until even comes.<sup><xref rid="fn3772">7</xref></sup> At evening-time the moon and the stars and the constellations wash themselves in the river of hail,<sup><xref rid="fn3773">8</xref></sup> and they ascend to give light upon the earth. In the future that is to come, the Holy One, blessed be He, will renew them and add to their light a sevenfold light,<sup><xref rid="fn3774">9</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Moreover, the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun<sup><xref rid="fn3775">10</xref></sup> shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxx. 26). &#x201C;In the day&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn3776">11</xref></sup> Like which day? In the day of the redemption of Israel, as it is said, &#x201C;In the day that the Lord bindeth up the hurt of his people&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>Rabban Gamaliel said: The Sabbath burnt offering which they brought &#x007C;&#x007C; every Sabbath (consisted of) two he-lambs, and the burnt offering for the New Moon which they brought every New Moon consisted of two young bullocks. Two for each occasion,<sup><xref rid="fn3777">1</xref></sup> corresponding to what? Corresponding to the two worlds, this world and the world to come. &#x201C;One ram and one he-goat&#x201D;:<sup><xref rid="fn3778">2</xref></sup> just as they<sup><xref rid="fn3779">3</xref></sup> are a single nation, their God is (likewise) <italic>one.</italic> &#x201C;<italic>Seven</italic> he-lambs of the first year without blemish&#x201D; (Num. xxviii. 11), corresponding to those who bring their offerings,<sup><xref rid="fn3780">4</xref></sup> to Him who renews them<sup><xref rid="fn3781">5</xref></sup> like the New Moons, as it is said, &#x201C;This is the burnt offering of every month<sup><xref rid="fn3782">6</xref></sup> throughout the months of the year&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 14).</p>
<p>Rabbi Zechariah said: After<sup><xref rid="fn3783">7</xref></sup> (the words) &#x201C;the burnt offering of every month<sup><xref rid="fn3784">8</xref></sup> throughout the months of the year&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>), what is written? &#x201C;And one<sup><xref rid="fn3785">9</xref></sup> he-goat for a sin offering unto the Lord&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 15). For what purpose was the sin offering? When the Holy One, blessed be He, created His world, He created two great luminaries,<sup><xref rid="fn3786">10</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And God made the two great lights&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3787">11</xref></sup> (Gen. i. 16). The one He made larger and the other smaller, and the moon obstinately refused<sup><xref rid="fn3788">12</xref></sup> to do the will of its Creator so as to be made smaller; therefore Israel offered on its behalf the he-goat for a sin offering heavenwards as one of the burnt offerings of the New Moon, as it is said, &#x201C;And one<sup><xref rid="fn3789">1</xref></sup> he-goat for a sin offering unto the Lord&#x201D; (Num. xxviii. 15). What is the meaning of &#x201C;unto the Lord&#x201D;? The Holy One, blessed be He, said: This he-goat shall be an atonement for Me,<sup><xref rid="fn3790">2</xref></sup> because I have diminished the (size of the) moon.<sup><xref rid="fn3791">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer said: In the future the Temple will be raised up and renewed, as it is said, &#x201C;Behold, I will do a new thing; now shall it spring forth;<sup><xref rid="fn3792">4</xref></sup> shall ye not know it?&#x201D; (Isa. xliii. 19). &#x007C;&#x007C; And its gates<sup><xref rid="fn3793">5</xref></sup> which are buried in the earth will be renewed in the future and arise every one in its place, and the gate of the inner court which turned to the east.<sup><xref rid="fn3794">6</xref></sup> On the six days of work its doors shall be closed, and on the Sabbath day they are opened by themselves, as it is said, &#x201C;Thus saith the Lord God: The gate of the inner court<sup><xref rid="fn3795">7</xref></sup> that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the Sabbath day it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened&#x201D; (Ezek. xlvi. 1).<sup><xref rid="fn3796">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jehudah said: On Sabbath and New Moons Israel stood there,<sup><xref rid="fn3797">9</xref></sup> (and they perceived) that the Sabbath day had come, and they sanctified the Sabbath day;<sup><xref rid="fn3798">10</xref></sup> and so also on the New Moons the Israelites were standing there and saw the doors opening by themselves,<sup><xref rid="fn3799">1</xref></sup> and they knew that in that hour it was New Moon, and they sanctified the New Moon,<sup><xref rid="fn3800">2</xref></sup> and afterwards (this was done) among the heavenly ones. Therefore Israel sanctifies the New Moons first in the lower regions (on earth) and afterwards (it is sanctified) in the heavenly regions, because they<sup><xref rid="fn3801">3</xref></sup> have defined the beginning of the Molad of the Moon in the presence of Israel, who saw the doors open by themselves, and they knew that the Shekhinah of the Holy One, blessed be He (was therein<sup><xref rid="fn3802">4</xref></sup>), as it is said, &#x201C;For the Lord, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3803">5</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic> xliv. 2). Forthwith they<sup><xref rid="fn3804">6</xref></sup> fall down and prostrate themselves before their God. So it was in the past and so will it be in the future that is to come, as it is said, &#x201C;And the people of the &#x007C;&#x007C; land shall worship<sup><xref rid="fn3805">7</xref></sup> at the door of that gate before the Lord in the Sabbaths and in the New Moons&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xlvi. 3).<sup><xref rid="fn3806">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi<sup><xref rid="fn3807">9</xref></sup> said: Is it not written, &#x201C;There is no <italic>new</italic> thing under the sun&#x201D; (Eccles. i. 9)? The (sages) said to him:<sup><xref rid="fn3808">1</xref></sup> The righteous and all their works will be <italic>renewed</italic>, but the wicked will not be renewed and &#x201C;no new thing&#x201D; shall be given to them, (even) to all who worship and trust <italic>under</italic> the sun, therefore it is said, &#x201C;There is no new thing under the sun&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>Rabbi Phineas said: In the future the waters of the well will ascend from under the threshold of the Temple, and they will overflow and bubble<sup><xref rid="fn3809">2</xref></sup> over and issue forth and become twelve streams corresponding to the twelve tribes, as it is said, &#x201C;And he brought me back unto the door of the house; and<sup><xref rid="fn3810">3</xref></sup> behold, waters issued out<sup><xref rid="fn3811">4</xref></sup> from under the threshold of the house eastward, for the forefront of the house was toward the east: and the waters came down from under, from the right side of the house, on the south of the altar&#x201D; (Ezek. xlvii. 1). Three (streams) towards the south to pass through them up to the ankles, and three (streams) towards the west to pass through them up to the knees, as it is said, &#x201C;When the man<sup><xref rid="fn3812">5</xref></sup> went forth eastward with the line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the ankles. Again he measured a thousand, and<sup><xref rid="fn3813">6</xref></sup> he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the knees&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 3, 4).<sup><xref rid="fn3814">7</xref></sup> And three (streams) towards the east to pass through them up to the neck, for the neck is the extremity of the body, as it is said, &#x201C;And he measured a thousand cubits, and<sup><xref rid="fn3815">1</xref></sup> he caused me to pass through the waters that were to the extremity&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3816">2</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic> 3). And (the waters) descended to the brook of Kidron, and they rose higher than in &#x201C;the stream,<sup><xref rid="fn3817">3</xref></sup> that I could not pass through&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 5), as it is said, &#x201C;For the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a stream that could not be passed through&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3818">4</xref></sup> (<italic>ibid.</italic>). And the waters are drawn (thence), and they flow down to the fords of the Jordan,<sup><xref rid="fn3819">5</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And they shall go down into &#x007C;&#x007C; the Arabah&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 8).</p>
<p>Every field and vineyard which did not yield fruit, people water<sup><xref rid="fn3820">6</xref></sup> them with those waters and they yield fruit, as it is said, &#x201C;And it shall come to pass, that every living creature which swarmeth, in every place whither the rivers come, shall live<sup><xref rid="fn3821">7</xref></sup>&#x2026; for these waters are come thither, that all things may be healed and live&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 9). Then (the waters) enter the Salt Sea and they heal it.<sup><xref rid="fn3822">8</xref></sup> And<sup><xref rid="fn3823">9</xref></sup> the waters &#x201C;shall go towards the sea,&#x2026; and the waters shall be <italic>healed</italic>&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 8). And there they generate all kinds (of fish). The Scripture text (here) gives a general rule concerning the fish, that they will be as sweet as Manna.<sup><xref rid="fn3824">1</xref></sup> They ascend in the stream as far as Jerusalem, and there they are caught in its nets,<sup><xref rid="fn3825">2</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And it shall come to pass that<sup><xref rid="fn3826">3</xref></sup> fishers shall stand by it&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 10). It is written, &#x201C;They shall stand by it.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3827">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>There upon the bank of the stream grow all kinds of trees bearing according to their kind.<sup><xref rid="fn3828">5</xref></sup> By the river they shall stand, &#x201C;upon the banks thereof on this side and on that side&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 12). Every month they bring forth new fruit, as it is said, &#x201C;It shall bring forth new fruit every month&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn3829">6</xref></sup> Some of them are for food and others are growing, as it is said, &#x201C;Because<sup><xref rid="fn3830">7</xref></sup> the waters thereof issue out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for healing&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>Every man who is ill and bathes in those waters, will be healed, as it is said, &#x201C;In every place whither the rivers come, he shall live<sup><xref rid="fn3831">8</xref></sup>&#x2026; and every thing shall live whithersoever the river cometh&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 9). Every man who has a wound will be healed by taking of their leaves<sup><xref rid="fn3832">9</xref></sup> and applying them to his wound, as it is said, &#x201C;And the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for healing&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 12). What is the meaning of &#x201C;for healing&#x201D;? Rabbi Jochanan said: For a laxative; &#x007C;&#x007C; suck its leaves and one&#x2019;s food is digested.<sup><xref rid="fn3833">1</xref></sup></p>

<h1><small>THE SEVEN WONDERS OF OLD</small> [75<small>A</small>. ii.]</h1>
<p>S<small>EVEN</small> wonderful things have been done<sup><xref rid="fn3837">1</xref></sup> in the world, the like of which have not been created.<sup><xref rid="fn3838">2</xref></sup> From the day when the heavens and the earth were created no man was ever saved from the fire<sup><xref rid="fn3839">3</xref></sup> until our father Abraham<sup><xref rid="fn3840">4</xref></sup> came and was delivered from the fiery furnace. All the kings of the earth heard (thereof) and they were astonished, for they had not seen anyone like him from the day when the world was created. And whence do we know that he was delivered from the fiery furnace? Because it is said, &#x201C;And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of the <italic>furnace</italic> of the Chaldees&#x201D; (Gen. xv. 7).<sup><xref rid="fn3841">5</xref></sup> Another text says, &#x201C;Thou art the Lord the God, who didst choose<sup><xref rid="fn3842">6</xref></sup> Abram, and broughtest him forth out of the furnace of the Chaldees&#x201D; (Neh. ix. 7).</p>
<p>The second wonder (was) about the wives of the sons of Noah.<sup><xref rid="fn3843">7</xref></sup> From the day when the heavens and the earth were created there never was a woman who at ninety years of age had a child, until<sup><xref rid="fn3844">8</xref></sup> Sarah came and bare (a son) when (she was) ninety years old.<sup><xref rid="fn3845">9</xref></sup> All the kings of the earth heard (thereof), and they did not believe.<sup><xref rid="fn3846">1</xref></sup> What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do to them? He dried up<sup><xref rid="fn3847">2</xref></sup> the breasts of their wives,<sup><xref rid="fn3848">3</xref></sup> as it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn3849">4</xref></sup> &#x201C;And all the trees<sup><xref rid="fn3850">5</xref></sup> of the field shall know<sup><xref rid="fn3851">6</xref></sup> that I the Lord have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish&#x201D; (Ezek. xvii. 24).</p>
<p>&#x201C;All<sup><xref rid="fn3852">7</xref></sup> the trees of the field shall know&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>); this (expression) refers to the nations of the world.<sup><xref rid="fn3853">8</xref></sup> &#x201C;That I the Lord have brought down the high tree&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>) (this refers to Nimrod<sup><xref rid="fn3854">9</xref></sup>). &#x201C;I have exalted the low tree&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>); this is Abraham our father. &#x201C;I have dried up the green tree,&#x201D; refers to the breasts of the wives of the nations of the world.<sup><xref rid="fn3853">8</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C; &#x201C;I have made the dry tree to flourish&#x201D;; this refers to the breasts of Sarah, for they brought their children to be suckled by Sarah&#x2019;s breasts, for Sarah gave suck to all their children in peace, as it is said, &#x201C;And she said, Who would have said<sup><xref rid="fn3855">10</xref></sup> unto Abraham, that Sarah should give children suck?&#x201D; (Gen. xxi. 7).</p>
<p>The third wonder (was): From the day when the heavens and the earth were created there never was a man upon whom grey hairs were sprinkled<sup><xref rid="fn3856">11</xref></sup> until Abraham came.<sup><xref rid="fn3857">1</xref></sup> The people were astonished because they had not seen any one like him from the day when the world was created. Whence do we know that grey hairs were sprinkled upon him? Because it is said, &#x201C;And Abraham was old, well <italic>stricken in age</italic>&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxiv. 1).<sup><xref rid="fn3858">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Levitas, a man of Jamnia, said:<sup><xref rid="fn3859">3</xref></sup> Like a diadem which belongs to the head of the king, so are grey hairs beauty and glory to old men, as it is said, &#x201C;The glory of young men is their strength,<sup><xref rid="fn3860">4</xref></sup> and the beauty of old men is the hoary head&#x201D; (Prov. xx. 29).<sup><xref rid="fn3861">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The fourth wonder (was): From the day when the heavens and the earth were created no man was ill, (who) sneezed and lived, but in every place where he happened to be, whether on the way or in the market,<sup><xref rid="fn3862">6</xref></sup> and (when he) sneezed, his soul went out through his nostrils; until our father Jacob came and prayed<sup><xref rid="fn3863">7</xref></sup> for mercy concerning this, and he said before the Holy One, blessed be He: Sovereign of all the worlds&#x0021; Do not take my soul from me until I have charged<sup><xref rid="fn3864">8</xref></sup> my sons and my household;<sup><xref rid="fn3865">9</xref></sup> and He was entreated of him, as it is said, &#x201C;And it came to pass after these things, that one said to Joseph,<sup><xref rid="fn3866">10</xref></sup> Behold, thy father is sick&#x201D; (Gen. xlviii. 1). &#x007C;&#x007C; All the kings of the earth heard (thereof), and they wondered because there had been no one like him from the days when the heavens and earth had been created. Therefore a man is in duty bound to say to his fellow: Life&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn3867">1</xref></sup> when the latter sneezes,<sup><xref rid="fn3868">2</xref></sup> for the death of the world was changed into light, as it is said, &#x201C;His neesings flash forth light&#x201D; (Job xli. 18).</p>
<p>The fifth wonder (was): From the day when the heavens and the earth were created, the waters of the sea had not been changed into dry land until Israel went forth from Egypt and passed over on dry land in the midst of the sea, as it is said, &#x201C;But the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea&#x201D; (Ex. xv. 19).<sup><xref rid="fn3869">3</xref></sup> All the kings of the earth heard (thereof) and trembled, because there had been nothing like it from the day when the world had been created, as it is said, &#x201C;The people heard, they trembled&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 14).<sup><xref rid="fn3870">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The sixth wonder (was): From the day when the heavens and earth were created, the sun,<sup><xref rid="fn3871">5</xref></sup> the moon, and the stars and the constellations were ascending to give light upon the earth, and they did not come into contact<sup><xref rid="fn3872">6</xref></sup> with one another until Joshua came and fought the battles of Israel. It was the eve of the Sabbath,<sup><xref rid="fn3873">7</xref></sup> and he<sup><xref rid="fn3874">8</xref></sup> saw the plight of Israel lest they might desecrate the Sabbath, and further, he saw the magicians of Egypt<sup><xref rid="fn3875">9</xref></sup> compelling<sup><xref rid="fn3876">10</xref></sup> the constellations to come<sup><xref rid="fn3877">11</xref></sup> against Israel. What did he<sup><xref rid="fn3874">8</xref></sup> do? He stretched forth his hand to the light of the sun and to the light of the moon,<sup><xref rid="fn3878">1</xref></sup> and he invoked upon them the &#x007C;&#x007C; (Divine) Name, and each one stood for thirty-six hours in its place until the termination of the Sabbath day,<sup><xref rid="fn3879">2</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed&#x201D; (Josh. x. 13).<sup><xref rid="fn3880">3</xref></sup> All the kings of the earth<sup><xref rid="fn3881">4</xref></sup> heard thereof and they wondered, because there had been none like him from the day when the world had been created, as it is said, &#x201C;And there was no day like that<sup><xref rid="fn3882">5</xref></sup> before it or after it, that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 14).</p>
<p>The seventh wonder (was): From the day when the heavens and earth had been created there had never been a sick man who had recovered from his sickness,<sup><xref rid="fn3883">6</xref></sup> until Hezekiah, king of Judah, came and fell sick and (yet) he recovered, as it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn3884">7</xref></sup> &#x201C;The writing of Hezekiah, king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness&#x201D; (Isa. xxxviii. 9). He began to pray before the Holy One, blessed be He, saying: Sovereign of all worlds&#x0021;	&#x201C;Now, O Lord, remember, I beseech thee, how I walked before thee in truth<sup><xref rid="fn3885">8</xref></sup> and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight&#x201D; (2 Kings xx. 3); and He was entreated of him, as it is said, &#x201C;Behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years&#x201D; (Isa. xxxviii. <italic>5)</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3886">9</xref></sup> Hezekiah said before the Holy One, blessed be He: Sovereign of all worlds &#x0021; Give me a sign, as it is said, &#x201C;And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign<sup><xref rid="fn3887">10</xref></sup> that the Lord will heal me, and that I shall go up unto the house of the Lord?&#x201D; (2 Kings xx. 8). He answered him: Ahaz thy father compelled<sup><xref rid="fn3888">1</xref></sup> the constellations, and he bowed down<sup><xref rid="fn3889">2</xref></sup> to the sun,<sup><xref rid="fn3890">3</xref></sup> and the sun fled before him<sup><xref rid="fn3891">4</xref></sup> and went down in the west ten steps.<sup><xref rid="fn3892">5</xref></sup> If thou desirest, it shall go down ten steps, or it shall ascend ten steps.<sup><xref rid="fn3893">6</xref></sup> Hezekiah spake before the Holy One, blessed be He: Sovereign of all worlds &#x0021; Nay, &#x007C;&#x007C; but those ten steps which it has (already) gone down let it retrace and stand,<sup><xref rid="fn3894">7</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Nay, but let the shadow return<sup><xref rid="fn3895">8</xref></sup> backward ten steps&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 10). And He was entreated of him, as it is said, &#x201C;Behold, I will cause the shadow on the steps,<sup><xref rid="fn3896">9</xref></sup> which is gone down on the dial of Ahaz with the sun, to return backward ten steps&#x201D; (Isa. xxxviii. 8). All the kings<sup><xref rid="fn3897">10</xref></sup> of the earth saw, and they were astonished, for there had been nothing like it from the day when the world was created, and they<sup><xref rid="fn3898">11</xref></sup> sent to behold the wonder,<sup><xref rid="fn3899">12</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Howbeit<sup><xref rid="fn3900">13</xref></sup> in (the business of) the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon<sup><xref rid="fn3901">14</xref></sup> who sent unto him to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land&#x201D; (2 Chron. xxxii. 31).</p>
<p>And Hezekiah saw the messengers,<sup><xref rid="fn3902">1</xref></sup> and his heart was puffed with pride,<sup><xref rid="fn3903">2</xref></sup> and he showed them all the treasures of the kings of Judah, and all the treasures of the Holy of Holies in the Temple,<sup><xref rid="fn3904">3</xref></sup> and further, he opened the Ark of the Covenant, and he showed them the tables of the Law,<sup><xref rid="fn3905">4</xref></sup> and he said to them: With this do we wage war<sup><xref rid="fn3906">5</xref></sup> and conquer, as it is said, &#x201C;And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them<sup><xref rid="fn3907">6</xref></sup> the house of his precious things&#x201D; (Isa. xxxix. 2). The Holy One, blessed be He, was angry with him, and He said to him: Was it not enough for thee to have shown them all the treasures of the kings of Judah and all the treasures of the Holy of Holies? Moreover, thou hast opened for them the Ark, and hast shown them the tables, the work of My hand. By thy life&#x0021; They shall come up and take away all the treasures of the kings of Judah, and all the treasures of the Holy of &#x007C;&#x007C; Holies, as it is said, &#x201C;Behold, the days come,<sup><xref rid="fn3908">7</xref></sup> that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 6). Instead of the tables of the Law, they shall take of thy sons to be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon, as it is said, &#x201C;And of thy sons that shall issue from thee,<sup><xref rid="fn3909">8</xref></sup> which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 7). These were<sup><xref rid="fn3910">1</xref></sup> Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, who were made eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon, and they did not beget children. Concerning them the Scripture says, &#x201C;For thus saith the Lord to the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths,<sup><xref rid="fn3911">2</xref></sup>&#x2026; Unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a memorial<sup><xref rid="fn3912">3</xref></sup> and a name<sup><xref rid="fn3913">4</xref></sup> better than of sons and of daughters; I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> lvi. 4, 5).</p>

<h1><small>THE SIN OF SLANDER</small> [76<small>B</small>. i.]</h1>
<p>E<small>VERYONE</small><sup><xref rid="fn3914">1</xref></sup> who secretly slanders<sup><xref rid="fn3915">2</xref></sup> his fellows has no remedy,<sup><xref rid="fn3916">3</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour,<sup><xref rid="fn3917">4</xref></sup> him will I destroy: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will I not suffer&#x201D; (Ps. ci. 5). Another Scripture text says, &#x201C;Cursed be he that smiteth his neighbour in secret&#x201D; (Deut. xxvii. 24).<sup><xref rid="fn3918">5</xref></sup> Know that it is so. Come and see from the (narrative of) the serpent which uttered slander concerning the Holy One, blessed be He, to Adam and his helpmate.<sup><xref rid="fn3919">6</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, cursed it, so that its food became the dust, as it is said, &#x201C;And dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life&#x201D; (Gen. iii. 14).</p>
<p>Rabban Gamaliel said: Israel also slandered<sup><xref rid="fn3920">7</xref></sup> the Holy One, blessed be He, (by) saying: Wilt thou say that He has power<sup><xref rid="fn3921">8</xref></sup> to feed us in the wilderness? as it is said, &#x201C;Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness? Behold, he smote the rock,<sup><xref rid="fn3922">9</xref></sup> that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed&#x201D; (Ps. lxxviii. 19, 20). The Holy One, blessed be He, heard<sup><xref rid="fn3923">1</xref></sup> that they slandered His Glory, &#x007C;&#x007C; and from His Glory,<sup><xref rid="fn3924">2</xref></sup> which is a consuming fire, He sent against them a fire which consumed them round about, as it is said, &#x201C;And the people were as murmurers<sup><xref rid="fn3925">3</xref></sup>&#x2026; and the fire of the Lord burnt among them, and devoured in the uttermost part of the camp&#x201D; (Num. xi. 1). The Israelites betook themselves to our teacher Moses, and they said to him: Moses, our lord&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn3926">4</xref></sup> Let these be given like sheep to the slaughter,<sup><xref rid="fn3927">5</xref></sup> but not to the fire which is consuming fire. Moses saw the plight of Israel, and he arose to pray on their behalf,<sup><xref rid="fn3928">6</xref></sup> and He was entreated of him, as it is said, &#x201C;And the people cried unto Moses&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 2).<sup><xref rid="fn3929">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Judah<sup><xref rid="fn3930">8</xref></sup> said: That fire which descended from heaven settled on the earth, and did not again return to its (former) place in heaven,<sup><xref rid="fn3931">9</xref></sup> but it entered the Tabernacle. That fire came forth and devoured all the offerings which they<sup><xref rid="fn3932">10</xref></sup> brought in the wilderness,<sup><xref rid="fn3933">11</xref></sup> as it is said.<sup><xref rid="fn3934">12</xref></sup> &#x201C;And there descended fire from heaven&#x201D; is not written here, but &#x201C;And there came forth fire from before the Lord&#x201D; (Lev. ix. 24).<sup><xref rid="fn3935">13</xref></sup> This was the fire which came forth and consumed the sons of Aaron,<sup><xref rid="fn3936">1</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And there came forth fire from before the Lord&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>). That fire came forth and consumed the company of Korah, as it is said, &#x201C;And fire came forth from the Lord&#x201D; (Num. xvi. 85).</p>
<p>No man departs from this world until some of that fire,<sup><xref rid="fn3937">2</xref></sup> which rested among the sons of man,<sup><xref rid="fn3938">3</xref></sup> passes over him, as it is said, &#x201C;And the fire rested&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xi. 2). &#x007C;&#x007C;</p>
<p>&#x201C;And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses<sup><xref rid="fn3939">4</xref></sup> because of the Cushite woman whom he had married&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xii. 1). Was she then a Cushite woman?<sup><xref rid="fn3940">5</xref></sup> Was she not Zipporah? But just as this Cushite<sup><xref rid="fn3941">6</xref></sup> is different as regards his body from all other people,<sup><xref rid="fn3942">7</xref></sup> so was Zipporah different from all other women by her words<sup><xref rid="fn3943">8</xref></sup> and by her good deeds; therefore was she called a Cushite, as it is said, &#x201C;For he had married a Cushite woman&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).</p>
<p>Rabbi Tachanah<sup><xref rid="fn3944">9</xref></sup> said: The Israelites also are called Cushites, as it is said, &#x201C;Are ye not as the children of the Cushites unto me,<sup><xref rid="fn3945">10</xref></sup> O children of Israel?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3946">11</xref></sup> (Amos ix. 7). Just as the body of this Cushite is different from all creatures, so do the Israelites differ from all the nations of the world in their ways and by their good deeds; therefore are they called Cushites. One Scripture saith, &#x201C;And Ebedmelech, the Cushite, said&#x201D; (Jer. xxxviii. 12). Was it Ebed?<sup><xref rid="fn3947">1</xref></sup> Was he not Baruch, son of Neriah?<sup><xref rid="fn3948">2</xref></sup> But just as this Cushite is different in his body from all other people, so was Baruch, son of Neriah, different in his deeds and good ways from the rest of the sons of men.<sup><xref rid="fn3949">3</xref></sup> Therefore was he called a Cushite.</p>
<p>One Scripture text says, &#x201C;Then said Joab to the Cushite, Go, tell the king<sup><xref rid="fn3950">4</xref></sup> what thou hast seen&#x201D; (2 Sam. xviii. 21). Was he a Cushite? Was he not a Benjamite?<sup><xref rid="fn3951">5</xref></sup> But just as this Cushite is different from all creatures, so was the Benjamite &#x007C;&#x007C; different by his ways and his good deeds;<sup><xref rid="fn3952">6</xref></sup> therefore was his name called &#x201C;Cushite.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Eliezer said: Come and see the integrity and perfection of that man, for he said to Joab, Even if thou wouldst give me gold and silver<sup><xref rid="fn3953">7</xref></sup> I would not transgress the king&#x2019;s commands which he commanded thee, as it is said, &#x201C;And the man said unto Joab,<sup><xref rid="fn3954">8</xref></sup> Though I should receive a thousand (pieces of) silver in mine hand&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 12). Joab said to him: I beseech thee, show me the place where Absalom is hanging. But he did not consent. Joab began to bend the knee, and to prostrate himself before him, as it is said, &#x201C;Then said Joab, Shall I not entreat<sup><xref rid="fn3955">9</xref></sup> thee in this wise?&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 14). Then he took (Joab) by his arm, and showed him the place where Absalom was hanging.<sup><xref rid="fn3956">10</xref></sup> Everyone who transgresses the commandment &#x201C;Honour thy father&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3957">11</xref></sup> is accounted as though he had transgressed the Decalogue. Therefore was (Absalom) pierced by ten spears, as it is said, &#x201C;And ten young men that bare Joab&#x2019;s armour compassed about<sup><xref rid="fn3958">1</xref></sup> and smote Absalom; and slew him&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 15).</p>
<p>Six people were similar to the first man,<sup><xref rid="fn3959">2</xref></sup> and they were all slain. They were: Samson with his<sup><xref rid="fn3960">3</xref></sup> might, and he was slain;<sup><xref rid="fn3961">4</xref></sup> Saul with his stature, and he was slain;<sup><xref rid="fn3962">5</xref></sup> Asahel with his swiftness, and he was slain;<sup><xref rid="fn3963">6</xref></sup> Josiah with his nostrils,<sup><xref rid="fn3964">7</xref></sup> and he was slain through his nostrils; Zedekiah with his eyes, and he was slain through his eyes;<sup><xref rid="fn3965">8</xref></sup> Absalom with his hair, and he was killed through his hair. Absalom was a mighty hero in battle, and his sword was bound upon his loins.<sup><xref rid="fn3966">9</xref></sup> Why &#x007C;&#x007C; did he not draw his sword and cut the hair of his head, and get down? But he saw that Gehinnom was open beneath him, and he said: It is better for me to hang by my hair<sup><xref rid="fn3967">10</xref></sup> and not to descend into the fire; therefore he was hanging,<sup><xref rid="fn3968">11</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Behold, I saw Absalom<sup><xref rid="fn3969">12</xref></sup> hanging in an oak&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 10).</p>
<p>Rabbi Jos&#x00E9; said: There are seven doors to Gehinnom. Absalom entered as far as the fifth door,<sup><xref rid="fn3970">13</xref></sup> and David heard (thereof), and began to weep, to lament, and to mourn, and he called<sup><xref rid="fn3971">14</xref></sup> Absalom&#x0021; My son&#x0021; five times,<sup><xref rid="fn3972">15</xref></sup> My son, my son, my son&#x0021; &#x201C;And the king was much moved, and he went up to the chamber over the gate,<sup><xref rid="fn3973">1</xref></sup> and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom&#x0021; would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son&#x0021;&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xviii. 33). And they<sup><xref rid="fn3974">2</xref></sup> brought him back from the five doors of Gehinnom, and he began to praise and laud and to glorify his Creator, saying: &#x201C;Shew me a token for good;<sup><xref rid="fn3975">3</xref></sup> that they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed: because thou, Lord, hast helped me, and comforted me&#x201D; (Ps. lxxxvi. 17). &#x201C;Thou hast helped me&#x201D; out of the war of Absalom, and &#x201C;thou hast comforted me&#x201D; in my mourning for him.<sup><xref rid="fn3976">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The eighth descent<sup><xref rid="fn3977">5</xref></sup> was when He<sup><xref rid="fn3978">6</xref></sup> descended into the Tabernacle, as it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud,<sup><xref rid="fn3979">7</xref></sup> and stood at the door of the Tent, and called Aaron and Miriam;<sup><xref rid="fn3980">8</xref></sup> and they both came forth&#x201D; (Num. xii. 5). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to them:<sup><xref rid="fn3981">9</xref></sup> Whosoever speaketh slander against his fellow in secret, hath no cure; if he slander his brother, the son of his father or the son of his mother,<sup><xref rid="fn3982">10</xref></sup> how much more so<sup><xref rid="fn3983">11</xref></sup> is this the case? The Holy One, blessed be He, was angry with them, and He departed from the Tent, as it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn3984">12</xref></sup> &#x201C;And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them; and he departed&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 9). &#x007C;&#x007C; &#x201C;And the cloud removed from over the Tent&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 10).<sup><xref rid="fn3985">1</xref></sup> Forthwith Miriam became leprous. The Holy One, blessed be He, said: If Aaron also be leprous,<sup><xref rid="fn3986">2</xref></sup> the High Priest, who is afflicted with a blemish, will not be able to bring an offering upon My altar;<sup><xref rid="fn3987">3</xref></sup> but he shall look upon his sister and become astonished,<sup><xref rid="fn3988">4</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn3989">5</xref></sup> Aaron went to Moses, and said to him: O our lord, Moses&#x0021; Brethren do not suffer themselves to be separated one from the other except through death, as it is said, &#x201C;Though he be fruitful among his brethren&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3990">6</xref></sup> (Hos. xiii. 15). Our sister, while still among the living, is separated from us,<sup><xref rid="fn3991">7</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;Let her not, I pray, be as one dead&#x201D; (Num. xii. 12). Not only this, but now all Israel will hear and say that the sister of Moses and Aaron is leprous. Half of this infamous report concerns thee.<sup><xref rid="fn3992">8</xref></sup> Moses was appeased by the words, and he arose and prayed for her,<sup><xref rid="fn3993">9</xref></sup> and He was entreated of him, as it is said, &#x201C;And Moses cried unto the Lord, saying,<sup><xref rid="fn3994">10</xref></sup> Heal her, O God, I beseech thee&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 13).</p>
<p>Rabbi Levitas, a man of Jamnia, said: Unless the father<sup><xref rid="fn3995">11</xref></sup> of a leprous person spit<sup><xref rid="fn3996">12</xref></sup> in his face, he will not be healed,<sup><xref rid="fn3997">13</xref></sup> as it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her face,<sup><xref rid="fn3998">1</xref></sup> would she not be ashamed seven days?&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 14). Hence (the sages) say: A male afflicted with unclean issue (needs) seven (days for his purification<sup><xref rid="fn3999">2</xref></sup>); a woman with an issue (requires) seven (days&#x2019; separation); a menstruant (needs) seven (days of purification);<sup><xref rid="fn4000">3</xref></sup> one made unclean through a corpse<sup><xref rid="fn4001">4</xref></sup> (needs) seven (days of purification); a mourner (mourns for) seven (days); the wedding feast (lasts) seven (days);<sup><xref rid="fn4002">5</xref></sup> and a leprous person (requires) seven (days&#x2019; separation). (Whence do we know that<sup><xref rid="fn4003">6</xref></sup>) a male with an unclean issue (requires) seven days (for his purification)? &#x007C;&#x007C; (Because it is said,<sup><xref rid="fn4003">6</xref></sup>) &#x201C;And when he that hath an issue is cleansed<sup><xref rid="fn4004">7</xref></sup> of his issue, then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing&#x201D; (Lev. xv. 13).

<p>Rabbi said: They<sup><xref rid="fn4012">6</xref></sup> slandered God again and said, We were dwelling in the land of Egypt in ease and contentment, but the Holy One, blessed be He, and Moses have brought us forth from Egypt to die in the wilderness, as it is said, &#x201C;And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up<sup><xref rid="fn4010">4</xref></sup> out of Egypt to die in the wilderness?&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> xxi. 5). What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do unto them? He sent against them fiery serpents which bit and killed them, as it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord sent among the people fiery serpents,<sup><xref rid="fn4010">4</xref></sup> and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 6). Moses beheld the misfortune of Israel, and he arose and prayed on their behalf. The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: Moses&#x0021; Make thee a serpent of copper like that serpent<sup><xref rid="fn4013">7</xref></sup> &#x007C;&#x007C; which spoke slander betwixt Adam and his helpmate, and place it on a high place. Let every man who has been bitten direct his heart to his Father<sup><xref rid="fn4014">1</xref></sup> who is in heaven, and let him gaze at that serpent, and he will be healed. Moses made a serpent of copper and set it up in a high place, and every man who had been bitten turned his heart to his Father who is in heaven, and gazed at that serpent, forthwith he became restored to health, as it is said, &#x201C;And it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten<sup><xref rid="fn4015">2</xref></sup> any man, when he looked at the serpent of copper, he lived&#x201D; (<italic>ibid.</italic> 9); and it also says, &#x201C;If the serpent bite without enchantment, then is there no advantage in the master of the tongue&#x201D; (Eccles. x. 11).<sup><xref rid="fn4016">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Meir said: If a doctor visit one whom a serpent has bitten, and cure him, verily will goodness be shown to this one.<sup><xref rid="fn4017">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Rabbi Jos&#x00E9; said: If a man hire a workman who is zealous, and (when) he discharges him should he give him his wages in full; what favour does he give him?<sup><xref rid="fn4018">5</xref></sup> But if he hire a workman who is lazy, (when) he discharges him should he give him his wages in full, verily he is giving him a real favour.<sup><xref rid="fn4019">6</xref></sup> Likewise spake Solomon before the Holy One, blessed be He<sup><xref rid="fn4020">7</xref></sup>: Sovereign of all the worlds&#x0021; Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were zealous workmen. Thou gavest to them wages in full, of their own (earnings) Thou didst give them. But we are lazy workmen, and when Thou wilt give us our wages in full, and wilt heal us; verily, every one will praise Thee and bless (Thee).<sup><xref rid="fn4021">8</xref></sup></p>

<p>Immediately following the <italic>P.R.E</italic>. in the MS. comes the well-known Aboth de R. Nathan, the text of which corresponds to the Recension &#x201C;A&#x201D; in Dr. Schechter&#x2019;s edition. In a future work, I hope to translate the chapters claimed to belong to <italic>P.R.E</italic>., and published by Horowitz, and later by Friedmann in his edition of the Tanna de b&#x00EA; Elijahu.</p>
<p>I have a very humble favour to ask at the hands of my readers. Will they kindly let me know whether they can suggest any variations in my translation and offer any parallels from Jewish and Christian and Mohammedan, as well as from classical literature, in illustration of the various points arising out of this Midrash? I am painfully aware that this work is in a very crude condition, and that there are many errors, but in spite of all its blemishes I sincerely hope that something of value may be found in this volume, which has cost the author very many hours of toil snatched away from leisure and holiday.</p>

<p>D<small>R</small>. B<small>&#x00DC;CHLER&#x2019;S</small> essay, &#x201C;<italic>Das Schneiden des Haares als Strafe der Ehebrecher bei den Semiten</italic>,&#x201D; which appeared in the <italic>Wiener Zeitschrift f&#x00FC;r die Kunde des Morgenlandes</italic>, xviii. pp. 91&#x2013;138, demonstrates that the punishment of cutting the hair of one guilty of adultery arose under Arabian influence. This penalty is unknown in the Talmud and Midrash. The custom was known to R. Simon b. Zemach Duran, <italic>c</italic>. 1440, who quotes the <italic>Pir&#x1E33;&#x00EA; de R. Eliezer</italic>, xiv., as his authority. The punishment was already known in the Geonic age. Na&#x1E6D;ronai Gaon (857&#x2013;867) is said to have been the authority when this form of punishment was discussed (cf. <italic>Halakhoth Pesu&#x1E33;oth</italic>, ed. M&#x00FC;ller, p. 53, No. 94, and <italic>Sha&#x2018;ar&#x00EA; Zede&#x1E33;</italic>, p. 25, No. 13). The earliest reference is in <italic>Halakhoth &#x1E32;ezuboth</italic>, attributed to the Gaon Jehudai of Sura, <italic>c.</italic> 760 (in Horowitz, <span dir="rtl">&#x05EA;&#x05D5;&#x05E8;&#x05EA;&#x05DF; &#x05E9;&#x05DC; &#x05E8;&#x05D0;&#x05E9;&#x05D5;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>, i. 29). On the basis of these facts Dr. B&#x00FC;chler infers that the curse pronounced upon Eve that a woman should not have her hair cut save for adultery arose in the Schools of Sura and Pumbaditha. This fact may point to the home and date of the <italic>Pir&#x1E33;&#x00EA; de R. Eliezer</italic>, which was probably written after the introduction of this penalty; but see Perls in <italic>Magyar-Zsid&#x00F3; Szemle</italic>, vol. xxiii. p. 124, who suggests as the correct reading <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05E0;&#x05DC;&#x05D4; &#x05D0;&#x05D5;&#x05D7;&#x05D5;</span> for <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05E0;&#x05DC;&#x05D7;&#x05EA;&#x05D5;</span>.</p>
