"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Chanuka 1","“What is Chanuka?” (<i>Shabbat</i> 21b). It is written (Tehillim, 119: 105), “Your word is a candle to my feet, and light for my path.” “A candle to my feet,” meaning that the blessed God bestows the words of Torah in a way that “His Kingship in all of His dominion” (Tehillim, 103:19) is recognized in each detail of action. “A light for my path” means that the blessed God illuminates a special recognition also in a general way, for “the kingdom is His.” (It is written this way) because a candle is something specific, and light something general. The blessed God created the world in general, and divided it into three categories—time, place, and person. It is written (Tehillim, 139:16), “He fashioned days, and it is in one of them” (usually understood that when He created each of the six days of creation He knew everything, every detail, that would ever happen in that day for all time to come).<br/>This means that in these three categories, He chose in particular the choicest element through which to illuminate in a revealed way a specific light and the recognition of His sovereignty, may it be blessed. In the category of place, He created the world in general, where the land of Israel is sanctified above the whole earth. (See Mishna <i>Kelim</i>, Ch. 1:6.) Jerusalem sanctified above all the land of Israel, the five-hundred-square cubits of the temple mount sanctified above Jerusalem, and the courtyard and chamber sanctified above them all. In this very place He commanded to light the Menorah in order to illuminate this particular recognition in this specific place. In the category of time He created the six days of creation, in particular the day of Shabbat, and then we also find the commandment to kindle the light of Shabbat. In the category of person He chose specifically the nation of Israel out of all the nations. For now, until the final refinement (<i>birrur</i>) in Israel, He chose the tribe of Levi, and among them the Cohanim, and among them the High Priest, and gave him in particular the commandment to light the Menorah.<br/>In the days of the Hasmoneans, the Holy One, blessed be He, shone into them from the illumination of the future, for at that time he merited <i>Malchut</i>, kingship. In the same way that it will be revealed by means of Moshiach ben David, when the process of refinement will be completed, and then the chosen tribe will be Yehuda. So then, when the Hasmoneans merited this <i>Malchut</i>, the light of the recognition of the chosenness of each individual soul in Israel was greatly increased. Resulting from the miracle that was made with the Menorah, an individual candle (illumination) was established for the chosenness of each individual soul in Israel.<br/>This is as King David said (Tehillim, 87:6), “God will count, when He writes down the nations, and for Zion He will say each one born to her.” “Count, when He writes down the nations,” for with the nations, God’s Providence is only for the endurance of the species, like other parts of creation. “And for Zion He will say each one born to her” is that for Israel the Providence of the Holy One, blessed be He, is for each individual soul, each one born to her. The verse continues, “and He will establish her at the highest,” means that for every one born to Israel, immediately upon birth, there is a recognition that the choicest soul has been born anew, and this is as it is said, “a candle for every one.” This is the difference of opinion between the house of Shammai and the house of Hillel, meaning just how the final <i>birrur</i>, refinement, will be in Israel, and how to light the Chanuka candles, which hint at this. The house of Shammai asserts that we light all eight on the first night, and remove a candle each night, which represents the refinement as destroying the waste, decreasing and continuing until the <i>Kedusha</i> (holiness) remains, completely clarified. The house of Hillel asserts that we add and continue, adding a candle each night, for here the principle is to cause the <i>Kedusha</i> to spread forth at all times, and from this it follows that the waste will be nullified.<br/>This is also the meaning of the Halacha for the time of lighting the candles “from the setting of the sun until the foot [<i>regel</i>] finishes from the market,” meaning that (with lighting) no force of habit [<i>hergel</i>] will be found in any soul in Israel. This is the mitzvah to light it in the doorway of the house from outside, meaning that the candle—this recognition discussed above—should illuminate every step with intent for the sake of Heaven. And of what is said (<i>Shabbat</i>, 21b), “until the wood-sellers will leave the market [who would stay after everyone else had left to gather leftover wood],” which means, when the final clarification in Israel will be completed.<br/>Concerning this it is explained in the tractate <i>Yevamot</i> (17b), “they established six thousand archers [who went and raped the daughters of Jerusalem at the time of the destruction],” meaning that their seed was mixed into Israel, and this is the principal reason for the lengthening of the exile. When this becomes clarified, then the will of the blessed God will be explicit before us, and this is “from the setting of the sun,” for the sun hints at the principles of the words of Torah, and in the future these principles will not be necessary; rather the blessed God will cause an effluence of explicit understanding to each one in Israel for each specific action. This is as it is said, “a Chanuka candle that is placed above ten cubits is invalid,” which is true for a <i>sukkah</i> and a <i>mavoy</i> (an open street or alley, concerning its width in the laws of Eruvin, symbolic Shabbat boundaries). (So for the three general divisions of existence) the Chanuka candle represents person, <i>sukkah</i> represents place, and the <i>mavoy</i> (in the laws of Shabbat) represents time, for the choicest of times is Shabbat."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Rosh Hashanah 1","[From the “Tiferet Yosef” of Mordechai Yosef Elazar of Radzin, Great Grandson of the Mei HaShiloach]"
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Rosh Hashanah 2","<i>“Blow in the month the shofar, in the covering of the new moon of the day of our festival.”</i> (Tehillim, 81:4)<br/>It is written in the Holy Zohar (Vayechi, 226b), “it is taught that it is the beginning of the year of the king.” Everything is included in the beginning of the intention. If at the outset of something one turns to the blessed God, thus all the resulting adventures will be included in the initial intention. As we find in the Midrash (Kohollet Rabba, 7), “‘The end of something is better than its beginning’ means really that the end of something is good when it is good from the beginning.” This also teaches of what we find in the Gemara (<i>Baba Metsia</i>, 85b), “Rabbi Chaya said to Rabbi Chanina … ‘I have made it so the Torah will not be forgotten from Israel. First I sowed flax, and made of it nets. Then with the nets I trapped some deer, from which I fed their meat to the orphans. From their skins I made scrolls, on which I wrote the five books of the Torah. Then I went to a town and found five children, and taught each one a book of the Torah. Then I found six children, and taught each one of the six orders of Mishna. Then I told them, I am leaving, and will return. Before I do, I want you to teach the Torah and the Mishna to each other. This is what I have done so the Torah would not be forgotten from Israel.’”<br/>This means that since from the beginning of the actions of Rabbi Chaya that the Gemara described, his great intention was so that the Torah would not be forgotten from Israel, then accordingly it is all called in his name. For this is the principle that everything goes after the first intention. And this is the matter with “<i>mitzvot</i> need intention,” meaning that even after the intention, when a man starts the action of the mitzvah, the light dresses itself in the forms of actions, and the light becomes hidden. But for this, it needs the intention, so that everything goes after the intention, and this is in the realm of man. And so it is with the blessed God, as it were. For in truth, the beginning of the intention of the creation was as it is written (Tehillim, 89), “For I said that I will found the world on <i>Chesed</i> [Loving-kindness].” This means that the beginning of God’s will to create the world was for Israel, for Israel was the first to raise up in His thought. Even though He established afterward many different “garments,” in creation before the utterance, “Let us make a man,” still with God, this too was, as it were, included in the beginning. That is, if man goes in the way of Divine service, he will eventually arrive at this initial will of Israel being the first to arise in His thought. And this is also the mitzvah of blowing the shofar on Rosh Hashanah, because on this day the light of the blessed God begins to dress itself in garments.<br/>This is the meaning of “blow the shofar in the month, on the day of our festival in the covering of the new moon,” on which the Gemara comments (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, 40b), “on which festival does the moon cover itself? I would say Rosh Hashanah.” For there it is at the point of the beginning where God’s holy will begins to cover itself in hidden garments. And at that point we have the mitzvah of the shofar. For the shofar is the inner voice, and the Holy Zohar says (Pinchas, 128b), “there is no speech [<i>Dibbur</i>—the practical execution of the soul’s will] without voice [<i>Kol</i>—the inner soul and will itself], and there is no voice without speech. This is true in the world of <i>Atsilut</i> (the closest spiritual realm to the Infinite, where there is no separation and no existence of evil, rather all pure emanation ex nihilo). Yet in the world of separation [our own imperfect world] there is voice without speech.” This means that (at the moment of blowing the shofar on Rosh Hashanah) man will immediately accept the blessed God’s reign over him before the light begins to dress itself in the garments that we call speech. Once done, of their own accord all the adventures and details of the entire year will be included in this beginning."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Rosh Hashanah 3","<i>“In the seventh month on the first of the month ….”</i> (Bamidbar, 29:1)<br/>It is written (Shmuel 1, Ch. 25, when David haMelech opened to Naval in peace), “and you shall say thus to the living, ‘<i>co lechai</i>’”, and it says on this in the Holy Zohar (Vayera, 23b), “this day was the festival of Rosh Hashanah, and it is because of the Holy One, blessed be He, it is said, ‘<i>co lechai</i>,’ ‘thus to the living,’ meaning you must connect <i>co</i> to <i>chai</i>, to the source on which all life depends.” <i>Co</i>, “thus,” denotes that which remains in one’s apprehension after one engages in serving God, as it is written concerning Avraham Avinu (<i>Bereshit</i>, 15:5), “<i>co yihye za’areicha</i>, thus will be your seed.”<br/>This means that Avraham Avinu wanted to apprehend the remnant that remained after the service that he had performed. For he knew well that from God’s point of view something was left over from all his actions of service, yet he wanted a clear apprehension of it, so God said to him. “This [<i>co</i>] will be your seed after you,” that you will understand that you need to connect your service in this world to the primordial will of God with the creation. This means that from God’s perspective there is a king without a people, as we say in “Adon Olam,” “the Master of the world who reigned before anything was created.” Yet only from the side that He wanted to improve his creation, the blessed God created the understanding in the human intellect that there is no king without a people to make him king. From the side of the created intellect man must accept upon himself the yoke of God’s kingship in his apprehension. And after the act of service he must connect this apprehension to a place that is above all orders of service.<br/>We find in the Holy Zohar (<i>Bamidbar</i>, 2), “at the time when humankind was of the ‘two faces,’ [see the first of the two creations of man, in <i>Bereshit</i> 1:27, where it says, “male and female He created them”] male and female were connected as one.” This means that there was no veil separating the creation and the light of the blessed God. And all of the creation had an explicit understanding that all who separated from the Torah were as much as separating from life itself. So from this kind of understanding there is no room for man’s service. Yet the blessed God wants to improve his creation and desires that man will have a way to serve Him. For this reason there was the <i>nesira</i>, the separation of female from male, on Rosh Hashanah. And this separation is as it is written (<i>Bereshit</i>, 2:21), “and God cast a deep slumber on man and he slept.”<br/>This means that he created a veil separating the creation and the light of the blessed God. Thus man must break the veil and understand as it was before the separation. As it says in the Holy Zohar (<i>Lech L’cha</i>, 85b), “when souls go out they go out as male and female as one, afterward they are separated, and God rejoins them in union according to the service of man.” And it is said in the Holy Zohar (<i>Bamidbar</i>, 2b), “before, the female was united on her side,” meaning that there was no veil to cause separation. “And afterward they separated,” means that the blessed God established separating veils. “And God rejoins them according to man’s service” means that according to how much man works in Divine service to break the veil, accordingly he will see the connection that he has with the light of the blessed God as it was before the separation.<br/>This is, “Blow the shofar in the month, in the covering of the new moon on the day of our festival,” that all the other festivals occur on the full moon, meaning that the blessed God turns to His creation, that His creation should have an understanding of his light. But on this festival it is “in the covering,” as it says in the Holy Zohar (<i>Shoftim</i>, 275b), “that the moon covers itself,” meaning that the creation does not recognize the light of the blessed God. And this is the mitzvah of blowing the shofar, where by means of this mitzvah man may connect his apprehension of this world with God’s primordial will.<br/>And this is why it said above in the Zohar, “this day [that David approached Naval with peace] was the day of the festival of Rosh Hashanah, where one must connect <i>co</i> [thus] with <i>chai</i> [life].” That on this day, by means of blowing the shofar, we may break the separating veil that came into existence with the separation (<i>nesira</i>, of male and female), and we raise and connect the apprehension of this world to <i>chai</i>, life. Which itself is God’s primordial will in creation, which is above and beyond any order of Divine service. Thus we can connect everything created to the source on which all life depends."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Rosh Hashanah 4","<i>“And it was, after these words, that E-lohim tested Avraham.”</i> (Bereshit, 22:1)<br/>It is written (Tehillim, 60:6), “You have given a banner to those who fear You, that it may be displayed because of the truth, selah.” (Or as R. Hirsch translates, “to raise themselves to its height before the might of wisdom.”) What does it mean, “after these words?” The Gemara explains:<br/>And it was, after these words, that God tested Avraham. What is meant by “after”? Rabbi Yochanan said in the name of Rabbi Yossi ben Zimra, “After the words of Satan, as it is written, ‘And the child grew, and was weaned. And Avraham made a great feast the same day that Yitschok was weaned.’ Thereupon Satan said to the Almighty; ‘Master of the Universe! To this old man did you graciously promise a child at the age of a hundred, yet of all that banquet which he prepared, he did not have one turtle-dove or pigeon to sacrifice before You! Has he not done anything on honor of his son!’ God answered, ‘Yet were I to say to him, “Sacrifice your son before Me,” he would do so immediately.’” Right after this, “God tested Avraham.”<br/>The Satan brought forth the great accusation, “how does Avraham deserve that God should act with him in a way above the power of nature?” This is “<i>nissa et Avraham</i>—and he tested Avraham.” <i>Nissa</i> in Hebrew means both to test, and also to raise or elevate. In other words, the blessed God elevated the entire system of the creation, and showed that He did this according to correct judgment. He showed the creation that Avraham himself was the principle of the entire creation, and by means of him the blessed God effuses life to the entire creation. He showed them that the entire word was created only to command this, as it says in the Midrash (Rabba, <i>Lech L’cha</i>, 39), “even ships that were sailing in the sea were blessed [or protected] because of our Forefather Avraham.” It is asked in the Midrash, “But did they not contain forbidden wine? The proverb says, ‘Vinegar cheapens wine.’ Wherever Gentile wine is available, Jewish wine is cheap.” That is to say, that he was the main principle of all of the creation, so much that even that from which benefit is forbidden was blessed because of him. This is all because Avraham would serve God in a way that was above nature. In truth, God never said specifically to him, “slaughter your son.” (God said, “<i>ha’alehu sham l’olah</i>,” “raise him there as an offering.”)<br/>The Zohar comments on this (<i>Vayeira</i>, 120a), “the Divine utterance came to him as a mirror that does not illuminate [signifying a lower level of prophecy].” As it is written in the Midrash (Rabba, <i>Vayeira</i>, 56), “Avraham was perplexed. Avraham asked of Hashem ‘Yesterday You said to me, Your seed will be called in Yitschok, and today You say, take your only son, and raise him.’” The meaning is, if he had the tendency of the love of a father for his son according to the way of nature, he could have understood the blessed God’s command to have been, “Raise him as an offering, but do not slaughter him.” But rather, he served God in a way outside of the realm of nature, and removed all natural tendencies of the love of a father for his son. The blessed God showed the creation that exactly because of this, the blessed God deals with him in a way that is above nature. After this Avraham prayed (<i>Bereshit</i>, 22:14), “as it is said to this day, on the mountain God is seen.”<br/>That is, he prayed to the blessed God that from that day on it would no longer be necessary for anyone to suffer this kind of supernal patience (or perhaps, the suffering he had to go through to serve God above nature). Rather, whenever his seed after him would want to recognize His blessed light, then the blessed God would immediately illuminate him. This is as it is said in the Midrash (Rabba, <i>Vayigash</i>, 94), “we look up, and it is if the ashes of Yitschok are piled on the altar.” This means that Avraham’s prayer was effective, that something remained of Avraham’s supernal patience permanently instilled in all generations to come, so they would not need to suffer his kind of patience."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Rosh Hashanah 5","<i>“… E-lohim tested Avraham.”</i> (Bereshit, 22)<br/>It is written in the Holy Zohar (<i>Vayeira</i>, 120a), “the test was in an <i>aspaclaria d’la meira</i>, a glass that does not illuminate.” Truly, when a man stands and has a revealed and explicit understanding that all comes from You and is given from Your hand, then it cannot be said that this service can be called in the name of the man. For there is nothing remarkable in this, as it is written in the Holy Zohar (<i>Shmini</i>, 38a), “he sent a gift to the house of the King, and He showed him that he took from the house of the King and gave it back to the King.” Furthermore, it is written in the Midrash (Rabba, <i>Emor</i>, 27) on the verse (Iyov, 41:3), “Who has preceded me, that I should repay him, all that is under the heavens is Mine.” “Who could praise Me before I gave him a soul with which to praise?” It is only because the blessed God desires to forever improve his creations, and that His service should be called in the name of the one who does it—the work of the hands of the man—that He concealed this revelation from man. Thus man does not have an explicit awareness of this (that all that he gives to God was originally taken from God), and it seems to man that he has what to give.<br/>Then after, when man manages to break through by means of his service, and has a clear awareness that at present it is the blessed God’s will that what he has be returned before the blessed God, then this service is considered as the work of the man himself and called in his name. Concerning this, Avraham’s test was called “a mirror that does not illuminate.” This is as it is written in the Midrash (Rabba, <i>Vayeira</i>, 56), “Avraham was perplexed. Avraham asked of Hashem ‘Yesterday You said to me, Your seed will be called in Yitschok, and today You say, take your only son, and raise him.’” He was confronted with contradictory utterances from God, and if he had even a small tendency of the natural love of a father from his son in this world, then he could have resolved it by saying, “He commanded me to offer Yitschok, but not to slaughter him.” Rather, Avraham Avinu removed himself from all natural tendencies of the love of a father for his son and fulfilled the will of the blessed God. This was the essence of his test. We find that from the side of Avraham Avinu the life of Yitschok Avinu was already considered as nothing, and his entire life remained from the Divine utterance, “do not send your hand against the child.” (In other words, Avraham had become a complete vessel for God’s will, as expressed in each Divine communication.<br/>So when God said, “raise your son as a sacrifice,” that was Avraham’s entire purpose in the world, in a supernatural way, as explained. Then when God said, “do not send your hand,” this became his entire purpose. Betsalel.) In these words, the blessed God showed that His entire will desired the life of Israel. This is the meaning of Avraham’s prayer that follows, “where it is said unto this day, on the mountain God is seen.” In other words, he prayed that the blessed God would always show the deep connection that was in force at the time of the binding of Yitschok, a connection that desires the life of Israel. This is as it is written in the Midrash (Rabba, <i>Vayigash</i>, 94), “we look up, and it is if the ashes of Yitschok are piled on the altar.”<br/>This is to say, that Avraham’s prayer was successful, that the desire for the life of Israel is, as it were, always before God’s eyes. Concerning this we pray “today,” on Rosh Hashanah, on the binding of Yitschok to his progeny, “Today, remember with compassion.” The end of the blessing we recite in the service reads, “Blessed is He who remembers the Covenant.” This means that from the time of the binding of Yitschok, the blessed God was thoroughly connected to Israel in the desire for the life of Israel. This is the meaning of the blessing ending, “Blessed is He who remembers the Covenant.” For concerning the blessing of a fast it is written in the Gemara (<i>Ta’anit</i>, 15), “He who answered us at the Sea of Reeds… Blessed is He who remembers the forgotten.”<br/>The whole matter of a miracle is because man forgets. For truly, on the day Adam was created, he saw the ocean raging and swelling, and his reaction was as if he was witnessing the miracle of the splitting of the Sea of Reeds. Yet since man is a forgetful creature, and has become accustomed to the nature of this world and the motion of the sea, when finally the Sea of Reeds split it was seen as a miracle. A miracle is only when man is awoken from the forgetting, which causes him not to see that everything is coming from the blessed God. Yet when one witnesses a miracle, he wakes up and sees this. This is how our blessing of “Blessed is He who remembers the forgotten” is only from our point of view, for with the blessed God, “there is no forgetting before His throne of Glory.” Of Him we bless, “Blessed is He who remembers the Covenant.”"

"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Five Scrolls, Ruth 2","<i>“Let your eyes be on the field where they are reaping ….”</i> (Ruth, 2:9)<br/>“Let your eyes be on the field” means the ability to expand outward. “Where they are reaping” means that surely it will be completed for the good. There is sowing, and there is reaping. “Sowing” is when one first accepts upon himself the yoke of the sovereignty of heaven. At that time he must constrict himself against running after the object of his lust. This is as it is said (in the third section of the <i>Shema</i>, concerning <i>tsitsit, Bamidbar</i>, 15:36), “so you will not seek out after your eyes and after your hearts.” On this it is said in the Tehillim (126:5), “those who sow in tears [will reap in joy].” “Tears” signifies constriction. This is understood in the laws of <i>truma</i> (tithes). The Gemara comments on the verse (<i>Shemot</i>, 22:28), “do not delay in giving the produce of your winepresses (<i>Dima’acha</i> the same as the word for tears, which Rashi says refers to required tithes).” There it says that even one grain of wheat that must be tithed is mixed into a measure of wheat that is exempt, then the whole measure must be tithed.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">Hence the word for tear, <i>Dima’a</i>, signifies constriction and limitation.</i><br/>This all concerns the time of sowing. However, in the time of reaping, when man’s heart is sufficiently refined, and he only desires that which is God’s will, then man is permitted to extend as befits his will. On this it says, “let your eyes be on the field where they reap,” meaning that in the time of reaping it is permitted to seek out after your eyes.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">Or, where your desires lead you.</i> “Field” signifies expansion into one’s desires. This is why Eisav was described as (<i>Bereshit</i>, 25:27) “a man of the field,” for he went after his heart with all of his desires. However, when one’s heart is not yet purified, it is forbidden to expand outward. Then at the time when his heart is refined, it is called “the scent of a field that God has blessed.”<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">Which Yitschok said of Yaakov when he blessed him.</i>"
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Five Scrolls, Ruth 3","<i>“God shall pay you for your work, and your reward shall be complete ….”</i> (Ruth, 2:12)<br/>In the Midrash on Ruth it is written (Ruth Rabba, 5:4), “Rav Chasa said, [the reward is given] because you will take shelter under the wings of the Divine Presence.” “Your reward shall be complete” means that every action will be called in your name, whether in thought or in deed. Yet truly, the realm of thought is in the hands of the blessed God. Therefore Rav Chasa said, “because you came to take shelter under His wings,” namely, that of your own initiative you came to take refuge with God and to ascribe all your actions to the blessed God. Therefore the blessed God responds in kind, by calling even thoughts<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">Which should be the province of God.</i> the actions of man. This is the meaning of the name of Rav Chasa, for there is a principle that the sages of the Talmud are called in the name of their teaching. <i>Chasa</i>, is directly related to “<i>Chusa</i>—taking refuge,” as in “taking refuge in the shadow of His wings.” This is as it is written in the Midrash (Shir HaShirim Rabba, 23:25), “what is ‘with the crown with which His mother crowned Him.’ (Shir HaShirim 3)? This is likened to a king who loved his daughter so much, that he was not satisfied with calling her ‘daughter’ or ‘sister,’ and could only thoroughly express his love for her when he called her ‘his mother.’ [For there are various verses where God likens Israel to a daughter or a sister, and here in the present verse He calls Israel ‘His mother.’]”<br/>Since David haMelech had said (Divrei haYamim 1, 29:14), “all things have come from You, from Your own hand have we given to You,” meaning that he ascribed all the actions of man to the blessed God, for this precisely, “He [God] could thoroughly express his love for her until He called her ‘His mother.’ ” “Mother” means thought (as the mother gives birth to the child, so does thought give birth to action). Thus even the realm of thought will then be called in your name. This is as it is written in the Midrash (<i>Bamidbar</i> Rabba, 12:18), “it told to Moshe concerning the sacrifices which they brought at the inauguration of the Tabernacle, “take from them.”<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">The princes knew what to offer, each a bull, and every two a wagon, which had not even been told to Moshe. Thus Moshe feared that the <i>Shechina</i> had departed from them and rested on the princes. Thus God reassured Moshe, saying, “take from them.” See the Mei HaShiloach, last selection in <i>Parshat Nasso</i>, for more on this.</i> Moshe Rabeynu’s mind had weakened when he saw that the action of the princes. Then the blessed God told him to take that which the princes had brought, for this was the work of their hands. Thus the prince Netanel ben Tsoar had raised (presented) this advice, for he knew that, “God had placed wisdom in his mouth” (Mishlei, 2:6). For this, the matter was called in their name, as explained in its place in <i>Parshat Nasso</i> (last selection)."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Five Scrolls, Ecclesiastes 1",
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Five Scrolls, Ecclesiastes 2","<i>“It is good to take hold of this, and from this you should not remove your hand ….”</i> (Kohellet, 7:18)<br/>The blessed God commanded Israel to serve Him in two ways; with the active performance of an action, and with refraining from action. This is what Shlomo haMelech meant when he said, “take hold of this, and from this do not remove.” In other words, if you are to fulfill the will of the blessed God through the active performance of an action, then do so with careful consideration and deliberation. The only way to fulfill the blessed God’s will in completeness is if it is done completely for the sake of Heaven, and this requires careful consideration of all actions, even with the performance of a mitzvah. Also, at the time when one fulfills the will of the blessed God through refraining from action, such as the observance of the Shabbat and the like, it must also be done with careful consideration. This means not to refrain from action because of laziness, but rather the refrain of action must also be done with alacrity. This means that a man will want to do forbidden work on the Shabbat but will actively refrain from it.<br/>This is as it is written (Yeshayahu, 28:18), “if you turn away your foot on the Shabbat,” meaning that a man wants to go and do something, but he remembers that it is Shabbat and actively restrains his feet from taking him to do it. A man who is constantly involved in serving the blessed God will fulfill each mitzvah with both aspects. Thus the active performance of a mitzvah will receive an illumination from the careful consideration of the prohibitive commandments, and the prohibitive commandments will be done with alacrity from an illumination from the active performance of <i>mitzvot</i>."

Therefore it is said (Yeshayahu, 63:1), “He is great in saving.” This means that he gave great advice concerning the eventual merit and salvations before Him. Therefore it says, “rejoice, young man, in your youth,” meaning in all your expansions, will arrive at its final rectification and a good end.<br/>Eventually everything will be understood as how it was the will of the blessed God. Then that which had been done in greater expansion will be the choicest of actions. Therefore it says, “know that for all you do God will bring you to judgment,” for there also is a judgment for everything. This is as it is said by way of example (Kohellet Rabba, 11:13), “If one tells you, swim in the river, do not swim too far, for you will then have to swim back.” Even if you can get where you are going, it will then be difficult for you to return. Similarly Shlomo haMelech warns not to expand too much in the matters of this world, for you will have to then return to a place of judgment, meaning to the will of the blessed God. Then a man will have to suffer from this before he achieves refinement. This is why they wanted to conceal Kohellet, because first he gives brazen strength to Israel (in saying, “rejoice, young man, in your youth”), but when they saw afterward that he said that all will be according to judgment, they said, “Shlomo has said well.”"
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Prophets, Joshua 1",
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Prophets, Joshua 2","<i>“And it was, when the</i> Cohanim, <i>carrying the ark of the covenant of God, came up out of the Jordan river, the soles of the feet of the</i> Cohanim <i>were transferred onto the dry land … [The Jordan had been split for the arrival of the children of Israel into the land]</i>.” (Yehoshua, 4:18)<br/>The geographical entity of the Jordan river corresponds to the liver in man, which teaches of anger. This is as we find in the Gemara (<i>Nedarim</i>, 22b), “Ulla was entering Israel by way of the Jordan with two companions. One of the companions slew the other, not quite killing him. He then asked Ulla, ‘did I do well?’ Ulla told him to slit his throat [both in fearing that he would then slay Ulla, and also to end his pain]. Reb Yochanan asked Ulla, ‘how could you encourage such violence in the land of Israel?’ Ulla replied, ‘we had not yet crossed the Jordan.’”<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">Hence the Jordan signifies anger.</i> The geographical entity of the Seà of Reeds (<i>Yam Suf</i>) corresponds to the spinal column in man, which represents desire. (Perhaps as a direct connection from the head to the genitalia.) When Moshe Rabeynu had split the Sea of Reeds, he was elevating all of Israel above any desire that could overpower them, and thus they crossed over on dry land (signifying conquering of desire). When Yehoshua split the Jordan, which corresponds to anger, he enabled all of Israel to overcome their anger. Yet the <i>Cohanim</i> passed over all the waters of the Jordan (as it seems, they stood at first on the water, in Chapter 3, verse 8), for the <i>Cohen</i> is the servant of God, and his anger is the wrath of Torah scholars (a kind of permitted wrath in the honor of the Torah), which is good from all sides (Zohar, <i>Shemot</i>, 182b)."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Prophets, Joshua 3","<i>“Then Yehoshua spoke to God … the sun and moon shall still in Givon ….”</i> (Yehoshua, 10:12)<br/>It is written in the tractate <i>Avoda Zara</i> (25a) “that day was the length of two days.” Moshe Rabeynu’s task was the Torah, and Yehoshua’s task was action, as our sages have said (Midrash Sochar Tov, 21), “He gave majesty [<i>hod</i>] to Moshe and beauty [<i>hadar</i>] to Yehoshua.” <i>Hod</i> represents the internal aspect and <i>hadar</i> represents the appearance from the outside, as is explained in the Mei HaShiloach, <i>Parshat Vayaqhel</i> (second selection). Moshe Rabeynu was in the desert, and he experienced Shabbat through refraining from action, for Shabbat represents knowing the name of God in everything, as is explained. Yehoshua was among those who entered the land, and he experienced Shabbat through active performance of action. Therefore the sun stood still in order to include one of the days of the week in his Shabbat, and this hints that the very action was the day of Shabbat."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Prophets, Joshua 4","<i>“God spoke unto Yehoshua, saying: Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, make cities of refuge, of which I have already spoke with you through Moshe.”</i> (Yehoshua, 20:1–2)<br/>Why is the subject of the cities of refuge taught in the book of Yehoshua?<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">For the cities of refuge were already discussed in the Pentateuch.</i> Moshe Rabeynu had taken from the portion of Yehoshua when he had conquered the lands of Sichon and Og, and divided their lands as Israel’s inheritance. Conquering and dividing the land was the portion of Yehoshua. Corresponding to this, Yehoshua also apprehended some of Moshe Rabeynu’s portion. This very verse in question is formulated exactly in the way God spoke to Moshe, saying, “God spoke unto Yehoshua, saying: Speak to the children of Israel.” This matter is explained in the Gemara in the chapter, “how do you define the city limits” (<i>Eruvin</i>, 52b). “With several houses in a row, if one house stands outside the line and another on the inside, or in a wall, if one turret protrudes outside of the wall and another recedes.” This is discussing the interconnection of souls. “One house is on the inside of the line and another is on the outside” hints at degrees and levels of good, where one enters it into another, and another to another, and in this way they connect.<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">This is kind of a spiritual representation in terms of good attributes of the geometric form described in the Gemara.</i> “One turret protrudes and another recedes” teaches of the opposite, for also one’s deficiencies can enter into another somewhat. The subject of why the cities of refuge are in the portion of Moshe is explained in the holy Zohar in <i>Parshat Mishpatim</i> (114b) on the verse, “and I have set aside a place for you.” “This is the commandment to set aside cities of refuge for one who killed was given to you because of the Egyptian that you killed in Egypt. He had the primordial snake and all its brood surrounding him. Then you killed him before his time, and did not fear his brood chasing after you. This was when several women in your youth had chased after you. Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, gave you the cities of refuge to flee to, and they are the gates of repentance.” So too was Yehoshua close to Avizraiu, who killed another inadvertently.<br/>Yehoshua had constantly yearned to understand the profundity of the Torah, and the true depth that he sought could not be achieved during the lifetime of Moshe Rabeynu. By means of his great exertion, yearning, and prayer, he managed to effect the death of Moshe Rabeynu. When Moshe Rabeynu realized this, then God illuminated into Moshe Rabeynu that he himself should plead for mercy on behalf of Yehoshua, for Moshe also greatly desired the welfare of Yehoshua, and then of itself Yehoshua could not do anything against the life of Moshe. We find this in the Torah when Moshe prayed for Yehoshua. Because of the great bewilderment that Moshe Rabeynu experienced when he understood this, the Holy One, blessed be He, illuminated this understanding into Moshe (to pray for his welfare). So it was that all the Torah that was revealed to Moshe Rabeynu was revealed to him as a result of great bewilderment that the blessed God had sent him, and it was all necessary for him."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Prophets, I Samuel 1",
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Prophets, I Samuel 2","<i>“And Shaul said nothing on that day, for he said, something has happened, he is not clean, behold he is not clean.”</i> (Shmuel 1, 20:26)<br/>The word <i>ci</i>, “because of,” in this verse is understood in the sense of “for behold.”<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">The word <i>ki</i> has four different meanings in Scripture.</i> This usage gives an explanation as to why this verse was said. Shaul asserted that he understood his own nature at its root, and that he was deficient in this capacity (purity). The blessed God had entrusted the storehouse of purity to this tribe (Yehuda); therefore their dealings and affairs were constantly involved in refining this aspect. This is seen in the incidents with Tamar, who was the progenitor of the Royal Davidic line, as is explained in its place (Mei HaShiloach, <i>Parshat Vayeishev</i>, on the verse, “and Er”). So too with Bat Sheva and the daughter of Pharaoh. The Blessed God clarified all of their actions, and made it clear that it was all God’s doing. (Like the statement of the Gemara, when Yehuda said of Tamar, “She is more righteous than I [<i>mimeni</i>],” that this was God saying, “the entire incident came forth from Me [<i>mimeni</i>].”) Thus the stone representing Yehuda in the High Priest’s breastplate, the <i>Choshen Mishpat</i>, was the <i>nofech</i>, or carbuncle.<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">The breastplate was adorned with twelve stones, and each one represented one of the tribes of Israel. See Sefer <i>Shemot, Parshat Tetsave</i>, for a full explanation.</i> The numerical equivalent of the three letters in <i>nofech</i> (<i>nun</i> = 50, <i>peh</i> = 80, <i>chaf</i> = 20) is 150. David haMelech thus included 150 chapters in the book of Tehillim. The letter and number <i>nun</i>, fifty, teaches of purity.<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">See the Meor Einim of Reb Menachem Nachum of Chernobel, <i>zts’l</i>, in <i>Parshat Nasso</i>, where he says that the first forty-nine gates in <i>Binah</i>–Understanding are the repository for all the severe judgments, <i>dinim</i>, in the world, and the fiftieth gate is the great mercy that sweetens them all. Also the “Mekor Mayim Chaiim,” the commentary from the teachings of Reb Yitsik Eisik of Komarno <i>zts’l</i> on the “Sefer Baal Shem Tov,” says on the first verse in the book of <i>Vayikra</i> that “sick,” <i>chole</i>, is the numerical equivalent of forty-nine, wheres healing comes from adding the one to reach the fiftieth gate. This is the small <i>aleph</i> in the word <i>Vayikra</i>, which the Baal Shem Tov <i>zts’l</i> says is the source of all healing. Furthermore, the fifty days from Passover to Shevuot are a process of national cleansing of the spirit of Israel, where we must be completely pure for the “wedding” on the fiftieth day, which is the festival of Shevuot.</i> Thus three times <i>nun</i>, fifty, 150, represents the absolute completeness of purity (as anything done three times represents completeness). Shlomo haMelech had fashioned the brass laver used to wash the hands and feet of the <i>Cohanim</i> in the Holy Temple, called the <i>yam</i> [sea] <i>hanechoshet</i>, which contained exactly 150 <i>mikvot</i> or ritual baths (<i>Eruvin</i>, 14a).<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">First of all, the sea, as was the name of the laver, is called a <i>mikveh</i>, ritual bath, used for purification. Then also, 150 plus one is the numerical equvalent of the word, <i>mikve, mem</i> = 40, <i>qoof</i> = 100, <i>vav</i> = 6, <i>hei</i> = 5.</i> Furthermore, Shlomo haMelech composed the books of Mishlei (Proverbs), Shir haShirim (Canticles), and Kohellet (Ecclesiastes), which total fifty chapters, aside from the last chapter in Mishlei, which is the <i>Parsha</i> of <i>Eishet Chayil</i>, the “Woman of Valor.”"

Truly, he knew the strength of David haMelech, which was to arouse great Divine compassion through his prayer. Thus he said specifically, “twelve thousand,” in thinking that when confronted with this number, David would trust in the strength of his own prayer, and not make special efforts to increase his prayer. Then, Achitophel assumed, he could conquer David, because of the weakness of David’s sin, which Achitophel had publicized. This is as it is written in the Gemara (<i>Sanhedrin</i>, 44b), “A sin which is not made known can be easily rectified. A sin which is revealed is difficult to rectify.”"

Then when his heart was aroused to take Avishag the Shunamite he assumed that it was surely from the will of the blessed God that the kingdom was his, and with it her. From this, he elevated himself in saying, “I will rule.” Therefore when it was sent to Shlomo haMelech to give Avishag to Adoniya, Shlomo had understood in his wisdom that surely Adoniya would not harbor any strange lusts, but only that which he had seized in his mind that even the right to rule was his. This is why Shlomo answered (Melachim 1, 2:22), “why do you ask him just for Avishag? Ask him also for the kingdom.” Then Shlomo saw that in the depth of Adoniya’s heart he was rebelling against the kingdom, and this swore, “as God lives … just as I am king, so shall Adoniya on this day be put to death.” The desire for Avishag had really come to him from his desire for rulership."

If not, then He will remove the desire from him, and he will no longer desire this and ask for its materialization through his prayer."

Menashe possessed the greatest level of fear, and all the sins that he had transgressed were only because he was pleading with God for advice as to how to remove this state of fear from upon him, in order that he could operate with free choice. This is because such an overpowering state of fear in man causes the removal of his power of free choice. It was decreed from heaven that he was born into such great fear, which is the opposite of David haMelech, whose dominant characteristic was that of the love of God.

Here it is apparent that we are essential partners with God in this process, through our own active confession and rectification of our sins through the lifelong process of <i>tshuva</i>.</i> All the while that there is a residue of sin at the root a veil remains that separates us from God. “And take good” means that God shall take our hearts for the good in order for the love and fear of God to be fixed in our hearts.<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">“Taking” is a kind of permanent installment.</i> “The utterance of our lips shall take the place of bulls” means that all that we speak will be refined.

"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Prophets, Hosea 3","<i>“Ashur will not save us, we will not ride upon horses. We will no longer call the work of our hands, ‘our god.’ Only through you will mercy be aroused for the orphan.”</i> (Hoshea, 14:4)<br/>“Ashur [Assyria],” represents brazen strength (<i>tekifut</i>) and the power of flesh and blood. This is the <i>kelipa</i> (evil force) of Ashur, strong in itself, and we will no longer rely on our own human strength. “We will not ride on horses.” “Horse” represents being overly hasty and acting in a haphazard state without a settled mind. “The rider of the horse” represents a settled consciousness, which itself is not good at times, as is explained below. “We will no longer call the work of our hands, ‘our god’” is saying that we will no longer put our trust in silver and gold. “Through you shall the orphan find mercy” means one who has no support or assistance, for we shall not find any support outside of You—You shall be our sole reliance.<br/>A settled mind is called constant, and with such a manner it is always good to act. Acting quickly is called <i>mequdash</i>, sanctified, for sometimes quickness of action is a very good quality. It is such when one chooses to run to a matter of the words of Torah even if he does not yet know what he is running to, but still it is very good. On this, Shlomo haMelech said (Mishlei, 21:31), “The horse is ready for the day of battle, and salvation is up to Hashem.” This means that in the end the blessed God will save him and show him that his running to understand the truth of the words of Torah was in good judgment. This was the sin of the prophet Hoshea who said (<i>Pesachim</i>, 87a), “exchange them [Israel] for a different people.”<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">It is written in <i>Pesachim</i>, 87a: “The Holy One, blessed be He said to Hoshea, ‘Your children have sinned,’ to which he should have replied, ‘They are Your children, they are the children of Your beloved ones, they are the children of Avraham, Yitschok, and Yaakov. Show them Your mercy.’ It was not enough that he did not say this, but he said to Him: ‘Master of the Universe! The whole world is yours. Exchange them for a different people. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘What shall I do with this old man [who does not know how to defend his people]? I will order him: ‘Go and marry a whore and raise children of whoredom’; and then I will order him: ‘Send her away from your presence.’ If he will be able to send her away, then I too will send Israel away.’ For it is said, And the Lord said unto Hoshea, ‘Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredom and children of whoredom,’ and it is written, ‘So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Divlaim.’”</i> Hoshea said this out of the power of a settled mind. Then, after he realized that he had sinned, he said (Hoshea, 14:4), “we will not ride upon horses,” meaning that sometimes a mind that constantly exercises restraint is not always good. Therefore we must only rely upon Hashem and not on our intellect."

"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Psalms 2","<i>“Fortunate is the man who does not walk in the advice of the evil ones, and in the way of sinners does not stand, and in the dwelling place of scoffers does not sit. But rather the Torah of Hashem is his desire, and he contemplates His Torah day and night … he shall be as a tree sated by streams of water, his leaf shall not wither, and all he does be made to succeed.”</i> (Tehillim,1)<br/>“Advice” means thought. The term “advice” mentioned in this verse teaches of thought, meaning that he does not use his power of thought to entertain the thoughts of evil. “In the way of sinners he does not stand”—“sin” refers to inadvertent sins. Thus, if he had erred by sinning without his conscious intent, inadvertently, then he does not “stand” in this state, but immediately acts to correct that which he has perverted. “And in the dwelling place of scoffers he does not sit.” “Scoffer” or <i>letz</i> in Hebrew, is one who is not currently transgressing any law. Rather, he does not care to conduct himself within the boundaries that protect the law; the “fences” of the sages who codified the law, which guard one from later transgressing the body of the law as it was ordained in the Torah. They are scoffing at the words of the sages, considering themselves “sitting comfortably,” without fear that they may come to sin.<br/>Their danger is greater than the first example, the “advice of the evil ones,” who, conversely, will surely come to many errors (and expect this). The three levels mentioned here, “the advice of the evil ones,” “the way of the sinners,” and “the dwelling place of the scoffers,” are three levels of advice for man to be “turning from evil” (see Tehillim, 34:15). Corresponding to these three, there are three levels of “do good” (Tehillim, 34:15). “And his desire is in the Torah, for in the His Torah does he contemplate day and night,” is the opposite of “the advice of evil ones.” “He shall be as a tree sated by streams of water, whose leaf will not wither” means that he strives to increase his amount of Torah understanding and good conduct, which is the opposite of the “way of sinners,” whose way is filled with mistakes and forgetfulness. “All that he does shall be made to succeed”—“succeed” is not written, but rather “made to succeed,” meaning that the blessed God will cause his actions to succeed in a way that is above his intellect or intentions. This corresponds to the “dwelling place of scoffers.” It is the opposite because he deliberately increases borders and fences around his fulfillment of the law in order to protect it, and in this way he makes it possible for him to fulfill all of the words of Torah and <i>mitzvot</i>. By means of this the blessed God causes his actions to succeed in a way that is above his intellect and intentions.<br/>“Lamnatseach—<i>A song of the one who is victorious</i>, al haNechilot—<i>on the</i> Nechilot <i>[an instrument]</i>.” (Tehillim, 5:1)<br/>The Aramaic translation of “on the <i>Nechilot</i>,” is “<i>l’shabcha al chignin</i>.” This means “to offer praises at the dance festival, or fair.”<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Chigna</i>, like <i>Nechilot</i> is also the name of a musical instrument.</i> This refers to one who shouts out with an intense cry. <i>Chigna</i>, is actually the bell of suffering, for when one who suffers cries out, all of his desire is that God hear his cry. This is as the verses continue, “Lend an ear to my words, God, understand my thoughts. Listen deeply to the voice of my shouts, my King, E-lohai, my God, for it is to You I pray. In the morning You shall hear my voice.” “Listen deeply to the voice of my shouts, my King and God”—“my King” because the blessed God loves me, and “E-lohai, my God” because he is my stronghold.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">The particular name of God, <i>E-loha</i> denotes strength.</i> “In the morning God will hear my voice, in the morning I will arrange my plea before You.” “Morning” teaches of the first rays of sunlight at dawn, and the renewed blossoming of the light of day. So, too, the very first emergence of will in the heart of man before it spreads forth is called “morning.”<br/>At this moment, while the thought has still just newly emerged, he asks the blessed God that the thought or desire not spread to a place against God’s will. “For You are not a God who desires evil, nor shall evil dwell with You” can be understood through the Midrash Ta’azria on the <i>Parsha</i> of <i>nega’im</i> (afflictions) (Tanchuma 7), “why does it not say here, ‘Speak to the children of Israel [in <i>Vayikra</i>, 13:1]’? For it is the nature of God that, ‘no evil—ya<i>GOR</i>cha—shall dwell with You,’ meaning no evil does not lead—<i>GORER</i>et—Him along.” Israel represents intense cleaving to the blessed God. Thus it says, “for You are not a God who desires evil,” to give a meaning for one’s act of prayer, for truly the very first emergence of the desire to pray has come from the blessed God, and therefore no evil could come of it. However, he fears that from this point on it could spread to a place of evil. Therefore he causes an intense stir in his prayer for God to be with him to help when the thoughts and desires begin to spread out into the world, helping the effects of the desire to be clean even from an inkling of thought against God’s will. Then it will follow that all his actions will be pure."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Psalms 3","<i>“I have set God before me always ….”</i> (Tehillim, 16:8)<br/>When a man greatly yearns for something, he should see that the object of his desire is the will of the blessed God.

And You have made it quite clear which ways are outside the bounds of Your law, and it is within the power of man to guard himself within these boundaries. I have been careful to guard myself concerning all of this, yet my prayer before You is, ‘please support my steps on Your way.’” The word for “Your way” is <i>ma’agloteicha</i>, from the word for circle, <i>ma’agal</i>. This implies a circuitous way, a path from the side that not everyone knows.<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">Kind of a “road less taken,” in the <i>Avodat Hashem</i>.</i> Thus he prays that the blessed God illuminate his eyes to travel on the less-known path."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Psalms 5","<i>“God, in Your strength the king will rejoice, and he will greatly delight in Your salvation.”</i> (Tehillim, 21:2)<br/>“Strength” signifies words of Torah. “The king will rejoice”—“the king” is the Torah scholar, for “the rabbis are the vessel of kings.” The Torah gives him strength to stand against and conquer the entire world. This is “the king will rejoice.” “He will greatly rejoice in Your salvation,” however, represents a place where there is a deficiency from his birth, from his very inception, as it is written (Yeshaya, 48:8), “you are called a criminal from the womb.” He then needs salvation from the blessed God to renew his life and heal the events of the past.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">See the Mei HaShiloach, <i>Parshat Vayeilech</i>, first selection, for more on this idea.</i> This is called salvation, <i>yeshua</i>, in Hebrew, for without it he stands in perplexity. This is “in Your salvation,” meaning that if he merits salvation then his deficiency will be healed, and then “he will greatly delight.”"
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Psalms 6","<i>“He lies me down in green pastures.”</i> (Tehillim, 23:2)<br/>When an ox stands in a fertile pasture, then his power of vision is complete and his whole existence and means of sustenance is ready before him. In this way David haMelech asked that the effluence of the blessed God will always be with Israel, and it will even be accessible everywhere their mind’s eye takes them. “He leads me by waters of rest” is to say that there shall be a good connection with a good eye between every member of Israel and his fellow, and this being so, man is at rest."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Psalms 7","<i>“Save me from all my transgressions, do not place upon me the shame of the boorish.”</i> (Tehillim, 39:9)<br/>“Transgression” is the deficiency imprinted on man from his mother’s womb. This is as it is written (Tehillim, 51:7), “and my mother conceived me in sin.” This is not, however, an obligation from the side of man, for the blessed God will conduct everything in a way that all will have been for the good of Israel, and even the sinners will have been refined for the good. But still, it is not clear to us now, and at first glance there are great accusations from the nations against Israel. Therefore it says, “save me from all transgressions.”<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">This whole idea centers around the guilt we bear for our indiscretions. However, with the consciousness of redemption we can see that it is not even in our power to rectify sin, and our eyes are turned only to the blessed God to complete the process of refinement. This consciousness is, however, hidden from us, for we need to feel as if our own choices and actions effect the <i>tikkun</i>, repair of the soul. Then it is called “the work of our hands.” See the citation in the previous note, and see the second selection in <i>Parshat Devarim</i> for a connected idea.</i><br/>“You have voluntarily scattered a torrent of rain, O God, you have established Your inheritance for Your weary people.” (Tehillim, 68:10; see S. R. Hirsh’s translation, “Thou didst lavish a torrent of bounty, O God; Thou didst first prepare Thy inheritance, a [people] weary of their fate.”)<br/>“You have voluntarily scattered a torrent of rain, O God” is the strength that the blessed God gives Israel to withstand all they must suffer from the nations. This is, “Your inheritance for Your weary people,” means that Israel’s ability to suffer and remain silent comes from the great and brazen strength (<i>tekifut</i>), which comes from knowing that surely God will not forsake them, and it is all good for them, yet still they are weary. Thus it says, “You have established,” for they may take some consolation from the fact that God had established all they are enduring in order that all the good of the nations may then be entered into Israel in a state of <i>Kedusha</i> (holiness)."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Psalms 8","<i>“And as for me, my prayer to you, O God, is to receive a moment of the consciousness of Your will ….”</i> (Tehillim, 69:14)<br/>At times man feels the great desire and will to ask of God and His power. At this time one must greatly exert himself in prayer and ask God to permanently illuminate this will into him for all time. This is as David haMelech asked of the blessed God the willingness of the heart of Israel to build the <i>Beit Hamikdash</i>, the Holy Temple. He then said (Divrei haYamim 1, 29:18), “keep this forever in the creations and thoughts of Your people.” He asked that this consciousness never be disconnected from them. This is the meaning of the phrase in the Gemara (<i>Yevamot</i>, 72a), “a time of God’s will is essential.”"
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Psalms 9","<i>“E-lohim, You have taught me from my youth, and even today I will tell of Your wonders. Even in my old age and gray hair, E-lohim, do not abandon me ….”</i> (Tehillim, 71:17–18)<br/>Man needs to investigate and understand even from the days of his youth what it is that causes his lust to overpower him and distance his heart from God. From this he may infer which matters the blessed God has prepared for him through which to test him and through which he will be refined. Concerning this matter he must strengthen himself and remain vigilant, for the blessed God has allotted to every man something unique through which he will be refined. Thus one has to know clearly the particular way in which he will be refined, and he may begin to contemplate this even in the days of his youth. This is essential, for if he does not know what it is, when he is suddenly overcome by his evil inclination, he will then be jostled to many sides, not knowing which one is particularly relevant to him. This is “E-lohim has taught me from my youth,” for even in one’s youth he can come to a clear understanding of what his particular way of refinement will be, and then “even in my old age and gray hair E-lohim has not abandoned me.”"
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Psalms 10","<i>“For Shlomo. O God, give your judgments to the king … may the righteous flourish in his days, and great peace until the moon withers.”</i> (Tehillim, 72:1,7)<br/>“The moon” represents the renewal of the light of the <i>Ein Sof</i>, the Infinite, may He be blessed, and in the future the blessed God will all original Torah insights and secrets, and there will be no concealment. This is the meaning of the verse (Tehillim, 85:8), “O God, show us your mercies,” meaning that the blessed God will clearly reveal His mercies and there will no longer be the need for the renewal of salvation. Rather it will be within our power to effect salvation by means of the revealed light of His mercies, and there will be no concealment. This is, “until the moon withers away.”<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">God’s light will be so clear that no other light will be necessary. The moon also represents a light that is sometimes revealed and sometimes hidden. In the future there will be no hidden light.</i>"
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Psalms 11","<i>“Blast the</i> Shofar <i>in the month [Elul], in the covering of the day of our festival [Rosh Hashanah, the only festival on a new moon]. For it is a statute for Israel, a judgment from the God of Yaakov.”</i> (Tehillim, 81:4–5)<br/>It is written in the Gemara (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, 25b), “At what time is it called a <i>Choq</i>, a ‘statute?’ At the completion of the court case.” In the month of Elul there is a depth of the fear of God far greater than may be measured. <i>Choq</i>, or “statute,” mentioned in the verse in connection with Elul, teaches of something that has reached its completion, meaning at its root there is no judgment, for it is a statute, “engraved” in stone.<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">The word for statute, <i>choq</i>, is closely related to the word for engrave, <i>choqeq</i>. In this sense there is “no judgment,” for it is already “carved in stone,” whereas “judgment” implies that it could be judged either favorably or not.</i> Yet with something that we see is permanent, with the blessed God it is still in judgment, and so it is with every pending case in the world, “who shall live, and who shall die” [it is all hanging in judgment]. And so too with all of the desires and wills in the world, where this one chooses something that appears as life, and the other one something that appears as something else, when really at the root and source of life it is all fixed, “carved in stone,” and there is no one who will not choose it in this way. Even this immutable reality is still in judgment with the blessed God, as it is written (Yirmiya, 33:25), “If my covenant did not endure day and night, then I have not enacted the statutes of the heaven and earth.”"
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Psalms 12","<i>“I will hear what God will speak, for He will speak of peace for His people and those who love him.”</i> (Tehillim, 85:9)<br/>This means that David haMelech lent his ear to hear what God was saying to Himself, and he heard that God’s only desire is the betterment of Israel. For at the time when God spoke to him, He spoke of the welfare of Israel. Yet David haMelech wanted to know what God was occupied with in His own thoughts, and he heard that there too God was speaking of the peace of his people and those who love Him."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Psalms 13","<i>“A psalm, a song for the day of Shabbat. It is good to thank God, to sing to His supernal name … How great are Your works, O God, how greatly profound Your thoughts! … a boor does not know, and a fool cannot understand this ….”</i> (Tehillim, 92)<br/>This psalm explains how it is impossible for any man to have any kind of claim against the blessed God. This is explained by the holy Rambam (Maimonides) in the fifth chapter of the laws of returning to the way of God (<i>tshuva</i>). These are his pure words: “Perhaps you would say, ‘Does not God know all that will come to be? Before someone comes into being He knows that this one will be either righteous or wicked.’ If you shall say, ‘If God already knows that he will be righteous, then it is impossible that he will not be righteous.’ And if you say that He knows that this one will be righteous, and it could be that he turns out to be wicked, then He does not know the matter clearly.” According to this, it is within the power of a wicked man to acquit himself from judgment, and also the righteous does not have so much merit, or he would not believe, God forbid, that God knows everything. Therefore David haMelech explained this dilemma in this psalm, saying, “how great are Your works, O God, so profound are your thoughts, a boor cannot know.” Seen in our human understanding his words are wondrous, describing the blessed God as it were in His greatness and the profundity of His thoughts, which a fool will not apprehend and a boor will not understand. However, it would be proper to say that even the sages and geniuses of the world do not know such matters, because God’s intellect is hidden from any human cognizance. This is as it is written (Yeshayahu, 55:8), “for My thoughts are not your thoughts.” Also it is as Eliyahu the prophet described in his prayer (Tikkunei Zohar 17a, “Patach Eliyahu”), “You are Wise, but not with a known form of wisdom, no thought may apprehend you at all.”<br/>Yet this is the intention of David haMelech with these words, where truly, the sages and believers will not in such ways question the intentions of the blessed God, heaven forfend. They know that they cannot reach an understanding of the preciousness of His profundity. They know the greatness of His thoughts, and the vastness of His actions. It says, “a boor cannot know,” to show how a boor cannot know the profundity of His thoughts, and therefore will raise objections and claims against the ways of the blessed God, as we have explained. This is the explanation of the verse that follows in this psalm, “when the wicked flourish like the grass, and doers of iniquity spring up, it is so they may be destroyed for ever, but You are exulted forever.”<br/>That is, that with all the flourishing of the wicked like the grass and the emergence of the iniquitous, the appearance in creation was only to be destroyed forever, and they were only created in order to benefit the righteous. If so, then they have no claim whatsoever, since the whole point of their being alive was only for this, and at their root they have no more life. This is just as the claim that the nations will bring against the blessed God in the future. “All hidden things are revealed before You. You effused into us an effluence a good spirit and lowered Your people Israel into exile under our hands. These actions of Yours caused an arousal in our hearts to destroy Your people. Then from this, when we act with iniquity, the strength of Israel is then raised. But why are we guilty of this? This sin is not ours!” This is as it is said, “when the wicked flourish … to destroy them forever.” Corresponding to this it says, “and You are exulted, O God,” for truly You are Supernal, an no element of creation can have any form of claim against You, and all Your judgments against us are just."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Psalms 14","<i>“For behold, Your enemies, O God, behold Your enemies are destroyed, all doers of iniquity will be scattered.”</i> (Tehillim, 92)<br/>This is because all the nations of the world are Your enemies, therefore they have no form of life at their root. Truly all that exists is the will of the blessed God, and nothing exists outside of Him. Since they oppose His will, they have no life at their source, yet for the present moment their existence is still the will of the blessed God in order that by means of them Israel will be greatly elevated. However, in their essence, God has no use for them. If so, when they will be destroyed, they will be able to claim injustice in that they shall be lost completely and Israel will inherit all their good. For how has He acted with them until then? He has bestowed goodness unto them all their days and they have received all effluences of good. And in that no remnant will remain from them is because they never possessed within them any eternal life, for they were only created for Israel’s benefit. In their time they will be destroyed, for they despise Israel and the blessed God, and Israel will inherit all their good."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Psalms 15","<i>“Let us go and sing joyously to God, and exult in the Rock of our salvation.”</i> (Tehillim, 95:1)<br/>“Let us go and sing joyously to God” means together with the nations of the world, for the blessed God anyhow gives them life and existence. For this, they too must sing joyously. But with us, His people Israel “exult in the Rock of our salvation” with “trumpets and the blast of the <i>Shofar</i>,” with intense joy of heart that flows from the deepest place in the heart. This is likened to a parable about a king who makes a wedding feast for his son. He invites all kinds of guests to the feast and honors them with food and drink. The joy of the guests is because of the feast that he made for them, and with which he honored them. But the joy of his son is joy from the deepest essence."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Psalms 16","<i>“When God reigns, the nations will tremble.”</i> (Tehillim, 99:1)<br/>When God’s will shall be to reveal the glory of His sovereignty and bring salvation to Israel, since He is their King and they are His people, then the nations will feel this and be filled with trembling and anguish because of Israel. They will then pass decrees over them."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Psalms 17","<i>“Fortunate is the man who fears God, and greatly desires His commandments.”</i> (Tehillim, 112:1)<br/>This means that the blessed God greatly desires the fulfillment of the commandments and the ethical behavior of those who fear Him."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Psalms 18","<i>“I will wake up at midnight to give thanks to You ….”</i> (Tehillim, 119:62)<br/>It is written in the holy Zohar (<i>Vayikra</i>, 23b), “whoever studies Torah at midnight, then the Torah makes his sin known to him, but not in the way of <i>din</i> [severe judgment. It is rather as a mother who makes it known to her son with soft words, and he does not forget it, and returns in <i>tshuva</i> {repentance}].” “Midnight” means when the evil inclination still has power over man, and he gets up to serve God. Even though his inclination to evil struggles to subdue him, he overcomes it and trusts in God. In this way, “the Torah makes his sin known, but not in the way of severe judgment.”"
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Psalms 19","<i>“Song of Ascents. When God returns the captives of Zion, we will have been as dreamers … Then they will say among the nations, God has done greatness with us, we will be filled with joy.”</i> (Tehillim, 126)<br/>In this light it is written in the Midrash (Sochar Tov, 9), “every place that mentions ‘poor’ or ‘downtrodden’ is speaking only of Israel.” Truly, in this world, all the powers of Israel are small, whether in wisdom, or wealth, or might. They have only simple life, and the desire for the increase of simple life from the blessed God free from any outside appearances. To this the nations of the world will say in the future, “God has done greatness with these,” meaning that the blessed God bestowed all Divine influence to Israel. “God has done greatness with us, we will be filled with joy.” This is saying that even if we had been filled with all manner of goodness from our youth, with power that is great in everything, yet still, if the Holy One, blessed be He, had done this with us, we would also be filled with joy in the future. There is no comparison whatsoever between the good that Israel has now, and that which the Holy One, blessed be He, will do for Israel in the future. Nonetheless, the children of Israel must rejoice!"
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Psalms 20","<i>“A song of Ascents. God has not made my heart haughty … like a child weaned from its mother’s breast, so with me is my soul weaned.”</i> (Tehillim, 131)<br/>David haMelech said before the blessed God that regardless of all the sins of Israel they were not once separated from the blessed God. They were rather like a baby separated from his mother’s breast, where even when he turns his face from his mother to take something, he then returns his face to his mother so she should not go away from him. So it is with Israel, in every place where they seek good, their eyes are on the blessed God so He should not turn away from them. This is as it is written in the Gemara (Beitsa, 11a), “when a young bird falls, it never falls far from the nest.” <i>Kenneset Yisrael</i>, the entire community of Israel, is compared to a young bird, as is known (<i>Shabbat</i>, 49a)."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Psalms 21","<i>“If I go up to heaven, there You are. And if I descend into hell, Behold, You are there.”</i> (Tehillim, 139:8)<br/>“If I go up to heaven” teaches of a time when You raise me up in a state of spiritual elevation with good effluence and the intellect rules over me. “There you are,” this is clear to me. This is as it is written (Divrei haYamim 1, 29:14), “all things have come from You, from Your own hand have we given to You.” “If I descend into hell” means even at a time when my intellect is constricted, then too, my desire is to know that You are the One, and the power is in Your hands. This is, “behold, You are there.”"
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Psalms 22","<i>“… the meek will be adorned in salvation.”</i> (Tehillim, 149:4)<br/>The meek does not boast in himself. His only pride is at the time that the blessed God brings him salvation."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 1",
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 2","<i>“How long will you fools love your folly, and the scoffers covet their derision?”</i> (Mishlei, 1:22)<br/>A fool is a man whose mind is easily cluttered with folly. This is said even of words of Torah, where a man fools himself in being satisfied with a simple meaning, and does not enter further into their profundity. On this it is said, “and the scoffers covet their derision,” where the meaning is the opposite, for when a man does not even consider the simple meaning of the verses in the Torah he is called a “scoffer.” This is the way of scoffers who covet their derision (of the simple meaning)."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 3","<i>“My son, if you take My word, and My commandments you conceal within you, to lend your ear to wisdom … if you seek it like silver and precious things … then you will understand … and you will find the consciousness of God.”</i> (Mishlei, 2:1–5)<br/>When it first says “to lend your ear to wisdom,” it is said as a command. Then after, it says “if you seek” (as a possibility). It is in the power of man to lend an ear to wisdom and incline the heart to understanding. However, to “seek it like silver,” meaning that the words of Torah will be so precious in man’s mind that he runs after them just as one would run after money and precious things, is not in man’s power, but happens only when he is helped by the blessed God. If words of Torah are so important to him, this is a sign for him that his heart is refined and he possesses the fear of God."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 4","<i>“Mercy and Truth will not abandon you ….”</i> (Mishlei, 3:3)<br/>The verse is not formulated “do not abandon Mercy and Truth,” for truly the effluence of the blessed God descends constantly without interruption. Only man, from his side, needs to refine his heart and stand ready to receive, and not turn his back on this effluence, God forbid. But in His goodness the blessed God constantly effuses His effluence, and the man who longs for His Mercies shall not forsake them."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 5","<i>“And find grace and good understanding in the eyes of God and man. Trust in God with all your heart and do not rely upon your own understanding. Know Him in all your ways, and He shall lead you on upright paths. Do not be clever in your own estimation, and turn away from evil.”</i> (Mishlei, 3:3–7)<br/>There is great significance in the juxtaposition of these two verses. “Find grace and good understanding” tells man to see to it that his actions should gain him grace and honor in the eyes of his fellow man. But if he wants to strive with all of his power to be adorned in the eyes of his fellow man, then “trust in God with all your heart and do not rely upon your own understanding.” This means not to trust the understanding of your own heart as if you know what will gain grace in their eyes and what will not. Rather, “know Him in all your ways,” and incline all of your intentions for the sake of Heaven, that all of your ways shall be in the will of the blessed God. “He shall lead you on upright paths,” meaning, if you go in the way of goodness, then you need not concern yourself that it gains grace in the eyes of your fellow, for the blessed God will anyway lead you on the upright path that will find grace in their eyes. But still, do not rely on this alone by going ahead and doing actions that are contrary to the sensibility of men, trusting in the knowledge that it is correct because he is righteous at his depths. On this it is said, “do not be clever in your own estimation, and turn away from evil.”"
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 6","<i>“It shall be healing to your navel ….”</i> (Mishlei, 3:8)<br/>It shall be healing to the root of the deficiency within the heart of man, from which expansions emerge to all sides. The source will be healed through words of Torah. Then of itself no residue of this deficiency will remain in the places to which it has branched out. This is because the main principle of man’s health is from his navel, as we find in the Gemara (<i>Sotah</i>, 45b)."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 7","<i>“For the mitzvah is a candle, and the Torah is light ….”</i> (Mishlei, 6:23)<br/>The Torah is likened to light because its light is very great, and the mitzvah to a candle as its light is small. However, there is an advantage to the candle over the great light, for the candle has the ability to reach into holes and crevices that the great light cannot. The Torah refines the whole man in general, yet in a place where he knows that he is deficient, there he needs the specific mitzvah whereby he can be strengthened in this aspect. This is as we find in the Gemara (<i>Shabbat</i>, 118b), “Concerning which mitzvah was your father most careful? He told him that it was the mitzvah of <i>tsitsit</i>.” He needed this particular mitzvah according to the understanding of where he was lacking, and could thereby replenish his lack."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 8","<i>“Does not wisdom cry out, and understanding … She stands by the way among the high places, by the place of the paths.”</i> (Mishlei, 8:1–2)<br/>“Among the high places” means at a time when man is still elevated above all the lusts of the world. Then wisdom arouses him, for “at the time of the inclination to evil, no one remembers the inclination to good” (<i>Nedarim</i>, 32b). Yet before he overpowers (the lusts of the world, the <i>yetser hara</i>), then “she cries out to it.” This is “among the high places.” “By the way” is after a man is helped to escape from something evil; “she stands in the place of the paths,” which is if a man can refine his heart so as not to desire that which is not the will of the blessed God. “She cries by the gates,” for since the blessed God created man in the world from a sense of honesty and fairness, so just as he gave man the power to desire everything, so too he gave him the power of wisdom to overcome this desire. “At the entrance to the city” means just as a man intends to do the will of God, “at the opening of doorways she cries.”"
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 9","<i>“For whosoever finds Me, finds life, and shall apprehend the will of God.”</i> (Mishlei, 8:38)<br/>The second word, “finds,” is written <i>motsai</i>, in the scroll of Mishlei, meaning as the first one, “finds Me life.” This is to show that he recognizes that life is with the blessed God. (Recognizing the life at the essence of God.) However, we traditionally read it <i>matsa</i>, or “he finds life,” meaning that the man who recognizes this will also find life and meaning in the words of Torah."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 10","<i>“The lips of the</i> Tsaddik <i>know Will and the lips of the wicked twist God’s words.”</i> (Mishlei, 10:32)<br/>This is like the words of our sages (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, 6a), “coerce him until he says, ‘I want to.’” This means, through his speech, the Will is also entered into his heart. This is “the lips of the <i>Tsaddik</i>,” meaning only what is spoken from the mouth and outward, since his heart is not yet refined. However, this (process of speaking) will help him to refine his heart to be drawn to Will with a complete heart. For example, when anger wells up in his heart against his friend, he knows and accepts that this is a deficiency. In this case he is advised to first speak kindly to his friend, and even though this is not with a willing heart, by means of the act of speaking in this way he will gradually change his very heart by inserting love where there was hate. This is “shall know Will,” for the term will means order. By means of his speech he will arrange the will until he inserts and installs it there with a complete and willing heart. This is as it is written (Tehillim, 104:18), “the sun knows it is going down.” This means that there is an order and constancy in the path of the sun that is not so with the moon, which sometimes follows a long path and sometimes a short path, as is written in the Gemara (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, 25a); see there."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 11","<i>“A man of kindness is good to his soul, but the cruel troubles his own flesh.”</i> (Mishlei, 11:17)<br/>This means to do acts of kindness and to do good things to his body. This is like the saying of Hillel (<i>Vayikra</i> Rabba, 34:3), “After Hillel had concluded his studies, he went walking, accompanied by his students. His students asked him, ‘where are you going?’ He said, ‘to do a mitzvah.’ ‘What mitzvah is that?’ they asked. ‘To go wash myself in the bathhouse,’ he answered. They asked how this was a mitzvah. He said, ‘look at the one who is appointed to wash and maintain the statues of kings they display in theaters and stadiums. The one who does this is not only paid, but is exulted in the company of the powerful. How much more so with me, who has been created in the image of God. Furthermore, it is written, ‘the man of kindness is good to his soul.’” All this is after he has refined himself, so as not to taste the bitter as sweet. Then if he finds that it is in his power to be good to his body and he prevents it (see Mishlei, 3:27), on this it is said, “the cruel one troubles his own flesh.” However, if he is not yet refined and he finds that he desires to cause his body delight, on this it says, “evil ones do acts of falsehood” (Mishlei, 11:18). In other words, it is not enough that what he is doing is not called bestowing kindness on his body, but the opposite; he turns it around and destroys his body by spoiling it with delights. This is, “acts of falsehood.” This is hinted at in the holy Zohar, which says (<i>Shemot</i>, 200a), “there are three points to the Torah.” This means that with every action, great or small, one must weight it on a kind of spiritual scale to see that it fits three criteria. First of all, it must be good for his body. This is as our sages said (<i>Pesachim</i>, 68b), “at the outset, when someone does something, he does it for himself.” Furthermore it should be good and honest in the ways of God. Also it must not cause harm to anyone else. After he sees that the action fits these three categories, he can do it, and it is called “a man of kindness is good to his soul.”"
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 12","<i>“The deceitful man does not roast that which he has taken from the hunt, but only what has been attained by perseverance is precious to man</i>.” (Mishlei, 12:27)<br/>This means, at the time when the man of deceit is about to cheat his fellow man, he does not burn to do it and prevents himself from cheating him. That is to say, he understands that his fellow man is right, but he has convinced himself that he is right about everything, and does not give any merit to his fellow man. Therefore he does not himself realize that it is his intention to cheat him. “Only what has been attained by perseverance is precious to man,” this means something valuable to a precious man is deficient in his eyes. This is because the word for perseverance, or diligent work, <i>charutz</i> in Hebrew, is related to the word <i>chareetz</i> or crack, meaning that the wealth is somehow “cracked” or deficient, even though it has been achieved in an honest way. Then when he emerges from the trial victorious over his fellow, it still does not sit well with him, and he constantly wonders that he is still somehow incomplete and perhaps harbors deceit within him."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 13","<i>“An unfulfilled promise makes the heart sick, and desire comes from the tree of life.”</i> (Mishlei, 13:12)<br/>“The tree of life” teaches of one who studies the Torah for the sake of Heaven. One who studies Torah for the sake of Heaven will see that none of his longings are deferred, but rather come immediately. “Desire comes” is expressed in the present tense, because it will always come to him immediately. This is as it is written (<i>Bereshit</i>, 29:6), “and his daughter Rachel comes.”"
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 14","<i>“Good understanding will give grace ….”</i> (Mishlei, 13:15)<br/>Indeed, “understanding” or “discernment” refers to a place where the judgment of one’s own understanding necessitates action. If so, what does grace received from his surroundings have to do with this, for such grace is received when one is forgiving? However, “good understanding will give grace” means that with good understanding and judgment one can actually sway the opinion of his fellow man, even if compared to his own understanding his fellow’s understanding seems to him to be the opposite. If one does not possess good judgment, then when he sees that his fellow man objects to his understanding, he will not sway his heart to understand as he does, and so too his fellow man will not find his understanding acceptable."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 15","<i>“… and the way of the iniquitous is difficult.”</i> (Mishlei, 13:15)<br/>“Difficult,” <i>eitan</i> in Hebrew, denotes brazenness and stubbornness, the opposite of good attributes. This is because his intellect objects to the characteristics of truth. In this way he strengthens himself in his brazenness and stubbornly continues to try to win over his fellow man."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 16","<i>“A righteous one eats to satisfy his soul, but the belly of the evil ones will be lacking.”</i> (Mishlei, 13:25)<br/>“A righteous one” is expressed in the singular, and “the evil ones” is expressed in the plural. This means that the <i>tsaddik</i> (righteous one) is very careful in how he eats, and finds it difficult to eat in a gathering that is not for the purpose of a mitzvah (i.e., Shabbat, a wedding, etc.). This is as it is said in the Gemara (<i>Sanhedrin</i>, 23a), “the pure-minded of Jerusalem would not sit down to a meal unless they knew with whom they were dining.” “The belly of the evil ones is lacking” means that the desire of the evil ones is to eat together in the company of the other such miscreants, but not at a gathering for a mitzvah. Therefore it reads (Mishlei, 12:26), “the righteous seek to cultivate others,” meaning if the gathering is for the purpose of a mitzvah then the <i>tsaddik</i> is increased in his goodness from the company of his friends. This is as our sages have said (<i>Berachot</i>, 63b), “a sword is on the enemies of the sages who sit alone and study separately and study Torah.”<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">This is an interpretation of Yirmiya 50:36, “a sword is on the lying sorcerers and they will become foolish.” “Sorcerers” <i>badim</i>, is like <i>bad bevad</i>, meaning “alone.”</i>"
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 17","<i>“A tongue which speaks softly is the tree of life, but one who perverts his speech is like a destructive wind.”</i> (Mishlei, 15:4)<br/>This can be understood by means of a parable. Two salesmen went to the market and sold their merchandise for a certain price. They met each other and asked, “how much did you profit from your sales?” One said a certain amount, and added, “I made a great profit.” The other said, “I charged even more than you, but I lost money!” The other answered him, “you fool! Your mistake was not in your sale here. Your mistake was only in your home. At home you invested much more in your merchandise than I did, and you cheated yourself at your home!” So it is also true with words of Torah. For truly, with words of Torah, “a soft tongue is the tree of life,” for it heals (“soft”—<i>marpe</i>, is similar to “healing”—<i>merape</i>) all of man’s deficiencies. However, “one who perverts his speech is like a destructive wind.” At times a man studies a great amount, but takes not profit from it, remaining as defunct as before. This is because of the “destructive wind,” which means literally “a break in the spirit.” That is to say, there are unrepaired deficiencies in the spirit of his life, in his brain, and in his heart. Therefore his words of Torah are of no use to him. He must go back to correct this deficiency of his that he has carried from his birth, and only then can bring words of Torah close to his heart."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 18","<i>“The world of loss and destruction are before God, and all the more the hearts of humankind.”</i> (Mishlei, 15:11)<br/>“The world of loss [<i>sheol</i>],” teaches of something that one has no cognizance of at first, but he has knowledge of it at the end. With “destruction,” he has no cognizance of it at the beginning or at the end. So if these two things are hidden from the hearts of humankind but revealed before the Holy One, blessed be He, then “all the more so the hearts of humankind.” That is, how much more so these things that are known to the hearts of mankind are revealed and known to the Holy One, blessed be He."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 19","<i>“Plans made without counsel are nullified, but when properly advised they will materialize.”</i> (Mishlei, 15:22)<br/>Sometimes a man plans to do something good, but when he goes to do it he has forgotten what his thoughts were. This is because they were “without counsel,” meaning that the matter was also not yet fixed in his heart, but the thought was only external. “But when properly advised” means after great efforts and counsel for the matter to also be installed in his heart, then “they will materialize,” meaning also come to fruition in action."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 20","<i>“Evil thoughts are an abomination to God, where pure thoughts please Him.”</i> (Mishlei, 15:26)<br/>Those thoughts that are evil and an abomination to the blessed God could even come to someone whose heart is clean and pure. Even if he says words that seem to be evil thoughts, still, when he speaks pleasant words his speech can prove that there is no evil in his thoughts. For instance, when Bathsheva presented to David haMelech (Melachim 1, 1) her request for the kingdom to pass to her son Shlomo, even though it was an evil thought to make plans for his successor and plan even when that would be (still in David’s lifetime), her words were pure when she said, “let the king live forever!” Then it was known that she was not, God forbid, anticipating when that time would come. Only when she said, “I and my son have sinned” was it made clear that her thoughts were pure, and through this she said words of pleasantness."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 21","<i>“See to it that all of your actions come about with reference to God, and your thoughts will be established.”</i> (Mishlei, 16:3)<br/>A man shall cast all of his actions to God, meaning that all the intentions of his actions are done for the glory of Heaven, and then his thoughts will be established. Then even if he cannot bring his intentions into action, nevertheless he will be strengthened from the blessed God and they will be established forever. We find this with David haMelech, who thought to build the Holy Temple even though he had been told that this endeavor was not in his portion, but rather for his son Shlomo. At first glance it seems that this thought was in vain. Nonetheless, the blessed God illuminated into him that it was well and good that this was in his heart, as it was the will of the blessed God that the first thought of the building of the Holy Temple would come to David haMelech, and the completion of the action be done by Shlomo."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 22","<i>“It is up to God to measure man’s actions on the scales of justice, all weights in the pocket for the scale are His work.”</i> (Mishlei, 16:11)<br/>“It is up to God to measure man’s actions on the scales of justice” means that all <i>mitzvot</i> and good actions are very precious in the eyes of the blessed God. However, “His work,” meaning whom God will choose, all are “weights for the scale.” This means an action that man made the effort to make happen. These are the “weights in the pocket,”<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">A great effort as opposed to a small effort, like a heavy or a light weight, will be equal to a similar reward on the other side of the scale.</i> or a place where he makes a greater effort. This is similar to Rashi’s explanation to the chapter, “if it gets dark while one is on the way” (<i>Shabbat</i>, 153a), on the necessity of entrusting his purse to a Gentile at the onset of Shabbat. The Gemara asks why this is taught concerning his money and not a valuable object he happened to find. Rashi answers that his money is something that he exerted himself to gain, and therefore would be more likely to want to keep it. Even the smallest of the small is willing to do a good action that does not require a monetary sacrifice. But when one is asked to exert himself and spend money, there you see all the difference in levels of people in the world."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 23","<i>“For the one of understanding, wisdom is before him, and the eyes of the fool are at the ends of the earth.”</i> (Mishlei, 17:24)<br/>With men of wisdom and understanding, even though they bring forth true wisdom and understanding, they do not boast of this. It seems to him a simple matter (for he knows there is so much more wisdom to attain), since all of his desires are only to receive a constant increase in wisdom. Yet “the eyes of the fool are at the ends of the earth,” for his folly is wisdom in his eyes, namely that he thinks he has already attained all of the levels of wisdom that are possible, even to “the ends of the earth.”"
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 24","<i>“One who is great in anger will take the punishment ….”</i> (Mishlei, 19:19)<br/>“Great” <i>godel</i> as it is traditionally read, is actually written in the scroll of Mishlei as <i>goral</i> “fate,” by changing the <i>reish</i> to a <i>dalet</i>. The meaning of the way it is written is “it is the fate of one who gets angry to receive punishment.” Thus one who spits vitrol from his lips unintentionally will also have to accept his punishment. To this our sages, who desire the betterment of Israel, established the verse to read <i>Godel Cheima</i>, “one who is great in anger,” meaning one who exaggerates the anger in his mind (but does not bring it out). This is a principle in every case in the Torah where a word is traditionally read differently from how it is written; the way that it is read always sweetens the way in which it is written."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 25","<i>“The desire of man is his mercy, and a poor man is better than a liar.”</i> (Mishlei, 19:22)<br/>The desire of man is the lust within his heart, and this is also from the kindness of the blessed God, for whoever is greater than his fellow, so too is his inclination to evil greater (<i>Succa</i>, 52a). If he enters the power of his lust and desire into <i>Kedusha</i> (holiness), then his greatness will increase all the more. So therefore, “a poor man is better than a liar,” because if he brings out his lusts into action in a strange place, he is then called “a liar,” for he is lying with his potential. Then the poor man, who was not created with such powerful lusts, is better than him, since he does not materialize it according to his needs."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 26","<i>“Advice in the heart of man are deep waters, and a man of understanding will bring it forth.”</i> (Mishlei, 20:5)<br/>There is precious value hidden in the heart of every soul of Israel, and within it is advice as to how to stand before his deficiency and overcome his evil inclination. A man of understanding is one who understands that he needs to complete the place that is lacking in his soul, and he will draw forth from the preciousness at his depths until he can stand against his evil inclination. This is as it is written in the Midrash (Shir Hashirim Rabba, 1:8), “It was like a deep well of clean, pure water, which no one could reach, until Shlomo haMelech came along, attaching rope to rope and strand to strand until he could draw up the water.”"
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 27","<i>“There is a fine treasure and oil in the dwelling place of the sage, but a foolish man will swallow it.”</i> (Mishlei, 21:20)<br/>“A fine treasure and oil in the place of the sage,” for all the words of Torah are a fine treasure for he who seeks to lend his ear and become wise from them. Yet “a foolish man” means one who looks into the words of Torah and sees his own inability to understand them, for in this area he is a fool, and is in great need of salvation from the words of Torah. Therefore when he hears words of Torah that connect with him, he swallows them into the depth of his every fiber of his being. This is as it is written in the Gemara (<i>Berachot</i>, 24b), “Rav Zeira said: I learned this incidentally in the house of Rav Hamnuna, and it is worth all the rest of my learning. It is a good sign to sneeze during the prayer, for just as one is relieved below, so too is their relief on high.” This is because Rav Zeira had sneezed during his prayer, and he feared greatly because he heard that it might be a bad sign. Yet when he learned the difference between a sneeze (above) and a sneeze (on high), his soul was restored in that he could realize his desire (and sneeze). Therefore it says specifically, “I learned incidentally,” <i>avla’ah</i> in Aramaic, spelled with the same letters as “swallowed,” <i>bala’a</i> for then he knew that he was complete from the outset."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 28","<i>“The heart of the king is like streams of water in the hands of God, wherever He desires he shall direct it.”</i> (Mishlei, 21:1)<br/>Sometimes man is in a situation where he does not know how to act or where to turn. On the one hand he should refrain from action, and on the other hand he needs to go ahead and act, as will be explained below. This is called “streams of water.” The words of Torah turn in two ways like a fork in a stream.<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Palgei mayim</i>, streams of water, comes directly from the word for division, <i>peleg</i>.</i> In this case one is advised to deliver his being over to the blessed God who will then illuminate into him what to do. This is “the heart of the king.” Man should then reign over his heart and deliver it over to God. If the blessed God does not illuminate the direction into him, God forbid, then he is advised in the next verse, “doing justice and judgment is more acceptable to God than sacrifices.” The verse does not say “go and do justice,” but rather is simply expressed in the present tense, “doing justice.” This means not to go ahead and perform the action, rather to sit and refrain from action, and this is in itself justice and the proper judgment, since he does not know in which way to act. This is “more acceptable to God than sacrifices,” which represent going forth and acting. This is as we find with the dispute between Rabbi Eliezar and Rabbi Yehoshua in the tractate Zevachim (80a, discussing what to do if blood of a sacrifice that required four applications (sprinklings) on the altar were mixed with blood that only required one), “Rabbi Elazar said, if you added another application you then transgressed the commandment, ‘do not add,’”<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">Two of the 613 commandments are “do not add” to add a commandment not written in the Torah, and similarly, “do not diminish.”</i> and you have performed an action. “If you do not add another application you are transgressing, ‘do not diminish,’” and you have refrained from an action."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 29","<i>“Prepare your work at the outset, then plan out your field, and after this, build your house.”</i> (Mishlei, 24:27)<br/>“Prepare your work at the outset” means that at first one must take care to fulfill all of the commandments according to their simple meaning. This refers specifically from guarding all of the prohibitions of the Torah in order to “refrain from evil” (Tehillim, 34:15). “Then plan out your field.” “Field” represents expansion. This means to expand into the fences and borders of the law, all of the strictures of the sages, for it is known how many branches grow from the words of God. Then even the slightest hint of anger would be considered “do not kill,” and speaking excessively with one’s wife becomes “do not commit adultery.” This is as we find in the Gemara (<i>Eruvin</i>, 53b), “Rabbi Yossi the Galilean was once walking on the road, when he met Brurria, the famous wife of Rabbi Meir. He asked her, ‘which road goes to Lod?’ Brurria replied, ‘foolish Galilean! Did not the sages say that one should not speak excessively to women? You should have said, ‘which to Lod?’”<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">This passage of Gemara discusses how the Galileans were not precise with their language, but the Judeans were.</i> “Plan out your field,” as in preparing foundations, denotes endurance and strengthening, to make sure that the boundaries and fences act to support the root of the mitzvah. “And after, build your house” means that once you have grown in strength and vigor in your performance of the law, fenced in from all sides, then it is permitted to expand into all of your desires, and you will not need any boundaries. Therefore, in truth, Rabbi Yossi the Galilean did not transgress the injunction against speaking excessively to women, for he had already attained a state of completeness, and had no need of boundaries."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 30","<i>“Know well the face of your sheep ….”</i> (Mishlei, 27:23)<br/>“Sheep” teaches of drawing, as in, to draw energy, for it is the nature of sheep to be drawn to one another. Thus, “know well the face of your sheep” means to recognize the desires of your heart, to where they are inclined and drawn. This done, you will be able exercise due caution in any necessary situation, and know how to act."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 31","<i>“As water reflects the face, so is it with the heart of man.”</i> (Mishlei, 27:19)<br/>When a man looks into a still pool of water, the reflection faithfully shows what is there. Whether the reflection is ruddy or green, this is the appearance of the face. So it is with the heart of man within man. Just as a man inclines his heart to certain words of Torah, so will all of his body and limbs be drawn after the heart to act of their own accord, involuntarily, according to what is imprinted in the heart."
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 32","<i>“Vanity and falsehood, keep them away from me.”</i> (Mishlei, 30:8)<br/>“Vanity” is something useless that has no roots. It is of no use to man at all. “Falsehood” could be something that man needs, like a livelihood, yet it comes from a place that is not the will of God. This is the meaning of the term used for falsehood, <i>c’zav</i> in Hebrew, as in the verse (Yeshayahu, 58:11), “like a spring of water which does not fail [<i>lo yic’zavu</i>].”"
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 33","<i>“Three [matters] were too wondrous for me, and four I did not know. The way of the eagle in the heavens, the way of the snake by the rock, the way of the ship in the heart of the sea, the way of man with a young woman.”</i> (Mishlei, 30:18–19)<br/>“The eagle” teaches of impurity, because the eagle does not even have one sign of pure birds (<i>Chullin</i>, 61a; see Mei HaShiloach, “the outward signs of pure birds”) and it has all four signs of impurity. “Heavens” teaches of purity and clarity. This teaches that in everything that is pure, there is impurity that must be refined. “The way of the snake by the rock,” “rock” means brazen strength, in that man’s mind is vigorously resolved to go after the good way. “Snake” represents error, in that he could err. “The way of the ship in the heart of the sea” means that in proceeding with haste he shall exercise restraint. “The sea” represents being hasty in one’s desires, and thus in every panic he shall find calmness of mind. “The way of man with a young woman” “woman,” means concealment.<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">This is because, among other reasons, the word used for young woman, <i>alma</i>, uses the same letters as the word for concealment, <i>he’lem</i>.</i> “Man” means clear, apparent. This is to show how all concealment contains clarity. When Shlomo haMelech said (Kohollet, 1:13), “E-lohim gave a bad matter [<i>inyan</i>] to man,” he was referring to these four matters. Also the word for matter, <i>Inyan</i>, is an acronym for the names of these three matters in Hebrew. <i>Inyan</i> is spelled <i>ayin, nun, yud, nun</i>. <i>Ayin</i>—Alma [young woman].” “<i>Nun—Nesher</i> [eagle].” “<i>Yud</i>—Yam [sea].” “<i>Nun</i>—Nachash [snake].”"
"Mei HaShiloach, Volume I, Writings, Proverbs 34","<i>“The spider holds on with its hands, and it is in the chambers of the king.”</i> (Mishlei, 30:28)<br/>“Spider” (<i>shmamit</i>) teaches of anger and destruction (<i>shomema</i>). “Holds on with its hands” shows that the emergence of deficiency exists even with great people, for “the sages are the vessels of the kings.” And the sages, the leaders of thousands of Israel, have emerged from this to complete themselves, so as not to find this rooted in their hearts. So it was with Uziyah (see Divrei haYamim 2, Ch. 26), who went to burn incense in the innermost chamber of the Temple (but was prevented from this), for he wanted to perfect himself in this. All the while he knew that he was not complete in this aspect, he knew that he was not complete his whole being. This incense brings joy to the heart of man, as it is written (Mishlei, 27:9), “oil and incense gladden the heart.” This is as it is written (Divrei haYamim 2, 26:19), “when he became angry with the <i>Cohanim</i>, leprosy sprouted on his forehead.”<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">He then had to be cast out of the Temple, and remained a leper the rest of his life.</i> He realized that he was not clean in this aspect (joy), and in order to fix the matter, and judging himself to be in mortal danger, permitted himself to offer the incense in order to complete his soul. This was possible, because nothing should prevent the saving of a life. And truly, it succeeded, because after this he achieved completion, as it said, “leprosy sprouted on his forehead,” where the word for sprouted, <i>zarcha</i>, also means “to shine.” In this sense, it was only on the surface that his action was improper, but at the depths he achieved completion from this, as it is said (Melachim 2, 15:5), “[as a leper] he dwelled in the house of liberation.” That is, he was set free because he was then complete. However, since he was among the <i>Cohanim</i>, and the profundity of his intention was hidden from them, it seemed as if he was desecrating God. Thus in their eyes he was a leper. This is as it is said of his son Yotam (Divrei haYamim 2, 27:2), “and he did that which was proper in the eyes of God, just as his father Uziya had done, yet he did not enter the chamber of God.” This is a limitation, just as all the mentions of “yet” and “only” are in the Torah, in that he did not arrive at this level. And if Uziya had only offered the incense, he would have immediately entered the world to come."
