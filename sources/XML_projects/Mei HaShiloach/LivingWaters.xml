<title>T<small>RANSLATOR&#x2019;S</small> I<small>NTRODUCTION</small></title>
<p>Here is one version of the story.<sup><xref rid="fn1">1</xref></sup> Reb Tsadok haCohen of Lublin was traveling to various rabbis in Poland to sign a <italic>heter mea rabbanim</italic>, the consent of a hundred rabbis in order to divorce his wife. At that time Reb Tsadok, famous as a genius, was one of the most illustrious members of the <italic>mitnagdim</italic>, the opponents of hasidism who favored cerebral study over ecstatic devotion as the true form of Divine service. Eventually he reached the house of the &#x201C;Mei HaShiloach,&#x201D; Reb Mordechai Yosef in the town of Isbitza.<sup><xref rid="fn2">2</xref></sup> &#x201C;The Rebbe&#x2019;s class would begin at midnight by wrestling with revealed matters in a passage of the Talmud. By the morning light the discourse reached the secret of the furnace that powers the universe. In their discussion they arrived at the fundamental point: How does one arrive at the knowledge of the will of God through the actions of man, and at the revelation of God&#x2019;s presence through the study of the Torah and the fulfillment of its commandments?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Reb Tsadok stayed to discuss the lesson with the Rebbe of Isbitza after the class. &#x201C;The Mei HaShiloach suddenly broke off the discussion of the lesson, turned to Reb Tsadok and said: &#x2018;Here we are, involved in the study of this passage of Talmud according to our own minds and wills, as if the very law that we are discussing is <italic>our own</italic> wisdom. At the same time we are saying from our own understanding that the Torah <italic>is the blessed God&#x2019;s</italic>, and hidden within it is His very will, may He be blessed, in a way that through the process of Torah study we may merit to know the will of the blessed God at every moment, at every second. Together with this we may then feel the presence of the <italic>Shechina</italic>, which rests everywhere. Our sole objective is to ask: What in our study this evening has shown us the will of the Holy One, blessed be He, and what of it can proclaim the glory of heaven to the world? What of it can we use to fulfill our obligation to sanctify and love the Name of God in the world?&#x2019; In hearing the words from the mouth of the Mei HaShiloach, dread descended on Reb Tsadok&#x2019;s heart, and he began to tremble in his entire being. He asked the Rebbe:</p>
<p>&#x2018;How can we understand the will of the Creator?&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x2018;By means of the study of Torah&#x0021;&#x2019; answered the Mei HaShiloach. He continued, &#x2018;A man who studies Torah must feel as if his feet are standing at the foot of Mount Sinai and he is hearing the Torah from the very mouth of the All Powerful. Then he knows that it is His blessed will.&#x2019;</p>
<p>Reb Tsadok stood for a while, immersed in his thoughts. Days later, he would say of this conversation, &#x2018;I felt as if he had placed burning coals on my heart.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>
<p>As a result of this meeting, Reb Tsadok then became one of the principal students and <italic>hasidim</italic> of the Rebbe of Isbitza and his way, so remaining for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Many years later, it is told that in Reb Tsadok&#x2019;s old age, the famous genius Rabbi Yosef Rojin, the <italic>Illui</italic> of Rogatchoff, visited the house of Reb Tsadok in order to engage the Cohen in <italic>pilpul</italic>, heated discourse in the law. Reb Tsadok said, &#x2018;Your honor would like to know if I am a scholar. How will God be glorified in any way from this? This is not the reason why the sages of the great assembly instituted the blessing, &#x2018;Blessed is God who grants man wisdom.&#x2019; In my youth, I too was involved in such <italic>pilpul</italic> over the law, but I arrived at the understanding that the only way to achieve knowledge of the Torah is through the gates of hasidism which the holy Baal Shem Tov had opened for us.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn3">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Who was Reb Mordechai Yosef of Isbitza, and how did he arrive at the revolutionary conception of the Torah found in his teachings? He was born in the town of Tomashov in Poland in 1800 (5560) to a rabbinic family. The introduction to the <italic>Beit Yaakov</italic>, the teachings of his son, traces the family&#x2019;s lineage, each generation a leader of his community, back to Reb Moshe Issralis, the <italic>Ramo</italic>, and thus further to Rabbi Shlomo Yitchaki, Rashi, the leading medieval Torah commentator. Rashi then connects his lineage back to David haMelech. But as always, the fame of his family is not important. We are concerned with who he was. He grew up together with Rabbi Menachem Mendel Morgenstern, later to become &#x201C;the Kotsker Rebbe.&#x201D; The two were childhood friends and together were students and <italic>hasidim</italic> of Reb Simcha Bunem of Pshiske. It was from the Rebbe of Pshiske, the famous disciple of Yaakov Yitschak Horowitz, the &#x201C;Seer of Lublin,&#x201D; that the two received from the well-springs of the teachings of Rabbi Israel, the Baal Shem Tov, the founder of the hasidic movement.</p>
<p>In the introduction of the second volume of the <italic>Mei HaShiloach</italic>, it is told that when the young Reb Mordechai Yosef first met his teacher, Reb Simcha Bunem, the teacher said to him, almost joking, &#x201C;come, let us see who is taller.&#x201D; He motioned that they should compare height by standing back to back. This was peculiar, because where Mordechai Yosef was quite small in physique, Reb Simcha Bunem was of a large, strapping form. The Pshisker then said to him, &#x201C;Now I am taller than you. But you are still young, and in the days to come you shall grow.&#x201D; It was the Rebbe of Pshiske who gave Mordechai Yosef the name &#x201C;the Mei HaShiloach,&#x201D; the &#x201C;waters from the spring of Shiloach.&#x201D; This is the underground spring that flows from under the Temple Mount in Jerusalem and through the ancient city of David, now called Silwan. This was the place where the kings of the House of David were anointed. The meaning is akin to &#x201C;still waters run deep,&#x201D; which is the sense Simcha Bunem received from the quiet intensity of his young student. The Pshisker said, &#x201C;he is like the waters of the Shiloach which flow slowly and search out the deepest depths.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn4">4</xref></sup> This is reminiscent of the verse in Kohollet, &#x201C;It is deep, exceedingly deep, and who can fathom it?&#x201D;</p>
<p>When the Pshisker left this world, Reb Menachem Mendel became his successor, moving the center of operations to the town of Kotsk. Here in Kotsk, Mordechai Yosef, already his friend and study partner, became his disciple. There is much to say of this period, but it will not be said here. After some time the Kotsker closed himself in his room adjacent to the house of study, and there remained for the next twenty years until his death. When he would occasionally appear in his doorway, it was as the revelation of a Holy Seraph of God. In short, Mordechai Yosef objected to the Kotsker&#x2019;s self-imposed confinement, and left for the town of Isbitza, taking ninety percent of the Kotsker <italic>hasidim</italic> along with him. How many Jews remained in Kotsk? A <italic>minyan</italic> (ten). He then sent a message back to Menachem Mendel, saying, &#x201C;I promise to pay you back with children and grandchildren until the coming of the Messiah.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn5">5</xref></sup> Of this whole period, you will hear different versions depending on whether if comes from Kotsk family history or Isbitza family history. The version of Isbitza follows in the next section, the introduction from the <italic>Dor Yesharim</italic>. As a young student in Pshiske, it is told that he basically lived in the house of study, even sleeping there. He would return to visit his family for holidays.</p>
<p>As mentioned below in the <italic>Dor Yesharim</italic>, the Mei HaShiloach never wrote down his insights into the Torah. Even his students refrained from writing, but would rather commit his words to memory and later discuss the meaning of the Rebbe&#x2019;s teaching. This was also the case with the Baal Shem Tov. A story is told of the Baal Shem Tov seeing one of his students writing down his words of Torah. He looked at the writings and said, &#x201C;not a word of what I have said have you written.&#x201D; The introduction to the second volume of the <italic>Mei HaShiloach</italic> describes how the book was written. &#x201C;Indeed a number of years after he was taken from us, a number of the students of the Mei HaShiloach took it upon themselves to collect that which they remembered from the teachings and commit them to writing. Then future generations will also benefit from the light of his holy teachings. They pleaded with the son of the Mei HaShiloach to help them in this endeavor, and he entrusted the task to his own son, Reb Gershon Chanoch Hainech [the first Radziner Rebbe].&#x201D; That the words of the Isbitser Rebbe were written from memory during the twenty years following his death accounts for their terse, distilled character. This is not a work of literary merit; it is purely concerned with content. One must bear in mind that the writer of <italic>Mei HaShiloach</italic> felt as if he was writing what he remembered from the time he stood at Mount Sinai. Furthermore, the lessons were delivered in Yiddish, the Hebrew of the Bible, and the Aramaic of the Talmud and Zohar. Thus all that was Yiddish was then translated into Hebrew. Reb Gershon Chanoch published the first edition, an unedited of parts of the first volume, in the year 5620 (1860), four years after the Isbitzer left the world. It is told that the first printing of the <italic>Mei HaShiloach</italic> was done on a Gentile press and without any approbations from famous Rabbis of the generation, quite unusual for books of hasidic discourse to this day. The second volume of the <italic>Mei HaShiloach</italic> was put in writing and printed by Reb Gershon Chanoch&#x2019;s brother, Reb Mordechai Yosef Elazar.</p>
<p>Who studies this work? I once met with Reb Yaakov Lainer in Borough Park, Brooklyn. The son of the late Radziner Rebbe and a direct descendant of the <italic>Mei HaShiloach</italic>, he is the current publisher of Isbitza books in America. He told me that thirty years ago, his father, of blessed memory, would sell some twenty copies of the <italic>Mei HaShiloach</italic> each year. It was like a dinosaur. He told me that at that time it was only really studied by Jews who came from certain towns in Poland. Then in the late 1960s, Reb Shlomo Carlebach, may his memory be blessed, began his work of traveling seven continents to light Jewish hearts with the fire of hasidism. In his suitcase there was always a copy of the Mei HaShiloach. You could say that wherever he went, he took with him the light and profundity of the Isbitzer Rebbe, giving it to thirsty souls. I once heard him say, &#x201C;you cannot understand the <italic>Chumash</italic> [five books of Moses] without the <italic>Mei HaShiloach</italic>.&#x201D; In my conversation with Reb Lainer, he gave Shlomo Carlebach the credit for popularizing the <italic>Mei HaShiloach</italic> in our generation. In the six years I spent with Shlomo Carlebach, not a learning, not a Shabbos, went by without some light from the Isbitzer. Today it is found in every Hebrew bookstore, and is taught in every yeshiva of new young spirit seekers desiring inspiration from the hasidic masters. I used to spend much time in the shadow of Reb Yitschak Asher Twersky, of blessed memory, the Talner Rebbe of Boston. He is known as the pre-eminent scholar of Maimonides in this century. Sitting before him I always felt as if I was sitting before the Rambam. During one of his <italic>Drashot</italic> at the third meal of Shabbat, <italic>Parshat Beshalach</italic> in 1997, he quoted a teaching from the <italic>Mei HaShiloach</italic> on &#x201C;Who is like You among the powers, Hashem.&#x201D; He then said that he wanted to find time to teach a regular <italic>shiur</italic> (lesson) devoted to the Mei HaShiloach. But sadly, he was summoned to the world of Truth before he could realize this desire. I remember Rabbi Shlomo Riskin in Efrat, Israel, during his <italic>drash</italic> for Shabbat haGadol, the week before Passover, mentioning before 700 people a teaching from the Mei HaShiloach. Also in Efrat, I happened to walk into a class with Rabbi Chaim Brovender with a copy of the <italic>Mei HaShiloach</italic> under my arm. He noticed it, and said, &#x201C;Be careful. If you learn enough of this you may burn up&#x0021;&#x201D; I mention these examples just to show how widespread the prevalence of the Mei HaShiloach has become for those receptive to the teachings of hasidism, whereas fifty years ago the name &#x201C;Mei HaShiloach&#x201D; would have gone unnoticed.</p>
<p>I beg forgiveness for doing something as brazen as trying to summarize the main principle of the <italic>Mei HaShiloach</italic> in a few sentences. First and foremost, everything is in the hands of Heaven. Everything that we receive in our lives, we are receiving directly from the blessed God. It is then the work of man in the world to develop a mind that is conscious of this reality. On top of a general unwavering dedication to the Torah and its laws, man must specifically work, through the study of the Torah and <italic>avodat Hashem</italic>, the service of God, to know what God wants of him specifically in his life. He must also then know that God&#x2019;s will could change at any time, and must constantly look to God to illuminate into him what He wants of man at any particular moment. This also necessitates that he not assume that what God wants from him is the same as that which he wants from another. Even if he sees another transgressing the Torah, he may not assume that the other is rebelling against God&#x2019;s will, for he has no way of knowing the private relationship between the other and God. Thus, through personal refinement in according to his illumination of the will of God, he develops the consciousness of the presence and intentions of God. In this way, redemption is really just a change of consciousness. Then his conduct based on this new redemptive consciousness serves to glorify and sanctify the Name of God in the world. Now we must look in the text to find examples of these ideas.</p>
<p>It is written in the Gemara (<italic>Berachot</italic>, 33b), &#x201C;all is in the hands of Heaven, except the fear of Heaven.&#x201D; Rashi comments, &#x201C;everything comes to man from God, the length of his life, whether he is poor or rich, whether he is simple or wise. However, whether he is good or wicked does not come from Heaven, this is a choice delivered into the hands of man, where two ways are placed before him, and he shall choose the fear of God.&#x201D; However, as the Mei HaShiloach writes in <italic>Parshat Vayeira</italic>, under &#x201C;and Sarah denied it,&#x201D; that this only applies to the limits of the understanding of man&#x2019;s intellect. It is in fact necessary for man to believe that he chooses to serve God so he has the desire to perform, and then the service can be called the work of his hands. However, in reality, he is &#x201C;taking from the treasure house of the King and giving back to the Kings,&#x201D; in the saying of the Zohar (<italic>Shmini</italic>, 38a). So if all that man does is a result of the constant Providence of God, then even the sins of Israel are part of God&#x2019;s greater plan. Needless to say that this is in the large view, and cannot be taken before the action as a license to act recklessly. The Gemara (<italic>Avoda Zara</italic>, 4b) claims that Israel sinned in making a golden calf only to encourage the proper repentance of later generations. Though they went ahead and made the idol, they made atonement and their repentance was accepted. As a result, the tribes were given the mitzvah of giving the half-shekel. If the result of their sin was the performance of their mitzvah, which is meritorious in God&#x2019;s view, certainly God takes pleasure when every Jew returns to His law. And if even the sin is transformed into merit, how much more pleasing is it when Israel performs acts that from the outset are meritorious&#x0021; Thus the Mei HaShiloach repeats several times the words of the Gemara (<italic>Gittin</italic>, 53a), &#x201C;one cannot uphold the Torah unless he has failed in it.&#x201D; After the fact, the failure only serves to deepen one&#x2019;s appreciation of the essence of the commandment.</p>
<p>There is a level beyond man&#x2019;s choice, and this is clearly expressed concerning the verse, &#x201C;in the plain over against Suf&#x201D; (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 1:1). There it is written, &#x201C;Why were the sins of Israel discreetly mentioned through the names of the places where the sins occurred rather than by the mention of the time when they occurred? This is in order that man does not think that the sins were done according to their power of choice, and that they had the choice to remove themselves from the sin. The matter of place hints at this, for it was not possible for them to guard themselves from the sin and move to a different place.&#x201D;</p>
<p>So too, we find the entire Davidic line, the very Messiah, as a result of the incest of Lot and his daughters. Also with Yehuda and Tamar, when he admits and says, &#x201C;she is more righteous than I [<italic>mimeni</italic>],&#x201D; the Gemara (<italic>Sotah</italic>, 10b) says, &#x201C;here God was saying, &#x2018;the whole incident came forth from Me [<italic>memeni</italic>].&#x2019; &#x201D; In <italic>Parshat Vayeishev</italic>, under &#x201C;and Er,&#x201D; the Mei HaShiloach writes, &#x201C;For the Holy One, blessed be He, conducts all the structures of the kingdom of the House of David, according to structures such as these, even though at the time of the action it seemed like a sin &#x2026; The secret of the House of David is greatly concealed, even from the prophets.&#x201D;</p>
<p>So truly, all that we are receiving in this world is coming from the blessed God. On the verse, &#x201C;Mercy and Truth will not abandon you&#x201D; (<italic>Mishlei</italic>, 3:3), the Mei HaShiloach comments, &#x201C;The verse is not formulated, &#x2018;do not abandon Mercy and Truth,&#x2019; for truly the effluence of the blessed God descends constantly without interruption. Only man, from his side, needs to refine his heart and stand ready to receive, and not turn his back on this effluence, God forbid. But in His goodness the blessed God constantly effuses His effluence, and the man who longs for His Mereies shall not forsake them.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now it is up to man to develop a mind that constantly looks to the will of God to guide his actions. (Though this very effort must be a direct effect of God&#x2019;s influence in the world.) This can be seen in all of the actions of Yaakov Avinu, but particularly when he went to bless the sons of Yosef. Yaakov said, &#x201C;E-lohim who guided me all my life until this day.&#x201D; The Rebbe of Isbitza explains, &#x201C;for every action I do, no matter how small, I need the blessed God to illuminate His will into me. I even need it with this action [blessing Menashe and Efriam], where I saw how it is His will to change it [to bless the younger before the older], nevertheless I need to see even the second time how it is His blessed will. Truly in this matter Yaakov was the greatest of the Patriarchs, for to have the blessed God constantly lead one&#x2019;s actions is a great level. This was the prayer of King David (Tehillim, 23:1), &#x2018;God is my shepherd, I will lack nothing,&#x2019; meaning that the Providence of the blessed God will not be lacking from me, for He will always guide me, and I will be ever aware that the blessed God is guiding me.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Two characters are presented in the <italic>Mei HaShiloach</italic>. One is typified by Yosef, or Efriam, and this type always looks to the judgment of the Torah in every matter. So too does this type feel a sense of holy rage when confronted with transgression of the Torah, as with Pinchas, who descended from Efriam. The other type is Yehuda, who constantly looks to the blessed God to tell him how to act. This appears in <italic>Parshat Vayeishev</italic>:</p>
<p align="blockquote">This is as it is said (Yesahya, 11:13), &#x201C;Efriam shall not be jealous of Yehuda, and Yehuda shall not distress Efriam.&#x201D; These two tribes were always opposing each other, for the force of life which the blessed God gave to Efriam (from Yosef) was of the nature that it always looked to every action regarding its judgment and law, without moving from it. Therefore, when the writings warn Israel against sinning, then the aim of the Torah will be to say (Amos, 5:6), &#x201C;lest the house of Yosef should prevail like fire,&#x201D; meaning that they should concern themselves that there should be no opponents to their actions. The root of life for Yehuda, however, is to look to the blessed God regarding the course of every action. Even though he sees where the judgment leans, still he looks to the blessed God in order to see the depth of the truth of the matter.</p>
<p align="blockquote">So it is with all matters, and this is the root of life for Yehuda, to look to God in everything and not to act simply in a way that is accepted or habitual. Even though yesterday he acted in such a way, yet anyhow, today he does not want to rely on his former response, only that the blessed God should illuminate His will into him anew. This matter sometimes necessitates even doing something against the law, for, &#x201C;it is a time to do for God, the Torah has been suspended.&#x201D; (Tehillim 119:126)</p>
<p>So upon understanding this, one must be flexible with the will of God, for the vessel only illuminates from that which is shined into it. For the Mei HaShiloach, this is the essence of the commandment concerning the scriptural commandment of temporary vows, as explained in <italic>Parshat Mattot</italic>:</p>
<p align="blockquote">It occurred [with all of the prophets other than Moshe] in their prophetic spirit that whichever particular word of prophecy they were speaking was enduring for all eternity. Yet truly, there existed changes according to the quality of each generation. On this, &#x201C;Moshe Rabeynu&#x2019;s level of prophecy was superior to them all, prophesizing with &#x2018;this is the word.&#x2019; &#x201D; This means that he understood the prophecy according to its time and place, understanding that a prophecy is only relevant for a particular time, and later God may desire something else &#x2026; Therefore it is said, &#x201C;this is the word,&#x201D; for one must understand that the particular action is only temporarily forbidden to him, and that the blessed God can give him the power to receive all the good of the world without being disconnected from the service of the Divine.</p>
<p>Then, if God&#x2019;s plans require different processes and limitations for each individual, this changes the way one will view another&#x2019;s way of acting in the world. &#x201C;The blessed God allotted to each one goodness and life, and one is not similar to his fellow&#x201D; (<italic>Parshat Bamidbar</italic>). In <italic>Parshat Va&#x2019;etchanan</italic>:</p>
<p align="blockquote">As for the meaning behind the commandments, each one feels the unique meaning of a commandment that another does not feel, nor does he have the understanding of his fellow. We find an example of this in the Gemara (<italic>Pesachim</italic>, 53b), &#x201C;even though one says to light, and another says not to light, they both had the same intention.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn6">6</xref></sup> For at first it seemed as if one disagreed with the other, yet truly there was no disagreement for they both intended the same thing. Thus one does not call to question the attributes of his fellow, for he understands that his fellow can only keep the mitzvah in his own way, and not in his way. Therefore it says (in verse 19), &#x201C;to cast out all your enemies from before you,&#x201D; which is referring to those involved in fierce disagreements in Israel. Yet the meaning is not that they should be destroyed, God forbid, but rather to cast out their kind of service from before you, so as not to disturb you from your own service.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Isbitser reevaluates the entire matter of the commandment to rebuke ones neighbor in his interpretation of the verse, &#x201C;you shall surely rebuke,&#x201D; in <italic>Parshat Behar</italic>:</p>
<p align="blockquote">Even though the blessed God commanded man to reprove his neighbor and to try to distance him from all evil as much as is possible, this is only possible in a place where he knows he can help him by bringing him to the good, or through prayer which will arouse compassion upon him to return him to the path of ethical behavior. However, if he cannot remove him from his errors, then he must judge him meritoriously, and not accuse him. Thus one cannot judge his neighbor as guilty, for perhaps his neighbor&#x2019;s <italic>yetser hara</italic> (inclination to evil) is greater than his own. Or, perhaps what he sees as an error or sin is actually permitted to his neighbor, for there are many things that are forbidden to one but permitted to another.</p>
<p>Once one has gone through this process of personal refinement, and refining the way he sees the world, he is capable of experiencing redemption. This is because the nature of exile is really the exile of man&#x2019;s consciousness, when he cannot see the presence of God in his life. But if he can remove the veil and see how &#x201C;all really is in the hands of Heaven,&#x201D; then no matter what transpires, it is all part of the direct involvement of God in order to bring about redemption, where the knowledge of God is sensed with utmost clarity. The classic example of this is found in <italic>Parshat Vayigash</italic>, where a simple change of consciousness in a second can bring Yehuda from believing that he is facing a life of incarceration by a foreign king to standing before his lost brother who will save his entire family from famine and be reunited with his father:</p>
<p align="blockquote">For all these verses [at the beginning of the <italic>Parsha</italic>] are a claim against the blessed God, with Yehuda supposing all the while that he was standing before and arguing with a Gentile king. Then when the blessed God sent them the salvation, then they saw that even in retrospect they were never in danger, for truly they were arguing with their brother. Thus it will be in the future, when the blessed God will save us and redeem us, then God will show us that we were never in exile, and that a foreign nation never ruled over us, only God alone. This is the meaning of the verse (Tehillim, 37:10), &#x201C;and a little more, and there is no evil one, and you considered his place, and there is nothing there,&#x201D; meaning that very soon evil will be banished. &#x201C;And you considered,&#x201D; meaning the understanding of the heart, for if you want to understand its place, &#x201C;there is nothing there,&#x201D; meaning that in it there was no power of governance over you.</p>
<p>In this way, redemption is just a change of consciousness. To do this is a difficult path, requiring constant reevaluation of how God&#x2019;s will illuminates into each one of us. No matter what I think I understand, I have to go back and look again, for every letter in the Torah is infinite, and, as the Mei HaShiloach tells us, there is a depth far deeper in the words of Torah than the human consciousness can conceive.</p>

<title>A<small>CKNOWLEDGMENTS</small></title>
<p>First and foremost I would like to thank the Master of Heaven and Earth who made it possible for this exceptional figure in spiritual history to exist and for me to be able to bring it to the English-speaking public. May He continue to help all of us and take joy in all of our endeavors. Next I must thank my dear wife Ilana who made it possible for me to sit and complete the work now before you, and my dear son Ilai who is a constant source of <italic>nachat ruach</italic> and inspiration.</p>
<p>In terms of the understanding of the teachings of Isbitza, I am greatly dedicated to Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach, may his memory bless us all, who first passed the fire of the <italic>Mei HaShiloach</italic> into my heart, and who exemplified its message in every moment of his life. I owe great gratitude to Professor Elie Wiesel, who first introduced me to the teachings of Isbitza and so many other hasidic Masters as a student in his seminar at Boston University. May he continue to inspire us and spread the light of Hasidut throughout the world. I will always be indebted to Dr. Elie Stillman, a hidden master of the <italic>Mei HaShiloach</italic>, for our discussions of the meaning of these teachings and for just being a good friend. I would like to thank Daniel Langerman of the Talner Community in Boston for presenting me on his visit to Israel with the copy of the <italic>Mei HaShiloach</italic> from which I translated. And a very special thanks and much gratitude to Arthur Kurzweil, Hope Breeman, and the entire staff of Jason Aronson for the superb production of this volume of the <italic>Mei HaShiloach</italic>, the first-ever translation of the work into English.</p>

<p>A note on the proper pronunciation of the transliterated Hebrew. &#x201C;<italic>Ch</italic>&#x201D; is always a soft guttural as in the German &#x201C;Na<italic>ch</italic>t&#x201D; or the Scottish &#x201C;Lo<italic>ch</italic>.&#x201D; It is never pronounced in a hard palatal as in &#x201C;chance&#x201D; or &#x201C;choke.&#x201D; The &#x201C;im&#x201D; at the end of a word is prounounced &#x201C;eem,&#x201D; as in &#x201C;deem&#x201D; or &#x201C;seem.&#x201D; Thus the name for the book of Kings, for example, is pronounced &#x201C;Mela<italic>ch</italic>eem,&#x201D; with the &#x201C;<italic>ch</italic>&#x201D; being soft.</p>

<title>I<small>NTRODUCTION</small></title>
<p>from the &#x201C;Dor Yesharim&#x201D; (The Generation of the Upright)</p>
<p>The following is translated from the <italic>Dor Yesharim</italic>, or Generation of the Upright,<sup><xref rid="fn7">1</xref></sup> the family history of Reb Mordechai Yosef <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> and his descendants, written by Chaim Simcha Lainer <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic>, a direct descendant of the holy Isbitser. It was published in Lublin, Poland, in 1925.</p>
<p>Lend your ears, and hear that which you have not heard before, the wonders of our master, father, and teacher, the holy Rav, Mordechai Yosef, may his memory be a blessing, the author of the holy book, <italic>Mei HaShiloach</italic>, the waters of Siloah, may his merits protect us. He upheld the Torah out of poverty, bearing all suffering and all manner of hardship in order to study God&#x2019;s law. Even in the days of his greatness he did not adorn his home with riches, with the plunder of fine rugs and curtains, but rather made do with little. His main purpose was to let the wellsprings of wisdom flow forth. He soon succeeded in raising many scholars, and after the passing of the holy Rav Simcha Bunem of Pshiske through the influence of the splendor of his torah and <italic>Kedusha</italic>, he became the main on the spirit of those who seek Hashem. He taught them to go on the path of the just and ways of righteousness. He was the great tree, the Rav of Rabbis, from which sprouted endless branches that instilled the roots of hasidut in those who seek Hashem and His Torah. Among his students were holy ones, geniuses, the truly virtuous, who illuminated the face of the earth with their torah, the light of which appeared upon them in his house of study, as is known. His holy community was like the fellowship of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, like that of the holy Baal Shem Tov and our holy master Reb Dov Ber, may their memories be for a blessing. If one tried to tell all of his good deeds, wonders, and the holy ways in which he went in the span of his short life, then &#x201C;the curtain in the chamber of the Holy Temple would not suffice.&#x201D; Yet we may say that he brought salvation, rescue, and redemption in both matters physical and spiritual, for the mute and the destitute. He increased Torah and strength, bringing many souls under the wings of the <italic>Shechina</italic>. Great were his actions, effects, and way of holy service that he paved for the sake of God&#x2019;s glory. And great is the honor that the Omnipresent has granted him forever.</p>
<p>In his youth, he was a student in the town of Tomashov. The holy Rav, our master and teacher Reb Menachem Mendel, may his memory be for a blessing,<sup><xref rid="fn8">2</xref></sup> of Kotsk was also a student in that town, and both were <italic>hasidim</italic> of the Prshisker Rebbe. Between them there was love and friendship and peace. It once happened that there was a dispute in the house of study between the <italic>hasidim</italic> of Pshiske and the <italic>hasidim</italic> of another court. The dispute came to blows, and the Rav, Reb Menachem Mendel <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> was then in the house of study. Someone went to notify Reb Mordechai Yosef <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic>, who was still at his home. When he heard, he ran directly to the house of study. On his way, when someone on the side of the road saw a Pshisker hasid racing in the street, he knew immediately that he was going to help the Pshiskers. So then the man extended his leg in front of the shins of my grandfather<sup><xref rid="fn9">3</xref></sup> <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> to cause him to fall. He then tripped, and then got immediately on his feet, continuing on his way. The man who tripped him immediately began to feel pain in his leg, and soon after was confined to bed. He could never walk again, and was bedridden until the day of his death some twenty years later. So would one be careful of his wrath.</p>
<p>After the passing of the holy Rav, Reb Simcha Bunem, <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic>, of Pshiske, who was his brilliant teacher and the one who laid hands on his head, all of his <italic>hasidim</italic> looked to Mordechai Yosef, <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic>, in order to establish him as their leader. They looked to him to teach them the ways of Torah and hasidut, and the service of God, to place the holy crown on his head and call him &#x201C;Rebbe,&#x201D; for they knew his greatness. Yet it was not yet the time for him to take upon himself the position of the rabbinate. This is as he said himself at this time, telling them to choose a Rebbe from whoever was fit in their eyes, and I too will be together with you in this appointment, until the year 5600, for then I too will be a Rebbe, with the help of the blessed God, and a shepherd a community of Israel. When they heard this they chose Reb Menachem Mendel <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> for their Rebbe, and Mordechai Yosef joined with them in the community of Kotsk.</p>
<p>Among all of the <italic>hasidim</italic> in Kotsk he was esteemed as a holy man, where no one exceeded the height of his stature. They relegated him great honor for his pure and authentic torah and service.</p>
<p>One time in Kotsk, the holy genius Yitsik Meir <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic>, the &#x201C;Chiddushei Harim,&#x201D; entered into his room to speak with him for a great while. He was lying on his bed and the &#x201C;Harim&#x201D; <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> was sitting at his feet. Eventually he fell asleep, and in the midst of his sleep he placed his feet on the knees of the &#x201C;Harim&#x201D; <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic>. The Harim <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> did not move an inch until my grandfather <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> woke from his sleep on his own accord. In this way all of the great ones of the generation would honor him.</p>
<p>Once while he was still with his Rav (the Pshisker <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic>) a scholarly man came to visit from some famous city. They had said of him that he could recite all of the six orders of the Mishna by heart. When the <italic>hasidim</italic> told Reb Mordechai Yosef <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic>, he answered, &#x201C;like me? I too can recite all of the <italic>Mishnayot</italic> by heart.&#x201D; They began to test him, and of each place that they asked him, he answered immediately without stuttering. This was a wonder in their eyes, for they had never known that he had this ability. So he answered them, &#x201C;why does this amaze you? I did not learn them so I could later brag to you that I could say them all by heart&#x0021; Just in the course of my study I manage to remember them, as it is written, and Your Torah is in my belly&#x2019; (Tehillim, 40:9). This is as it is written in the Tanna D&#x2019;vei Eliyahu (Rabba, Ch. 2), &#x2018;Fortunate is the man who places himself like an ox under the yoke, and like a mule carrying a load. Who each day, constantly, sits and contemplates the Torah. Immediately the Holy Spirit will rest upon him, and the Torah will be in his belly.&#x2019; &#x201D; This principle was upheld by my grandfather, <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic>, and all of the <italic>hasidim</italic> in Kotsk and Pshiske saw this.</p>
<p>He had exhibited the clear spirit of prophecy on numerous occasions. Once when he was still in Kotsk, the time came for him to travel to his hometown. When he went in to receive the blessing of the Rebbe <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic>, the Rebbetzin said to him, &#x201C;Soon I will give birth. Maybe you could stay a little longer until the <italic>brit mila</italic>?&#x201D; He immediately answered her, &#x201C;you will certainly give birth to a girl.&#x201D; The Rebbetzin told this to the Rebbe, and he answered her, &#x201C;if he said it, it will surely be.&#x201D; And so it was.</p>
<p>On another occasion it happened that he needed to travel to his hometown. When he went in to receive the blessing from the Rebbe, the Rebbetzin told him just as was mentioned above. He then answered her, &#x201C;You will give birth to twins, and by the time of the <italic>brit</italic> I will, God willing, have returned to Kotsk.&#x201D; And it happened just as he had said.</p>
<p>When the time had come to reveal his great light in the year 5600 from the creation of the world, the year hinted at when the holy Zohar says, &#x201C;the gates of wisdom will be opened&#x201D; (as is cited in the <italic>shalshelet haqabbalah</italic>), he then spent the holidays from Rosh Hashanah until after Succot in Kotsk, as had been his custom. This time, immediately after Rosh Hashanah, many of the <italic>hasidim</italic> began to crown him with the title &#x201C;Rebbe.&#x201D; Some then gave him &#x201C;Kvitlach&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn10">4</xref></sup> and &#x201C;Pidyonos.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn11">5</xref></sup> A storm of controversies and opposing views ensued among the <italic>hasidim</italic>. Jealousy dwells even in high places. However, the God-fearing and scholarly <italic>hasidim</italic> sided with him, cleaving unto him. Thus was the atmosphere in Kotsk until Shmini Atseret,<sup><xref rid="fn12">6</xref></sup> and the Rebbe did not say a word. On the eve of Shmini Atseret, my grandfather <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> told the <italic>hasidim</italic> in his charge to bring Torah scrolls to his lodgings, where they would pray and dance with the Torah separate from the festivities in the house of study of the Rebbe <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic>. They did as he said at once, though at this time did not understand his reasons for this request. After several hours, the Rebbe <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> was praying in his room in the house of study, and his <italic>hasidim</italic> were making dancing circuits with the Torah scrolls. My grandfather <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> had each year been appointed to lead the sixth <italic>hakafa</italic> (dancing circuit) of &#x201C;Yosef haTsaddik.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn13">7</xref></sup> When they had arrived at this <italic>hakafa</italic>, the Rebbe <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> ran from his room adjacent to the house of study and snatched the Torah scroll from the one who was holding it. He then immediately raised his eyes to look in the face of the one from whom he had taken the Torah scroll, and returned it, saying that he had thought that he was my grandfather <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic>. Seeing this, the <italic>hasidim</italic> then understood that in his prophetic spirit he had prepared a separate order of dancing in his lodgings, in order to avoid certain controversy. My grandfather <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> said that if at that moment he had been holding the Torah scroll, there is no way it could have been taken from him. After the incident, Reb Mordechai Yosef <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> told his <italic>hasidim</italic> that he had received a hint from heaven not to go to the <italic>hakafot</italic> in the house of study. That morning, in confusion, his shoes had been switched and he had put his left shoe on his right foot. From this he had understood not to go, but rather arrange the dancing in his lodgings.</p>
<p>After that, when he went to travel back to his home town of Tomashov, Reb David <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic>, the son of the (Kotsker) Rebbe <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic>, went to accompany him on his way out of town, to the place where he met his wagon. Reb David <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> said, &#x201C;what can you give me as a souvenir?&#x201D; So he gave him all of the <italic>Kvitlach</italic> that the <italic>hasidim</italic> had given him during the High Holy Days. He said to him, &#x201C;I leave you with a livelihood for your children and children&#x2019;s children.&#x201D; Many years later, Reb David <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> said that with this, he made Reb Mordechai Yosef <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> his Rebbe. He sent the money of all the <italic>Pidyonot</italic> to the Rebbetzin (of Kotsk) and made his way on to Tomashov. He then began to act according to his new status on high (as a Rebbe), and people were drawn to him from near and far. He increased in the study of Torah and the ways of hasidut. Then, everyone for whom the fear of God touched his heart, and to whom God had granted a heart of understanding, would drink thirstily from his holy words, which flowed from the source of life. It was then that he established his home in the town of Isbitza, outside of Lublin, fulfilling the words of the <italic>Chozei z&#x2019;l</italic> (Seer) of Lublin. For it was, that once the holy Rebbe, our teacher Yaakov Yitschok <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic>, the Rav of Lublin, called the <italic>Chozei</italic>, had passed through the town of Isbitza. He had said that this town was similar to Jerusalem, the holy city, for &#x201C;Jerusalem, mountains surround her&#x201D; (Tehillim, 125:2), and finished by saying that here would someday be a great scholar who would disseminate the knowledge of the Torah of Truth among the many.</p>
<p>He was a &#x201C;sage, preferable to a prophet.&#x201D; He had a clear and refined intuition. Once, on Rosh Hashanah, among the congregation of <italic>hasidim</italic>, there was a certain hasid, a man of Torah and the fear of God, who began to have regrets about having traveled to Isbitza for Rosh Hashanah. He thought, &#x201C;maybe I should have traveled to a Rebbe who is not beset by opponents.&#x201D; Immediately another thought came to his mind, thinking, &#x201C;is it not forbidden to question the attributes of one&#x2019;s Rav?&#x201D; From this thought sprang another thought. &#x201C;Whoever said he is my Rav?&#x201D; In this way his thoughts and musings flashed through his mind to such an extent that he could not bring himself any sound counsel. Finally, he decided to wait for a sign. If he saw that the Rebbe feels his thoughts, then he would know that he is the true <italic>tsaddik</italic> of the generation, and the Rebbe whose torah should be sought after, for he is an angel of the Lord of Hosts.</p>
<p>Then it was, after Rosh Hashanah, when this man came before my grandfather <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic>, he began speaking to the man, saying, &#x201C;It is written in the Torah, &#x2018;keep the festival of <italic>matsot</italic>.&#x2019; You should know that the scholar is called &#x2018;the festival,&#x2019; and the <italic>matsot</italic> means strife, contention, and controversy.<sup><xref rid="fn14">8</xref></sup> This is the explanation of &#x2018;the festival of <italic>matsot</italic>.&#x2019; The scholar who is embroiled in strife, contention, and controversy, this is the very one you should keep and bring yourself close to.&#x201D; In saying this, he had solved the man&#x2019;s dilemma before him. He now knew that his Rav was an angel of the Lord of Hosts, and he traveled to be with him all the days of his life.</p>
<p>Once when he was in Isbitza sitting at his holy table among his devoted followers on the festival of Shevuot, he suddenly told his <italic>hasidim</italic> to take his table and chairs outside to the river&#x2019;s edge. They did not understand why he wanted this. Then after the festival, a man came to Isbitza and told how that Shevuot he had been with the Rebbe of Kotsk. The Rebbe asked the man to describe the exact location and position of the Kotsker <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic>&#x2019;s holy table. The man described its proper location. Then they saw that with his prophetic spirit he had immediately felt this, thereby immediately changing his location.</p>
<p>One time on the holy day of Shabbos in the middle of his repast he asked the <italic>hasidim</italic> sitting with him to stand around him, and on the benches. He told them to bend their heads over the table from both sides in order to cover the table with a kind of <italic>succa</italic>. Later he told them that he had asked them to do this because of the situation between him and the Rebbe of Kotsk <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic>.</p>
<p>The holy Rav, our teacher, Reb Yitsik <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> of Vorke, once passed through the town of Isbitza. My grandfather <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> asked him to spend the holy Shabbos with him. He answered him and said, &#x201C;With all my heart and soul I would like to spend Shabbos with you, for surely I will experience much greater light and <italic>Kedusha</italic> with you than at the place where I am now going. But what can I do? I am obligated to go on my way.&#x201D; With this he received a blessing on his departure from the Rebbe <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> with apologies and great love.</p>
<p>In the town of Isbitza he had his opponents. Once on the holy Shabbos one of his opponents, an arrogant miscreant, had the audacity to enter the kitchen where Rebbe&#x2019;s Shabbos food was stored, opened the stove, and mixed dirt in with the food. When the Rebbe&#x2019;s <italic>shammash</italic> came in to get the food, he saw what had happened, and could not serve the food because it had become foul and impossible to eat. Meanwhile the Rebbe asked why the food was not being brought to the table, and the <italic>shammash</italic> was too embarrassed to answer. After the Rebbe asked a few times he was told the truth, that someone had come in and deliberately ruined the food and that it was now inedible. When he heard this, he instructed them to bring the food to the table as it was, and immediately the food fouled with earth was brought before him. He saw this, and then opened his holy mouth, saying to those sitting before him, &#x201C;What is fitting to do with a man who in impunity spoils and shames food fit for human consumption? And all the more so, food for the holy Shabbos? And even more so, food prepared for Torah scholars? Therefore he who put dust in the food should be made into ashes and dust. (Heaven save us.)&#x201D; And so it was. To this day, there are those in Isbitza who remember this event, how after this Shabbos the hand of Hashem went forth and struck the miscreant and his household with severe judgments, Heaven help us. Beware of His wrath.</p>
<p>Among the holy community of my grandfather <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> were two particularly noteworthy students. One was our holy Rav, Ariye Leib Eiger <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic>, famous for his great sanctity, chastity, and piety. He was truly dedicated to the service of the Divine, and sacrificed himself to these ends all the days of his life. The second was our holy and great Rav, Tsadok haCohen <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> of Lublin. Besides his sanctity, righteousness, and piety, he was also known as a genius, fiery and expert in the chambers of the Torah. There was no one like him in his time, as we see now that his many awesome writings have been made available. These two students themselves attest that they never reached even the border of the righteousness and Divine service of their Rav, nor the excellence and greatness of his scholarship in Torah. At that time the sages of this generation said that this is how one can recognize the true greatness and <italic>Kedusha</italic> of the Rebbe. For how great and exalted is the Rebbe whose righteousness and service of God exceeds even Reb Leibale Eiger <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic>, and whose wisdom, greatness, and fierceness in Torah exceeds even Reb Tsadok haCohen <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic>&#x0021; These two went to ask of the ways of Torah from his mouth. Certainly he is angel of the Lord of Hosts.</p>
<p>The holy Rav, our teacher Tsadok haCohen <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> of Lublin testified of him that in all his days he never spoke of idle or mundane matters, and all his words require study, as they were filled with the knowledge of Torah.</p>
<p>My uncle, the holy Rav, our teacher Gershon Chenoch Hainich <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> once said to me, &#x201C;<italic>Zein Treit hot gebrent mit divrei Torah</italic>&#x2014;all of his very footsteps burned with the words of Torah&#x0021;&#x201D;</p>
<p>His custom was to study every night in the house of study with his <italic>hasidim</italic>. First the <italic>shammash</italic> would come to the house of study with two candles and a tractate of the Gemara, signaling to the <italic>hasidim</italic> that the lesson would soon begin. Then everyone prepared his place. Then the Rebbe <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> would immediately arrive and sit in his place also, where he would commence to teach about a page of the Gemara or more. Afterward he would say &#x201C;<italic>Chidushei Torah</italic>,&#x201D; original insights into the Torah on the subjects that they were studying. It was like this every night. This was also the custom with my grandfather, the holy Rav, our teacher Yaakov <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic>, in Isbitza and later in the town of Radzin. All the skins of all the deer would not suffice to record in writing all of the wisdom that was said there, and so too it was not the students&#x2019; custom to write, but each would take mental notes according to his understanding.</p>
<p>One time he said to his <italic>hasidim</italic>, &#x201C;You are to know that whoever travels to me, at the time that he is with me he forgets his home completely. This is a sign that he has some connection to me. And one who is with me and remembers his home, he has no connection to me. You are all to know that I see each one of you in particular. I see even that which you do in you innermost chambers, and in secret in your homes.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It was his custom before the morning <italic>shacharit</italic> prayer to recite verses from <italic>Parshat Ha&#x2019;azinu</italic> (<italic>Devarim</italic>, Ch. 32). Those who knew of this would also follow this custom.</p>
<p>As is known, when dressing one always dresses first the right side, and then the left. Once it happened that he put on his left shoe first. For this he fasted and did not speak the entire day.</p>
<p>It was his custom after taking a hot bath in honor of the Shabbos or a festival for his <italic>shammash</italic> to pour pure olive oil on his head. Our master and teacher <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> the &#x201C;Beit Yaakov&#x201D; (his son), also followed this custom after him.</p>
<p>One time, on the eve of the holy Shabbos (Friday afternoon) while walking home from the bathhouse of the town of Isbitza down the main street, he saw a small child sitting by the window of a house. When he passed by the window he heard the child say, &#x201C;the wicked stray from the womb&#x201D; (Tehillim, 58:4), for he (the child) noticed some impunity in him. May the blessed God give us and all of Israel children God has blessed.</p>
<p>At the time of the plague, Heaven protect us, he commanded to say constantly the verse (Tehillim, 94:22), &#x201C;Hashem shall be my stronghold, God shall be the rock of my refuge,&#x201D; for in this verse are contained all forces of success and protection.</p>
<p>Once it happened that a woman on the verge of giving birth entered alone into a barn, and disappeared. They searched for her but could not find her. After a great search, towards evening, they found her lying cast down by a river. When they asked her how she had gotten there, she said that they had forced her from the barn and taken her to the river. There they placed her in the water, and as she was about to expire from drowning, an elder appeared and said to them, &#x201C;let her go, have mercy on her, she has yet to live.&#x201D; Just after the elder had said this, her assailants removed her from the river and placed her on the bank, soaked through. (When the search party found her), they took her to her house and put her in her bed. Then on the second day, at exactly the time when they had taken her from the barn to the river, she girded her strength and ran from her bed, saying that she had to get to the river. With all her strength she fought with the men who did not let her run away, and it continued in this way each day until she was nearly completely insane with harrowing phantasms. They went and told my grandfather <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> about the situation. He told them to write a kosher <italic>mezuzah</italic> and to hang it around her neck. So they did, and she returned to her senses, with evil no longer terrifying her, God forbid.</p>
<p>The Rebbe <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> once advised the use of a <italic>segula</italic><sup><xref rid="fn15">9</xref></sup> for one sick with jaundice to place a living dove on the stomach of the man. The dove took the sickness inside her and the man was healed.</p>
<p>He would never eat meat that was slaughtered and cooked in the same day. Rather he requested that it be cooked the day after it was slaughtered. There is a source for this both in the wisdom of the kabbalah and in ways of good health.</p>
<p>He once said during an extended study of the tractate <italic>Eruvin</italic> in the Gemara, that it is a good <italic>segula</italic> to study each Shabbos eve a certain selection from this tractate (<italic>Eruvin</italic>, 21a), Rav Chisda said, Rav Mari bar Mar explained, &#x2018;why is it written (Tehillim, 119), &#x201C;for every purpose I have seen and end, Your commandments are exceedingly broad&#x2019; &#x201D; until, we find that the whole cosmos is one in three thousand two hundredths of the span of the Torah.&#x201D;</p>
<p>One time, during the week of the Torah reading <italic>Tetsave</italic>, as he was sitting by his table on the holy Shabbos, he gave a certain man a flask of wine and said, &#x201C;it is written in this week&#x2019;s <italic>Parsha</italic> (<italic>Shemot</italic>, 28:13), &#x2018;and you shall make settings of gold.&#x2019; <italic>Zalst haben felleh kastlich mit gold</italic>.&#x2014;May you have crates filled with gold&#x0021;&#x2019; &#x201D; Some days later, it happened that this man won the lottery, and became immensely wealthy.</p>
<p>Once a group of <italic>Kleizmorim</italic> (musicians) came to the Rebbe. They complained that a certain Baron had planned a great feast with music, and had invited them. Already expecting their wages from the Baron, they prepared themselves to play at the feast, when they heard that a group of Gentile musicians had approached the Baron, and winning his favor, the Baron had canceled the Jewish musicians. This caused them great damage and shame, for these were <italic>Kleizmorim</italic> of a high level who pleased all that heard them. When he heard this, his compassion for them was aroused, and he rested his head on his arm for some moments. When he arose, all who stood before him saw that tears were streaming down his face. He said to them, &#x201C;do not fear. You will yet play for the Baron, and he will even ask your forgiveness.&#x201D; Thus it was, that at the time of the feast when the Gentile musicians began to play, the Baron heard all kinds of mistakes in their playing, as he had an understanding of music. They also did not please the guests. He immediately fired them and sent for the <italic>Kleizmorim</italic>, appeasing them and giving them a great salary. The Baron and all of the guests were thoroughly enraptured in their music. It was then that they saw that the words of the Rebbe were the words of the living God.</p>
<p>It once happened that a certain hasid who was close to him fell from his position into poverty, Heaven protect us, until he did not even have the means to support his family. He then traveled to my grandfather <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> and poured before him his bitter predicament. He pleaded for the Rebbe to help him and the children in his care. The Rebbe advised him to travel to Lublin, and there he would find salvation. The man immediately took his advice, traveling to Lublin with only a few pennies in his pocket. There he milled about the streets and markets, but found no sign of assistance. About two weeks after he had come to Lublin, he was in the street, and he saw a Polish army officer walking toward him. When the officer saw him, he asked him, &#x201C;are you the one whose name is (such and such)?&#x201D; &#x201C;Yes, sir,&#x201D; answered the hasid. &#x201C;Then come to my house tonight. I have something for you.&#x201D; He then gave the hasid a card with his name and address written on it, and went on his way. The hasid asked around about the identity of this officer, and someone told him that he was the captain of a new regiment that had recently come to this area, but before that he was in the town of (such and such). Upon hearing the name of the town, the hasid remembered that he had a brother in that very same town whose name and family name was that which the officer had mentioned when he saw that the hasid was related to him. That night, when the hasid went to the officer&#x2019;s house, he saw many men knocking on his door. The officer refused them all entry, save the hasid, whon he took into his storeroom. There he gave him enough food and provisions for an entire regiment, as if he was his own brother. He also gave him money. When he left the house, the crowd saw him with all the boxes of supplies, and before he left he had sold them all he had. The man became rich and lived well the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Once during the week of <italic>Parshat Shlach</italic>, he explained why the incident of sending the spies is immediately followed by the commandment of the wine libations and the <italic>challot</italic> (showbreads) in the temple. In his pure language, that it is the way of the world and men that if someone is weak, suffering, or anguished you give him a glass of wine and food to give him strength. This is as it is written (Mishlei, 31), &#x201C;give wine to the bitter of spirit.&#x201D; So, too, after the mission of the spies, when all of Israel became depressed, and mourned greatly over the decree that they would not enter the land of Israel. So therefore they were given the <italic>mitzvot</italic> of the libations and <italic>challa</italic>. <italic>&#x201C;A trink branfin mit far bissen</italic>&#x2014;a drink of liquor with a little snack.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Once during <italic>Parshat Vayigash</italic>, he said the <italic>notakarion</italic><sup><xref rid="fn16">10</xref></sup> of &#x201C;<italic>Vayigash</italic> (meaning &#x2018;and he &#x007B;Yehuda&#x007D; came close to &#x007B;to Yosef&#x007D;&#x2019;)&#x201D; (from <italic>Bereshit</italic>, 44:18) was <italic>Vint Yudilech givent shreit</italic>&#x2014;&#x201C;the Jews cried a terrible cry.&#x201D; The Rebbe <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> himself passed away in the week of <italic>Parshat Vayigash</italic>. So did my uncle (the Isbitzer&#x2019;s grandson) the Rav Gershon Chenoch Hainich <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> pass away during <italic>Parshat Vayigash</italic>. Once, the holy Rav and disciple of the Isbitser, our teacher Reb Tsadok haCohen <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic>, wrote in his book, <italic>Pri</italic>, that he himself once heard the Rebbe <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> say that crying was hinted at in the word &#x201C;<italic>Vayigash</italic>&#x2014;and he came close,&#x201D; and that there was a great and deep matter in this.</p>
<p>Once during <italic>Parshat Vayikra</italic> he said, &#x201C;When I learned the verses (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 2:5-6) &#x2018;And if your sacrifice is a meal offering baked in a pan, it shall be of fine unleavened flour mixed with oil. You shall crumble it into pieces, and pour onto it oil&#x2014;it is a meal offering,&#x2019; then I felt the smell of life.&#x201D; I counted the number of words in these two verses, and they came to eighteen, the numerical equivalent of <italic>chai</italic>, &#x201C;alive.&#x201D; I then counted the number of letters in these two verses, and I arrived at sixty-eight, the numerical equivalent of <italic>chaiim</italic>, &#x201C;life.&#x201D;</p>
<p>[My uncle, the holy Rav, Reb Moshe Chaim Sokachevski <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> of Chelm, showed me another verse in this vein. It is (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 23:6), &#x201C;and Hashem your God did not desire to listen to Bilaam, so for you Hashem your God turned his curse into a blessing, for Hashem your God loves you.&#x201D; In this verse there are also eighteen words and sixty-eight letters equivalent to <italic>chaiim</italic>&#x2014;&#x201C;life.&#x201D;]</p>
<p>Once on Rosh Hashanah before the sounding of the Shofar he instructed all of the <italic>hasidim</italic> who were in the house of study to recite from the blessing directly before the morning <italic>Shema</italic> the words, &#x201C;With eternal love have you loved us, Hashem our God,&#x201D; until just before the end of the blessing, &#x201C;and to unify You with love, and to love Your name,&#x201D; three times. He said that he saw a great spirit of accusation descending upon Israel in the coming year, and therefore they were to pray with special fervor and return to God&#x2019;s ways from the depths of their hearts. He himself recited this with tears. And indeed, that year the harsh decrees were renewed against Israel, may Heaven protect us.</p>
<p>His disciple the holy Rav, the genius Reb Tsadok haCohen <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic>, took upon himself as a custom, and each year before the sounding of the Shofar, he commanded the congregation to recite &#x201C;with an eternal love&#x201D; three times.</p>
<p>In his days, a certain famous astrologer made a great tumult by saying that in a few more months a comet would destroy the world. Many believed him and feared his words. When this was told to the Rebbe <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic>, he said that these were pure lies, for it is written (Amos, 3:7), &#x201C;Hashem E-lohim will not do anything that he does not reveal to his servants the prophets.&#x201D; He said, &#x201C;How could a thing like this be true in the world and Hashem did not reveal it to me? Therefore it is all lies, and you shall not believe it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He passed away with a good name in the year 5614, on the seventh day of the month of Tevet. His final resting place was in the town of Isbitza, and he left behind him the blessing of words of Torah in his holy book, the <italic>Mei HaShiloach</italic>, in two volumes. There are also many more of his words in writing and passed on from mouth to ear between men of standing. May God bring us life and His merit protect us. Amen. Let it be His will.</p>
<p>Love of Israel was fixed permanently in his heart, to such a great extent that he warned against bringing accusations, God forbid, even against sinners. These are his words in the <italic>Mei HaShiloach</italic>:</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And you shall not wrong one another, and you shall fear your God &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 25:17).</p>
<p>This verse is also directed to great souls of precious value, when they see someone doing something against the will of the blessed God, and want to accuse against him, punishing him. On this the Holy One, blessed be He, &#x201C;do not wrong,&#x201D; and similarly did David haMelech say (Tehillim, 50:20&#x2013;21, following R. Hirsch&#x2019;s translation), &#x201C;You sit and speak against your brother, you slander your own mother&#x2019;s son. You have done these things; and I stood by in silence, so you thought I was the same as you. Therefore I will reprove you, and set them in order before your eyes.&#x201D; &#x201C;You sit and speak against your brother, you slander your own mother&#x2019;s son&#x201D; means that he does so even though he is obliged to love his neighbor, as is commanded of him (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 19:18), &#x201C;you shall love your neighbor as yourself.&#x201D; Man must ask in his prayers for compassion toward his fellow man, but still, he wants to bring accusations against him.</p>
<p>Therefore the Blessed God says, &#x201C;you have done these things, and I stood by in silence.&#x201D; If the blessed God sees fit to clarify matters, then even the actions of the <italic>Tsaddikim</italic> will not be meritorious in His eyes, for in the presence of the blessed God who can justify himself, and who can say, &#x201C;I have refined my heart&#x201D;? And still, the blessed God is silent, not revealing the shame of any man even if he shall sin. You thought that I was the same as you,&#x201D; for he who brings accusations against his fellow man considers himself and his actions as refined as the will of the blessed God. He believes wholeheartedly that it is the will of the blessed God that he should accuse the man who sins. To this grave error the blessed God says, &#x201C;Therefore I will reprove you, and set them in order before your eyes.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This means that the blessed God will show truth to the face of he who points to the guilt of his neighbor and says that it is God&#x2019;s will that he do so. God reproves him by showing that the will of the blessed God is only to conceal all the sins of Israel. Thus is it written (<italic>Micha</italic>, 7:19), &#x201C;and cast all their sins to the depths of the sea.&#x201D; Thus He will conceal them greatly so they will not be revealed and never more seen. So how could one say that the blessed God wants us to expose the guilt of our neighbors, expanding upon their sins? Even though the blessed God commanded man to reprove his neighbor and to try to distance him from all evil as much as is possible, this is only possible in a place where he knows he can help him by bringing him to the good, or through prayer that will arouse compassion upon him to return him to the path of ethical behavior. However, if he cannot remove him from his errors, then he must judge him meritoriously, and not accuse him. Thus one cannot judge his neighbor as guilty, for perhaps his neighbor&#x2019;s <italic>yetser hara</italic> (inclination to evil) is greater than his own. Or, perhaps what he sees as an error or sin is actually permitted to his neighbor, for there are many things that are forbidden to one but permitted to another.</p>
<p>On the same subject, also in <italic>Parshat Behar</italic>, it says the following: &#x201C;A man who sells his house in a walled city,&#x201D; etc. (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 25:29)</p>
<p>The passage dealing with houses in walled cities teaches that man knows that all the matters of the Yovel are in order to make it clear that there is a time for everything. Even if a man sinned against the blessed God, He will not be angry with him forever. This passage teaches that such a situation only arises when a man sins in affairs between him and the Omnipresent. Although this arouses the attribute of stern judgment where he must sell from his portion or be sold as a servant, it shall not be so forever, for he will go out in the Yovel, and a man shall return to his portion. However, a man may arouse the attribute of stern judgment from a sin between man and his fellow man, with the main example of this being if a man sins by shaming his fellow man publicly with his words. This is what the verse meant when it said, &#x201C;if a man shall sell his house in a walled city,&#x201D; for the tongue is called &#x201C;a house in a walled city,&#x201D; as it says (<italic>Arachin</italic>, 15b), &#x201C;I have given you two walls [the lips].&#x201D; By means of this a man could, God forbid, sell and lose all his merits, and his fellow man could buy them. On this Shlomo haMelech said (Mishlei, 25:28), &#x201C;He who cannot control his own spirit is like a city with its walls broken down.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn17">11</xref></sup> The advice given for this is to reconcile with his fellow man within a year, and on this it says, &#x201C;for a full year he shall have the right of redemption.&#x201D; &#x201C;And if it not be redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established forever to him that bought it throughout the generations,&#x201D; meaning that if he does not reconcile with his fellow man, then his merits will permanently remain with his fellow. This is the explanation of the difference between how the verse is spelled in the Torah scroll and how it is read. &#x201C;The house that is in the walled city&#x201D; or &#x201C;the house that has a wall&#x201D; is written in Hebrew, &#x201C;<italic>asher lo homa</italic>.&#x201D; <italic>Lo</italic> is written in Hebrew <italic>Lamed Aleph</italic>, which would mean &#x201C;does not have a wall.&#x201D; However, we read it as if it were written as <italic>Lamed Vav</italic>, &#x201C;which has a wall.&#x201D; The meaning is that a man who has no control over his spirit is called &#x201C;without a wall,&#x201D; and the one who controls his spirit is called one &#x201C;with a wall.&#x201D; Thus it is that all the merits of one who cannot control his spirit will remain in the possession of the one who could control his spirit and remained silent.</p>

<ftnote id="fn10">4. It is the custom among some hasidic communities for the hasid to write his request on a piece of paper and give it to his Rebbe, to pray over the request and advise the hasid. This written request is called a <italic>Kvittle</italic> (pl. <italic>Kvitlach</italic>). <italic>Kvitlach</italic> are even left at the graves of great hasidic Rebbes, in order that the soul of the Rebbe intercede in heaven on behalf of the hasid.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn11">5. A &#x201C;Pidyon,&#x201D; (pl. <italic>Pidyonos</italic>) is a gift of some value given to the Rebbe by a hasid in a time of need, through which in the act of reception the Rebbe prays for the welfare of the one giving it. The ancient belief is that it is decreed that the one giving the <italic>pidyon</italic> must suffer a loss, so the act of giving the gift or money is a transfer of a physical loss for a monetary loss.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn12">6. Shmini Atseret is the eighth day of Succot, marked by dancing with scrolls of the Torah. Seven <italic>hakafot</italic> or dancing circuits are made around and with the Torah scrolls, each <italic>hakafa</italic> in honor of one of the seven &#x201C;shepherds&#x201D; of Israel: Avraham, Yitschok, Yaakov, Moshe, Aharon, Yosef, and David.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn13">7. The one honored to &#x201C;lead the <italic>hakafa</italic>&#x201D; takes the Torah scroll in his arm, and introduces the dancing by chanting a short liturgy. Then when the singing starts, he dances in the center of the circle for a while with a few other friends, while the rest of the congregation rotates around him in a circle dance. After a while he passes the Torah scroll to another to dance with, and so forth.</ftnote>

<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> B<small>ERESHIT</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;In the beginning God created &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 1:1)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Created&#x201D; means strengthening. In the beginning, He strengthened and reinforced the foundations so that they could receive the creation. This is as a king, when he builds his treasure house, he first strengthens the foundations and the walls so they can receive what he places inside it, and the heavens and the earth are the foundations of the universe. They are hinted in man in the brain and the heart. At a time when man wants to proceed according to the will of the blessed God, in order to be a complete facet of creation, then he must invigorate and strengthen these two foundations. In other words, he must deliver over to the blessed God the intellect and thought in the head, and the desires of the heart, and then crown God, may He be blessed, over them, so that they only act according to the will of the blessed God. This is as in the saying of Rabbi Israel, the holy Baal Shem Tov, &#x201C;where a man&#x2019;s thoughts are, that is where he is in his entirety.&#x201D; This is the meaning of the verse in Mishlei (Mishlei, 24:26), &#x201C;My son, give me your heart,&#x201D; and then the continuation of the verse follows of itself, that then, &#x201C;you [your eyes] will want to observe My ways.&#x201D; This means that when you deliver over your heart to the blessed God, then you will make the service of the blessed God your main occupation, and all the matters of this world will be secondary. This can be understood by means of a parable. A rich man has a wise and wonderful son, whom he betroths to a woman fitting for his honor. At the time when he prepares the wedding banquet and tastes of the food that he prepared, at that moment he remembers the joy of his son, and the taste of the food becomes secondary. Understand this.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And God said, &#x2018;Let there be light,&#x2019; and there was light.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 1:3)</p>
<p>It is said in the Midrash (<italic>Bereshit</italic> Rabba, 1:1), &#x201C;Rabbi Ushaya Rabba opened, (Mishlei, 8:30) &#x2018;And I was as one brought up with him, and I delighted in him each day.&#x2019; Ammon, or &#x2018;brought up,&#x2019; means like a tutor.<sup><xref rid="fn18">1</xref></sup> &#x2018;Ammon,&#x2019; he was well covered. &#x2018;Ammon,&#x2019; he was hidden [or well cared for]. There are those who say, &#x2018;Ammon,&#x2019; the name of the capital (in Egypt, Alexandria was once called &#x2018;Ammon&#x2019;).<sup><xref rid="fn19">2</xref></sup> Another interpretation: &#x2018;Ammon&#x2019; is an artisan.&#x201D; These five interpretations of <italic>Ammon</italic> are the same as we find in man, for he goes through five states of being and levels from the beginning of his existence until he comes into his final form of completeness.</p>
<p>At first, at the time of conception by the father and mother, he is completely hidden, and not recognizable to any part of creation. The second state of being is once he has been formed in his mother&#x2019;s womb, then he begins to engender some form of recognition as a separate entity. The third state of being occurs once he is born, and his status as a separate entity is complete, and all can see that he a unique part of creation. The fourth state happens when he is weaned from his mother&#x2019;s breast and begins to act on his own. The fifth level of being begins when he marries a wife and then begins to create new beings, to be built as an everlasting structure, and toward this end was he created. And thus it is, that these five states of being are found in the creation of the world, which come forth from nothing and the completely hidden to the revealed and substantive.</p>
<p>At first it (the creation) was called &#x201C;brought up in secret,&#x201D; for it was included in God&#x2019;s essence, may He be blessed, and there was no recognition of it emanating from Him, may He be blessed, and this was the first state of being. When the creation emanated from the blessed God, and began to move more toward the revealed, then it was in the second state of being, called &#x201C;brought up well covered.&#x201D; This is the secret of the embryonic state, which is well covered. Afterward, it went further into the revealed, called &#x201C;brought up as by a tutor.&#x201D; These three states of being are the first three hidden <italic>sefirot: Keter</italic> (crown), <italic>Chochma</italic> (wisdom), and <italic>Binah</italic> (understanding).<sup><xref rid="fn20">3</xref></sup> The Midrash explains these three <italic>sefirot</italic> from below to above. First, &#x201C;raised as by a tutor&#x201D; is <italic>Binah</italic>, and then &#x201C;raised well covered&#x201D; is <italic>Chochma</italic>, and then &#x201C;raised in secret&#x201D; is <italic>Keter</italic>, which because it is so greatly concealed is called &#x201C;in secret.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Afterward it revealed itself more, called &#x201C;ammon the capital&#x201D; (as the capital is something thoroughly revealed), meaning that the creation began to grow, and this is the secret of being weaned from the mother&#x2019;s breast. Afterward, &#x201C;ammon is an artisan,&#x201D; meaning that the creation emerged into the completely revealed, and (as an artisan) began by itself to bring new beings into the world according to the will of the blessed God. This is why at a wedding we pronounce the blessing &#x201C;who formed man in His image,&#x201D; and not at the time of birth. Even though man is born, he is not yet completely perfected; yet rather when he begins to try to make new beings, and this is when he marries a wife.</p>
<p>And this is the meaning of &#x201C;and the world was <italic>tohu u&#x2019;vohu</italic>, chaos and void,&#x201D; meaning that from the time of conception until the time that the embryo is recognized is called <italic>tohu</italic>, chaos or unformed. Then from the time it is recognized it is called <italic>bohu</italic>, void, meaning that we can see that something is there, yet we do not know what it is. The nine months of pregnancy are called &#x201C;and darkness on the face of the abyss,&#x201D; because at that time there is an expectation and hope to know the end from this, so therefore it is called &#x201C;abyss.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn21">4</xref></sup> &#x201C;And the spirit of God hovered&#x201D; is the time when the woman is giving birth, for at that time both the mother and the baby are closer to death than life, as is said in the Midrash and Gemara (<italic>Vayikra Rabba</italic>, 27:7). &#x201C;And God said, let there be light,&#x201D; meaning when the salvation is completely finished. Here in these verses, &#x201C;let there be light&#x201D; is mentioned five times, corresponding to the five states of being mentioned. The last one is &#x201C;and God called the light day,&#x201D; meaning that with this God completed all the intentions He had with which to create the world.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And God said, let us make a man &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 1:26)</p>
<p>This means that from the beginning God created all the creation, and afterward, the creation understood and recognized that it was lacking, for it had no one to connect its vitality to the blessed God. By means of man, all the facets of this world may be connected to the blessed God, for man raises everything up, as is known. The inanimate enters its power into the vegetation, and the vegetation into the animal, and the animal into the speaking (mankind). Then man, since he serves God with his strength, elevates all the powers he received from this world, even from the inanimate. Then when the creation realized how it was lacking, it effected an awakening from below for the creation of man. &#x201C;God said let us make a man,&#x201D; in other words (&#x201C;let us,&#x201D; for God is addressing all the created beings), the blessed God said to the entire creation that each one should give of its power and join in the creation of man, so that man would then have a portion in all of them. Then if man should need anything they would all stand to help him, for in his evil he could do them harm, as in the generation of the flood, but in his good he could also benefit them.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And thus the heavens and the earth were completed and all their host.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 2:1)</p>
<p>The holy Rav of Pshiske, Reb Simcha Bunem, may the mention of the <italic>Tsaddik</italic> be for a blessing in the world to come (the author&#x2019;s teacher), said that we have no instance in all of the Torah and Scripture where the creation of the earth is called &#x201C;host.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn22">5</xref></sup> Yet from the time that the people Israel came into the world, the earth was also made into the name &#x201C;host.&#x201D; This is the explanation. A host is a multitude that is united under one who unifies them, such as under a king who rules over all of them together. So in the heavens it is conceivable to use the term &#x201C;host,&#x201D; for there His sovereignty and oneness is recognized over the host of Heaven. It is clear that He rules over them and unifies them. Therefore each time it says, &#x201C;the host of heavens.&#x201D; Yet in this world, where the idolaters deny the providence of the Holy One, blessed be He, it is inconceivable to use the term &#x201C;host,&#x201D; regarding them, rather, &#x201C;descendent,&#x201D; (<italic>tse&#x2019;etsaim</italic> in Hebrew). Take for instance (Yesahya 42:5), &#x201C;He has spread forth the earth and all which came out of it [<italic>tse&#x2019;etsaeha</italic>],&#x201D; where &#x201C;what came out of it&#x201D; signifies spreading out. Yet when Israel came to the world and recognized that the blessed God rules over all, publicly proclaiming God&#x2019;s name, then even in this world the land was also called &#x201C;host.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And thus the heavens and the earth were completed and all their host.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 2:1)</p>
<p>It is written in the Gemara (<italic>Shabbat</italic>, 119b), &#x201C;all who say the verse, &#x2018;thus the heavens and the earth were completed,&#x2019; are made a partner with the Holy One, blessed be He, in the act of creation.&#x201D; The matter is, that the main point of the creation of the world was so that Israel could recognize His blessed sovereignty and oneness. In this way Avraham Avinu began to use this new kind of consciousness to call in the name of God, the Lord of the land (not just of the heavens), and each soul in Israel yearns for this. Were it not for this the heavens and the earth would not be able to endure, as we find in the Gemara (<italic>Shabbat</italic>, 88b), &#x201C;It would be well for Israel to receive the Torah, for if not this place will be your graves.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn23">6</xref></sup> Whoever recognizes the blessed God&#x2019;s sovereignty in the world has completed the creation, for here speech is like action. And whoever recognizes the day of Shabbat, and crowns the blessed God over all that He has effected in the six days of creation, even though he is a mere finite and frail mortal compared to the blessed God, nonetheless that man is judged, and the two angels who accompany him, that is, the <italic>yetser hara</italic> and the <italic>yetser tov</italic> (the inclination to evil and the inclination to good), place their hands on his head and say to him, &#x201C;your transgression is removed and your sin is atoned for.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And God caused to sprout from the land every tree pleasant to the sight and good to eat, and the tree of life in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 2:9)</p>
<p>Hinted at in this verse are four trees. &#x201C;Pleasant to the sight&#x201D; corresponds to the <italic>tsaddik</italic> who occupies himself with <italic>mitzvot</italic> and good deeds, which are like a beautiful garment for him and also in the view of his fellow man, like giving charity and guarding the covenant (guarding himself from lust). In the <italic>Pirkei Avot</italic><sup><xref rid="fn24">7</xref></sup> this is called <italic>tiferet l&#x2019;osei&#x2019;ha</italic>, or &#x201C;good [also bringing splendor, bringing honor] for the one who acts in this way,&#x201D; as is explained in its place. The tree that is &#x201C;good to eat&#x201D; means one whose outside appearance is not so beautiful, since he has no great need of strengthening himself in <italic>mitzvot</italic> and good deeds as he is very good in his essence. This is called (ibid.) <italic>tiferet lo min ha&#x2019;adam</italic>, or &#x201C;appreciated<sup><xref rid="fn25">8</xref></sup> by his fellow man,&#x201D; meaning that within him and in the form of his person he is good and beautiful. &#x201C;The tree of knowledge&#x201D; means one who is in a state of constant uncertainty as to the nature of the will of the blessed God, corresponding to all the <italic>eebayot</italic>, the &#x201C;if you want [then say],&#x201D; in the Gemara (either proposing alternate solutions or raising legal problems). &#x201C;The tree of life&#x201D; is true <italic>tshuvah</italic> (return to the way of the Torah), which heals that which came before.</p>
<p>Corresponding to these four trees are the four rivers that irrigate them. The river Pishon waters the tree that is good to eat, for <italic>pishon</italic> denotes greatness and expansion (<italic>PISHon&#x2014;hitPASHtut</italic> or expansion), for whoever is great in his roots may allow himself to expand as much as he wants, for all he does will be the will of the blessed God. This is the river that &#x201C;circles the whole land of Havilla where there is gold.&#x201D; The river Gihon waters the tree that is pleasant to the sight, for &#x201C;Gihon&#x201D; signifies modesty, as in <italic>holech al gichon</italic>, or &#x201C;moving on the belly,&#x201D; that its movements are not recognized; in other words, a <italic>tsaddik</italic> on the surface. This river circles the land of Cush, and he is one who is not yet complete in the depths of his heart and needs to strengthen himself in <italic>mitzvot</italic> and good deeds in order to expunge the refuse from his soul.</p>
<p>The third river is Hidekkel, and it waters the tree of knowledge of good and evil. The Midrash states (<italic>Bereshit</italic> Rabba 16:7), &#x201C;Hidekkel is <italic>Had</italic> [sharp] and <italic>Kal</italic> [light],&#x201D; as one on a narrow bridge who wavers from side to side about to fall, (as mentioned above) like the &#x201C;if you want&#x201D;s in the Gemara. It flows &#x201C;from the east of Ashur,&#x201D; corresponding to the strengths, for &#x201C;Ashur&#x201D; denotes strength,<sup><xref rid="fn26">9</xref></sup> since he remains uncertain whether or not to do, and we have established that &#x201C;all who are in doubt are to follow the stricture.&#x201D; The river Prat (Euphrates) waters the tree of life, as it says in the Gemara (<italic>Bechorot</italic>, 55b), &#x201C;Prat came first [that it was the first river, which then branched out into the other three].&#x201D; In this way it corresponds to masters of <italic>tshuva</italic> (return to Torah), and <italic>tshuva</italic> heals all that came before, namely that which is lacking in us from the day of our birth. So this was the first river to come out of Eden as mentioned in <italic>Bechorot</italic>, meaning <italic>tshuva</italic> that reaches the initial source.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And the gold of that land is good &#x2026;.&#x201D;&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 2:12)</p>
<p>Gold signifies reproof.<sup><xref rid="fn27">10</xref></sup> &#x201C;And there is the bedellium [crystal] and the onyx stone,&#x201D; means that in the land of Israel there is the place of the Holy Temple where there is the true fear of God, hinted at by bedellium. The onyx stone hints at the true love of God, as it is written (Tehillim, 5:8), &#x201C;and I, in Your great kindness, will come to Your house and prostrate myself toward Your holy chamber in the fear of You [<italic>b&#x2019;yirateiCha</italic>].&#x201D; The last letter, &#x201C;<italic>caf</italic>,&#x201D; in <italic>b&#x2019;yirateicha</italic> teaches of the true fear of God. Thus we have in the Mishna <italic>Middot</italic> (3:7), &#x201C;the height of the entrance to the [<italic>ulam</italic>] vestibule in the Holy Temple was 40 [<italic>mem</italic>] cubits, and its width was 20 [<italic>caf</italic>] cubits, and it had five ceiling beams, progressively a cubit longer on each side until the last one was 30 cubits.&#x201D;</p>
<p>We find in the height and width of the vestibule and in the extension of the ceiling beams the letters of <italic>melech</italic> or &#x201C;king.&#x201D; Its height was 40 (<italic>mem</italic>), its width 20 (<italic>caf</italic>), the first beam was 20 (<italic>caf</italic>), and the last 30 (<italic>lamed</italic>). This teaches that from there went forth the true fear of God, as the measurement of the beams hint at the letters of bedellium (<italic>b&#x2019;daloach</italic> in Hebrew). Each one extended a cubit more than the previous one on either side, the first totaling two (<italic>bet</italic>), the second totaling four (<italic>dalet</italic>), the third totaling six (<italic>vav</italic>) and the fourth totaling eight (<italic>het</italic>). The last one was thirty (<italic>lamed</italic>) cubits long (all together spelling <italic>b&#x2019;daloach</italic>). The onyx (<italic>shoham</italic>) stone hints at the love of God, for it is the stone that corresponds to Yosef, who is the <italic>sefirah</italic> of Yesod (foundation), which is filled with Divine effusion (as it receives and collects all the Divine energies from the eight <italic>sefirot</italic> above it).</p>
<p>Thus in the holy Zohar, when it wants to say that also in the (third) <italic>sefirah</italic> of <italic>Binah</italic> (understanding, above in the hidden intellectual faculties) there is joy and the effusion of blessing, it does so by comparing it to Yesod. There it is written (Zohar <italic>Shemot</italic>, 135b), &#x201C;Baruch in <italic>barchu</italic> brings blessing from the source of life, the place which brings forth all the saturation to water everything [which is <italic>Yesod</italic> of <italic>Binah</italic>. <italic>Sulam</italic>]. Since it is the source which effuses in the secret of the sign of the <italic>brit milah</italic> [<italic>Yesod</italic> of <italic>Zeir Anpin</italic>] it is called &#x2018;hamevurach,&#x2019; the spring flowing from the well [<italic>Binah</italic>].&#x201D; This is not within mortal power to apprehend, for there is only blessing with something that is hidden from the eye. In a place where you find <italic>Binah</italic> it is inconceivable to use the term <italic>bracha</italic>, blessing, for it understands everything.<sup><xref rid="fn28">11</xref></sup> Yet with the blessed God, &#x201C;<italic>haBina vehaBracha lechai olamim</italic>,&#x201D; &#x201C;understanding and blessing to the Life of all the worlds [which is God].&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And God commanded man, saying, from all the trees in the garden you may surely eat. And from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil do not eat &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 2:16&#x2013;17)</p>
<p>In the future, when the sin of Adam will be fixed, then the verse will be rearranged, &#x201C;from all the trees in the garden you may surely eat and from the tree of the knowledge of good,&#x201D; and after that the next verse will begin, &#x201C;And evil do not eat.&#x201D; Meaning to eat the good in the tree and not to eat the evil. And the blessed God will make it clear that he only ate the good, and the sin was only in His mind as insignificant as a peel of garlic, and no more.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; I will make him a helper opposite him.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 2:18)</p>
<p>The explanation of the matter is, that it is the will of the blessed Creator that help should emerge for man from that which is opposite him, like a student and teacher.<sup><xref rid="fn29">12</xref></sup> We find this in the Gemara (<italic>Baba Metsia</italic>, 84b) with Reb Shimon ben Lakish who would raise twenty-four difficulties in the argument of Reb Yochanan, and he would return with twenty-four possible solutions, and by means of this the law would be clarified and settled. After Reish Lakish died, Reb Elazar would respond to Reb Yochanan with &#x201C;there is a teaching that supports your words.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn30">13</xref></sup> For it is by means of seeing how one is challenged that he may strengthen his words with greater proofs, and thus his words will come well into being.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;[said the snake to the woman] Did God say to you do not eat &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 3:1)</p>
<p>&#x201C;The Torah of God is perfect, restoring the soul.&#x201D; This is like returning a lost article, for the Torah was given to restore the lack imprinted in man from the day of his birth. So when it was said to Adam, &#x201C;and from the tree of knowledge do not eat,&#x201D; the snake jumped on this for thus it is the way of one who hates another to bring out the lack within the one he hates and to trap him in his imperfection. When man was forbidden from eating from the tree of knowledge it was because he had a deficiency in this particular kind of eating. Truly, Adam was also frightened in that it was even necessary for the blessed God to draw this boundary for him, as will be explained, so therefore the snake jumped at the opportunity and caused him to fail. Similarly we find (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 25:11), &#x201C;when two people are struggling &#x2026; and she grabs hold of his shame.&#x201D; Here one shames his peer with the deficiency within him, and he is shamed in it. Therefore the law is, &#x201C;and cut off her hand,&#x201D; which really means to take from the one who put the other to shame all his merits, and give them to the shamed, for everywhere it says, <italic>&#x201C;Caf&#x201D;</italic> or &#x201C;hand,&#x201D; it really means right hand, or merits (<italic>Menachot</italic>, 9b). So too is the judgment here on the snake, for it was cursed to walk on its belly, meaning that its hands were cut off (see Rashi), since it deceitfully directed Adam haRishon&#x2019;s deficiency against him.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Adam said, the woman who You gave to be with me gave me of the tree &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 3:12)</p>
<p>This is truly the mistake of Adam haRishon and his sin. The blessed God said, &#x201C;I will make him a helper opposite him,&#x201D; since when Adam was forbidden from eating from the tree, he became greatly frightened. He said to himself, &#x201C;certainly the blessed God made this forbidden to me only because He knows that I am deficient.&#x201D; Then when the blessed God created Chava (Eve) and gave her to him as a helper, meaning that he would go according to her understanding, just as we find with Avraham Avinu (<italic>Bereshit</italic> 21:12), &#x201C;everything that Sarah tells you, you are to listen to her.&#x201D; Adam&#x2019;s mind became calm. Adam understood that &#x201C;the woman who You gave to be with me&#x201D; meant that it would be permitted to eat if she said it was. The matter of his sin concerns what is written in the Gemara (<italic>Kiddushin</italic>, 70b), &#x201C;if someone teaches a law, if he teaches it before he does an action pertaining to it, you listen to him.</p>
<p>&#x201C;However, if he does it pertaining to an action that he has just done, do not listen to him,&#x201D; for maybe he is just saying it to justify the action he has just done. So it is here, that even though he was supposed to listen to the woman, nonetheless since she had just done the action, he shouldn&#x2019;t have listened to her when she gave him to eat. Her claim was &#x201C;the snake tricked me, and I ate,&#x201D; that he brought seduction and lust into her heart. The snake&#x2019;s explanation was that desire comes from the blessed God. And truly, Adam himself gave the name &#x201C;nachash [snake],&#x201D; to the snake, meaning a cheat, which is <italic>m&#x2019;nachesh</italic>, a diviner, beguiling and hypocritical, one who deceives another into thinking that something is from God. As such (knowing the nature of the snake who he named himself), he should have guarded himself more not to falter, since he knew that there was a mistake.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Thorn and thistle will it sprout for you &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 3:18)</p>
<p>The matter of this curse is &#x201C;thorn,&#x201D; evil ones who will stand from it. &#x201C;Thistle [<italic>dardar</italic>],&#x201D; concerns all the controversies among <italic>tsaddikim</italic>, even the true controversies written in the Gemara, for thistle (<italic>dardar</italic>) is the numerical equivalent of two times &#x201C;<italic>tsaddik</italic>&#x201D; (408).</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;[God to Cain] If you do well, will it not be raised?&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 4:7)</p>
<p>The first sin emerged in the world from the power of jealousy. Even though it seems clear that Cain had a reasonable complaint, for he was the one in whose spirit it first arose to bring a sacrifice. It seemed to Cain that his brother Hevel, who brought a sacrifice afterward, was doing it because it was just expected of him. Therefore Cain had a great and angry complaint against the blessed God. Yet in truth Hevel waited to bring his sacrifice until he understood the reason and even the secret of the <italic>avodah</italic> (service); therefore it is not considered as if he was just bringing the sacrifice because his brother did. Therefore God appeared to Cain and asked him why he is so angry and despondent, for if Cain had no legitimate claim, the blessed God would not have appeared to him. In other words, if you improve your heart to yearn for an accepted <italic>avodah</italic>, without any jealousy or selfish motives, then it will be raised, or rather, elevated in your levels to the highest heights. &#x201C;Raise&#x201D; or <italic>seit</italic> in Hebrew signifies the priesthood, as in (<italic>Vayikra</italic> 9:22), &#x201C;<italic>Vayisa Aharon</italic>,&#x201D; &#x201C;and Aharon raised,&#x201D; meaning that you will serve according to your own yearning, but not according to the level of your brother, for each man has a level unto himself.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and if you do not to well, sin crouches at the entrance.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 4:7)</p>
<p>The only time that man is given to return to the blessed God is while he is still alive, for then the sin is not yet established as permanent, and he may still return. Yet, &#x201C;at the entrance,&#x201D; meaning when the vitality is drained from man, then &#x201C;the sin crouches,&#x201D; and he can no longer get up. This is as we find in the Gemara (<italic>Baba Batra</italic>, 74a), &#x201C;Now the congregation of Korach are constantly saying, &#x2018;Moshe is true and the Torah is true,&#x2019; but it does not save them from <italic>gehinom</italic>.&#x201D; For their words are not coming from the depths of their hearts, for the attitude that one has in this world stays with him forever. If they had said in their lifetimes, &#x201C;Moshe is true and the Torah is true,&#x201D; then they would have been saved.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;This is the book of the generations of man, in the day that God created man, in His image [</italic>D&#x2019;mut<italic>] &#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 5:1)</p>
<p>The secret of the matter of form (henceforth <italic>tselem</italic>) and image (henceforth <italic>d&#x2019;mut</italic>). <italic>Tselem</italic> means the body of life without any expansion, like an infant, immediately when he is born, at the first moment he is called <italic>tselem</italic>. Afterward, when his desires begin to expand, such as wanting various foods, and by means of that desire he eats, and his life grows each time more and more, until he becomes large of thickness and stature, this kind of expansion is called <italic>d&#x2019;mut</italic>. And so it is in the soul, that the first drop of the words of Torah that enters into man is called <italic>tselem</italic>, and the desire with which he yearns for the words of Torah is called <italic>d&#x2019;mut</italic>, for by means of this desire he adds each time more words of Torah. This is why it says, &#x201C;On the day that God created man, in the <italic>d&#x2019;mut</italic> of God He created him,&#x201D; meaning that the main point in creating man was in order that he should desire each time a great increase of the words of Torah. This is the meaning of (<italic>Berachot</italic>, 7b), &#x201C;the service of the Torah is greater than its study,&#x201D; for the service of the Torah is called the desire. This is the meaning of &#x201C;this is the book of the generations of man,&#x201D; meaning that if man merits being in the <italic>tselem</italic> and <italic>d&#x2019;mut</italic>, as explained, he will then constantly see a renewal of the words of Torah. He will then count many years and generations, seeing the length of days.</p>

<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> N<small>OACH</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;These are the generations of Noach &#x2026; Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 4:9&#x2013;14)</p>
<p>Concerning the ark, the blessed God gave Noach advice and protection until the days of wrath would pass, and similarly all whose hearts are not yet refined can receive advice from the ark as to how to find refuge and protection from all the evil that unsettles the world. Thus we find in the words of our sages (<italic>Tanna Dvei Eliyahu Rabba</italic>, Ch. 6), &#x201C;If a man sees that suffering is coming upon him, he is to run to the inner chambers of the Torah, and it will give him advice as to how to survive.&#x201D; The matter of the ark has to do with what is written in the Gemara (<italic>Pesachim</italic>, 113b), &#x201C;There are three whom the Holy One, blessed be He, loves&#x2014;one who does not get angry, one who does not get drunk, and one who forgives.&#x201D;</p>
<p>One who does not get angry is one who does not show any anger through actions. One who does not get drunk is one who possesses a settled mind, recognizing and believing in the Creator of the world. One who forgives means one who removes the anger from his heart, not leaving in his heart any angry complaints against his fellow man. The ark hints at these three aspects. &#x201C;Make yourself an ark of gopher wood&#x201D; means not to get angry, for gopher &#x003D; <italic>gaphrit</italic> &#x003D; brimstone &#x003D; anger (cf. Rashi, ad. loc.), and making an ark out of it, that is, a closed structure, meaning to close the anger inside and not let it be revealed in any external actions. &#x201C;Make rooms in the ark&#x201D; (teaches of order); in other words, not to be drunk (in a state of disorder), but rather to have a settled consciousness, for one who has many rooms must have a sense of order to know the location of each one and its function. And also the order of the Mishna called <italic>Kanim</italic>, teaches of this.<sup><xref rid="fn31">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Therefore one who does not possess a settled consciousness and a pure heart cannot understand in their true form the depth of the words of Torah in the order of Kanim. &#x201C;Seal it from within and without with pitch.&#x201D; That is, do away with all anger and forgive. &#x201C;Sealing with pitch&#x201D; or &#x201C;<italic>ve&#x2019;chaparta</italic>&#x201D; in Hebrew is comprised of the same letters as &#x201C;atonement,&#x201D; <italic>capora</italic>, meaning to atone from the depth of your heart, so as not to leave even a residue of the anger against your fellow man. From the measurements of the ark we may derive the word for tongue, <italic>lashon</italic> (<italic>Lamed Shin Nun</italic>) in Hebrew. &#x201C;Three hundred cubits in length [<italic>Shin</italic>], fifty in width [<italic>Nun</italic>], and thirty in height [<italic>Lamed</italic>],&#x201D; meaning not to have a lying tongue. Also, these measurements teach of the way of service commanded in the <italic>Shema</italic>.</p>
<p>&#x201C;With all your heart,&#x201D; or <italic>Levaveicha</italic>, is <italic>Lamed</italic>. &#x201C;With all your soul,&#x201D; or <italic>nafsheicha</italic>, is <italic>Nun</italic>. &#x201C;With all your possessions&#x201D; or <italic>me&#x2019;odeicha</italic> is <italic>Shin</italic>, or three hundred, for &#x201C;possessions&#x201D; or &#x201C;much,&#x201D; means all one may estimate in his mind and increase, and the most one may comprehend is hinted at in the letter <italic>Shin</italic>, the last letter in our ability to fathom. <italic>Shin</italic> is the penultimate letter in the alphabet. The secret of the final letter of the alphabet, <italic>Tav</italic>, is hidden in the world to come. Furthermore, whenever the sages wanted to express a very large amount they said three hundred (<italic>Shin</italic>), as in (<italic>Chullin</italic> 90b), &#x201C;three hundred <italic>kor</italic>,&#x201D; or the three hundred <italic>Cohanim</italic> in the Mishnaic order <italic>Middot</italic> (Ch. 3, Mishna 8). &#x201C;Make a light for the ark&#x201D; means to know that everything is in God&#x2019;s hands, for light stands for clarity and knowledge. &#x201C;Complete it to a cubit from above&#x201D; means to constrict one&#x2019;s self in all receptions of Divine effluence, so as not to be greedy.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Place an entrance on the side of the ark,&#x201D; in other words, similar to the explanation of the Midrash on the verse (<italic>Bamidbar</italic> Rabba, Ch. 19:16; Tehillim, 34:15), &#x201C;seek peace and run after it&#x2014;seek peace from your own place, and run after it&#x2014;from a different place.&#x201D; This means that as far as you are concerned, do not create any obstacles to peace, yet also to run after your fellow man, to bring yourself close to him. Yet this too is not always necessary, for in everything there is an amount of uncertainty, for it could be that this one is not fit to bring into your house, yet to repulse him is also not permitted, so this is the explanation of &#x201C;place the entrance on the side,&#x201D; meaning not in a readily apparent way. &#x201C;Make lower second and third sublevels,&#x201D; meaning that Noach was commanded to know how to conduct himself with his three sons, each according to his level.</p>
<p>With Ham according to his level, which is &#x201C;lower level,&#x201D; meaning to speak to him only plainly, face to face. With Yaphet, &#x201C;second,&#x201D; and <italic>Shem</italic>, &#x201C;third,&#x201D; meaning to speak to him from the depth of your heart and to reveal to him all your secrets. All these were advice for Noach as to how to conceal himself before he had achieved completion, for immediately upon leaving the ark he had achieved completion, and then he proceeded to do the opposite of what was advised to him, as it says, &#x201C;and he drank and became drunk.&#x201D; Then he became angry with Ham, not exercising patience. For when one achieves completion then it is permitted for him to extend himself, for then all is according to the will of the blessed God.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And he sent out the raven, which went back and forth &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 8:7)</p>
<p>The raven hints at anger. Noach wanted to rid the world of the attribute of anger, yet the Holy One, blessed be He, showed him that there was still a need for the attribute of anger in the world, for sometimes when an evil desire comes to man he may save himself by entering into a state of anger. This is the meaning of the verse, &#x201C;the raven went back and forth until the waters dried from the land,&#x201D; in other words, until evil lusts will be eradicated, and then there will be no need for anger, for water represents lust. Therefore in the Holy Temple there was a small hint of this, for there was an &#x201C;<italic>ama caleh oreiv</italic>&#x201D; (Mishna <italic>Middot</italic>, 4:6), a sharpened plate on the roof one cubit high that prevented ravens from roosting there (representing the eventual eradication of anger).</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and God said in His heart, I will no longer curse the earth because of man &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit 8:21)</p>
<p>This thought of the blessed God was known to Noach, since great fear was imprinted in his heart after the flood, which let him understand that it is not befitting man to extend himself as much as he wants, but must rather curb his spirit. From this he understood that similarly it is the will of the blessed God not to curse the land again.<sup><xref rid="fn32">15</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And shall be fruitful and multiply, swarm in the earth, and multiply therein.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 9:7)</p>
<p>The Midrash (<italic>Bereshit</italic> Rabba, 34:21) relates the following story concerning this. &#x201C;A disciple of R. Yossi was sitting before him and could not comprehend what he was explaining to him. &#x2018;Why can&#x2019;t you grasp it?&#x2019; he asked. &#x2018;Because I am an exile from home,&#x2019; he replied. &#x2018;Where are you from?&#x2019; he asked. &#x2018;From Gabat Shanimai,&#x2019; he answered. &#x2018;What is the climate like there?&#x2019; he asked. &#x2018;When a child is born there we have to crush spices and smear his head with it, lest insects should eat him,&#x2019; he replied. &#x2018;Blessed is He who inspires the inhabitants of a place with love for it&#x0021;&#x2019; he exclaimed. In the future too it will be thus: And I will take away the heart of stone from your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh&#x2014;<italic>lev basar</italic> (<italic>Yechezkel</italic>, 36:26), meaning, a heart which has no desire of [boser] his neighbor&#x2019;s portion.&#x201D; For the sin of the generation of the flood was envy, where everyone had an evil eye on the portion of his neighbor. On this, God said to Noach, &#x201C;and you shall swarm in the land,&#x201D; for &#x201C;swarming,&#x201D; <italic>shratsu</italic> in Hebrew, indicates smallness, like the interpretation of Rashi <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> on the phrase, &#x201C;swarming creature&#x201D; (on <italic>Bereshit</italic> 1:20, where he says, &#x201C;every living thing that is not high from the ground is called <italic>sherets</italic>&#x201D;). So this is &#x201C;swarm in the land,&#x201D; meaning to make do with the small portion given to you, and not to be jealous of the portion of your neighbor. &#x201C;And increase therein&#x201D; means that from your own portion you will obtain greater delights each time, and in it you will be able to experience expansion.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And it shall be when I bring clouds over the earth, then the rainbow will appear in the cloud.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 9:14)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Cloud&#x201D; signifies fear and the concealment of His presence. &#x201C;Rainbow&#x201D; (or simply &#x201C;bow&#x201D;) signifies a stronghold. For with an onslaught of fear you shall have great security, and this is what the Holy One, blessed be He, promised to Noach. This is as it is said in the holy Zohar (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 72b), &#x201C;do not expect the heels [arrival] of the Messiah until you see the luminous colors of the rainbow.&#x201D; This means that once the great strengths of the blessed God are apparent and explicit before your eyes, then you may expect the arrival of the Messiah. This is seen in the question of R. Shimon bar Yochai to R. Yehoshua ben Levi (<italic>Ketubot</italic>, 77b):</p>
<p align="blockquote">As Yehoshua ben Levi proceeded on his way he found R. Shimon bar Yochai sitting on thirteen tables of gold. &#x201C;Are you,&#x201D; R. Shimon asked him, &#x201C;the son of Levi?&#x201D; &#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; he replied. &#x201C;Has a rainbow ever appeared in your lifetime?&#x201D; &#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; he replied. &#x201C;If that is true then you are not the son of Levi&#x201D; (for the rainbow was a sign that God would not again destroy the world, which should not have been necessary in the generation of a <italic>Tsaddik</italic>, for the <italic>Tsaddik</italic>&#x2019;s merits alone should be enough to save the generation. See Rashi). The fact is that there was no such thing, but he thought, &#x201C;I may not take credit for myself.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rabbi Shimon specifically asked him, &#x201C;has the rainbow appeared [&#x201C;<italic>nirata</italic>,&#x201D; just as it is worded in the verse],&#x201D; and not &#x201C;have you seen,&#x201D; for the meaning of &#x201C;appeared&#x201D; means occasionally but not constantly. Yet for Rebbi Shimon, the rainbow appeared constantly. The &#x201C;rainbow,&#x201D; and the great strengths of Israel, is the passage &#x201C;<italic>Shema&#x2019;</italic> Yisroel, Hear O Israel,&#x201D; which strengthens the hearts of those who yearn for His mercies.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And it was, that the whole earth was of one language and one speech.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 11:1)</p>
<p>The verse is formulated &#x201C;one language&#x201D; (&#x201C;one lip,&#x201D; <italic>sfat echad</italic>) and not &#x201C;one tongue&#x201D; (<italic>lashon echad</italic>). This is because the principal tongue is the holy tongue (the Hebrew of the Tanach [Bible]), for the holy tongue comes from what is imprinted in the depths of the heart, where all the other languages are called &#x201C;stammering.&#x201D; Thus is it written (Yesahya, 33:19), &#x201C;of a stammering tongue, of no understanding,&#x201D; meaning that it has no root of life in its heart for understanding is in the heart. With the generation of the division of mankind (builders of the tower of Babel), even though they spoke in the holy tongue, they nonetheless did not have (or speak from) the root of life, but only spoke from the lip outward. With them, speech was more like the chirping of birds and other animals.<sup><xref rid="fn33">16</xref></sup> Similarly it is with the snake, of which all the commentaries asked why it was not cursed with having its tongue removed (only its legs removed), but truly it did not have a tongue at its source, since it spoke <italic>lashon hara</italic> (evil speech) against its Creator. Understand this.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And the days of Terach were two hundred and five years. And Terach died in Haran.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 11:32)</p>
<p>Rashi explains (why Terach&#x2019;s death is mentioned here, at the end of <italic>Parshat Noach</italic>, and not when he actually died, after Avraham has set off for Canaan) that this is so Avraham will not be criticized for not fulfilling the commandment of honoring his father. It is said in the Midrash (<italic>Bereshit</italic> Rabba, 39:7), &#x201C;The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Avraham, you are exempt from honoring your father.&#x201D; The blessed God had also established a covenant with Noach, but He did not establish a covenant with Noach in the way that He established a covenant with Avraham Avinu. With Noach, the blessed God also established a covenant as a matter of conduct or action in the world (<italic>derech erets</italic>), as is explained above (see, &#x201C;and God said in Heart&#x201D;) where He says, &#x201C;and I will establish My covenant with you and not destroy the world.&#x201D; This is because after the terror of the flood Noach accepted upon himself not to extend himself as much as he wanted, and also the blessed God agreed not to destroy the world.</p>
<p>This being so, Noach began to involve himself in the actions of this world, as he was a great sage in the wisdom of the world (farming, etc.). However, he was not yet included in the realm of the words of Torah. The establishment of the covenant with Avraham Avinu was in the words of Torah, and he did not have to involve himself in the actions of the world, for actions of the word (<italic>derech erets</italic>, or conduct) precede the Torah. Therefore he did not have to fulfill the mitzvah of honoring his father. One who is involved in Torah does not have to be engrossed in matters of conduct in the world, for (if he is truly involved in Torah) than proper conduct will be inherent in everything he does, even unconsciously. Therefore it says, &#x201C;and Terach died in Haran,&#x201D; for &#x201C;the evil are called dead even while they are alive.&#x201D;</p>
<p>With the ten generations from Adam until Noach (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, Ch. 5) it is said with each one, &#x201C;and he lived &#x2026; and all his days were &#x2026;&#x201D; With the ten generations from Noach until Avraham (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, Ch. 10) it does not say &#x201C;and all his days were.&#x201D; This can be understood through the verse (Mishlei, 23:24), &#x201C;The father of a <italic>Tsaddik</italic> will greatly rejoice, and he who gives birth to a sage shall take joy in him.&#x201D; With the sage, it does not say &#x201C;the father&#x201D; as it says &#x201C;the father of the <italic>Tsaddik</italic>.&#x201D; The matter is, that when a man gives birth to a <italic>Tsaddik</italic>, then the father has a connection to him, for the level of <italic>Tsidkut</italic>&#x2014;righteousness&#x2014;that is active in the son exists in a hidden way with the father. Yet when a sage is born to him, meaning wise in the words of Torah, then he is a completely new birth, and the son has no connection to the father, for he is a new entity. Therefore it does not say with the sage, &#x201C;the father will take joy,&#x201D; for he is no more connected to the father than the rest of the world. It says only &#x201C;shall take joy in him,&#x201D; meaning that the whole world will take joy in him, and they will no longer be involved with the father, only with him. For the sage is born of the words of Torah, and then the whole world rejoices, becoming involved with the son but not with the father.</p>
<p>Therefore, with the ten generations from Adam until Noach, it says &#x201C;and all his days were,&#x201D; even though he had already fathered a son, therefore it is fitting to remain involved with the father. Because &#x201C;Noach was a righteous man [<italic>Tsaddik</italic>],&#x201D; and still has a connection to his father. However, with the ten generations from Noach until Avraham, it does not say &#x201C;and all his days were,&#x201D; for Avraham Avinu was a sage in the words of Torah, as we say, that he fulfilled the entire Torah before it was given. Therefore he has no connection to his father, so then after each generation fathered a son the verse does not go back and deal with the father, saying &#x201C;and all his days were,&#x201D; for it is no longer necessary to deal with the father, but only to take joy in the son.</p>

<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And God said to Avram, get yourself from your country &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 12:1)</p>
<p>It is written (Yesahya, 44:3), &#x201C;When I will pour water on the thirsty, and drip moisture on the dry lands, thus I will pour My Spirit &#x2026;.&#x201D; Avraham Avinu began to investigate and seek after the own source of his life, for he realized that it is inconceivable that all the lusts of this world could be called true life, for all this-worldly desires and lusts only serve to remove the numerous anxieties and obstacles we face. Then once all the anxieties have been negated, what will be the true core of life upon which the world was created? Concerning this the blessed God said to him, &#x201C;<italic>Lech L&#x2019;cha</italic>,&#x201D; move yourself forward, meaning to yourself, to your true source, for truly all the matters of this world cannot be termed &#x201C;life,&#x201D; and the main point of life you shall find in yourself. &#x201C;You will rejoice in God, in the holy One of Israel you will glory&#x201D; (Yesahya, 41:16), this is The life.</p>
<p>On this it is written in the Midrash (<italic>Bereshit</italic> Rabba, Ch. 39:1), &#x201C;Rabbi Yitschok said a parable. A traveler was passing from place to place, and saw a city burning in flames. He said, &#x2018;shall you say that this city has no master?&#x2019; The master of the city glanced upon him and said, &#x2018;I am the master of the city.&#x2019; So it was that since our forefather Avraham said, &#x2018;shall you say that this world has no master?&#x2019; the Holy One, blessed be He, glanced upon him and said, &#x2018;I am the master of the world.&#x2019;&#x201D; At first glance it would seem that the Midrash should have said &#x201C;He looked unto him,&#x201D; and not &#x201C;upon him.&#x201D; However, when our forefather Avraham saw the actions of the generation of the tower of Babel (who thought they could overthrow God Himself), which is the meaning of the city burning in flames, it was a great wonder in his eyes, and pondering who could create this disturbed his soul. Then the master of the city glanced upon him, meaning that the Holy One, blessed be He, answered him, &#x201C;Do you not see by yourself that the whole world is not stumped by this difficulty, and there is not one among them who considered asking who made this. Yet for you it is a wonder. From the very infuriation of your heart you may estimate that certainly there must be a Creator who suffers the entire world, and permeates the entire world, and He is the one who awakened your heart to this.&#x201D; And this is the specific use of &#x201C;upon you,&#x201D; meaning that from your very question you yourself managed to come up with a sufficient answer.</p>
<p>More on the same Midrash. &#x201C;He saw a city burning in flames, and began to ask, &#x2018;could it be that this city has no master?&#x2019; So the master of the city glanced upon him &#x2026;.&#x201D; Concerning this, when Avraham Avinu began to contemplate the great changes that swept the world with the generation of the flood and the generation of the tower of Babel, he then became deeply agitated in his heart in order to understand who created these. The Holy One, blessed be He, answered him that the portion of Jacob was different from the rest of the world. It is the way of the nations that when they see a major change in the management of the world, then they begin to amend their ways and want to understand the reason for the change. Yet when the world runs according to the way of nature (without any apparent changes), then none among them take it upon themselves to understand, for they do not believe in the blessed God to the extent that the ways of nature are also in His hands. They do not know that without Him nothing has dominion in the world. Yet the portion of Jacob are not like these, for we recognize that He has formed all, meaning that Israel believes that were the blessed God not to suffer the world (and all its imperfections), then nothing would be able to exist even for a moment. Thus it is, when Avraham Avinu wanted to apprehend his Creator based on changes in the natural order, the blessed God said to him, &#x201C;<italic>Lech L&#x2019;cha</italic>, get thee away,&#x201D; meaning to the portion of Jacob who recognizes that even the natural order of things are a product of God&#x2019;s greatness. (As in the saying of the holy Baal Shem Tov on <italic>hasgacha pratit</italic> [individual providence], &#x201C;He sees everything, He knows everything. He knows how many times the leaf will turn over in the dust before the wind comes to take it away.&#x201D; Betsalel.)</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Get yourself from your land &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 12:1)</p>
<p>Meaning, from your place. Avraham Avinu was renowned throughout the entire world for his great wisdom, and there was no other sage like him knowledgeable in all manners of wisdom, as the Midrash states (Gemara <italic>Yoma</italic>, 28b), &#x201C;his heart possessed a great knowledge of astronomy [and astrology. All the kings of the east and west would arrive early at his door to inquire about the constellations. See Rashi ad. loc.].&#x201D; There was a need for this since he was the first vessel that the Holy One, blessed be He, used to reveal His presence in the world, and corresponding to this He said, &#x201C;Get yourself from your land [and reveal this new consciousness in the world].&#x201D; (The verse continues) &#x201C;And from your place of birth,&#x201D; in other words, to get away from his habits, and in this he was tested with the incident, &#x201C;and there was a famine &#x2026;&#x201D; (<italic>Bereshit</italic> 12:10). This is as it is written in the small tractate <italic>Sofrim</italic> (Ch. 21, <italic>halacha</italic> 9), &#x201C;[Avraham was as tall as seventy-four men] and he ate as much as seventy-four men.&#x201D; This command of the blessed God was in order that he would make great clarifications to refine his eating, for the later generations of Avraham Avinu would eat in a place of holiness, as among his descendants would be the <italic>Cohanim</italic> in the Holy Temple who ate only the <italic>kodshei shamayim</italic>, leftovers of the animals sacrificed to Heaven.</p>
<p>&#x201C;From your father&#x2019;s house.&#x201D; In other words, not to look at the way things seem at first glance but rather into the root of the matter. This corresponds to the whole incident of &#x201C;please separate from me,&#x201D; which he said to Lot (to resolve the conflict between the shepherds of Avraham and the shepherds of Lot). Lot was very similar to Avraham in appearance, which means that in any situation Lot acted like Avraham (on the surface). Then the blessed God Himself looked and &#x201C;smelled&#x201D; his actions, which were not good, and accordingly sent an illumination to the heart of Avraham to separate from him, not to heed his wisdom or actions, for they are not coming from the depth of his heart. This is like the Gemara&#x2019;s explanation of the verse (<italic>Hoshea</italic>, 14:10), &#x201C;Who is wise and will understand these things? Who is brilliant enough to know them? For the ways of God are direct and honest &#x2026;&#x201D; (<italic>Nazir</italic>, 23a), &#x201C;concerning Lot and his daughters, &#x2018;for the ways of God are straightforward.&#x2019;&#x201D; Even though it seemed that they had lust like their father Lot, the blessed God testified that it was not like the lust of their father, and even though it was favorable in Avraham&#x2019;s eyes to be connected to Lot, the blessed God commanded him to distance himself from him.</p>
<p>&#x201C;To the land which I will show you&#x201D; corresponds to the section dealing with the wars of the Canaanite kings, for there the blessed God showed him all the secrets. It would seem that he should not have saved Lot, for the nations that would later oppress Israel would come from his descendants, and further we are commanded, &#x201C;an Ammonite shall not enter into congregation &#x2026;&#x201D; It seems as if no good would come out of their association with Israel. The Holy One, blessed be He, showed him that their women would be permitted immediately, and from their offspring would come the kingdom of David and Shlomo, as is explained that he only went to save two good offshoots (Ruth and Naomi. Lot&#x2019;s daughters would give birth to Moab, and thus Ruth, and then King David&#x2019;s line. <italic>Baba Batra</italic>, 38b).</p>
<p>&#x201C;And I will make you a great nation&#x201D; corresponds to the section that announces that he will have children, where it says, &#x201C;I will be a shield for you.&#x201D; &#x201C;And I will bless you&#x201D; corresponds to the section on Yishmael. &#x201C;And I will make your name great&#x201D; corresponds to the additional <italic>Hei</italic> added in his name. The first <italic>Hei</italic> in the Tetragrammaton was added to Avraham&#x2019;s name, and it signifies cleaving to the life of the world to come. Whereas added to Yoseph&#x2019;s name (Yehoseph) was the second <italic>Hei</italic> in God&#x2019;s name, which signifies the wisdom of conduct in this world, as is said in the Midrash (<italic>Bereshit</italic> Rabba, Ch. 89:8), &#x201C;five [<italic>hei</italic>] sages are established in each nation.&#x201D; &#x201C;And it shall be for a blessing&#x201D; means that he will be a vessel of reception to receive more and more each time, and this corresponds to the beginning of the next <italic>Parsha</italic>, &#x201C;<italic>Vayeira eilav</italic>,&#x201D; &#x201C;And God appeared unto him.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; to the land which I will show you.&#x201D;</italic></p>
<p>For Avraham Avinu desired to know the place where his life essence was intensely joined to the blessed God, and how far it reached. Thus God responded to him, &#x201C;to the land which I will show you,&#x201D; meaning that your intense union will be in a place called &#x201C;which I will show you.&#x201D; For He has no end, and will always increase the lights of the blessed Infinite more and more for you, and this you will find in the land of Israel.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and there he built an altar to Hashem, and he called in the name of Hashem.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 12:8)</p>
<p>The first test Avraham Avinu encountered was &#x201C;<italic>lech l&#x2019;cha</italic>,&#x201D; &#x201C;get thee away.&#x201D; This represents poverty and constriction (that the journey would cause), for it must be first clarified in man that he will not hold angry complaints against the blessed God, God forbid. Rather he should ask of the blessed God that He not bring him into dire straits, God forbid, which would cause a man to go against the way of his Owner. Poverty means one who is not happy with his portion but rather seeks excessive luxury, and for this he must ask from the blessed God that he not covet luxury. As it is said of Yaakov (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 25:27), &#x201C;Yaakov was a simple man,&#x201D; meaning that he was complete in his soul without any desire for excesses, just accepting with love according to the will of the blessed Creator. Thus was the prayer of Avraham Avinu at his first test, that he be happy with his portion and not experience any dire poverty, and this is the meaning of &#x201C;and he called in the name of God,&#x201D; meaning that poverty not divert him from the way of his Owner. Therefore when he returned from Egypt it was said, &#x201C;and Avram was very heavy [with cattle and silver and gold]&#x201D; (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 13:2).</p>
<p>This means that after he was clarified concerning poverty with a complete <italic>birrur</italic> (clarification) through his first test, it is said, &#x201C;very heavy,&#x201D; an expression related to seriousness. He feared in his soul concerning wealth, like the prayer of King Shlomo (Mishlei, 30:8), &#x201C;give me neither poverty or riches.&#x201D; And with Lot the expression <italic>kaved</italic>, &#x201C;heavy,&#x201D; is not used. Rather it says, &#x201C;and Lot, who went with Avraham, had sheep,&#x201D; etc., and &#x201C;had&#x201D; (<italic>haya</italic>) always signifies rejoicing, for he had no fear whatsoever. This was not so with Avraham where it is written &#x201C;heavy,&#x201D; because of his fear. Therefore it is written (directly after this), &#x201C;and he went on his journeys &#x2026; and there he called in the name of Hashem&#x201D; (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 8:3&#x2013;4), for also here he feared from wealth, as mentioned above. Thus he was clarified in all these matters.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Malki Tsedek king of Shalem brought out bread and wine, and he was a priest of the supernal God.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 14:18)</p>
<p>It is written (Mishlei, 8:15), &#x201C;In Me, Kings will reign.&#x201D; According to the plain meaning it should have been written, &#x201C;In Me will reign kings.&#x201D; There is a hint in this that the Holy One, blessed be He, only makes a king out of someone who can first rule over himself, and if so He also makes him a king over others. Concerning this it is said (<italic>Pirke Avot</italic>, Ch. 4:1), &#x201C;who is mighty? He who conquers his own evil nature.&#x201D; This is &#x201C;in Me, kings will reign,&#x201D; meaning one who reigns over himself, and his intellect rules over his desires, he will reign, meaning he will be a king over all, and you do not have to pay attention to his opponents, since all his intentions are for the sake of Heaven. This is why it is written, &#x201C;Malki Tsedek king of Shalem,&#x201D; meaning that at first he was a righteous (<italic>Tsedek</italic>) king in that he ruled over himself in his righteousness, and afterward he was &#x201C;king of Shalem [meaning complete],&#x201D; which is Jerusalem.</p>
<p>For this reason the first of the month of Nissan is the New Year for the kings. It seems that the first of the month of Sivan would be more proper, for in this month was given the Torah in which it is written, &#x201C;in Me kings will reign.&#x201D; Yet still, because it says first &#x201C;in me kings,&#x201D; and afterward &#x201C;will reign,&#x201D; meaning that he will be a king over himself, which occurs in the month of Nissan, when Israel constricts themselves by eating the bread of affliction (matsah) and accepting upon themselves the yoke of the blessed Creator, eating from Him (as it were) dry bread without taste, and not eating delicacies under the yoke of flesh and blood. For in truth there was great plenty in Egypt, as it is said (<italic>Shemot</italic>, 16:3), &#x201C;when we sat by the flesh pots.&#x201D; So by means of this (the constrictions of Nissan), &#x201C;they will reign,&#x201D; meaning over the whole world, and this is in the month of Sivan for in it the Torah was given.</p>
<p>This is as it is said here, &#x201C;Malki Tsedek king of Shalem,&#x201D; and on this he is called king of Shalem (complete). Shem, the son of Noach (whom the Gemara, <italic>Nedarim</italic>, 32b, identifies as Malki Tsedek), asked for and greatly desired the welfare of Jerusalem. Therefore when he saw that his student Avraham went to save Lot, who, according to his reasoning and understanding did not see why he did this, for even the opposite&#x2014;not to help him&#x2014;would have been proper for from him would come Ammon and Moav, who were the &#x201C;evil neighbors of Jerusalem&#x201D; (<italic>Sanhedrin</italic>, 96b). Also, there is a sign that God hated them in warning that they should not be accepted into the congregation of Israel. How then could Avraham Avinu have dedicated himself to saving him? Yet since he knew his student Avraham and recognized him as a complete <italic>Tsaddik</italic> who would not come to failure, he prayed to the blessed God to illuminate his eyes and make known to him the reasons for Avraham&#x2019;s endeavors. This is why he was called &#x201C;a priest to the most high God,&#x201D; meaning that at the time when he brought out bread and wine he was a <italic>Cohen</italic> serving the blessed God and praying to Him to illuminate his eyes in order to understand things clearly that were above his intellect and apprehension.</p>
<p>Afterward the blessed God illuminated his eyes to show him that Avraham Avinu did not, God forbid, do anything that was useless. Even though it was indeed so that from Lot would come Ammon and Moav, of whom it is said, &#x201C;they shall not enter the congregation&#x201D; (Lamentations, 1:10), this was only for the men, but the women were permitted to enter at once. Furthermore, from this would emerge the kingdom of the house of David who are the main principle of the existence of kingship in the land of Israel and Jerusalem. On this Malki Tsedek said, &#x201C;blessed is Avram to the Supernal God&#x0021;&#x201D; Notice how he first blessed Avraham (and then afterward blessed God in verse 20), for Avraham also did something above his intellect, with only the blessed God arousing his heart to this and he delivered over his soul. Since it was Avraham who first made this known to him, Avraham&#x2019;s blessing came first, and by means of this he took the priesthood from himself and gave it to Avraham (<italic>Nedarim</italic>, 32b). That is, he admitted that Avraham was greater than him, as it is said (Tehillim, 110:4), &#x201C;You are a priest forever, a king of righteousness [<italic>Malki Tsedek</italic>] according to My word.&#x201D; &#x201C;A king of righteousness [<italic>Malki Tsedek</italic>],&#x201D; meaning that I (God) illuminated the eyes of Malki Tsedek to see that Avraham was greater than him and admit it himself.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Avram said to the king of Sodom, I raise my hands to Hashem &#x2026; that I will not take from you even a thread or a shoelace &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 14:22&#x2013;23)</p>
<p>The question is why did Avraham Avinu not want to benefit from the king of Sodom, even though he had received from Pharaoh and Avimelech? His efforts to save Lot were in the way of a <italic>birrur</italic>, clarification, because Lot had within him a good power, since Naomi the Ammonite and Ruth the Moabite were among his offspring, and the rest was evil, for Ammon and Moav were born of him, as is explained. So it was necessary to clarify in himself that at the depths all his intentions were to save these two good offshoots (<italic>Baba Kama</italic>, 38b). In all places where a man is in need of spiritual clarification he is advised to remove himself from all afflictions where he receives benefit. After this, the blessed God will make it clear that even in the times where he had transgressed the law was also good, for, &#x201C;it is a time to do for God, they have made void Your Torah&#x201D; (Tehillim, 119:126). This is hinted at in the Gemara (<italic>Ketubot</italic>, 66a), &#x201C;what a wife finds is her husband&#x2019;s,&#x201D; for the wife hints at man&#x2019;s help in a place when he needs to hear her words.</p>
<p>Then it is &#x201C;a time to do,&#x201D; as is explained with Adam and Chava where she was given to him so he would listen to her words, and there he did not sin, and what he desired was not from her side, only from the side of the incitement of the snake. This is the explanation of &#x201C;what a wife finds is her husband&#x2019;s,&#x201D; meaning in a place where a man conducts himself not according to the judgment of the Torah, but only according to &#x201C;a time to do for God,&#x201D; then it is forbidden for him to receive benefit. &#x201C;Rabbi Akiva said, what a wife finds is her own,&#x201D; meaning that he may allow himself to receive benefit also in this place. Since at the time Avraham Avinu went to rescue Lot the depth of the intention of the action was hidden from him, therefore he did not want to receive benefit.</p>
<p>This is the same as the matter with King David and Achish king of Gat (Shmuel 1, Ch. 30; see this whole chapter for a clearer understanding), where he did not want to benefit from the war spoils, for this was also against the judgment of the Torah. Even though he did not share their intentions, (still he refused to benefit from the war spoils) for his intentions were for the sake of Heaven. This is as it is said (Mishlei, 1:15), &#x201C;do not go in the way with them,&#x201D; meaning that even though you do not go with them, yet still, prevent them in a way that they will not be mistaken in even thinking that you are going with them. Therefore Amalek came to him at this time, for Amalek hates Israel at the depths, and one who hates another at the depths can immediately feel when the other is lacking something, as explained in <italic>Parshat Bereshit</italic> (see p. 16, &#x201C;said the snake&#x201D;).</p>
<p>Therefore David haMelech sent away the war spoils and did not want to benefit from it. Therefore when they won the war against the Amalekites, it is said (Shmuel 1, 30:19), &#x201C;and there was nothing lacking in them, neither great nor small &#x2026; David returned everything,&#x201D; for this is a matter that requires great assistance from Heaven and careful guarding. Thus it says &#x201C;there was nothing lacking,&#x201D; for here were the salvations of God, and the Amalekites could not bring accusations against them, for whenever Israel makes mistakes, Amalek is there to bring accusations.</p>
<p>This is as it is written (<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 21:1), &#x201C;and the Canaanite heard that Israel came by way of the spies.&#x201D; &#x201C;The way of the spies&#x201D; means by way of error, for at that time the children of Israel were not yet commanded to go to the land of Israel, but anyhow they went by way of the spies, like one who lost his way until he goes to a place that he is not permitted to go according to the blessed God. Therefore Amalek immediately appeared to them, for &#x201C;the Canaanite&#x201D; mentioned is Amalek, as Rashi <italic>z&#x2019;l</italic> explains. But truly Israel&#x2019;s heart was directed to Heaven, therefore when they won them in battle Israel vowed that their cities would be banned. In other words, they did not want to receive any benefit from this instance as it happened against the judgment of the Torah, and was decreed as &#x201C;a time to do for God.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Avram said, Lord Hashem, what will You give me, seeing as I go childless &#x2026; And Avram said, behold, You have given me no seed &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 15:2&#x2013;3)</p>
<p>To understand the doubling of the language, for when Avraham Avinu said (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 15:3), &#x201C;and behold, the one who grew up in my house [his servant Eliezar] will inherit me,&#x201D; he was not referring to his wealth and property in this world. Rather he was asking about the principle of Divine service in this world (which was revealed through him), and his one desire was that it forever be revealed through him, also in the physical world, that the blessed God controls and rules over all, and is also called &#x201C;the God of the land.&#x201D; This is as he said, &#x201C;seeing I go childless,&#x201D; meaning that there is no one to inherit my job of making Your Sovereignty known throughout the whole world the way I have done. He asked of the blessed God would not see fit that this inheritence be passed on through his servant Eliezar. Even though it seemed that Eliezar drew from the wellsprings of his master&#x2019;s teachings to give others to drink (see <italic>Yoma</italic> 28b), nevertheless Avraham Avinu was uncertain whether his intentions were truly for the sake of Heaven, as it is written (Mishlei, 18:2), &#x201C;a fool does not desire wisdom, but rather to reveal his heart.&#x201D; Therefore he first said, &#x201C;and the steward of my house is Eliezar of Damascus,&#x201D; and then after in a moment of repose he thought, &#x201C;maybe it will be fitting in the eyes of the blessed God to make Eliezar the one to publicize Your oneness.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Only he did not look upon him with a good eye, so therefore added immediately after, &#x201C;and behold the one who grew up in my house [literally, &#x2018;the son of my house&#x2019;] will inherit me.&#x201D; With these words he was praying that the blessed God to make Eliezar fitting in Avraham&#x2019;s view also, that he would have a good eye upon him and rejoice in him.<sup><xref rid="fn34">17</xref></sup> Therefore following immediately it says (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 15:4), &#x201C;And behold, the word of Hashem came to him saying, this will not be your heir.&#x201D; This is phrased in a way to denote <italic>simcha</italic> (joy), that your one desire (to promote the oneness of God in the world) will not be completed by means of him. This task is only befitting through your seed.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And he said, whereby shall I know that I will inherit it?&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 15:8)</p>
<p>After all of the clarification (the trials Avraham endured), he asked of the blessed God that the <italic>Shechina</italic> (Divine presence) be revealed in the world through him. Yet he asked, &#x201C;whereby shall I know,&#x201D; meaning that it is fixed in my heart without any interruption. Therefore he answered Him, &#x201C;take a heifer of three years [literally, &#x2018;triple&#x2019;],&#x201D; meaning that you will have to tell of the law of the <italic>Cohanim</italic> (the third book of the Bible, hence &#x201C;triple&#x201D;). This means, by means of Divine service (&#x201C;the law of the <italic>Cohanim</italic>&#x201D;) it shall be instilled in your heart each time more, until it will be forever fixed, and this is the essence of the term &#x201C;inheritance.&#x201D;</p>

<chapter>
<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> V<small>AYEIRA</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And God appeared unto him at the oaks of Mamre, and he was sitting in the entrance of the tent in the heat of the day.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 18:1)</p>
<p>It is written (<italic>Malachi</italic>, 3:20), &#x201C;For those who fear My name I will shine the sun of <italic>tsedaka</italic> (righteousness) and of healing in her wings.&#x201D; &#x201C;Those who fear My name&#x201D; means those who have an understanding of the words of Torah and of the blessed God. This will necessitate that they have true fear, and this is the explanation of &#x201C;those who fear My name.&#x201D; The blessed God then promises them that He will illuminate the sun of <italic>tsedaka</italic> upon them, or in other words, words of Torah that have been refined (disencumbered of any impurities). &#x201C;Of healing in her wings&#x201D; means trust, or taking strength in the blessed God and in the words of Torah, just as wings are the trust and strength of the bird.</p>
<p>We find that before the blessed God was revealed to him, Avraham Avinu derived no satisfaction from all the matters of this world, and even despised them. His true desire was to know &#x201C;who is the master of the city [the world].&#x201D; This is as is written (Mishlei, 15:24), &#x201C;the way of life is above for the intelligent,&#x201D; meaning that this quest was his principal concern, as something placed on high. Therefore the blessed God appeared unto him and gave him the special strength (<italic>tekifut</italic>) of refined words of Torah, for &#x201C;oaks&#x201D; denotes special strength, and &#x201C;<italic>Mamre</italic>&#x201D; (as in <italic>zaken mamre</italic>, an elder who refuses to abide by the injunction of the courts) means that he refused all the matters of this world, finding them bitter. &#x201C;And he was sitting in the entrance to the tent in the heat of the day.&#x201D; In other words, he was fervent for the love of God that is called day, and it was explicit before him. This is the meaning of &#x201C;in the entrance to the tent,&#x201D; meaning that it was open before him.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And behold, three men were standing upon him&#x201D; means that the blessed God showed him that all the world stands upon him, for an angel is one-third of the world, as it is written in the Midrash. (<italic>Bereshit</italic> Rabba, 68:12, where it says that an angel is the high officer [<italic>shalish</italic>, see <italic>Shirat haYam, Shemot</italic> 15:4] of the world, and based on the similarity of the words interprets that the size of an angel is a third [<italic>shlish</italic>] of the world, using the verse in Daniel when he saw an angel [10:6], &#x201C;His body was like <italic>tarshish</italic> [beryl, a brilliant gem in the <italic>urim</italic> and <italic>tummim</italic>, on the high priest&#x2019;s breastplate, and also meaning the finest ship of the ancient world],&#x201D; and as Rashi notes, like a ship on the high sea, and the ocean is a third of the world.) He showed him that the entire world exists in the merit of Avraham Avinu.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and he looked, and he saw three people standing on [in front of] him.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 18:2)</p>
<p>Why did the angels come before the birth of Yitschok? The world did not deserve to have born into it a soul as precious as that of Yitschok, for it was as if the very <italic>Shechina</italic>, the divine presence, were descending into the world. Yitschok&#x2019;s attribute is that of <italic>Gevurah</italic> (strength), and the <italic>Shechina</italic> is itself called <italic>Gevurah</italic>, as it says at Mount Sinai, &#x201C;thus Moshe heard from the mouth of Gevurah&#x201D; (see <italic>Eruvin</italic>, 54b). This necessitated the arrival of the three angels in order that the atmosphere of the world would be filled with <italic>Kedusha</italic> (holiness), for &#x201C;an angel is a third of the world&#x201D; (see end of previous passage) and then afterward Yitschok could be born.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Sarah denied it, saying, I did not laugh &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 18:15)</p>
<p>There is a great depth in this matter. The saying of the Gemara (<italic>Berachot</italic>, 33b), &#x201C;Rabbi Chanina said, all is in the hands of Heaven, except for the fear of Heaven,&#x201D; applies only to the extent of the understanding of the mortal intellect. Yet truly, everything is in the hands of Heaven including the fear of Heaven, yet God hid His way (this consciousness) in the world. The attribute of Yitschok Avinu was to recognize that even the fear of Heaven comes from God, yet the world was not worthy of a consciousness as precious as this. Therefore Sarah found it necessary to say, &#x201C;But my lord is old [too old to father children].&#x201D; Here it seems as if she is denying that all is in the hands of Heaven. Accordingly the Holy One, blessed be He, showed her, measure for measure, that even the fear of Heaven comes from Him, and were it not for the concealment of this understanding from her and from the world, Yitschok could not have been born into the world. For the preciousness of the attribute of Yitschok was to clarify and to show that even the fear of Heaven comes from God, and even all the transgressions of Israel occurred under the watch of the blessed God&#x2019;s providence. By means of this God&#x2019;s great name is exalted and sanctified&#x0021; Understand this, for it is exceedingly deep.</p>
<p>(See in the Gemara [<italic>Avoda Zara</italic>, 4b], &#x201C;Rabbi Yehusha ben Levi said, Israel only made the golden calf to support the position of <italic>ba&#x2019;alei tshuva</italic> [penitents], as it is written (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 5:26), &#x2018;would it were that they gave their hearts &#x2026; to fear Me all the days.&#x2019; R. Yehoshua ben Levi said in the name of R. Shimon b. Yochai, David was not capable of this action [his sin with Bathsheba] as it is written (Tehillim, 109:22), &#x2018;my heart is empty [of the evil inclination] within me [and therefore it has no power over me], and Israel was not supposed to be capable of making the golden calf, as it is written, &#x2018;would that they gave their hearts to fear Me.&#x2019; So why did they make it? To show you, that if an individual sinned they say to him that it was entirely up to the individual, and if a whole community sinned then it was the responsibility of the entire community.&#x201D; Rashi comments: &#x201C;to support the position of <italic>ba&#x2019;alei tshuva</italic>,&#x201D; that is to say that they were courageous and controlled their evil natures, and it was against their very abilities to give in to the evil inclination; yet it was a decree of the King, for their evil natures to overcome them. Yet it was in order to respond to the penitents, to show that there was value in their return, for perhaps one would sin and say, &#x201C;there is no need for me to return to the good, for God would not accept me anyway.&#x201D; Then they could say to him, &#x201C;go and learn from the incident with the golden cow, how they made atonement and their penance was accepted.&#x201D;</p>
<p>And if so, what made it so that the tribes would fulfill the mitzvah of giving the half-shekel, it was to atone for their worship of the golden calf, and if the sin of the golden calf caused them to fulfill the mitzvah of the half-shekel, how much more so would be the effect of the merit of the <italic>mitzvot</italic> that they are doing&#x0021; And in the Jerusalem Talmud it is written [<italic>Shekalim</italic>, Ch. 2, <italic>halacha</italic> 3], &#x201C;since they sold the first born of Rachel for twenty silver pieces, thus each one must redeem his first born son for twenty silver pieces.&#x201D; From the emendations of Yerucham Lainer.)</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;All who hear will laugh from rejoicing in me &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 21:6)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hearing&#x201D; means understanding. It is said (<italic>Bereshit</italic> Rabba, 45:8), &#x201C;when Sarah became pregnant, many infertile women in the world became pregnant at the same time.&#x201D; In response to this, many of the scoffers of the generation said, &#x201C;who is to say that this miracle came about through the power of Sarah, were not many other infertile women answered with children?&#x201D; So Sarah said, &#x201C;all who hear,&#x201D; meaning whoever possesses understanding will know that this was the laughter that the blessed God made for me.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;and Avraham returned to his place &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 18:33)</p>
<p>After Avraham gave over his very soul toward the cause of saving the people of Sodom, and after most of the prayer that he exerted in order to save them, the blessed God answered him that they were hateful of God, and it hurt Him that he would exert so much over those who hate God. Therefore, &#x201C;Avraham returned to his place,&#x201D; meaning to his initial place of strength, for then he truly knew that he only really loves the lovers of God, and certainly contained in this is a depth far greater than his apprehension.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Avraham journeyed from there to the land of the Negev.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 20:1)</p>
<p>Avraham Avinu greatly disencumbered from love all the aspects of love in the world that are not solely given over to God alone. Then, when he saw how an action as the incident between Lot and his two daughters could have occurred, he began anew the entire process of refining love. This is &#x201C;and he journeyed,&#x201D; from an action such as this, &#x201C;to the land of the Negev,&#x201D; meaning a place so dry that it was as if he had not even started the process of the refinement of love at all.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; for God has greatly closed up all the wombs of the house of Avimelech, concerning [his intentions to take Sarah for a wife] &#x2026; And God remembered Sarah &#x2026; and caused her to conceive &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 20:18, 21:1)</p>
<p>In the Midrash (Tanchuma, <italic>Vaye&#x2019;chi</italic>, 8, on Yechezkel 17:24), &#x201C;I have dried the wet [fertile] wood, and caused the dry wood to blossom. &#x2018;Dried the wet wood,&#x2019; is Avimelech; &#x2018;caused the dry wood to blossom,&#x2019; is Avraham.&#x201D; Concerning Avraham it is written (Yechezkel, 33:24), &#x201C;Avraham was one.&#x201D; This means that as far as he was concerned, Avraham was not fit to give birth because he was intensely joined to the blessed God at the level of the final and most perfect form of simplicity. Whosoever is joined to the blessed God in such completeness only contains within him matters of pure simplicity and oneness with the true life. Therefore when the Holy One, blessed be He, wanted Avraham to give birth to Yitschok Avinu, He did so only after the incident with Avimelech.</p>
<p>For Avimelech wanted to steal all that was in the possession of Avraham, so he was judged for this measure for measure. And the power of <italic>Gevurah</italic> (strength, severity) in the world was with the Philistines, and therefore the mighty Samson was always fighting with them. Therefore this very power of <italic>Gevurah</italic> was given to Avraham. (See <italic>Tsidkat haTsaddik</italic>, 249, which says, &#x201C;Thus I have heard that Avraham Avinu received the spirit of wisdom and understanding from Egypt, and the spirit of counsel and <italic>Gevurah</italic> from Avimelech. This is the reason why they suspected that Sarah became pregnant from Avimelech [as the Midrash Tanchuma, Toldot 1, says, &#x201C;since Sarah gave birth immediately after the incidents with Pharaoh and Avimelech, they said, &#x2018;from Pharaoh or Avimelech she conceived.&#x2019;&#x201D; Then even Avraham began to suspect, so God clarified the matter by making the face of Yitschok exactly like the face of Avraham] for immediately when the power of birth was taken from Avimelech it was given to Avraham&#x201D;).</p>
<p>When the power of <italic>Gevurah</italic> was given to Avraham it was without limit. For all the powers of the nations of the world are limited within them, and when these powers are entered into Israel they are without limit, as they are cleaving to the blessed God also at their roots and without any limit. For this reason Israel is dispersed among the nations in order that they may receive all the powers residing in each of the seventy nations, and once in Israel it will be without limit. Thus it is written concerning King Shlomo (<italic>Bava Metsia</italic>, 86b), &#x201C;He took wives from many nations,&#x201D; for the strength of each nation is principally in its women, and particularly in the princess. Therefore, when all these powers are conquered, they will sprout good among Israel, &#x201C;the branch of My planting&#x201D; (Yesahya, 60:21).</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and God tested Avraham &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 22:1)</p>
<p>The test of the binding of Yitschok (henceforth, the <italic>Akeida</italic>) was in the great faith that Avraham Avinu had in the blessed God. God had already said to him, &#x201C;thus will be your progeny&#x201D; and &#x201C;I will keep my covenant, with Yitschok,&#x201D; so now, when He said to him, &#x201C;raise him up on the altar for a sacrifice,&#x201D; even though he remembered those first things that he had been told, and did not fall (from his level of faith). It is not possible for the intelligence of man to apprehend this kind of faith. Truly, we never find the specific command of God telling him to slaughter his son, so therefore the verse does not say, &#x201C;and YHV&#x2019;H tested Avraham&#x201D; (using God&#x2019;s name of mercy), but &#x201C;E-lohim tested&#x201D; (God&#x2019;s name of judgment), meaning that the Divine injunction came to him in the aspect of a &#x201C;mirror which does not illuminate&#x201D; (a lower level of prophecy) (Zohar <italic>Bereshit</italic>, 120b) and therefore the name &#x201C;E-lohim&#x201D; is used, which denotes strengths. Therefore concerning Yitschok it was not really a test, for he believed that this was clearly what God wanted Avraham to do, yet for Avraham it was a great trial because he had not received a clear message from God. So if he were tainted in any aspect of his relationship as a father toward his son, then God would have obliged him to have mercy upon him. Truly, it was the direct will of God that he would not slaughter his son, and the trial was only to illuminate the eyes of Avraham. This is why, when he prayed for Sodom he said (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 18:27), &#x201C;for i am dust and ashes,&#x201D; for dust represents an action that has not been disencumbered of impurities and needs fixing. It is possible that things may grow out of the dust, where ashes represent something completely lost, God forbid. If he had slaughtered his son then there would not have been any way to repair the damage. Similarly with the people of Sodom, if his prayer had been effective and they lived, and then they continued in their evil ways, then it would have been like the dust from which there is no growth. Thus the blessed God showed him that his prayer over them had not been in vain, for as we find in the writings of the Ari&#x2019;zal (<italic>Shaar HaPesikim, Parshat Shemot</italic>) from (their souls) the generation of Israel in the desert was born.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and now I know that you are one who fears E-lohim &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 28:12)</p>
<p>There is a difference between the fear of YHV&#x2019;H and the fear of E-lohim. The fear of E-lohim is what causes a man to prevent himself from doing something, such as eating and the like. This is because he is not in a state of completeness, and there is still something lacking in the man, so he constricts himself according to his understanding. This is called &#x201C;the fear of E-lohim.&#x201D; The fear of YHV&#x2019;H means that even if the man understands within himself that it is permitted for him to do this action, for his soul has been refined from this deficiency, yet still, it is forbidden to him from the side of the blessed God. God commanded straightforward injunctions to each soul, and since there exists a man who still has not been refined in this particular aspect, therefore the blessed God did not permit this particular action. This is because he has not yet achieved equilibrium with everything (meaning he perhaps has other things lacking), and is still obliged to suffer a prohibition for his fellow man. This is called fear of YHV&#x2019;H.</p>

<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And the life of Sarah was a hundred and twenty and seven years, these were the years of the life of Sarah.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 23:1)</p>
<p>It is said in the tractate of <italic>Berachot</italic> (8a), &#x201C;On this every one of God shall pray unto You at a time when you are found (Tehillim, 32:6). One says this refers to woman, one says this is Torah, one says this is death, and one says this is the toilet.&#x201D; All of these that are mentioned concern times when a man is in a state of uncertainty over matters beyond his control, and he needs only to pray to the blessed God to help him. &#x201C;One says Torah,&#x201D; meaning that when he does an action, he should pray to God to illuminate the way of Torah, and if according to the way of the Torah it is proper to do this action. &#x201C;One says that this is woman&#x201D; means that the blessed God should be ever present. One must know, &#x201C;it is a time to do for God, Your Torah has been made void&#x201D; (Tehillim, 119:126), which concerns woman (or the one&#x2019;s spouse), as was explained in <italic>Parshat Bereshit</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn35">18</xref></sup> &#x201C;One says this is death,&#x201D; for also there one enters into uncertainty, as Reb Yochanan said (<italic>Berachot</italic>, 28b), &#x201C;there are two ways open before me,&#x201D; and as it is said (<italic>Berachot</italic>, 8a), &#x201C;a man should pray for peace even up to the last handful of earth thrown over his grave.&#x201D; &#x201C;One says this is burial,&#x201D; for even once he is buried there is also a depth, and one enters into uncertainty for his way is open to the world to come, as stated in the Midrash (<italic>Bereshit</italic> Rabba, 42:6). &#x201C;One says that this is the toilet,&#x201D; meaning shame, so that one should pray that nothing he would later be ashamed of will leave his mouth.</p>
<p>These five things are hinted at in this week&#x2019;s <italic>Parsha</italic>. &#x201C;Torah&#x201D; is hinted at in &#x201C;Avraham became old,&#x201D; for &#x201C;wisdom is acquired with age.&#x201D; &#x201C;Woman&#x201D; is hinted at in Rivka marrying Yitschok, and also in &#x201C;and Avraham again took a wife,&#x201D; for there is a great depth in that it was necessary for him to father all these generations whose roots are not in <italic>Kedusha</italic> (holiness). All the same, Yitschok will control all these powers, and on all of them will exult the name of God. &#x201C;One says burial&#x201D; is hinted at with Sarah, and &#x201C;death&#x201D; with Avraham Avinu. &#x201C;Toilet&#x201D; is hinted at with the last section concerning the sons of Ishmael, on that which Avraham said, &#x201C;would that Ishmael live before you,&#x201D; which was considered as shaming Avraham, as said in the holy Zohar (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 205b)</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And the life of Sarah was &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 23:1)</p>
<p>It is said in the Midrash (<italic>Bereshit</italic> Rabba, 38:1) on the verse (Tehillim, 37:18), &#x201C;God knows the days of the whole-hearted [<italic>Temimim</italic> in Hebrew; also upright, honest, innocent],&#x201D; &#x201C;just as they are whole-hearted, so are their years whole [complete]. Reb Yochanan says, &#x2018;like a whole unblemished and perfect heifer.&#x2019;&#x201D; To explain the matter, it is written (Tehillim, 1:6), &#x201C;God knows the way of the <italic>Tsaddikim</italic> [righteous],&#x201D; or in other words, it is the way of the <italic>Tsaddikim</italic> to know God, in the language of mankind, where that way leads to, and thus the way of the <italic>Tsaddikim</italic> is cleared of barriers and vanities of this world, and leads only to the knowledge of God. And so is the explanation of &#x201C;God knows the way of the whole-hearted,&#x201D; meaning that the way of the whole-hearted leads, is even drawn to, the knowledge of God. Knowledge signifies connection and intense cleaving, as in &#x201C;and Adam knew his wife Chava.&#x201D; The meaning is to connect and join intensely in the blessed God, and it follows that their going in this way is the very beginning of their life. In this way the Midrash explains, &#x201C;and these were the years of the life of Sarah,&#x201D; meaning that from now here life truly began, for &#x201C;God knows the days of the whole.&#x201D; On this, Reb Yochanan said, &#x201C;like a whole, perfect heifer.&#x201D; <italic>Eglah</italic> in Hebrew, the same letters as <italic>agalah</italic>, a circle, something round, made in a perfect and complete circle, which has no end, and each point is its beginning, since is singularly encompassing, and &#x201C;its end is wedged in its beginning&#x201D; (Seferyetsira, ch. 1). Now that her days in this world had been completed, it says, &#x201C;and these are the lives of Sarah,&#x201D; for this is the beginning of her life, as explained in the holy Zohar.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Avraham waxed old, coming in age, and God blessed Avraham with everything.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 24:1)</p>
<p>It is written (Kohollet, 2:10), &#x201C;and this is my portion from all my toil,&#x201D; and of this the Gemara says (<italic>Sanhedrin</italic>, 20b), &#x201C;Rav and Shmuel [differ on the interpretation of what &#x2018;this&#x2019; is in the verse], one says it is his staff, one says it is his water jug.&#x201D; Certainly King Shlomo was not complaining, God forbid, of his loss of the delights of the world, for they were considered as nothing before him, yet he praised himself and said that even though it seems that everything was taken from him, still the concentration of all the life of this world remained with him. In these two things we find the concentration of all the life of this world, in that he said, &#x201C;this is my portion from all my toil.&#x201D; &#x201C;One says his staff,&#x201D; for a staff hints at life, meaning that the power of life remained with him, as it is written (Zechariya, 8:4), &#x201C;[thus shall the old men and women dwell in Jerusalem], and each man his staff in hand.&#x201D; &#x201C;One says his water jug,&#x201D; for a jug is a vessel of reception, meaning, ready and still longing to add to it. This was his delight, for this is the main point of the life of this world. And this is the meaning of the verse, &#x201C;and Avraham was old, coming in days,&#x201D; that he came to the roots of life, and he himself became a vessel of reception, longing for an increase in his life from God more at each moment.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Yitschok came from the way of the well &#x2018;Lechai Roi,&#x2019; for he dwelt in the south country. And Yitschok went out to meditate in the fields upon evening, and he raised his eyes, and saw, and behold, the camels were coming.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 24:62)</p>
<p>Meaning, Yitschok was the root of all the fears (of God) in the world, and even when (the mitzvah, or God&#x2019;s will) involves &#x201C;sitting&#x201D; and refraining from action, as it says, &#x201C;he dwelt [sat] in the south country [Negev]&#x201D; meaning wiped clear (<italic>menugav</italic>) of all desire (not directed to <italic>Kedusha</italic>). And concerning this, since Avraham Avinu understood that the soul of Yitschok greatly desired to serve God with active performance, he sent his servant to find him his soulmate. And here truly, &#x201C;this has come from God&#x201D; (Tehillim, 118:23), for the time had come for Yitschok to marry a wife. Furthermore, Yitschok&#x2019;s heart woke to the understanding of (Yeshaya, 45:18), &#x201C;God did not create a desolation for his creations,&#x201D; yet since he feared the actual performance of something in this direction, he went out to meditate, to pour out his heart in the field and ask the blessed God to help him and to prepare his <italic>zivug</italic> (mate). &#x201C;For some, their <italic>zivug</italic> comes to them,&#x201D; (<italic>Moed Katan</italic>, 18b), and his prayer was answered immediately, &#x201C;and he raised his eyes, and saw the camels coming,&#x201D; for &#x201C;before you cry out, I will answer you&#x201D; (Yesahya, 65:24).</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And these are the generations of Yishmael son of Avraham, who Hagar the Egyptian bore, the maidservant of Sarah, to Avraham.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 25:12)</p>
<p>It is written (Tehillim, 111:6), &#x201C;He told the power of His works to His people in giving them the inheritance of the nations.&#x201D; That is to say, from the side of Israel, there is almost no need to know the sciences of the natural world, for they act according to the Torah of God and the conduct of the blessed God, with no need of the conduct of the natural world at all. Only He who said to the oil, &#x201C;ignite&#x0021;&#x201D;, can say to vinegar, &#x201C;ignite&#x0021;&#x201D; (God could make anything He wants light, so the point is to be connected to the source rather than the effect. Betsalel.) The blessed God, out of His love for them, wants to make known to them the sciences of nature also, and this is also found in the Torah. We find an example in the Gemara (Mishna, <italic>Pesachim</italic>, 39b), &#x201C;a man may not chew wheat and place it on his wound, because it turns into leaven,&#x201D; and from this it is clear that chewed wheat is good for a wound, as we find in several places.</p>
<p>And to this, &#x201C;the power of His works,&#x201D; meaning the Torah, &#x201C;He told to His people in giving them inheritance of the nations,&#x201D; and this inheritance is nature (and its wisdom), and this is also found in the power of His works that He told to His people. This itself is, &#x201C;these are the generations of Yishmael (son of Avraham, which Hagar the Egyptian) the handmaid of Sarah, bore to Avraham,&#x201D; for his primary relation to her was that she was Sarah&#x2019;s handmaid, and owing to this there are sages among them. Their names teach of their wisdom. <italic>Neviot</italic> teaches that a man must see that his body is clean, as it is related to the word <italic>navov</italic>, meaning empty, hence empty of impurity. <italic>Kedar</italic> is the heated body (because <italic>k&#x2019;dera</italic> is a cooking pot). <italic>Ad&#x2019;bael</italic> meaning not to eat to become satisfied (meaning overeating, perhaps connected to the colloquial <italic>d&#x2019;biel</italic>, meaning clumsy, bearish, or eating until one becomes clumsy, but I do not know if this usage was known to the author. Betsalel). <italic>Mivsham</italic> meaning wines and perfumes that make one wise (connected to <italic>bosem</italic>, perfume; see <italic>Yoma</italic>, 76b, &#x201C;Rava said, wine and fragrant spices made me wise&#x201D;). This concerns their wisdom in the realm of physical health. Concerning their wisdom in social relations are, &#x201C;<italic>Mishma&#x2019;</italic>, and <italic>Duma</italic>, and <italic>Massa</italic>,&#x201D; <italic>mishma&#x2019;</italic>, meaning the power of listening (<italic>shema</italic>); <italic>Duma</italic>, virtually the same word for silence; and <italic>Massa</italic>, meaning a load that is carried, meaning to be patient.</p>
<p>Concerning their wisdom in production, &#x201C;<italic>Chadad</italic>&#x201D; means if you want to bring something into the world (<italic>Chadad</italic> means to be sharp or fierce, essential to creativity), &#x201C;<italic>Teima</italic>,&#x201D; all the world will find it wondrous (<italic>Temiha</italic>, wonder or astonishment), &#x201C;<italic>Y&#x2019;toor</italic>,&#x201D; so make sure that it is well-organized (<italic>Toor</italic> is a row). &#x201C;<italic>Nafish</italic>&#x201D; means to take time and sit on the creation to make sure that it is beautiful (<italic>Nafash</italic>, to rest, to take the proper amount of time). <italic>&#x201C;Kidma,&#x201D;</italic> or, if you see it is proper to do it, then do it soon lest someone else does it before you (<italic>Lehakdim</italic>, to precede). Their wisdom is only in the realm of nature, and in this they place their trust. Therefore of Yishmael it is written (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 25:18), &#x201C;and he fell [died] in the presence of his brethren.&#x201D; However, with Israel, who knows that all comes from Heaven, it is written (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 16:12), &#x201C;and he shall dwell in the presence of his brethren.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn36">19</xref>, <xref rid="fn37">20</xref></sup></p>

<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> T<small>OLDOT</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And these are the generations of Yitschok, son of Avraham. Avraham begot Yitschok.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 25:19)</p>
<p>It is written (Divrei haYamim 1, 28:9), &#x201C;If you seek it, you will find.&#x201D; The seeking is Avraham Avinu, and the finding is Yitschok. The main point of Avraham Avinu was that he always yearned exceedingly for the words of Torah, and greatly desired that the reign of the blessed God in the world would be made known. This is the attribute of love. The attribute of Yitschok is that of <italic>Gevurah</italic> (strength, severity), meaning: after this became clear, and the revelation of the blessed God descended into the world. This is called <italic>Gevurah</italic>, as it is written (<italic>Megillah</italic>, 31b), &#x201C;thus Moshe heard from the mouth of <italic>Gevurah</italic>,&#x201D; and Yitschok is also called the <italic>Gevurah</italic> of the blessed God in the world.</p>
<p>This goes according to the verse, &#x201C;and these are the generations of Yitschok, son of Avraham &#x2026;,&#x201D; which means that the generations, or results of Yitschok Avinu, are the proclamation of the revelation of God in this world. Thereby, &#x201C;Avraham begot Yitschok,&#x201D; for this came about by means of Avraham&#x2019;s yearning, for yearning is the attribute of Avraham, and so it is that all true words of Torah are born into the world only after the great desire of those who long for them.</p>
<p>This also concerns what is said in the Gemara (<italic>Baba Metsia</italic>, 44a), &#x201C;In his younger days Rabbi Yehuda haNasi taught his son, &#x2018;silver buys gold,&#x2019; and in his old age, &#x2018;gold buys silver.&#x2019;&#x201D; In a man&#x2019;s youth he has great desire and yearning for the words of Torah, and by means of this, he is &#x201C;buying gold,&#x201D; which means acquiring words of Torah in their true form that are called gold, by means of silver (<italic>Kesef</italic>), which is desire and yearning (<italic>Kesifa</italic>). Yet, in his old age a man must ask that his desire for the words of Torah not be taken from him, for in old age the powers of desire weaken. Therefore he taught that &#x201C;gold buys silver.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn38">21</xref></sup> The silver is the prayer that he offers to God, that by means of the very words of Torah the desire may come to him for an increase in more words of Torah. This is compared to a man who is satisfied from eating, and nonetheless, if more good food were placed before him it would draw his appetite to eat further.</p>
<p>So it is with the words of Torah. This is as we pray each day (in the blessing over the Torah) &#x201C;and may God make the words of Torah desirable in our mouths,&#x201D; that is, may the words of Torah become sweetened in such a way that we may then have greater desire for them each time. This is the meaning of the verse (Yoel, 2:26), &#x201C;and you shall eat food and be satisfied.&#x201D; The doubling of the language teaches of this,<sup><xref rid="fn39">22</xref></sup> for by means of the very eating there will come greater desire. This is all an allegory for the words of Torah, as explained above.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Yitschok loved Eisav because of the taste of the meat he would trap [or, he would trap with his mouth].&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 25:28)</p>
<p>This is explained (<italic>Bereshit</italic> Rabba, 63:10), &#x201C;that he would deceive his father into thinking that he was a scholar with fancy dilemmas in Torah, like how can one tithe salt and straw.&#x201D; You cannot understand this explanation literally, for surely Yitschok Avinu was not mistaken in thinking he was actually genuine, when he was clearly cheating him. Yet from the beginning, Yaakov and Eisav were two men equal in their greatness. However, it was Eisav&#x2019;s mind to make himself more appealing in his father&#x2019;s eyes, so he would find favor in his father&#x2019;s sight, and then accordingly pray to the blessed God to give his son Eisav more wisdom. Yaakov, however, went in the way of simplicity and said, &#x201C;what need have I of this? If I am worthy in the sight of God, He will cause the heart of my father Yitschok to pray for me.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Eisav&#x2019;s way was not honest in Yaakov&#x2019;s view, for this way needs clarification (<italic>birrur</italic>), for who can say if this way will be accepted, and perhaps he is only doing it to deceive. Since Yaakov Avinu had separated himself from all uncertainty, his heart trusted only in the blessed God. And truly, everywhere that one enters himself into uncertainties in the service of the blessed God and into matters that need clarification, if the matter is clarified for the good then he is greater than one who just removed himself from all doubts. Yet this is only for the seed of Yaakov, since they have found a stronghold in the blessed God, that He will clarify all for the good, so it is permitted for him to enter into uncertainties. Yet whoever does not have this stronghold, it is forbidden for him to enter into uncertainty, in the way that Eisav entered himself into matters that were later clarified as being evil. For the Holy One, blessed be He, only clarifies Israel for the good, as is explained in the verse, &#x201C;it will be <italic>tsedaka</italic> for us&#x201D; (<italic>Parshat Vaetchanan</italic>). For all who are not from the seed of Yaakov, it is good before Him for them to limit themselves with all kinds of constrictions, as is explained concerning converts, for whom it is forbidden for them to enter into uncertainties.</p>
<p>So therefore, when Yitschok saw that Eisav was entering himself into these matters, he said that if they are clarified for the good, then Eisav would become greater than Yaakov, yet the blessed God then bared witness to him that Eisav&#x2019;s intentions were not for the sake of Heaven. Also within Israel, we find that there are some souls who may permit themselves to enter into uncertainty more than others, even though they both come from the seed of Yaakov. Take, for instance, Shimon and Dinah. Levi did not want to take her because he feared that maybe his intentions were not completely for the sake of Heaven, as all the tribe of Levi exist with the fear of God before them always, taking care to remove themselves from all doubts. This as it is said (Malachi, 2:5), &#x201C;and I gave them to him for the fear,&#x201D; etc. Because of this He brought out of them Cohanim who would enter &#x201C;before Me and inside [the Holy of Holies],&#x201D; and therefore their life was clarified immediately as explained in <italic>Parshat Korach</italic> (with the tribes, on the verse &#x201C;and God said&#x201D;). Shimon, however, entered himself into uncertainty, saying, &#x201C;God forbid I would consider myself licentious,&#x201D; and marrying Dinah.</p>
<p>Thus he entered himself into a situation that needed clarification, saying he trusts that God will make it clear that it was good, that his intention was not only to take her out from Shchem and all his intentions were for the sake of Heaven. Therefore the tribe of Shimon needed all these kinds of clarifications, such as Zimri who also said that his intention was good, as explained in its place (<italic>Parshat Balak</italic>). And in the future, when the tribe of Shimon will be clarified, its level will be greater than that of Levi.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And the men of the place asked of his wife, and he said, she is my sister .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 26:7)</p>
<p>It is written in the Gemara (<italic>Bava Metsia</italic>, 59a), &#x201C;Rava said to the men of Machoza his city, honor your wives, for in the merit of this you will become rich.&#x201D; This is hinted at with Adam haRishon, where it says (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 3:20), &#x201C;and Adam called his wife Chava,&#x201D; and then follows it immediately by saying, &#x201C;and God made for Adam and his wife garments of skins and dressed them.&#x201D; The meaning is, after God&#x2019;s influence was reduced through the snake, His influence then returned by means of the garments of skins, since the man proclaimed the preciousness of Chava and called her the mother of all life. Similarly we find with Avraham who said of Sarah, &#x201C;she is my sister&#x201D; (in an effort to protect her) when he went to Egypt, and afterward left there with great wealth. It is also so of Yitschok, who said of Rivka, &#x201C;she is my sister,&#x201D; that immediately after it is said, &#x201C;and Yitschok sowed in that land, and found a hundredfold in return, and God blessed him.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Yitschok returned and digged the wells of water &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 26:18)</p>
<p>It is written (Tehillim, 147:17), &#x201C;He sends His ice like crumbs &#x2026; He causes the wind to blow and the waters to flow.&#x201D; &#x201C;He sends His ice like crumbs,&#x201D; meaning that the blessed God gives the nations the power to rule over Israel. &#x201C;He causes the wind to blow,&#x201D; that is to say, the Holy One, blessed be He, is afterward appeased to Israel, for &#x201C;blows&#x201D; is a term denoting <italic>meshivat nefesh</italic>, &#x201C;restoring the soul.&#x201D; Then sweetened waters will flow. &#x201C;He speaks His word to Yaakov,&#x201D; meaning that He tells them the sin and deficiency that exists within them, by means of which the nations have the power to rule over them, and then they immediately return in <italic>tshuva</italic>. &#x201C;He did not do this to every nation,&#x201D; for He does not reveal His intention to them at all.</p>
<p>This was also the matter here, when Yitschok saw that Avimelech said to him, &#x201C;go away from us,&#x201D; since he thought that Yitschok was feeling superior over them. Truly, that Yitschok felt superior to Avimelech was not at all considered a deficiency, for it was as if a man felt superior to an animal, but it is simply the order of creation that man is greater than the animal. Therefore Avimelech&#x2019;s response was very evil in his eyes, since he was the son of Avraham Avinu, who was a king in the world, as it was said (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 23:6), &#x201C;a prince of E-lohim.&#x201D; Avraham was influential throughout the whole world, his nature was well known, so why did they have to antagonize his son until he had to be banished from Gerar? Once he had regained composure, he realized that certainly he was blemished and lacking in the way of service of his father, meaning the attribute of love, which is desire and longing for the words of Torah. Avimelech was but an instrument by means of which it would be certain that Yitschok would take this to his heart.</p>
<p>Avimelech himself did not at all understand how the blessed God was conducting affairs through him, for (Tehillim, 147), &#x201C;they have not known His judgments.&#x201D; Once Yitschok had understood this, immediately it is said (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 26:18), &#x201C;and Yitschok returned and digged the wells of water that the servants of his father had dug.&#x201D; That is to say, by means of this he arrived at the attribute of love, since he saw the deficiency in himself, and then of itself a new desire for the words of Torah came to him (water and wells are often a symbol for Torah).</p>
<p>We find this concerning Shlomo haMelech. It is written in the Gemara (<italic>Sanhedrin</italic>, 21b), &#x201C;silver was considered as nothing in the days of Shlomo&#x201D; (Divrei HaYamim 2, 9:20), and it is written, &#x201C;Shlomo gave out his silver in Jerusalem like stones&#x201D; (Kings 1, 10:27). But there is a difference. The first verse refers to before he married Pharaoh&#x2019;s daughter (and then silver was as having no value); the second is after he married Pharaoh&#x2019;s daughter (and had the value of a stone, i.e., &#x201C;<italic>shave pruta</italic>.&#x201D; Rashi). At first, when he had great influence in Torah, then therefore he had less desire for words of Torah, which is called <italic>cessef</italic>, &#x201C;silver.&#x201D; <italic>Cessef</italic>, silver, is related to <italic>Cisuf</italic>, longing. Then after he married Pharaoh&#x2019;s daughter, which was accounted for him as a deficiency, then of itself a new desire materialized within him. This is why after he married Pharaoh&#x2019;s daughter it does not say, &#x201C;considered as nothing,&#x201D; regarding money (i.e., longing), for afterward the desire had taken hold within him.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and there Isaac&#x2019;s servants digged a well.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 26:25)</p>
<p>Concerning the wells of our Forefather Yitschok, for Yitschok strove to live by and attribute whereby he would be distinguished and separated from the nations of the world, and the digging of the wells hints at this.<sup><xref rid="fn40">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The first well was the words of Torah&#x2014;that He had chosen the words of Torah&#x2014;and the recognition of the Creator, and this understanding is not found among the nations. &#x201C;And the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with the herdsmen of Yitschok, saying, the water is ours&#x201D; (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 26:20). This means that they asserted that they also have this understanding, for they too have the recognition of God and the seven <italic>mitzvot</italic> that were commanded of them.</p>
<p>The second well signifies that he chose the form of Divine service, meaning Temple sacrifices, and the nations asserted that they too have a part in this, for the Temple would also accept certain offerings from Gentiles. On this it says (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 26:22), &#x201C;and he removed from that place, and digged another well, over which they did not argue.&#x201D; This well signifies that he chose the attribute of patience and the acceptance of suffering, that is to say, to suffer over the service of the blessed God, as it says in the Midrash (<italic>Bereshit</italic> Rabba, 69:8, but this is not found there), &#x201C;Yitschok reinstituted the way of suffering.&#x201D; &#x201C;And over this they did not argue,&#x201D; for immediately after this well had been dug they ran away, scorning this. This is why of this well it is said, &#x201C;for God has made room for us, and we will be fruitful in the land.&#x201D; This means that he asked of God that he not have to undergo great suffering, God forbid, but only to receive Divine visitations (punishment from God alone). What is the nature of Divine visitation? The Gemara explains (<italic>Arachin</italic>, 16b), &#x201C;even if he intended to pull three coins out of his pocket, and he only pulled out two [it is counted as a Divine visitation].&#x201D; &#x201C;And we will be fruitful in the land&#x201D; means that for all we have suffered, the blessed God will return to us good far greater than our loss. This is why the fourth well is called &#x201C;<italic>Sheva</italic>,&#x201D; (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 26:33) for <italic>Sheva</italic><sup><xref rid="fn41">24</xref></sup> hints at the future, as is known. That is, in the future the Holy One, blessed be He, will return goodness to all those who suffered over the sanctification of His blessed name.</p>
<p>This is the explanation of the Midrash (<italic>Bereshit</italic> Rabba, <italic>Bereshit</italic>, 65:10), &#x201C;And Yitschok&#x2019;s servants came&#x201D; (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 26:32). We do not know if they had found water or if they did not find water, but from what it says (verse 19), &#x201C;and found there a well of living water,&#x201D; we take it that they found living water.&#x201D; The explanation of &#x201C;we do not know if they found living water&#x201D; is, if it says with the first well, &#x201C;and they found a well of living water,&#x201D; then all the more so concerning the fourth well, which hints at the good that is hidden in the future. On this, also of third well he said, &#x201C;for now God has given us expansion and made us fruitful in the land.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And God appeared to him that same night, and He said, I am the God of Avraham your father &#x2026; and he built there an altar &#x2026; and the servants of Yitschok digged a well &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 26:24&#x2013;25)</p>
<p>It is not written here that he called it a name. This can be understood by means of a parable. It is similar to a man who is notified that the king will come and visit him on a certain day. He begins to prepare all kinds of food, and during his preparations the king comes and visits. So the man drops all that he is doing and receives the king. It is also like this here, for when God appeared to him, he did not turn to do anything else.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Eisav was forty years old, and he took for a wife Yehudit daughter of Beeri the Hitite, and Basmat daughter of Eilon the Hitite.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 26:34)</p>
<p>Here Eisav showed his true colors. The name Yehudit teaches of a drawing of energy, for the letter <italic>Yud</italic> is a single point that is ready to be made into other letters. She had a soft demeanor about her, and seemed to be drawn after Yitschok and Rivka. The name Basmat teaches of a calm mind, from the word for &#x201C;sweetened&#x201D; <italic>mevusam</italic> (a sweetened mind is a calm mind), as it says in the Gemara (<italic>Yoma</italic>, 76b), &#x201C;Rava said, wine and fragrant spices made me wise.&#x201D; Therefore it follows immediately that Basmat did not have this effect, only causing a bitter spirit, &#x201C;<italic>marat ruach</italic>,&#x201D; for Yitschok and Rivka (verse 35). <italic>Mara</italic>, &#x201C;bitter,&#x201D; is like <italic>zaken mamre</italic>, the rebellious elder. In other words, a bad smell. This is why in the Aramaic translation of Onkles it reads, &#x201C;<italic>mesarvan u&#x2019;margezan</italic>,&#x201D; contentious and infuriating. Contentious in corresponding to the name Yehudit to show that in actuality she had no affinity for Yitschok and Rivka, and infuriating corresponding to the name Basmat, for this was her nature even though her name signified a calm spirit.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And it came to pass that Yitschok was old, and his eyes had dimmed from seeing.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 27:1)</p>
<p>The matter of Yitschok Avinu was precisely the opposite of Moshe Rabeynu for Yitschok was not permitted to leave the land and thus his eyes became dim and the power of sight was taken from him. Moshe Rabeynu was not permitted to enter the land of Israel, but of him it was said (in <italic>Parshat Vaetchanan</italic>), &#x201C;see with your eyes that you will not cross this Jordan.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; See, the smell of my son is like the smell of the field which God has blessed.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 27:27)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Field&#x201D; hints at expansion in the realm of desire. Therefore Eisav was called a man of the field since he expanded into all kinds of lusts and evil desires. Yaakov Avinu, however, experienced expansion in <italic>Kedusha</italic>, and this is &#x201C;the smell of my son is like the smell of a field which God has blessed,&#x201D; meaning the field of the Holy Apples. (This is a term in kabbalah denoting <italic>Malchut</italic>&#x2014;Kingship, and the &#x201C;workers of the field&#x201D; are those involved in the study of divine mysteries.)</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; Lavan, son of Betuel the Aramean, brother of Rivka, Yaakov and Eisav&#x2019;s mother.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 28:5)</p>
<p>Yitschok made it known to Yaakov that he had already completed all the clarifications necessary between Israel and the nations of the world. Therefore he told his son that he need not occupy himself with this, for all his children would be called in the name of Israel. They, however, had to make even more important clarifications among the souls of Israel themselves, in order to distinguish which among them were the select, for there are many levels among them. This is even so for the future, of which it is said (Yesahya, 11:9), &#x201C;and the world will be filled with the knowledge of God,&#x201D; for it is also said (Yirmiya, 31:26), &#x201C;behold, the days are coming, says God, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Yehuda, with the seed of man, and the seed of beast.&#x201D; These are conflicting levels. Then man will no longer experience dread before his teacher, for man shall no longer learn from his brethren, but all that one innovates in the words of Torah will be made known to his neighbor with a brilliant countenance. This is because at this time everyone will know what his portion in Torah is with perfect clarity. Greatly did Yaakov suffer over these clarifications (in the course of Jewish spiritual history), and this was the entire matter with Yosef who asserted that he was the chosen among his brothers.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; Lavan &#x2026; brother of Rivka &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 28:5)</p>
<p>He told Yaakov that he shall see and understand, that just as his mother gave birth to good and evil at one time, so too he should be wary of Lavan who also contains a mixture of good and evil, and he should see that he receives only the good.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Eisav went to Yishmael, and took Machalat daughter of Yishmael &#x2026; for a wife.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 28:9)</p>
<p>It is written in the Midrash (<italic>Bereshit</italic> Rabba, 67:13), &#x201C;we learn from the name <italic>machalat</italic> that the Holy One, blessed be He, forgave [<italic>machal</italic>] all his sins.&#x201D; The main characteristic of Eisav was murder, while the main characteristic of Yishmael was licentiousness. With all the deficiencies in the world, each has a good side. For instance, with the root of anger, even though it is evil, nonetheless it has a good side for one may become angry with those who transgress the will of the blessed God. Also the root of licentiousness, even though it is evil, still it has a good side, for the deficiency of licentiousness can improve in a place void of the will of the blessed God, and it possesses a good side, for it is permitted for the good to improve. So when Eisav went and took the daughter of Yishmael, he clarified himself to show that there was no good side within him. This is because he becomes angry at the <italic>tsaddikim</italic> and is merciful with the evil, for he had combined these two deficiencies together. This is the explanation of why &#x201C;all his sins were forgiven,&#x201D; for He no longer needed to watch over the details of his sins, since it had been made clear that he had no good side within him, and had no life at all. By way of example, one who wants to take revenge on his neighbor remembers all that his neighbor has done to him. Yet when he sees that his neighbor has given himself over to rebellion against the kingdom (or has completely abandoned God&#x2019;s law), then he forgives him for everything, since he has no life at all. Thus it was here, that He forgave all his sins.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And God appeared unto him and said, do not descend to Egypt. Dwell in the land of which I shall tell unto you [Israel].&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 26:2)</p>
<p>Why was Yitschok forbidden from descending into Egypt, but Avraham was not? Yitschok needed to be constantly in a state of the fear of God, and a state of constriction. He had an innate feeling to guard himself in this, as is known. Therefore it was forbidden for him to go out, for whoever is in need of constriction, it is forbidden for him to go from his house and ask for a reason to work for his livelihood until God summons him to do so.<sup><xref rid="fn42">25</xref></sup></p>

<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> V<small>AYEITSE</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Yaakov departed from Beer Sheva, and went to Horan.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 28:10)</p>
<p>It is written in the Midrash (<italic>Bereshit</italic> Rabba, 68:1), &#x201C;A song of Ascents. I lift my eyes to the mountains [<italic>harim</italic> in Hebrew], from where will my help come (Tehillim, 121)? I lift my eyes to the parents [<italic>horim</italic> in Hebrew], to my teachers [<italic>hora&#x2019;ah</italic> in Hebrew is instruction] and my parents [<italic>herayon</italic> is pregnancy; all these words are similar to <italic>harim</italic>, mountains] &#x2026; He [Yaakov] went back and said, &#x2018;Why should I give up hope in my Creator? God forbid that I should give up hope in my Creator, but rather [as the verse continues], my help comes from God.&#x2019;&#x201D; When Yaakov went out from Beer Sheva, having no food to eat, nothing in his possession, and needing to go to Lavan to tend sheep for his livelihood, he became greatly despondent, for owing to his situation he saw himself as quite small in comparison to his father and grandfather. Avraham and Yitschok did not have to concern themselves at all with matters of this world, but were constantly involved in Divine service and <italic>ma&#x2019;ase merkava</italic>, the secrets of the Torah. But Yaakov had to occupy himself with these small matters. &#x201C;He returned and said, &#x2018;I will not give up hope in my Creator,&#x2019;&#x201D; which means that even though they were free for great and lofty matters, and I am occupied in mundane things, nonetheless there is also the service of the blessed God in this, for He is the one who formed all.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Yaakov departed &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 28:10)</p>
<p>Why did Yaakov Avinu not pray for his journey immediately upon leaving Beer Sheva, but waited until here (Beit El, north of Jerusalem) for his prayer, &#x201C;if God will be with me and guard me &#x2026;&#x201D; for this was the prayer for his journey? This matter may be understood based on what is written in the Gemara (<italic>Bechorot</italic>, 56a), &#x201C;Reb Asi said, Reb Yochanan said, if one acquires ten embryos in ten pregnant cows, all are brought into a pen and tithed.&#x201D; The Gemara asks, &#x201C;are we not taught, if one buys from a friend, or receives as a gift, he is exempt from having to tithe [for only those animals born while in his possession must he tithe]? Rebi Elazar said, I say that Reb Yochanan appeared in my dream and solved it favorably. [He must tithe the unborn animals, even if they were received as embryos in animals that did not need to be tithed], for it is written, &#x2018;so you shall do,&#x2019; [&#x201C;Give Me the firstborn of your sons, so you shall do to your cattle &#x2026;&#x201D; <italic>Shemot</italic> 22] meaning at the time they are being &#x2018;done&#x2019; [or born].&#x201D; This means that if the act of acquisition occurred at a time when he had an obligation of tithing, then he is exempt from tithing except for the unborn animals he acquired.</p>
<p>This matter is the same as it was with Yaakov Avinu. The solution of Rebi Elazar only came to him after he saw Reb Yochanan in a dream, meaning that the only one who would understand this is the one to whom the Holy One, blessed be He, shows His attribute of mercy. Reb Yochanan represents this quality of God&#x2019;s mercy, as it says in the Gemara (<italic>Berachot</italic>, 57a), &#x201C;whoever sees Yochanan in his dream, the miracle of miracles will be done for him.&#x201D; Therefore Yaakov Avinu could not pray first. He had seen in his prophetic spirit all that would happen to him on his journey, and he also knew that his prayer would finish with &#x201C;all that you give me I will give a tenth thereof,&#x201D; so he then asked the same question as mentioned earlier in the Gemara, that one who acquires something is exempt from tithing. Therefore he could not offer this prayer, for with Yaakov it was said (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 31:41), &#x201C;I have worked six years with your sheep,&#x201D; and if so, he was one who had acquired. It was only after the blessed God had appeared to him in a dream, and with Yaakov Avinu the blessed God was addressed with the title &#x201C;the merciful,&#x201D; as it is said (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 33:5), &#x201C;the children which God has been merciful in giving His servant.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Meaning, that as it is said in the Gemara, &#x201C;I saw Reb Yochanan in a dream&#x201D;; therefore Yaakov knew that something new would be done for him, as it is written, &#x201C;at the time of doing,&#x201D; and Yaakov bought the sheep from Lavan in their mother&#x2019;s wombs, before &#x201C;the time of doing,&#x201D; i.e., birth, as is explained, for (the verses clearly state that) he stipulated with Lavan on the sheep that would be born from now on, and the blessing of the blessed God came upon them in their mother&#x2019;s wombs. Thus they were required to be tithed. Once he understood this reason he could well pray, &#x201C;if God will be with me &#x2026; I will give a tenth &#x2026; &#x201D;.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And behold God was standing on him &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 28:13)</p>
<p>It is known that the principle of the blessed God&#x2019;s revelation in the world comes about by means of three factors&#x2014;place, time, and person. Place is the Holy Temple, where there is a revelation of His blessed Godliness; the choicest of times is Shabbat, the time when there is a revelation of His Godliness; and person, that his presence is revealed unto the souls of Israel. Here we have these three in completeness; the place of the Temple, as it is said, &#x201C;this is none other than the house of God&#x201D;; the choicest of times, for surely this revelation was on the holy Shabbat; and person, this is Yaakov Avinu, the choicest of souls, in whom all the souls of Israel are included, as it is written (Yesahya, 29:23), &#x201C;Yaakov shall not be ashamed &#x2026; for when he sees his children, the work of My hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify My name, and sanctify the Holy One of Yaakov &#x2026;&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And behold God was standing on him &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 28:13)</p>
<p>This verse is in itself a blessing. Just as the <italic>Kedusha</italic> (sanctity) of Shabbat is fixed and exists without any act of sanctification or awakening (from below) on the part of Israel, as it is sanctified only from God&#x2019;s side Himself, unlike the other festivals where Israel sanctifies them, so the <italic>Kedusha</italic> of Yaakov Avinu is like the <italic>Kedusha</italic> of Shabbat, sanctified by the blessed God and not needing any awakening. Therefore the verse does not say &#x201C;<italic>omed alav</italic>&#x201D; (the normal way of saying &#x201C;standing on him&#x201D;) but rather &#x201C;<italic>nitsav</italic>&#x201D; (a special kind of standing). The meaning of <italic>omed</italic> is that now He is standing on him but not before, only now from the power of his own awakening, while <italic>nitsav</italic> that He was always connected to him.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; And He said, I am Hashem, the God of Avraham your father, and the God of Yitschok &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 28:13)</p>
<p>It is written in the holy Zohar (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 150a), &#x201C;Yisrael is in the middle of everything, he receives the [Divine effluence] first from the source of everything &#x2026;&#x201D; This verse says &#x201C;your father&#x201D; regarding Avraham but not regarding Yitschok. The attribute of Avraham is love, and the attribute of Yitschok is fear. In a place where love is greatly abundant fear is constricted, and similarly when the attribute of fear is complete, then the attribute of love is constricted. However, with Yaakov Avinu, the two attributes balanced each other, and this is called the attribute of <italic>tiferet</italic>, harmony or beauty&#x2014;the attribute of Yaakov Avinu, which contains both of them, and they do not contradict each other.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; I will give to you and your offspring the land on which you are lying &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 28:13)</p>
<p>This blessing is saying that your thoughts were clear and clean even at the time you were lying down and sleeping. &#x201C;And all the families of the earth will be blessed in you and in your offspring&#x201D; means that you will adorn all the nations with your words of Torah, as it is written (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 4:6), &#x201C;for they are your wisdom and your understanding in the eyes of the nations.&#x201D; &#x201C;And behold, I am with you.&#x201D; &#x201C;I&#x201D; is written in the form <italic>Anochi</italic>, as opposed to the usual form <italic>Ani</italic>, for the additional letter, <italic>caf</italic>, teaches of the unceasing source of life, as is written in the <italic>Sefer Yetsira</italic> (Ch. 4:41 in the version of the Ari&#x201D;zal), and the Holy One, blessed be He, showed him all the processes of refinement that would have to be undergone and suffered, so therefore He promised him, &#x201C;and I will guard you everywhere you shall go, and I shall return you to this land.&#x201D; &#x201C;I shall return you&#x201D; (<italic>hashivoticha</italic> in Hebrew) is the term for returning a lost article. &#x201C;<italic>Hashevot aveida</italic>,&#x201D; for one cannot stand on the Torah unless he has first failed in keeping it (tractate <italic>Gittin</italic>, 43a), meaning that through the experience of failure the heart of man receives a greater desire to enter words of Torah into it than before. This is the formulation of <italic>hasivoticha</italic>, meaning <italic>tshuvah</italic>, the return to the Torah.</p>

<p>It is written in the Midrash (Kohollet Rabba 7:3), &#x201C;A man has three names&#x2014;one is what his father and mother called him, one is what other people call him, and one is the name he acquires for himself.&#x201D; To explain the matter, &#x201C;the name his father and mother called him,&#x201D; meaning that what is recognized in the form of the infant immediately when he is born, if he will be wise or foolish, lazy or industrious, and the like, for in the first generations this wisdom was clear and apparent to all; and they would see in the face of the infant the attributes of his nature, and in this way Lavan called his daughters appropriate names according to his understanding of their natures. The name Rachel teaches that she bears jealousy and (the need for) victory in her heart, but does not let this go out of her lips, as it is written (Yesahya, 53:7), &#x201C;as a lamb [<italic>rachel</italic>] is silent before its shearers,&#x201D; and her jealousy was for the sake of Heaven, as it is written, &#x201C;and Rachel was jealous of her sister&#x201D; (and wanted to populate the tribes who would bring the Torah to the world).</p>
<p>The name Leah is similar to the word <italic>nilei</italic>, or exhausted, meaning that she was always wearied with thirst for the salvations of the blessed God. Concerning the name that other people call him, this means what others see in his nature and dealings in his chosen occupation. As for the name he acquires for himself, in other words how he fixes and heals his deficiency, even the deficiencies he was born with, and this is the meaning of the verse (Mishlei, 3:9), &#x201C;it shall be health to your navel,&#x201D; meaning to the lack that he has from the moment of birth, for it says in the Gemara (<italic>Sotah</italic>, 45:2), &#x201C;the beginning of man&#x2019;s formation is from his navel.&#x201D; This is as the prophet Yesahya said (48:8), &#x201C;you are called a sinner from the womb,&#x201D; therefore the name he acquires for himself is far greater (than the one he is born with), for the word name always signifies the source of life, for the entire soul is exemplified in it.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And she said, this time I will thank God &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 29:35)</p>
<p>It is written in the Gemara (<italic>Megillah</italic>, 6b), &#x201C;Rabbi Yitschok said, if a man tells you, I struggled, but I did not find it, do not believe him. I did not struggle but I found it, do not believe him. I struggled and I found, believe him.&#x201D; Of course the Gemara does not deal in nonsense. If one who says I struggled and did not find, and we can see that he struggled greatly and did not find, and another says I did not struggle and still found, and we can see that he did not struggle and still he found, so if so, then why would we say not to believe them? Yet the depth of the matter is explained with Rachel and Leah. Surely with our matriarch Rachel, how much did she plead and pray that God would show His salvation and give her children, yet still it did not help her since it says, &#x201C;and Rachel was jealous of her sister.&#x201D; It had to be made clear whether this jealousy was <italic>kinat sofrim</italic>, a kind of jealousy for good conduct that is for the sake of Heaven, or the normal jealousy of the world according to nature, God forbid.</p>
<p>This is the way in which the blessed God deals with man. When He gives His good in the form of an attribute, in that very attribute He creates a lack, and the good within cannot come into action until the lack has been healed. Before this lack is healed all the prayers and self-mortification that a man attempts will be of no use until the lack is healed and he experiences salvation. Therefore, it was necessary to clarify Rachel&#x2019;s attribute of jealousy, and before this was clarified all prayer and struggle was useless.</p>
<p>This is why Yaakov became angry with her when she asked him to pray for her. This must be understood, for did she not act according to the law? For whoever has strife in his house is to go to the sage for him to request mercy upon him (<italic>Baba Batra</italic>, 116a; so Rachel was doing just this in going to Yaakov in her distress). This same question was asked by the Ramban of blessed memory. Yet since it was written before she went to Yaakov, &#x201C;and Rachel was jealous,&#x201D; therefore Yaakov became angry because before she even came to him she needed to clarify her jealousy. Then when she said to Yaakov, &#x201C;here is my handmaid before you &#x2026; and I too will build [the future tribes] from her,&#x201D; we see that her intentions were for the sake of Heaven because she included her handmaid in her household (that she did it for the children and not just for herself). And this is the meaning of &#x201C;I struggled and did not find, do not believe him,&#x201D; for even though we see that he truly struggled, he did not exert himself in the place where he was supposed to struggle.</p>
<p>This is like one who wants to enter a house but knocks on a wall far away from the door; even if he knocks all day it will not help him. If he goes to the door and knocks, then it will be opened for him right away. &#x201C;I did not struggle but I found&#x201D; is understood from Leah. When she gave birth to Yehuda she said, &#x201C;this time I will thank God,&#x201D; since she did not ask for this, already having taken her portion before in giving birth to more children more quickly than the other matriarchs, so it seems as if she did not struggle but found. Yet with the blessed God all was according to judgment. The blessed God testified concerning her that she had exerted herself greatly with her first three children, as she said (with Reuven), &#x201C;for God has seen my poverty&#x201D; (with Shimon), &#x201C;for God has heard that I am despised.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Thus the blessed God gave her Yehuda, like a man who gives a great portion to a friend who takes a great amount from him. The additional amount that the Holy One, blessed be He, gives is greater than the initial portion. This is the preciousness of the soul of Yehuda. He was greater than his brothers because all the greatness went out from him. On this she said, &#x201C;this time I will thank God,&#x201D; for a soul like this is not born from the power, reward, or righteousness of a person, but only from the blessing of the blessed God. When it comes from the power of man it only comes according to his actions, but when the blessed God gives the additional portion from His side then it is without any limit; therefore His additional portion is greater than the main portion. Therefore when it says &#x201C;<italic>vatahar od</italic>,&#x201D; &#x201C;and she conceived again,&#x201D; concerning Shimon and Levi the <italic>ta&#x2019;am</italic> (cantillation mark for the melody) called <italic>munach zarka</italic> is used, yet when it says &#x201C;and she conceived again,&#x201D; for Yehuda, the <italic>ta&#x2019;am</italic> for the melody is <italic>kadma ve&#x2019;azlah</italic>, meaning without any effort. Understand this.<sup><xref rid="fn43">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>This is as we pray in the <italic>Amida</italic> prayer, in the first of the Eighteen Benedictions, &#x201C;who owns all, and remembers the kindness of the forefathers, and brings a redeemer to their children&#x2019;s children for the sake of His name with love.&#x201D; &#x201C;Owns all&#x201D; means that the blessed God is involved with all of His creation, for nothing He created was superfluous. &#x201C;And remembers the kindnesses of the Patriarchs&#x201D; means that the blessed God remember the good that the Patriarchs would do with all their power and all their souls, bringing the entire world close to the blessed God, and not standing for a second without love and fear. Nevertheless, &#x201C;He brings a redeemer to their children&#x2019;s children for the sake of His name,&#x201D; for it is not enough to reveal the light of the king messiah in the merit of the Patriarchs, only for the sake of His name. This is as it is written in the Gemara (<italic>Sanhedrin</italic>, 100a), &#x201C;whoever gives the poor his entire amount in this world, the Holy One, blessed be He, gives him His entire amount in the world to come.&#x201D; Because they exerted themselves with all their power, that the glory of Heaven should be revealed by means of them, therefore the attribute of justice dictates that the Holy One, blessed be He, should pay them according to the full amount of His blessed power.</p>

<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> V<small>AYISHLACH</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Yaakov Avinu came to &#x2026; Shchem, &#x2026; and he graced the faces of the city &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 33:18) (<italic>Vayichan et p&#x2019;nei ha&#x2019;eer</italic> is normally translated, &#x201C;and he camped before the city.&#x201D;)</p>
<p>&#x201C;The faces of the city&#x201D; means its honored citizens, and &#x201C;the faces of the city&#x201D; at that time were Shchem and Hamor. The term <italic>vayichan</italic> (meaning &#x201C;pitched,&#x201D; but also meaning &#x201C;graced&#x201D;) means that their grace was aroused in his sight (he liked them). This relates to what is found in the writings of the holy Ari&#x201D;zal (<italic>Shaar haGilgulim</italic>, Ch. 50) that &#x201C;Shchem was later reincarnated into Zimri ben Salu son of Dinah.&#x201D; Therefore his soul desired her now also, as it said (<italic>Bereshit</italic> 34:8), &#x201C;My son Shchem&#x2019;s soul desired your daughter.&#x201D; This means that he did not want to marry with the women of Canaan, only Dinah; and in this he found favor in the sight of Yaakov, for he was somewhat connected to Yaakov Avinu.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And E-lohim ascended from him in the place where He spoke with him.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 35:13)</p>
<p>For the blessed God showed Yaakov that he needed to undergo further <italic>birrurim</italic>, or clarifications,<sup><xref rid="fn44">27</xref></sup> and this is, &#x201C;and God ascended from him,&#x201D; as if he still needed to hold on to Him. &#x201C;In the place where He spoke with him&#x201D; means concerning the selfsame matter with which the Torah was dealing&#x2014;financial dealings, needed further clarifications, etc., for it was not yet completed. The same intention concerns what was said of Avraham (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 17:22), &#x201C;and E-lohim ascended from upon Avraham,&#x201D; after the section discussing <italic>brit milah</italic>, for also now he needed to undergo further clarifications with the trial of the binding of Yitschok. There, however, it does not say &#x201C;in the place where He spoke with him,&#x201D; for the needed clarification and the immediate subject were not the same.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Yisroel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eider.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 35:21)</p>
<p>This concerns what is written in the Midrash (Ruth Rabba, 2:7), &#x201C;even after all the tribulations and adventures of Yaakov Avinu, the death of Rachel was more difficult on him than all of them.&#x201D; It is the way of the <italic>Tsaddikim</italic>, and especially Yaakov Avinu, to strengthen his heart greatly, and not to question the attributes of the Holy One, blessed be He, for certainly everything is for the good. This is why it says here after the death of Rachel, &#x201C;and he pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eider,&#x201D; meaning that he strengthened his heart to not wonder after the attributes (the stern judgments) of the Holy One, blessed be He. Both &#x201C;tower&#x201D; and <italic>eider</italic> are terms denoting great strength (<italic>eider</italic> is a herd of animals), and truly the blessed God had a deep intent with the death of Rachel, as mentioned in the holy Zohar (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 175a). This is as it said (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 35:22), &#x201C;and it was, when Yisroel dwelt in the land &#x2026;&#x201D; &#x201C;Dwelling&#x201D; signifies accepting with ease, for he accepted it easily, and did not at all question His attributes, for surely the blessed God intended a depth in this that was above his apprehension.</p>
<p>Then afterward, the blessed God showed him that it was proper to ask for the depth to be revealed, for a man needs to ask for this. Even though questioning His attributes is forbidden, nevertheless he must ask the blessed God to show him what He wanted to effect with this depth, for it is the way of the blessed God not to conceal anything for those who long for His mercy. He showed him this in the incident with Reuven, and after (in the same verse), &#x201C;and the sons of Yisroel were twelve.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn45">28</xref></sup> This means that the blessed God opened for him the nature of the order of the enumeration of the tribes, for every time the tribes are enumerated in a different order, and each order is a study in itself for those who turn themselves to the words of Torah. Therefore we come to this order now, after the death of Rachel.</p>
<p>This is the order of the tribes according to its various enumerations in sixteen places.</p>
<ol>
<li>Order of their births in <italic>Parshat Toldot</italic>
<p>Reuven, Shimon, Levi, Yehuda, Dan, Naftali, Gad, and Asher, Yissachar, Zevulun, Yosef, and Binyamin.</p></li>

<li>The order of the journeying of the banners in <italic>Parshat Beha&#x2019;aloteicha</italic>
<p>Yehuda, Yissachar, Zevulun, and the sons of Gershon went &#x2026; Reuven, Shimon, Gad, and the Kehatites went &#x2026; Efriam, Menashe, Binyamin, Dan, Asher, Naftali.</p></li>
<li>The order in <italic>Parshat Shlach</italic>, that Moshe sent (to spy the land)
<p>Reuven, Shimon, Yehuda, Yissachar, Efriam, and Binyamin, Zevulun, Menashe, Dan, Asher, Naftali, Gad.</p></li>
<li>According to the order of the allotment of the land, <italic>Parshat Pinchas</italic>
<p>Reuven, Shimon, Gad, Yehuda, Yissachar, Zevulun, Menashe, Efriam, Binyamin, Dan, Asher, Naftali.</p></li>
<li>&#x201C;A prince of each tribe shall inherit the land,&#x201D; <italic>Parshat Maasei</italic>
<p>Yehuda, Shimon, Binyamin, Dan, Menashe, Efriam, Zevulun, Yissachar, Asher, Naftali</p></li>
<li>In <italic>Parshat Tavo</italic>, &#x201C;these shall stand to bless&#x201D;
<p>Shimon, and Levi, Yehuda, Yissachar, Yosef and Binyamin, and these &#x2026; Reuven, Gad, Asher, Zevulun, Dan, Naftali.</p></li>
<li>The order in which Moshe blessed them in <italic>Parshat Ve&#x2019;Zot HaBracha</italic>
<p>Reuven, Yehuda, Levi, Binyamin, Yosef, Zevulun, Yissachar, Gad, Dan, Naftali, Asher.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Here the tribes are enumerated sixteen times, with various changes in their places, and each one is a study in itself. According to this the members of the great assembly codified the sixteen praised (in the blessing immediately following the morning recitation of <italic>Shema</italic>) of <italic>Emet v&#x2019;yatsiv</italic>, &#x201C;true and upright,&#x201D; and the initiated will understand.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And these are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned a king to the children of Israel.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 36:31)</p>
<p>In this <italic>Parsha</italic> the Holy One, blessed be He, began to show the everso-fine clarifications (<italic>birrurim</italic>) between Israel and the nations of the world. For the <italic>kelipa</italic> (&#x201C;shell&#x201D; or evil force) of Edom is the greatest of all, as there is only a slight and fine difference between it and Israel, for immediately after Israel begins his life, Eisav begins his (as Rashi notes that the first seed to conceive was Israel, then Eisav). Thus a great difference is recognized between Israel and all the nations of the world, and even in comparison to Ishmaelites, even though they are of the seed of Avraham, there is still a great difference, because from the mother&#x2019;s side they have no connection to Israel. Yet compared to Israel there was no visible difference seen, for they both seem clean regarding their mother, but it was the will of the blessed Creator that Yaakov would be the chosen one, and this is as it is written (Malachi, 1:2), &#x201C;Is not Eisav Yaakov&#x2019;s brother?&#x201D; &#x201C;Brother&#x201D; meaning that the two were equal, or that at the time of conception when the level of one over the other is unrecognizable for as of yet there are no <italic>mitzvot</italic> and good deeds, no sin or transgression, and both are from Yitschok and Rivka. Yet nevertheless, &#x201C;and I loved Yaakov and hated Eisav,&#x201D; meaning that it was only His blessed will.</p>
<p>This is as it is written (Yechezkel, 23:20), &#x201C;for their flesh is that of asses, and their urine of horses.&#x201D; That is to say, that at the moment of conception the blessed God made it clear that this drop will be in the purity of <italic>Kedusha</italic> (holiness), and the other the urine of horses. Even though nothing evil was recognized in Eisav, he is anyhow compared to a pig (<italic>Vayikra</italic> Rabba, 13:5). It is written in the Gemara (<italic>Bechorot</italic> 8a), &#x201C;an apple tree grows after sixty days, and so too does a pig give birth after sixty days.&#x201D; For the letter <italic>samech</italic> (which is sixty) is in the form of a bow, and a bow is a refuge of strength, meaning that Eisav says that he finds a refuge of strength in the blessed God since he was born from Yitschok and Rivka just like us, for Israel is likened to an apple. Yet the blessed God is the one who makes it clear that with Eisav it is only on the surface, while Israel is truly cleaved to God. And whoever is knowledgeable in the names of the angels can see this clearly.</p>

<chapter>
<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> V<small>AYEISHEIV</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Yaakov dwelled &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 37:1)</p>
<p>&#x201C;And Yaakov shall return, and be quiet and contented, and none shall disturb him&#x201D; (Yirmiya, 30:10). &#x201C;And it shall be afterward I will pour out my spirit &#x2026; your elders shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions&#x201D; (Joel, 3:1). Meaning, all the actions done in the world seem to be the actions of flesh and blood, but ideas and thoughts seem to come from the blessed God. But in these <italic>Parshot</italic> the blessed God teaches us that actions are in the hands of the blessed God. Thoughts come from the side of man, and all the actions that man does are only those that he is given leave to do, as it is written in the Gemara (<italic>Berachot</italic>, 33b), &#x201C;all is in the hands of Heaven.&#x201D; So the performance of a commandment or the opposite is in the hands of the blessed God, and only occasionally does He make the performance of a commandment dependant on man.</p>
<p>We find in the Gemara (<italic>Sotah</italic>, 10a), &#x201C;on the incident of Yehuda and Tamar, where he said, &#x2018;she is more righteous than I,&#x2019; &#x2018;than I,&#x2019; &#x2018;<italic>mimeni</italic>,&#x2019; also means &#x2018;from Me.&#x2019; Our Rabbis interpreted this to mean that a Divine voice came out of heaven to say that the whole incident came forth from Me.&#x201D; It is said concerning the dreams of Yosef haTsaddik that they were inconsequential daydreams (that thoughts are really from the side of man), and truly his brothers gave him this response when he told them his dream. When Yaakov Avinu dreamed his dream en route to Lavan, he investigated it and taught all the depth within it to the tribes, and they studied it, each time receiving new Torah insights into its nature, for so many deep Torah insights are contained in this dream.</p>
<p>So when Yosef haTsaddik said to them that he also dreamed dreams as precious as his father&#x2019;s, they answered him, &#x201C;will you surely rule over us?&#x201D; For how could you resemble our father, for is not our father in a state of awe and cleaving to the blessed God all day long, and for this the blessed God shows him dreams (of the Torah&#x2019;s depths), for he is cleaving the blessed God even in his sleep. But you are not on this level, so all your dreams are as inconsequential fancies, and through your desire for greatness and an elevated status you dream these dreams, for you have no greatness from the qualities of the fear of God or humility (as we will see, this is not the case).</p>
<p>Yaakov Avinu, on the other hand, was constantly engaging in Divine service through these qualities&#x2014;fear&#x2014;meaning that he saw how God watches over everything, as it is written (Tehillim, 33:14), &#x201C;from Your dwelling place you watch&#x201D; and &#x201C;he does not sleep&#x201D; (Tehillim, 121:4). And humility&#x2014;meaning he did not find himself superior to any part of creation, for &#x201C;the superiority of a man over a beast is naught.&#x201D; This, &#x201C;naught&#x201D; <italic>ayin</italic> in Hebrew, means that even though that truly from God&#x2019;s point of view there is a difference between man and beast, from man&#x2019;s point of view there is no (<italic>ain</italic>) distinction. This is &#x201C;and Yaakov dwelled in the land of his father&#x2019;s sojournings,&#x201D; signifying fear (Zohar <italic>Bereshit</italic> 180a), and the continuation, &#x201C;in the land of Canaan,&#x201D; means humility. (The name Canaan is similar to the word for humility or submissiveness, <italic>c&#x2019;niya</italic>.) And as the Midrash says, &#x201C;he asked to live in peace.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This particular kind of peace occurs when a man conducts himself in a way as to remove himself and to guard himself from all doubt and all evil action. Concerning this, the blessed God told him that as long as man is connected to his body, it is not possible to reach the highest levels of self-guarding, fear, and humility. This is because the blessed God desires the actions of man, and in this world one must conduct himself with love, which means to act in ways that are not in the highest state of refinement. This is the formulation of the verse in Yirmiya, &#x201C;and Yaakov returned [<italic>shav</italic>],&#x201D; similar to &#x201C;He restores [<italic>yeshovev</italic>] my soul,&#x201D; in the delight of the words of Torah. &#x201C;And be quiet,&#x201D; meaning on the level of Shabbat, &#x201C;and strangers shall stand and tend your sheep,&#x201D; (Yesahya, 61:5). &#x201C;And content,&#x201D; meaning in thought, not to fear from wars and transient events. &#x201C;And none shall disturb you,&#x201D; meaning that even in your sleep you shall cleave to the blessed God, and not to fear, for nothing shall cause you to withdraw from the blessed God. This was the accusation of the tribes against Yosef haTsaddik. He too conducted himself in the attribute of fear. On this it says in the Midrash (<italic>Bereshit</italic> Rabba, 84:8), &#x201C;the light of his face was similar to Yaakov,&#x201D; meaning that he delved deeply into these two attributes of fear and humility, in order that he could proceed in confidence. Thus it was said of him, &#x201C;he was the son of his old age,&#x201D; meaning that just as Yaakov Avinu conducted himself according to the attributes of Yitschok Avinu, namely fear, so too did Yosef conduct himself with this attribute, and with humility, like his father.</p>
<p>For this reason the blessed God was also exacting with Yosef haTsaddik down to a hairsbreadth, for even though these attributes are good, one must anyhow trust in God also, for the actions done on the part of man are not an everlasting structure. Even though Yosef guarded himself greatly, and from him emerged all the kings of Israel who were called great, as it says in the Midrash (<italic>Bereshit</italic> Rabba, 84:14), &#x201C;It was the custom of great men to wear sackcloth [to suffer], for Yehoram dressed in sackcloth,&#x201D; yet still, it is said of them (Kings 1, 11:39), &#x201C;yet not all the days.&#x201D; This means that (even through all their suffering) an everlasting structure was not to be in their portion, but rather in the portion of Yehuda. Even though he (Yosef) acted so his righteousness would stand in the world throughout the 6,000 years (until the redemption), still, the everlasting structure was the portion of Yehuda. And Yosef haTsaddik continually voiced the complaint&#x2014;why is it that the blessed God causes all the actions of my brother Yehuda to succeed, yet with me, the Holy One, blessed be He, is exacting down to a hairsbreadth?</p>
<p>So, in an answer to his query, the blessed God showed him the example of the wine steward and the baker. Every king has two attendants, one a wine steward and the other a baker. Truly, with the wine steward, if the king finds a fly in his cup it is not proper to punish him, for what could he do? The fly is an independent living creature, and if once the cup has been passed to the king the fly decides to land into the cup, then it is not possible to guard from it. Yet with the baker, if there is a pebble in the bread, isn&#x2019;t it his fault, for the pebble is not a living being and he could have prevented it? In this the blessed God shows Yosef that he corresponds to the baker, for the blessed God established him in a bright and clean place over against Eisav, in order that Eisav would not have any room for accusation. This is why established Yosef against him, clean in all respects, as it is written (Ovadiah, 1:18), &#x201C;and the house of Yosef is a flame [and the house of Eisav straw &#x2026; and they shall devour them].&#x201D; He gave him strength to be able to overcome all his desires. Then if some (impure) aspect comes to him from without, it is counted against him as a crime. Only out of the blessed God&#x2019;s love for Yosef did He put another man in his place, and kill the baker, as it is written (Yesahya, 43:4), &#x201C;and I will give men in your place.&#x201D; From this he understood the matter.</p>
<p>Yehuda corresponds to the wine steward, for King David is called &#x201C;the King&#x2019;s jester&#x201D; (Zohar <italic>Shemot</italic>, 107a), and the songs of David are sung over the wine libation offerings. Truly, with Yehuda, concerning the incident with Tamar and all the happenings of the tribe of Yehuda similar to this, the blessed God instilled them with such a great power of desire that it was not even within their power to overcome it. As it is explained (<italic>Bereshit</italic> Rabba, 85:9), &#x201C;the angel in charge of desire forced him.&#x201D; Therefore it was not his fault that he could not overpower his inclination to evil. This is the meaning of &#x201C;the King&#x2019;s jester,&#x201D; meaning that he lets himself be won by the blessed God, as King David said (Tehillim, 51:6), &#x201C;in order that You should be shown right in Your word,&#x201D; for whoever it pleases You to be right, You or I.</p>
<p>This is as it is said (Yesahya, 11:13), &#x201C;Efriam shall not be jealous of Yehuda, and Yehuda shall not distress Efriam.&#x201D; These two tribes were always opposing each other, for the force of life which the blessed God gave to Efriam (from Yosef) was of the nature that it always looked to every action regarding its judgment and law, without moving from it. Therefore, when the writings warn Israel against sinning, then the aim of the Torah will be to say (Amos, 5:6), &#x201C;lest the house of Yosef should prevail like fire,&#x201D; meaning that they should concern themselves that there should be no opponents to their actions. The root of life for Yehuda, however, is to look to the blessed God regarding the course of every action. Even though he sees where the judgment leans, still he looks to the blessed God in order to see the depth of the truth of the matter. It could be that even though the judgment is true according to the claims of the plaintiffs, yet still it is not at the deepest level of truth, for fear that one would make a false claim.</p>
<p>This is as we find (<italic>Nedarim</italic>, 25a) in the case of Rava&#x2019;s cane. (One had not paid another a debt, and the other asserted that he had paid it. They told him to swear on a Torah scroll, and before doing so, he said to his lender, &#x201C;hold my cane,&#x201D; inside of which he had hidden the amount owed. He then swore on the Torah that all the money he owed he had paid to his hand. Which, of course, only he could know was true. The lender was furious at the apparent false oath and broke the cane, the money spilling onto the floor.) So it is with all matters, and this is the root of life for Yehuda, to look to God in everything and not to act simply in a way that is accepted or habitual. Even though yesterday he acted in such a way, yet anyhow, today he does not want to rely on his former response, only that the blessed God should illuminate His will into him anew. This matter sometimes necessitates even doing something against the law, for, &#x201C;it is a time to do for God, the Torah has been suspended&#x201D; (Tehillim, 119:126). In this way these two tribes oppose each other. Of the future it is said that, &#x201C;Efriam will not be jealous of Yehuda, and Yehuda will not distress Efriam.&#x201D; Then Efriam will not accuse Yehuda for the times when he goes outside of the law. He will not trouble him over this, because the blessed God will show Efriam the intentions of Yehuda, that his intentions are for the sake of Heaven and not for his own benefit. Then, of itself, there will be peace between them.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Yaakov returned to the land of his father&#x2019;s sojournings, in the land of Canaan.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 37:1)</p>
<p>In this <italic>Parsha</italic> we find the first fine spiritual clarifications (<italic>birrurin</italic>) that occurred internally within Israel. Avraham Avinu was the root of the attribute of love, for he separated out all the kinds of love in the world that were not love solely given over to the will of the blessed God. Yitschok Avinu was already refined in this attribute, for he was born from Avraham Avinu after he had refined himself with all such clarifications. So his attribute was only to refine fear, that is, to disencumber fear from any variety that is not the fear of God alone. With Yaakov Avinu, these two attributes were already well refined, and all of his dealings were in the attribute of <italic>tiferet</italic>&#x2014;beauty (balance, splendor), termed the &#x201C;middle bolt,&#x201D; (See <italic>Shemot</italic>, 36:33) to arrange fear in its proper place and time, and so too with love. In the days of Avraham Avinu the depth of the preciousness of the Jewish people was not yet clearly recognized, and also in the days of Yitschok, therefore they had to refine themselves from the attributes of the nations and to separate themselves from their power. This was not so with Yaakov Avinu, who had the twelve tribes of Yeshurun, who were all in their proper place, and not one deviated from the will of the blessed God. Here, all his efforts were to refine them among themselves, to clarify who would come first and who would come after. This too caused Yaakov Avinu suffering, for he asserted that Yosef was the chosen one. Yosef also thought this. These are the fine internal clarifications that occurred within Israel, and will be explained further.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Yehuda said to his brothers, what will we profit in killing our brother?&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 37:26)</p>
<p>It is written in the Gemara (<italic>Sanhedrin</italic>, 6b), &#x201C;whoever blesses [congratulates] Yehuda is called a compromiser.&#x201D; (Negatively interpreted as one who &#x201C;sells out.&#x201D;) Concerning this, it is said in the Gemara (<italic>Nedarim</italic>, 32b), &#x201C;at the time of the evil inclination, no one remembers the inclination to good.&#x201D; When the blessed God wants to test man, He causes him to forget the very basis of the prohibition in which he is being tested. So it was with the tribes when they wanted to kill Yosef; then the basis of the prohibition against killing was hidden from them, and he was only saved from counsel outside the realm of Torah. This also saved his brothers from sin. Yehuda was a great sage in the wisdom of this world, therefore he devised advice and said, &#x201C;what profit [<italic>ma beitsa</italic>].&#x201D; This means, even though that it seemed to him (erroneously) that it was lawfully permitted to kill him, as will be explained, still, what benefit will we receive by killing him?<sup><xref rid="fn46">29</xref>, <xref rid="fn47">30</xref></sup> And from this (not killing him) our father will love us so much more. And immediately when they decided among themselves not to kill him, they saw the basis of the prohibition, that from the side of the law it was also forbidden. One is forbidden to defend himself by means of this advice based on the wisdom of this world anytime he wants to, he may only do this at a time that he is being tested and there is no other advice to be used. However, he is not to separate from the prohibition at a time when he remembers that it is forbidden, for it is forbidden for him to separate himself based on this kind of counsel unless it a direct commandment from the blessed One. This is the explanation of the Gemara, &#x201C;all who congratulate Yehuda,&#x201D; meaning for one who thinks that it always proper to do as Yehuda did, is called a compromiser (or one who compromises with the Torah), for even Yehuda used such advice only at a time of testing.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Let us go and sell him to the Ishmaelites &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 37:27)</p>
<p>The tribes had first sentenced him to death, since he had spoken of their evils to their father. In their view this sin was in the very root of his life, God forbid, for creating a separation between them and their father was in their eyes akin to separating the Holy One, blessed be He, from the community of Israel (His indwelling presence). At that time Yaakov was the &#x201C;<italic>Tsaddik Yesod Olam</italic>,&#x201D; the righteous one who is the foundation of the world, on whom the entire world rests, and he was the place where the blessed God revealed himself in this world, and they were at that time all of Israel. They were all included in the word &#x201C;One&#x201D; in <italic>Shema Yisroel, Echad</italic> (<italic>alef</italic>, 1; <italic>het</italic>, 8; <italic>dalet</italic>, 4). One was Yaakov; eight were the eight children of Leah and Rachel; and four were the four children of the handmaids. They understood that Yosef wanted to separate this unification. Only Yehuda in his wisdom said that the judgment was not arbitrated in this way. Maybe he is good and we are mistaken about him. In that case we should not do anything about him, and only let the blessed God make it clear concerning him, and if he is good in his root then certainly God will rescue him from all sin and he will not be lost in exile. So therefore the blessed God refined him, purifying his soul through the incident with the wife of Potiphar. For the <italic>brit</italic> of the foreskin corresponds to the <italic>brit</italic> of the tongue (<italic>Sefer Yetsira</italic>, 1:43), and when he emerged refined from this, then he was also refined and clean concerning the <italic>loshan horah</italic> (evil speech) of which his brothers had suspected him.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and Yehuda went down from his brothers &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 38:1)</p>
<p>Why did Yehuda go and wed a wife at this particular time? As he saw how Yaakov refused to be consoled, and as he was the one who had to bring Yosef&#x2019;s coat to his father, he had became greatly depressed, and felt as if, God forbid, there was no more hope. So he went to marry a wife, saying, &#x201C;perhaps I will have good children from whom will grow an everlasting structure.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn48">31</xref></sup> Then afterward, the Holy One, blessed be He, caused him to understand the following. If, God forbid, it is as you think, and there is no hope for you, and you have no life at your root, if so, then even if you give birth to a hundred, they will not have any more life than you. For with the blessed God, the channel through which He sends life must itself be of life. Then, if it is as you think, that you will only have temporary life, then it will be so also with your descendants. Therefore, when he arrived at the clarification of the matter, he fathered Shela, his name Shela meaning misled, the mistake he made in this matter. This is why his first two sons died, and Shela remained alive.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Er the firstborn of Yehuda was evil in the sight of God &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 38:7)</p>
<p>Rashi explains, &#x201C;he was afraid that she would become pregnant and lose her beauty.&#x201D; The sin of Er emerged in a way similar to what is explained. &#x201C;Yaakov asked to dwell in peace [but the troubles of Yosef came upon him. The righteous desire to dwell in peace. The Holy One, blessed be He said, it is not enough for the righteous that which is prepared for them in the world to come, but they seek also to dwell in peace in this world].&#x201D; &#x201C;To dwell in peace&#x201D; means to guard oneself from all actions that could lead him into uncertainty. But this is not the will of the blessed God in this world. Therefore the blessed God showed Yaakov, saying, &#x201C;look who will come from your progeny [Er], and he also intentionally avoided action in order not to suffer a loss. The only difference is he was involved in physical matters. See and understand the value of this.&#x201D; Yaakov Avinu also had this deficiency, but his deficiency concerned the service of the blessed God where he guarded himself so as not to mar the beauty of his service. When this intention branches out into the body it becomes an explicit sin.</p>
<p>So it was with all the thoughts of the Patriarchs, which to them was quite small, and then afterward, when the Holy One, blessed be He, clarifies them, and creates a unique soul from this thought, then whatever will be clarified is clarified. The sin of Er and Onan follows according to what is explained in the Mishna (<italic>Avot</italic>, 2:1), &#x201C;Rabbi said, what is the proper course for a man to follow? All that brings honor to he who does it, and honor to his fellow man.&#x201D; &#x201C;Honor to he who does it&#x201D; actually means that the action which the man does will find favor in the eyes of his fellow man. &#x201C;Honor to his fellow man&#x201D; means that it will be good at its depth, from the depths of his life, at the very form (essence) of man.<sup><xref rid="fn49">32</xref></sup> A man must look into all his actions to make sure they are refined according to these two requirements. If a man happens into an action that does not effect these two refinements, on this we have the disagreement between the house of Shammai and the house of Hillel in the tractate <italic>Ketubot</italic> (16b). &#x201C;Our Rabbis taught, how should one dance in front of a new bride? The house of Shammai says, the bride just as she is [one should not exaggerate in her presence and say she is beautiful if she is not].&#x201D;</p>
<p>Their assertion is that the main principle is &#x201C;bringing honor to the one who does it,&#x201D; for if they were to say, &#x201C;a beautiful and comely bride,&#x201D; it would not bring honor in the view of men because we are told to &#x201C;stay far from lies.&#x201D; &#x201C;The house of Hillel says, a beautiful and comely bride,&#x201D; meaning that even if it does not bring honor to the one who does it, still it is not necessary to look at this, since it brings honor from his fellow man. This means that man&#x2019;s intellect will necessitate this.<sup><xref rid="fn50">33</xref></sup> This is as it explained, &#x201C;The house of Hillel said to the house of Shammai, according to your words if one has made a bad purchase in the market, should one praise it in his eyes or criticize it? Surely, one should praise it in his eyes.&#x201D; It was that Er primarily regarded &#x201C;bringing honor from his fellow man,&#x201D; for it is well known that every birth will only come about through concealment and forgetting, just as the seed that is sown will not sprout unless it is destroyed and deteriorates in the soil. So too the drop of life, which descends from the brain, will not bring about birth until it becomes coarse and conglomerates in the seed of man. For at the moment of conception the consciousness of man (before God) is interrupted and forgotten, and if a man&#x2019;s consciousness could stand constantly before his Creator then he would not be able to experience this concealment and forgetting necessary for conception.</p>
<p>Therefore Er, since he only looked toward &#x201C;bringing honor from his fellow man,&#x201D; meaning that he always had a clear and brilliant intellect, and stood in the presence of the blessed God, therefore he did not want to detract from this. This is the meaning of &#x201C;he did not want to detract from [or mar] her beauty,&#x201D; meaning that he did not want to mar the splendor of Israel. Onan took the other way, for his actions were done from seeing the intentions of his father, that his seed would only be called in the name of his brother. Therefore it was evil in his view that he would not be able to fix himself, but only the soul of his brother. This caused him to voice angry complaints, and the very same matter exists for great <italic>Tsaddikim</italic>. And the action of Onan is called &#x201C;bringing honor to the one who does the action,&#x201D; so therefore there was a rectification of their souls when afterward Peretz and Zerach were born.</p>
<p>Peretz was the soul of Er, because Peretz is a term denoting vigorous strength,<sup><xref rid="fn51">34</xref></sup> meaning &#x201C;bringing honor from his fellow man.&#x201D; This means that even when the honor turns against his fellow man (into something else), he shall not look at this. Zerach was the soul of Onan, for his very name proves that his attribute is &#x201C;bringing honor in contrast to his fellow man.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn52">35</xref></sup> Concerning these two, Peretz and Zerach, the blessed God said, &#x201C;she is more righteous than I [also, from me],&#x201D; (what Yehuda said of Tamar, their mother, and as the Gemara explains) &#x201C;from Me came forth hidden things.&#x201D; This means that even though Er and Onan were not worthy in God&#x2019;s eyes, still their souls in Peretz and Zerach would be fixed. Even though it would seem that the descendants of Peretz would do things against God&#x2019;s law, as we find with the kingdom of the House of David, the blessed God would testify that it was always because of &#x201C;a time to do for God.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Even though in terms of the action it seems that Er&#x2019;s sin was greater than that of Onan, nonetheless his soul was greater at the depth than the soul of Onan, for the kingdom of the House of David was born from him. For the Holy One, blessed be He, conducts all the structures of the kingdom of the House of David, according to structures such as these, even though at the time of the action it seemed like a sin. In this way Yehuda thought that Tamar was a harlot because she was covering her face, which really means that the matter was concealed; a secret from the blessed God. This is as it is explained (<italic>Sotah</italic>, 10b, &#x201C;she is more righteous than I&#x201D; [<italic>Mimeni</italic> means both &#x201C;than I&#x201D; and &#x201C;from me]), &#x201C;from Me came forth hidden things.&#x201D; The secret of the kingdom of the House of David is greatly concealed, even from the prophets.</p>

<chapter>
<title>C<small>HANUKA</small></title>
<p>&#x201C;What is Chanuka?&#x201D; (<italic>Shabbat</italic> 21b). It is written (Tehillim, 119: 105), &#x201C;Your word is a candle to my feet, and light for my path.&#x201D; &#x201C;A candle to my feet,&#x201D; meaning that the blessed God bestows the words of Torah in a way that &#x201C;His Kingship in all of His dominion&#x201D; (Tehillim, 103:19) is recognized in each detail of action. &#x201C;A light for my path&#x201D; means that the blessed God illuminates a special recognition also in a general way, for &#x201C;the kingdom is His.&#x201D; (It is written this way) because a candle is something specific, and light something general. The blessed God created the world in general, and divided it into three categories&#x2014;time, place, and person. It is written (Tehillim, 139:16), &#x201C;He fashioned days, and it is in one of them&#x201D; (usually understood that when He created each of the six days of creation He knew everything, every detail, that would ever happen in that day for all time to come).</p>
<p>This means that in these three categories, He chose in particular the choicest element through which to illuminate in a revealed way a specific light and the recognition of His sovereignty, may it be blessed. In the category of place, He created the world in general, where the land of Israel is sanctified above the whole earth. (See Mishna <italic>Kelim</italic>, Ch. 1:6.) Jerusalem sanctified above all the land of Israel, the five-hundred-square cubits of the temple mount sanctified above Jerusalem, and the courtyard and chamber sanctified above them all. In this very place He commanded to light the Menorah in order to illuminate this particular recognition in this specific place. In the category of time He created the six days of creation, in particular the day of Shabbat, and then we also find the commandment to kindle the light of Shabbat. In the category of person He chose specifically the nation of Israel out of all the nations. For now, until the final refinement (<italic>birrur</italic>) in Israel, He chose the tribe of Levi, and among them the Cohanim, and among them the High Priest, and gave him in particular the commandment to light the Menorah.</p>
<p>In the days of the Hasmoneans, the Holy One, blessed be He, shone into them from the illumination of the future, for at that time he merited <italic>Malchut</italic>, kingship. In the same way that it will be revealed by means of Moshiach ben David, when the process of refinement will be completed, and then the chosen tribe will be Yehuda. So then, when the Hasmoneans merited this <italic>Malchut</italic>, the light of the recognition of the chosenness of each individual soul in Israel was greatly increased. Resulting from the miracle that was made with the Menorah, an individual candle (illumination) was established for the chosenness of each individual soul in Israel.</p>
<p>This is as King David said (Tehillim, 87:6), &#x201C;God will count, when He writes down the nations, and for Zion He will say each one born to her.&#x201D; &#x201C;Count, when He writes down the nations,&#x201D; for with the nations, God&#x2019;s Providence is only for the endurance of the species, like other parts of creation. &#x201C;And for Zion He will say each one born to her&#x201D; is that for Israel the Providence of the Holy One, blessed be He, is for each individual soul, each one born to her. The verse continues, &#x201C;and He will establish her at the highest,&#x201D; means that for every one born to Israel, immediately upon birth, there is a recognition that the choicest soul has been born anew, and this is as it is said, &#x201C;a candle for every one.&#x201D; This is the difference of opinion between the house of Shammai and the house of Hillel, meaning just how the final <italic>birrur</italic>, refinement, will be in Israel, and how to light the Chanuka candles, which hint at this. The house of Shammai asserts that we light all eight on the first night, and remove a candle each night, which represents the refinement as destroying the waste, decreasing and continuing until the <italic>Kedusha</italic> (holiness) remains, completely clarified. The house of Hillel asserts that we add and continue, adding a candle each night, for here the principle is to cause the <italic>Kedusha</italic> to spread forth at all times, and from this it follows that the waste will be nullified.</p>
<p>This is also the meaning of the Halacha for the time of lighting the candles &#x201C;from the setting of the sun until the foot [<italic>regel</italic>] finishes from the market,&#x201D; meaning that (with lighting) no force of habit [<italic>hergel</italic>] will be found in any soul in Israel. This is the mitzvah to light it in the doorway of the house from outside, meaning that the candle&#x2014;this recognition discussed above&#x2014;should illuminate every step with intent for the sake of Heaven. And of what is said (<italic>Shabbat</italic>, 21b), &#x201C;until the wood-sellers will leave the market [who would stay after everyone else had left to gather leftover wood],&#x201D; which means, when the final clarification in Israel will be completed.</p>
<p>Concerning this it is explained in the tractate <italic>Yevamot</italic> (17b), &#x201C;they established six thousand archers [who went and raped the daughters of Jerusalem at the time of the destruction],&#x201D; meaning that their seed was mixed into Israel, and this is the principal reason for the lengthening of the exile. When this becomes clarified, then the will of the blessed God will be explicit before us, and this is &#x201C;from the setting of the sun,&#x201D; for the sun hints at the principles of the words of Torah, and in the future these principles will not be necessary; rather the blessed God will cause an effluence of explicit understanding to each one in Israel for each specific action. This is as it is said, &#x201C;a Chanuka candle that is placed above ten cubits is invalid,&#x201D; which is true for a <italic>sukkah</italic> and a <italic>mavoy</italic> (an open street or alley, concerning its width in the laws of Eruvin, symbolic Shabbat boundaries). (So for the three general divisions of existence) the Chanuka candle represents person, <italic>sukkah</italic> represents place, and the <italic>mavoy</italic> (in the laws of Shabbat) represents time, for the choicest of times is Shabbat.</p>

<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> M<small>IQETS</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And it was, at the end of two years &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 41:1)</p>
<p>It is written in the holy Zohar (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 193b), &#x201C;Rebi Elazar opened and said, &#x2018;God lives and blessed is my Rock, God shall elevate my salvation&#x2019;&#x201D; (Tehillim, 18:47). &#x201C;God lives,&#x201D; meaning one who has a pure heart, cleaned from all the desires of the world, and cleaving only to eternal life. &#x201C;And blessed is my Rock&#x201D; means one who recognizes that all good things come only from the blessed God, and therefore has a good eye. Then (it follows that), &#x201C;God shall elevate my salvation,&#x201D; meaning that he will apprehend high salvations, more than his intellect could grasp. For before the man has been clarified in the areas mentioned it is not yet possible to give him salvations, for he is not yet a vessel illuminated for reception. And directed to this it says, &#x201C;and it was, at the end of two years,&#x201D; meaning after these two areas had been clarified, then Pharaoh dreamed his dream, and he (Yosef) immediately apprehended salvation&#x2014;&#x201C;until the time that His word came, the utterance of God refined him&#x201D; (Tehillim, 105:19). For on that very night the cry of Yosef haTsaddik, &#x201C;how long before You return, God?&#x201D; (Psalms, 90:30) reached such great proportions, that he achieved salvation immediately. On this it is said (Tehillim, 88:2), &#x201C;Hashem, God of my salvation &#x2026; I cried out before You at night.&#x201D; Thus are the ways of the Holy One, blessed be He, where before He gives salvation He brings an intense cry to a man&#x2019;s heart so it will be called &#x201C;the work of your hands.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And it was, at the end of two years of days, and Pharaoh dreamed &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 41:1)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Years&#x2014;of days&#x201D; hints that in two days all the good things of the world were created. That is, in the third day (of creation) all the good (we receive from) eating was created, and on the sixth day the form of man was created, meaning the root of life, and the honor of elevation, for man is elevated above all. When man is refined in these two aspects (the root of life and elevation), then salvation will come. This is the meaning of &#x201C;and it was, at the end of two years of days,&#x201D; meaning when there is a complete end to the evil in these two days, then salvation will come at once. This is the meaning of the Midrash at the beginning of the <italic>Parsha</italic> [which reads: &#x201C;He sets an end to the darkness&#x201D; (Job, 28:3]. He gave a time to the world&#x2014;how many years would be made in darkness. And what is the meaning of &#x201C;He sets an end to darkness&#x201D;? For all the while the evil inclination is in the world there is darkness and the shadow of death in the world, as it is written, &#x201C;stones of darkness and the shadow of death&#x201D; (Job, 28:3), meaning the evil inclination will be uprooted from the world; there will be no darkness and shadow of death in the world. Another meaning of &#x201C;He sets an end to darkness&#x201D; is, He allotted to Yosef the twelve years he would be in darkness in the prison, and when the end came, then Pharaoh dreamed his dream. That is, when an end would come to the darkness, which is the end of the evil existing in these two aspects, then salvation will come immediately.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And it was, at the end of two years &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 41:1)</p>
<p>The matter is, that at first Yosef was in prison for ten years, and afterward another two years were added to his time. The first ten were decreed upon him since he had sinned against ten tribes; and then afterward, when he had been refined from this in prison, another two years were added according to himself and Binyamin. For thus is the attribute, when a man sins against the blessed God, then God brings upon him a process of refinement from which he suffers. Then afterward, when he is clarified for the good and makes atonement, then he must suffer from asking himself why he needed to enter himself into a state where he needed such a difficult refinement in the first place. He must necessarily suffer from this, for when a man suffers then the blessed God also suffers, so to speak, for &#x201C;in all their suffering He suffers&#x201D; (Yesahya, 63:9). Therefore after one refines himself corresponding to his sin, in addition to this refinement he must refine himself also concerning his suffering, for this also smacks of sin, as is explained in the Gemara (<italic>Ta&#x2019;anit</italic>, 11a), &#x201C;he sinned in that he disturbed himself.&#x201D; So it goes, that at first, ten years of captivity were decreed upon Yosef corresponding to his ten brothers. Then after he was refined in prison like silver smelted in a crucible, he had to be refined for his own suffering and the suffering of his brother Binyamin. After this was clarified in the two additional years, then he was immediately redeemed.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and behold, he stood on the Nile.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 41:1)</p>
<p>It is written in the Midrash (<italic>Bereshit</italic> Rabba, 89:3), &#x201C;Who exists because of whom? Do I exist because of my god, or does my god exist because of me? He said to him, &#x2018;you exist because of god, as it is said, he stood on the Nile&#x2019; [his god].&#x201D;After he saw his dream, Pharaoh wanted to know that all he desired would succeed. He wanted to know exactly how this would come about. Either his fear and his god were completely with him, and his thoughts were only what his god would send him, then therefore he would succeed; or, it first came to his own thought and will to do something, and then his power and god would help him to succeed. So He said to him, &#x201C;you exist by means of your god,&#x201D; meaning that first the idea would come to you, and then the power that rules over you would be forced to help you. Yet with Israel it is not so, for Israel is a <italic>merkava</italic> (chariot) for the <italic>Shechina</italic> (Divine Presence). They will conduct themselves according to His blessed will, and only in the future when they arrive at the final form of completion, will it be said (Job, 22:28), &#x201C;you shall decree it, and it will be established for you.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Like Avraham Avinu, after the tenth trial, and as Yitschok and Yaakov when they were completed, of them it was said (Yesahya, 58:14), &#x201C;then you shall take delight in God.&#x201D; This is hinted at in the Gemara (<italic>Shabbat</italic>, 69b), &#x201C;one who is going on the way [traveling], and does not know when is Shabbat, Rav Huna says to count six days and then keep one day [of Shabbat], Chaya bar Rav says keep one day and then count six.&#x201D; For the six days of action are the efforts of man, and Shabbat is the assistance of the blessed God. Rav Huna is speaking of a man completed in all ways, whose heart is drawn after the will of the blessed God. Such a man is permitted to exert his own efforts, and then after he can ask the blessed God to complete the matter for him. Yet as long as a man is not in a state of completion, he must accept the yoke of the sovereignty of Heaven before each action, and if the blessed God agrees with him he may act.<sup><xref rid="fn53">36</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Then Pharoah sent and called for Yosef &#x2026; and brought him quickly out of the dungeon.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 41:14)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Brought him quickly out&#x201D; is unusually expressed with the word <italic>Reetsuhu</italic>, meaning that everything that he went through was acceptable, <italic>nirtsah</italic> (using the same letters) to him, because the blessed God sent joy to his heart so he would not bear any anger against Him.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; you can understand a dream to interpret it.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 41:15)</p>
<p>This means that all the matters of this world are like a dream that needs interpretation, and as one interprets it so will it be with him. And for one who understands in everything that all comes only from the blessed God, and only from what comes out of His mouth does man live, this one understands the meaning in everything and arrives at true life. As with bread, where the principal sustaining force exists within it, so it is the issue of God&#x2019;s mouth. He who eats simply like an animal will understand from the bread only the life of this world, and one who understands that what comes out of God&#x2019;s mouth is what gives him life will apprehend everlasting life. For bread, <italic>lechem</italic>, is composed of the same letters as dream, <italic>chalom</italic>, meaning that it needs to be interpreted. So it is with all that we derive benefit from, for all that gives us satisfaction and the good things of the world are compared to bread.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Pharoah called Yosef the name</italic> Tsafnat Pa&#x2019;neach <italic>[solver of hidden things].&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 41:45)</p>
<p>Rashi comments that the word <italic>Pa&#x2019;neach</italic> appears nowhere else in the Scriptures, and it seems as if Pharoah wanted to say, &#x201C;opener,&#x201D; yet he could not bring these letters out of his mouth, namely the letters <italic>vav</italic> and <italic>tav.</italic> This is because the letter <italic>vav</italic> hints at life, and the letter <italic>tav</italic> is the seal of truth of the Holy One, blessed be He. (&#x201C;Truth,&#x201D; <italic>emet</italic>, ends with a <italic>tav</italic>.) The nations of the world have no understanding of these letters, for they have no true life, only as far as the eye sees (on the surface). Therefore he replaced them with the letters <italic>ayin</italic> and <italic>nun</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn54">37</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And may El Shaddai [the Almighty God] give you mercy &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 43:14)</p>
<p>Rashi explains that <italic>Shaddai</italic> means He who said to His world &#x201C;<italic>Dai</italic>&#x0021;&#x201D; &#x201C;Enough&#x0021;&#x201D; The Holy Rav of Pshiska<sup><xref rid="fn55">38</xref></sup> said of the name Shaddai, that when the world was created it would expand and continue, as in the saying in the Gemara (<italic>Chagigah</italic>, 12b), &#x201C;until He said to His world, <italic>Dai</italic>&#x0021;&#x201D; This is because the principle in the creation of the world was that God&#x2019;s blessed greatness may be made known, and therefore he said, &#x201C;Enough,&#x201D; when this could be certified. This is why Yaakov mentioned this particular name here, to show that the blessed God brings suffering upon man to refine him in the recognition of his Creator. Therefore he used this name, as if the blessed God would say, &#x201C;Enough&#x0021;&#x201D; In all that I have gone through I have recognized everything. And truly, our Patriarchs did not say anything from their own initiative; they prayed in the direction of what the blessed God effused to them, and all their prayers were in the proper time and place, for here the blessed God agreed to say &#x201C;enough&#x201D; to all their troubles. This is just as Avraham Avinu asked for mercy from the blessed God after the tenth trial so as not to test him further, for at that time it was in the understanding of the blessed God to no longer test him.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; What can be said to my master, what can be spoken &#x2026; God has found out the sin of your servants &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 44:16)</p>
<p>In the Midrash (<italic>Bereshit</italic> Rabba, 92:9) it says, &#x201C;We know that we did not steal.&#x201D; This means that in this instance we know for certain that we are not flawed in the slightest way. However, only because God caused an event like this to happen upon us, surely there exists within us some similar matter (to make the event suit us). It is because we stole our father&#x2019;s mind with the sale of Yosef that we are falsely accused of such an action.</p>

<chapter>
<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> V<small>AYIGASH</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Yehuda drew close to him.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 44:18)</p>
<p>This is as the writings say (Shmuel 2, 23:3, the last words of King David), &#x201C;The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me [thus], the ruler of man is righteous, ruling in the fear of God.&#x201D; Our sages have explained this in this way (<italic>Moed Katan</italic>, 16b), &#x201C;A <italic>Tsaddik</italic> rules in the fear of God.&#x201D; &#x201C;The God of Israel said&#x201D; means the principles of the words of Torah, and they are the <italic>Rama&#x2019;ch</italic>, 248 positive commandments, and the <italic>Shas&#x2019;ah</italic>, 365 prohibitive commandments, that were given to all of Israel in complete equality. &#x201C;The Rock of Israel spoke to me&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;to me&#x201D; refers to the <italic>ba&#x2019;al tshuva</italic>, the master of return to the law, to whom the blessed God speaks specifically, and gives him vigorous strength after he sinned in thinking that there was no hope from Him.</p>
<p>Then he returns to God, and he is given vigorous strength (<italic>tekifut</italic>). For this reason does the verse formulate itself the way it does, for first it says &#x201C;said,&#x201D; a formulation denoting softness, and with the <italic>ba&#x2019;al tshuva</italic> it says &#x201C;spoke,&#x201D; denoting strength. Also, first the verse says <italic>E-lohei</italic>, and later <italic>Rock</italic>, which is also a term of still greater strength. &#x201C;The ruler of man is righteous&#x201D; means if the sin was a result of the decree of the sages (namely desecration of the <italic>brit</italic>, and the &#x201C;righteous&#x201D; refers to Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai). On this it says &#x201C;the ruler of man is righteous,&#x201D; meaning that the <italic>ba&#x2019;al tshuva</italic> rules over them (these sins), for nothing stands in the way of return. &#x201C;Rules in the fear of God&#x201D; means if the sin was against the written Torah. On this it says &#x201C;rules in the fear of God,&#x201D; meaning that he will also rule over this, and on all of this it is said (<italic>Avoda Zara</italic>, 5a), &#x201C;said the man who was raised up (Shmuel 2, 23:1), means who raised an offering of <italic>tshuva</italic> [return].&#x201D;</p>
<p>For even if words of Torah were delivered with great fear, and several known things threatened by our sages, still, only before the sin occurred was it said that you have nothing that stands against <italic>tshuva</italic>. Yet after one has encountered failure he is not to give up, for in the time to come no sin shall remain in any soul of Israel. The principle of this vigorous strength that we are discussing is in the tribe of Yehuda, so therefore it said, &#x201C;Yehuda drew close to him.&#x201D; Even though it seemed now that he had nothing new to say, yet still we can sense the vigor in his words where he has no doubt that salvation will now emerge.</p>
<p>This is the meaning of the verse (Mishlei, 24:21), &#x201C;Fear God, my son, and rule.&#x201D; &#x201C;My son [<italic>B&#x2019;ni</italic>]&#x201D; meaning wisdom (<italic>Bina</italic>), and this is to say that your fear should be refined and true. &#x201C;And rule&#x201D; means that you shall be a king who is vigorous in his great trust in the blessed God. (And the verse continues), &#x201C;and do not mix with the hateful,&#x201D; meaning as the Gemara says (<italic>Sotah</italic>, 22a), &#x201C;those who teach the law out of their hatefulness,&#x201D; and it is asked of this, &#x201C;is it so simple? It is taught as one who understands it like Rav Huna, who said (that &#x201C;the hateful&#x201D; means) one who transgressed, and then taught that it was permitted to him,&#x201D; meaning that there exists a place even for this, as is explained [in the <italic>Mei HaShiloach</italic> on the verse, &#x201C;you shall have a shovel&#x201D; (<italic>Parshat Ki Teitsei</italic>]. And this was the vigorous strength of Yehuda after what had happened to him, saying, &#x201C;I will be a surety for him [Binyamin],&#x201D; (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 43:9) transgressing what is said (<italic>Yevamot</italic>, 109b), &#x201C;be wary against vouching [leaving a pledge],&#x201D; for nevertheless he was confidant that from this would emerge salvation.<sup><xref rid="fn56">39</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Yehuda drew close to him.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 44:18)</p>
<p>The power that the blessed God instilled in the tribe of Yehuda is that he will never give up, even if he fears certain things will overcome him. We find in the previous <italic>Parsha</italic> that he said, &#x201C;we are my lord&#x2019;s servants,&#x201D; (<italic>Bereshit</italic> 45:16) and it seems as if he began to give up hope, thinking to himself that it was a mistake making himself liable to losing his share in two worlds over Binyamin. In this <italic>Parsha</italic> he strengthens himself greatly before the blessed God by saying, even though I have done improperly, still, it is in the ability of the blessed God to save me. This is, &#x201C;and Yehuda drew close to him,&#x201D; &#x201C;to him&#x201D; meaning to the innermost depths of Yosef&#x2019;s heart, to such an extent that he would be forced to reveal himself to them. For all these verses (at the beginning of the <italic>Parsha</italic>) are a claim against the blessed God, with Yehuda supposing all the while that he was standing before and arguing with a Gentile king. Then when the blessed God sent them the salvation, then they saw that even in retrospect they were never in danger, for truly they were arguing with their brother.</p>
<p>Thus it will be in the future, when the blessed God will save us and redeem us, then God will show us that we were never in exile, and that a foreign nation never ruled over us, only God alone. This is the meaning of the verse (Tehillim, 37:10), &#x201C;and a little more, and there is no evil one, and you considered his place, and there is nothing there,&#x201D; meaning that very soon evil will be banished. &#x201C;And you considered,&#x201D; meaning the understanding of the heart, for if you want to understand its place, &#x201C;there is nothing there,&#x201D; meaning that in it there was no power of governance over you.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;My master asked his servants, do you have a father or a brother &#x2026; and you said to your servants, bring him down &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 44:19&#x2013;21)</p>
<p>Even though there is no retort in this to the theft claimed by Yosef, still truly, these are Yehuda&#x2019;s claims. For truly, one is not punished for the deficiency within him in any matter until it is brought out into action. And here, if there was any deficiency concerning theft within Binyamin, God forbid, it would never have come into the realm of action in this way if he had remained at home, only the &#x201C;accuser of the journey&#x201D; caused it to happen. If so, this action that he is being punished for is not his fault, for the power of his own will would never have had him make the journey to Egypt. And here Yehuda claims this against the blessed God (&#x201C;and You said to Your servants, bring him down&#x201D;), for he believed that even what Yosef said to them, to bring Binyamin, was not without the will of the blessed God.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Israel said, it is enough, Yosef still lives&#x0021; I will go and see him before I die.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 45:28)</p>
<p>It is written in the Gemara (<italic>Berachot</italic>, 5a), &#x201C;Rabi Levi bar Hama said in the name of Rabi Shimon ben Lakish, a man should always have his <italic>yetser tov</italic> [inclination to good] rage [fight against] his <italic>yetser hara</italic> [inclination to evil], as it is said, &#x2018;rage and do not sin&#x2019; (Tehillim, 4:5). If he is victorious, it is well. If not, he shall engage in Torah, as it is said, &#x2018;say to your hearts.&#x2019; [Ibid.] If he is victorious, it is well. If not, he should recite the <italic>Shema</italic>, as it says, &#x2018;on your beds.&#x2019; [Ibid.] If he is victorious, it is well. If not, he should be reminded of the day of his death, as it is said, &#x2018;and be silent, <italic>selah</italic>.&#x2019;&#x201D; Rabi Levi bar Hama said specifically, &#x201C;a man should always rage,&#x201D; for &#x201C;always&#x201D; means all the matters that overcome a person. Even matters of an exulted level (<italic>gadlut</italic>) must always be distinguished and clarified if they are from the blessed God, or if, God forbid, there exists in them even a trace of dross from a different source. Especially when a man comes to a state of rejoicing he needs even more clarification. Therefore four levels of advice to man are given in this Gemara as to how to distinguish the nature of these matters and come to true depth. Afterward, when he knows for certain that the matter comes from God he may extend himself and still know that it is a mitzvah or the rejoicing of a mitzvah. So when any matter of this world befalls man that needs clarification, we have these four clarifications advised in the Gemara.</p>
<p>The first clarification is, &#x201C;one should always have his <italic>yetser tov</italic> rage over his <italic>yetser hara</italic>.&#x201D; This means that he must discontinue his (destructive) lusts by taking to his heart that he will not have these lusts forever, for (reflecting on) the span of man&#x2019;s &#x201C;seventy years&#x201D; (he may say to himself), &#x201C;of what good is it to me if it does not last forever?&#x201D; &#x201C;If he is victorious, it is well, and if not, he should engage in Torah.&#x201D; For when he sets his mind to the impermanence of this desire, and still he longs for it, it seems that the lust still somewhat exists, so he must then go through another clarification. This is to engage in Torah, for the words of Torah advise man as to how to save himself from desire. However, &#x201C;at the time of the <italic>yetser hara</italic>, no one remembers the <italic>yetser tov</italic>,&#x201D; (<italic>Nedarim</italic>, 32b), so in response to this the Holy One, blessed be He, created the <italic>Torah Tavleen</italic>, the law of spicing or flavoring.</p>
<p>For truly, a man immersed in desire and unable to extricate himself from it has no advice to remind him that he is doing something forbidden, for the prohibition does not have enough power to separate the man from the evil at the time of the <italic>yetser hara</italic>. Then the advice given to man is to remember that he can find the same good in the words of Torah, and it is only different in that it is in a state of <italic>Kedusha</italic> (sanctity). This is explained (in the <italic>Mei HaShiloach</italic>, Tehillim) on the verse, &#x201C;the sea saw and fled,&#x201D; and as it says there, that he saw that the blessed God could transform a rock into a lake of water and dry flint to a flowing spring.</p>
<p>One would think that it would be formulated in the opposite way, for at this time the <italic>Gevurot</italic> strengths of the blessed God, were seen in the world, that He could destroy and dry up the ocean. However, water hints at desire, and at a time when desire overpowers the only advice against it is to show how this exists also in a state of <italic>Kedusha</italic>, and then it will cease.<sup><xref rid="fn57">40</xref></sup> This is the advice to engage in Torah. &#x201C;If he is victorious, it is well. If not, he should recite the <italic>Shema</italic>.&#x201D; For exulted states are found in the words of Torah, and by means of the words of Torah one may dare to become arrogant, and then he will not be able to come to true refinement. For this, the advice is to recite the <italic>Shema</italic>. The matter of reciting the <italic>Shema</italic> is explained in the Gemara (<italic>Ta&#x2019;anit</italic>, 31a). &#x201C;In the future the Holy One, blessed be He, will make a circle dance of the <italic>Tsaddikim</italic> [righteous].&#x201D;</p>
<p>This means that all will see that all is in the hands of the blessed God, and no one has any superiority or exulted state over his peers. Specifically a &#x201C;circle dance,&#x201D; because the nature of a circle is that it has no end, and this hints at the matter of reading the <italic>Shema</italic>. &#x201C;If he is victorious, it is well. If not, he should be reminded of the day of his death.&#x201D; This means that he should visualize before him as if right now is the day of his death. This is the difference between the first advice, &#x201C;he shall rage,&#x201D; explained in a similar way, yet remind him of the day of his death, i.e., visualize as if now is the time of his death; and if so, the lusts and the unwarranted rejoicing have no place. And if after all this the lusts and rejoicing still remain in his heart, then it is proof that it comes from God and endures forever.</p>
<p>So it was with Yaakov Avinu at the time when he heard the news that Yosef is still alive, as it is said, &#x201C;and Yaakov&#x2019;s spirit was revived.&#x201D; At this moment he feared that perhaps his rejoicing was only the rejoicing of this world, therefore he tested and refined himself with these clarifications. The first clarification was when he said, &#x201C;I will go and see him before I die,&#x201D; and this corresponds to &#x201C;a man should always rage,&#x201D; as was explained. The second was, &#x201C;and he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Yitschok,&#x201D; which corresponds to &#x201C;engage in Torah,&#x201D; as we bless each day &#x201C;who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to engage in the words of Torah.&#x201D; For when the Holy One, blessed be He, gave the Torah He was called, &#x201C;<italic>Gevurah</italic>,&#x201D; power, for there it is said that Moshe heard from the mouth of <italic>Gevurah</italic> (<italic>Megillah</italic>, 31b), as is known to the understanding. And there God said to Yaakov, &#x201C;and I [<italic>Anochi</italic>] will surely bring you up again,&#x201D; which corresponds to the fist saying in the Decalogue, &#x201C;I [<italic>Anochi</italic>] am Hashem your God, who brought you out.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Only here it is phrased in the past, and in our <italic>Parsha</italic> it is phrased in the future. Furthermore, what is said, &#x201C;and he sent Yehuda before him&#x201D; (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 46:28), is explained by our sages (Midrash Tanchuma, <italic>Vayigash</italic> 11) that it was &#x201C;to establish a house of study for him,&#x201D; which is also related to this matter.</p>
<p>Afterward he clarified the third clarification with &#x201C;and he wept on his shoulder,&#x201D; and our sages interpreted this to mean that he recited the <italic>Shema</italic>. Then after, he said to Yosef, &#x201C;now let me die,&#x201D; which corresponds to the fourth advice, to remind him of the day of his death. When Yaakov saw that after all of this his joy was still with him, then he understood that it was from God, and that his rejoicing was true and would last forever.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Yitschok.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 46:1)</p>
<p>Why was the blessed God called here &#x201C;the God of his father Yitschok&#x201D;? Because Yaakov prayed in the direction of the words that were said to Yitschok (from God) (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 26:3), &#x201C;live in this land [and do not leave the boundaries of Israel], and I will be with you.&#x201D; So Yaakov then feared that perhaps it was also forbidden for him to leave. Therefore he prayed to the blessed God until He illuminated his eyes to show him that for him it was permitted to leave.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And he sent Yehuda before him.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 46:28)</p>
<p>It is written in the Midrash (Tanchuma, <italic>Vayigash</italic>, 6), &#x201C;[God said,] be careful of the <italic>mitzvot</italic>, for they are my messenger, and one&#x2019;s messenger is like he who sends him.&#x201D; Yosef was on the level of fulfillment of the <italic>mitzvot</italic>, and Yehuda was on the level of the blessings of the <italic>mitzvot</italic>. With all <italic>mitzvot</italic>, we bless them before they are done, and this is why &#x201C;he sent Yehuda before him.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Israel lived in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 47:27)</p>
<p>Yaakov Avinu feared going outside of Israel, as it is said (<italic>Ketubot</italic>, 110b), &#x201C;all who live inside of Israel, he is as one who has God, and all who live outside of Israel, he is as one who does not have God.&#x201D; Therefore, the blessed God said to him, &#x201C;everywhere you are is sanctified with the <italic>Kedusha</italic> of the land of Israel.&#x201D; This is the meaning of &#x201C;and Israel lived in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen,&#x201D; for even in the land of Egypt you will be close to the blessed God, and it will be a holy place, for &#x201C;Goshen&#x201D; is a term signifying closeness.<sup><xref rid="fn58">41</xref></sup></p>

<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Yaakov lived &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 47:28)</p>
<p>It is written in the tractate <italic>Avot</italic> (Ch. 3, Mishna 17), &#x201C;if there is no understanding [<italic>Binah</italic>], then there is no knowledge [<italic>Da&#x2019;at</italic>].&#x201D; &#x201C;Understanding&#x201D; means the principles of the words of Torah, meaning the reasons for things, as in the phrase often found, &#x201C;this is the principle,&#x201D; and by means of this principle man may know several details. &#x201C;Knowledge&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn59">42</xref></sup> is the details. This is the meaning of &#x201C;if there is no understanding then there is no knowledge,&#x201D; for if a man does not know the general principle that is the reason for the matter, then he cannot understand the detail, for from one detail is known the next detail. The converse is also true, for if there is no knowledge then there is no understanding. For if one can say that he knows a principle, but does not need to know its resulting details, on this it says, &#x201C;if there is no knowledge.&#x201D; Meaning, if the details are not organized for you, then you will not be able to know the root of the principle in its truth, and then how will you be able to branch out from there? This is the meaning of &#x201C;and he lived,&#x201D; meaning the root of life, which is the principle of everything; and &#x201C;Yaakov&#x201D; means knowledge [<italic>Da&#x2019;at</italic>] which is the detail, for <italic>Yaakov</italic> represents <italic>Zeir Anpin</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn60">43</xref></sup> In other words, (<italic>Yaakov</italic> is) how the blessed God watches, or rather, is intimately involved, in every detail necessary for every matter, even the smallest of the small.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; guiding his hands intentionally [Yaakov moving his right hand over his left to place it on Efriam for the blessing] &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 48:14)</p>
<p>Since the attribute of Yitschok Avinu was that of <italic>Gevurah</italic> (strength), so therefore he wanted to bless Eisav, because the attribute of <italic>Gevurah</italic> teaches of the words of Torah, as it is written (<italic>Megillah</italic> 31b), &#x201C;[at Sinai] Moshe heard from the mouth of <italic>Gevurah</italic>.&#x201D; Therefore it says, &#x201C;let the judgment [<italic>Din, Gevurah</italic>] cut through the mountain [meaning to follow the judgment under all circumstances].&#x201D; This is why it was not in Yitschok&#x2019;s power to go against the judgment, and he wanted to give the blessing to Eisav since he was the elder son. Yet since the blessed God supports the pure of hand, for the hands are branches of the heart, and his heart was pure and refined; then the result was that Yaakov would bless without (or independent of) his own knowledge. Therefore it is written (Tehillim, 16:5), &#x201C;You support my fate,&#x201D; yet Yaakov Avinu always looked toward the understanding and the will of the blessed God. Therefore he said, &#x201C;I knew, my son, I knew,&#x201D; &#x201C;guiding his hands intentionally,&#x201D; placing Efriam before Menashe.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; the God before whom my fathers walked &#x2026; who guided me all my life &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 48:15)</p>
<p>Meaning that Yaakov Avinu made himself small before his fathers, Avraham and Yitschok. He said that their wisdom and understanding was so great that they could by themselves cause an expansion of the will of the blessed God. Even if the blessed God created for them a small opening, in their wisdom they would expand and extend it in order to do the will of their Creator, and would understand even what the blessed God had not explicitly illuminated to them. This is the meaning of &#x201C;before whom my fathers walked,&#x201D; meaning that they went by means of their own power. But me, &#x201C;E-lohim who guided me all my life until this day,&#x201D; meaning that for every action I do, no matter how small, I need the blessed God to illuminate His will into me. I even need it with this action (blessing Menashe and Efriam), where I saw how it is His will to change it (to bless the younger before the older), nevertheless I need to see even the second time how it is His blessed will. Truly in this matter Yaakov was the greatest of the Patriarchs, for to have the blessed God constantly lead one&#x2019;s actions is a great level. This was the prayer of King David (Tehillim, 23:1), &#x201C;God is my shepherd, I will lack nothing,&#x201D; meaning that the Providence of the blessed God will not be lacking from me, for He will always guide me, and I will be ever aware that the blessed God is guiding me. For in His goodness He conducts everything; only man turns his face away, not wanting to behold and pray. Yet at a time when a man prays a complete prayer he is answered immediately, and he will see that God is the Shepherd. This is the meaning of &#x201C;I shall not lack,&#x201D; meaning that he will not turn his face from Him.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Yaakov called to his sons &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 49:1)</p>
<p>It is written on this in the Midrash (Tanchuma, <italic>Vayechi</italic>, 8), &#x201C;I shall call to the supernal E-lohim, to the God who does all for me&#x201D; (Tehillim, 57:3). Now that Yaakov Avinu wanted to bless his sons, he was unsure as to whether he needed to bless them after the anguish they caused him with the sale of Yosef, and, &#x201C;any <italic>talmid chocham</italic> [Torah scholar] who is not vengeful and grudge-bearing like a serpent is not a <italic>talmid chocham</italic>&#x201D; (<italic>Yoma</italic>, 22b). Therefore it says, &#x201C;and he called,&#x201D; which is an expression of crying out and longing of the heart, for he gave over his eyes and heart to the heights (to God) and let himself say whatever God put in his mouth. This is why the Midrash mentions this verse, for he asked God to complete the action for him. The word &#x201C;blessing&#x201D; is not used first (it does not say &#x201C;he called his sons to bless them&#x201D;) for it was still not yet clear to him what he was going to say to them. However, with Moshe Rabeynu, he began immediately by saying &#x201C;this is the blessing,&#x201D; since it was immediately clear to him what he was going to say when he began to speak.</p>
<p>With Yaakov, it only says &#x201C;he blessed them&#x201D; after he finished speaking (in verse 28), for only after he finished speaking, and not before, was it clear to him that all his blessings were from the blessed God. At first, God placed words of rebuke in his mouth, to chide the first three tribes, for &#x201C;a <italic>talmid chocham</italic> must be vengeful and grudge-bearing.&#x201D; Then when he arrived at the tribe of Yehuda, God showed him from Heaven that he needed to be forgiving, for in the letters of &#x201C;Yehuda&#x201D; are the four letters of God&#x2019;s blessed name, YHVH. These four letters in his name hint at the verse (Yesahya, 66:2), &#x201C;I will look to this one, to the poor and contrite of spirit, and he will tremble at my word.&#x201D; This means that there was nothing from Yehuda&#x2019;s own initiative (he was an instrument of God), as it says (Zohar, <italic>Bereshit</italic>, 244b), &#x201C;the <italic>dalet</italic> gathers up.&#x201D; (Meaning that the <italic>dalet</italic> in Yehuda&#x2019;s name [signifying <italic>Malchut</italic>, reception] would gather up whatever God&#x2019;s name would give him.) Therefore there was no room to bear any anger against him, so when Yaakov began to bless Yehuda with the attribute of compassion, this attribute took over with the rest of the tribes and they were all included in his blessing.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and in the blood of grapes his garment.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 49:11)</p>
<p>The word used for garment, &#x201C;<italic>sutah</italic>&#x201D; (on which Rashi notes is the only such usage in all of Scripture) is an expression meaning incitement (&#x201C;<italic>hasatah</italic>&#x201D;). The incitement, or accusation against the root of the soul of Yehuda, which came about after the sin and failure that he had encountered, caused strength to wake in his heart, saying, &#x201C;this is only because the blessed God desires to save me with greater strength.&#x201D; For &#x201C;grapes&#x201D; means mistakes and forgetting. Moshe Rabeynu had said (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 32:14), &#x201C;and of the blood of the grape you drank foaming wine,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn61">44</xref></sup> which teaches of &#x201C;no eye has seen a god besides You &#x2026;&#x201D; (Yesahya, 64:4). The ministering angels do not understand Aramaic.<sup><xref rid="fn62">45</xref></sup> Moshe represents the inner aspect, and Yaakov the outer aspects.<sup><xref rid="fn63">46</xref></sup> With Yaakov it was said &#x201C;grapes,&#x201D; meaning that the blessed God will clarify the two mistakes of the tribe of Yehuda, which are the inclination to forbidden sexual relations and the inclination to idolatry. The blessed God will make it clear that they are clean in both aspects. Moshe Rabeynu, who represents the inner aspects, saw that there was no fault in Yehuda concerning the inclination to idolatry, yet the inclination to promiscuity still needed to be disencumbered, as Rav said (<italic>Sanhedrin</italic>, 63b), &#x201C;Israel only worshipped the golden calf in order to permit promiscuity in public.&#x201D; Yet they were already clean concerning idolatry. Understand this.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Binyamin is a wolf that tears, in the morning he will devour, at night he will divide his spoil.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 49:27)</p>
<p>For Binyamin gathers all the good scattered among the nations and enters it into Israel.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Gad, a troop shall troop upon him, but he shall troop upon their heel.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 49:19)</p>
<p>The Holy One, blessed be He, gave the twelve tribes of Yah (God) light and life, and no one is like another. Therefore they are called &#x201C;diagonal borders,&#x201D; meaning that the light of this one is the opposite of this one, for this one draws its life force from the attribute of love, and this one from the attribute of fear, and the like. Concerning this we find that each side in every disagreement in the Gemara really goes to the same place in order to fulfill the will of the blessed God. We find an example of this in the Gemara (<italic>Pesachim</italic>, 53b), &#x201C;whether they say to light [in one&#x2019;s home on Yom Kippur] or whether they say not to light, they both intend the same thing.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn64">47</xref></sup> So it is with all differing opinions, for their source is really one. Therefore the word for tribe, <italic>shevet</italic>, comes from the word for branch, for they are all branches coming out of the same place (consider twelve lines in different directions all coming out of a single point).</p>
<p>We find that the blessed God singled out the tribe of Gad for suffering. The branch (tribe) of Gad said that without suffering and tribulation the words of Torah may not enter into the heart of man, and it is the way of the world that one who suffers obviously has little joy and does not enjoy so much company with his fellow man. Therefore Gad was blessed that they should have joy and company, blessing them to be connected and containing many troops of friends. This is why the only tribe whose number includes both thousands, hundreds, and tens is Gad.<sup><xref rid="fn65">48</xref></sup> &#x201C;But he shall troop upon their heel,&#x201D; meaning that at the time when it will be necessary to gather all of Israel together, then Gad will be the one to bind and connect them.<sup><xref rid="fn66">49</xref></sup> Out of him shall come all kinds of joy to Israel, for Eliyahu comes from the tribe of Gad (<italic>Bereshit</italic> Rabba, 71:12).<sup><xref rid="fn67">50</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Naftali is a hind let loose, he gives words of beauty.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 49:21)</p>
<p>Meaning that within Naftali is a great understanding to ask concerning all the matters of this world, &#x201C;who created these?&#x201D; This is the meaning of &#x201C;he gives words of beauty,&#x201D; that since he recognizes the presence of the blessed God in everything, he would give thanks for it. This is why Onkeles translates, &#x201C;he gives thanks and blesses over them.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; he gathered up his feet into the bed &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 49:33)</p>
<p>It is written in the Gemara (<italic>Ta&#x2019;anit</italic>, 5b), &#x201C;Yaakov Avinu did not die.&#x201D; Death is the change of man from this world to the world to come. With Yaakov, all the while he was in Egypt, the blessed God let him taste a little of the life of the world to come, therefore it says that he did not die, for he did not experience any change with his death. On this, the Gemara follows immediately with, &#x201C;all who so much as say the name, &#x2018;<italic>Rachav, Rachav</italic>&#x2019; [the most beautiful prostitute of her time] will experience a seminal flow.&#x201D; The Gemara concludes that &#x201C;this was true for those who knew her and had seen her.&#x201D; These two matters were juxtaposed in the Gemara in order to show that just as with the affairs of this world desire remains fixed in the heart of man, so too was the drop of life (from the world to come) fixed in the heart of Yaakov Avinu from the time the blessed God dripped it into him and forevermore. Therefore it is inconceivable that the expression death would have any relevance to Yaakov Avinu any more than one who removes his garments and dresses in other garments. This is the meaning of the verse (Yesahya, 58:8), &#x201C;then your light shall break forth as the morning,&#x201D; for &#x201C;break forth&#x201D; &#x201C;is comprised of the same letters as Yaakov&#x201D; and also &#x201C;fixed.&#x201D; Understand this.<sup><xref rid="fn68">51</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;You thought evil of me, but E-lohim thought it for good &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 50:20)</p>
<p>With this matter, the blessed God showed it was possible to bring the tribes into the exile of Egypt, and the main point of this was the separation they began to experience, for at a time when Israel is unified, then nothing can rule over them. This began when Yosef was separated from the tribes, for while Yaakov Avinu was still among them it could not be discerned who was the greatest of the tribes, for sometimes he would bring this one closer, and sometimes this one closer, just whichever was fitting in his eyes to bring close at that time. Yet before his passing, at the time when he blessed them, he said to Yehuda, &#x201C;the sons of your father will bow down before you,&#x201D; and all recognized that Yehuda was dominant over his brothers. Because of this Yosef did not know how to conduct himself, whether to seat Yehuda at the head, for was he not the king, and it was forbidden to disrespect the king? Or should he seat himself at the head, for did he not know himself that Yehuda was the head and would therefore sit in a category unto himself, and not with the tribes? The tribes judged him that he did this out of hatred, and therefore they were punished to go into exile, for they should have judged him favorably.</p>
<p>Also with Yosef, his response was counted as a sin, since he left room for them to be mistaken about him. Truly he should have acted by seating himself at the head since at this time he was king, yet he was to know in his heart that Yehuda was greater than he was. And truly, that his brothers were mistaken about him might seem like a small mistake in the eyes of man (yet it had tremendous results). Therefore one must always pray before the blessed God that it should never enter his mind to judge another as guilty, and also that his fellow man should not judge him as guilty, and therefore the tribes were punished, in that they were supposed to judge him favorably.</p>

This is reminiscent of a line from the poet William Carlos Williams, &#x201C;Man has hitherto survived because he has been unable to realize his desires. Now that he can realize them, he must change them, or perish.&#x201D; It could be understood in reference to the principle of kabbalah that from the physical world we may learn of the attributes of the Divine. Therefore, if such a spirit arose in man that he must limit his desires, so it must have arose with the Omnipotent to refrain from destroying and re-creating the imperfect creation, for as our sages said, &#x201C;G-d would create and destroy worlds until He created this one.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn36">19. Meaning, when Yishmael is in the presence of Israel, he dwells in the presence, <italic>Shechina</italic>, of God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn37">20.

This is because Israel is a veritable portion of the blessed God, and the wisdom of the Gentiles is the wisdom of nature and not connected to <italic>Kedusha</italic> [holiness]. For the wisdom of Israel and their conduct is according to the Torah of God. <italic>Tashlum Mei HaShiloach</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn40">23. For a man must cleave to the attributes of the blessed God, and this is a sign among His Hosts, that they will not apprehend Him, but he will be exulted over all. Similarly the souls of Israel must distinguish themselves from the idolaters, as we find written in the Gemara (<italic>Nedarim</italic>, 65a), &#x201C;Tsidkiyahu found Nebuchadnetsar eating a live rabbit. &#x2018;Swear to me not to reveal this, that the matter not be found out.&#x2019; He swore, and later regretted it, had his vow annulled, and told of it. Nebuchadnetsar heard that they were deriding him, so he had Tsidkiyahu and the Sanhedrin brought before him. He said to them, &#x2018;have you seen what Tsidkiyahu has done? Did he not swear on the name of Heaven that he would not reveal it?&#x2019; They answered him, &#x2018;He was released of his oath.&#x2019; &#x2018;Can one be released of an oath?&#x2019; he asked. &#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; they answered. &#x2018;In his presence or even not in his presence?&#x2019; &#x2018;Actually in his presence,&#x2019; was their reply. &#x2018;What did you decide?&#x2019; he asked them, &#x2018;why didn&#x2019;t you say this to Tsidkiyahu (that he could only annul his vow before me)?&#x2019; Immediately, &#x2018;The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, and keep silence&#x2019; [Eicha, 2:10]. Rabbi Yitschok said, &#x2018;This teaches that they removed the cushions from under them [to show that they had erred in a matter of law].&#x2019; &#x201C;This is the matter here, for after they saw that Yitschok was greatly successful, they thought that it may be because he has a certain way of conduct before the Holy One, blessed be He. This is as we found in the Gemara (<italic>Sanhedrin</italic>, 96a), &#x201C;&#x2018;There is such a great man,&#x2019; he exclaimed, &#x2018;and shall I not send him a greeting? Write to him: &#x201C;Peace to King Hizkiah, peace to the city of Jerusalem, and peace to the great God&#x0021;&#x2019;&#x201D; Now Nebuchadnetsar was Baladan&#x2019;s scribe, but just then he was not present. When he came, he asked them, &#x2018;How did you write?&#x2019; And they told him, &#x2018;We wrote it this way.&#x2019; &#x2018;You called him the great God,&#x2019; he said, &#x2018;but you mentioned him last&#x0021; Thus,&#x2019; said he, &#x2018;you should have written: &#x201C;peace to the great God, peace to the city of Jerusalem, and peace to King Hizkiah.&#x201D; So the Sanhedrin had become depressed, and he was forced to reveal to them that he had eaten a live rabbit. &#x201C;Rabbit&#x201D; teaches of brazenness, as is explained in the <italic>Mei Hashiloach, Parshat Shmini</italic>, and since he ate such an animal alive it was a sign that he had in his roots such brazenness against heaven. All of this is only on the surface; therefore he permitted himself to break his vow seeing as they were greatly depressed that perhaps a single idolater could be compared to Israel. <italic>Giliyon Mei HaShiloach</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn41">24. Meaning seven or satisfied; both make sense here.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn42">25. And to constrict himself in his eating. Therefore the blessed God said to him, &#x201C;sit in your house and wait expectantly until I find you a reason to earn a living. In the realm of the <italic>brit hamaor</italic> (his sexual activity), he was greatly constrained; therefore he needed no restrictions concerning this, as it is said (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 26:8), &#x201C;and Yitschok was sporting with his wife Rivka.&#x201D; Avraham Avinu, however, was constricted in his eating, therefore it was permitted for him to look for reasons to earn a livelihood. Thus it is with all the souls of Israel, whoever knows where he is constricted in the composition of his soul, it is permitted for him to travel from his place and go after his own reasons. Indeed whosoever knows where his heart is afflicted and in this could experience expansion, God forbid, he must wait for the blessed God&#x2019;s salvation, when He shall invite him to go out from his place and his house. <italic>Tashlum Mei HaShiloach</italic>.</ftnote>

Third, there is an empty space in the middle of the verse as written in the Torah, between &#x201C;and Yisroel heard&#x201D; and &#x201C;the son&#x2019;s of Jacob were twelve,&#x201D; for this is the landscape of silence through which the secrets of the Torah are transmitted.

<ftnote id="fn53">36. The matter in this is that Pharoah asked to investigate if he had to boundary himself within Divine service, or if he was allowed to extend himself into anything his heart desired. However, unknown to him, he had to act according to the will of the blessed God since he was a creation of God. Then the blessed God showed him that truly He does not desire his service, for there is no completeness in the service of idolaters, nor is there any completeness in their fear, as it is written (Yesahya 44:16), &#x201C;he burns half of it in fire, the other half he eats.&#x201D; Even the most precious intentions with which they serve can afterward be entered into physical desires, as explained on the matter of the <italic>migdal</italic>, the tower (<italic>Menachot</italic>, 110a), &#x201C;they call Him the God of god.&#x201D; (Though the name of God is renowned through the nations, they do not fear Him. Rabeynu Gershon.) Yet God desires the service of Israel because they are serving only God alone. This is called complete, for it is not effected from anything (only God), as it says in the Midrash (Tanchuma <italic>Shmini</italic> 8), &#x201C;what does God care whether the animal is ritually slaughtered and eaten, or stabbed and eaten.&#x201D; For with the service of Israel, corresponding to how much they suspend their (vain) desires does He want to effuse energy to them. This is as He showed him (in the above Gemara) that at the present moment He does not want their service, and at a time that will become clear, then &#x201C;the rider [as well as the horse]will fall.&#x201D; For even the supernal angels of the nations are not in a state of completeness, and therefore &#x201C;the horse and the rider fell into the sea&#x201D; (song at the splitting of the Red Sea). With Israel, the blessed God will entreat them because of their service. Giliyon Mei HaShiloach of Gershon Cheinoch of Radzin ZY&#x201D;A, grandson of the Isbitser.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn54">37. Pharoah did not speak the holy tongue, Hebrew, anyhow, and had no understanding of these letters. Therefore the word &#x201C;open,&#x201D; <italic>poteach</italic>, does not appear in the Torah (with a <italic>Vav</italic>, at least in the five books of Moses). The principal (spiritual) root of the word <italic>poteach</italic> is <italic>Vav</italic> and <italic>Tav</italic>, which opens the concealed. He could not say the <italic>dalet</italic> in the letter <italic>Tav</italic>, for the visual shape of a <italic>Tav</italic> is a <italic>Dalet</italic> joined to a <italic>Nun</italic>, with the <italic>Nun</italic> representing property and apprehension, and the <italic>Dalet</italic> representing that we can effect nothing (without God, for <italic>d&#x2019;leit</italic> is &#x201C;not&#x201D; in Aramaic). This is not in the ability of idolaters to understand, for according to them they have power, and thus <italic>Ayin</italic> (one of Pharoah&#x2019;s substitute letters) hints at the dealings of this world, the opposite of the <italic>Vav.

<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> S<small>HEMOT</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And these are the names &#x2026; And it was, because the midwives feared God, that He made them houses.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 1:1,21)</p>
<p>It is the nature of human fear that when one experiences it his mind is unsettled, for fear is the opposite of a settled mind. However, with the fear of God, one experiences confidence and comfort. &#x201C;And He made them houses,&#x201D; teaches of this, for &#x201C;houses&#x201D; teaches of an organized, settled mind; and then it follows that when they had a settled mind from the fear of E-lohim they had no fear from the decree of Pharaoh. This is &#x201C;and He made them houses.&#x201D; This is the explanation of the verse (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 49:13), &#x201C;Zevulun shall dwell on the ocean shore, and he shall be a shore for ships,&#x201D; for &#x201C;ocean&#x201D; teaches of fear and &#x201C;ship&#x201D; teaches of a settled mind. As it is said in the Gemara (<italic>Bava Metsia</italic>, 9b), &#x201C;a ship is at rest.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Moshe said, who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel?&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 3:11)</p>
<p>Meaning that he asked two questions. One, &#x201C;who am I&#x201D;; in other words, he asked the blessed God to illuminate into him what made him more fit to be the redeemer more than anyone else in Israel. Two, &#x201C;that I should bring out&#x201D;; meaning, it is true that they are being subjugated to harsh slavery and they deserve to be redeemed, but nevertheless, what will be with them when they are brought out? That is, surely the intention of the blessed God is not just to improve their life in this world.<sup><xref rid="fn69">1</xref></sup> Concerning this the blessed God answered him, to the question, &#x201C;who am I?&#x201D; He answered him, &#x201C;for I will be with you,&#x201D; meaning that it is because I know that you do not turn to anything from your own accord, but only from what I send to you. The very name Moshe teaches of this, &#x201C;for from the water was he drawn [<italic>meshitihu</italic>],&#x201D; meaning that all the desires and personal interests were &#x201C;drawn&#x201D; out of him,<sup><xref rid="fn70">2</xref></sup> and he felt no arrogance in that the Divine presence spoke directly to him.<sup><xref rid="fn71">3</xref></sup> Concerning the question, &#x201C;that I should bring out,&#x201D; the intention of the blessed God is surely not for benefit in this world. This being so, He answered him, &#x201C;when I shall bring you out &#x2026; You shall serve E-lohim &#x2026; &#x201D; meaning that I shall place you under the yokes of servitude to the Torah, and My dealings with you shall concern things that live and endure for all of eternity. On this He said, &#x201C;and this shall be your sign, that I [<italic>Anochi</italic>] sent you,&#x201D; and He did not formulate it by saying, &#x201C;that I [<italic>Ani</italic>] sent you,&#x201D; for the additional letter, <italic>Caf</italic> in <italic>Anochi</italic>, teaches of something that lasts for all eternity, as is known.<sup><xref rid="fn72">4</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Go then and gather the elders of Israel &#x2026; but behold, they will not believe me &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 3:16&#x2013;4:1)</p>
<p>Moshe actually trusted that they would believe him, for if the blessed God sent him surely he would succeed. Yet still, he said that it is not befitting that the messenger sent from the blessed God should not posses the power to coerce them into listening to him, yet should rather have to plead with them. &#x201C;And God said to him, what is that in your hand? And he said, a staff. And He said, cast it to the ground, and he cast it to the ground, and it became a snake &#x2026;&#x201D; (<italic>Shemot</italic>, 4:2&#x2013;3). &#x201C;Staff&#x201D; hints at the source of life, as it is written in the Gemara (<italic>Pesachim</italic>, 68a), &#x201C;In the future the <italic>Tsaddikim</italic> shall raise the dead, as it is written, each man, his staff in his hand.&#x201D; &#x201C;And he cast it to the ground, and it became a snake,&#x201D; meaning that He showed him that these things did not come out of the source of life, but were rather a surface appearance that seemed like life. At the source they are nothing, for &#x201C;snake&#x201D; hints at this. You must understand, are not the hearts of Israel in My hands, to coerce them to My will? And if I sent you, then you must believe that I will also send into their hearts the inclination to adhere to you. &#x201C;And Moshe fled from its presence&#x201D; means that he understood his mistake. &#x201C;And He said, put forth your hand and grasp it at its tail,&#x201D; meaning, investigate deeply into this very matter, how it occurred to you that they might not believe you, for is this not in itself also the will of the blessed God? In this He showed him that there was a reason for his insecurities, for it entered his mind that there would be times when they would fail to believe in Moshe, as in Korach&#x2019;s controversy. These three wonders hint at the three failures that were to come about in Israel.</p>
<p>The staff corresponds to the complaints murmured in <italic>Parshat Chukat</italic> (<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 21:5), &#x201C;and the people spoke against God and against Moshe &#x2026; our soul despises this cheap bread &#x2026; and God sent snakes among the people.&#x201D; For this the fixing was &#x201C;and all who are bitten shall glance at the brass serpent, and live.&#x201D; Therefore (since there was a fixing), here too the snake turned back into a staff. The second wonder, &#x201C;place your hand on your chest [and it became leprous],&#x201D; corresponds to Miriam and Aaron speaking against Moshe, and since here too there was a fixing (the healing of Miriam&#x2019;s leprosy), Moshe returned from his leprosy to his normal state. The third wonder, &#x201C;take some water from the Nile, and it became blood,&#x201D; corresponds to the &#x201C;waters of strife [When the people complained for water, so Moshe lost control and hit the rock].&#x201D; Since it is clear to all that this was not fixed (and Moshe never could enter the land), therefore we do not find that the blood was turned back into water.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And he went, and they met at the mountain of E-lohim, and he kissed him.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 4:27)</p>
<p>In the Midrash (<italic>Bereshit</italic> Rabba, 8:5), &#x201C;Loving-kindness [<italic>Hesed</italic>] and Truth have met, Righteousness [<italic>Tsedek</italic>] and Peace kissed (Tehillim, 85:11). Hesed is Aaron, Truth is Moshe, Tsedek is Moshe, Peace is Aharon.&#x201D; It is also written in the Midrash (Tanchuma <italic>Shemot</italic>, 28), &#x201C;With the creation of the world, the Holy One, blessed be He, asked the opinion of Hesed. Hesed said, create it, for the world is filled with Loving-kindness. Truth said, do not create it, for the world is filled with lies. Tsedek said, create it, for the world is filled with righteousness. Peace said do not create it, for the world is filled with quarrels. What did he do? The Holy One, blessed be He, sent Truth earthward and created the world.&#x201D; The famous dilemma is: What did He do with Peace? Do we not find that He also sent Peace earthward? Also, if Moshe was Truth and Tsedek, then on one side he said, create it, and on the other side he said, do not create it. The matter is, &#x201C;Truth says do not create it,&#x201D; and also Moshe whose attribute was Truth was greatly disturbed in his soul that the way of evil ones would succeed, and that Pharaoh could enslave the people of Israel. For is it not complete falsehood? Pharaoh was completely evil. This disturbed Moshe at the heart.</p>
<p>The attribute of his brother Aharon was Hesed (Loving-kindness), and he learned always to have a mind that suffers and endured all, to accept all with love without any accusations against the blessed God. This is as the Midrash explains (Tanchuma <italic>Shemot</italic>, 10), &#x201C;Who gave man a mouth [as God answered Moshe]? Rabbi Yochanan said, who gave the advice to flee from before Pharaoh?&#x201D; Meaning that the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moshe, &#x201C;who sent it into your heart to flee? Isn&#x2019;t that the attribute of Aharon, which is contrary to your nature? And your attribute is that of Truth, and according to your attribute there is no reason to flee from the evil Pharaoh, yet I taught you the attribute of patience.&#x201D; And after Moshe Rabeynu fled from before Pharaoh he learned to have the mind of one who is long suffering.</p>
<p>This is the very reason why the Holy One, blessed be He, appeared before him in the burning bush. It was in order to teach him this attribute, and He showed him that He dwelled in the bush.<sup><xref rid="fn73">5</xref></sup> There he learned how to be immensely patient, &#x201C;for I am with him in times of trouble&#x201D; (Tehillim, 91:15), and he would be long suffering before Pharaoh. For this reason Moshe Rabeynu blessed Yosef (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 33:16) with &#x201C;the will of He who dwelled in the bush.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Here Moshe Rabeynu wanted to include the attribute of patience into the attribute of Yosef the <italic>Tsaddik</italic>, so he would be filled with good will toward Israel without any angry complaints against any soul in Israel. In the tribe of Yosef severe judgments arise against Israel at times when they turn away from the will of the blessed God. Thus we find the Prophet warning Israel and saying to them (Amos, 5:6), &#x201C;Lest the house of Yosef break forth like a fire,&#x201D; meaning that his nature may not be of one who is easily angered and that he act with good will toward Israel.</p>
<p>Therefore he said to him, &#x201C;the will of He who dwelled in the bush,&#x201D; meaning that the blessed God will teach you the attribute of patience as He taught me with the bush. Then when this attribute settled into the heart of Moshe, the peace necessary to redeem Israel was made. This is the meaning of &#x201C;Hesed and Truth have met,&#x201D; &#x201C;meeting&#x201D; meaning that they opposed one another; for Aharon&#x2019;s attribute was Hesed, and he said, create it, while Moshe was Truth, and he said, do not create it. So when it was necessary for Moshe to flee from Pharaoh he was called (Daniel, 8:12), &#x201C;and Truth was sent earthward.&#x201D; This means that the attribute of Truth reached an equilibrium with Hesed, and the attribute of Truth was made into Tsedek (righteousness), meaning like Aharon, so then he also said &#x201C;create it.&#x201D; When they reached this equilibrium, then &#x201C;Tsedek and Peace have kissed,&#x201D; for then truth also said &#x201C;create it.&#x201D; For when Peace initially said &#x201C;do not create it,&#x201D; it wanted to be in opposition to the attribute of Truth, for Aharon&#x2019;s attribute is Peace. But now that Truth was made into Tsedek and said &#x201C;create it,&#x201D; then Peace would not say &#x201C;do not create it.&#x201D; In this, &#x201C;Tsedek and Peace have kissed,&#x201D; through the &#x201C;cleaving of soul to soul.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;(Moshe to God) Why have you done evil toward the people &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 5:22)</p>
<p>At first glance, it is a wonder that such a word against the blessed God could come out of the mouth of Moshe. But truly, Moshe Rabeynu was a great lover of Israel, so when he heard from the mouth of the Almighty that they would need to remain in Egypt until all the plagues had passed through Egypt, he then asked, &#x201C;is it not in Your power to redeem the people in an instant? Why then must they be in Egypt for the twelve months, to see the plagues and be terrified by them?&#x201D; As it is written (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 28:60), &#x201C;the diseases of Egypt which you were afraid of,&#x201D; for truly Israel also feared the plagues. So therefore he asked this of the Holy One, blessed be He, and God showed him that even this was necessary for Israel. For in truth, Israel had a connection to the Egyptians, as it is written (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 4:34), &#x201C;You took a nation from the midst of a nation,&#x201D; meaning, as a newborn falling forth from the womb of his mother also has a connection to the mother. Therefore they also needed refinement and to fear the plagues, for the fear itself refined their hearts, as we find in the Gemara (<italic>Berachot</italic>, 59a), &#x201C;Thunder was created only to remove the crookedness from the heart.&#x201D; This is the meaning of the verse in the chapter of Tehillim against evil spirits (Tehillim, 91:8), &#x201C;you will only see with your eyes, and you will see the recompense of the evil ones.&#x201D; In other words, that you need to see that by means of this fear how the crookedness of the heart will be refined into good.</p>

<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And E-lohim spoke to Moshe saying to him, I am Hashem.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 6:2)</p>
<p>After Moshe Rabeynu spoke words against the blessed God, God rebuked him, and this is why the Torah says &#x201C;<italic>Vai&#x2019;daber</italic>,&#x201D; &#x201C;and E-lohim spoke to Moshe&#x201D; (as opposed to &#x201C;He said to him&#x201D;), which is a form denoting difficulty. The name &#x201C;E-lohim&#x201D; also teaches of this (judgment), so immediately after it says, &#x201C;and He said [<italic>vai&#x2019;omer</italic>] to him.&#x201D; This is like one who became angry at his friend, yet he loves him; so when he sees his friend astonished and frightened, he then hints to him that all his anger was only outward and momentary. Thus it is here, saying, &#x201C;and He said to him, I am Hashem,&#x201D; for saying denotes softness, meaning that He whispered to him that He is not really angry, God forbid. This is also why it says &#x201C;I am Hashem,&#x201D; for the name YHVH, blessed be He, is filled with compassion, and the strong rebuke was only outward and temporary, so do not be afraid.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And E-lohim spoke to Moshe &#x2026; And I appeared &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 6:2&#x2013;6)</p>
<p>Meaning that after Moshe Rabeynu asked the Holy One, blessed be He, &#x201C;is it not in Your power to redeem Israel immediately? So why must you cause distress in arranging all of these plagues?&#x201D; To this, the blessed God told Moshe to go to Israel, and that they would not listen to him. And the Holy One, blessed be He, showed him that the <italic>birrur</italic> (spiritual purification) for Israel was not complete, and the time had not yet come for the final redemption. This is why it is said afterward, &#x201C;these are the heads of their father&#x2019;s houses,&#x201D; and related their lineage. All together there were found forty-five leaders of the thousands of Israel. He showed him that these forty-five leaders also needed to undergo further clarification, until even the last one, Pinchas, who seemed to be the most purified, meriting the <italic>brit shalom</italic>, the covenant of peace from the blessed God, also needed to undergo more refinement. This is hinted at in the way the letter <italic>vav</italic> is traditionally written cut in half in the Torah scroll in the word <italic>shalom</italic> (<italic>vav ketiya</italic>). This <italic>Parsha</italic> necessitated that all the great ones in Israel proceed with great fear of heaven, and this is (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 10:12), &#x201C;what<sup><xref rid="fn74">6</xref></sup> does Hashem ask of you if not to fear Him,&#x201D; hinting at the forty-five kinds of fear.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Go, speak unto Pharaoh, king of Egypt,&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 6:11)</p>
<p>It is written in the Midrash (Tanchuma, <italic>Vaeira</italic>, 2), &#x201C;The saying goes, there is no profit in acacia wood, only in a thorny tree.&#x201D; To understand the Midrash, we find that Pharaoh did not listen to Moshe; and also of Israel it is written, &#x201C;and they did not listen [to Moshe].&#x201D; This is, &#x201C;there is no profit in acacia wood,&#x201D; meaning a good tree called &#x201C;acacia,&#x201D; which cannot be made into anything and is of no benefit. &#x201C;Only in a thorny tree,&#x201D; for in this we see the advantage of the acacia; for the thorn causes pain, while the acacia, even though it cannot be made into anything, still it causes no pain. This is the difference. Even though Israel also did not listen to him, it was only because their patience had been tried from the bitterness of slavery, and afterward they listened to him. But Pharaoh was insolent and obstinate, and from this the advantage of the children of Israel is recognized.</p>
<p>The seven plagues in this week&#x2019;s <italic>Parsha</italic> correspond to the verse (Mishlei, 6:16), &#x201C;these six does God hate, and seven are an abomination to His soul.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn75">7</xref></sup> Only Shlomo thought to order the sins, so therefore he started with small sins, and then after the serious ones. Yet here, when the Egyptians were punished for all these sins, which were saturated in their hearts, they were first punished for the serious ones. The plague of blood corresponded to &#x201C;spreading discord among brothers,&#x201D; for the main cause of being far from God is the attribute of anger, and even though lust distances one from the blessed God, the attribute of anger causes one to be the furthest from God. &#x201C;A false witness who &#x2018;blows&#x2019; lies&#x201D; was the plague of frogs, for the Egyptians would devise lies about Israel, and the term &#x201C;blows lies&#x201D; means that they would take a small matter and &#x201C;blow it up&#x201D; into a great one. In Israel, the law is that if an individual sees another sinning, and there are no other witnesses, it is forbidden for him to tell, as in the incident of Tuvia sinning (<italic>Pesachim</italic>, 113b).</p>
<p>This is because when there are no witnesses in a case, then it is proof that the blessed God does not want to publicize the sin but rather wants to hide it in this world; so therefore it is forbidden to publicize it. Yet the Egyptians would publicize everything, so the plague of frogs came upon them who also would croak and howl so loudly that the Egyptians could not hear their own voices. Corresponding to &#x201C;legs hastening to do evil&#x201D; was the plague of lice, for with Israel it is said (Yesahya, 1:21), &#x201C;righteousness lodged in it.&#x201D; This means that they would delay the judgment, not carrying it out immediately. Even when they knew that the judgment was correct, still they would put it aside on the chance that some merit would be found.</p>
<p>The Egyptians acted in the opposite way, for they would run to harm Israel, yet God in His mercy would guard them and even those who raced to hurt them could not. The plague of lice corresponded to this, for small creatures also make rapid movements, yet with all their quickness they effect very little. &#x201C;A heart which devises evil imaginations&#x201D; was the plague of wild beasts, since they would devise plans to cause harm to Israel, so the plague of wild beasts was a mixture of different beasts like the mixture of all their evil plans. This is why it says, &#x201C;and I will divide the land of Goshen &#x2026; and there will be no wild beasts there,&#x201D; meaning that the blessed God will make it clear that among Israel there is no mixture of evil thoughts.</p>
<p>Corresponding to &#x201C;hands shedding clean blood&#x201D; was the plague of pestilence. Corresponding to &#x201C;a lying tongue&#x201D; was the plague of boils, in that they had the impunity to spread lies, so therefore they were shamed, as it said, &#x201C;the magicians of Egypt could not stand before Moshe.&#x201D; Corresponding to &#x201C;arrogant eyes,&#x201D; meaning that they boasted that they possessed all influence all good, was the plague of hail, for the principal influence in the physical world is rain; and they saw that what came to Egypt was hail. Therefore Moshe Rabeynu effected this plague, because he was clean with regard to arrogance, as it is written (<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 12:3), &#x201C;and the man Moshe more humble than all other men &#x2026;&#x201D;.</p>

<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Moshe and Aharon went unto Pharaoh and said to him, thus spoke God &#x2026; If you refuse to let my people go &#x2026; I will bring locusts &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 10:3&#x2013;4)</p>
<p>How did Moshe understand to release Pharaoh from the plague of locusts? God had not tell him specifically to do this. Rather, he understood from where the blessed God tells him to say to Pharaoh, &#x201C;in order to place these My signs before him, and so that you may tell your sons&#x201D; (<italic>Shemot</italic>, 10:1). He said specifically, &#x201C;before him,&#x201D; or &#x201C;in his midst,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn76">8</xref></sup> meaning among themselves, as it is written (Yesahya, 19:2), &#x201C;And I will set Egyptian against Egyptian, and the Egyptians will then fight among themselves.&#x201D; This is why the verse says, &#x201C;[to tell your sons of] the havoc that I have wrought,&#x201D; which is itself the wonder, and wonders do not occur according to nature. On this He said to him, &#x201C;so that you may tell,&#x201D; and from this Moshe understood that it is the plague of locusts, for locusts contain a good attribute, as it is written (Mishlei, 30:27), &#x201C;the locusts have no king, yet they all go forth in bands.&#x201D; Since there is unity and love among them they have no need of a king, for the need for a king comes from a lack of unity among men. Since there is no hatred in this species, they have no need of a king. When the blessed God undertstood that they hate each other and would fight among themselves, then He understood that this would be realized in the world with the plague of locusts, for this species would come to wage war on Egypt. The punishment for their contentiousness corresponds to this species, and it is so even with one who trusts in Him that they will not hate them, they too will turn against them.<sup><xref rid="fn77">9</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and there was a deep darkness &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 10:22)</p>
<p>It is written in the Midrash (<italic>Shemot</italic> Rabba, 14:3), &#x201C;why did He bring darkness over them? For there were [Jewish] evil ones in that generation who did not want to leave Egypt, so they died in the three days of darkness so that the Egyptians could not say, look how they are punished just like us.&#x201D; The matter here is that the <italic>avot</italic> (Patriarchs) were called <italic>avot</italic> (<italic>av</italic> means progenitor) because none of their thoughts were by chance, yet came out from the source of life, and none of their thoughts were frivolous. Souls emerged from their very thoughts even after several generations. We find this with the trial of Avraham when he went to save Lot and to run off and fight with the kings. Here he was uncertain whether or not to go through with it all,<sup><xref rid="fn78">10</xref></sup> until the Holy One, blessed be He, illuminated into him that it was proper to run after them for he needed to save two good offshoots (Ruth and Naomi) (<italic>Bava Kama</italic>, 38b), as is known. Indeed, from Avraham&#x2019;s very thoughts of uncertainty, perhaps not to chase them, other souls were later born, the very souls that now wanted to &#x201C;sit and not act&#x201D; (not to leave Egypt), and the root of their souls was also inclined not to fight with the Egyptians. Now the attributes of Avraham Avinu become clear in that these opinions also were from that blessed God, and all these died in the three days of darkness.</p>
<p>The three plagues in this week&#x2019;s <italic>Parsha</italic>&#x2014;locusts, darkness, and the slaying of the firstborn&#x2014;correspond to the verse (Mishlei, 8:13), &#x201C;[the fear of God is to hate evil,] pride, arrogance, and the evil way,&#x201D; etc. &#x201C;The evil way&#x201D; means jealousy, desire, and gluttony. Corresponding to this He gave them the plague of locusts. &#x201C;Arrogance&#x201D; means elevating oneself above another whom he should rather be subdued before, and for this He gave the plague of darkness, as it is written (Mishlei, 20:20), &#x201C;Whoever curses his father and mother, his lamp shall be extinguished in deep darkness.&#x201D; For even though truly one must only listen to God alone, and a man only has a small portion in his father and mother, yet when a father and mother want to incline their child in the ways of the Torah he must listen to them, and to subdue himself before them. And the arrogant, that is, one who does not want to subdue himself in this way, of him it is said, &#x201C;his lamp shall be extinguished in deep darkness.&#x201D; &#x201C;Pride,&#x201D; when he boasts of himself with greater elevation than is befitting him; corresponding to this was the slaying of the firstborn, for the expression <italic>b&#x2019;chor</italic>, firstborn, denotes elevating oneself.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; draw out, and take yourselves a lamb &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 12:21)</p>
<p>(<italic>Shemot</italic> Rabba, 16:2) &#x201C;draw out, remove your hands from idolatry. Take a lamb, that of mitzvah.&#x201D; It is written (Mishlei, 15:19), &#x201C;The way of the lazy is a hedge of thorns, and the way of the upright is a clear path.&#x201D; &#x201C;The way of the lazy&#x201D; means even if one prevents himself from evil actions, evil thoughts, and evil desires, yet he does not refrain from these out of his love of the blessed God, but rather as a slacker. That is, he understands that these modes of action will not succeed in this world, or in another way where it is still not out of love for the blessed God. This way is thus compared to a hedge of thorns,<sup><xref rid="fn79">11</xref></sup> for the heart cannot be free of thoughts and desires even for a moment. Then once desire is removed from the heart, thoughts of anger and the like enter in, and in this way the whole way becomes like a hedge of thorns. With all the scouring of the soul and work to remove one thing, then another improper thing will come to take its place.</p>
<p>However, &#x201C;the way of the upright,&#x201D; meaning one who removes evil attributes out of his love for the blessed God, &#x201C;is a clear path&#x201D; for the good. For when he removes the evil attributes from his heart, what remains in his heart is the love of God, and owing to this force nothing else improper will enter his heart. The numerical equivalent of &#x201C;draw out,&#x201D; &#x201C;<italic>meeshchu</italic>,&#x201D; is 366, 365 for the days of the year, and one more for the blessed God who &#x201C;rides&#x201D; on them. So everyplace where the word &#x201C;thus,&#x201D; <italic>az</italic> (<italic>alef zayin</italic>), is written, the meaning is that the <italic>Aluf</italic>&#x2014;the chief, meaning the blessed God, rides on seven (<italic>zayin</italic>&#x2014;7, the seven days of the week).</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;This is the statute of the Pesach offering &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 12:43)</p>
<p>It is written in the Midrash (<italic>Shemot</italic> Rabba, 19:2), &#x201C;the Pesach offering is called a statute [<italic>choq</italic>], and the Red Heifer is also called a statute [<italic>choq</italic>], and you do not know which is greater. There is a parable of two queens who are walking together as one, and they seem equal. However, the greater one is the one whose companion seems to be accompanying her. Thus with the Pesach and the Red Heifer, each of which is called a <italic>choq</italic>, the ashes of the Red Heifer are greater because you can not eat the Pesach offering without it, as it is written, &#x2018;and the unclean person shall take of the ashes of the burnt offering.&#x2019;&#x201D; The statute of the Pesach offering corresponds to the first commandment of the decalogue, &#x201C;<italic>Anochi</italic>&#x2014;I am Hashem your God,&#x201D; which includes all of the positive commandments.</p>
<p>The statute of the Red Heifer corresponds to the second commandment, &#x201C;you shall not have any false gods before Me,&#x201D; which includes all of the prohibitive commandments. And truly, the intellect would deem it proper that a man is not able to understand the deep preciousness of the first commandment, &#x201C;<italic>Anochi</italic>&#x2014;I am Hashem your God,&#x201D; (henceforth, simply, <italic>Anochi</italic>) before his heart had been refined by &#x201C;you shall not have any false gods before Me.&#x201D; First one must turn from evil, and then afterward he can do good (see Tehillim, 34:15). (So why does &#x201C;you shall not have&#x201D; not precede <italic>Anochi</italic> in the order of the commandments?) However, the blessed God, in His great compassion, had the declaration &#x201C;<italic>Anochi</italic>&#x201D; come before the declaration, &#x201C;you shall not have,&#x201D; for if it were not so there would not be a man alive who could come to an understanding of the declaration, &#x201C;<italic>Anochi</italic>,&#x201D; for who is the man who can say, &#x201C;I have refined my heart in all the prohibitive commandments&#x201D;?</p>
<p>Concerning this, David haMelech said (Tehillim, 138:2), &#x201C;For You have made Your saying greater than Your name.&#x201D; &#x201C;Saying&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn80">12</xref></sup> always means in a whisper. This whisper is the blessed God saying that He will afterward make it clear that the heart of Israel is thoroughly cleaned. On this it says (in the same verse), &#x201C;I will express gratitude to Your name,&#x201D; meaning gratitude for the good and great kindness You did in first giving us the declaration of the commandment &#x201C;<italic>Anochi</italic>&#x201D; in order that afterward our hearts could be refined with the declaration of the commandment &#x201C;you shall not have.&#x201D; Moshe Rabeynu corresponds to &#x201C;<italic>Anochi</italic>,&#x201D; and Rabbi Akiva ben Yosef corresponds to &#x201C;you shall not have,&#x201D; based on the known principle that each and every one of the souls of Israel are rooted in the letters of the Torah. The function of Moshe Rabeynu, who corresponds to <italic>Anochi</italic> was to clarify all the Oneness of the blessed God in the world.</p>
<p>The soul of Rabbi Akiva, who corresponds to &#x201C;you shall not have,&#x201D; served to refine out all the evil, dross, and refuse from the heart of Israel, and to distance it from evil, which is in the category of &#x201C;you shall not have.&#x201D; His innovation of many new boundaries and &#x201C;fences&#x201D; around the existing laws served to clean the heart of Israel further, for they became included in the category of &#x201C;you shall not have.&#x201D; Furthermore, all the <italic>halachot</italic> of the forbidden and the permitted, the unfit and the kosher, the impure and the pure, were to refine the bad out of the good.</p>
<p>This is explained in the Gemara (<italic>Menachot</italic>, 29b), &#x201C;at the time when Moshe Rabeynu ascended to Heaven, he found the Holy One, blessed be He, attaching crowns to the letters of the Torah. He said, &#x2018;Master of the world, who stays thy hand [why are you adding to the Torah, is it not already perfect]?&#x2019; He said to him, there will come a man after a few generation, and Akiva ben Yosef is his name. He will expound mountains upon mountains of laws from each crown on each letter of the Torah. (Moses descends into the future and finds himself sitting in the back row of one of Rabbi Akiva&#x2019;s classes.) Moshe was rendered unable to understand anything until a student asked a question and Rabbi Akiva answered, &#x201C;this is the law as it was delivered to Moshe at Mount Sinai.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>
<p>Since Moshe saw how much Rabbi Akiva expanded so many derivative laws from the commandment, &#x201C;you shall not have any false gods,&#x201D; thus he was rendered powerless to understand (as the Gemara states). It is known, that the root of everything is &#x201C;<italic>Anochi</italic>&#x2014;I am Hashem your God,&#x201D; and, &#x201C;you shall not have any false gods,&#x201D; which is a special kind of security so man does not become distanced from his Creator, and as a result of this Moshe&#x2019;s mind became weak. This continued until he arrived at one law, in other words, Moshe then saw why all these boundaries are necessary; &#x201C;he said to him, this is the law as it was delivered to Moshe at Mount Sinai.&#x201D; This &#x201C;one law&#x201D; was &#x201C;<italic>Anochi</italic>,&#x201D; for this is the entire principle of the Torah, as it says (Zohar, <italic>Devarim</italic>, 264b), &#x201C;<italic>Shema Yisroel</italic>, Hear O Israel, Hashem is God, Hashem is One, this is a great principle in the Torah.&#x201D; &#x201C;You shall not have&#x201D; is only to the house of Israel from straying from, &#x201C;<italic>Anochi</italic>&#x2014;I am Hashem your God.&#x201D; Upon hearing this, Moshe&#x2019;s mind powers were returned to him, for he then understood that the main principle was given to him.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Sanctify unto Me all the firstborn &#x2026; of man and of animal &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 13:2)</p>
<p>The principle of &#x201C;man&#x201D; relates to the <italic>Chochma</italic> (wisdom) and the thought in the brain. This is the principle of the essential form of man. &#x201C;Animal&#x201D; teaches of the power of action. We find that the blessed God commanded to sanctify and join both of them, action and thought. Then the essential form of man will be complete and refined in the will of the blessed God. On this it is said (Tehillim, 36:7, and also recited after the <italic>Amida</italic> of the <italic>Mincha</italic> of Shabbat), &#x201C;you, Hashem, preserve [<italic>toshia</italic>] both man and beast.&#x201D; Here man is thought, and beast hints at action. We find that Moshe Rabeynu was the <italic>Chochma</italic> (wisdom) of all of Israel, and all his power was in this, meaning the mind and power of thought to have the blessed God always before him. Therefore the entire Torah speaks principally of the performance of actions, and thus actions will then also be as refined as thought. To this end Moshe Rabeynu made the <italic>Mishkan</italic> (Tabernacle), for its place parallel to the form of man was the depths of the heart, and the <italic>Mishkan</italic> could be taken apart and brought to a different place. The wisdom of Shlomo haMelech was in actions, so therefore he built the Holy Temple in a fixed place. Also, the book of Mishlei, which he wrote, speaks mainly of the uprightness of the heart, and thought that will be established like action.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Sanctify unto Me all the firstborn &#x2026; and Moshe said, remember the day you went out of Egypt &#x2026; and you shall not eat leaven &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 13:2&#x2013;3)</p>
<p>Why did Moshe first tell Israel the passage concerning <italic>Matsot</italic> (Verses 3&#x2013;10), and then after the passage of the firstborn (Verses 11&#x2013;15), when the Holy One, blessed be He, had originally commanded him only concerning the firstborn (in verse 2)? The matter of this is, the blessed God commanded him to say the passage of the firstborn in order to be refined and clean of all lusts. This is because in the drop of semen which creates the firstborn the overpowering of lusts is prominent. This is why it says, &#x201C;sanctify unto Me all the firstborn.&#x201D; However, Moshe Rabeynu knew that it is not possible for man to guard himself from these lusts if he had not first radiated being clean from the desire for food. If a man is clean in what he receives, then he will also be refined in what he gives out. This is because the neck that receives is aligned corresponding to the <italic>brit</italic> of the penis. With this intention was the passage of <italic>Matsot</italic> said to them before the passage of the firstborn.</p>

<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> B&#x2019;<small>SHALACH</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And it was, when Pharaoh sent the people away &#x2026; and Moshe took the bones of Yosef with him &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 13:17&#x2013;19)</p>
<p>Why were these two verses juxtaposed? When Moshe Rabeynu saw Pharaoh running closely after them even after they were redeemed, he then had the doubt whether or not Israel had reached its final completion. In this case they would still have a connection to Pharaoh, and perhaps it was because of the long time they spent in Egypt that they formed a connection with them. Furthermore, since he saw that He did not lead the people by way of the land of the Philistines<sup><xref rid="fn81">13</xref></sup> in case the people would regret leaving, from this Moshe also understood that Israel had not yet been completed in their final form of refinement. It is written in the <italic>Pirke Avot</italic> (Ch. 3, Mishna 9), &#x201C;He whose fear of sin precedes his wisdom, his wisdom will endure.&#x201D; The matter is, there are times when the blessed God hides His actions and conceals His intentions from mankind. Then man does not know what the will of the blessed God is in that particular matter, as we find in the matter before us, where it was a wonder in Moshe&#x2019;s view why God did not lead the people through the land of the Philistines.</p>
<p>If one sees that the blessed God is dealing with him in a hidden, inscrutable way, then he is advised not to be overly clever, but should rather perform the commandments with simplicity and include himself (as much as possible) in the attribute of the fear of God. This is &#x201C;Moshe took the bones of Yosef &#x2026;&#x201D; For it is the way of the <italic>Tsaddik</italic> (the just) when he faces uncertainty to accept that the deficiency (in his surroundings) is really a deficiency in himself. This is the matter of taking the bones of Yosef, for when Moshe had accepted that the deficiency<sup><xref rid="fn82">14</xref></sup> really depended on himself, then he began to enter himself into the attribute of the fear of God. This is hinted at in the bones of Yosef, for the main attribute of Yosef haTsaddik was the fear of God, as explained in the verse (Amos, 5:6), &#x201C;lest the house of Yosef overcome like a fire.&#x201D; And this is &#x201C;he whose fear of sin precedes his wisdom,&#x201D; which is the attribute of Yosef haTsaddik.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And they took their journey from Succot, and they encamped at Eitam, on the edge of the wilderness.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 13:20)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Succot&#x201D; means trust (for living in a temporary dwelling requires trust), and, &#x201C;Eitam&#x201D; represents vigorous strength.<sup><xref rid="fn83">15</xref></sup> &#x201C;And God went before them by day with a pillar of cloud &#x2026; the pillar of cloud did not depart from them by day nor the pillar of fire by night.&#x201D; The pillar of cloud teaches of the fear of God, and the pillar of fire teaches of trust. Sometimes we find in the heart of man great trust and awesome strength, called &#x201C;day,&#x201D; which requires him to enter into the attribute of the fear of God. At other times we find in the heart of man pronounced fear, called &#x201C;night,&#x201D; which necessitates that he increase and strengthen his trust in the blessed God. This is the meaning of &#x201C;with a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.&#x201D; This is the explanation of the Mishna in <italic>Pirke Avot</italic> (Ch. 3, Mishna 17), &#x201C;If there is no wisdom, then there is no fear, and if there is no fear, then there is no wisdom.&#x201D; Wisdom is really vigorous strength, for wisdom fortifies and strengthens the heart of the wise. Yet still, if there is no fear of the blessed God, and he does not understand that in but an instant the blessed God can take away from him this wisdom, which is strength, then his wisdom is considered as nothing, for he fancies that his strength can withstand even the blessed God. There is no nonsense greater than this.</p>
<p>&#x201C;If there is no wisdom then there is no fear,&#x201D; meaning one who has no trust in the blessed God, yet he is constantly in a state of fear even with no words of Torah, then his fear is not authentic but rather imaginary, for one who truly fears God has in his heart strength and trust in the blessed God. This is as it says once, &#x201C;and the children of Israel went on the dry land through the sea,&#x201D; while another time it says, &#x201C;through the sea on the dry land.&#x201D; &#x201C;Sea&#x201D; teaches of fear, meaning prayer, and &#x201C;dry land&#x201D; teaches of vigorous strength and trust. The principal strength is the Torah, the strength of Israel, and in this a man will know that his prayer is accepted, if he can make words of Torah out of his prayer. Likewise he will know that his Torah is the Torah of truth if a prayer and heartfelt cry accompanies the Torah in which he is engrossed, for both must be joined together as one.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and at night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they might go by day and by night.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 13:21)</p>
<p>It is written (Tehillim, 68:36), &#x201C;Awesome is E-lohim from Your sanctuary, the God of Israel gives strength and awesome might to His people, blessed is E-lohim.&#x201D; &#x201C;Awesome is E-lohim,&#x201D; for there is much reason to fear and tremble before Him. Yet still, at the place of the Holy Temple, where all fear goes forth to the world, of this it says, &#x201C;Awesome is E-lohim from Your sanctuary.&#x201D; From there He gives &#x201C;strength and awesome might&#x201D; to His people Israel. Because of this the verse ends, &#x201C;blessed is E-lohim,&#x201D; meaning that He has a fountainhead of life that is ever flowing and never ceasing. Yaakov Avinu had these two attributes of fear and trust, corresponding to the face of the eagle in the <italic>Merkava</italic> (chariot) of Yechezkel, for it is the nature of the eagle to be merciful with its own young and cruel to strangers. This is to &#x201C;go by day,&#x201D; meaning with mercy toward Israel, and &#x201C;by night,&#x201D; against the nations.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; that they turn back and encamp before Pi Hahirot &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 14:2)</p>
<p>On the matter of the impurity of this form of idolatry, which is the <italic>kelipah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn84">16</xref></sup> of <italic>z&#x2019;nut</italic>, or rampant licentiousness, so accordingly this particular idol in the desert was in the form of a male and female.<sup><xref rid="fn85">17</xref></sup> Therefore its name was <italic>Pi Hahirot</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn86">18</xref></sup> for the nations suppose that freedom means that they can extend themselves and perform all the desires of their heart. On this Pharaoh said, &#x201C;they are confounded in the land,&#x201D; meaning that when they reach this form of idolatry it will seem to them that they are enslaved (and confounded by this) since they make such efforts to fence themselves off from physical desire. Yet actually the opposite is true, for they the nations are enslaved to this, for since their own hearts are not in their possession (or in their control) such that their intellect should rule over them. Yet rather, their desires rule over them, and there is no enslavement greater than this.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; over against it shall you encamp by the sea.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 14:2)</p>
<p>It is written (Gemara <italic>Berachot</italic>, 63a), &#x201C;Know Him in all your ways, even concerning a sin.&#x201D; Such is the case with &#x201C;over against it [the idol of <italic>ba&#x2019;al tsafon</italic>] shall you encamp by the sea.&#x201D; Even if your actions are similar to the Egyptians, yet still, the actions of Israel are good, for the people of Israel, who are the portion of the blessed God, are cleaving in simple life without any garment of separation and drawing their energy from this the Source of life. Just as the blessed God is disencumbered of any attribute or any external appearance, but rather exists in absolute simplicity, so too is Israel at the source of its life free of any external force, separating garment, or subordinate power. Whether concerning wisdom, or elevated status, or wealth, it is (at the source) disencumbered of any influence other than God. With the nations, however, each particular nation has its own power and external coloring, from which it draws its life force and to which it grasps.</p>
<p>For example, the power of Babylon was in its status, and the power of the Philistines was in each one asked for a certain trick with which to attain wealth, or a known form of wisdom, or a craft where he could be sure to gain from it a livelihood. The matter of Moab and its <italic>kelipah</italic> was strength, for it was strong in its mind from the power of eating and similar things that strengthen and extend the mind. This was the form of its idolatry, called <italic>Chemosh</italic> (meaning &#x201C;dried&#x201D;), meaning the form of a man dried from its childhood form.<sup><xref rid="fn87">19</xref></sup> This is what they feared in particular, lest this power that extended them would be taken away, like a man in his old age where his desire to eat decreases and he can no longer extend his mind as before. And similarly all the nations, each one in its own way.</p>
<p>Now the blessed God dispersed Israel among the nations, and this was so they would be among these powers, so that they could clarify, refine, and &#x201C;whiten&#x201D; themselves concerning these powers, and not turn to them, rather placing their trust in God. And in the future, when the blessed God will redeem them, then He will give them all the powers from which they had refined themselves, like the elevated status of Babylon, the good wealth of the Philistines, the mind extensions of Moab. He shall give them all of these in recompense for all the tribulations they incurred in exile. Thus when the blessed God shall plant these good things among Israel, then these attributes will be filled with <italic>Kedusha</italic> (holiness) and also among Israel they will be without limits, as they are coming from the blessed God. Among the nations of the world these good things are given in a certain amount with a limit, but with Israel they will be of the Providence of the blessed God, so of itself they will be without limit, for the blessed God is without limit.</p>
<p>This matter is explained in the prophecy of Yesahya concerning the fall of the Philistines where it is said, &#x201C;and the firstborn of the poor I shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety, and I will kill your root with famine&#x201D; (Yesahya, 14:30). These will be repayed measure for measure. Since they say that they need to run after reasons for livelihood, in order that they should have security in their lives (yet security based on a subordinate earthly power), therefore it is said, &#x201C;and I have killed your root with famine.&#x201D; Then when they fall, their power and bounty will be entered into Israel, since they were in exile among them and were tested concerning this attribute, and did not place their trust in it but rather in the blessed God. Therefore, &#x201C;the firstborn of the poor I shall feed,&#x201D; meaning Israel, who are poor and placing their reliance in the blessed God, so now with their (rich Philistines&#x2019;) fall they (poor Israel) will be fed and supported.</p>
<p>In a similar way will it be with the downfall of all the other nations. This is the explanation of the verse, &#x201C;over against it shall you encamp by the sea,&#x201D; for enumerated here are four powers and <italic>kelipot</italic> of Egypt, which are <italic>migdol</italic> (tower), <italic>yam</italic> (sea), <italic>ba&#x2019;al tsafon</italic> (master of the north), and <italic>pi haheirot</italic> (the mouth of freedom). Therefore the verse says, &#x201C;over against it shall you encamp,&#x201D; meaning corresponding to them and similar to them in their powers, so will all the benefits and bounty of Egypt be yours, and nevertheless you will be redeemed from them and they will fall before you. For all of these powers, when they are among Israel, are filled with <italic>Kedusha</italic> even if they seem similar to Egypt, for &#x201C;E-lohim made them one over against the other [everything in <italic>Kedusha</italic> has its &#x201C;evil twin&#x201D; in impurity].&#x201D; The accuser had seen them at the Red Sea and claimed, &#x201C;what is the difference between these and these? [for they both served idols],&#x201D; yet the blessed God testified for them that there is nothing in the hearts of Israel except the love of the blessed God.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and the children of Israel left with a high hand.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 14:8)</p>
<p>The Aramaic translation reads, &#x201C;with an uncovered head,&#x201D; meaning not with high hand against others, but rather with pride and confidence, since they are now free, without fear from any man.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;God will fight for you, and you shall be silent.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 14:14)</p>
<p>Concerning this they were commanded to hold their peace and refrain from action, not even to pray to the blessed God. With the war against Amalek we find the opposite, where it is said, &#x201C;and it was, when Moshe lifted his hands [they succeeded],&#x201D; and it said, &#x201C;and his hands were <italic>emunah</italic>, steady [faithful],&#x201D; where the Aramaic translation reads, &#x201C;his hands were spread out in prayer.&#x201D; There is a difference between Amalek and the rest of the nations. The rest of the nations say that not all is in the hands of Heaven, and ascribe all the influence of good on their own power, saying, &#x201C;my strength and the power of my hands has gotten me this wealth.&#x201D; Therefore in Israel&#x2019;s war with Egypt they were commanded to hold their peace, meaning to show that all is in the hands of Heaven, and even the prayer that a man offers cannot be done independent of the will of the blessed God. Thus it is said, &#x201C;and you will be silent.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Yet with Amalek, called by the Gemara in <italic>Kedushin</italic> (18a), &#x201C;the apostate of Israel,&#x201D; he ascribes all his actions to the blessed God, saying that all the evil that he does comes from the will of the blessed God, for without the will of the blessed he could not do this. Against him the advice given is to show that the fear of Heaven is in the power (the choice) of man, and man needs Divine service and prayer. On this it says in the Gemara (<italic>Sanhedrin</italic>, 60a), concerning Ravshakei, an apostate of Israel (see 2 Kings, Ch. 18), who said, &#x201C;have I come up to this place without God to destroy it?&#x201D; In this way he attributes his evil actions to the blessed God, and against him the advice was given to pray.<sup><xref rid="fn88">20</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Thus God saved Israel on that day &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 14:30)</p>
<p>After the salvations of the redemption from Egypt they needed to experience <italic>tsimtsum</italic> (constriction). In the days of Passover there is a constriction with regard to eating, hinted at in matsah, &#x201C;the bread of poverty,&#x201D; but here (in this verse) after they merited the splitting of the Red Sea on the seventh day of Passover, it says, &#x201C;thus God saved,&#x201D; etc. On that day they no longer needed fences and restrictions, and this is hinted at in what is written in the Mishne Torah (meaning the book of <italic>Devarim</italic>, 16:8), &#x201C;six days,&#x201D; and it does not say seven.<sup><xref rid="fn89">21</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; horse and its rider He threw into the sea.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 15:1)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Horse&#x201D; teaches of speed and expansion. &#x201C;Rider&#x201D; teaches of a settled frame of mind that contains the horse so it will not run. With the nations of the world, at a time when they see the pleasures of this world, they do not have the power to contain themselves but rather expand with all the desires of their hearts. Therefore it says concerning them, first &#x201C;horse&#x201D; and after &#x201C;rider,&#x201D; for after they have been filled with all their desires they do not have the power for more, and they cease to act. Yet with the blessed God it says (Habakuk, 3:8), &#x201C;when You ride upon Your horses and chariots of salvations.&#x201D; For it says first &#x201C;You ride,&#x201D; meaning that when the blessed God gives good to Israel, before it comes into the possession of man, He constricts it, so that he does not take until he fears the giver. Then He gives it in a way that it will be received in the full will of the heart. This is why it says first &#x201C;when You ride,&#x201D; teaching of reckoning and a settled mind, and after &#x201C;Your horses,&#x201D; denoting the effluence of good with great velocity.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;God is a man of war, God is His name.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 15:3)</p>
<p>It is written in the Midrash on the Scroll of Esther (Rabba, 6:3), &#x201C;With evil ones, their personal name precedes, &#x2018;is their name,&#x2019; such as &#x2018;Naval is his name,&#x2019; &#x2018;Sheva ben Bichri is his name,&#x2019; and so forth. Yet with the <italic>tsaddikim</italic>, &#x2018;their name is&#x2019; precedes their personal name, such as &#x2018;his name is Menoach,&#x2019; &#x2018;his name is Kish,&#x2019; &#x2018;his name is Mordechai.&#x2019; This is because they resemble their Creator, of whom it was said, &#x2018;and My name YHVH I did not make known to them&#x2019; (<italic>Shemot</italic>, 6:3).&#x201D; Concerning how it is said here, at the song at the sea, &#x201C;God is His name,&#x201D; for we find that with <italic>tsaddikim</italic>, &#x201C;the name&#x201D; precedes their personal name, because they control their hearts, their hearts are in their possession. The expression &#x201C;his name&#x201D; teaches of will, for even <italic>shmo</italic>, &#x201C;his name,&#x201D; is numerically equivalent to &#x201C;<italic>ratson</italic>,&#x201D; &#x201C;will&#x201D; (both equal 346) as is mentioned in the Midrash (<italic>Bereshit</italic> Rabba, 34:11). The <italic>tsaddikim</italic> control their wills in a way that what comes into their minds, they will consider, and if they deem it improper they will not do it. With evil ones it is the opposite, for they are the possession of their hearts.</p>
<p>As it is written in the Midrash (<italic>Yalkut B&#x2019;shalach</italic> 241 in the name of the Midrash Avchir), &#x201C;the angel of Egypt came to recommend that the blessed God be merciful with them, so the angel Gavriel came with a brick, placed it before the Holy One, blessed be He, and said, &#x2018;with this Egypt has subjected Israel to slave labor.&#x2019; &#x201D; So with all of Egypt&#x2019;s sins and wickedness, there was still a little room to teach of their merits, for their hearts also had a small inclination toward good. Therefore it is proper for the blessed God to be merciful with them and see to their welfare (the argument of the angel of Egypt). But when Gavriel came and showed them the brick,<sup><xref rid="fn90">22</xref></sup> meaning that if they enslaved Israel with such a level of wickedness then there could not be any tendency to good in their hearts whatsoever. Therefore the blessed God said, &#x201C;God is His name,&#x201D; meaning that He will deal with them measure for measure, for just as they had no control over their hearts, so too God will not change His will from the attribute of stern justice, and this is &#x201C;God is His name.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Who is like You among the powers [</italic>eileem<italic>] Hashem? Who is like You, glorious [</italic>ne&#x2019;edar<italic>] in holiness &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 15:11)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Who is like You among the powers,&#x201D; meaning that in His blessed essence He is hidden from the eye of all life, and no one can apprehend Him, as it is explained in the Gemara (<italic>Gittin</italic>, 56b), &#x201C;who is like You among the speechless.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn91">23</xref></sup> &#x201C;Glorious in holiness,&#x201D; meaning openly revealed, for in everything it is greatly recognized that it has a Creator, for all created beings will show evidence that there is a Creator, for on every thing encountered it comes to the heart of all who seek God to ask, &#x201C;who created these?&#x201D; This is the meaning of the phrase in the liturgical poem, &#x201C;<italic>ha&#x2019;ederet ve&#x2019;ha&#x2019;emuna</italic>,&#x201D; &#x201C;the glory and the faith, to the Life of all worlds [God].&#x201D; &#x201C;Glorious&#x201D; means revealed and &#x201C;faith&#x201D; means hidden and concealed. Something that is not hidden needs no faith, only something that is concealed requires faith, and this is because in the view of man all that is openly revealed is that a great wonder created all of these. These two aspects, meaning the hidden and the revealed, are united only in the blessed God.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Moshe had Israel travel from the Red Sea &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 15:22)</p>
<p>When Moshe Rabeynu saw that Miriam the Prophetess had sung the song, then he knew that it was time to move on from their place. Thus it is with the blessed God at a time when He effuses a renewal of the words of Torah to Israel, first He effuses to the hearts of the leaders and <italic>tsaddikim</italic> among them. Then afterward the matter extends until it reaches the hearts of all of Israel, until the smallest of the small, until this holiness (from now on, <italic>Kedusha</italic>) comes to the hearts of the women. Then the renewal is completed, meaning that it has been installed in the hearts of Israel, and then it is necessary for a new renewal of the words of Torah. Thus it was with the song at the sea, first in the mouth of Moshe, and then in the mouths of all Israel, and when it was said, &#x201C;and Miriam sang for them,&#x201D; then it followed immediately, &#x201C;and Moshe had Israel travel.&#x201D; Meaning that from now on you need not occupy yourselves with this matter, for you have already finished what was needed, and now we need to renew the words of Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn92">24</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and they went three days into the desert and did not find water.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 15:22)</p>
<p>After the great event they experienced at the Red Sea, and the great understanding received with the revelation of the <italic>Shechina</italic> (Divine Presence) as is explained (Mechilta <italic>B&#x2019;Shalach</italic>, 3), &#x201C;a maidservant saw at the splitting of the Red Sea more than the prophets,&#x201D; then they went on for three days without having effused to them any renewal of Torah. This is the meaning of &#x201C;they did not find water,&#x201D; that they did not find the longing and the desire [for Torah], and their spirits fell greatly from this. What follows is &#x201C;and God showed them a branch,&#x201D; which the Aramaic translation renders &#x201C;He taught them advice.&#x201D; The advice was that even this absence of the renewal of Torah (this &#x201C;dry period&#x201D;) is also filled with light and goodness from the blessed God since this is His blessed will, so it is also goodness of great depth.</p>
<p>In this it say in the Midrash (Tanchuma, <italic>B&#x2019;Shalach</italic>, 24), &#x201C;He made sweet the bitter,&#x201D; and with this intention he gave them there at (the place they named) &#x201C;Mara&#x201D; (bitter) the laws of Shabbat, the Red Heifer, and the Justice System. &#x201C;Shabbat&#x201D; means that they saw the blessed God gave them a way to serve Him even with the absence of action, so there is no reason to complain. &#x201C;Red Heifer&#x201D; teaches of the future, for in the future, &#x201C;He will be one and His name one,&#x201D; and then the service will be discontinued and there will be no anger. &#x201C;The Justice System&#x201D; teaches of order, for then they will not think to press the hour in order to merit all this goodness, for this must all be in an order so it can be fixed in the heart without any change.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And He said, if you will surely hearken to the voice of Hashem your God, and do what is Honest in His sight, and diligently adhere to His voice, and guard His laws, then I will not put on you any of the diseases I put upon Egypt, for I am God, who heals you.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 15:26)</p>
<p>It is written in the Holy Zohar (<italic>Parshat B&#x2019;Shalach Shemot</italic>, 60b), &#x201C;If you will surely hearken,&#x2019; this is the &#x2018;Knesset Yisrael,&#x2019; the community of all Israel [the <italic>Shechina</italic>]. &#x2018;And do what is honest in His eyes,&#x2019; this is <italic>tsaddik</italic> [the righteous]. &#x2018;And diligently adhere to His voice,&#x2019; this is, &#x2018;Netsach,&#x2019; the <italic>sefira</italic> of eternity or victory. &#x2018;And guard His laws,&#x2019; this is, &#x2018;Hod,&#x2019; the <italic>sefirah</italic> of majesty or splendor.&#x201D; [A little further the Zohar continues,] &#x201C;corresponding these four there is a safeguarding for the holy, &#x2018;<italic>roshem</italic>,&#x2019; residue or aftereffect. Safeguarding Knesset Yisrael is done by keeping the laws of <italic>nidda</italic>, family purity. Safeguarding of the <italic>tsaddik</italic> is done by keeping guard from the &#x2018;<italic>maidservant</italic>&#x2019; (adulterous relations). Safeguarding of Netsach is done by keeping guard from the daughter of the Gentile. Safeguarding of Hod is keeping guard against the harlot.&#x201D; The explanation: &#x201C;Keeping guard from the daughter of the Gentile&#x201D; means from that which has no portion at all in Israel. &#x201C;The Harlot&#x201D; is that which has a portion in Israel but it belongs to another and not to you. &#x201C;Nidda&#x201D; means that it belongs to you but its time has not yet come. &#x201C;The Maidservant&#x201D; means nonsense and things that are unnecessary, and (refraining from this) guards the <italic>tsaddik</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn93">25</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And He said, if you will surely hearken to the voice of Hashem your God.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 15:26)</p>
<p>Meaning that you will be willing to hear His voice, and this is the fulfillment of the <italic>mitzvot</italic>. &#x201C;And that which is honest in His eyes you will do&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;honest&#x201D; means that you will do His commandments with love and affection, and you will understand to have in mind the awesome depth of His blessed consciousness to do more than He has commanded you. Thus the honesty of your heart has instructed you, for that is honest in the eyes of the blessed God. For example, to go beyond what is required to adorn the mitzvah up to a third more than was commanded. &#x201C;And diligently adhere to His voice, and keep all His laws&#x201D; teaches of alacrity, to fulfill them immediately, and &#x201C;laws&#x201D; [<italic>choq</italic>] teaches of that which exceeds the capacity of the intellect, and then &#x201C;for I am God who heals you,&#x201D; and you will be healed from all.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And they did not listen to Moshe, and some of them left it [the manna] until morning, and it bred worms, and became repulsive.&#x201D;</italic>(Shemot, 16:20)</p>
<p>The matter that the manna &#x201C;bred worms and became repulsive&#x201D; teaches that they had unwarranted and repulsive humility, for even though they knew that the blessed God would not abandon them, yet still they worried that manna would descend to all of Israel but not to them. This is repulsive humility, for no one should see himself as worse than all the rest of Israel.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Amalek came and made war with Israel in Rephidim.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 17:8)</p>
<p>The matter of the sin at Rephidim was that they desired an elevated status, yet at that time it was not possible to come to any elevated status against Moshe, for &#x201C;of what use is a candle against the bright sky?&#x201D; [<italic>Hullin</italic>, 60b] This was the situation with the quarrel Israel where it is said &#x201C;that they tested God saying, is God among us?&#x201D; and the result of this sin was the war with Amalek, for Amalek senses whenever Israel misses the target even to a hair&#x2019;s breadth. This is why Yitro came at this time (to fix this), as it say in the Midrash (<italic>Shemot</italic> Rabba, 27:3), &#x201C;Smite a scorner, and the simple will become prudent. &#x2018;The simple will become prudent,&#x2019; this is Yitro,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn94">26</xref></sup> for he gave the advice that even in the time of Moshe Rabeynu to give elevation in status, in saying &#x201C;to make princes over thousands,&#x201D; etc. Then the great among them will be raised over the small, until Moshe Rabeynu.</p>

This is, &#x201C;as he said [<italic>amar</italic>],&#x201D; vocalized with a <italic>kamatz</italic>, for Yitro also said things to himself, and he himself did not understand the values of their preciousness.<sup><xref rid="fn96">28</xref></sup></p>

<p><italic>Segula</italic> means a treasury and vessel of reception for all the hidden things of the kings. Thus the blessed God said to Israel that He would make them into a vessel of reception in order to place in them all the goodness and blessings that He has, and that they could receive them. In this way did the Holy Yehudi of Pshiske<sup><xref rid="fn97">29</xref></sup> explain this same verse, that the love of the blessed God for Israel was in the way of <italic>segula</italic>, a beloved treasure, meaning without any discernible reason.<sup><xref rid="fn98">30</xref></sup></p>

<p>It is explained in the tractate <italic>Berachot</italic> (45a), &#x201C;from here we derive that the translator will not raise his voice louder than the one reading the verse from the Torah.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn100">32</xref></sup> &#x201C;God answered him in a voice,&#x201D; was like the translator reading after him at the same volume. This would seem quite unusual, and the sages of the Tosafot and R. Itschak Alfasi (the &#x201C;Rif&#x201D;) proposed that the opposite would seem to be understood from the verse.<sup><xref rid="fn101">33</xref></sup> While Moshe indeed spoke the Ten Commandments to Israel, the root of the matter was that the words of Torah were then fixed into the hearts of Israel. This was done by the blessed God, who imprinted into the heart of each one according to His blessed will. In this way the blessed God is called, as it were, the translator, meaning that after the Ten Commandments went forth from the mouth of Moshe to Israel, the Holy One, blessed be He, went back and imprinted them into their hearts. This is &#x201C;the translator will not raise his voice more than the reader,&#x201D; for truly it was in the power of the Holy One, blessed be He, to carve the words of Torah into their hearts according to His blessed power, much more than Moshe Rabeynu could. However, it is written, &#x201C;no more would a prophet as great as Moshe arise in Israel,&#x201D; and it is that He not illuminate into any soul in Israel more than he did with Moshe Rabeynu (and would never again). So this is the meaning of &#x201C;the translator will not raise his voice more than the reader,&#x201D; meaning more than the level of Moshe Rabeynu.<sup><xref rid="fn102">34</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Anochi Hashem E-loheicha&#x2014;I am Hashem your God &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 20:2)</p>
<p>The word <italic>Ani</italic> is not used for &#x201C;I&#x201D; (but rather, <italic>Anochi</italic>). Had it been written &#x201C;<italic>Ani</italic>,&#x201D; the meaning would have been that the Holy One, blessed be He, had revealed His light to Israel in all its completeness, and then they could not have reached deeply into His words, for He would have already revealed everything. However the additional letter <italic>Caf</italic> in &#x201C;<italic>Anochi</italic>,&#x201D; teaches that it is not in a state of completeness, yet rather an imagined image of the light that the Holy One, blessed be He, would reveal in the future.<sup><xref rid="fn103">35</xref></sup> The more a man apprehends in the depths of the Torah, the more he will then understand that until now he was in darkness. This is hinted at in the night and the day. &#x201C;Day&#x201D; means that the blessed God opens the gates of wisdom for man, and &#x201C;night&#x201D; means that man should not imagine that he has apprehended all in completeness, for all he has attained is like night in comparison to the day that follows. So it goes on forever, and it follows that all is night in the face of the light that the Holy One, blessed be He, will open in the future.</p>
<p>This is why the verse that follows immediately is, &#x201C;do not make any graven [carved] image,&#x201D; on which it is said in the Holy Zohar (<italic>Shemot</italic>, 87b), &#x201C;since it was first written, &#x2018;carve for yourself [two tablets],&#x2019; therefore it says, &#x2018;do not make any carved image,&#x2019; meaning do not make another torah.&#x201D; The word <italic>pesel</italic>, &#x201C;carved image,&#x201D; means something with definite form and measurement, in a state of completeness with nothing lacking, and this only exists in the Torah of Moshe Rabeynu. However for the mortal intellect to fashion something in complete perfection like this is impossible.</p>
<p>On this it is written (Ruth Rabba, 3:2), &#x201C;Caesar said to Rabi Yehoshua ben Hanina, &#x2018;I too can make a Torah like Moshe,&#x2019; and he decreed that no fire be kindled for three days. During this time he saw smoke rising from a house, and they explained to Caesar that a certain government minister was sick and it was necessary to permit him fire.&#x201D; For indeed, according to our Holy Torah the law is that saving a life supersedes the laws of Shabbat, yet the difference (with us and the example of Caesar) is that one who violates Shabbat to save a life is not going against the Holy Torah, for thus was it also commanded that saving a life takes precedence over the laws of Shabbat. So, too, in all places where it is, &#x201C;a time to do for God,&#x201D; (Tehillim, 119:126) in that very place is also hinted, &#x201C;for they have made void Your law.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn104">36</xref></sup> Therefore the Torah includes all the possible combinations of events that may occur, and its light surrounds all the possibilities and all the experiences that may evolve, and this is not in the power of any man to do this. This is the explanation of the Holy Zohar on &#x201C;do not make any carved form,&#x201D; meaning positive commandments, and &#x201C;any image,&#x201D; the prohibitive commandments, for nothing is revealed to man until it reaches its completion.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;I am Hashem your God &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 20:2)</p>
<p>It is written in the Holy Zohar, &#x201C;and the tree of life is in the secret of five, five,&#x201D; and this is also the matter here. &#x201C;Anochi, I,&#x201D; is the source of life. &#x201C;Hashem&#x201D; is <italic>Gevurah</italic>&#x2014;strength, which brings all into being. &#x201C;<italic>E-loheicha</italic>, Your God&#x201D; means the measure of truth in which the blessed God runs His world. &#x201C;Who brought you out of the land of Egypt&#x201D; means that even at a time when you experience anguish, God forbid, still refrain from becoming angry at the blessed God. &#x201C;From the house of bondage&#x201D; means do not become immersed in niceties, and after this is warned not to imagine that these things that I have told you can easily be done, yet rather they require great efforts of purification. Each of these five corresponds to one of the next five. &#x201C;You shall not have&#x201D; corresponds to &#x201C;Anochi,&#x201D; so as not to think that there is a hue (surface appearance) of life, God forbid, aside from Him.<sup><xref rid="fn105">37</xref></sup> &#x201C;Other gods,&#x201D; meaning a hue of <italic>Gevurah</italic>&#x2014;strength.<sup><xref rid="fn106">38</xref></sup> &#x201C;Before Me&#x201D; corresponds to &#x201C;your God,&#x201D; meaning a hue of truth that is only superficial, and not part of truth at its deepest level.<sup><xref rid="fn107">39</xref></sup> &#x201C;Do not make any sculpted idol or image&#x201D; corresponds to &#x201C;who brought you out of the land of Egypt.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn108">40</xref></sup> &#x201C;From the house of bondage&#x201D; corresponds to &#x201C;which is in the heavens above,&#x201D; etc.</p>
<p>The heavens, earth, and the seas are the principal forms in the construction of the world, and the world also contains desire and honor. Jealousy is also included in these two, as it is for these that He is jealous, and they are also the five corresponding to five mentioned above. &#x201C;Do not bow down to them&#x201D; means do not be subdued under them (desire and honor). &#x201C;Do not serve them&#x201D; means do not desire to rule over them. Existence is divided into three levels&#x2014;place, time, and soul. Everything discussed thus far has been in the category of place. Corresponding to time, there is also the secret of &#x201C;five, five.&#x201D; Pesach is &#x201C;Anochi&#x2014;I.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn109">41</xref></sup> Shevuot is &#x201C;Hashem.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn110">42</xref></sup> Succot corresponds to &#x201C;Elo-heicha, your God.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn111">43</xref></sup> Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur correspond to &#x201C;E-l Kana, a jealous God,&#x201D; for the name &#x201C;E-l&#x201D; teaches of <italic>Chochma</italic> (wisdom) and &#x201C;jealous,&#x201D; meaning anger, that is to say that His anger is in (the <italic>sefirah</italic> of) <italic>Chochma</italic>. In the category of soul, meaning person, there is also the secret of five, namely, &#x201C;the fathers, the children, the third, the fourth [generations], and the thousandth [generation]&#x201D; (<italic>Shemot</italic>, 20:5). Thus, all in the secret of &#x201C;five, five,&#x201D; and understand it, for it is a deep matter.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;I am Hashem your God &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 20:2)</p>
<p>There are five faculties in human existence; imagination, thought, will, action, and speech. If the action (the effect in the world) is a result of these stages, beginning in the imagination,<sup><xref rid="fn112">44</xref></sup> descending afterward to thought, and then to will, then he may be sure that this action came from the will of the blessed God, having flowed from the source of life. However, if the action came about by a different order, where first the will came to the heart, afterward descending to thought, then this action is in need of refinement, for perhaps the initial sprouting of this will was tainted by worldly desires. Corresponding to these five faculties were given the Ten Commandments, in order to refine these five stages.</p>
<p>For the Ten Commandments are also divided into five against five&#x2014;five positive commandments in opposition to five prohibitions. &#x201C;Anochi&#x2014;I am Hashem&#x201D; corresponds to the imagination (subconscious urge), for as long as the matter is in the state of the subconscious, it is not yet in the form of clear knowledge. This is like one who has the vague desire to do something yet does not yet know what it is, or the way small children, not yet possessing honed intellects, experience urges. It is also as when one sleeps, when his imagination is active on the level of the subconscious, yet without any recognition or discursive apprehension.</p>
<p>All of this corresponds to the first commandment, &#x201C;Anochi,&#x201D; in the realm of positive commandments, for the Divine utterance &#x201C;Anochi&#x201D; includes within it all the positive commandments of the Torah, with the will of God dwelling within them. With the prohibitive commandments, where all are in order &#x201C;to turn from evil,&#x201D; a man may apprehend them in his intellect, yet with positive commandments, which are the very locality of the blessed God, it is not conceivable that man may have any understanding of them. After that it is said, &#x201C;you shall not have any other gods,&#x201D; meaning that you are not to think that there is another Source of Being<sup><xref rid="fn113">45</xref></sup> in the world, God forbid, besides Me, and this corresponds to the faculty of thought. &#x201C;Do not take God&#x2019;s name in vain&#x201D; means not to discard anything in the world as unnecessary or useless.</p>
<p>Everything that the blessed God created has a spark of <italic>Kedusha</italic> (holiness) within it, only it has an internal and an external nature, and you need to know how to separate the good from the bad. This verse also corresponds to thought, for there are two verses, one corresponding to a positive commandment of thought, and another corresponding to a prohibition of thought. &#x201C;Remember the Shabbat&#x201D; and &#x201C;Honor your father&#x201D; correspond to the faculty of action. &#x201C;Do not kill&#x201D; and &#x201C;do not commit adultery&#x201D; correspond to will. The reason the commandments signifying action precede the commandments signifying will is that if one sins with an action, God forbid, he will go back and ponder it, and find some thought to hold responsible for it, meaning in the very source of his life. So then he must &#x201C;do <italic>tshuva</italic>&#x201D; [return to the way of God] in this regard, sincerely mending his ways and healing his roots, and not to find fault in the will, for the will could have been entered into him from the outside. &#x201C;Do not steal&#x201D; and &#x201C;do not bear false witness&#x201D; correspond to speech. This is because the entire need for speech is only in order to communicate with others, as the individual by himself has no need of speech. The Torah exists in all the worlds, so above this world &#x201C;do not steal&#x201D; means not to prevent words of Torah from reaching one&#x2019;s students (<italic>Sanhedrin</italic>, 91b). This applies even to angels, as it is said of them, &#x201C;and they receive one from the other.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn114">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>For there are also different levels among the angels, and an angel on a higher level will have greater strength that one on a lower level. Yet the one on the lower level has a greater sense of fear (reverence for the greater strength), therefore &#x201C;they receive one from the other.&#x201D; &#x201C;Do not bear false witness&#x201D; is the opposite of &#x201C;do not steal,&#x201D; for it is to speak too much; and therefore these two correspond to the positive and negative commandments of the faculty of speech. &#x201C;Do not covet&#x201D; corresponds the prohibition in the faculty of the subconscious imagination, and belongs with &#x201C;Anochi&#x201D;; yet if one could achieve perfect refinement in the faculty of the subconscious, he would have no need of refinement in the other faculties. Therefore the prohibition in the faculty of the subconscious could not be written together with &#x201C;Anochi,&#x201D; but rather only after thought, will, action, and speech have been refined, then the subconscious imagination would emerge refined; so therefore it was written at the end.</p>
<p>The verse &#x201C;Anochi&#x2014;I am Hashem your God&#x201D; contains all the letters of the Hebrew alphabet except <italic>Gimel&#x201D;Zayin</italic> (&#x201C;GeZ&#x201D;), <italic>Chet&#x201D;Tet</italic> (&#x201C;CheT&#x201D;), and <italic>Samech&#x201D;Peh&#x201D;Koof</italic> (&#x201C;SaPheK&#x201D;). &#x201C;GeZ&#x201D; teaches of the beginning of one&#x2019;s acceptance of the yoke of the kingdom of Heaven, such as the convert who, when he comes to observance, must first limit his enjoyment of worldly pleasures and take great care of the details enumerated by the codifiers of the Law. This is &#x201C;GeZ,&#x201D; from the word <italic>geziza</italic>, or shearing away.<sup><xref rid="fn115">47</xref></sup> Afterward comes <italic>CheT</italic>, which means sin, as he must guard himself to keep the <italic>mitzvot</italic> without sinning. Following this is <italic>SaPheK</italic>, meaning uncertainty, which means that he must fear what may be hidden in his heart.<sup><xref rid="fn116">48</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Remember the day of Shabbat and sanctify it &#x2026; and the seventh day is Shabbat unto Hashem your God.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 20:8&#x2013;10)</p>
<p>Concerning why it says &#x201C;Shabbat,&#x201D; here twice, for all of the 613 commandments are called &#x201C;Shabbat,&#x201D; as it says in the Holy Zohar (<italic>Shemot</italic>, 88b), &#x201C;What is Shabbat? A name of the Holy One, blessed be He.&#x201D; This represents the time when the desire comes to man to do the will of God, doing that which He commanded, and refraining from that which He commanded not to do. When he takes this to his heart, this is as it says, &#x201C;remember the day of Shabbat [meaning all God has commanded us].&#x201D; Afterward, when man forgets, and did an action while the will of the blessed God is hidden from him, it is said, &#x201C;six days shall you work &#x2026; and the seventh day,&#x201D; etc. Thus, at time when he has become far from Shabbat, and, God forbid, forgets God, the day of Shabbat still comes again, and he returns, placing his heart on that which he has done. By means of this a great cry erupts from his heart, saying, &#x201C;what have I done?&#x201D; For a man cannot uphold the Torah unless he has failed in it (<italic>Gittin</italic>, 53a). Then the blessed God gives him advice, which are the offerings that make atonement, so this is why it says directly after, &#x201C;honor your father and mother.&#x201D; This means not to blame your own faults on the fact of your birth, deeming yourself clean and exempt from offering sacrifices that will atone for you. This is &#x201C;honor your father and mother.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;You shall not make with Me gods of silver or gods of gold &#x2026; an altar of earth you shall make for Me &#x2026; in any place that I mention My name I shall come to you and bless you.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 20:20)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Gods of silver,&#x201D; meaning an external hue of love and fervor more than is appropriate for your position, for there is no associate with the One in heaven, and the blessed God only shows his love for man when the truth is with him. &#x201C;Gods of gold,&#x201D; meaning an external hue of fear greater than is befitting your position. Only, &#x201C;an altar of earth you shall make for Me.&#x201D; Here, &#x201C;earth&#x201D; means simplicity, just as it exists in your heart. In the verse, &#x201C;In any place that I mention My name,&#x201D; the word &#x201C;mention&#x201D; comes from the term for clarification, <italic>birrur</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn117">49</xref></sup> In every place where I make it clear that the point of origin in your heart was for the sake of heaven, then I will immediately send you the blessing, &#x201C;and bless you.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;You shall not ascend by steps on My altar, in order not to uncover your nakedness on it.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 20:23)</p>
<p>All the hearts of Israel are called &#x201C;My altar,&#x201D; and this is &#x201C;do not ascend,&#x201D; meaning not to boast in your own soul over any soul of Israel. This is as it says, &#x201C;in order not to uncover your nakedness,&#x201D; meaning so as not to come to shame by means of this, for if you pride yourself over anyone else, in the end you will descend below and he will go up into your place. This it says in the Gemara (<italic>Megillah</italic>, 16b), &#x201C;of Mordechai who was first numbered fifth, and later sixth.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn118">50</xref></sup></p>

<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And these are the laws that you shall place before them &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 21:1)</p>
<p>Here it is not said, &#x201C;And God spoke to Moshe saying,&#x201D; as with all the commandments, for the matter here discusses civil legal enactments (&#x201C;<italic>mishpatim</italic>&#x201D;), and concerning justice there is no difference between the great and the small. This may be compared to when the king goes out to inspect and judge his soldiers; then they all stand in the same line, even their senior officer standing in the line. Thus it is written (Yesahya, 56:1), &#x201C;keep justice, and perform <italic>tsedaka</italic> [righteousness], for My salvation is close at hand.&#x201D; &#x201C;Keep&#x201D; is an expression of restraint, saying that no soul of Israel should voice angry complaints against the blessed God concerning His attributes (where He is concealed from us). He should refrain from asking why He does not help him to serve Him, especially as this is what He desires, so why does the blessed God not help him immediately?</p>
<p>Therefore it is said, &#x201C;keep justice and perform <italic>tsedaka</italic>,&#x201D; meaning to cleave to the blessed God with righteousness and honesty of heart, without angry complaints. This being done, &#x201C;My salvation is close at hand,&#x201D; meaning that the blessed God will reveal to us the order with which he conducts our lives in the exile. Then He will send consolation, making it clear that none of the longing and suffering that Israel underwent in the service of the blessed God was in vain. On this it is said in the holy Zohar (<italic>Shemot</italic>, 150b), &#x201C;even a man&#x2019;s good intention will not be lost,&#x201D; for with every action man does, even if it seems now to be insignificant, in the future the blessed God will expand upon it greatly.</p>
<p>In this week&#x2019;s <italic>Parsha</italic>, the blessed God teaches us how one must clean and refine himself, to the extent that his attribute of goodness is even drawn into his possessions, and then good attributes will be found in them so as not to cause damage to anyone else. Therefore, when a man&#x2019;s possessions cause damage, he must pay for the damages, for the damage was done because his soul was not refined enough. Thus his possessions could cause damage, or he could steal from another, for if his soul was in a state of true refinement then his possessions could never do damage to another.</p>
<p>So it was told in the Gemara (<italic>Ta&#x2019;anit</italic>, 25a), &#x201C;the neighbors of R. Channina ben Dosa complained that his goat was causing them damages. He said, &#x2018;if it is so, then let them be eaten by bears.&#x2019; The goats went into the forest, and returned each with a bear on its horns.&#x201D; Furthermore, it is said in <italic>Berachot</italic> (16b), &#x201C;Manservant and maidservants are not addressed as &#x2018;father so-and-so&#x2019; or &#x2018;mother so-and-so&#x2019; [a title of honor] except for the servants of the house of Rabban Gamliel, who were called so because of their importance.&#x201D; This means that the power of the <italic>Kedusha</italic> of Rabban Gamliel extended even to his possessions, and they too were good (his goodness extended into them).</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; that you shall place before them &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 21:1)</p>
<p>Rashi explains, &#x201C;before them [Israel] and not before the idolaters, and even if you know that one of their judgments is the same as the judgments of Israel, do not bring it into their courts. One who brings the judgments of Israel before the heathens profanes the name of God, and gives honor to idolatry to praise it, as it is written [<italic>Devarim</italic>, 32:31], &#x2018;for their Rock is not our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.&#x2019; This means, when our enemies are judges it is testimony to the superiority of their idol.&#x201D; The matter is thus: Every man is cut from the same material, and the form of the limbs and organs is the same for everyone, yet however, the form of the Israelite is recognized and refined among all the nations. This matter defies logic, for if a thousand Gentiles stand with one Israelite among them, the form of the Israelite will be recognized, and this is a wonder in the eyes of all the whole world. This is because, &#x201C;their Rock is not like our Rock,&#x201D; even though with the Israelites, all their organs and the forms of their faces are exactly the same as the rest of the world, yet still, all who see them will recognize that this is the seed that God has blessed. &#x201C;And our enemies themselves being judges&#x201D; means that it is exactly the same in the realm of justice, for even if their judgments are exactly like those of Israel, nonetheless, if an Israelite goes to their courts he is profaning the name of God, for it has no likeness to the justice of Israel at the depths. On this it is written in the Tehillim (147:19), &#x201C;He speaks His word to Yaakov, His statutes and judgments to Israel. He does not do this with any nation, and as for His judgments, they have not known them.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And [if a man] did not lie in wait [he did not lie in ambush for him, but killed him unintentionally. Rashi] but E-lohim caused it to come to be, then I will appoint you a place to where he may flee.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 21:13)</p>
<p>Rashi explains, &#x201C;Concerning what does the Torah speak? Of two men, one killed inadvertently, and the other killed intentionally, and there were no witnesses to testify concerning the affair. Therefore the latter was not put to death, and the former was not exiled. The Holy One, blessed be He, brings them to the same inn, and the one who killed intentionally sits under a ladder; while the one who killed inadvertently ascends the ladder, falls, and kills the one who killed intentionally. Witnesses testify to this, and [the court] requires him to be exiled. So in the end, the one who killed inadvertently was exiled, and the one who killed intentionally was killed.&#x201D; The famous question is, how did the one who inadvertently killed first come to do this? It seems that it may be explained through the verse (Tehillim, 145:14), &#x201C;God supports all those who fall, and straightens all those who are bent down.&#x201D; Two things are mentioned in this verse&#x2014;fallen, and bent down.</p>
<p>This means, with one who has anger and evil lusts rooted in his heart, if God forbid he brings his potential into action, it is called &#x201C;fallen.&#x201D; If it still has not been brought forth into action, he is called &#x201C;bent down,&#x201D; meaning that his heart is bent and enslaved to this evil lust. The blessed God is the One whose thoughts are to never banish anything completely. Therefore it says, &#x201C;but E-lohim caused it to be,&#x201D; for with the one who killed inadvertently, it is not to say that he has already actually killed; rather that he has a deficiency in his heart, namely anger and desire to murder. With the one who killed intentionally, it means that he has already brought it into action and committed murder.</p>
<p>So the Holy One, blessed be He, completes both of them. The one who killed intentionally is killed, and the one who killed inadvertently is exiled. This is, &#x201C;but E-lohim caused it to be,&#x201D; meaning that the Holy One, blessed be He, did it for his benefit. All the while that the evil thought had not come into action it would not occur to his heart to repent. Yet now that the Holy One, blessed be He, has brought it about that he actually has killed someone inadvertently, and the one who was killed had anyhow deserved the death penalty, he began to become greatly agitated in his soul, asking himself, &#x201C;why did it come about that I killed inadvertently? Certainly I must have a root of murder in my heart.&#x201D; (Questions that he would otherwise not have asked.) By means of this he repents.</p>

<p>In <italic>Parshat Yitro</italic>, when the Shabbat is discussed, the opposite order is written; &#x201C;remember the day of Shabbat to keep it holy,&#x201D; and then afterward, &#x201C;six days shall you work,&#x201D; etc. This may be understood through what is written in the Gemara (<italic>Shabbat</italic>, 69b), &#x201C;if one is wandering in the desert, and does not know when the day of Shabbat is, Hiya bar Rav says, he shall keep one day of Shabbat, and then count six. Rav Huna says, he shall first count six days, and then keep one day of Shabbat.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In order to understand these two different approaches, consider the verse (Mishlei, 4:8), &#x201C;Laud her, and she shall exult you, she shall honor you when you embrace her.&#x201D; This means, laud something if it strengthens the desires of your heart and your involvement in the words of Torah. For instance, if you have a strong desire to eat and drink and the like, examine it and if, God forbid, it causes you to go against the will of God then refrain from it.</p>
<p>Then through this very examination, &#x201C;and she shall exult you,&#x201D; then the very words of Torah will raise you over all your lusts. &#x201C;Honor her when you embrace her,&#x201D; for &#x201C;when you embrace her&#x201D; means that if you increase how much you take counsel in the words of Torah each time more; then also, &#x201C;she shall honor you&#x201D; greatly in the eyes of all around you. Shabbat represents the acceptance of the yoke of the Torah, and a young Torah scholar who has not yet completed the purification of his heart is called &#x201C;<italic>Hiya bar Rav</italic>,&#x201D; who said to keep one day of Shabbat first. This means that one whose heart is not yet purified should not pray that the blessed God give him anything of the good in this world (&#x201C;counting six days&#x201D;), but should rather deliver over all his desires to Him (&#x201C;starting with Shabbat&#x201D;), and the blessed God will be the one who begins and finishes. &#x201C;<italic>Rav Huna</italic>&#x201D; represents an elder Torah scholar, for the name &#x201C;<italic>Huna</italic>&#x201D; is related to &#x201C;<italic>Hon</italic>&#x201D; or wealth; that is to say, he has found wealth in a large following of students, and his heart has been purified, containing no foreign desires.</p>
<p>Therefore it says that he shall first count six days, meaning that it is permitted for him to ask the blessed God to fulfill all the wishes of his heart, for the six days teach of the power of the actions of man. &#x201C;Then keep one day of Shabbat&#x201D; means that the blessed God will then complete matters for him, in the sense of (Iyov, 22:28), &#x201C;you shall decree the matter, and it will be established for you.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;You shall bring the first of the first fruits of your land to the house of Hashem your God; you shall not cook a kid in its mother&#x2019;s milk.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 23:19)</p>
<p>This commandment teaches of the attribute of restraint, which is called in the Midrash, &#x201C;valiant ones of power that can hold back their lust,&#x201D; and it is written (Yeshiyahu, 28:4), &#x201C;like an early fruit before summer, that as soon one sees it, it is yet swallowed up in his hand.&#x201D; The Torah teaches to have restraint and not to eat it, but rather to bring it to the <italic>Cohen</italic>. &#x201C;You shall not cook a kid in its mother&#x2019;s milk&#x201D; teaches of the opposite of this, of doing something quickly, as it is written in the Gemara (<italic>Succa</italic>, 14b), &#x201C;[a <italic>succa</italic> with a hole in its wall large enough] for a kid to leap into it at once.&#x201D; The Torah teaches that in a place that requires alacrity, do not hold back. This is, &#x201C;do not cook,&#x201D; meaning do nothing to prevent it being done quickly. &#x201C;Milk&#x201D; teaches of restraint, for something done with restraint is called constant, for it is always good to act in this way; yet sometimes a man needs to act quickly, as explained on the verse, &#x201C;a horse ready for the day of war.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn119">51</xref></sup> Then this attribute is much more praiseworthy than the attribute of a settled mind, which is called &#x201C;constant.&#x201D; Thus the attribute of quickness of action is called <italic>mekudash</italic>, &#x201C;sanctified.&#x201D; The Gemara discusses this, asking (<italic>Zevachim</italic>, 90b), &#x201C;constant or sanctified, which is preferable?&#x201D; and we find in the Gemara of <italic>Berachot</italic> (20a) &#x201C;the <italic>Rishonim</italic> [early sages] gave over their lives for the sanctification of God&#x2019;s name,&#x201D; etc. This means that they acted with the attribute of quickness of action, a highly precious quality in its time. Thus a man must leave the realm of restraint, and because of this attribute (quickness) a miracle will be performed for him.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And you shall serve Hashem your God, and He will bless your bread and water, and I will remove all sickness from among you.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 23:25)</p>
<p>This verse begins in the plural voice, and ends in the singular. This is understood according to what has already been explained in <italic>Parshat Vayeira</italic> on the verse, &#x201C;and now I know that you fear E-lohim,&#x201D; (page 25) concerning the difference between the fear of Hashem and the fear of E-lohim. The fear of E-lohim concerns a time when one must constrict himself in an area because of his own deficiency, as his heart is not yet refined. The fear of Hashem teaches that one must limit himself because of the entire community of Israel, even though he himself does not have a deficiency in this area.</p>
<p>Therefore, &#x201C;and you shall serve&#x201D; is voiced in the plural, for you must suffer constriction for the sake of the entire community of Israel. By means of this, &#x201C;and He will bless your bread and water,&#x201D; each one in particular. This is what we mean when we say the blessing, &#x201C;<italic>baruch she&#x2019;amar</italic>,&#x201D; in the morning service, &#x201C;blessed is He who has mercy on the land,&#x201D; for the &#x201C;land&#x201D; hints at the entire community of Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn120">52</xref></sup> as the blessed God first has compassion for the entire community. Only after (as the order in &#x201C;<italic>baruch she&#x2019;amar</italic>&#x201D; continues), &#x201C;Blessed is He who has compassion on His creation,&#x201D; meaning each one of Israel in particular.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And God said to Moshe, ascend to Me, to the mountain and I will be there &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 24:12)</p>
<p>&#x201C;To the mountain&#x201D; means to the end of the renewal of all levels. A man must first pass through all of the forms of wisdom in the world until he reaches true wisdom. &#x201C;And I will be <italic>there</italic>,&#x201D; teaches of a place of purity and true life, as in (<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 21:17), &#x201C;and they went from <italic>there</italic> to the well.&#x201D; (The well always represents the source of true wisdom.) This shows that all of the forms of wisdom were only stations on the journey, while the main point of your place is the end of all the levels, called <italic>there</italic>.&#x201D;</p>

<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And God spoke to Moshe saying, take for Me an offering [</italic>truma<italic>] &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 25:2)</p>
<p>This is as it is written (Yesahya, 45:1), &#x201C;Thus spoke God &#x2026; who formed the land &#x2026; He did not create a desolation for his creations to dwell in&#x2026;&#x201D; In <italic>Parshat Yitro</italic>, when Israel heard the Ten Commandments, it was easy for them to fulfill them since these <italic>mitzvot</italic> depend on the actions of man. Then after, the <italic>Parsha</italic> of <italic>Mishpatim</italic> (Judgments) was said to them, and taught that it was the will of the blessed God that His <italic>Kedusha</italic> (holiness) and service (of Him) would spread forth to such an extent that even a man&#x2019;s possessions could not do anything against the Torah as explained above in <italic>Parshat Mishpatim</italic> (cf. &#x201C;and these are the judgments&#x201D;). From this, a great crying out burst from the hearts of Israel asking how it could be possible to reach such a level of refinement. Therefore the blessed God gave them the advice in this <italic>Parsha</italic>, &#x201C;take for me an offering [<italic>truma</italic>], gold, and silver, and copper.&#x201D;</p>
<p>On this it says in the holy Zohar (<italic>Shemot</italic>, 148a), that these elements correspond to the basic elements found in man, meaning that he should deliver all his elements and potentialities over to the blessed God, so that He may manage them according to His blessed will. Then of itself his possessions will also contain goodness and will not suffer or cause any damage. On this it is explained in the Zohar (<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 125), &#x201C;The verse, &#x2018;Fortunate is the man who God does not ascribe to him sin, and has not the spirit of deception,&#x2019; (Tehillim, 32:2) means that the spirit of his life does not turn to any side,&#x201D; but is directed only to the will of the blessed God. If a man asks how it is possible to refine his heart to such an extent, on this it is said, &#x201C;He did not create a desolation for His creations to dwell in,&#x201D; meaning that God does not want man&#x2019;s heart to be distraught.</p>
<p>This is also the meaning of (Yesahya, 45:19), &#x201C;I did not say to the seed of Yaakov, seek Me in vain,&#x201D; so therefore the verse says, &#x201C;for his creations to dwell in,&#x201D; meaning that a man should have a settled mind.<sup><xref rid="fn121">53</xref></sup> [And the verse in Yesahya continues], &#x201C;I am God, speaking righteousness, proclaiming fairness [<italic>meisharim</italic>, also even, right], meaning that even though the blessed God desires that man be righteous and clean in all matters, upholding 613 commandments, still He is &#x201C;proclaiming fairness,&#x201D; meaning with honesty and a willingness of heart toward man. Thus He gives man advice as to how to fulfill all the <italic>mitzvot</italic> with ease.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026;. take for Me an offering [</italic>truma<italic>] &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 25:2)</p>
<p>It is written in the Midrash Tanchuma (Truma, 1), &#x201C;Rabbi Yannai said, it is permitted to eat the <italic>truma</italic> offering on the grave of an unlearned <italic>Cohen</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn122">54</xref></sup> All the <italic>Kedusha</italic> of the <italic>truma</italic> offering is drawn into the world by way of the <italic>Cohanim</italic> who eat it in a state of <italic>Kedusha</italic>. If there were no <italic>Cohanim</italic> in the world, then the <italic>truma</italic> would not possess any <italic>Kedusha</italic>. Therefore, with regard to an unlearned <italic>Cohen</italic><sup><xref rid="fn123">55</xref></sup> the <italic>truma</italic> never had any <italic>Kedusha</italic> as far as he was concerned. This is the explanation of the Midrash (Ibid.), &#x201C;take for Me an offering&#x2014;means take to Me, to My name.&#x201D; That is, the entire greatness of the <italic>Kedusha</italic> of <italic>truma</italic> is if it is separated for the sake of Heaven.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; take for Me an offering [</italic>truma<italic>]&#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 25:1)</p>
<p>We can understand this through what has been explained on the verse (Mishlei, 16:24), &#x201C;The way of life for the intelligent is above.&#x201D; This means that principle and foremost is for one to place his heart on the way of life above. That is to say, the life and sustenance that the blessed God gives to all men is above, like something placed on high.<sup><xref rid="fn124">56</xref></sup> So it is with &#x201C;take for Me an offering,&#x201D; meaning that Israel should &#x201C;take&#x201D; the blessed God exulted<sup><xref rid="fn125">57</xref></sup> and first in all matters. This is as it is written in the Gemara <italic>of Sanhedrin</italic> (102b), &#x201C;What part of the bread is taken when the blessing <italic>hamotsi</italic> is recited? From the part that was first baked [the outer crust].&#x201D;</p>
<p>Relate this to what is written in the Gemara of <italic>Berachot</italic> (35a). &#x201C;One verse says, &#x2018;the earth is Hashem&#x2019;s and the fullness thereof,&#x2019; and another verse says, &#x2018;the land was given to mankind.&#x2019; The first verse is before the blessing is recited, and the second verse is after the blessing was recited.&#x201D; The whole matter of a blessing is for one to be conscious that he has a Master and from Him he receives all effluence of sustenance. If you have such a consciousness then you can say &#x201C;Blessed art Thou,&#x201D; in the real presence of the blessed God. On this it is said, &#x201C;and the land was given to mankind.&#x201D; This is also the question, &#x201C;on which part of the bread do you say the blessing <italic>hamotsi</italic>,&#x201D; meaning, where is the deep recognition in this loaf of bread that the blessed God is giving it so you can truly say on it, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou?&#x201D; And the answer is, &#x201C;from the part that was baked first.&#x201D; There are so many stages in the work of our human hands that goes into making the bread; the kneading, arranging, heating the oven, putting it equally in the oven. But the very place where it starts baking is not a result of the power of mankind. Then when one takes this into his heart, asking why it started baking at this particular place, he sees that it has only come about from the will of the blessed God. Thus over this particular part of the bread is it proper to recite the blessing.</p>

<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And you will command the children of Israel &#x2026; take unto yourself pure olive oil &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 27:20)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Unto yourself,&#x201D; meaning to the <italic>Chochma</italic> (wisdom) inherent in every soul of Israel, and all the wisdom of Israel is called in the name of Moshe Rabeynu. To this the blessed God commanded that every one of Israel shall take to the wisdom inside of him some pure olive oil, meaning refined wisdom, and that is that he should not turn to any side that might be tainted. Doing this he will understand who God has chosen, and that is why the verse following immediately after is, &#x201C;bring close Aharon and his sons.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And these are the garments that they shall make, a breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 28:4)</p>
<p>In these garments the blessed God shows Israel which soul He chooses, for the preciousness of the soul of Aharon haCohen is recognized and understood from the garments (made for him). The <italic>Tsits</italic> (&#x201C;headplate&#x201D;) hints that he is constantly cleaving to the blessed God as he is commanded always to wear it on his forehead. Engraved on the <italic>tsits</italic> were the words <italic>Kodesh LeHashem</italic>, &#x201C;Holy unto God,&#x201D; meaning that the words (Divrei haYamim 1, 28:9), &#x201C;Know the God of your father and serve Him,&#x201D; were constantly in the depth of his thought. The breastplate (<italic>Choshen</italic>) hinted that there was no hatred for any soul of Israel in his heart, for the tribes of Israel were engraved on his heart. The <italic>ephod</italic>, with which he would gird himself, hinted at his trust in the blessed God, which always supported him. The robe (<italic>Me&#x2019;il</italic>) teaches of his great fear of God, for it was made entirely of <italic>t&#x2019;chellet</italic> (sky blue), which hints at fear.<sup><xref rid="fn126">58</xref></sup> Why were the pants and the <italic>tsits</italic> not mentioned when the garments are enumerated in verse 4? The pants were not mentioned for they were not considered a garment, only serving to cover his nakedness; in other words, to guard from the lusts of this world. The <italic>tsits</italic> was not mentioned, as it is explained in the Zohar (<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 159), &#x201C;The brilliance [<italic>metscha</italic>, also &#x201C;forehead&#x201D;] of God&#x2019;s desire is revealed at the <italic>Mincha</italic> [afternoon] Prayer of Shabbat.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn127">59</xref></sup> The <italic>tsits</italic> was given to Aharon haCohen since he had great fear, for all the tribe of Levi possessed great fear, as it is written (Malachi, 2:5), &#x201C;I gave him fear,&#x201D; and all the more so the high priest. Even his very name teaches of fear for &#x201C;Aharon&#x201D; is the numerical equivalent of 256, corresponding to the 256 (2 to the eighth power) wings of the angels called <italic>chayot hakedoshim</italic>, and wings teach of fear.<sup><xref rid="fn128">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>Corresponding to this great fear he was given the <italic>tsits</italic> to vivify and delight his soul, for the <italic>tsits</italic> teaches of the love that the blessed God has for Israel. Then at the time when the blessed God reveals His great love, all the fears depart, and Israel experiences great empowerment.<sup><xref rid="fn129">61</xref></sup> Therefore before the making of the robe (<italic>Me&#x2019;il</italic>) was mentioned it was not possible to mention the making of the <italic>tsits</italic>, for the great profusion of empowerment could, God forbid, bring forth an irreverent spirit. Therefore after the making of the <italic>Me&#x2019;il</italic>, which teaches of fear was mentioned, it was then possible to mention the making of the <italic>tsits</italic>, as in the words of the Holy Zohar, &#x201C;at the time of <italic>Mincha</italic> of Shabbat,&#x201D; which is after great fear, &#x201C;the brilliance of His desire is revealed,&#x201D; meaning great empowerment.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And these are the garments which they shall make: a breastplate [</italic>Choshen<italic>]</italic>, <italic>and an ephod</italic>, <italic>and a robe [</italic>Me&#x2019;il<italic>]</italic>, <italic>and a broidered coat [</italic>C&#x2019;tonet Tashbets<italic>]</italic>, <italic>and a mitre [</italic>Mitsnefet<italic>] and a girdle [</italic>Avnet<italic>] &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 28:4)</p>
<p>Corresponding to the eight priestly garments, the members of the great assembly (in the Second Temple period) codified the eight expressions in the blessing preceding the morning recitation of <italic>Shema</italic>, &#x201C;to understand and to discern, to hear, to learn, and to teach, to guard, and to do, and to uphold.&#x201D; &#x201C;To understand&#x201D; corresponds to the girdle [<italic>Avnet</italic>], for the girdle comes to make atonement for the fancies of the heart (<italic>Arachin</italic>, 16a), so too, was it worn over the heart and its length was thirty-two cubits.<sup><xref rid="fn130">62</xref></sup> &#x201C;To discern&#x201D; corresponds to the breastplate [<italic>Choshen</italic>], for a man must consider carefully in order to know the blessed God, for with Him there is no anger against the souls of Israel [the names of the twelve tribes were engraved on the Choshen], for, &#x201C;His wrath is for a moment, yet a lifetime in His will [favor]&#x201D; (Tehillim, 30:6). &#x201C;To hear&#x201D; corresponds to the robe (<italic>Me&#x2019;il</italic>), meaning that a man must hear and lead his ear to his foundation and root. This is explained (in <italic>Shemot</italic> Rabba, 40:3) on the verse (in Job), &#x201C;where were you when I founded the world?&#x201D; meaning where was your portion in Adam haRishon (when he sinned). Then when a man contemplates his portion in this he will then come to an understanding of what he has already fixed, and what he has yet to repair. This is hinted at in the robe (<italic>Me&#x2019;il</italic>), for the Holy Zohar mentions that the <italic>Me&#x2019;il</italic> is the secret of reincarnations (coming back until all is fixed, all the <italic>mitzvot</italic> have been fulfilled).</p>
<p>&#x201C;To learn&#x201D; corresponds to the mitre (hat, <italic>Mitsnefet</italic>), for the <italic>Mitsnefet</italic> makes atonement for coarseness of spirit (<italic>Arachin</italic>, ibid.), meaning to receive the truth from one who spoke it. &#x201C;To teach&#x201D; corresponds to the <italic>tsits</italic> (headplate), for of the <italic>tsits</italic> it is said, &#x201C;and it shall be on his forehead continually that they may be accepted,&#x201D; meaning that one needs a good eye in order to teach his fellow man. &#x201C;To guard&#x201D; corresponds to the embroidered coat (<italic>C&#x2019;tonet</italic>), for the <italic>C&#x2019;tonet</italic> makes atonement for the spilling of blood (ibid.). It teaches man to guard himself and to see that because of him no damage is done to his fellow man. Then his peers will not be able to suspect him, and then be punished for suspecting him in vain. Then he too will be punished for causing his fellow man to be punished. &#x201C;To do&#x201D; teaches of reliance, and the point of reliance is the performance of <italic>mitzvot</italic>, such that a man can stand in prayer and support himself on them.</p>
<p>This is as it is written (Tehillim, 104:3), &#x201C;who makes the clouds His chariot,&#x201D; and clouds teaches of the performance of <italic>mitzvot</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn131">63</xref></sup> &#x201C;To fulfill&#x201D; corresponds to the priestly pants, whose purpose is to cover his genitalia. This is a place on which a man stands to suffer a loss, as it is written (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 42:9), &#x201C;the nakedness of the land,&#x201D; meaning the vulnerable place by which the land may be conquered. At every place the blessed God created from which a man could build an everlasting structure, there He also created a place of vulnerability where he may lose all. However, by means of guarding himself here, then from this place an everlasting structure will emerge.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And you shall set it [the</italic> Choshen Mishpat<italic>] with four rows of stones; a carnelian [or carneol, or saridus], a topaz, and a smaragd [or carbuncle, or emerald, or agate] shall be the first row of stones. And the second row shall be a carbuncle [also turquoise, ruby</italic>, <italic>emerald, garnet], a sapphire, and a diamond. And the third row shall be an opal [also ligure, jacinth], an agate, and an amethyst. And the fourth row shall be a beryl [also chrysolite, topaz], and an onyx, and a jasper</italic> &#x2026;&#x201D; (Shemot, 28:17).</p>
<p>Carnelian represents the tribe of Reuven, for its name in Hebrew, <italic>odem</italic>, is closely related to <italic>adom</italic>, red, the color of <italic>simcha</italic>. The name Reuven is derived from sight (see <italic>Bereshit</italic>, 29:32), for with all his dealings and words he always sees himself standing in the presence of God, and God then illuminates his eyes. This causes man to experience great joy, as it is written (Mishlei, 15:30), &#x201C;the heart rejoices at the illumination of the eyes.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Topaz represents the tribe of Shimon, for the tribe of Shimon possesses great depths in the words of Torah, yet before they can bring them forth into actuality the must undergo refinement. Therefore Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai (the famous figure in the Talmud and author of the Zohar), since he was from the tribe of Shimon, possessed a depth of understanding in the words of Torah on the level of Moshe Rabeynu. Topaz or <italic>Pitdah</italic> hints at this, for its first and last letters spell &#x201C;mouth&#x201D; and the remaining letters, <italic>Tet</italic> and <italic>Dalet</italic>, are the letters just before <italic>Yud</italic> and <italic>Hei</italic> in the Hebrew alphabet. <italic>Yud Hei</italic> teach of the depth of wisdom<sup><xref rid="fn132">64</xref></sup> that is found in this tribe, yet it cannot bring it forward through speech.</p>
<p>Smaragd represents the tribe of Levi, for <italic>bareket</italic> hints at the fear of God, as it contains the letters of the word for lightning, <italic>barak</italic>, whose light is revealed suddenly, in a flash. In this the tribe of Levi possesses the refined fear of God, as it is written of them (Malachi, 2:5), &#x201C;I gave them My covenant for the fear with which he feared me.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;And the second row shall be a carbuncle&#x2026;.&#x201D; Carbuncle corresponds to the tribe of Yehuda, for it vacillates between all the colors, as all the colors are contained within it. So it is with the tribe of Yehuda, which does not stay fixed in one attribute, but rather when Yehuda is among the perfectly righteous he is perfectly righteous, and when he is among the &#x201C;<italic>ba&#x2019;alei tshuva</italic>,&#x201D; he is then the greatest penitent. This is as we find in the Gemara (<italic>Shabbat</italic>, 56a), &#x201C;all who say, &#x2018;David was a sinner,&#x2019; are mistaken,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn133">65</xref></sup> and we also find (<italic>Moed Katan</italic>, 16b), &#x201C;He raised an offering of <italic>tshuva</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn134">66</xref></sup> Further proof of this is how at one time he says in the book of Tehillim (86:1&#x2013;2), &#x201C;I am poor and destitute,&#x201D; and then right after he says, &#x201C;I am a Hasid.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn135">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>Sapphire&#x2014;<italic>Sapir</italic>&#x2014;corresponds to the tribe of Yissachar, for the sapphire teaches of clear and refined wisdom, as it says (<italic>Shemot</italic>, 24:10), &#x201C;like the paved work of sapphire stone, and the essence of the heavens for <italic>clearness</italic>.&#x201D; Of the tribe of Yissachar it is said, (Divrei haYamim 1, 12:32), &#x201C;and the children of Yissachar were men of understanding for the times,&#x201D; as they knew how to create leap years and fix the beginning of the months. This is a kind of knowledge that is possessed only by those to whom God has granted refined wisdom.<sup><xref rid="fn136">68</xref></sup> This is hinted at in that the 1,080 seconds in an hour is the numerical equivalent of four times <italic>E-lohim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn137">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>Diamond represents the tribe of Zevulun, for diamond, <italic>yahalom</italic>, is split up into the words, roughly translated, &#x201C;God hither.&#x201D; Zevulun was confidant that the blessed God was with him for all his endeavors, even though they seemed like worldly affairs, as it is said (<italic>Megillah</italic>, 6a), &#x201C;Zevulun dealt in trade.&#x201D; Even there (&#x201C;hither&#x201D;) he was deeply connected to God.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And the third row shall be opal,&#x201D; etc. &#x201C;Opal&#x201D; represents the tribe of Dan, for in this tribe we find God-given strength<sup><xref rid="fn138">70</xref></sup> and great resolve for victory. The mortal eye sometimes mistakes these attributes for anger, and on this the Torah testifies that he is a vessel dedicated to God. This is found in the name of the place that he was given as an inheritance, as it says (<italic>Shoftim</italic>, 18:29), &#x201C;however, the name of the city was at first Layish.&#x201D; Layish is another word for lion, and teaches of God-given strength and bravery, &#x201C;as it is written (Mishlei, 30:30), &#x201C;the lion is mighty among the beasts, and will not return in the face of all adversity.&#x201D; Yet after this city fell in their inheritance its name was changed to <italic>leshem</italic>, which teaches that all his power is due to his confidence that the blessed God will help him, and this is because he walks in simplicity.</p>
<p>This is as it is explained in the Gemara (<italic>Pesachim</italic>, 4a), &#x201C;A certain man used to say, &#x2018;Judge my case.&#x2019; They said, This proves that he is descended from the tribe of Dan, as it is written, &#x2018;Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.&#x2019;&#x201D; This is because he has God-given strength that surely he would be found innocent if judged, for with all the matters of this world, even with the <italic>mitzvot</italic> and good deeds that a man does, they remain in the balance even after the action is completed. For instance, if a man gives charity to a pauper, and the pauper later goes with this power and performs a mitzvah, then the one who gave the charity is assisting his performance of the mitzvah. If the pauper takes the money and uses it for a transgression, then the one who gave the charity is assisting him in transgressing. So the Godly vigor of the tribe of Dan in his confidence in God that because he did the mitzvah in simplicity then blessed God will not cause him to fail because of it. Certainly the blessed God brought him an honest pauper who took this power to do a mitzvah.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Agate&#x201D;&#x2014;<italic>shevo</italic>&#x2014;represents the tribe of Naftali, for <italic>shevo</italic> is related to the word for &#x201C;return&#x201D;&#x2014;<italic>shav</italic>. This means that even when he goes to engage in matters of this world, and it seems to the mortal eye that, God forbid, his heart is not with God, then at that moment his heart returns and &#x201C;gazes&#x201D; on God. The name of the chief of the tribe of Naftali teaches of this, whose name was Achira ben Einan, for <italic>Achira</italic> contains the word for &#x201C;back&#x201D;&#x2014;<italic>achor</italic>&#x2014;meaning that he always takes the back way (engaging in the matters of this world) and does not look back. &#x201C;Einan&#x201D; however, is related to &#x201C;eye&#x201D;&#x2014;<italic>ain</italic>&#x2014;meaning that even in this his eyes are constantly looking toward the blessed God.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Amethyst&#x201D;&#x2014;<italic>achlama</italic>&#x2014;corresponds to the tribe of Gad, meaning gathering together, and great God-given strength at a time when it is necessary to gather all of Israel together according to the will of the blessed God. So from this tribe all kinds of Godly strengths go forth to Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn139">71</xref></sup> as it is written of Gad (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 49:19), &#x201C;Gad, a troop shall troop upon him, but he shall troop upon their heel.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn140">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;And the fourth row shall be a beryl,&#x201D; etc. &#x201C;Beryl&#x201D; corresponds to the tribe of Asher. Asher signifies expansion, spreading forth, and so too does beryl teach of expansion, as it is written (Daniel, 10:6), &#x201C;His body was like beryl.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn141">73</xref></sup> This tribe also experienced expansion, as it is written (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 49:20), &#x201C;out of Asher his bread shall be fat.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Onyx&#x201D;&#x2014;<italic>shoham</italic>&#x2014;represents the tribe of Yosef. &#x201C;<italic>Shoham</italic>&#x201D; is love, as is explained in the verse (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 2:12), &#x201C;there was the Bedellium.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn142">74</xref></sup> Yosef too had a fierce love for the blessed God, so much so that he could easily abandon all the pleasures of this world for the love of the blessed God. For out of the fear of God alone he could not withstand the temptation of the wife of Potiphar, as it is written in the Gemara (<italic>Nedarim</italic>, 32b), &#x201C;At the time of the control of the inclination to evil, no one can remember the inclination to good.&#x201D; This could only be done out of love for the blessed God, who at the moment of that trial showed him a vision of the visage of his father Yaakov, and how his very name would be engraved on the stones of the Ephod of the High Priest.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Jasper&#x201D;&#x2014;<italic>yoshpeh</italic>&#x2014;is for the tribe of Binyamin, meaning that he has a mouth<sup><xref rid="fn143">75</xref></sup> [<italic>yesh peh</italic> in Hebrew] that can swallow and receive all the goodness that exists in the world. This is as it is written of him (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 49:27), &#x201C;Binyamin is a wolf that devours.&#x201D; He even has the power to collect and receive the goodness that exists among the nations of the world, looking at the good among them and entering them into Israel.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And you shall make an altar to burn the incense; make it of acacia wood.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 30:1)</p>
<p>All the vessels were mentioned in <italic>Parshat Truma</italic> except for the golden incense altar. This can be understood through what is written in the holy Zohar (<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 151b), &#x201C;what is incense? It is the connection of all.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn144">76</xref></sup> This hints that all done, even in &#x201C;this world,&#x201D; is all connected in the will of the blessed God, and without His will nothing at all would be done. One who misunderstands this could come to irreverence, God forbid, since everything that happens is allowed to happen from Heaven. Therefore the incense altar, which represents this understanding, was not said in <italic>Parshat Truma</italic>, but only after the explanations of the priestly garments in this <italic>Parsha</italic>, which teach of the great fear of God and vigilant guarding from the vain pleasures of this world. As it is written in the Gemara (<italic>Arachin</italic>, 16a), &#x201C;the <italic>ctonet</italic>, or tunic of chequer work, makes atonement for the spilling of blood,&#x201D; and so it is with all of the garments. By means of his priestly garments, the <italic>Cohen</italic> sends great fear of God to the heart of each one in Israel. Then after the <italic>Cohen</italic> has instilled such fear in the heart of Israel, then they have the ability to receive the <italic>simcha</italic> and love that comes from the power of the incense.</p>
<p>All of the vessels of the Mishkan were made of acacia wood inlayed with gold, except for the caporet (the covering for the Holy Ark) and the menorah, where it is specified that they be made of pure gold, not filled with acacia wood. It is known that the Mishkan and its vessels hint at the upright form of man, and for each limb man has the right to see to his own well-being, as it says in the Gemara (<italic>Pesachim</italic>, 68b), &#x201C;in the first place, when a man does something, he is doing it for himself.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn145">77</xref></sup> In the future, the blessed God will make it clear that the action that he did for himself was only in the sense of &#x201C;if a person does a mitzvah but not for the sake of Heaven, eventually he will do it for the sake of Heaven.&#x201D; Eventually he will bring the light out of the darkness, as it is said (Yoel, 4:18), &#x201C;and a fountain shall come forth from the house of God, and shall water the valley of Shittim [which means acacia wood].&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn146">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet the caporet, which corresponds to the heart, and the menorah, which corresponds to the eyes, with these a man must be especially vigilant that they are clean and refined, not corrupted in any way from his own desire for the pleasures of this world. This is as it is said in the Jerusalem Talmud (<italic>Berachot</italic>, 1:5), &#x201C;the eye and the heart are the two agents of sin. The eye sees and the heart lusts.&#x201D; But indeed the eye must be stripped of all the lusts of this world, and used as a pure vessel for the soul, like a clear glass through which the soul looks at the world and decides whether it is good and to receive it, or whether it is evil and to reject it. Yet, when within the eye itself there is any desire or lust for the pleasures of this world, then the eye is not a vessel for the soul, but rather a free agent, free to lust after the affairs of this world. Then the soul does not have the opportunity to distinguish the good from the evil. Therefore the blessed God commanded to be completely refined. The eye shall be clean and stripped of vain lusts, and then it will follow that the soul will only desire that which is the will of the blessed God.</p>

<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> K<small>I</small> T<small>ISSA</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And from it Aharon and his sons shall wash their hands and feet.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 30:19)</p>
<p>The act of the <italic>Cohanim</italic> washing from the laver (<italic>kiyor</italic>) signifies the removal of affliction, for washing teaches of this, as mentioned in the passage of the beheaded heifer (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 21:6, the <italic>eiglah arufah</italic>, performed after finding an unexplained death between cities), &#x201C;and the elders of the city shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded.&#x201D; With this they are saying that they have no affliction (associated from the incident), and are clean regarding it. So too, the <italic>Cohen</italic> who serves needs to wash, meaning that he removes any affliction, nullifying his own mind and will before the will of the blessed God. This means that all his service is only what the blessed God desires.</p>
<p>So it is with how we are commanded to wash in the morning and before a meal, for before one begins to fulfill the needs of the body he must pray to the blessed God. As his dealings in the world may result in his doing something contrary to the will of the blessed God, here he asks the blessed God to remove any desire he has from this action, even from something permitted to us that contains both good and its opposite. For if one were to eat in a way permitted to him and then go on and use the energy from this to transgress the Torah, then it is made clear that he received no good energy from this action. Concerning this we have ritual washing, which is a kind of prayer to the blessed God that from everything we will receive only the good that exists in it. For the inheritance that comes to man is a kind of gift that he never originally expected to receive, and according to this our sages enacted that we say the passage about the laver before we say the daily sacrifices, meaning that we ask that even what we pray for is what the blessed God desires.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Moshe turned and descended from the mountain, and two tablets of the testimony in his hand, written from both sides.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 32:15)</p>
<p>It is written in the Gemara (<italic>Shabbat</italic>, 104a), &#x201C;R. Chasda says, they were written from both sides for they were read from within and without. That is, &#x2018;<italic>navuv</italic> [empty], <italic>boban</italic>,&#x2019; &#x2018;<italic>rahav</italic> [arrogance or rage], <italic>behar</italic> [on the mountain],&#x2019; &#x2018;<italic>saru, veras</italic>.&#x2019;&#x201D; R. Chasda is saying that there is power in the words of Torah to change the heart of man from one side to the opposite. <italic>Navuv</italic> means one who is hollow, or empty of the words of Torah, and so by means of them he is filled with understanding, and this is, &#x201C;<italic>navuv, boban</italic>&#x201D; (<italic>boban</italic> is connected to <italic>Binah</italic>, or understanding). <italic>Rahav</italic> means someone who is filled with desires and external lusts, as it is written (Zohar, <italic>Shemot</italic>, 170b), &#x201C;the angel of Egypt was called <italic>rahav</italic>, and Egypt was steeped in perversity,&#x201D; as it says (Amos, 8:8), &#x201C;banished and immersed like the Nile of Egypt,&#x201D; whose waters were brackish, which teaches of evil thoughts of desire. By means of the words of Torah he can be separated from all lusts, which is the inner meaning of <italic>behar</italic> (on the mountain), for you do not find moisture on the mountain that is deep in the valley.</p>
<p>So too with Avraham Avinu, since he was separated from all lust, thus it was said (at the binding of Yitschak, <italic>Bereshit</italic>, 22:14), &#x201C;for it is said to this day, on the mount Hashem was seen.&#x201D; <italic>Saru</italic>, meaning anger, for <italic>sar</italic> is an expression of anger, as it is written Kings 1, 21:4), &#x201C;and Achav came home &#x2018;<italic>sar ve&#x2019;zaef</italic>,&#x2019; sullen and angry,&#x201D; and on this it says in the Gemara (<italic>Bava Metsia</italic>, 59b), &#x201C;why does the Torah warn against distressing the convert in forty-eight places? For it may turn him [<italic>saro</italic>] to evil,&#x201D; meaning he has anger, and by means of the words of Torah he may change his heart to the good, and separate himself from any anger, for <italic>moras</italic>, (<italic>veras</italic>, the opposite of <italic>saru</italic>) meaning rubbed or stirred, as the Gemara says, &#x201C;did they ever stir the blood of the sacrifice before you?&#x201D; for this occurs in a tender place (the opposite of anger), as it is said (Yechezkel, 46:14), &#x201C;to stir [<italic>laros</italic>] the fine flour.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Moshe said to God, see, you say to me, bring this people up &#x2026; And God said to Moshe, I will also do as you have spoken, for you have found favor in My sight, and I will know you by name.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 33:12&#x2013;17)</p>
<p>The blessed God addressed Moshe&#x2019;s request by saying that the blessed God knows Moshe by name, which means that He created Moshe with good attributes in order to receive the <italic>Chein</italic>, the Grace of the blessed God. <italic>Chein</italic> itself is a free gift, (&#x201C;free,&#x201D; <italic>Chinam</italic>, even has the same root as grace, <italic>Chein</italic>, meaning that it is given regardless of merit. Betsalel) that the blessed God created him with good atributes and owing to this he is in God&#x2019;s favor (a play on words; to be in favor is also <italic>chein</italic>). First (for in verse 12 Moshe makes first mention of), &#x201C;You said, I knew you by name,&#x201D; meaning that He chose him as he chose all the Patriarchs, even before they performed good deeds. And these attributes that were imprinted in their souls yet remain in us, for the three attributes that crown us (as a people), compassion, modesty, and giving loving-kindness, are not contingent on our good deeds but comes rather from the holiness of our Patriarchs, which they inherited to us.</p>
<p>This is why Moshe first said that the blessed God knew him by name, and then after, he found favor with Him, whereas when the blessed God in His answer to Moshe formulates it in the opposite way, first saying that he has found favor in His eyes, and after saying that He knew him by name. This means that the blessed God recognized his attributes, which are a vessel for receiving the words of Torah. In this way he would at all times desire and long for new words of Torah, and this is how he finds favor with God, meaning that he will always desire and strive for the &#x201C;free gifts&#x201D; (the reception of <italic>Chein</italic>). Toward this He created him with good attributes, as it is written (Daniel, 2:21), &#x201C;give wisdom to the wise.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This concerns what is said in the Gemara of Binyamin (<italic>Yoma</italic>, 12a), &#x201C;Binyamin the <italic>Tsaddik</italic> was greatly concerned that the Holy of Holies fall in his domain. [For the Temple mount falls both in the portions of Yehuda and Binyamin, yet the Holy of Holies was in the portion of Binyamin, and because of his holy &#x201C;distress&#x201D; to take care of the area, the Altar was also allotted in his portion.] For this he was made a host for the Divine presence.&#x201D; That is to say, since the blessed God recognized that if the Holy Temple (the house of the Holy of Holies) would be built in his portion then he would greatly desire that the outside Altar also be in his portion (the &#x201C;free gift&#x201D;). For this (desire) he was made its host.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And He said, My presence shall go with you, and I shall give you rest.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 33:14)</p>
<p>The blessed God answered Moshe that at a time that a &#x201C;garment&#x201D; goes forth from Him that seems like a face of anger, then Israel shall be at peace. The blessed God has garments where He shows His jealousy, and at the time when the blessed God is in this attribute then the <italic>Tsaddik</italic>, who is the pillar of his generation, also takes on this attribute, like Pinchas in his generation or Eliyahu in his generation. This is because the <italic>Tsaddik</italic> is the garment of the blessed God, and then it seems as if he is bringing accusations against Israel, as when Eliyahu said (Melachim 1, 19:10), &#x201C;for the children of Israel have abandoned Your covenant.&#x201D; Then when the blessed God removes this garment, and conducts the world through His goodness and compassion, then the <italic>Tsaddik</italic> shows that at the depth of his consciousness he was at no time angry, God forbid, and then the heart of the <italic>Tsaddikim</italic> will also be at peace with Israel.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And I shall remove My hand, and you shall see my back, but my face shall not be seen.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 33:23)</p>
<p>It is said in the Gemara (<italic>Berachot</italic>, 7a), &#x201C;this teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, showed Moshe the knot at the back of his head <italic>tefillin</italic>.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn147">79</xref></sup>&#160;<italic>Tefillin</italic> hints at intense closeness and connection, as it is said (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 30:8), &#x201C;the wrestlings of God.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn148">80</xref></sup> This means that we are connected to the Holy One, blessed be He, and no matter what happens to us, we will not separate from Him. In the <italic>tefillin</italic> of the Master of the Universe it is written, &#x201C;Who is a nation so great as to have God so close to it?&#x201D; This means the the blessed God praises himself in that Israel is so connected to Him, and also that the blessed God is connected to them, even if they sin He will not disengage his love for them. &#x201C;But My face shall not be seen&#x201D; means that the blessed God showed Moshe all the events that happened in the past and saw clearly what the blessed God had built out of each action. This is &#x201C;You shall see My back.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn149">81</xref></sup> &#x201C;But my face shall not be seen&#x201D; means that the Holy One, blessed be He, did not show Moshe what was happening in the present, because all the acceptances of punishment were transmitted through him.<sup><xref rid="fn150">82</xref></sup> Therefore He could not, as it were, show him the present, meaning how the blessed God was completely reconciled with Israel in the present.</p>
<p>This is as it is said (Midrash Tanchuma, <italic>Chukat</italic>, 8), &#x201C;that which was not said [revealed] to Moshe Rabeynu was said to Rabbi Akiva, as it is said [Iyov, 28:10], &#x2018;his eye saw all the preciousness.&#x2019;&#x201D; This means that He showed Rabbi Akiva the whole <italic>Tefillin</italic>, and showed him how God was reconciled with Israel also in the present. This is as it is mentioned in the Gemara (<italic>Makkot</italic>, 7a), &#x201C;Rabbi Akiva said, If I had been a member of a Sanhedrin, no one would ever have been sentenced to death.&#x201D; This is because he saw how the Holy One, blessed be He, was always reconciled with Israel.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And he said to Him, if Your presence does not go with me, then do not raise us up from this.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 33:15)</p>
<p>Moshe asked the blessed God that even while He is still dressed in this garment (see the previous discussion of &#x201C;and He said, My presence shall go with you&#x201D;) that even then, if any one of Israel sins, that the sin would not reach the depth of the heart. That even then, the sinner&#x2019;s mind would not become so weak that he would, God forbid, remove himself from the blessed God, of whom he said (<italic>Shemot</italic>, 15:2), &#x201C;this is my God,&#x201D; and of whom he said, &#x201C;and You have separated both Me and Your people from all the peoples on the face of the earth.&#x201D; The difference between Israel and the nations is not only based on the performance of <italic>mitzvot</italic> and good deeds, for they too can perform actions that seem to be good. Yet the difference is, even when one of Israel sins, then the sin will not be like that of the nations.<sup><xref rid="fn151">83</xref></sup> Rather it will only have effect from the edge and outside, with the depth of the heart remaining connected, even united, with the blessed God.</p>
<p>This is as it is written in the Gemara (<italic>Berachot</italic>, 32b) in the verse (Yeshayahu, 49:14), &#x201C;And Zion said, has Hashem forsaken me? Has Hashem forgotten me? Can a woman forget her suckling child, the child of her womb? These too will be forgotten, but I will not forget you.&#x201D; &#x201C;The community of Israel said before God, Master of the Universe&#x0021; Since there is no forgetfulness before Your Throne of Glory, perhaps you will not forget the sin of the golden calf? God answered, &#x2018;these too will be forgotten.&#x2019; The Community of Israel said, &#x2018;perhaps you will forget the day we stood at Mount Sinai?&#x2019; God answered, &#x201C;but I [who said &#x201C;I&#x2014;Anochi&#x201D; at Mount Sinai] will not forget you.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>
<p>It may be asked of this, why does God say that he will forget one incident and remember the other? Truly, the sin of the golden calf happened because the blessed God wanted to show them the order that He had arranged in His Divine plan for all His attributes for all generations. He showed them that at one time He would conduct the world through one attribute, and at another time through a different one. This way they would not have to pray at each moment for God to show them which mode and which attribute He was now choosing, but rather He gave them all of His attributes at once (<italic>Shemot</italic>, 34:6&#x2013;7), and they could proceed on their way ever confident, and since the sin would only reach from the edge and outward it was therefore forgotten. The <italic>mitzvot</italic>, however, are from the depth of the heart, an eternal memorial. There is a special reason why the passage discussing Shabbat is juxtaposed to the sin of the golden calf. This is because the root of the sin of the golden calf came to them at the very moment that the Holy One, blessed be He, and Moshe Rabeynu were involved in the study of Shabbat.</p>
<p>Shabbat hints at the day that is entirely Shabbat (the redemption), and at that time prayer will not be necessary because the Holy One, blessed be He, will make it clear to all the order of His attributes,<sup><xref rid="fn152">84</xref></sup> for without His will nothing at all could be done in the world. Down below they felt vibrations that the blessed God was preparing to bestow unto them this complete good, and the effect in their actions was the sin of the golden calf. This is because a calf is something that is not yet complete,<sup><xref rid="fn153">85</xref></sup> and one must wait for it to reach its completion. In the same way they wanted to receive the &#x201C;day that is entirely Shabbat&#x201D; before its time, for God will only bestow unto us this complete good in the future.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And He said, I will cause all of My good to pass before you, and I will proclaim the name of Hashem, and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and, and I will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 33:19)</p>
<p>Since Moshe asked God to show him the depth of how He conducts the world, then why does each man have his own rank and level, where no one is equal to another?<sup><xref rid="fn154">86</xref></sup> To this the Holy One, blessed be He, answered him, &#x201C;I will cause all of My good to pass before you,&#x201D; which means that no man knows his rank and the good that is his portion, and he shall see this through what he chooses for himself.<sup><xref rid="fn155">87</xref></sup> After this it says, &#x201C;and I shall proclaim the name of Hashem,&#x201D; meaning that I will show the depth of My consciousness in what I have apportioned for each one from the beginning of creation.</p>
<p>This is because &#x201C;the name of Hashem&#x201D; teaches of the beginning of creation when He brings all into being.<sup><xref rid="fn156">88</xref></sup> Then you shall see that what each one chooses for himself is exactly the portion that God has prepared for him. This is &#x201C;I will be gracious with whom I will be gracious,&#x201D; meaning with that which I have been gracious and merciful with him from the beginning is exactly that which I will use to save him for his own good. By means of this one will not arrive at the portion of his fellow, as in the saying of the Midrash on the verse (Kohellet, 3:9), &#x201C;what does one profit in working in that which he labors?&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Each artisan is only permitted to dwell with his fellow craftsmen&#x201D; (Kohellet Rabba, 3:9).</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Moshe made haste, and bowed his head to the ground, and worshipped. And he said, if I have found favor in Your eyes I pray that Adonai shall go in our midst, for they are a stiff-necked people. Forgive our iniquities and sins and take us as Your inheritance.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 34:8)</p>
<p>It is written in the Gemara (<italic>Sanhedrin</italic>, 111a), &#x201C;What did Moshe see [that, immediately after receiving the thirteen attributes of mercy he ran and bowed in worship]? He saw the Long Suffering [patient].&#x201D; Truly, what is the use of God&#x2019;s attribute of patience if the sin is not erased? Is not the entire length of his life only temporary, and even all the <italic>mitzvot</italic> and good deeds that he does will not reach the depths, for they have not been done from the source of life? And even the children he fathers will only live out the number of their days, for their source is only in fleeting existence? However, the Holy One, blessed be He, showed him that in the depths He bears no anger toward Israel, and it is only from the edge and outward, for such anger could eradicate them, God forbid.</p>
<p>Then the Holy One, blessed be He, showed Moshe that He would also be long-suffering with them, that eternal life would remain within them, and all the <italic>mitzvot</italic> and good deeds that they did would last forever, and the children that they would have would continue forever. For their <italic>mitzvot</italic>, good deeds, and progeny were all rooted in the source of life, and would endure forever. Upon seeing this, Moshe then asked, &#x201C;I pray that Adonai will go in our midst,&#x201D; for the name &#x201C;Adonai&#x201D; necessitates service, meaning, let such service dwell in our hearts that we may perform <italic>mitzvot</italic> and good deeds that endure forever. This is &#x201C;pardon our iniquity,&#x201D; meaning to slowly remove the sin from our heart that only the good will remain. &#x201C;And take us for Your inheritance,&#x201D; meaning, take us as an inheritance and then we will be able to serve God with all of our qualities.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Do not make molten gods.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 34:17)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Molten or graven images&#x201D; means principles. The verse is saying that at a time when your heart receives an explicit understanding, then do not look to the principles and act according to them; rather, you shall know down to the detail how to act according to the understanding of your heart. We find an example of this with Eliyahu at Mount Carmel. See below in <italic>Parshat Chukot</italic> on the section beginning, &#x201C;and they camped at Ovot,&#x201D; and there the matter is well explained.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;You shall keep the festival of matsot in the time of the month of Aviv, seven days shall you eat matsot as I command you, for in the month of Aviv you came out of Egypt.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 34:18)</p>
<p><italic>Aviv</italic> is related to the word <italic>Av</italic>, &#x201C;father,&#x201D; which includes all the generations, meaning all the good of all the other months and seasons, but not as much as in the month of Aviv itself, which is the father, which has in it even all the good of the month of Aviv. And this is why if you exchange the letters of Pesach through the <italic>atbash</italic> system<sup><xref rid="fn157">89</xref></sup> you arrive at the initial letters of Tisha B&#x2019;Av, for in the future all the festivals will be nullified except for Tisha B&#x2019;Av (which will be transformed into the ultimate festival), which contains all the festivals and is the father of them all. Also, the time of the month of Av that is now the father (first of the months), will also be in the time of the month of Av, and this is the meaning of &#x201C;the time of the month of Aviv.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;All that opens the womb is Mine, and every firstborn among your cattle, whether ox or sheep.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 34:20)</p>
<p>If you see that the <italic>Tsaddik</italic> suffers and worries over making a living, you may, God forbid, bring accusations against the blessed God concerning this. This is why it says, &#x201C;all that opens the womb is Mine,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn158">90</xref></sup> every time an opening of compassion is opened it is only from Me, because I am called the Father of Compassion. It is only that you do not understand My intentions. Nevertheless, (as the following verse ends), &#x201C;none shall appear before Me empty-handed,&#x201D; meaning you are required to give at least a small gift to a poor man, even if you see that I am not compassionate with him. Even though it say in the Gemara (<italic>Shabbat</italic>, 151b), &#x201C;Rabbi Yosef said: We assert that a scholar will not suffer poverty. But we see that he does suffer poverty. Even if he suffers poverty, he does not engage in begging,&#x201D; yet if he is not a scholar and he must resort to begging, then you are required to give him something small to sustain his life.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Guard that which I command you today &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 34:11)</p>
<p>In this <italic>Parsha</italic> twelve kinds of guarding and warnings are mentioned corresponding to the twelve tribes, with each tribe having one essential point of guarding necessary for it.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;The firstling of an ass you shall redeem with a lamb, and if you do not redeem it then you shall break his neck, and none shall come before My face empty-handed.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 34:20)</p>
<p>It is written in the Midrash (<italic>Bamidbar</italic> Rabba, 4:4), &#x201C;The Holy One, blessed be He, said &#x2018;On account of my love for Israel I changed the natural order of things. I have said that an ass must be redeemed with a lamb, as it says, &#x2018;And the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb.&#x2019; I, did not do so, however, but redeemed a lamb with an ass.&#x2019; For the Egyptians are termed &#x2018;ass&#x2019;; as it says, &#x2018;whose flesh are the flesh of asses,&#x2019; (Yechezkel, 23:20) and Israel are called &#x2018;lamb,&#x2019; as it says, &#x2018;Israel is a scattered lamb,&#x2019; (Yirmiya, 10:17). &#x2018;I slew their firstborn and sanctified the firstborn of Israel.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>
<p>This is understood through what is said in the writings of the Ari&#x201D;zal, that the fixing for one who is acustomed to lying is that even in order to make peace he should refrain from lying. The fixing for one who has eaten forbidden foods is to restrict his eating even on Shabbat. In other words, you may restrict <italic>Kedusha</italic> if it is in order to rectify a sin. Thus it was with Yeravoam who came into conflict with Shlomo haMelech, and the blessed God ascribed the sin to Shlomo in order to fix Yeravoam. This is, &#x201C;the firstling of an ass you shall redeem with a lamb,&#x201D; and Yeravoam was redeemed through what was ascribed as a sin also with Shlomo haMelech.</p>

<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> V<small>AYAQHEL</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Moshe gathered together all the congregation of the children of Israel &#x2026; six days shall you do your work and the seventh day shall be for you a holy Shabbat &#x2026; take from yourselves an offering for God &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 35:1&#x2013;5)</p>
<p>Why was Shabbat discussed just before the work on the Mishkan (Tabernacle)? With the building of the Mishkan, all the hearts of Israel were united without anyone feeling superior to his fellow. At first, everyone possessing a heart of understanding performed his particular work on the Mishkan, and it was shown unto him that he had done wondrous work. Then afterward, when they saw how all the disparate elements fit perfectly together, every curtain and board, and every element perfectly suited every other one as if it was the work of one man, they thus understood that all that they had done was only a product of their intellect out of the assistance of the blessed God to every one who contributed to the Mishkan, producing afterward the perfection of the structure. So how then could one feel superior over another when all that was done was only with the help of the blessed God?</p>
<p>Similarly we find in the Gemara <italic>Megillah</italic> (9a), &#x201C;It happened with Ptolemy [king of Egypt, 285&#x2013;246 <small>BCE</small>], that he brought together seventy-two sages of Israel, and asked them all separately, &#x2018;translate the Torah of your teacher Moshe.&#x2019; They all answered in exactly the same way [without consulting with each other, &#x2018;E-lohim created in the beginning&#x2019;],&#x201D; each one in his heart intended toward the deepest of wisdom. Then when they saw that they were all of the same opinion then they understood that it came about through the assistance of the blessed God. This is why the Shabbat is mentioned immediately before the work of the Mishkan, for the principle of their union was from the mitzvah of Shabbat, for Shabbat is included in all the <italic>mitzvot</italic> when one has the intention that they are for the sake of Heaven. This intention is called Shabbat. So too, with the work on the Mishkan, all their work was intended for the glory of Heaven in order that the <italic>Shechina</italic> (Divine presence) would have a dwelling place in Israel. For this reason they united together, for if so much as a nail were missing the <italic>Shechina</italic> would not rest in the Mishkan. Therefore no one could in any way feel superior to another, even the one who made the ark to the one the tent-spikes of the courtyard, for, as it says in the Gemara (<italic>Sotah</italic>, 40a), &#x201C;what does it matter, both this and this serve to exult the Highest.&#x201D; This is &#x201C;and Moshe gathered together all the congregation of the children of Israel.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026;. see&#x0021; God called in the name of Betzalel &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 36:30)</p>
<p>It is said in the Midrash (Sochar Tov, 21), &#x201C;He gave majesty [<italic>hod</italic>] to Moshe and splendor [<italic>hadar</italic>] to Yehoshua.&#x201D; <italic>Hadar</italic>, meaning splendor or adornment, is an action that brings honor (<italic>tiferet</italic>, also beauty and balance) to the one who does it, meaning the action that he did arouses grace (<italic>chein</italic>) in the eyes of all, and all praise his action for it is clear to all that it was done with the intention for the sake of Heaven. <italic>Hod</italic>, or majesty, is an action that brings honor (beauty) &#x201C;from the man himself,&#x201D; meaning that the one who does the action receives no praise from those who see it, for on the surface it seems to go against reason, only &#x201C;bringing beauty from the man himself&#x201D; for the (spiritual) form of man who descends into the awesome depths of the action itself. Yet on its surface it bears no beauty or honor.</p>
<p>This is &#x201C;He gave majesty [<italic>hod</italic>] to Moshe,&#x201D; meaning that only at their depths were his actions for the sake of Heaven, yet on the surface they brought him no honor, as it is written (Midrash Tanchuma, <italic>Vayaqhel</italic>, 3), &#x201C;they were murmuring against Moshe because he always appointed his relatives to high positions,&#x201D; like the accusations of the followers of Korach that he was not commanded to do this by the mouth of the blessed God, where in truth there was no room to suspect him in this, God forbid, for all this had come from the side of the blessed God.</p>
<p>So too here, appointing Betzalel for the work on the Mishkan (Tabernacle) was from the mouth of the blessed God, for the blessed God gave Betzalel more wisdom and understanding than all the others who were working on the Mishkan. And this is, &#x201C;see [plural]&#x0021; God called in the name of Betzalel,&#x201D; for the blessed God did not tell only Moshe, &#x201C;see [singular]&#x0021; I called in the name of Betzalel,&#x201D; yet Moshe Rabeynu wanted to &#x201C;clear his name,&#x201D; so therefore he said, &#x201C;see&#x0021; If you will look with a good eye then you will see that it is the will of the blessed God that Betzalel is the principal one involved in the work on the Mishkan.&#x201D; If you compare the curtain that Betzalel made to a curtain made by others you will see that this one has more grace and balance than all the others, even if the two curtains are fashioned in the same way (but there is something inside this one that the other lacks). This is certainly proof that God&#x2019;s will is in him more than the all the rest, and this is &#x201C;see,&#x201D; a term denoting understanding, that from this you will understand that God has chosen Betzalel.</p>
<p>This matter also concerned Moshe Rabeynu, that even though he did not have a clear and revealed splendor (<italic>hadar</italic>), nonetheless, whoever looked at him with a good eye would see the majesty (<italic>hod</italic>), meaning that his awesome depths would become clearly noticed. This is the matter of the <italic>Masvei</italic>, the cover for his face (to cover the <italic>keren or</italic>, the beams of light that emerged from his forehead after he descended with the second tablets of the Law, light that was too much to bear for the unworthy), which is the numerical equivalent of <italic>HAVA&#x201D;YEI Elo-heicha</italic> (Hashem Your God), for the <italic>mem</italic> and <italic>hei</italic> of <italic>Masvei</italic> equals the expansion of the Tetragrammaton equaling 45 (YHV&#x201D;H may be spelled out&#x2014;<italic>Yud Vav Dalet, Hei Aleph, Vav Alef Vav, Hei Alef</italic>; all together equaling 45), and the <italic>Samech</italic> and <italic>Vav</italic> (the last two letters) of <italic>Mahsvei</italic>, equals <italic>Elo-heicha</italic> (your God). The name <italic>HAVA&#x201D;YEI</italic> teaches of majesty (<italic>hod</italic>), and <italic>Elo-heicha</italic> teaches of splendor (<italic>hadar</italic>), meaning that even though the splendor was not seen explicitly in Moshe, just the same, both splendor and majesty were included within him, and who would look at him with a good eye would see that all his actions were done for the sake of Heaven.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; the people bring much more than is enough for the service of the work &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 36:5)</p>
<p>The great praise bestowed on Israel for mentioning their donations to the materials for the Mishkan so many times, and what is unique about this, must be understood, for who would refrain from giving all his wealth for the <italic>mitzvot</italic> of the blessed God, and in particular when it concerned the building of the Mishkan? In truth, man does not know the root of his heart&#x2014;if he is truly giving. The test of this is, if one is asked one time to donate for a new mitzvah, then he can give abundantly, but after he has grown accustomed to this mitzvah he then closes his hand from giving. From this it is understood that he is not giving from his roots, for if it came out of his roots he would not refrain from giving. Here, with the Mishkan, the blessed God wanted only true donations from the center point of the root of their hearts, because it is in its essence an everlasting structure, and thus the <italic>Kedusha</italic> (holiness) of the donations also had to be enduring. So in the eyes of all of Israel it was made as if they were accustomed to it and it was not as a new thing, and still, time after time they gave from the center point of the root of their hearts, showing that their giving was refined. This is &#x201C;the people bring much more than is enough,&#x201D; meaning that they gave every time, so therefore the Torah praises their giving.</p>

<chapter>
<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> P<small>EKUDEI</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;These are the accounts of the Mishkan, the Tabernacle of Testimony as it was counted &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 38:21)</p>
<p>&#x201C;The accounts&#x201D; (<italic>pekudei</italic> in Hebrew) is a term denoting prominence, or standing out, as in (Shmuel 1, 20:25), &#x201C;and David&#x2019;s place was empty [<italic>pakad</italic>],&#x201D; meaning that his place was prominent so that no one else would sit upon it. By means of the Mishkan, it was prominently recognized that the Holy One, blessed be He, exists also in the physical world, which all the idolaters of the stars and constellations deny. This is the meaning of the verse, &#x201C;These are the accounts of the Mishkan, the Tabernacle of Testimony,&#x201D; meaning the prominence that was made by the Mishkan was that it was a Mishkan of Testimony. Testimony is something that is made quite clear, meaning that by means of the Mishkan it was made clear to the eyes of all the nations that the Holy One, blessed be He, rules, and exists in this lowly world. Who made this prominence? The verse states explicitly, &#x201C;which was counted by the mouth of Moshe,&#x201D; meaning that Moshe Rabeynu brought this prominence from the heavens to the earth in this world.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And he erected the courtyard around the Mishkan &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Shemot, 40:33)</p>
<p>With the establishment of all the vessels of the Mishkan it is said, &#x201C;as God commanded Moshe,&#x201D; yet with the establishment of the courtyard this is not said. For the whole matter of &#x201C;as God commanded Moshe,&#x201D; meaning that the matter was as clear and explicit to Moshe at the time each vessel was established in its function as it was when the blessed God first spoke of it. This is as it is written (Torat <italic>Cohanim, Tsav</italic>, 1), &#x201C;everywhere it is said, &#x2018;<italic>tsav</italic>,&#x2019; &#x2018;commanded,&#x2019; it means requiring alacrity when it was commanded and for all generations,&#x201D; and for this reason it is said individually for each vessel, &#x201C;as God commanded.&#x201D; It is written (<italic>Bamidbar</italic> Rabba, 1:3), &#x201C;before the Mishkan was erected the whole desert was suitable for speaking with God, and after the Mishkan was erected the desert was no longer suitable.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Therefore after the courtyard was raised, and the erection of the Mishkan was completed in its perfection, it was no longer possible to say here, &#x201C;as God commanded,&#x201D; for &#x201C;as God commanded&#x201D; is said when the word is as clear and prominent as at the time when it was originally commanded from the mouth of the blessed God. This could not be so with the erection of the courtyard, for now the desert was not suitable for reception of the Divine word (only within the Mishkan itself), as now the Divine word was not explicit (in the desert). Therefore in the courtyard it is not said, &#x201C;as God commanded.&#x201D;</p>
<h1><bold>NOTES</bold></h1>
<ftnote id="fn69">1. As our sages say in <italic>Avot</italic>, &#x201C;this world is just a corridor,&#x201D; and what will become of their more primary existence in the world to come? Do you even need me for their spiritual well-being in the hereafter?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn70">2. Water always symbolizes desires.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn71">3. Here we continue a theme from the previous weeks, that the highest possible level for man to achieve is to be a pure vessel for the will of the blessed God, as Yaakov always looked toward God&#x2019;s will to shine into him, this being the only motivation for his action. It is similarly so with Yehuda and David; one need only look for their names in the previous <italic>Parshiot</italic> to find how this was their true nature.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn72">4. It seems in my poor understanding, that as the Zohar says, &#x201C;the letter <italic>Caf</italic> stands for <italic>Ceter</italic>, the Divine crown,&#x201D; which in a general sense surrounds and is higher than all the other <italic>sefirot</italic>, as a crown is above and surrounding the head. It is so supernal in nature that it is not even counted among the ten <italic>sefirot</italic>, which rather start with <italic>Chochma</italic> (see <italic>Eyts Haiim, Sha&#x2019;ar</italic> 23, Chapter 5). Also, there is a basic principle that the highest level of each world, <italic>Ceter</italic>, is actually the same as the lowest level, <italic>Malchut</italic>, of the world above it; therefore being the chain that connects everything to the Highest, connecting the finite with the infinite&#x2014;the blessed <italic>Ayn Sof</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn73">5. This could be explained, that either that the All Powerful would reside in a lowly bush until the time was right, or that just as the bush was not consumed, so would Moshe be patient until Pharaoh was subdued.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn74">6. What, or <italic>mah</italic>, in Hebrew, numerically equivalent to 45.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn75">7. And in this you shall know, that all the punishments that exist in the world, even among the Gentiles, such as, this government minister is deposed, and the country is given to another, all of this comes out of the evil attributes mentioned in the verse, &#x201C;six does God hate &#x2026; a proud look, a lying tongue and hand&#x2026;&#x201D; see there. <italic>Tashlum</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn76">8. <italic>B&#x2019;kirbo</italic>, &#x201C;in its midst,&#x201D; has the same root as <italic>Krav</italic>, meaning war.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn77">9. It is unclear to me who is being referred to in this last passage, but it seems to be that the locusts would be merciless on the Egyptians even if they renounced the hatred they were saturated in, for locusts represent the opposite of inner strife in a community.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn78">10. Because the descendants of Lot were Ammon and Moav, which the Gemara calls the &#x201C;evil neighbors of Jerusalem.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn79">11. A way forever filled with impasses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn80">12. &#x201C;Saying,&#x201D; <italic>Amira</italic>, as opposed to &#x201C;speaking,&#x201D; <italic>Dibbur</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn81">13. But rather He led them by a more circuitous way so it would be more difficult to return.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn82">14. The deficiency was that Israel had not reached its final completion, evinced in their desires to run back to Egypt.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn83">15. Like the word <italic>Eitan</italic>, meaning strength.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn84">16. Evil force, or &#x201C;shell.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn85">17. Apparently engaged in the act of fornication.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn86">18. Like <italic>pi haheiroot</italic>, the mouth of liberty.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn87">19. Perhaps a kind of &#x201C;shrunken head.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn88">20. Though it must be investigated, for it says there in verse 36, &#x201C;and the people held their peace &#x2026; for the king&#x2019;s commandment was, answer him not,&#x201D; which seems like the response for Egypt.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn89">21. Meaning that the period of <italic>tsimtsum</italic> was only for six days, and then on the seventh, &#x201C;thus God saved,&#x201D; meaning releasing them from restrictions and bringing them great salvations.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn90">22. Remember the horror that the Egyptians would make bricks out of Jewish children.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn91">23. <italic>Eeleimim</italic>, speechless, signifying unfathomable inwardness.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn92">24. The matter here is, when the blessed God effuses <italic>Kedusha</italic> to the hearts of Israel, it proceeds level by level, first by way of the leaders of Israel, just as the Torah was given to Moshe and afterward he taught it to the leaders of Israel until it finally reached the common folk, just in the same way each soul in Israel first receives in his consciousness [<italic>da&#x2019;at-Moshe</italic>] until the <italic>Kedusha</italic> is fixed in all his limbs and organs, as it is written [Malachi, 3:16], &#x201C;then they that feared God spoke with one another, God heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before Him,&#x201D; meaning that it was carved into the hearts of the children of Israel. Now it is, that the beginning of the effluence of <italic>Kedusha</italic> is in the <italic>Kedusha</italic> of time, and time is only in the possession of the blessed God. Therefore women are exempt from positive commandments that are bound to time, for female teaches of being fixed in time without activity. However, women are required to perform <italic>mitzvot</italic> that are not bound to time, and this is the sign that this <italic>Kedusha</italic> is fixed in the hearts of Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Knowing this, Moshe had them move on, for whenever it is not yet fixed in the heart of man he can still enter into uncertainty, and enter this <italic>Kedusha</italic> into uncertainty, for it is not yet promised to him, so he may enter it into uncertainty on the possibility that he may gain even more. Yet when it is fixed in his heart, he is not permitted to enter [this <italic>Kedusha</italic> into uncertainty] for now it is certainly his and his possession, so once Moshe saw that the <italic>Kedusha</italic> was fixed in their hearts he had them move on. For truly all the <italic>Kedusha</italic> that man receives, when one receives good from the blessed God, there is a recognition of His greatness all the time that it resides in his intellect. It is brilliantly clear and cannot be brought to a place that is not the will of the blessed God. Yet when it is fixed in the body, then the brilliant clarity is hidden from man and with this added strength he might use it to do an unwarranted activity.</ftnote>
<ftnote>For this reason our sages enacted that we say the <italic>ketoret</italic> (incense offerings) after every [morning] prayer, because the word <italic>ketoret</italic> is related to the word <italic>ketira</italic>, connection, meaning connecting everything, to make sure that this newly gained strength [from the newly gained <italic>Kedusha</italic>] does not enter into a realm that is not the will of the blessed God [that it be connected to the will]. And this incident actually caused Miriam to speak against Moshe, so therefore she is called here &#x201C;Aharon&#x2019;s sister,&#x201D; for Aharon was also caught in this [as mentioned in Rashi]. Even though the illumination of the blessed God brings strength to man, yet indeed it does not have to be the source of distress of any man, which is a place that is not the will of the blessed God. So therefore Moshe had them move onward. (Excerpt from <italic>Giliyon Mei HaShiloach</italic>.)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn93">25. These could be variously interpreted as pertaining to many different situations, the theme of adultery or <italic>z&#x2019;nut</italic> only being the literary form that the Zohar is using, and one possible application.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn94">26. Rashi says on this verse, &#x201C;because of the plagues on Pharaoh and the war with Amalek, Yitro became wise and converted.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn95">27. <italic>Amar</italic> in Hebrew.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn96">28. &#x201C;<italic>Amar</italic>,&#x201D; &#x201C;he said,&#x201D; occurs 595 times in the Scriptures, and in only three instances do we find it vocalized with the vowel <italic>kamatz</italic> under the <italic>mem</italic> instead of a <italic>patach</italic>. See <italic>Bereshit</italic> 18:17, &#x201C;and God said, shall I hide that which I do from Avraham,&#x201D; and <italic>Bereshit</italic> 21:1, &#x201C;and God remembered Sarah as He said.&#x201D; In the <italic>Torat haNekudot</italic>, where each vowel corresponds to a <italic>sefirah</italic>, the vowel <italic>kamatz</italic> corresponds to the <italic>sefirah</italic> of <italic>keter</italic>, or crown, the highest of the <italic>sefirot</italic>. It is described in the liturgical poem &#x201C;Kel Mistater&#x201D; [&#x201C;God, hidden in Himself,&#x201D; incorporated in the liturgy of the third meal of Shabbat] as the &#x201C;intellect hidden from all thought.&#x201D; When connected to this, it signifies something that could be said but not discerned except by the intellect of Moshe Rabeynu. Also requiring further investigation is why the Rebbe chose to say &#x201C;also to signify,&#x201D; for surely there are seventy faces to the Torah, even for every vowel, but also in addition to what? Similarly, it says, &#x201C;Yitro also did not understand,&#x201D; meaning Yitro and whoever else was present when he said this.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn97">29. A contemporary of Reb Simcha Buenem ZY&#x201D;A who was the author&#x2019;s Rebbe, and for a while a disciple of the Seer of Lublin.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn98">30. For the hidden treasures in the king&#x2019;s storehouse are not seen [hence, without reason], but are placed there because of their value and preciousness, because the king loves them. Also, a <italic>segula</italic> also means a ritual or action reputed to influence a certain good effect, yet with no obvious connection to the good effected, like smelling the wick of the <italic>havdalla</italic> candle after the <italic>havdalla</italic> ceremony is supposed to save one from anger, or a woman biting off the end of the <italic>etrog</italic> (citron) with the stem (<italic>pitom</italic>) after Succot is a <italic>segula</italic> for her to become pregnant, and there are countless others. The &#x201C;Tiferret Yosef,&#x201D; Mordechai Yosef Elazar, great-grandson of the Isbitser, in the first explanation of Shevuot, explains it in this way (first selection on Shevuot, p. 92). &#x201C;And you shall be My most beloved treasure [<italic>segula</italic>] out of all the peoples,&#x201D; meaning that then the blessed God will show Israel that the love of the blessed God for Israel is a kind of <italic>segula</italic>. This is as Rabeynu Moreynu ZL&#x201D;HH explained in the <italic>Mei HaShiloach</italic>, that <italic>segula</italic> is something without any discernible meaning, like the treasure house of a king, where no man knows how (immensely) precious the treasure really is. In this way the blessed God shows Israel that His love for Israel is without any meaning, and His love is above all order of Divine services.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn99">31. This is because the verse just mentioned &#x201C;peoples&#x201D;: &#x201C;you shall be My treasure from all the peoples, for all the earth is Mine.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn100">32. In the days of the Mishna, and still today in many Yemenite congregations, at the public Torah reading, each verse is followed with the translation of Onkles into Aramaic, which was then the spoken language of the day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn101">33. If God Himself is answering Moshe, then obviously the voice of the Creator and power of all the worlds should take precedence.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn102">34. For God, &#x201C;the translator,&#x201D; would never raise His voice, meaning illuminate His power into, anyone more than He did for Moshe, &#x201C;the reader.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn103">35. <italic>Caf</italic> added before a word means &#x201C;like.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn105">37. Re: &#x201C;New Age,&#x201D; or more properly, ancient; idolatry of earth forces.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn106">38. Meaning also taking a subordinate force in the world as the prime force.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn107">39. &#x201C;Before me,&#x201D; is literally &#x201C;at my face,&#x201D; and the word for &#x201C;superficial&#x201D; is literally &#x201C;to the face.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn108">40. The land of idolatry.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn109">41. In the first redemption God first made himself known to us as a nation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn110">42. As was said, this corresponds to <italic>Gevurah</italic> (strength), and at Mount Sinai it is said that, &#x201C;Moshe heard from the mouth of Gevurah.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn111">43. The <italic>succa</italic> is likened to the clouds of glory that followed us in the desert, signifying the fear of God, and so too the name &#x201C;E-lohim&#x201D; teaches of God&#x2019;s attribute of judgment that is the root of this fear.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn112">44. The word used is <italic>hirhur</italic>, a more primal, hidden stage than thought; perhaps it is more fittingly translated as a spark from the subconscious, as opposed to a tangible thought.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn113">45. The name of God <italic>YHVH</italic> has the same letters as &#x201C;being&#x201D;&#x2014;<italic>HAVAYE</italic> in Hebrew.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn114">46. This is the rendering of the Aramaic translation of Yesahya 6:3, &#x201C;and they called one to another.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn115">47. This is as one does to a sheep, meaning, shearing away all his coarseness and refining himself to be a vessel for Torah and <italic>Kedusha</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn116">48. This implies stages of a process. First there is renouncing the vanities and pleasures of the world, and adhering to the details of the Divine law. Second, one must guard himself in his adherence from possible sin. And third, he must take care that even though he sees himself as a vessel for the Torah from the outside, he may well harbor hidden deficiencies that may prevent him from his refinement.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn117">49. The Hebrew word for mention, <italic>zachar</italic>, is similar to the word for pure, <italic>zach</italic>, hence refinement.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn118">50. After twenty-four years Mordechai descended in rank among the sages.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn119">51. This is in the <italic>Mei HaShiloach</italic> on the Book of Hoshea, which says: A settled mind is called constant, and with such a manner it is always good to act. Acting quickly is called <italic>mequdash</italic>, sanctified, for sometimes quickness of action is a very good quality. It is such when one chooses to run to a matter of the words of Torah even if he does not yet know what he is running to, but still it is very good. On this, Shlomo haMelech said (Mishlei, 21:31), &#x201C;The horse is ready for the day of battle, and salvation is up to Hashem.&#x201D; This means that in the end the blessed God will save him and show him that his running to understand the truth of the words of Torah was in good judgment. This was the sin of the prophet Hoshea who said (<italic>Pesachim</italic>, 87a), &#x201C;exchange them [Israel] for a different people.&#x201D; [&#x201C;The Holy One, blessed be He said to Hoshea, &#x2018;Your children have sinned,&#x2019; to which he should have replied, &#x2018;They are Your children, they are the children of Your beloved ones, they are the children of Avraham, Yitschok, and Yaakov. Show them Your mercy.&#x2019; It was not enough that he did not say this, but he said to Him: &#x2018;Master of the Universe&#x0021; The whole world is yours. Exchange them for a different people. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, &#x2018;What shall I do with this old man [who does not know how to defend his people]? I will order him: &#x2018;Go and marry a whore and raise children of whoredom&#x2019;; and then I will order him: &#x2018;Send her away from your presence.&#x2019; If he will be able to send her away, then I too will send Israel away.&#x2019; For it is said, And the Lord said unto Hoshea, &#x2018;Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredom and children of whoredom,&#x2019; and it is written, &#x2018;So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Divlaim.&#x2019;&#x201D;] Hoshea said this out of the power of a settled mind. Then, after he realized that he had sinned, he said (Hoshea, 14:4), &#x201C;we will not ride upon horses,&#x201D; meaning that sometimes a mind that constantly exercises restraint is not always good. Therefore we must only rely upon Hashem and not on our intellect.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn120">52. &#x201C;Land&#x201D; represents the female, <italic>malchut</italic>, kingship, as it receives from the heavens above. So, too, <italic>malchut</italic> represents the entire community of Israel, as we are the bride, receiving from the Holy One, blessed be He.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn121">53. To dwell (<italic>lashevet</italic>) shares a root with settled mind (<italic>yishuv hadaat</italic>). His mind will be settled in knowing that God would never have given him obligations that are impossible to fulfill, that the world around man is also a product of God&#x2019;s will and inherent in it is the desire to be used by man in a state of <italic>Kedusha</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn122">54. Perhaps because he never knew how to separate the <italic>truma</italic> from the produce. <italic>Eyts Yosef</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn123">55. Who never ate <italic>truma</italic> in a state of <italic>Kedusha</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn124">56. This is like a precious object placed on a high shelf, either for protection or to sanctify or honor it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn125">57. The word for exulted shares the same root as the word for an offering, <italic>truma</italic>. The meaning is clear, that when the first thing to do with any received sustenance is to give the first portion to God; this is exulting God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn126">58. The Holy Zohar says, &#x201C;the blue of the <italic>t&#x2019;chellet</italic> hints at the blue of the sky which hints at the Throne of Glory.&#x201D; Thus it would inspire awe. Also, the Kotsker Rebbe explained the meaning of what Rebbe Nachman said, that looking at the sky is a <italic>segula</italic> for [way to come to] the fear of God. The Kotsker said, it has to do with Rashi&#x2019;s explanation of <italic>Bereshit</italic>, 1:6, &#x201C;let there be a firmament.&#x201D; Rashi says that then the firmament became solid, for on the first day it was still in a flexible. It only became solid on the second day at the shout of God, who said, &#x201C;let there be a firmanment.&#x201D; This is as it says (Job, 26:11), &#x201C;the pillars of the Heavens shook,&#x201D; for they were not firmly fixed on the first day, and then on the second, &#x201C;they were astonished at His rebuke,&#x201D; like a man who is shocked and stands still at the shout of one who frighens him.&#x201D; On this, the Kotsker said that when one looks at the firmament [sky] he can still feel the shout of the blessed God that fixed it in its place.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn127">59. On a weekday, <italic>Mincha</italic> is a time of an awakening of <italic>dinnim</italic>, or severe judgment. However, the <italic>Mincha</italic> prayer on the afternoon of Shabbat is a time of great mercies. Kabbalistically speaking, this is when Zeir Anpin and Leah ascend within Abba and Imma to the level of the rectifications of the beard of Arik Anpin, considered the supreme abode of divine compassion.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn128">60. The sound of the beating of the wings of 256 angels would surely inspire great fear of God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn129">61. The Hebrew term in many hasidic books is <italic>Tekofut</italic>, which is more than just strength, but a kind of <italic>azut d&#x2019;Kedusha</italic>, a kind of holy brazenness. This is what is meant whenever the phrases &#x201C;great empowerment&#x201D; or &#x201C;vigorous strength&#x201D; are used.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn130">62. 32 &#x003D; <italic>lev</italic> &#x003D; &#x201C;heart.&#x201D; Apparently it was a long cloth wrapped around the torso.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn131">63. For one must understand that there is no action in this world that does not have a remnant in the world to come. <italic>Tashlum Mei HaShiloach</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn132">64. <italic>Yud Hei</italic> are the first two letters in God&#x2019;s ineffable name, the Tetragrammaton. <italic>Yud Hei</italic> signifies transmission, while the second two letters <italic>Vav Hei</italic> imply reception. It is one of the basic principles of Kabbalah that <italic>Yud</italic> signifies <italic>Chochma</italic>, (Wisdom), while <italic>Hei</italic> signifies <italic>Binah</italic>, (Understanding), hinted-at in the right and left brain, hidden from sight, and requiring a further flow of execution to be brought into reality. This is why the author says that &#x201C;the depth of understanding in the words of Torah&#x201D; are hinted at in these two letters, and all the more so because they are revealed in the word <italic>pitdah</italic> only in the previous letters, signifiying a greater level of concealment that cannot be brought into a communicable form.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn133">65. Which is normally interpreted to mean that Uriah had sent Bat Sheva a bill of divorce before he went to war. However, the deeper meaning that is relevant here is that David was the paramount &#x201C;<italic>ba&#x2019;al tshuva</italic>,&#x201D; and when one undergoes an authentic experience of <italic>tshuva</italic>, then all his iniquities are turned into merits.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn134">66. See how this is explained above, page 53, &#x201C;and Yehuda drew close.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn135">67. Hirch translates &#x201C;I am a hasid&#x201D; with &#x201C;for I dedicate myself.&#x201D; Soncino comments, &#x201C;one who loves God and is therefore deserving of God&#x2019;s love.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn136">68. <italic>Chochma m&#x2019;vureret</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn137">69. The name <italic>E-lohim</italic> is written <italic>plene</italic> by <italic>Chochma m&#x2019;vureret</italic>. This is numerically equivalent to 295. Four times this is 1,180. This is one hundred more than the 1,080 mentioned above. The author is not using our normal &#x201C;sixty seconds to a minute&#x201D; calculation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn138">70. <italic>Tekifut</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn139">71. The Holy Isbitser does not say what the connection between <italic>achlama</italic> and the ability to bring Israel together in the name of God. But I will offer that <italic>achlama</italic> is the letters of <italic>ach l&#x2019;mah</italic> &#x201C;brother for MaH,&#x201D; where MaH the numerical equivalent of the expansion of God&#x2019;s name, which equals forty-five; hence, brotherhood in the name of God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn140">72. &#x201C;Troop&#x201D; signifies gathered together.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn141">73. And the body is the primary vehicle for man&#x2019;s expansion.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn142">74. There, in the <italic>Mei HaShiloach</italic> on <italic>Parshat Bereshit</italic>, it reads: The onyx (&#x201C;shoham&#x201D;) stone hints at the love of God, for it is the stone that corresponds to Yosef, who is the <italic>sefirah</italic> of <italic>Yesod</italic> (foundation), which is filled with Divine effusion (as it receives and collects all the Divine energies from the eight <italic>sefirot</italic> above it).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn143">75. The name of the stone jasper in Hebrew is the letters of &#x201C;he has a mouth.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn144">76. And how is incense the connection of all things? Besides the similarity in the letters of <italic>ketoret</italic> and &#x201C;connection,&#x201D; <italic>Ketirah</italic> in Aramaic, Rabbi Yitzhak of Acco writes in his explanation &#x201C;Meirat Eineihem&#x201D; that smoke, <italic>ashan</italic>, is an acronym for <italic>olam shana netesh</italic>, meaning place, time, and soul, the three main components of existence, as discussed in the <italic>Sefer Yetsirah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn145">77. The Gemara is talking about the mitzvah of the study of Torah, that foremost he is studying for his own benefit, and only after this for the good of the rest of the world.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn146">78. This means that all the vessels made from acacia wood are like actions that may be for selfish motives to gratify different parts of the body now, but will be refined for the sake of Heaven in the future.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn147">79. The knot of the head <italic>tefillin</italic> tied at the base of the skull.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn149">81. &#x201C;Back&#x201D; represents the past; &#x201C;face&#x201D; the present.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn150">82. And would thus confront irreconcilable differences.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn151">83. With the nations the sin reaches the depth of their soul.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn152">84. And at that time all will know the will of God with clarity.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn153">85. It is not yet a cow.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn154">86. If Moshe&#x2019;s prayer was answered, the knowledge of God would be equally accessible to all.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn155">87. One can only arrive at knowing the portion God has prepared for him through the results of his efforts and achievements.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn156">88. The Tetragrammaton, <italic>Yud Hei Vav Hei</italic>, has the same root as the word <italic>mehave</italic>, &#x201C;bring into being.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn157">89.

<chapter>
<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> V<small>AYIKRA</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And He called [</italic>Vayikra<italic>] to Moshe &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 1:1)</p>
<p>It is written in the Midrash (Tanchuma, <italic>Vayikra</italic>, 1), &#x201C;How many times does the Torah warn concerning respect for the convert? Forty-eight times, corresponding to the forty-eight times &#x2018;wellspring&#x2019; is written in the Torah.&#x201D; Connected to this, it is written in the Gemara (<italic>Rosh Hashana</italic>, 21b), &#x201C;Fifty gates to understanding were created in the world, and all were given to Moshe Rabeynu minus one.&#x201D; Thus we find that Moshe Rabeynu had forty-nine gates, and all the rest of Israel forty-eight, as it is not in their ability to reach the level of Moshe Rabeynu, for &#x201C;never will a prophet like Moshe arise again,&#x201D; so therefore they can only attain the forty-eighth gate. Corresponding to this, &#x201C;wellspring&#x201D; is written in the Torah forty-eight times, for a wellspring represents the desire and will for words of Torah, and by means of the desire and longing of a man for the words of Torah he may acquire all of the forty-eight gates.</p>
<p>Through this we can understand the intention of forty-eight warnings in the Torah to respect the convert. The convert came to bring himself close under the wings of the <italic>Shechina</italic> (Divine Presence) because of the great desire within him. For in the root of his life he is not cleaving to the blessed God, as cleaving to the blessed God at the source of life is a state of being only for those born of the seed of the Patriarchs. (It is solely from his great desire that brings him to a state of cleaving to God.) Corresponding to this there were forty-eight boards in the Mishkan (Tabernacle), and also concerning this it says in the holy Zohar (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 125a), &#x201C;each day forty-eight drops drip.&#x201D; This is the meaning of the verse, &#x201C;and He called [<italic>Vayikra</italic>] out to Moshe,&#x201D; for calling out is the desire and longing of the heart. Since the Holy One, blessed be He, put &#x201C;crying out&#x201D; and longing in the heart of Moshe more than in all the rest of Israel, he therefore merited the forty-ninth gate.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And He called to Moshe.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 1:1)</p>
<p>It is written (Yesahya, 65:24), &#x201C;And it will be, that before they shall call, and I will answer, they have not yet spoken, and I will hear.&#x201D; Since the blessed God answers, what is the need of speaking and asking? Calling implies desire and expectation, and He said, &#x201C;before they call I will answer.&#x201D; Thus before even the desire to speak comes to the heart of one who longs for God, the blessed God answers him and burns out of his heart all lusts and all desires for worldly things, thereby making room in his heart to expect and long for the will of the blessed God. After this preparation is made, he can then receive in his heart the desire and expectation for things other than God. And then, &#x201C;they have not yet spoken and I will hear.&#x201D; It was just like this when the Mishkan was completed, and it was written, &#x201C;and Moshe could not enter the tent of Meeting.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Moshe thought to himself that until now the way the blessed God dealt with Israel was through the words of Torah, and in this he was the chosen one to receive the Torah and teach it to Israel. But now the blessed God created a new opening in His relationship with Israel, and in this way Aharon the Cohen was the chosen one. Though Moshe Rabeynu truly had a good eye upon Aharon, still he greatly desired the word of God, and would sit expectantly waiting to hear it. This is, &#x201C;And He <italic>called</italic> to Moshe from the tent of Meeting.&#x201D; Since Moshe had no desire for anything (except the word of God), and his name teaches of this, for Moshe means to take out, &#x201C;for he was taken out of the water,&#x201D; water representing desire; therefore the blessed God chose him first for the words of Torah to be given from him. This is &#x201C;before they shall <italic>call</italic>, I will answer.&#x201D; Then afterward when he longed for and expected from God that the laws of the sacrifices would also be transmitted through him, this is &#x201C;before they have even spoken, and I will hear.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and God spoke to him &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 1:1)</p>
<p>God was telling him that though it is true that the performance of the Divine service for Aharon in particular, the transmission of God&#x2019;s word and commandments are only for him. This is understood from the way the word <italic>Vayikra</italic> is written in the Torah scroll with a small <italic>aleph</italic>, which shows how the direct reception of God&#x2019;s word went to Moshe Rabeynu, and thus he would not be jealous of Aharon, for his only intention would be to hear the Divine speech. This is as it is said (Iyov, 14:15), &#x201C;You will call and I will answer You, you will have a desire for the work of your hands.&#x201D; &#x201C;You will call&#x201D; means you have chosen me and given me yearning. &#x201C;And I will answer You&#x201D; means that then I am responsible for the materialization of your word in order to be drawn after Your will. &#x201C;You will have a desire for the work of your hands,&#x201D; means that since you (Moshe) have a desire for the completion of the work of your hands, therefore I (God) will ask you to do so.</p>
<p>The explanation of, &#x201C;and it will be that before they will call and I will answer them, even before they speak I will hear them,&#x201D; (Yeshiyahu, 65:24, see previous selection) has to do with two ways in which God may answer prayer, and both of them are not good. The first is explained in the Gemara (<italic>Ta&#x2019;anit</italic>, 25b), where one is immediately answered even before he wants to pray, as is explained there. The second is only being answered after much pleading.<sup><xref rid="fn159">1</xref></sup> Therefore first it is said, &#x201C;before they call I will answer them,&#x201D; and only after, &#x201C;even before they speak,&#x201D; for then I will hear with complete desire. This is as it is said in the Gemara (ibid.), &#x201C;they said, &#x2018;let the wind blow,&#x2019; and the wind blew. They said, &#x2018;let the rain fall,&#x2019; and the rain fell.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, a man who offers of you a sacrifice to Hashem&#x2014;of the cattle, of the heard, of the flock you shall you offer your sacrifice.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 1:2)</p>
<p>The verse is not formulated &#x201C;a man of you who offers a sacrifice&#x201D; but &#x201C;a man who offers of you.&#x201D; This is in order to teach that when one offers a sacrifice to God, he should not do it with the desire for elevation to be higher than his fellow. Rather he should enter himself into the state of being equal with all of Israel.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; you shall offer your sacrifice.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 1:2)</p>
<p>&#x201C;You shall offer,&#x201D; meaning that every one of Israel who truly discourses in the Torah for the sake of Heaven will merit a wise son or sagacious student. This is also the meaning of the verse (Malachi, 3:16), &#x201C;then those who fear God will speak, one to his friend, and God will listen, and hear (understand), and write a book of memory before Him, for those who fear God and contemplate His name.&#x201D; The &#x201C;book of memory&#x201D; of the Holy One, blessed be He, is when the word is engraved in the heart of Israel. This occurs when one truly cares enough for his friends that he also wants to effuse to them the good he has merited from the blessed God. This is &#x201C;then those who fear God will speak, one to his friend, and God will listen, and hear [understand],&#x201D; meaning to turn and fulfill His will with all he has been given from the Holy One, blessed be He, in order to engrave it within the hearts of Israel.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Each of your Mincha [meal] offerings you shall season with salt, you shall not cease the salt of the covenant with your God from your Mincha offerings, you shall salt all your sacrifices.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 2:13)</p>
<p>This is the opposite of good, for it will not foster expansion and growth of good, as a salted land does not produce. Yet it is something that can be combined with good, and that can add meaning to good (as salt adds flavor to food). In this way, the Hebrew word for a ship&#x2019;s pilot, <italic>malach</italic> (sailor), is the same word for mixed, <italic>memulach</italic>, as he &#x201C;mixes&#x201D; the water in the act of steering the ship. (See the verses of the incense, <italic>Shemot</italic> 30:35, where Rashi explains, <italic>memulach</italic>, salted, as meaning mixed.) Concerning this it says, &#x201C;each of your Mincha [meal] offerings you shall season with salt,&#x201D; meaning that a man must deeply connect himself to the blessed God and not separate himself through anything of this world, but rather refine his connection as much as possible with good understanding and consciousness.</p>
<p>This concerns the actions of Amatsiya king of Yehuda, who, after slaying 10,000 Edomites in battle, and then driving 10,000 Edomite captives over a cliff, went and served the idols of Edom. Afterward he sent a message to Yoash, king of Israel, saying, &#x201C;let us see each other face to face&#x201D; (Divrei haYamim 2, 25:17). Edom is the foremost of the <italic>klipot</italic> (forces of evil), greater in stature than that of all the other nations. This is mentioned in the Gemara of <italic>Avoda Zara</italic> (2b), where it describes how when God calls all the nations before Him, raising a Torah scroll and proclaiming, &#x201C;let all the nations that occupied themselves in this come forward,&#x201D; then Edom will come directly after Israel because of its importance. Right after this <italic>klipa</italic>, Israel begins. At present, Israel is not given permission to rule over them, but only in the future, as will be explained in its place. Amatsiya&#x2019;s killing 20,000 Edomites signifies the ten levels in this <italic>klipah</italic>, one above the other. Twenty thousand hints at this, meaning ten levels from below to above, and above to below. Amatsiya thought that since he had vanquished them so strongly that surely with every subsequent action he would not remove his heart from God, and no evil force would have the strength to overpower him, as it will be in the future.</p>
<p>Therefore he experimented with serving the gods of Edom and sent to Yoash, king of Israel, &#x201C;let us see each other face to face.&#x201D; In this he was saying, &#x201C;even though I have done something that seems evil, nonetheless I am still more deeply connected to the blessed God than you are.&#x201D; Since this was not the blessed God&#x2019;s will, he was punished and Yoash king of Israel captured him. And yet, it says there (verse 25), that Amatsiya lived fifteen years after the death of Yoash, which hints that in the fifteen levels existing within Israel Amatsiya was greater than Yoash, and his sin was only according to the border of man&#x2019;s understanding. For those who understand the matters of the Kingdom of the House of David, know that all the kings of Yehuda are greatly beloved by the blessed God, and all their actions cannot be understood according to their surface meaning. One who understands Yeshayahu (7:3), &#x201C;And God said to Yeshayahu, please go out toward Ahaz,&#x201D; sees that &#x201C;please&#x201D; is a polite form of request, as with a father who had done evil to his son and estranged him, the father will try to appease him.</p>
<p>This is as Achaz said (Yeshayahu, 7:12), &#x201C;and Achaz said, I will not ask nor will I tempt God,&#x201D; like a son trying to free himself from sin before his father. Also with Menashe, who was born with a sense of the fear of God so overwhelming that the mortal mind cannot stand it, and so all the kings had great fear, though it was not in a state where it could be controlled. His entire sin was because he wanted to remove from himself this state of the fear of God, and in every instance the fear of the blessed God only became more clear to him. The exception is David haMelech, who was born with the attribute of love, and this was the primary attribute for which he was recognized, as is known.</p>

<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And the</italic> Cohen <italic>shall wear linen garments, and linen pants shall he wear on his flesh, [and he shall raise the ashes from where the fire has consumed the sacrifice on the altar, and he shall place them beside the altar].&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 6:3)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Garment,&#x201D; (this is a special word for garment used only for the <italic>Cohen</italic>) is the <italic>ctonet</italic>, which makes atonement for anger (<italic>Arachin</italic>, 17a) and the spilling of blood. &#x201C;And linen pants,&#x201D; corresponds to lust, for the pants make atonement for forbidden sexual relations. These both hint that one who is clean regarding anger and lust may come close to the blessed God.<sup><xref rid="fn160">2</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;[And the</italic> Cohen <italic>shall wear linen garments, and linen pants shall he wear on his flesh,] and he shall raise the ashes from where the fire has consumed the sacrifice on the altar, and he shall place them beside the altar.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 6:3)</p>
<p>The removal of the ashes, where he would fill the coal pan with the inside ashes of the consumed sacrifice, teaches of the fear of God. &#x201C;And he shall place them by the altar,&#x201D; on the east side of the ramp, signifies how with the spark (point) of life among the nations, with the choicest of them, their main point is their fear. &#x201C;As she has made fear her crown, so she has made meekness the sole of her foot&#x201D; (Yerushalmi, <italic>Shabbat</italic>, Ch. 1, halacha 5). That is to say, what for them is their crown, the <italic>Cohen</italic> does before every time he performs the service. Yet it says, &#x201C;and he shall place them,&#x201D; of which our sages explained (<italic>Pesachim</italic>, 28a), gently, &#x201C;so as not to scatter them, but that they shall be hidden in their place.&#x201D; This means not to deride this attribute, as our sages said (<italic>Berachot</italic>, 33b), &#x201C;is the fear of Heaven a small thing?&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Speak to the children of Israel and say, he that offers the sacrifice of his peace offering unto God shall bring his sacrifice to God out of the sacrifice of his peace offerings. His hands shall bring the fire offerings of God, he will bring the fat with the breast, the breast to wave as a wave offering before God.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 7:29&#x2013;30)</p>
<p>All of the sacrifices are set according to prayers, which is the service of the heart. Indeed, with all of the (other) sacrifices, &#x201C;he shall bring his sacrifice &#x2026; <italic>his</italic> hands shall bring&#x201D; is not said, since those who bring the sacrifices do not have a portion in them.<sup><xref rid="fn161">3</xref></sup> With an <italic>olah</italic>, or ascent offering, even the <italic>Cohanim</italic> cannot partake of them (as they are burned on the altar in their entirety). With all of the sacrifices and the prayers brought close before God, before they are offered the one bringing them must first remove all affliction from his side, and concerning this it is said that he shall bring &#x201C;the fire offerings of God,&#x201D; meaning to no other than God alone. That is why in this <italic>Parsha</italic>, which teaches of the eating of sacrifices, the verses mention &#x201C;fire&#x201D; several times, for fire teaches of the great fear of God, as it consumes everything. This <italic>Parsha</italic> is the garment in this world for the River Dinor in the world of Atsulut.<sup><xref rid="fn162">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Therefore before each prayer for any kind of good one could ask from God, one must precede it with the complete acceptance of the yoke of the kingdom of Heaven. This is precisely why we recite the <italic>Shema</italic> before praying the <italic>Amida.</italic> The recitation of the <italic>Shema</italic> hints at the removal of affliction from the side of man,<sup><xref rid="fn163">5</xref></sup> for the <italic>Shema</italic> hints that man exists only by the will of the blessed God alone. This is as Shlomo haMelech said (Melachim 1, 8:39), &#x201C;[Man] whose heart You know,&#x201D; meaning that if this good that you ask for is really for the glory of God, in order to do the will of your Owner, then He will hear you. However, if the good you request contains within it something that would prevent you from serving God, then He will not listen to you.</p>
<p>This is from God&#x2019;s point of view, but man may go ahead and pray, as long as he first accepts upon himself the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven, as mentioned, for truly God desires to improve, and not to cast away any prayer of Israel to irrecoverable exile. This notion refers to the rest of the forms of sacrifice, but the <italic>Shlamim</italic> peace-offering sacrifice teaches that man prays to the blessed God that He may allow him to taste of the good that is hidden for him in the world to come. This is because he wants to see his place, to see to whom he is greater in comparison, for he desires a state of spiritual elevation. On this it is said, &#x201C;he shall bring his offering &#x2026; his hands shall bring [the fire offerings of God].&#x201D; This means to deliver over all his requests and prayers to the blessed God, and not plead with brazenness, for from this it could happen that he could become indebted to his fellow man. At present he seems to be on a similar level as his fellow, and afterward he is elevated above him. Yet truly, in the future all of Israel will set in a place as one, and each one will show how he is in some way elevated above the rest of Israel. Nonetheless, each one is &#x201C;burned by the canopy of his fellow.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn164">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>This is as it is in this world, where there are many forms of wisdom, and one shows superiority in this kind, and another in that kind. Each one&#x2019;s elevation is not equal, but rather according to the value of that in which he shows superiority. And in the future, even though it will all be in the realm of the Torah, still, great matters will be found where one&#x2019;s kind of elevation is not at all similar to his fellow&#x2019;s. This is taught through how it is formulated, &#x201C;his hands shall bring,&#x201D; meaning with two hands. If a man wants to taste from the good that is reserved for him in the world to come, and asks the blessed God to show him his place, then he must be clean. Then if the blessed God shows him that he is smaller in stature than someone whom it seemed to him that he was greater than in this world (if he is clean), it will not distress him. But if he does not pray over this matter in this world, it could be that he is greater than his fellow all the while in this world, and in the future he will not be at all distressed that he is now greater than his fellow. This too is a favor of God, who arranged that in this world he should become greater than his fellow. But, if he should want to make certain of this, it could be that he makes certain that he is smaller than his fellow, and it could be that he sinks lower than his fellow.</p>
<p>Thus if he wants to make certain, he may still ask (for elevation) and it will not distress him, since he wanted to know it clearly, as we find with Mordechai (<italic>Megillah</italic>, 16b), &#x201C;For at first Mordechai was counted next after four, but afterward next after five.&#x201D; (At first it is written [Ezra, 2:2], Who came with Zerubabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordechai, Bilshan, and later it is written [Nechemya, 7:7], Who came with Zerubabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordechai, Bilshan.) This is &#x201C;and his hands shall bring,&#x201D; for it is with two hands, right and left. Right, for it could be that he is elevated. Left, for it could be that he is brought low by means of this prayer. And if a man agrees that he wants to make certain, even if he makes certain that he is smaller in stature, it will not trouble him, and he will subdue himself before his fellow who is greater than him. He will be put at ease by knowing clearly where his place is. Then he can bring the slaughter of his <italic>Shlamim</italic> peace offerings. This is &#x201C;his hands shall bring&#x201D;&#x2014;toward this end. Understand this.</p>

<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> S<small>HMINI</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And it was, on the eighth day &#x2026; and Nadav and Avihu, Aharon&#x2019;s sons, each took a censer &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 9:1, 10:1)</p>
<p>The death of Nadav and Avihu concerns what is said in the <italic>Pirkei Avot</italic> (and Masechet <italic>Tamid</italic>, 32b), &#x201C;who is wise? He who sees what will be born in the future.&#x201D; On the one hand, we are told (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 18:13), &#x201C;be honest [simple] with Hashem your God,&#x201D; which means not to be overly clever (becoming involved in predictions of the future). Yet still, we are to fulfill the advice of &#x201C;seeing what is born in the future.&#x201D; One does this by looking into the very action he is doing, deeply investigating and contemplating whether this action is refined to the extent that it will endure for all time, even in the world to come. The matter of the incense offering<sup><xref rid="fn165">7</xref></sup> is as is said in the holy Zohar (<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 151b), &#x201C;what is incense [<italic>ketoret</italic>]? It is the connection [<italic>ketira</italic>] of everything.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn166">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>This means that the blessed God is involved in all the actions that are done from the creation of the world until its end, and without His will nothing could be done. The incense teaches of this, as it taught in the <italic>Mei HaShiloach</italic> in <italic>Parshat Tetsave</italic> (v. &#x201C;and he made&#x201D;). For truly, the closer a man brings himself to the blessed God, the more he merits the light of God without its garments, which are the borders and fences that protect the Divine Law. The light itself is in a state of total refinement, with no fences or prohibitions, and there it is made totally clear that all the actions of man are wholly given over to God. This is the matter of the incense, which is a secret of the Torah and forbidden to delve into with craftiness. With the four sages who entered the garden (<italic>Chagiga</italic>, 14b, the mystic plane of Divine secrets uncovered) only Rabbi Akiva left in peace (one died, one stricken with madness, one abandoned the Torah).</p>
<p>This is why it says of Nadav and Avihu (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 16:1), &#x201C;who came close before God and died,&#x201D; for they would bring themselves close to God, looking into the hidden depths, and wanted to stand on the refined, undressed truth of the conduct of the blessed God. This is why the cantillation marking on the word &#x201C;not&#x201D; [<italic>lo</italic>] in the verse, &#x201C;which He commanded them not&#x201D; (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 10:1) is a <italic>mercha c&#x2019;foola.</italic></p>
<p>This shows how their hearts burned with such an intense love of God that they gave over their very lives, for <italic>mercha</italic> is related to <italic>rach</italic>, or soft, that their hearts became weak; and <italic>cfoola</italic>, or <italic>cfool</italic>, meaning double, or an increase of good that the blessed God did not command. Since they were young, they were not included together with Moshe and Aharon, as it is said in the holy Zohar (<italic>Shemot</italic>, 37b), &#x201C;they did not take their [Moshe and Aharon&#x2019;s] advice.&#x201D;</p>
<p>On this there is the difference of opinion in the Gemara (on what advice they disregarded). &#x201C;One says they were drunk from wine,&#x201D; claiming that they came to this state of intense closeness and became, God forbid, irreverent. Thus their intention was to remove all borders, as is explained, and here we have (the other advice that they disregarded in) the Midrash, which says that they entered missing some of the priestly garments. The missing garment was the <italic>me&#x2019;il</italic>, the coat (made entirely of <italic>t&#x2019;chellet</italic>, sky-blue wool, teaching of the intense fear of God, see <italic>Mei HaShiloach Parshat Tetsave</italic>) (<italic>Vayikra</italic> Rabba, 20:6). Even though the <italic>me&#x2019;il</italic> is only for the high priest, they brought themselves to a place where they needed to wear the <italic>me&#x2019;il</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn167">9</xref></sup> and understand.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And for the goat of the sin offering Moshe diligently inquired &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 10:16)</p>
<p>(&#x201C;Diligently inquired,&#x201D; Rashi explains. &#x201C;Two inquiries. Why was this one burned, and why were these not eaten?&#x201D;) Why did he make two inquiries? This matter is hinted at in the Gemara (<italic>Sanhedrin</italic>, 106b), &#x201C;concerning Doag and Achitophel who learned three hundred laws in the castle floating in the air hinted at in the &#x2018;roof&#x2019; of the letter <italic>lamed.&#x201D;</italic> (The letter <italic>lamed</italic> reaches higher than the other letters of the alphabet, and thus its roof is called a &#x201C;castle floating in the air.&#x201D;) The letter <italic>lamed</italic> teaches of a settled mind, and an understanding of the order in all the prohibitive commandments along with the uncertainties that arise from all these prohibitions. It also teaches of a settled mind in that it graphically represents the last turn in the swallowing of food from the palate into the esophagus and the body, as if to show the understanding of the proper place for the food to go. This is as Aharon answered him (<italic>Zevachim</italic>, 101a), &#x201C;Perhaps you have heard of the special sacrifices of the hour, and have not heard of the regular sacrifices for all generations.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn168">10</xref></sup> This is as it says, &#x201C;and Moshe diligently inquired,&#x201D; and he answered Moshe, &#x201C;even if you have inquired all that you need to, still you are not to be lenient with the sacrifices for all generations.&#x201D; This is why this passage follows the incident of the death of the sons of Aharon, for he saw that his sons were punished for wanting to look into hidden and future matters. From this we learn the stringency of the sacrifices for all generations, and how greatly beloved they are by the blessed God. Therefore they are not to be eaten. After the great tragedy they had undergone with the death of Nadav and Avihu, they merited to be given further boundaries to separate themselves with the following commandments of forbidden foods.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Moshe heard, and it was well in his eyes.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 10:20)</p>
<p>Afterward Moshe understood the matter, for Aharon had done well in not eating the goat offering of the new moon. Yet still, it was a wonder to Moshe how Aharon knew to make such a judgment. Is it not so that after all of the inquiries he should have eaten it, as it is written (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 10:18), &#x201C;you shall surely eat it in the holy place as I have commanded,&#x201D; until Aharon answered him with the matter of the death of Nadav and Avihu. This subject contains great depths, for the goat offering of the new moon hints at bringing atonement for reduction in size of the moon.<sup><xref rid="fn169">11</xref></sup> The first goat of the new moon was burned, for Aharon did not want to eat it, and from here Moshe understood until now. The matter is very deep.</p>
<p>The outward signs of pure birds. It is written in the Gemara (<italic>Chullin</italic>, 65a), &#x201C;[These are the signs of a pure bird.] It does not seize its prey, it has a crop, a gizzard that can be peeled, and an extra toe.&#x201D; These four signs are hinted at in the soul of man. &#x201C;Siezing its prey&#x201D; is explained by the Gemara as a bird that eats its prey immediately once it is captured, and does not wait until its prey dies. This teaches of anger. The second explanation of &#x201C;seizing its prey&#x201D; is that it clutches its prey with its claws while it eats, which teaches of a lack of trust in God, for it fears that the good that was given to it will be taken away. So, too, man must be clean in these two matters, not to become angry, and to trust in God. &#x201C;An extra toe&#x201D; teaches of a settled mind. By means of its toe it pushes its attention away from that which has become habitual,<sup><xref rid="fn170">12</xref></sup> hinting at the ability to contain itself when it wants to fulfill its own will, lest it finds itself comfortably settling into old habits. &#x201C;A crop&#x201D; teaches of being filled with the words of Torah, for after it has eaten its fill it places the remainder inside its crop, as a reminder to benefit from it afterward. This is as it is written in the Gemara (<italic>Berachot</italic>, 28a), &#x201C;When Rabbi Zeira was exhausted from his study of the Torah, he would go and sit in front of the door of Rabbi Natan bar Tovi, for when the sages would exit, he would stand in their honor. In this way he did not sit idle even for a moment.&#x201D; &#x201C;A gizzard that can be peeled&#x201D; means not to let the power in the food spread into the body and cause any deviation, God forbid, from God. This also hints that the preciousness of the Torah scholar is concealed, for there is no comparison between the preciousness of his study in this world and the supreme preciousness of its light in the world to come.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Yet these you may eat of every flying creeping that goes on four [legs], which has legs above their feet, and uses them to leap on the earth.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 11:21)</p>
<p>This is similar to the matter discussed in the Gemara (<italic>Berachot</italic>, 33a), &#x201C;Great is knowledge, since it is placed between two names of God [&#x201C;For a God of knowledge is God,&#x201D; Shmuel 1, 2:3]. Great is the Sanctuary [Mikdash], since it is placed between two names [&#x201C;You have made, O God, the Sanctuary, O God,&#x201D; <italic>Shemot</italic>, 15:17]. In refutation to this, one said, if so, you could also say, great is vengeance, since it is placed between two names [&#x201C;God of Vengeance is God,&#x201D; Tehillim, 94:1].&#x201D; Meaning, the heavens corresponds to knowledge, and the Sanctuary (Mikdash) is that which is constantly surrounded by the will of God. This is &#x201C;placed between two names of God.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn171">13</xref></sup> Yet it is not so with vengeance, for vengeance is not always good. One must calculate the proper time, place, and person regarding the vengeance, for it must be set in accordance with the will of the blessed God, for it is not always proper in God&#x2019;s view.</p>
<p>We find this in the incident with Pinchas and Zimri. Pinchas had to consider his intentions carefully (and in a split second). Even though the law says &#x201C;zealots may harm them,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn172">14</xref></sup> this was one of the ten miracles performed for Pinchas at that time, for if Zimri had separated and risen up to kill Pinchas, he would not have been punished (<italic>Sanhedrin</italic>, 82a), as is explained. This is the inner meaning of &#x201C;that has legs above its feet, and uses them to jump,&#x201D; meaning that a man must have the power in the aspect of vengeance at times, where he must intend the exact moment that is the will of the blessed God. Then he must have the ability to immediately &#x201C;leap&#x201D; and jump from this mode of behavior, where afterward no remnant of anger and hatred will be left in his heart. Understand.</p>
<p>Signs of Pure Animals. &#x201C;Whatever has parted hooves, is cloven footed, and chews the cud, of these you may eat&#x201D; (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 11:2). &#x201C;Chews the cud&#x201D; means one who does not snatch the good from the blessed God, and is always willing to return it. Even if he has already received it he is ready to return it, and he only receives it in a pleasant way. &#x201C;That has parted hooves&#x201D; means that his hands do not jump to seize that which the blessed God has allotted him, and this comes out of his great trust in God. &#x201C;That has parted hooves&#x201D; hints at this, as it is written (Tehillim, 18:37), &#x201C;You have enlarged my steps under me,&#x201D; meaning that he stands in a wide space.</p>
<p>Of the Camel it is written, &#x201C;since it chews the cud but is not cloven-footed,&#x201D; in the present tense. With the badger it is written, &#x201C;and it will not split its foot,&#x201D; in the future tense. And with the rabbit it is written, &#x201C;it has not split its foot,&#x201D; in the past tense. The camel teaches of quickness (rather, undue haste). This is what is said in the Gemara (<italic>Shabbat</italic>, 104a), &#x201C;for what reason is the face of the letter <italic>gimmel</italic>&#x2014;<span dir="rtl">&#x05D2;</span>?&#x2014;turned toward the letter that follows it, <italic>dalet</italic>&#x2014;<span dir="rtl">&#x05D3;</span> For it is the nature of those who do acts of kindness (&#x201C;<italic>gomlei chassidim</italic>&#x2014;the same letters as <italic>gimel</italic>, and the same letters for camel, <italic>gamal</italic>) to run after the the poor (poor, <italic>dal</italic> is the same letters as <italic>dalet</italic>).&#x201D; When the kindness goes to a place that it is not warranted it is a result of undue haste, and also finds no favor in the surrounding creation. Therefore of the camel (<italic>gamal</italic>, the same as <italic>gomlei chassadim</italic>, those who do kindness, and the letter <italic>gimel</italic>), the nature of its hoof is expressed in the present tense, for immediately at the time of the action one sees that it is not proper. This is the nature of the letter <italic>gimel</italic>&#x2014;for when it is spelled with a <italic>yud</italic> [<italic>gimel yud mem lamed</italic>] it means acts of kindness&#x2014;<italic>gemilut chassadim</italic>&#x2014;and when it is not spelled with a <italic>yud</italic> it teaches of undue haste, called <italic>gamal</italic>, the camel.</p>
<p>The badger teaches of a quality that appears to others as humility and a settled mind, yet truly it is behavior that God did not choose (meaning it is not genuine). This is discussed above in <italic>Parshat Beshalach</italic> on the verse (<italic>Shemot</italic>, 16:20), &#x201C;and some of them left it [the manna] until morning, and it bred worms, and became loathsome.&#x201D; That is, they fancied themselves as being humble in leaving it over, on the chance that the next day God would not consider them worthy to have given them manna, and then on the morrow they would still have some. This is defunct humility, which the blessed God did not choose, for one should not view himself as being the least important, and in this they took themselves out of the community of Israel, where all of Israel is worthy, and only they are not. To the human eye this would at first appear to be an expression of the good qualities of a settled mind and humility. At the time of the action (of their deeming themselves unworthy) it would find favor in the view of their surrounding community. However, in the view of the blessed God it is not proper, and of this it is said (<italic>Shemot</italic> 16:20), &#x201C;and it bred worms and became loathsome,&#x201D; for worm teaches of the quality of humility, as David haMelech said (Tehillim, 22:7), &#x201C;and I am a worm.&#x201D; However, the humility of David haMelech was favorable in the blessed God&#x2019;s sight, yet of them, it is written, &#x201C;and it became loathsome.&#x201D; Thus the sign of impurity for the badger is written in the future tense, for even though such an action appears favorable (appears to come from true humility and a settled mind) at the time of the action, it will later become clear that it was not a good attribute.</p>
<p>The rabbit teaches of brazenness. Even though he sees within himself that there is no root of life, nevertheless he wants things to go according to his will. This is brazenness toward Heaven. This is explained concerning the evil Bilaam, for even though the Holy One, blessed be He, told him not to go, nonetheless he was obstinate, and this is proof that there is a deficiency at the root (and thus, in the past). This is why the rabbit&#x2019;s sign of impurity is mentioned in the past tense.</p>

<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;A woman who conceives and gives birth to a man-child &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 12:2)</p>
<p>It is said in the Midrash (<italic>Vayikra</italic> Rabba, 14:2), &#x201C;I will raise my consciousness from far away, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker&#x201D; (Job, 36:3). Rabbi Natan says (interprets this), &#x2018;we think on the name of Avraham, who came from afar.&#x2019;&#x201D; We have written (in the blessing before the morning recitation of <italic>Shema</italic>), &#x201C;Maker of new things,&#x201D; &#x201C;Who in His goodness renews continually the work of creation.&#x201D; The question can be simply put; what new expeience is there if He constantly renews the creation each day? Then the renewal will also become expected, commonplace, and what renewal do we experience? Yet the matter is, that the blessed God takes the commonplace nature of constant renewal, and makes it ever new and fresh in our minds. We experience the renewal at every moment, and a feeling of wonderment comes to the heart of all who long for Him in everything, and on everything we ask, &#x201C;who created these?&#x201D; (v Yesahya, 40:26).</p>
<p>This is just as Avraham Avinu did. The world had been active for some years before Avraham Avinu arrived, yet there was no one to ask or wonder at the nature of its workings. But in the heart of Avraham Avinu it was a great wonder (<italic>Bereshit</italic> Rabba, 39:1), and he asked, &#x201C;for could you say there is a city without a master? Who is the master of the city?&#x201D; The Holy One, blessed be He saw that his question was not like a natural scientist or astronomer, but as one who truly wanted to know who had created all of these in order to serve Him. God saw how out of this longing to know he even despised the ephemeral delights of the world. Seeing this, the blessed God found it necessary to reveal Himself to Avraham, and to show him that He, may He be blessed, is the master of the city. On this it says, &#x201C;a woman who conceives,&#x201D; for in the supernal worlds to term, &#x201C;born of woman,&#x201D; denotes a lower level of creation. We find this in the Gemara (<italic>Shabbat</italic>, 88b, when Moshe ascended to Heaven to receive the Torah, and the angels asked), &#x201C;what is one born of woman doing among is?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn173">15</xref></sup> So it is said, &#x201C;a woman who conceives,&#x201D; meaning one who has true desire, with strength and vigor, for the blessed God. &#x201C;And gives birth to a man-child,&#x201D; for the giving birth to a male symbolizes the truest form of salvation, as all the good qualities of the world are included in the soul of the Israelite man.</p>
<p>This is the meaning of the Midrash, &#x201C;we think on the name of Avraham Avinu,&#x201D; meaning that Avraham himself realized that there is One in charge of the world, and we too can recognize this if we concentrate our minds on Avraham and contemplate his path. This is because the awakening experienced in the heart of Avraham will cause great wonderment in the eyes of all who understand why he caused such a stir and storm in his heart in order to know who created the world and its fullness. How many thousands of souls preceeded Avraham and it did not occur to one of them to ask this.</p>
<p>So from this very awakening itself one may understand that there is a Creator and Master, for the desire that came to the heart of Avraham Avinu was only what the blessed God had sent to his heart. If this awakening had been a kind of natural phenomenon then why did it not awaken in the whole world? This is why the Midrash says, &#x201C;we think on the name of Avraham Avinu,&#x201D; because &#x201C;name&#x201D; signifies will (desire). In a practical sense we find that some people are called on the name of their actions and artistry, since all their will and desire is included in the action that they are doing. Also, the numerical value of <italic>sh&#x2019;mo</italic>, &#x201C;his name,&#x201D; is the same as that of <italic>ratson</italic>, &#x201C;will&#x201D; or &#x201C;desire&#x201D; (both equal 356). This is &#x201C;I will draw my consciousness from afar,&#x201D; from the name of Avraham Avinu, &#x201C;and to my Maker I will ascribe righteousness [recognizing Him as the Artisan of all creation based on the initial awakening from Avraham].&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;A woman who conceives and gives birth to a man-child &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 12:2)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Will I break [bring to birth] and not complete the birth, says Hashem, and If I have completed the birth, have I then shut the womb, said your God&#x201D; (Yesahya, 66:9). At first it is expressed in the future, &#x201C;will I bring to birth [break], and not complete,&#x201D; and afterward it is expressed in the past, &#x201C;have I shut the womb?&#x201D; At first, when one begins to bring himself close to the blessed God, then the blessed God hides His light from him in order to refine his desire. This continues until he breaks his heart and recognizes his deficiencies. By means of this he merits the blessed God&#x2019;s revelation of words of Torah more and more according to his desire, until the Holy One, blessed be He, gives him at his full capacity. This is the meaning of the phrase &#x201C;will I break.&#x201D; At the beginning of the process of his coming close I have broken his heart with the concealment of the Divine Countenance, in order to intensify his cry for Godliness and refine him so that he can merit salvation. &#x201C;And shall not complete the birth&#x201D; is expressed in the future. At this point the heart of man does not yet believe that he will be born and merit salvation, because of the power of the concealment of Godliness. Then, after he has merited salvation in great abundance, he realizes that the blessed God was with him from the beginning until the end. This is &#x201C;if I have completed the birth,&#x201D; past tense, &#x201C;have shut the womb.&#x201D; He then realizes that there was no real Concealment of Godliness. He then understands that also at the beginning when he had this great cry of the spirit, this too originated from the power of the blessed God, who had built for him this entire salvation by means of the concealment. This is as it is written in Divrei haYamim (1, 28:9), &#x201C;If you seek it, you shall find.&#x201D; For if man has merited that God should find him (or reveal His light to him) certainly it is not by chance, but rather coming to this level of salvation was prepared for him from the very moment he was created (or the beginning of all creation). Nonetheless, from the side of man, he has choice, as it is written, &#x201C;if you [choose to] seek it,&#x201D; and this is a great wonder. This is also the wonder of this <italic>Parsha</italic>, &#x201C;a woman who conceives and gives birth to a man-child,&#x201D; for one cannot refine this depth. It is impossible that the alacrity of your desire will give birth to the salvation that seems as if it is by chance, and dependent on your choice. In fact, the true salvation was actually prepared this way by the blessed God from the beginning of creation. This is &#x201C;and gives birth to a man-child,&#x201D; meaning salvation that has been arranged from the beginning of creation.<sup><xref rid="fn174">16</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;A woman who conceives and gives birth to a man-child, she shall be unclean for seven days &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 12:2)</p>
<p>The reason for this impurity is understood by way of a parable. One comes with a request before a king, and writes his request on a crumpled scrap of paper. Even though he requested properly, and deserved what he had requested, and also the king answered him favorably, nonetheless, the king commands that he be imprisoned because he wrote his request on such inferior paper. Thus it is with a man&#x2019;s prayer before the blessed God. At first it springs from physical events in this world, which was in a state of greatly constricted understanding and consciousness. By means of constricting himself in his reception of the benefits and delights of this world, the resulting response from the blessed God is to grant him everlasting life.</p>
<p>This is the explanation of &#x201C;a woman who conceives&#x201D; for prayer is signified by the term &#x201C;conception.&#x201D; Just as it seems to the one who sows a seed as if he has lost what he has, only he expects to gain afterward much more from the little he had set aside to sow. So too, &#x201C;and gave birth to a man-child,&#x201D; that by means of his prayer he merits that the blessed God gives him salvation, which is everlasting life without end. &#x201C;She shall be unclean for seven days&#x201D; means that his prayer came through the vehicle of the physical events of this world, similar to the parable mentioned above.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, or a scab &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 13:2)</p>
<p>It is written in the holy Zohar (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 48a), &#x201C;there are many terms for man, and <italic>adam</italic> is above them all.&#x201D; The term for man, <italic>ish</italic>, is in relation to the term for woman, <italic>isha. Isha</italic> means that she does not have the power to subdue the desire of her heart. <italic>Ish</italic> means that when he experiences longings and desires, he can overpower them. However, the term for man, <italic>adam</italic>, means a state of elevation above all lusts and desires, that no lust or desire will enter his heart save that which is the will of the blessed God. The term <italic>adam</italic> is used here in the passage discussing the procedure for treating biblical leprosy, for leprosy teaches of one who has a deficiency concerning anger. Such is the attribute (deficiency) most prevalent among great men, since they derive no satisfaction from the good of this world, and the good that is prepared for them in the world to come is hidden from them in this world. The advice given to deal with this problem is to strengthen oneself in looking at the rest of the world with a good eye (judging it favorably).</p>
<p>There are three sublevels in this attribute. The first wants the the Holy One, blessed be He, to effuse His goodness to the whole world in general and to all of Israel. The second level is in a case where when his fellow also receives good; then the good he himself receives is limited; and still he looks on him with a good eye. The third level is when the effluence of the blessed God is only to his community, and he himself receives no portion in the good, and still he is happy that the blessed God effused goodness to others. This is the meaning of the verse (Mishlei, 22:9), &#x201C;he who sees with a good eye shall be blessed,&#x201D; for he is blessed with a good eye. Even though he has no portion in the effluence, still he is content that the blessed God effuses to his fellow, and his fellow receives good according to his desire.</p>

<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> M<small>ETSORA</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;This shall be the law of the leper [</italic>torat hametsora<italic>] &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 14:2)</p>
<p>It is written (Yirmiyah, 15:19), &#x201C;If you take forth the precious from the vile, then you shall be as my mouth &#x2026;&#x201D; The formulation &#x201C;you shall be as My mouth&#x201D; hints at the words of Torah, as it is written (Divrei haYamim 1, 16:12), &#x201C;the judgments of His mouth&#x201D; or (Mishlei 2:6) &#x201C;out of His mouth comes knowledge and understanding.&#x201D; This is &#x201C;if you bring forth the precious from the vile,&#x201D; for if one clarifies the deficiency within him, to bring out of it something precious, then &#x201C;you will be as My mouth,&#x201D; for that which comes forth from his mouth will be filled with the words of Torah.</p>
<p>This is hinted at in the verse &#x201C;this shall be the law of the leper [<italic>torat hametsora</italic>].&#x201D; &#x201C;This&#x201D; hints at as one would say &#x201C;this&#x201D; itself (singling out the deficiency), which at first seemed as if it has no connection to words of Torah; &#x201C;this&#x201D; itself will afterward be clarified that it came from words of Torah. This is because the source of leprosy is from the sin of <italic>lashon hara</italic> (not guarding one&#x2019;s speaking evil of another), on account of the inability of a man to stop his breath, and consequently he says too much.<sup><xref rid="fn175">17</xref></sup> The rectification of this on the day of his purification does not come about in a natural way, for according to nature it would have been necessary to stop his breath and limit his speech. On this it says, &#x201C;this shall be,&#x201D; meaning in this specific way and not according to nature. Rather, he should take care that the very power of speech that was previously used to say things that were not connected to Torah will now be used to its full power to speak words of Torah and the goodness of discourse in the Divine Law.</p>
<p>This is, &#x201C;and he shall be brought unto the <italic>Cohen</italic>,&#x201D; that by means of Divine service the power of his speech will be transformed to speak words of Torah. This is understood in light of the Midrash (<italic>Vayikra</italic> Rabba, 16:2), &#x201C;the tale of a certain merchant [<italic>rochel</italic>] who would go from town to town and say, &#x2018;who wants the drug of life? Who wants the drug of life?&#x2019; When Rabbi Yannai heard him he answered, &#x2018;I want the drug of life&#x0021;&#x2019; whereupon he [apparently the merchant] took out a book of Tehillim and showed him the verse, &#x2018;who is the man who desires life &#x2026; guard your tongue from evil &#x2026;&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>
<p>The question is, what new insight into Torah did this merchant have that merited Rabbi Yannai&#x2019;s praising him, and why did the Midrash specifically call the merchant by the term <italic>rochel</italic> (meaning also <italic>rechilut</italic>, tale bearing, or gossip)?</p>
<p>It seems that this man has the particular deficiency in his power of speech and in anger. Then after, when he saw that he could not mix in with society because of his deficiency, he then managed to come upon his lack, complete it, and then transformed this particular power into the words of Torah. Then he would pass from town to town with a greatly benevolent eye in order to enter into all he would meet and thus clarify this verse for them. For indeed the power of speech that had initially caused him harm, stemmed from the root of anger within him, as it is written (Mishlei, 21:23), &#x201C;guard your mouth and tongue, guard your soul from strife.&#x201D; So afterward he would run with a good eye and proclaim this verse, &#x201C;Guard your tongue from evil&#x0021;&#x201D; Therefore he is called a <italic>rochel</italic>, for this particular verse was revealed to him the lack that prevented him from mixing in with society.<sup><xref rid="fn176">18</xref></sup> Thus he saw that there is no room for this attribute even in our everyday dealings in the ways of the world, so therefore he is called a <italic>rochel</italic>, merchant, related to <italic>rechilut</italic>, gossip.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Speak unto the children of Israel and say to them, each man who has a running issue [gonorrhea] out of his flesh, this issue renders him impure.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 15:2)</p>
<p>Why, regarding this skin affliction, does the Torah preface it by saying, &#x201C;speak unto the children of Israel,&#x201D; where it does not say this before any of the other bodily impurities of which the Torah commands? It is written in the Midrash (Tanchuma, <italic>Ta&#x2019;azria</italic>, 9), &#x201C;evil shall not dwell [<italic>yagorcha</italic>] with you, means that evil shall not draw you along [<italic>goreret</italic>].&#x201D; The afflictions discussed teach of a deficiency in the very essence of Jewish existence, God forbid. This began in the previous <italic>Parsha, Ta&#x2019;azria</italic>, where it says, &#x201C;a man who has in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or a bright spot.&#x201D; Our sages said (<italic>Shevuot</italic>, 6b), &#x201C;a scab is a derivative of both a rising and a bright spot.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn177">19</xref></sup> This is a sign to include a rising with its derivatives, and a bright spot with its derivatives. After the leper has undergone two weeks of confinement, it is written, &#x201C;the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is a scab,&#x201D; because the rising and the bright spot are the primary transmitters of the impurity, and as such are completely separated from the very essence of Jewish existence.</p>
<p>This is &#x201C;evil shall not draw you along,&#x201D; for the very name &#x201C;Israel&#x201D; teaches of cleaving to the blessed God, as Yisrael can be divided into <italic>yashar El</italic>, or &#x201C;straight ahead to God.&#x201D; On the other hand, these primary transmitters of the impurity have no connection whatsoever to the name Israel or to intense cleaving to the blessed God. The scab, as it is secondary in connection to the primary transmitters of impurity, and it is judged according to its spreading, and it does not spread, then of it is said, &#x201C;it is a scab, it is pure.&#x201D; In other words, one understands from this that it is not connected to impurity at its root, only temporarily secondary to it. &#x201C;And he shall wash his clothes, and be clean&#x201D; (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 13:6). This is as it is written in the Gemara (<italic>Yevamot</italic>, 47b), &#x201C;Converts are as difficult to Israel as a scab.&#x201D; Even though the convert has come to cover himself in the wings of the <italic>Shechina</italic>, nonetheless he needs to undergo great clarifications regarding derivation from connections to impurity.</p>
<p>This whole matter is connected to the matter of afflictions, for the very affliction serves to clarify from which root sprouts the deficiency in man, if the leprosy is in his head, or in the walls of his house, and the whole matter is exceedingly deep. For the affliction of the house teaches of how in the future the blessed God will cause the evil inclination to pass from the hearts of Israel. (See the verse in Yirmiya, 4:19 where the same word for wall, <italic>kir</italic>, is used for the chambers of the heart, <italic>kirot libi.</italic>)</p>
<p>The next section (in <italic>Parshat Metsora</italic>) discusses the impurity of one who has a running issue, and it is prefaced by saying, &#x201C;speak unto the children of Israel.&#x201D; (Which is, as was said at the outside, unique in all of the discussions of bodily impurity.) This is because this kind of impurity teaches of the upright of heart, whose actions are greatly precious, yet within them there is a minute mistake.<sup><xref rid="fn178">20</xref></sup> In truth, the kingship is proper only for the seed of the house of David, yet Rechavoam to seize it with strength before his time. At that time, it was the will of the blessed God temporarily to give the kingdom to Yeravoam, and because Rechavoam exerted himself in this (to seize the kingdom) he was punished with an issue. An issue is in itself something good, but it must be at its proper time, meaning to fulfill the commandent of &#x201C;be fruitful and multiply.&#x201D; His sin was only in forcing the hour prior to its time. This matter is hinted at in the forty-nine words from &#x201C;and when he shall be pure&#x201D; (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 15:13), until &#x201C;[he shall make an atonement before God] for his discharge&#x201D; (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 15:13). For there are forty-nine gates of <italic>Kedusha</italic> in the forty-nine days of the counting of the Omer between Pesach and Shevuot.<sup><xref rid="fn179">21</xref></sup> Each of the days of the Omer corresponds to one of the forty-nine words in these three verses.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;[This shall be the law of the leper on the day that he is purified] and brought to the</italic> Cohen.&#x201D; (Vayikra, 14:2)</p>
<p>It is written in the holy Zohar (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 49b), &#x201C;this is as it is said (<italic>Shemot</italic>, 27:7), &#x2018;And the poles shall be put into the rings.&#x2019; &#x201D; (The same word above means &#x201C;brought&#x201D; and here means &#x201C;put.&#x201D;) The <italic>Cohen</italic> represents the fear of God, and the service of God. This is as it is written (Malachi, 2:5), &#x201C;and I shall place dread upon him and he shall fear Me.&#x201D; What this really means is that the <italic>Cohen</italic> has a confident mind in knowing that everything he does, small or great, is the will of the blessed God. This is a point that exists in each and every one in Israel, yet it is not always apparent, only at times when one is engaged in the service of God or His commandments at which time he is called a <italic>Cohen</italic> (priest).</p>
<p>This is the meaning of Rashi&#x2019;s explanation on the verse (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 49:28), &#x201C;these are the twelve tribes of Israel.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn180">22</xref></sup> This means that each of the tribes included all of the others. This is why the holy Zohar explains, &#x201C;this is as it is said [<italic>Shemot</italic>, 27:7], &#x2018;And the poles shall be put into the rings.&#x2019;&#x201D; That at the moment he is coming to the <italic>Cohen</italic>, then he himself shall bring out the quality of the <italic>Cohen</italic> inside himself, meaning the service and the fear.<sup><xref rid="fn181">23</xref></sup> Then he should limit himself as much as is necessary when he begins to heal. This is because there is a deficiency at the root of his life, and the main point is to heal the source.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;[And he shall take to purify the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop. And he shall slaughter one of the birds in an earthen utensil over living water. And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slaughtered bird, and in the living water, and sprinkle the house seven times. And he shall purify the house with the blood of the bird, and with the living water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet.] But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, and make an atonement for the house; and it shall be purified.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 14:53)</p>
<p>It is written in the Mishna (<italic>Negai&#x2019;im</italic>, Ch. 14, Mishna 2), &#x201C;He does not turn to the sea, nor to the desert, nor to the city, but to the field.&#x201D; The matter is thus. &#x201C;Sea&#x201D; and &#x201C;desert&#x201D; both teach of fear and love. &#x201C;City&#x201D; also teaches of fear, as it is written (Daniel, 4:20), &#x201C;and the king saw a watcher, a holy angel, descending from the heavens.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn182">24</xref></sup> After the leper has experienced God&#x2019;s salvation in being healed at the very root of his life, he then no longer has to restrict his actions so greatly, and he is permitted to experience expansion. &#x201C;Field&#x201D; represents expansion. This is as it is written in the holy Zohar (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 122a), &#x201C;for there is a field that is on the level of [<italic>Devarim</italic>, 20:19], &#x2018;a man is a tree of the field,&#x2019; and there is is a field which is on the level of [<italic>Devarim</italic>, 27:27], &#x2018;as the scent of a field which God has blessed.&#x2019;&#x201D; Understand this.</p>

<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And it was, after the death of the two sons of Aharon &#x2026; Speak to Aharon, do not come at all times into the Holy Place &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 16:1&#x2013;2)</p>
<p>The explanation of &#x201C;at all times,&#x201D; &#x201C;<italic>b&#x2019;col eit</italic>,&#x201D; is like &#x201C;with all the desires of your soul,&#x201D; &#x201C;<italic>b&#x2019;col avat nafsheicha</italic>.&#x201D; (Be careful how you proceed) now that you have seen how all the <italic>Kedusha</italic> (holiness) of Nadav and Avihu did not save them from something that had the outward appearance of a sin in their coming close before God, for in their hearts there was an overpowering of love more than fear. Concerning this, He warned Aharon not to imagine in his soul that he had the power to save himself from their fate. Rather, he needed to guard himself more than them, to be extremely vigilant of this, and know that he must always look toward divine assistance. &#x201C;Yet thus shall Aharon go&#x201D; (next verse) teaches that Aharon should go before God in the same way that Nadav and Avihu did, with <italic>Kedusha</italic>, purity, and great trepidation.<sup><xref rid="fn183">25</xref></sup> However, in addition to how they went, God advised him to go with, &#x201C;a bull for atonement.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Thus shall Aharon go &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 16:3)</p>
<p>It is written in the Midrash (<italic>Bamidbar</italic> Rabba, <italic>Acharei Mot</italic>, 21), &#x201C;If you have made bundles of sins, make bundles of <italic>mitzvot</italic> corresponding to them. If you have been jealous [&#x201C;high eyes,&#x201D; meaning looking at what someone else has with jealousy], than place <italic>totafot</italic> [<italic>tefillin</italic>] between your eyes&#x2026;&#x201D; It would seem that the mitzvah corresponding to jealousy (&#x201C;high eyes&#x201D;) would be <italic>tsitsit</italic>, of which it is written, &#x201C;and you shall see them.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn184">26</xref></sup> However, we have the following saying from our sages. &#x201C;At the time of the <italic>yetser hara</italic> [the inclination to evil], no one remembers the <italic>yetser tov</italic> [the inclination to good].&#x201D; Even though <italic>tsitsit</italic> teach of the great fear of God and a constriction of one&#x2019;s behavior, still, this reminder will be of no use at a time when the <italic>yetser hara</italic> is in control, for it will be impossible to keep your attention on them. <italic>Tefillin</italic>, on the other hand, teach of the final good that the blessed God will eventually effuse to each and every one of us. So when one puts his full attention on the great good, which is also hidden for him and his portion, then he will not be jealous when he looks on the portion of his neighbor. Then he will certainly refrain from jealousy, for he will be happy with his own portion.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And there shall be no man in the tent of appointed meeting when he goes in to make atonement &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 16:17)</p>
<p>It is said in the Midrash (<italic>Vayikra</italic> Rabba, 21:11), &#x201C;for the high priest is not a man &#x2026;&#x201D; The term &#x201C;man,&#x201D; <italic>adam</italic>, teaches of the intensely deep preciousness of man in his understanding and intellect. On the Day of Atonement he enters beyond and within (<italic>lifnai</italic> and <italic>lifnim</italic>, to the innermost holy of Holies), which is a completely unique place. This is as it is written in the holy Zohar (<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 130b), &#x201C;for there are two nostrils, one draws in life, and the other draws in the life of all life.&#x201D; With all of one&#x2019;s actions it is said (Mishlei, 16:1), &#x201C;the preparations of the heart are made by man, and the answer of the tongue is from God.&#x201D; Yet here it is different, as it is said, &#x201C;and there shall be no man.&#x201D; Thus when it comes to the service on the day of atonement and the effluence of Divine energy that flows at this time from the blessed God, there is absolutely no relevance to the borders of the comprehension of man, in his thought or understanding.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and he shall send [the goat] out by the hand of a man appointed for the occasion &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 16:21)</p>
<p>It is said in the holy Zohar (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 63b), &#x201C;this man would only live after this a short while,&#x201D; and the proof of this is in the term &#x201C;appointed for the occasion&#x201D; (<italic>eeti</italic>, coming from the word <italic>eyt</italic>, a time). With his action on the Day of Atonement he reaches a final state (time) of completion, having nothing more left to complete in this world.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Do not defile yourselves in any of these things &#x2026; and the land itself vomits out her inhabitants &#x2026; That the land should not vomit you out also, when you defile it, as it vomited out the nations that were before you.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 18:24&#x2013;28)</p>
<p>Even though the language is doubled, the meaning is &#x201C;it shall not vomit you,&#x201D; and this is because it says above this, &#x201C;and the land itself vomits out her inhabitants.&#x201D; You may think that this will be your only punishment for performing abominations, namely the land vomiting you out as it vomited out the other nations. Therefore it says afterward, &#x201C;but the land shall not vomit you out.&#x201D; Your judgment shall not be the land vomiting you out as was their judgment, but rather (verse 29), &#x201C;For whoever shall commit any of these abominations, the souls who commit them shall undergo spiritual excision among their people.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;It shall be a Sabbath of rest for you, and you shall afflict your souls, an eternal statute.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 16:31)</p>
<p>It is because this day is special among all the days of the year, as it is especially prepared for the effusion of goodness from the blessed God in the illumination of His countenance. Therefore the advice given is to afflict your souls (a kind of spiritual preparation) in order that you will have a greatly settled consciousness. This is all so the effusion does not descend only according to your requests, for then it would just descend within the bounds of your comprehension. In this way it will come as an effluence from the side of the blessed God, and it will be the full amount of the Holy One, blessed be He, without any measure or limit.</p>

<chapter>
<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> K<small>EDOSHIM</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And God spoke to Moshe saying: Speak to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, and say to them, be holy, for I am holy, Hashem, your God.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 19:1&#x2013;2)</p>
<p>&#x201C;The congregation of the children of Israel&#x201D; means any place where Israel gathers together for the sake of Heaven, as it is written in the Gemara (<italic>Sanhedrin</italic>, 38b), &#x201C;whenever ten Jews gather together, the <italic>Shechina</italic> [Divine Presence] rests on them.&#x201D; Every place where Israel gathers together for the sake of Heaven, there the <italic>Shechina</italic> dwells with them necessarily. This is as it is written (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 23:15), &#x201C;For Hashem your God walks in the midst of your camp.&#x201D; The term used for walk (<italic>mithalech</italic>, in the intensive form) denotes certainty, saying that it is certainly so. For this reason we are commanded to be refined and sanctified, as a king who says to one who loves him, &#x201C;since you are obliging me to go with you, see to it that you do not lead me into any place of foulness.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; you shall be holy, for I am holy &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 19:2)</p>
<p>The word for holiness, <italic>Kedusha</italic>, is a term denoting preparedness, meaning that the blessed God warns Israel to always be in a state of <italic>Kedusha</italic>, and thus always ready, expecting at all times the salvation of the blessed God where He will illuminate their eyes to the words of Torah, &#x201C;For I am holy.&#x201D; In other words, the blessed God is saying that He, may He be blessed, is always ready to bring salvation to Israel, and because of this Israel must be always prepared and always expecting the arrival of Hashem. Thus they should not disturb themselves with the affairs of this world. This is as it is written (Mishlei, 3:3), &#x201C;let not loving-kindness and truth forsake you,&#x201D; but it is not written, &#x201C;do not forsake loving-kindness and truth.&#x201D; In this he wants to say that a man must always stand before the blessed God, and expect him to illuminate his eyes. Then, at the time when the Holy One, blessed be He, effuses the loving-kindness of truth, which is loving-kindness that endures forever, then the loving-kindness (itself) will apprehend the man who waits expectantly for it. It will not forsake every one who waits for the words of Torah to enter his heart. Man must be careful not to turn his back, but rather should stand before God face to face.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; you shall be holy, for I am holy &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 19:2)</p>
<p>The blessed God commands Israel to sanctify themselves even concerning that which is permitted to them. He has already explained all forbidden actions, like certain foods and certain sexual relations, yet here the Holy One, blessed be He, adds that even that which is permitted to them they shall take care not to be steeped in lust. They will take care that where there is benefit derived in this world it should be done with a settled mind, and not in a state of panic. This is seen in the signs of pure birds as explained in the Gemara (<italic>Chullin</italic>, 65a), &#x201C;a bird which seizes its prey is impure,&#x201D; meaning that it does not have trust in the blessed God, so therefore all that it eats it clutches in its claws (for fear that it would lose it). Also from the second interpretation of &#x201C;seizing its prey,&#x201D; where it does not wait until its prey dies, but eats it immediately upon capture, we also see a lack of trust in the blessed God, for it fears that another would take from it that which it was given.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;A man shall fear his mother and father, and you shall keep my Sabbaths &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 19:3)</p>
<p>Here in this verse as it appears in our <italic>Parsha</italic> the honor of the mother comes first, followed by honoring the father, and afterward the guarding of Shabbat. In the Ten Commandments, guarding the Sabbath comes first, followed by honoring the father, and afterward honoring the mother. The holy Zohar explains (<italic>Shemot</italic>, 200a), &#x201C;there are three points to the Torah.&#x201D; This is, that in all the things that a man does and from which he receives benefit, he must consider his way, and make three clarifications. First, that the action should not involve any deviation from the will of the blessed God, even to a boundary from later sages. This is called &#x201C;guarding the Shabbat,&#x201D; for Shabbat is itself a name of God as explained in the holy Zohar (<italic>Shemot</italic>, 88b), &#x201C;What is Shabbat? It is a name of the Holy One, blessed be He.&#x201D; Furthermore, on Shabbat it becomes clear that nothing is really done from the actions of man.</p>
<p>It is also necessary to clarify concerning the entire community of Israel, that it should not receive any harm from this action. This is called honoring the father. The father teaches knowledge to the son. He does not concern himself with the understanding of the son, to whom it seems that his father is doing evil to him in obliging him to go in the way of good, since the father knows that in the end it will be good for him. He does not worry about his son&#x2019;s temporary distress, for the father is only looking at the depths.</p>
<p>For the third clarification, the one doing the action must clarify concerning himself that he will not cause himself any harm from this action. This is called honoring the mother, for the mother&#x2019;s desire while she is teaching the son to go in the path of good, is that even if it is goes against the wishes of the son, he will not see it as if she is causing him to suffer.</p>
<p>Thus are we commanded concerning these three warnings, which are guarding Shabbat, and honoring the father and the mother, which means to make these three clarifications for all matters. These clarifications are in the mind of everyone for every matter, as we see that a man&#x2019;s conscience will not let him satisfy his palate for temporary benefit. On this it is said (Mishlei, 25:27), &#x201C;it is not good to eat too much honey.&#x201D; Even though at the time when one is eating it it is pleasing to the taste, he needs to make sure that actions will not harm the rest of the organs and limbs of his body, for if damage is done to the rest of his body, then eventually the damage will reach his palate. So it is that the man who thinks only of the moment is inferior in the eyes of the world. We find that the man who has a greater intellect will not only look at what is pleasing to his tongue, but will look after the good of his entire body all the days of his life. Even though this level is more honorable than the first, he still has not reached the final form of completion, for one must look toward the blessed God. With Him, may He be blessed, there is a depth far deeper than all the life of this world, for the blessed God endures from eternity until eternity. Therefore the most complete mind will take all matters and consider whether they will benefit him for all eternity.</p>
<p>Thus it is also with the entire community of Israel, for they are, as it were, the limbs and organs of the Holy One, blessed be He. Therefore, if one member of Israel wants to do an action from which he will receive benefit, he must make all of these clarifications, for if he looks only after his own benefit and not for the benefit of the community of Israel, then he himself will be, God forbid, harmed by that action. This is like praying for a cessation of rain for the convenience of travelers when rain is needed. Then he too will be harmed by this among the whole community of Israel, like one who eats much honey&#x2014;the damage that is done to the rest of his body will eventually reach his tongue. If he considers his way enough so that his action will not affect all of Israel adversely, but still it is against the will of God, even down to a boundary instituted by a latter codifier of the law, then he also will not derive any benefit from this. But if it is the will of the blessed God, then he may do what his heart desires.</p>
<p>Therefore one must clarify himself with these three clarifications, regarding the blessed God, regarding all of Israel, and regarding himself. Only with the Ten Commandments, meaning at the beginning of one&#x2019;s acceptance of the yoke of the Torah, when he wants to do something from which he will benefit, then the first clarification must be regarding the blessed God, then regarding all of Israel, and finally regarding himself. That is why there the mitzvah of keeping Shabbat comes first, then honoring the father, and then honoring the mother.</p>
<p>Yet here, the <italic>Parsha</italic> speaks of a one who is holy in his heart, refined, and drawn after the will of the blessed God. Here we are discussing one who does not want anything that is against the will of the blessed God, and all that comes to his mind is only that which the will of the blessed God had influenced upon him. For a man who is this, <italic>kadosh</italic>, when it comes to his mind to do something, even though it may seem as if it is against the community as a whole, he need not look on this, for he is the main principle and foundation of all Israel. All the community as a whole are before him as if each one individually were in his mind. This is as it says in the Gemara (<italic>Berachot</italic>, 6b on the final verse in Kohellet, &#x201C;the conclusion of the matter in which everything is included, fear God and keep his <italic>mitzvot</italic>, for that is the whole man&#x201D;), &#x201C;[&#x2019;For this is the whole man&#x2019; means] all the world was only created to command him to do it,&#x201D; since he is its main point. All the world is before him like one&#x2019;s garments, and what is good for him is good for all Israel at the depths, even though to the mortal eye it seems like the opposite, and this is also the will of the blessed God. So therefore the order here is first the mother, then the father, last the Shabbat. This is because when he has the will to do something it is surely for the good of the whole of Israel and the will of the blessed God. This is like the prayer of King David (Tehillim, 90:17), &#x201C;May the pleasantness of Hashem be upon us, and the world of our hands be established for us, and the work of our hands be established.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn185">27</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Do not turn to the idols and do not make molten gods for yourselves, I am Hashem your God.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 19:4)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Idol&#x201D; means fear that is founded on nonsense. This is because the word for idol comes from the word for tail, <italic>aliah</italic>, which is the limb of the body that is furthest away from the head, and thus it contains greatly constricted consciousness. Thus it is said, that only for the perfect <italic>Tsaddikim</italic> is their heart drawn after the will of the blessed God. When any kind of desire comes to their heart, they constrict themselves through much careful consideration of the fear of God, and only act while trusting in God that He will not let anything evil befall them, God forbid. This is as it is written (<italic>Kohollet</italic>, 7:16), &#x201C;Do not be overly righteous; nor make yourself too wise; why should you destroy yourself?&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; do not make molten gods for yourselves &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 19:4)</p>
<p>A &#x201C;molten god&#x201D; is a composite of melted metals that cannot move. So too do we find in man that he becomes used to receiving benefit from this world, until he cannot even do without a small enjoyment. This is called a &#x201C;molten god.&#x201D; Therefore the blessed God commanded us not to say that we are so used to something that we cannot be separated from it. Rather, with all the enjoyable things in life that man receives, he must remove himself from any affliction.<sup><xref rid="fn186">28</xref></sup> Then, after the affliction is removed, if the desire still remains, then he knows clearly that it is from God. This is as we find with the prophet Yirmiya (see Yirmiya, Ch. 42), when they asked him if they could return to Egypt, and he warned them to heed his voice and trust him, not to turn from his counsel in any way. Then when he said to them not to return to Egypt they said, &#x201C;Baruch ben Neriya incites you against us&#x201D; (Yirmiya, 43:3).</p>
<p>This was because they suspected that it was not the blessed God&#x2019;s command to tell them this, but rather from his own mind, for they esteemed him as a prophet of God, and this matter was not written in the words of Torah. Thus they suspected that he wanted them to remain in Israel out of his love of Baruch ben Neriya. This was because he wanted Baruch to attain the level of prophecy, and all levels of prophecy begin only in the land of Israel, as is known. So out of his love he leaned in this way, and it seemed also as if the will of God leaned in this direction. Prophecy must also undergo great clarifications, in order to verify that it is truly from the blessed God. We find this with Yirmiya himself at the time when he was in prison, and he received a prophetic message that he should buy a field from his uncle Chanamel ben Shalom. Then after, when his uncle came and offered to sell his field, Yirmiya said, &#x201C;And I know now that this is the word of God&#x201D; (Yirmiya, 32:8). The meaning is that until now he was uncertain whether the matter was really from God, or if he just wanted to buy the field.</p>
<p>Therefore (with the matter of the people wanting to go to Egypt), it seemed to him that this was also the will of the God. This is called &#x201C;a molten god,&#x201D; meaning stubbornness over a single desire. Therefore with all matters a man needs to undergo clarifications within himself, and to remove any personal afflictions that may impede the clarity of his vision. Yirmiya also went through this process of self-clarification, and afterward it is said, &#x201C;and it was, at the end of ten days,&#x201D; he answered them not to go back, saying (Yirmiya, 42:10), &#x201C;If you will still remain in this land, then I will build you, and not pull you down.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn187">29</xref></sup> He then received a prophecy that Baruch would not attain the level of prophecy, as it is written (Yirmiya, 45:4&#x2013;5), &#x201C;Thus shall you say to him &#x2026; And do you seek great things for yourself? Do not seek them,&#x201D; etc.</p>
<p>In this, he clarified and proved his righteousness to them, for he was no longer swayed (in this case, his &#x201C;affliction&#x201D;) by his feelings for Baruch, for all he wanted was for Baruch to become a prophet, and now he knew that this would never happen. All the effluence of prophecy to the prophets was only for Israel, and while Israel is in exile the spirit of prophecy does not come to the prophets. Even though his warning not to go to Egypt (in Chapter 42) happens before this clarification took place (in Chapter 45), (this is of no consequence,) because &#x201C;there is no before or after in the Torah.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;You shall not defraud your neighbor &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 19:13)</p>
<p>Any time when one could provide something good for his fellow man. but does not, he is defrauding him. Even when he has the opportunity to pray for his fellow man, but does not, this too is called defrauding him. We find this regarding Shmuel, who said (Shmuel 1, 12:23), &#x201C;God forbid that I would sin against God by refraining from praying for you.&#x201D; The Gemara interprets this by saying (<italic>Berachot</italic>, 12b), &#x201C;anyone who has the opportunity to pray for another and does not is called a sinner.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;You shall guard my statutes. You shall not breed-together two different kinds of your cattle. You shall not sow together two different kinds of seeds in your field. You shall not wear a garment woven of both wool and linen.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 19:19)</p>
<p>&#x201C;In your field&#x201D; means the abundance that man sows and then uses to influence his surroundings. In this the blessed God is warning man to take care that there is no admixture of evil, God forbid, in all the influence that he puts forth. &#x201C;Your cattle&#x201D; means reception. Wherever man receives good, as in eating and the like, it shall not be mixed (with evil).</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;A man who has sexual relations with a woman, and she is a slave betrothed to a man, she has not been redeemed or given her freedom, the matter shall be investigated, and she shall not be put to death, for she was not free.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 19:20)</p>
<p>In this we see the depth of the sin of Zimri with Cosbi daughter of Tsur. This is (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 19:22) &#x201C;and the <italic>Cohen</italic> shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering &#x2026; and he shall be forgiven.&#x201D; This hints at Pinchas,<sup><xref rid="fn188">30</xref></sup> who killed Zimri, and then it is said, &#x201C;the plague was stopped.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Do not defile your daughter by making her into a whore, do not prostitute the land, and fill it with perversity.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 19:29)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Your daughter&#x201D; is like the expression &#x201C;the pupil [literally, &#x2018;daughter&#x2019;] of the eye.&#x201D; The Holy One, blessed be He, is warning us to guard the eye, lest, God forbid, it should bring perversity to the heart, for the land is hinted at in the heart, and &#x201C;the muscles of the eye are connected to the heart&#x201D; (<italic>Avodah Zara</italic>, 28b), and also &#x201C;the eye is the pimp of the heart,&#x201D; as it is said in the Gemara (Yerushalmi, <italic>Berachot</italic>, Ch. 1, <italic>Halacha</italic> 5).</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;You shall guard My Sabbaths and be in awe of My sanctuary, I am God.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 19:30)</p>
<p>&#x201C;My Sabbaths,&#x201D; because wherever the <italic>Shechina</italic> dwells (every place of Divine inspiration), at all times, even temporarily, is called &#x201C;Shabbat.&#x201D; The blessed God commanded us to respect all places of Divine inspiration, even if it is only temporary. &#x201C;And you shall be in awe of My sanctuary&#x201D; is rendered in the Aramaic translation &#x201C;and you shall have the fear [of God] in the Holy Temple,&#x201D; which means to expect the depth of good that exists in each commandment. At present, Shabbat is greatly constricted, but in the future, the blessed God will bestow upon us a day that is entirely Shabbat where there will be no need of work. We must greatly anticipate this. But for now, we must honor it also according to how the blessed God commanded us. This is likened to a king who is passing from place to place. Though his arrival home is anticipated, still, the place where he lodges on his way must be respected. There is satisfaction and desire in the words of Torah, as it is written (Tehillim, 145:16), &#x201C;and satisfies the desire of every living being.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This means temporary satisfaction, and desire for the good in the depth. This was the error of Chofni and Pinchas when they saw that the <italic>Shechina</italic> only rested temporarily on the Tabernacle in Shilo. Therefore it was less significant in their view, and of this it is said, &#x201C;you have shamed My sanctuary.&#x201D; Therefore the verse, <italic>et shabtotai tishmoru</italic>, contains thirty letters, and if the words <italic>shabtorai tishmoru</italic> are spelled out with two <italic>vavs</italic>, then the verse contains thirty-two letters; it is then the numerical equivalent of <italic>lev</italic>&#x2014;&#x201C;heart.&#x201D; (&#x201C;Desire for the good in the depth.&#x201D;) This is as it is written, (Yeshayahu, 63:4), &#x201C;for the day of vengeance is in my heart, and the year of my redeemed has come,&#x201D; and the Gemara explains (<italic>Sanhedrin</italic>, 99a), &#x201C;I have revealed it to my heart, but not to my other limbs.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn189">31</xref></sup> (And whoever has the two <italic>vavs</italic> in the words,</p>

<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;You shall sanctify yourselves and you shall be holy, for I am Hashem your God.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 20:7)</p>
<p>&#x201C;And you shall sanctify yourselves&#x201D; is the blessed God warning Israel to sanctify themselves and to place themselves in all the boundaries that are commanded to us, like forbidden foods or forbidden sexual relations, and the like. Then, after all the boundaries, if the heart of man is still not refined and drawn after the will of the blessed God, accordingly He assures us, &#x201C;and you shall be holy.&#x201D; In other words, the blessed God gives us a promise that we will be sanctified. For truly, the refinement of the heart to be drawn after the will of God is not in the ability of man, but comes only from God&#x2019;s assistance.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Do not walk in the ways of the nation that I have cast out before you, for these they have done and I have loathed them. And I say to you that you will inherit the land, and I am the one who is giving it to you to inherit it &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 20:23&#x2013;24)</p>
<p>If Israel guards themselves from the lusts of the nations and from their desires, then the blessed God will give them all the delights that he has given the nations. Only they shall recognize that the blessed God is the one who is giving, and all the delights shall be in a state of <italic>Kedusha.</italic> This is as the Holy One, blessed be He, promises them, &#x201C;I am the one who is giving it to you.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;You shall be holy for Me, for I am holy &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 19:2)</p>
<p>(Here the word for I, <italic>Ani</italic>, is voweled with a <italic>patach</italic>.) At the end of <italic>Parshat Shmini</italic>, while discussing forbidden foods (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 11:45), where it says, &#x201C;for I am holy,&#x201D; then the word for I is voweled with a <italic>kamats.</italic> With the <italic>Kedusha</italic> of foods that man receives, where it is written, &#x201C;for I am holy,&#x201D; I, <italic>Ani</italic>, voweled with a <italic>kamats</italic>, in order to show man to draw that which he receives from the attributes of the Holy One, blessed be He, for He, may He be blessed, is void of and greatly distant from any physical qualities. Therefore Israel is enjoined to sanctify and constrict themselves only in the <italic>Kedusha</italic> of the Holy One, blessed be He.<sup><xref rid="fn191">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>The word for I in the present <italic>Parsha</italic> is voweled with a <italic>patach</italic>, because we are discussing the <italic>Kedusha</italic> of Divine effluence (which reaches the physical world). All the influences that exist in the world are only from the blessed God, for it is His way to improve all of His creations and to effuse unto them from His great good. Therefore he warns Israel to only direct this effluence to a place where the blessed God desires. This is one of the meanings of the prohibition of certain sexual relations, meaning incest. That is to say, it is the nature of man to give foremost to his own family, and to restrict himself in giving to others. Therefore He forbade incest in order for man to bring his influence to a different family, in His will to improve His creation. The name of the vowel, <italic>patach</italic>, means to open, so &#x201C;for I am holy&#x201D; with a <italic>patach</italic> means that the blessed God opens his hands to bring His effluence of goodness to all of His creations.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;You shall be holy, for I am holy, Hashem, and I will separate you from the nations to be Mine.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 20:26)</p>
<p>This verse greatly reinforces Israel, bringing them holy brazenness (<italic>tekifut</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn192">34</xref></sup> This is needed; after all the fear of God warranted in the commandments throughout the <italic>Parsha</italic> to be sanctified with all kinds of <italic>Kedushot</italic>, boundaried within all kinds of borders, and refined from all dross and refuse. If this verse were formulated in the opposite way, &#x201C;and I will separate the other nations from you,&#x201D; it would mean, like one separating the refuse out of the food, and then all that would be left is to good and cleaned. And now, since it is said, &#x201C;and I will separate you from the nations,&#x201D; this is as if one is separating the food out of the refuse, and all that can be called &#x201C;food&#x201D; he leaves to eat. Thus it is that the blessed God promises us that He will separate us out from the nations, meaning that He will refine us in against the nations, so that even the smallest of Israel is good. Therefore the Haftorah, the reading of the Prophets, read with this <italic>Parsha</italic>, is (Amos, 9:7), &#x201C;are you not like the Cushites [Ethiopians], children of Israel, says Hashem. Did I not bring Israel out of the land of Egypt? And the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Aram from Kir?&#x201D; Then it says (Amos, 9:9), &#x201C;For, behold, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like grain is sifted in a sieve, and not even the smallest grain fall upon the earth.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In this <italic>Sedra</italic> we find mentioned twenty times &#x201C;I am Hashem,&#x201D; in a passage or series of verses that will also say &#x201C;I am Hashem your God.&#x201D; With each of these instances, in each sub-<italic>Parsha</italic>, there are differences in where this declaration occurs. Sometimes at the beginning of the section and at the end of the section we find &#x201C;I am Hashem,&#x201D; and in the middle of the section is mentioned &#x201C;I am Hashem your God.&#x201D; Sometimes we find the opposite. The declaration &#x201C;I am Hashem&#x201D; teaches of a place where it seems to the consciousness of man that he can perform a pure and refined action according to the will of God. Thus it will there say, &#x201C;I am Hashem,&#x201D; meaning that if I, God, join with you, and clarify you, then it will prove (the value of) your action, if it is correct before Me. This is as it is said, &#x201C;who can say, &#x2018;I have refined my heart?&#x2019; &#x201D; For &#x201C;I am Hashem&#x201D; is God saying I, between Me and Myself, and My will was not involved in this action, so how could the action be shown to be just? But if it says, I am Hashem <italic>your</italic> God,&#x201D; then it means that the blessed God promises man that He dwells in his heart. (Or that he dwells in His heart.) This brings great holy brazenness to man. Then in a place where man becomes dejected, and it looks as if he, God forbid, has withdrawn from the realm of God&#x2019;s will, then the Holy One, blessed be He, comes to him and assures him, &#x201C;I am Hashem <italic>your</italic> God.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This is expounded on in the Gemara (<italic>Bava Metsia</italic>, 61b), where it says, &#x201C;What is the need of the commandment, &#x2018;You shall not steal,&#x2019; which the Torah wrote?&#x2014;For that which was taught: &#x2018;You shall not steal,&#x2019; in order to distress someone; &#x2018;you shall not steal,&#x2019; even in order to repay double [and thus be giving him a gift].&#x201D; Even though the one who steals from his fellow man did it with the intention of bringing him benefit, and not as one who would steal in order that his fellow man would lack (and he would gain), nonetheless, since the blessed God enjoins us not to steal, it is forbidden to try to be overly clever with God&#x2019;s words and say that his intention was good. In every place where the blessed God forbade something, even if one does it with a good intention, it is called deviating from the blessed God&#x2019;s will. Sometimes we find the ramifications of the blessed God&#x2019;s law reaching a place that seems to man to be extraneous.</p>
<p>We find in the Gemara (<italic>Ketubot</italic>, 49a), &#x201C;you cunning man [related to the word for thief], why do you go round and round? If you assert that the law is according to Rabbi Meir, then say that the law is according to Rabbi Meir.&#x201D; Therefore it says, &#x201C;I am Hashem,&#x201D; meaning, know who decreed this over you, and thus you will not exaggerate the attributes of the Holy One, blessed be He, and you will not be overly clever with all that God has decreed forbidden. This is why this first order is used with the commandment (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 20:27), &#x201C;a man or woman who has a familiar or is a wizard.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Even though it has already been written (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 19:31), &#x201C;do not turn to the familiars,&#x201D; this additional verse comes so that one would not say, &#x201C;I know the meaning of the <italic>mitzvot</italic>, for a familiar, <italic>ov</italic>, comes from the word for father, <italic>av</italic>, as in, &#x2018;a father in wisdom,&#x2019; and a wizard, <italic>yedoni</italic>, comes from the word for knowing (<italic>yedia</italic>), meaning knowing how the blessed God conducts the forces of His world.&#x201D; In this way he could trick himself into devising ways around the warnings of the blessed God.</p>
<p>This is like the passage in the Gemara about Shlomo haMelech (<italic>Sanhedrin</italic>, 21b), where he said, &#x201C;I will increase my number of wives, and my heart will not be perverted.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn193">35</xref></sup> Therefore the blessed God warns, &#x201C;I am God,&#x201D; know who decreed this over you.&#x201D; This was written before the warnings about the familiar and the wizard. &#x201C;And you shall keep My statutes, for I am Hashem who sanctifies you&#x201D; (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 20:8), this means that all the words of the blessed God&#x2019;s are on the level of immutable, inscrutable statutes, which may not be disputed or questioned. If a man were to come and say, &#x201C;since the words of the blessed God are so detailed down to a hair&#x2019;s breadth, how can it be possible for a man to guard them?&#x201D; To this our <italic>Parsha</italic> says, &#x201C;I am Hashem your God,&#x201D; which is saying, &#x201C;I am with you. All that is in your power, go ahead and do.&#x201D; Then everyplace where our actions can reach, there the Holy One, blessed be He, promises us that we will not transgress His will.</p>
<p>Therefore the Haftorah, the reading Prophets for this <italic>Parsha</italic>, says (Amos, Ch. 9), &#x201C;are you not like the Cushites [Ethiopians], children of Israel, says Hashem. Did I not bring Israel out of the land of Egypt? And the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Aram from Kir? Except that I will not completely destroy the house of Yaakov, and not even the least grain shall fall upon the earth.&#x201D; This is to say, everywhere that the intention of man was for the sake of Heaven, even though the action itself seemed the opposite, like stealing in order to pay back double, there the blessed God promises that this intention will not fall down to the earth, as in &#x201C;and not even the least grain shall fall upon the earth.&#x201D; Corresponding to the twenty declarations of God&#x2019;s name in this <italic>Parsha</italic>, &#x201C;I am Hashem,&#x201D; Shlomo haMelech listed twenty things that he did not know (see Mishlei, 30:18&#x2013;33).</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Do not round off the corners of your head, or the corners of your beard.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 19:27)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Corners&#x201D; (referring to <italic>peyot</italic>, earlocks) teaches of the fear of God. At the very place where <italic>peyot</italic> extend out, there is the birth of thought, and then the thought descends down to the heart. Thus this verse teaches that whenever one experiences an evil thought, he is immediately to enter into a state of the fear of God, and not let the thought rest in his heart.<sup><xref rid="fn194">36</xref></sup> For &#x201C;heart&#x201D; refers to thought with greater strength. This is as David haMelech said (Tehillim, Ch. 5), &#x201C;a song of victory on the <italic>&#x2018;nechilot.&#x2019; &#x201D;</italic> The matter of <italic>nechilot</italic> refers to hearing one&#x2019;s cry.<sup><xref rid="fn195">37</xref></sup> &#x201C;Listen to my words, Hashem, understand my contemplation.&#x201D; &#x201C;My words&#x201D; relates to one&#x2019;s thoughts, that God listen to them so they will be pure. &#x201C;Understand my contemplation&#x201D; means to ask the blessed God to bring an effluence of understanding to all my thoughts, and that I may purify them all so they will not turn from God&#x2019;s will. &#x201C;Listen to the voice of my cry, my King, my God.&#x201D; &#x201C;My King&#x201D; means that the blessed God is king over all men, and can cause an effluence of thought to man according to His holy will. <italic>E-lohi</italic>&#x2014;&#x201C;My God&#x201D; is that the blessed God causes an effluence of wisdom, because God&#x2019;s name, <italic>E-lohim</italic>, teaches of wisdom.</p>

<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> E<small>MOR</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; say (Emor) to the</italic> Cohanim, <italic>the sons of Aharon, and you shall say to them, do not make yourselves impure from the dead of your people.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 21:1)</p>
<p><italic>Cohen</italic> signifies one who serves God, and sees that all the actions in the world are done as a result of the direct involvement (<italic>hashgacha</italic>) of the blessed God. He also sees that God&#x2019;s desire is only to improve the creation. One who sees the world this way can easily experience angry complaints when he sees actions that are an expression of the attribute of stern judgment of the Holy One, blessed be He. With one who has decided that the world runs by chance it is not as easy to have such complaints, for when he sees an event in the world that is against his desire, he will say that it came about by chance. Yet the man who knows that all that happens in the world is from Heaven can experience angry complaints.</p>
<p>For this reason the Holy One, blessed be He, commands the <italic>Cohanim</italic>, meaning those who serve God, &#x201C;do not make yourselves impure from the dead of your people.&#x201D; In other words, not to have angry complaints against the attribute of stern judgment of the Holy One, blessed be He, for &#x201C;impure from the dead&#x201D; means angry complaints against the Holy One, blessed be He. The main reason for angry complaints in the world are as a response to the attribute of stern judgment, which creates experiences of loss and absence in the world, as explained in the holy Zohar. Therefore the blessed God commanded, &#x201C;say to the <italic>Cohanim</italic>,&#x201D; for (the particular wording of) &#x201C;say to them&#x201D; means in a whisper (Zohar, <italic>Vayikra</italic>, 88b). This means to whisper into the ears of the servants of God that they should not have angry complaints against the attribute of stern judgment, for the intentions of the blessed God are always in order to improve. Even when He conducts the world with the attribute of stern judgment, then too, His intention at the depths is only to improve.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; say to the</italic> Cohanim &#x2026;.&#x201D; (Vayikra, 21:1)</p>
<p>It is written in the Midrash (Tanchuma, <italic>Emor</italic>, 1), &#x201C;a parable about a king who said to his cook, &#x2018;I request of you, not to so much as look at the dead all the days of your life, so you will not defile my palace.&#x2019;&#x201D; For the cook is, so to speak, responsible for the pleasure of the king, so therefore the king warned him, &#x201C;since your service to me is to see to my pleasure, be careful not to cause me sadness.&#x201D; Seeing death is the opposite of <italic>simcha</italic> (joy). This is &#x201C;say to the <italic>Cohanim&#x201D;</italic> to be careful not to cause the opposite of their task, since they were chosen to bring down an effluence of <italic>simcha</italic> into the world, and to create a pleasing spirit before the Holy One, blessed be He, with their service.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; say to the</italic> Cohanim &#x2026; <italic>do not make yourselves impure from the dead of your people.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 21:1)</p>
<p>The <italic>Cohen</italic> is chosen as the vehicle through which all the actions of Israel will be rectified and acceptable before the Holy One, blessed be He. Therefore He warned concerning impurity received from the dead, for death teaches of the opposite of this. There are three levels of soul found in man: (in ascending order) <italic>nefesh</italic> (what animates the body), <italic>ruach</italic>, and <italic>neshama</italic>, and the completeness of the vitality of the <italic>nefesh</italic> is only when it is connected to the higher levels of <italic>ruach</italic> and <italic>neshama.</italic> Therefore at night when the <italic>ruach</italic> and the <italic>neshama</italic> separate from the body, then the <italic>nefesh</italic> remains in the body only with no ability to effect physical action. This is why we say the blessing each morning, &#x201C;Blessed are You, who straightens the bent,&#x201D; for when the <italic>ruach</italic> and the <italic>neshama</italic> are reconnected to the <italic>nefesh</italic> and the body, then the <italic>nefesh</italic> and the body, which were previously &#x201C;bent over&#x201D; and unable to act, are straightened upright.</p>
<p>Just as we find in man, so too do we find in the whole community of Israel. The <italic>Cohen</italic> is like the head of the body of the whole of Israel. Just as there is the aspect of thought in the soul of man, so too in general, following the level of thought, all the rest of Israel are on different levels one higher than the other, like the organs and limbs of man, starting with the head, and evolving out to the organs of action (fingers, feet, mouth). At a time when the man is awake, then the head is in control of all the limbs, as in the saying of the Baal Shem <italic>Tov</italic>, where a man&#x2019;s mind is, there the man is in his entirety. At a time when the man is asleep, then there is no difference between the head and the rest of the limbs. Therefore He warned not to become impure from the dead, since the <italic>Cohen</italic> is in charge of the body of Israel, and has the power to rectify all the actions done by Israel. Death teaches of the opposite of this, for in this state he will not find any power of action to fix what he has perverted in his life, and the Cohen&#x2019;s special function is to rectify the actions of Israel, so nothing would become irrecoverably lost in exile.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;That which is bruised or crushed, broken or cut [referring to castration of an animal], you shall not offer to God, you shall not do this in your land.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 22:24)</p>
<p>This means not to deride any aspect of the creation of the Holy One, blessed be He. Thus it is taught in the Gemara (<italic>Chagiga</italic>, 14b), &#x201C;from this that it is forbidden to castrate,&#x201D; for it is forbidden to mock (the creation). As it is said in the tractate <italic>Chagiga</italic> (ibid.), &#x201C;they asked Ben Zoma, may one castrate a dog?<sup><xref rid="fn196">38</xref></sup> Ben Zoma answered, &#x2018;you shall not do this in your land,&#x2019; includes everything in your land. Then they asked him, &#x2018;a woman who is pregnant and still shows signs of being a virgin, is she fit for the <italic>Cohen Gadol</italic> [high priest, who may only marry a virgin]? Ben Zoma answered them, &#x2018;what about Shmuel [who claimed to have been able to impregnate a woman without removing any sign of her virginity], but there is no one who can do this today as Shmuel did.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>
<p>They asked Ben Zoma these questions after they saw that he did not &#x201C;return in peace&#x201D; (after entering the &#x201C;garden&#x201D; of the secrets of the Torah with Rebi Akiva) as it said, &#x201C;he gazed [on the mysteries] and was stricken [with madness].&#x201D; From this they understood that his comprehension had been altered,<sup><xref rid="fn197">39</xref></sup> and he would make mistakes in various matters. Thus they were testing him to see if it would be easy for him to deride any aspect of the creation of the Holy One, blessed be He. This is why they asked him if it was permitted to castrate a dog, for a dog represents the lowest level of the creation. They asked him if castration was permitted in order to see if it would be easy for him to nullify its existence, and he answered them that it was forbidden, because &#x201C;you shall not do&#x201D; includes everything in your land. This means that it is forbidden to deride even the lowest of all creatures, since it is a part of the blessed God&#x2019;s creation.</p>
<p>After this they wanted to test him in the opposite direction, to see whether he made the mistake in believing that elements of the creation had more power than they really had. This is why they asked him if a virgin who was pregnant was permitted to the <italic>Cohen Gadol</italic>, for the <italic>Cohen Gadol</italic> is the greatest of all created beings, and perhaps he understood this element to have more power than it really had. He answered them that there is no one who can do this today as Shmuel did, meaning that he did not understand that the <italic>Cohen Gadol</italic> possessed any greater power than that which existed within him. Neither would he be overly stringent against him than necessary, &#x201C;for there is no one like Shmuel,&#x201D; who could have impregnated her, so therefore she is permitted.<sup><xref rid="fn198">40</xref></sup> The real mistake that Ben Zoma made was in his understanding of the great difference between the waters of the lower firmament and the waters of the upper firmament.<sup><xref rid="fn199">41</xref></sup> This is as Ben Zoma said in the Gemara (<italic>Chagiga</italic>, 15a), &#x201C;between the upper and lower waters there is the distance of three finger widths, and they said, &#x2018;Ben Zoma is still on the outside.&#x2019;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn200">42</xref></sup> Ben Zoma had understood that there was a great difference between good desire and evil desire.<sup><xref rid="fn201">43</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;An ox, or lamb, or goat which is born, shall remain seven days under its mother, and from the eighth day on it will be acceptable as an offering of fire to Hashem.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 22:27)</p>
<p>The holy Zohar (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 91a) explains that this is in order for the animal to pass one Shabbat. If so, then it should be acceptable as an offering immediately after Shabbat, even if it was born just prior to Shabbat. Why then does the Torah stipulate that it should pass seven complete days? We find that the blessed God created seven forces of goodness in the world, &#x201C;Yours, Hashem is the greatness, and the strength, and the splendor&#x2026;&#x201D; (Divrei haYamim 1, 29:11), and each of the seven days of creation contains one of these forces of goodness, as is known. Shabbat is the foundation and principle of all of the forces of goodness, for Shabbat teaches of the glory of Heaven, and <italic>Kedusha</italic> spreads forth from Shabbat to the six days of creation, and the goodness of the six days are included in Shabbat. This is why the Torah stipulates seven days, for a man must offer something complete before the Holy One, blessed be He.</p>
<p>This means offering the sacrifice after it has passed the six days of creation, which include in them all the forces of goodness, and also the day of Shabbat meaning, to acknowledge the Holy One, blessed be He, as sovereign over all the goodness that He instilled into the six days. Then he may offer it before God. If it had not passed through the six days of creation, then it would not have received all the forms of goodness from the blessed God, and how then could a man offer to God something that is not complete? Even if it experienced the Shabbat it still would not have received the completeness of the creation. Yet, when it experienced the six days of creation and also the Shabbat, meaning that it drew within it all the forms of goodness and crowned the Creator over all of them, then the offering is acceptable. Therefore it is written, &#x201C;and you shall give it to Me on the eighth day.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;An ox or a ewe, do not slaughter it and its young in the same day.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 22:28)</p>
<p>The Targum of Yonatan ben Uziel<sup><xref rid="fn202">44</xref></sup> renders this verse, &#x201C;Just as your Father is merciful, so too shall you be merciful in the land. An ox or a ewe, do not slaughter it and its young in the same day.&#x201D; In explaining this same verse, the holy Zohar writes (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 92b), &#x201C;We have learned that actions below arouse corresponding actions from above. If a man acts properly below, it arouses a similar power from above. If a man acts with kindness in the world, it arouses kindness from above, etc. It is like this also for the opposite. If a man acts with cruelty in the world, cruelty is aroused on that same day, and strikes him.<sup><xref rid="fn203">45</xref></sup> In the same way that a man deals with the world, so too is he dealt with.&#x201D; This explanation is in order to teach the children of Israel the attribute of kindness.</p>
<p>We find in the Gemara (<italic>Megillah</italic>, 25a), &#x201C;one was leading the prayer before Rava and said, &#x2018;You who were merciful with the bird&#x2019;s nest [and commanded that the mother be driven away before taking her eggs], be merciful with us&#x0021; You who were merciful in saying, &#x2018;do not slaughter it and its young on the same day, so too be merciful with us&#x0021;&#x2019; Rava said, &#x2018;this student really knows how to appease his teacher [God].&#x2019; Abaye answered, &#x2018;but we are taught that one who prays in this way should be silenced&#x0021;&#x2019; [And this is the Halacha.].&#x201D; For he is only falsely making all the attributes of God into mercy [when there is also judgment].<sup><xref rid="fn204">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>To truly understand the meaning of this law of &#x201C;it and its young,&#x201D; as translated by Yonatan ben Uziel and as explained in the holy Zohar, we must understand that it is only in order to teach the children of Israel the way of kindness. The holy Zohar calls all of the <italic>mitzvot</italic> &#x201C;advices&#x201D; (<italic>Shemot</italic>, 82b) meaning advice that teaches the children of Israel good behavior.</p>
<p>However, in the Gemara of <italic>Megillah</italic> we find a man praying, &#x201C;just as You were merciful,&#x201D; and still we are told that he is to be silenced. In prayer, we are forbidden from ascribing any attributes of man&#x2019;s limited understanding to the blessed God. This is because the function of prayer is to allow the blessed God to enlighten the eyes of man to a place that he otherwise could not have reached. Attributes of behavior are something that man has the power to comprehend. The Pesikta says &#x201C;to call directly to Him, and not to call to His attributes.&#x201D; When a man prays and mentions one of the attributes of God, it might seem that he is praying, God forbid, that the attribute save him, where the attribute only contains that which the blessed God measured into it. For this reason an attribute is called a <italic>midda</italic> (<italic>moded</italic>, measure; <italic>midda</italic>, attribute). Prayer is only to be directed to His very essence, may it be blessed, which &#x201C;no mind can comprehend&#x201D; (<italic>Patach Elyahu</italic>, in the Tikkunei Zohar, 17a).</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and you shall bring an omer [a measurement, tenth of an</italic> ephah<italic>] of the first fruits of your harvest to the</italic> Cohen.&#x201D; (Vayikra, 23:10)</p>
<p>It is said in the writings of the Ari&#x2019;zal (R. Yitschak Luria, 1534&#x2013;1572) that &#x201C;<italic>omer</italic>&#x201D; is the numerical equivalent of <italic>yakar</italic>, meaning precious (both equal 310). This is because on the first night of Passover such a great and precious light is opened for Israel, and all the good of the blessed God is before their eyes, and then afterward, it is closed. Therefore, on the second night of Passover, a great cry remains in the heart of all of Israel, and they cry out to the blessed God, &#x201C;how precious [<italic>yakar</italic>] are Your kindnesses, E-lohim&#x0021;&#x201D; wanting the blessed God to return to them the illumination of His count. On this, Shlomo said in his prophecy (Mishlei, 8:17), &#x201C;I love those that love Me,&#x201D; meaning that for them I will open up the illumination of my countenance, and this corresponds to Passover, a time when the love of the blessed God opens up for Israel. Furthermore (as the verse continues), &#x201C;those who rise early will find Me,&#x201D; meaning that after they strive and wake up early to receive the blessed God&#x2019;s goodness, then He will fix a complete and uninterrupted illumination in their hearts. This happens on the festival of Shevuot.</p>
<p>We find the Hebrew word for &#x201C;they will find Me&#x201D; is written in this verse with an extra letter, <italic>nun.</italic> The letter <italic>nun</italic> is numerically equivalent to 50, and represents the fifty gates of wisdom existing in the Torah, and on Shevuot<sup><xref rid="fn205">47</xref></sup> it is instilled in the heart of every man to be drawn after the will of the blessed God. This is done through the mitzvah of counting the days of the omer between Passover and Shevuot. This is because the omer is an offering of barley (<italic>seorah</italic>), which teaches of being scrupulous in following the will of the blessed God, and not deviating from it even to a hair&#x2019;s breadth (<italic>sea&#x2019;rah).</italic> Through this one merits <italic>Binah</italic>&#x2013;Understanding and being instilled with the illumination of the blessed God.</p>
<p>On Passover they only received a temporary illumination, which was then immediately concealed, for they saw the preciousness of the light of the blessed God but were unable to be drawn after His will. This is why our sages say, &#x201C;a maidservant saw more at the splitting of the Red Sea that the prophet Yechezkel,&#x201D; namely &#x201C;a maidservant,&#x201D; for all of Israel were like maidservants under the yoke of blessed God, and were unable to fulfill their desire in His desire. Then on Shevuot, with the giving of the Torah, then the blessed God fixed <italic>Binah</italic>&#x2013;Understanding in the hearts of all men, and the will of the blessed God was understood in their very souls. This <italic>Binah</italic>&#x2013;Understanding is called &#x201C;the moon.&#x201D; The moon teaches of the understanding of the heart, whereas the sun teaches of <italic>Chochma</italic>&#x2013;Wisdom that is clear to all. <italic>Chochma</italic>&#x2013;Wisdom are the 613 <italic>mitzvot</italic>, so that a man may know the proper course of action by means of the principles of the <italic>mitzvot.</italic> By means of these principles he knows what is permitted and what is forbidden. The moon, however, teaches of the understanding in the heart with which a man may sanctify himself even in (delineate himself from) that which is permitted to him. This means that he has a deep and instinctive feeling for where he must create his boundaries, knowing how to recognize just how far is the will of the blessed God, and any further is not the will of the blessed God. Man needs this understanding under all circumstances.</p>
<p>This is why it says in the Midrash (<italic>Bereshit</italic> Rabba, 6:5), &#x201C;The nations of the world measure the year by the sun, and Israel measures the year by the moon.&#x201D; This is because the sun is the <italic>Chochma</italic>&#x2013;Wisdom, which is in man&#x2019;s power of comprehension, but the moon teaches of life that is above the intellect. We see this in the very word for moon, <italic>yareyach</italic> in Hebrew, which is similar to <italic>reyach</italic>, smell, for Israel can &#x201C;smell&#x201D; the roots of everything in the lives of the world to come. This is even so with the moon existing under the sun, as we find in the holy Zohar (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 237b), &#x201C;which of them is greater? Certainly the moon is above, and the sun of the nations of the world is under this moon, and this sun receives its light from the supernal moon, and illuminates. See the difference between them and Israel. Israel holds on to the moon and evolves (receives a concatenation of light) from the supernal sun, and is unified in the place of the illumination of the supernal sun, holding on to it. This is as it is written, &#x2018;you who cleave to Hashem your God are all alive today.&#x2019;&#x201D; The sun receives its light from the supernal moon, and the only one ever to merit the direct illumination of the supernal sun was Moshe Rabeynu.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And you shall count from the day after the Sabbath [first day of Passover] from the day you brought the omer of the wave offering &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 23:15)</p>
<p>Concerning the counting of the omer, since the time between Passover and Shevuot requires special vigilance, as it is written (Yirmiya, 5:24), &#x201C;in the weeks [<italic>shevuot</italic>] the laws of the harvest are guarded for us.&#x201D; It is written in the Midrash (<italic>Vayikra</italic> Rabba, 28:3), &#x201C;then He will guard us from evil winds and evil dews,&#x201D; for this time of the year needs special protection from evil winds and evil dews. Therefore the blessed God commanded us at this time to count, and each day to anticipate eagerly the moment of the giving of our Torah. In this time we are especially enjoined to guard the <italic>mitzvot</italic>, for those who guard the <italic>mitzvot</italic> will not know misfortune, and in their merit will be saved.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; on the festival of Succot seven days unto Hashem &#x2026; And on the first day you shall take fruits of the citron tree, palm branches, boughs of thick trees [myrtle], and willows of the stream, and you shall rejoice &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 23:34&#x2013;39)</p>
<p>The <italic>succa</italic> and the four species correspond to the &#x201C;ten depths&#x201D; mentioned in the <italic>Sefer Yetsira</italic> (the Book of Creation, the most ancient of all kabbalistic texts, attributed to Avraham Avinu). They are the depth of the &#x201C;six directions&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn206">48</xref></sup> the depth of good and its opposite, the depth of the beginning, and the depth of the end. The <italic>pri eyts hadar</italic>, the fruit of the citron tree, corresponds to the &#x201C;depth of good,&#x201D; since the citron has both taste and smell,<sup><xref rid="fn207">49</xref></sup> meaning the good that endures in the world to come, of which we may eat in this world. Palm branches correspond to the &#x201C;depth of the end,&#x201D; as it is written in the Gemara (<italic>Ta&#x2019;anit</italic>, 29b), &#x201C;to give you hope for the end [Yirmiya, 29:11] Rav Yehuda son of Rav Shmuel son of Shilat said in the name of Rav, &#x2018;this means palm branches.&#x2019;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn208">50</xref></sup> Another reason is because date palms are the last mentioned in the enumeration of the seven species of the land of Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn209">51</xref></sup> and this hints at the end and hope. Branches of a thick tree (myrtle) correspond to the &#x201C;depth of the beginning,&#x201D; because they have smell, meaning a man may smell to the depth and foundation that which the world was created upon. Willows of the stream correspond to the &#x201C;depth of evil,&#x201D; as they have no taste or smell. Concerning this it says in the Gemara (<italic>Baba Batra</italic>, 61a), &#x201C;anyone who gives his life to die for the words of Torah, do not quote a Torah law in his name.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn210">52</xref></sup> It seems that this deed will not bring him any benefit in this world or the world to come. Still, we are told to bind the willow together with the other species, which hints at man&#x2019;s completion. For man&#x2019;s completion he must also find this power, that he can deliver over his very life to die, even though from this he will not receive and benefit, even in the world to come. If man succeeds in finding this power, then he will understand all the other depths in completeness. Therefore it is called &#x201C;a depth,&#x201D; for even in the evil he will find good, and in the future the blessed God will return to him all that he lost in delivering his life over for the words of Torah.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And you shall take fine flour, and you shall bake twelve loaves of bread [</italic>challot<italic>], two tenths of an</italic> ephah <italic>in each one.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 24:5)</p>
<p>Israel is called the challah (bread) of the Holy One, blessed be He, for they sustain the glory of the blessed God in this world the way bread sustains the strength of man. For this, the blessed God sustains them in two worlds, as it says with the creation of man, where it is written (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 2:7), &#x201C;and he formed,&#x201D; &#x201C;<italic>vaYYatser</italic>,&#x201D; with two <italic>yud</italic>s, hinting at endurance in two worlds. This is also hinted at in the &#x201C;two-tenths of an <italic>ephah</italic> in each one.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;On the day of Shabbat, on the day of Shabbat [meaning every Shabbat] you shall arrange them before Hashem &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 24:8)</p>
<p>Why is the cantillation marking on the first &#x201C;on the day of Shabbat&#x201D; <italic>kadma ve&#x2019;azlah</italic>, and on the second &#x201C;on the day of Shabbat&#x201D; is <italic>munach revi&#x2019;i</italic>? The showbreads (<italic>Lechem haPanim</italic>) teach of the love of the blessed God for Israel. This is as we find in the Gemara (<italic>Chagiga</italic>, 26b), &#x201C;see the great love God has in having you before Him [for when the old breads were removed after six days before the new Shabbat, they were as fresh as when they were first placed].&#x201D; From this great strength<sup><xref rid="fn211">53</xref></sup> is realized in Israel, and for this reason the blessed God commanded that two lambs be offered with the bread. Shabbat is the internal quality of the six days of the week. This is explained in the Gemara (<italic>Pesachim</italic>, 106a), &#x201C;from the fourth day until Shabbat is called before Shabbat, and from Shabbat until the third day is called after Shabbat [we are always either coming to or coming out of Shabbat].&#x201D; Therefore the blessed God commanded us to offer two lambs, meaning to give thanks for the past, and to cry out for the future. From the bread, great strengths will come to Israel for the past, for surely the blessed God will complete them for the good. This is why the cantillation marking on the first &#x201C;on the day of Shabbat&#x201D; is <italic>kadma ve&#x2019;azlah</italic>, meaning for that which had already happened (<italic>kadam</italic> means &#x201C;came before&#x201D;) and been exhausted (<italic>azal</italic> means &#x201C;used up or failed&#x201D;), the blessed God will help, making it for the good. The cantillation marking on the second &#x201C;on the day of Shabbat&#x201D; is <italic>munach revi&#x2019;i</italic>, meaning that for all of this, man must cry out over what is to come, and place (<italic>munach</italic>) his mind as far as is humanly possible in order to not deviate from the will of the blessed God. If a man does this, accepting upon himself that for everything in the future he will not deviate from the will of the blessed God as much as is humanly possible for him to do so, then the blessed God will help him with the past. Thus He will show him that he never did anything against the will of the blessed God.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And the son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and this son of the Israelite woman and a man of Israel fought together in the camp. And the Israelite woman&#x2019;s son blasphemed Hashem&#x2019;s name &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 24:10)</p>
<p>A passage in the holy Zohar reads (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 106a), &#x201C;boring a hole in something that was closed,<sup><xref rid="fn212">54</xref></sup> as one would say, &#x2018;and he bore a hole in his door.&#x2019;&#x201D; This is because he wanted to open up the depth that is hidden in the future, where the blessed God will refine all of Israel to the point that they will be clean of all sin. Then he would be a complete member of Israel. This is as the Gemara writes (<italic>Yevamot</italic>, 23a), &#x201C;an idolater or a slave who has intercourse with a Jewish woman, the child is fit to enter Israel, he is not a bastard, but he is called &#x2018;a tainted Israelite.&#x2019;&#x201D; (So he felt incomplete, or &#x201C;tainted.&#x201D;) He wanted to open a force where in the future the Holy One, blessed be He, would make such refinements where there would not even remain a residue of the sin among the sinners of Israel. This is as the holy Zohar says (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 106a), &#x201C;He took the final <italic>Hei</italic> in God&#x2019;s holy name and cursed him, in order to defend his mother.&#x201D; This is because the final <italic>Hei</italic> hints at the world of <italic>Asiyah</italic>, the realm of making, or physical action. Thus it is, that the blessed God desires that we fulfill His commandments with our actions. However, he wanted to create an opening whereby the blessed God would effect salvation even without the actions of man.</p>
<p>This is as it is said in the Midrash (Tanchuma, <italic>Emor</italic>, 23; see Rashi on this passage), &#x201C;This incident was a reaction to the previous section [in Ch. 24, on the <italic>challot</italic>]. The king usually eats warm bread. Would he eat cold bread?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn213">55</xref></sup> The meaning is, in this world, all the effluence that man receives from the Holy One, blessed be He, is received in time through Shabbat, in place through the Mikdash, and in person through the Patriarchs and the community of Israel. However, he asserted that the blessed God could effect salvation at any time, at any place, and for any individual, all in and of themselves.</p>
<p>Also the Gemara writes (quoted in Rashi on this passage), &#x201C;He was responding to a previous incident (where the court had judged him guilty). He went to pitch his tent in the encampment of Dan.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn214">56</xref></sup> This is why the section of the one who cursed is included in the Torah, in order to teach us just how much one needs to separate himself from all kinds of angry complaints against God. The one who cursed, since he had distanced himself from the encampment of the Israelites, and had left the court of Moshe guilty, stood and blasphemed. His initial intentions, which were for the sake of Heaven, came out of being an Israelite from the side of his mother. He wanted to plant his roots in the encampment of the Israelites, and his intentions here were good. However, the angry complaints that came later emerged from the side of him that was Egyptian. With a man of Israel, his heart cleaves to the blessed God and his intentions are for the sake of Heaven even if the blessed God denies him some benefit. A true servant of God is one who distances himself according to the will of God, and in doing so he merits the greatest good. We find an example with a descendant of Aharon haCohen who is unfit for service in the Holy Temple because of some physical defect. In distancing himself from the service he thus merits great reward. However, one who is not of the root and branch of Israel, if he is distanced from some benefit, then he cannot contain himself, and will lash out in scorn.</p>
<p>This is as we find in the Gemara (<italic>Avodah Zara</italic>, 3a), &#x201C;in the future God will offer the nations the mitzvah of Succa. Then he will take the sun out of its sheath, and make it unbearably hot, so they will not be able to sit in the <italic>succa.</italic> Upon leaving, they will kick their <italic>succot.</italic> It is asked, &#x2018;are not Israelites also exempt from the mitzvah of <italic>succa</italic> if the weather makes it unpleasant?&#x2019; Yes, but they would not kick it upon leaving.&#x201D; With the nations, even if their intention is to fulfill the commandment of the blessed God, if they are prevented from it, they will lash out in scorn (literally, kick).</p>
<p>Therefore the great test of serving God will be with the commandment of <italic>succa</italic>, for this commandment enjoins us to leave a permanent dwelling and reside in a temporary dwelling. This requires being drawn to any place the will of the blessed God wants us to go, and not to complain even if the blessed God prevents us from performing His commandments. For since this is the will of the blessed God, in not doing the commandment one is now also fulfilling His will. If one who lashes out in scorn when he is prevented from the mitzvah, then this proves that when he was doing the mitzvah, his intentions were not for the sake of Heaven. This is why the blessed God commanded, &#x201C;go and take out the one who cursed,&#x201D; for when he wanted to pitch his tent in the camp of the Israelites, his intentions here were also not for the sake of Heaven.</p>
<p>This section is juxtaposed with the section that follows immediately, &#x201C;He that kills a man shall surely be to death. He that kills an animal,&#x201D; etc. This is because it is the way of the blessed God, after He had commanded to take out the one who cursed and stone him, which seems like the attribute of severe judgment, and even the shame he had suffered, to command concerning the utmost respect for created beings. With this intention He commanded concerning the restitution for killing an animal. For this reason it is said (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 24:19), &#x201C;and if a man cause a blemish in his neighbor, thus shall it be done to him [paying restitution].&#x201D; This is to say that there shall be one system of justice. Justice shall be both for the one who has false complaints against God and for all men. &#x201C;Thus shall it be done back to him&#x201D; (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 24:20) means that all shall see that he that harms another has the very same blemish.<sup><xref rid="fn215">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>For this reason the section discussing the <italic>succa</italic> is juxtaposed with the section discussing the menorah. The blessed God illuminates the eyes of man, and shows him that the blessed God is in charge. So too with the section discussing the showbreads, which hints at the love the blessed God has for Israel, meaning (<italic>Chagiga</italic>, 26b) &#x201C;see the great love He has for you&#x0021; All that the blessed God does is only for the good of Israel.&#x201D; Yet with one who is not of the root and branch of Israel finds it necessary to bring forth angry complaints against the blessed God, not able to contain himself and spitting it forth from his lips. This is all according to what has been explained in the section on the one who cursed. Such complaints do not come from Israel, for they know that all is for their good.</p>
<p>In this week&#x2019;s <italic>Sedra</italic> (<italic>Parsha</italic>) there are five passages preceding the passage about the festivals. This corresponds to the five kinds of angry complaints that a man can carry in his heart against the stern attributes of the Holy One, blessed be He. The first passage warns the <italic>Cohen</italic> against contamination from a dead body, and this corresponds to the anger one can have in his heart over the death and absence found in the world.</p>
<p>The second passage discusses the physical defects that would render a <italic>Cohen</italic> unfit to serve in the temple. A <italic>Cohen</italic> in this state could harbor anger against the severe judgment of the Holy One, blessed be He, in that He planted him in the branch of Aharon, and would have been fit to offer sacrifices to God and serve Him. Why then did He create him with a defect that prevents him from this <italic>Kedusha</italic> (holiness), for the <italic>Kedusha</italic> of a <italic>Cohen</italic>&#x2019;s service is immeasurable? Just as we see how much <italic>Kedusha</italic> there is in the mitzvah of eating matsah, how much more so in the <italic>Cohen&#x2019;s</italic> eating the sacrifices, <italic>kodshei shamayim</italic>, God&#x2019;s own food, as it were&#x0021; As we find in the Gemara (<italic>Pesachim</italic>, 57a), &#x201C;[how immeasurably awesome it was] when those in the temple would go in and eat of the <italic>kodshei shamayim.</italic> We see just how precious the eating of sacrifices was in the eyes of God, and all the more so the <italic>Kedusha</italic> of the <italic>Cohen</italic> in his service before God. So even seeing a <italic>Cohen</italic> who is rendered unfit to serve can cause one to be angry at God, for even though he may eat of the sacrifices, he is distanced from the actual service.</p>
<p>The third passage is about the <italic>Cohen</italic> who becomes impure. Surely the <italic>Cohen</italic> who was ready to serve God would guard himself beforehand, purifying his heart as much as he could, in order to avoid even an improper thought. How much more so would he then guard himself from defiling his body&#x0021; Then after, when something happened that distanced himself from the service of the blessed God and the eating of the sacrifices, the great cry would well up inside of him, asking why the blessed God did not help him in order not to be distanced from His service.</p>
<p>The fourth passage discusses blemishes in the sacrifices themselves, where a great cry would come from those bringing the sacrifices, asking why did the blessed God bother to give them goodness and property like that which he had and was unable to offer.</p>
<p>The fifth passage concerns a thanksgiving offering, of which it is said, &#x201C;he shall eat it on that day.&#x201D; This means that a man is required to give thanks over the past and cry out for what is to come, so as not to trust in tomorrow, but rather always stand in prayer and the fear of God. Thus he is forbidden from being released from this requirement when the future day comes. This gives way to a cry of anguish in the hearts of mankind, asking why the blessed God cannot simply be a constant refuge of strength, and let them do everything with complete confidence that the blessed God will help them. On this, David haMelech said (Tehillim, 92), &#x201C;Mizmor Shir, a song of the day of Shabbat,&#x201D; meaning (<italic>Tamid</italic>, 33b) &#x201C;in the future, the day which is eternally Shabbat, on this it is [as the Tehillim continues] &#x2018;good to give thanks to Hashem.&#x2019;&#x201D; This means that the Holy One, blessed be He, will teach <italic>Binah</italic>&#x2013;Understanding to Israel, causing them to understand that all the events of the past were all for the sake of man&#x2019;s benefit. This is why Tehillim 92 continues, &#x201C;and to sing to His supernal name,&#x201D; for the place from which the blessed God conducts the world above the level of man&#x2019;s intellect is called &#x201C;supernal.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Corresponding to these five passages, Israel was given five passages on the festivals of the year, and in them man receives strength and expansion of his consciousness in order not to come to the angry complaints mentioned above. Corresponding to the first passage we are given the section dealing with Passover, for Passover is the beginning of the illumination that the blessed God gives life to Israel. Shevuot corresponds to the passage dealing with a <italic>Cohen</italic> who is unfit for service, for with the giving of the Torah all those who were deficient were healed, and Shevuot teaches that the blessed God will heal everything so it will be well. Rosh Hashanah corresponds to the passage about a <italic>Cohen</italic> who had become impure, for impurity is really sadness, as has been explained (in the second piece in this week&#x2019;s <italic>Parsha</italic>). Therefore on Rosh Hashanah there is the mitzvah of sounding the <italic>shofar</italic>, in order that he will not hear anything that may depress him. Yom Kippur corresponds to blemished sacrifices, for at the moment Israel abandons all forms of pleasure and benefit in this world in order to fulfill the will of the blessed God, then strength and encouragement will come to all their good things and property. Corresponding to a thanksgiving offering, which teaches that a man must always have the fear of God, they were given the mitzvah of <italic>succa</italic>, meaning that the blessed God will protect man and surround him (just as a <italic>succa</italic> does even though it is not a permanent structure). The festival of Succot is called &#x201C;the time of our joy,&#x201D; meaning that the blessed God will give joy to man in promising never to abandon him.</p>

<chapter>
<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> B<small>EHAR</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And God spoke to Moshe at mount Sinai, saying: Speak to the children of Israel and say unto them, when you enter the land which I give you, you shall let the land rest a Sabbath unto Hashem.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 25:1&#x2013;2)</p>
<p>In this the blessed God promises Israel that when they come to the land of Israel their hearts will be at peace. &#x201C;Land&#x201D; teaches of the heart. This is &#x201C;let the land rest,&#x201D; that their hearts shall be at peace.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Speak to the children of Israel &#x2026; you shall let the land rest a Sabbath unto Hashem.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 25:2)</p>
<p>Three matters are discussed here: <italic>Shmitta</italic> (seventh &#x201C;rest&#x201D; year for the land), freedom of slaves (in the fiftieth year, the <italic>Yovel</italic>), and <italic>Ribit</italic> (the prohibition of lending at interest). In all three matters, the Blessed God is warning Israel against putting their trust in anything (of this world) that it would from the human view that it would be possible to rely upon. These three things&#x2014;<italic>Shmitta, Yovel</italic>, and <italic>Ribit</italic>&#x2014;each take a category of place, time, and person (<italic>olam, shana</italic>, and <italic>nefesh</italic>). The acquisition of fields and vineyards is the acquisition one could have in place and placing his trust in it. Concerning this the Blessed One commanded the <italic>Shmitta.</italic> That is to say, mankind cannot put his trust in places, but rather shall see that they belong to God, for in the seventh (<italic>Shmitta</italic>) year there is no recognition of ownership in one&#x2019;s acquisitions (anyone can come in and eat from his field). Through this he shall see that the land is God&#x2019;s.</p>
<p>Corresponding to placing one&#x2019;s trust in time, meaning, relying on amassing wealth from selling time, which we call taking interest, the Torah says, &#x201C;do not take interest from him.&#x201D; The whole point of interest is one selling his time, as it says in the Gemara (<italic>Baba Metsia</italic>, 63b), &#x201C;all compensation of money for waiting [postponing paying a debt] is forbidden.&#x201D;</p>
<p>As for man&#x2019;s acquisition in other people, that he feels he may trust his ability to use servants for his needs, God commanded concerning the freeing of slaves in the <italic>Yovel</italic> year. Thus he sees that he has no ownership of their bodies, and must set them free. Even at the time they are slaves, God commanded &#x201C;not to force him to serve with hard labor,&#x201D; that is, to understand that the body of the servant is not his domain.</p>
<p>God commanded these three <italic>mitzvot</italic> to show man that he may not put his trust in anything connected to time, place, or person&#x2014;only in the blessed God. This is why these three sections end with the statement, &#x201C;I am Hashem your God who brought you out of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan.&#x201D; This means that man should not assume that since these things have been prohibited from us, that His influence toward us is in any way reduced. &#x201C;I am the Hashem your God who took you out of Mitsrayim.&#x201D; Mitsrayim (Egypt) comes from the word for narrowness, limitation, to show that the pleasures of the world that are not coming from the side of Holiness are rooted in narrowness and constriction. &#x201C;To give you the land of Canaan&#x201D; means that the goodness that God gives us will be in <italic>Kedusha</italic> (holiness), and we will be able to extend it out to our surroundings, for our inheritance from God is the goodness of <italic>Kedusha, &#x201C;</italic>an inheritance without narrowness [limitations].&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and give the land a Sabbath unto Hashem.&#x201D;</italic></p>
<p>The point of the sabbatical year, the <italic>Shmitta</italic>, is to be a sign for Israel, for &#x201C;the land is God&#x2019;s and the fullness thereof.&#x201D; Concerning this the holy Zohar says (<italic>Bereshit</italic> 3b), &#x201C;there are [God created] large letters and small letters&#x201D; (referring to the occasional large or small letter in the Torah scroll). The small letter is <italic>Shabbat (ot</italic> means both sign and letter). <italic>Shabbat</italic> is a sign for Israel, for God is the motivator of everything, and the actions of man will do nothing. The large letter-sign is <italic>Shmitta</italic>, for with the passing of seven years there must necessarily be an entire year in which it is clear that the land is God&#x2019;s, and that no man has the power of action, only God alone.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;and you shall count seven Sabbaths of years &#x2026; then proclaim with the call of the shofar&#x2026; and each man shall return to his portion &#x2026; in the</italic> Yovel <italic>year each man shall return to his possession.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 25:8&#x2013;10)</p>
<p>The matter of the <italic>Shmitta</italic> and <italic>Yovel</italic> corresponds to the way of acting mentioned in the <italic>Pirkei Avot</italic> (Ch. 5:10), &#x201C;[one who says] what is mine is yours, what is yours is yours [is a hasid].&#x201D; <italic>Shmitta</italic>, the seventh rest year for the land,<sup><xref rid="fn216">58</xref></sup> corresponds to the attribute of &#x201C;what is mine is yours.&#x201D; In one sense, &#x201C;the land was given to mankind&#x201D; (Tehillim, 115:16). One can acquire the land, bringing forth from it all the good things of the world (for all kinds of good things of the world are included in the land, as it is written (<italic>Kohollet</italic> 3:20), &#x201C;all was from the dust&#x201D;). But still, in the seventh year he returns the land to God. At this time he ceases from toil and working the land voluntarily according to the will of God, keeping His ordinances. This is called &#x201C;what is mine is yours.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The <italic>Yovel</italic>, the fiftieth &#x201C;jubilee&#x201D; year,<sup><xref rid="fn217">59</xref></sup> corresponds to the attribute of &#x201C;what is yours is yours,&#x201D; for the commandment of <italic>Yovel</italic> requires that each one shall return to his possessions and to his family. For in truth, God was fair in how He put man in the land, and divided out an inheritance to each one according to his level, based on the root of his particular soul. He upheld each one on his particular banner, saying to them, &#x201C;they are My servants&#x201D; (see <italic>Vayikra</italic>, 25:42). Yet the progression of events caused mankind to demand many accounts from each other. This one merited to ascend and extend into another&#x2019;s borders, or to purchase the other to serve him, and the other descended and had to sell his possessions until he eventually had to sell himself into servitude.</p>
<p>Yet since the word of God endures forever and will not change, God forbid, based on the actions of mankind, so God&#x2019;s temporary judgments that pass over man will not reach the depth of the root of his soul. This is because God created a time for everything to return to its initial portion. Thus He created the <italic>Yovel</italic> year so that each could return to his place and the portion allotted to him from God, as it is said, &#x201C;the <italic>Yovel</italic> year shall be holy to you&#x201D; (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 25:12).</p>
<p>In other words, in the year of <italic>Yovel</italic> the light of the <italic>Kedusha</italic> of God will be revealed to all, by means of the proclamation of the <italic>shofar</italic> on Yom Kippur. Each one will then recognize that the portion of his fathers that was given to him by God and will remain with him. As for that which came to him by means of the actions of man, although there was an agreement of acquisition placing him under another&#x2019;s domain until now, yet since he does not belong to the other at the root, he must be returned to the place he was originally given. This is the illumination of God in the year of the <italic>Yovel</italic>, that everyone can return to his place, that everything has its own place. This recognition and understanding can come only after fulfilling the mitzvah of <italic>Shmitta</italic>, that is, delivering all over to God, and by means this reaching the attribute of &#x201C;what is yours is yours.&#x201D;</p>
<p>That is to say, recognizing the place ascribed to everything at its root, as in the saying of the Midrash (<italic>Bereshit</italic> Rabba, 43:19), &#x201C;all is in the possession of the blind until God comes and opens their eyes.&#x201D; This means that even though the human eye will see that this servant belongs to this master, and this field to that one who bought it, yet whoever God illuminates, opening his eyes, will see that all the actions of man will not create a change in the depth of the will of God even minutely. In the <italic>Yovel</italic> this light will be revealed. This is the attribute of &#x201C;what is yours is yours,&#x201D; and is greater than the attribute of &#x201C;what is mine is yours.&#x201D;</p>
<p>By means of <italic>Shmitta</italic> and <italic>Yovel</italic> one shall see that all the good and wealth he has amassed not by the will of God, but by means of his own efforts, is not his, even though it is in his possession. Therefore this <italic>Parsha</italic> warns against theft, deception, and interest, to show that in the future it will be apparent that anything that came by means of these methods is not his. This is to counter the one who says to himself, &#x201C;if it is true that eventually a person will have only what was originally given him by God, then all efforts to gain wealth, to acquire things or expand borders, are in vain. Only what God gave him will remain his.&#x201D; Concerning this Shlomo haMelech said (Kohollet, 10:1), &#x201C;a little folly is more precious than honor or wisdom.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Meaning, although a man may refrain from toil in this world if he understands that none of that which he has gained by his efforts will remain with him, it is the &#x201C;little folly&#x201D; within him that caused him to gather wealth even though he knows it is only temporary. Just the same, he may merit by means of his efforts. And even though the time will come for him to return to his portion and everything to return to its place, he will nonetheless profit, for he will return to the other only the measure of what is allotted him. Yet the limit and the border that God set to recognize between one man&#x2019;s portion and another&#x2019;s will be added to his border since at the beginning he extended his border into the other&#x2019;s. In the very action of exerting himself in this world, a little security will remain for him, even from the other&#x2019;s portion that will be returned. Thus from all the efforts that one exerts in this world, this understanding will remain with him forever.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And you shall not wrong one another, and you shall fear your God &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 25:17)</p>
<p>This verse is also directed to great souls of precious value, when they see someone doing something against the will of the blessed God, and want to accuse against him, punishing him. On this the Holy One, blessed be He, &#x201C;do not wrong,&#x201D; and similarly did David haMelech say (Tehillim, 50:20&#x2013;21, following R. Hirsch&#x2019;s translation), &#x201C;You sit and speak against your brother, you slander your own mother&#x2019;s son. You have done these things, and I stood by in silence, so you thought I was the same as you. Therefore I will reprove you, and set them in order before your eyes.&#x201D; &#x201C;You sit and speak against your brother, you slander your own mother&#x2019;s son&#x201D; means that he does so even though he is obliged to love his neighbor, as is commanded of him (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 19:18), &#x201C;you shall love your neighbor as yourself.&#x201D; Man must ask in his prayers for compassion toward his fellow man, but still, he wants to bring accusations against him. Therefore the Blessed God says, &#x201C;you have done these things, and I stood by in silence.&#x201D; If the blessed God sees fit to clarify matters, then even the actions of the <italic>Tsaddikim</italic> will not be meritorious in His eyes, for in the presence of the blessed God who can justify himself, and who can say, &#x201C;I have refined my heart&#x201D;? And still, the blessed God is silent, not revealing the shame of any man even if he shall sin.</p>
<p>&#x201C;You thought that I was the same as you,&#x201D; for he who brings accusations against his fellow man considers himself and his actions as refined as the will of the blessed God. He believes wholeheartedly that it is the will of the blessed God that he accuse the man who sins. To this grave error the blessed God says, &#x201C;Therefore I will reprove you, and set them in order before your eyes.&#x201D; This means that the blessed God will show truth to the face of he who points to the guilt of his neighbor and says that it is God&#x2019;s will that he do so. God reproves him by showing that the will of the blessed God is only to conceal all the sins of Israel. Thus is it written (Micha, 7:19), &#x201C;and cast all their sins to the depths of the sea.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Thus He will conceal them greatly so they will not be revealed and never more seen. So how could one say that the blessed God wants us to expose the guilt of our neighbors, expanding upon their sins? Even though the blessed God commanded man to reprove his neighbor and to try to distance him from all evil as much as is possible, this is only possible in a place where he knows he can help him by bringing him to the good, or through prayer, which will arouse compassion upon him to return him to the path of ethical behavior. However, if he cannot remove him from his errors, then he must judge him meritoriously, and not accuse him. Thus one cannot judge his neighbor as guilty, for perhaps his neighbor&#x2019;s <italic>yetser hara</italic> (inclination to evil) is greater than his own. Or, perhaps what he sees as an error or sin is actually permitted to his neighbor, for there are many things that are forbidden to one but permitted to another.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;A man who sells his house in a walled city, he may redeem it a year after it his sold, for a full year he shall have the right of redemption. And if it not be redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established forever to him that bought it throughout the generations, it shall not go out in the jubilee.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 25:29&#x2013;30)</p>
<p>The passage dealing with houses in walled cities teaches that man knows that all the matters of the <italic>Yovel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn218">60</xref></sup> are in order to make it clear that there is a time for everything. Even if a man sinned against the blessed God, He will not be angry with him forever. This passage teaches that such a situation only arises when a man sins in affairs between him and the Omnipresent. Although this arouses the attribute of stern judgment where he must sell from his portion or be sold as a servant, it shall not be so forever, for he will go out in the <italic>Yovel</italic>, and a man shall return to his portion. However, a man may arouse the attribute of stern judgment from a sin between man and his fellow man, with the main example of this being if a man sins by shaming his fellow man publicly with his words. This is what the verse meant when it said, &#x201C;if a man shall sell his house in a walled city,&#x201D; for the tongue is called &#x201C;a house in a walled city,&#x201D; as it says (<italic>Arachin</italic>, 15b), &#x201C;I have given you two walls [the lips].&#x201D; By means of this a man could, God forbid, sell and lose all his merits, and his fellow man could buy them. On this Shlomo haMelech said (Mishlei, 25:28), &#x201C;He who cannot control his own spirit is like a city with its walls broken down.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn219">61</xref></sup> The advice given for this is to reconcile with his fellow man within a year, and on this it says, &#x201C;for a full year he shall have the right of redemption.&#x201D; &#x201C;And if it not be redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established forever to him that bought it throughout the generations,&#x201D; meaning that if he does not reconcile with his fellow man, then his merits will permanently remain with his fellow.</p>
<p>This is the explanation of the difference between how the verse is spelled in the Torah scroll and how it is read. &#x201C;The house that is in the walled city&#x201D; or &#x201C;the house that has a wall&#x201D; is written in Hebrew <italic>asher lo homa. Lo</italic> is written in Hebrew <italic>lamed aleph</italic>, which would mean &#x201C;does not have a wall.&#x201D; However, we read it as if it were written as <italic>lamed vav</italic>,&#x201D; &#x201C;which has a wall.&#x201D; The meaning is that a man who has no control over his spirit is called one &#x201C;without a wall,&#x201D; and the one who controls his spirit is called one &#x201C;with a wall.&#x201D; Thus it is that all the merits of one who cannot control his spirit will remain in the possession of the one who could control his spirit and remained silent.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;But with the cities of the Levites, the Levites may redeem the houses of the cities of their possession at any time.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra 25:32)</p>
<p>The Levi means one who serves God; for by means of service a man can reclaim all that he had lost, and receives even additional good.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; you shall not set up any image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it, for I am Hashem your God.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 26:1)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Image&#x201D; means that a man abandons his consciousness and intellect (becoming like inanimate stone), and will deliver over his life for every matter of God. This is as it is written (Sifre <italic>Shoftim</italic> 6), &#x201C;even though it was beloved before Me in the days of the patriarchs.&#x201D; For now a man need give over his life only to avoid three transgressions (incest, idolatry, and spilling of blood), and only in the <italic>Beit Hamikdash</italic> (Temple) can a man abandon his intellect before the blessed God.</p>

<chapter>
<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> B<small>ECHUKOTAI</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;If you walk in My statutes &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra 26:3)</p>
<p>It is written in the Midrash (<italic>Yalkut Shemoni</italic> Mishlei, Ch. 22), (Tehillim, 111:10) &#x201C;The beginning of wisdom is the fear of God. It is also written (Mishlei 22:4), &#x2018;following humility [on the heel of humility] is the fear of God.&#x2019; The same thing that made wisdom a crown for the head, made humility the heel for the sole.&#x201D; The matter here is, by the way of nature one may contemplate and arrive at the conclusion that there is a Creator and Master of the world, by means of looking into his intentions for all that is created. But this is only at the onset of one&#x2019;s bringing himself close to the words of Torah, and then this wisdom is called <italic>Yirah</italic>, the fear of God. This is because once one knows that there is a Creator and Master, he has to listen to His voice and experience <italic>Yirah</italic> before Him. Yet after a man achieves the quality of <italic>Anavah</italic>, humility, then the previous understanding of <italic>Yirah</italic> will be understood at the blink of an eye, with no need of contemplating and investigating to achieve it, but it will be simple and clear to him. This is &#x201C;If you walk in My statutes,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn220">62</xref></sup> meaning that His statutes will be carved into your hearts.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;If you walk in My statutes, and keep My commandments, and do them.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 26:3)</p>
<p>All the while that the <italic>Kedusha</italic> of the blessed God is not carved<sup><xref rid="fn221">63</xref></sup> and permanently installed in the heart of man, he is called &#x201C;standing.&#x201D; In this state he needs to constrict himself in all his affairs, not expanding according to his will, for now refraining from action is preferable. And when a man turns to the words of Torah to the extent that they are carved in his heart and fixed there, then he may experience expansion, and go wherever his desire leads him, for God is with him. This is as it is said in the Midrash (<italic>Devarim</italic> Rabba, <italic>Parsha</italic> 2:1), &#x201C;and since there is a Jewish wayfarer.&#x201D; And it is written in the Gemara (<italic>Shabbat</italic>, 31b), &#x201C;since it is written, &#x2018;At the commandment of the Hashem they encamped, and at the commandment of the Hashem they traveled,&#x2019; it was like demolishing in order to rebuild on the same site.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;If you walk in My statutes, and keep My commandments, and do them.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 26:3)</p>
<p>It is written in the Midrash (<italic>Vayikra</italic> Rabba, 35:1), &#x201C;I considered my way, and I turned my feet back to Your testimonies (Tehillim, 119:59). Each day I would plan on going to a certain place, but my feet brought me to the house of prayer and the house of study.&#x201D; Would you say that David haMelech would, God forbid, have the intention of doing mundane or insignificant things? And furthermore, if his feet would lead him to the house of study yet his intention was not for the sake of Heaven, then it would be like the principle &#x201C;I did not struggle but I found.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn222">64</xref></sup> Yet a man must struggle in this world. If he brings himself to be purified, then he will be helped to find all the good, but not without struggle. The matter is explained thus. In the realm of Torah study, you will find words of Torah so incredibly precious that other words of Torah will seem small in comparison. This is as we find in the Gemara (<italic>Shabbat</italic>, 10a), &#x201C;Those who occupy themselves with prayer but neglect to study Torah are called abandoning eternal life and occupied with temporary life.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Thus with all matters in the realm of Torah study there are many levels, one over the other. This is as it is written in the Gemara (<italic>Megillah</italic>, 15a), &#x201C;The way of the Holy One, blessed be He, is not like the way of flesh and blood. Man first prepares the pot on the fire, and then pours the water into it. Hashem first pours the water, and then prepares the pot, as it is written (Yirmiya, 10:13), &#x2018;with the sound of His gathering a multitude of water in the heavens.&#x2019;&#x201D; It is man&#x2019;s nature, when he wants to do something, he first imagines it, considering what benefit he will receive from the action, and then does it. This is called &#x201C;preparing the pot,&#x201D; meaning that he prepares vessels to receive, then considers how to receive, and then receives, that is, he does the action.</p>
<p>The way of the Holy One, blessed be He, is not thus. Rather, He first places the water, and then prepares the pot. With the Torah and the <italic>mitzvot</italic> that He commanded us to do, He commanded us to learn and do with all our hearts and souls, but not according to the measurement of the boundary of our intellect, to estimate the total goodness of the action. Rather, His will must be fulfilled without any preparation from the side of man, just to gaze before His presence and be drawn after His will. Then after, the Holy One, blessed be He, will show the man the depth of wisdom and good hidden within the action. This is called &#x201C;pouring the water.&#x201D;</p>
<p>That is, man must fulfill the will of the blessed God with simplicity, and then afterward &#x201C;prepare the pot,&#x201D; where afterward the blessed God shows him the benefits that will be given him from this action. This is as David haMelech said, &#x201C;I considered my way. Each day I would plan on going to a certain place.&#x201D; He feared that he might fulfill the will of the blessed God only according to the understanding of his intellect. The awesome depth of the will of the blessed God is here like a mundane action, because the blessed God wants us to fulfill His will without any preparation from the side of man.</p>
<p>This is as it is said, &#x201C;I considered my way,&#x201D; for the way is troublesome, as it is written (<italic>Berachot</italic>, 11a), &#x201C;the way is bothersome.&#x201D; Even if he goes to perform a mitzvah it is still called &#x201C;his way,&#x201D; for when one goes even to perform a mitzvah, but does it only according to his intellectual understanding, he is disturbed. This is not the case when he goes in the way of simplicity to fulfill the will of the blessed God, for then he is not at all disturbed, for he trusts that God will help him since he is acting with simplicity. &#x201C;And I turned my feet back to Your testimonies.&#x201D; Here David haMelech is saying, &#x201C;even though I thought that perhaps I was not fulfilling the will of the blessed God in a complete way, the blessed God showed me that I had not turned away from His will even a hair&#x2019;s breadth. I was in the houses of prayer and the houses of study.&#x201D; Thus his desire was only in places inhabited by the blessed God.</p>
<p>This is the explanation of &#x201C;and I turned my feet back to Your testimonies.&#x201D; A testimony is something clear. In a place where man stands before the blessed God without any turning away from his side, there his mind is clear and without disturbance or weakening, and he is not afraid. This is as it is written in the Midrash (<italic>Devarim</italic> Rabba, 2:2) on the desire of Moshe Rabeynu to enter into the land of Israel, &#x201C;of this it is written, &#x2018;his desire melted like a moth.&#x2019;&#x201D; Even though it is written in the Gemara (<italic>Sotah</italic>, 14a), &#x201C;did he need to eat of the fruits of the land?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn223">65</xref></sup> He wanted to fulfill the commandments that one may only do in the land. Nonetheless, it is written of him, &#x201C;his desire melted like a moth,&#x201D; for in relation to the will of the blessed God this was called desire, as the fulfillment of commandments and the will of the blessed God must be without any external coloring.</p>
<p>This is the explanation of &#x201C;if you will walk in my testimonies.&#x201D; &#x201C;If&#x201D; means uncertainty. Even if a man goes in the way of the Torah, he must still be in a state of uncertainty whether he is fulfilling the will of God in a state of completeness, for the will of God is very deep. This is as we find with David haMelech, who feared that perhaps he was not fulfilling the will of God in completeness. This is why David haMelech said (Tehillim, 18:12), &#x201C;He spreads out darkness as His secret place, and His immediate surroundings are His covering, darkness of waters, thick clouds of the heavens.&#x201D; &#x201C;He makes (<italic>yashet</italic>) darkness be His veil&#x201D; means the darkness and the uncertainty that comes to man concerning his actions and his fear that he is not fulfilling the blessed God&#x2019;s will in completeness. Through this the secret place of the truth of Torah will be revealed unto him. Here, <italic>yashet</italic>, &#x201C;He spreads out,&#x201D; means revelation, as in (Shmuel 1, 2:8), &#x201C;[for the pillars of the world are God&#x2019;s] and He has set (<italic>yashet</italic>) the world [revealed it] upon them.&#x201D; By means of the darkness the hidden is revealed to him, precisely because it engenders uncertainty in man over the words of Torah. Through this process he will arrive at their truth.</p>
<p>This is as it is written in the Gemara (<italic>Baba Metsia</italic>, 84a), &#x201C;Reb Yochanan that Reish Lakish used to offer him twenty-four difficulties in the law, and give them twenty-four possible solutions. By this, his understanding of the law was deepened.&#x201D; Thus it is, when one experiences uncertainty, perhaps he is distanced from the blessed God, and by this sees that he must bring himself closer. &#x201C;His immediate surrounding are His covering [literally, <italic>succa</italic>].&#x201D; Then the blessed God reveals to him that He surrounds and covers the man, even in places where he cannot reach. In places his hand does not reach<sup><xref rid="fn224">66</xref></sup> the blessed God will guard him from deviating from His intentions. &#x201C;The darkness of waters&#x201D;&#x2014;this is a man whose lusts and desires bring him darkness and frighten him, lest he is not fulfilling the will of the blessed God in completeness. Here water symbolizes desire, for the most compelling desire found in the world is when one is thirsty for water.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Thick clouds of the heavens&#x201D; means that since his desires are in the darkness, by means of this the blessed God will reveal unto him that he can fulfill commandments that seem to contradict one another. &#x201C;Thick clouds&#x201D; are practical commandments, from the term &#x201C;thick&#x201D; (tangible). <italic>Shechakim</italic>&#x2014;&#x201C;the heavens&#x201D; are things that contradict one another, for with two opposing forces, when they meet they will pound (<italic>yeshachaku</italic>) each other. The blessed God will illuminate his eyes to the truth of these seemingly contradictory commandments, like the eradication of Amalek, which appears to be extreme cruelty. And of the one who incites abandonment of the Torah (<italic>mesit</italic>), it is written (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 13:9), &#x201C;do not be merciful.&#x201D; We see these, and also how the Holy One, blessed be He, warns of being ever compassionate. Then, just man may uphold the attribute of compassion with ease, so too will he be able to fulfill the opposite with ease, for he will be drawn after the will of the blessed God, and according to the will of God will it be easy for him to do.<sup><xref rid="fn225">67</xref></sup> We find an example of this with Avraham Avinu, where even though his main attribute was <italic>Chesed</italic> (loving-kindness), he still stood firm when tested on all sides, and routed the kings of Sodom in war according to the will of the blessed God.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And you shall eat old store [the obsolete], and you shall take out the old because of the new.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 26:10)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Old&#x201D; is a place where man has begun to give up concerning an action. &#x201C;Obsolete&#x201D; is an action where he has already given up completely. The Holy One, blessed be He, promises the man that he will yet see benefit from these actions, for the blessed God will heal, and give them for the good. This is on condition that man accepts upon himself to sustain all His words in justice, not transgressing the will of the blessed God. &#x201C;He will take out the old because of the new&#x201D; is his resolution to fulfill all of His words with justice before the blessed God, and he shall not trust in the Holy One, blessed be He, to be merciful with him. This is as it is said in the Gemara (<italic>Chagiga</italic>, 16a), &#x201C;do not let your evil inclination incite you by saying, &#x2018;sin, and the blessed God will forgive you.&#x2019;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn226">68</xref></sup> You shall rather carefully consider all your actions. This is as has been explained on the verse, &#x201C;on the day of Shabbat, on the day of Shabbat you shall arrange,&#x201D; above in <italic>Parshat Emor.</italic></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And you shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall devour you.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 26:38)</p>
<p>It is written in the Gemara (<italic>Makkot</italic>, 24),<sup><xref rid="fn227">69</xref></sup> &#x201C;&#x2018;Rav said, I have misgivings about that verse, And you shall perish among the nations.&#x2019; Rav Papa responded, &#x2018;Could it not perhaps be understood as something lost and searched for, as it is written, I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek your servant.&#x2019;&#x201D; Rav was perplexed at the sin of a nocturnal emission, where it seems as if it is beyond man&#x2019;s ability to rectify. Therefore he was answered with &#x201C;perhaps it could be understood as something lost and searched for,&#x201D; meaning that the blessed God has the power to return all to <italic>Kedusha.</italic> After this, the Gemara continues, &#x201C;what really perplexes me is the second half of the verse, &#x2018;and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.&#x2019;&#x201D; This refers to the sin of engaging in sexual relations with an Aramite, which seems to be even further from being able to fix. Thus he was answered, &#x201C;it is like the way squash and pumpkins are eaten.&#x201D; He said this because it is the nature of squash and pumpkins, that once they are plucked from above (the ground), they immediately return and sprout again. In the same way, the blessed God can fix even this, for he will make it clear that no sin existed in Israel at the root, God forbid.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, a man who makes a vow to give the estimated value of a person to Hashem.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 27:2)</p>
<p>After the verses of stern rebuke, the blessed God gave Israel a stronghold in the section dealing with values, namely, that a man can redeem himself from anything. Four kinds of redemption are mentioned: houses, fields, people, and animals. This corresponds to the four times the word &#x201C;seven&#x201D; is written in the verses of rebuke.<sup><xref rid="fn228">70</xref></sup> &#x201C;Seven&#x201D; represents how the blessed God is exacting down to a hair&#x2019;s breadth. For this, He gave us four ways to redeem ourselves. This is not that the man himself may effect the redemption, but rather that if one sees that another needs redemption, he can redeem him. This is as it is said in the Gemara (<italic>Arachin</italic>, 20a), &#x201C;one who says, &#x2018;so and so&#x2019;s value is upon me.&#x2019;&#x201D; In the section dealing with values for redemption (Ch. 27), we find thirty-three verses, not counting the verse &#x201C;and God spoke,&#x201D; and the final verse &#x201C;these are the commandments,&#x201D; which do not deal with the subject of values. These correspond exactly to the thirty-three verses of rebuke. Corresponding to the verse (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 26:38), &#x201C;and you shall be destroyed among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall devour you,&#x201D; which is the greatest of all fears, is the verse (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 27:25), &#x201C;and every estimation shall be according the holy shekel.&#x201D; In this way, every verse in the section of values for redemption corresponds to a verse in the <italic>Parsha</italic> of stern rebuke in order to bring redemption to all that is said there.</p>

<ftnote id="fn164">6. This phrase is taken from a highly relevant passage in the Gemara (<italic>Baba Batra</italic>, 75a), which reads:</ftnote>
<ftnote>Rabbah in the name of Rav Yochanan said further: The Holy One, blessed be He, will make seven canopies for every <italic>Tsaddik;</italic> for it is said, &#x201C;And the Hashem will create over the whole dwelling of Mount Tsion, and over her assemblies, a cloud of smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory shall be a canopy&#x201D; (Yeshayahu, 4:5). This teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, will make for everyone a canopy corresponding to his status. Why is smoke required in a canopy? Rav Chanina said: Because whoever is envious of the scholars in this world will have his eyes filled with smoke in the world to come. Why is fire required in a canopy? Rav Chanina said: This teaches that each one will be burned because of his jealousy at the superior canopy of his friend. Alas, for such shame&#x0021; Alas, for such reproach&#x0021;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn165">7. The sons of Aharon each offered a censer full of incense but lit it from &#x201C;outside fire,&#x201D; and as R. Shlomo Carlebach once explained, they were trying to bring the Messiah, by making the outside fire like the inside fire.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn166">8. Perhaps because the smoke from the incense rises up to connect heaven and earth, or because the ten <italic>sefirot</italic> and the surrounding light out of which all is formed are hinted at in the eleven spices in the incense. Furthermore, as mentioned elsewhere, Rabbi Yitzhak of Acco writes in his explanation <italic>Meirat Eineihem</italic>, that smoke, <italic>ashan</italic>, is an acronym for: <italic>olam, shana, nefesh</italic>, meaning place, time, and soul, the three main components of existence, as discussed in the <italic>Sefer Yetsirah.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn167">9. Meaning that anyone who merits to enter into a height of the secrets of the Torah as they did, must be as the Cohen Gadol, the high priest, and be enwrapped in the intense fear of the blessed God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn168">10. Rav Nehemiah explains it in this way: &#x2018;Wherefore have ye not eaten&#x2019; etc? (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 10:17). &#x2018;Perhaps,&#x2019; said Moshe to Aharon, &#x2018;its blood entered the innermost sanctuary?&#x2019; [and therefore should have been burned]. &#x2018;The blood was not brought into the sanctuary&#x2019;, he answered. &#x2018;Perhaps it was taken outside of the boundary [taken outside of the Temple, and therefore should have been burned]?&#x2019; he suggested. &#x2018;It was in the sanctuary&#x2019;, he replied. &#x2018;And perhaps you offered it in a state of mourning, and thus disqualified it?&#x2019; &#x2018;Moshe&#x2019;, he answered, &#x2018;did my sons offer it? I offered it.&#x2019; Then he exclaimed, &#x2018;Behold, the blood of it was not brought within, and it was in the sanctuary, then you should certainly have eaten it, as I commanded, that they should eat it in a state of mourning.&#x2019; He said to him: &#x2018;And there have befallen me such things as these, and if I had eaten the sin-offering today, would it have been pleasing in the sight of the Hashem (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 10)? Perhaps you heard it in this way only about sacrifices of the hour (special sacrifices)? For if [you would apply it] to the [regular] sacrifices for all generations, [you may argue] <italic>a minori</italic> from tithe, which is of lesser holiness. For if the Torah said of the tithe, which is of a lesser holiness, &#x201C;I have not eaten thereof in my mourning,&#x201D; how much the more does it apply to sacrifices, which are more holy?&#x2019; When Moshe heard that, it pleased him. He admitted his mistake and Moshe was not ashamed to say, &#x2018;I had not heard it&#x2019;, but said, &#x2018;I heard it and forgot.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn169">11. The first dispute was between the sun and moon, who were originally both great lights, equal in size. The moon asserted &#x201C;two kings cannot wear the same crown,&#x201D; so God told the moon, &#x201C;go and reduce yourself.&#x201D; This is, as it were, the introduction of dispute in the world.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn170">12. <italic>Regel</italic> in Hebrew means both &#x201C;habitual&#x201D; (<italic>hergel</italic>) and &#x201C;foot.&#x201D;</ftnote>

The connection between &#x201C;male&#x201D; (<italic>zachar</italic>) and &#x201C;memory&#x201D; (<italic>zecher</italic>) is apparent here, a male child symbolizing the memory of the initial preparation of salvation that comes to fruition after the process in serving God described above.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn176">18. He took his very handicap of spreading gossip, and used its power to spread Torah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn177">19. Different forms of leprosy would create diferent levels of impurity. Here a scab would have been a secondary or derivative level of impurity.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn178">20. This matter is explained in the <italic>Mei HaShiloach</italic> on the book of Melachim 1, Ch. 22 concerning Rechavoam. There it says, &#x201C;Then King Rechavoam sent Adoram, who was over the forced labor; and all Israel stoned him with stones, and he died. Therefore King Rechavoam exerted to mount his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. The matter is discussed in the Gemara (<italic>Sanhedrin</italic>, 48b), &#x2018;Rechavoam had an issue [signaled in that he had to exert himself to mount his chariot]. This shows that his sin, for &#x201C;issue&#x201D; means rushing and preceding the proper time, even though afterward the kingdom would be his. And thus, in the future the kingdom of the house of David will spread over all of Israel, yet here, with Rechavoam, he preceded his time, in exerting to mount his chariot.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn185">27. That is to say, the first thing he is asking for with every matter is that it be will of God, to such an extent that even his personal desires are the will of God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn186">28. &#x201C;Affliction&#x201D; means a personal motive that would sway him from clearly seeing God&#x2019;s will. See above, <italic>Parshat Chukat</italic>, under &#x201C;and the children of Israel camped at Ovot,&#x201D; for more on this.</ftnote>

This is, everywhere his soul is, there that place moves more.&#x2019; Rabbi Elazar said, &#x2018;father, is it not known that the soul [<italic>neshama</italic>] resides in the heart [mind], and spreads forth to all the extremities of the heart? He said to him, &#x2018;My son, of this it is written (Ruth, 3:7), &#x2018;she uncovered her feet, and laid down.&#x2019; According to the actions of man, thus the soul goes out of her place, and descends below her place.

<ftnote id="fn191">33. This is hinted at in the name of the vowel, <italic>kamats</italic>, which is related to the word for restricting, delineating, like the <italic>komets</italic> offering, a hand measurement of grain. Also, in the kabbalistic understanding of the vowel, <italic>kamats</italic> represents the Crown, <italic>Keter</italic>, which is wholly connected to what is above, <italic>Malchut</italic>, of the upper level. In a sense, separated from and encircling the body of its own arrangement of <italic>sefirot</italic> as a crown is on top of the head.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn193">35. Rabbi Yitschok also said: Why were the reasons for Torah laws kept hidden?&#x2014;Because in two verses reasons were revealed, and they caused Shlomo haMelech the greatest sage in the world, to stumble. Thus it is written, &#x201C;He shall not multiply wives for himself.&#x201D; To which Shlomo haMelech replied, &#x201C;I will multiply wives yet let my heart not be perverted.&#x201D; However, we read, &#x201C;When Shlomo haMelech was old, his wives turned his heart away.&#x201D; It is further written, &#x201C;He shall not multiply to horses for himself&#x201D;; concerning which Shlomo said, &#x201C;I will multiply them, but will not let Israel return to Egypt.&#x201D; However we read, &#x201C;And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn194">36. This also shows how <italic>peyot</italic> teach of the essential connection between the intellectual and the heart, or kindness.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn195">37. R. Hirsch understands <italic>nechila</italic> as related to <italic>nahala</italic>, or inheritance, meaning, crying out for what God gives us based on our actions. The Meiri relates it to the sound of the crying itself, for the word <italic>nechila</italic> is related to the word for the drone of a swarm of bees.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn196">38. The verse &#x201C;you shall not offer,&#x201D; refers to animals fit to offer in the temple. What about an animal where even its price cannot be used to buy a temple sacrifice?</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn199">41. In truth there is only the difference of a hair&#x2019;s breadth that the firmament separates between them, only one must accept them according to the will of the blessed God. Similarly it is with the lamb offered with the omerbarley offering, which is placed double&#x2014;two <italic>esronim</italic> of barley representing the lower waters and the upper waters, and the lamb hints at the firmament separating between them. <italic>Tashlum.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn200">42. &#x201C;On the outside&#x201D; means that they deemed him mentally unfit, or that he did not have a clear understanding of the mysteries of creation. The Steinsaltz Gemara quotes the explanation of the &#x201C;Otsar Hakavod,&#x201D; which interprets the upper and lower waters as purely spiritual matters, and the discussion is trying to find the source of supernal entities and of the lower entities. According to R. Yehoshua, on the first day of creation there is no separation between any of these entities at all, and everything existed as a single unified creation. Ben Zoma understood the description in the Book of <italic>Bereshit</italic> describes the order in which everything was created, and R. Yehoshua understood that there were elements mentioned in the creations of the first day that only came into being later.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn201">43. Ben Zoma made the mistake in understanding there to be a great difference between the upper waters and the lower waters, for truly they have one source, as water signifies desire. Man possesses two kinds of desire, one that was imprinted in him from his birth, as explained in the Midrash (Rabba <italic>Bereshit</italic>, 8), that the world is filled with loving-kindnesses (<italic>chasadim</italic>), and in this one could make the mistake of being merciful with the cruel. However, when a man is merciful and experiences desire from the side of his intellect, it is without any impurity. If a man were to direct the loving-kindness in his nature to the will of the blessed God, then it is even far greater than that which he does with his intellect.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Therefore it does not say in the Tehillim (148) that the waters that are below the heavens shall praise the name of God, for what is man, and what can he do with his intellect? But that which he can do with his nature, this is the Godly power within him. Thus it is that Ben Zoma understood a great difference, where truly, in the future, when God will make it clear that everything in the world came from Him, then it will be clearly seen that nothing separates between the upper waters and the lower waters. This is why, before entering into the garden of the secrets of the Torah, Rabbi Akiva warned (<italic>Chagiga</italic>, 14b), &#x201C;when you arrive at the stones of pure marble, do not say, &#x2018;water, water,&#x2019;&#x201D; for the main point of his warning was not to identify water two times, because at their source, they are one.

If the evil inclination say to you: Sin and the Holy One, blessed be He, will forgive you, do not believe it, for it is said: &#x2018;Do not trust in a friend,&#x2019; and &#x2018;friend&#x2019; means none other than one&#x2019;s evil inclination, for it is said: &#x2018;For the inclination of man&#x2019;s heart is evil.&#x2019; And &#x2018;familiar friend&#x2019; is none other than the Holy One, blessed be He, for it is said: You are the familiar friend of my youth.&#x201D;</ftnote>

Rav Papa attacked this, saying, &#x201C;Could it not perhaps rather be taken in the sense of something lost and searched for (as <italic>avad</italic> in Hebrew could mean both perished or lost), as it is written, &#x2018;I have gone astray like a lost sheep, seek Your servant&#x2019;&#x201D; (Tehillim, 119:176). But it was the latter part of the verse that perplexed Rav, &#x201C;And the land of your enemies shall eat you up.&#x201D; Mar Zutra then pointed out a difficulty, saying, &#x201C;Might it not be understood in the way that cucumbers and pumpkins are eaten?

<chapter>
<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> B<small>AMIDBAR</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And God spoke to Moshe in the wilderness of Sinai in the Tent of Appointed Meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second year from their departure from the land of Egypt, saying, Raise [count] the heads of all the congregation of the children of Israel.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 1:1&#x2013;2)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Raise&#x201D; signifies elevation. By means of counting the number of all the tribes, each individual will experience elevation, and a special significance will be seen in each one. This is as it is written (Hoshea, 2:1), &#x201C;And the number of the children of Israel will be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or counted.&#x201D; This verse seems to contradict itself (v. Gemara <italic>Yoma</italic>, 22b), for at the beginning it says, &#x201C;and the number,&#x201D; implying that they can be counted, and at the end it says, &#x201C;which cannot be measured.&#x201D; But in truth, the community of Israel as a whole is without number, and what was said, &#x201C;and the number,&#x201D; was said concerning the specific souls of Israel, that each one should have a number.</p>
<p>This is said in the sense that something that is counted will be important in the eyes of the blessed God, as it is written (Tehillim, 87:6&#x2013;5, Tr. of Hirsch), &#x201C;God will count when he registers the peoples.&#x201D; &#x201C;But of Zion it is said, every man that was born there, the Most High maintains her thus.&#x201D; &#x201C;God will count when he registers the peoples&#x201D; meaning that the Providence of the Holy One, blessed be He, also extends to the nations of the world, yet not in an individual way, but over them all, in a general way, for the maintenance of the species. &#x201C;But of Zion it is said, every man that was born there, the Most High maintains her thus&#x201D; means that the Providence of the Holy One, blessed be He, is over each individual soul.</p>
<p>This is the meaning of &#x201C;and the number of the children of Israel,&#x201D; that every one will be absolutely necessary. The greatness of the blessed God is seen in the entire community of Israel as a whole, and if just one member of that community is missing then the mixture will be deficient. It is as if the image of the king were made up of a mosaic of many small parts, and if just one of the parts were missing, then the picture of the king would be lacking. So at the time when each member of Israel is counted, then He is the greatness in all of Israel, for each one of Israel is a portion of the blessed God. This is as it is written (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 32:9), &#x201C;for His nation is a portion of God.&#x201D; Each individual possesses one of the attributes of the Holy One, blessed be He, and at the time when that individual is counted, then the blessed God himself is present in that attribute which he possesses, and clearly whatever is being counted is at that time the greatest of all. This is how each member of Israel has a special state of elevation.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; in the wilderness of Sinai, in the Tent of Appointed Meeting &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 1:1)</p>
<p>It is written in the Holy Zohar (<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 117a), &#x201C;since the Torah and the Mishkan [Tabernacle] were established, the Holy One, blessed be He, wanted to count its soldiers, how many soldiers there were for the Torah and how many soldiers there were for the Mishkan.&#x201D; This can be understood through what is written in the Tikkunei Zohar (70a), (the word) &#x201C;In the Beginning (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, in Hebrew, which can be divided into, <italic>Bet Reshit</italic>) means two beginnings. These &#x2018;two beginnings&#x2019; are the two commandments, &#x2018;and you shall contemplate [the <italic>mitzvot</italic>] day and night,&#x2019; and the commandment of the king to write a second Torah scroll [in addition to the one that every Jew is commanded to write].&#x201D; Even when it comes to a man&#x2019;s thoughts to do something good, the man still must make sure that his heart is refined and cleaned from all dross and refuse. If he does not, then this action will also not be complete but lacking. We find this even with the Patriarchs, all of whose actions were done for the sake of Heaven. However, at the times when they did not intend to the deepest levels of the will of the blessed God, then this manifested itself in later generations in souls that were not good. For when it comes to thought, then there is no <italic>tsaddik</italic> in the land who can say, &#x201C;I have refined my heart and purified my mind,&#x201D; as is explained in the verse (<italic>Shemot</italic>, 13:18), &#x201C;and the children of Israel left Egypt armed.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This is as King David said (Tehillim, 93:2), &#x201C;Your throne is henceforth [<italic>meaz</italic>] established, You who are everlasting,&#x201D; which the Holy Zohar explains (<italic>Shemot</italic> 54a) on the word [<italic>meaz</italic>] &#x201C;henceforth,&#x201D; which is made up of an <italic>aleph</italic> and a <italic>zayin, &#x201C;aleph</italic> rides on <italic>zayin.&#x201D; Aleph</italic> teaches of the beginning of a thought, and <italic>zayin</italic> (also meaning seven) teaches of the completed action, for <italic>zayin</italic> corresponds to the seven days of creation. So when the thought is connected to the action it is then called <italic>az</italic> (<italic>aleph</italic> and <italic>zayin</italic> together). This is the explanation of the two commandments mentioned above. &#x201C;And you shall contemplate the Torah night and day&#x201D; corresponds to thought and will, which are in complete accordance with the will of the blessed God, and the commandment for the king to write an additional Torah scroll corresponds to action. This is why it is called &#x201C;a commandment for the king,&#x201D; because the actions of King David were greatly refined in the will of the blessed God. This is the explanation of &#x201C;soldiers of the Torah and Soldiers of the Mishkan.&#x201D; &#x201C;Soldiers of the Torah&#x201D; is the power of thought and the desires of Israel for the words of Torah. &#x201C;Soldiers of the Mishkan&#x201D; means the words of Torah that are instilled as a dwelling in the heart of Israel to the extent that even the actions that come to being are an expression of the will of the blessed God.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Count the heads &#x2026; number them according to their armies, you and Aharon. And a man of each tribe shall be with you &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 1:2&#x2013;4)</p>
<p>The matter of counting relates to what is said in the Gemara (<italic>Berachot</italic>, 58a), &#x201C;one man&#x2019;s mind is not similar to another&#x2019;s.&#x201D; The blessed God allotted to each one goodness and life, and one is not similar to his fellow. Therefore it is said, &#x201C;count [literally, &#x201C;raise&#x201D;] the head,&#x201D; or to stand each one in his proper place. By means of this he will be in his place, prominent and elevated. Therefore it is said, &#x201C;you and Aharon,&#x201D; because Aharon corresponds to the &#x201C;soldiers of the Mishkan [Tabernacle],&#x201D; which signifies Divine service, and Moshe signifies the &#x201C;soldiers of the Torah.&#x201D; All of the life of Israel is included in these two, Torah and service. &#x201C;And a man of each tribe shall be with you,&#x201D; for the prince of the tribe knows the proper place of each one in his tribe. If he were to exchange one man&#x2019;s place for another&#x2019;s, then the condition of the tribe would not be complete. This may be likened to one who plants a garden in an intricate order, where if one planting is missing or exchanged for another, then it will be recognized that the garden is not complete. And Israel is called (Yesahaya, 61:3), the planting of God in which He is glorified.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And with you shall be a man of each tribe, he is the head of his father&#x2019;s house.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 1:4)</p>
<p>This shows that each tribe needed three: Moshe, Aharon, and the prince of the tribe. This was according to the law and judgment whereby a portion of the <italic>Kedusha</italic> of the Patriarchs exists within each tribe. According to the way in which these three saw to how many souls this <italic>Kedusha</italic> could be divided and spread forth, thus was the number of souls in the tribe. This is as we find in the Gemara (<italic>Baba Batra</italic>, 121b), &#x201C;Yair son of Menashe was equal to greater part of the Sanhedrin,&#x201D; and they needed these three: Moshe, Aharon, and the prince of the tribe. This goes according to what is written in the holy Zohar (<italic>Shemot</italic>, 200a), &#x201C;there are three points to the Torah.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn229">1</xref></sup> Thus we find that when one wants to enjoy anything in this world, he should see that it meets three qualifications. First, it should be sweet to the palate. Second, it should not damage his health. This is as it is written in the Gemara (<italic>Pesachim</italic>, 42b), &#x201C;Everything that is good for this one is bad for the other one.&#x201D; And third, he should not be too immersed in this delight, for he must make sure that he is well for the rest of his life, and if the delight disturbs him too much, he will not take care to prepare tomorrow&#x2019;s needs.</p>
<p>Thus it is with matters of Torah. First, a man must look toward the world to come, but not disturb himself from his affairs in this world. Second, he may not harm any one of Israel, for all of Israel makes up one body, and if he harms another it is as if he is harming one of his own limbs. Third, the man must take care that it is also good for him. Thus Moshe Rabeynu is called (Zohar, <italic>Vayikra</italic>, 53b), &#x201C;the agent of the King,&#x201D; as he was appointed by the blessed God to see that when the assembly of Israel expands, it does not, God forbid, expand against God&#x2019;s will. Aharon is called &#x201C;the agent of the Queen,&#x201D; and it was his job to see that each tribe expands, it does not expand in a way that will distress other tribes. Each prince would stand by its tribe when it was drawing a flow of goodness and wanted to increase. Just as these three judged the situation, thus would be the number of souls in the tribe.</p>
<p>Of the tribe of Gad it is said, &#x201C;the family of Izni.&#x201D; In <italic>Parshat Pinchas</italic>, Rashi explains, &#x201C;Izni is the Etsbon family, and I do not know why the name was changed.&#x201D; This can be understood according to the passage in the Gemara (<italic>Ketubot</italic>, 5b), &#x201C;Why are the fingers [<italic>Etsbaot</italic>, like the name of the Etsbon family] of man in the shape of a spike? This way, if he hears something that is not proper, he can put his finger in his ear.&#x201D; Therefore when they descended into the impure air of Egypt, they went by the name Etsbon (like finger), for they would close their ears in order not to receive anything that was not the will of God. Then when they entered the land of Israel, where the air is filled with <italic>Kedusha</italic>, they were called &#x201C;<italic>Izni</italic> [whch means ear],&#x201D; for their ears were open to hear and receive the <italic>Kedusha</italic> of God from the goodness of the land.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And God spoke to Moshe and Aharon saying, each man shall camp according to his banner, with the sign of his father&#x2019;s house, the children of Israel shall camp encompassing the tent of appointed meeting.&#x201D;</italic> (Vayikra, 2:1)</p>
<p>It is written in the Midrash (Tanchuma, <italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 11), &#x201C;What will we see in the Shulamite, as the dance of Machanayim.&#x201D; The Midrash explains that this verse refers to the camping of the tribes. (The nations say &#x201C;return&#x2014;we will make you leaders and noblemen. &#x201C;As the dance,&#x201D; Israel responds, &#x201C;you could not come close to giving us the greatness that Hashem gave us in telling us how to camp in the desert.&#x201D;) When we camped according to the banners, each one was standing on his rightful place at his root, and he knew his place. In the same way the names of the princes of each tribe teaches of the preciousness included in every member of that tribe.</p>
<p>&#x201C;[The prince] of Yehuda was Nachson ben Aminadav.&#x201D; <italic>Nachson</italic> teaches of anger as it is related to the word for snake, &#x201C;<italic>nachash</italic>.&#x201D; It appeared as if there was anger in the tribe of Yehuda. Therefore the blessed God testified that the anger in Yehuda was filled with the spirit of self-sacrifice and giving. (The last three letters in Aminadav, are the root of the word for volunteering, <italic>nedivut</italic>.) Ben&#x2014;son of&#x2014;means deep understanding (<italic>havana</italic>), so he was called <italic>Ben Ami Nadav</italic>, which means that at the depths he was filled with the ability to give. This is as it is explained in the holy Zohar (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 40b), &#x201C;[The king establishes the land by justice,] but he who demands gifts overthrows it (Mishlei, 29:4). &#x2018;He who demands gifts&#x2019; is Eisav. But did not David also demand gifts? With David it is different, for of him it is written, with beautiful eyes.&#x2019; [Shmuel 1, 16:12].&#x201D; Because the Torah describes David&#x2019;s red hair, it seems on the outside to be a sign of anger. This is as we find in the Midrash (<italic>Bereshit</italic> Rabba, 63:11), &#x201C;when Shmuel saw the redness of David, he feared that he was one who would spill blood like Eisav, so the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, see his beautiful eyes. This one [Eisav] takes it upon himself to kill. But David does not take it upon himself to kill, rather goes according to the judgment of the Sanhedrin.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn230">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;Of Yissachar was Netanel ben Tsooar.&#x201D; &#x201C;Netanel&#x201D; which literally means &#x201C;given from God,&#x201D; means that the blessed God gives <italic>Chochma</italic> (wisdom) in his heart. &#x201C;Tsooar&#x201D; is related to the word &#x201C;young.&#x201D; He saw himself as small and young, and as such knew that he had no power from his own side. Thus he was a vessel ready to receive all the effluence of the blessed God. &#x201C;Tsooar,&#x201D; in the sense of young, also shows that he knew his place, and knew who he was smaller than in comparison. The blessed God effused understanding unto him, as he was the first one to give the advice to offer sacrifices for the dedication of the Tabernacle, as is found in the Midrash (<italic>Bamidbar</italic> Rabba, 12:19). This advice (the understanding, and the first sacrifice) was effused to him from the blessed God, so therefore his very name means &#x201C;given from God,&#x201D; as God gave him <italic>Chochma.</italic> Notwithstanding his divinely bestowed wisdom and understanding, he still knew his place, knowing who he was younger and smaller than, and knew that Yehuda ruled his brothers, so therefore Yehuda offered the first sacrifice.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And for Zevulun, Eliav ben Cheilon.&#x201D; There is great strength in this tribe. The name &#x201C;Eliav ben Cheilon&#x201D; teaches of this, for all their strength was only from the forms of <italic>Chochma</italic> that the blessed God effused to them. Thus even when they were occupied with worldly matters, even then the blessed God effused strength and vigor to them in order to succeed. This is Eliav ben Cheilon, for <italic>Av</italic>, meaning &#x201C;father,&#x201D; represents wisdom,<sup><xref rid="fn231">3</xref></sup> and, <italic>Cheilan</italic> represents strength, as mentioned above.</p>
<p>&#x201C;For Reuven, Elitsoor ben Shdeioor.&#x201D; <italic>Elitsoor</italic> means strength, from the word for rock, <italic>Tsoor</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn232">4</xref></sup> <italic>Shdeioor</italic> teaches that all his strength comes from the great light that God illuminates (<italic>Shadday</italic> is God the Almighty, and <italic>oor</italic> is light). This is precisely true for the tribe of Reuven, as Reuven signifies sight (<italic>Reu</italic> means see, hence light). Thus he sees in every situation how he is standing in the presence of God. This brings him to a great state of <italic>simcha</italic> (joy), as it is written (Mishlei, 15:30), &#x201C;Joy comes to the heart from the light of the eyes.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;For Shimon, Shlumiel ben TsooriShaddai.&#x201D; <italic>Shloomiel</italic> means that his heart is faithful to the blessed God (<italic>Shloom</italic>&#x2014;<italic>Shalem</italic>, or faithfulness. <italic>E-l</italic>&#x2014;God). <italic>Ben TsooriShaddai</italic> and because his heart is faithful the blessed God will save him. (Again, <italic>Tsoori</italic>, &#x201C;my Rock&#x201D; and Shaddai as the Almighty God who brings salvation.)</p>
<p>&#x201C;For Gad, Elyasaf ben Deu&#x2019;el.&#x201D; In other words, even though the blessed God gives him the power to gather (<italic>assaf</italic>) all the good in the world, still, he recognizes that the Creator is in control (<italic>Deu&#x2019;el</italic> means &#x201C;know that there is God&#x201D;), and will not cease from upholding the Torah even when wealthy. At times when he is in tune with the attribute of the love of God he is called <italic>Reu&#x2019;el</italic>, from the word for beloved friend, <italic>Reiah.</italic> Then at the time when he is in tune with the attribute of the fear of God, he is called <italic>Deu&#x2019;el</italic>, know that there is God. Owing to this, in the section of the offerings of the princes, he gave the sin offerings, meaning that each one understood where he was lacking and there precisely was the principal state of completeness, for real completeness is when one recognizes his deficiency. This is as it is written (Kohellet, 10:1), &#x201C;more precious than wisdom or honor is a little foolishness.&#x201D; This is why he is called <italic>Deu&#x2019;el</italic> when he is offering the sacrifices, for when a man comes to the state of completeness he needs fear.</p>
<p>&#x201C;For the tribe of Yosef, Efriam Elishama ben Amihud.&#x201D; This concerns the place when one is overpowered by the lust for any good, for the name, <italic>Elishama</italic> is related to (Mishlei, 15:30), &#x201C;a good report [<italic>Shmua</italic>] fattens the bones,&#x201D; and this is the place where lust overpowers the man. All kinds of good will come out of this, and this is &#x201C;<italic>ben Amihud</italic>,&#x201D; &#x201C;<italic>Imo Hod</italic>,&#x201D; the majesty is with him. <italic>Hod</italic>, or majesty (also splendor) is a place where a man yearns, and then is wholly subdued before the object of his yearning, dwelling beneath it. In a place of evil the blessed God commanded, &#x201C;you shall not bow yourself down,&#x201D; meaning not to be subdued beneath it. So was it with Yosef, even though he did not listen to his master&#x2019;s wife, as it is said in the Midrash (Tanchuma, Nasso, 28), &#x201C;He listened to God [similar in meaning to &#x201C;Elishama,&#x201D; &#x201C;Hear, God&#x201D;], and did not listen to his master&#x2019;s wife. Nonetheless he married her daughter.&#x201D; This is hinted at in &#x201C;<italic>ben Amihud</italic>,&#x201D; (meaning &#x201C;the Majesty of God is with him&#x201D;) for he yearns for the good according to the will of the blessed God.</p>
<p>&#x201C;For Menashe, Gamliel ben P&#x2019;dahtsoor.&#x201D; The name Gamliel is connected to the letter <italic>gimel</italic>, where the foot at the bottom left, &#x201C;stepping outside,&#x201D; as is said in the Gemara and the holy Zohar (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 244b), &#x201C;The <italic>gimel</italic> brings.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn233">5</xref></sup> &#x201C;<italic>ben P&#x2019;dahtsoor,&#x201D;</italic> even in a place where he goes outside,<sup><xref rid="fn234">6</xref></sup> God, the Rock, will redeem him (<italic>P&#x2019;dah</italic>&#x2014;redeem; <italic>Tsoor</italic>&#x2014;rock).</p>
<p>&#x201C;For Binyamin, Avidan ben Gidoni.&#x201D; Since Binyamin would stand on the book and gather in all kinds of goodness from among the nations, entering them into Israel, he was therefore called &#x201C;ben Gidoni,&#x201D; as he knew which kind of &#x201C;goodness&#x201D; was not proper, hewing it down (<italic>gadar</italic>) and not gathering it.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And for Dan, Achiezer ben Amishaddai.&#x201D; &#x201C;Achiezer,&#x201D; (meaning &#x201C;helper of my brother&#x201D;) as he knew how to save himself. He also knew where to limit himself, as his encampment was on the north side, which teaches of constriction.<sup><xref rid="fn235">7</xref></sup> &#x201C;Ben Amishaddai,&#x201D; for also the blessed God would help him.</p>
<p>&#x201C;For Asher, Pagiel ben Achran.&#x201D; He would do away with good that had become muddied (<italic>Achran</italic>, muddied) with uncertainty. (&#x201C;Do away with,&#x201D; literally, &#x201C;spoil.&#x201D;) In a place where he was uncertain if it is the will of God, he will not accept it.</p>
<p>&#x201C;For Naftali, Achira ben Einan.&#x201D; One who is immersed in the love of something does not know what his portion is. &#x201C;Achira,&#x201D; from the word for &#x201C;too late,&#x201D; for he is too late to receive the good. Still he keeps himself well intact, and is not immersed in the lust. &#x201C;Ben Einan,&#x201D; (like <italic>Ayin</italic>, eye) means that he has beautiful eyes to see his rightful portion. God allotted a portion to each tribe and effuses the light of life to each one unto itself, with no one tribe&#x2019;s portion similar to another&#x2019;s.</p>

<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> N<small>ASSO</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And God spoke to Moses saying, also count the number of the sons of Gershon according to their fathers house and their family, from age thirty and upwards, all who are eligible to serve in the army, to perform the service in the tent of appointed meeting &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 4:21&#x2013;23)</p>
<p>This <italic>Sedra</italic> explains the completion of the place where (there is the paramount concentration) of God&#x2019;s will. From the first mention of the building of the Mishkan (the Tabernacle) in <italic>Parshat Truma</italic>, until now, there are seventeen <italic>parshiot</italic>, seventeen being the numerical equivalent of the word for good (<italic>Tov</italic>), hinting at the primary goodness of place (<italic>makom tov</italic>). This relates to what is stated in Shmuel Two (7:10), &#x201C; I have made a place for my people Israel, and planted them, and they will dwell there, and will no longer be disturbed&#x201D; etc.</p>
<p>So we find with the completion of the Mishkan and camping of the Tribes around it, holiness (henceforth <italic>Kedusha</italic>) is fixed in the heart of Israel that we may be drawn after the will of God. Earlier, with the exodus from Egypt, though there was a visual apprehension of the Illumination of the Blessed God, we could still not be drawn after His will, as it is said (Mehilta <italic>B&#x2019;Shelach</italic>), &#x201C;a <italic>maidservant</italic> saw [at the splitting of the Red Sea more than the prophet Yehezkiel].&#x201D; At this time Israel was subject to (the mentality of) slavery, (hence maidservant) and did not yet have the choice to go according to the Illumination of the Blessed God. Also at the giving of the Torah, though the words of Torah were fixed in our hearts, they were not fixed with the strength to last the length of eternity.</p>
<p>However, with the completion of the Mishkan, the words of Torah were fixed in our hearts to last for all time. For this reason we did not enter the land of Israel immediately after leaving Egypt, because when we left the <italic>Kedusha</italic> of God was not yet permanently installed in our hearts. At that time the land was still under the power of the seven nations, called the refuse of the seven attributes of God (from <italic>Hesed</italic> to <italic>Malchut).</italic> Therefore, before the giving of the Torah and the completion of the Mishkan, since <italic>Kedusha</italic> was not yet fixed in the hearts of Israel, we could not at this time overpower the seven nations (inhabiting the Promised Land). So before entering the land, God commanded that the words of Torah and <italic>Kedusha</italic> be fixed in our hearts in order that we could later emerge victorious over the seven nations.</p>
<p>In this way, each one of us is obliged to fix the words of Torah in his or her heart before turning to the affairs of this world in order that we may later overpower anything that comes against us. The families of Gershon, Kehat, Merrari, Moshe, and Aharon were the ones to construct and carry the Mishkan. The sons of Kehat were the &#x201C;masters of the Torah,&#x201D; since they bore the Ark of the Covenant, and they knew the Torah judgment of any situation that they would encounter. The sons of Gershon were the &#x201C;masters of the fear [of God],&#x201D; since they bore the curtains covering the Mishkan like the heavens, and the boards that were seen in the Mishkan like the stars, the contemplation of which hints at fear. The sons of Merrari were the &#x201C;masters of <italic>mitzvot</italic> and good deeds,&#x201D; for they carried the planks of the Mishkan, which represent practical <italic>mitzvot</italic>, of which all in Israel have an understanding. And Moshe and Aharon and his sons are the &#x201C;masters of the Love of God,&#x201D; who constantly saw to it that the Torah was dispersed among the people, and this is called Love. Actually all those mentioned had within them all these good attributes, yet in each, one attribute was more apparent than the rest.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Count the number of the sons of Gershon, them also according to their father&#x2019;s house &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 4:22)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Them also&#x201D; is said with the sons of Gershon, where it is not said with the sons of Kehat. For &#x201C;count,&#x201D; literally &#x201C;raise,&#x201D; <italic>nasso</italic> in Hebrew, refers to a state of spiritual elevation.<sup><xref rid="fn236">8</xref></sup> The sons of Kehat achieved this state of spiritual elevation by (deliberately) entering themselves into situations of doubt and uncertainty, and by being tested. Of this it is said (<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 7:9), &#x201C;and he [Moses] did not give [wagons] to the sons of Kehat, upon them is a holy service, they shall carry upon the shoulder.&#x201D; In other words, from the act of carrying on their shoulder we learn that they had reached the state of patience necessary to enter into and cope with places of uncertainty. We also learn this from the name of the chief of the tribe of Kehat, Elitsafan ben Uziel. <italic>Tsafan</italic> comes from <italic>tsafoon</italic>, meaning hidden, that is, it was hidden in his heart that God was his strength and that he would not depart from God&#x2019;s will. With this he entered into places of uncertainty, thereby achieving <italic>hitnasut</italic>, spiritual elevation.</p>
<p>However, the special quality of the sons of Gershon was the fear of God, and with this they would get away from uncertainty with every situation that was not clear. In such an instance of uncertainty they would refrain from action, constantly proceeding with surety. For this reason it says &#x201C;them also,&#x201D; meaning that they also achieved a state of patience from the ability to remove themselves from uncertainty, thereby also achieving a spiritual elevation. With the sons of Merrari a leader is not mentioned (whereas with Kehat it is said, &#x201C;and Moses and Aharon and the chief of the community numbered the sons of Kehat&#x2026;&#x201D;) since they occupied themselves with practical <italic>mitzvot</italic>, of which all Israel has an apprehension (not only the leaders). The name of their chief teaches of this, Tsooriel ben Avichail, which translates as &#x201C;rock of God, my Father of valor,&#x201D; that is, they had a stronghold from not departing (from the <italic>mitzvot</italic>), since they acted with simplicity and without any doubt.</p>
<p>With the sons of Kehat and the sons of Merrari it says that they were numbered, &#x201C;by the hand of Moses&#x201D; (see 4:37 and 4:45), while with the sons of Gershon (4:41) &#x201C;by the hand of Moses&#x201D; is not mentioned. Moses teaches of purified wisdom<sup><xref rid="fn237">9</xref></sup> and intent for the sake of Heaven. The sons of Kehat derived their strength from the goodness of their intentions, and the sons of Merrari derived their strength from purity of action apparent to all. Yet the quality of the sons of Gershon&#x2019;s was the fear of God and getting away from uncertainty, which could not have been pure if they were to refrain from action in a place where God commanded action. In the end, when all are counted (4:49), it says &#x201C;by the hand of Moses&#x201D; to say that (in the end) all was purified and according to the will of the Blessed God.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and you shall send out of the encampment all who are leprous, and all who suffer from an gonorrheal emission, and all who have come in contact with the dead.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 5:2)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Leprous&#x201D; means anger, for the word for leprosy, (<italic>tsara&#x2019;at</italic>, contains the word &#x201C;evil,&#x201D; <italic>Ra&#x2019;a.</italic> (Gemara, <italic>Arachin</italic>, 15b). &#x201C;Zav,&#x201D; meaning one who suffers from a gonorrheal emission, is one who entertains lusts. &#x201C;One who comes in contact with the dead&#x201D; is depression. Therefore the law requires that the leper is sent outside of all three encampments,<sup><xref rid="fn238">10</xref></sup> because the attribute of anger has no place in all of Israel. &#x201C;One who suffered from a gonorrheal emission&#x201D; was sent outside of both the Machanei haLevia (see previous note) and the Machanei haShechina, for scholars of the Torah may not be steeped in lust. &#x201C;One who has come in contact with the dead&#x201D; is only sent outside of the Machanei haShechina, for Torah scholars also succumb at times to the attribute of sadness, as it is written in the Gemara (<italic>Ta&#x2019;anit</italic>, 4a), &#x201C;the Torah causes him to boil,&#x201D; and this &#x201C;boiling&#x201D; is depression. Thus he is not permitted in the place of the <italic>Shechina</italic> (the Mishkan, or the Temple itself), because &#x201C;strength and joy are in His place&#x201D; (Divrei haYamim 1, 16:27).</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Speak to the children of Israel</italic> &#x2026; <italic>a man or woman who commits any of the sins that men commit &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 5:6)</p>
<p>This sin of stealing from a convert (see Rashi on this verse) teaches of a sin where it appears to man that <italic>tshuva</italic> (repentance) is of no use.<sup><xref rid="fn239">11</xref></sup> However, the Torah teaches that nothing will stand in the way of <italic>tshuva</italic>, and the blessed God gives advice as to how nothing will fall irrecoverably into exile. So, too, with robbing a convert, it also seems as if it cannot be rectified. The intention of the Rashbi (Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai) in the Zohar was that the sin in question causes man to tremble to the core of his inner being and propels man to plead with the blessed God, pouring his heart out before the blessed God. For it is indeed an extremely grave sin. Knowing this, when the sin does not come to man, he would, of course, be overjoyed.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; a man whose wife is unfaithful, and commits a trespass against him.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 5:12)</p>
<p>In the Torah, the section discussing the waters of <italic>Sotah</italic> (the ritual for a man who suspects his wife) precedes the discussion of the laws of the Nazirite. In the Gemara, the law of the Nazirite precedes the law of <italic>Sotah. Sotah</italic> teaches of one looking into his own deficiencies, and upon doing so, withdraws himself, keeping himself within necessary boundaries in matters of Torah. Therefore <italic>Sotah</italic> is written first in the Torah, and afterward the law of the Nazirite. For truly (<italic>Gittin</italic>, 43a), &#x201C;one may not uphold the Torah unless he has failed in it.&#x201D; However, our sages of blessed memory, who are called &#x201C;the Torah of your mother&#x201D; (see Rashi on Mishlei, 1:8) and who love man and desire his well-being, put the tractate <italic>Nazir</italic> before the tractate <italic>Sotah.</italic> This means for man to separate himself before he comes to failing in keeping the words of Torah. Thus it will suffice for him to contemplate the passage of <italic>Sotah</italic> written in the Torah to understand in which aspect he must guard himself, and thereby not come to failure.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;May God bless you and keep you.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 6:24)</p>
<p>The holy name associated with the priestly blessing contains twenty-two letters, as is known. The first name (intended on the first word, <span dir="rtl">&#x05D9;&#x05D1;&#x05E8;&#x05DB;&#x05DA;</span>) is <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05E7;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05EA;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>. This name signifies a time when a man has not yet received his portion in the words of Torah, and cries out<sup><xref rid="fn240">12</xref></sup> to the blessed God to save him from the thoughts and desires that confuse him. Afterward, the blessed God has mercy upon him, and releases him from the confusion that disturbs him. This release is hinted at in the second name, <span dir="rtl">&#x05E4;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05E1;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05EA;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>, (which is intended on the second word, God&#x2019;s name), where the first two letters, <span dir="rtl">&#x05E4;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05E1;</span>, are related to expansion, as in (Tehillim, 72:16), <span dir="rtl">&#x05E8;&#xFB31;&#x05EA;&#xFB41;&#xFB44;</span>&#x2014;&#x201C;the abundance [or borders, as R. Hirsch translates] of a grainfield.&#x201D; This signifies how the blessed God grants him the expansion necessary to relieve him of his confusion. The next holy name (intended on <span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05D9;&#xFB2A;&#x05DE;&#x05E8;&#x05DA;</span>&#x2014;and keep you) is <span dir="rtl">&#x05E4;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05E1;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05E4;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05E1;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>, which means that the blessed God gives him an elevated status over all. (Two times <span dir="rtl">&#x05E4;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05E1;</span>, more than expansion&#x2014;elevation.) The subject of of spiritual elevation has in it a dilemma, which teaches of a great depth. How can blessed God give the state of spiritual elevation to two <italic>Tsaddikim</italic> in one generation, where each one is elevated in his portion and stature over all, even over the second one? This is as we find with Moshe and Aharon, where each one was singularly unique in his generation. This is understood through the fourth name, <span dir="rtl">&#x05D3;&#x05F2;&#x05D9;&#x05F2;&#x05D5;&#x05F2;&#x05E0;&#x05F2;&#x05E1;&#x05F2;&#x05D9;&#x05F2;&#x05DD;</span>. (The first three letters are intended on the word <span dir="rtl">&#x05D9;&#x05D0;&#x05E8;</span>&#x2014;shall illuminate; the last four on God&#x2019;s name, which follows.) <span dir="rtl">&#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05D5;</span>&#x2014;<italic>Diyo</italic> is like &#x201C;Duo,&#x201D; or two, for the blessed God gives both of them the state of spiritual elevation. <span dir="rtl">&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05E1;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>&#x2014;or <italic>nissim</italic> means miracles. This happens through a miracle. These four levels mention are all hinted at in the words of the priestly blessing.</p>
<p>The Birchat <italic>Cohanim</italic>, the priestly blessing, contains eleven words, not counting the words that are repeated. These correspond to the eleven spices in the incense offering. &#x201C;Unto you,&#x201D; and &#x201C;to you,&#x201D; are two different words. &#x201C;May God raise His countenance unto you&#x201D; means elevation. &#x201C;And give to you peace,&#x201D; means the most elevation. Even if you have many opponents, do not fear them, for God is with you. This is the meaning of, &#x201C;to you,&#x201D; for you personally.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And they brought their offerings before God; six covered wagons and twelve oxen, one wagon for every two princes, and a bull for each one, and they offered them before the Mishkan.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 7:3)</p>
<p>Truly, they had great mercy on the Levites who had to carry the heavy loads of the Mishkan (without the aid of wagons&#x2014;see verse 9). But what could they do? The Divine command did not tell them that they had to carry without wagons. They feared that the Levites would have to toil with their bodies in order to refine their hearts, for sometimes one cannot refine his heart until he serves the blessed God with his body. So perhaps this mercy was not coming from God, but rather from the quality of their hearts, and in a place where God does not desire this; it is called &#x201C;the mercy of cruel evil ones.&#x201D; Therefore it was proper that each two Levites would bring one wagon, and the blessed God would thus agree with their action. This is as it is written (Mishlei, 11:9), &#x201C;<italic>Tsaddikim</italic> will be saved through knowledge.&#x201D; This is when two Torah scholars (&#x201C;one wagon for every two princes&#x201D;) agree on the same opinion. &#x201C;A bull for each one.&#x201D; This is as it is said (Rosh Hashanah, 4b trans. Jastrow), &#x201C;if you take hold of a large thing, you may lose your hold. If of the smaller, you will hold it. I.e., where the interpretation is doubtful, select the smaller number.&#x201D; Each prince did not want to rely on the opinion of the other, but when he saw that the other prince agreed to his opinion, he knew that it was from God.</p>
<p>This is as we find with Yirmiya (32:8), when he had a vision, which told him to buy Chanamel&#x2019;s field, he was uncertain. Then, after Chanamel came to him and offered him to buy his field, he said, &#x201C;now I know that this matter is from God.&#x201D; This is as already has been explained on the verse, &#x201C;do not make yourselves molten gods,&#x201D; in <italic>Parshat Kedoshim.</italic> When Moshe Rabeynu saw this he was greatly astonished, thinking that the Divine command was revealed unto them without his knowledge. Then the blessed God said to him (verse 5), &#x201C;take it from them,&#x201D; in order to tell him that it was done only of their own minds, therefore, &#x201C;take from them,&#x201D; for they have intended according to the truth of My will. Thus it was My will that they should each volunteer one bull, and two wagons for each prince.</p>

<chapter>
<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> B<small>EHA&#x2019;ALOTCHA</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And God spoke to Moses saying: Speak to Aaron and say to him, when you prepare the lights, seven lights shall illuminate toward the front of the Menorah.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 8:1)</p>
<p>Why is it written &#x201C;seven lights&#x201D; and not six lights? For you could say there were actually six, three on each side of the central light, with the central light being in its own category. From this we may understand that even in a place where one&#x2019;s intention is for the sake of Heaven, he must again contemplate how to proceed, further reconsidering how it is in accordance with the will of the Blessed God. This is why it says &#x201C;seven lights,&#x201D; for the seventh flame stands for intention for the sake of Heaven, and this too must bend toward the <italic>Shechina</italic> (Divine presence).<sup><xref rid="fn241">13</xref></sup> That is to say, we must strive to understand the awesome depth of God&#x2019;s will, and in which direction it is leaning.</p>
<p>This matter is further explained at the end of the <italic>Parsha</italic> where a &#x201C;sin&#x201D; is ascribed to Moshe, Miriam, and Aharon, which hints at the verse (Kohollet, 10:1), &#x201C;more precious than wisdom or honor is a little foolishness.&#x201D; That is, Aharon and Miriam agreed to take the sin upon themselves in order to complete the will of God, for in this <italic>Parsha</italic> the levels of Moshe Rabeynu come into action, as in the verse, &#x201C;I speak with him mouth to mouth.&#x201D; Miriam and Aharon agreed that the sin should be ascribed to them in order that the levels of Moshe Rabeynu could come to light, be understood, and be recognized. This is also the explanation of (the line in the <italic>Amida</italic> for Shabbat), &#x201C;purify our hearts to serve you in truth.&#x201D; Since it says, &#x201C;to serve you,&#x201D; if it is not true it wouldn&#x2019;t be called the service of God.<sup><xref rid="fn242">14</xref></sup> Yet we find that in the service of God there is a depth far deeper than it is possible for the human consciousness to perceive when it comes to understanding the intention for the sake of Heaven. Sometimes we find a little foolishness more precious than wisdom or honor, thus it says, &#x201C;a <italic>little</italic> foolishness,&#x201D; for one must make a reduction (in his service of God) so as to not let anything come to action unless its lacks or defects have been removed.<sup><xref rid="fn243">15</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And thus Aharon did &#x2026;. &#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 8:3)</p>
<p>Rashi explains &#x201C;[adding &#x201C;thus&#x201D; or &#x201C;like this&#x201D; or even &#x201C;with sincerity&#x201D;] (<italic>Shebo Shina</italic>) is in order to tell the praise of Aharon who did not change (from God&#x2019;s word). &#x201C;<italic>Shebo Shina&#x201D;</italic> could also be understood as &#x201C;who did not learn,&#x201D; in the sense of something learned and repeated so much that it becomes habitual. Aharon is being praised in that he did not let the action deteriorate into habit. Rather, he would constantly do the mitzvah as something new, which one would do with joy and alacrity. This is the meaning of the Gemara (<italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic>, 16b), &#x201C;a man must purify himself at the festival, as it is said, &#x2018;do not touch a dead carcass.&#x2019;&#x201D; When the life has gone out of something, it becomes a &#x201C;carcass,&#x201D; and thus it is when one performs a mitzvah devoid of joy or vivacity, yet out of a sense of obligation or habit. Then it is as if it has no life. Thus, &#x201C;one must purify himself at the festival.&#x201D; (<italic>Regel</italic> (festival) shares a root with <italic>hergel</italic> (habitual), meaning we have to purify ourselves in what has become for us a habit.) Since God bestows life to Israel one must then accept the life with joy.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And thus Aharon did &#x2026;. &#x201D;</italic></p>
<p>(&#x201C;Thus&#x201D; is added) in order to tell the praise of Aharon who did not change (Rashi). The Liqutei Torah of the Ari&#x2019;zal states (<italic>Parshat B&#x2019;ha&#x2019;lotcha</italic>), that it says &#x201C;he did thus,&#x201D; since it seems as if he had changed. The commandment was &#x201C;seven lights shall illuminate,&#x201D; meaning that they would light <italic>by themselves</italic> and he would not be the one to complete their lighting. After it says, &#x201C;<italic>he lighted</italic> its candles,&#x201D; which means that he would do all the lighting. For this it says, &#x201C;thus did Aharon.&#x201D; The point is, being a <italic>Cohen</italic> meant constantly to refine and purify the actions of Israel before the Omnipresent. Even if the actions seemed to be improper Aharon haCohen would raise them in his sanctity and prayer until they became meritorious. This is actually after the action, yet before the action one was not to rely on the fixing of Aharon, yet rather to be as careful as possible.</p>
<p>This is the explanation of &#x201C;when you kindle [literally &#x201C;raise&#x201D;] the lights,&#x201D; since truly Aharon would fix and raise the actions of the children of Israel, bringing to them light. Yet nonetheless, &#x201C;over against the front of the Menorah <italic>they shall illuminate</italic>,&#x201D; warning them that before each action to see to it that they illuminate by themselves. This means doing things in a clean and pure way, and not relying on Aharon to raise them. This is &#x201C;and thus did Aharon,&#x201D; for before he would warn them not to rely on him to fix each one as much as possible, and for actions already done Aharon would fix everything. This is, &#x201C;he lit [raised] the lights,&#x201D; stated in the past tense (things already done), and this is as Rashi explains, &#x201C;it [says &#x201C;thus&#x201D;] to praise Aharon, that he did not change.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn244">16</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Thus do to them [the Levites] to purify them. Sprinkle upon them waters of purification, cause a razor to pass over their entire skin, launder their clothes, and they will be purified.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 8:7)</p>
<p>These three actions (of purification) correspond to what our Sages of blessed memory warned in the <italic>Pirkei Avot</italic> (3:41), &#x201C;Look on three things and you will never come to sin. Know from where you came, and to where you are going, and before whom you will give a reckoning in the future.&#x201D; &#x201C;From where you came&#x201D; corresponds to &#x201C;pass a razor,&#x201D; for hair teaches of anger (Zohar, <italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 151b). This relates to &#x201C;know from where you came,&#x201D; for when one understands his origins (a putrid drop) he will never be able to become angry at even the smallest part of creation, for he will see its value.<sup><xref rid="fn245">17</xref></sup> &#x201C;Sprinkle upon them waters of purification&#x201D; corresponds to &#x201C;to where you are going [to dust]&#x201D; for one will have a settled mind in everything he does if the action has the power to last, and eternal life, even after the body passed away. This relates to the waters of purification (that had been mixed with the ashes of the red heifer) for it had already been burnt and become ash.<sup><xref rid="fn246">18</xref></sup> &#x201C;Launder their clothes&#x201D; signifies &#x201C;before whom you will give an account [the King of kings]&#x201D; that is, that one will constantly purify and refine his actions so they will be in a state of deep purity, as it is said (Kohollet, 9:8), let your clothes always be white.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn247">19</xref></sup> &#x201C;And they shall be purified&#x201D; teaches of the making of protective enclosures around our service of God. We are advised to sanctify ourselves even in that which is permitted to us, for the boundaries we make for ourselves are of far more benefit in protecting us from evil than the actual prohibition or warning.</p>
<p>As it says in the Gemara (<italic>Nedarim</italic>, 8a), &#x201C;From where do we derive that you may swear to perform a mitzvah, since it says, &#x2018;I have sworn and I will fulfill&#x2019;&#x201D; etc. This is what lasts for him even at a time of testing, as it says (<italic>Nedarim</italic>, 32b), &#x201C;at the time of the evil inclination no one mentions the inclination for good.&#x201D; At such a time one forgets all the substance of the prohibition in the action, as elsewhere explained on the verse, &#x201C;what profit in that we slay our brother&#x201D; (<italic>Mei HaShiloach Vayeshev).</italic> Yet the boundary one makes will last and stand for him even at the time of testing. A great and holy one<sup><xref rid="fn248">20</xref></sup> once told of such a situation he had encountered, when he came under a trial and forgot the essence of the prohibition. Yet before he had succumbed, he remembered that he had made himself a boundary not to do anything that the Blessed God would not derive pleasure from. He said to himself, &#x201C;even though there is no law against what I am doing, what pleasure will God receive from this?&#x201D; and when he put this to his heart he immediately remembered the material of the prohibition involved in the action.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And you shall pass a razor over all their flesh &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 8:7)</p>
<p>The <italic>Kedusha</italic> (sanctity) of the Levites is represented by the removal of their hair, where with the Nazir, it is written that he is to let his hair grow. (If he broke his vow by coming into contact with the dead or drinking wine, he is required to shave all his hair and bring a sacrifice.) Hair teaches of anger, as it is explained in the holy Zohar (<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 151b), and the Levites were cleaned and purified from desire, so therefore it was necessary to remove their hair. The Nazir means that his deficiency had entered into the attribute of desire, as is explained in the Gemara (<italic>Nedarim</italic>, 9b, where it says, &#x201C;Said Shimon haTsaddik, all my life [as a <italic>Cohen</italic>] I never ate from the sacrifice of a Nazir who had broken his vow except once. [Because he always was suspicious of the reasons for taking such a vow, whether out of anger or didacticism, and thus it was not done out of purity of heart, and easily broken. Steinsaltz.] Once I saw a Nazir come to the Temple [to offer a sacrifice for breaking his vow of Nazir] from the south, who was exceedingly beautiful, with magnificent curls about his head. I said to him, &#x2018;my son, what have you done to come and destroy such beautiful hair?&#x2019; He said, &#x2018;I was a shepherd for my father in my town, and I went to draw water from the well. I looked at my image reflected in the water, and my inclination to evil overcame me, trying to drive me from the world.<sup><xref rid="fn249">21</xref></sup> I said to my own nature, &#x201C;Evil One&#x0021; Why do you boast over a body that is soon food for worms in the grave&#x0021; I swear on the service in the Temple that I will shave you for the sake of Heaven.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Reb Shimon haTsaddik kissed him on the head and said, &#x2018;My son, such as you shall men and women become Nazirim in Israel, as it is written (<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 6:2), &#x2018;a man or woman who separates to take a vow of Nazir unto God.&#x2019; &#x201D; One who wants to overcome his desire is advised to enter himself into anger, as it is written in the Gemara (<italic>Kedushin</italic>, 40a), &#x201C;he shall wear black,&#x201D; meaning a black melancholy, which also refers to anger. This is why the Nazir is required to grow his hair.<sup><xref rid="fn250">22</xref></sup> This is explained in the <italic>Mei HaShiloach</italic> in <italic>Parshat Noach</italic> on the verse, &#x201C;and he sent out the raven.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And it was, when the Ark would journey, Moshe would say, Arise, Hashem &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 10:35)</p>
<p>A journey is when a man goes out on the road, and not knowing what will transpire for him. Then he must become impassioned and cry out to God. This is why before each journey of Israel in the desert they would sound blasts of the <italic>shofar</italic> (<italic>teruah</italic>). <italic>Teruah</italic> teaches of the voice of thunder (an impassioned cry). So too on festivals they would sound the <italic>shofar</italic>, for when there is a marked change in time one must also cry out to God to guard him from any evil that may come upon him. So now that they were about to journey into the land of Israel, and the Ark was traveling toward the land, this event is preceded by the verse, &#x201C;And Moshe said, Arise, Hashem.&#x201D; This means that they begin to pray that they would journey in peace, safe from any mishap on the way.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And when the people complained it was evil in the ears of Hashem &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, ll:l)<sup><xref rid="fn251">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;Proselytes are as difficult for Israel as a sore on the skin&#x201D; (<italic>Nidda</italic>, 13b). It says in Yesahya 14:1, &#x201C;and the strangers shall be joined to them, and they shall cleave [<italic>nispechu</italic>, which also means causing a sore on the skin] to the house of Jacob.&#x201D; Rashi comments, &#x201C;Because they will not be expert in the <italic>mitzvot</italic>, and will bring misfortune, and further, Israel may learn from them bad behavior.&#x201D; Rashi ends by saying, &#x201C;all Israel are responsible for one another, but not responsible for the proselytes.&#x201D; Another interpretation is that proselytes often become so expert in the performance of <italic>mitzvot</italic> that they make other Jews look less than sufficient in their service of God.) For Israel is called a coal, and the nations are called a flame, meaning that the hearts of Israel are filled with <italic>simcha</italic> [true joy], and the nations, though they appear joyful, their hearts are filled with sadness. So when Moshe said to Yitro (a proselyte) (<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 10:32), &#x201C;And it shall be, if you go with us, then the good which Hashem does to us, we will do to you.&#x201D; At the moment these words of Torah entered Yitro&#x2019;s heart, the sadness left his heart. This was difficult for Israel. Therefore the verse following this says, &#x201C;and when the people complained,&#x201D; as when clear water is stirred up and becomes muddy, and then returns to its initial clear state.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;From where do I have meat to give to all these people?&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 11:13)</p>
<p>Meaning, Moshe was on the level of Manna, as it is written (<italic>Shemot</italic>, 16:4), &#x201C;God said to Moses, Behold, I will rain on you bread from Heaven.&#x201D; &#x201C;From Heaven&#x201D; meaning, with utmost clarity. From Moshe&#x2019;s point of view, this bread existed in the clearest state from all the goodness bestowed in this world. Meat means &#x201C;better than bread,&#x201D; for meat is expansion. Thus, when it was said (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 12:20), &#x201C;when God shall <italic>expand your borders</italic>, when He spoke to you and <italic>said, you may eat meat,&#x201D;</italic> from Moshe&#x2019;s perspective it was not from this world at all, only from the life of the world to come. Therefore he said (<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 11:21), &#x201C;the people, among whom I am,&#x201D; meaning, from where I am standing how could I give them meat?<sup><xref rid="fn252">24</xref></sup> However, when the reign was passed to Yehoshua they were given meat, for on Yehoshua&#x2019;s level meat was like freedom from enslavement to the kingdom. Therefore Eldad and Meidad prophesized, &#x201C;Moshe will die, Yehoshua will bring us in.&#x201D; So here too the meat was like expansion in a taste of the world to come. Even when they saw that their friends were dying they did not prevent themselves from eating meat, because one moment of a clear spirit in the world to come is worth more than all the life of this world.<sup><xref rid="fn253">25</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Moshe said to him [Yehoshua], are you jealous for my sake? Would that all of God&#x2019;s people were prophets, that God would put His spirit upon them.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 11:29)</p>
<p>&#x201C;For my sake&#x201D; means something that is from me. The very prophecy of Eldad and Meidad was from Moshe Rabeynu, as it is written (<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 11:25), &#x201C;and He took of the spirit that was on him (Moshe) and placed it upon seventy elders.&#x201D; The verse &#x201C; would it were that God made all his people prophets, and put His spirit upon them&#x201D; means that just as God shall put His spirit upon them, and it will not be from me, so too I should not be jealous of them.<sup><xref rid="fn254">26</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Miriam and Aharon spoke against Moshe &#x2026; for your prophecies of God come in visions &#x2026; not so with My servant Moshe, I will speak to him mouth to mouth, not in riddles, the similitude of God does he see &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 12:1&#x2013;8)</p>
<p>It is written in the Gemara (<italic>Sanhedrin</italic>, 104b), &#x201C;Who decides who has a portion in the world to come or not? [Isn&#x2019;t this matter only in the hands of God?] Rav Ashi said, &#x2018;the members of the great assembly decide [for among them were prophets of God].&#x2019; Rav Yehuda said in the name of Rav, they wanted to count Shlomo haMelech among those who did not have a share in the world to come, so a vision of his father (David haMelech) and bowed down before them (pleading that they not do so). They paid no attention. Then fire came from Heaven and burned under their benches, but they paid no attention. Then a voice called to them from Heaven, saying (Mishlei, 22:29), &#x2018;Do you see a man diligent in his business? He shall stand before kings, he shall not stand before men.&#x2019; Meaning, Shlomo built My house [the Temple] before he built his own. Also, he built My house in seven years, and his house he built in thirteen. [He built Mine with even greater alacrity, so one who &#x2018;stands before kings&#x2019; should not be considered wicked.] But they paid no attention to this. Then a heavenly voice called out and said [Job, 34:33], &#x2018;shall he recompense it according to your mind, when you refused his judgment? Shall he say, You shall choose, and not I, and speak what you know.&#x2019;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn255">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Truly, all the laws were delivered to the members of the great assembly exactly as they transmitted them. Therefore it was according to the <italic>halacha</italic> that they wanted to count Shlomo haMelech among those who did not have a share in the world to come, until the final voice from Heaven announced, &#x201C;shall he recompense it according to your mind?&#x201D; In this way, the light of Shlomo haMelech explicitly opened up for them, and then the light of Shlomo haMelech became increasingly clear in their understanding. After that they said nothing. In this vein the blessed God said, &#x201C;it is not so with My servant Moshe.&#x201D; Immediately after the word came forth from the blessed God in this verse, they then saw explicitly the light and level of understanding of Moshe Rabeynu eye to eye. Then when the blessed God said the word &#x201C;unto him&#x201D; [verse 6], it was hidden from them, and then they understood the level of Moshe Rabeynu.</p>
<p>Similarly, when the blessed God said the word, &#x201C;a vision of God&#x201D; (verse 8), then the light and understanding of Moshe Rabeynu entered their hearts, and when He said the word &#x201C;he shall behold,&#x201D; it was closed from them. Also later, some of this understanding remained in their hearts so at times they would understand with the very understanding of Moshe Rabeynu. Still, they knew that it was not coming from them, but only from the level of Moshe Rabeynu, and they knew what they lacked in comparison to Moshe Rabeynu. For before they thought that there was no level higher than their own level, and afterward they knew that there was a higher level. Yet at the time of the sin they did not understand that this light was not a part of their portion, believing that this understanding was for them, and not from the side of the blessed God who wanted to show them the level of Moshe Rabeynu.</p>
<p>Therefore they tasted a greater light than was in their own ability to taste when they knew that it was not a part of their portion. For then, they could only taste that which came to them through the contemplation of their fellow man&#x2019;s portion, but not as he himself would have appreciated it. So when they were in the realm of sin, asserting that it was in fact their own portion, then they tasted the taste of a man appreciating what is his own. This happened because the Holy One, blessed be He, wanted to show them the level and value of Moshe Rabeynu in its full capacity.</p>
<p>This is as it says in the Gemara (<italic>Berachot</italic>, 35a), &#x201C;all who enjoy from this world without pronouncing a blessing on the enjoyment are acting deceitfully.&#x201D; For the act of enjoyment with a blessing is to say he recognizes that it is not his own, but only God&#x2019;s. Therefore one will not arrive at enjoyment from the <italic>Kedusha</italic> (sanctity) of anything unless he does so as one who sees (that it is not his, and his enjoyment will be limited). Then when it happens that a man benefits without a blessing, then it is as if he is enjoying the Holy Sacrifices of Heaven in completeness, and it is as if he has acted deceitfully. Investigate and contemplate this matter further, for it is intensely deep.</p>

<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And God spoke to Moses saying, send people .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 13:1-2)</p>
<p>It is said in the holy Zohar (<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 159a), &#x201C;The Holy One, blessed be He, has three worlds&#x2014;the world that is hidden within Him and is not known at all, the world that is always known, and the world that is known and not known.&#x201D; There is one whose prayer will not benefit him at all, and this is called the world that is not known at all. That is, for this one, God withdraws His glory above. The world that is always known corresponds to one whom God always helps, aiding even without prayer, and so he will have no use for prayer. The world that is known and not known corresponds to one who receives no Divine assistance without prayer, yet if he prays he is answered. This one will have the will in his heart to pray; yet the first two will not have any desire to pray. Both the one who it doesn&#x2019;t help anyway, and the one who is helped without prayer, will not find any will in their hearts to pray.</p>
<p>So it is, when a man finds that he has no desire for prayer, he needs to understand why. Is it because it will not help him, or because he doesn&#x2019;t need it? It was similar with the spies, for no prayer would have benefited the spies. Therefore they had no will in their hearts to pray. The exception was Calev, who had a need for prayer (the world that is known and not known), and that is why he alone went to Hevron to throw himself down on the graves of the patriarchs in prayer. Yehoshua did not need to pray because wherever he went he was helped by God, as it says in the holy Zohar (<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 158b), &#x201C;Moses blessed him with supernal assistance,&#x201D; therefore he didn&#x2019;t need to pray.<sup><xref rid="fn256">28</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and Moshe called Hoshea bin Nun Yehoshua.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 13:16)</p>
<p>The letter <italic>yud</italic> hints at innocence, straightforwardness, simplicity, for its form is a small dot. This is why Moshe added the <italic>yud</italic> to his name, as it says in the Gemara (<italic>Kiddushin</italic>, 58b), &#x201C;If one says to his friend, go [be my intermediary] and betroth this woman for me, and the friend goes and betroths her for himself, she is betrothed to the friend.&#x201D; The Gemara adds to this that he had acted with him in deceit. Thus it seemed also with Yehoshua for Moshe had asked him to investigate the land (so Moshe could enter it, i.e., become &#x201C;betrothed&#x201D; to it), and in the end he scouted it out just for himself. Therefore it seems that his excursion was not done in innocence, so the <italic>yud</italic> was added to his name signifying that he should be straightforward in all his actions. This is further seen in the Aramaic translation of Yonatan ben Uziel, &#x201C;when Moshe saw the <italic>humility</italic> of Hoshea, he called Hoshea bin Nun Yehoshua.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And they told him and they said we went to the land &#x2026; [we can do] nothing, for the people are strong .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 13:27&#x2013;28)</p>
<p>They derided the land with ten statements of derision, for there were ten spies and each one said one. The name of each spy teaches of the statement he said to deride the land, and the one who understands will understand.<sup><xref rid="fn257">29</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And the children of Israel were in the desert, and they found a man gathering wood on the day of the Sabbath .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 15:32)</p>
<p>It is written in the Mishna (Menachot, Ch. 5), &#x201C;there are offerings that need oil and frankincense, or oil without frankincense, or frankincense without oil.&#x201D; Oil teaches of (an action) &#x201C;bringing honor from the community [<italic>Pirkei Avot</italic>, Ch. 2.1],&#x201D; in other words, that a man should strive to be righteous and pure (hence oil) to the depths of his heart, and should have intentions for the sake of Heaven. Frankincense teaches of &#x201C;bringing honor to he who does it,&#x201D; that is, that the action should serve to adorn the one who does it in the eyes of his surroundings. All actions should (ideally) bring honor to one&#x2019;s self and honor to one&#x2019;s surroundings. Yet sometimes we find it is &#x201C;a time to do for God.&#x201D; At this time one doesn&#x2019;t have to make sure that the action brings himself honor, just that it is done for the sake of Heaven.</p>
<p>This is as it is written (Tehillim, 119:126), &#x201C;it is time to act for God, for they have made void Your Torah.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn258">30</xref></sup> Sometimes this is the will of the blessed God. At other times the opposite is true, that even if the intentions are the purest goals, it is still forbidden to act against the Torah. Thus it is with the one who was gathering wood on Shabbat (Tslofchad). Even though his intentions were for the sake of Heaven, he was nonetheless punished for it, for it was not the will of the blessed God that a man should enter himself into such a situation.<sup><xref rid="fn259">31</xref></sup> Yet when someone falls into a situation (beyond his control) that would bring honor to his surroundings, he does not need to consider whether it will bring honor to himself. Still, it is improper to enter premeditatedly into such a situation. Rather, before acting he needs to see that the action will (Mishlei, 3:4), &#x201C;bring favor and good understanding in the eyes of God and man.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and they shall make for themselves</italic> tsitsit <italic>.&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 15:38)</p>
<p>Why is the section of <italic>tsitsit</italic> (ritual fringes) juxtaposed with the section of the one found gathering wood on Shabbat? <italic>Tsitstit</italic> teaches of the fear of God, as it is said, &#x201C;and you shall see them and you shall remember all the commandments of God (which would inspire fear).&#x201D; Shabbat teaches of great strengths,<sup><xref rid="fn260">32</xref></sup> for it hints at &#x201C;the day which is all Shabbat [the messianic era],&#x201D; when all fear will be removed. As it says in the Midrash (Torat <italic>Cohanim Behukotai</italic>, 3:3), &#x201C;I will walk with them in the garden of Eden and the commandments will be nullified in future [messianic] times&#x201D; (<italic>Nidda</italic>, 61b). It was the understanding of the wood gatherer that on Shabbat there is no need to use the attribute of fear. Yet now, before the final separation (before the messianic era) it is necessary to use the fear of God, and in particular on the level of action.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and they shall make for themselves</italic> tsitsit <italic>.&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 15:38)</p>
<p><italic>Tsitsit</italic> are also called <italic>gdelim</italic>, or tassels. <italic>Tsitsit</italic> teaches of the fear of God, that one should not find it clever in his eyes to transgress the words of Torah even to a hairsbreadth, and to be careful to appear clean to others. <italic>G&#x2019;dil</italic> or tassel teaches of strengths (<italic>g&#x2019;dil</italic> is similar to <italic>gedol</italic>, meaning great), that one should not become weak before those accusing him with hate, and remain strong in his resolve against them.</p>
<p>In this week&#x2019;s Torah portion we find six subsections, corresponding to the six sayings in Tehillim 19. &#x201C;The Torah of God is perfect, restoring the soul&#x201D; corresponds to the section about the wine offerings (see <italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 15:7). After the event of the spies the commandment of the wine offering was given to Israel to revive them and restore their soul. The section of wine offerings hints at joy, as Rabbi Tanchuma said (Midrash Tanchuma Shlach, 14, referring to the juxtaposition of the discussion of taking challah from bread and the wine offering), &#x201C;go eat your bread in joy&#x201D; (Kohollet, 9:7). That is to say, the offerings would bring God joy. These commandments were given to them after they believed that they had sinned clear to the depth of their lives. This is the intention of the Midrash (<italic>Bamidbar</italic> Rabba, Shlach, 16:4), &#x201C;the spies were Gentiles&#x201D; (figuratively), for the root of the Gentile is anger, and this characteristic has no place in Israel.</p>
<p>For this it is said, &#x201C;the Torah of God is perfect, restoring the soul,&#x201D; for in truth they intended to do the will of the blessed God, according to the saying of God (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 15:16),&#x201D; and the fourth generation will come here again.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn261">33</xref></sup> Truly it was in their power to praise the land, yet they had received an understanding in their hearts from the blessed God to deride it. Thus they were intending to do God&#x2019;s will, and He gave them the section of the wine offerings. This is called (Shir haShirim, 5:1), &#x201C;I have drunk my wine,&#x201D; in other words, they gave God joy in that they let themselves be conquered by God, and this can only be done by Israel. For the other nations could not bring a wine offering without an animal offering; only Israel could do this, as it is said in <italic>Menachot</italic> (73b), since the Gentile cannot agree to be vanquished by God, as is explained.</p>
<p>The next saying in Tehillim 19 is &#x201C;the testimony of God is faithful, making the simple wise.&#x201D; A testimony is something clear, and this corresponds to Yehoshua, for as long as the reasons behind the <italic>mitzvot</italic> are not clear one may be easily tempted into anything that confronts him. Yet when the meaning of the <italic>mitzvot</italic> are clear he may no longer be tempted. Yet we find Yehoshua&#x2019;s attribute was honesty, naivete, so therefore God placed him in Moshe&#x2019;s tent, for from the influence of Moshe Rabeynu, peace upon him, he let himself be tempted only from the good, this is why his name is Yehoshua [meaning God will save (protect) you].</p>
<p>Tehillim 19 continues, &#x201C;the statutes of God are straightforward, gladdening the heart.&#x201D; &#x201C;The statutes or charges of God&#x201D;&#x2014;in other words harsh decrees or Divine warnings, though they seem difficult, severe, at their depth they are filled with mercy and love. This corresponds to the passage about the one who was found gathering wood on Shabbat. Even though the warnings about Shabbat are formulated in severity, as in &#x201C;he who desecrates it will surely die &#x2026;&#x201D;, this is because Shabbat contains the deepest good and He feared we might not receive it in its completeness. Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, warned not to miss the good, yet rather accept it in its completeness, as a father who strongly reprimands his son out of his love.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The commandments of God are clear, illuminating the eyes&#x201D; corresponds to the passage of <italic>tsitsit</italic>, for <italic>tsitsit</italic> teaches of the fear of God, and by means of a man&#x2019;s fear God will illuminate his eyes. As it says (<italic>Menachot</italic>, 43b), &#x201C;all who are careful regarding the commandment of <italic>tsitsit</italic> will merit to receive the countenance of the <italic>Shechina</italic> [Divine Presence].&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;The fear of God is pure, standing forever&#x201D; corresponds to the commandment of taking <italic>challa</italic>, that is that one should not refirain from crowning God King over him even for a second. Even though God was made King through the separation of tithes from the produce, yet nonetheless when he wants to benefit from and eat the produce it must be in a state of the fear of God and thereby establishing His sovereignty through the separation of <italic>challa</italic> from the dough.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The judgments of God are true, altogether righteous&#x201D; corresponds to the section (15:22), &#x201C;and if you have erred.&#x201D; This hints at the complete absence of contradictions in God&#x2019;s commandments. This is as it is written the Gemara (<italic>Horaiot</italic>, 13a), &#x201C;even though it says here [15:24] &#x2018;a bullock for an ascent offering,&#x2019; whereas in <italic>Parshat Vayikra</italic> it says, &#x2018;a bullock for a sin offering,&#x2019;&#x201D; the Gemara resolves the seeming contradiction. Here it refers to erring in idolatry, and here it refers to erring in all other commandments. Then there is no contradiction.</p>

<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Korach took .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 16:1)</p>
<p>It is said in the Midrash (<italic>Bamidbar</italic> Rabba, <italic>Korach</italic>, 18:17), &#x201C;he saw the great chain of generations that would come out of him.&#x201D; Since he saw this he became arrogant, daring to believe that he was surely the greatest of God&#x2019;s servants. Of this it is said (Mishlei, 27:1), &#x201C;Do not boast of tomorrow, for you don&#x2019;t know what the day may bring forth.&#x201D; Even if a man understands that he surely has hope (promise of future rewards or success), he is to beware of putting his trust in this for he does not know how the blessed God may conduct Himself in any present moment.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Korach took .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic></p>
<p>It is said in the Midrash (<italic>Bamidbar</italic> Rabba, <italic>Korach</italic>, 18:2), &#x201C;Why does the passage about Korach follow immediately after the section on <italic>tsitsit</italic>? Because Korach took a <italic>talit</italic> made entirely of <italic>tchelet</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn262">34</xref></sup> came before Moshe, and asked, &#x2018;does this <italic>talit</italic> require <italic>tsitsit</italic> or not?&#x2019;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn263">35</xref></sup>&#160;<italic>Tchelet</italic> teaches of the fear of God, and Korach asserted that the fear of God was something completely revealed to him at all times. He understood that all comes from God, &#x201C;even&#x201D; the fear of God.<sup><xref rid="fn264">36</xref></sup> If so, how could anyone ever do anything against the will of God? Since all will and all action come from Him, may He be blessed, how could anyone do something not according to His will? For this reason Korach asserted that a <italic>talit</italic> made entirely of <italic>tchelet</italic> (i.e., constantly conscious of the fear of God) would be exempt from <italic>tsitsit</italic>, because <italic>tsitsit</italic> teaches of the fear of God. Yet in truth, the will of the blessed God as it exists in this world depends on how each one sees it. This relates to what is said in the Gemara (<italic>Chagiga</italic>, 13b), &#x201C;The prophet Yechezkel prayed on the face of the ox [on the chariot], and it turned into a cherub.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn265">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;Ox&#x201D; teaches of wisdom that is greatly refined, and at the deepest level everything really does come from God, our free choice being no more consequential as a peel of garlic, only according to one&#x2019;s particular state of mind. God hid His way from mankind because He desires that we serve Him, and if everything (in God&#x2019;s consciousness) were clear to us, we would not experience the desire to serve Him. Because of this Yechezkel prayed and changed the face to a cherub, that God&#x2019;s way would be hidden, and it would appear to mankind that we are able to make choices. In this way the desire to serve Him would come to our hearts. This is the meaning of (ibid.) &#x201C;the cherub is a small face.&#x201D; <sup><xref rid="fn266">38</xref>, <xref rid="fn267">39</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and why do you raise yourselves above the community of God?&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 16:3)</p>
<p>Here Korach&#x2019;s assertion was that there is no favoritism in Israel, that God doesn&#x2019;t elevate one above the other, for God dwells among them all equally. This is similar to what is said in the Midrash (Gemara <italic>Ta&#x2019;anit</italic>, 31a), &#x201C;In the future God will make a circle dance of the righteous, and all will point to God saying, &#x2018;this is our God whom we have hoped for.&#x2019;&#x201D; A circle dance, for all points in a circle are equidistant from the center, no one closer than another. Korach asserted that now it is also like this, yet concerning this King Shlomo said (Mishlei, 20:26), &#x201C;a wise king scatters the wicked, returning the wheel over them.&#x201D; This means, concerning the &#x201C;crown&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn268">40</xref></sup> that the blessed God gave them, that is, the crown of the Levi&#x2019;im that gave the sons of Levi a favored, elevated status, concerning this, &#x201C;he returns the wheel over them.&#x201D; That means, He answers them (return, <italic>meishiv</italic> in Hebrew, also means answers), &#x201C;when I gave you an elevated status as Levi&#x2019;im you didn&#x2019;t refuse it and claim that there is no one in Israel who receives special status above another.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Korach took .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic></p>
<p>This relates to &#x201C;why did your heart take you away &#x2026;&#x201D; (Job, 15:12). That is, that his heart took him. Concerning this Moshe our teacher cried out in prayer (Tehillim, 90:1), &#x201C;God, you have been our dwelling place in every generation. Before the birth of the mountains, and the formation of the earth &#x2026;&#x201D; Mountains signify powers and desires. On this he prayed to God, for He is the one who gives power and the desire to act, thus if one cannot overcome his desire he is not culpable, for all his power comes from the blessed God. Concerning this he said, &#x201C;teach us to number our days,&#x201D; which is now interpreted (<italic>yameynu</italic> is days, <italic>yamIno</italic> is power) as asking God to give us the power to overcome our desires, and not to receive desires greater than the power to control it. Rather, our desires should be on the level of our restraining power. &#x201C;When will you Return, God, and console your servant?&#x201D; In other words, that God should place in Korach&#x2019;s heart understanding, which he can use to overpower his desire (for honor, control, rulership).</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;For all the congregation is holy and God is among them .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 16:3)</p>
<p>This relates to the verse (Mishlei, 12:19), &#x201C;a lip of truth shall be established forever, but a lying tongue is for but a moment.&#x201D; Those who spoke truth will endure forever, and the lies of their mouth will be immediately nullified. From this verse they (the sons of Korach) will be rectified in the future. Because King David established the relation of the sons of Korach to their father (in Tehillim 44&#x2013;49), they were returned to his community. If they would not derive any good from this (being called in their father&#x2019;s name), then they would not have been specifically related to this evil (the controversy surrounding their father), God forbid. As it is said in the Gemara (<italic>Shabbat</italic> 55b on another matter), &#x201C;could it be that he sinned and still the writings relate his progeny?&#x201D; This is one of the thirteen principles in which the Torah is expounded, &#x201C;everything that was in the general principle, but was taken out &#x2026; you may not return it to its general principle until the verse does it explicitly.&#x201D; Here King David returned them to his community (<italic>klal</italic>, also general principle) explicitly. This is seen specifically in the enactment of the Ari&#x201D;zal to say the chapter of Tehillim is &#x201C;a song of the sons of Korach&#x201D; before blowing the <italic>shofar</italic> on Rosh Hashanah, a custom that has been accepted by all the communities of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn269">41</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Why do you raise yourselves above the congregation of God?&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 16:3)</p>
<p>It is written (Yesahya, 51:15), &#x201C;And I will place my word in your mouth, and I will cover you in the shadow of My hand.&#x201D; There exists a good and precious point in every soul of Israel, which the blessed God allotted it in particular. However, in this world, that point is dressed in a garment that makes it appear to be the opposite of its true nature, and this is called &#x201C;covered in the shadow of My hand.&#x201D; It is also thus with precious souls, for the blessed God made garments, which cause them to look like the opposite of their preciousness. It is like this with Moshe Rabeynu, of whom the Torah testifies that he was &#x201C;the most humble of all men,&#x201D; and this was covered with a garment that made the opposite seem true. Therefore they claimed that he wanted to raise himself above the rest.</p>
<p>This is also the case with David haMelech, whose essential attribute was the betterment of all of Israel, as is written in the Midrash Sochar Tov (Tehillim 1), &#x201C;the one who shall request Will is David haMelech, who loved Israel.&#x201D; Of him it was written (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 17:15), &#x201C;From among your brethren appoint a king over yourselves,&#x201D; (&#x201C;from among your brethren&#x201D;) meaning one who has love for the entire community of Israel. On the surface it seemed that David was the opposite, as it is written (Gemara, <italic>Bereshit</italic> Rabba, 63:11), &#x201C;at the time Shmuel haNavi saw the red-haired David he feared that he might be one who would shed blood, so God answered him, &#x2018;see how he is with beautiful eyes.&#x2019;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn270">42</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Moshe said to Korach, you and all your congregation were [</italic>hayu<italic>] before Hashem .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 16:15)</p>
<p>&#x201C;<italic>Hayu</italic>.&#x201D; With these words were they cast down into hell. These three letters (of &#x201C;were,&#x201D; <italic>hayu, Hei Yud Vav</italic>) form a holy name that signifies the &#x201C;seal of that which is below,&#x201D; as is written in the <italic>Sefer Yetsira</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn271">43</xref></sup> the &#x201C;Book of Creation,&#x201D; &#x201C;the direction below is sealed with Hei Yud Vav.&#x201D; When Moshe saw that their Divine decree had been sealed (to cast them below), he chose these words, &#x201C;were (<italic>hayu</italic>) before God.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; you have killed the people of God.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 17:6)</p>
<p>Truly, the people knew that this act had come from God, yet their claim was that Moshe and Aharon hated the people because of the affliction (or perhaps, the plague) that the people were tainted with. Thus the blessed God had to lift His face upon them. This is why Moshe Rabeynu said to Aharon, &#x201C;take the incense censer [to stop the plague],&#x201D; to show the people God&#x2019;s great love for them.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;The dead in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides those that died in the matter of Korach.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 17:14)</p>
<p>Here we find that whenever <italic>Kedusha</italic> (sanctity) descends into the world, it does not come &#x201C;for free,&#x201D; but comes at the great cost of lives of Israel. For instance, before David haMelech merited knowing the place of the Mikdash (Holy Temple in Jerusalem), many lives were lost and many tragedies suffered. Thus it was before the world merited the clarifications involved in recognizing the soul of Aharon haCohen, for this was not made entirely clear until after the controversy of the staves, as is known (see <italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 17:16&#x2013;26). This was also acquired at a great price, namely 15,000 lives, for 14,700 died in the plague, 250 were swallowed by the earth in the controversy of Korach, along with fifty people close to Datan, Aviram, and Korach. This 15,000 is hinted at in the verses in <italic>Bereshit</italic> concerning the creation of light. From the verse, &#x201C;and God said, let there be light&#x201D; (verse 3) until the completion of light (the end of verse 5), we find the letter <italic>aleph</italic> fifteen times.<sup><xref rid="fn272">44</xref></sup> This hints that before the light of Aharon haCohen was made completely clear in this world, fifteen thousand lives of Israel had to be lost. Then afterward, the light of Aharon haCohen emerged clear and refined.<sup><xref rid="fn273">45</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And God said to Moshe &#x2026; take from them a staff, a staff from each father&#x2019;s house .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 17:16)</p>
<p>Why did God command them to take staves after the Korach affair? The staff (or branch) hints at life as is known, as it is written (Zechariah, 8:4), &#x201C;every man with his staff in his hand from many days&#x201D; (long life). God commanded them to take staves for in the future God will show each one that he will arrive to his place and true portion with eternal life, and will not desire the portion of his neighbor. For before it will be clear to each one what his portion is, he will long for the portion of his friend. It was like this in the controversy of Korach, as he longed for the portion of Aharon haCohen. This is the meaning of the staves, that God showed each and every one his place, that everyone has a good place, and that no one would complain about (be jealous of) the portion of Aharon. This is seen in the Aramaic translation of Onkles, &#x201C;and they saw, and each man took his staff.&#x201D; &#x201C;Saw&#x201D; is translated as &#x201C;and he made it known.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn274">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>That is, that they understood and established in the clarity of the situation, recognizing the depth of the root and source of each one. Even though it only says that Aharon&#x2019;s staff blossomed, really all the staves blossomed, yet Aharon&#x2019;s staff went on to give fruit. For the portion of Aharon is the completeness of every action in this world, and he would not have done an action that would after have to go through another process of purification. Not so with the other tribes, whose actions achieve this purification only after time. This is so even though there are other tribes whose preciousness is greater than that of <italic>Kehuna</italic>, priesthood, like the tribe of Yehuda (from which grows King David&#x2019;s line). Nonetheless, their completion takes time, and this was once against the opinion of Aharon, who at first considered himself the greatest, and this troubled him greatly.</p>
<p>Therefore God had Israel give him the twenty-four gifts of <italic>Kehuna</italic>, to show him that all the actions of Israel have to be in this world according to the level of Aharon haCohen, for in this world the blessed God chooses the action in its completeness. On this it is written in the <italic>Sefer Yetsira</italic>, &#x201C;the Book of Creation,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn275">47</xref></sup> that there are twelve permutations of the four letters of God&#x2019;s name (each tribe associated with one permutation). The permutation for Aharon is in its natural and complete order, <italic>Yud Hei Vav Hei</italic>, for this is the name that rules in this world.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And the Levites shall perform the service .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 18:23)</p>
<p>It is written in the Holy Zohar (<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 178b), &#x201C;the Levite completes the left side by means of his service.&#x201D; This is because at a time when a man&#x2019;s heart is overcome with lust, and he overpowers it with all his strength and prevents himself from it, then he succeeds in completing himself by filling the deficiency that he has carried from his birth. For everyone is born with a deficiency that he must fix. This is why the prophet Yeshayahu said (Yeshaya, 48:8), &#x201C;you are called a criminal from the womb.&#x201D; This is called the &#x201C;left side,&#x201D; which the blessed God leaves for man to fix.</p>

<chapter>
<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> C<small>HUKAT</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;This is the statute of the Torah.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 19:2)</p>
<p>(Concerning the ashes of the red heifer mixed in the purifying waters, used to purify one who has come into contact with a dead body.) It is written in the Midrash, &#x201C;Since the other peoples of the world challenge us, saying, &#x2018;what is this mitzvah and what is its meaning?&#x2019; Therefore God called it a <italic>Choq</italic> [a statute, an unexplainable, immutable law], &#x2018;a Divine decree before Me, and you do not have the permission to wonder at its meaning.&#x2019;&#x201D; Concerning this, King Shlomo praised the life of Israel versus the life of the other nations, as it is written (Shir Hashirim Rabba, 5:9), &#x201C;[the nations ask Israel,] what is your beloved from our beloved [how is your God any different from our gods?] &#x2026; my Beloved is pure and ruddy &#x2026;&#x201D; In other words, God deals with Israel in a different way from that in which He deals with the other nations. This means that no evil reaches the depth of the life of Israel. (In three ways.) First, loss or death doesn&#x2019;t really befall them, for death in Israel is not like death in the nations&#x2014;with the nations death is like a vessel that is broken and cannot be fixed. With Israel death is like a vessel made in sections that is merely taken apart.<sup><xref rid="fn276">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>Second, Israel has never been under the &#x201C;yoke&#x201D; of a king or ruler at any time, because we understand that all is really in the hands of the blessed God. Third, in their wisdom (King Shlomo) praises Israel versus the nations, for no nation has an understanding of God as Israel does. Concerning these three things the nations are challenging us, for in them it seems on the surface that there is, God forbid, no difference between us. This is why it says (<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 19:2), &#x201C;they shall take unto you&#x201D; (Rashi notes that &#x201C;you&#x201D; means to Moshe), that is, take unto the level of Moshe our teacher that exists in all of Israel. This is because Moshe Rabeynu is the source of wisdom for all of Israel, and to him alone (and the portion of him residing in all Israel) the meaning of the red heifer became clear.<sup><xref rid="fn277">49</xref></sup> Heifer, <italic>parah</italic>, in Hebrew, teaches of life that has gone through a process of purification.<sup><xref rid="fn278">50</xref></sup> &#x201C;Red&#x201D; teaches of strength.<sup><xref rid="fn279">51</xref></sup> &#x201C;Whole,&#x201D; in other words, whole in its redness, that no limb of the body should weaken and lose the power of this strength residing in it.<sup><xref rid="fn280">52</xref></sup> &#x201C;Having no imperfection,&#x201D; that is, that in Israel there shall be nothing lacking in its wisdom, only purified wisdom. &#x201C;Which never carried a yoke on its back,&#x201D; meaning that Israel has never been subjugated to any form of slavery, for the blessed God rules over us alone. As the prophet Zechariah said (10:6), &#x201C;and it will be as if I had never neglected them.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This reality becomes clear in the story of Joseph and his brothers, for it seemed as if they were in great trouble, but afterward it was made known to them that they were all the while before their own brother. Then it became clear that they were never in danger, and their trouble was only temporary (and even illusory). So it will be in the future, that the blessed God will make it clear that all suffering in Israel was temporary (an illusion of this world) and no soul in Israel was ever really in danger.<sup><xref rid="fn281">53</xref></sup> This is what King Shlomo said (Kohellet, 7:23), &#x201C;I said I will be wise, and it is far from me.&#x201D; Even though he understood all of this clearly, still, King Shlomo&#x2019;s wisdom was in a form that was to be clear to everyone. That is why he said &#x201C;I will be wise,&#x201D; meaning, I will make everyone else wise to understand this, and added, &#x201C;and it is far from me.&#x201D; (I.e., it is for others, not me.)</p>
<p>To Moshe it was said (Midrash Tanchuma, <italic>Chukat</italic>, 8), &#x201C;to you I will reveal,&#x201D; for the wisdom of Moshe Rabeynu was in order for him to understand but not to make another wise,<sup><xref rid="fn282">54</xref></sup> and the kind of wisdom that Shlomo haMelech possessed was understood, but not in his (own) wisdom&#x0021; For his wisdom was in order to cause others to understand, and this is why it says &#x201C;for it is far from me,&#x201D; meaning, &#x201C;it is beyond the limit of my own wisdom.&#x201D; The reason why the passage about the red heifer comes before the death of the &#x201C;three shepherds&#x201D; (Miriam, Aharon, Moshe) is in order to let Israel understand that they should not be distraught (for there is no death, as it is usually understood). The sprinkling of the waters of purification (made from the ashes of the red heifer) hints that in the future all will return to them.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;They shall take unto you a perfect red heifer .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 19:2)</p>
<p>In the future the blessed God will reveal His glory to Israel without any separation whatsoever, for now this (reality of) life exists in the depths of Israel, yet it is not revealed, only in &#x201C;garments.&#x201D; These garments are the Torah and <italic>mitzvot</italic>, for one may only enter into the depths of the will of God through the Torah and <italic>mitzvot</italic> (for more on this see the <italic>Tanya</italic>, Liqutei Amarim, Ch. 4). This is &#x201C;they shall take unto you a heifer,&#x201D; which stands for life, as is known, and at the present moment we are commanded that this life be clothed in garments, that is, the Torah and <italic>mitzvot</italic>. &#x201C;Perfect red&#x201D; means explicit strengths, without any separation or defect. &#x201C;With no blemish in it&#x201D; means that no foolishness would be found in any action.<sup><xref rid="fn283">55</xref></sup> &#x201C;Which never carried a yoke on its back&#x201D; teaches that Israel (at the depths) never experienced helpless agonizing and effort. This is as it is said in Zechariah (4), &#x201C;two olives&#x201D; standing solid.<sup><xref rid="fn284">56</xref></sup> All of this is now hidden in the Torah and <italic>mitzvot</italic>, yet in the future the blessed God will show it to us without any separating &#x201C;garments.&#x201D; As it is said in the Midrash and in the Gemara (<italic>Nidda</italic>, 61b), &#x201C;the <italic>mitzvot</italic> will be nullified in days to come [of the final redemption].&#x201D; Then the blessed God will show us that we never really suffered under the &#x201C;yoke&#x201D; of a power in this world since He, may He be blessed, controls them all, yet all is in a state of concealment. This is the meaning of &#x201C;that never had a yoke upon it.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; a perfectly red heifer, without blemish, which never carried a yoke.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 19:2)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Heifer&#x201D; represents the central point of life, which causes fruition and increase (the word for heifer, <italic>parah</italic>, is similar to the word for fruitfulness, <italic>priya</italic>). &#x201C;Red&#x201D; represents strength and joy. &#x201C;Perfectly&#x201D; meaning complete in its redness (in its strength and joy), without any folly in the actions of Israel, for &#x201C;an imbecile is blemished.&#x201D; &#x201C;Which never carried a yoke&#x201D; means freedom from any (earthly) yoke (kingdom, or enslavement, in any physical or spiritual form).</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;One who touches the dead .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 19:11)</p>
<p>This means one who has experienced any kind of anger at the blessed God. It is forbidden for him to harbor any complaint or anger at God in his heart for something that has already happened, the way one who is sick and may be healed and should not prevent himself from praying for God&#x2019;s mercies. &#x201C;The dead,&#x201D; means something that has happened in the past, and concerning this it is forbidden to become angry at the attribute of severe judgment. This is the meaning of &#x201C;one who touches the dead,&#x201D; one who became angry, raising complaints, the waters of purification purify him, meaning that the power of the four species in the purifying waters&#x2014;ashes of the heifer, hyssop, cedar, and scarlet&#x2014;will be revealed to him. Contained in these four elements is the root of everything. Because of this, the one who was pure becomes impure.<sup><xref rid="fn285">57</xref></sup> That is to say, the one who is not in need of purification (the <italic>Cohen</italic> performing the act of purification) should not look at this (that though he deals with purifying he himself does not need it). Thus the situation will not bring him to a state of irreverence, saying, God forbid, there are no severe judgments. Rather, at that moment he should succeed (in performing the purification in a complete sense) and fix the man.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And the children of Israel journeyed and camped at Ovot.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 21:10)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Ovot&#x201D; (a place name) signifies the principles of Torah and <italic>mitzvot</italic>, comparable to the expression &#x201C;<italic>av</italic> [like <italic>ov</italic>] <italic>b&#x2019;chochma,&#x201D;</italic> a father in wisdom. It is written in the Gemara (<italic>Berachot</italic>, 54a), &#x201C; &#x2018;it is a time for God to act, for they have made Your Torah void&#x2019; (Tehillim, 119). Rebbe Natan says, &#x2018;It is a time to do for God, for they have made void your Torah.&#x2019; This means, since they have made your Torah void, act only [in the will] of God.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn286">58</xref></sup> At a time when it is perfectly clear that it is a time to act solely for God, like Eliyahu on Mount Carmel,<sup><xref rid="fn287">59</xref></sup> then it is necessary to put aside the principles of the holy Torah and act only in the understanding that the blessed God instills in you.</p>
<p>Rebbe Natan is saying that at a time when this God-given understanding is not completely clear to you, you must act according to the principles of the Torah and <italic>mitzvot</italic> without stepping out of the bounds of the <italic>Halacha</italic>. Yet Rebbe Natan is also saying that if your heart is drawn after the will of the blessed God, and have removed from yourself any kind of impurity (anything that could bring you down), afterward God may provide you with an opportunity to act in a way that may seem as if, God forbid, you have removed yourself from the bounds of the principles of the Torah. Concerning this Rebbe Natan said that for the one whose heart is drawn after God and has cleaned himself from any affliction, certainly God will not let him fall into a transgression, God forbid. He will surely then know that it is &#x201C;a time to do for God.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn288">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus it was when Israel camped at Ovot. For the entire time that Aharon was with them they would conduct themselves according to the understanding of their hearts, which was completely clear to them, as we understand from the clouds of glory in the desert.<sup><xref rid="fn289">61</xref></sup> Yet when the clouds of glory left them (after the passing of Aharon), they began to conduct themselves according to the principles of the Torah. This is like now, with our Holy Temple destroyed, where the only dwelling place of the Holy One, blessed be He, is within the four cubits of the <italic>Halacha</italic>, the law, (<italic>Berachot</italic> 8a). Thus they began to act according to the principles. This is <italic>Ovot</italic>, or the principles (<italic>ovot&#x2014;av b&#x2019;chochma</italic>&#x2014;wisdom of the Torah), as explained above on the verse, &#x201C;Do not make molten gods,&#x201D; in <italic>Parshat Ki Tissa</italic>. However, they understood that through conducting themselves only according to the principles their hearts could not become sufficiently purified so as not to be detracted from the goal of God&#x2019;s will.</p>
<p>This is as it is written (21:1), &#x201C;and the Caananite heard &#x2026; that Israel came by the way of the spies [through Edom].&#x201D; In this, they saw that Israel was confused, for according to the principles it was not yet the time to enter the border of Esav as it is written (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 33:14), &#x201C;until I shall come to my master in Seir [Esav].&#x201D; The Caananite is Amalek, as explained by Rashi, who saw that God presented them with a situation not in accordance with the principles. Thus (God) advised them to clean themselves from all forms of afflictions, and then any suspension of the Torah would be only because it is &#x201C;a time to do for God.&#x201D; This is why it says that they camped at <italic>Iye Ha&#x2019;avarim</italic> (21:11), for there they inspected themselves concerning the two prohibitions (<italic>avarim</italic> is similar to <italic>averot</italic>, transgressions) &#x201C;do not kill&#x201D; and &#x201C;do not commit adultery,&#x201D; two laws that are the foundation and root of the entire Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn290">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>Thus the advice given if you happen upon a situation that seems to you is against the Torah, you must inspect yourself concerning these two transgressions. The place name &#x201C;Iye Ha&#x2019;avarim&#x201D; hints at this, for Iye shares the letters of <italic>ya&#x2019;im</italic> (like a dustpan, <italic>ya&#x2019;e</italic>)<italic></italic>, meaning to remove these transgressions from yourself. <italic>Avarim</italic>, like <italic>avera</italic>, Hebrew for transgression, that you have purified yourself from these two sides. If you put your power into this process of purification, then you arrive at the meaning of what is said, &#x201C;and they camped by the stream of Zared,&#x201D; meaning that God gives us special strength.<sup><xref rid="fn291">63</xref></sup> For <italic>zared</italic> is strength, as it is written (<italic>Yoma</italic>, 47a), &#x201C;all the women did valiantly, but the valor [<italic>zered</italic> or strength] of my mother exceeded them all.&#x201D; And in the desert, when they had inspected themselves and removed any trace of affliction from what had been prohibited, then God heard their voice.<sup><xref rid="fn292">64</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Hear you rebels&#x0021; Shall we bring you water from this rock? And God said to Moshe and Aharon, &#x2018;since you did not believe in Me &#x2026; therefore you will not bring them into the land .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 20:10,12)</p>
<p>For Moshe said to Israel, &#x201C;shall from this rock, concerning which we were not commanded, we bring you water?&#x201D; (Midrash Tanchuma, <italic>Chukat</italic>, 9). Israel was claiming that since this came through a miracle, what is the difference which rock it comes from? Even though a particular rock is special in its ability to give water, God can bring water out of any rock, so why should there be any particular order in a miracle that it is only possible from this rock? Concerning this Moshe was exacting and said to them, &#x201C;from this rock?&#x201D; to show them that with miracles there is also an order, and actually requires this special rock. Thus the Holy One, blessed be He said to him, &#x201C;since you did not believe in Me, then you will not bring them in,&#x201D; not to be exacting, but rather as an answer, measure for measure.</p>
<p>For Moshe Rabeynu knew that it was not for him to bring Israel into the land; this was the lot of Yehoshua, where Moshe&#x2019;s portion was the Torah. Since coming into the land was by means of miracles, as in the conquering of the kings, then the blessed God could make Moshe the instrument to bring them in, for God can do anything. This is the real reason for &#x201C;because you did not believe in Me.&#x201D; Since you yourself explained to Israel that with miracles there is also an order, therefore &#x201C;you will not bring them in&#x201D; (measure for measure) that selfsame reason necessitates that you will not bring them in. This is not in your portion, but the portion of Yehoshua, for he is the instrument prepared for this (This will be My order.) This is because with miracles there is also an order.<sup><xref rid="fn293">65</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And God spoke to Moses and to Aharon at Hor haHar on the border of the land of Edom saying, &#x201C;Aharon shall be gathered unto his people .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 20:23)</p>
<p>Why was Aharon buried on the border of the land of Edom? Because Edom (Esav) is the primary opponent of service, asserting that since he is clean regarding his mother that he does not need such service. Aharon is the most refined of all the souls of Israel, and is deeply connected to service, and by means of this the seed of Esav is eradicated.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and they camped at Iye haAvarim, in the wilderness before Moav, toward the east where the sun rises.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 21:11)</p>
<p>They camped at <italic>Iye haAvarim</italic> was because of the suffering they had just experienced (&#x201C;and the people complained against God &#x2026; and He sent snakes&#x201D;). Therefore it says, &#x201C;in the wilderness before Moav, toward the east where the sun rises,&#x201D; which means that they pleaded of God to refine their hearts, not through suffering, but by understanding all through the words of the Torah. For the words of Torah refine the heart of man, and suffering refines the heart of man. They asked that their hearts be refined by means of the words of Torah, as it is written (Tehillim, 74:12), &#x201C;fortunate is the man whom God punishes, and teaches from Your Torah.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And from there to Be&#x2019;er [&#x201C;the well&#x201D;], that is the well which God spoke of to Moshe, &#x2018;gather the people and I will give them water.&#x2019;&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 21:16)</p>
<p>Meaning, at a time when the blessed God wants to grant Israel salvation, He first sends to their hearts an arousal of desire (symbolized by water and the well).</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;The well that the princes dug .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 21:18)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well&#x201D; means <italic>simcha</italic> (true joy) and a good heart. The Patriarchs yearned for this. &#x201C;The princes&#x201D; means the Patriarchs.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And God said to Moshe &#x2026; Take Aharon and Elazar his son, and bring them up to mount Hor &#x2026; and Moshe stripped Aharon of his garments, and gave them to Elazar his son .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 20:23&#x2013;28)</p>
<p>In this <italic>Parsha</italic> the Holy One, blessed be He, shows Israel that they are living and enduring forever, in what He said to Moshe, &#x201C;Take Aharon and Elazar his son.&#x201D; For in the future the principal honor in the word will come from this, that the power of man will spread forth to other souls, as all the High Priests descended from Aharon.<sup><xref rid="fn294">66</xref></sup> In the future they will all surround Aharon, crowning him, and his principal honor will come from them. It is the nature of life that lust is drawn into the heart in childhood, and later jealousy, yet the principal desire in old age is for honor, and honor will last forever also, as it is written (Mishlei, 3:35), &#x201C;the wise shall inherit honor.&#x201D; So it was with Avraham, Yitschok, and Yaakov, where the principal honor materialized in Yaakov Avinu in the twelve tribes that he established, as is explained in the Mei HaShiloach on the Gemara (<italic>Breachot</italic>, 26a), &#x201C;Avraham established the morning <italic>shacharit</italic> prayer.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn295">67</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and they took his whole land from him [Sichon king of the Amorites].&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 21:26)</p>
<p>The Gemara says (<italic>Gittin</italic>, 38:1), &#x201C;Ammon and Moav became pure in Sichon.&#x201D; (The following explains this.) This is as it is written (Tehillim, 136:23), &#x201C;He remembered us in our lowliness.&#x201D; The Holy One, blessed be He, promised Avraham Avinu that his sons would inherit ten nations, and these ten nations correspond in a spiritual sense to the ten forces of <italic>kelipa</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn296">68</xref></sup> for God created one according to the other.<sup><xref rid="fn297">69</xref></sup> The seven nations<sup><xref rid="fn298">70</xref></sup> stand for external, revealed forces, i.e., actions. The remaining three (who we met on the way and were not commanded to destroy), Kini, Kenzi, and Kedmoni, who are actually Ammon, Moav, and Edom, correspond to the internal forces, that in the realm of holiness correspond to thoughts, gut feelings, the will of the heart.</p>
<p>Thus in the level of action&#x2014;the external forces&#x2014;Israel is in a state of purity compared to the seven nations, and thus it was within their power to conquer them. Yet on the level of thought, we were and still have not been purified, for there is no righteous one on earth who has not sinned in his mind. Yet in future times, when Israel will achieve purity even on the level of thought, then it will be within their power to conquer even the three remaining nations. And now, &#x201C;even in our lowliness He remembered us,&#x201D; and took the lands of Ammon and Moav and gave them to Sichon (who we conquered), and Sichon as the king of the Emorites was of the seven nations, in comparison us with were in a state of purity.</p>
<p>This is hinted at in the practice of Israel to wear two head coverings (at least by many observant Jews while praying), which hints at <italic>hod v&#x2019;hadar</italic>, majesty and splendor. For <italic>hod</italic> (majesty) is the internal level, and <italic>hadar</italic> (splendor) is beauty, apparent to all. The nations are only on the external level, which is beauty revealed for all to see, but on an internal level they are far from the blessed God, whereas Israel is united in her heart with the blessed God, her insides are imbued with the love of God. Therefore they go with two head coverings to hint that their insides are like their outsides. The nations cry out over this, and from their cries it is made known that the salvation is near, for whenever the blessed God desires the salvation of the world it wakes an accusing spirit among the nations, and it is a time of suffering for the nation of Yaakov. Then from these times they will be helped, until it becomes clear that Israel is cleaving to God even on the level of thought. Then the final redemption will come. (Then there will be no more accusations or suffering.)</p>

<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> B<small>ALAK</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Balak saw .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 22:1)</p>
<p>This <italic>Parsha</italic> is written in the Torah because &#x201C;He showed His people the power of His actions to give them the inheritance of the nations&#x201D; (Tehillim, 111:6). Here the blessed God showed Moshe in a prophetic message what Balak was thinking and how he feared Israel. Also concerning Rachav (Joshua, Ch. 2), when Israel saw that fear of them had spread over the nations, they then understood that God is giving them the land as an inheritance.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Bilaam said to God, Balak son of Tsippor sent to me.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 22:10)</p>
<p>Since Bilaam was sitting and longing that some nation would send for him (to curse Israel), thus it arose in the heart of Balak to summon him. Bilaam had entertained desires to uproot Israel even when they were in exile in Egypt, as it is said in the Midrash (<italic>Shemot</italic> Rabba, <italic>Parsha</italic> 1:12), &#x201C;three advised Pharaoh, Bilaam, Job, and Yitro &#x2026; Bilaam advised him to destroy them.&#x201D; Yet after he saw them go out of Egypt and God performing miracles for them he feared cursing them by himself, and waited expectantly for a nation to send for him, and that gave him an excuse to ask of God. Also, this is the ninth verse in the <italic>Parsha</italic>, and every time the ninth verse appears it contains an intention far deeper than it would seem at first glance according to its plain meaning.<sup><xref rid="fn299">71</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;For there is no divination in Jacob and no magic in Israel, thus in time it will be said to Jacob, what has God wrought?&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 23:23)</p>
<p>Divination (<italic>nachash</italic> in Hebrew) is stubbornly holding on to something without letting that thing go out of one&#x2019;s mind. Magic (<italic>qesem</italic> in Hebrew) is the opposite, that is, when one equivocates over something, whether to do it or not, waiting and seeing if it turns out well, then doing it, and if doesn&#x2019;t, then not doing it. This is magic,<sup><xref rid="fn300">72</xref></sup> or waiting to see how something will act of its own accord. Both (<italic>qesem</italic> and <italic>nachash</italic>) are forbidden when not used in their proper place. This means that at a time when one knows God&#x2019;s will with clarity, it is forbidden for him to remain silent and let things happen of their own accord, but must rather strengthen himself like a lion and act with strength. In a place where one is uncertain of something it is forbidden to act with force, but rather to consider how the action may come out of its own accord without his mental input. This is as we find in the Gemara, (<italic>Chullin</italic>, 95a), &#x201C;Rav examined a ferryboat,&#x201D; for when he reached a river the boat just came to him, without any effort of his own. From this he understood that it was from God, and without this sign he would not have traveled.</p>
<p>Therefore it is written divination (<italic>nachash</italic>) with Jacob, for Jacob is called a man who is not yet in a state of completeness and whose heart is not yet drawn after God&#x2019;s will. We find that when the prophet is expressing the smallness of Israel he calls it in the name of Jacob, as in (Amos, 7:2), &#x201C;how shall Jacob stand for he is small?&#x201D; Therefore he said that there shall be no <italic>nachash</italic> in Jacob, for at a time when a soul in Israel is uncertain about something not to act stubbornly, but rather remove all affliction from himself, and see that however God acts, that is how he will act in the matter. And no <italic>qesem</italic> in Israel, meaning that for one whose heart is completely drawn after the blessed God, whatever thought that falls into his head is only from the will of God and has been (Divinely) bestowed upon him. (Acting upon this thought) would not be irresponsible but should rather be done with force, for if not, he would, God forbid, be acting against the understanding of the blessed God. With this Bilaam was praising Israel, for each one recognizes his value.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; thus in its time it will be said to Jacob and Israel, what has God wrought?&#x201D;</italic></p>
<p>This means that at each and every moment each soul in Israel, from the small to the great, shall know what the blessed God wants NOW. Each one shall see according to the understanding of his heart that now the will of the blessed God is thus, and not according to the principles (of the Torah).<sup><xref rid="fn301">73</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Water shall drip from his buckets and his seed shall be in great waters .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 24:7)</p>
<p>Bilaam asked to curse Israel with a mind distressed from the antagonism of the nations, whose influence would eventually cause them to forget the words of Torah. As it is said in the Holy Zohar (<italic>Parshat Balak</italic>, 212a), &#x201C;his seed in the great waters&#x201D; means that Israel would be in a place where their prophetic spirit would neither grow nor increase.&#x201D; &#x201C;Great waters&#x201D; means the nations, as it is written (Song of Songs, 8:7), &#x201C;great waters cannot extinguish [love].&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn302">74</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;I see it, but not now .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 24:17)</p>
<p>He said that now the blessed God is not watching over Israel, but will only watch over them in the future. Yet this is only according to his understanding, for he sees the oppression of Israel and God&#x2019;s silence. But in truth (as we have written in the Passover Haggadah), in every generation He saves us from their hands, and watches over us with <italic>hashgacha pratit</italic> (individual providence), God&#x2019;s personal involvement in each soul of Israel (ensuring our well-being).</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and destroy all the descendants of Seth.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 24:17)</p>
<p>Here Bilaam said to destroy everything that was in the world from the day of its creation. If his intention was only for those who were alive, it would have been enough to say &#x201C;all the descendants of Noah,&#x201D; for all the life in the world (at that time) was only from Noah&#x2019;s offspring. Yet he said &#x201C;Seth&#x201D; because his intention including everything from creation, even those who are not now alive. The reason he said &#x201C;descendants of Seth&#x201D; and not &#x201C;descendants of Adam&#x201D; was because he could not see Cain and Abel, who were born in the garden outside of this world, and Bilaam could only see in this world.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And he looked on the Kenites, and he took up his parable and said, your dwelling place is strong, and you put your nest [</italic>ken<italic>] in a rock.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 24:21)</p>
<p>Meaning that from him a <italic>Parsha</italic> was carved (as in a rock) in the words of Torah, and the words of Torah are living and enduring forever (&#x201C;your dwelling place is strong&#x201D;).</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And behold, a man of the children of Israel came and brought close to his brethren a woman of Midian before Moshe and before the whole community of Israel .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 25:6)</p>
<p>Before his punishment he was called &#x201C;a man of the children of Israel&#x201D; and afterward he is called &#x201C;a man of Israel [verse 14].&#x201D; This man said to Moshe, &#x201C;who said Yitro&#x2019;s daughter is permitted to you? You must have seen that she has a portion in the world to come. I too see that the woman of Midian has a portion in the world to come.&#x201D; On this it is written, &#x201C;Do not praise tomorrow, for you do not know what the day will bring forth&#x201D; (Mishlei, 27:1), for even if you see that the future will bring something good you still do not know how God will act at any present given moment. Yet since the blessed God illuminated into Moshe how to act in the present moment, therefore she was permitted to him. And in the future God will make it clear that the soul of this woman of Midian was connected to the root of his soul, as is explained in the writings of the Ari&#x2019;zal; therefore he is afterward called &#x201C;a man of Israel.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn303">75</xref></sup></p>

<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And God spoke to Moses saying, &#x2018;Pinchas son of Elazar son of Aharon haCohen has removed My fury from being sent upon the children of Israel in taking My vengeance among them, and I did not destroy .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 25:10)</p>
<p>It is written in the Gemara (<italic>Sanhedrin</italic>, 82b), &#x201C;The ministering angels asked to punish Pinchas. God said to them, &#x2018;let him go, he is a zealot, the son of my zealot [being from the tribe of Levi], an appeaser of my wrath, the son of one who appeased my wrath [being the grandson of Aharon who appeased God&#x2019;s wrath in the affair of Korach].&#x2019;&#x201D; &#x201C;The angels asked to punish Pinchas,&#x201D; for a man may not take up the vengeance of God unless he is clean in this aspect. On this God testified, &#x201C;he is a zealot, the son of my zealot,&#x201D; to show that (just as were Shimon and Levi when they destroyed Shchem) he was clean and pure in this aspect. Furthermore, the tribes began to shame him, saying that he did it because of his hatred for Zimri. God answered them, &#x201C;in taking up My vengeance among them,&#x201D; meaning that his vengeance was owing to his great love for Israel, hinted at in the words &#x201C;among them.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Pinchas son of Elazar son of Aharon haCohen saw &#x2026; and took a spear .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 25:7)</p>
<p>It would not, God forbid, occur to anyone to say that Zimri was engaged in random or lewd sexual behavior (<italic>niuf</italic> in Hebrew), God forbid, for from <italic>niuf</italic> the Holy One, blessed be He, would not have made a <italic>Parsha</italic> in the Torah. Rather, there is a secret in this whole affair, for there are ten levels in <italic>znut</italic> (perversity or general licentiousness); the first (and lowest) level is when one dresses up and goes intentionally to commit a sexual transgression, meaning one who deliberately invites the evil inclination upon himself. After this there are nine other levels, with each one a man&#x2019;s power of free choice is taken from him a little more. (With the first level it was totally within his power to refrain), and with each level it becomes more and more difficult to escape the transgression. Finally at the tenth level, where one distances himself from the evil inclination and guards himself from transgression with all his power until it is impossible to guard himself anymore, if his evil inclination overpowers him and he does such an action, then it certainly must be the will of God. Such was the case with Yehuda and Tamar, for she was his true soulmate. This is also the case here, for Zimri truly guarded himself from all evil desires, and now it occurred to him that she was his soulmate, since it was not within his power to remove himself from the action. Pinchas said the opposite, that it was still in Zimri&#x2019;s power to remove himself from this.</p>
<p>This is hinted at in the Gemara (<italic>Sanhedrin</italic>, 82b), &#x201C;six miracles were performed for Pinchas,&#x201D; and as it is said there, &#x201C;if Zimri had separated from Cosbi, and risen up to kill Pinchas, then Zimri would have been found innocent of murder [acting in self-defense. That he did not do this was the miracle.]&#x201D; Here there was a deliberation of each side, for with Pinchas there is also room for criticism. Existing within him there is something that seems on the surface to be anger. Truly they claimed this against him, and here the judgment is at the discretion of the judge. As Rabeynu Tam explained (Tosefot <italic>Baba Batra</italic>, 35a,), &#x201C;it is possible for the judge to give to those close to him,&#x201D; therefore Pinchas emerged blameless because he was close to Moshe Rabeynu. This is why it said, &#x201C;the name of the Israelite man who had been struck,&#x201D; for after the action was done, the Holy One, blessed be He, showed Pinchas with whom his struggle was really with (because he was Zimri&#x2014; &#x201C;who truly guarded himself,&#x201D; etc.). He was not to think that Zimri was completely sexually corrupt, God forbid. And in Pinchas&#x2019;s eyes, since he had come from the seed of Yosef and had become purified concerning this through mortification of the flesh and trials, the action of Zimri was a great evil.</p>
<p>On this it is written (Hoshea, 11:1), &#x201C;for Israel is a child, and I loved him.&#x201D; This is precisely the matter of Pinchas, for he judged Zimri as a <italic>noef b&#x2019;alma</italic> (sexually corrupt), and the judgment of this is that a zealot may kill him.<sup><xref rid="fn304">76</xref></sup> However, the depth of the foundation of the matter with Zimri was hidden from him, for Cosbi was his soulmate from the six days of creation, as explained in the writings of R. Isaac Luria, Z&#x2019;L. Owing to this, Moshe Rabeynu didn&#x2019;t become involved and sentence Zimri to death. Pinchas&#x2019;s response in this action is thus compared to a child, meaning that he didn&#x2019;t know the depth of the situation, seeing only through human eyes and no further. Nevertheless, the blessed God loved him and agreed with him, for in Pinchas&#x2019;s mind he had done a great and self-sacrificing act in his zealotry.<sup><xref rid="fn305">77</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Therefore say, I give him My covenant of Peace.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 25:12)</p>
<p>Moshe was not fit for zealotry, for in his great light he would have punished him in body and soul. But Pinchas, a young sage, only punished him in body. Therefore it was proper to give him &#x201C;My covenant of Peace.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Harass the Midianites &#x2026; for they harass you in their wiles with which they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 25:17&#x2013;18)</p>
<p>Truly the heart of Israel is clean of all dross and refuse, and will not be drawn away from the will of the Holy One, blessed be He. However, when Israel has transgressed the will of the blessed God, it was not from within themselves, but from the power of the nations that entered into them. For the nations are filled with lusts and evil desires, and the heart of Israel can be affected by their power. This is as the verse says, &#x201C;for they harass you in their wiles,&#x201D; meaning that by means of their evil thoughts they will also harm you. Yet when the evil power in the nations has been destroyed, then the heart of Israel will be connected to the blessed God without the slightest deviation.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Moses brought their case [of the daughters of Tslofchad] before God.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 27:5)</p>
<p>It is said in the Midrash (Rabba, 21:13), &#x201C;they came before the princes of tens and the princes of hundreds, and all feared to rule on their case, and even Moshe Rabeynu feared this until he brought the case before the Holy One, blessed be He.&#x201D; The matter is explained thus. The sin of the one found gathering wood on Shabbat (Tslofchad) was that he sinned against Moshe Rabeynu. It is said in the Zohar (<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 205b), &#x201C;the portion of Moshe Rabeynu was Shabbat, as it is said [in the morning prayer of Shabbat], &#x2018;Moses rejoiced at the granting of his portion.&#x2019;&#x201D; Tslofchad did not uphold the Shabbat on the second Shabbat that was commanded of Israel (since the giving of the Torah), yet if he had only fulfilled the commandment of Shabbat on this second Shabbat, the level of Shabbat that is the level of Moshe Rabeynu would have been immediately revealed to all. Because of the sin of Tslofchad, who had transgressed the second Shabbat, this light was closed from Israel. Because of this Moshe Rabeynu was uncertain whether he could be lenient (with Tslofchad&#x2019;s daughters) or not. In the realm of physical damage it is forbidden for a scholar to be lenient (<italic>Yoma</italic>, 23a), yet with monetary damage he is required to be lenient. As it also says there, &#x201C;all who restrain their anger and act toward others with lenience, all their sins are forgiven.&#x201D; Monetary damage is something of this world and can be returned, while physical injury is something that leaves a scar forever.</p>
<p>Moshe was thus uncertain. Perhaps this action was (on the level of) monetary damage, meaning that in the future the Holy One, blessed be He, would return this light to Israel, and it would be clear to all of Israel the goodness of the level of Shabbat, and that it was only lost temporarily. Or maybe it was (on the level of) physical damage, that if the souls of Israel only knew the precious depth of Shabbat, with what great strength and awesome they would have served God. Because Moshe was uncertain of this, all the judges were afraid to rule on the case of the daughters of Tslofchad fearing that they would insult the honor of Moshe Rabeynu. God answered Moshe that since the light of Shabbat was only closed from them temporarily, it is called monetary damage, and he could be forgiving.</p>

<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> M<small>ATTOT</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Moshe spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel saying, this is the word which God has commanded.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 30:2)</p>
<p>&#x201C;All the prophets prophesied with &#x2018;Ko,&#x2019; &#x2018;thus [spoke God],&#x2019; Moshe was superior to them all, saying, &#x2018;<italic>Ze haDavar</italic>,&#x2019; &#x2018;this is the word&#x2019;&#x201D; (Sifrei <italic>Mattot</italic>, 2).<sup><xref rid="fn306">78</xref></sup> Moshe&#x2019;s level of prophecy only occurred in this (Moshe&#x2019;s) generation. That is to say, all the prophets had a mission to Israel in conveying of their prophecies according to the particular time in which it was said and according to the power of their understanding. They would prophesize within these parameters. It occurred to them in their prophetic spirit that whichever particular word of prophecy they were speaking was enduring for all eternity. Yet truly, there existed changes according to the quality of each generation. On this, &#x201C;Moshe Rabeynu&#x2019;s level of prophecy was superior to them all, prophesizing with &#x2018;this is the word.&#x2019;&#x201D; This means that he understood the prophecy according to its time and place, understanding that a prophecy is only relevant for a particular time, and later God may desire something else. This is why the <italic>Parsha&#x2019;s</italic> discussion of the laws of vows opens with &#x201C;this is the word,&#x201D; even though it is a commandment incumbent on every generation. This is understood from the Gemara (<italic>Baba Batra</italic>, 120a&#x2013;b), &#x201C;from sacrifices slaughtered outside.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn307">79</xref></sup> Nonetheless it is introduced with &#x201C;this is the word,&#x201D; for one who vows not to do something does so according to the level of his understanding that this abstention will bring him to the service of God. He also understands that this action has nothing inherently good about it. Therefore it is said, &#x201C;this is the word,&#x201D; for one must understand that the particular action is only temporarily forbidden to him, and that the blessed God can give him the power to receive all the good of the world without being disconnected from the service of the Divine.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;A man who makes a vow .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 30:3)</p>
<p>This is as it is written (Tehillim, 104:24), &#x201C;How great are Your works, God, You have made them all with wisdom, You have filled the land with your possessions.&#x201D; Here is the root of the matter of the prohibition of vows (<italic>Nedarim</italic> in Hebrew). Truly, all the boundaries and &#x201C;fences&#x201D; (used to protect the source of the law), whether involving an action, or whether involving refraining from an action, are included in the 613 commandments. The 613 commandments are necessary in every time, for all of Israel, without any kind of change or deviation from the source in any form. Still, we find situations in the world that are forbidden temporarily. In such a case, if one deems it necessary to forbid himself something, or (a legal authority) declares something forbidden to his whole generation, boundaried off according to a specific time, thus it would only carry the weight of a rabbinical prohibition and a &#x201C;fence.&#x201D; For this reason, the Torah gives us the discussion of vows, where for the specific time each fence is deemed necessary it will be included in the words of Torah and carry the weight of a scriptural prohibition. Then when it becomes necessary it will be like one of the 613 <italic>mitzvot</italic> delivered to Moshe, different only in that it can be changed according to the specific time. Thus any time one takes upon himself a vow, delineating his actions by refraining from something, he is completing the entire structure of the words of Torah.</p>
<p>This is as we have in the Gemara (<italic>Shabbat</italic>, 119b), &#x201C;all who say, &#x2018;[thus the heavens and the earth] were completed,&#x2019; it is if he is made a partner with the Holy One, blessed be He, in the act of creation.&#x201D; For the entire purpose of the creation of the world was in order for us to praise the blessed God, and at the time each one stands to give praise and thanks for this creation, he is completing it, or made a partner in it, as it were. Similarly, when making a &#x201C;fence&#x201D; or a vow for a specific period of time, one is completing the honor of the Torah. On this it is written, &#x201C;how great are your works, God &#x2026; You fill the land &#x2026;&#x201D; This means &#x201C;You fill the land,&#x201D; even now at each and every moment, &#x201C;with Your possessions,&#x201D; that is, with the completion of the words of Torah, to make this completion with words and fences to form Torah-ordained prohibitions.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;A man who makes a vow .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 30:3)</p>
<p>It is said in the tractate <italic>Nedarim</italic> (vows) (10a), &#x201C;what is <italic>konam</italic>? [Used as a proclamation when one makes a vow of abstinence.] Rabbi Yochanan said it comes from a foreign language. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said that it is a term that sages reserved for vows.&#x201D; The matter of this is similar to what is written (Job, 28:28), &#x201C;The fear of God is wisdom, to turn from evil is understanding.&#x201D; Wisdom (<italic>Chochma</italic> in Hebrew) is when one considers everything carefully, understanding with his approval that the action is proper to do, and separating himself from that which is not proper. Understanding (<italic>Binah</italic> in Hebrew) is when his heart is refined to such a degree that nothing against the will of God will enter it, nor will he desire anything against the will of the blessed One. For all whose hearts are not yet refined need boundaries and &#x201C;fences,&#x201D; so as not to come to failure. Therefore Rabbi Yochanan said that all the terms used for vows of abstention are from foreign languages. In the eyes of the sages foreign languages were likened to stammering, and thus it is with one who has not internalized the concept of <italic>Binah</italic> (understanding), having it fixed in his heart so as not to need the boundaries and fences (of the law). Therefore it is called a &#x201C;foreign language.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn308">80</xref></sup> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said, &#x201C;it is a term separated for vows by the sages.&#x201D; Each one explained <italic>konam</italic> according to the root of his soul. Rabbi Yochanan was completely righteous from his birth. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, however (a famous <italic>Ba&#x2019;al Tshuva</italic>), understood according to his root that &#x201C;[the Divine attribute of] &#x2018;great mercy&#x2019; is a staff tilting those unworthy to the side of mercy&#x201D; (<italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic>, 17a). He saw how even those terms from foreign languages were designated by the sages, for the blessed God in his great compassion will not abandon any intention for the sake of Heaven even if it is not yet complete.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Take vengeance of the children of Israel on the Midianites and afterward you will be gathered unto your people.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 31:2)</p>
<p>Midian teaches of illusion.<sup><xref rid="fn309">81</xref></sup> Moshe was called the wisdom of all of Israel, as explained in <italic>Parshat Tetsave</italic> (under the passage beginning &#x201C;Go command&#x201D;). Here the Holy One, blessed be He is saying to Moshe that when the power of illusion (<italic>Midian</italic>) is removed from the heart of Israel, then the children of Israel will not need to use their wisdom<sup><xref rid="fn310">82</xref></sup> in order to know the will of the blessed God. Then, even without thinking, their intentions will be according to the will of God.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And they waged war on Midian .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 31:7)</p>
<p>&#x201C;And they waged war,&#x201D; (<italic>yits&#x2019;be&#x2019;u</italic> in Hebrew) is similar to the word &#x201C;finger&#x201D; (<italic>etsba</italic> in Hebrew), meaning that each of the warriors was directed to the goal of the war as clearly as if they were all pointing with one finger. All of Israel equally was given the Torah to guard in its totality, yet at times the evil inclination comes to the heart of Israel from the power of the nations, depending on the particular kind of inclination according to the character of the nation it comes from. Thus Israel must guard itself more in that aspect of Torah more than any other in order not to come to a point of failure. Also here, Moshe Rabeynu chose the specific warriors who would fight Midian, choosing the people who could stand against the evil inclination of the Midianites. Furthermore, &#x201C;wage war&#x201D; (<italic>yits&#x2019;be&#x2019;u</italic>) comes directly from the word for army (<italic>tseva</italic>), referring to the way each troop is bannered, &#x201C;displaying their colors,&#x201D; as it were, for those who were chosen were exemplifying certain characteristics in Israel that they could use in order to stand against the Midianites.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Moshe was angry [that they had not killed the Midianite women] &#x2026; behold, they caused Israel to treacherously act against God concerning Pe&#x2019;or .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 31:14&#x2013;16)</p>
<p>Here Moshe Rabeynu showed Pinchas that he had made the same mistake that Zimri and all those involved with (the illicit lewdness of) Pe&#x2019;or had made, their mistake being that they saw these souls of Midian possessed <italic>Kedusha</italic>. We find Zimri claiming to Moshe (<italic>Sanhedrin</italic>, 82a), &#x201C;Who made Yitro&#x2019;s daughter, a Midianite, permitted for you to marry?&#x201D; His claim is that just as Moshe Rabeynu understood that Tsipporah was connected to him in his soul, so is Cosbi connected to Zimri, as in the writing of the Ari&#x201D;zal, that Cosbi was a reincarnation of Dinah, and he was of Shchem. Pinchas saw his mistake and killed him, as is explained there, for the blessed God did not choose this matter to come about this way in the world. Here Moshe Rabeynu showed Pinchas that he is now making the same mistake in letting the souls of Midian live, that in vain it occurred to them that they could enter them into a state of <italic>Kedusha</italic>. For here they did not actually see the action (as with Zimri), and it seemed to Pinchas that they would be permitted to live, yet Moshe Rabeynu understood that at the depths they are forbidden. (At the same time) Moshe Rabeynu showed Pinchas that in the action of Pe&#x2019;or there was some reason to suppose that these souls would be permitted (to live), for in truth, from a certain facet there was a connection to their souls.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Elazar haCohen said to the men of war who were coming to battle .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 31:21)</p>
<p>It seems as if it should have been said, &#x201C;who came <italic>from</italic> the battle,&#x201D; as it said earlier (in verse 14). But in truth, since the rage of Moshe Rabeynu had been kindled, in saying, &#x201C;you let all the females live,&#x201D; they had an answer to give him to justify their action.<sup><xref rid="fn311">83</xref></sup> However, Elazar haCohen saw that if they had given an answer to contradict Moshe Rabeynu, they would have done irreparable damage. At this time Moshe Rabeynu was standing with absolute clarity on every matter directly to the life of the world to come, with no relevance whatsoever to this world. Until now it was within the power of Moshe Rabeynu to be forgiving, but at this moment he was not able to be forgiving. Elazar haCohen understood this and why it was happening, so he hastened to signal to Israel not to, God forbid, contradict Moshe Rabeynu at this time. With the intention of the heart of Israel to come and enter into an argument with Moshe, they were &#x201C;coming to battle,&#x201D; as it were, for the battle here was now between them and Moshe Rabeynu. So here Elazar taught them the laws of purifying the vessels of idolaters, for even a prohibition that had &#x201C;absorbed&#x201D; anger by the one who taught it is not to be regarded. When they heard that a vessel that had absorbed impurity was forbidden, they said, let us go and offer a sacrifice to complete what we cannot do with our thought alone. Also rust, which our sages taught must be removed before the purification process [see Rashi here], also hints at anger.<sup><xref rid="fn312">84</xref></sup> This is why Pinchas (Elazar&#x2019;s son) was called &#x201C;an appeaser of My wrath, the son of one who appeased my wrath,&#x201D; and we see as mentioned above how Elazar managed to appease God&#x2019;s wrath (by making peace in Israel).</p>

<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> M<small>AS&#x2019;EI</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;These are the voyages of the children of Israel &#x2026; and Moshe wrote their departures to their journeys according to God, and these are their journeys according to their departures.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 33:1&#x2013;2)</p>
<p>Why is it first said, &#x201C;and Moshe wrote their departures to their journeys according to God,&#x201D; and after it is written (inversely), &#x201C;these are their journeys according to their departures?&#x201D; Included in the forty-two journeys are all the trials and (resulting) elevated spiritual states that each soul in Israel may achieve. From God&#x2019;s perspective, the entire creation was to exist equally on the same level, where all, from the small to the great, receive their existence from the essence of the blessed God. However, He created a variety of trials before man so that one may rise above another based on his actions, thus coming to a state of spiritual elevation above his peers.</p>
<p>Because of this, at first, when it is written, &#x201C;according to God,&#x201D; it says, &#x201C;their departures to their journeys,&#x201D; for from God&#x2019;s point of view one has no advantage over another, for they all live in an existence coming from God&#x2019;s essence (all departing from&#x2014;coming out of &#x2014;God equally). Also there is no advantage in one&#x2019;s actions. That which he desires he chooses. For when they left Egypt, the redemption was by means of a &#x201C;leap,&#x201D; as in &#x201C;leaping on the mountains&#x201D; (Song of Solomon, 2:8). As the Ari&#x201D;zal explained, God did not distinguish anyone based on actions (no matter how low, they &#x201C;leapt&#x201D; into redemption), for also against Israel there were accusations, such as (<italic>Bamidbar</italic> Rabba, 23:2), &#x201C;both these are idolaters, and those are idolaters.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn313">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet still, the blessed God redeemed them in His great compassion, for with Him they were all purified and all of Israel were devoted to God. Thus, once on their journeys, it was clear to all that they had purified themselves by means of these journeys, and that they were clean at their roots. Therefore when it is written first, &#x201C;according to God,&#x201D; meaning from God&#x2019;s point of view, that first by the fact of their departure they found grace and goodness with God, and afterward, &#x201C;in their journeys,&#x201D; that it was revealed and clear that they were good in their roots. Yet in the end of the verse, which speaks from the point of view of man, it says, &#x201C;their journeys according to their departures,&#x201D; for from the human perspective, one acquires goodness by means of actions and trials.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And they journeyed from Mount Shafer, and they camped at Chareda.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 33:17)</p>
<p>This means, that in any situation where one is uncertain as to the direction of the will of God, he is then advised to boundary himself from the action. This is &#x201C;they camped at Chareda,&#x201D; for owing to one&#x2019;s inner trembling (<italic>Chareda</italic> in Hebrew, trembling at the uncertainty), it is good for him to &#x201C;camp,&#x201D; and refrain from action, as now, when they swore not to force the end of days (by means of excessive supplications. <italic>Ketubot</italic>, 111a). &#x201C;And they journeyed from Chareda and camped at Maqhelot.&#x201D; (<italic>Maqhelot</italic> means gatherings of people.) That is to say, at the time when the blessed God desires to gather us together (in the final redemption) He will then give us special strength in our hearts, and we need not be afraid, may it only be soon and in our days.</p>
<p>Why was the title &#x201C;prince&#x201D; absent with the Yehuda, Shimon, and Binyamin, when enumerating the princes of the twelve tribes (see <italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 34:19&#x2013;21)? Among these tribes there was such a great love for one another, and these princes had such a fondness for their tribes that they could not let themselves be called by the title &#x201C;prince,&#x201D; as they could not stand being elevated above the members of their tribe. Therefore it is said in the Gemara (<italic>Sotah</italic>, 42a), &#x201C;not Yehuda on Shimon, and not Shimon on Binyamin [for in the war between Peqach ben Rmaliyahu king of Israel and Achaz king of Yehuda they showed kindness to their captives],&#x201D; for these were very loving.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;The tribe of the children of Yosef have spoken well [in claiming that the inheritance in the land for the daughters of Tslofchad would be unfairly transferred if they married into other tribes].&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 36:5)</p>
<p>(They have spoken well,) even though it seems like a kind of &#x201C;bad eye,&#x201D; God forbid, that they should be so exacting as to worry that the portion of their tribe would be a little smaller. Yet it is, that the land of Israel hints at the world to come, and then everything will be exact down to a hair&#x2019;s breadth. For now (in this world) God has commanded us to extend ourselves and give charity, for the dimensions of one&#x2019;s portion is not known. Yet in the days to come, &#x201C;each one will be seated in his canopy, and [if one extends his boundaries] he will be burned by the canopy of his neighbor that is not his&#x201D; (<italic>Baba Batra</italic> 75a).<sup><xref rid="fn314">86</xref></sup> Here, in the division of the land of Israel that hints at the world to come, it will be similar, and that is why the tribe of Yosef took care to be so exact.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; the tribe of the children of Yosef have spoken well</italic>.&#x201D; (Bamidbar, 36:5)</p>
<p>Why was the section of the tribe of Yosef&#x2019;s claim written at the completion of the Torah?<sup><xref rid="fn315">87</xref></sup> Since it was only a temporary measure (for the generation entering the land), is to show Israel that &#x201C;not by bread alone does man live, but by all that comes out of the mouth of God does man live&#x201D; (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 8:3). &#x201C;Bread&#x201D; symbolizes the words of Torah, which are the principles necessary at all times for all souls without the slightest deviation from the source. These are the 613 <italic>mitzvot</italic>. The whole point is to understand at every moment the will of God in the words of Torah, knowing His will at all times, within the context of that particular time. Thus light emanates from the words of Torah to the hearts of Israel in order for them to understand the depth of the will of God, according to the time. Therefore this section was written after the completion of the entire Torah, in order to let Israel understand that details emerge from the Torah at all times, at each moment. The words of the Torah are words of advice to let man understand what the blessed God wants of us now, and to do it. Therefore this section was written (at the end), for it too is active only for a specific time.</p>

<ftnote id="fn233">5. <italic>Parshat Shmini</italic> (see &#x201C;of the Camel&#x201D;) refers to the following Gemara (<italic>Shabbat</italic>, 104a): &#x201C;For what reason is the face of the letter <italic>gimel</italic> turned toward the letter that follows it, <italic>dalet</italic>? For it is the nature of those who do acts of kindness (<italic>gomlei chassidim</italic>&#x2014;the same letters as &#x201C;<italic>gimel</italic>&#x201D;).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn234">6. Meaning, surpassing the limits.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn235">7. North represents the <italic>sefirah</italic> of <italic>Gevurah</italic>, strength, which is the limiting force.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn236">8. The <italic>Mei HaShiloach</italic> uses the term <italic>hitnasut</italic>, for a state of spiritual elevation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn237">9. <italic>Chochmah mvurerret.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn238">10. Three concentric circles of encampments encompassed the Mishkan (Tabernacle). Directly surrounding it was the <italic>Machnei haShechina</italic>, the encampment of the Divine Presence, which only admitted <italic>Cohanim</italic>. In the middle there was the <italic>Machanei haLevia</italic>, the encampment of the Levites. On the outside was the <italic>Machanei Israel</italic>, the encampment of the rest of Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn239">11. The Zohar (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 219b) says the following of the wasteful emission of seed:</ftnote>
<ftnote>Rabbi Yehuda said, there is no sin in the world for which there is no <italic>tshuva</italic> (repentance) to rectify it except for this, and and there is no evil one who cannot see the face of the <italic>Shechina</italic> except for one who does this, as it is written (Yeshaya, 60:21), &#x201C;and Your people are all righteous .&#x2026;&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote>However, though there is nothing man can do from his side to make up for this, from the side of God it can surely be rectified.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn240">12. The Hebrew word, <italic>anaqatam</italic>, exactly the letters of this holy name, means &#x201C;their groan, their sigh.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn241">13. See Rashi&#x2019;s interpretation of &#x201C;toward the front,&#x201D; that the six lights on the side were burning toward the central light.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn242">14. So the words &#x201C;in truth&#x201D; would seem to be superfluous.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn243">15. There is a deeper level of consciousness, basically beyond our ability to comprehend, which the Rebbe is paradoxically urging us to keep in mind in our service of God. This is signified by the seventh (middle) branch of the Menorah. In this way Moshe&#x2019;s level of prophecy required him to remain apart from Tsipporah, the depth of which Miriam and Aharon were not aware of in their initial criticism of him. Yet the &#x201C;little foolishness&#x201D; was the public awareness of their error in order to reveal the level of Moshe Rabeynu to Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn244">16. He did not automatically <italic>change</italic> the action before the fact so that it would be acceptable before God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn245">17. For he too came from something so seemingly insignificant.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn246">18. Something that has become ashes signifies something that continues to live even after it has lost all physical attributes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn247">19. The color white is far from and lacking any painted color. Many inanimate things are created white, for white is constantly ready to be painted any color. In this way we should be constantly ready to receive the salvation of the Blessed God. <italic>Tashlum</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn248">20. This could be the Hozer (Seer) of Lublin in the famous story of the woman he met in the house in the forest after he had run away from his wedding. Alone in the forest, and in the middle of a rainstorm, he came upon a house, and a beautiful woman answered the door. He discovered that she was single, and in a state of purity. While his desire was growing within him, he thought to himself, &#x201C;I am doing nothing wrong, but what pleasure will I give God from this?&#x201D; Suddenly he remembered that he was forbidden from remaining alone in a secluded place with a woman. Upon remembering this, the woman and the house vanished before him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn249">21. &#x201C;My evil inclination overcame me&#x201D; is explained either that he had a strong desire then for women; or a strong desire for men, on seeing the male form; or that he was simply overcome with pride.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn250">22. Through anger he can overcome his evil desire. It could be that when the Nazir directed his anger at his own evil inclination, he then managed to overcome it. Then he had no more need of his vow of Nazir, not just because it was driving him in the opposite direction, but because he had fought his inclination to evil and won.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn251">23. &#x201C;And Moshe said to Hovav [Yitro]&#x201D; (<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 10:29). The order of these events [the marching of the tribes under their banners and bringing Yitro close] shows that when they were close to entering the land, signified by the march of the banners, Moshe felt weak because he knew that he would not be the one to lead them into the land. Therefore he brought Yitro close [for encouragement]. <italic>Tashlum</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn252">24. It is only possible for God to bring something from the world to come.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn253">25. Meat teaches of the aspect of words of Torah where, in the phrase of the Gemara, &#x201C;man cannot uphold them unless he has failed in them.&#x201D; Similarly the children of Noach were not permitted to eat meat until after the flood, which was itself like the failure of all mankind until then, and then it was the desire of all the creation to cleave to the soul of man. Previously the creation did not want to cleave to mankind and enter into uncertainty lest mankind would descend from their level in which they trusted. Why should they enter into uncertainty if they could be more successful otherwise? Better to get by on less, for at least it can be relied upon. Then, after mankind sinned even on their superior level, and thus they did not have what to trust in, then creation was willing to enter into uncertainty on the chance that they would reap greater rewards. This is because something that is unsure can enter into greater uncertainty, but not with something that is certain.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Therefore Moshe said, &#x201C;where do I have meat from,&#x201D; for Moshe&#x2019;s portion was Shabbat. That is to say that the blessed God will make it clear to all of Israel that they need no service, but they must serve Him with all the uncertainty. This is as the blessed God answered him that He has another realm of service that is beyond the conscious grasp of man, and man should direct himself into this. So therefore he needs meat, meaning failure and the service even without man&#x2019;s conscious understanding, and in all his haste he will find <italic>tsimtsum</italic> (constriction) without his conscious mind. This matter teaches of the holy name of forty-two letters, &#x201C;Shem Mem Beit,&#x201D; which &#x201C;ascends and does not descend,&#x201D; for in all the actions of man it is not man&#x2019;s mind that controls them, but only the blessed God. <italic>Giliyon Mei HaShiloach</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn254">26. That is, even if their prophecy is coming from Moshe, it is really all coming from the blessed God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn255">27. That is, only God decides who has a share in the world to come, and it does not depend on mankind (Steinsaltz). Also, if God does not see fit to punish the wicked, then will you become fed up with His decision and punish Shlomo haMelech yourself? (Malbim.)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn256">28. Included in this Torah portion are all the matters of prayer, for whosoever needs great mercies, God sends to the heart of the <italic>tsaddik</italic> or righteous leader of the generation to bless him and pray for him. Thus with Yehoshua, our teacher Moshe blessed him and prayed for him. Calev didn&#x2019;t need Moshe&#x2019;s prayer, and therefore the desire to pray for him didn&#x2019;t enter Moshe&#x2019;s heart. Prayer would not have helped the spies, so he did not have the desire to pray for them either. The righteous leader of the generation [<italic>Tsaddik haDor</italic>] needs a great depth of understanding to know why the will to pray for some would not enter his heart, whether it is because he is helped without prayer or because prayer would not help anyway. <italic>Tashlum</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn257">29. See <italic>Bamidbar</italic> Rabba, 16:7; Midrash Tanchuma, Shlach 6; also the Gemara in <italic>Sotah</italic>, 34b, says, &#x201C;Rabbi Yitschok said, we have a tradition in our hands from our fathers that the spies were called according to their actions. We only know how to explain one of them, &#x201C;Satur ben Michael,&#x201D; <italic>satur</italic> that he contradicted (<italic>satar</italic>) the acts of God. [That he made God his enemy, Rashi.] &#x201C;Michael&#x201D; that he made God lowly (<italic>mach</italic>). [Weak, Rashi.] Rabbi Yochanan said, we can also say Nachbi be Vafsi, &#x201C;Nachbi&#x201D; that he hid [<italic>hechbi</italic>] his words [and did not say things as they really were, Rashi], <italic>vafsi</italic> that he stepped over [<italic>pisea</italic>] the attributes of God [skipped over them, not saying when they were, Rashi.].&#x201D; The Holy Isbitser is saying that the work of the &#x201C;one who understands&#x201D; would be similarly to match each name of the spies with each one of the statements of derision of the land. In my small understanding, this would be something like &#x201C;Palti ben Rafu said, &#x2018;the people are strong&#x2019; for he felt weak [<italic>Raf</italic>] before them, and sought refuge [<italic>miflat</italic>]. See Midrash Tanchuma (<italic>Ha&#x2019;azinu 7</italic>), where R. Moshe Hadarshan explains all of these names in this fashion.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn258">30. This is here interpreted that even if the act is contrary to the letter of the Torah it is still for the sake of Heaven.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn259">31. Tslofchad&#x2019;s act of transgressing the Sabbath was unprecedented, so Israel did not yet know the great depth of Shabbat until they found someone breaking it. Seen in this light, his transgression turns out to be a form of valiant self-sacrifice. This is a classic &#x201C;one cannot uphold the Torah until one has failed in keeping it&#x201D; situation, a recurring theme in the Holy Isbitser, which Reb Shlomo Carlebach ZTs&#x2019;L had often explained.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn260">32. <italic>Tekifut</italic>. See note 61, <italic>Sefer Shemot</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn261">33. The spies truly believed, based on this verse, that the generation of the desert was not ready to enter the land.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn262">34. &#x201C;<italic>Tchellet</italic>&#x201D; or sky blue, referring to the blue thread required on the <italic>tsitsit</italic>, made from the blue dye of the Chillazon snail. See <italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 15:38.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn263">35. Korach had already made up his mind that it was exempt, and knew that Moshe would say that it required <italic>tsitsit</italic>, but used the disagreement as a pretext for challenging Moshe&#x2019;s authority.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn264">36. This is the Isbitser&#x2019;s original take on the famous rabbinical saying, &#x201C;all comes from God, except the fear of God.&#x201D; See how this is explained in <italic>Parshat Vayiera</italic>, in the selection, &#x201C;And Sarah denied it, saying, I did not laugh.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn265">37. The first vision of God&#x2019;s chariot has four faces, man, lion, ox, eagle (Yechezkel 1:10), and the second (10:14) says cherub, man, lion, eagle. The Gemara attributes the transformation of the ox to the cherub to the prayer of Yechezkel, for he didn&#x2019;t want anything that would remind of the sin of the golden calf in God&#x2019;s holy chariot.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn266">38. Small meaning God&#x2019;s way is hidden, as opposed to the ox; refined wisdom and God&#x2019;s way, or will, revealed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn267">39. Two levels are operating here simultaneously. The high level, after the final <italic>tikkun</italic>, where God&#x2019;s way is completely apparent to all&#x2014;&#x201C;the face of the ox&#x201D;&#x2014;where all comes from God including the fear of God. This is happening now, constantly, yet we have no apprehension of it. The normal mode of existence, before the final <italic>tikkun</italic>, is the illusion that we have free choice, for the way of God is hidden&#x2014;&#x201C;the face of the cherub&#x201D;&#x2014;all comes from God except the fear of God, which creates the necessity of our service. Korach, operating only on the first level, saw all through messianic eyes, essentially believing that his generation was that of the final <italic>tikkun</italic>. Though it was not to be, still we have a tradition that he will be reincarnated as the High Priest when the temple is rebuilt, soon and in our days.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn268">40. &#x201C;Scatters&#x201D; in the verse is <italic>m&#x2019;zare</italic> in Hebrew, and the Holy Isbitser related this to <italic>Zer</italic> or crown.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn269">41. This is quite striking, for the thirteen principles of exegesis are usually used in the Talmud for deriving Torah laws from verses. An example of the particular principle mentioned above is in <italic>Vayikra</italic> 22:12, which says that a <italic>Cohen&#x2019;s</italic> daughter who marries a non-<italic>Cohen</italic> may not eat tithes, offerings, reserved for <italic>Cohanim</italic>. If she divorces or becomes a widow she would not be allowed to return to eating from the offerings, if it weren&#x2019;t explicitly stated in verse 13. [Example from the Artscroll prayerbook.] The Holy Isbitser in classic hasidic fashion takes the principle out of the realm of exegesis and uses it to show how the sons of Korach receive a fixing of their souls in later generations. This fixing takes the form of having the <italic>tehillim</italic> they composed recited before the blowing of the <italic>shofar</italic>, something so high the Zohar says is the meaning of &#x201C;all that comes out of the mouth of God.&#x201D; [Zohar <italic>Yitro</italic>, 81b]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn270">42. That is, see into his true nature; see Shmuel 1, 17:42.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn271">43. The <italic>Sefer Yetsira</italic> is the most ancient of kabbalistic texts, whose authorship is attributed to Avraham Avinu. This phrase is mentioned in the first chapter. According to the Ari&#x201D;zal&#x2019;s &#x201C;Shaar haCavanot,&#x201D; on the festival of Succot, the six permutations of <italic>Yud Hei</italic> and <italic>Vav</italic> signify the six directions of the <italic>succa</italic> and all space.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn272">44. It must be remembered that the word <italic>aleph</italic> means both one and one thousand, depending on the vowels.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn273">45. Completion of the light in <italic>Bereshit</italic> equals clarification of the light of Aharon haCohen, who kindles the light of the Menorah in the Mikdash and the light of all the souls of Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn274">46. This is like two brothers who have not seen each other for a long time, and afterward they see each other and recognize each other. Thus here the blessed God showed everyone his portion of life, and they recognized it, for each has already seen it before coming into the world. <italic>Tashlum</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn275">47. See note 43.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn276">48. The Torah is called &#x201C;a tree of life for those who hold on to it.&#x201D; For the present consciousness, life is defined by connection to the Torah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn277">49. This is the same <italic>Choq</italic> of which Rashi said, &#x201C;we may not contemplate its meaning.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn278">50. The root of cow, <italic>par</italic>, is also the root of fruitfulness, <italic>priya</italic>, hence life, as the Holy Isbitser mentions elsewhere.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn279">51. Later the Isbitser adds to this &#x201C;joy.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn280">52. The body here is both physical and spiritual, the 248 limbs of the body associated with the 248 positive commandments.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn281">53. This is not to deny the great suffering in the world, which the author well knew, but rather the messianic time represents a time of complete clarity of understanding of all the events in the world and God&#x2019;s intentions. See the second selection in <italic>Parshat Vayigash</italic>, &#x201C;and Yehuda drew close to him.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn282">54. On this, it may be asked, does it not say &#x201C;the testimony of God is sure, making the simple wise&#x201D;? Yet <italic>Pirkei Avot</italic> says that Moshe delivered the Torah to Yehoshua, and not directly to the elders. It could only be transmitted through Yehoshua.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn283">55. As the Isbitser later mentions, just as a mentally deficient <italic>Cohen</italic>, once called a &#x201C;fool,&#x201D; is disqualified from service, so any action done in foolishness is deficient.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn284">56. Two olive trees stood on either side of his vision of the menorah, standing for the &#x201C;anointed ones standing by the Master of all,&#x201D; <italic>moshiach</italic>. Perhaps what the holy Isbitser is saying is that just as the two olives stand solidly and effortlessly, so will it be clear with the redemption that all the toil and strife was as nothing, that we were always receiving God&#x2019;s providence.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn285">57. The <italic>Cohen</italic>, in a state of purity, by sprinkling the waters of purification on the one who became impure through contact with the dead, in turn becomes impure for a day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn286">58. The laws are temporarily suspended in order that the Torah can later be strengthened. (Steinsaltz)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn287">59. See Kings 1, Ch. 18, where though the building of an altar outside of the temple was not permitted at that time, still Eliyahu had to do it to show the greatness of God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn288">60. This is one of the classic teachings of the Mei HaShiloach and the one that has perhaps engaged him in more controversy with his opponents than any other. It could be easily misinterpreted as being antinomian, that God forbid the Torah is not absolute and we may choose to act based on our own perception of what God wants. This is not what he is saying. It is rather the deepest expression of how one may at times be drawn after the will of God, what Reb Shlomo Carlebach ZTs&#x2019;L used to call being &#x201C;beyond choice.&#x201D; As the author mentions twice, it only happens in a state of complete clarity and after a process of being purified from any affliction or ulterior selfish motive. Then, once this has been clarified, he must start over and inspect himself again. Of course it is not a way to make anything permitted, as only a fool would interpret it, and some fools in our generation have. It is relevant when we find examples of our holy forefathers seemingly &#x201C;breaking&#x201D; the Torah, when in fact they are doing the will of God.</ftnote>
<ftnote>Take Lot and his daughters, an act of incest, which created the line of David. Yehuda and Tamar, also making way for the Moshiach. Tslofchad, who was killed for gathering wood on Shabbat, actually making us aware of the awesome greatness and depth of Shabbat. Aharon and Miriam&#x2019;s &#x201C;little foolishness&#x201D; [see the end of Mei HaShiloach <italic>bha&#x2019;alotcha</italic>] speaking against Moshe, which made us aware of the greatness of Moshe, and Korach&#x2019;s challenge of Aharon, which revealed to us the great depth of the level of Aharon haCohen. One would also include Zimri, who is described in <italic>Parshat Pinchas</italic> as one who was on the highest level of separation from licentious behavior, so his incident with Cosbi can only be understood as an act of God&#x2019;s will. The author mentions Eliyahu on Mount Carmel. This is a central theme of the Mei HaShiloach, and one that must be investigated further.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn289">61. This is expression of the will of God, where the clouds went, they went.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn290">62. This is what the Rebbe seems to have been referring to in the &#x201C;removal of all affliction.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn291">63. Tekifut. See note 61, <italic>Sefer Shemot</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn292">64. This is referring to arriving at Be&#x2019;er, where they merited receiving a spring of water, and sang [<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 21:17].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn293">65. We see that God must also act according to His own order. We see, in order to be ethical, the blessed God creates His own limitations. An example quoted above concerns the sin of the prophet Hoshea who said (<italic>Pesachim</italic>, 87a), &#x201C;exchange them [Israel] for a different people.&#x201D; &#x201C;The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Hoshea, &#x2018;Your children have sinned,&#x2019; to which he should have replied, &#x2018;They are Your children, they are the children of Your beloved ones, they are the children of Avraham, Yitschok, and Yaakov. Show them Your mercy.&#x2019; It was not enough that he did not say this, but he said to Him: &#x2018;Master of the Universe&#x0021; The whole world is yours. Exchange them for a different people.&#x2019; The Holy One, blessed be He, said, &#x2018;What shall I do with this old man [who does not know how to defend his people]? I will order him: &#x2018;Go and marry a whore and raise children of whoredom&#x2019;; and then I will order him: &#x2018;Send her away from your presence.&#x2019; If he will be able to send her away, then I too will send Israel away.&#x2019; For it is said, And the Lord said unto Hoshea, &#x2018;Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredom and children of whoredom,&#x2019; and it is written, &#x2018;So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Divlaim.&#x2019;&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn294">66. Principally from this action of dressing his son in his garments before his death.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn295">67. &#x201C;Avraham established the Morning Prayer, Yitschok the afternoon prayer, and Yaakov the evening prayer.&#x201D; Prayer is the device through which man connects with the blessed God. &#x201C;Avraham established the Morning Prayer&#x201D; means that man expresses thanks over the past and prays for the future, that the blessed God should increase his good. &#x201C;Yitschok established the afternoon prayer&#x201D; means that man shows that he has received the light that was increased for him today, and he is happy with his portion. &#x201C;Yaakov established the evening prayer,&#x201D; means that man needs the blessed God at every second, and will only see light in His light. Therefore the evening prayer is not fixed, and would it only were that man would pray the entire day.</ftnote>
<ftnote>On this it is said, &#x201C;Ekev anava Yirat Hashem,&#x201D; &#x201C;Following [or on the heels of, or because of] humility is the fear of God.&#x201D; In childhood, when the main struggle is the control of lust, then the principal wisdom is the fear of God. When this struggle is no longer necessary, then he must follow the middle path, meaning <italic>Ekev</italic>, following, or the heel, (though corresponding to Yitschok, the connection between <italic>Ekev</italic> and Yaakov, <italic>Tiferet</italic>, the middle column, is also relevant) meaning a balance between love and fear. Afterward, when man&#x2019;s heart is sufficiently purified so as to be drawn after the will of the blessed God, then he is permitted to expand into the world and taste of its good. There were the levels of the Patriarchs. Avraham was &#x201C;the beginning of wisdom is the fear of God,&#x201D; Yitschok was &#x201C;following humility,&#x201D; and Yaakov could taste from all the delights of the world and experience the taste of the source of life.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn296">68. <italic>Kelipa</italic> means peel or husk that surround the sparks, in Lurianic Kabbalah, meaning forces of &#x201C;the other side,&#x201D; impurity, or evil.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn299">71. The ninth hints at the attribute of Yoseph the <italic>Tsaddik</italic>, [the <italic>sefirah</italic> of] <italic>Yesod</italic>-foundation, and there is something hidden within it. This is as it says in the Holy Zohar [<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 3a], &#x2018;[because nine is the Hebrew letter <italic>tet</italic>, the first letter in <italic>tov</italic> or good] letter <italic>tet</italic>, your good is closed within you and hidden within you. See below, in <italic>Parshat Devarim</italic>, &#x201C;I alone cannot bear you,&#x201D; in the notes, where the secret of one of the ninth verses is explained.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn300">72. The main point of <italic>qesem</italic> as understood here is not related to conjuring or supernaturally manipulating nature.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn302">74. The love mentioned is our love for the Torah. Bilaam thought that our exile would cause us to forget the Torah, which has repeatedly happened [re: America], yet the Babylonian exile produced one of the greatest blossomings of Torah ever with the Talmud.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn303">75. Perhaps saying &#x201C;from the children,&#x201D; at least in this case, makes Zimri a little more disconnected, as he was doing something seemingly against his soul&#x2019;s root, whereas &#x201C;a man of Israel&#x201D; has less disconnection, i.e., after it is clarified that Cosbi is connected to him at his soul&#x2019;s root.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn304">76. See the Mishna in <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> 81b, where if one sees another having intercourse with an Aramite, he may kill him in the heat of zealotry, but if he stops to consider the situation, there must be a trial.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn305">77. The references to the writings of R. Luria <italic>Z&#x2019;L</italic> are from <italic>New Writings of Chaim Vital</italic>, Jerusalem 5748, where it is written:</ftnote>
<ftnote>Dinah&#x2019;s root was in <italic>Gevurah&#x2014;Dina Qashia</italic> or severe judgments&#x2014;therefore Shimon took her. Since she was not yet purified, and also had intercourse with the Canaanite, who is the snake, of whom it is said, &#x2018;cursed is Canaan,&#x2019; as is known, therefore Shaul son of the Canaanite descended from her (perhaps was reincarnated, or really descended). Our sages say Shaul is the same as Shlumiel ben TsooriShadai (prince of the tribe of Shimon), who is actually Zimri ben Salu. (See <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> 83a, which says that these are three different names for the same person.) The power of this contamination (of the snake) had been contacted by Cosbi, for Cosbi is also from the remains of the <italic>klipah</italic> (force of evil) of Dinah mother of Shaul, and she was his soulmate, except that she &#x201C;ate an unripe fruit,&#x201D; meaning that she was still not ready for him. Therefore he was called Shlumiel ben &#x201C;Tsoori&#x201D; Shadai and she was Cosbi bat &#x201C;Tsoor.&#x201D; Yet &#x201C;Tsoor,&#x201D; the father of Shlumiel, was Shimon, where &#x201C;Tsoori&#x201D; (&#x201C;My rock&#x201D; in Hebrew) is &#x201C;Shaddai&#x201D; (the name of God the &#x201C;Almighty&#x2019;), which survives the <italic>klipot</italic> and subdues them, and not so the &#x201C;Tsoor&#x201D; of the side of evil the father of Cosbi. We return to the subject. All the actions of our Biblical forebears, and all that is mentioned in the Torah, is not understood only according to its simple meaning and is not governed by chance, God forbid. So do not think that Shlumiel, who was the second-greatest prince, the chosen of the generation of the desert in the days of our master Moshe, was rushing out to commit forbidden sexual acts, as is understood in the small minds of fools. I have not come to explain all the verses necessary for these homilies, for the time would end but not the verses, for the Torah is not &#x201C;old wives&#x2019; tales,&#x201D; or the chatter of birds, God forbid, and this will suffice for those who understand. For these things are the furnace of the universe, and if these matters were to fall into the hands of one who has no brain in his cranium to understand, he will just speak insolently, for a fool does not desire wisdom. Though these things appear strange &#x2026; they stand at the pinnacle of the universe.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn306">78. This normally means that all the other prophets received their prophecy in a vision or a dream, but Moshe would see God&#x2019;s word clearly and lucidly before him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn307">79. &#x201C;From sacrifices slaughtered outside&#x201D; of the temple, and afterward brought to the temple. This command is introduced with &#x201C;this is the word,&#x201D; and ends saying that it is for &#x201C;all generations.&#x201D; The Gemara compares it with the laws of breaking vows, saying that both are relevant in all generations, and then depending on the time and place.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn308">80. Uncertainty as to the will of God is likened to the uncertainty or even confusion of stammering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn309">81. Imagination, <italic>Dimion</italic> in Hebrew, virtually the letters of <italic>Midian</italic>, here meaning an impure imagination.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn310">82. They will not need the living Moshe, the source of their wisdom.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn311">83. In other words, they could say that if they Moshe were truly correct at this time, he would not have displayed any anger, as with all the other ties when he spoke God&#x2019;s word to them. See Rashi on this verse, which says that when one enters the realm of anger, he is liable to make an error, such as the incident of Moshe with the rock (<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 20:11).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn312">84. In this way Elazar diverted them from entering into controversy with Moshe, who was in a state not comprehensible by those in this world.</ftnote>

<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;These are the words .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 1:1)</p>
<p>It is written in the Midrash (Sochar Tov, 39), &#x201C;The Torah was only given to Israel so they would not occupy themselves with idle words.&#x201D; This is the meaning of (Tehillim, 58:2), &#x201C;will indeed the mute speak righteousness?&#x201D; For all the powers that were created in man, the Holy One, blessed be He, gave a commandment with which to serve the blessed God. Man was created with the power of speech, and he was given the words of Torah with which to occupy himself.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; in the plain over against Suf .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 1:1)</p>
<p>Why were the sins of Israel discreetly mentioned through the names of the places where the sins occurred rather than by the mention of the time when they occurred? This is in order that man does not think that the sins were done according to their power of choice, and that they had the choice to remove themselves from the sin. The matter of place hints at this, for it was not possible for them to guard themselves from the sin and move to a different place.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Eleven days from Horev .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 1:2)</p>
<p>With the reception of the Torah the heart of Israel was not yet refined so as to be completely drawn after the will of God. They understood in their intellect that it was good to fulfill the will of God, yet their heart was not yet purified. Only once they had entered the land was their heart refined. This is as Moshe Rabeynu said to them, &#x201C;eleven days from Horev.&#x201D; When you were in Horev and you received the Torah you thought that your hearts were already purified, because directly after that you reached Kadesh Barnea in only three days.<sup><xref rid="fn316">1</xref></sup> Yet it is not so, for (the distance from Horev to Kadesh) is actually eleven days (meaning it is a longer journey, a greater effort), and (in this Moshe was telling them,) &#x201C;You have not yet acquired the words of Torah that they may be fixed in your heart. It is only after forty years, by means of failures and trials, that your hearts became refined,&#x201D; for &#x201C;one cannot uphold the Torah unless he has failed in it [<italic>Gittin</italic>, 43a].&#x201D;</p>
<p>Concerning this King David said (Tehillim, 127:2), &#x201C;It is vain for you to get up early [to think that in only three days you have sufficiently refined your hearts] &#x2026; by eating the bread of sorrows, thus He gives His beloved sleep.&#x201D; Before the heart is refined one must undergo toil and strife in order to fulfill the will of God. Yet after the words of Torah are fixed in his heart, then the Holy One, blessed be He, bestows upon him the words of Torah without any struggle, even while sleeping, and one does not need to undergo great exertion.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; I alone cannot bear you .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 1:9)</p>
<p>The principle of the portion of Moshe Rabeynu was the reception of the Torah, and the land of Israel was the portion of Yehoshua. So when it was said to them (verses 6 and 7), &#x201C;It is enough of your dwelling on this mountain. You shall turn and go,&#x201D; this signified the beginning of their entrance into the land. Then his strength waned.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And I said to them at that time, saying, &#x2018;I alone cannot bear you &#x2026; bring men of wisdom.&#x2026;&#x2019; &#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 1:9, 13)</p>
<p>When they were close to entering the land of Israel, Moshe Rabeynu felt that it was the will of the blessed God that Yehoshua would be the one to bring them in. But still he wanted Israel to pray to God saying that they did not want another leader (than Moshe, in effect to change God&#x2019;s will). This is hinted in the way he said, &#x201C;I alone cannot bear you.&#x201D; (Not alone, but if all of Israel prays, then perhaps.) Even though we find later (at the beginning of the next <italic>Parsha</italic>) that he asks God to be the one to bring them in, he says it to them here in order for them to understand that he needs their prayers now. This verse is the ninth verse from the beginning of the <italic>Parsha</italic>, and each time the ninth verse contains a depth much deeper than the plain meaning, as is explained above in <italic>Parshat Balak</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn317">2</xref></sup> However, they didn&#x2019;t understand (Moshe&#x2019;s hidden meaning, wanting them to pray that he should be the one to bring them in), and they said, &#x201C;it is good to do what you have said [to choose other leaders]&#x201D; (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 1:14). Therefore it is said, &#x201C;Take men of wisdom, of deep understanding, and known,&#x201D; (verse 13) and after, &#x201C;so I took wise men, and known&#x201D; (verse 15). On this our sages say (<italic>Nedarim</italic>, 20b), &#x201C;the second time it does not say, &#x2018;of deep understanding,&#x2019; because he didn&#x2019;t find anyone of deep understanding.&#x201D; This means that (because they answered him in verse 14, &#x201C;it is good to choose new leaders&#x201D;) he didn&#x2019;t find anyone with an understanding of his hidden intention (as if to say), &#x201C;for if you had understood my intention and prayed, maybe your prayer would have been successful.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Hashem your God has increased you, and behold, you are today like the stars of the heavens for a multitude.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 1:10)</p>
<p>It is said in the Midrash (<italic>Devarim</italic> Rabba, 1:13), &#x201C;Moshe Rabeynu said before the Holy One, blessed be He, &#x2018;why did you not compare them to the sun and the moon, which are greater than the stars?&#x2019; The Holy One, blessed be He, answered him, &#x2018;in the future, shame will come from the sun and the moon, as it is said [Yesahya, 24:23], &#x201C;then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun shall be ashamed, when the Lord of Hosts shall reign on mount Zion and Jerusalem.&#x2019;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn318">3</xref></sup> And God continued, &#x2018;yet no shame shall come from the stars, as it is said (Yoel, 2:27), &#x2018;For I am in the midst of Israel, and I am the Lord your God, and there is no other, and you shall no longer be ashamed.&#x2019;&#x201D; The sun and the moon represent a time when one acts according to his own human wisdom and understanding, for (in the time to come) all the thoughts of man according to human wisdom will be nullified. On the other hand, the stars represent the place where the Holy One, blessed be He, illuminates the eyes of man, and he goes according to the illumination of the light of the blessed God. This will endure forever and ever.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And it was, in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month, Moshe spoke .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 1:3)</p>
<p>The reason why he specifies here the exact month is because the month of Shevat (the eleventh month) teaches of the rod [<italic>Shevet</italic> in Hebrew] and ethical reproof, as it is written (Mishlei, 29:15), &#x201C;the rod and reproof will bring wisdom.&#x201D; Here Moshe Rabeynu advised them to enter into the words of Torah, and God would redeem them from all evil, as it is written (Tehillim, 111:9), &#x201C;He sent redemption to his people, He commanded eternally His covenant.&#x201D; The covenant [<italic>brit</italic> in Hebrew] is the Torah, as it is written (Yirmiya, 33:25), &#x201C;If My covenant did not last day and night.&#x201D; This is as it is said (Mishlei, 15:33), &#x201C;the fear of God instructs wisdom,&#x201D; for there is ethical instruction by means of suffering, God forbid, and the study of Torah is also called ethical instruction, as it is said (Mishlei, 8:10), &#x201C;take My instruction.&#x201D; From the words of Torah one may also come to the kind of suffering (bringing ethical understanding), for &#x201C;fortunate is the man whom God punishes, and learns from His Torah [Tehillim, 94:12].&#x201D; This is as it says (Tehillim, 111:10), &#x201C;the beginning of wisdom is the fear of God, a good understanding to all who do them,&#x201D; meaning that this is wisdom and good understanding to the man who enters himself into the words of Torah. By means of this he is saved from all evil.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;For only Og king of Bashan remains &#x2026; Behold&#x0021; His bed is a bed of iron, is it not in Rabat of the children of Ammon? Nine cubits its length and four cubits its width .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 3:11)</p>
<p>Moshe Rabeynu feared Og, because he had the sign of the <italic>brit</italic> (covenant) given to him by our father Avraham, as it is written in the Zohar (<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 184a), &#x201C;for Og was Eliezar the servant of Avraham,&#x201D; as is known. Moshe then feared that maybe God was with him, God forbid. This is why it is written, &#x201C;nine cubits its length and four cubits its width,&#x201D; for four, the letter <italic>dalet</italic>, and nine, the letter <italic>tet</italic>, are the letters preceding the first two letters of the name of God, <italic>Yud Hei</italic>. All the Divine influences to man come from these letters, for the last two letters in God&#x2019;s name, <italic>Vav Hei</italic>, come from the side of human apprehension, as is known. Moshe feared that perhaps the name <italic>Yud Hei</italic> rested on Og, so God showed him that it is not so. Even though it seemed that on the surface his actions were good, still his insides were not clean. This is why it says &#x201C;is it not in Rabat of the children of Ammon.&#x201D; Ammon is the <italic>klipah</italic> (evil force) of desire and promiscuity, as is known from the Zohar (ibid.), &#x201C;that [Ammon] contaminated his sign of the <italic>brit</italic>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Concerning this the Holy One, blessed be He, promised Moshe Rabeynu (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 2:25), &#x201C;On this day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you on the face of the nations which are under all the heavens.&#x201D; &#x201C;Heavens&#x201D; teaches of something that seems to all on the surface to receive power and assistance from the blessed God, and God showed him that among the nations there is none of this in reality. This is why the phrasing seems to be changed. It would seem that it should have been, &#x201C;to put the fear of you on <italic>all</italic> the nations which are under <italic>the heavens</italic>.&#x201D; This hints that all the surface appearances that seem good among the nations really have no substance within them.<sup><xref rid="fn319">4</xref></sup></p>

<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> V<small>AETCHANAN</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And I pleaded to God at that time, saying.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 3:23)</p>
<p>Why did Moshe Rabeynu tell these words to Israel? Even though on the surface it seems as if his prayer had no benefit whatsoever, nonetheless, he caused them to understand that his prayer was not in vain. (It is as if he is saying to them,) even in the course of actions in the land of Israel I am your teacher and Rabbi, and likewise he showed them that his prayer was effective. This is why <italic>Vaetchanan</italic>, Hebrew for &#x201C;and I pleaded&#x201D; (the verb for giving mercy, <italic>chanan</italic>, is intensified into meaning imploring for mercies), because he was made full of entreatment for God&#x2019;s mercies, and his prayer flowed naturally from his mouth. This is a kind of proof that the blessed God sent him the awakening from below to pray. Therefore he surely would not be turned away empty-handed. This is hinted at in &#x201C;at that time,&#x201D; for even though God had already promised me that I would not enter the land, still it did not prevent me from praying.</p>
<p>This is as it is written in the Gemara (<italic>Berachot</italic>, 10a) of Hizkiyah king of Yehuda who said to the prophet Yeshayahu (who had just prophesied that he would die), &#x201C;Son of Amots&#x0021; Stop your prophecy and leave, for thus I have received from my father&#x2019;s house [David, that even in the face of certain death], never to prevent oneself from praying for God&#x2019;s mercies.&#x201D; For there is nothing that stands to prevent one from the mercies of God. [And that it said that Hizkiya turned his face to the wall to pray.] The Gemara learns from this there should be nothing separating one from the wall, meaning that there should be nothing preventing one from prayer, and not to lose heart even if it seems that the decree has come from God, for &#x201C;wall&#x201D; teaches of the source of life.<sup><xref rid="fn320">5</xref></sup> Even though it may seem that there is no salvation from the source, one may not prevent himself from God&#x2019;s mercies.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;You who began to show me .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 3:24)</p>
<p>In other words, that Moshe asserted to God, &#x201C;You sent me the will to pray, creating an opening for me.&#x201D; The blessed God answered him, &#x201C;Rav Lach&#x0021; You have had enough&#x0021;&#x201D; (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 3:26), meaning that all the spiritual awakenings that I have sent you were in order that Israel could learn from you for all generations how to pray to God, and not to prevent themselves from praying, and now &#x201C;it is enough for you.&#x201D; You have received and transmitted a sufficient amount for them to take care of all their needs.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;See&#x0021; I have taught you statutes and judgments as God has commanded me .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 4:5)</p>
<p>The Patriarchs also fulfilled the entire Torah, and taught it to their children, as it is said in the Midrash. Still, before it was commanded by the mouth of Moshe Rabeynu they were performing the precepts of the Torah even though they were not obliged to do so, acting of their own accord. Now Moshe Rabeynu renewed the Torah for them so they would be commanded and then fulfilling what was required of them, which is greater than doing even though it is not required.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;See&#x0021; I have taught you statutes and judgments as Hashem my God has commanded me .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 4:5)</p>
<p>When Moshe Rabeynu saw that he was not to enter the land of Israel, yet they would enter, he feared that the <italic>Kedusha</italic> (holiness) of the land of Israel would be less significant in their eyes. He feared they would say, &#x201C;If it had great <italic>Kedusha</italic> then Moshe Rabeynu would have been able to go in.&#x201D; Therefore he said to them, &#x201C;as Hashem my God has commanded me &#x2026;&#x201D; This means &#x201C;God, who loves me greatly, and if I also entered the land, he would have commanded me also concerning these words of Torah.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn321">6</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And you shall keep them and do them, for it is you wisdom and your understanding in the eyes of the nations .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 4:6)</p>
<p>It is written in the Gemara (<italic>Shabbat</italic>, 75a) that this wisdom is the <italic>sod ha&#x2019;ibbur</italic>, the secret of the calculation of the calendar and establishment of leap years, by which Israel knows how to set the calendar so it will endure throughout the hot and cold seasons. And when the nations see that Israel calculates and sets the calendar so it corresponds precisely to the world&#x2019;s natural phenomena, and that they are doing so not according to their intellect and understanding, then they will understand that Israel is drawing its energy from a source above their intellect.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;For who is a such a great nation who has God close to it .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 4:7)</p>
<p>Whenever we cry out, we have to be intensely close to the blessed God, for the meaning of crying out is desire and yearning for something. On this King David said (Tehillim, 131), &#x201C;A song of ascents. God has not made my heart proud or my eyes high &#x2026; if I have not quieted myself, as a weaned babe by its mother, as my soul is weaned beside me.&#x201D; &#x201C;Weaned&#x201D; is when a small child is separated from its mother&#x2019;s breast. In the same way when a small child wants something it will turn its head and look toward its mother so she doesn&#x2019;t go away from him, so too must every soul in Israel look to God so as not to be immersed in desires and pleasures. Then one will not, God forbid, forget God, but rather to think of His ways. This is as it is said in the Gemara (<italic>Beitsa</italic>, 11a), &#x201C;a small bird that hops will not hop far from the nest,&#x201D; and the community of Israel is likened to a small bird (Gemara <italic>Shabbat</italic>, 130a).</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;[Guard yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of Hashem your God, which He has made with you,] and you make any graven image, even the likeness of anything of which Hashem your God has commanded you.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 4:23)</p>
<p>This means not to give credence to any external surface appearance,<sup><xref rid="fn322">7</xref></sup> even concerning the <italic>Mitzvot</italic>, which God has commanded you, as is discussed in the holy Zohar. This is what is meant by (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 4:16) &#x201C;likeness of male,&#x201D; which refers to the (248) positive commandments, and &#x201C;likeness of female,&#x201D; which refers to the (365) negative commandments.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And you shall know this day and take into your heart that Hashem is Elokim [in the heavens above and in the earth below, there is none other].&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 4:39)</p>
<p>This statement is juxtaposed to the section discussing the cities of refuge<sup><xref rid="fn323">8</xref></sup> (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 4:41), &#x201C;thus Moshe separated,&#x201D; etc. Concerning this it is written in the Midrash (<italic>Devarim</italic> Rabba, 2:19), &#x201C;For Moshe Rabeynu crowned the Holy One, blessed be He, even in the empty spaces of the world [air, sky, cosmos].&#x201D; &#x201C;There is none other&#x201D; is true even in space. This is why this verse is juxtaposed to the discussion of the cities of refuge, as it was the portion of Moshe Rabeynu to make known that the blessed God rules even in the air, and nothing happens outside of His will. In this he made a shield of defense for one who acts unintentionally&#x2014;for how could the axe, slipping from the hand of its owner, cut a path through the air and kill another, if not according to the will of God? And so it is with all unintentional acts.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Not with our fathers did God make this covenant, but with us, [we who are here, all alive, today].&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 5:3)</p>
<p>The blessed God desires that His request to serve Him should go out among the living, for those who have passed into the world to come have already completed what they needed to.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Hear O Israel, Hashem is our God &#x2026; And you shall love Hashem your God &#x2026; And it shall be when God shall bring you into the land .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 6:4&#x2013;5, 7:1)</p>
<p>Concerning the progression of these verses, we learn that a man must refine himself in all his affairs in five areas (based on the following five verses). &#x201C;Hear O Israel&#x201D; means that a man must see that everything is in the hands of God, and that He is One. &#x201C;And you shall love&#x201D; means that one must be able to abandon all the pleasures of this world for the love of the blessed God. &#x201C;And it shall be when God shall bring you&#x201D; means service, that a man must serve God with all his soul, as it is written, &#x201C;and He you shall serve [<italic>Devarim</italic>, 6:13],&#x201D; and as it written there, &#x201C;houses filled with all good things.&#x201D; (No matter how much wealth and comfort one has) he shall not forget to serve God.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Do not test God [<italic>Devarim</italic>, 6:16]&#x201D; relates to once one has already refined himself in these three areas, then when God bestows good upon him, he shall not fear and be uncertain that maybe this will not be for his well-being. This is as &#x201C;Do not test God&#x201D; continues, &#x201C;as you did at Massa.&#x201D; In the incident at Massa (<italic>Shemot</italic>, 17:7), when the people complained for water, it says, &#x201C;is God among us or not?&#x201D; (Not to do this, but rather) to trust that indeed God is giving with a good eye. &#x201C;Do not show them mercy [when you eradicate the nations from the land (<italic>Devarim</italic> 7:2])&#x201D; means not to be enamored of anyone who hates God. This is as it is written (<italic>Eruvin</italic>, 21a), &#x201C;Until Zechariya ben Edo came and explained it, there was just one in every three thousand two hundred who [understood] the Torah.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Three thousand&#x201D; corresponds to the first three verses: &#x201C;Hear,&#x201D; &#x201C;And you shall love,&#x201D; &#x201C;And when He shall bring you.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn324">9</xref></sup> &#x201C;Two hundred&#x201D; corresponds to &#x201C;do not test,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Show no mercy.&#x201D; Zechariya managed to uphold these words of Torah (the above five stages of refinement) after his father Edo the prophet had first failed in them when he ate with the false prophet (see the whole story in Kings 1, Ch. 13). Edo truly had a reason to rely upon when he decided to eat with him, for after God told him not to eat, he had absolutely no desire to eat. This is because his heart was pure enough that after he was warned he had no appetite. Then when the false prophet came to him and offered him food he was immediately hungry. With this he had proof that the matter was from God, for when two opinions agree with each other, then it is clearly the will of God. Similarly Yirmiya had put his trust in this as is explained on the verse &#x201C;Molten images&#x201D; (Mei HaShiloach <italic>Parshat Mishpatim</italic>). But he had to understand that all his desire was only that which the false prophet had awakened in him, and after this incident a law was renewed that one may only learn a Torah law from someone he knows. In this way his son managed to uphold these words of Torah.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And you shall love Hashem your God with all your heart, and all your soul, and all your possessions.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 6:5)</p>
<p>(This is in the first section of the <italic>Shema.</italic> And in the second section,) &#x201C;And it will be, if you will surely hearken&#x201D; (it says, &#x201C;all your hearts, and all your souls&#x201D;) but it does not say &#x201C;and all your possessions.&#x201D; For &#x201C;your possessions&#x201D; is literally &#x201C;your <italic>much</italic>.&#x201D; This means to be so greatly (much) willing to deliver over your whole life for the sanctity of God&#x2019;s name, even if this means sacrificing your life in the world to come.<sup><xref rid="fn325">10</xref></sup> Yet this is all only before it is entirely clear to a person his portion connected to him at the root of his soul. For everyone has a particular mitzvah that by fulfilling he thereby achieves the world to come, and according to this mitzvah and its fulfillment is the essence of that person&#x2019;s whole existence. Before one&#x2019;s portion is clear to him, he must serve God in such a way that there is nothing that he would not give over to sanctify God (&#x201C;and all your <italic>muchness</italic>&#x201D;). Yet after it is clear what his portion (and particular mitzvah) is, God no longer wants him to serve in the previous manner, for God does not want to take away from him this quality for which he had been suited. From man&#x2019;s point of view even though he is only required to give his life for the three prohibitions of idolatry, incest, and murder, yet for the particular mitzvah known to him connected to him at the root of his soul he must give his life to fulfill it. This is reminiscent of Daniel who was willing to give his life to stand and pray, though he was not required as such by the law. Similarly Mordechai would not humble himself before Haman, which would have been a small price to save his life. Yet they understood that that particular mitzvah was connected to them at the root of their soul, (and worth dying over,) as is explained on the verse, &#x201C;if you happen upon a bird&#x2019;s nest&#x201D; (above in <italic>Parshat Ki Teitse</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn326">11</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And these things which I command you today shall be upon your heart.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 6:6)</p>
<p>It is written in the Gemara (<italic>Pesachim</italic>, 55b), &#x201C;The men of Jericho would &#x2018;wrap&#x2019; the recitation of the <italic>Shema</italic>. This they would say, &#x2018;these things that I command you today shall be upon your heart&#x2019; [without pausing after &#x2018;today,&#x2019; as if to say, &#x2018;today they shall be upon your heart, but not tomorrow.&#x2019; The author will depart from this explanation].&#x201D; Jericho hints at scent.<sup><xref rid="fn327">12</xref></sup> Furthermore, Jericho is called the &#x201C;city of date palms,&#x201D; which means that its inhabitants deeply understood the meaning of dates being the last of the seven species found in Israel (see <italic>Devarim</italic> 8:8). They understood that in the end the words of Torah would be fixed in the hearts of Israel according to the will of the blessed God. Thus they said, &#x201C;<italic>today upon</italic> your hearts,&#x201D; meaning that today the words of Torah are only on your hearts, but tomorrow they will be fixed within your hearts. The sages did not agree with their practice, asserting that it is not within the power of man to hasten the Salvation, unless it happens by the will of the blessed God. Therefore this was only the practice of the men of Jericho because Jericho teaches of scent, as explained, meaning that they would smell the approaching Salvation from afar. Furthermore, it is called &#x201C;the city of date palms&#x201D; (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 34:3) and dates are the last of the seven species, meaning that they looked onto the end of the matter.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;You [plural] shall surely guard the commandments of Hashem your God, and His testimonies and statutes which He has commanded you [singular].&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 6:17)</p>
<p>Why does the verse begin in the plural, &#x201C;You shall surely guard,&#x201D; and then end in the singular, &#x201C;which He has commanded you&#x201D;? God gave the 613 commandments equally to all the people of Israel, and one is just as obligated to fulfill them as another. Yet as for &#x201C;His testimonies,&#x201D; meaning the meaning behind the commandments, each one feels the unique meaning of a commandment that another does not feel, nor does he have the understanding of his fellow. We find an example of this in the Gemara (<italic>Pesachim</italic>, 53b), &#x201C;even though one says to light, and another says not to light, they both had the same intention.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn328">13</xref></sup> For at first it seemed as if one disagreed with the other, yet truly there was no disagreement for they both intended the same thing. Thus one does not call to question the attributes of his fellow, for he understands that his fellow can only keep the mitzvah in his own way, and not in his way. Therefore it says (in verse 19), &#x201C;to cast out all your enemies from before you,&#x201D; which is referring to those involved in fierce disagreements in Israel. Yet the meaning is not that they should be destroyed, God forbid, but rather to cast out their kind of service from before you, so as not to disturb you from your own service.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;When your son asks you in the future, saying, what are the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments which Hashem our God has commanded you?&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 6:20)</p>
<p>What he is really asking is why God chose us in His great love, so therefore you answer him (verse 21), &#x201C;we were slaves.&#x201D; This means that we were downtrodden, and it is the way of the blessed God to dwell in the downtrodden and low of spirit. This is as it is written (Yeshayahu, 57:15), &#x201C;I dwell in a high and holy place, and also with the downtrodden and meek of spirit. I revive the spirit of the lowly and the heart of the downtrodden.&#x201D; And when the blessed God desires to save, He does so with the full greatness of His awesome power.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And it shall be righteousness for us, if we keep the commandments to do them .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 6:25)</p>
<p>The Aramaic translation of &#x201C;righteousness&#x201D; is <italic>Zechuta</italic> (meaning both &#x201C;merit&#x201D; and &#x201C;pure&#x201D;). This means that the blessed God will testify that our actions are pure from the depth of the heart. For a Grentile who gives a coin in charity solely in order that his son will live is called wicked. Yet an Israelite who does this is wholly righteous.<sup><xref rid="fn329">14</xref></sup> This is because the Holy One, blessed be He, testifies that the depths of our hearts are refined according to His will.</p>

<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And it will be, on account of your understanding these judgments [and keep them, and do them, and Hashem Your God will keep the covenant and the loving-kindness which He promised to your forefathers].&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 7:12)</p>
<p>&#x201C;And it will be&#x201D; is always a term denoting <italic>simcha</italic> (joy), as it is said in the Midrash (<italic>Bereshit</italic> Rabba 42:4). The verse says <italic>ekev</italic>, meaning both &#x201C;because of&#x201D; and &#x201C;heel&#x201D;&#x2014;and thus signifies &#x201C;the end.&#x201D; This is in order to show that in the future the blessed God will reveal to each soul in Israel the understanding that no statute or law in the Torah, no matter how inscrutable, was without meaning. At present, all the difficulties that Israel suffers over the fulfillment of <italic>mitzvot</italic> are due to an inability to understand the depth of the good contained in the <italic>mitzvot</italic>. It appears to them that these statutes are without meaning, and therefore suffer from them. Yet when it becomes perfectly clear that everything was done in justice for the benefit of Israel and was not without meaning, &#x201C;then our mouths will be filled with laughter,&#x201D; (Tehillim, 126:2) and we will be in a state of <italic>simcha.</italic></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And it will be, on account of .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 7:12)</p>
<p>It is said in the Midrash (<italic>Devarim</italic> Rabba, 3:1), &#x201C;What is the law for a man of Israel who has a lamp that separates into parts, may he carry it on Shabbat? Our rabbis taught that if he assembles it he is liable for the prohibition of building on Shabbat.&#x201D; What is the point of this law being taught precisely here (at the beginning of the Midrash on <italic>Parshat Ekev</italic>)? The matter is, that carrying such a lamp was prohibited on Shabbat from the suspicion of building, for even if the branches were joined together quite loosely they feared that they might become more strongly connected through the very motion of carrying, and he would thus be building. Since there was no precise measurement given as to how much one would have to build to be liable for building, even the smallest amount was forbidden, and with this it is impossible to be precise. Consequently one may, God forbid, accuse the blessed God of being tyrannical with His creation, giving commandments that are impossible for them to perform.</p>
<p>Therefore the Midrash follows immediately with, &#x201C;How did Israel keep the Shabbat when it was first given to them in Alush, where it says, &#x2018;and the nation rested on the seventh day&#x2019; (<italic>Shemot</italic>, 16:30)? Perhaps they would say that for your detriment was Shabbat given to you, when it was only given for your good.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This was in order to show that even the fulfillment of the <italic>mitzvot</italic> is in the hands of God, for He gives man the power that he needs to fulfill them. In the frail mortal intellect it is impossible to understand how Israel kept the first Shabbat in all its details, to which they were completely unaccustomed to (as they were immersed in slavery), immediately, the first time. All of Israel did not transgress even the minutiae of Shabbat, and the verse testifies to this. In this is proof that the blessed God completes us and prepares all of our actions for our welfare. This is, &#x201C;And it will be, because you surely hearkened &#x2026;&#x201D; (<italic>ekev</italic>, meaning both &#x201C;because&#x201D; and &#x201C;heel&#x201D; thus signifying the end), because at the end God sees that all of Israel went after His holy will.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; the increase of your kine .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 7:13)</p>
<p>This means a place where a man does something he is not conscious of, unintentionally. Here too the Holy One, blessed be He, will agree that it is good.<sup><xref rid="fn330">15</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;If you say in your hearts, these nations are more powerful than I, how shall I inherit them? Do not fear them, remember well what Hashem your God did to Pharaoh and all of Egypt.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 7:17&#x2013;18)</p>
<p>How is it possible to warn of something that happens of its own accord without the input of man&#x2019;s will, and command concerning it, &#x201C;be not afraid?&#x201D; Will not the heart fear it anyway (as it is out of our hands)? Yet we find that the contents of a man&#x2019;s heart is known through his actions, and by means of the <italic>mitzvot</italic> the depth of his heart will become clear. For example, one who does not rule over his peer even though it is within his power to do so, from this we see that he fears God. If he adorns the commandments &#x201C;<italic>hiddur</italic> mitzvah,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn331">16</xref></sup> to a high degree, as our sages have said (<italic>Baba Kama</italic>, 9b), this is proof that he loves God from the depth of his heart, and not superficially. Similarly here the blessed God warned of the necessity to remove illusion from the heart of Israel. Truly the heart of Israel contains a special power, so it is necessary to remove the illusion from their heart, for in truth God does not desire that we fear anything illusory. This is as it is written (Yesahya, 45:19), &#x201C;I have not said to the seed of Jacob, &#x2018;seek me in <italic>tohu</italic>&#x2019; [chaos, baseless void].&#x201D; <italic>Tohu</italic> means the fear of the illusory, and a man must know that there is a force running the world, and He wants His creations to be of a calm mind. That which He warned here, &#x201C;do not fear them&#x201D; means not to fear the superficial (the illusions of the surface), as is explained on the verse, &#x201C;when you see the horse and chariots, and the powerful people&#x201D; (Mei HaShiloach <italic>Parshat Shoftim</italic>).</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Guard yourselves, lest you forget Hashem your God to not keep His commandments &#x2026; lest you eat and are satisfied and build good houses &#x2026; and you say in your heart, &#x2018;my power and the strength of my hand has made for me this wealth.&#x2019; And you shall remember Hashem your God for He is the one who gives you power .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 8:11&#x2013;18)</p>
<p>In <italic>Parshat Va&#x2019;etchanan</italic> it said the opposite of this matter. There it said, &#x201C;and it shall be when He shall bring you &#x2026; to give you great and good cities which you have not built, vineyards which you did not plant &#x2026; guard yourselves lest you forget &#x2026; fear Hashem your God, serve Him,&#x201D; etc. (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 6:10&#x2013;13). There it teaches of a time when one sees that goodness has been bestowed upon him by God, and it appears to him that all this God-given abundance will come to him without any effort. Then, lest he think that he does not have to serve or fear God, it says, &#x201C;fear Hashem your God and serve Him&#x201D; (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 6:13). But here it is the opposite, for when one builds houses, plants fields, and succeeds, it may seem to him that his own power and strength effected this. Therefore it says, &#x201C;and you shall remember Hashem your God for He is the one who gives you power,&#x201D; for without the will of the blessed God the actions of man are nothing. This is also the case with great situations when God gives abundance to man without his effort and it seems that he does not need the service of God. Concerning this it said, &#x201C;fear Hashem your God,&#x201D; for God does not give for free. He will only bestow it upon you for the prayer and service within you, and will give to you according to this.</p>
<p>And if one says that he will serve God by himself based on his own power, without the assistance of the blessed God, for this it says, &#x201C;remember Hashem your God for He is the one giving you strength.&#x201D; This means that all the power we have for prayer and <italic>avodat Hashem</italic> (service of the Divine) is coming from the blessed God, as it is written (Tehillim, 10:17), &#x201C;You prepare their heart, You cause Your ear to hear.&#x201D; For surely God has arranged the mitzvah for you without your own awareness, and &#x201C;one mitzvah draws another mitzvah&#x201D; (<italic>Pirkei Avot</italic>, 4:2). By means of this the power for <italic>avodah</italic> (Divine service) exists permanently within your heart. Since this <italic>avodah</italic> has been fixed in your heart He will bestow goodness upon you.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;You shall not say, when Hashem your God casts them out before you, that for because of my own righteousness let me inherit this land, rather because of the wickedness of these nations does He drive them out from before you.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 9:4)</p>
<p>At the beginning of this statement it seems as if it is also not because of the evil of the nations that He is giving you the land, but at the end it says, &#x201C;because of the wickedness of the nations.&#x201D; Truly God has chosen Israel even regardless of their actions. This is as it is written (Malachi, 1:2), &#x201C;is not Eisav a brother to Yaakov?&#x201D; Also in Egypt there were accusations pointed at Israel. This is as it is written in the Midrash (<italic>Vayikra</italic> Rabba, 21:4), &#x201C;The angels of the nations of the world came to accuse against Israel before the Holy One, blessed be He, saying, &#x2018;Master of the Universe, these are idolaters and these are idolaters, these are incestuous and these are incestuous, these are murderers and these are murderers&#x0021;&#x2019;&#x201D; Nonetheless, God chose Israel because at their depths and at their roots they are a portion of God from on high, as it is written (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 32:9), &#x201C;His people are a portion of God.&#x201D;</p>
<p>One could assert that when the blessed God commanded us to eradicate the seven nations that He was telling us to act with rampant cruelty, God forbid. But we also see that the Holy One, blessed be He, hates the nations precisely because of their cruelty. From this matter it is seen that what is evil among the nations becomes good with Israel, for the blessed God testifies that it is all done from His will. This is the explanation of &#x201C;for because of the wickedness of the nations&#x201D; (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 9:5). Because of this very matter, that with Me they are called evil and doers of evil, in this itself you are called ones who do My will. This is proof that it is not for your righteousness, and not even for the wickedness of the nations, that God brings you into the land. Rather, He desires you regardless of any behavioral criteria. Even though you act as they do, God still desires you. Therefore, &#x201C;for the wickedness of the nation&#x201D; is a term denoting &#x201C;for this reason, because of.&#x201D; From this we understand that purely because you are His portion will God agree to all that you do, and it will be good in His sight.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And now, Israel, what does Hashem your God ask of you but to fear Hashem your God, to go in His ways, and to serve Hashem your God with all your heart and all your soul.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 10:12)</p>
<p>It is written in the Gemara (<italic>Berachot</italic>, 33b), &#x201C;Is the fear of God a small thing? Yes, for Moshe the fear of God is a small thing. It is as if someone is asked for a great object, if he has it, it seems to him like a small object. If he is asked for a small object, and he does not have it, it seems to him like a great object.&#x201D; The words of the Gemara are not clear. Why would the fear of God be compared to a small or great object? Yet truly, the fear of God is likened to bread that gives life to man. So when one is described as being poor, you would say that he does not even have a loaf of bread. But if you describe a rich man, you don&#x2019;t talk about bread, for that is something that everyone needs; rather, you describe how he has all kinds of precious and rare objects that most people do not have. This is what the Gemara means when it says, &#x201C;a great object, and it seems to him like a small object.&#x201D; In describing the man who is complete in all ways, you do not describe his fear of God, because this is the very first level that one must reach. This is as it is written (Tehillim, 111:10), &#x201C;the beginning of wisdom is the fear of God.&#x201D; Yet when you describe a man who is wholly incomplete, you say that he does not even have the fear of God, and then it seems to him like a great object. For this is the principle (for spiritual completeness), as bread is the principle that sustains the life of man.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And you shall love Hashem your God, and keep His charge, and His statutes, and His judgments, and His commandments always &#x2026; and that which He did to Datan and Aviram .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 11:1&#x2013;6)</p>
<p>Here Korach was not mentioned because this section deals with love. Indeed Korach truly had a great love of God and according him his intentions were for the sake of Heaven. They, however, were only interested in their own self-aggrandizement. Furthermore, this <italic>Parsha</italic> will speak of the love of Torah scholars, and one should be willing to give all his wealth to Torah scholars in the will of the blessed God. This is called &#x201C;the <italic>Shmitta</italic> year,&#x201D; the seventh year of release, when one is required to open all his property to all (at least his field and its produce) in honor of God. This is as it is written in the Midrash (<italic>Vayikra</italic> Rabba, 1:1), &#x201C;The mighty in strength that fulfill His word [Tehillim, 103:20]. Of whom does the Torah speak? Rabbi Yitschak said, of those who observe the <italic>Shmitta</italic> [sabbatical] year.&#x201D; Korach had this power, only he asserted that he was the true Torah scholar of his generation, and this is called &#x201C;the price of a whore&#x201D; (see <italic>Devarim</italic>, 23:19), giving in a place where it should not be given. This is not so with Datan and Aviram, who were not at all on this level, but rather acted with pure chutzpa against the blessed God. With them it is called (ibid) &#x201C;the price of a dog.&#x201D; Therefore the verse (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 11:6) &#x201C;and all the substance that was under their feet [in their possession],&#x201D; did not mention Korach, because he was clean in this aspect, but they were not.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And it will be, if you [plural] will surely hearken to My commandments &#x2026; and I shall give you [singular] grass in your field for your animals, and you shall eat and be satisfied.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 11:13&#x2013;15)</p>
<p>This verse begins in the plural voice, and ends in the singular. This is as it is written (Tehillim, 134:3), &#x201C;God will bless you from Zion, the Maker of heaven and earth.&#x201D; At the time of the acceptance of the yoke of the Torah all of Israel were equal, for all want to serve God. Yet with the memorial (<italic>tsion</italic>, in Hebrew, here signifying an impression and effect) that the words of Torah make in the heart of man, meaning when they are instilled in his heart, here there are differences, and one&#x2019;s mind is not similar to his fellow. Thus it is that the reception of reward depends on what is brought in and the impression it makes. Therefore the verse begins in the plural, meaning the acceptance of the yoke of the Torah (if you will surely hearken), for all accept it equally. Afterward, the following verses are discussing the reception of reward, which depends on the impression that is fixed in the heart, so therefore it is written in the singular, for in this one does not resemble his fellow. Therefore it is written in Tehillim (128:5), &#x201C;and you shall see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life.&#x201D; Jerusalem hints at the fear of God.<sup><xref rid="fn332">17</xref></sup> According to the fear of God and the constrictions one goes through to honor the blessed God, accordingly he will receive reward and the blessed God will effuse unto him expansion.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Everywhere your foot shall walk upon is yours .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 11:24)</p>
<p>Everywhere one can receive good without being stubborn. You walk upon it from above and consider whether or not it is the will of the blessed God. If you find that you cannot easily abandon it, then the blessed God will clearly give it to you as an inheritance. This is as we have explained with the signs of pure animals and birds in <italic>Parshat Shmini</italic>.</p>

<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> R<small>E&#x2019;E</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;See&#x0021; I give before you today a blessing and a curse.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 11:26)</p>
<p>Everything is from God. It is the nature of man to shout and cry out to God, &#x201C;what have You done to me?&#x201D; in a time of his trouble. Yet at the time when He bestows His goodness his eye becomes clouded from seeing that it is from God. Then he says, &#x201C;my power and the strength of my hand has made me this wealth [<italic>Devarim</italic>, 8:17],&#x201D; therefore the blessed God shows him, &#x201C;See&#x0021; I give before you,&#x201D; meaning that everything is from God.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;See&#x0021; I give before you today a blessing and a curse.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 11:26)</p>
<p>This means that each time the Holy One, blessed be He, bestows goodness to man, He dresses it in a garment where it appears on the outside to be the opposite from that goodness. (This is explained in the Mei HaShiloach in <italic>Parshat Korach</italic>, on the verse, &#x201C;and I put my word in his mouth.&#x201D;) In this way man may refine himself by his actions and bring to light the goodness that is at the depths. Then it will be called &#x201C;the toil of his hands.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;The blessing, if you follow .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 11:27)</p>
<p>If man receives good, then he knows with clarity that he has fulfilled the will of the blessed God. If the opposite befalls him, God forbid, then he knows that surely he has transgressed the <italic>mitzvot</italic> of the blessed God, even if it does not seem so on the surface.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Be careful lest you offer your sacrifices in any place that you see. Only in the place that God will choose .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 12:13)</p>
<p>The language of warning is doubled here, saying &#x201C;be careful,&#x201D; and then &#x201C;lest.&#x201D; This is because the sacrifice mentioned is an <italic>olah</italic>, an ascent offering, and it signifies a place where man receives no benefit whatsoever from his action. An <italic>olah</italic> is given completely to God (it is burnt in its entirety), and no benefit is left for the one who offers it. It is forbidden to use (anything one devotes to God) in any other capacity, only for God alone.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Only in the place that God shall choose .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 12:14)</p>
<p>From this we learn the way of prayer, how to pray to God, as it is written in the Gemara (<italic>Berachot</italic>, 28b), &#x201C;direct your heart to the house of the Holy of Holies.&#x201D; When you want to pray, fear from the outset that the matter that you want to pray for is the will of the blessed God. This is the meaning of &#x201C;direct your heart to the house of the Holy of Holies.&#x201D; If your heart is filled with prayer and your lips are filled with its produce, you will know that it is the will of God, and you will understand that the matter is from God. This is explained in the Mei HaShiloach in <italic>Parshat Va&#x2019;etchanan</italic>. In this way King David said (Divrei haYamim 1, 17:25), &#x201C;You have uncovered the ear of Your servant [to hear Your command] &#x2026; therefore Your servant has found it possible to pray.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;When God shall enlarge your borders &#x2026; and you will say, &#x2018;I shall eat meat&#x2019; &#x2026; you shall eat meat according to the desire of your soul .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 12:20)</p>
<p>It is not said that they will go outside of their borders, but only that their borders will become enlarged. In truth, God&#x2019;s name, <italic>Hava&#x2019;ye</italic>, known as the Tetragrammaton, (YHVH) signifies the side of the blessed God that has chosen Israel, has no borders, and permits one to extend freely in all the (Divinely given) goodness. However, from the name Adon-ai, meaning man&#x2019;s understanding and the limit of his apprehension, we derive all borders, knowing &#x201C;until here it is permitted to expand&#x201D; and &#x201C;from here on it is forbidden.&#x201D; This means that according to the amount of strength one finds to serve God may he extend himself in God&#x2019;s goodness. This is the meaning of &#x201C;when God shall enlarge your borders.&#x201D; That is, when one first enters into <italic>avodat Hashem</italic> (service of God) it is forbidden to extend himself freely, for if he goes too far he may, God forbid, remove himself from the fear of God. Yet when his strength for <italic>avodat Hashem</italic> increases, and with it his fear of God, then he may extend himself further than his level of <italic>avodah</italic>. This is the meaning of &#x201C;when God shall enlarge your borders,&#x201D; meaning that He will give you such great strength for <italic>avodah</italic> until all (previously constricted) borders will be removed from you to the extent that you may also eat meat without surpassing your boundaries.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t keep anything of that which has been banned [the property of a town that served idols that is to be destroyed] in order that God may turn from His wrath, and give you compassion, and be compassionate with you, and increase you, as He promised to your forefathers.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 13:18)</p>
<p>In the discussion of the town condemned for serving idolatry we are commanded to kill the entire city. This bears the appearance of extreme cruelty. Therefore it says, &#x201C;and give you compassion, and be compassionate with you,&#x201D; for by means of fulfilling the commandment of God you will come to internalize the attribute of compassion, and you will show compassion in a place where compassion is due.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;You shall surely tithe all the produce of your seed, that which comes out of the field from year to year. And you shall eat before Hashem your God in the place where He chooses for His name to dwell, the tithes of your grain, corn, and oil, and the firstlings of your cattle and sheep, in order that you shall learn to fear Hashem your God for all time.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 14:22-23)</p>
<p>From the action of eating in this way, the fear of God will come to the heart of man. Aman&#x2019;s mind is at repose when he is in his own place, but when he is in a foreign place his mind is unsettled. Thus the Holy One, blessed be He, warns against making any separation or difference in a man&#x2019;s mind, but only to be drawn after the will of the blessed God in every place, with his complete consciousness.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Count for yourself seven weeks, from the time the sickle is first put to the standing corn shall you begin to count seven weeks.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 16:9)</p>
<p>&#x201C;From the time the sickle is first put to the standing corn.&#x201D; That is to say, at a time when man begins to march on toward victory he must possess a settled mind and make careful deliberations, for seven weeks represents great refinement. This is as it is written (Tehillim, 12:7), &#x201C;seven times refined.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And you shall rejoice before Hashem your God, you and sons and daughters and servants, and the Levi who is within your gates, and the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow who are among you, in the place that Hashem your God chooses to cause his name to dwell there.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 16:11)</p>
<p>With all the other festivals it is written, &#x201C;within your gates,&#x201D; (<italic>Devarim</italic> 16:5, 14) and here, with Shevuot, the words &#x201C;who are among you&#x201D; are added. This is because it is said of Shevuot, meaning the giving of the Torah (<italic>Nedarim</italic>, 81a), &#x201C;be careful regarding the poor, for from them shall go forth the Torah.&#x201D;</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> S<small>HOFTIM</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Judges and officers you shall place for yourself .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 16:18)</p>
<p>A man must consider his ways in all his actions. This is why it then says (in verse 20), &#x201C;so that you shall live,&#x201D; for anything done in the spirit of justice will not be lost, as it says in the Holy Zohar (<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 178a), &#x201C;there is no action or knowledge or account in <italic>sheol</italic> [which is hell, or rather, a state of irrecoverable loss].&#x201D; That is, an action done with careful consideration will not fall into <italic>sheol.</italic> In the beginning of this week&#x2019;s <italic>Parsha</italic> we find six warnings corresponding to the &#x201C;six sides on which thought depends.<sup><xref rid="fn333">18</xref></sup> They are 1) Judges and officers, 2) Do not plant an asheira tree near the Altar, 3) Do not erect a monument as was practiced by idolaters, 4) Justice, justice, you shall pursue, 5) Do not sacrifice a blemished animal, and 6) The rebellious elder.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Judges and Officers .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 16:18)</p>
<p>This is as it is written (Yesahya, 45:6), &#x201C;Thus spoke God the King of Israel and its Redeemer &#x2026; and besides Me there is no God.&#x201D; This means that all states of elevation come only from the blessed God, and what is said, &#x201C;Judges and officers you shall place for yourself&#x201D; means that a man must subordinate himself before the Judges whom God shall elevate. &#x201C;You shall give for yourself,&#x201D; means that you should subdue yourself before them in the hidden places in your heart. Thus it is with the order of subjects in the <italic>Parsha</italic>, the discussion of the judges or scholars preceding the discussion of the king, the sage coming before the king even though the king is greater than the sage. Yet at the beginning the king is only appointed by the Sanhedrin (Tosefot <italic>Sanhedrin</italic> 83), and afterward the high priest, and afterward the prophet. Yet once the king has been appointed he precedes the scholar, for with the king, all that comes out of his mouth are words of God.</p>
<p>This is as the Gemara explains (<italic>Shabbat</italic>, 56a), that when Uriah the Hitti said something seemingly inconsequential (&#x201C;my master Yoav,&#x201D; disrespecting David&#x2019;s kingship), he was branded an inciter to rebellion, which shows that even though it seemed to be mundane chatter, it was from God. The high priest feels in his understanding how something is the will of the blessed God. With the prophet, at the time when he says, &#x201C;Thus spoke the Lord,&#x201D; all must heed his words, yet when he speaks only from his own knowledge he has the status of a sage.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Judges&#x201D; hints at Moshe Rabeynu, for he was a judge and not a king (Gemara <italic>Zevachim</italic>, 102a). It is explained on the verse (at the burning bush), &#x201C;and He said, do not approach, remove your shoes .&#x2026;&#x201D; (<italic>Shemot</italic>, 3:5), that he was only a king for his own generation and therefore does not receive the title of king. The discussion of the king (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 17:14) hints at King Shlomo, and these two were the paramount of all generations, Moshe was the paramount of all judges, and Shlomo the greatest of all kings. The development of events that Moshe Rabeynu wrote in <italic>Parshat Hazinu</italic>, King Shlomo also wrote in the <italic>Shir haShirim</italic> on a different matter. And there is a difference between them, for they both wrote of the course of events from the beginning to the end of all generations, and at present the Holy One, blessed be He, agrees with Moshe Rabeynu, because the section of judges precedes the section of kings. Yet in the days to come, with the resurrection of the dead, the Holy One, blessed be He, will make it clear that both of them are true. It is a deep matter.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Judges .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic></p>
<p>This means that a man must have justice in his heart to understand what is permitted and what is forbidden. &#x201C;Officers,&#x201D; meaning with the will that when he understands that this is forbidden yet he still wants in his heart to transgress, then He will give to his heart the power of necessity, that he must necessarily follow after his understanding. How so? If he can abandon the transgression owing to his love of the blessed God, very well, and if not, he may contemplate that he will receive some reward in this world for his abstention. &#x201C;In all your gates,&#x201D; meaning desires; &#x201C;for your tribes,&#x201D; meaning all the diverging opinions.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Justice, justice, shall you pursue, that you may live and inherit the land .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 16:20)</p>
<p>This means to be scrupulous with regard to the <italic>mitzvot</italic>. &#x201C;Shall you pursue&#x201D; means you specifically, and not to become angry with you fellow man who is not so scrupulous. &#x201C;That you may live&#x201D; means that by means of this way of conduct you will merit understanding of when to reprove your fellow man.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Judges and officers shall you appoint for yourselves in all your gates .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 16:18)</p>
<p>This is as it is written (Yeshayahu, 33:22), &#x201C;God is our judge, God is our lawgiver, God is our king, He will redeem us.&#x201D; &#x201C;God is our judge,&#x201D; this is what the blessed God illuminates the intellect of man to understand which path would most benefit him to conduct himself according to it. Even though at the beginning his heart is not drawn after the will of the blessed God, anyhow God radiates into him and he will understand in his intellect, and this is &#x201C;God is our judge.&#x201D; &#x201C;God is our lawgiver&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn334">19</xref></sup> means that God carves the desire into the heart of man. From this he begins to ask for advice on how to conduct himself according to the words of Torah, for he understands that there is no other path before him, even seeing that in this world no path would benefit him save the way of the Torah. &#x201C;God is our king&#x201D; means that God conducts the will of man according to His will, may it be blessed, even without man realizing it.</p>
<p>When one first enters into the words of Torah it seems to him that he does so in order to attain an understanding of the sublime. Then afterward he realizes that without the Torah he may not even reconcile the most simple matters. &#x201C;He will redeem us,&#x201D; means that in the end the blessed God will show man that all the ways He dealt with him were only for his good. He shows him that man did not remove himself from God&#x2019;s will even when he acted without thinking, for the blessed God will immediately rule over all the powers that are not in the control of man, like sight and hearing. On this it is said (<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 23:22), &#x201C;He has the power of the horned beast,&#x201D; meaning, God alone will control the powers that are beyond the control of man.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; give yourself .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 16:18)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Give yourself&#x201D; in the depth of the consciousness of man, according to what he shall understand based on his wisdom, to this he must go on and add a further understanding. For with the blessed God there is a depth far deeper than his understanding, as it says in the Gemara (<italic>Shabbat</italic>, 10a), &#x201C;every judge who makes a judgment that is true to the deepest level of truth is made a partner with God in the work of creation.&#x201D; There are judgments that are true but not on all levels of truth. For example, one who denies the crime and is deemed exempt (because of a lack of evidence, a lack of reliable witnesses, and the like), though it could be that though he denied everything he was in reality guilty, yet (to the limit of the judge&#x2019;s knowledge) he was innocent. This is a true judgment, yet because he was guilty the judgment was not true on all levels. On this it must be understood that it is not in the natural ability of man to know this, and only one who has assistance from the Divine will not fall into a judgment that is not true in its deepest form.</p>
<p>An example is the &#x201C;cane of Rava.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn335">20</xref></sup> &#x201C;At that moment the matter was revealed that the debt had been settled,&#x201D; and this could not be known by man&#x2019;s knowledge, but only with Divine assistance. Therefore it is forbidden to bring judgments to Gentile courts, because even though they may judge true judgments, they do not have the special Divine assistance to judge on the deepest level of truth. As we find in the Gemara of <italic>Rosh Hashana</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn336">21</xref></sup> that even though Raban Gamliel called him &#x201C;my teacher in wisdom,&#x201D; because the judgment was as Rabbi Yehoshua had said, still God had agreed with Rabban Gamliel, for he was the <italic>Nasi</italic> (leader) from the edict of God. In saying, &#x201C;my student because you have accepted my word,&#x201D; he meant that in the understanding of the heart he was the one who intends the depth of the knowledge of the blessed God.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Judges and officers shall you place for yourselves in all your gates that Hashem your God gives to you, for your tribes, and you shall judge to people judgments or righteousness.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 16:18)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Your gates&#x201D; means to make judges in general and in particular, in every state and every city, and in every person&#x2019;s soul. &#x201C;Your gates&#x201D; are the seven gates in the soul by which a man receives good: the two eyes, the two ears, the two nostrils,<sup><xref rid="fn337">22</xref></sup> and the mouth. A man must make a great reckoning for every gate through which he receives good, and in a place where man influences others he must make an even greater reckoning. &#x201C;For your tribes&#x201D; means the twelve powers in man with which he can influence others. Among them there are revealed powers, and among them are hidden powers. The two arms, the two legs, and the torso are the revealed powers. The liver, gallbladder, spleen, intestines, and two kidneys are the hidden powers. The liver, which gives way to anger, must incur judgment in order to be angry only if it is the will of the blessed God. The spleen, which laughs, must incur judgment in order not to deride, and so for all of them.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Judges and officers .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic></p>
<p>These are the details of the law, as mentioned in <italic>Pirkei Avot</italic>. It is very difficult for one to fulfill them, for &#x201C;one can only uphold the Torah if he has failed in it.&#x201D; In order to understand with wisdom, the truth in justice must be clean regarding the four elements found in man. (The four elements are hinted at in the four statements at the beginning of this <italic>Parsha</italic>.) &#x201C;Do not pervert justice,&#x201D; this means that one must not possess any affliction. For this, one must be stripped of desire, which corresponds to the element of water, as mentioned in several places.<sup><xref rid="fn338">23</xref></sup> &#x201C;Do not recognize faces,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn339">24</xref></sup> this is the element of earth, as we find in the Gemara (<italic>Sanhedrin</italic>, 17b), &#x201C;he hid his face in the ground [out of fear],&#x201D; meaning that he was in a state of heaviness without the alacrity to say to the plaintiff, &#x201C;stand on your feet&#x0021;&#x201D; &#x201C;Do not accept a bribe&#x201D; is the element of air, for it makes him comfortable, like the lungs, which bring the air down to cool the heart and give it rest. This is so even if he judges in truth, for as for lies it is said, &#x201C;do not pervert justice.&#x201D; &#x201C;Justice, Justice,&#x201D; this is the element of fire, which destroys the other elements and does not let them spread and become powerful. &#x201C;That you may live,&#x201D; by means of this you will come to the source of life, &#x201C;and you shall inherit the land,&#x201D; meaning by means of the constriction (following all the above) you will merit increase.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Do not plant an asheira or any tree by the altar of Hashem your God.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 16:21)</p>
<p>Even though one is commanded to be subdued beneath the sage, as is explained above in the event of Rabbi Yehoshua and Raban Gamliel, this applies only in matters of Torah. With prayer, however, it is forbidden to be subdued beneath any outside appearance (honor, power, wisdom), for the altar is a place of prayer and <italic>avodah</italic> (Divine service). This is as it is said in the Gemara, &#x201C;it is forbidden for one to pray behind his rav&#x201D; (<italic>Berachot</italic>, 27b). This means that he should not pray to any appearance, for example, praying for the blessed God&#x2019;s salvation to the ends of being great in Torah like his rav is forbidden. In prayer, one must understand that he is praying to the blessed God who is the source of salvation, that He may save him without boundary or limit, as explained on the verse &#x201C;an ox or a sheep,&#x201D; in <italic>Parshat Emor</italic>.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Do not erect a stone monument.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 16:22)</p>
<p>This means that a man must not be stubborn with anything, even in <italic>avodat Hashem</italic> (Divine service). This is the meaning of (what Rashi commented) that this is so even though it was a beloved way of <italic>avodah</italic> in the days of the Patriarchs. The Patriarchs possessed a special strength, so much that they would lay down their lives for the smallest matter. At that time the <italic>Malchut</italic> (kingship) of the blessed God was not known in the world, and thus it was necessary. Yet now, one only lays down his life for the preservation of the three <italic>mitzvot</italic> that are known (idolatry, incest, and murder). This also hints that one should not be stubborn regarding his peers, so as not to tell him that he must accept his opinion even if it seems that he is right, as is explained in <italic>Parshat Va&#x2019;etchanan</italic> on the verse, &#x201C;you shall surely guard.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Do not sacrifice an ox or sheep that is blemished .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 17:1)</p>
<p>This verse warns concerning prayer, for prayer is connected to the sacrifices.<sup><xref rid="fn340">25</xref></sup> A man should not pray to God when he has a deficiency caused by folly and the like. &#x201C;Ox&#x201D; hints that one should not pray that his neighbor be punished, so as not to deliver his judgment to Heaven, for an ox represents judgment as is known from the writings of the Ari&#x2019;zal. &#x201C;Sheep&#x201D; hints that one should not despise his own life, as in the prayers of Yona and Eliyahu.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Be whole-hearted [upright] with Hashem your God.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 18:13)</p>
<p>The Gemara says (<italic>Nedarim</italic>, 32a), &#x201C;All who are whole-hearted with God, God will be whole-hearted with them.&#x201D; This means, that if a man serves God and has no vanity because of this, only acting with simplicity because he was created, and because the blessed God created him, so it follows that he must serve Him. Then too God will be whole-hearted with him, and when He wants to bestow good upon him, he will not reduce from his tally of merits, but rather He will give as a father to his son.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;You shall surely appoint over yourself a king &#x2026; from among your brethren you shall place over yourself a king .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 17:15)</p>
<p>&#x201C;From among your brethren&#x201D; means that he should have good in his heart for all of Israel. We find this with David haMelech, as it says (Tehillim, 78:70), &#x201C;and He chose David His servant, and he took him from the sheepfolds [a place he used to protect his sheep].&#x201D; When the Holy One, blessed be He, saw how he acted compassionately toward his sheep, He made him king over Israel.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;You shall surely appoint over yourself a king &#x2026; you may not appoint a Gentile [as king] over yourself .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 17:15)</p>
<p>This means (not to appoint) one who has anger within him, for the attribute of anger has no place in Israel.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;When you go forth to war against your enemy, and you see the war horses and chariots and a people more powerful than you, do not fear them, for Hashem your God is with you, who raised you from the land of Egypt.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 20:1)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Horse&#x201D; represents one involved in a fierce controversy like Yaravam. &#x201C;Chariots&#x201D; means that even though you see the difficulty standing before you, it is necessary as a vehicle for the <italic>Shechina</italic>, the Divine Presence. &#x201C;A people more powerful than you,&#x201D; meaning like Rechavoam against the eleven tribes, concerning which David haMelech said (Tehillim, 27:3), &#x201C;even if a host shall encamp against me, my heart will not fear.&#x201D; Similarly, the Holy One, blessed be He, says, &#x201C;do not fear them.&#x201D; We find this theme in the incident of Achiya haShiloni anointing Yaravam as king. Achiya was from Shiloh, and from the tribe of Yosef. Of Yaravam it is written (Melachim 1, 11:26), <italic>efrati</italic> (&#x201C;from Efrat,&#x201D; as sign of being from Yehuda) and he was greatly adorned and warned concerning &#x201C;do not commit adultery,&#x201D; which was the inheritance of Yosef. We do not find this with Yehuda, for of Shlomo it is written (Melachim 1, 3:1), &#x201C;And Shlomo pleaded with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he took Pharaoh&#x2019;s daughter,&#x201D; and of David haMelech it is written (Shmuel 1, 17:2), &#x201C;son of an Efrati man.&#x201D;</p>
<p>For this reason it was correct in Achiya&#x2019;s eyes to anoint him. Then afterward, when he sinned with the two golden calves, and Achiya prayed over this mistake, the blessed God then showed him that this love was only for Aviya the son of Yaravam, and it contained something good. (See Melachim 1, 14:13, &#x201C;yet still something good was found in the house of Yaravam.&#x201D;) For this, from the time that he anointed Yaravam, until the time it said &#x201C;and the child died,&#x201D; when the word of God is being spoken it does not call Achiya by the name of prophet or the Shiloni, but simply Achiya. But in this section (Melachim 1: 14:18), it says, &#x201C;according to the word of God through Achiya the prophet.&#x201D; For God had established this, and understand.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;When you come to the land &#x2026; I will place a king over me like all the nations .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 17:14)</p>
<p>On this it is said in the holy Zohar (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 12a), &#x201C;[the other nations were each suited to an angel], and he asked, &#x2018;where did he place Israel?&#x2019; and he answered, &#x2018;God placed them in the firmament of the heavens.&#x2019; [They are only connected to God.]&#x201D; This is saying that all the other nations give appearance from the good with which they serve, for which they are given ministering angels, and from this they experience fear. Israel, on the other hand, is completely without surface appearances. This is why it says &#x201C;I will place over me a king,&#x201D; where by means of him we will don an appearance.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;When you come to the land &#x2026; I will place a king over me like all the nations .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 17:14)</p>
<p>&#x201C;King&#x201D; means the sudden, brazen power of <italic>Kedusha</italic> (<italic>tekifut</italic>)<sup><xref rid="fn341">26</xref></sup> and spreading forth. Israel asks to spread forth into all the desire of their heart, without any great need for boundaries and fences. This is why the king is supposed to be &#x201C;from among your brethren,&#x201D; meaning that they should look at who is giving, and in doing this they are permitted to spread forth in all the delights of this world, yet all shall be in a state of <italic>Kedusha</italic>.</p>

<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;When you go out to war against your enemy &#x2026; and you take them captive .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 21:10)</p>
<p>(What is taken captive is) the good that exists in that nation. In each nation exists a good power, yet all the while it is among them it is in captivity. Then when it is brought into Israel it becomes good in its completeness. The good that exists with them is the desire. Any real power in that good is only temporary, yet the desire that is with them comes from the understanding that the power is lacking in completeness and must be entered into Israel. Thus, all the while that the desire is among them it is in captivity, for the power of desire comes only from the blessed God, and does not pertain to them, only to Israel.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and you desire her, and take her for a wife, and bring her home &#x2026; and shave her head &#x2026; and remove her garment of captivity from her .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 21:11&#x2013;13)</p>
<p>In truth, everything that is pleasing in the eyes of Israel surely must have something good in it. Then afterward, one must undergo a process of clarification to determine if what is pleasing is an external appearance and not true beauty. This is the commandment (to remove her hair and enticing garments) to remove all external appearances. If she is then still pleasing in his eyes, then surely she contains something good.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and you see among the captives .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 21:11)</p>
<p>The Gemara says on this (<italic>Kiddushin</italic>, 21b), &#x201C;The Torah only speaks here according to the <italic>yetser hara</italic> [inclination to evil].&#x201D; That the Torah permitted an outlet for the <italic>yetser hara</italic> is something that we find nowhere else (in the Torah). Yet there are times when we find that a man&#x2019;s <italic>yetser hara</italic> overpowers him until he cannot move at all, and then it is clear that this state came from God, as we find with Yehuda. The Torah revealed this so that someone caught in this state would not become depressed.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 21:18)</p>
<p>Consider the order of these matters. First desire consumed the heart of the man to take a woman of the war captives for a wife, and surely it seemed to him that her actions were good, for we are not dealing with foolishness. Then afterward he comes to hate her on sight, for her actions are not at all what he thought they were, and he hates her greatly, and is disturbed in his heart wondering where his initial desire to take her came from. So he consoles himself, saying, maybe a good son will be born from her. Then he sees that the son born to them is stubborn and rebellious, and they bring him to the court of law, and kill him. Then pain and mercy fill his heart over his executed son, for he was innocent, as it says in the Gemara (<italic>Sanhedrin</italic>, 72a), &#x201C;He will be killed for eating a tartemar of meat and drinking a half log of wine.&#x201D; He becomes increasingly disturbed from the series of events that passed over him. Therefore the very next verse is &#x201C;for he who incurred the death penalty &#x2026; do not let the corpse of the hang overnight &#x2026; for God hates that which is hanged&#x201D; (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 21:23).</p>
<p>In this God is consoling the conscience of his father, telling him that surely there was something good in him, or else the blessed God would not be so careful as to not let him hang the body overnight. From this it is apparent that he is not like an inanimate thing; rather, there was something good in him that only needed to be clarified. Thus the desire of the father to take the mother was not in vain. Following after is the section dealing with returning a lost object. This shows how with the blessed God there is a fixing for everything, so that any desire and any action done among Israel would not be lost to irrecoverable exile, and all is done with God&#x2019;s involvement (<italic>hashgacha</italic>). That he took the mother was from the desire for the good in her, and his hate for his son was only for the evil in him, and his execution was not in vain for in this it becomes clear that he was innocent.<sup><xref rid="fn342">27</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;If you come upon a bird&#x2019;s nest &#x2026; you shall surely send away the mother bird, and the chicks you may take for yourself .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 22:7)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mother&#x201D; means the principles of the words of Torah, for one must always examine himself according to the principles of the Torah. As it says in the Holy Zohar (<italic>Shemot</italic>, 200a), &#x201C;there are three points to the Torah.&#x201D; This means that he should clarify that none of his actions should have anything in the slightest way against the blessed God, against the community of Israel, and against the man himself (as was explained earlier in <italic>Parshat Kedoshim</italic> on the verse, &#x201C;his mother and father a man shall fear&#x201D;). A man must conduct all his affairs according to the principles, and these principles require that he shall not lay down his life for anything except the three known <italic>mitzvot</italic> (incest, idolatry, and murder). However, the mitzvah of sending away the mother bird (the principles) teaches of a place where a man knows for certain that a particular mitzvah is connected to him at the root of his soul. In such a case he must give his life for its preservation even if it is a &#x201C;minor&#x201D; mitzvah. &#x201C;You shall surely send away the mother&#x201D; hints at this, meaning that at this time one need not heed the above principle, yet to go ahead and lay down his life. We find examples of this in Daniel who was ready to give his life for prayer, with Mordechai who would give his life not to bow down to Haman, and with Rabbi Akiva who gave his life for ritual handwashing.</p>
<p>Although these were not according to the principles of the words of Torah, each one understood that that particular mitzvah was connected to him at the root of his soul. For everyone has a particular mitzvah deeply connected to him as is explained in various places, and this is the meaning of &#x201C;and the chicks you may take for yourself,&#x201D; meaning that in this case only to heed the understanding of your heart. This is as the sages said (<italic>Chullin</italic>, 139a), &#x201C;&#x2018;If you happen upon the bird&#x2019;s nest,&#x2019; only applies if you come upon it without premeditation, for it is forbidden to fashion for yourself this mitzvah [climbing trees, houses,] for you would be putting yourself in danger.&#x201D; Only if you happen upon such a case, yet do not prepare it. As is explained in the Gemara (Mishna, <italic>Brachot</italic>, 33b), &#x201C;[If the prayer leader says in the <italic>tachanun</italic> section of supplication, &#x2018;just as you had mercy on the mother bird] by the bird&#x2019;s nest so may your mercy arrive,&#x2019; [you must silence him].&#x201D; (And this is the <italic>Halacha</italic>.) For it is in the power of the blessed God to save so that man doesn&#x2019;t need even this, as is explained earlier on the verse, &#x201C;An ox or sheep, do not slaughter it and its offspring on the same day&#x201D; (<italic>Parshat Emor</italic>).</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;You shall surely send away the mother bird, and take the chicks for yourself.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 22:7)</p>
<p>The Gemara says that there are two <italic>mitzvot</italic> where the Holy One, blessed be He, explained the giving of their reward; one is the easiest of the easy, and one is the most difficult of the difficult (<italic>Chullin</italic>&#x2019;s explanation of sending away the mother bird). Sending away the mother bird teaches that a man may abandon all the good in this world for the honor of the blessed God. This is called &#x201C;the easiest of the easy,&#x201D; for every soul in Israel is ready to do this. In a place where one abandons a worldly good, in this aspect he is very clean. Respecting parents teaches of a mitzvah where there is a bodily benefit, and this is called &#x201C;the most difficult of the difficult,&#x201D; for in a place where one receives benefit, there it is difficult to remain clean without becoming tainted. Therefore with the sending away of the mother bird it says first, &#x201C;that it may be good for you,&#x201D; and afterward, &#x201C;and lengthen our days.&#x201D; This is because here it seems as if he is abandoning all the good of this world, so God stresses, saying first, &#x201C;that it may be good for you.&#x201D; This is certain, for one will understand this, and in addition He promises the length of days. With honoring parents it says first &#x201C;that it may lengthen your days&#x201D; and afterward &#x201C;and that it may be good for you.&#x201D; This means that even though you benefit from this in this world, it will also be good for you in the future.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;When you go out to make a war encampment against your enemy, and you shall guard yourself from everything evil. If there is a man among you who has become impure from a nocturnal emission, and he shall go outside of the encampment, he shall not enter the encampment.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 23:10&#x2013;11)</p>
<p>This particular stumbling block comes to man from looking into words of Torah that are not his portion. Therefore it says, &#x201C;and he shall go outside of the encampment,&#x201D; to show that this [area of study] was not his place, for he stands in an area outside of it.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;You shall have a place prepared outside of the encampment, and there you shall go outside [to attend to your needs]. And you shall have a shovel among your weapons, and it shall be, when you sit outside, you shall dig therewith, and turn back to cover that which came out of you.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 23:13&#x2013;14)</p>
<p>&#x201C;A prepared place&#x201D; signifies the unbridled strength of <italic>Kedusha</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn343">28</xref></sup> This is a kind of power with which one may surpass his boundaries and from there gather goodness, which he can then enter into <italic>Kedusha</italic>. &#x201C;And you shall have a shovel among your weapons&#x201D; (is related to what is said in the Gemara, <italic>Tamid</italic>, 28a), &#x201C;he who wants to live [or &#x2018;which is the right way a man should choose?&#x2019;], he should seize meticulous integrity [abundant faithfulness].&#x201D; This is the meaning of &#x201C;you shall have a shovel among your weapons,&#x201D; meaning that with all your actions you should proceed with confidence and the strength of <italic>Kedusha</italic>. &#x201C;And it shall be when you sit outside&#x201D; represents a time when a man of Israel does something, God forbid, that is outside of his boundaries. Then, &#x201C;and you shall dig therewith,&#x201D; meaning that it shall be set before you and you shall be ashamed of it. In examining the formulation of this verse, compare it with (lyov, 39:29), &#x201C;from there he seeks his prey&#x201D; (Both &#x201C;dig&#x201D; and &#x201C;seek&#x201D; use the word <italic>chafar</italic>.) &#x201C;And turn back and you shall cover it,&#x201D; means that afterward you are permitted to do the same action (see <italic>Yoma</italic>, 87a). &#x201C;And you shall cover that which came out of you&#x201D; means that the next time you do it you shall be making atonement for the past. We find this with Avraham Avinu (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 25:1), &#x201C;and Avraham went further, and took a wife, and her name was Ketora.&#x201D; After all his trials he was tested another time concerning Hagar, and it was made clear that even the first time it was from the will of the blessed God.</p>
<p>This is as we find in the Gemara (<italic>Shabbat</italic>, 49a) with the incident of Elisha the master of wings. At that time the Romans passed an edict that anyone found wearing <italic>tefillin</italic> would have their brain pierced by the authorities. Elisha went out in the marketplace wearing his <italic>tefillin</italic>, and a commissar spotted him. He was chased, and just before he was apprehended he took off his <italic>tefillin</italic> and put them in his hands. The commissar ordered him to open his hands, and when he did so, they contained the wings of a dove. He first went outside in his <italic>tefillin</italic> because he had confidence that surely no one could do him any harm, since he was fulfilling the commandment of the blessed God. Then when the commissar caught him, he also trusted that God would not let harm befall him, so he did not bring angry complaints against God&#x2019;s attribute of judgment, for God sent him confidence even then. Therefore he was answered, for he found the wings of a dove in his hands. This means that he put himself in a position where he would be enticed by the blessed God, as it is written (Hoshea, 7:11), &#x201C;a tempted dove.&#x201D; The miracle he experienced made it clear that when he first went outside wearing <italic>tefillin</italic> it was only a result of the unbridled strength that the blessed God had sent him, and by means of it he was saved.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;When two men are fighting, one with another, and the wife of one draws near to save her husband from being hit, and she sends forth her hand, and grabs him by his shame [secrets].&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 25:11)</p>
<p>This hints at a situation where a man shames his fellow by making the deficiency within him public. This is why the verse says &#x201C;and grabs him by his shame,&#x201D; meaning something that he is ashamed of. Thus with the penalty, in the next verse, it is written, &#x201C;then you shall cut off her hand,&#x201D; meaning that by shaming his friend he will lose all his merits, for hand signifies the right hand, or one&#x2019;s power (<italic>Menachot</italic>, 9b, and hence merits).</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Remember what Amalek did to you, on the way when you were leaving Egypt.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 25:17)</p>
<p>It is written in the Midrash (Tanchuma, <italic>Ki Teitsei</italic>, 7), &#x201C;here it says, remember, and with Shabbat it says, remember. This is understood by means of a parable. A king prepared a feast. When the tray was brought before him filled with all manner of delicacies, he said, &#x2018;remember this one who loved me.&#x2019; Then when the plate was wiped clean, he said, &#x2018;remember that one who hated me.&#x2019;&#x201D; In the future, when the inclination to evil will be eradicated, then, from the side of man&#x2019;s nature, lust and desire will not be able to exist in the world, as now, when the inclination to evil entices man to sin. Therefore, when it overpowers him, then he shall make the will of the blessed God as the great victorious one.</p>
<p>This is as the holy Zohar explains the verse (Kohollet, 10:1), &#x201C;more precious than wisdom or honor is a little foolishness,&#x201D; &#x201C;thus it is when a man first rests after the hard work of servitude, at first he a strong feeling of rest. Then when he becomes accustomed to it, he does not feel the taste of the rest as at first.&#x201D; Therefore it says &#x201C;remember,&#x201D; for he shall remember each time how, meaning in servitude, and how our inclination to evil overpowered us. From this new desire will come to us each time, and we will be greatly at rest. This is the meaning of &#x201C;when the plate was wiped clean,&#x201D; for all the sins and suffering and controversies that exist among Israel come from the power of Amalek, for he is &#x201C;chief of the nations.&#x201D; This is as it is said (<italic>Shemot</italic>, 17:16), &#x201C;a war of Hashem with Amalek from generation to generation.&#x201D; Then when his strength is nullified, then when we remember his power, we will have new desire.</p>

<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And it shall be when you come into the land &#x2026; and you shall take of all the first fruits of the land .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 26:1)</p>
<p>In this, that man returns the first fruits of the land to the Holy One, blessed be He, he is thereby engaging in a spiritual purification that allows himself to serve God with all his abundance. (As it says in the <italic>Shema</italic>, &#x201C;you shall love Hashem your God &#x2026; with all your abundance.&#x201D;)</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;and you shall place it in a basket .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 26:2)</p>
<p><italic>B&#x2019;teneh</italic>, &#x201C;in a basket&#x201D; is the <italic>gematria</italic> (numerical equivalent) of <italic>mah tov</italic>, &#x201C;how good.&#x201D; (The sum total of the letters both equal 62.) Hinted in this is &#x201C;how good is something at its proper time.&#x201D; It is explained that the basket should be perforated (like a woven straw basket), to show that <italic>tocho c&#x2019;varo</italic>, (see also <italic>Berachot</italic>, 27b) that its insides are like its outsides (meaning honest). This is to show that even when something is intended to be for the sake of Heaven, if its outside appearance is unpleasant, then he will not do it, because its inner nature must be like its outside appearance. This is related to the matter of King David, when he wanted to go with Achish, king of Gat, as explained in <italic>Parshat Lech L&#x2019;cha</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn344">29</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And you will go to the Cohen which will be in those days, and say to him, &#x2018;I have told this day to God .&#x2026;&#x2019; &#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 26:3)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Telling&#x201D; or <italic>hagada</italic> in Hebrew, hints at difficult things.<sup><xref rid="fn345">30</xref></sup> With this he will say difficult things before the <italic>Cohen</italic>. He hints to him that even though the <italic>Cohen</italic> works in the Holy Temple and he works in the fields, nevertheless, when this soul of Israel reaches the place of the Temple and brings <italic>bikkurim</italic>, first-fruit offerings, then it becomes perfectly clear that any place an action, no matter how simple, was done in a state of <italic>Kedusha</italic> (sanctity), it was like the service of the <italic>Cohen</italic>.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And you shall answer and you shall say &#x2026; &#x2018;my father was an Aramean about to perish &#x2026;&#x2019;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 26:5)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Aramean&#x201D; signifies the mistakes and that which is hidden in the world. This jades the mind, for from these things he will continually be in a state of fear and worry. Since this is frequent in the world man&#x2019;s mind is not confident and settled. This is as we find with the sons of Shmuel who erred after greed. Of this the Gemara says (<italic>Shabbat</italic>, 56a), &#x201C;because they wanted to increase the salaries of their teachers and scribes.&#x201D; Truly their intention was for the sake of Heaven, for basically their teachers and scribes were <italic>Tsaddikim</italic>, and they only wanted to create their livelihoods. Nonetheless it says that they erred after greed, because a man cannot guard himself from his mistakes if his intention was not the will of the blessed God. This is &#x201C;my father was an Aramean about to perish.&#x201D; &#x201C;Father&#x201D; is called thought,<sup><xref rid="fn346">31</xref></sup> and by means of the mitzvah of the first fruits (where he makes this declaration) a man will merit being saved from mistakes and need only to look to God in all his actions. This is why he then immediately says (in verse 26:10), &#x201C;[And now I have come with the first fruits of the land] which You have given me, Hashem&#x201D; meaning that he speaks with the blessed God face to face.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;My father was an Aramean about to perish .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 26:5)</p>
<p>The reason the section of the first fruits begins in this way is similar to the following passage in the Gemara (<italic>Berachot</italic>, 34a). &#x201C;In the order of the prayer of the eighteen benedictions, the first three blessings are like a servant who arranges his praise before his master. In the [nine] intermediate blessings he asks for his needs. In the last three he is like one who has received a reward from his master, is dismissed, and must bow before him while leaving.&#x201D; The last three blessings are, so to speak, &#x201C;returning the good.&#x201D; For example, one asked God to grant him wealth. If God helped him and he profited, he must deliver everything back to the blessed God by asking God to teach him what to do with every penny, that it should not be dispensed, God forbid, in a place that is against God&#x2019;s will.</p>
<p>This is the explanation of &#x201C;like one who receives a reward &#x2026; he must bow.&#x201D; This also has to do with the first-fruit offering. When you come into the land and you receive all the good, you must return it to God, that is, to the <italic>Beit HaMikdash</italic>, the Holy Temple, by giving the choice produce to the <italic>Cohen</italic>. In doing this you know that all is still in the hands of the Creator. Yaakov had established this whole practice, for Avraham Avinu served God in the attribute of &#x201C;with all your heart,&#x201D; Yitschok Avinu with &#x201C;all your soul,&#x201D; and Yaakov with the attribute of &#x201C;all your abundance.&#x201D; This means that after receiving all the good, to return it to Him, as Yaakov said, &#x201C;all that you give me I will surely tithe it to You.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Look down from Your holy dwelling, from heaven .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 26:15)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Look down&#x201D; uses the special term <italic>hashkifa</italic>, meaning to look into everyone and not just in general. Every time that the blessed God looks at man individually, then great fear wells up in the heart of man, for before God who may say, &#x201C;my heart has been purified?&#x201D; Only when the blessed God looks at mankind in general is man&#x2019;s heart at ease, as it says (Kings 2, 4:13), &#x201C;I sit among my people.&#x201D; When the blessed God inspects man in general, then one evaluates his fellow man for the good, for each soul is clean in one aspect, as is known. Yet here, even though God looks at each man individually, it is also good. This is because when man brings <italic>trumot</italic> and <italic>maasrot</italic> (tithes), he is coming to God with strength, as it is said in the Midrash (Tanchuma <italic>Tisa</italic> 14), &#x201C;there is no coming to God with strength like when one brings tithes.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn347">32</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;You have praised Hashem this day to be your God &#x2026; God has praised you today .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 26:17)</p>
<p>(First it must be noted that Rashi tells us that the word translated here as &#x201C;praised,&#x201D; <italic>he&#x2019;emarta</italic>, appears nowhere else in the Torah for its meaning to be made clear. He first says it means &#x201C;separated,&#x201D; that we have separated God to be ours from all the strange gods. Then he shows its use in Tehillim 94:4, &#x201C;all the workers of iniquity praise [<italic>yit&#x2019;amru</italic>] themselves,&#x201D; which is closer to the holy Isbitser&#x2019;s rendering of its meaning as &#x201C;elevation.&#x201D;) &#x201C;Praised,&#x201D; in Hebrew <italic>he&#x2019;emarta</italic>, is a term denoting elevation, that a man elevates and prides himself in the blessed God, &#x201C;who is like Hashem our God?&#x201D; &#x201C;God has praised you today&#x201D; means that the blessed God takes pride in Israel, as in &#x201C;Israel in you I will adorn myself&#x201D; (Yesahya, 49:3). <italic>He&#x2019;emarta</italic> is also connected to boasting, as in &#x201C;all the workers of iniquity praise [<italic>yit&#x2019;amru</italic>] themselves,&#x201D; meaning that they boast and say that they are acting with wisdom by sinning, and in opposition to them Israel prides themselves to be the God for you&#x201D; (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 26:17). This means that Israel is drawn after the knowledge of the blessed God just as He will conduct them and negate their knowledge against His. Corresponding to this God prides Himself, as it were, in Israel, as it is written, &#x201C;to be His most beloved treasure,&#x201D; (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 7:6), as He has said to you.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Moshe and the elders commanded &#x2026; and on the day you pass over &#x2026; you shall set up great stones and plaster them &#x2026; and you shall write on the stones a clear explanation .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 27:1&#x2013;8)</p>
<p>On this King David said (Tehillim, 147:18), &#x201C;He sends His word and it melts them, He blows His wind and the waters flow.&#x201D; When he saw that Israel was commanded to write the words of Torah with a clear explanation among the nations, he greatly feared that, God forbid, only among the nations would Israel be able to understand the words of Torah with a clear explanation. Thus when they arrived at the depth of the words, then he said, &#x201C;He sends His word and it melts them, He blows His wind.&#x201D; Thus it was in God&#x2019;s will to improve Israel, as we have matters in Torah that one may uphold only if he first fails in them (<italic>Gittin</italic>, 43a). Therefore the words of Torah were written among the nations in order that they would see and understand that the way of the Torah is good. Nonetheless they could not overpower their inclination to evil, and from them Israel would learn that they need not fail. There they would see how the evil ones are paid back, and on this he said, &#x201C;He sends His word and it melts them,&#x201D; meaning that when the blessed God sends the words of Torah to the nations it causes them to melt and become lost. &#x201C;He blows His wind,&#x201D; means that the water of life will flow to Israel.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And all these blessings will come to you, and overtake you .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 28:2)</p>
<p>You will not revert to your former self. It is the nature of man to change when God causes him to profit, so therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, promised him that the good in the soul of Israel will not, God forbid, be changed by anything.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; And you shall lend to many nations, and you shall not borrow.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 28:12)</p>
<p>You will not need them to come and borrow from you. It is the way of the lender that he is saddened if no one comes to borrow from him, so the Holy One, blessed be He, promises that you will not need them.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; all the diseases of Egypt which you feared .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 28:60)</p>
<p>Here Moshe hinted to Israel that with every plague that came over Egypt, many souls of Israel also trembled, for they had within them a hint of deficiency similar to the Egyptians. Thus they were filled with fear, and from this fear their sin was forgiven. Then the blessed God placed Egypt beneath them, as it is written (Yesahya, 43:4), &#x201C;and I placed man beneath you.&#x201D; This is the meaning of the verse (Tehillim, 91:8), &#x201C;only with your eyes you will see, and you will witness the punishment of the evil ones.&#x201D; That is, when you see the punishment of the evil ones, if you have some of their deficiency, by means of your own fear of this the crookedness of your heart will be removed for the good.</p>

<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;You are standing today &#x2026; from your wood choppers to your water carriers .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 29:9)</p>
<p>On this King Shlomo said (Mishlei, 30:19), &#x201C;the way of a man with woman.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn348">33</xref></sup> This is as it was with Yiftach, of whom our sages said (<italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic>, 25b), &#x201C;Yiftach was in his generation as Shmuel was in his.&#x201D; This means that Yiftach has completed all that the blessed God asked from him in this world as Shmuel had done in his generation. This perplexed King Shlomo, and he said (Mishlei, 30:18), &#x201C;three things are beyond me, and four I did not know &#x2026; the way of man with woman.&#x201D; This means the choicest elements in Israel, like the one who completes God&#x2019;s will, and in this way, &#x201C;with the young woman [<italic>b&#x2019;almah</italic>],&#x201D; meaning it is so also with the meekest of Israel. This is the explanation of &#x201C;You are standing.&#x201D; That is to say, you are connected to the blessed God. &#x201C;Your leaders,&#x201D; meaning those at the greatest level; &#x201C;your water carriers,&#x201D; to the lowest level; &#x201C;all of you&#x201D; are bound up with the blessed God. &#x201C;Your wood choppers&#x201D; means those with the least fear of Heaven, and &#x201C;your water carriers&#x201D; are those with the least love of God.<sup><xref rid="fn349">34</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;You are standing here today .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 29:9)</p>
<p>&#x201C;You are standing&#x201D; after all the acceptance of punishment, which serves to clarify who will stand on his faith and accept it, not weakening in his resolve. Whoever does not truly believe will not want to accept warnings and punishments, for falsehood does not endure but the truth endures.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; your heads, your tribes, your elders and officers, each man in Israel, your infants and women, your convert that is in the midst of your camps, from your wood choppers to your water carriers .&#x2026;&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 29:9)</p>
<p>Ten levels are said here, five against five, and all as one are included among Israel. &#x201C;Your head,&#x201D; means those possessing <italic>Chochma</italic> (wisdom) are placed in juxtaposition to the infants (also small children), for infant, <italic>taf</italic> in Hebrew, is connected to the word for &#x201C;drop,&#x201D; <italic>tipah</italic> in Hebrew, meaning that they possess only a small amount of consciousness (<italic>da&#x2019;at</italic>, also &#x201C;knowledge&#x201D;). Then accordingly, when any mistake happens even to the youngest children, it affects even the heads, for the <italic>taf</italic> possessed a little consciousness from the head. &#x201C;Your tribes,&#x201D; meaning expansion, for all of Israel were hidden in the root of Yaakov Avinu, and there they were as one soul. Thus when they were divided into tribes certain souls in different generations experienced expansion. This is placed in juxtaposition to the women, because all expansion comes from birth, for when the child is hidden and included in the soul of the father then there is no expansion; only when the child is born does it begin to expand. &#x201C;Your elders&#x201D; means the one who has acquired wisdom.</p>
<p>This is juxtaposed to &#x201C;your convert,&#x201D; for according to the original insights into the Torah made among Israel, so will the converts come to and increase in Israel. The more we increase in the words of Torah, and thus experience more expansion, then the holiness of Israel extends even to the souls of the nations, and they will be gathered among Israel. &#x201C;Your officers&#x201D; meaning those possessing the fear of God, and they are placed in juxtaposition to the &#x201C;wood choppers,&#x201D; for &#x201C;chopping&#x201D; represents anger, and on this the Holy One, blessed be He, testifies that within all the anger in Israel there is the fear of God. &#x201C;Every man of Israel&#x201D; means the attribute of the love of God, and this is placed against the &#x201C;water carriers,&#x201D; for water is compared to desire, as said in various places,<sup><xref rid="fn350">35</xref></sup> and all desire and love in Israel comes from the blessed God.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;That you should enter the Covenant of Hashem your God, and into His oath, which Hashem your God makes with you today.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 29:11)</p>
<p>Rashi explains that <italic>l&#x2019;avr&#x2019;cha</italic> should be understood &#x201C;that you should enter&#x201D; (and not &#x201C;made to enter&#x201D;). Rashi&#x2019;s intention in this is in order to explain that the covenant is dealing with the realm of thought, as it says later (verse 28), &#x201C;the secret things [meaning thoughts] belong unto Hashem our God.&#x201D; (Where Rashi seems to say that God may punish an individual for his thoughts.) But in truth, the blessed God does not punish one for his thoughts. Nonetheless, even though one is only punished for his actions, still, one is not close to the blessed God if his thoughts are not cleaving to the blessed God. Therefore Rashi explains &#x201C;that you should enter,&#x201D; meaning that just as He gives you the ability to choose for yourself, free of any warning of punishment, so may you be (choose to be) a servant of God even in your thoughts.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;The secret things belong unto Hashem our God, and the revealed things are for us and our children, forever, to do all the words of this Torah.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 29:28)</p>
<p align="blockquote">It is written in the Gemara (<italic>Sanhedrin</italic>, 44a),</p>
<p align="blockquote">This point is argued by the Tannaim: The secret things belong unto the Hashem our God, but the things that are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever. Why are the words <italic>Lanu u-lebanenu</italic> [unto us and to our children] and the &#x2018;<italic>ayin</italic> of the word <italic>&#x2018;ad</italic>, [forever] dotted? In order to teach that God did not punish for transgression committed in secret, until the Israelites had crossed the Jordan: this is the view of Rav Yehuda. Said Rav Nehemia to him, &#x201C;Did God ever punish all of Israel for crimes committed in secret? Does not the Torah say forever? But just as God did not punish Israel for secret transgressions [at any time], so too did He not punish them as a whole for revealed transgressions until they had crossed the Jordan.&#x201D; Then, in the case of Achan, why were they punished?&#x2014;Because his wife and children knew thereof [so the transgression was no longer secret], therefore all of Israel was punished.<sup><xref rid="fn351">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>One could say that the answer of the Gemara, &#x201C;because his wife and children knew thereof [so the transgression was no longer secret],&#x201D; is not enough, for from this it would seem that not all of Israel, but only the ones who knew of the transgression should have been punished. It seems that the matter can be explained in this way. When a man transgresses in secret, and it is not known to anyone else, then his sin is not pertinent to the whole community of Israel, but it is rather of the secret things that belong to Hashem our God (and He decides how to deal with that individual). The blessed God is called, <italic>Rav Chesed</italic>, the Great One of Loving-kindness, and He is called the one who tilts the unworthy to the side of mercy. He clarifies the action for the good, and this attribute is only found in the blessed God. However, if there is another person who knows of or witnessed the sin that his fellow had committed, then the sin becomes pertinent to the whole community of Israel. This is because the very act of witnessing another&#x2019;s sin is testimony that the very deficiency also exists within him, or within another member of Israel (even if with him it had not even been brought into action). Because of this he was brought to witness the sin. Certainly the one who saw his fellow man&#x2019;s evil action felt a stir of <italic>tshuva</italic> (repentance) in his own heart. Therefore this affair pertains to the entire community of Israel, for &#x201C;all of Israel are responsible for one another.&#x201D; In this fashion does it say in the passage about the one who cursed in <italic>Parshat Emor</italic> (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 24:14), &#x201C;and they shall lay their hands upon the head [of the one who cursed].&#x201D; This act of placing their hands on his head was exactly as it was done with an animal brought for sacrifice in the Temple. All of Israel needed atonement because they had heard the curse, and in him they achieved atonement.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And it shall be, when all of these things come upon you, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you, and you shall take them to your heart among the nations, to where Hashem has driven you. And you shall return unto Hashem your God, and heed His voice &#x2026; And if your exiles shall be in the outermost regions of the cosmos, from there Hashem your God will gather you, and from there He will take you &#x2026; And Hashem your God will circumcise your heart &#x2026; to love Hashem your God &#x2026; And Hashem your God will put all these curses upon your enemies and on those who hate you &#x2026; And you shall return and listen to the voice of Hashem, and do all His commandments, which I command you this day.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 30:1&#x2013;8)</p>
<p>The way the Torah says &#x201C;the blessing and the curse&#x201D; has a special meaning. Within the curse, the blessing also exists in secret. &#x201C;You shall take them to your heart&#x201D; means that you shall take to your heart that the blessing also exists within the curse. &#x201C;And you shall return unto Hashem your God, and heed His voice&#x201D; means the inner voice that exists in everything. This is as it is written in the Holy Zohar (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 50b), &#x201C;and Hashem your God shall return your captives and be merciful with you.&#x201D; This means mercy in the purity and wholeness of heart that the blessed God will give you in the words of Torah and the study of Torah with desire and wholeness of heart. &#x201C;And if your exiles shall be in the outermost regions of the cosmos&#x201D; means a place your whole understanding tells you is far from your ability to fix, &#x201C;From there Hashem your God will gather you, and from there He will take you,&#x201D; meaning that even there will the blessed God fix you.</p>
<p>&#x201C;And Hashem your God will circumcise your heart&#x2026; to love Hashem your God,&#x201D; means that he will take the desire you have for matters that are not good in the eyes of God, and fix it at the time when you return in complete <italic>tshuva</italic> (repentance) in the love of God and the desire for the words of Torah. &#x201C;And Hashem your God will put all these curses upon your enemies and on those who hate you&#x201D; means he will take the evil lusts that exist in you and place them upon your enemies and those who hate you. &#x201C;And you shall return and listen to the voice of Hashem, and do all His commandments&#x201D; means that God will clarify all the lusts within you, and give this desire back to you to use in the fulfillment of His <italic>mitzvot</italic> and statutes.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;It is not in heaven, that you should say, who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it to us, that we may hear it, and do it? Nor is it beyond the sea, that you should say, who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it to us, and make us hear it, and do it? But the word is very near unto you, in your mouth, and in your heart, that you may do it.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 30:12&#x2013;14)</p>
<p>It is written in the Holy Zohar (<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 176a, and other places), &#x201C;How precious are the words of Torah&#x0021; This seems as if it is beyond the sea, and then it says some more supernal words of Torah, and it seems as if it is in the highest heavens.&#x201D; This can be understood through what is written in the Tanna Dvei Eliyahu (Zuta, Ch. 12), &#x201C;A parable. A mortal king builds a wall by way of which one enters vast palaces. In the wall he opens a narrow passageway, so narrow that one who does not love the king will not exert himself to enter. Yet one who truly loves him will push himself for he knows that after difficulty, great delights await him.&#x201D; So it is here, where at first one has not yet understood the words of Torah, how high and precious they are. Then when one comes to the meaning of words of Torah, then &#x201C;it is not in heaven, and not across the sea &#x2026; but it is near unto you, in your mouth,&#x201D; etc. Therefore Moshe Rabeynu specifically wrote these words in this <italic>Parsha</italic>, which follows the fiftieth <italic>Parsha</italic> in the Torah, for then he had attained this level (the fiftieth gate of understanding), that of &#x201C;it is not in heaven, but near.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This means that even though a man needs fences and boundaries while he does not yet understand the words of Torah, once he understands them, he does not need this. &#x201C;It is not across the sea&#x201D; means that he does not need to be far from the delights of this world, which is called &#x201C;a sea,&#x201D; for &#x201C;sea&#x201D; teaches of desire. Only at the beginning, for he can only initially enter into the words of Torah through great restraint and separation from earthly delights, but this is not the main principle. The main principle is in the doing (the performance of God&#x2019;s will). This is &#x201C;in your mouth and in your heart to <italic>do</italic> it. This is the principle, as it is said in the Tikkunei Zohar (on what Isaac said to Yaakov), &#x201C; &#x2018;make me tasty delights that I love&#x2019; [<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 27:4], these are positive commandments [that are done].&#x201D; This is as it says in the Gemara (<italic>Ta&#x2019;anit</italic>, 10a), &#x201C;better a flooded land than a dry land.&#x201D; The meaning is that it is good to be a little instilled with desire and not to be completely dry, as we have explained on the verse (Mishelei, 19) &#x201C;the desire of man is his kindness;&#x201D; see there.</p>

<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Moshe went and spoke these words &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 31:1)</p>
<p>The verse says specifically &#x201C;and Moshe went&#x201D; and &#x201C;going,&#x201D; <italic>halicha</italic>, signifies being disturbed.<sup><xref rid="fn352">37</xref></sup> It was difficult for him to understand how man could fix the deficiency imprinted on the root of his soul from the day of his birth passed on from his mother and father, for his mother conceived him in sin.<sup><xref rid="fn353">38</xref></sup> However, when the commandment to gather the people was said to him (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 31:12, &#x201C;Gather the people, the parents, the children &#x2026; that they may learn, and fear God&#x201D;), it was intimated to Moshe that man may fix the sin he is born with, which comes from his root and the root of his parents. Then he was filled with joy, as it is written (Yirmiya, 4:1), &#x201C;If Israel will return &#x2026; return unto Me.&#x201D; When a man commits a transgression, God forbid, then in his mind he is ashamed before his friend. Even though his friend does not know about it, he is anyhow uncomfortable because he feels that his friend is better than he is. This is not <italic>tshuva shleimah</italic>, complete return to the Torah. This is why the prophet said, &#x201C;you shall return to Me,&#x201D; meaning that one should rather be ashamed before the blessed God so as not to do something that God did not command.</p>
<p>God commanded 613 commandments, and each one is advice to Israel as to how one may remove the evil desires rooted in his heart, since he is here in this world, which is called a place of impurity. This is as it says in the Gemara (<italic>Kiddushin</italic>, 40b), &#x201C;[Rabbi Elazar son of Rabbi Tsaddok said: What is a <italic>Tsaddik</italic> compared to in this world? A tree that exists in a place that is wholly pure,] yet part of it turns to a place of impurity.&#x201D;</p>
<p>So therefore the blessed God gave man advice as to how he may remove himself from desires, such as the mitzvah of <italic>tsitsit</italic>, which reminds man to have the fear of God, and <italic>tefillin</italic>, which teaches of the special strength of <italic>Kedusha</italic>, as are explained in their place. Yet, in response to the evil attributes that are imprinted in man from the day of his birth derived from the root of his father and mother, as the prophet said (Yesahya, 48:8), &#x201C;For I knew that you would surely act treacherously, and you were called a sinner from the womb,&#x201D; we received the section of &#x201C;gather your people&#x201D; (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 31:12). This is as it says in the Gemara (<italic>Chagiga</italic>, 3a), &#x201C;Why did the infants also come? To reward those who brought them.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This means, by means of the longing of the father and mother to enter the words of Torah in the ears of the infant&#x2014;even though he does not understand anything at all. An example of this is found in the Talmud Yerushalmi (<italic>Yevamot</italic>, 1:6), &#x201C;See who teaches knowledge. Rabbi Yehoshua&#x2019;s mother would bring him in his cradle into the house of study so that his ears would absorb the words of Torah.&#x201D; This shows how it is possible to fix even the attributes that were imprinted in man from his mother&#x2019;s womb. This longing on the part of the parents is called &#x201C;serving the Torah is greater than studying it,&#x201D; for by means of this he may heal what came before. This is &#x201C;[to reward] those who brought them,&#x201D; meaning that even the father and mother are also fixed by this, since it fixes what came before, namely the desire of the father and mother at the moment of conception, and then it follows that he was clean regarding his mother. When Moshe Rabeynu saw this, he became filled with joy.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; I can no longer go out or come in &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 31:2)</p>
<p>On this day Moshe Rabeynu was completed in the truest form of perfection, and God signed His name to this. All the while one is not complete he may still apprehend more and reach greater heights. Yet he may also, God forbid, lose that which he has already received. After one has reached the state of completion, he will not lose anything he has previously apprehended, nor will he apprehend anything further. This is what Moshe Rabeynu meant when he said &#x201C;I can no longer go out or come in.&#x201D; &#x201C;Going out&#x201D; means that he was complete and God signed His name on his actions so that it would be impossible to lose what he had apprehended. &#x201C;Coming in&#x201D; means that also he would apprehend nothing further.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; at the end of seven years, at the time of the Shmitta [sabbatical or release] year, during the festival of Succot &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 31:10)</p>
<p>It is said in the Gemara (<italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic>, 12b), &#x201C;What does the festival of Succot have to do with the <italic>Shmitta</italic> [seventh] year? Succot, following Rosh Hashanah, is already in the eighth year. Yet all produce where you did not bring a third thereof in the seventh year, you treat it also in the eighth year as you would have in the seventh.&#x201D; This is according to the verse (Tehillim, 115:16), &#x201C;The heavens are the heavens of God, and the earth was given to man.&#x201D; This is just the way it seems. Yet King David said (Tehillim, 135:6), &#x201C;all that God desired, He did, in the heavens and the earth.&#x201D; It is well-known that all the actions of man, even though the power of choice was given to man, are something as insignificant as a peel of garlic. This is why we say on the first day of the week (Sunday) (while reciting the daily levitical songs in the morning service), &#x201C;the earth is God&#x2019;s and the fullness thereof.&#x201D; The point of Shabbat is to know that man has no real power, for the thirty-nine forms of work created in the world with which man may do all he wants are all prohibited on Shabbat. Yet when the weekdays start, and work is again permitted, God forbid that man may say, &#x201C;my strength and the power of my hands have gotten me this wealth&#x201D; (<italic>Devarim</italic>, 8:17). Therefore our sages established that we say immediately after Shabbat, &#x201C;the earth is God&#x2019;s and the fullness thereof.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It is similarly so with the seventh <italic>Shmitta</italic> year that the Torah commanded, which makes it known to us that the earth is God&#x2019;s and all its fullness. Then when the eighth year comes, plowing and sowing again becomes permitted in order that we can reap from the land without say, God forbid, &#x201C;my strength and the power of my hands have gained me this wealth.&#x201D; This is why with produce that a third was not brought as a tithe in the seventh year, &#x201C;you treat it also in the eighth year as you would have in the seventh,&#x201D; in order to remember that &#x201C;the earth is God&#x2019;s and the fullness thereof.&#x201D;</p>

<p>[From the &#x201C;Tiferet Yosef&#x201D; of Mordechai Yosef Elazar of Radzin, Great Grandson of the Mei HaShiloach]</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Blow in the month the shofar, in the covering of the new moon of the day of our festival.&#x201D;</italic> (Tehillim, 81:4)</p>
<p>It is written in the Holy Zohar (Vayechi, 226b), &#x201C;it is taught that it is the beginning of the year of the king.&#x201D; Everything is included in the beginning of the intention. If at the outset of something one turns to the blessed God, thus all the resulting adventures will be included in the initial intention. As we find in the Midrash (Kohollet Rabba, 7), &#x201C;&#x2018;The end of something is better than its beginning&#x2019; means really that the end of something is good when it is good from the beginning.&#x201D; This also teaches of what we find in the Gemara (<italic>Baba Metsia</italic>, 85b), &#x201C;Rabbi Chaya said to Rabbi Chanina &#x2026; &#x2018;I have made it so the Torah will not be forgotten from Israel. First I sowed flax, and made of it nets. Then with the nets I trapped some deer, from which I fed their meat to the orphans. From their skins I made scrolls, on which I wrote the five books of the Torah. Then I went to a town and found five children, and taught each one a book of the Torah. Then I found six children, and taught each one of the six orders of Mishna. Then I told them, I am leaving, and will return. Before I do, I want you to teach the Torah and the Mishna to each other. This is what I have done so the Torah would not be forgotten from Israel.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>
<p>This means that since from the beginning of the actions of Rabbi Chaya that the Gemara described, his great intention was so that the Torah would not be forgotten from Israel, then accordingly it is all called in his name. For this is the principle that everything goes after the first intention. And this is the matter with &#x201C;<italic>mitzvot</italic> need intention,&#x201D; meaning that even after the intention, when a man starts the action of the mitzvah, the light dresses itself in the forms of actions, and the light becomes hidden. But for this, it needs the intention, so that everything goes after the intention, and this is in the realm of man. And so it is with the blessed God, as it were. For in truth, the beginning of the intention of the creation was as it is written (Tehillim, 89), &#x201C;For I said that I will found the world on <italic>Chesed</italic> [Loving-kindness].&#x201D; This means that the beginning of God&#x2019;s will to create the world was for Israel, for Israel was the first to raise up in His thought. Even though He established afterward many different &#x201C;garments,&#x201D; in creation before the utterance, &#x201C;Let us make a man,&#x201D; still with God, this too was, as it were, included in the beginning. That is, if man goes in the way of Divine service, he will eventually arrive at this initial will of Israel being the first to arise in His thought. And this is also the mitzvah of blowing the shofar on Rosh Hashanah, because on this day the light of the blessed God begins to dress itself in garments.</p>
<p>This is the meaning of &#x201C;blow the shofar in the month, on the day of our festival in the covering of the new moon,&#x201D; on which the Gemara comments (<italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic>, 40b), &#x201C;on which festival does the moon cover itself? I would say Rosh Hashanah.&#x201D; For there it is at the point of the beginning where God&#x2019;s holy will begins to cover itself in hidden garments. And at that point we have the mitzvah of the shofar. For the shofar is the inner voice, and the Holy Zohar says (Pinchas, 128b), &#x201C;there is no speech [<italic>Dibbur</italic>&#x2014;the practical execution of the soul&#x2019;s will] without voice [<italic>Kol</italic>&#x2014;the inner soul and will itself], and there is no voice without speech. This is true in the world of <italic>Atsilut</italic> (the closest spiritual realm to the Infinite, where there is no separation and no existence of evil, rather all pure emanation ex nihilo). Yet in the world of separation [our own imperfect world] there is voice without speech.&#x201D; This means that (at the moment of blowing the shofar on Rosh Hashanah) man will immediately accept the blessed God&#x2019;s reign over him before the light begins to dress itself in the garments that we call speech. Once done, of their own accord all the adventures and details of the entire year will be included in this beginning.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;In the seventh month on the first of the month &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Bamidbar, 29:1)</p>
<p>It is written (Shmuel 1, Ch. 25, when David haMelech opened to Naval in peace), &#x201C;and you shall say thus to the living, &#x2018;<italic>co lechai</italic>&#x2019;&#x201D;, and it says on this in the Holy Zohar (Vayera, 23b), &#x201C;this day was the festival of Rosh Hashanah, and it is because of the Holy One, blessed be He, it is said, &#x2018;<italic>co lechai</italic>,&#x2019; &#x2018;thus to the living,&#x2019; meaning you must connect <italic>co</italic> to <italic>chai</italic>, to the source on which all life depends.&#x201D; <italic>Co</italic>, &#x201C;thus,&#x201D; denotes that which remains in one&#x2019;s apprehension after one engages in serving God, as it is written concerning Avraham Avinu (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 15:5), &#x201C;<italic>co yihye za&#x2019;areicha</italic>, thus will be your seed.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This means that Avraham Avinu wanted to apprehend the remnant that remained after the service that he had performed. For he knew well that from God&#x2019;s point of view something was left over from all his actions of service, yet he wanted a clear apprehension of it, so God said to him. &#x201C;This [<italic>co</italic>] will be your seed after you,&#x201D; that you will understand that you need to connect your service in this world to the primordial will of God with the creation. This means that from God&#x2019;s perspective there is a king without a people, as we say in &#x201C;Adon Olam,&#x201D; &#x201C;the Master of the world who reigned before anything was created.&#x201D; Yet only from the side that He wanted to improve his creation, the blessed God created the understanding in the human intellect that there is no king without a people to make him king. From the side of the created intellect man must accept upon himself the yoke of God&#x2019;s kingship in his apprehension. And after the act of service he must connect this apprehension to a place that is above all orders of service.</p>
<p>We find in the Holy Zohar (<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 2), &#x201C;at the time when humankind was of the &#x2018;two faces,&#x2019; [see the first of the two creations of man, in <italic>Bereshit</italic> 1:27, where it says, &#x201C;male and female He created them&#x201D;] male and female were connected as one.&#x201D; This means that there was no veil separating the creation and the light of the blessed God. And all of the creation had an explicit understanding that all who separated from the Torah were as much as separating from life itself. So from this kind of understanding there is no room for man&#x2019;s service. Yet the blessed God wants to improve his creation and desires that man will have a way to serve Him. For this reason there was the <italic>nesira</italic>, the separation of female from male, on Rosh Hashanah. And this separation is as it is written (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 2:21), &#x201C;and God cast a deep slumber on man and he slept.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This means that he created a veil separating the creation and the light of the blessed God. Thus man must break the veil and understand as it was before the separation. As it says in the Holy Zohar (<italic>Lech L&#x2019;cha</italic>, 85b), &#x201C;when souls go out they go out as male and female as one, afterward they are separated, and God rejoins them in union according to the service of man.&#x201D; And it is said in the Holy Zohar (<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 2b), &#x201C;before, the female was united on her side,&#x201D; meaning that there was no veil to cause separation. &#x201C;And afterward they separated,&#x201D; means that the blessed God established separating veils. &#x201C;And God rejoins them according to man&#x2019;s service&#x201D; means that according to how much man works in Divine service to break the veil, accordingly he will see the connection that he has with the light of the blessed God as it was before the separation.</p>
<p>This is, &#x201C;Blow the shofar in the month, in the covering of the new moon on the day of our festival,&#x201D; that all the other festivals occur on the full moon, meaning that the blessed God turns to His creation, that His creation should have an understanding of his light. But on this festival it is &#x201C;in the covering,&#x201D; as it says in the Holy Zohar (<italic>Shoftim</italic>, 275b), &#x201C;that the moon covers itself,&#x201D; meaning that the creation does not recognize the light of the blessed God. And this is the mitzvah of blowing the shofar, where by means of this mitzvah man may connect his apprehension of this world with God&#x2019;s primordial will.</p>
<p>And this is why it said above in the Zohar, &#x201C;this day [that David approached Naval with peace] was the day of the festival of Rosh Hashanah, where one must connect <italic>co</italic> [thus] with <italic>chai</italic> [life].&#x201D; That on this day, by means of blowing the shofar, we may break the separating veil that came into existence with the separation (<italic>nesira</italic>, of male and female), and we raise and connect the apprehension of this world to <italic>chai</italic>, life. Which itself is God&#x2019;s primordial will in creation, which is above and beyond any order of Divine service. Thus we can connect everything created to the source on which all life depends.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And it was, after these words, that E-lohim tested Avraham.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 22:1)</p>
<p>It is written (Tehillim, 60:6), &#x201C;You have given a banner to those who fear You, that it may be displayed because of the truth, selah.&#x201D; (Or as R. Hirsch translates, &#x201C;to raise themselves to its height before the might of wisdom.&#x201D;) What does it mean, &#x201C;after these words?&#x201D; The Gemara explains:</p>
<p align="blockquote">And it was, after these words, that God tested Avraham. What is meant by &#x201C;after&#x201D;? Rabbi Yochanan said in the name of Rabbi Yossi ben Zimra, &#x201C;After the words of Satan, as it is written, &#x2018;And the child grew, and was weaned. And Avraham made a great feast the same day that Yitschok was weaned.&#x2019; Thereupon Satan said to the Almighty; &#x2018;Master of the Universe&#x0021; To this old man did you graciously promise a child at the age of a hundred, yet of all that banquet which he prepared, he did not have one turtle-dove or pigeon to sacrifice before You&#x0021; Has he not done anything on honor of his son&#x0021;&#x2019; God answered, &#x2018;Yet were I to say to him, &#x201C;Sacrifice your son before Me,&#x201D; he would do so immediately.&#x2019;&#x201D; Right after this, &#x201C;God tested Avraham.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Satan brought forth the great accusation, &#x201C;how does Avraham deserve that God should act with him in a way above the power of nature?&#x201D; This is &#x201C;<italic>nissa et Avraham</italic>&#x2014;and he tested Avraham.&#x201D; <italic>Nissa</italic> in Hebrew means both to test, and also to raise or elevate. In other words, the blessed God elevated the entire system of the creation, and showed that He did this according to correct judgment. He showed the creation that Avraham himself was the principle of the entire creation, and by means of him the blessed God effuses life to the entire creation. He showed them that the entire word was created only to command this, as it says in the Midrash (Rabba, <italic>Lech L&#x2019;cha</italic>, 39), &#x201C;even ships that were sailing in the sea were blessed [or protected] because of our Forefather Avraham.&#x201D; It is asked in the Midrash, &#x201C;But did they not contain forbidden wine? The proverb says, &#x2018;Vinegar cheapens wine.&#x2019; Wherever Gentile wine is available, Jewish wine is cheap.&#x201D; That is to say, that he was the main principle of all of the creation, so much that even that from which benefit is forbidden was blessed because of him. This is all because Avraham would serve God in a way that was above nature. In truth, God never said specifically to him, &#x201C;slaughter your son.&#x201D; (God said, &#x201C;<italic>ha&#x2019;alehu sham l&#x2019;olah</italic>,&#x201D; &#x201C;raise him there as an offering.&#x201D;)</p>
<p>The Zohar comments on this (<italic>Vayeira</italic>, 120a), &#x201C;the Divine utterance came to him as a mirror that does not illuminate [signifying a lower level of prophecy].&#x201D; As it is written in the Midrash (Rabba, <italic>Vayeira</italic>, 56), &#x201C;Avraham was perplexed. Avraham asked of Hashem &#x2018;Yesterday You said to me, Your seed will be called in Yitschok, and today You say, take your only son, and raise him.&#x2019;&#x201D; The meaning is, if he had the tendency of the love of a father for his son according to the way of nature, he could have understood the blessed God&#x2019;s command to have been, &#x201C;Raise him as an offering, but do not slaughter him.&#x201D; But rather, he served God in a way outside of the realm of nature, and removed all natural tendencies of the love of a father for his son. The blessed God showed the creation that exactly because of this, the blessed God deals with him in a way that is above nature. After this Avraham prayed (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 22:14), &#x201C;as it is said to this day, on the mountain God is seen.&#x201D;</p>
<p>That is, he prayed to the blessed God that from that day on it would no longer be necessary for anyone to suffer this kind of supernal patience (or perhaps, the suffering he had to go through to serve God above nature). Rather, whenever his seed after him would want to recognize His blessed light, then the blessed God would immediately illuminate him. This is as it is said in the Midrash (Rabba, <italic>Vayigash</italic>, 94), &#x201C;we look up, and it is if the ashes of Yitschok are piled on the altar.&#x201D; This means that Avraham&#x2019;s prayer was effective, that something remained of Avraham&#x2019;s supernal patience permanently instilled in all generations to come, so they would not need to suffer his kind of patience.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; E-lohim tested Avraham.&#x201D;</italic> (Bereshit, 22)</p>
<p>It is written in the Holy Zohar (<italic>Vayeira</italic>, 120a), &#x201C;the test was in an <italic>aspaclaria d&#x2019;la meira</italic>, a glass that does not illuminate.&#x201D; Truly, when a man stands and has a revealed and explicit understanding that all comes from You and is given from Your hand, then it cannot be said that this service can be called in the name of the man. For there is nothing remarkable in this, as it is written in the Holy Zohar (<italic>Shmini</italic>, 38a), &#x201C;he sent a gift to the house of the King, and He showed him that he took from the house of the King and gave it back to the King.&#x201D; Furthermore, it is written in the Midrash (Rabba, <italic>Emor</italic>, 27) on the verse (Iyov, 41:3), &#x201C;Who has preceded me, that I should repay him, all that is under the heavens is Mine.&#x201D; &#x201C;Who could praise Me before I gave him a soul with which to praise?&#x201D; It is only because the blessed God desires to forever improve his creations, and that His service should be called in the name of the one who does it&#x2014;the work of the hands of the man&#x2014;that He concealed this revelation from man. Thus man does not have an explicit awareness of this (that all that he gives to God was originally taken from God), and it seems to man that he has what to give.</p>
<p>Then after, when man manages to break through by means of his service, and has a clear awareness that at present it is the blessed God&#x2019;s will that what he has be returned before the blessed God, then this service is considered as the work of the man himself and called in his name. Concerning this, Avraham&#x2019;s test was called &#x201C;a mirror that does not illuminate.&#x201D; This is as it is written in the Midrash (Rabba, <italic>Vayeira</italic>, 56), &#x201C;Avraham was perplexed. Avraham asked of Hashem &#x2018;Yesterday You said to me, Your seed will be called in Yitschok, and today You say, take your only son, and raise him.&#x2019;&#x201D; He was confronted with contradictory utterances from God, and if he had even a small tendency of the natural love of a father from his son in this world, then he could have resolved it by saying, &#x201C;He commanded me to offer Yitschok, but not to slaughter him.&#x201D; Rather, Avraham Avinu removed himself from all natural tendencies of the love of a father for his son and fulfilled the will of the blessed God. This was the essence of his test. We find that from the side of Avraham Avinu the life of Yitschok Avinu was already considered as nothing, and his entire life remained from the Divine utterance, &#x201C;do not send your hand against the child.&#x201D; (In other words, Avraham had become a complete vessel for God&#x2019;s will, as expressed in each Divine communication.</p>
<p>So when God said, &#x201C;raise your son as a sacrifice,&#x201D; that was Avraham&#x2019;s entire purpose in the world, in a supernatural way, as explained. Then when God said, &#x201C;do not send your hand,&#x201D; this became his entire purpose. Betsalel.) In these words, the blessed God showed that His entire will desired the life of Israel. This is the meaning of Avraham&#x2019;s prayer that follows, &#x201C;where it is said unto this day, on the mountain God is seen.&#x201D; In other words, he prayed that the blessed God would always show the deep connection that was in force at the time of the binding of Yitschok, a connection that desires the life of Israel. This is as it is written in the Midrash (Rabba, <italic>Vayigash</italic>, 94), &#x201C;we look up, and it is if the ashes of Yitschok are piled on the altar.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This is to say, that Avraham&#x2019;s prayer was successful, that the desire for the life of Israel is, as it were, always before God&#x2019;s eyes. Concerning this we pray &#x201C;today,&#x201D; on Rosh Hashanah, on the binding of Yitschok to his progeny, &#x201C;Today, remember with compassion.&#x201D; The end of the blessing we recite in the service reads, &#x201C;Blessed is He who remembers the Covenant.&#x201D; This means that from the time of the binding of Yitschok, the blessed God was thoroughly connected to Israel in the desire for the life of Israel. This is the meaning of the blessing ending, &#x201C;Blessed is He who remembers the Covenant.&#x201D; For concerning the blessing of a fast it is written in the Gemara (<italic>Ta&#x2019;anit</italic>, 15), &#x201C;He who answered us at the Sea of Reeds&#x2026; Blessed is He who remembers the forgotten.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The whole matter of a miracle is because man forgets. For truly, on the day Adam was created, he saw the ocean raging and swelling, and his reaction was as if he was witnessing the miracle of the splitting of the Sea of Reeds. Yet since man is a forgetful creature, and has become accustomed to the nature of this world and the motion of the sea, when finally the Sea of Reeds split it was seen as a miracle. A miracle is only when man is awoken from the forgetting, which causes him not to see that everything is coming from the blessed God. Yet when one witnesses a miracle, he wakes up and sees this. This is how our blessing of &#x201C;Blessed is He who remembers the forgotten&#x201D; is only from our point of view, for with the blessed God, &#x201C;there is no forgetting before His throne of Glory.&#x201D; Of Him we bless, &#x201C;Blessed is He who remembers the Covenant.&#x201D;</p>

<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> H<small>A&#x2019;AZINU</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak, and the earth shall hear the sayings of my mouth.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 32:1)</p>
<p>It is said in the Midrash (<italic>Sifrei Ha&#x2019;azinu Piska</italic> 1), &#x201C;Since Moshe Rabeynu was close to the heavens, he called on the heavens to listen. And Yesahya, who was close to the earth, called on the earth to listen.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn354">39</xref></sup> Moshe Rabeynu is the brain and wisdom of all of Israel, and this is called &#x201C;the heavens.&#x201D; The brain has the ability to receive even things that are for man as tough as sinews. Yesahya is the heart of all of Israel, and the matter of the heart is that it constantly cries out for salvation, and can only accept things that are comforting. This is the matter of the name of Isaiah, Yeshayahu in Hebrew, meaning salvation. And this is &#x201C;Give ear, O heavens,&#x201D; meaning the great powers, which are called heavens, which is the brain, which has the power to accept everything. &#x201C;And I will speak,&#x201D; the term &#x201C;speak,&#x201D; <italic>dibbur</italic> in Hebrew, always denotes difficulty (and is therefore used here with &#x201C;heavens&#x201D;). &#x201C;And may the earth hear the sayings of my mouth,&#x201D; for &#x201C;saying,&#x201D; <italic>amirah</italic> in Hebrew, always denotes softness. In other words, you will call to the heart, which is called the earth, which is always thirsty for salvation, in the language of softness and comfort. The verses continue, &#x201C;My doctrine shall drip as the rain&#x201D; (&#x201C;dripping,&#x201D; <italic>arof</italic> in Hebrew, sounds just like the word for neck), meaning that for one who resists coming close to it, the Torah will strongly clutch the back of his neck, so to speak, and against his will he will have to accept the yoke of the Torah. Immediately upon accepting it, &#x201C;my saying will flow like the dew,&#x201D; meaning that the words of Torah will then be with him in comfort and joy.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; as the light rain upon the herb, as the heavy rain upon the grass.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 32:2)</p>
<p>Rashi explains that all grasses (<italic>eisev</italic>) in general are called &#x201C;herb,&#x201D; <italic>deshe</italic> in Hebrew, when the land is dressed in herbs. This means that all the 613 <italic>mitzvot</italic> are suited for all of Israel in general. &#x201C;Like the heavy rain on the grass.&#x201D; Rashi explains that each particular kind of herb specifically is called a &#x201C;grass&#x201D; or <italic>eisev</italic>. The intention of the verse is each particular soul in Israel, where each one recognizes the affliction of his heart. No one&#x2019;s deficiency is similar to any others; therefore in that particular aspect where each one knows that he is deficient, the corresponding aspect in Torah must be reinforced in that very place until it is eventually completed. This is &#x201C;the heavy rains upon the grass,&#x201D; &#x201C;heavy&#x201D; meaning in great measure, or to increase the measure of Torah specifically in the place that is lacking.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;When I call in the name of God, ascribe greatness to Hashem.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 32:3)</p>
<p>Moshe Rabeynu said, &#x201C;why am I silencing all the powers of the upper worlds, called heavens, and all the powers that exist in the earth? In other words, I am doing this because I am calling and crying out that the words of Torah should be entered into the heart of each one in Israel, called the name of God. &#x201C;Ascribe greatness unto Hashem&#x201D; means to a place of expansion, that they should all be moving toward this and none should be preventing it. Even all the &#x201C;external&#x201D; forces, Nebuchadnezzar and his entourage, all the powers of this world, all of which are called fine dust almost not seen to the eye<sup><xref rid="fn355">40</xref></sup> and were greatly harrowing the heart of man, all have been nullified in order that the words of Torah may enter into the heart of Israel. So now he began to speak the words of Torah to Israel since everything was silenced.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;The Rock, whose actions are perfect, for all His ways are justice, God of truth and without iniquity, He is just and right. Is corruption His? No, the blemish is His children&#x2019;s, a crooked and perverse generation.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 32:4)</p>
<p>In this you are to know and understand that every action that you do is from Him, may He be blessed, and without Him, a man will not raise an arm or leg to do anything. So there is no need to boast of your achievements. &#x201C;Is corruption His? No&#x0021;&#x201D; This means that lest you say that since everything is in the hand of heaven, then therefore any faults on my part are also really from heaven, God forbid. Do not say this, rather all the good that you do ascribe to the blessed God, and all the faults ascribe to yourselves. &#x201C;The blemish is His children&#x2019;s,&#x201D; this means that in the same place where they are His children, when they are very good, there we also found their imperfections. For whoever is greater than his peer, his inclination to evil is also greater (<italic>Sotah</italic>, 52a). &#x201C;A stubborn and crooked generation,&#x201D; &#x201C;stubborn&#x201D; meaning one who is obstinate with God and refuses to do His will because he is constantly drawn after his own personal quest for pleasure. &#x201C;Crooked&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn356">41</xref></sup> means the opposite. &#x201C;Crooked&#x201D; is one who goes to great lengths mortifying his flesh and dedicating himself to God in places that are totally unnecessary, excessively restraining himself, and this is also a transgression, for &#x201C;he who is cruel troubles his own flesh&#x201D; (Mishlei, 11:17).</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Do you thus requite God [do you hold God responsible for causing this], you foolish and unwise people. Is He not your father, the One who has acquired you? He has made you and established you.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 32:6)</p>
<p>In other words, you want to hold God responsible for the evil within you. &#x201C;Is He not your father, the One who has acquired you&#x201D; means that God is both like a father for us, and also like a father-in-law, and this is &#x201C;the One who has acquired you.&#x201D; It is the way of a father to be merciful with his son even if his son does not behave in the most upright manner. The father-in-law, however, seeks a husband for his daughter who is exceptional in his behavior and filled with good qualities. This is as it says, &#x201C;is He not your father,&#x201D; for God is merciful with us like a father with his son even if the son does not act in a good way. &#x201C;The One who has acquired you&#x201D; means that God takes pride in that you are exceptional and praiseworthy in your attributes, as a father-in-law does with a good son-in-law.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Consider the days of old, fathom the years of many generations. Ask your father, and he will tell you, your elders, and they will say unto you.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 32:7)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Consider the days of old&#x201D; means all that is in <italic>Parshat Bereshit</italic> until &#x201C;and the heavens and the earth were complete&#x201D; (i.e., the first chapter the book of <italic>Bereshit</italic>.) &#x201C;Fathom the years of many generations,&#x201D; means the two <italic>Parshiot</italic> of <italic>Bereshit</italic> and <italic>Noach</italic> (Chapters 2 through 11 in the book of <italic>Bereshit</italic>), which includes the ten generations from Adam to Noach, and the ten generations from Noach to Avraham. What is to be fathomed, or understood, is the way in which the blessed God would deal with these twenty generations. &#x201C;Ask your father, and he will tell you&#x201D; means to study the <italic>Parshiot</italic> that deal with Avraham Avinu, which are <italic>Lech Lecha, Vayeira</italic>, and <italic>Chayei Sarah</italic> (chapters 12 through 25:19 in the book of <italic>Bereshit</italic>). &#x201C;Your elders, and they will say unto you&#x201D; means the <italic>Parshiot</italic> that include Yitschok and Yaakov, which is the rest of the book of <italic>Bereshit</italic>, and to understand all the great dealings and spiritual exchange the blessed God had with the Patriarchs.</p>
<p>Therefore when it hints of Avraham it says &#x201C;<italic>vayagedcha</italic>&#x201D; (&#x201C;and he will tell you,&#x201D; in a single word) rather than &#x201C;<italic>vayaged lecha</italic>&#x201D; (the same but spelled in two words). This is because Avraham Avinu caused such a tremendous stir in the world, to such an extent that he made it possible for each and every one of Israel to be able to tell individually of the greatness of the blessed God. This is represented by &#x201C;<italic>vayagedcha</italic>&#x2014;and he will tell you,&#x201D; all in one single construction (meaning, for all), as opposed to &#x201C;<italic>vayaged lecha</italic>,&#x201D; in two words (where the word &#x201C;two you&#x201D; is singled out, as if it is possible for a select few). This represents how, by himself, each and every one could tell of the wonders of the blessed God.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, when He separated the children of men, He set the borders of the nations, according to the number of the children of Israel.</italic>&#x201D; (Devarim, 32:8)</p>
<p>In other words, His intention with the creation of the world and all the generations until Avraham Avinu was in order for the Israelite nation to come into the world. &#x201C;He set the borders of the nations&#x201D; is the means by which the nations derive their existence in the world, which is &#x201C;according to the number of the children of Israel.&#x201D; Effluence and life is effused to Israel, and from this, refuse remains. The nations then take this refuse, and derive their existence from it. This is as it is written (in the next verse), &#x201C;for God&#x2019;s portion is His people, Yaakov is the cord of His inheritence.&#x201D; The main point is Israel.</p>

<title>P<small>ARSHAT</small> V<small>E</small>Z<small>OT</small> H<small>A</small>B<small>RACHA</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And this is the blessing with which Moshe the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 33:1)</p>
<p>&#x201C;The man of God&#x201D; means that the blessed God delivered the matter into the hands of Moshe at that time. Just as he would bless, and just as he would arrange an account of what would happen to Israel until the end of all generations, thus the blessed God would agree and so it would be. Also, just as Moshe would arrange just how much Divine service would be necessary for each soul in Israel, so it would be.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; before his death.&#x201D;</italic></p>
<p>Moshe Rabeynu was the most beloved and chosen out of all the souls in Israel. On the day of his death he was completed in perfection, as it is said, &#x201C;I am one hundred and twenty years old today,&#x201D; meaning that on this day he was completed in absolute perfection, for each one is completed at a particular time. Yaakov Avinu was completed at the time that he descended to Egypt, and the seventeen years he spent there were <italic>me&#x2019;eyn olam haba</italic>, likened to the world to come. Moshe Rabeynu was completed on the day of his death, so he blessed them, and surely this blessing was in the way of the very best before Israel.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And he said; Hashem came from Sinai, and shined from Seir unto them; He appeared from Mount Paran, and He came from holy multitudes; from His right hand came a law of fire for them.</italic>&#x201D; (Devarim, 33:2)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Hashem came from Sinai.&#x201D; The blessed God rests His presence with those who despise the delights of this world.<sup><xref rid="fn357">42</xref></sup> &#x201C;And rose up from Seir unto them,&#x201D; &#x201C;<italic>Seir</italic>&#x201D; hints at anger (as it sounds like the word for storm, <italic>se&#x2019;ara</italic>). There is some good within this, like the heated anger of the scholars (see <italic>Ta&#x2019;anit</italic> 4a, &#x201C;if a young scholar gets into a rage it is because the Torah inflames him, as it says [Yirmiya, 23:29], &#x2018;is not My word like fire, says Hashem&#x2019;&#x201D;). Therefore it only uses the word &#x201C;shined,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn358">43</xref></sup> because there is only a small measure of good that can be derived from anger. &#x201C;He appeared from Mount Paran,&#x201D; this corresponds to lust, which corresponds to Yishmael. The word used for appeared, <italic>hofi&#x2019;a</italic>, is an even less intense illumination than &#x201C;shone&#x201D;&#x2014;<italic>zericha</italic>.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and He came from holy multitudes &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 33:2)</p>
<p>All forms of Divine assistance were found then, because an angel (holy multitudes of angels) means Divine assistance.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; from His right hand came a law of fire for them.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 33:2)</p>
<p>&#x201C;From His right hand,&#x201D; meaning because of the great love the blessed God has for Israel. Therefore all of the Torah is classified here as &#x201C;a law of fire,&#x201D; meaning severe punishments. This is &#x201C;from His right hand,&#x201D; meaning that they come from His love.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Yea, He loves the nations &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 33:3)</p>
<p>The word for love, <italic>chovev</italic>, uses a language of concealment, for it means both &#x201C;love&#x201D;&#x2014;<italic>chibba</italic>, and also &#x201C;debt&#x201D;&#x2014;<italic>chov</italic> (or even punishment). This is like a father who forces his son to study the Torah, and according to the understanding of the son he is incurring a punishment.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; all His holy ones are in Your hand &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 33:3)</p>
<p>This is voiced as if it is happening before him. This teaches that all who act out of love are in the hand of the blessed God, and His presence is explicit before them.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; they sat down at Your feet &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 33:3)</p>
<p>They crowd together before the infinite expansiveness of the Holy One, blessed be He. Like at Mount Sinai, even though He held the mountain over them like a washbasin (saying, &#x201C;if you accept the Torah, then fine, and if not, then this place will be your graves&#x201D;), still, they crowded themselves under the mountain.<sup><xref rid="fn359">44</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; every one shall receive Your words.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 33:3)</p>
<p>&#x201C;<italic>Yissa</italic>&#x2014;every one shall receive [or raise up]&#x201D; is expressed in the singular voice. This means that they shall all receive together as one. This is as it is written (<italic>Shemot</italic>, 19:2), &#x201C;and Israel camped before the mountain,&#x201D; and the Midrash explains, &#x201C;as one man and of one heart.&#x201D; Also, <italic>Yissa</italic> is a term denoting &#x201C;raised.&#x201D; This is because Israel is raised up to the words of Torah. For when she (Israel) does not occupy herself in Torah she is lowered in diametric opposition to how she was raised. Then when Israel fulfills the Torah, they then raise the Torah on high.<sup><xref rid="fn360">45</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Moshe commanded us the Torah, an inheritance for the community of Yaakov.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 33:4)</p>
<p>Here there are two matters. Both are contained in the blessing over the Torah which we pronounce each day, first, &#x201C;who gave [<italic>natan</italic>] us His Torah,&#x201D; and the second, &#x201C;[blessed is God] who gives the Torah.&#x201D; That which the Patriarchs rooted in the heart of all Israel cannot be weakened or removed, and the <italic>Kedusha</italic> that no sin can blemish, is called <italic>natan</italic>&#x2014;&#x201C;given.&#x201D; However, the portion that the blessed God allotted to each soul in Israel, with which he may innovate original ideals in Torah, may be blemished by man, God forbid. Of this our sages explained (<italic>Berachot</italic>, 57a), &#x201C;If one dreams he has intercourse with a betrothed maiden, he may expect to obtain knowledge of Torah, since it says, Moshe commanded us a law [Torah], an inheritance for the community of Yaakov. Read not <italic>morashah</italic> [inheritance], but <italic>me&#x2019;orasah</italic> [betrothed].&#x201D; &#x201C;Inheritance&#x201D; means the <italic>Kedusha</italic> of the Patriarchs. &#x201C;Betrothed&#x201D; means the power with which man is given to innovate.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And there was a king in Yeshurun &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 33:5)</p>
<p>A state needs a king in order that its inhabitants do not transgress the decrees and statutes of the state. However, were all the inhabitants of the state to act in the ways of truth and honesty, then there would be no advantage to this position and they would no longer need a king. This only applies to an earthly king, yet with a king such as the blessed God there is still an advantage in His position even if all act with truth and righteousness. In this sense have the members of the great assembly enacted that we say (in the prayers of the High Holidays), &#x201C;and You, Hashem our God, shall soon reign over all Your works&#x2026; for You shall remove the governance of iniquity from the land.&#x201D; In other words, in this way shall His throne be magnified, for the kingdom of the blessed God is not like an earthly kingdom. This is as is explained in the writings of the Holy Ari&#x201D;zal (R. Yitschok Luria) on the subject of <italic>Iggulim</italic> and <italic>Yosher</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn361">46</xref></sup> where &#x201C;<italic>Iggulim</italic>&#x201D; hints that each soul in Israel stands directed before the blessed God, and no one has an elevated status over another. This is as it is explained in the Gemara (<italic>Ta&#x2019;anit</italic>, 31a), &#x201C;In the future God will make a circle dance of the <italic>Tsaddikim</italic>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;A circle dance,&#x201D; for in a circle each one is equally close. &#x201C;<italic>Yosher</italic>&#x201D; means that there are levels and different states of elevation of one over another, where one may be closer than the other. In the future, these two realms of <italic>Iggulim</italic> and <italic>Yosher</italic> will be together as one, for the <italic>Kedusha</italic> (sanctity) that we inherit from the Patriarchs is called &#x201C;<italic>Iggul</italic>,&#x201D; and the <italic>Kedusha</italic> that that one earns by distinguishing himself by means of his actions will gain him a state of spiritual elevation. Then he too will be recognized as the one whom the blessed God loves, and even within the equilibrium of a circle it will be apparent that he is closer than the rest. This is &#x201C;and there was a king in Yeshurun,&#x201D; for then the greatness of Moshe Rabeynu will be recognized.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Reuven shall live and not die; and let his men be numbered.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 33:6)</p>
<p>With this blessing Moshe Rabeynu healed the blessing that Yaakov had withheld from him before his death. Corresponding to what Yaakov said (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 49:3), &#x201C;the excellency [or &#x2018;excess&#x2019;] of strength,&#x201D; meaning that he had taken the holy brazen strength and <italic>simcha</italic> (joy) of the heart away from him, Moshe Rabeynu blessed him by saying, &#x201C;Reuven shall live,&#x201D; meaning that he should have vivacity, joy, and holy strength in his heart. Corresponding to &#x201C;the excellency [or &#x2018;excess&#x2019;] of dignity,&#x201D; Moshe blessed him by saying, &#x201C;let his men be numbered.&#x201D; This is because increase comes from a state of elevation, for if there was no elevation of one over another, and each one were similar to his fellow in his understanding, there would be no possibility of increase for they would be equal. Thus it says (<italic>Sanhedrin</italic>, 89a), &#x201C;no two prophets prophesize in the same way.&#x201D; Yet since one&#x2019;s life is not the same as another&#x2019;s life, from this power, we find states of increase. Therefore one has an elevation over another, and therefore he blessed him by saying, &#x201C;let his men be numbered,&#x201D; which teaches of a healing for what Yaakov said, &#x201C;the excellency [or &#x2018;excess&#x2019;] of dignity.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Reuven shall live and not die; and let his men be numbered.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 33:6)</p>
<p>The blessing of Moshe Rabeynu corresponded to (or even was in response to) the blessings of Yaakov Avinu. Yaakov had said to Reuven (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 49:3), &#x201C;the excellency [or, as Rashi says, excess, meaning more than your brothers] of dignity, the excellency of power. Unstable as water, you shall not excel.&#x201D; The Midrash (<italic>Bereshit</italic> Rabba, 99:6) comments, &#x201C;like water that is spilled from a cup, and nothing remains.&#x201D; Concerning this, Moshe Rabeynu blessed him by saying, &#x201C;let Reuven live,&#x201D; corresponding to &#x201C;the excellency of strength,&#x201D; for by saying to him, &#x201C;live,&#x201D; meant that he would constantly draw life-force from the source of the waters of life. &#x201C;And let his men numbered&#x201D; was said in response to &#x201C;excellency in dignity,&#x201D; meaning that each one would himself be an essential member of the community.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; Hear, O God, the voice of Yehuda &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 33:7)</p>
<p>A blessing for Shimon is hinted in this statement.<sup><xref rid="fn362">47</xref></sup> The twelve tribes represent all of the limbs of the <italic>Shechina</italic>, the Divine presence, as mentioned in the Zohar (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 241a). Reuven (meaning, &#x201C;you shall <italic>see</italic> a son&#x201D;) is the eyes of the <italic>Shechina</italic>, for he always has a clear view of the blessed God. Shimon (meaning &#x201C;one who <italic>hears</italic>&#x201D;) is the ears of the <italic>Shechina</italic>, and Yehuda is the heart of the <italic>Shechina</italic>, for he has a clean and refined heart. This is the meaning of the verse, &#x201C;Hear, O God, the voice of Yehuda,&#x201D; that the tribe of Shimon should hear the voice of Yehuda. This is because the tribe of Shimon must constantly undergo refinement, as is explained in <italic>Parshat Toldot</italic> on the verse, &#x201C;and Yitschok loved Eisav.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn363">48</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and bring him [Yehuda] unto his people &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 33:7)</p>
<p>In order that he may find favor in the eyes of his people, for Yehuda is constantly in a state of dispute with Efriam, as is explained in <italic>Parshat Vayeishev</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn364">49</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; let his hands be sufficient for him, and may You be a help for him against his adversaries.&#x201D;</italic> (Devarim, 33:7)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Let his hands be sufficient for him&#x201D; means that he should by himself find enough power in his own hands to be successful in war against his adversaries. &#x201C;May You be a help for him against his adversaries&#x201D; means that even in a place where he would not have the power to effect something, that there too he shall receive the salvations of God. This is as our sages said (<italic>Chullin</italic>, 46a), &#x201C;[regarding what must be intact in an animal&#x2019;s liver for it to be kosher] there must be one olive&#x2019;s size in the region of the gall-bladder and an olive&#x2019;s size in the most vital place.&#x201D; The liver is the source of anger that would cause one to take revenge. This is &#x201C;an olive&#x2019;s size in the most vital place,&#x201D; in other words, &#x201C;let his hands be sufficient for him.&#x201D; &#x201C;And an olive&#x2019;s size in the gall-bladder&#x201D; means a place where there is absolutely no ablility to act from his own side, and this is &#x201C;may You be a help for him against his adversaries.&#x201D; Therefore, the event just preceding this passage from the Gemara reads, &#x201C;An army once was stationed at Pumbedita. Rabba and Rav Yosef fled the town and were met on the way by Rav Zeira, who said to them, &#x2018;Fugitives&#x0021; Remember the olive&#x2019;s bulk of which the Rabbis spoke must be found in the region of the gall-bladder.&#x2019;&#x201D; The meaning is that they should have remembered that the blessed God will give His salvations only from His side, even if they did not have the power in to act on their own. Understand deeply.</p>
<p>With the help of the One who forms mountains, is completed the order of <italic>Devarim</italic>.</p>
<p>And with the assistance of the One who gives strength, is finished and completed the order of the Torah.</p>
<h1><bold>NOTES</bold></h1>
<ftnote id="fn316">1. Rashi notes that the <italic>Shechina</italic> was trying to hasten their entrance into the land.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn317">2. It says there: The ninth hints at the attribute of Yoseph the <italic>Tsaddik</italic> [the <italic>sefirah</italic> of] <italic>Yesod</italic>&#x2013;foundation, and there is something hidden within it. This is as it says in the Holy Zohar [<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 3a], &#x201C;[because nine is the Hebrew letter <italic>tet</italic>, the first letter in <italic>tov</italic> or good] letter <italic>tet</italic>, your good is closed within you and hidden within you.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn318">3. For several reasons, among them that when it is clear to all that God reigns over all, any lesser ruler, kings, or even the forces of Heaven will be ashamed in comparison, and also because they were objects of idolatry. (Ibn Ezra)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn319">4. Saying just &#x201C;the nations&#x201D; because they are not receiving God&#x2019;s strength, and &#x201C;all the heavens&#x201D; because what seems true on the surface is not so in the depths.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn324">9. It seems that &#x201C;thousand,&#x201D; &#x201C;<italic>eleph</italic>,&#x201D; in Hebrew, is the same word as &#x201C;learn,&#x201D; &#x201C;<italic>aleph</italic>,&#x201D; in Aramaic, meaning that &#x201C;once you learn these three attributes.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn325">10. This is quite striking, as it would seem that one would be willing to give over his life in this world. But what does it mean &#x201C;to give over your life in the world to come&#x201D; for the sake of the <italic>mitzvot</italic>? Here are two possible solutions. It has been said that the true test of the sincerity of an action is if one is willing to do that action for all eternity. &#x201C;The world to come&#x201D; is eternity, and thus one would be willing to stake their eternity on the performance of the <italic>mitzvot</italic>. A second solution could be that this is hinting at the necessity to go outside of the principles of the words of Torah in order to fulfill God&#x2019;s will, thereby forfeiting his &#x201C;world to come.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn326">11. All this explains the absence of &#x201C;all your <italic>muchness</italic>&#x201D; in the second section of <italic>Shema</italic>, corresponding to after it is clear what his portion is, and only for that to be greatly willing to deliver over his soul.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn327">12. <italic>Reyach</italic> means scent, and its letters are found in the Hebrew word for Jericho.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn328">13. This is discussing whether or not to leave a candle lit on the eve of Yom Kippur. One says that if there is light he is less likely to engage in intimate relations, and another says if it is dark and he does not see his wife, then he will be less likely to succumb. Both opinions are in order to distance one from sin.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn329">14. See the Gemara, <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic> 4a. Many commentaries point out that this seems to contradict the Mishna in <italic>Pirke Avot</italic>, &#x201C;do not perform the commandments in order to receive a reward.&#x201D; The Maharal of Prague explains that if one is doing a mitzvah for the sake of the Holy One, blessed be He, then even if he expects to receive some reward, he is considered righteous.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn330">15. This can be understood through what Rashi explains. <italic>Sheger</italic>. The increase, or young animal, is that which the female casts forth [<italic>meshageret</italic>] from her womb, meaning without her conscious input.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn333">18. I do not know the source of this concept. Perhaps it is mentioned in the Zohar, the Bahir, or the <italic>Sefer Yetsira</italic>. It may be connected to the &#x201C;six sides&#x201D; denoting <italic>Tiferet</italic> or <italic>Zeir Anpin</italic>, including the six lower <italic>sefirot</italic> from <italic>Hesed</italic> to <italic>Yesod</italic>.</ftnote>

They told him to swear on a Torah scroll, and before doing so, he said to his lender, &#x201C;hold my cane,&#x201D; inside of which he had hidden the amount owed. He then swore on the Torah that all the money he owed he had paid to his hand. Which, of course, only he could know was true. The lender was furious at the apparent false oath and broke the cane, the money spilling onto the floor.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn336">21. <italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic>, 25a. Rabbi Yehoshua had calculated the new month, and came out on a different day than Raban Gamliel, so Raban Gamliel made him swear that he would visit him using his (Rabbi Yehoshua&#x2019;s) calculation, on his Yom Kippur, with his staff and his money. Eventually Rabbi Yehoshua did so, and Raban Gamliel kissed him and called him &#x201C;my student, my teacher.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn340">25. <italic>Korban</italic>, sacrifice in Hebrew, is close to the word <italic>karev</italic>, &#x201C;come close,&#x201D; having little to do with the etymology of the English word sacrifice. Through offering the <italic>korban</italic>, one comes close to God.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn343">28. <italic>Tekifut</italic>, see note 61, <italic>Sefer Shemot</italic>. Also, the word used here for place, <italic>yad</italic>, also means arm, as in the expression &#x201C;an arm of strength,&#x201D; <italic>yad chazaka</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn344">29. There it explains how one must not benefit from something when the depth of its purpose is not apparent. With King David, in Shmuel 1, Chapter 30, he did not want to benefit from the war spoils, for any benefit of the spoils of Amalek was against God&#x2019;s law. Even though he did not join with their intention, and his own intention was for the sake of Heaven, it says in Mishlei, (1:15) &#x201C;do not go in the way with them,&#x201D; meaning that even if you do not go with them, still, refrain from giving the appearance that you are going with them. See the entire passage there for a clearer understanding.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn345">30. <italic>Lehagid</italic>, to tell, denotes difficulty, similar to <italic>gid</italic>, or sinew, as opposed to <italic>amira</italic>,&#x201D; saying the language of softness.</ftnote>

Truly, the Holy One, blessed be He, is filled with good will to diffuse goodness to Israel and <italic>Bamibar</italic> &#x201C;will not see any iniquity in Jacob&#x201D; (Numbers 23:21). Therefore when accusations come from the stranger, orphan, and widow, they arouse transgression. Yet when Israel separates tithes and gives them to the strangers and orphans and widows, and the accusations cease, then man can say before God to look at him individually, for then God only looks at the good. On this it says of future good (Yesahya 11:13), &#x201C;Efriam will not be jealous of Yehuda and Yehuda will not distress Efriam,&#x201D; and by itself only good will be aroused concerning them. This is why the heavens are called here <italic>maon</italic>, or dwelling, as it says in the Gemara (<italic>Chagigah</italic> 12b), &#x201C;a dwelling [<italic>maon</italic>] where legions of ministering angels who sing at night and are silent in the day, in honor of Israel.&#x201D; From here begins the revelation of God&#x2019;s good for Israel that, as it were, contracts the supernal glory from the song of the angels, in order to make room to include the songs of Israel, and from here is diffused only good. <italic>Giliyon Mei HaShiloach</italic>, by the Isbitser&#x2019;s grandson, Gershon Henoch Lainer of Radzin.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn348">33. This is one of the four matters that perplexed King Shlomo, that one involved in promiscuity would not fear God and look at the end of his actions [Ibn Ezra]. <italic>Almah</italic> is here translated as &#x201C;woman,&#x201D; but it really means a young woman no longer a virgin [Metsudat Tsion], and he is also perplexed that no signs of the action remain for either involved, as would be recognizable with a virgin [Metsudat David]. The Holy Isbitser will interpret this in a different realm from these commentators.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn349">34. Simply put, all, from the highest to the lowest, are deeply connected to God, and it seems that &#x201C;the way of man with woman&#x201D; is being taken out of the context of physical union, to say that it is a wonder to King Shlomo how all elements in Israel at their core experience an intense spiritual union with God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn350">35. See note 23.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn351">36. In Chapters 6 and 7 of the book of Yehoshua, it relates how the spoils of the battle of Jericho were banned, saying, &#x201C;cursed be the man who rises up and builds of this city.&#x201D;Achan had taken some of the spoils, and God related to Yehoshua that because of this 30,000 of his men were killed in the battle of Ai that followed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn352">37. Perhaps because when one is disturbed by something he may be inclined to move his place.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn353">38. This phrase is borrowed from Tehillim 51:7. The idea needs investigation. Was he not conceived in the mitzvah of <italic>pru u&#x2019;vru</italic>, [be fruitful and multiply]? Yet this is something that is very easily contaminated because of its great holiness. So this statement, especially when someone on the level of David haMelech says it about himself, is quite revealing of the human predicament. It seems here that along with the fixings needed for physical union, he is also talking about everything inherited from our parents that needs fixing.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn354">39. The prophet said, in Yesahya 8:9, &#x201C;give ear, all the expanses of the earth.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn356">41. The word <italic>petaltol</italic> in Hebrew is not really &#x201C;crooked,&#x201D; but as Rashi points out, an intensive form of <italic>petil</italic>, or wick, like a string wrapped many times around a wick to make it thick.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn357">42. <italic>Sinai</italic> is close to the word for hate, <italic>sina</italic>, and so our sages creatively interpret the term in the Gemara. (<italic>Sanhedrin</italic>)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn358">43. &#x201C;Shined&#x201D; or <italic>zarach</italic>, like the first rays of the sun to be seen over the horizon, and not a more intensive term.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn359">44. They crowded together, even in the face of imminent danger at being crushed, to receive the presence of the Divine.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn360">45. It may be added that those who study the Torah for the sake of all of Israel manage to raise up Israel who were lowered for lack of involvement in it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn361">46. Iggulim&#x2014;creation ex nihilo where the ten <italic>sefirot</italic> emerged as concentric circles within the empty space, related to the idea of God&#x2019;s general providence over the universe. Yosher, where the ten <italic>sefirot</italic> took the form of right, left, and middle columns, in the form of man, which emerged concurrently with the emergence of various stages of the Igullim, the structure in which most of the <italic>kabbalah</italic> and writings in the Zohar are understood, relating to <italic>hashgacha pratit</italic>, God&#x2019;s individual providence with each soul in Israel. See Eyts Chaiim, Heichal Adam Kadmon, Gate 1, Branch 2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn362">47. This is because the name Shimon means &#x201C;one who hears.&#x201D; Shimon did not receive a separate blessing from Moshe, and Rashi notes that Moshe was still angry with him for mass fornication with the Moabite women in Shittim [<italic>Bamidbar</italic>, 25:1].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn363">48. Where it says: Shimon, however, (as opposed to Levi) entered himself into uncertainty, saying, &#x201C;God forbid I would consider myself licentious,&#x201D; and marrying Dinah. Thus he entered himself into a situation that needed clarification, saying he trusts that God will make it clear that it was good, that his intention was not only to take her out from Shchem and all his intentions were for the sake of Heaven. Therefore the tribe of Shimon needed all these kinds of clarifications, such as Zimri who also said that his intention was good, as explained in its place (<italic>Parshat Balak</italic>). And in the future, when the tribe of Shimon will be clarified, its level will be greater than Levi.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn364">49. This is as it is said (Yesahya, 11:13), &#x201C;Efriam shall not be jealous of Yehuda, and Yehuda shall not distress Efriam.&#x201D; These two tribes were always opposing each other, for the force of life that the blessed God gave to Efriam (from Yosef) was of the nature that it always looked to every action regarding its judgment and law, without moving from it. Therefore, when the writings warn Israel against sinning, then the aim of the Torah will be to say (Amos, 5:6), &#x201C;lest the house of Yosef should prevail like fire,&#x201D; meaning that they should concern themselves that there should be no opponents to their actions. The root of life for Yehuda, however, is to look to the blessed God regarding the course of every action. Even though he sees where the judgment leans, still he looks to the blessed God in order to see the depth of the truth of the matter. It could be that even though the judgment is true according to the claims of the plaintiffs, yet still it is not at the deepest level of truth, for fear that one would make a false claim.</ftnote>
<ftnote>This is as we find (<italic>Nedarim</italic>, 25a) in the case of Rava&#x2019;s cane. (One had not paid another a debt, and the other asserted that he had paid it. They told him to swear on a Torah scroll, and before doing so, he said to his lender, &#x201C;hold my cane,&#x201D; inside of which he had hidden the amount owed. He then swore on the Torah that all the money he owed he had paid to his hand. Which, of course, only he could know was true. The lender was furious at the apparent false oath and broke the cane, the money spilling onto the floor.) So it is with all matters, and this is the root of life for Yehuda, to look to God in everything and not to act simply in a way that is accepted or habitual. Even though yesterday he acted in such a way, yet anyhow, today he does not want to rely on his former response, only that the blessed God should illuminate His will into him anew. This matter sometimes necessitates even doing something against the law, for &#x201C;it is a time to do for God, the Torah has been suspended&#x201D; (Tehillim, 119:126). In this way these two tribes oppose each other. Of the future it is said that, &#x201C;Efriam will not be jealous of Yehuda, and Yehuda will not distress Efriam.&#x201D; Then Efriam will not accuse Yehuda for the times when he goes outside of the law. He will not trouble him over this, because the blessed God will show Efriam the intentions of Yehuda, that his intentions are for the sake of Heaven and not for his own benefit. Then, of itself, there will be peace between them.</ftnote>

<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Let your eyes be on the field where they are reaping &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Ruth, 2:9)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Let your eyes be on the field&#x201D; means the ability to expand outward. &#x201C;Where they are reaping&#x201D; means that surely it will be completed for the good. There is sowing, and there is reaping. &#x201C;Sowing&#x201D; is when one first accepts upon himself the yoke of the sovereignty of heaven. At that time he must constrict himself against running after the object of his lust. This is as it is said (in the third section of the <italic>Shema</italic>, concerning <italic>tsitsit, Bamidbar</italic>, 15:36), &#x201C;so you will not seek out after your eyes and after your hearts.&#x201D; On this it is said in the Tehillim (126:5), &#x201C;those who sow in tears [will reap in joy].&#x201D; &#x201C;Tears&#x201D; signifies constriction. This is understood in the laws of <italic>truma</italic> (tithes). The Gemara comments on the verse (<italic>Shemot</italic>, 22:28), &#x201C;do not delay in giving the produce of your winepresses (<italic>Dima&#x2019;acha</italic> the same as the word for tears, which Rashi says refers to required tithes).&#x201D; There it says that even one grain of wheat that must be tithed is mixed into a measure of wheat that is exempt, then the whole measure must be tithed.<sup><xref rid="fn365">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>This all concerns the time of sowing. However, in the time of reaping, when man&#x2019;s heart is sufficiently refined, and he only desires that which is God&#x2019;s will, then man is permitted to extend as befits his will. On this it says, &#x201C;let your eyes be on the field where they reap,&#x201D; meaning that in the time of reaping it is permitted to seek out after your eyes.<sup><xref rid="fn366">2</xref></sup> &#x201C;Field&#x201D; signifies expansion into one&#x2019;s desires. This is why Eisav was described as (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 25:27) &#x201C;a man of the field,&#x201D; for he went after his heart with all of his desires. However, when one&#x2019;s heart is not yet purified, it is forbidden to expand outward. Then at the time when his heart is refined, it is called &#x201C;the scent of a field that God has blessed.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn367">3</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;God shall pay you for your work, and your reward shall be complete &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Ruth, 2:12)</p>
<p>In the Midrash on Ruth it is written (Ruth Rabba, 5:4), &#x201C;Rav Chasa said, [the reward is given] because you will take shelter under the wings of the Divine Presence.&#x201D; &#x201C;Your reward shall be complete&#x201D; means that every action will be called in your name, whether in thought or in deed. Yet truly, the realm of thought is in the hands of the blessed God. Therefore Rav Chasa said, &#x201C;because you came to take shelter under His wings,&#x201D; namely, that of your own initiative you came to take refuge with God and to ascribe all your actions to the blessed God. Therefore the blessed God responds in kind, by calling even thoughts<sup><xref rid="fn368">4</xref></sup> the actions of man. This is the meaning of the name of Rav Chasa, for there is a principle that the sages of the Talmud are called in the name of their teaching. <italic>Chasa</italic>, is directly related to &#x201C;<italic>Chusa</italic>&#x2014;taking refuge,&#x201D; as in &#x201C;taking refuge in the shadow of His wings.&#x201D; This is as it is written in the Midrash (Shir HaShirim Rabba, 23:25), &#x201C;what is &#x2018;with the crown with which His mother crowned Him.&#x2019; (Shir HaShirim 3)? This is likened to a king who loved his daughter so much, that he was not satisfied with calling her &#x2018;daughter&#x2019; or &#x2018;sister,&#x2019; and could only thoroughly express his love for her when he called her &#x2018;his mother.&#x2019; [For there are various verses where God likens Israel to a daughter or a sister, and here in the present verse He calls Israel &#x2018;His mother.&#x2019;]&#x201D;</p>
<p>Since David haMelech had said (Divrei haYamim 1, 29:14), &#x201C;all things have come from You, from Your own hand have we given to You,&#x201D; meaning that he ascribed all the actions of man to the blessed God, for this precisely, &#x201C;He [God] could thoroughly express his love for her until He called her &#x2018;His mother.&#x2019; &#x201D; &#x201C;Mother&#x201D; means thought (as the mother gives birth to the child, so does thought give birth to action). Thus even the realm of thought will then be called in your name. This is as it is written in the Midrash (<italic>Bamidbar</italic> Rabba, 12:18), &#x201C;it told to Moshe concerning the sacrifices which they brought at the inauguration of the Tabernacle, &#x201C;take from them.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn369">5</xref></sup> Moshe Rabeynu&#x2019;s mind had weakened when he saw that the action of the princes. Then the blessed God told him to take that which the princes had brought, for this was the work of their hands. Thus the prince Netanel ben Tsoar had raised (presented) this advice, for he knew that, &#x201C;God had placed wisdom in his mouth&#x201D; (Mishlei, 2:6). For this, the matter was called in their name, as explained in its place in <italic>Parshat Nasso</italic> (last selection).</p>

<chapter>
<title>M<small>EGILLAT</small> K<small>OHELLET</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;It is good to take hold of this, and from this you should not remove your hand &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Kohellet, 7:18)</p>
<p>The blessed God commanded Israel to serve Him in two ways; with the active performance of an action, and with refraining from action. This is what Shlomo haMelech meant when he said, &#x201C;take hold of this, and from this do not remove.&#x201D; In other words, if you are to fulfill the will of the blessed God through the active performance of an action, then do so with careful consideration and deliberation. The only way to fulfill the blessed God&#x2019;s will in completeness is if it is done completely for the sake of Heaven, and this requires careful consideration of all actions, even with the performance of a mitzvah. Also, at the time when one fulfills the will of the blessed God through refraining from action, such as the observance of the Shabbat and the like, it must also be done with careful consideration. This means not to refrain from action because of laziness, but rather the refrain of action must also be done with alacrity. This means that a man will want to do forbidden work on the Shabbat but will actively refrain from it.</p>
<p>This is as it is written (Yeshayahu, 28:18), &#x201C;if you turn away your foot on the Shabbat,&#x201D; meaning that a man wants to go and do something, but he remembers that it is Shabbat and actively restrains his feet from taking him to do it. A man who is constantly involved in serving the blessed God will fulfill each mitzvah with both aspects. Thus the active performance of a mitzvah will receive an illumination from the careful consideration of the prohibitive commandments, and the prohibitive commandments will be done with alacrity from an illumination from the active performance of <italic>mitzvot</italic>.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Rejoice, young man, in your youth, and let your heart improve you in the days of your youth, and go in the ways of your heart &#x2026; yet know that for all you do God will bring you to judgment.&#x201D;</italic> (Kohellet, 11:9)</p>
<p>It is written in the Gemara (<italic>Shabbat</italic>, 30b), &#x201C;the sages wanted to conceal the book of Kohellet for it seemed that it contained words which contradicted the Torah.&#x201D; In the Torah it is written, &#x201C;do not seek after your eyes,&#x201D; and Kohellet says, &#x201C;Rejoice, young man.&#x201D; If the lash (the warnings of the Torah) were put aside, then the result might be saying, &#x201C;there is no judgment and no judge.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn370">6</xref></sup> Since they saw that he had said, &#x201C;for all you do God will bring you to judgment,&#x201D; they then said, &#x201C;Shlomo has said well.&#x201D; It is a known thing that in the future the blessed God will refine all the actions of Israel until all sin will be completely removed. Therefore it is said (Yeshayahu, 63:1), &#x201C;He is great in saving.&#x201D; This means that he gave great advice concerning the eventual merit and salvations before Him. Therefore it says, &#x201C;rejoice, young man, in your youth,&#x201D; meaning in all your expansions, will arrive at its final rectification and a good end.</p>
<p>Eventually everything will be understood as how it was the will of the blessed God. Then that which had been done in greater expansion will be the choicest of actions. Therefore it says, &#x201C;know that for all you do God will bring you to judgment,&#x201D; for there also is a judgment for everything. This is as it is said by way of example (Kohellet Rabba, 11:13), &#x201C;If one tells you, swim in the river, do not swim too far, for you will then have to swim back.&#x201D; Even if you can get where you are going, it will then be difficult for you to return. Similarly Shlomo haMelech warns not to expand too much in the matters of this world, for you will have to then return to a place of judgment, meaning to the will of the blessed God. Then a man will have to suffer from this before he achieves refinement. This is why they wanted to conceal Kohellet, because first he gives brazen strength to Israel (in saying, &#x201C;rejoice, young man, in your youth&#x201D;), but when they saw afterward that he said that all will be according to judgment, they said, &#x201C;Shlomo has said well.&#x201D;</p>

<chapter>
<title>S<small>EFER</small> Y<small>EHOSHUA</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And it was, when the</italic> Cohanim, <italic>carrying the ark of the covenant of God, came up out of the Jordan river, the soles of the feet of the</italic> Cohanim <italic>were transferred onto the dry land &#x2026; [The Jordan had been split for the arrival of the children of Israel into the land]</italic>.&#x201D; (Yehoshua, 4:18)</p>
<p>The geographical entity of the Jordan river corresponds to the liver in man, which teaches of anger. This is as we find in the Gemara (<italic>Nedarim</italic>, 22b), &#x201C;Ulla was entering Israel by way of the Jordan with two companions. One of the companions slew the other, not quite killing him. He then asked Ulla, &#x2018;did I do well?&#x2019; Ulla told him to slit his throat [both in fearing that he would then slay Ulla, and also to end his pain]. Reb Yochanan asked Ulla, &#x2018;how could you encourage such violence in the land of Israel?&#x2019; Ulla replied, &#x2018;we had not yet crossed the Jordan.&#x2019;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn371">7</xref></sup> The geographical entity of the Se&#x00E0; of Reeds (<italic>Yam Suf</italic>) corresponds to the spinal column in man, which represents desire. (Perhaps as a direct connection from the head to the genitalia.) When Moshe Rabeynu had split the Sea of Reeds, he was elevating all of Israel above any desire that could overpower them, and thus they crossed over on dry land (signifying conquering of desire). When Yehoshua split the Jordan, which corresponds to anger, he enabled all of Israel to overcome their anger. Yet the <italic>Cohanim</italic> passed over all the waters of the Jordan (as it seems, they stood at first on the water, in Chapter 3, verse 8), for the <italic>Cohen</italic> is the servant of God, and his anger is the wrath of Torah scholars (a kind of permitted wrath in the honor of the Torah), which is good from all sides (Zohar, <italic>Shemot</italic>, 182b).</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Then Yehoshua spoke to God &#x2026; the sun and moon shall still in Givon &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Yehoshua, 10:12)</p>
<p>It is written in the tractate <italic>Avoda Zara</italic> (25a) &#x201C;that day was the length of two days.&#x201D; Moshe Rabeynu&#x2019;s task was the Torah, and Yehoshua&#x2019;s task was action, as our sages have said (Midrash Sochar Tov, 21), &#x201C;He gave majesty [<italic>hod</italic>] to Moshe and beauty [<italic>hadar</italic>] to Yehoshua.&#x201D; <italic>Hod</italic> represents the internal aspect and <italic>hadar</italic> represents the appearance from the outside, as is explained in the Mei HaShiloach, <italic>Parshat Vayaqhel</italic> (second selection). Moshe Rabeynu was in the desert, and he experienced Shabbat through refraining from action, for Shabbat represents knowing the name of God in everything, as is explained. Yehoshua was among those who entered the land, and he experienced Shabbat through active performance of action. Therefore the sun stood still in order to include one of the days of the week in his Shabbat, and this hints that the very action was the day of Shabbat.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;God spoke unto Yehoshua, saying: Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, make cities of refuge, of which I have already spoke with you through Moshe.&#x201D;</italic> (Yehoshua, 20:1&#x2013;2)</p>
<p>Why is the subject of the cities of refuge taught in the book of Yehoshua?<sup><xref rid="fn372">8</xref></sup> Moshe Rabeynu had taken from the portion of Yehoshua when he had conquered the lands of Sichon and Og, and divided their lands as Israel&#x2019;s inheritance. Conquering and dividing the land was the portion of Yehoshua. Corresponding to this, Yehoshua also apprehended some of Moshe Rabeynu&#x2019;s portion. This very verse in question is formulated exactly in the way God spoke to Moshe, saying, &#x201C;God spoke unto Yehoshua, saying: Speak to the children of Israel.&#x201D; This matter is explained in the Gemara in the chapter, &#x201C;how do you define the city limits&#x201D; (<italic>Eruvin</italic>, 52b). &#x201C;With several houses in a row, if one house stands outside the line and another on the inside, or in a wall, if one turret protrudes outside of the wall and another recedes.&#x201D; This is discussing the interconnection of souls. &#x201C;One house is on the inside of the line and another is on the outside&#x201D; hints at degrees and levels of good, where one enters it into another, and another to another, and in this way they connect.<sup><xref rid="fn373">9</xref></sup> &#x201C;One turret protrudes and another recedes&#x201D; teaches of the opposite, for also one&#x2019;s deficiencies can enter into another somewhat. The subject of why the cities of refuge are in the portion of Moshe is explained in the holy Zohar in <italic>Parshat Mishpatim</italic> (114b) on the verse, &#x201C;and I have set aside a place for you.&#x201D; &#x201C;This is the commandment to set aside cities of refuge for one who killed was given to you because of the Egyptian that you killed in Egypt. He had the primordial snake and all its brood surrounding him. Then you killed him before his time, and did not fear his brood chasing after you. This was when several women in your youth had chased after you. Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, gave you the cities of refuge to flee to, and they are the gates of repentance.&#x201D; So too was Yehoshua close to Avizraiu, who killed another inadvertently.</p>
<p>Yehoshua had constantly yearned to understand the profundity of the Torah, and the true depth that he sought could not be achieved during the lifetime of Moshe Rabeynu. By means of his great exertion, yearning, and prayer, he managed to effect the death of Moshe Rabeynu. When Moshe Rabeynu realized this, then God illuminated into Moshe Rabeynu that he himself should plead for mercy on behalf of Yehoshua, for Moshe also greatly desired the welfare of Yehoshua, and then of itself Yehoshua could not do anything against the life of Moshe. We find this in the Torah when Moshe prayed for Yehoshua. Because of the great bewilderment that Moshe Rabeynu experienced when he understood this, the Holy One, blessed be He, illuminated this understanding into Moshe (to pray for his welfare). So it was that all the Torah that was revealed to Moshe Rabeynu was revealed to him as a result of great bewilderment that the blessed God had sent him, and it was all necessary for him.</p>

<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Shaul said nothing on that day, for he said, something has happened, he is not clean, behold he is not clean.&#x201D;</italic> (Shmuel 1, 20:26)</p>
<p>The word <italic>ci</italic>, &#x201C;because of,&#x201D; in this verse is understood in the sense of &#x201C;for behold.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn374">10</xref></sup> This usage gives an explanation as to why this verse was said. Shaul asserted that he understood his own nature at its root, and that he was deficient in this capacity (purity). The blessed God had entrusted the storehouse of purity to this tribe (Yehuda); therefore their dealings and affairs were constantly involved in refining this aspect. This is seen in the incidents with Tamar, who was the progenitor of the Royal Davidic line, as is explained in its place (Mei HaShiloach, <italic>Parshat Vayeishev</italic>, on the verse, &#x201C;and Er&#x201D;). So too with Bat Sheva and the daughter of Pharaoh. The Blessed God clarified all of their actions, and made it clear that it was all God&#x2019;s doing. (Like the statement of the Gemara, when Yehuda said of Tamar, &#x201C;She is more righteous than I [<italic>mimeni</italic>],&#x201D; that this was God saying, &#x201C;the entire incident came forth from Me [<italic>mimeni</italic>].&#x201D;) Thus the stone representing Yehuda in the High Priest&#x2019;s breastplate, the <italic>Choshen Mishpat</italic>, was the <italic>nofech</italic>, or carbuncle.<sup><xref rid="fn375">11</xref></sup> The numerical equivalent of the three letters in <italic>nofech</italic> (<italic>nun</italic> &#x003D; 50, <italic>peh</italic> &#x003D; 80, <italic>chaf</italic> &#x003D; 20) is 150. David haMelech thus included 150 chapters in the book of Tehillim. The letter and number <italic>nun</italic>, fifty, teaches of purity.<sup><xref rid="fn376">12</xref></sup> Thus three times <italic>nun</italic>, fifty, 150, represents the absolute completeness of purity (as anything done three times represents completeness). Shlomo haMelech had fashioned the brass laver used to wash the hands and feet of the <italic>Cohanim</italic> in the Holy Temple, called the <italic>yam</italic> [sea] <italic>hanechoshet</italic>, which contained exactly 150 <italic>mikvot</italic> or ritual baths (<italic>Eruvin</italic>, 14a).<sup><xref rid="fn377">13</xref></sup> Furthermore, Shlomo haMelech composed the books of Mishlei (Proverbs), Shir haShirim (Canticles), and Kohellet (Ecclesiastes), which total fifty chapters, aside from the last chapter in Mishlei, which is the <italic>Parsha</italic> of <italic>Eishet Chayil</italic>, the &#x201C;Woman of Valor.&#x201D;</p>

<p>In saying &#x201C;twelve thousand,&#x201D; he was saying to gather as many men as he could. Truly, he knew the strength of David haMelech, which was to arouse great Divine compassion through his prayer. Thus he said specifically, &#x201C;twelve thousand,&#x201D; in thinking that when confronted with this number, David would trust in the strength of his own prayer, and not make special efforts to increase his prayer. Then, Achitophel assumed, he could conquer David, because of the weakness of David&#x2019;s sin, which Achitophel had publicized. This is as it is written in the Gemara (<italic>Sanhedrin</italic>, 44b), &#x201C;A sin which is not made known can be easily rectified. A sin which is revealed is difficult to rectify.&#x201D;</p>

<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Then Adoniya son of Chagit elevated himself to say, I will rule &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Melachim 1, 1:5)</p>
<p>Adoniya was truly a righteous man, clean of all strange lusts, sure of himself that he was clean and refined of anything vile. Then when his heart was aroused to take Avishag the Shunamite he assumed that it was surely from the will of the blessed God that the kingdom was his, and with it her. From this, he elevated himself in saying, &#x201C;I will rule.&#x201D; Therefore when it was sent to Shlomo haMelech to give Avishag to Adoniya, Shlomo had understood in his wisdom that surely Adoniya would not harbor any strange lusts, but only that which he had seized in his mind that even the right to rule was his. This is why Shlomo answered (Melachim 1, 2:22), &#x201C;why do you ask him just for Avishag? Ask him also for the kingdom.&#x201D; Then Shlomo saw that in the depth of Adoniya&#x2019;s heart he was rebelling against the kingdom, and this swore, &#x201C;as God lives &#x2026; just as I am king, so shall Adoniya on this day be put to death.&#x201D; The desire for Avishag had really come to him from his desire for rulership.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And you shall hear, O Heavens, the place of Your dwelling, and You may forgive, and do, and give to man according to his actions, and You will know his heart, for You alone know the hearts of all men.&#x201D;</italic> (Melachim 1, 8:39)</p>
<p>Whereas with the stranger (<italic>Nochri</italic> or perhaps Gentile, when this exact speech at the inauguration of the First Temple is repeated) it is written, &#x201C;(Divrei haYamim 2, 6:33), &#x201C;and do according to all that the stranger calls from You.&#x201D; Since Israel at the depths of his heart truly does not desire anything against the will of the blessed God, therefore when he prays for any good, if it is correct in the eyes of the blessed God to give it, he will receive it. If not, then He will remove the desire from him, and he will no longer desire this and ask for its materialization through his prayer.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And Shlomo haMelech loved many foreign women, and along with Pharaoh&#x2019;s daughter, women of the Moabites, Ammorites, Edomites, Tseidonites, and Hittites.&#x201D;</italic> (Melachim 1, 11:1)</p>
<p>All the power of the nations is in their women, and in particular in their princesses. Therefore he chose to gather the princesses of the nations in order to bring their power into the realm of <italic>Kedusha</italic>. &#x201C;Moabites&#x201D; is the power of eating and drinking. (See Mei HaShiloach, <italic>Parshat Beshalach</italic>, in the selection, &#x201C;Over against it shall you encamp.&#x201D;) Ammonites are the power of lust. The power of the Tseidonites is in their wealth. Hittites is the power of valor and strength.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Then King Rechavoam sent Adoram, who was over the forced labor; and all Israel stoned him with stones, and he died. Therefore King Rechavoam exerted to mount his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.&#x201D;</italic> (Melachim 1, 12:18)</p>
<p>The matter is discussed in the Gemara (<italic>Sanhedrin</italic>, 48b), &#x2018;Rechavoam had an issue.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn378">14</xref></sup> This shows his sin, for &#x201C;issue&#x201D; means rushing and preceding the proper time, even though afterward the kingdom would be his. And thus, in the future the kingdom of the house of David will spread over all of Israel, yet here, with Rechavoam, he preceded his time, in exerting to mount his chariot.&#x201D;</p>

<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Menashe was twelve years old when he began to rule, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem, and the name of his mother was Cheftsi Ba.&#x201D;</italic> (Melachim 2, 21:1)</p>
<p>Menashe was born in a state of great fear of God, so much that no man could stand this level of fear. Truly with all kings, the attribute of fear was tremendous, as it says in the Gemara (<italic>Berachot</italic>, 34b), &#x201C;when the king bows<sup><xref rid="fn379">15</xref></sup> he does not return to the upright position&#x201D; (signifying intense fear). Menashe possessed the greatest level of fear, and all the sins that he had transgressed were only because he was pleading with God for advice as to how to remove this state of fear from upon him, in order that he could operate with free choice. This is because such an overpowering state of fear in man causes the removal of his power of free choice. It was decreed from heaven that he was born into such great fear, which is the opposite of David haMelech, whose dominant characteristic was that of the love of God.

<p>All the positive commandments are called &#x201C;the vessels of God.&#x201D; Therefore the prophet is warning man, &#x201C;be pure of heart, you who carry the vessels of God,&#x201D; meaning you yourself, when you perform the positive commandments, see to it that you refine yourself from all the negative commandments.<sup><xref rid="fn380">16</xref></sup> For example, when your hands take hold of the <italic>etrog</italic> (citron) to fulfill the positive commandment during the Succot festival, be sure that your hands are clean of any sins that could be done with the hands. In this way you will be performing the <italic>mitzvot</italic> in a state of completeness.</p>

<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Take with you words, and return to God, and when you say these unto Him, take away all sins, and take good, the utterance of your lips will take the place of bulls.&#x201D;</italic> (Hoshea, 14:3)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Take away all sins&#x201D; means that you will gather all sins (to be refined before God) of each and every one, until there will not even remain a residue of sin in our hearts (with the final redemption), God forbid.<sup><xref rid="fn381">17</xref></sup> All the while that there is a residue of sin at the root a veil remains that separates us from God. &#x201C;And take good&#x201D; means that God shall take our hearts for the good in order for the love and fear of God to be fixed in our hearts.<sup><xref rid="fn382">18</xref></sup> &#x201C;The utterance of our lips shall take the place of bulls&#x201D; means that all that we speak will be refined. Then in the very words of our mouth we will be effecting that which God wills. Thus it says specifically, &#x201C;bulls&#x2014;<italic>parim</italic>,&#x201D; for when it says bull it means a bull that has attained three years&#x2014;three signifying something that is completely refined.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Ashur will not save us, we will not ride upon horses. We will no longer call the work of our hands, &#x2018;our god.&#x2019; Only through you will mercy be aroused for the orphan.&#x201D;</italic> (Hoshea, 14:4)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Ashur [Assyria],&#x201D; represents brazen strength (<italic>tekifut</italic>) and the power of flesh and blood. This is the <italic>kelipa</italic> (evil force) of Ashur, strong in itself, and we will no longer rely on our own human strength. &#x201C;We will not ride on horses.&#x201D; &#x201C;Horse&#x201D; represents being overly hasty and acting in a haphazard state without a settled mind. &#x201C;The rider of the horse&#x201D; represents a settled consciousness, which itself is not good at times, as is explained below. &#x201C;We will no longer call the work of our hands, &#x2018;our god&#x2019;&#x201D; is saying that we will no longer put our trust in silver and gold. &#x201C;Through you shall the orphan find mercy&#x201D; means one who has no support or assistance, for we shall not find any support outside of You&#x2014;You shall be our sole reliance.</p>
<p>A settled mind is called constant, and with such a manner it is always good to act. Acting quickly is called <italic>mequdash</italic>, sanctified, for sometimes quickness of action is a very good quality. It is such when one chooses to run to a matter of the words of Torah even if he does not yet know what he is running to, but still it is very good. On this, Shlomo haMelech said (Mishlei, 21:31), &#x201C;The horse is ready for the day of battle, and salvation is up to Hashem.&#x201D; This means that in the end the blessed God will save him and show him that his running to understand the truth of the words of Torah was in good judgment. This was the sin of the prophet Hoshea who said (<italic>Pesachim</italic>, 87a), &#x201C;exchange them [Israel] for a different people.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn383">19</xref></sup> Hoshea said this out of the power of a settled mind. Then, after he realized that he had sinned, he said (Hoshea, 14:4), &#x201C;we will not ride upon horses,&#x201D; meaning that sometimes a mind that constantly exercises restraint is not always good. Therefore we must only rely upon Hashem and not on our intellect.</p>

<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Fortunate is the man who does not walk in the advice of the evil ones, and in the way of sinners does not stand, and in the dwelling place of scoffers does not sit. But rather the Torah of Hashem is his desire, and he contemplates His Torah day and night &#x2026; he shall be as a tree sated by streams of water, his leaf shall not wither, and all he does be made to succeed.&#x201D;</italic> (Tehillim,1)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Advice&#x201D; means thought. The term &#x201C;advice&#x201D; mentioned in this verse teaches of thought, meaning that he does not use his power of thought to entertain the thoughts of evil. &#x201C;In the way of sinners he does not stand&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;sin&#x201D; refers to inadvertent sins. Thus, if he had erred by sinning without his conscious intent, inadvertently, then he does not &#x201C;stand&#x201D; in this state, but immediately acts to correct that which he has perverted. &#x201C;And in the dwelling place of scoffers he does not sit.&#x201D; &#x201C;Scoffer&#x201D; or <italic>letz</italic> in Hebrew, is one who is not currently transgressing any law. Rather, he does not care to conduct himself within the boundaries that protect the law; the &#x201C;fences&#x201D; of the sages who codified the law, which guard one from later transgressing the body of the law as it was ordained in the Torah. They are scoffing at the words of the sages, considering themselves &#x201C;sitting comfortably,&#x201D; without fear that they may come to sin.</p>
<p>Their danger is greater than the first example, the &#x201C;advice of the evil ones,&#x201D; who, conversely, will surely come to many errors (and expect this). The three levels mentioned here, &#x201C;the advice of the evil ones,&#x201D; &#x201C;the way of the sinners,&#x201D; and &#x201C;the dwelling place of the scoffers,&#x201D; are three levels of advice for man to be &#x201C;turning from evil&#x201D; (see Tehillim, 34:15). Corresponding to these three, there are three levels of &#x201C;do good&#x201D; (Tehillim, 34:15). &#x201C;And his desire is in the Torah, for in the His Torah does he contemplate day and night,&#x201D; is the opposite of &#x201C;the advice of evil ones.&#x201D; &#x201C;He shall be as a tree sated by streams of water, whose leaf will not wither&#x201D; means that he strives to increase his amount of Torah understanding and good conduct, which is the opposite of the &#x201C;way of sinners,&#x201D; whose way is filled with mistakes and forgetfulness. &#x201C;All that he does shall be made to succeed&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;succeed&#x201D; is not written, but rather &#x201C;made to succeed,&#x201D; meaning that the blessed God will cause his actions to succeed in a way that is above his intellect or intentions. This corresponds to the &#x201C;dwelling place of scoffers.&#x201D; It is the opposite because he deliberately increases borders and fences around his fulfillment of the law in order to protect it, and in this way he makes it possible for him to fulfill all of the words of Torah and <italic>mitzvot</italic>. By means of this the blessed God causes his actions to succeed in a way that is above his intellect and intentions.</p>

In the morning You shall hear my voice.&#x201D; &#x201C;Listen deeply to the voice of my shouts, my King and God&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;my King&#x201D; because the blessed God loves me, and &#x201C;E-lohai, my God&#x201D; because he is my stronghold.<sup><xref rid="fn385">2</xref></sup> &#x201C;In the morning God will hear my voice, in the morning I will arrange my plea before You.&#x201D; &#x201C;Morning&#x201D; teaches of the first rays of sunlight at dawn, and the renewed blossoming of the light of day. So, too, the very first emergence of will in the heart of man before it spreads forth is called &#x201C;morning.&#x201D;</p>
<p>At this moment, while the thought has still just newly emerged, he asks the blessed God that the thought or desire not spread to a place against God&#x2019;s will. &#x201C;For You are not a God who desires evil, nor shall evil dwell with You&#x201D; can be understood through the Midrash Ta&#x2019;azria on the <italic>Parsha</italic> of <italic>nega&#x2019;im</italic> (afflictions) (Tanchuma 7), &#x201C;why does it not say here, &#x2018;Speak to the children of Israel [in <italic>Vayikra</italic>, 13:1]&#x2019;? For it is the nature of God that, &#x2018;no evil&#x2014;ya<italic>GOR</italic>cha&#x2014;shall dwell with You,&#x2019; meaning no evil does not lead&#x2014;<italic>GORER</italic>et&#x2014;Him along.&#x201D; Israel represents intense cleaving to the blessed God. Thus it says, &#x201C;for You are not a God who desires evil,&#x201D; to give a meaning for one&#x2019;s act of prayer, for truly the very first emergence of the desire to pray has come from the blessed God, and therefore no evil could come of it. However, he fears that from this point on it could spread to a place of evil. Therefore he causes an intense stir in his prayer for God to be with him to help when the thoughts and desires begin to spread out into the world, helping the effects of the desire to be clean even from an inkling of thought against God&#x2019;s will. Then it will follow that all his actions will be pure.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;I have set God before me always &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Tehillim, 16:8)</p>
<p>When a man greatly yearns for something, he should see that the object of his desire is the will of the blessed God. He should not say that, &#x201C;since I desire it so greatly then it must be the will of the blessed God.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;As for the actions of man, from the word of Your lips, I have guarded myself from lawless ways. You support my steps on Your way &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Tehillim, 17:4)</p>
<p>&#x201C;As for the actions of man, from the word of Your lips.&#x201D; David haMelech is saying before the Holy One, blessed be He, &#x201C;You have given power to man to make his own choices. And You have made it quite clear which ways are outside the bounds of Your law, and it is within the power of man to guard himself within these boundaries. I have been careful to guard myself concerning all of this, yet my prayer before You is, &#x2018;please support my steps on Your way.&#x2019;&#x201D; The word for &#x201C;Your way&#x201D; is <italic>ma&#x2019;agloteicha</italic>, from the word for circle, <italic>ma&#x2019;agal</italic>. This implies a circuitous way, a path from the side that not everyone knows.<sup><xref rid="fn386">3</xref></sup> Thus he prays that the blessed God illuminate his eyes to travel on the less-known path.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;God, in Your strength the king will rejoice, and he will greatly delight in Your salvation.&#x201D;</italic> (Tehillim, 21:2)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Strength&#x201D; signifies words of Torah. &#x201C;The king will rejoice&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;the king&#x201D; is the Torah scholar, for &#x201C;the rabbis are the vessel of kings.&#x201D; The Torah gives him strength to stand against and conquer the entire world. This is &#x201C;the king will rejoice.&#x201D; &#x201C;He will greatly rejoice in Your salvation,&#x201D; however, represents a place where there is a deficiency from his birth, from his very inception, as it is written (Yeshaya, 48:8), &#x201C;you are called a criminal from the womb.&#x201D; He then needs salvation from the blessed God to renew his life and heal the events of the past.<sup><xref rid="fn387">4</xref></sup> This is called salvation, <italic>yeshua</italic>, in Hebrew, for without it he stands in perplexity. This is &#x201C;in Your salvation,&#x201D; meaning that if he merits salvation then his deficiency will be healed, and then &#x201C;he will greatly delight.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;He lies me down in green pastures.&#x201D;</italic> (Tehillim, 23:2)</p>
<p>When an ox stands in a fertile pasture, then his power of vision is complete and his whole existence and means of sustenance is ready before him. In this way David haMelech asked that the effluence of the blessed God will always be with Israel, and it will even be accessible everywhere their mind&#x2019;s eye takes them. &#x201C;He leads me by waters of rest&#x201D; is to say that there shall be a good connection with a good eye between every member of Israel and his fellow, and this being so, man is at rest.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Save me from all my transgressions, do not place upon me the shame of the boorish.&#x201D;</italic> (Tehillim, 39:9)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Transgression&#x201D; is the deficiency imprinted on man from his mother&#x2019;s womb. This is as it is written (Tehillim, 51:7), &#x201C;and my mother conceived me in sin.&#x201D; This is not, however, an obligation from the side of man, for the blessed God will conduct everything in a way that all will have been for the good of Israel, and even the sinners will have been refined for the good. But still, it is not clear to us now, and at first glance there are great accusations from the nations against Israel. Therefore it says, &#x201C;save me from all transgressions.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn388">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x201C;You have voluntarily scattered a torrent of rain, O God, you have established Your inheritance for Your weary people.&#x201D; (Tehillim, 68:10; see S. R. Hirsh&#x2019;s translation, &#x201C;Thou didst lavish a torrent of bounty, O God; Thou didst first prepare Thy inheritance, a [people] weary of their fate.&#x201D;)</p>
<p>&#x201C;You have voluntarily scattered a torrent of rain, O God&#x201D; is the strength that the blessed God gives Israel to withstand all they must suffer from the nations. This is, &#x201C;Your inheritance for Your weary people,&#x201D; means that Israel&#x2019;s ability to suffer and remain silent comes from the great and brazen strength (<italic>tekifut</italic>), which comes from knowing that surely God will not forsake them, and it is all good for them, yet still they are weary. Thus it says, &#x201C;You have established,&#x201D; for they may take some consolation from the fact that God had established all they are enduring in order that all the good of the nations may then be entered into Israel in a state of <italic>Kedusha</italic> (holiness).</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And as for me, my prayer to you, O God, is to receive a moment of the consciousness of Your will &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Tehillim, 69:14)</p>
<p>At times man feels the great desire and will to ask of God and His power. At this time one must greatly exert himself in prayer and ask God to permanently illuminate this will into him for all time. This is as David haMelech asked of the blessed God the willingness of the heart of Israel to build the <italic>Beit Hamikdash</italic>, the Holy Temple. He then said (Divrei haYamim 1, 29:18), &#x201C;keep this forever in the creations and thoughts of Your people.&#x201D; He asked that this consciousness never be disconnected from them. This is the meaning of the phrase in the Gemara (<italic>Yevamot</italic>, 72a), &#x201C;a time of God&#x2019;s will is essential.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;E-lohim, You have taught me from my youth, and even today I will tell of Your wonders. Even in my old age and gray hair, E-lohim, do not abandon me &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Tehillim, 71:17&#x2013;18)</p>
<p>Man needs to investigate and understand even from the days of his youth what it is that causes his lust to overpower him and distance his heart from God. From this he may infer which matters the blessed God has prepared for him through which to test him and through which he will be refined. Concerning this matter he must strengthen himself and remain vigilant, for the blessed God has allotted to every man something unique through which he will be refined. Thus one has to know clearly the particular way in which he will be refined, and he may begin to contemplate this even in the days of his youth. This is essential, for if he does not know what it is, when he is suddenly overcome by his evil inclination, he will then be jostled to many sides, not knowing which one is particularly relevant to him. This is &#x201C;E-lohim has taught me from my youth,&#x201D; for even in one&#x2019;s youth he can come to a clear understanding of what his particular way of refinement will be, and then &#x201C;even in my old age and gray hair E-lohim has not abandoned me.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;For Shlomo. O God, give your judgments to the king &#x2026; may the righteous flourish in his days, and great peace until the moon withers.&#x201D;</italic> (Tehillim, 72:1,7)</p>
<p>&#x201C;The moon&#x201D; represents the renewal of the light of the <italic>Ein Sof</italic>, the Infinite, may He be blessed, and in the future the blessed God will all original Torah insights and secrets, and there will be no concealment. This is the meaning of the verse (Tehillim, 85:8), &#x201C;O God, show us your mercies,&#x201D; meaning that the blessed God will clearly reveal His mercies and there will no longer be the need for the renewal of salvation. Rather it will be within our power to effect salvation by means of the revealed light of His mercies, and there will be no concealment. This is, &#x201C;until the moon withers away.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn389">6</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Blast the</italic> Shofar <italic>in the month [Elul], in the covering of the day of our festival [Rosh Hashanah, the only festival on a new moon]. For it is a statute for Israel, a judgment from the God of Yaakov.&#x201D;</italic> (Tehillim, 81:4&#x2013;5)</p>
<p>It is written in the Gemara (<italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic>, 25b), &#x201C;At what time is it called a <italic>Choq</italic>, a &#x2018;statute?&#x2019; At the completion of the court case.&#x201D; In the month of Elul there is a depth of the fear of God far greater than may be measured. <italic>Choq</italic>, or &#x201C;statute,&#x201D; mentioned in the verse in connection with Elul, teaches of something that has reached its completion, meaning at its root there is no judgment, for it is a statute, &#x201C;engraved&#x201D; in stone.<sup><xref rid="fn390">7</xref></sup> Yet with something that we see is permanent, with the blessed God it is still in judgment, and so it is with every pending case in the world, &#x201C;who shall live, and who shall die&#x201D; [it is all hanging in judgment]. And so too with all of the desires and wills in the world, where this one chooses something that appears as life, and the other one something that appears as something else, when really at the root and source of life it is all fixed, &#x201C;carved in stone,&#x201D; and there is no one who will not choose it in this way. Even this immutable reality is still in judgment with the blessed God, as it is written (Yirmiya, 33:25), &#x201C;If my covenant did not endure day and night, then I have not enacted the statutes of the heaven and earth.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;I will hear what God will speak, for He will speak of peace for His people and those who love him.&#x201D;</italic> (Tehillim, 85:9)</p>
<p>This means that David haMelech lent his ear to hear what God was saying to Himself, and he heard that God&#x2019;s only desire is the betterment of Israel. For at the time when God spoke to him, He spoke of the welfare of Israel. Yet David haMelech wanted to know what God was occupied with in His own thoughts, and he heard that there too God was speaking of the peace of his people and those who love Him.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;A psalm, a song for the day of Shabbat. It is good to thank God, to sing to His supernal name &#x2026; How great are Your works, O God, how greatly profound Your thoughts&#x0021; &#x2026; a boor does not know, and a fool cannot understand this &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Tehillim, 92)</p>
<p>This psalm explains how it is impossible for any man to have any kind of claim against the blessed God. This is explained by the holy Rambam (Maimonides) in the fifth chapter of the laws of returning to the way of God (<italic>tshuva</italic>). These are his pure words: &#x201C;Perhaps you would say, &#x2018;Does not God know all that will come to be? Before someone comes into being He knows that this one will be either righteous or wicked.&#x2019; If you shall say, &#x2018;If God already knows that he will be righteous, then it is impossible that he will not be righteous.&#x2019; And if you say that He knows that this one will be righteous, and it could be that he turns out to be wicked, then He does not know the matter clearly.&#x201D; According to this, it is within the power of a wicked man to acquit himself from judgment, and also the righteous does not have so much merit, or he would not believe, God forbid, that God knows everything. Therefore David haMelech explained this dilemma in this psalm, saying, &#x201C;how great are Your works, O God, so profound are your thoughts, a boor cannot know.&#x201D; Seen in our human understanding his words are wondrous, describing the blessed God as it were in His greatness and the profundity of His thoughts, which a fool will not apprehend and a boor will not understand. However, it would be proper to say that even the sages and geniuses of the world do not know such matters, because God&#x2019;s intellect is hidden from any human cognizance. This is as it is written (Yeshayahu, 55:8), &#x201C;for My thoughts are not your thoughts.&#x201D; Also it is as Eliyahu the prophet described in his prayer (Tikkunei Zohar 17a, &#x201C;Patach Eliyahu&#x201D;), &#x201C;You are Wise, but not with a known form of wisdom, no thought may apprehend you at all.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Yet this is the intention of David haMelech with these words, where truly, the sages and believers will not in such ways question the intentions of the blessed God, heaven forfend. They know that they cannot reach an understanding of the preciousness of His profundity. They know the greatness of His thoughts, and the vastness of His actions. It says, &#x201C;a boor cannot know,&#x201D; to show how a boor cannot know the profundity of His thoughts, and therefore will raise objections and claims against the ways of the blessed God, as we have explained. This is the explanation of the verse that follows in this psalm, &#x201C;when the wicked flourish like the grass, and doers of iniquity spring up, it is so they may be destroyed for ever, but You are exulted forever.&#x201D;</p>
<p>That is, that with all the flourishing of the wicked like the grass and the emergence of the iniquitous, the appearance in creation was only to be destroyed forever, and they were only created in order to benefit the righteous. If so, then they have no claim whatsoever, since the whole point of their being alive was only for this, and at their root they have no more life. This is just as the claim that the nations will bring against the blessed God in the future. &#x201C;All hidden things are revealed before You. You effused into us an effluence a good spirit and lowered Your people Israel into exile under our hands. These actions of Yours caused an arousal in our hearts to destroy Your people. Then from this, when we act with iniquity, the strength of Israel is then raised. But why are we guilty of this? This sin is not ours&#x0021;&#x201D; This is as it is said, &#x201C;when the wicked flourish &#x2026; to destroy them forever.&#x201D; Corresponding to this it says, &#x201C;and You are exulted, O God,&#x201D; for truly You are Supernal, an no element of creation can have any form of claim against You, and all Your judgments against us are just.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;For behold, Your enemies, O God, behold Your enemies are destroyed, all doers of iniquity will be scattered.&#x201D;</italic> (Tehillim, 92)</p>
<p>This is because all the nations of the world are Your enemies, therefore they have no form of life at their root. Truly all that exists is the will of the blessed God, and nothing exists outside of Him. Since they oppose His will, they have no life at their source, yet for the present moment their existence is still the will of the blessed God in order that by means of them Israel will be greatly elevated. However, in their essence, God has no use for them. If so, when they will be destroyed, they will be able to claim injustice in that they shall be lost completely and Israel will inherit all their good. For how has He acted with them until then? He has bestowed goodness unto them all their days and they have received all effluences of good. And in that no remnant will remain from them is because they never possessed within them any eternal life, for they were only created for Israel&#x2019;s benefit. In their time they will be destroyed, for they despise Israel and the blessed God, and Israel will inherit all their good.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Let us go and sing joyously to God, and exult in the Rock of our salvation.&#x201D;</italic> (Tehillim, 95:1)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Let us go and sing joyously to God&#x201D; means together with the nations of the world, for the blessed God anyhow gives them life and existence. For this, they too must sing joyously. But with us, His people Israel &#x201C;exult in the Rock of our salvation&#x201D; with &#x201C;trumpets and the blast of the <italic>Shofar</italic>,&#x201D; with intense joy of heart that flows from the deepest place in the heart. This is likened to a parable about a king who makes a wedding feast for his son. He invites all kinds of guests to the feast and honors them with food and drink. The joy of the guests is because of the feast that he made for them, and with which he honored them. But the joy of his son is joy from the deepest essence.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;When God reigns, the nations will tremble.&#x201D;</italic> (Tehillim, 99:1)</p>
<p>When God&#x2019;s will shall be to reveal the glory of His sovereignty and bring salvation to Israel, since He is their King and they are His people, then the nations will feel this and be filled with trembling and anguish because of Israel. They will then pass decrees over them.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Fortunate is the man who fears God, and greatly desires His commandments.&#x201D;</italic> (Tehillim, 112:1)</p>
<p>This means that the blessed God greatly desires the fulfillment of the commandments and the ethical behavior of those who fear Him.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;I will wake up at midnight to give thanks to You &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Tehillim, 119:62)</p>
<p>It is written in the holy Zohar (<italic>Vayikra</italic>, 23b), &#x201C;whoever studies Torah at midnight, then the Torah makes his sin known to him, but not in the way of <italic>din</italic> [severe judgment. It is rather as a mother who makes it known to her son with soft words, and he does not forget it, and returns in <italic>tshuva</italic> &#x007B;repentance&#x007D;].&#x201D; &#x201C;Midnight&#x201D; means when the evil inclination still has power over man, and he gets up to serve God. Even though his inclination to evil struggles to subdue him, he overcomes it and trusts in God. In this way, &#x201C;the Torah makes his sin known, but not in the way of severe judgment.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Song of Ascents. When God returns the captives of Zion, we will have been as dreamers &#x2026; Then they will say among the nations, God has done greatness with us, we will be filled with joy.&#x201D;</italic> (Tehillim, 126)</p>
<p>In this light it is written in the Midrash (Sochar Tov, 9), &#x201C;every place that mentions &#x2018;poor&#x2019; or &#x2018;downtrodden&#x2019; is speaking only of Israel.&#x201D; Truly, in this world, all the powers of Israel are small, whether in wisdom, or wealth, or might. They have only simple life, and the desire for the increase of simple life from the blessed God free from any outside appearances. To this the nations of the world will say in the future, &#x201C;God has done greatness with these,&#x201D; meaning that the blessed God bestowed all Divine influence to Israel. &#x201C;God has done greatness with us, we will be filled with joy.&#x201D; This is saying that even if we had been filled with all manner of goodness from our youth, with power that is great in everything, yet still, if the Holy One, blessed be He, had done this with us, we would also be filled with joy in the future. There is no comparison whatsoever between the good that Israel has now, and that which the Holy One, blessed be He, will do for Israel in the future. Nonetheless, the children of Israel must rejoice&#x0021;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;A song of Ascents. God has not made my heart haughty &#x2026; like a child weaned from its mother&#x2019;s breast, so with me is my soul weaned.&#x201D;</italic> (Tehillim, 131)</p>
<p>David haMelech said before the blessed God that regardless of all the sins of Israel they were not once separated from the blessed God. They were rather like a baby separated from his mother&#x2019;s breast, where even when he turns his face from his mother to take something, he then returns his face to his mother so she should not go away from him. So it is with Israel, in every place where they seek good, their eyes are on the blessed God so He should not turn away from them. This is as it is written in the Gemara (Beitsa, 11a), &#x201C;when a young bird falls, it never falls far from the nest.&#x201D; <italic>Kenneset Yisrael</italic>, the entire community of Israel, is compared to a young bird, as is known (<italic>Shabbat</italic>, 49a).</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;If I go up to heaven, there You are. And if I descend into hell, Behold, You are there.&#x201D;</italic> (Tehillim, 139:8)</p>
<p>&#x201C;If I go up to heaven&#x201D; teaches of a time when You raise me up in a state of spiritual elevation with good effluence and the intellect rules over me. &#x201C;There you are,&#x201D; this is clear to me. This is as it is written (Divrei haYamim 1, 29:14), &#x201C;all things have come from You, from Your own hand have we given to You.&#x201D; &#x201C;If I descend into hell&#x201D; means even at a time when my intellect is constricted, then too, my desire is to know that You are the One, and the power is in Your hands. This is, &#x201C;behold, You are there.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; the meek will be adorned in salvation.&#x201D;</italic> (Tehillim, 149:4)</p>
<p>The meek does not boast in himself. His only pride is at the time that the blessed God brings him salvation.</p>

<title>S<small>EFER</small> M<small>ISHLEI</small></title>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;How long will you fools love your folly, and the scoffers covet their derision?&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 1:22)</p>
<p>A fool is a man whose mind is easily cluttered with folly. This is said even of words of Torah, where a man fools himself in being satisfied with a simple meaning, and does not enter further into their profundity. On this it is said, &#x201C;and the scoffers covet their derision,&#x201D; where the meaning is the opposite, for when a man does not even consider the simple meaning of the verses in the Torah he is called a &#x201C;scoffer.&#x201D; This is the way of scoffers who covet their derision (of the simple meaning).</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;My son, if you take My word, and My commandments you conceal within you, to lend your ear to wisdom &#x2026; if you seek it like silver and precious things &#x2026; then you will understand &#x2026; and you will find the consciousness of God.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 2:1&#x2013;5)</p>
<p>When it first says &#x201C;to lend your ear to wisdom,&#x201D; it is said as a command. Then after, it says &#x201C;if you seek&#x201D; (as a possibility). It is in the power of man to lend an ear to wisdom and incline the heart to understanding. However, to &#x201C;seek it like silver,&#x201D; meaning that the words of Torah will be so precious in man&#x2019;s mind that he runs after them just as one would run after money and precious things, is not in man&#x2019;s power, but happens only when he is helped by the blessed God. If words of Torah are so important to him, this is a sign for him that his heart is refined and he possesses the fear of God.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Mercy and Truth will not abandon you &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 3:3)</p>
<p>The verse is not formulated &#x201C;do not abandon Mercy and Truth,&#x201D; for truly the effluence of the blessed God descends constantly without interruption. Only man, from his side, needs to refine his heart and stand ready to receive, and not turn his back on this effluence, God forbid. But in His goodness the blessed God constantly effuses His effluence, and the man who longs for His Mercies shall not forsake them.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;And find grace and good understanding in the eyes of God and man. Trust in God with all your heart and do not rely upon your own understanding. Know Him in all your ways, and He shall lead you on upright paths. Do not be clever in your own estimation, and turn away from evil.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 3:3&#x2013;7)</p>
<p>There is great significance in the juxtaposition of these two verses. &#x201C;Find grace and good understanding&#x201D; tells man to see to it that his actions should gain him grace and honor in the eyes of his fellow man. But if he wants to strive with all of his power to be adorned in the eyes of his fellow man, then &#x201C;trust in God with all your heart and do not rely upon your own understanding.&#x201D; This means not to trust the understanding of your own heart as if you know what will gain grace in their eyes and what will not. Rather, &#x201C;know Him in all your ways,&#x201D; and incline all of your intentions for the sake of Heaven, that all of your ways shall be in the will of the blessed God. &#x201C;He shall lead you on upright paths,&#x201D; meaning, if you go in the way of goodness, then you need not concern yourself that it gains grace in the eyes of your fellow, for the blessed God will anyway lead you on the upright path that will find grace in their eyes. But still, do not rely on this alone by going ahead and doing actions that are contrary to the sensibility of men, trusting in the knowledge that it is correct because he is righteous at his depths. On this it is said, &#x201C;do not be clever in your own estimation, and turn away from evil.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;It shall be healing to your navel &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 3:8)</p>
<p>It shall be healing to the root of the deficiency within the heart of man, from which expansions emerge to all sides. The source will be healed through words of Torah. Then of itself no residue of this deficiency will remain in the places to which it has branched out. This is because the main principle of man&#x2019;s health is from his navel, as we find in the Gemara (<italic>Sotah</italic>, 45b).</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;For the mitzvah is a candle, and the Torah is light &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 6:23)</p>
<p>The Torah is likened to light because its light is very great, and the mitzvah to a candle as its light is small. However, there is an advantage to the candle over the great light, for the candle has the ability to reach into holes and crevices that the great light cannot. The Torah refines the whole man in general, yet in a place where he knows that he is deficient, there he needs the specific mitzvah whereby he can be strengthened in this aspect. This is as we find in the Gemara (<italic>Shabbat</italic>, 118b), &#x201C;Concerning which mitzvah was your father most careful? He told him that it was the mitzvah of <italic>tsitsit</italic>.&#x201D; He needed this particular mitzvah according to the understanding of where he was lacking, and could thereby replenish his lack.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Does not wisdom cry out, and understanding &#x2026; She stands by the way among the high places, by the place of the paths.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 8:1&#x2013;2)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Among the high places&#x201D; means at a time when man is still elevated above all the lusts of the world. Then wisdom arouses him, for &#x201C;at the time of the inclination to evil, no one remembers the inclination to good&#x201D; (<italic>Nedarim</italic>, 32b). Yet before he overpowers (the lusts of the world, the <italic>yetser hara</italic>), then &#x201C;she cries out to it.&#x201D; This is &#x201C;among the high places.&#x201D; &#x201C;By the way&#x201D; is after a man is helped to escape from something evil; &#x201C;she stands in the place of the paths,&#x201D; which is if a man can refine his heart so as not to desire that which is not the will of the blessed God. &#x201C;She cries by the gates,&#x201D; for since the blessed God created man in the world from a sense of honesty and fairness, so just as he gave man the power to desire everything, so too he gave him the power of wisdom to overcome this desire. &#x201C;At the entrance to the city&#x201D; means just as a man intends to do the will of God, &#x201C;at the opening of doorways she cries.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;For whosoever finds Me, finds life, and shall apprehend the will of God.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 8:38)</p>
<p>The second word, &#x201C;finds,&#x201D; is written <italic>motsai</italic>, in the scroll of Mishlei, meaning as the first one, &#x201C;finds Me life.&#x201D; This is to show that he recognizes that life is with the blessed God. (Recognizing the life at the essence of God.) However, we traditionally read it <italic>matsa</italic>, or &#x201C;he finds life,&#x201D; meaning that the man who recognizes this will also find life and meaning in the words of Torah.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;The lips of the</italic> Tsaddik <italic>know Will and the lips of the wicked twist God&#x2019;s words.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 10:32)</p>
<p>This is like the words of our sages (<italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic>, 6a), &#x201C;coerce him until he says, &#x2018;I want to.&#x2019;&#x201D; This means, through his speech, the Will is also entered into his heart. This is &#x201C;the lips of the <italic>Tsaddik</italic>,&#x201D; meaning only what is spoken from the mouth and outward, since his heart is not yet refined. However, this (process of speaking) will help him to refine his heart to be drawn to Will with a complete heart. For example, when anger wells up in his heart against his friend, he knows and accepts that this is a deficiency. In this case he is advised to first speak kindly to his friend, and even though this is not with a willing heart, by means of the act of speaking in this way he will gradually change his very heart by inserting love where there was hate. This is &#x201C;shall know Will,&#x201D; for the term will means order. By means of his speech he will arrange the will until he inserts and installs it there with a complete and willing heart. This is as it is written (Tehillim, 104:18), &#x201C;the sun knows it is going down.&#x201D; This means that there is an order and constancy in the path of the sun that is not so with the moon, which sometimes follows a long path and sometimes a short path, as is written in the Gemara (<italic>Rosh Hashanah</italic>, 25a); see there.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;A man of kindness is good to his soul, but the cruel troubles his own flesh.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 11:17)</p>
<p>This means to do acts of kindness and to do good things to his body. This is like the saying of Hillel (<italic>Vayikra</italic> Rabba, 34:3), &#x201C;After Hillel had concluded his studies, he went walking, accompanied by his students. His students asked him, &#x2018;where are you going?&#x2019; He said, &#x2018;to do a mitzvah.&#x2019; &#x2018;What mitzvah is that?&#x2019; they asked. &#x2018;To go wash myself in the bathhouse,&#x2019; he answered. They asked how this was a mitzvah. He said, &#x2018;look at the one who is appointed to wash and maintain the statues of kings they display in theaters and stadiums. The one who does this is not only paid, but is exulted in the company of the powerful. How much more so with me, who has been created in the image of God. Furthermore, it is written, &#x2018;the man of kindness is good to his soul.&#x2019;&#x201D; All this is after he has refined himself, so as not to taste the bitter as sweet. Then if he finds that it is in his power to be good to his body and he prevents it (see Mishlei, 3:27), on this it is said, &#x201C;the cruel one troubles his own flesh.&#x201D; However, if he is not yet refined and he finds that he desires to cause his body delight, on this it says, &#x201C;evil ones do acts of falsehood&#x201D; (Mishlei, 11:18). In other words, it is not enough that what he is doing is not called bestowing kindness on his body, but the opposite; he turns it around and destroys his body by spoiling it with delights. This is, &#x201C;acts of falsehood.&#x201D; This is hinted at in the holy Zohar, which says (<italic>Shemot</italic>, 200a), &#x201C;there are three points to the Torah.&#x201D; This means that with every action, great or small, one must weight it on a kind of spiritual scale to see that it fits three criteria. First of all, it must be good for his body. This is as our sages said (<italic>Pesachim</italic>, 68b), &#x201C;at the outset, when someone does something, he does it for himself.&#x201D; Furthermore it should be good and honest in the ways of God. Also it must not cause harm to anyone else. After he sees that the action fits these three categories, he can do it, and it is called &#x201C;a man of kindness is good to his soul.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;The deceitful man does not roast that which he has taken from the hunt, but only what has been attained by perseverance is precious to man</italic>.&#x201D; (Mishlei, 12:27)</p>
<p>This means, at the time when the man of deceit is about to cheat his fellow man, he does not burn to do it and prevents himself from cheating him. That is to say, he understands that his fellow man is right, but he has convinced himself that he is right about everything, and does not give any merit to his fellow man. Therefore he does not himself realize that it is his intention to cheat him. &#x201C;Only what has been attained by perseverance is precious to man,&#x201D; this means something valuable to a precious man is deficient in his eyes. This is because the word for perseverance, or diligent work, <italic>charutz</italic> in Hebrew, is related to the word <italic>chareetz</italic> or crack, meaning that the wealth is somehow &#x201C;cracked&#x201D; or deficient, even though it has been achieved in an honest way. Then when he emerges from the trial victorious over his fellow, it still does not sit well with him, and he constantly wonders that he is still somehow incomplete and perhaps harbors deceit within him.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;An unfulfilled promise makes the heart sick, and desire comes from the tree of life.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 13:12)</p>
<p>&#x201C;The tree of life&#x201D; teaches of one who studies the Torah for the sake of Heaven. One who studies Torah for the sake of Heaven will see that none of his longings are deferred, but rather come immediately. &#x201C;Desire comes&#x201D; is expressed in the present tense, because it will always come to him immediately. This is as it is written (<italic>Bereshit</italic>, 29:6), &#x201C;and his daughter Rachel comes.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Good understanding will give grace &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 13:15)</p>
<p>Indeed, &#x201C;understanding&#x201D; or &#x201C;discernment&#x201D; refers to a place where the judgment of one&#x2019;s own understanding necessitates action. If so, what does grace received from his surroundings have to do with this, for such grace is received when one is forgiving? However, &#x201C;good understanding will give grace&#x201D; means that with good understanding and judgment one can actually sway the opinion of his fellow man, even if compared to his own understanding his fellow&#x2019;s understanding seems to him to be the opposite. If one does not possess good judgment, then when he sees that his fellow man objects to his understanding, he will not sway his heart to understand as he does, and so too his fellow man will not find his understanding acceptable.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;&#x2026; and the way of the iniquitous is difficult.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 13:15)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Difficult,&#x201D; <italic>eitan</italic> in Hebrew, denotes brazenness and stubbornness, the opposite of good attributes. This is because his intellect objects to the characteristics of truth. In this way he strengthens himself in his brazenness and stubbornly continues to try to win over his fellow man.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;A righteous one eats to satisfy his soul, but the belly of the evil ones will be lacking.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 13:25)</p>
<p>&#x201C;A righteous one&#x201D; is expressed in the singular, and &#x201C;the evil ones&#x201D; is expressed in the plural. This means that the <italic>tsaddik</italic> (righteous one) is very careful in how he eats, and finds it difficult to eat in a gathering that is not for the purpose of a mitzvah (i.e., Shabbat, a wedding, etc.). This is as it is said in the Gemara (<italic>Sanhedrin</italic>, 23a), &#x201C;the pure-minded of Jerusalem would not sit down to a meal unless they knew with whom they were dining.&#x201D; &#x201C;The belly of the evil ones is lacking&#x201D; means that the desire of the evil ones is to eat together in the company of the other such miscreants, but not at a gathering for a mitzvah. Therefore it reads (Mishlei, 12:26), &#x201C;the righteous seek to cultivate others,&#x201D; meaning if the gathering is for the purpose of a mitzvah then the <italic>tsaddik</italic> is increased in his goodness from the company of his friends. This is as our sages have said (<italic>Berachot</italic>, 63b), &#x201C;a sword is on the enemies of the sages who sit alone and study separately and study Torah.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn391">8</xref></sup></p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;A tongue which speaks softly is the tree of life, but one who perverts his speech is like a destructive wind.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 15:4)</p>
<p>This can be understood by means of a parable. Two salesmen went to the market and sold their merchandise for a certain price. They met each other and asked, &#x201C;how much did you profit from your sales?&#x201D; One said a certain amount, and added, &#x201C;I made a great profit.&#x201D; The other said, &#x201C;I charged even more than you, but I lost money&#x0021;&#x201D; The other answered him, &#x201C;you fool&#x0021; Your mistake was not in your sale here. Your mistake was only in your home. At home you invested much more in your merchandise than I did, and you cheated yourself at your home&#x0021;&#x201D; So it is also true with words of Torah. For truly, with words of Torah, &#x201C;a soft tongue is the tree of life,&#x201D; for it heals (&#x201C;soft&#x201D;&#x2014;<italic>marpe</italic>, is similar to &#x201C;healing&#x201D;&#x2014;<italic>merape</italic>) all of man&#x2019;s deficiencies. However, &#x201C;one who perverts his speech is like a destructive wind.&#x201D; At times a man studies a great amount, but takes not profit from it, remaining as defunct as before. This is because of the &#x201C;destructive wind,&#x201D; which means literally &#x201C;a break in the spirit.&#x201D; That is to say, there are unrepaired deficiencies in the spirit of his life, in his brain, and in his heart. Therefore his words of Torah are of no use to him. He must go back to correct this deficiency of his that he has carried from his birth, and only then can bring words of Torah close to his heart.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;The world of loss and destruction are before God, and all the more the hearts of humankind.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 15:11)</p>
<p>&#x201C;The world of loss [<italic>sheol</italic>],&#x201D; teaches of something that one has no cognizance of at first, but he has knowledge of it at the end. With &#x201C;destruction,&#x201D; he has no cognizance of it at the beginning or at the end. So if these two things are hidden from the hearts of humankind but revealed before the Holy One, blessed be He, then &#x201C;all the more so the hearts of humankind.&#x201D; That is, how much more so these things that are known to the hearts of mankind are revealed and known to the Holy One, blessed be He.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Plans made without counsel are nullified, but when properly advised they will materialize.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 15:22)</p>
<p>Sometimes a man plans to do something good, but when he goes to do it he has forgotten what his thoughts were. This is because they were &#x201C;without counsel,&#x201D; meaning that the matter was also not yet fixed in his heart, but the thought was only external. &#x201C;But when properly advised&#x201D; means after great efforts and counsel for the matter to also be installed in his heart, then &#x201C;they will materialize,&#x201D; meaning also come to fruition in action.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Evil thoughts are an abomination to God, where pure thoughts please Him.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 15:26)</p>
<p>Those thoughts that are evil and an abomination to the blessed God could even come to someone whose heart is clean and pure. Even if he says words that seem to be evil thoughts, still, when he speaks pleasant words his speech can prove that there is no evil in his thoughts. For instance, when Bathsheva presented to David haMelech (Melachim 1, 1) her request for the kingdom to pass to her son Shlomo, even though it was an evil thought to make plans for his successor and plan even when that would be (still in David&#x2019;s lifetime), her words were pure when she said, &#x201C;let the king live forever&#x0021;&#x201D; Then it was known that she was not, God forbid, anticipating when that time would come. Only when she said, &#x201C;I and my son have sinned&#x201D; was it made clear that her thoughts were pure, and through this she said words of pleasantness.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;See to it that all of your actions come about with reference to God, and your thoughts will be established.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 16:3)</p>
<p>A man shall cast all of his actions to God, meaning that all the intentions of his actions are done for the glory of Heaven, and then his thoughts will be established. Then even if he cannot bring his intentions into action, nevertheless he will be strengthened from the blessed God and they will be established forever. We find this with David haMelech, who thought to build the Holy Temple even though he had been told that this endeavor was not in his portion, but rather for his son Shlomo. At first glance it seems that this thought was in vain. Nonetheless, the blessed God illuminated into him that it was well and good that this was in his heart, as it was the will of the blessed God that the first thought of the building of the Holy Temple would come to David haMelech, and the completion of the action be done by Shlomo.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;It is up to God to measure man&#x2019;s actions on the scales of justice, all weights in the pocket for the scale are His work.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 16:11)</p>
<p>&#x201C;It is up to God to measure man&#x2019;s actions on the scales of justice&#x201D; means that all <italic>mitzvot</italic> and good actions are very precious in the eyes of the blessed God. However, &#x201C;His work,&#x201D; meaning whom God will choose, all are &#x201C;weights for the scale.&#x201D; This means an action that man made the effort to make happen. These are the &#x201C;weights in the pocket,&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn392">9</xref></sup> or a place where he makes a greater effort. This is similar to Rashi&#x2019;s explanation to the chapter, &#x201C;if it gets dark while one is on the way&#x201D; (<italic>Shabbat</italic>, 153a), on the necessity of entrusting his purse to a Gentile at the onset of Shabbat. The Gemara asks why this is taught concerning his money and not a valuable object he happened to find. Rashi answers that his money is something that he exerted himself to gain, and therefore would be more likely to want to keep it. Even the smallest of the small is willing to do a good action that does not require a monetary sacrifice. But when one is asked to exert himself and spend money, there you see all the difference in levels of people in the world.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;For the one of understanding, wisdom is before him, and the eyes of the fool are at the ends of the earth.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 17:24)</p>
<p>With men of wisdom and understanding, even though they bring forth true wisdom and understanding, they do not boast of this. It seems to him a simple matter (for he knows there is so much more wisdom to attain), since all of his desires are only to receive a constant increase in wisdom. Yet &#x201C;the eyes of the fool are at the ends of the earth,&#x201D; for his folly is wisdom in his eyes, namely that he thinks he has already attained all of the levels of wisdom that are possible, even to &#x201C;the ends of the earth.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;One who is great in anger will take the punishment &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 19:19)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Great&#x201D; <italic>godel</italic> as it is traditionally read, is actually written in the scroll of Mishlei as <italic>goral</italic> &#x201C;fate,&#x201D; by changing the <italic>reish</italic> to a <italic>dalet</italic>. The meaning of the way it is written is &#x201C;it is the fate of one who gets angry to receive punishment.&#x201D; Thus one who spits vitrol from his lips unintentionally will also have to accept his punishment. To this our sages, who desire the betterment of Israel, established the verse to read <italic>Godel Cheima</italic>, &#x201C;one who is great in anger,&#x201D; meaning one who exaggerates the anger in his mind (but does not bring it out). This is a principle in every case in the Torah where a word is traditionally read differently from how it is written; the way that it is read always sweetens the way in which it is written.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;The desire of man is his mercy, and a poor man is better than a liar.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 19:22)</p>
<p>The desire of man is the lust within his heart, and this is also from the kindness of the blessed God, for whoever is greater than his fellow, so too is his inclination to evil greater (<italic>Succa</italic>, 52a). If he enters the power of his lust and desire into <italic>Kedusha</italic> (holiness), then his greatness will increase all the more. So therefore, &#x201C;a poor man is better than a liar,&#x201D; because if he brings out his lusts into action in a strange place, he is then called &#x201C;a liar,&#x201D; for he is lying with his potential. Then the poor man, who was not created with such powerful lusts, is better than him, since he does not materialize it according to his needs.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Advice in the heart of man are deep waters, and a man of understanding will bring it forth.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 20:5)</p>
<p>There is precious value hidden in the heart of every soul of Israel, and within it is advice as to how to stand before his deficiency and overcome his evil inclination. A man of understanding is one who understands that he needs to complete the place that is lacking in his soul, and he will draw forth from the preciousness at his depths until he can stand against his evil inclination. This is as it is written in the Midrash (Shir Hashirim Rabba, 1:8), &#x201C;It was like a deep well of clean, pure water, which no one could reach, until Shlomo haMelech came along, attaching rope to rope and strand to strand until he could draw up the water.&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;There is a fine treasure and oil in the dwelling place of the sage, but a foolish man will swallow it.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 21:20)</p>
<p>&#x201C;A fine treasure and oil in the place of the sage,&#x201D; for all the words of Torah are a fine treasure for he who seeks to lend his ear and become wise from them. Yet &#x201C;a foolish man&#x201D; means one who looks into the words of Torah and sees his own inability to understand them, for in this area he is a fool, and is in great need of salvation from the words of Torah. Therefore when he hears words of Torah that connect with him, he swallows them into the depth of his every fiber of his being. This is as it is written in the Gemara (<italic>Berachot</italic>, 24b), &#x201C;Rav Zeira said: I learned this incidentally in the house of Rav Hamnuna, and it is worth all the rest of my learning. It is a good sign to sneeze during the prayer, for just as one is relieved below, so too is their relief on high.&#x201D; This is because Rav Zeira had sneezed during his prayer, and he feared greatly because he heard that it might be a bad sign. Yet when he learned the difference between a sneeze (above) and a sneeze (on high), his soul was restored in that he could realize his desire (and sneeze). Therefore it says specifically, &#x201C;I learned incidentally,&#x201D; <italic>avla&#x2019;ah</italic> in Aramaic, spelled with the same letters as &#x201C;swallowed,&#x201D; <italic>bala&#x2019;a</italic> for then he knew that he was complete from the outset.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;The heart of the king is like streams of water in the hands of God, wherever He desires he shall direct it.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 21:1)</p>
<p>Sometimes man is in a situation where he does not know how to act or where to turn. On the one hand he should refrain from action, and on the other hand he needs to go ahead and act, as will be explained below. This is called &#x201C;streams of water.&#x201D; The words of Torah turn in two ways like a fork in a stream.<sup><xref rid="fn393">10</xref></sup> In this case one is advised to deliver his being over to the blessed God who will then illuminate into him what to do. This is &#x201C;the heart of the king.&#x201D; Man should then reign over his heart and deliver it over to God. If the blessed God does not illuminate the direction into him, God forbid, then he is advised in the next verse, &#x201C;doing justice and judgment is more acceptable to God than sacrifices.&#x201D; The verse does not say &#x201C;go and do justice,&#x201D; but rather is simply expressed in the present tense, &#x201C;doing justice.&#x201D; This means not to go ahead and perform the action, rather to sit and refrain from action, and this is in itself justice and the proper judgment, since he does not know in which way to act. This is &#x201C;more acceptable to God than sacrifices,&#x201D; which represent going forth and acting. This is as we find with the dispute between Rabbi Eliezar and Rabbi Yehoshua in the tractate Zevachim (80a, discussing what to do if blood of a sacrifice that required four applications (sprinklings) on the altar were mixed with blood that only required one), &#x201C;Rabbi Elazar said, if you added another application you then transgressed the commandment, &#x2018;do not add,&#x2019;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn394">11</xref></sup> and you have performed an action. &#x201C;If you do not add another application you are transgressing, &#x2018;do not diminish,&#x2019;&#x201D; and you have refrained from an action.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Prepare your work at the outset, then plan out your field, and after this, build your house.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 24:27)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Prepare your work at the outset&#x201D; means that at first one must take care to fulfill all of the commandments according to their simple meaning. This refers specifically from guarding all of the prohibitions of the Torah in order to &#x201C;refrain from evil&#x201D; (Tehillim, 34:15). &#x201C;Then plan out your field.&#x201D; &#x201C;Field&#x201D; represents expansion. This means to expand into the fences and borders of the law, all of the strictures of the sages, for it is known how many branches grow from the words of God. Then even the slightest hint of anger would be considered &#x201C;do not kill,&#x201D; and speaking excessively with one&#x2019;s wife becomes &#x201C;do not commit adultery.&#x201D; This is as we find in the Gemara (<italic>Eruvin</italic>, 53b), &#x201C;Rabbi Yossi the Galilean was once walking on the road, when he met Brurria, the famous wife of Rabbi Meir. He asked her, &#x2018;which road goes to Lod?&#x2019; Brurria replied, &#x2018;foolish Galilean&#x0021; Did not the sages say that one should not speak excessively to women? You should have said, &#x2018;which to Lod?&#x2019;&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn395">12</xref></sup> &#x201C;Plan out your field,&#x201D; as in preparing foundations, denotes endurance and strengthening, to make sure that the boundaries and fences act to support the root of the mitzvah. &#x201C;And after, build your house&#x201D; means that once you have grown in strength and vigor in your performance of the law, fenced in from all sides, then it is permitted to expand into all of your desires, and you will not need any boundaries. Therefore, in truth, Rabbi Yossi the Galilean did not transgress the injunction against speaking excessively to women, for he had already attained a state of completeness, and had no need of boundaries.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Know well the face of your sheep &#x2026;.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 27:23)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Sheep&#x201D; teaches of drawing, as in, to draw energy, for it is the nature of sheep to be drawn to one another. Thus, &#x201C;know well the face of your sheep&#x201D; means to recognize the desires of your heart, to where they are inclined and drawn. This done, you will be able exercise due caution in any necessary situation, and know how to act.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;As water reflects the face, so is it with the heart of man.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 27:19)</p>
<p>When a man looks into a still pool of water, the reflection faithfully shows what is there. Whether the reflection is ruddy or green, this is the appearance of the face. So it is with the heart of man within man. Just as a man inclines his heart to certain words of Torah, so will all of his body and limbs be drawn after the heart to act of their own accord, involuntarily, according to what is imprinted in the heart.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Vanity and falsehood, keep them away from me.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 30:8)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Vanity&#x201D; is something useless that has no roots. It is of no use to man at all. &#x201C;Falsehood&#x201D; could be something that man needs, like a livelihood, yet it comes from a place that is not the will of God. This is the meaning of the term used for falsehood, <italic>c&#x2019;zav</italic> in Hebrew, as in the verse (Yeshayahu, 58:11), &#x201C;like a spring of water which does not fail [<italic>lo yic&#x2019;zavu</italic>].&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;Three [matters] were too wondrous for me, and four I did not know. The way of the eagle in the heavens, the way of the snake by the rock, the way of the ship in the heart of the sea, the way of man with a young woman.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 30:18&#x2013;19)</p>
<p>&#x201C;The eagle&#x201D; teaches of impurity, because the eagle does not even have one sign of pure birds (<italic>Chullin</italic>, 61a; see Mei HaShiloach, &#x201C;the outward signs of pure birds&#x201D;) and it has all four signs of impurity. &#x201C;Heavens&#x201D; teaches of purity and clarity. This teaches that in everything that is pure, there is impurity that must be refined. &#x201C;The way of the snake by the rock,&#x201D; &#x201C;rock&#x201D; means brazen strength, in that man&#x2019;s mind is vigorously resolved to go after the good way. &#x201C;Snake&#x201D; represents error, in that he could err. &#x201C;The way of the ship in the heart of the sea&#x201D; means that in proceeding with haste he shall exercise restraint. &#x201C;The sea&#x201D; represents being hasty in one&#x2019;s desires, and thus in every panic he shall find calmness of mind. &#x201C;The way of man with a young woman&#x201D; &#x201C;woman,&#x201D; means concealment.<sup><xref rid="fn396">13</xref></sup> &#x201C;Man&#x201D; means clear, apparent. This is to show how all concealment contains clarity. When Shlomo haMelech said (Kohollet, 1:13), &#x201C;E-lohim gave a bad matter [<italic>inyan</italic>] to man,&#x201D; he was referring to these four matters. Also the word for matter, <italic>Inyan</italic>, is an acronym for the names of these three matters in Hebrew. <italic>Inyan</italic> is spelled <italic>ayin, nun, yud, nun</italic>. <italic>Ayin</italic>&#x2014;Alma [young woman].&#x201D; &#x201C;<italic>Nun&#x2014;Nesher</italic> [eagle].&#x201D; &#x201C;<italic>Yud</italic>&#x2014;Yam [sea].&#x201D; &#x201C;<italic>Nun</italic>&#x2014;Nachash [snake].&#x201D;</p>
<p align="blockquote"><italic>&#x201C;The spider holds on with its hands, and it is in the chambers of the king.&#x201D;</italic> (Mishlei, 30:28)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Spider&#x201D; (<italic>shmamit</italic>) teaches of anger and destruction (<italic>shomema</italic>). &#x201C;Holds on with its hands&#x201D; shows that the emergence of deficiency exists even with great people, for &#x201C;the sages are the vessels of the kings.&#x201D; And the sages, the leaders of thousands of Israel, have emerged from this to complete themselves, so as not to find this rooted in their hearts. So it was with Uziyah (see Divrei haYamim 2, Ch. 26), who went to burn incense in the innermost chamber of the Temple (but was prevented from this), for he wanted to perfect himself in this. All the while he knew that he was not complete in this aspect, he knew that he was not complete his whole being. This incense brings joy to the heart of man, as it is written (Mishlei, 27:9), &#x201C;oil and incense gladden the heart.&#x201D; This is as it is written (Divrei haYamim 2, 26:19), &#x201C;when he became angry with the <italic>Cohanim</italic>, leprosy sprouted on his forehead.&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn397">14</xref></sup> He realized that he was not clean in this aspect (joy), and in order to fix the matter, and judging himself to be in mortal danger, permitted himself to offer the incense in order to complete his soul. This was possible, because nothing should prevent the saving of a life. And truly, it succeeded, because after this he achieved completion, as it said, &#x201C;leprosy sprouted on his forehead,&#x201D; where the word for sprouted, <italic>zarcha</italic>, also means &#x201C;to shine.&#x201D; In this sense, it was only on the surface that his action was improper, but at the depths he achieved completion from this, as it is said (Melachim 2, 15:5), &#x201C;[as a leper] he dwelled in the house of liberation.&#x201D; That is, he was set free because he was then complete. However, since he was among the <italic>Cohanim</italic>, and the profundity of his intention was hidden from them, it seemed as if he was desecrating God. Thus in their eyes he was a leper. This is as it is said of his son Yotam (Divrei haYamim 2, 27:2), &#x201C;and he did that which was proper in the eyes of God, just as his father Uziya had done, yet he did not enter the chamber of God.&#x201D; This is a limitation, just as all the mentions of &#x201C;yet&#x201D; and &#x201C;only&#x201D; are in the Torah, in that he did not arrive at this level. And if Uziya had only offered the incense, he would have immediately entered the world to come.</p>
