Version Notes,
"Tractate Tzitzit, Introduction.1","<small>BASIS OF THE ORDINANCE</small><br/>The commandment of <i>ẓiẓith</i>, ‘fringes’ or ‘tassels’, is derived from the following two verses of Scripture: <i>Speak unto the children of Israel … that they make them … fringes in the corners of their garments</i> (Num. 15, 38), and <i>Thou shalt make thee twisted cords upon the four corners of thy covering</i> (Deut. 22, 12)."
"Tractate Tzitzit, Introduction.2",<small>THE <i>ṬALLITH</i></small>
"Tractate Tzitzit, Introduction.3","<i>Ẓiẓith</i> must be inserted in each of the four corners of the garment. As modern clothes have no four corners, the <i>ẓiẓith</i> are inserted in the <i>ṭallith</i>, a shawl of wool or silk worn during morning and certain other prayers. The <i>ẓiẓith</i> are suspended from the four corners of the <i>ṭallith</i> as described below."
"Tractate Tzitzit, Introduction.4",<small>THE SMALL <i>ṬALLITH</i></small>
"Tractate Tzitzit, Introduction.5","In addition, a small <i>ṭallith</i> called <i>ṭallith ḳaṭan</i> or <i>’arba‘ kanefoth</i> with <i>ẓiẓith</i> in its four corners is worn all day as an undergarment. It is rectangular in shape with an opening in the middle through which the head is passed, and it hangs down from the shoulders covering the chest and back. It is made of wool, but other soft materials are also used, particularly in those worn by children."
"Tractate Tzitzit, Introduction.6",<small>HOW <i>ẒIẒITH</i> ARE MADE</small>
"Tractate Tzitzit, Introduction.7","Four threads, one of them longer than the others, prepared especially for the religious precept, are inserted in each hole which is made near each of the four corners of the big or small <i>ṭallith</i>. The threads are then folded in two equal halves, the long thread projecting from one of these, and a double knot is made. The halves being held together, the long thread is wound round the others seven times. They are then separated and a double knot is made. Eight coils followed by a double knot in a similar manner is the next stage, and this is followed by eleven coils and a double knot, concluding with thirteen coils and a final double knot—a total of thirty-nine coils and five double knots. Originally a thread, or two threads, of blue wool formed part of the four threads, but this practice has been discontinued because the <i>ḥillazon</i> blue prescribed (cf. §10 of the tractate) became unobtainable."
"Tractate Tzitzit, Introduction.8",<small>SYMBOLISM OF THE COMMANDMENT</small>
"Tractate Tzitzit, Introduction.9","Like <i>tefillin</i> and <i>mezuzah</i>, the <i>ẓiẓith</i> are a reminder to the Israelite of his duty to the Creator of the world and a symbol of His love for those who obey His precepts. The Scriptural injunction, <i>And it shall be unto you for a fringe</i> (Num. 15, 39) continues <i>that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the Lord, and do them; and that ye go not about after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go astray . . that ye may remember and do all My commandments, and be holy unto your God</i> (<i>ibid.</i> 39f.)."
"Tractate Tzitzit, Introduction.10",<small>CONTENTS OF THE TRACTATE</small>
"Tractate Tzitzit, Introduction.11","Beginning with the rules on which persons and garments are subject to the obligation of <i>ẓiẓith</i>, the tractate proceeds to describe how the threads for them are to be made and what their minimum length must be."
"Tractate Tzitzit, Introduction.12","Two opinions are recorded on the question whether the absence of the blue or the white wool from the <i>ẓiẓith</i>, or one or more of the four <i>ẓiẓith</i> from the <i>ṭallith</i>, causes disqualification; and the distance of the hole for the <i>ẓiẓith</i> from the corner of the <i>ṭallith</i> is indicated."
"Tractate Tzitzit, Introduction.13","Rules are defined on the type of person from whom <i>ẓiẓith</i> may be bought, and on the procedure to be adopted when one of the <i>ẓiẓith</i> is missing."
"Tractate Tzitzit, Introduction.14",Various views are expressed on the degree of sanctity to be accorded to <i>ẓiẓith</i> and on the question of their removal from a shroud.
"Tractate Tzitzit, Introduction.15",<i>Ḥillazon</i> is declared to be the only blue eligible in the dyeing of the blue threads; a description is given of the fish that produces it; and the tractate concludes with the ruling that the blue dye may be bought only from a reliable person.
"Tractate Tzitzit, Introduction.16",[In the Talmud edition the text is continuous. The translation is here divided into paragraphs and numbered as in Higger’s edition.]
"Tractate Tzitzit, Introduction.17",I. W. SLOTKI.
Tractate Tzitzit.1,"If one finds blue [threads], even though they are twined,<sup>30</sup><i class=""footnote"">(30) As <i>ẓiẓith</i> are.</i> they are invalid, since the blue [for <i>ẓiẓith</i>] may be bought only from a reliable person.<sup>31</sup><i class=""footnote"">(31) Or, ‘expert’, who knows that only <i>ḥillazon</i> blue may be used.</i>"
"Tractate Tzitzit, Ẓiẓith.1","All<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) Even women.</i> are subject to the obligation of <i>ẓiẓith</i>. R. Simeon exempts women since [the commandment of <i>ẓiẓith</i>] is a positive commandment which is dependent on a fixed time.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) From which women are exempt. The duty of wearing <i>ẓiẓith</i> is restricted to day-time.</i> Any minor who knows how to wrap himself with a <i>ṭallith</i><sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) lit. <i>ẓiẓith</i>, but applied to the shawl to which it is attached. [Cf. the wording of the benediction connected with the performance of the commandment in P.B., p. 14, where ‘fringed garment’ is simply <i>ẓiẓith</i> in the Heb.]</i> should be provided with it by his father.
A <i>ṭallith</i> which is [long enough to] cover one’s head and the greater part of the body is subject to <i>ẓiẓith</i>."
"Tractate Tzitzit, Ẓiẓith.2","As regards a [linen] sheer, Beth Shammai exempt it [from <i>ẓiẓith</i>],<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) Because woollen <i>ẓiẓith</i> in a linen garment are forbidden as <i>mingled stuff, wool and linen together</i> (Deut. 22, 11).</i> but Beth Hillel declare it liable.<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) In their view the prohibition of wearing <i>mingled stuff</i> is superseded by the commandment of <i>ẓiẓith</i>, since the prohibition in Deut. is immediately followed (in verse 12) by the commandment of <i>twisted cords</i> or <i>ẓiẓith</i>. The juxtaposition of the two commandments indicates that the latter supersedes the former.</i> An undergarment is exempt, but R. ‘Aḳiba holds that it is liable. A [double-sized] <i>ṭallith</i> that is folded over is subject to <i>ẓiẓith</i>, but R. Simeon exempts it.<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) Since if it should happen to be unfolded, the <i>ẓiẓith</i> would not be in their proper place, in the four corners, but in the middle of the sheet.</i>
A <i>ṭallith</i> consisting entirely of blue wool is subject to <i>ẓiẓith</i>.<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) The blue texture of the <i>ṭallith</i> does not exempt it from <i>ẓiẓith</i> although one <i>thread of blue</i> (Num. 15, 39) in each of the four <i>ẓiẓith</i> is sufficient.</i> A bolster converted into a sheet or a sheet converted into a <i>ṭallith</i> is subject to <i>ẓiẓith</i>. A night garment and bed-curtains<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) Or, ‘covers’.</i> are exempt from <i>ẓiẓith</i>.<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) In the commandment it is stated, <i>That ye may look upon it</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), which rules out garments worn during the night.</i> A toga,<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) Reading <i>ṭoga’</i> with Jastrow. V has <i>ṭrigon</i> which means ‘a triangular [cloak]’. [It was oval in shape and therefore did not require <i>ẓiẓith;</i> cf. Krauss, <i>Talmudische Archäologie</i>, I, p. 611, n. 589.]</i> a travelling cloak,<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) In V <i>pilgas</i> which Jastrow emends to <i>pinolës</i> (the Greek <i>phainoles</i>). [It is the <i>paenula</i> worn by Roman slaves; Krauss, <i>op. cit.</i> I, p. 170.]</i> shawls fastened at the shoulder,<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) In V <i>pokaltorin</i>, which Jastrow reads as <i>pibolaṭorin</i>, the Latin <i>fibulatorium</i>.</i> a cloak worn on the head,<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">(13) In V <i>’arbiḳwah</i>. [Krauss <i>loc. cit.</i> identifies it with <i>saga Nervica</i>, a garment of various materials and in different colours.)</i> and an <i>’anṭenah</i><sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">(14) According to Jastrow possibly a corruption of the Greek <i>tebenna</i>, a kind of Roman toga.</i> are exempt. This is the general rule: Any [garment] that is without four corners is exempt from <i>ẓiẓith</i>."
"Tractate Tzitzit, Ẓiẓith.3","As for the commandment of <i>ẓiẓith</i>, Beth Shammai say: [It requires that there shall be] four threads, [each] of four finger-[breadths in length]; but Beth Hillel say: Three threads [each] of three finger-[breadths in length]. R. Jose b. Judah remarked: Although Beth Hillel said, ‘Three [threads, each] of three [finger-breadths in length]’, their ruling is practically identical with that of the other.<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">(15) lit. ‘the words of these are near to be like the words of those’; i.e. of Beth Hillel, who refer to the fingers of a larger hand, and Beth Shammai to those of a smaller hand.</i>"
"Tractate Tzitzit, Ẓiẓith.4","Leaving out [from the <i>ẓiẓith</i>] the blue threads though not the white ones, or the white threads though not the blue ones, invalidates them because [the absence of] either the blue or the white invalidates the other. R. [Ishmael]<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">(16) The name is added in H.</i> maintains: The absence of one does not invalidate the other."
"Tractate Tzitzit, Ẓiẓith.5","[The absence of one] of the four <i>ẓiẓith</i> invalidates the others, because all of them [constitute] a single religious observance. R. Ishmael says: They are four independent observances."
"Tractate Tzitzit, Ẓiẓith.6","[Each] <i>ẓiẓith</i> is inserted [in a hole] within three finger-[breadths] of [each] corner; farther away than this is invalid If it was inserted in the border, it is invalid; if between a handbreadth [from the edge] and the border, it is valid. R. Eliezer b. Jacob declares it to be invalid.
[If a strip less than three finger-breadths in length]<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">(17) So according to Men. 41a (Sonc. ed., pp. 247f.).</i> was cut off [from a <i>ṭallith</i>]<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">(18) That had no <i>ẓiẓith</i> (Rashi <i>ad loc.</i>).</i> and then rejoined to it, [the <i>ṭallith</i>] is valid. R. Meir declares it to be invalid.<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">(19) His reason being that, as it is proper to insert <i>ẓiẓith</i> within three finger-breadths from the corner, one might use a hanging thread left from the sewing as one of the four threads required for the <i>ẓiẓith</i>. But that would render the entire fringe invalid, since all the threads have to be made specifically for the purpose of the commandment, whereas the hanging thread was one ready made (cf. Men. Sonc. ed., p. 248, nn. 1f.).</i> [If the detached part] was made into [a smaller <i>ṭallith</i>] on its own, it is valid."
"Tractate Tzitzit, Ẓiẓith.7","If one buys a <i>ṭallith</i> from an idolater or a Samaritan and found blue threads in it, it is invalid;<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">(20) The colour might not be that of the <i>ḥillazon</i> blue, which is the only colour that is recognized.</i> but [if a <i>ṭallith</i> is bought] from an Israelite, it is presumed to be valid."
"Tractate Tzitzit, Ẓiẓith.8","A <i>ṭallith</i>, one of whose <i>ẓiẓith</i> is missing,<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">(21) lit. ‘taken’.</i> may be worn in public.<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">(22) lit. ‘one takes hold of it and goes out’.</i> If two <i>ẓiẓith</i> are missing it may be folded into triangular shape.<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">(23) So covering the missing <i>ẓiẓith</i>.</i> If three <i>ẓiẓith</i> are missing, it may not be worn in public.<sup>24</sup><i class=""footnote"">(24) lit. ‘to go out with it’.</i>"
"Tractate Tzitzit, Ẓiẓith.9","<i>Ẓiẓith</i> [of a <i>ṭallith</i> used as a shroud] upon a corpse should not be undone.<sup>25</sup><i class=""footnote"">(25) The removal of the <i>ẓiẓith</i> would be an insult to the dead, which is condemned in Prov. 17, 5, <i>Whoso mocketh the poor blasphemeth his Maker</i>, and a dead man is the poorest of all.</i> Abba Saul b. Boṭhnith said, ‘My father told me, “When I die, undo the <i>ẓiẓith</i> [in my <i>ṭallith</i>] because they come within the category of holiness” ’.<sup>26</sup><i class=""footnote"">(26) And should be undone before the <i>ṭallith</i> is used as a shroud.</i> The Sages said: It does not come within the category of holiness, so one may use it as a shroud for the dead or as a pack-saddle for an ass."
"Tractate Tzitzit, Ẓiẓith.10","Should a man dye [the <i>ẓiẓith</i> of] a <i>ṭallith</i> for himself, they are invalid for religious use if he intended to test [the dye].<sup>27</sup><i class=""footnote"">(27) The dyeing of <i>ẓiẓith</i> must be for the specified purpose of the commandment. The reading ‘to test’ [<i>lenassoth</i>] is preferable to the variant ‘to cover himself’ [<i>lekassoth</i>].</i> If he dyed them [with an ordinary dye], even four or five times, they are invalid, since the blue [of the <i>ẓiẓith</i>] must be dyed only with that of <i>ḥillazon</i>.<sup>28</sup><i class=""footnote"">(28) A species of mollusc.</i>
What does the <i>ḥillazon</i> resemble? In its formation it resembles a fish and [the colour of] its body resembles [the blueness of] the sky. Its appearance is a very rare occurrence<sup>29</sup><i class=""footnote"">(29) lit. ‘it only rises [from the sea] in seventy years’.</i> and consequently it is very costly."
