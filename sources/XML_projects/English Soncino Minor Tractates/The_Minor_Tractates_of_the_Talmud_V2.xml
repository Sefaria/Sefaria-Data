<title>Tractate Kallah</title>
<chapter>
<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>T<small>HIS</small> tractate derives its name from the opening word <italic>Kallah</italic> (&#x2018;Bride&#x2019;) and consists of a single chapter. It deals with the subject of betrothal, marriage, chastity and moral purity both in thought and action. It also touches on the theme of charity (as in the story of R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba and R. &#x1E6C;arfon) and moralizes on the merit of not making use of the crown of the Torah (as in the story of R. &#x1E6C;arfon and his land-tenant).</p>
<p>The subject-matter of the tractate is cast in the form of a series of <italic>Baraithoth</italic> which are culled from the Babylonian Talmud. In three passages the Talmud mentions a <italic>Masseketh Kallah</italic> (Shab. 114a, Sonc. ed., p. 558; Ta&#x2018;an. 10b, Sonc. ed., p. 45; &#x1E32;id. 49b, Sonc. ed., p. 247), but scholars are divided in their opinion as to whether the allusion is to this tractate. Some hold that the reference is to the assemblies of the Babylonian scholars held twice a year (in the months of <italic>Elul</italic> and <italic>Adar</italic>) in the Amoraic period which were termed <italic>kallah</italic> and at which a set tractate was studied. Others take the view that the allusion is to this tractate.</p>
<p>Its authorship is attributed to Jehudai Gaon, who lived in Babylonia in the eighth century, but Higger (Introduction to his edition of <italic>Kallah</italic>, p. 13) concludes that the original <italic>Kallah</italic> was compiled by a disciple of R. Eliezer b. Hyr&#x1E33;anos (first and second centuries) and that a later compiler added to it passages from the Talmud and other sources.</p>
<p>I have to express my indebtedness to M. Higger&#x2019;s invaluable edition of the tractate, from which I derived much help in the preparation of this work. The division of the translation into paragraphs follows his text, which, in the Wilna edition, is a continuous whole.</p>

<title>KALLAH</title>
<p label="1.">A bride<sup><xref rid="fn1">1</xref></sup> is forbidden to her husband without the [marriage] benediction<sup><xref rid="fn2">2</xref></sup> in the same manner as a <italic>niddah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3">3</xref></sup> Just as a <italic>niddah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn4">4</xref></sup> who has not immersed [in the ritual bath] is forbidden to her husband, so likewise is a bride forbidden to her husband without the [marriage] benediction. Whence is the benediction of bridegrooms derived from the Torah? As it is stated, <italic>And they blessed Rebekah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn5">5</xref></sup> And whence do we derive that even a widow is so forbidden?<sup><xref rid="fn6">6</xref></sup> As it is stated, <italic>And he took ten men of the elders of the city &#x2026; And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders said, We are witnesses. The Lord make the woman &#x2026; and let thy house be like the house of Perez</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn7">7</xref></sup></p>
<p label="2.">After the consummation of her marriage on the first day, a bride is forbidden<sup><xref rid="fn8">8</xref></sup> for the whole of the succeeding seven days, and it is not permitted to take any object<sup><xref rid="fn9">9</xref></sup> from her hand all the seven days. This is the view of R. Eliezer, but R. Joshua said: Not until the matter is examined&#x2014;if she was <italic>niddah</italic> while still in her father&#x2019;s house, she is forbidden [to her husband], but if not she is allowed to him.</p>
<p label="3.">R. Eliezer was asked, &#x2018;Is it permissible to drink from the hand of the bride so long as her husband is sitting with her at the festive table?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;Whoever drinks from the hand of a bride is as though he drinks from the hand of a harlot&#x2019;. [His colleagues] said to him, &#x2018;Are not all the daughters of Israel possessed of good manners?&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn10">10</xref></sup> He answered, &#x2018;God forbid&#x0021; Anyone who is not familiar with the Torah<sup><xref rid="fn11">11</xref></sup> cannot be possessed of good manners&#x2019;. R. Eleazar b. Azariah made a public declaration accompanied by the sounding of three hundred <italic>shofars</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn12">12</xref></sup> &#x2018;Whether a bride be of the daughters of a scholar or of an <italic>&#x2018;am ha-&#x2019;are&#x1E93;</italic>, he who drinks from her hand is as though he drinks from the hand of a harlot&#x2019;. He further said, &#x2018;Whoever takes a cup from the hand of a bride and drinks from it has no share in the World to Come&#x2019;.</p>
<p label="4.">He who recites a verse from the Song of Songs<sup><xref rid="fn13">13</xref></sup> rendering it as a [secular] song, and similarly whoever recites a verse from the Torah unseasonably at banqueting tables, causes the Flood to come upon the world; because the Torah clothes itself in sackcloth, stands before the Holy One, blessed be He, and complains, &#x2018;Sovereign of the universe&#x0021; Thy children have made me as a harp upon which scorners play&#x2019;. To this He replies, &#x2018;My daughter, when they rejoice what should they do?&#x2019; She makes the rejoinder, &#x2018;Sovereign of the universe&#x0021; If he is a scholar let him occupy himself with the Torah, with study and good deeds and <italic>&#x2019;aggadoth;</italic> let students of Scripture occupy themselves with Scripture, students of Midrash and Mishnah with the laws of Passover on Passover, the laws of Pentecost on Pentecost and the laws of Tabernacles on Tabernacles&#x2019;. R. Simeon<sup><xref rid="fn14">14</xref></sup> testified and said: Whoever reads a verse in season brings good to the world, as it is stated, <italic>And a word in due season, how good is it&#x0021;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn15">15</xref></sup></p>
<p label="5.">One who sends the cup of benediction<sup><xref rid="fn16">16</xref></sup> to a woman without the knowledge of her husband forfeits his life because his mind prevailed over him.<sup><xref rid="fn17">17</xref></sup> Rabbi [Judah the Prince] said: Because the evil inclination has prevailed over him. Similarly the members of a company who send the cup of benediction to a woman without the knowledge of her husband forfeit their lives because their minds prevailed over them. Rabbi [Judah the Prince] said: Because the evil inclination has prevailed over them.</p>
<p label="6.">He who pays money to a woman,<sup><xref rid="fn18">18</xref></sup> counting from his hand into her hand in order to gaze at her, even if he be like Moses our teacher who received the Torah from Mount Sinai, will not be exempt from the penalty of Gehinnom; as it is stated, <italic>Hand to hand, the evil man shall not be unpunished</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn19">19</xref></sup></p>
<p label="7.">Behold Scripture declares, <italic>And we have brought the Lord&#x2019;s offering, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, armlets, and bracelets, signet-rings, ear-rings, and girdles, to make atonement for our souls before the Lord</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn20">20</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;E&#x1E93;adah</italic> (<italic>armlets</italic>) means a garter; <italic>&#x1E93;amid</italic> (<italic>bracelets</italic>) silk cloaks; <italic>&#x2018;agil</italic> (<italic>ear-rings</italic>) a cast of the female breasts; <italic>kumaz</italic> (<italic>girdles</italic>) a cast of the womb. <italic>To make atonement for our souls:</italic> Moses said to Israel, &#x2018;Perhaps you have returned to your former sinful lapse&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn21">21</xref></sup> They replied to him, &#x2018;<italic>There lacketh not one man of us</italic>&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn22">22</xref></sup> &#x2018;If so,&#x2019; he retorted, &#x2018;why this atonement?&#x2019; They replied, &#x2018;We may have escaped sin, but we have not escaped sinful thoughts&#x2019;. Why [did they offer] signet-rings? Because whoever gazes intentionally at a woman is as though he had intercourse with her. Hence the Rabbis declared: Whoever touches a woman&#x2019;s little finger is as though he touched &#x2018;that place&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn23">23</xref></sup></p>
<p label="8.">He who gazes at a woman&#x2019;s heel will have deformed children. [Why are children born] lame, blind, dumb or deaf? R. Eliezer said: Because [the husband] claimed marital rights but she refused. R. Joshua said: Because she declared at the time of cohabitation, &#x2018;I have been forced&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn24">24</xref></sup> R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: Because she says, &#x2018;I am unclean&#x2019; when she is clean.<sup><xref rid="fn25">25</xref></sup> R. Nehemiah said: Because of the sin of causeless hatred a man&#x2019;s wife suffers miscarriage, contention is rife in his house, and his sons and daughters die young.<sup><xref rid="fn26">26</xref></sup> R. Nehorai said: Whoever puts his neighbour to shame will in the end himself be put to shame; furthermore, the Angels of Destruction thrust and drive him out of the world and expose his shame before all mankind. But whoever is shamefaced will not speedily yield to sin; as it is stated, <italic>And that His fear may be before you, that ye sin not</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn27">27</xref></sup> As regards anyone who is not shamefaced, it is certain that his forefathers did not stand at the foot of Mount Sinai.</p>
<p label="9.">R. Jo&#x1E25;anan said:<sup><xref rid="fn28">28</xref></sup> The Ministering Angels told me four things and they are related to the lame, the blind, the dumb and the deaf. Why [are children born] lame? Because [their parents] overturned their table<sup><xref rid="fn29">29</xref></sup> and behaved like animals. Why [are children born] blind? Because [their parents] gaze at &#x2018;that place&#x2019;. Why [are children born] deaf? Because [their parents] converse<sup><xref rid="fn30">30</xref></sup> during cohabitation. Why [are children born] dumb? Because [their parents] kiss &#x2018;that place&#x2019;. The Sages say that the <italic>halakah</italic> is not in agreement with R. Jo&#x1E25;anan, but a man may do with his wife as he desires;<sup><xref rid="fn31">31</xref></sup> because the matter can be best compared to a man who purchased meat from the butcher: if he wishes he eats it raw, if he wishes he eats it boiled, if he wishes he eats it roasted over coals.</p>
<p label="10.">Imma Shalom,<sup><xref rid="fn32">32</xref></sup> the wife of R. Eliezer and sister of Rabban Gamaliel was asked, &#x2018;Why are your children beautiful? And during intercourse how does [your husband] conduct himself towards you?&#x2019; She replied, &#x2018;He does not converse<sup><xref rid="fn33">33</xref></sup> with me during the first or last watch, but only during the middle watch;<sup><xref rid="fn34">34</xref></sup> [and when he cohabits] he uncovers a handbreadth and covers a handbreadth, and it is as though he was urged on by a demon. And when I questioned him, &#x201C;What is the reason for all this?&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn35">35</xref></sup> he replied, &#x201C;So that another woman should not come to my mind<sup><xref rid="fn36">36</xref></sup> and my children consequently come within the category of bastards&#x201D; &#x2019;. Hence [the Sages] declared: Ten<sup><xref rid="fn37">37</xref></sup> categories of people are like bastards but are not [legally] such, and they are: the children [born] of fear,<sup><xref rid="fn38">38</xref></sup> the children of a maidservant, the children of a hated wife, (the children of a <italic>niddah</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn39">39</xref></sup> the children of one who is under a ban of excommunication, the children of a woman thought to be another,<sup><xref rid="fn40">40</xref></sup> the children of [a marriage characterized by] strife, the children of a drunken woman, the children of a wife divorced in the heart,<sup><xref rid="fn41">41</xref></sup> the children of promiscuity, and some add, the children of a sleeping woman.<sup><xref rid="fn42">42</xref></sup> One who has intercourse with his betrothed in her father-in-law&#x2019;s house without the <italic>kethubah</italic> having been drawn up<sup><xref rid="fn43">43</xref></sup> will have sickly children. Weak children are the issue of those who cohabit with women who are <italic>niddah;</italic> ugly children [are born] of women in a doubtful state of ritual purity.</p>
<p label="11.">If a man, on leaving a privy, [immediately afterwards] has intercourse, he will have epileptic children, because the demon of the privy accompanies him.<sup><xref rid="fn44">44</xref></sup> How long should he wait before having intercourse? Long enough to walk half a <italic>mil</italic>.</p>
<p label="12.">If a man has undergone blood-letting and [immediately afterwards] has intercourse, his children will be weaklings. If both<sup><xref rid="fn45">45</xref></sup> have undergone blood-letting and [immediately afterwards] have intercourse, their children will be liable to have lupus.<sup><xref rid="fn46">46</xref></sup> When does this apply? Only if they had nothing to eat,<sup><xref rid="fn47">47</xref></sup> but if they partook of some food there is no [harm] in it.</p>
<p label="13.">If a man has intercourse while standing he has attacks of trembling,<sup><xref rid="fn48">48</xref></sup> and this is what is termed &#x2018;fire of the bones&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn49">49</xref></sup> What is the remedy for it? Flour of lentils and wine. A person should take all remedies when well-fed, but this remedy when he is hungry. A person should take all remedies when standing, but this remedy with one foot in the bed and the other on the ground [51<italic>a</italic>]. A person should take all remedies three times in three days,<sup><xref rid="fn50">50</xref></sup> but he should continue this remedy until he is cured.</p>
<p>He who is in the habit of taking black cumin will not suffer with pain of the heart. Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel said: Cumin is one of the sixty deadly poisons, and as for him who sleeps to the east of his store [of cumin], his blood is on his head.<sup><xref rid="fn51">51</xref></sup> [There is no contradiction] because the former refers to when it is baked<sup><xref rid="fn52">52</xref></sup> and the latter when it is not baked. If one eats cumin of the weight of a <italic>dinar</italic> his heart will be affected; so too if he eats forty eggs, forty nuts or a quarter of a <italic>log</italic> of honey. Likewise, if one eats fat beef<sup><xref rid="fn53">53</xref></sup> with vegetables on the night of the fourteenth and fifteenth of the month and sleeps in [the light of the full] moon in the summer solstice, his blood is on his head.</p>
<p label="14.">If one has intercourse when drunk,<sup><xref rid="fn54">54</xref></sup> [his heart] will ultimately be affected; if both of them are drunk their hearts will be affected. If one has intercourse by the light of a lamp, he will have epileptic children.</p>
<p label="15.">If one has intercourse sitting, he will be subject to diarrhoea. What is the remedy for it? Crocus of thorns. If he is below and she above he will be seized with convulsions;<sup><xref rid="fn55">55</xref></sup> he above and she below, this is the normal way of human beings; if the two of them lie facing one another, this is a form of perversion.</p>
<p label="16.">R. Judah said: The bold-faced are [destined] to Gehinnom and the shamefaced to the Garden of Eden.<sup><xref rid="fn56">56</xref></sup> The bold-faced, R. Eliezer said, is the bastard; the son of a <italic>niddah</italic>, said R. Joshua; R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: Both a bastard and the son of a <italic>niddah</italic>. The elders were once sitting in the gate when two young lads passed by; one covered his head and the other uncovered his head. Of him who uncovered his head R. Eliezer remarked that he is a bastard; R. Joshua remarked that he is the son of a <italic>niddah;</italic> R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said that he is both a bastard and the son of a <italic>niddah</italic>. They said to R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba, &#x2018;How did your heart induce you to contradict the opinion of your colleagues?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;I will prove it concerning him&#x2019;. He went to the lad&#x2019;s mother and found her sitting in the market selling beans. He said to her, &#x2018;My daughter, if you will answer the question which I will put to you, I will bring you to the World to Come&#x2019;. She said to him, &#x2018;Swear it to me&#x2019;. R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba, taking the oath with his lips but annulling it in his heart, said to her, &#x2018;What is the status of your son?&#x2019; She replied, &#x2018;When I entered the bridal chamber I was <italic>niddah</italic> and my husband kept away from me; but my best man<sup><xref rid="fn57">57</xref></sup> had intercourse with me and this son was born to me&#x2019;. Consequently the child was both a bastard and the son of a <italic>niddah</italic>. It was declared, &#x2018;R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba showed himself a great man when he contradicted his teachers&#x2019;. At the same time they added, &#x2018;Blessed be the God of Israel, Who revealed His secret to R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba b. Joseph&#x2019;.</p>
<p label="17.">R. Jo&#x1E25;ai<sup><xref rid="fn58">58</xref></sup> b. Josiah said: He who diverts his mind<sup><xref rid="fn59">59</xref></sup> with women will eventually come within the power of sin. And he who diverts himself from sin and does not commit it, even though he be an Israelite,<sup><xref rid="fn60">60</xref></sup> he is worthy to offer a burnt-offering on the altar as did the High Priest; as it is stated, <italic>And he sent the young men of the children of Israel who offered burnt-offerings</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn61">61</xref></sup> And whoever makes himself indolent so as not to sin and does not commit it will be sustained by the lustre of the Divine Presence like the Ministering Angels; as it is stated, <italic>And they beheld God, and did eat and drink</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn62">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Eliezer b. Jacob said: Whoever masturbates is as though he committed murder;<sup><xref rid="fn63">63</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>That slay</italic> [<italic>sho&#x1E25;e&#x1E6D;&#x00EB;</italic>] <italic>the children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn64">64</xref></sup> Do not read <italic>sho&#x1E25;e&#x1E6D;&#x00EB;</italic> but <italic>so&#x1E25;e&#x1E6D;&#x00EB;</italic> (&#x2018;that squeeze out&#x2019;). And the Sages said: He is as though he worshipped idols, as it is stated, <italic>Ye that inflame yourselves among the terebinths, under every leafy tree</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn65">65</xref></sup></p>
<p label="18.">Rabbi [Eliezer b. Jacob] said: Whoever changes his word is as if he worshipped idols,<sup><xref rid="fn66">66</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a mocker</italic> (<italic>metha&#x2018;tea&#x2018;</italic>),<sup><xref rid="fn67">67</xref></sup> and <italic>metha&#x2018;tea&#x2018;</italic> means nothing else than idolatry, as it is stated, <italic>They are vanity, a work of delusion</italic> (<italic>ta&#x2018;tu&#x2018;im</italic>).<sup><xref rid="fn68">68</xref></sup></p>
<p label="19.">[<italic>Ye that inflame yourselves among the terebinths</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn69">69</xref></sup>&#x2014;hence the Sages declared: A man may not put his hand to his membrum. There are three [instances of abuse by] the hand and in all three [the hand merits] amputation:<sup><xref rid="fn70">70</xref></sup> The hand that is put to the membrum let it be cut off&#x0021; The hand that is put to the eye let it be cut off&#x0021; The hand that is put to the vein for blood-letting let it be cut off&#x0021; &#x2018;The hand that is put to the membrum let it be cut off&#x0021;&#x2019; Because it causes sexual excitement. &#x2018;The hand that is put to the eye, let it be cut off&#x0021;&#x2019; Because it leads to blindness.<sup><xref rid="fn71">71</xref></sup> &#x2018;The hand that is put to the vein for blood-letting let it be cut off&#x0021;&#x2019; Because it leads to death.</p>
<p>Another interpretation of <italic>Ye that inflame yourselves among the terebinths:</italic> Whoever excites himself in order to masturbate is considered to be like an animal. Just as an animal is not mindful of what it does so is he; just as an animal is ignorant of what leads to death so is he; just as an animal is only destined for slaughter and has no portion in the World to Come, he too has no portion in the World to Come. Of him Solomon in his wisdom declared, <italic>Who knoweth the spirit of man whether it goeth upward</italic><sup><xref rid="fn72">72</xref></sup>&#x2014;this refers to the souls of the righteous who do not arouse themselves and do not masturbate. <italic>And the spirit of the beast whether it goeth downward to the earth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn73">73</xref></sup>&#x2014;this refers to the souls of the wicked who arouse themselves and masturbate.</p>
<p>Another interpretation of <italic>Ye that inflame yourselves among the terebinths:</italic> Whoever arouses himself and masturbates forfeits his life, as it is stated, <italic>And Er, Judah&#x2019;s first-born, was wicked in the sight of the Lord; and the Lord slew him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn74">74</xref></sup> And whoever deliberately causes an erection is a transgressor, as it is stated, <italic>And the thing which he did was evil in the sight of the Lord</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn75">75</xref></sup></p>
<p label="20.">Even children meet the Divine Presence, as it is stated, <italic>A seed shall serve him; it shall be told of the Lord unto the next generation</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn76">76</xref></sup> For what sin do a man&#x2019;s children die [young]?<sup><xref rid="fn77">77</xref></sup> R. Eliezer said: For the sin of [unfulfilled] vows, as it is said, <italic>Suffer not thy mouth to bring thy flesh into guilt &#x2026; and destroy the work of thy hands</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn78">78</xref></sup> R. Nathan said: For the sin of [neglecting] the <italic>mezuzah</italic>, as it is written, <italic>And thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thy house, and upon thy gates</italic> which is followed by <italic>that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn79">79</xref></sup> R. Nehorai said: For the sin of [neglecting] the <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic>, as it is written, <italic>Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn80">80</xref></sup> R. Joshua<sup><xref rid="fn81">81</xref></sup> said: For the sin of [neglecting the study of] the Torah children die young, as it is stated, <italic>Seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn82">82</xref></sup> R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: Whoever does not occupy himself with [the study of] the Torah causes poverty to come upon his children.</p>
<p label="21.">What should a man do so that his children shall grow rich and flourish?<sup><xref rid="fn83">83</xref></sup> Let him fulfil the will of God and the wishes of his wife. This is the will of God: Let him freely distribute his money to the poor, as it is stated, <italic>He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the needy; his righteousness endureth for ever</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn84">84</xref></sup> It is related of R. &#x1E6C;arfon that, although he was very wealthy, he did not give gifts to the poor [in adequate manner]. Once R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba met him and said to him, &#x2018;Master, would you like me to purchase one or two cities for you?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;Yes&#x2019; and forthwith handed R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba four thousand golden <italic>dinars</italic>. R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba took the money and distributed it among the poor. Later R. &#x1E6C;arfon met him and asked, &#x2018;Where are the cities which you purchased for me?&#x2019; [R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba] took him by the hand and led him to the House of Study. He produced a Book of Psalms and placed it in front of them both. They went on reading until they came to the verse, <italic>He hath scattered abroad</italic>, etc., and then he exclaimed, &#x2018;This is the city which I bought for you&#x2019;. Thereupon R. &#x1E6C;arfon stood up, kissed him and said to him, &#x2018;My teacher and friend&#x2014;my teacher in wisdom, my friend in social conduct&#x2019;, and gave him still more money to distribute.</p>
<p>It is further related of R. &#x1E6C;arfon<sup><xref rid="fn85">85</xref></sup> that he was once eating figs from his garden when his tenant came and [not recognizing him] gave him a severe beating. R. &#x1E6C;arfon did not disclose his identity until the tenant recognized him. On recognizing him, he rent his garments, tore his hair, cried bitterly and fell at his feet imploring him, &#x2018;My lord master, forgive me&#x0021;&#x2019; Why [did R. &#x1E6C;arfon not reveal his identity] all that [length of time]? Because he would not make use of the crown of the Torah, since whoever makes use of the crown of the Torah has no share in the World to Come.<sup><xref rid="fn86">86</xref></sup></p>
<p label="22.">These are the wishes of one&#x2019;s wife:<sup><xref rid="fn87">87</xref></sup> R. Eliezer said: He should speak seductively to her at the time of intercourse. R. Judah said: He should [endeavour] to make her happy at the time when he is engaged in fulfilling the commandment towards her, as it is stated, <italic>Whoso eepeth the commandment shall know no evil thing</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn88">88</xref></sup></p>
<p label="23.">If a man desires that his sons should be students of the Torah, let him examine his actions<sup><xref rid="fn89">89</xref></sup> and speak seductively to his wife during intercourse.</p>
<p>R. Eliezer b. Jacob said:<sup><xref rid="fn90">90</xref></sup> One should not put his money [51<italic>b</italic>] into a charity bag unless he is supervised by a man like R. &#x1E24;anina b. Teradion. It is related of R. &#x1E24;anina b. Teradion that once some money [to be distributed among the poor on] <italic>Purim</italic> was mixed up by him with charitable funds [in general]. He sat in confusion and exclaimed, &#x2018;Woe is me&#x0021; Perhaps I have incurred the penalty of death at the hand of Heaven&#x2019;. While he was still sitting in a troubled state of mind, the executioner came and told him, &#x2018;Master, it has been decreed against you that you be wrapped in [a scroll of] your Torah and be burnt with it&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn91">91</xref></sup> He arose and they wrapped him in his [scroll of the] Torah and surrounded him with bundles of twigs. When the fire caught sight of him, it cooled down and removed itself from him. Whereupon the executioner rose up in amazement and asked him, &#x2018;Master, are you the man condemned to be burnt?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;Yes&#x2019;. He then asked him, &#x2018;Why has the fire gone low?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;I adjured it in the name of my Creator that it should not touch me until I know whether it was so decreed against me in Heaven. Wait one hour and I will let you know&#x2019;. The executioner was sitting in wonderment and said [to himself], &#x2018;Why should persons who decree death and life for themselves<sup><xref rid="fn92">92</xref></sup> be subject to the yoke of [the Roman] government?&#x2019; He said [to R. &#x1E24;anina,] &#x2018;Arise and go, and whatever the government desires to do to me let it be done&#x2019;. He replied, &#x2018;You foolish man&#x0021; Heaven has approved the sentence passed on me, and if you do not kill me God has many slayers, [e.g.] many bears, leopards, lions, wolves, many serpents and scorpions to attack me. Ultimately, however, God will exact from you punishment for my blood&#x2019;. Thereupon the executioner understood that such was the [divine] method;<sup><xref rid="fn93">93</xref></sup> so he jumped up and fell into the fire. From the midst of the fire he shouted,<sup><xref rid="fn94">94</xref></sup> &#x2018;<italic>Where thou diest will I die, and there will I be buried</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn95">95</xref></sup> [adding] where you live will I live&#x2019;. Forthwith a voice from heaven<sup><xref rid="fn96">96</xref></sup> declared, &#x2018;R. &#x1E24;anina b. Teradion and his executioner are both destined for the life of the World to Come&#x2019;.</p>
<p label="24.">R. Eliezer said:<sup><xref rid="fn97">97</xref></sup> Whoever greets his teacher [with the ordinary salutation] forfeits his life.

<ftnote id="fn1">(1) Here used in the sense of a betrothed girl. In the Talmudic period betrothal (<italic>&#x2019;erusin</italic>) and marriage (<italic>&#x1E33;iddushin</italic>) denoted two stages different from what they are now. <italic>&#x2019;Erusin</italic> took place in the bride&#x2019;s home and <italic>&#x1E33;iddushin</italic> subsequently in the bridegroom&#x2019;s home. It is important to note that the ceremony of <italic>&#x2019;erusin</italic> was binding upon the bridal couple and could not be dissolved without a bill of divorce. Later the current custom prevailed whereby the two ceremonies were combined and performed at the same time (cf. P.B., pp. 298f., the benediction on the first of the pages being of <italic>&#x2019;erusin</italic>).</ftnote>

<title>Tractate Kallah Rabbati</title>
<chapter>
<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>This tractate has the form of a Talmudic work consisting of <italic>Baraithoth</italic> and <italic>Gemara</italic>. In the view of M. Friedmann (<italic>Seder &#x2019;Eliyahu Zu&#x1E6D;a</italic>, p. 15), it emanated from the School of Raba in Mehuza (Babylonia, third century). A. Aptowitzer, on the other hand, maintained (R.E.J. LVII, 1909, pp. 245-8) that the author was Raba, a disciple of Jehudai Gaon who lived in Babylon in the eighth century.</p>
<p>The tractate comprises ten chapters. The first two form a commentary on <italic>Masseketh Kallah;</italic> chaps. III-V are closely related to <italic>Masseketh Derek &#x2019;Ere&#x1E93;;</italic> chap. VIII deals with &#x2018;The Chapter on the Acquisition of the Torah&#x2019; or &#x2018;The <italic>Baraitha</italic> of R. Meir&#x2019; appended to <italic>Pir&#x1E33;&#x00EB;&#x2019; Aboth;</italic> and chaps. VI, VII, IX and X comment on &#x2018;The Chapters of Ben &#x2018;Azzai&#x2019;.</p>
<p>Much <italic>aggadic</italic> material is incorporated in the tractate as well as a number of interesting stories of which the following may be mentioned: R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba and the ghost (ch. II), the four Sages and the philosopher (ch. VII), Simeon b. An&#x1E6D;ipa&#x1E6D;ros and his guests (ch. IX) and R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba and the Athenian (ch. X). In addition, a series of passages is cited from Ben Sira, or Ecclesiasticus (ch. III), some of which are not to be found in the extant version, and also an enumeration of the seven immortals (ch. III).</p>
<p>It may be assumed with a high degree of probability that this tractate was one of a series of popular works of study and a rich source of religious, ethical and spiritual edification.</p>
<p><italic>Kallah Rabbathi</italic> was apparently neglected by medieval scholars, which fact accounts for the absence of any commentary upon it. The text is often corrupt and in the printed edition lacks the invaluable critical notes of R. Elijah of Wilna as an aid. In consequence the task of translation has been exceptionally difficult, and I have to acknowledge my indebtedness to M. Higger&#x2019;s edition of the text, from which I derived much help in the preparation of my English version.</p>

<chapter>
<title>KALLAH RABBATHI</title>
<title>CHAPTER I</title>
<p label="1."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn103">1</xref></sup> A bride is forbidden to her husband without the [marriage] benediction in the same manner as a <italic>niddah</italic> who has not immersed; just as a <italic>niddah</italic> who has not immersed is forbidden to her husband, so likewise is a bride forbidden to her husband without the [marriage] benediction.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. Raba said: Of which benediction do [the Sages] speak? The benediction [consisting of] seven [blessings] and not the benediction of betrothal. Which is the benediction of betrothal? R. Judah said in the name of Rab:<sup><xref rid="fn104">2</xref></sup> &#x2018;[Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe,] Who hast sanctified us by Thy commandments, and hast commanded us concerning forbidden relations and hast forbidden us unto the betrothed and hast allowed us unto the wedded by the rite of the [marriage] canopy and sanctification. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who sanctified Israel by the rite of the canopy and sanctification&#x2019;.</p>
<p>In what order are the [seven] blessings recited? R. Levi said: &#x2018;Who created the fruit of the vine&#x2019;, and &#x2018;Who hast created all things to Thy glory&#x2019;. &#x2018;Blessed art Thou the Creator of man.&#x2019; &#x2018;Blessed art Thou Who hast made man in Thine image, after Thy likeness, and hast prepared unto him, out of his very self, a fabric for ever. Blessed art Thou, Creator of man.&#x2019; &#x2018;May [Zion] who was barren be exceeding glad and exult, when her children are gathered within her in joy. Blessed art Thou Who makest Zion joyful through her children.&#x2019; &#x2018;O make these loved companions greatly to rejoice, even as of old Thou didst gladden Thy creature in the Garden of Eden. Blessed art Thou Who makest bridegroom and bride to rejoice.&#x2019; &#x2018;Blessed art Thou Who hast created joy and gladness, bridegroom and bride, mirth, pleasure, exultation, love, brotherhood, peace and fellowship. Soon may there be heard in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of joy and gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the jubilant voice of bridegrooms from their canopies, and of youths from their feasts of song. Blessed art Thou Who makest the bridegroom to rejoice with the bride.&#x2019;</p>
<p>An objection was raised: [It is stated,] <italic>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn105">3</xref></sup> To what does this refer? For instance, to one who recites a benediction unnecessarily; but here he recites the benediction, &#x2018;Who created the fruit of the vine&#x2019;&#x0021; So how may he do it? He tastes of [the wine].<sup><xref rid="fn106">4</xref></sup> But the master has said: If he tasted it, he disqualifies it&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn107">5</xref></sup> He pours [some wine] from the cup into his hand and drinks it. This is possible when wine is available, but what if no wine is available? Over what may he recite the benediction? Over beer. May [one recite it] over [the juice of] the date-berry?<sup><xref rid="fn108">6</xref></sup> [If there is no wine] it must be over water or bread.</p>
<p>The question was asked: If one recited all the [seven] benedictions out of their proper sequence, or if he omitted one of them, what is the law? Come and hear: Benedictions do not invalidate one another.<sup><xref rid="fn109">7</xref></sup> Levi was present at a wedding feast and recited six<sup><xref rid="fn110">8</xref></sup> [benedictions]; deduce from this that although one is omitted we are not concerned. Perhaps there the case was different because [Levi held the view that] there was one formation.<sup><xref rid="fn111">9</xref></sup></p>
<p label="2."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn112">10</xref></sup> And whence is the benediction of bridegrooms derived from the Torah? As it is stated, <italic>And they blessed Rebekah</italic>.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. Did they, then, bless her over a cup [of wine]? This is but a support [and not a proof for the necessity of a benediction]. R. Jo&#x1E25;anan said: It is derived from the verse, <italic>And God blessed them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn113">11</xref></sup> But how will he explain that concerning [other] living creatures it is also written, <italic>And God blessed them?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn114">12</xref></sup> But [the benediction is required] because it is written, <italic>And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from the man, made He</italic> [<italic>banah</italic>]<italic> a woman;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn115">13</xref></sup> for in the coast towns they call plaits <italic>binyatha</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn116">14</xref></sup></p>
<p label="3."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn117">15</xref></sup> And whence do we derive that even a widow requires the benedictions? As it is stated, <italic>And he took ten men</italic> &#x2026; and it is further written, <italic>And all the people that were in the gate and the elders said, We are witnesses &#x2026; the Lord make</italic>, etc.<sup><xref rid="fn118">16</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. Deduce from this that the benediction of bridegrooms needs [the presence of] ten persons, and also infer that we recite the benediction even in the case of a widower who marries a widow. An objection was raised: In which cases do we recite the benediction? When a bachelor marries a spinster, or a bachelor marries a widow, or a widower marries a spinster; but not in a marriage between a widower and a widow&#x0021; There [the recital of the benediction] is during the seven days.<sup><xref rid="fn119">17</xref></sup></p>
<p label="4."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn120">18</xref></sup> After the consummation of her marriage on the first day, a bride is forbidden to her husband for the whole of the succeeding seven days. This is the view of R. Eliezer. R. Joshua said: Not until the matter is examined; if she was <italic>niddah</italic> while still in her father&#x2019;s house she is forbidden [to him], but if not she is allowed [to him].</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. Wherein do they<sup><xref rid="fn121">19</xref></sup> dispute? R. Eliezer adheres to his view [that she is forbidden] lest she was losing blood but was unaware of it. R. Joshua adheres to his view that it is possible for the matter to be examined. And how long [is she forbidden]? R. Joshua said: For three days.</p>
<p label="5."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn122">20</xref></sup> R. Eliezer was asked, &#x2018;Is it permissible to drink from [the hand of] the bride so long as her husband is sitting with her at the festive table?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;Whoever drinks from [the hand of] the bride is as though he drank from the hand of a harlot&#x2019;. [His colleagues] said to him, &#x2018;Are not the daughters of Israel possessed of good manners?&#x2019; He answered, &#x2018;God forbid&#x0021; Anyone who is not familiar with the Torah cannot be possessed of good manners&#x2019;. R. Eleazar b. Azariah made a public proclamation accompanied by the sounding of four hundred <italic>shofars</italic>, &#x2018;He who receives a cup from the bride will never be pardoned&#x2019;.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. Wherein do they<sup><xref rid="fn123">21</xref></sup> dispute? The Sages are of the opinion that since she is the daughter of a scholar she continues the customs of her father;<sup><xref rid="fn124">22</xref></sup> whereas R. Eliezer maintains that a woman follows in the ways of her husband.<sup><xref rid="fn125">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The story<sup><xref rid="fn126">24</xref></sup> is told of a woman, married to a scholar, that she used to bind the <italic>tefillin</italic> around his arm. The scholar died and she married a tax-collector and used to attach the tax-seals for him. R. Eleazar b. Azariah made a public proclamation. &#x2018;Infer from this that thinking a thing is like doing it&#x2019;. [And should you say that it is not so,] why do we then take the stricter view and declare that he<sup><xref rid="fn127">25</xref></sup> will never be pardoned? I will answer you, &#x2018; &#x201C;Thinking&#x201D; is not like &#x201C;doing&#x201D;, since it is written, <italic>If I had regarded iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not hear&#x0021;</italic>&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn128">26</xref></sup> [Thinking in connection with] a married woman is different because it is much stricter.<sup><xref rid="fn129">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Raba expounded: What is the meaning of the verse, <italic>Good and upright is the Lord; therefore doth He instruct sinners in the way?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn130">28</xref></sup> Come and see the righteousness of the Holy One, blessed be He. Whoever has the intention to perform a precept but under duress fails to perform it, Scripture accounts it to him as though he had fulfilled it;<sup><xref rid="fn131">29</xref></sup> and whoever has the intention to commit a sin is not regarded as guilty until the time of its commission; as it is written, <italic>If I had regarded iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not hear</italic>.</p>
<p label="6."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn132">30</xref></sup> He who recites a verse from the Song of Songs rendering it as a [secular] song, and similarly whoever recites a verse from the Torah unseasonably brings evil upon the world; because the Torah clothes itself in sackcloth, stands before the Holy One, blessed be He, and complains, &#x2018;Sovereign of the universe&#x0021; Thy children have made me as a harp upon which the nations [of the world] play&#x2019;. To this He replies, &#x2018;My daughter, when they rejoice what should they do?&#x2019; She makes rejoinder, &#x2018;Let them occupy themselves with the study of the Torah, the Mishnah, <italic>halakoth</italic> and <italic>&#x2019;aggadoth;</italic> and if they be unlearned let them occupy themselves with the laws of Passover on Passover, the laws of Pentecost on Pentecost and the laws of Tabernacles on Tabernacles&#x2019;. R. Simeon b. Eleazar testified in the name of R. Joshua b. &#x1E24;ananiah: Whoever reads a verse in season brings good to the world.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. How can it be like a [secular] song? For instance, he chants [the text] but his mind is on [sinful] thoughts, and the verse which he recites from the Torah unseasonably is like reciting from Lamentations. Raba said: A verse [recited] in season is like bread in time of hunger, and out of season is like bread in time of plenty.<sup><xref rid="fn133">31</xref></sup></p>
<p label="7."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn134">32</xref></sup> One who sends the cup of benediction to a woman without her husband&#x2019;s knowledge forfeits his life because his mind has prevailed over him. Rabbi [Judah the Prince] said: Because the evil inclination has prevailed over him.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. Raba said: Why is the word for &#x2018;woman&#x2019; <italic>&#x2019;ishshah?</italic> Because she is fire [<italic>&#x2019;esh</italic>]; and [why is the word for &#x2018;man&#x2019;] <italic>&#x2019;ish?</italic> Because he is fire. The letters <italic>yod</italic> from <italic>&#x2019;ish</italic> and <italic>he</italic> from <italic>&#x2019;ishshah</italic> form the Divine Name [<italic>Yah</italic>] which is conferred upon them. If they both become overheated [from sexual excitement] the Divine Name departs from them and they are [only] fire and fire.</p>
<p label="8."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn135">33</xref></sup> Similarly the members of a company who send the cup of benediction to a woman without the knowledge of her husband forfeit their lives because their minds prevailed over them. Rabbi [Judah the Prince] said: Because the evil inclination has prevailed over them.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. What need is there to state &#x2018;similarly the members of a company&#x2019;? One might [erroneously] have thought that only an individual is forbidden but not a company; therefore it teaches us that since it is done without her husband&#x2019;s knowledge any dissolute person [in the company] may have been inflamed because of her.</p>
<p label="9."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn136">34</xref></sup> He who pays money to a woman, counting it from his hand into her hand in order to gaze at her, even if he be great like Moses, who received the Torah from Sinai, will not be free from the penalty of Gehinnom; as it is stated, <italic>Hand to hand, the evil man shall not be unpunished</italic>.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. Since [sending a cup of wine to a woman] is prohibited, what is the necessity for [a separate regulation about counting] money? With the former it is forbidden if done without the husband&#x2019;s knowledge; but with the latter it is forbidden even if done with the husband&#x2019;s knowledge. Alternatively, with the former it is forbidden in the case of one who is not [suspected] of evil thoughts, but with the latter it is forbidden in the case of one who is [suspected] of evil thoughts. It has been taught: The same [rule applies] if one bride sends gifts from her festive table to another bride.<sup><xref rid="fn137">35</xref></sup></p>
<p label="10."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn138">36</xref></sup> Behold Scripture declares, <italic>And we have brought the Lord&#x2019;s offering &#x2026; armlets and bracelets, signet rings, ear-rings and girdles to make atonement for our souls before the Lord. &#x2019;E&#x1E93;adah</italic> [armlets] means a garter; <italic>&#x1E93;amid</italic> [bracelets] silk cloaks; <italic>&#x2018;agil</italic> [ear-rings] a cast of the female breasts and <italic>kumaz</italic> [girdles] a cast of the womb. For what purpose [are the words added], <italic>to make atonement for our souls before the Lord?</italic> Moses said, &#x2018;Perhaps you have returned to your former sinful lapse&#x2019;. They replied to him, &#x2018;<italic>There lacketh not one man of us</italic>&#x2019;. &#x2018;If so&#x2019;, he retorted, &#x2018;why this atonement?&#x2019; They answered, &#x2018;We have escaped sin but we have not escaped sinful thoughts&#x2019;. Hence the Rabbis declared: Whoever touches a woman&#x2019;s little finger is as though he touched &#x2018;that place&#x2019;.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. When [the Israelites] came to him,<sup><xref rid="fn139">37</xref></sup> Moses said to them, <italic>Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn140">38</xref></sup> How would they know [the latter]? Rab said:<sup><xref rid="fn141">39</xref></sup> They were made to pass in front of the <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn142">40</xref></sup> if she was a virgin her face did not turn pale, if not a virgin her face turned pale.

<p label="11."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn144">42</xref></sup> Whoever gazes upon a woman&#x2019;s heel will have children deformed from birth. Why [are children born] lame, blind, dumb or deaf? R. Eliezer said: Because [the husband] claimed marital rights but she refused. R. Joshua said: Because she declared at the time of cohabitation, &#x2018;I have been forced&#x2019;. R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: Because they talk in causeless hatred.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. Raba said: They made this statement [even] of one&#x2019;s wife. [His colleagues] remarked, &#x2018;[In that case] you do not allow people an opportunity to carry on life&#x0021;&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn145">43</xref></sup> [He replied,] &#x2018;But [the regulations on] cohabitation are as just stated, and [the deformed child] is conceived from such intercourse&#x2019;.</p>
<p>&#x2018;R. Eliezer said: Because [the husband] claimed marital rights.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn146">44</xref></sup> Then the two of them<sup><xref rid="fn147">45</xref></sup> deal with cases where force is used, so in what do they differ? One holds that it is force before cohabitation which is the cause [of children born deformed], while the other holds that it is force at the time of cohabitation which is the cause.</p>
<p label="12."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn148">46</xref></sup> R. Nehemiah said: Because of the sin of causeless hatred a man&#x2019;s wife suffers miscarriage, his children die young, and contention is rife in his house.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. It is quite reasonable [to say] that causeless hatred brings about strife, as it is written, <italic>Hatred stirreth up strifes;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn149">47</xref></sup> but whence do we learn [that it causes] miscarriage? As it is written, <italic>In vain have I smitten your children</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn150">48</xref></sup> [<italic>in vain</italic> meaning] for causeless strifes.</p>
<p label="13."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn151">49</xref></sup> R. Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Dahabai said: The Ministering Angels told me four things, viz.: Why [are children born] lame? Because [their parents] overturned their tables. Why [are children born] blind? Because [their parents] gazed at &#x2018;that place&#x2019;. Why [are children born] dumb? Because [their parents] kiss &#x2018;that place&#x2019;. Why [are children born] deaf? Because [their parents] converse during cohabitation.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. Raba said: All the attributes of the Holy One, blessed be He, [are exercised towards man on the principle of] measure for measure. Man &#x2018;overturned his table&#x2019;, therefore the feet of his children are deformed;<sup><xref rid="fn152">50</xref></sup> he gazed at the pudenda which should be hidden from all, therefore is he hidden from his children;<sup><xref rid="fn153">51</xref></sup> he showed no regard for the mouth that speaks and by which the kiss [of love] is given and kissed what is closed,<sup><xref rid="fn154">52</xref></sup> therefore the mouth of his children is closed; he conversed at a time when he should have been silent, therefore the ear [52<italic>a</italic>] of his children is silenced. Why is [a deaf person] termed <italic>&#x1E25;eresh?</italic> Because he keeps silent [<italic>&#x1E25;oresh</italic>], as it is written, <italic>And Jacob held his peace</italic> [<italic>wehe&#x1E25;erish</italic>] <italic>until they came</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn155">53</xref></sup> Raba said: All these [children are so affected only] if they are conceived from such cohabitation.</p>
<p label="14."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn156">54</xref></sup> The Sages say that the <italic>halakah</italic> is not in agreement with R. Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Dahabai; but a man may do with his wife as he desires, because the matter can be best compared to a man who purchased meat from the butcher; if he wishes he eats it roasted on coals, if he wishes he eats it salted. The matter may also be compared to fish bought from fishermen: if [the purchaser] wishes he eats it preserved in salt, if he wishes he eats it roasted, if he wishes he eats it grilled on coal.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. Since R. Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Dahabai did not make the statement on his own account [but quoted it in the name of the Ministering Angels], why did not the Rabbis agree with him? R. Jo&#x1E25;anan used the phrase &#x2018;are forbidden&#x2019;,<sup><xref rid="fn157">55</xref></sup> whereupon the Rabbis said to him, &#x2018;Seeing that you made your statement in the name of the Ministering Angels it must be so; but there is no actual prohibition against it&#x2019;. He replied, &#x2018;You must agree with me that [children are born deformed] for the reason given&#x2019;. Know that this is so, because [the Rabbis] replied to him with the phrase &#x2018;if he wishes&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn158">56</xref></sup> Why was it necessary to teach [the comparison with] &#x2018;fish bought from fishermen&#x2019;? Since they had previously cited [the comparison with] &#x2018;meat purchased from the butcher&#x2019;, he said to them, &#x2018;But in connection with meat, if a man wished for [prohibited] fat, he may not eat it&#x0021;&#x2019; They then gave [the comparison with] &#x2018;fish bought from fishermen&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn159">57</xref></sup></p>
<p label="15."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn160">58</xref></sup> Imma Shalom, the wife of R. Eliezer and sister of Rabban Gamaliel, was asked, &#x2018;Why are your children beautiful? And during intercourse how does [your husband] conduct himself towards you?&#x2019; She replied, &#x2018;He does not converse with me during the first or last watch of the night, but only during the middle watch; [and when he cohabits] he uncovers a handbreadth and covers a handbreadth, and is as though he were urged on by a demon. And when I questioned him, &#x201C;What is the reason for all this?&#x201D; he replied, &#x201C;So that another woman should not come to my mind and my children consequently come within the category of bastards&#x201D; &#x2019;.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. At first they said to her, &#x2018;Your children are beautiful&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn161">59</xref></sup> She blushed and would not say anything to them. Then they said to her, &#x2018;We are anxious to learn [a subject connected with] Torah but feel diffident [to ask you]. How does [your husband] conduct himself towards you during intercourse?&#x2019; When she perceived that such [was their purpose], she gave them a full account. Not during the first watch or during the last watch which are the normal periods for intercourse [did he cohabit], but during the middle watch which is not the normal period for intercourse.</p>
<p label="16."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn162">60</xref></sup> Hence [the Rabbis] declared: Ten categories of persons are like bastards but are not [legally] such, and they are: the children of a <italic>niddah</italic>, the children of one who is under a ban of excommunication, the children [born] of fear, the children of a woman who is forced [to cohabit], the children of a hated wife, the children of a seduced woman, the children of a wife divorced in the heart, the children of a woman thought to be another, the children of a drunken woman; and some say, the children of a brazen woman, of a woman asleep and of one who has intercourse with his betrothed in his father-in-law&#x2019;s house.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. The children of a <italic>niddah</italic> ultimately become leprous; the children of one under excommunication will ultimately be banned from the congregation of Israel, the children of fear will ultimately remove themselves from the source of holiness,<sup><xref rid="fn163">61</xref></sup> the children of a hated woman will hate the precepts [of the Torah], the children of a woman who had been forced will themselves be violated,<sup><xref rid="fn164">62</xref></sup> as for the children of a seduced woman ultimately others will seduce their heart, the children of a woman divorced in the heart will ultimately divorce themselves from all good and cleave to evil, the children of a woman thought to be another will ultimately change their faith, the children of a drunken woman will have children who will [be thought of] as though they were drunk, as it is written, <italic>How long wilt thou be drunken?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn165">63</xref></sup> which is rendered in the Targum &#x2018;demented&#x2019;. &#x2018;Some say, the children of a brazen woman&#x2019;: these are persons who are bold-faced; &#x2018;the children of a woman asleep&#x2019;: these are the sluggish. With regard to the children of &#x2018;one who has intercourse with his betrothed in his father-in-law&#x2019;s house&#x2019; there is a difference of opinion between Rab and Samuel: one says that the child is a bastard, and the other that he is the child of unknown paternity.<sup><xref rid="fn166">64</xref></sup></p>
<p label="17."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn167">65</xref></sup> If a man on leaving a privy [immediately afterwards] has intercourse, he will have epileptic children, because the demon of the privy accompanies him. How long should he wait [before having intercourse]? Long enough to walk a <italic>mil</italic>. If a man has undergone blood-letting and [immediately afterwards] has intercourse, his children will be weaklings.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. [&#x2018;Weaklings&#x2019;]<sup><xref rid="fn168">66</xref></sup> are the offspring of one who is under the ban of excommunication; ugly are the children of [intercourse when the woman is in] a doubtful state of purity.</p>
<p label="18."><small>BARAITHA</small>. <sup><xref rid="fn169">67</xref></sup>If both have undergone blood-letting and [immediately afterwards] have intercourse, their children will be liable to lupus. When does this apply? Only if they had nothing to eat. If a man has intercourse when drunk, ultimately [his heart] will be affected; if both of them are drunk their hearts will be affected. If one has intercourse standing he has attacks of trembling [<italic>&#x2019;a&#x1E25;ilu</italic>].</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn170">68</xref></sup> What is <italic>&#x2019;a&#x1E25;ilu?</italic> Fire of the bones. What is the cure for it? Flour of lentils in wine.

All remedies should be practised when standing on the ground, but this remedy even with one foot on the ground and one foot on the bed. All remedies [should be continued] three, seven or twelve [consecutive times], but this remedy until he is cured.</p>
<p label="19."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn171">69</xref></sup> He who is in the habit of taking black cumin will not suffer with pain of the heart. Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel said: Cumin is one of the deadly poisons, and as for him who sleeps to the east of his store [of cumin] his blood is on his head.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. Here is a contradiction between the Rabbis&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn172">70</xref></sup> [One speaks of cumin when] it is baked and the other when it is raw.</p>
<p label="20."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn173">71</xref></sup> If one eats cumin of the weight of a <italic>dinar</italic> his heart will be affected; so too if he eats forty nuts, forty eggs or a quarter of a <italic>log</italic> of honey.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. R. Joseph said: Only if [he eats them] on an empty stomach.</p>
<p label="21."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn174">72</xref></sup> If one eats fat beef with vegetables on the nights of the fourteenth and fifteenth of the month and sleeps in [the light of the full] moon in the summer solstice, his blood is on his head.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. What is the reason? Because his bowels are chilled and he becomes weak.</p>
<p label="22."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn175">73</xref></sup> If one stands naked in front of the lamp he will become epileptic. If one has intercourse by the light of a lamp he will have epileptic children.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. The question was asked: Is it permissible to extinguish the lamp on Festivals?<sup><xref rid="fn176">74</xref></sup> Come and hear: It is forbidden to extinguish the lamp on Festivals. One may, however, put up a partition [in front of it] or cover it with a vessel.</p>
<p label="23."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn177">75</xref></sup> If one has intercourse sitting he will be subject to diarrhoea. What is the remedy for it? Crocus of thorns. If he is below and she above this is an indecent practice [and there is danger] of the child being feeble-minded; she below and he above is the [normal] way of intercourse; if they have intercourse as one it is a form of perversion.<sup><xref rid="fn178">76</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. What is meant by [the last-mentioned]? For instance, they lie sideways; as a consequence the child [at birth] will come out in a crooked posture. Rab said: If one claims his marital rights at the period of fructification,<sup><xref rid="fn179">77</xref></sup> he should see to it that he discharges the semen in the proper manner with one thrust, as all depends upon the discharge.</p>
<p>It has been learnt:<sup><xref rid="fn180">78</xref></sup> If one has intercourse in a bed on which an infant child is lying, it will become epileptic. This, however, holds good only when the child is awake, but if it is asleep there is no harm.</p>

<title>CHAPTER II</title>
<p label="1."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn181">1</xref></sup> R. Judah said: The bold-faced are [destined] to Gehinnom and the shamefaced to the Garden of Eden. The bold-faced, R. Eliezer said, is the bastard; R. Joshua said: the son of a <italic>niddah;</italic> R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: both a bastard and the son of a <italic>niddah</italic>.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. What is R. Judah&#x2019;s reason [for his statement]? For it is written, <italic>A wicked man hardeneth his face</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn182">2</xref></sup> Since he hardens his face he is termed <italic>wicked</italic> and the wicked man is [destined] to Gehinnom. And according to R. Judah, what if he repented? He will answer: There is no [likelihood of] repentance for the bold-faced. &#x2018;The shamefaced to the Garden of Eden&#x2019;. It has been taught: The shamefaced will not easily yield to sin, as it is stated, <italic>And that His fear may be before you, that ye sin not</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn183">3</xref></sup> What is the meaning of the word for &#x2018;a bastard&#x2019; [<italic>mamzer</italic>]? R. Eliezer said: <italic>Me&#x2019;um zar</italic> [&#x2018;something strange&#x2019;].<sup><xref rid="fn184">4</xref></sup></p>
<p label="2."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn185">5</xref></sup> The elders were once sitting in the gate when two young lads passed by; one covered his head and the other uncovered his head. Of him who uncovered his head R. Eliezer remarked, &#x2018;He is a bastard&#x2019;; R. Joshua remarked, &#x2018;He is the son of a <italic>niddah&#x2019;;</italic> R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said, &#x2018;He is both a bastard and the son of a <italic>niddah</italic>&#x2019;. They said to R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba, &#x2018;How did your heart induce you to contradict the opinion of your colleagues?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;I will prove it concerning him&#x2019;. He went to the lad&#x2019;s mother and found her sitting in the market selling beans. He said to her, &#x2018;My daughter, if you will answer the question which I will put to you, I will bring you to the World to Come&#x2019;. She said to him, &#x2018;Swear it to me&#x2019;. R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba, taking the oath with his lips but annulling it in his heart, said to her, &#x2018;What is the status of your son?&#x2019; She replied, &#x2018;When I entered the bridal chamber I was <italic>niddah</italic> and my husband kept away from me, but my best man had intercourse with me and this son was born to me&#x2019;. Consequently the child was both a bastard and the son of a <italic>niddah</italic>. It was declared, &#x2018;R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba showed himself to be a great man when he contradicted his teachers&#x2019;. At the same time they added, &#x2018;Blessed be the God of Israel Who revealed His secret to R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba b. Joseph&#x2019;.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. Where can R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba [find support for his opinion] from the Torah? For it is written, <italic>They have dealt treacherously against the Lord, for they have begotten strange children</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn186">6</xref></sup> <italic>Dealt treacherously</italic> means nothing else than immorality, as it is stated, <italic>Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn187">7</xref></sup> and <italic>strange children</italic> mentioned in the verse are none but the bastard.</p>
<p>&#x2018;One uncovered his head&#x2019;: infer from this that bare-headedness is a gross form of bold-facedness. &#x2018;R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba, swearing with his lips&#x2019;: how could he do this seeing that it is written, <italic>Or if any one swear clearly with his lips to do evil?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn188">8</xref></sup> But not in his heart.<sup><xref rid="fn189">9</xref></sup> [An oath] needs no [confirmation by the decision of the] mind. He swore to her in a manner similar to which R. Jo&#x1E25;anan swore to the heathen lady and said to her, &#x2018;I will bring you to the God of Israel&#x2019;,<sup><xref rid="fn190">10</xref></sup> but annulled the oath in his mind.</p>
<p>&#x2018;And my best man had intercourse with me.&#x2019; How did he chance to be there? As it has been taught:<sup><xref rid="fn191">11</xref></sup> Formerly the best man slept in the house where the bridegroom and bride slept to examine<sup><xref rid="fn192">12</xref></sup> the bridegroom and bride [when they entered] the bridal chamber. When the husband discovered that she was <italic>niddah</italic> he kept away from her. But are best men appointed who are of doubtful character? No; but he pursued her.<sup><xref rid="fn193">13</xref></sup> &#x2018;It was declared: &#x201C;R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba showed himself to be a great man&#x201D; &#x2019;, etc. They<sup><xref rid="fn194">14</xref></sup> are described as &#x2018;his teachers&#x2019; and also as &#x2018;his colleagues&#x2019;&#x0021; When they saw that he prevailed over them, they acknowledged him as &#x2018;colleague&#x2019;.</p>
<p label="3."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn195">15</xref></sup> R. A&#x1E25;ai b. Josiah said: He who gazes<sup><xref rid="fn196">16</xref></sup> at women will eventually come within the power of sin, and he who diverts himself from sin and does not commit it, though he be an Israelite, is worthy to offer a burnt-offering on the altar as did the High Priest; as it is stated, <italic>And he sent the young men of the children of Israel, who offered burnt-offerings</italic>. And whoever makes himself indolent so as not to sin and does not commit it will be sustained by the lustre of the Divine Presence, as it is stated, <italic>And they beheld God and did eat and drink</italic>.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. The question was asked: In the Baraitha is the word to be read <italic>&#x2018;a&#x1E93;el</italic> (&#x2018;indolent&#x2019;) or <italic>&#x2019;e&#x1E93;el</italic> (&#x2018;next to&#x2019;)? We have learnt: Come and hear: [It is stated,] <italic>And upon the nobles</italic> [<italic>&#x2019;a&#x1E93;il&#x00EB;</italic>] <italic>of the children of Israel He laid not His hand</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn197">17</xref></sup> Whence can you infer that this word <italic>&#x2019;a&#x1E93;il&#x00EB;</italic> has a pure connotation? For it is written, <italic>And I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn198">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>It has been taught:<sup><xref rid="fn199">19</xref></sup> In the World to Come there is neither eating, drinking nor procreation, but the righteous sit with crowns on their heads and are sustained by the lustre of the Divine Presence, as it is stated, <italic>And they beheld God and did eat and drink</italic>. An objection was raised: [It is stated,] <italic>May he be as a rich cornfield in the land upon the top of the mountains</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn200">20</xref></sup> [The Sages] said:<sup><xref rid="fn201">21</xref></sup> The World to Come is not like this world. In this world there is the trouble to tread and gather [the grapes] but in the World to Come the Holy One, blessed be He, will bring a wind from His treasury and cause it to blow upon [the trees] so that they will let [their fruit] fall to the ground; a man will go into the field and bring back from it an abundance of its fruits for his own sustenance and that of his household. But should you think that [the reality is] as was taught, of what use is sustenance to them?<sup><xref rid="fn202">22</xref></sup> It is further written, <italic>The woman with child and her that travaileth with child together:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn203">23</xref></sup> woman is destined to bear a child every day. This is a conclusion to be deduced by arguing from the less to the great from the instance of poultry.<sup><xref rid="fn204">24</xref></sup> There is no contradiction; one statement refers to the time before the Resurrection and the other to the Messianic era.<sup><xref rid="fn205">25</xref></sup></p>
<p label="4."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn206">26</xref></sup> R. Eliezer [b. Jacob] said: Whoever masturbates is as though he committed murder, as it is stated, <italic>That slay</italic> [<italic>sho&#x1E25;e&#x1E6D;&#x00EB;</italic>] <italic>the children in the valleys</italic>. Do not read <italic>sho&#x1E25;e&#x1E6D;&#x00EB;</italic> but <italic>so&#x1E25;e&#x1E6D;&#x00EB;</italic> [&#x2018;that squeeze out&#x2019;].</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. It has been taught:<sup><xref rid="fn207">27</xref></sup> Proselytes and they who masturbate delay the advent of the Messiah. This is understandable of them who masturbate because R. Jo&#x1E25;anan said: The son of David<sup><xref rid="fn208">28</xref></sup> will not come before all the souls in the <italic>guf</italic><sup><xref rid="fn209">29</xref></sup> have been disposed of, as it is written, <italic>For the spirit that enwrappeth itself is from Me, and the souls which I have made</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn210">30</xref></sup> But why proselytes? For it has been taught:<sup><xref rid="fn211">31</xref></sup> Proselytes are as hard for Israel to endure as a sore, as it is stated, <italic>And the stranger shall join himself with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn212">32</xref></sup></p>
<p label="5."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn213">33</xref></sup> And the Sages said: Whoever masturbates, and whoever changes his word is as though he worshipped idols, as it is stated, <italic>My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a mocker</italic> [<italic>metha&#x2018;tea&#x2018;</italic>], and &#x2018;mocking&#x2019; [<italic>tha&#x2018;tea&#x2018;</italic>] means nothing else than idolatry, as it is stated, <italic>They are vanity, the work of delusion</italic> [<italic>ta&#x2018;tu&#x2018;im</italic>]. Hence the Sages declared: A man may not put his hand to his membrum. There are three [instances of abuse by] the hand, and in all three [the hand merits] amputation. The hand that is put to the membrum let it be cut off, because it causes sexual excitement; the hand that is put to the eye let it be cut off, because it leads to blindness; the hand that is put to the vein [opened for blood-letting] let it be cut off, because it leads to death. The hand strengthens the evil inclination, the hand blinds, the hand causes polypus.<sup><xref rid="fn214">34</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. What is polypus?<sup><xref rid="fn215">35</xref></sup> Abbai said: [Offensive] smell from the mouth; R. Isi said: [Offensive] smell from the nose. &#x2018;The hand that is put to the membrum let it be cut off&#x2019;. An objection was raised: [It has been taught:]<sup><xref rid="fn216">36</xref></sup> The hand that makes frequent examinations is praiseworthy&#x0021; This refers to women. But it has been taught: It also refers to men&#x0021; There it is in connection with a flux.<sup><xref rid="fn217">37</xref></sup></p>
<p label="6."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn218">38</xref></sup> <italic>Ye that inflame yourselves among the terebinths</italic>. These are they who excite themselves and masturbate. To what is he comparable? To an animal; as an animal is not mindful [of what it does] he too is not mindful of what he does. Another explanation: As an animal is destined for slaughter and has no portion in the World to Come, he too has no portion in the World to Come.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. It has been taught: He<sup><xref rid="fn219">39</xref></sup> trangresses the law on the ground of copulating and of being subjected to copulation.<sup><xref rid="fn220">40</xref></sup> And why is this so [heinous]? Because he excites the evil inclination against himself. It has been taught:<sup><xref rid="fn221">41</xref></sup> The evil inclination of a man grows more powerful within him daily, as it is stated, <italic>And that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn222">42</xref></sup> Hence our Rabbis expounded that thinking leads to desire, desire to love, love to pursuit and pursuit to [the sinful] act. This should make you realize how difficult is the return from one to the other. It is similar with repentance: abstinence leads to strictness, strictness to zeal, zeal to cleanliness, cleanliness to [levitical] purity, [levitical] purity to piety, piety to humility, and the greatest of them all is humility, as it is stated, <italic>The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to bring good tidings unto the humble</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn223">43</xref></sup> It does not mention the righteous, Israel, the pure or the pious, but <italic>to bring good tidings unto the humble</italic>.</p>
<p label="7."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn224">44</xref></sup> Of him Scripture declares, <italic>Who knoweth the spirit of man whether it goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast whether it goeth downward to the earth. Who knoweth the spirit of man:</italic> these are the righteous who do not arouse themselves to masturbate. <italic>And the spirit of the beast:</italic> these are the wicked who arouse themselves and masturbate. Whoever arouses himself and masturbates forfeits his life, as it is stated, <italic>And the thing which he did was evil in the sight of the Lord; and He slew him also</italic>.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. It has been taught: All the men of the generation of the Flood practised masturbation. There were astrologers among them who declared, &#x2018;The world will last for not less than six thousand years. We will not beget children and will live [the whole duration of] the world&#x2019;. Whereupon the Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, &#x2018;You consider yourselves the principal [creatures of the universe]; behold I will uproot<sup><xref rid="fn225">44<italic>a</italic></xref></sup> your name so that you will not be included in the reckoning of the world&#x2019;. Whence do we derive this?<sup><xref rid="fn226">45</xref></sup> Of Onan it is written, <italic>And it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother&#x2019;s wife, that he spilled</italic> [<italic>shi&#x1E25;eth</italic>] <italic>it on the ground</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn227">46</xref></sup> that is, he excited himself by lustful thoughts and masturbated. And of the generation of the Flood it is written, <italic>For all flesh had corrupted</italic> [<italic>hish&#x1E25;ith</italic>] <italic>their way upon the earth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn228">47</xref></sup> What did Er do?<sup><xref rid="fn229">48</xref></sup> [He acted] like Onan, and that is why it is written, <italic>and He slew him also</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn230">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>It has been taught: The name &#x2018;Er read backwards has the meaning of &#x2018;evil&#x2019; [<italic>ra&#x2018;</italic>]; similarly the name Noah read backwards has the meaning of &#x2018;grace&#x2019; [<italic>&#x1E25;en</italic>].</p>
<p label="8."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn231">50</xref></sup> Whoever deliberately causes an erection is liable to the death [penalty].</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. R. Ashi said: Whoever deliberately causes an erection should be excommunicated. Let him say, &#x2018;It is forbidden because he excites the evil inclination against himself&#x2019;&#x0021; Deduce from it that it is forbidden to touch the pudenda, as it has been taught:<sup><xref rid="fn232">51</xref></sup> Whoever touches his membrum when urinating is as though he brought a flood upon the world. Why? Touching leads to excitement and excitement leads to passion. It has been taught:<sup><xref rid="fn233">52</xref></sup> There is, however, a limit; from the corona downwards<sup><xref rid="fn234">53</xref></sup> [touching] is permitted and from the corona upwards<sup><xref rid="fn235">54</xref></sup> it is forbidden. When does this apply? Only with an unmarried man, but with a married man we are not afraid [that it will excite him]. Similarly it can be declared:<sup><xref rid="fn236">55</xref></sup> One cup [of wine] is becoming to a woman, two are degrading, [after] three she solicits publicly, [after] four even if an ass makes improper overtures<sup><xref rid="fn237">56</xref></sup> to her she is not particular. This applies only [to a woman] whose husband is not with her; but if her husband is with her the matter remains in doubt.<sup><xref rid="fn238">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>An objection was raised: [It is stated,] <italic>So Hannah rose up after she had eaten in Shiloh and after he had drunk:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn239">58</xref></sup> it does not say &#x2018;she had drunk&#x2019; but <italic>he had drunk&#x0021;</italic> This teaches that no allowance for wine is made for a woman.<sup><xref rid="fn240">59</xref></sup> And should you argue that her husband was with her [so why did not Hannah drink? I answer] that it was different since they were guests and guests are not permitted to have cohabitation.<sup><xref rid="fn241">60</xref></sup> But there<sup><xref rid="fn242">61</xref></sup> the intention of both [husband and wife] was to return [home immediately].</p>
<p label="9."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn243">62</xref></sup> Children meet the Divine Presence, as it is stated, <italic>A seed shall serve him; it shall be told of the Lord unto the next generation</italic>.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. The question was asked: Do [young children by their death] atone for the sin of their fathers or not? Come and hear: R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba went to a certain place<sup><xref rid="fn244">63</xref></sup> where he met a man<sup><xref rid="fn245">64</xref></sup> carrying a heavy load on his shoulder with which he was unable to proceed, and he was crying and groaning. He asked him, &#x2018;What did you do [in your lifetime]?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;There is no forbidden act in the world which I left undone, and now guards have been set over me who do not allow me to rest&#x2019;. R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba asked him, &#x2018;Have you left a son?&#x2019; He answered, &#x2018;By your life&#x0021; do not detain me because I fear the angels who beat me with fiery lashes and say to me, &#x201C;Why do you not walk quickly?&#x201D; &#x2019;. R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said to him, &#x2018;Tell me, whom have you left?&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn246">65</xref></sup> He replied, &#x2018;I have left behind my wife who was pregnant&#x2019;. R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba then proceeded to that city and inquired, &#x2018;Where is the son of So-and-so?&#x2019; [The inhabitants] replied, &#x2018;May the memory of that wicked person<sup><xref rid="fn247">66</xref></sup> be uprooted&#x2019;. He asked them the reason, and they said, &#x2018;He robbed and preyed upon people and caused them suffering; what is more, he violated a betrothed girl on the Day of Atonement&#x2019;. He made his way to the house and found the wife about to be delivered of a child. He waited until she gave birth to [a son], circumcised him and, when he grew up, took him to the Synagogue to join in public worship. Later R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba returned to that [cemetery] and [the ghost] appeared to him and said, &#x2018;May your mind be [always] at rest because you have set my mind at rest&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn248">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>With what do young children [who die] occupy themselves? It has been taught:<sup><xref rid="fn249">68</xref></sup> An angel is appointed over them who teaches them Torah, Mishnah, <italic>halakoth</italic> and <italic>&#x2019;aggadoth;</italic> as it is stated, <italic>Whom shall one teach knowledge? And whom shall one make to understand the message? Them that are weaned from the milk, them that are drawn from the breasts</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn250">69</xref></sup> To what age does this apply? [To children who die] up to five or six years of age who have not tasted sin.</p>
<p>It has been taught:<sup><xref rid="fn251">70</xref></sup> Every day an angel goes from before the Holy One, blessed be He, to destroy the world and make it revert to its original [chaos], but when the Holy One, blessed be He, looks upon the schoolchildren and scholars who sit in their Houses of Study His anger immediately turns to mercy.</p>
<p>Resh La&#x1E33;ish said in the name of R. Judah the Prince:<sup><xref rid="fn252">71</xref></sup> The world endures for the sake of the breath of schoolchildren. R. Papa said to Abbai, &#x2018;What about my and your [breath]?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;The breath of one in whom there is sin is not like the breath of one in whom there is no sin&#x2019;. Whereupon [R. Papa] retorted, &#x2018;As the world proceeds it deteriorates.<sup><xref rid="fn253">72</xref></sup> As R. Jo&#x1E25;anan said: I remember the time when boys and girls of sixteen and seventeen years of age used to gather in the marketplace<sup><xref rid="fn254">73</xref></sup> [52<italic>b</italic>] and there was no fear of their sinning&#x2019;. He replied, &#x2018;Therefore was their merit different. For R. Jo&#x1E25;anan said: I remember the time when a child would break a piece of bread<sup><xref rid="fn255">74</xref></sup> and a line of honey ran down over both his arms&#x2019;. He asked, &#x2018;Which verse [illustrates this]?&#x2019; <italic>He giveth thee in plenty the fat of wheat</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn256">75</xref></sup></p>
<p label="10."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn257">76</xref></sup> For what sin do a man&#x2019;s children die [young]? R. Eliezer said: For the sin of [unfulfilled] vows, as it is stated, <italic>In vain have I smitten your children</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn258">77</xref></sup> R. Joshua said: For the sin of [neglecting] the study of the Torah, as it is stated, <italic>Seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn259">78</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. What will R. Eliezer do with the verse, <italic>Seeing thou hast forgotten</italic>, etc.? He needs it [for the following exposition:] It has been taught: When Israel stood at Mount Sinai, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, &#x2018;Are you willing to receive the Torah?&#x2019; They answered, &#x2018;Yes&#x2019;. Whereupon He said to them, &#x2018;Produce sureties in the matter&#x2019;. They replied, &#x2018;Here are our children&#x2019;. That is what is written, <italic>Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast Thou founded strength</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn260">79</xref></sup> He said to them, &#x2018;You offer your children as sureties. If you observe the Sabbath, all will be well; but if not, behold your children are My sureties&#x2019;;<sup><xref rid="fn261">80</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>Seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God</italic>, etc. How does R. Joshua [deal with the verse quoted by] R. Eliezer? He needs it for the statement, <italic>In vain have I smitten your children, they received no correction</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn262">81</xref></sup></p>
<p label="11."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn263">82</xref></sup> R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: Whoever does not occupy himself with [the study of] the Torah causes poverty to come upon his children. What should a man do in order to have children?<sup><xref rid="fn264">83</xref></sup> R. Eliezer said: Let him freely distribute charity to the poor, as it is stated, <italic>He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the needy &#x2026; his horn shall be exalted in honour</italic>. Or, let him fulfil the wishes of his wife. R. Eliezer said:<sup><xref rid="fn265">84</xref></sup> He should speak seductively to her at the time of intercourse. R. Judah said: He should [endeavour to] make her happy at the time when he is engaged in fulfilling the commandment towards her; as it is stated, <italic>Whoso keepeth the commandment shall know no evil thing</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn266">85</xref></sup> If a man desires that his sons should possess wisdom let him examine his actions.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. What is the meaning of &#x2018;speak seductively&#x2019;? Does it mean to converse with her [during intercourse]? What, then, about the statement of R. Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Dahabai?<sup><xref rid="fn267">86</xref></sup> [It means that he should demonstrate his] love and desire for her.</p>
<p label="12."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn268">87</xref></sup> R. Eliezer [b. Jacob] said: One should not put his money into a charity bag unless it is supervised by a learned man such as R. &#x1E24;anina b. Teradion.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. What did he do?<sup><xref rid="fn269">88</xref></sup> As it has been taught:<sup><xref rid="fn270">89</xref></sup> He said to him,<sup><xref rid="fn271">90</xref></sup> &#x2018;Did anything happen to you?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;Money for <italic>Purim</italic> [distribution]<sup><xref rid="fn272">91</xref></sup> was mixed with charity funds, so I distributed [my own money] to the poor&#x2019;. He exclaimed, &#x2018;May my portion be from your portion and my lot from your lot&#x2019;.</p>
<p label="13."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn273">92</xref></sup> It is related of R. &#x1E6C;arfon that, although he was very wealthy, he did not give many gifts to the poor. Once R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said to him, &#x2018;Would you like me to purchase one or two cities for you?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;Yes&#x2019;. R. &#x1E6C;arfon went and brought four thousand golden <italic>dinars</italic>. R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba then went and distributed the money among the poor. Later R. &#x1E6C;arfon met R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba and asked him, &#x2018;Where are the cities which you purchased for me?&#x2019; R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba took him by the hand and led him to the House of Study. He brought a child who held in his hand the Book of Psalms who continued reading from it until he came to the verse, <italic>He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the needy</italic>.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. Did not R. &#x1E6C;arfon [fulfil the command], <italic>Thou shalt surely open thy hand unto thy poor and needy brother in thy land?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn274">93</xref></sup> Yes, he [was in the habit of] giving [charity]. Then why did R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba compel him? He said to him, &#x2018;In accordance with the camel is the burden&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn275">94</xref></sup> R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba then went and distributed a third [of the money] among the poor and two-thirds he divided among teachers, men who occupied themselves with the Torah and scholars. When [R. &#x1E6C;arfon] met him and asked, &#x2018;Where is my profit?&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn276">95</xref></sup> he replied, &#x2018;I have bought something for you with it&#x2019;. He asked, &#x2018;What merchandise [did you buy]? Is it something good?&#x2019; He answered, &#x2018;It is something of eternal value&#x2019;. [R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba] led him to the House of Study and [R. &#x1E6C;arfon] asked him, &#x2018;Where is it?&#x2019; He said, &#x2018;It is with David, king of Israel, as it is written, <italic>He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the needy</italic>&#x2019;. He then inquired, &#x2018;Why did you do this?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;Do you not know that when Na&#x1E33;dimon b. Gurion<sup><xref rid="fn277">96</xref></sup> walked from his house to the Temple,<sup><xref rid="fn278">97</xref></sup> woollen carpets were spread beneath his feet and the poor of Israel used to come and take them away? And yet, because he did not act as [liberally] as he should he was punished&#x2019;. [R. &#x1E6C;arfon] said to him, &#x2018;I ask you, why did you not carry out my wish?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;Did I not act [on your behalf] and give away of what belongs to you?&#x2019; Whereupon [R. &#x1E6C;arfon] exclaimed, &#x2018;I say that he who causes others [to do good] is greater than he who does [good],<sup><xref rid="fn279">98</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>And the work of righteousness shall be peace&#x2019;</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn280">99</xref></sup></p>
<p label="14."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn281">100</xref></sup> It is further related of R. &#x1E6C;arfon that he was once eating figs from his garden when his tenant found him and [not recognizing him] gave him a severe beating but [R. &#x1E6C;arfon] said nothing. When he felt that he was [almost] dying he exclaimed, &#x2018;Woe is thee, R. &#x1E6C;arfon&#x0021;&#x2019; Whereupon [the tenant] asked him, &#x2018;Are you R. &#x1E6C;arfon?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;Yes&#x2019;. [The tenant] arose, tore his hair and wept. And why [did he not disclose his identity] all that [length of time]? Because he would not make use of the honour of the Torah. Hence the Rabbis declared: Whoever makes use of the crown of the Torah has no share in the World to Come.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. And R. Jonathan b. Amram learnt it from him.<sup><xref rid="fn282">101</xref></sup> For it has been taught:<sup><xref rid="fn283">102</xref></sup> Rabbi the Holy<sup><xref rid="fn284">103</xref></sup> ordered during the years of famine that his storehouses of wheat and foodstuffs should be thrown open. What did he do? He issued a proclamation, &#x2018;Let all those enter who have studied the Scriptures, the Mishnah, <italic>halakoth</italic> and <italic>&#x2019;aggadoth</italic>, but let not the unlearned enter&#x2019;. R. Jonathan b. Amram pushed his way through and entered. [Rabbi] asked him, &#x2018;Have you studied the Torah at all?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;No&#x2019;. Whereupon [Rabbi] said to him, &#x2018;With what can I provide you?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;Master, feed me like a dog or raven&#x2019;. After he had given him food, Rabbi sat grieving and repenting and exclaimed, &#x2018;Woe is me for what I have done&#x0021; I have given my bread to an ignorant person&#x2019;. Thereupon R. Simeon his son said to him, &#x2018;Perhaps he is Jonathan b. Amram, your disciple, who does not wish ever to derive material benefit from the honour of the Torah&#x2019;. On investigation it was discovered that he was. [Rabbi] then issued a proclamation, &#x2018;Let all enter&#x2019;.</p>
<p>The question was asked: Is it permissible for an <italic>&#x2018;am ha-&#x2019;are&#x1E93;</italic> to join company [on the road] with a scholar?<sup><xref rid="fn285">104</xref></sup> Come and hear: [It is stated,] <italic>For that is thy life and the length of thy days</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn286">105</xref></sup> He has no concern for his own life,<sup><xref rid="fn287">106</xref></sup> so how can he have concern for you?</p>
<p>Our Rabbis have taught:<sup><xref rid="fn288">107</xref></sup> Five things were said of the <italic>&#x2018;am ha-&#x2019;are&#x1E93;:</italic> We do not accept evidence from him; we do not commit evidence to him; we do not join company with him on the road; we do not appoint him guardian of orphans; and we do not reveal a secret to him.</p>
<p label="15."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn289">108</xref></sup> R. Eliezer b. Jacob said: Whoever greets his teacher [with the ordinary salutation] forfeits his life. R. Eliezer b. Dahabai<sup><xref rid="fn290">109</xref></sup> said: Whoever greets his teacher [with the ordinary salutation], whoever responds to his salutation [in the ordinary way], whoever makes a statement [in the name of his teacher which] he has not heard from his mouth, and whoever opposes his School causes the Divine Presence to depart from Israel. But whoever repeats a statement in the name of his teacher brings redemption to the world; as it is stated, <italic>And Esther told the king in Mordecai&#x2019;s name</italic>.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. Our Rabbis taught: How could Mordecai have told Esther?<sup><xref rid="fn291">110</xref></sup> It teaches that all [the gates]<sup><xref rid="fn292">111</xref></sup> opened<sup><xref rid="fn293">112</xref></sup> themselves for him and he entered within [the palace] and told her all the signs.<sup><xref rid="fn294">113</xref></sup> This can be inferred by an argument from the less to the great: if it is written of the son of Esther,<sup><xref rid="fn295">114</xref></sup> <italic>I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight; I will break in pieces the doors of brass</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn296">115</xref></sup> how much more so Mordecai, one of the Elders of the Sanhedrin&#x0021;</p>
<p label="16."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn297">116</xref></sup> Who [for this purpose is to be considered] a man&#x2019;s teacher? Whoever has taught him Mishnah and Talmud, but not [only] Scripture. This is the opinion of R. Meir; R. Judah said: One from whom he has derived the greater part of his knowledge; R. Jose said: Whoever has enlightened his eyes in the [study of the] Mishnah. If [his teacher] is blind, he should not say to him, &#x2018;Master, the sun has set&#x2019;, but he should say to him, &#x2018;Remove your <italic>tefillin</italic>&#x2019;.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. According to whom is this ruling? Come and hear: For it has been taught: The ruling is according to R. Jose who said, &#x2018;Whoever has enlightened his eyes in [the study of] the Mishnah&#x2019;. Let [the Baraitha] say so&#x0021; The end of [the Baraitha] is the important point.<sup><xref rid="fn298">117</xref></sup></p>
<p>The question was asked: May one recline [at the meal on the Passover evening] in the presence of his teacher? Come and hear: A man should recline with all [people,] even a disciple in the presence of his teacher.<sup><xref rid="fn299">118</xref></sup> Abbai<sup><xref rid="fn300">119</xref></sup> said: When we were at the master&#x2019;s house<sup><xref rid="fn301">120</xref></sup> we reclined on each other&#x2019;s knees and [R.

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER III</title>
<p label="1."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn306">1</xref></sup> R. Judah [the Prince] said: The way of the disciples of the wise is to be meek and lowly of spirit.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. Whence is this derived? For it is written, <italic>Seek ye the Lord, all ye humble of the earth, that have executed His ordinance; seek righteousness, seek humility. It may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord&#x2019;s anger</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn307">2</xref></sup> When our holy Rabbi<sup><xref rid="fn308">3</xref></sup> came to this verse, he cried out and wept [because it stated,] <italic>Seek righteousness, seek humility</italic>, and perhaps&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn309">4</xref></sup> Woe to the creatures who think that death is a place of refuge and declare, &#x2018;How many iniquities we are able to guard ourselves against&#x0021;&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn310">5</xref></sup> R. Isaac b. Parnak said: All man&#x2019;s sins are engraven in his bones and all his merits are inscribed on his right hand, so that you shall not say that their sins are recorded and their merits are not. Whence [is this learnt]? As it is stated, <italic>The Lord is thy keeper, the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn311">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Joshua b. Levi said: It is necessary for a man to take these words to heart, and then he will repent of his own accord. Come and see what is written, <italic>For, lo, He that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought</italic> [<italic>si&#x1E25;o</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn312">7</xref></sup> In the hour of his death man is reminded even of his least important talk [<italic>si&#x1E25;ah</italic>]. How is this? When a man is about to die, three Ministering Angels come to him:<sup><xref rid="fn313">8</xref></sup> one is the Angel of Death, the second is a scribe and the third the angel who has been given authority over him who says to him, &#x2018;Arise, your appointed time has come&#x2019;. He replies, &#x2018;I will not come; my appointed time has not yet arrived&#x2019;. Thereupon the scribe sits down and calculates his days and years. Immediately the human being opens his eyes and, seeing the Angel of Death, trembles and falls upon his face. The Sages said: The Angel of Death extends in length from one end of the world to the other; from the sole of his foot to the top of his head he is [covered] all over with eyes; his clothing is of fire, his feet are of fire, and on the fiery sword in his hand hangs a drop of gall. From this [drop of gall] man dies, from it [the corpse] decomposes, from it his face becomes sallow, and he does not die until he beholds the Holy One, blessed be He; as it is stated, <italic>For man shall not see Me and live</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn314">9</xref></sup> [meaning,] in their lifetime they do not see Me, but at their death they do see Me, as it is stated, <italic>All they that go down to the dust shall kneel before Him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn315">10</xref></sup> Forthwith man testifies against himself all that he had done in this world. His mouth testifies and the Holy One, blessed be He, seals [his testimony], as it is stated, <italic>By Myself have I sworn, the word is gone forth from My mouth in righteousness, and shall not come back</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn316">11</xref></sup> Therefore it is necessary that a man should reflect upon his latter end, as we have learnt: R. Levi&#x1E6D;as, a man of Jabneh, said: Be exceedingly lowly of spirit, since the hope of man is but the worm.<sup><xref rid="fn317">12</xref></sup> Hence our Rabbis taught: [The way of the disciples of the wise is to be] meek and lowly of spirit.</p>
<p label="2."><small>BARAITHA</small>. [They should be] industrious and full of energy [<italic>memulla&#x2019;</italic>].</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. Some read <italic>memulla&#x2019;</italic>, others <italic>memulla&#x1E25;</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn318">13</xref></sup> [They who read <italic>memulla&#x2019;</italic> intend by it: The disciple of the wise] fills the place of his ancestors. They who read <italic>memulla&#x1E25;</italic> [interpret the word] in accordance with what is written, <italic>Seasoned with salt, pure and holy</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn319">14</xref></sup> i.e. a disciple of the wise must be pleasant towards all men<sup><xref rid="fn320">15</xref></sup> and should not be like a dish without salt.</p>
<p label="3."><small>BARAITHA</small>. [The disciple of the wise must be] submissive to and beloved by all men, and lowly of spirit towards the members of his household.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. He should not terrorize them.<sup><xref rid="fn321">16</xref></sup></p>
<p label="4."><small>BARAITHA</small>. [The disciple of the wise must be] sin-fearing, estimating a man according to his deeds, and he should say, &#x2018;As for my possessions in this world I have no desire for them because the whole world is not mine&#x2019;. He sits at the feet<sup><xref rid="fn322">17</xref></sup> of the disciples of the wise; he never takes an oath in connection with any matter; he questions according to the subject-matter and answers to the point.<sup><xref rid="fn323">18</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. Our Rabbis taught: Whence [do we know that a disciple of the wise should be] meek? From Moses our teacher, as it is stated, <italic>Now the man Moses was very meek;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn324">19</xref></sup> and on that account Moses was praised, as it is stated, <italic>My servant Moses is not so</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn325">20</xref></sup> [We learn that the disciple of the wise must be] lowly of spirit from Aaron, for it is written, <italic>For the priest&#x2019;s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of the Lord of Hosts;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn326">21</xref></sup> and it is written, <italic>The law of truth was in his mouth and unrighteousness was not found in his lips; he walked with Me in peace and uprightness, and did turn many away from iniquity</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn327">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is no one more lowly of spirit than he who pursues peace. Consider, how can a man pursue peace if he be not lowly of spirit? How [does he act]? If a man curse him, he says to him, &#x2018;Peace be upon you&#x0021;&#x2019;; should a man quarrel with him, he keeps silent; and further, if two men have quarrelled, he humbles his spirit, approaches them and effects a reconciliation between them.</p>
<p>Such, indeed, was the procedure of Aaron, the righteous. When he heard of two men who had quarrelled, he would go to one and say to him, &#x2018;So-and-so, peace be upon you, my master&#x0021;&#x2019; and he replied, &#x2018;Peace be upon you, my master and teacher&#x0021; What does my master seek here?&#x2019; He then said, &#x2018;So-and-so, your friend, sent me to you to appease you, because he declares, &#x201C;I have offended my friend&#x201D; &#x2019;. Immediately the man reflects, &#x2018;A righteous man like him has come to appease me&#x0021;&#x2019; and exclaims, &#x2018;Master, it was I who offended him&#x2019;. [Aaron] then went to the other man and said the same to him. When the two meet on the way, one says to the other, &#x2018;Forgive me for the offence which I did to you&#x2019; and the other speaks likewise.</p>
<p>When [Aaron] heard of a husband and wife who had quarrelled, he would go to the husband and say to him, &#x2018;[I have come] because I heard that you have quarrelled<sup><xref rid="fn328">23</xref></sup> with your wife; should you divorce her it is doubtful whether you will find another like her or not; and further, should you find another and quarrel<sup><xref rid="fn329">24</xref></sup> with her, the first thing she will say to you will be, &#x201C;You must have behaved in a like manner towards your first wife&#x201D; &#x2019;. In consequence of this all Israel, men and women, loved him. Know that it was so; for what does Scripture relate when Moses our teacher died? <italic>And the children of Israel wept for Moses;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn330">25</xref></sup> but of Aaron it is written, <italic>They wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn331">26</xref></sup>&#x2014;that is to say, even the women. Not only [did the women mourn], but they also covered their young children with mud and dust, thereby confirming the word <italic>all</italic>. It has been taught: Eighty thousand young men named Aaron followed Aaron&#x2019;s bier. They were the issue of those who wanted to divorce but retracted and their wives became pregnant.<sup><xref rid="fn332">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have learnt there:<sup><xref rid="fn333">28</xref></sup> Hillel said: Be of the disciples of Aaron, loving peace, pursuing peace, loving your fellow-creatures and drawing them near to the Torah. It is quite right with &#x2018;loving peace&#x2019; as we have already mentioned; but where [in the Torah] is &#x2018;pursuing peace&#x2019; [enjoined]? As it has been taught: <italic>Seek peace, and pursue it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn334">29</xref></sup> And wherein do all other precepts differ from it? A man is only under the obligation to perform them when they come to his hand, as it is written, <italic>If thou meet thine enemy&#x2019;s ox</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn335">30</xref></sup> <italic>If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn336">31</xref></sup> <italic>If a bird&#x2019;s nest chance to be before thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn337">32</xref></sup><italic> When thou buildest a new house</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn338">33</xref></sup> But as for peace [it is written], <italic>Seek peace, and pursue it</italic>&#x2014;everywhere.</p>
<p>It has been taught: [The letters of the word] <italic>shalom</italic>, &#x2018;peace&#x2019;, have the numerical value of three hundred and seventy-six and [that number] is indicated by the letters <italic>sh w &#x2018;a</italic> which form a verb meaning &#x2018;to cry for help&#x2019;. This teaches that the prayer of one who pursues peace does not go unanswered. If so, when [the name] is written &#x2018;Esau&#x2019;,<sup><xref rid="fn339">34</xref></sup> is it [an indication of] peace? Yes, there too we may say so. If, although &#x2018;peace&#x2019; is associated with his name, he shakes countries because of [the blessing given to him], <italic>And by thy sword shalt thou live</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn340">35</xref></sup> had &#x2018;peace&#x2019; not been associated with his name, how much more terror would he have caused&#x0021; But what of, <italic>They made war?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn341">36</xref></sup> It is the same there. If a word with the numerical value of <italic>shalom</italic> is associated with peoples who aimed to destroy the world and to do injury to Abraham, were the word not used how much more [disastrous would their attack have been&#x0021;] But what of, <italic>Who have done this evil thing?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn342">37</xref></sup> It is the same there. When [the evildoers] are stoned [to death], peace ensues; and if they were not stoned they would kill one another.</p>
<p>It has been taught: These four kings<sup><xref rid="fn343">38</xref></sup> planned [their attack] only on account of Abraham, as it is written, <italic>And they turned back, and came to En-mishpa&#x1E6D;</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn344">39</xref></sup> i.e. to Abraham who was the eye of the world. <italic>The same is &#x1E32;adesh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn345">40</xref></sup>&#x2014;through him the name of Heaven was sanctified. But they captured Lot mistaking him for Abraham, as it is written, <italic>And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn346">41</xref></sup> and it does not state, &#x2018;his brother&#x2019;s son&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn347">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>It has been taught: These [kings]<sup><xref rid="fn348">43</xref></sup> who were allied with Abraham were more guilty [than those opposed to them] and from their names you may learn their character: <italic>Bera</italic> [signifies that he was bent] on evil [<italic>bera&#x2018;</italic>], <italic>Birsha&#x2018;</italic> [that he was bent] on wickedness [<italic>berisha&#x2018;</italic>], <italic>Shinab</italic> [signifies] that he hated his father [<italic>sana&#x2019; &#x2019;ab</italic>], <italic>Shemeber</italic> that he made himself wings [to fly, <italic>sam &#x2019;eber</italic>], <italic>Bela</italic> that he was a swallower [<italic>bolea&#x2018;</italic>].</p>
<p>The question was asked: Is it permissible to give salutation to a heathen? Come and hear: Greetings may be given to them even on their feast day in the interests of peace.<sup><xref rid="fn349">44</xref></sup> Seeing that [the answer] is evident, why was the question asked? The question asked was, Is it permissible to salute them first? It has been taught: Better is he who greets him first than he who responds to his greetings.<sup><xref rid="fn350">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>The question was asked: Is it permissible to greet a murderer, adulterer or those who are liable to <italic>kareth?</italic> As for returning their greetings there is no question [that it is permissible], since they were the first to greet you their salutation must be returned. But how is it with greeting them first? Come and hear: [It is written,] <italic>The way of peace they know not, and there is no right in their goings; they have made them crooked paths, whosoever goeth therein doth not know peace</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn351">46</xref></sup> Hence it can be inferred that if greetings are given by those who are about to suffer the death penalty they may be returned, but not of those who save themselves [from punishment] by force. And as for greeting them first, it is prohibited in all cases. As for an adulterer and his friends, should they greet one in public their salutation is returned out of respect for the public. Some say that he who associates with an adulterer is like an adulterer. And what of the other?<sup><xref rid="fn352">47</xref></sup> [He can reply,] perhaps they were compelled to associate with him.</p>
<p>If these men<sup><xref rid="fn353">48</xref></sup> come to make peace with those with whom they quarrelled, they are not received with a full heart, even on the Day of Atonement.<sup><xref rid="fn354">49</xref></sup> The general rule is that it is forbidden to have any dealings with one who adheres [to his sins] and does not repent. What is meant by &#x2018;a full heart&#x2019;? If, for instance, one says, &#x2018;I absolve and release you&#x2019;, that is not with &#x2018;a full heart&#x2019;; [if one says,] &#x2018;May the All-merciful absolve you for what you have done to me&#x2019;,<sup><xref rid="fn355">50</xref></sup> it is.</p>
<p>The question was asked: [May one return the salutation of] an adulterer and another [man of good repute]? According to the second opinion<sup><xref rid="fn356">51</xref></sup> there is no question [that it is forbidden,] seeing that it prohibits the return of a salutation even when given by him in public; but how is it according to the first opinion?<sup><xref rid="fn357">52</xref></sup> Raba replied: Is there, then, here any question at all? He addresses himself to the two of them as one.<sup><xref rid="fn358">53</xref></sup> The question, however, does arise where there are two, one with another behind him who says nothing. He replied: He returns their salutations.<sup><xref rid="fn359">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>It has been taught: Great is peace because the world is based upon it; as we have learnt: The world is preserved by three things: by judgment, by truth and by peace.<sup><xref rid="fn360">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is written in the book of Ben Sira:<sup><xref rid="fn361">56</xref></sup> Love peace for on it the world is based. Love all people and be warned against pride because it is unbecoming<sup><xref rid="fn362">57</xref></sup> to any man. For [pride] kindles anger<sup><xref rid="fn363">58</xref></sup> and uproots the threshold<sup><xref rid="fn364">59</xref></sup> and builds up woes<sup><xref rid="fn365">60</xref></sup> instead of [the music of] tabrets. Learn from kings and princes and their entourage who worship idols, in the end they are devoured by fire.<sup><xref rid="fn366">61</xref></sup> Love humility so that you come not to poverty.<sup><xref rid="fn367">62</xref></sup> For [pride] is despised and contemptible before God;<sup><xref rid="fn368">63</xref></sup> it is unbecoming before Him Who performs mighty acts which cannot be conceived [by man]. [Before Him] myriads upon myriads of angels and Seraphim beat their wings and make them to sound as though they were playing on tabrets. From the beginning He was exalted in His heights,<sup><xref rid="fn369">64</xref></sup> robed in excellency as in a cloak,<sup><xref rid="fn370">65</xref></sup> and this is His garment always. But to those who whisper in His name He lowers His heights, and from the highest heavens He cares for the poor and orphans.

<p label="5."><small>BARAITHA</small>.

<p><small>GEMARA</small>. [&#x2018;Be not like a small door&#x2019;]: Be not impatient, because [impatience] alienates you from your fellow-men. &#x2018;Be like a lower sill&#x2019;: If a house has no lower sill it appears like a defective [or] deserted [building]; so must you be meek. Even if you possess all other virtues but lack humility, you are a defective person; for people will say, &#x2018;So-and-so would be a great man but for his pride&#x2019;. To teach you that it is so, [Scripture declares,] <italic>For he that feareth God shall discharge himself of them all</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn383">78</xref></sup> Raba said: In the same way that the sill guides the doors to close and open, so humility is a fence to wisdom.</p>
<p label="7."><small>BARAITHA</small>. And be like a lower peg on which all hang [their belongings].<sup><xref rid="fn384">79</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. Be not a passionate man since nobody will be able to ask questions of you;<sup><xref rid="fn385">80</xref></sup> for you know not the day of your passing [from the world] and your name will not be remembered. It is written in the book of Ben Sira:<sup><xref rid="fn386">81</xref></sup> Remember the day of your passing, remove [your] reproach and gather merits, for on the day of a man&#x2019;s passing neither possessions nor great strength accompany him, but only his [good] deeds go straight before him and his righteousness makes his eyes to shine.</p>
<p label="8."><small>BARAITHA</small>. If you have suffered monetary loss, remember Job who suffered both monetary loss and also [suffered] in his body.<sup><xref rid="fn387">82</xref></sup> And if you suffer in your body, remember Dathan and Abiram<sup><xref rid="fn388">83</xref></sup> who went down alive to the grave.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. [The Baraitha] cites Job and it also cites Dathan and Abiram. Should you say that Job was of the nations of the world,<sup><xref rid="fn389">84</xref></sup> then there is [the instance of] Dathan and Abiram who suffered both a monetary loss and also in their bodies.</p>
<p label="9."><small>BARAITHA</small>. Do not stumble through your eyes, for stumbling is only due to the eyes.<sup><xref rid="fn390">85</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. For so you find that &#x2018;Azza and &#x2018;Azza&#x2019;el<sup><xref rid="fn391">86</xref></sup> stumbled through their eyes; as it is stated, <italic>The sons of God saw the daughters of men</italic><sup><xref rid="fn392">87</xref></sup>.

At the Creation they spoke before the All-merciful, <italic>&#x2018;What is man, that Thou art mindful of him?&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn393">88</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, replied, &#x2018;You will see that you will err more than they&#x2019;. He caused the evil inclination to hold sway over them and they descended [to earth]. And what if they were possessed of the evil inclination, what benefit did they derive from their association [with the daughters of men]? If you argue thus, how will you explain what is written <italic>And they bore children to them?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn394">89</xref></sup> Since [the minds of the women] were concentrated on the angels when they cohabited with their husbands, the result was that their children resembled angels.<sup><xref rid="fn395">90</xref></sup></p>
<p label="10."><small>BARAITHA</small>. Do not incur shame from your teeth by overeating.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. This refers to the evil inclination; and so Scripture declares, <italic>Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn396">91</xref></sup> Perhaps the Baraitha speaks of the eating of stolen food?<sup><xref rid="fn397">92</xref></sup> [If it is argued,] It cannot enter your mind that the Baraitha alludes to sin, because if it did it should have taught &#x2018;lest thou come to sin&#x2019;&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn398">93</xref></sup> [the reply is,] It uses a euphemism, as it is written, <italic>She eateth, and wipeth her mouth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn399">94</xref></sup></p>
<p label="11."><small>BARAITHA</small>. Inquire not about heresy lest you be drawn into Gehinnom.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. Because if you associate with [heretics], they will ask you questions and you may not be able to answer them. Why [be found] among them?<sup><xref rid="fn400">95</xref></sup> Behold the world is large and it gives an opening to them who speak.<sup><xref rid="fn401">96</xref></sup> And why is it different here<sup><xref rid="fn402">97</xref></sup> in that the Baraitha mentions Gehinnom in connection with it? Because of heresy it is written, <italic>None that go unto her return</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn403">98</xref></sup> You should therefore know that the Holy One, blessed be He, created both the Garden of Eden and Gehinnom; the Garden of Eden is incomplete without the righteous and Gehinnom is incomplete without the wicked.</p>
<p label="12."><small>BARAITHA</small>. If others attribute to you a great evil let it be small in your eyes.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. Even if the allegation be serious let it be small [in your eyes], and if it be slight [regard it] as if it were nothing at all. In that event a man will never clear himself of suspicion&#x0021; And it is written, <italic>And Hannah answered and said: No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit</italic>, etc.<sup><xref rid="fn404">99</xref></sup> From this [it is to be learnt] that a person under suspicion must free himself from it&#x0021; [The Baraitha] uses the phrase &#x2018;in your eyes&#x2019;, but not so [in the eyes of your neighbours].<sup><xref rid="fn405">100</xref></sup></p>
<p label="13."><small>BARAITHA</small>. And if you have attributed a minor evil to others let it be serious in your eyes.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. It deals here with honourable men, for if [it dealt with] dissolute men what do they care? But it has been taught: We should expose hypocrites<sup><xref rid="fn406">101</xref></sup> [and this should be done] even on the Sabbath. If so, the earlier statement<sup><xref rid="fn407">102</xref></sup> must also refer to honourable and not dissolute men&#x0021; But R. Simeon said: Never in my life has the curse of my fellow gone up with me upon my bed&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn408">103</xref></sup> The earlier statement is to be understood as it is and the latter as it is.<sup><xref rid="fn409">104</xref></sup></p>
<p label="14."><small>BARAITHA</small>. Until you go and appease him.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. This statement supports R. Hamnunah who said:<sup><xref rid="fn410">105</xref></sup> [If one wrongly suspected another, he must conciliate him;] nay more, he must bless him. No, [it is no support]. There [in the teaching of R. Hamnunah it speaks of a case] when he meets his fellow by chance, but here [in the Baraitha it speaks of his] going [to appease him]. There are others who say: There is a difference here with R. Hamnunah [who can reply:] Should he not find him, he goes [searching] after him.</p>
<p label="15."><small>BARAITHA</small>. Let not your adolescence be sinful, for such is not<sup><xref rid="fn411">106</xref></sup> praise of the Torah.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. For the Torah declared, <italic>Remember then thy Creator in the days of thy youth, before the evil days come, and the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say: I have no pleasure in them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn412">107</xref></sup> And it further states, <italic>Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn413">108</xref></sup> And what means &#x2018;not praise of the Torah&#x2019;? Some say: The decrepit old man withholds himself from what he can no longer do, but in his youth he was a sinner.</p>
<p label="16."><small>BARAITHA</small>. Let your adolescence be beautiful because that is your praise.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. Since [the previous Baraitha] states, &#x2018;Let not your adolescence be sinful&#x2019;, it is self-evident that it should be beautiful&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn414">109</xref></sup> No, you might have thought that [during adolescence,] one should be in the category neither of the worthy nor the dissolute but in between.</p>
<p label="17."><small>BARAITHA</small>. Love the Torah and honour it.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. &#x2018;Love the Torah.&#x2019; Whence have we this?

And [is &#x2018;honour&#x2019;] not with words? It has been taught: He who speaks against the Torah and against the disciples of the wise has no share in the World to Come&#x0021; Say that [&#x2018;honour&#x2019;] is also with words.</p>
<p label="18."><small>BARAITHA</small>. Subordinate your will to the will of your neighbour, for so Rachel acted towards Leah and David towards Saul.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. As it is written, <italic>And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father&#x2019;s brother, and that he was Rebekah&#x2019;s son</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn418">113</xref></sup> But was he not the son of her father&#x2019;s sister? What it means is this: He said to her, &#x2018;Will you marry me?&#x2019; She replied, &#x2018;I have a sister who is older than I and [my father] will marry her to you because he is a trickster&#x2019;. He said, &#x2018;I am a trickster like him&#x2019;; as it is stated, <italic>With the merciful Thou dost show Thyself merciful &#x2026; and with the crooked Thou dost show Thyself subtle</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn419">114</xref></sup> So he gave her a token.<sup><xref rid="fn420">115</xref></sup> When [Laban] brought Leah [to the bridal chamber], Rachel said, &#x2018;Now she will be put to shame&#x2019;. What did she do? She handed the tokens to her, and consequently [it is written], <italic>And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn421">116</xref></sup> Was she then Rachel until then? Because of the tokens that were between them he did not recognize her [as Leah].<sup><xref rid="fn422">117</xref></sup> As for David&#x2019;s [subordination] to Saul, we have a tradition:<sup><xref rid="fn423">118</xref></sup> Whoever is anointed from a cruse of oil,<sup><xref rid="fn424">119</xref></sup> his royalty will not be prolonged, but whosoever is anointed from a horn, his royalty will be prolonged. Although [David] knew that eventually he would become king, he would not tell [Saul for fear of] pushing him aside.<sup><xref rid="fn425">120</xref></sup></p>
<p label="19."><small>BARAITHA</small>. Subordinate your will to the will of Heaven; for so we find that Jacob did not kiss Joseph.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. Why did he not kiss him? He thought that, since he was away from home, women may have led him astray because of his beauty; as it is written, <italic>And he presented himself unto him, and fell on his neck</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn426">121</xref></sup> [Joseph] wanted to kiss him but he would not let him do so, as it is written, <italic>And he wept on his neck a good while</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn427">122</xref></sup> That is to say, he [only] kissed him when he died, as it is written, <italic>And wept upon him, and kissed him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn428">123</xref></sup> Joseph said, &#x2018;Thirty-nine years have [passed] before him<sup><xref rid="fn429">124</xref></sup> and I have not kissed my father&#x2019;s mouth, and now shall I bury him without kissing him?&#x2019; That is the meaning of what is written, <italic>And Israel beheld Joseph&#x2019;s sons and said: Who are these?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn430">125</xref></sup> Did he not know until then who they were? But [Jacob] inquired of him whether they had been born in wedlock,<sup><xref rid="fn431">126</xref></sup> and when he showed him the <italic>kethubah</italic> his mind became at rest and he kissed them for the sake of Joseph.</p>
<p>Raba said: Infer from this that [Joseph] was aroused sexually by her;<sup><xref rid="fn432">127</xref></sup> for should you say that he was not aroused by her, it has been taught:<sup><xref rid="fn433">128</xref></sup> He laid his hand upon his heart<sup><xref rid="fn434">129</xref></sup> and exclaimed, &#x2018;Rejoice my heart, rejoice my heart&#x0021; If matters about which you are doubtful are so,<sup><xref rid="fn435">130</xref></sup> how much more those about which you are certain&#x0021; I am confident that neither worms nor decay will have power over you&#x2019;. He applied to himself the verse, <italic>My flesh also dwelleth in safety</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn436">131</xref></sup> Now he<sup><xref rid="fn437">132</xref></sup> is not mentioned among those [over whom the worms have no dominion],<sup><xref rid="fn438">133</xref></sup> how much more so Jacob who is mentioned&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn439">134</xref></sup> Therefore [we must say] that Jacob held back from kissing Joseph because of what he saw by means of the Holy Spirit.<sup><xref rid="fn440">135</xref></sup> And where is this<sup><xref rid="fn441">136</xref></sup> alluded to? As it is written, <italic>But his</italic><sup><xref rid="fn442">137</xref></sup> <italic>bow abode firm;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn443">138</xref></sup> and it is written there, <italic>Thy bow is made quite bare</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn444">139</xref></sup> What caused him to be saved? <italic>Sworn are the rods of the word.

What is the meaning of <italic>Selah?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn445">140</xref></sup> It is to be taken in the sense of <italic>The God of Jacob &#x2026; Selah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn446">141</xref></sup> It was quoted in refutation, <italic>And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister&#x2019;s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him</italic><sup><xref rid="fn447">142</xref></sup>&#x2014;is not this a case where an inference from minor to major is to be drawn? If of Laban who kissed idols and harlots it is so written,<sup><xref rid="fn448">143</xref></sup> Joseph who did not kiss these [yet did not kiss Jacob]&#x0021; Perhaps the verse should not have written this, but it points to Jacob&#x2019;s merit. [It indicates,] <italic>And he</italic> [Laban] <italic>ran to meet him</italic>, i.e. he wanted to kiss him but [Jacob] would not permit him; he then embraced him again to kiss him, whereupon he struck [Laban] on his cheek. This may be proved from the fact that it is written <italic>wayyenashshe&#x1E33;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn449">144</xref></sup> and not <italic>wayyishsha&#x1E33;</italic>. Hence it is proved; here it is written, <italic>And he kissed them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn450">145</xref></sup> and [continues], <italic>And embraced them</italic>.</p>
<p>What is the difference between <italic>wayyishsha&#x1E33;</italic> and <italic>wayyenashshe&#x1E33;?</italic> The latter<sup><xref rid="fn451">146</xref></sup> indicates [kissing] with the whole body, the former [only] with the mouth. Whence do we know that this is so? For it is written, <italic>He kisses</italic> [<italic>yishsha&#x1E33;</italic>] <italic>the lips that giveth a right answer</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn452">147</xref></sup> Wherever <italic>wayyishsha&#x1E33;</italic> occurs it denotes a [light] impress to be added to the count.<sup><xref rid="fn453">148</xref></sup> Come and hear: [It is stated,] <italic>And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck and kissed him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn454">149</xref></sup> Is not this [act of kissing] similar to what Laban did? The reply is: Go and see how many teeth were dug into him.<sup><xref rid="fn455">150</xref></sup> And why? Because he [really] wanted to bite him, but at the time his teeth became as [soft as] wax and he knocked his jaws against Jacob&#x2019;s neck and became weak. To that episode David alluded when he said, <italic>Arise, O Lord; save me, O my God; for Thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek, Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn456">151</xref></sup></p>

<p><small>GEMARA</small>.

<p label="21."><small>BARAITHA</small>. Hold aloof from what is repulsive and from what resembles it, lest others suspect you of sin.</p>

<p><small>GEMARA</small>. Whence do we learn this? From the instance of the serpent; as it is written, <italic>The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent&#x2019;s food</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn463">158</xref></sup> Raba said: Hence it may be inferred that the wolf, lion, bear and leopard sinned and the All-merciful made them hated by His creatures; but the reason why they will be healed is that their guilt is not like the serpent&#x2019;s. The wolf is the first to pounce [upon its prey], the lion the first to steal; but as for the serpent, because it engaged in slander there is no healing for it.</p>
<p label="23."><small>BARAITHA</small>. Do not be free with vows for vows lead to oaths; and do not eat food with the <italic>&#x2018;am ha-&#x2019;are&#x1E93;</italic> lest you come to profane the sacred food of Heaven.</p>

As it is written, <italic>He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that harpeth on a matter estrangeth a familiar friend</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn468">163</xref></sup> This is what is meant: Refrain from grumbling about matters which concern you personally, so as not to grumble against others and be drawn to further sin.

<p label="25."><small>BARAITHA</small>. Seven patriarchs were under [divine] covenant and they are: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, Phinehas and David.

<p>Come and hear: [It is written,] <italic>Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, I have made a covenant with your fathers</italic><sup><xref rid="fn481">176</xref></sup>&#x2014;this is a refutation of R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba&#x0021; He can reply: This is rather a support for me, for it is written, <italic>But your fathers hearkened not unto Me</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn482">177</xref></sup> Come and hear: [It is written,] <italic>Gather My saints together unto Me; those that have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice&#x0021;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn483">178</xref></sup> This is certainly a refutation [of R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba&#x2019;s statement].</p>

<ftnote id="fn438">(133) Cf. B.B. 17a (Sonc. ed., p. 86): &#x2018;There are seven over whom the worms had no dominion, viz. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, Moses, Aaron and Miriam, and Benjamin, son of Jacob&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn439">(134) How could Jacob then doubt the innocence of Joseph, seeing that the sin of suspecting the innocent would have lost him that privilege?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn440">(135) He was inspired by God to do so in order that Joseph should not communicate her moral impurity to him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn441">(136) Joseph&#x2019;s moral impurity.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn442">(137) i.e. Joseph&#x2019;s.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn443">(138) Gen. XLIX, 24. The word <italic>bow</italic> is found in both the passages cited. On the exegetical rule of <italic>Gezerah Shawah</italic>, inference from analogous phraseology, what applies to one applies also to the other. In Hab. the <italic>bow</italic> is described as being <italic>bare</italic>, <italic>&#x2018;eryah</italic>, which is equated with <italic>&#x2018;erwah</italic>, &#x2018;forbidden intercourse&#x2019;. Consequently the use of <italic>bow</italic> in connection with Joseph indicates that there was an occasion when he was aroused sinfully.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn444">(139) Hab. III, 9. The Heb. <italic>ma&#x1E6D;&#x1E6D;eh</italic> can mean &#x2018;rod&#x2019; or &#x2018;tribe&#x2019;. The Rabbinic interpretation is that God swore to Jacob that the tribes descended from him would be pure.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn445">(140) <italic>The word</italic>. <italic>Selah</italic> is by a process of analogy equated with the words <italic>the God of Jacob &#x2026; Selah;</italic> that is to say, the word sworn by the God of Jacob to him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn446">(141) Ps. XLVI, 12.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn447">(142) Gen. XXIX, 13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn448">(143) That he kissed Jacob.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn449">(144) There are two Heb. roots with the same letters, one meaning &#x2018;to kiss&#x2019; and the other &#x2018;to be equipped with weapons&#x2019;, and the verb in the verse is given the second sense, i.e. he attacked him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn450">(145) Gen. XLVIII, 10, where the verb is <italic>wayyishsha&#x1E33;</italic> and denotes an expression of love.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn451">(146) Which is an intensive form of the verb.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn452">(147) Prov. XXIV, 26.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn453">(148) A single gesture which may form part of a further display of affection subsequently.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn454">(149) Gen. XXXIII, 4, the verb being <italic>wayyishsha&#x1E33;</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn455">(150) In the Heb. text the word has dots over the letters, which are taken by the Midrash to indicate that Esau&#x2019;s real intention was to bite Jacob. [Cf. ARN, p. 165.]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn456">(151) Ps. III, 8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn457">(152) The text both in the Baraitha and Gemara is corrupt, the wording <italic>hammebarek</italic>, &#x2018;he who blesses&#x2019;, being unintelligible. Cf. on DEZ I, 11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn458">(153) The two versions in the Baraitha.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn459">(154) The meaning is uncertain and may be this: Always leave room for reconsideration where there is no finality, and do not be stubbornly wedded to an opinion. &#x2018;What of it?&#x2019; suggests too much arrogance; &#x2018;perhaps&#x2019;, although it expresses uncertainty, is coupled with humility. Where the &#x2018;words of the Torah&#x2019; are concerned there must be humility, for only the humble can hope to penetrate the deep truths of the Torah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn460">(155) Lev. XVIII, 30.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn461">(156) Cf. Yeb. 21a (Sonc. ed., p. 124): &#x2018;Provide a charge to My charge&#x2019;, i.e. add restrictive measures to safeguard the precepts.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn462">(157) His victims are too numerous and scattered for him to be able to make it right with them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn463">(158) Isa. LXV, 25. In the Messianic era, whereas all wild animals will revert to natural food and a peaceful life, the serpent alone will be condemned to continue to eat dust (Gen. III, 14). Cf. Midrash Rabbah, Genesis, XX, 5 (Sonc. ed., p. 163).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn479">(174) Jer. XXXI, 30f, in A.J. XXXI, 31f. Because the generation of the Wilderness broke the covenant by their murmurings against God they lost their share in the World to Come, and only when God will renew the covenant with Israel and Judah will they again be entitled to a share.</ftnote>

<p label="1."><small>BARAITHA</small>. Let your words be for the sake of Heaven,<sup><xref rid="fn511">1</xref></sup> love Heaven, fear Heaven; be eager and rejoice in all the commandments.<sup><xref rid="fn512">2</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. What means [&#x2018;for the sake of Heaven&#x2019;]? One should not act in such a way that people will say of him, &#x2018;So-and-so does this publicly&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn513">3</xref></sup> And do not speak of &#x2018;love [Heaven]&#x2019; but &#x2018;pursuit [of Heaven]&#x2019;, as it is written, <italic>After the Lord your God shall ye walk</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn514">4</xref></sup> But is it possible for a man to walk after God seeing that it is written, <italic>For the Lord thy God is a devouring fire?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn515">5</xref></sup> [He does so] by benefiting scholars and righteous men [from his means].<sup><xref rid="fn516">6</xref></sup> &#x2018;Be eager.&#x2019; Let your heart rejoice in beautifying<sup><xref rid="fn517">7</xref></sup> every precept.</p>
<p label="2."><small>BARAITHA</small>. Be like a split bottle and like a deep garden-bed.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. What need is there for the Baraitha to repeat this?<sup><xref rid="fn518">8</xref></sup> It was necessary because otherwise you might have thought that this refers [only] to words of Torah and as for the commandments it would be self-evident. On the contrary, it was necessary [to repeat it] here.</p>
<p label="3."><small>BARAITHA</small>. Sit before the elders and incline your ear to listen to their words.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. As it is written, <italic>Ask thy father, and he will declare unto thee, thine elders and they will tell thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn519">9</xref></sup></p>
<p label="4."><small>BARAITHA</small>. Endeavour in connection with their words to reply on the first point first and on the last point last.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. We have learnt there:<sup><xref rid="fn520">10</xref></sup> Seven marks distinguish an uncultured man and seven a wise man. Why does [the Mishnah] first mention the uncultured man? It should have mentioned the wise man [first]&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn521">11</xref></sup> Further, why [immediately after mentioning the uncultured man does it enlarge upon the marks] of the wise man [without first enumerating the marks of the uncultured man]?<sup><xref rid="fn522">12</xref></sup> Because [the Mishnah] wishes to state, &#x2018;The wise man does not speak before him who is greater than he in wisdom&#x2019;. Let, then [the Mishnah] state, &#x2018;The uncultured man speaks&#x2019;, etc.&#x0021; The teacher enumerates the merits of the wise, and as for the uncultured the converse [applies to them].</p>
<p>R. A&#x1E25;a said to Raba, &#x2018;Whence do we know from the Torah that one should speak to the first thing first and the last thing last?&#x2019; [He replied,] &#x2018;Whence [do we know it]? It is a Rabbinical teaching&#x2019;. [R. A&#x1E25;a] retorted, &#x2018;According to your reasoning, whence are all of them<sup><xref rid="fn523">13</xref></sup> derived?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;I will tell you them [all from the Torah]. &#x201C;The wise man does not speak, etc.&#x201D; [can be learnt] from Hushai, as it is written, <italic>Shall we do after his saying? if not, speak thou</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn524">14</xref></sup> &#x201C;He does not break in upon the speech of the wise&#x201D;, as it is written, <italic>And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking &#x2026; then spoke Azariah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn525">15</xref></sup> &#x201C;He is not hasty to answer&#x201D;, as it is written, <italic>Be not rash with thy mouth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn526">16</xref></sup> &#x201C;He questions according to the subject&#x201D;, as it is written, <italic>And he asked them &#x2026; Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spoke? Is he yet alive?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn527">17</xref></sup> And they answered, <italic>Thy servant our father is well, he is yet alive</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn528">18</xref></sup> &#x201C;He speaks to the first point first&#x201D;, as it is written, <italic>And (he) said: Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee. Is there room in thy father&#x2019;s house for us to lodge in?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn529">19</xref></sup> And it is written, <italic>And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn530">20</xref></sup> and then, <italic>We have both straw and provender enough</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn531">21</xref></sup> &#x201C;And he acknowledges the truth&#x201D;: This refers to Moses, as it is written, <italic>And when Moses heard that, it was well-pleasing in his sight;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn532">22</xref></sup> and it is written, <italic>For he hath spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God&#x2019;</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn533">23</xref></sup></p>
<p label="5."><small>BARAITHA</small>. If you desire to learn, do not say of what you do not understand, &#x2018;I understand it&#x2019;. If you are asked a question about something in which you are not well versed do not be ashamed to say, &#x2018;I do not know&#x2019;. If you are taught something and you do not understand it, be not ashamed to say, &#x2018;I do not understand it&#x2019;.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. Whence do we learn this? [From David], for it is written, <italic>I will also speak of Thy testimonies before kings, and will not be ashamed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn534">24</xref></sup>&#x2014;that is, [to inquire] of Mephibosheth<sup><xref rid="fn535">25</xref></sup> how to act, whether to declare it forbidden or permissible.</p>
<p label="6."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn536">26</xref></sup> Do good deeds for the sake of their Maker.<sup><xref rid="fn537">27</xref></sup> Do not make them a crown wherewith to adorn yourself, or an axe wherewith to cut. Accustom yourself to take upon yourself the precepts of the Torah [even] at the cost of suffering.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. [&#x2018;Do not make them a crown&#x2019;, etc.,] lest you receive your share [of the World to Come] in this world; for he who glorifies himself with the crown of the Torah has no share in the World to Come.<sup><xref rid="fn538">28</xref></sup> [&#x2018;Nor an axe wherewith to cut.&#x2019;] Do not withhold corn<sup><xref rid="fn539">29</xref></sup> from others; for [53<italic>b</italic>] even the embryos [in their mothers&#x2019; wombs] curse him who withholds corn from others. Here<sup><xref rid="fn540">30</xref></sup> [only if he is asked to teach] without payment [is he under the curse], but there<sup><xref rid="fn541">31</xref></sup> even if he is offered payment [and refuses to teach].</p>
<p>[&#x2018;Accustom yourself to take upon yourself the precepts&#x2019;, etc.] It has been taught:<sup><xref rid="fn542">32</xref></sup> Whoever maintains himself by words of Torah, the Torah does not become intimate with him. There<sup><xref rid="fn543">33</xref></sup> it speaks of self-pleasure and here<sup><xref rid="fn544">34</xref></sup> of sleep.</p>
<p label="7."><small>BARAITHA</small>. Do not resent an insult to you. A good record and a blameless adolescence [inspire] security and truth.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. [&#x2018;Do not resent an insult to you.&#x2019;] How is this meant? [Do not boast,] &#x2018;So-and-so did such-and-such to me and I have not retaliated&#x2019;. What is meant by &#x2018;a good record&#x2019;? Do 1 ot [give cause] to be included in the number of the dissolute, lest people say, &#x2018;How many dissolute persons there are here, including you among them&#x0021;&#x2019; &#x2018;And a blameless adolescence.&#x2019; But this has already been taught in the preceding chapter&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn545">35</xref></sup> There it speaks of his actual doing evil and here [of not giving cause for suspicion] against him. &#x2018;[Inspire] security.&#x2019; Some say [that this means]: One should have a sense of security so that the Torah becomes rolled<sup><xref rid="fn546">36</xref></sup> up in his heart. Others [explain]: Inspire confidence in those who ask of you. The latter interpretation conforms to the wording of the Baraitha, &#x2018;and truth&#x2019;, which implies: Do not falsify confidence [which is placed in you].</p>
<p label="8."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn547">37</xref></sup> Be submissive to a superior, patient under oppression, of cheerful appearance and keep away from sin.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. &#x2018;Be submissive to a superior&#x2019;: that is, to the ruling power. &#x2018;Patient under oppression&#x2019;: that is, forced labour as happened with R. Eleazar b. &#x1E24;arson.<sup><xref rid="fn548">38</xref></sup> &#x2018;Be of cheerful appearance&#x2019;: can one [always] keep his appearance cheerful? [Yes]; for when R. Dimi came he said: The man who [by smiling] shows his teeth white [to his fellow] is better than he who gives him milk to drink.<sup><xref rid="fn549">39</xref></sup> What is to be derived from this statement? As illustrated by the experience of R. Bero&#x1E33;a.<sup><xref rid="fn550">40</xref></sup> &#x2018;Keep away from sin&#x2019;: so that all can speak about you and you have no need to clear yourself of suspicion.</p>
<p label="9."><small>BARAITHA</small>. Refrain from committing a light sin lest it lead you to one that is grievous. Be mindful of a small precept that it may lead you to one that is important.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. It has been learnt:<sup><xref rid="fn551">41</xref></sup> Ben &#x2018;Azzai said: Run to do a slight precept and flee from transgression. There [it speaks of fleeing from sin] of one&#x2019;s free will; here [of fleeing] even when under compulsion. [The proof of this is that the Baraitha] teaches, &#x2018;Refrain, etc.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn552">42</xref></sup></p>
<p label="10."><small>BARAITHA</small>. If you desire to gain the love of your friend,<sup><xref rid="fn553">43</xref></sup> busy yourself with his welfare. If you desire to keep away from sin consider where it eventually leads. Attach yourself lovingly to the precepts. Be proud and happy to speak diligently and sing of its details.<sup><xref rid="fn554">44</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. &#x2018;If you desire to gain the love&#x2019;, etc. As it is written, <italic>But thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn555">45</xref></sup> Because you love your neighbour as yourself he is like yourself. &#x2018;If you desire to keep away from sin consider where it eventually leads.&#x2019; As it is written, <italic>The wise man, his eyes are in his head</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn556">46</xref></sup><italic> But the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn557">47</xref></sup> he regards only what is before him and ignores the consequences. &#x2018;Attach yourself lovingly to the precepts&#x2019;, by respecting those who fulfil the precepts. &#x2018;Be proud&#x2019;, etc., by inquiring into the reason of a precept.</p>
<p label="11."><small>BARAITHA</small>. If He has bestowed upon you a small bounty, let it be in your eyes as great and you need to give thanks that He cared<sup><xref rid="fn558">48</xref></sup> for you and bestowed bounty upon you.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. &#x2018;If He has bestowed&#x2019;, etc. Whence do we learn this? For it is written, <italic>And thou shalt eat and be satisfied, and bless the Lord thy God for the good land which He hath given thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn559">49</xref></sup> And whence do we know that one is obliged [to bless God] although he has not eaten to satisfaction? For it is written, <italic>Give the people that they may eat</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn560">50</xref></sup> and it is written, <italic>And they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of the Lord</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn561">51</xref></sup> [which means] blessing [God]. An objection was raised against this: [It is stated,] <italic>He restored the border of Israel &#x2026; according to the word of the Lord, the God of Israel, which He spoke by the hand of His servant Jonah, the son of Amittai&#x0021;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn562">52</xref></sup> There, too, it was a case of thanksgiving.<sup><xref rid="fn563">53</xref></sup> Come and hear: [It is stated,] <italic>According to the word of the Lord, which He spoke to Elijah&#x0021;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn564">54</xref></sup> There, too, say that [<italic>the word of the Lord</italic>] implies: Blessed be He Who has fulfilled His promise [to inflict punishment upon the house of Ahab]. Come and hear: [It is stated,] <italic>According unto the saying of the Lord, which He spoke by the hand of His servant A&#x1E25;ijah the Shilonite&#x0021;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn565">55</xref></sup> And if you think it is as you said [that the phrase means thanking God, how will you explain this verse?] There<sup><xref rid="fn566">55<italic>a</italic></xref></sup> it is written <italic>by the hand of</italic>, here<sup><xref rid="fn567">56</xref></sup> it is without any qualification.<sup><xref rid="fn568">57</xref></sup></p>

<p><small>GEMARA</small>. Whence do we learn this? From the Gibeonites.<sup><xref rid="fn584">73</xref></sup> Raba objected, &#x2018;Must we, then, learn this from the Gibeonites as otherwise we would not know it?&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn585">74</xref></sup> R.

<p>Also Joshua was punished on this account.

<title>CHAPTER V</title>
<p><small>BARAITHA</small>. <sup><xref rid="fn621">1</xref></sup>Judge your words before you let them come forth from your mouth. Plan your deeds in accordance with good manners and so add to the furtherance of your progress.<sup><xref rid="fn622">2</xref></sup> Always accept with resignation the verdict against you and refrain from grumbling. Judge your fellow-man in the scale of merit and do not judge him in the scale of guilt. Rejoice in your portion; be content<sup><xref rid="fn623">3</xref></sup> with the little you have and do not hate him who reproves you. Be small in your eyes so that your portion may be blessed for ever. Regard everyone with a good eye and a considerate soul. Teach your tongue to say, &#x2018;I do not know&#x2019; lest you be induced to tell a falsehood and be caught.<sup><xref rid="fn624">4</xref></sup> If you are slack in the performance of one precept<sup><xref rid="fn625">5</xref></sup> in the end you will neglect another like it. If you feel impelled<sup><xref rid="fn626">6</xref></sup> to make light of it in the end you will make light of another like it, and you will have no reward for your trouble. If you have taken what is not yours, then what is yours will be taken from you. Be careful with sacred foods both in the eating and disposing of them. Be submissive and beloved when answering those whom you know.<sup><xref rid="fn627">7</xref></sup> Be submissive towards all men and towards the members of your household more than to all men.</p>
<p>The beginning of vows is the door to folly; the beginning of impurity [in conduct] is the door to idolatry; levity with women is the door to immorality. If you become surety, it is on the condition that you will have to pay; if you borrow, it is on the condition that you will pay back; if you lend, it is on the condition [that there is a possibility of] not being paid back. Hasten to settle your account.<sup><xref rid="fn628">8</xref></sup> One who gains a good name gains it for himself. The shamefaced cannot learn, the impatient cannot teach, the <italic>&#x2018;am ha-&#x2019;are&#x1E93;</italic> cannot be pious, the empty-headed cannot be God-fearing, and who is engaged over much in business cannot acquire wisdom.<sup><xref rid="fn629">9</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. &#x2018;Judge [your words]&#x2019;: so that a man may consider what to answer and what answer might be given to him.</p>
<p>&#x2018;Accept with resignation&#x2019;: [Admit that the judge] has given a correct judgment, that he has rightly condemned, that he has judged well.</p>
<p>&#x2018;Refrain from grumbling&#x2019;: But this has already been taught&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn630">10</xref></sup> There it speaks of matters concerning himself, here of matters relating to the Holy One, blessed be He.</p>
<p>&#x2018;Judge your fellow-man&#x2019;, etc.: when the matter is known to you.</p>
<p>&#x2018;Do not judge him in the scale of guilt&#x2019;: by not abiding by the verdict when he wins it.</p>
<p>&#x2018;Rejoice in your portion&#x2019;: That is [in your] wife; for Scripture declares, <italic>For what would be the portion of God from above?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn631">11</xref></sup> and it further states, <italic>House and riches are the inheritance of fathers; but a prudent wife is from the Lord</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn632">12</xref></sup> &#x2018;Be content with the little you have&#x2019;&#x2014;in the matter of food. &#x2018;Hate the &#x201C;how much?&#x201D; &#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn633">13</xref></sup> But this has already been taught in a previous chapter&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn634">14</xref></sup> There it refers to general matters; here [it means that] one should not say, &#x2018;How much [I would like to be the husband of] So-and-so&#x2019;s daughter if she were unmarried&#x0021;&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x2018;Be small in your eyes.&#x2019; As it is written, <italic>In whose eyes a vile person is despised</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn635">15</xref></sup> &#x2018;So that your portion may be blessed.&#x2019; As it is written, <italic>Let thy fountain be blessed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn636">16</xref></sup> &#x2018;Regard everyone with a good eye.&#x2019; As it is written, <italic>He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn637">17</xref></sup> &#x2018;And a considerate soul.&#x2019; As it is written, <italic>And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn638">18</xref></sup> &#x2018;Teach your tongue.&#x2019; As it is written of Ahimaaz.<sup><xref rid="fn639">19</xref></sup> &#x2018;If you are slack.&#x2019; As it is written, <italic>If thou faint in the day of adversity</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn640">20</xref></sup> &#x2018;Be submissive and beloved&#x2019;&#x2014;but this has already been taught&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn641">21</xref></sup> There<sup><xref rid="fn642">22</xref></sup> it certainly refers to being so before the All-present.</p>
<p>&#x2018;The beginning of vows &#x2026; levity with women.&#x2019; It is not necessary [to mention this] except in connection with one&#x2019;s wife. &#x2018;If you become surety.&#x2019; As it is written, <italic>Take</italic> [<italic>le&#x1E33;a&#x1E25;</italic>] <italic>his garment that is surety for a stranger</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn643">23</xref></sup> Here it is written <italic>le&#x1E33;a&#x1E25;</italic> and in another verse it is written <italic>&#x1E33;a&#x1E25;: Take</italic> [<italic>&#x1E33;a&#x1E25;</italic>] <italic>his garment that is surety for a stranger&#x0021;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn644">24</xref></sup> [It indicates] that whoever is surety for another and does not repay [if called upon to do so] is regarded as though he incurred the debt and did not repay. If you borrowed with the intention to repay, all is well; but if you lent with the intention not to demand it,<sup><xref rid="fn645">25</xref></sup> then &#x2018;split&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn646">26</xref></sup> If so, the consequence is that the money is lost&#x0021; We deal here with the disciples of the wise who will not transgress [the teaching of Scripture], <italic>The wicked borroweth, and payeth not; but the righteous dealeth graciously, and giveth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn647">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x2018;Hasten to settle your account.&#x2019; This is good advice offered to the disciples of the wise, that when they have business deals with men of the world not to be neglectful and incur one loss after another.</p>
<p>&#x2018;One who gains a good name.&#x2019; As it is written, <italic>If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn648">28</xref></sup> &#x2018;The empty-headed man cannot be God-fearing.&#x2019; Since he is ignorant of the Torah, he does not know how to keep away from sin. &#x2018;The <italic>&#x2019;am ha-&#x2019;are&#x1E93;</italic> cannot be pious.&#x2019; Why? Since he has not learnt the words of the Torah, the verse is applied to him, <italic>He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer is an abomination</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn649">29</xref></sup> &#x2018;The shamefaced cannot learn, the impatient cannot teach.&#x2019; This is self-evident&#x0021; No, [it was necessary to mention it to make clear that it holds good] even in matters of behaviour.</p>
<p>Father<sup><xref rid="fn650">30</xref></sup> Elijah, may his memory be for good, said, &#x2018;The knowledge of the Torah cannot be spread except by one who is not impatient. I, too, will not reveal myself except to one who is not impatient&#x2019;. Happy is the man who met [Elijah] and sat with him, for he is assured of being a son of the World to Come.</p>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER VI</title>
<p>Ben &#x2018;Azzai said:<sup><xref rid="fn651">1</xref></sup> Whoever keeps four things before his eyes will never sin again, viz. whence he came, whither he goes, what will become of him, and Who will be his Judge. Whence he came: from a putrefying secretion, from a place which the eye cannot see. And whither he goes: to a place of darkness and deep gloom. And what will become of him: worms and maggots. And Who will be his Judge: the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He. R. Simeon said: He came from a place of defilement, he came from a place of uncleanness and is destined to defile others. He came from a putrefying secretion and goes to a place of worms and maggots, as it is stated, <italic>How much less man, that is worm&#x0021; and the son of man, that is a maggot&#x0021;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn652">2</xref></sup> R. Eliezer b. Jacob said: <italic>Man</italic>, that is maggot in his lifetime, alluding to vermin; <italic>and the son of man</italic>, that is worm in his death. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: Man is beautiful and splendid, but he brings forth from his inwards something that the eye cannot [bear to] see. To what can this be compared? To a human king who built a large, beautiful and magnificent palace through which a stream of water from a tannery flowed. Every passer-by exclaimed, &#x2018;How beautiful would this palace be but for the stream from the tannery flowing through it&#x0021;&#x2019; So it is with man who resembles [that palace]. Even when he brings forth from his inwards something disgusting which the eye cannot [bear to] see he prides himself before the All-present.<sup><xref rid="fn653">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>When R. Eliezer was dying, his disciples came and sat down before him and said to him, &#x2018;Our teacher, teach us a law&#x2019;. He replied, &#x2018;What shall I teach you? Go forth and be mindful of each other&#x2019;s honour; and when you pray know before Whom you stand, for through this you will enter into the life of the World to Come&#x2019;. R. Eleazar b. Azariah said: Five things did R. Eleazar teach us when he was dying, and gladdened us with them more than with what he taught us during his lifetime, viz. the ball, the shoemaker&#x2019;s last, the amulet, the phylactery, and a round cushion; be mindful of these and immerse them [for purification] just as they are, because they are established laws which were commanded to Moses on Sinai.<sup><xref rid="fn654">4</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. What does Ben &#x2018;Azzai mean by his statement, &#x2018;Whoever takes four things to heart will never sin&#x2019;? Raba said: The divine attribute of Mercy<sup><xref rid="fn655">5</xref></sup> has four qualities and so too has Satan. Whoever sets his heart on four things is a sinner, viz. wealth, woman, the evil inclination and strife. It is necessary [to enumerate them all]. If it [only] cited &#x2018;woman&#x2019;, I might have said that it is because of the prohibition of a married woman, a <italic>niddah</italic> or a Gentile woman;<sup><xref rid="fn656">6</xref></sup> therefore it adds &#x2018;the evil inclination&#x2019; to include all prohibited unions. If it [only] cited &#x2018;the evil inclination&#x2019;, I might have said that this only holds good when he is unmarried, but where he has a wife [there need be] no [concern about the evil inclination]. Therefore [it is made clear] that even when he has a wife it is prohibited [to neglect this] lest something forbidden chances to come his way [and he sins]. If it [only] cited &#x2018;the evil inclination&#x2019;, I might have said that the prohibition holds good only where it concerns his person but not where money [is involved], therefore it adds &#x2018;riches&#x2019;. And if it [only] cited &#x2018;riches&#x2019;, I might have said that it is because it concerns money but not if it was connected with strife.<sup><xref rid="fn657">7</xref></sup> Therefore it was necessary [to enumerate them all].</p>
<p>The question was asked: May one say, &#x2018;Would that I had So-and-so&#x2019;s money&#x0021; Would that I had a wife like So-and-so&#x2019;s wife&#x0021;&#x2019;? May one sleep in one bed with his wife who is <italic>niddah</italic> or not? May one quarrel with a man with whom it is not fit to quarrel? Come and hear and I will answer all these questions. It is stated, <italic>Thou shalt not covet:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn658">8</xref></sup> even [by saying,] &#x2018;Would that I had So-and-so&#x2019;s money&#x0021;&#x2019; To say, &#x2018;Would that I had So-and-so&#x2019;s money&#x0021;&#x2019; is [the conduct of] a thief or a robber. But [as for the remark], &#x2018;Would that I had as much money as So-and-so&#x0021;&#x2019; why should this be definitely forbidden? He only expresses a wish for himself&#x0021; But [to say], &#x2018;Would that So-and-so gave me his money&#x0021;&#x2019; constitutes an act of coveting. &#x2018;Would that I had a wife like the wife of So-and-so&#x0021;&#x2019;&#x2014;[by saying this he indicates that] he has already impure thoughts concerning her; but to say &#x2018;Would that the daughter of So-and-so would marry me&#x0021;&#x2019; is certainly permissible. Is not this self-evident? It is necessary [to state this because] he may say to her, &#x2018;Be betrothed to me&#x2019; and she may refuse. &#x2018;May one sleep in one bed with his wife who is <italic>niddah?</italic>&#x2019; [It is stated,] <italic>And thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is impure by her uncleanness</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn659">9</xref></sup> He is allowed, however, to eat with her. Whoever approaches his wife<sup><xref rid="fn660">10</xref></sup> while she is asleep is as if he approached a ship which is about to be wrecked in the sea.<sup><xref rid="fn661">11</xref></sup> Here it is written, <italic>And thou shalt not approach</italic>, and there it is written, <italic>So the shipmaster came to him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn662">12</xref></sup> Some say that he is obliged to bring a sin-offering, as it is written, <italic>The soul that sinneth, it shall die</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn663">13</xref></sup> Some say: It is as if he offered sacrifices to the Golden Calf.<sup><xref rid="fn664">14</xref></sup> &#x2018;May one quarrel with a man with whom it is not fit to quarrel?&#x2019; It is written, <italic>And I contended with them, and cursed them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn665">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have learnt there:<sup><xref rid="fn666">16</xref></sup> Whoever speculates upon four things, it were better<sup><xref rid="fn667">17</xref></sup> for him had he not come into the world, viz.: What is above, what is beneath, what is before, what is after.<sup><xref rid="fn668">18</xref></sup> This may be compared with the statement, &#x2018;Not only does he pride himself over his fellow-creatures but also over his Creator&#x2019;. If being of unclean limbs he rebels against his Creator, how much more so if a perfumed odour filled him&#x0021; This is what the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Hiram, king of Tyre,<sup><xref rid="fn669">19</xref></sup> &#x2018;[At the Creation] I looked upon you [observing your future arrogance] and created the excretory organs of man&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn670">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The question was asked: May one pride himself over the agents<sup><xref rid="fn671">21</xref></sup> who do unworthy deeds by not responding to them or speaking to them? Come and hear: [It is stated,] <italic>Whoso is haughty of eye and proud of heart, him will I not suffer</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn672">22</xref></sup> One should respond to them with lax lips but not with levity.</p>
<p>&#x2018;When R. Eliezer was dying&#x2019;, etc. As it is written, <italic>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the Lord</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn673">23</xref></sup> Although you have been told, &#x2018;Love your neighbour&#x2019;, when you stand before your Master set aside your honour.<sup><xref rid="fn674">24</xref></sup> The question was asked: When one is greeted while engaged in reciting the <italic>Tefillah</italic>, is it permissible to return the salutation? Even the salutation of a king it is forbidden to return,<sup><xref rid="fn675">25</xref></sup> but in the case of the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic> he returns the salutation when [the king] comes early to his door.<sup><xref rid="fn676">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x2018;Five things&#x2019;, etc.: &#x2018;A round cushion&#x2019;. Why?<sup><xref rid="fn677">27</xref></sup> For it is written, <italic>Woe to the women that sew cushions upon all elbows, and make pads for the head of persons of every stature to hunt souls&#x0021;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn678">28</xref></sup> Here <italic>cushions</italic> are compared with <italic>pads</italic> [<italic>mispa&#x1E25;oth</italic>]: just as a &#x2018;scab&#x2019; [<italic>sapa&#x1E25;ath</italic>] is clean, as it is written, <italic>Then the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is a scab</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn679">29</xref></sup> so too is a cushion clean.<sup><xref rid="fn680">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Rabbis taught:<sup><xref rid="fn681">31</xref></sup> When R. Eliezer fell sick, all the wise men of Israel came to visit him. That day was the Sabbath-eve and he was wearing his <italic>tefillin</italic>. His son entered to remove them from him,<sup><xref rid="fn682">32</xref></sup> but he rebuked him and drove him away in anger. [The son] said to the wise men, &#x2018;I believe that my father&#x2019;s mind is deranged&#x2019;. Whereupon [R. Eliezer] exclaimed, &#x2018;His mind and that of his mother are deranged but my mind is not&#x2019;. As he was dying, he put two of his fingers together and said, &#x2018;Woe to me because of these two Scrolls of the Torah&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn683">33</xref></sup> Much Torah have I learnt and much Torah have I taught,<sup><xref rid="fn684">34</xref></sup> yet I extracted little from the knowledge of my teachers like a dog lapping from the sea. My disciples have only extracted little from me like a painting-stick from its tube. If all the trees were made into pens and all the seas into ink, they would not suffice to write down all that I expounded. Moreover, I have studied three hundred laws on the subject of a deep bright spot<sup><xref rid="fn685">35</xref></sup> and three hundred established laws<sup><xref rid="fn686">36</xref></sup> derived from the verse, <italic>Thou shalt not suffer a sorceress to live</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn687">37</xref></sup> and no man, excepting &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba b. Joseph, ever questioned me thereon&#x2019; [54<italic>a</italic>].</p>
<p>The master said, &#x2018;Like a dog lapping from the sea&#x2019;&#x2014;he compared himself to a dog&#x0021; He said it with reference to his disciples. And why to his disciples? Because they did not visit him during his illness; and it has been taught: He said concerning them, &#x2018;I will be surprised if they die a natural death&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn688">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Rabbis taught: When a Sage dies, all the people have the duty to mourn for him, as it is written, <italic>Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn689">39</xref></sup> and it is also written, <italic>And Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn690">40</xref></sup> Since it states <italic>all Israel</italic>, it is self-evident that they <italic>gathered themselves together&#x0021;</italic> First they mourned for him in the cities and people said, &#x2018;Is this [sufficient] honour for Samuel who journeyed from city to city and from province to province to teach us Torah?&#x2019;, something which no other prophet had done; as it is said, <italic>And he went from year to year in circuit to Beth-el and Gilgal and Mi&#x1E93;pah; and he judged Israel in all those places. And his return was to Ramah, for there was his house; and there he judged Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn691">41</xref></sup> Raba said: Greater was their preoccupation [with mourning] in the case of Samuel than in that of Moses. Of Moses it is written, <italic>And the children of Israel wept for Moses</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn692">42</xref></sup> but here it is written, <italic>And all Israel &#x2026; lamented him</italic>&#x2014;even the women, slaves and minors.</p>
<p>We have learnt there:<sup><xref rid="fn693">43</xref></sup> The assembling of the righteous benefits themselves and the world; the scattering of the righteous harms them and the world. The assembling of the wicked harms themselves and the world; the scattering of the wicked benefits them and the world.<sup><xref rid="fn694">44</xref></sup> When the wicked are uprooted from the world, good comes to the world, as it is stated, <italic>And when the wicked perish, there is joy</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn695">45</xref></sup> When the righteous depart from the world, evil comes to the world, as it is stated, <italic>The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn696">46</xref></sup> Raba said: Do not say that [this refers only] to the men of his generation who knew him but to the whole world; for it is written. <italic>And no man layeth it to heart</italic>, and it is written there, <italic>The whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to heart</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn697">47</xref></sup> Raba also said: The righteous depart from this world for the sin of neglecting [the study of] the Torah, as it is written, <italic>And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn698">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Rabbis taught:<sup><xref rid="fn699">49</xref></sup> What reason did the righteous Isaiah see for saying, <italic>The righteous perisheth?</italic> It means to say that the righteous man is made responsible<sup><xref rid="fn700">50</xref></sup> for the sins of his generation; as R. Gorion said: When there are righteous in a generation, they are made responsible for the sins of their generation; when there are no righteous in a generation the schoolchildren are made responsible for the generation. The master said: &#x2018;The righteous man is made responsible for the sins of his generation&#x2019;. He abandoned the [plain] interpretation of the verse and gave it his own interpretation&#x0021; This is what he meant: People say that [the righteous man] was punished for his own sins, because although he perishes <italic>no man layeth it to heart;</italic> nevertheless he returned and contradicted<sup><xref rid="fn701">51</xref></sup> them through the Holy Spirit, as it is stated, <italic>The righteous is taken away from the evil to come</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn702">52</xref></sup> [<italic>Taken away:</italic>] this refers to Aaron, as it is written, <italic>As Aaron thy brother was taken away</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn703">53</xref></sup> What <italic>evil</italic> was there? <italic>And the Canaanite, the king of Arad &#x2026; heard</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn704">54</xref></sup> <italic>And godly men are taken away:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn705">55</xref></sup> this refers to Samuel and the elders of his generation who were associated with him. <italic>None considering:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn706">56</xref></sup> this refers to Saul and Abner, as it is stated, <italic>And no man saw it</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn707">57</xref></sup> <italic>nor knew it, neither did any awake; for they were all asleep</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn708">58</xref></sup> After this verse<sup><xref rid="fn709">59</xref></sup> it is written, <italic>They rest in their beds, each one that walketh in his uprightness</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn710">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>Raba said: The story is told of a general against whom the people under his authority<sup><xref rid="fn711">61</xref></sup> rebelled. Among them were some of his friends; so what did he do? He took them one by one and hid them. Next day he sat in judgment and said, &#x2018;Bring before me the people of the province&#x2019;. He sentenced some to imprisonment, some to be killed, some to be lashed and some to be hanged.<sup><xref rid="fn712">62</xref></sup> So, too, is it with the Holy One, blessed be He. When He sees the sins of the generation are grievous upon them, He removes the righteous and after that [commands], <italic>But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the harlot</italic><sup><xref rid="fn713">63</xref></sup>&#x2014;that is, those of them who are sorcerers and adulterers&#x2014;and then He gives a respite to that generation. The Rabbis taught:<sup><xref rid="fn714">64</xref></sup> Isaiah was punished for three things: because he called [Israel] <italic>a seed of evil-doers</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn715">65</xref></sup> <italic>sons of the sorceress</italic> and <italic>the seed of the adulterer;</italic> as it is stated, <italic>But draw near hither ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the harlot</italic>. And whence do we know that he was forgiven? As it is stated, <italic>And he touched my mouth with it, and he said: Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin is expiated</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn716">66</xref></sup></p>

<title>CHAPTER VII</title>
<p><small>BARAITHA</small>. Always be dignified on entering and leaving. Be submissive to the members of your household; engage but little in worldly affairs and occupy yourself with the study of the Torah. It is reported<sup><xref rid="fn717">1</xref></sup> of R. Simeon b. Eleazar that once, on returning from the house of his teacher in Migdal Gedor,<sup><xref rid="fn718">2</xref></sup> he was riding on an ass along the sea-shore when he met an ugly man. He said to him, &#x2018;How ugly you are&#x0021; May be all your fellow-citizens are as ugly as you are&#x2019;. Whereupon the man replied, &#x2018;Go [and tell this] to the Craftsman Who made me&#x2019;. When R. Simeon realized that he had done wrong, he alighted from the ass and prostrated himself before him saying, &#x2018;I beg your pardon, forgive me&#x2019;. &#x2018;By the Temple Service,&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn719">3</xref></sup> the man replied, &#x2018;I will not forgive you until you go and tell the Craftsman Who made me, &#x201C;How ugly is the vessel which You have made&#x0021;&#x201D; &#x2019; R. Simeon followed him for three <italic>mil;</italic> his fellow-townsmen met him, having gone out to meet him, and exclaimed, &#x2018;Peace be upon you, master&#x2019;. The man turned back to them and asked, &#x2018;Who is he [whom you call] Rabbi?&#x2019; They replied, &#x2018;He who is following behind you&#x2019;. Whereupon he remarked, &#x2018;If he is a Rabbi, may there be no more like him in Israel&#x2019;. His disciples by whom he was beloved rebuked the man and asked him, &#x2018;What has he done to you?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;Thus has he done to me&#x2019;. They said to him, &#x2018;Nevertheless forgive him&#x2019;.</p>
<p>Be tender like the reed and do not be hard like the cedar. When the four winds of heaven blow, the reed bends with them, and when they subside, the reed remains standing in its place. Therefore the reed merited that of it the pen should be made wherewith to write the words of the Torah. Not so the cedar: when the south [or] north wind blows, it overturns and uproots it. And what is the end of the cedar? Woodcutters come and shape it and tile houses with it, and its cuttings they burn in the fire.</p>
<p>In which way should one honour his teacher? When the two of them walk together in the road, he should place himself on [the teacher&#x2019;s] right hand and not on his left. If there be three, the Sage should be in the middle, the older man on his right and the younger on his left. For so we find it with the three Ministering Angels, Gabriel, Michael and Raphael, who came to our father Abraham. Gabriel was in the middle, Michael on his right and Raphael on his left. When they came to Abraham, the Divine Presence also came and stood above his head. He said to them, &#x2018;Sirs, wait until I have taken leave of the Divine Presence, Who is greater than you&#x2019;, as it is stated, <italic>And He left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn720">4</xref></sup> As soon as Abraham had taken leave of the Divine Presence, he came and bowed to them, as it is stated, <italic>And when he saw them, he ran to meet them &#x2026; and bowed down to the earth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn721">5</xref></sup> He led them beneath the tree and said to them, &#x2018;Sirs, <italic>let now a little water be fetched, and wash your feet, and recline yourselves under the tree</italic>&#x2019;,<sup><xref rid="fn722">6</xref></sup> and then, <italic>I will fetch a morsel of bread and stay ye your heart</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn723">7</xref></sup> But what did Lot say to them? <italic>Tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your way</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn724">8</xref></sup> Others say: Lot surely spoke with the wisdom of the wise. If [the men of Sodom] see them with their face, hands and feet washed they would kill him and his children;<sup><xref rid="fn725">9</xref></sup> but if they see the dust on their feet [they would conclude] that they had only just arrived from their journey.</p>
<p>It is related of the four elders, Rabban Gamaliel, R. Joshua, R. Eleazar b. Azariah and R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba, that they once journeyed to a kingdom in the interior where they had<sup><xref rid="fn726">10</xref></sup> a friend who was a philosopher. R. Joshua said to Rabban Gamaliel, &#x2018;I will go and pay my respects to our friend, the philosopher&#x2019;. He replied, &#x2018;No&#x2019;. He again said, &#x2018;I will go and pay my respects to our friend, the philosopher&#x2019;. He replied, &#x2018;Go in peace&#x2019;. In the morning at cock-crow they went and stood at the door of the philosopher&#x2019;s house. As Rabban Gamaliel was knocking at the door, the philosopher was thinking to himself and saying, &#x2018;This<sup><xref rid="fn727">11</xref></sup> can only be the good manners of wise men&#x2019;. He knocked a second time, and the philosopher rose up, washed his hands and feet. [Rabban Gamaliel knocked] a third time, and the philosopher saw the wise men of Israel had come some from one side and some from the other, with Rabban Gamaliel in the middle, R. Eleazar b. Azariah on his right and R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba on his left. The philosopher debated with himself, &#x2018;How shall I greet the wise men of Israel? If I say, &#x201C;Peace be upon you Rabban Gamaliel&#x201D; I will offend the wise men of Israel. If I say, &#x201C;Peace be upon you, O wise men of Israel&#x201D; I will offend Rabban Gamaliel&#x2019;. When he approached them he exclaimed, &#x2018;Peace be upon you, headed by Rabban Gamaliel&#x2019;. [This rule of good manners we learn] not from Rabban Gamaliel but from the Almighty; as it is stated, <italic>I saw the Lord sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right hand and on His left</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn728">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>One who accompanies his teacher may not depart from him until he has withdrawn backwards a little and asked his permission. If they are two scholars of equal status, the host enters [the house] first and the guest after him. And when they leave, the guest goes out first and the host after him. One who takes leave of his teacher, whether he be his senior or not, should say, &#x2018;I [ask permission] to take my leave&#x2019;.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. &#x2018;Always be dignified&#x2019;, etc. R. Samuel b. Na&#x1E25;mani said:<sup><xref rid="fn729">13</xref></sup> What is the meaning of the verse, <italic>For the Lord will smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn730">14</xref></sup> Better is the curse wherewith A&#x1E25;ijah the Shilonite cursed Israel than the blessing wherewith the wicked Balaam blessed them. A&#x1E25;ijah the Shilonite cursed Israel with a <italic>reed</italic>, as it is written, <italic>For the Lord will smite Israel as a reed is shaken in the water</italic>. But Balaam blessed them with the <italic>cedar</italic>, as it is written, <italic>As cedars beside the waters</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn731">15</xref></sup> Therefore &#x2018;be tender like the reed and do not be hard like the cedar &#x2026; therefore the reed merited&#x2019;, etc.</p>
<p>Why did dogs merit that of their excrement sacred books and <italic>tefillin</italic> should be made?<sup><xref rid="fn732">16</xref></sup> Because it stated, <italic>But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog whet his tongue</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn733">17</xref></sup> Similarly you may ask, Wherein lay the merit of the <italic>ha&#x1E25;iroth?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn734">18</xref></sup> They were harlots and when they caught sight of Israel they turned their faces backward and are therefore called <italic>&#x1E25;eruth</italic>.</p>
<p>&#x2018;In which way should one honour his teacher&#x2019;, etc.? It has been taught:<sup><xref rid="fn735">19</xref></sup> Michael came to bring good tidings to Sarah,<sup><xref rid="fn736">20</xref></sup> Gabriel to overthrow Sodom, and Raphael to heal Abraham.<sup><xref rid="fn737">21</xref></sup> Some say that Raphael came to bring good tidings to Sarah and to heal,<sup><xref rid="fn738">22</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>And God healed Abimelech</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn739">23</xref></sup> Michael and Gabriel to overthrow Sodom. What is the reason for the first view? [Because it is stated,] <italic>And He overthrew those cities</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn740">24</xref></sup> And what is the reason for the opinion of the others? [Because it is stated,] <italic>And the two angels came to Sodom</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn741">25</xref></sup> Why is it that with Abraham [the angels said], <italic>So do, as thou hast said</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn742">26</xref></sup> but with Lot, <italic>Nay; but we will abide in the broad place all night?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn743">27</xref></sup> R. Eleazar said: Infer from this that one may display reluctance<sup><xref rid="fn744">28</xref></sup> towards an inferior but not a superior. The Rabbis taught:<sup><xref rid="fn745">29</xref></sup> In the time to come the son of David will be in the middle, Adam, Seth and Methuselah on his right, and Abraham, Jacob and Moses on his left. Why is Isaac omitted? Raba said: Isaac is better than they because to him all Israel declare, <italic>For thou art our Father</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn746">30</xref></sup> If so, Esau ascended into Paradise.<sup><xref rid="fn747">31</xref></sup> That is why Scripture states, <italic>For thou art our Father:</italic> children are like their father&#x2014;as the father did not repudiate the covenant so too the children. And whence do we know this? It is stated, <italic>I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee; surely thou hast hated thine own blood, therefore blood shall pursue thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn748">32</xref></sup> Did Esau hate blood? Were not all his deeds connected with the shedding of blood, as it is stated, <italic>He is like a lion that is eager to tear in pieces, and like a young lion lurking in secret places?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn749">33</xref></sup> Whence do you infer this? Perhaps he was only out to rob? No, since it states <italic>dimyeno</italic> and not <italic>dimyono;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn750">34</xref></sup> so draw this conclusion.</p>

<p label="1."><sup><xref rid="fn751">1</xref></sup><small>BARAITHA</small>. R. Meir said: Whoever occupies himself with the Torah for its own sake merits many things; nay more, the whole world is beholden to him. He is called friend,<sup><xref rid="fn752">2</xref></sup> beloved,<sup><xref rid="fn753">3</xref></sup> a lover of the All-present and a lover of his fellow-creatures, one who gladdens<sup><xref rid="fn754">4</xref></sup> the All-present and his fellow-creatures. It clothes him<sup><xref rid="fn755">5</xref></sup> with meekness and reverence [of God]; it fits him to be righteous, pious, upright and faithful; it keeps him far from sin and brings him near to merit. From him men enjoy counsel, sound knowledge, understanding and strength; as it is stated, <italic>Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom; I am understanding, power is mine</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn756">6</xref></sup> It gives him sovereignty,<sup><xref rid="fn757">7</xref></sup> dominion,<sup><xref rid="fn758">8</xref></sup> greatness and [the ability to be] searching in judgment, and to him are revealed the secret [meanings] of the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn759">9</xref></sup> He becomes like a well that never fails and like a stream which gathers strength as it flows on. He is modest, patient and forgiving of insults directed at him It makes him great and exalts him above all things.</p>
<p label="2.">R. Joshua b. Levi said: Every day a <italic>Bath &#x1E32;ol</italic><sup><xref rid="fn760">10</xref></sup> goes forth from Mount &#x1E24;oreb<sup><xref rid="fn761">11</xref></sup> and proclaims, &#x2018;Woe to mankind for the contempt which they display<sup><xref rid="fn762">12</xref></sup> towards the Torah&#x0021; For whoever is not constant in his study of the Torah is termed &#x2018;censured&#x2019;,<sup><xref rid="fn763">13</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>As a ring of gold in a swine&#x2019;s snout, so is a fair woman that turneth aside from discretion</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn764">14</xref></sup> and it states, <italic>And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn765">15</xref></sup> Do not read<sup><xref rid="fn766">16</xref></sup> <italic>&#x1E25;aruth</italic> [engraven] but <italic>&#x1E25;eruth</italic> [freedom], for no man is free but he who occupies himself with the Torah; and whoever studies the lore of the Torah is exalted, as it is stated, <italic>And from Mattanah to Na&#x1E25;aliel; and from Na&#x1E25;aliel to Bamoth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn767">17</xref></sup></p>
<p label="3.">Whoever learns from his fellow a single chapter, a single rule, even a single verse or even a single small letter<sup><xref rid="fn768">18</xref></sup> must treat him with honour; for so we find with David, king of Israel, who learnt from Ahitophel only two things,<sup><xref rid="fn769">19</xref></sup> yet he treated him as his teacher and guide, as it is stated, <italic>But it was thou, a man mine equal, my companion, and my familiar friend</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn770">20</xref></sup> Now is there not an argument from minor to major? If David, king of Israel, who learnt from Ahitophel only two things called him his teacher and guide, how much more so must one who learns from his fellow-man a chapter, a rule, a verse, a word or even one letter treat him with honour&#x0021; And &#x2018;honour&#x2019; means nothing but Torah, as it is stated, <italic>The wise shall inherit honour;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn771">21</xref></sup> [it is also stated,] <italic>The whole-hearted shall inherit good</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn772">22</xref></sup> and <italic>good</italic> is nothing else than Torah, as it is stated <italic>For I give you good doctrine; forsake ye not my teaching</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn773">23</xref></sup></p>
<p label="4.">This is the way [conducive to] the study of the Torah: a morsel of bread with salt thou shalt eat,<sup><xref rid="fn774">24</xref></sup> and water by measure<sup><xref rid="fn775">25</xref></sup> shalt thou drink, thou must sleep on the ground and live a life of hardship<sup><xref rid="fn776">26</xref></sup> and [yet] labour in the Torah. [If you act in this manner,] <italic>Happy shalt thou be and it shall be well with thee:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn777">27</xref></sup> <italic>happy shalt thou be</italic> in this world, <italic>and it shall be well with thee</italic> in the World to Come.</p>
<p label="5.">Seek not greatness and covet not honour Not learning, but doing is the more important.<sup><xref rid="fn778">28</xref></sup> and do not crave for the table of kings, for your table is greater than their table and your crown than their crown.<sup><xref rid="fn779">29</xref></sup> Faithful is your Employer to pay you the reward for your labour.</p>
<p label="6.">The Torah is greater than the priesthood and kingship, inasmuch as kingship [is acquired] in the form of thirty distinctions, the priesthood in [the form of] twenty-four, but the Torah in [the form of] forty-eight, viz.: by sedateness, [knowledge of] Scripture, good manners, moderation in sleep, moderation in conversation, moderation in business, moderation in hilarity, moderation in pleasure, moderation in intercourse with the world, patience, goodness of heart, confidence in the wise, resignation under affliction, study, the faculty of hearing,<sup><xref rid="fn780">30</xref></sup> ordered presentation [of one&#x2019;s subject-matter] with one&#x2019;s lips,<sup><xref rid="fn781">31</xref></sup> understanding and discernment of heart,<sup><xref rid="fn782">32</xref></sup> rising [out of respect],<sup><xref rid="fn783">33</xref></sup> reverence, wisdom, meekness, attendance upon scholars, painstaking examination<sup><xref rid="fn784">34</xref></sup> [of a subject] together with colleagues, keen discussion with pupils, knowing one&#x2019;s place, rejoicing in one&#x2019;s portion, making a fence to one&#x2019;s words,<sup><xref rid="fn785">35</xref></sup> claiming no credit for oneself, loving the All-present, loving reproof, loving just courses, loving rectitude, keeping oneself far from [worldly] honour and not pursuing [worldly] honour, not priding oneself on one&#x2019;s learning, not taking delight in giving decisions, bearing the yoke with one&#x2019;s fellow-man, judging him in the scale of merit, guiding him to truth and peace, being deliberate in one&#x2019;s study, asking questions and answering them, hearing and adding [to what he has heard], making one&#x2019;s teacher wiser, concentrating upon one&#x2019;s discourse, and repeating a statement in the name of him who made it. Hence you learn that whoever repeats a statement in the name of him who made it brings redemption into the world, as it is stated, <italic>And Esther told the king thereof in Mordecai&#x2019;s name</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn786">36</xref></sup></p>
<p label="7.">Great is the Torah for it gives life to those who keep it, both in this world and in the World to Come, as it is stated, <italic>For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn787">37</xref></sup> and it states, <italic>It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn788">38</xref></sup> [and it states,] <italic>Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn789">39</xref></sup> and it states, <italic>She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her, and happy is every one that holdeth her fast;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn790">40</xref></sup> and it states, <italic>She will give to thy head a chaplet of grace; a crown of glory will she bestow on thee;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn791">41</xref></sup> and it states, <italic>For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head, and a necklace about thy neck;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn792">42</xref></sup> and it states, <italic>Length of days is in her right hand; in her left are riches and honour;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn793">43</xref></sup> and it states, <italic>For length of days, and years of life, and peace, will they add to thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn794">44</xref></sup></p>
<p label="8.">R. Simeon b. Judah said in the name of R. Simeon [b. Yo&#x1E25;ai]: Beauty, strength, riches, wisdom, old age, hoariness, honour and children are becoming to the righteous and becoming to the world; as it is stated, <italic>The hoary head is a crown of glory, it is found in the way of righteousness;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn795">45</xref></sup> and it states, <italic>Children&#x2019;s children are the crown of old men; and the glory of the children are their fathers;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn796">46</xref></sup> and it states, <italic>The glory of young men is their strength; and the beauty of old men is the hoary head;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn797">47</xref></sup> and it states, <italic>And before His elders shall be glory</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn798">48</xref></sup> R. Simeon b. Menasia said: The seven qualifications which the Sages associated with the righteous were all realized in Rabbi [Judah the Prince] and his sons.</p>
<p label="9."><sup><xref rid="fn799">49</xref></sup> [R. Jose b. &#x1E32;isma said: Once I went on a journey when a man met me and greeted me.<sup><xref rid="fn800">50</xref></sup> He asked me, &#x2018;Rabbi, from which place do you come?&#x2019; I replied, &#x2018;From a great city of scholars and scribes&#x2019;. He said to me, &#x2018;Rabbi, if you agreed to dwell with us in our place, I would give you a thousand thousand golden <italic>dinars</italic> and precious stones and pearls&#x2019;. I replied, &#x2018;My son, were you to give me all the silver and gold and precious stones and pearls in the world, I would not dwell in any place but in a place of Torah. Because in the hour of a man&#x2019;s departure [from the world], neither silver nor gold nor precious stones and pearls accompany him but only Torah and good deeds; as it is stated, <italic>When thou walkest, it shall lead thee, when thou liest down, it shall watch over thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn801">51</xref></sup> <italic>When thou walkest, it shall lead thee</italic>&#x2014;in this world; <italic>when thou liest down, it shall watch over thee</italic>&#x2014;in the grave; <italic>and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee</italic>&#x2014;in the World to Come. And so it is written in the Book of Psalms of David, king of Israel, <italic>The law of Thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn802">52</xref></sup> and it states, <italic>Mine is the silver, and Mine is the gold, saith the Lord of hosts</italic>.]<sup><xref rid="fn803">53</xref></sup></p>
<p label="10.">Five acquisitions has the Holy One, blessed be He, made His very own<sup><xref rid="fn804">54</xref></sup> in this world, viz.: Torah, heaven and earth, Abraham, Israel and the Temple. Whence do we know this of the Torah? As it is stated, <italic>The Lord made me as the beginning of His way</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn805">55</xref></sup> Whence do we know this of heaven and earth? As it is stated, <italic>The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn806">56</xref></sup> Whence do we know this of Abraham? As it is stated, <italic>Blessed be Abram of God Most High, Maker of heaven and earth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn807">57</xref></sup> Whence do we know this of Israel? As it is stated, <italic>Till Thy people pass over, O Lord, till the people pass over that Thou hast gotten</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn808">58</xref></sup> and it states, <italic>As for the holy that are in the earth, they are the excellent in whom is all My delight</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn809">59</xref></sup> And whence do we know this of the Temple? As it is stated, <italic>The sanctuary, O Lord, which Thy hands have established;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn810">60</xref></sup> and it states, <italic>And He brought them to His holy border, to the mountain which His right hand had gotten</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn811">61</xref></sup> All of them the Holy One, blessed be He, created only for His honour, as it is stated, <italic>Every one that is called by My name, and whom I have created for My glory, I have formed him, yea, I have made him;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn812">62</xref></sup> and it states, <italic>The Lord shall reign for ever and ever</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn813">63</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. &#x2018;R. Meir said&#x2019;: The Rabbis have taught:<sup><xref rid="fn814">64</xref></sup> R. Meir once went to a certain place where an old man asked him, &#x2018;Why is it written, <italic>It is a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the Lord</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn815">65</xref></sup> [and elsewhere it is written, <italic>An offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the Lord</italic>]?&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn816">66</xref></sup> He was not in possession [of the answer], so he went to the <italic>Beth Hammidrash</italic> and inquired. They told him, &#x2018;The one passage refers to those who occupy themselves with the study of the Torah for its own sake, and the other to those who occupy themselves not for its own sake&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn817">67</xref></sup> As for R. Meir who taught: &#x2018;Whoever occupies himself with the Torah for its own sake&#x2019;, etc.,<sup><xref rid="fn818">68</xref></sup> was he not in possession of what R. Jo&#x1E25;anan<sup><xref rid="fn819">69</xref></sup> said: [It is written,] <italic>And the Lord saith: Because they have forsaken My law which I set before them</italic>, etc.<sup><xref rid="fn820">70</xref></sup>: The Holy One, blessed be He, said [54<italic>b</italic>], &#x2018;I have exiled Israel not because of idolatry, immorality and murder, but because they forsook My law; as it is stated, <italic>And have forsaken Me, and have not kept My law</italic><sup><xref rid="fn821">71</xref></sup>&#x2014;if they forsook Me why did they not keep My law?&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn822">72</xref></sup> Hence the Sages declared:<sup><xref rid="fn823">73</xref></sup> Let a man ever occupy himself with the Torah even not for its own sake; because from doing it not for its own sake, he will come to do it for its own sake.</p>
<p>[R. Meir] made his statement on the principle of R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba, for it has been taught: R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: Whoever reads [the Torah] not for its own sake, it were better for him that he had died at birth;<sup><xref rid="fn824">74</xref></sup> for it is stated, <italic>And ye shall keep My commandments, and do them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn825">75</xref></sup> But whoever reads [the Torah] for its own sake, Scripture accounts it to him as though he had fulfilled [the precepts], as it is stated, <italic>And do them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn826">76</xref></sup> The following was quoted in refutation of R. Jo&#x1E25;anan&#x2019;s statement: What was the cause of the first destruction of Jerusalem? Idolatry. And of the second destruction? Causeless hatred;<sup><xref rid="fn827">77</xref></sup> so were there not two causes?<sup><xref rid="fn828">78</xref></sup> R. Jo&#x1E25;anan can reply: It is the Holy One, blessed be He, Who spoke thus: <italic>They have forsaken Me</italic>. Why? Because <italic>they have not kept My law;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn829">79</xref></sup> consequently if they had kept My law they would not have forsaken Me. And as to your question on [the destruction of] the Second Temple, causeless hatred is different because it is more grievous than idolatry.<sup><xref rid="fn830">80</xref></sup> Whence do we know this? For it is written, <italic>Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn831">81</xref></sup> As long as they are joined together even [to worship] their idols, <italic>leave them alone;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn832">82</xref></sup> [and it is written,] <italic>Their heart is divided; now shall they bear their guilt</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn833">83</xref></sup> If so, what [was the cause of] the first destruction? With the First Temple it was different; He deferred the punishment from the days of Rehoboam. Or if you wish I can say that the First Temple was also destroyed for the reason <italic>their heart is divided</italic>.</p>
<p>The Rabbis have taught:<sup><xref rid="fn834">84</xref></sup> Whoever hates another is as though he were his murderer, as it is stated, <italic>But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die</italic><sup><xref rid="fn835">85</xref></sup>&#x2014;were it in his power he would kill him,</p>
<p>&#x2018;He is called friend&#x2019; of the Divine Presence,<sup><xref rid="fn836">86</xref></sup> as it is written. <italic>For my brethren and companions&#x2019; sakes, I will now say: Peace be within thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn837">87</xref></sup> &#x2018;Beloved&#x2019;, as it is written, <italic>I love them that love me, and those that seek me earnestly shall find me</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn838">88</xref></sup> &#x2018;One who gladdens the All-present and his fellow-creatures&#x2019;: This teaches that a man should appear justified before his fellow-creatures as well as before the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is written, <italic>Then ye shall be clear before the Lord, and before Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn839">89</xref></sup> &#x2018;Gladden the All-present&#x2019;: as it is written, <italic>Behold, this is the joy of his way</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn840">90</xref></sup> [&#x2018;Gladden] his fellow-creatures&#x2019;: as it is written, <italic>Israel, in whom I will be glorified</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn841">91</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x2018;It clothes him with meekness&#x2019;: Who taught this? R. Joshua b. Levi who said:<sup><xref rid="fn842">92</xref></sup> Meekness is the greatest of them all. Since the last part reads &#x2018;R. Joshua b. Levi said&#x2019;, it must be deduced that the first part is not by R. Joshua b. Levi&#x0021; Something is missing in the Baraitha and read it as follows: &#x2018;[Meekness is] the greatest of them all, <italic>and further</italic> said R. Joshua b. Levi&#x2019;. But perhaps the author of the statement is R. Meir? We do not find anywhere that R. Meir said, &#x2018;Reverence is best&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn843">93</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x2018;It fits him to be righteous, pious&#x2019;, etc. What is meant by &#x2018;righteous&#x2019; and what by &#x2018;pious&#x2019;? &#x2018;Righteous&#x2019; is one who does right actions; &#x2018;pious&#x2019; is one who practises acts of loving-kindness. Since [the Baraitha] cites these [virtues], why does it mention &#x2018;upright [and faithful]&#x2019;? &#x2018;Upright&#x2019; means one who is upright in his ways, &#x2018;faithful&#x2019; denotes one who is faithful in spirit.</p>
<p>&#x2018;It keeps him far from sin&#x2019;: even from the sin of others. &#x2018;And brings him near to merit&#x2019;: even the merit of others. &#x2018;From him men enjoy sound knowledge&#x2019;: What is meant by <italic>tushiyyah?</italic> The Torah. And why is it called <italic>tushiyyah?</italic> Because it weakens the strength of a man<sup><xref rid="fn844">94</xref></sup> [through his constant study of it]. Another explanation: Because it was given in secret on account of Sa&#x1E6D;an.<sup><xref rid="fn845">95</xref></sup> Another explanation: Because it is composed of chaotic matter which is the foundation of the world.<sup><xref rid="fn846">96</xref></sup></p>
<p>Come and hear: [It is written,] <italic>He frustrated the devices of the crafty, so that their hands can perform nothing substantial</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn847">97</xref></sup> It is all right in this last-quoted verse where it is clear from what is written, <italic>so that their hands can perform nothing</italic>, that it refers to what they have begun to do; but on the basis of the first statement there is a difficulty&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn848">98</xref></sup> [It can be answered that] on the basis of the first statement there is also no difficulty, because anxiety<sup><xref rid="fn849">99</xref></sup> affects one&#x2019;s learning.<sup><xref rid="fn850">100</xref></sup> And as for him who interprets [<italic>tushiyyah</italic>] &#x2018;because it was given in secret on account of Sa&#x1E6D;an&#x2019;, there is a twofold difficulty: first, the word cannot bear such an interpretation, and secondly the verses [which are cited] afford no proof<sup><xref rid="fn851">101</xref></sup> for it&#x0021; The difficulty certainly [remains unsolved].</p>
<p>&#x2018;<italic>Counsel is Mine, and sound wisdom</italic>&#x2019;&#x2014;thus declared the princes of the Torah: <italic>Mine is counsel and sound wisdom</italic>, and [the Torah] responded, <italic>I am understanding</italic>. Or if you wish I can say that [the Torah] declared, &#x2018;Although [understanding] is not my relative,<sup><xref rid="fn852">102</xref></sup> counsellor or friend, yet <italic>counsel is Mine</italic> and was approved by Heaven; but as for the principles of understanding, although men may master them, no one can do so unless he takes his stand with me&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn853">103</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x2018;It gives him sovereignty &#x2026; and [the ability to be] searching in judgment&#x2019;&#x2014;that is, in civil cases. &#x2018;The secret [meanings of] the Torah&#x2019;&#x2014;[so that he is able to deduce] one thing from another.<sup><xref rid="fn854">104</xref></sup> &#x2018;Like a well that never fails&#x2019;&#x2014;once he has gained wisdom he does not cease [to add to it]. &#x2018;And like a stream which gathers strength as it flows on&#x2019;&#x2014;every day he discovers a new interpretation. &#x2018;Modest&#x2019;&#x2014;although you have become very wise and other men cannot acquire wisdom with the same rapidity, do not harshly judge them. &#x2018;Forgiving insults directed at him&#x2019;&#x2014;he does not pursue a quarrel. &#x2018;And it makes him great and exalts him.&#x2019;</p>
<p>&#x2018;R. Joshua b. Levi said: Every day&#x2019;, etc. Whence do we know this? For it is written, <italic>Hark&#x0021; the Lord crieth</italic> [<italic>yi&#x1E33;ra&#x2019;</italic>] <italic>unto the city&#x2014;and it is wisdom to have regard for Thy name</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn855">105</xref></sup> Perhaps the verse speaks of an ordinary voice [calling and not a <italic>Bath &#x1E32;ol</italic>]<italic>?</italic> Here it is stated <italic>yi&#x1E33;ra&#x2019;</italic>, and elsewhere it is stated, <italic>And the Lord called</italic> [<italic>wayyi&#x1E33;ra&#x2019;</italic>] <italic>unto him out of the mountain:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn856">106</xref></sup> as there it was [God calling] from Sinai, so here too it is [God calling] from Sinai.

<p>Our Rabbis have taught:<sup><xref rid="fn865">115</xref></sup> Five things the Holy One, blessed be He, Himself proclaims, viz.: the leader, famine, plenty, the sword, and those who escape the sword. &#x2018;The leader&#x2019;, as it is written, <italic>See, I have called by name Be&#x1E93;alel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn866">116</xref></sup> &#x2018;Famine&#x2019;, as it is written, <italic>For the Lord hath called for a famine</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn867">117</xref></sup> &#x2018;Plenty&#x2019;, as it is written, <italic>And I will call for the corn and will increase it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn868">118</xref></sup> &#x2018;The sword&#x2019;, as it is written, <italic>For I will call for a sword</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn869">119</xref></sup> &#x2018;Those who escape the sword&#x2019;, as it is written, <italic>And among the remnant those whom the Lord shall call</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn870">120</xref></sup> It is all right with three since the Divine Name is written in connection with them, but with <italic>And I will call for the corn</italic>, perhaps [this means] by a messenger, as it is written, <italic>I will call my servant Elia&#x1E33;im&#x0021;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn871">121</xref></sup> If you do not admit this, surely there [with Elia&#x1E33;im] the Divine Presence called to him [to act as leader], because it was similar to that of Be&#x1E93;alel who was a leader.</p>
<p>We have learnt:<sup><xref rid="fn872">122</xref></sup> Every day a proclamation goes forth [in heaven], &#x2018;The daughter of So-and-so is [to marry] So-and-so; the wife of So-and-so is [to marry] So-and-so; the money of So-and-so [will belong] to So-and-so&#x2019;. Some add. &#x2018;The house of So-and-so [will belong] to So-and-so&#x2019;. Whence do we know this? For it is written, <italic>Men of low degree are vanity; and men of high degree are a lie; if they be laid in the balances, they are together lighter than vanity</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn873">123</xref></sup> <italic>Men of low degree are vanity:</italic> this refers to one who says, &#x2018;The daughter of So-and-so [will marry] So-and-so&#x2019;; <italic>men of high degree are a lie:</italic> this refers to one who says, &#x2018;The wife of So-and-so [will marry] So-and-so&#x2019;; <italic>if they be laid in the balances:</italic> this refers to one who says, &#x2018;The money of So-and-so [will belong] to So-and-so&#x2019;. And what about the added statement? &#x2018;House&#x2019; is the same as &#x2018;money&#x2019;.</p>
<p>It was stated above, <italic>Men</italic> [<italic>&#x2019;adam</italic>] <italic>of low degree are vanity; and men</italic> [<italic>&#x2019;ish</italic>] <italic>of high degree are a lie</italic>.

Did not the world [after the Flood] begin with Noah who was not a liar, for it is written, <italic>Noah was in his generations a man righteous and whole-hearted?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn876">126</xref></sup> Even so, this does not help; we go back to the earliest origins.<sup><xref rid="fn877">127</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x2018;For whoever is not constant in the study of the Torah is termed &#x201C;censured&#x201D;; as it is stated, <italic>As a ring of gold in a swine&#x2019;s snout&#x2019;</italic>&#x2014;<italic>gold</italic> refers to the Torah, for so it states, <italic>And I put a ring upon thy nose;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn878">128</xref></sup> and it also declares, <italic>As a ring of gold in a swine&#x2019;s snout:</italic> this refers to one who studies the Torah at [irregular] intervals.<sup><xref rid="fn879">129</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, said, &#x2018;Of what [use] is this before swine, seeing that My Torah is beautiful and I have given it [to man] to meditate thereon, but he does not meditate on it until he forgets it&#x2019;.</p>
<p>&#x2018;And it states, <italic>And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables;</italic> and it is stated, <italic>And from Mattanah to Na&#x1E25;aliel; and from Na&#x1E25;aliel to Bamoth&#x2019;</italic>. What is [the force of] the additional verse? Should you say that although such a man is under &#x2018;censure&#x2019; he can still be considered a free man, come and hear: <italic>Graven upon the tables</italic>&#x2014;he only is free who meditates on the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn880">130</xref></sup> And it declares, <italic>From Mattanah to Na&#x1E25;aliel</italic>&#x2014;what is [the force of] this additional verse? Should you say: He is not a free man<sup><xref rid="fn881">131</xref></sup> but receives his reward, come and hear: <italic>And from Mattanah to Na&#x1E25;aliel</italic>&#x2014;this is to teach that the reward is [only] for those who make themselves in connection with [the Torah] like an overflowing brook.<sup><xref rid="fn882">132</xref></sup> You might perhaps derive this from the verse, <italic>As the channel of brooks that overflow&#x0021;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn883">133</xref></sup> Come and hear: <italic>And from Na&#x1E25;aliel to Bamoth</italic>&#x2014;they are like the high places [<italic>bamoth</italic>] which did not cease.<sup><xref rid="fn884">134</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x2018;Whoever learns from his fellow a single chapter.&#x2019; Since [the Baraitha] refers to &#x2018;a single small letter&#x2019;, what need was there to mention &#x2018;one word&#x2019;? And [since it refers] to &#x2018;one word&#x2019;, why mention &#x2018;a single rule&#x2019; or &#x2018;a single chapter&#x2019;? [The intention is] one letter of the Talmud, one word of the Mishnah, one verse of Scripture, one rule even though it has not been established, one chapter even of [the tractate] <italic>Derek &#x2019;Ere&#x1E93;</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn885">135</xref></sup> How [can one learn] &#x2018;a single letter&#x2019;? For example,<sup><xref rid="fn886">136</xref></sup> <italic>me&#x2019;amme&#x1E93;in</italic> or <italic>me&#x2018;amme&#x1E93;in; gar&#x2019;inin</italic> or <italic>gar&#x2018;inin;</italic> or <italic>&#x2019;ommemoth</italic> or <italic>&#x2018;ommemoth</italic>. And he<sup><xref rid="fn887">137</xref></sup> gave a reason [that the word should be spelt] <italic>gar &#x2018;inin</italic>, for it is written, <italic>And an abatement shall be made</italic> [<italic>wenigra&#x2018;</italic>] <italic>from thy valuation;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn888">138</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;ommemoth</italic>, for it is written, <italic>The cedars in the garden of God could not hide it;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn889">139</xref></sup> <italic>me&#x2018;amme&#x1E93;in</italic>, for it is written, <italic>And shutteth his eyes from looking upon evil</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn890">140</xref></sup> He did not, however, give his own opinion [whether these words should be written] with <italic>&#x2019;alef</italic> or <italic>&#x2018;ayin</italic>. But one [of the examples cited] is written with <italic>&#x2019;alef?</italic> They are surely written with <italic>&#x2019;ayin&#x0021;</italic> He speaks of words which enter the heart,<sup><xref rid="fn891">141</xref></sup> as for instance, <italic>massi&#x1E33;in, mezi&#x1E33;in</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn892">142</xref></sup> But is not this [a better] example&#x2014;for instance that which we have learnt:<sup><xref rid="fn893">143</xref></sup> One may let fruit drop [<italic>mashshilin</italic>] through a trap-door on a Festival? If [one uses the verb] <italic>mashshilin</italic> he does not make a mistake; for we have learnt:<sup><xref rid="fn894">144</xref></sup> [If the firstling is a] <italic>sha&#x1E25;ol</italic> or a <italic>kasol</italic>, [it may be slaughtered]; <italic>sha&#x1E25;ol</italic> [means an animal] whose hip has become dislocated and <italic>kasol</italic> [an animal] one of whose hips is higher than the other.<sup><xref rid="fn895">145</xref></sup> If one teaches the word <italic>mashshirin</italic><sup><xref rid="fn896">146</xref></sup> he does not make a mistake; for we have learnt:<sup><xref rid="fn897">147</xref></sup> If one&#x2019;s clothes fell [<italic>nashru</italic>] in the water on a Sabbath he may walk in them without fear. He who uses the word <italic>mashshirin</italic> does not make a mistake; for we have learnt:<sup><xref rid="fn898">148</xref></sup> The hair-clipper [<italic>sha&#x1E25;or</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn899">149</xref></sup> and the barber&#x2019;s scissors are susceptible to defilement even though [the two parts] are separated. But [we are speaking of the change] of one letter and here it [deals with the change of] one word&#x0021; It was only necessary as an opinion.<sup><xref rid="fn900">150</xref></sup></p>
<p>Raba said: Even with the <italic>waw</italic>, which is clearly one letter, you might argue that since it does not add anything to the meaning, conclude that one is not [obliged to honour him who teaches it]&#x0021; Hence [the Baraitha] teaches that, since at times with the help of it a reason [for a law] is established [it is to be taken into consideration],<sup><xref rid="fn901">151</xref></sup> and it only applies where the reason [for a law] is established by it. Raba said: [It also applies] in connection with Scripture, although the reason for a law may not be established by it and it may be a letter that is not pronounced. But you said &#x2018;a verse of Scripture&#x2019;&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn902">152</xref></sup> This was necessary for a case when he expounded it in connection with a <italic>halakah</italic>.</p>
<p>&#x2018;For so we find with David, king of Israel, who learnt from Ahitophel only two things.&#x2019; What were they? Raba said: Can you not learn them from the verse itself? [It is written,] <italic>We took sweet counsel together:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn903">153</xref></sup> [Ahitophel] said to him, &#x2018;David, why do you sit and occupy yourself alone with the study of the Torah? The words of the Torah can be preserved only in association with companions.<sup><xref rid="fn904">154</xref></sup> Just as <italic>counsel</italic> frustrates thoughts,<sup><xref rid="fn905">155</xref></sup> so [is thought frustrated] where there is no <italic>counsel</italic>&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn906">156</xref></sup> And whence did he illustrate it? For it is written, <italic>Keep silence</italic> [<italic>hasketh</italic>], <italic>and hear, O Israel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn907">157</xref></sup> [which means,] Divide yourselves into groups<sup><xref rid="fn908">158</xref></sup> [for the study of the Torah]. And what was the other thing [David] learnt [from him]? He said to him, &#x2018;When you go to pray, run like a man running after a king&#x2019;. And whence did he illustrate it? For it is written. <italic>After the Lord your God shall ye go</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn909">159</xref></sup> And whence do we know that David referred to these [two thoughts] and spoke in praise of them? For it is written, <italic>We took sweet counsel together, in the house of God we walked with the throng;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn910">160</xref></sup> and it is written, <italic>I have more understanding than all my teachers;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn911">161</xref></sup> and it is also written, <italic>I will run the way of Thy commandments</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn912">162</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x2018;This is the way [conducive to] the study of the Torah: a morsel of bread with salt thou shalt eat.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn913">163</xref></sup> [Rab] saw [R. Kahana] indulging himself<sup><xref rid="fn914">164</xref></sup> and asked him, &#x2018;Do you not know of the verse,<sup><xref rid="fn915">165</xref></sup> <italic>Neither is it found in the land of the living</italic><sup><xref rid="fn916">166</xref></sup> [which means that] the Torah will not be found in one who attends to his needs [instead of studying it constantly]?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;It refers to [abstention from pleasant things] which enter the body, but does it refer also to such matters?&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn917">167</xref></sup> [Rab] said to him, &#x2018;Has it not been taught:<sup><xref rid="fn918">168</xref></sup> Three things enter the body without its deriving any benefit therefrom, viz. melilot,<sup><xref rid="fn919">169</xref></sup> date-berries and unripe dates; three things do not enter the body but it derives benefit therefrom, viz. washing, anointing and regular motions?&#x2019; He asked him, &#x2018;Does, then, the study of the Torah entail affliction?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;Yes, for it is written, <italic>It is good for me that I have been afficted, in order that I might learn Thy statutes</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn920">170</xref></sup> Furthermore, is [Torah] found [in all others] except those [who attend to their wants]? But has it not been taught:<sup><xref rid="fn921">171</xref></sup> <italic>It is not in heaven</italic><sup><xref rid="fn922">172</xref></sup> [which means that] Torah will not be found with those who exalt their knowledge, <italic>Neither is it beyond the sea</italic> [which means that] it will not be found among merchants, traders and sailors. With these Torah is not found but craftiness is found. And whence do you know that <italic>beyond</italic> [<italic>&#x2018;eber</italic>] <italic>the sea</italic> refers to merchants? For it is written, <italic>And there passed by</italic> [<italic>wayya&#x2018;abru</italic>], <italic>Midianites, merchantmen</italic>&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn923">173</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x2018;Do not seek greatness for yourself&#x2019;: so that you should not say, &#x2018;Behold, I study the Torah and what a great man I am&#x0021;&#x2019; Should you do so, the consequence will be that you will occupy yourself with the Torah not for its own sake.</p>
<p>&#x2018;The Torah is greater than kingship, inasmuch as kingship [is acquired] in the form of thirty distinctions.&#x2019; What are they?<sup><xref rid="fn924">174</xref></sup> By silver, gold, women, menservants, maidservants, houses, vineyards, gardens, parks, family, treasures,<sup><xref rid="fn925">175</xref></sup> provinces, male singers, female singers, delicacies, demons and demonesses,<sup><xref rid="fn926">176</xref></sup> horses, chariots, the sword, garments, armaments, troops, spices,<sup><xref rid="fn927">177</xref></sup> counsellors, guards, spies, justice and righteousness, as it is stated, <italic>For the throne is established by righteousness</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn928">178</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x2018;The priesthood [in the form of] twenty-four distinctions&#x2019;:<sup><xref rid="fn929">179</xref></sup> viz. ten in [the precincts of] the Temple, ten in the provincial towns and four in Jerusalem. Ten in [the precincts of] the Temple, viz. the sin-offering [of an animal], trespass-offering [for a known sin], peace-offerings of the congregation, sin-offering of a bird, trespass-offering for a doubtful sin, the <italic>log</italic> of oil in the case of a leper, the two loaves, the shewbread, remnant of the &#x2018;Omer and remnants of the meal-offerings. Ten in the provincial towns, viz. <italic>terumah</italic>, the <italic>terumah</italic> of the tithe, <italic>&#x1E25;allah</italic>, the first of the fleece, the shoulder, cheeks and maw, the redemption of the first-born son, the redemption of the firstling of an ass, [payment of a fine for] robbery committed against a proselyte,<sup><xref rid="fn930">180</xref></sup> devoted [articles],<sup><xref rid="fn931">181</xref></sup> and a field of possession.<sup><xref rid="fn932">182</xref></sup> And four in Jerusalem, viz. the firstlings, the first fruits, the portion separated of the thanks-offering, and of the ram of the Nazirite. What are these [portions]? The breast and the thigh. It has been taught:<sup><xref rid="fn933">183</xref></sup> All these [perquisites] were granted to Aaron by <italic>&#x1E33;al wa&#x1E25;omer, gezerah shawah, binyan &#x2019;ab</italic> and <italic>kelal ufera&#x1E6D;</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn934">184</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x2018;But the Torah [is acquired in the form of] forty-eight&#x2019;: Great is the Torah for it gives life. What is the force of the additional verse?<sup><xref rid="fn935">185</xref></sup> Should you say that [the Torah gives] health to a man&#x2019;s flesh but not to his bones, come and hear: [It is written,] <italic>and marrow to thy bones</italic>.

And should you say that [it gives] peace but not life, come and hear: <italic>She is a tree of life</italic>. And should you say that [it gives] life but not honour, come and hear: <italic>For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head</italic>. And should you say that it brings honour but not protection, come and hear: <italic>A crown of glory will she bestow on thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn936">186</xref></sup> And should you say that [it gives] protection in this world but its reward is lost in the World to Come, come and hear: <italic>Length of days is in her right hand</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn937">187</xref></sup> and it declares, <italic>O Lord, for evermore</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn938">188</xref></sup> And should you say that it mentions <italic>days</italic> but not years, come and hear: <italic>For length of days and years of life &#x2026; will they add to thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn939">189</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x2018;R. Simeon b. Judah said in the name of R. Simeon [b. Yo&#x1E25;ai].&#x2019; The question was asked: To which [verses] does R. Simeon&#x2019;s statement make reference? Is it to the verses preceding [the earlier part] ending with <italic>and years of life</italic>, etc.? Or is it perhaps to those which he was about to cite [in the Baraitha]? Since he enumerates seven things<sup><xref rid="fn940">190</xref></sup> it is proved that he refers to the earlier part because there also there are seven.</p>
<p>The question was asked: What is the meaning of <italic>And before His elders shall be Glory?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn941">191</xref></sup> Come and hear: Rab said: Who has a share in the World to Come?

They are interpreted homiletically as the stages of a man&#x2019;s spiritual progress through the study of the Torah.

<ftnote id="fn828">(78) R. Jo&#x1E25;anan gives only one cause for the first destruction and one for the second destruction.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn829">(79) One cause was the effect of the other, and so there were not two causes.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn842">(92) Cf. &#x2018;A.Z. 20b (Sonc. ed., p. 107).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn843">(93) The word &#x2018;reverence&#x2019; seems to be an error for &#x2018;meekness&#x2019;, otherwise the answer is unintelligible. [Because in the Baraitha &#x2018;reverence&#x2019; is linked with &#x2018;meekness&#x2019;, the answer may be that since R. Meir nowhere makes the statement with respect to the first, it cannot be his statement.]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn844">(94) Cf. Sanh. 26b (Sonc. ed., p. 155) where the word is derived from the root <span dir="rtl">&#x05EA;&#x05E9;&#x05E9;</span>, &#x2018;to weaken&#x2019;.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn850">(100) lit. &#x2018;the Torah&#x2019;. God frees scholars from anxiety by providing them with sustenance, because otherwise they could not progress in their studies. The verse from Job is accordingly understood in this sense: &#x2018;He abolisheth the thoughts of the skilled (i.e. scholars), lest their hands perform nothing substantial&#x2019;. Cf. Sanh. 26b (Sonc. ed., p. 155, n. 11).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn851">(101) Reading with H <italic>menaher</italic>, &#x2018;enlighten&#x2019;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn859">(109) Ex. XIX, 19, which seems to imply that it was not God Who spoke.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn860">(110) Num. VII, 89. Here it is clear that God is speaking.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn883">(133) Job VI, 15. The verb overflow is lit. &#x2018;pass&#x2019;, which is here taken in the sense &#x2018;pass away, dry up&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn884">(134) This translation follows the text of V and H, according to which the meaning given to overflow as &#x2018;pass away&#x2019; is countered by the explanation that the <italic>brooks</italic> are like the <italic>bamoth</italic> which continued in existence after God commanded their abolition.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn885">(135) The text of H is followed. <italic>Derek &#x2019;Ere&#x1E93;</italic> is a treatise on ethical conduct, included in this series of Minor Tractates.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn890">(140) Isa. XXXIII, 15. Again the root <italic>&#x2018;a&#x1E93;am</italic> has the letter <italic>&#x2018;ayin</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn891">(141) So rendered by H. It may mean examples of a natural interchange of sibilants.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn892">(142) Cf. B.B. 116b (Sonc. ed., p. 695) where both words are used in the sense of &#x2018;bandits&#x2019;.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn894">(144) Be&#x1E93;ah <italic>loc. cit.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn895">(145) Hence the root <italic>sha&#x1E25;al</italic> means &#x2018;slip, fall&#x2019;, the same as the root <italic>nashal</italic> in <italic>mashshilin</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn896">(146) From the root <italic>nashar</italic>, &#x2018;fall&#x2019;.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn900">(150) A general example of the interchange of letters.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn901">(151) i.e. he is obligated to pay honour to him who teaches it to him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn902">(152) If taught warrants respect to the instructor.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn903">(153) Ps. LV, 15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn904">(154) i.e. taking counsel together.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn905">(155) Fellow-students in the course of discussion refute each other&#x2019;s conclusions if wrongly arrived at.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn906">(156) One is often misled by his own false reasoning.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn907">(157) Deut. XXVII, 9.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn911">(161) <italic>ibid.</italic> CXIX, 99, which is given the meaning: I have gained understanding from all my teachers (Ahitophel included).</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER IX</title>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn949">1</xref></sup><small>BARAITHA</small>. One should not take leave of his teacher or his friend without receiving permission. This rule of good manners all men may learn from the All-present, Who stood at the entrance of the Garden [of Eden] and called to Adam, as it is stated, <italic>And the Lord God called unto the man</italic> [<italic>&#x2019;Adam</italic>], <italic>and said unto him: Where art thou?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn950">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>One should not be impatient during his meal. It is reported of Hillel that once a man came to have a meal with him, when a poor person arrived and, standing at the door of his house, said to his wife, &#x2018;I am to be married today and I have no food&#x2019;. She took the entire meal and gave it to him. Then she went and kneaded fresh dough, cooked another meal and came in and placed it before them. [Hillel] said to her, &#x2018;My dear, why did you not bring this sooner?&#x2019; She told him what had happened; whereupon he said, &#x2018;My dear, I did not judge you in the scale of guilt but in the scale of merit, because all your deeds are for the sake of Heaven&#x2019;.</p>
<p>Let all persons always be in your eyes as robbers, but honour each with the respect due to Rabban Gamaliel.<sup><xref rid="fn951">3</xref></sup> It is related of R. Joshua that he extended hospitality [to all]. A man arrived to whom he gave food and drink, took up to the attic and then removed the ladder from under him. What did the man do? He arose in the middle of the night, spread out his cloak, took the vessels [belonging to the room] which he wrapped in his cloak and was about to descend when he fell and broke his collar-bone. In the morning R. Joshua came and, finding him [on the ground], said to him, &#x2018;You worthless person, do men act like you?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;I did not know that you had removed the ladder from under me&#x2019;. He said to him, &#x2018;Were you not aware that we were on our guard against you since yesterday?&#x2019;</p>
<p>Guests who are received in a house should do whatever the host bids them do. It is related of Simeon b. An&#x1E6D;ipa&#x1E6D;ros that once guests came to him and he bade them eat and drink; but they, vowing and swearing in the name of the Torah, [declined to do so]. When they were about to depart, he administered to them forty lashes. On hearing of this, the Sages were angered<sup><xref rid="fn952">4</xref></sup> by the incident and asked, &#x2018;Who will find out for us why he did this?&#x2019; R. Joshua said to them, &#x2018;I will go&#x2019;. They said, &#x2018;Go in peace&#x2019;. He went and found [Simeon] sitting at the door of his house, and said to him, &#x2018;Peace be upon you&#x2019;, to which he answered, &#x2018;Come in peace&#x2019;, and asked him, &#x2018;Is there anything you want?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;A place to lodge&#x2019;. [He said to him, &#x2018;Sit down in peace&#x2019;.]<sup><xref rid="fn953">5</xref></sup> The two of them sat down and occupied themselves with the study of the Torah until the evening. [In the morning he said to him,]<sup><xref rid="fn954">6</xref></sup> &#x2018;Do you wish that we go to the bath-house?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;As you wish&#x2019;. [Simeon] said to him, &#x2018;Sit down&#x2019;, and he sat. As time went on, R. Joshua was afraid lest he would beat him upon his shoulders. [After they had finished eating and drinking,]<sup><xref rid="fn955">7</xref></sup> he said to [Simeon], &#x2018;Who will accompany me?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;I will&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn956">8</xref></sup> Now R. Joshua was turning things over in his mind, saying to himself, &#x2018;What answer shall I give to the scholars who sent me?&#x2019; He turned round and [Simeon] asked him [55<italic>a</italic>], &#x2018;Why have you turned round?&#x2019; &#x2018;There is something which I must ask you&#x2019;, he said. &#x2018;Why do you beat men who come to you, but me you have not beaten?&#x2019; He answered, &#x2018;Rabbi, you are a great scholar and possessed of good manners. When men come to me I bid them eat and drink, but they vow by the Torah [that they will not eat] and later break<sup><xref rid="fn957">9</xref></sup> the vow; and I have heard from the Sages that he who makes a vow and breaks it is liable to receive lashes&#x2019;. He replied, &#x2018;I command you that you should give them twice forty [lashes], forty for me and forty for you&#x2019;. R. Joshua then went and reported to the Sages what he had seen in connection with the son of An&#x1E6D;ipa&#x1E6D;ros.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. &#x2018;Let all persons always be suspect in your eyes as robbers.&#x2019; But it is not so&#x0021; For we have learnt:<sup><xref rid="fn958">10</xref></sup> Do not judge thy fellow-man until thou art come to his place. There is no contradiction: the latter [refers to a man] whom you know and the other<sup><xref rid="fn959">11</xref></sup> when he is unknown. Raba said: In one passage &#x2018;persons&#x2019; is used and in the other &#x2018;thy fellow-man&#x2019;. Since [in Aboth the word used is <italic>&#x1E25;aberka</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn960">12</xref></sup> it clearly speaks of one who is known to him, but is the term &#x2018;all persons&#x2019; [used in the Baraitha] not to include a <italic>&#x1E25;aber?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn961">13</xref></sup> No;<sup><xref rid="fn962">14</xref></sup> the one is [to be explained] in its own way and the other in its own way.<sup><xref rid="fn963">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x2018;Guests who are received.&#x2019; But it is not so&#x0021; For we have learnt:<sup><xref rid="fn964">16</xref></sup> R. Eliezer [b. Jacob] said: Also he who wishes to subject his friend to a vow to eat with him should declare, &#x2018;Every vow which I will make shall be null&#x2019;. But perhaps these men [who visited Simeon b. An&#x1E6D;ipa&#x1E6D;ros] annulled their vow and yet he beat them when they were about to leave&#x0021; There is no one who accepts the view of R. Eliezer b. Jacob. Further, there<sup><xref rid="fn965">17</xref></sup> it is the host who makes the vow, but here<sup><xref rid="fn966">18</xref></sup> it is the guest as is evidenced by the words, &#x2018;Whatever the host bids them do&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn967">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x2018;When they were about to depart, he administered to them forty lashes.&#x2019; Infer from this that the <italic>halakah</italic> is according to the view of R. Judah who said: One liable to flagellation is given forty [lashes] in full&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn968">20</xref></sup> Raba said: [The Baraitha] uses colloquial language.<sup><xref rid="fn969">21</xref></sup> And as for R. Judah, does he not respect the prohibitory law,<sup><xref rid="fn970">22</xref></sup> as well as the law derived from the words, <italic>If the wicked man deserve to be beaten?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn971">23</xref></sup> He will reply, &#x2018;The extra lash is administered between his shoulders&#x2019;.</p>
<ftnote id="fn949">(1) This Baraitha is derived mainly from DER VI.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn950">(2) Gen. III, 9. God was about to part from Adam (cf. <italic>ibid.</italic> 24).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn951">(3) A Patriarch of Palestine and eminent teacher (1st cent. <small>C.E.</small>) of whom it was said, &#x2018;When he died the honour of the Torah ceased, and purity and piety became extinct&#x2019; (So&#x1E6D;ah IX, 15, Sonc. ed., p. 266).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn961">(13) Even when one knows him. <italic>&#x1E24;aber</italic> is used here in the sense of &#x2018;scholar&#x2019;, who is above suspicion.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn962">(14) Such an inference is not to be drawn.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn963">(15) A <italic>&#x1E25;aber</italic>, whether known to you or not, should not be suspected; but one who cannot be described as a <italic>&#x1E25;aber</italic> is to be suspected.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn966">(18) In the Baraitha.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn967">(19) How was the guest to know beforehand what the host would bid him do? We are therefore not afraid lest the guest annulled the vow beforehand.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn968">(20) Cf. Mak. 22a-23a (Sonc. ed., pp. 155-162). Whereas Deut. XXV, 2f., prescribes forty lashes, according to the Rabbis only thirty-nine were given as a precaution against the forty being inadvertently exceeded. R. Judah&#x2019;s opinion was otherwise.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn969">(21) i.e. people speak of &#x2018;forty stripes&#x2019; when in fact they mean thirty-nine; therefore no inference can be drawn.</ftnote>

The thirty-nine lashes were divided into three groups of thirteen, administered first on the front of the man&#x2019;s exposed body, and the remaining two groups on each shoulder respectively. Cf. Mak. 22b (Sonc. ed., p. 158).</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER X</title>
<p label="1."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn972">1</xref></sup> How does one dance<sup><xref rid="fn973">2</xref></sup> before the bride? Beth Shammai said: The bride as she is; and Beth Hillel said: Beautiful and graceful bride&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn974">3</xref></sup> Beth Shammai said to Beth Hillel: Even if she is lame or blind? But it is written, <italic>Keep thee far from a false matter&#x0021;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn975">4</xref></sup> Beth Hillel replied: If one has made a bad purchase, should one esteem it in his eyes or depreciate it? Surely one should esteem it in his eyes. Therefore Beth Hillel said: Always should the disposition of a man be pleasant towards his fellow-creatures.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. But how can Beth Hillel [say of a bride] that she is beautiful when in fact she is not? [Beth Hillel can reply that in the circumstances people will understand it as] beautiful in her deeds and graceful in her person because we do not presume [to attribute to a person] what is unbecoming. And [what can] Beth Shammai [reply to this]? They can say: Is it written, &#x2018;Keep far from a falsehood&#x2019;? [It is written, <italic>From a false</italic>] <italic>matter</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn976">5</xref></sup> even if it be inexplicit.<sup><xref rid="fn977">6</xref></sup> And [what can] Beth Hillel [reply to this]? They can say: When the All-present declared, <italic>Keep thee far from a false matter</italic>, it is in connection with what follows, <italic>And the innocent and righteous slay thou not;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn978">7</xref></sup> but where it is a case of preserving life<sup><xref rid="fn979">8</xref></sup> it is in order [to depart from the strict truth]. Should the question be raised: Why do Beth Hillel in their refutation cite the example of &#x2018;a bad purchase&#x2019;, let them refute Beth Shammai from the Torah&#x0021; For it has been taught:<sup><xref rid="fn980">9</xref></sup> Great is peace, seeing that for its sake the Holy One, blessed be He, modified a statement. At first it is written, <italic>My lord being old</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn981">10</xref></sup> and afterwards, <italic>I &#x2026; who am old</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn982">11</xref></sup> [Beth Hillel] can reply: There is no question [that what we say] is correct according to the Torah, but it is also correct by the standard of human beings; reverse it.<sup><xref rid="fn983">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>[It was quoted above:] <italic>And the innocent and righteous slay thou not</italic>. Since you mention <italic>the innocent</italic> [may not be slain], obviously the <italic>righteous</italic> [may not]&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn984">13</xref></sup> [It denotes] &#x2018;innocent because of witnesses&#x2019; and &#x2018;righteous because of disciples&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn985">14</xref></sup> From this we learn [the ruling]: Do not put to death &#x2018;the innocent because of witnesses&#x2019; and &#x2018;the condemned because of disciples&#x2019;. [Do you think,] &#x2018;Condemned because of disciples&#x2019;? Say, because of <italic>one</italic> of the disciples.<sup><xref rid="fn986">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Raba expounded: What is the meaning of what is written, <italic>For the Lord is righteous, He loveth righteousness; the upright shall behold His face?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn987">16</xref></sup> If so, [the verse should read,] &#x2018;He loveth the righteous&#x2019;&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn988">17</xref></sup> But [it is to be understood] as Raba interpreted it:<sup><xref rid="fn989">18</xref></sup> Abraham<sup><xref rid="fn990">19</xref></sup> comes and brings [redemption to the wicked who are under sentence to suffer in Gehinnom, in agreement with] Resh La&#x1E33;ish [who said: The fire of Gehinnom has no power over the transgressors in Israel,] or it may be deduced by an argument from minor to major [from the golden altar], as it is stated, <italic>Every one that is written unto life in Jerusalem</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn991">20</xref></sup></p>
<p label="2."><small>BARAITHA</small>. One should not be joyous when in the presence of those who weep, or weep in the presence of those who rejoice. One should not be awake among those who sleep or asleep among those who are awake.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. On what grounds does the Baraitha first teach, &#x2018;One should not be joyous&#x2019;? Let it first teach, &#x2018;Or weep&#x2019;, etc.&#x0021; Firstly, because one should not begin with unfortunate circumstances,<sup><xref rid="fn992">21</xref></sup> but on the contrary, priority should be given to the majority.<sup><xref rid="fn993">22</xref></sup> [The Baraitha] follows the teaching of Solomon [who wrote], <italic>It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn994">23</xref></sup> Here is an additional proof: [The Baraitha] reads, &#x2018;One should not be joyous&#x2019; and not &#x2018;One should not make merry&#x2019;, and then &#x2018;or weep&#x2019; and not &#x2018;be serious&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn995">24</xref></sup></p>
<p label="3."><small>BARAITHA</small>. One should not be impatient at meals.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. One should not be [impatient] at meals; [is it then to be inferred from this] that in giving an exposition [of Torah], in studying and in other matters one may be [impatient]? Did not Beth Hillel cite this and say to Shammai, &#x2018;Although you are hot-tempered and consequently overawe your fellow-beings, yet do not display impatience [towards the members of your household]<sup><xref rid="fn996">25</xref></sup> lest you hinder them from performing good deeds&#x2019;?</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn997">26</xref></sup>It once happened that two<sup><xref rid="fn998">27</xref></sup> men made a wager with each other, saying, &#x2018;He who goes and makes Hillel angry shall receive four hundred <italic>zuz&#x2019;</italic>. Said one, &#x2018;I will go and incense him&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn999">28</xref></sup> That day was the Sabbath-eve, and Hillel was washing his head. He went, passed by the door of his house and called out, &#x2018;Is Hillel here, is Hillel here?&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1000">28<italic>a</italic></xref></sup> Thereupon he robed and went out to him, saying, &#x2018;My son, what do you require?&#x2019; &#x2018;I have a question to ask,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;Ask, my son,&#x2019; he prompted. Thereupon he asked, &#x2018;Why are the heads of the Babylonians<sup><xref rid="fn1001">29</xref></sup> round?&#x2019; &#x2018;My son, you have asked a great question,&#x2019; replied he; &#x2018;because they have no skilful midwives.&#x2019; He departed, tarried a while, returned and called out, &#x2018;Is Hillel here, is Hillel here?&#x2019; He robed and went out to him, saying, &#x2018;My son, what do you require?&#x2019; &#x2018;I have a question to ask,&#x2019; said he. &#x2018;Ask, my son,&#x2019; he prompted. Thereupon he asked, &#x2018;Why are the eyes of the Palmyreans bleared?&#x2019; &#x2018;My son, you have asked a great question,&#x2019; replied he; &#x2018;because they live in sandy places.&#x2019; He departed, tarried a while, returned and called out, &#x2018;Is Hillel here, is Hillel here?&#x2019; He robed and went out to him, saying, &#x2018;My son, what do you require?&#x2019; &#x2018;I have a question to ask,&#x2019; said he. &#x2018;Ask, my son,&#x2019; he prompted. He asked, &#x2018;Why are the feet of the Africans wide?&#x2019; &#x2018;My son, you have asked a great question,&#x2019; said he; &#x2018;because they live in watery marshes.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1002">30</xref></sup> &#x2018;I have many questions to ask,&#x2019; said he, &#x2018;but fear that you may become angry.&#x2019; Thereupon he robed, sat before him and said, &#x2018;Ask all the questions you have to ask&#x2019;. &#x2018;Are you the Hillel who is called the <italic>Nasi&#x2019;</italic> of Israel?&#x2019; &#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; he replied. &#x2018;If that is so,&#x2019; he retorted, &#x2018;may there not be many like you in Israel.&#x2019; &#x2018;Why, my son?&#x2019; queried he. &#x2018;Because I have lost four hundred <italic>zuz</italic> through you,&#x2019; complained he. &#x2018;Be careful of your moods,&#x2019; he answered, &#x2018;Hillel is worth it that you should lose four hundred <italic>zuz</italic> and yet another four hundred <italic>zuz</italic> through him, yet Hillel shall not lose his temper.&#x2019;</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn1003">31</xref></sup>It once happened that R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba, accompanied by an Athenian, went on a journey and chanced to stay with a Gentile. He prepared for them four beds, laid an abundant meal before them and gave them wine to drink. They said, &#x2018;We discern that this wine [has the flavour of]the dead&#x2019;. He brought them meat and they said, &#x2018;This meat is dog&#x2019;s flesh&#x2019;. He brought them pickle and they said, &#x2018;It contains urine&#x2019;. He brought them mustard and they said, &#x2018;It contains beetles&#x2019;. [The host] went to the tavern-keeper and asked, &#x2018;What happened to the wine?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;Nothing&#x2019;. He said, &#x2018;I adjure you to tell me&#x2019;. He replied, &#x2018;The wine comes from my father&#x2019;s vineyard where he is buried&#x2019;. He went to the butcher who told him, &#x2018;It was the meat of a lamb whose dam died and I made her suck from a bitch&#x2019;. He went to the pickle-maker who told him, &#x2018;One night I was drunk and [my family] locked me in. I wanted to pass water but was unable to go out, so I opened this [jar of pickle] and poured the urine into it&#x2019;. He went to the mustard-maker who told him, &#x2018;One night I left [the mustard] uncovered and beetles got into it&#x2019;. He then took the trouble to prepare [another] meal for them. They said one to another, &#x2018;We notice that the host&#x2019;s legs are like those of a clown&#x2019;. The host overheard this and said [to himself], &#x2018;Perhaps these men speak the truth&#x2019;. So he pretended to be very ill and people came to visit him. He said to his mother, &#x2018;If you disclose to me the name of my father I will recover&#x2019;. She told him, but he said to her, &#x2018;You are telling a lie&#x2019;. Since she noticed that he was grieved she said to him, &#x2018;My son, once my husband brought a clown to me; I misconducted myself with him and conceived you&#x2019;. He went and embraced them, bowed to them and exclaimed, &#x2018;In truth you are the people of the Holy God&#x2019;. This is what Solomon said, <italic>For in much wisdom is much vexation; and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1004">32</xref></sup></p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn1005">33</xref></sup>A man once entered a school and said to a child, &#x2018;Take this money and bring me something of which we can eat our fill and leave some over to take home&#x2019;. He brought him salt and said to him, &#x2018;Sir, you may eat your fill and leave some over to take home&#x2019;.</p>
<p label="4."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1006">34</xref></sup> A man should not eat leek or onion from its top but from the leaves; and if he did eat [in that manner] he is a glutton. A man should not eat using all his fingers because he has the appearance of a glutton; nor should one put his hand into his mouth.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. Raba said: This<sup><xref rid="fn1007">35</xref></sup> applies only during the meal but not after it. Why? Because he may be delicate.<sup><xref rid="fn1008">36</xref></sup></p>
<p label="5."><small>BARAITHA</small>. He should only fill his cup with as much as it is his intention [to drink].</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. What is the reason? Because of the &#x2018;remnants&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn1009">37</xref></sup> For the master said: All the &#x2018;remnants&#x2019; of cups make one dull except the &#x2018;remnants&#x2019; of the <italic>Habdalah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1010">38</xref></sup> One who drinks &#x2018;remnants&#x2019; for forty [days] will not survive.</p>
<p label="6."><small>BARAITHA</small>. One should not take a potsherd which is full to the brim and drink from it so as not to offend fastidious persons. One should not handle a vessel with greasy fingers; nor should one blow on water and drink it for two [reasons].<sup><xref rid="fn1011">39</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. The Rabbis have taught:<sup><xref rid="fn1012">40</xref></sup> There are three whose life is not life, viz. the [over-] compassionate, the hot-tempered and the fastidious. R. Joseph said: All these [qualities] are found in me.</p>
<p>[It is written,] <italic>All the days of the poor are evil</italic>&#x2014;this refers to a discontented man. <italic>But he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1013">41</xref></sup>&#x2014;this refers to a contented man.<sup><xref rid="fn1014">42</xref></sup> Another explanation: <italic>All the days of the poor are evil</italic>&#x2014;this refers to the compassionate. <italic>But he that is of a merry heart</italic>&#x2014;this refers to the cruel.</p>
<p>Raba expounded:<sup><xref rid="fn1015">43</xref></sup> Whoever is distinguished by the following three characteristics is certain that he is of the seed of our father Abraham: merciful, bashful and benevolent. This is all right with the benevolent, for it is written, <italic>Thou wilt show faithfulness to Jacob, mercy to Abraham;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1016">44</xref></sup> also bashful, as Raba interpreted: <italic>Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1017">45</xref></sup> but why merciful? Abraham had no mercy upon his son&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn1018">46</xref></sup> Herein is to be found the greatness of Abraham, to make known how great was his love for the Holy One, blessed be He.<sup><xref rid="fn1019">47</xref></sup></p>
<p label="7."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1020">48</xref></sup> One should not move a piece of bread across the plate or wipe the plate with it. He should not drink from his cup and pass it to his friend; nor should he bite into the bread and pass it to his friend unless he knows his friend&#x2019;s mind [that he does not object]. Five things have been said in connection with bread:<sup><xref rid="fn1021">49</xref></sup> [Raw meat should not be placed on bread, or a cup of wine on bread, or a plate on bread. Bread should not be thrown about, and one should not sit on articles of food].</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. Raba said: A piece of bread should not be placed on a book or a book on a piece of bread; a book should not be rested against a piece of bread or a piece of bread against a book. If it was his intention to recite <italic>&#x1E32;iddush</italic> over it, he may not put it in an unclean place.</p>
<p label="8."><small>BARAITHA</small>. A man should not send to his fellow a cask of water<sup><xref rid="fn1022">50</xref></sup> as oil.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. What is the reason? It is forbidden to do anything which may give him offence; as it is written, <italic>Nor put a stumbling-block before the blind</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1023">51</xref></sup> The question was asked: May one send to a Gentile a thigh which has been cooked with the sinew?<sup><xref rid="fn1024">52</xref></sup> It is obvious that [one may not send to a Gentile] a limb cut from a living animal, for the master said:<sup><xref rid="fn1025">53</xref></sup> The sons of Noah<sup><xref rid="fn1026">54</xref></sup> were forbidden to eat a limb cut from a living animal; therefore [one who sent a Gentile meat with the sinew of the thigh would commit an offence] because of <italic>Nor put a stumbling-block before the blind</italic>. But here [with the sinew of the thigh] they were not [forbidden and a violation of the law would not arise]; or perhaps there is a difference between the two cases&#x0021; Come and hear:<sup><xref rid="fn1027">54<italic>a</italic></xref></sup> A man may send to a Gentile a thigh wherein is the sinew.</p>
<p label="9."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1028">55</xref></sup> A man may not say to his fellow, &#x2018;Take oil from the jar when it is [in fact] empty&#x2019;.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. He who steals the mind<sup><xref rid="fn1029">56</xref></sup> of his fellow is as though he deceived the All-present, because the Torah decreed that the robber must pay in full<sup><xref rid="fn1030">57</xref></sup> for the theft, but the thief must pay twofold in the case of articles, fourfold in the case of sheep, but fivefold in the case of cattle.<sup><xref rid="fn1031">58</xref></sup> Why [the difference]? Because the All-merciful showed consideration [to the thief for his trouble].</p>
<p label="10."><small>BARAITHA</small>. A man should not eat [his breakfast] until four hours [of the day],<sup><xref rid="fn1032">59</xref></sup> or drink until four hours.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. But it is not so&#x0021; Did not Raba say to Rabbah b. Mari:<sup><xref rid="fn1033">60</xref></sup> Whence can the popular saying be derived, &#x2018;Sixty runners may pursue him who has an early meal in the morning and will not overtake him&#x2019;? And the Rabbis said: Have early breakfast in the summer because of the heat and in winter because of the cold&#x0021; There it speaks of the morning meal [which is light], but here it deals with a heavy meal.</p>
<p label="11."><small>BARAITHA</small>. A man should bathe at<sup><xref rid="fn1034">61</xref></sup> four hours.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. This is an unnecessary statement.<sup><xref rid="fn1035">62</xref></sup></p>
<p label="12."><small>BARAITHA</small>. When his cup is filled,<sup><xref rid="fn1036">63</xref></sup> he should pause in drinking it.<sup><xref rid="fn1037">64</xref></sup> How many [pauses]? If [it is mixed] with warm water, he should pause three times; if with cold, four times, so that [it is equivalent to] his having been given four cups.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. But it says four&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn1038">65</xref></sup> This refers to when the cup is mixed with warm water.<sup><xref rid="fn1039">66</xref></sup></p>
<p label="13."><small>BARAITHA</small>. When about to enter the bath-house how should a man act? He says,<sup><xref rid="fn1040">67</xref></sup> &#x2018;May it be Thy will, O Lord my God, that Thou bring me in in peace and bring me out in peace. Do Thou save me from this and similar [dangers] in the future and may no mishap befall me; and if it does, may my death be an atonement for all my sins&#x2019;. Before entering and after he has recited the prayer, he takes off his shirt, loosens his girdle, removes his hat and then slips off his undergarment. It is similar with the [removal of the] <italic>tefillin:</italic> first he removes the phylactery of the head and then the phylactery of the hand.<sup><xref rid="fn1041">68</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. From this you may deduce that there is no sanctity attached to the hat.<sup><xref rid="fn1042">69</xref></sup> This applies only to the hat but not to the turban,<sup><xref rid="fn1043">70</xref></sup> as it is written, <italic>The counsel</italic> [<italic>sod</italic>] <italic>of the Lord is with them that fear Him</italic> [<italic>yere&#x2019;aw</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn1044">71</xref></sup></p>
<p>Why does the Baraitha use the verb &#x2018;says&#x2019; and not &#x2018;makes the benediction&#x2019;:<sup><xref rid="fn1045">72</xref></sup> &#x2018;May it be Thy will, O Lord my God, to deliver me from this and similar [dangers] in the future&#x2019;; and when leaving he says, &#x2018;Lord of the universe&#x0021; I thank Thee for that Thou hast delivered me from sinking in the water<sup><xref rid="fn1046">73</xref></sup> and from being burnt by fire.<sup><xref rid="fn1047">74</xref></sup> May it be Thy will to deliver me from anything similar in the future&#x2019;? [The Baraitha] is concerned with right conduct<sup><xref rid="fn1048">75</xref></sup> and not with the benedictions [to be recited]. But what about the following which is learnt at the end of the chapter:<sup><xref rid="fn1049">76</xref></sup> One who enters a privy says, &#x201C;Be honoured [ye honoured and holy beings who minister to the Most High&#x0021; Give glory to our God, remain in your place, be mindful, help me, guard me, wait for me until I shall have entered and left; for what I am doing is the way of men&#x201D;]&#x2019;? There it is not a case of a &#x2018;benediction&#x2019;, for the master said:<sup><xref rid="fn1050">77</xref></sup> If he wrapped himself in a <italic>&#x1E6D;allith</italic> with fringes attached, he leaves it in the corner and he has no need to recite a prayer. Why, then, [does it continue with: One who leaves a privy says,] &#x2018;Blessed be &#x2026; Who hast formed man in wisdom&#x2019;?<sup><xref rid="fn1051">78</xref></sup> While it deals with the one, it also [takes the opportunity] to deal with the other.</p>
<p label="14."><small>BARAITHA</small>. One who enters the bath-house should not exercise himself,<sup><xref rid="fn1052">79</xref></sup> or scrape himself on the marble [slab], or have his limbs broken.<sup><xref rid="fn1053">80</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. What is the meaning of &#x2018;exercise himself&#x2019;? For example, pressing his head between his knees. &#x2018;Or scrape himself&#x2019;: but it is not so&#x0021; For [we are informed that] the servant of Raba scraped him&#x0021; It speaks of scraping with the hand. &#x2018;Or have his limbs broken&#x2019;; Rabban Gamaliel said: Whoever has his limbs broken on the marble is the companion of an ass.<sup><xref rid="fn1054">81</xref></sup></p>
<p label="15."><small>BARAITHA</small>. In the bath-house, one who enters gives way to the one who is leaving.<sup><xref rid="fn1055">82</xref></sup> A man should not greet his friend in the bath-house,<sup><xref rid="fn1056">83</xref></sup> and if he greets him first he should say to him, &#x2018;This is a bath-house&#x2019;. One who eats in the street is the companion of a dog.<sup><xref rid="fn1057">84</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. This applies to bread and foods which [are eaten to satisfy] one&#x2019;s hunger, but not to other things.</p>
<p label="16."><small>BARAITHA</small>. A man should not leave oil<sup><xref rid="fn1058">85</xref></sup> in a glass because of danger.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. What [danger] is there? Lest it be broken and endanger [the bathers]. As Samuel said:<sup><xref rid="fn1059">86</xref></sup> If one bathes without anointing [he is like water poured over a barrel].<sup><xref rid="fn1060">87</xref></sup> Say,<sup><xref rid="fn1061">88</xref></sup> &#x2018;And has not anointed himself previously&#x2019;.</p>
<p label="17."><small>BARAITHA</small>. A man should not spit anywhere in front of his fellow or put his foot on the bath and jump into it, because it may lead to death. He who recites the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1062">89</xref></sup> twice is reprehensible. So, too, is he reprehensible who immerses twice.<sup><xref rid="fn1063">90</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. Lest [the water from his head and beard] drip on to people without their noticing it.<sup><xref rid="fn1064">91</xref></sup></p>
<p label="18."><small>BARAITHA</small>. If one bathes in hot water and does not slush himself with cold water he robs the public.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. How is this? For example, he entered the bath and they brought him warm water, and he slushed himself with it and then went out; in such a case he has robbed the public&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn1065">92</xref></sup> But should this not be excluded [from the category of robbery] seeing that his bathing is not beneficial to him?<sup><xref rid="fn1066">93</xref></sup> He warms himself at home; or [the bath-house] is near a river.<sup><xref rid="fn1067">94</xref></sup></p>
<p label="19."><small>BARAITHA</small>. If one has robbed the public, what should he do [to atone for his sin]?<sup><xref rid="fn1068">95</xref></sup> He should dig wells, ditches and grottoes, or repair roads and streets; then he will be pardoned.<sup><xref rid="fn1069">96</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. In accordance with whose view [is this Baraitha]? R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba&#x2019;s, who said:<sup><xref rid="fn1070">97</xref></sup> This is not the way that would absolve him from sin unless he pays [the full amount of the robbery] to each person. You might even say that it is in accordance with the view of R. &#x1E6C;arfon, because here [the amount] lies before them.<sup><xref rid="fn1071">98</xref></sup></p>
<p label="20."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1072">99</xref></sup> As for them who write [Torah] scrolls <italic>tefillin</italic> and <italic>mezuzoth</italic>, they, their traders and their traders&#x2019; traders<sup><xref rid="fn1073">100</xref></sup> do not see a sign of blessing.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. &#x2018;As for them who write scrolls&#x2019;:<sup><xref rid="fn1074">101</xref></sup> because they may omit or add a letter.<sup><xref rid="fn1075">102</xref></sup></p>
<p>We have learnt there:<sup><xref rid="fn1076">103</xref></sup> If one says, &#x2018;There is no precept of <italic>tefillin</italic> so that a Biblical law may be transgressed&#x2019;, he is exempt [from punishment].<sup><xref rid="fn1077">104</xref></sup> [But if he rules that the phylactery of the head must consist of] five compartments, thus adding to the words of the Sages, he is liable.<sup><xref rid="fn1078">105</xref></sup> According to whom is this? It is according to R. Simeon who said: [It is written,] <italic>For thy love is better than wine</italic>:<sup><xref rid="fn1079">106</xref></sup> [these are the scribes]. Accordingly when the man<sup><xref rid="fn1080">107</xref></sup> uproots a whole [commandment of the Torah] or a whole verse, he is not liable;<sup><xref rid="fn1081">108</xref></sup> but where he uproots the law concerning a suspended letter<sup><xref rid="fn1082">109</xref></sup> or crownlets on letters<sup><xref rid="fn1083">110</xref></sup> he is liable.<sup><xref rid="fn1084">111</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Rabbis have taught:<sup><xref rid="fn1085">112</xref></sup> The [earnings of] writers of scrolls, [the wages of] interpreters,<sup><xref rid="fn1086">113</xref></sup> money which comes from countries overseas,<sup><xref rid="fn1087">114</xref></sup> and [the payment of] <italic>&#x1E25;azzanim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1088">115</xref></sup> never see a sign of blessing. &#x2018;The [earnings of] writers of scrolls&#x2019;: what are these scrolls? The twenty-four books<sup><xref rid="fn1089">116</xref></sup> if not examined. &#x2018;Interpreters&#x2019;: because they receive pay for work on the Sabbath. &#x2018;Money which comes from countries overseas&#x2019;: because a miracle happened.<sup><xref rid="fn1090">117</xref></sup> &#x2018;And [the payment of] <italic>&#x1E25;azzanim&#x2019;</italic>: Because [they are engaged] in the work of the Lord. It has been taught:<sup><xref rid="fn1091">118</xref></sup> They who write scrolls, <italic>tefillin</italic> and <italic>mezuzoth</italic> do not see a sign of blessing; but if they engage [in this task] for its own sake,<sup><xref rid="fn1092">119</xref></sup> they do see [a sign of blessing].</p>
<p label="21."><small>BARAITHA</small>. He who looks to the earnings of his ass or to the earnings of his wife<sup><xref rid="fn1093">120</xref></sup> does not see a sign of blessing.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. What is the reason? Because it is written, <italic>A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1094">121</xref></sup> a beast does regard the life of a righteous man. &#x2018;The earnings of his wife&#x2019;: for it is written, [<italic>And there will be goat&#x2019;s milk enough</italic>] <italic>for thy food, for the food of thy household; and maintenance for thy maidens</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1095">122</xref></sup> The Torah teaches that your food comes before the food of your household,<sup><xref rid="fn1096">123</xref></sup> and then comes the food of your maidens. Raba said: Whoever compels his wife or his household to work, the evil inclination departs from them;<sup><xref rid="fn1097">124</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>The wicked flee when no man pursueth; but the righteous are secure as a young lion</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1098">125</xref></sup> This conforms to what we learnt:<sup><xref rid="fn1099">126</xref></sup> Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel said: If a man forbade his wife under a vow to do any work, he must divorce her and give her her <italic>kethubah</italic>, because idleness leads to idiocy.</p>
<p label="22."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1100">127</xref></sup> He who trades in canes and jars will never see a sign of blessing.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. Because [their bulk being large] the [evil] eye has power over them. Therefore<sup><xref rid="fn1101">128</xref></sup> this applies only to [jars of] oil but not of wine.<sup><xref rid="fn1102">129</xref></sup></p>
<p label="23."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1103">130</xref></sup> Once R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba was sitting and expounding beneath an olive-tree and said: They who breed small cattle,<sup><xref rid="fn1104">131</xref></sup> they who cut down beautiful trees,<sup><xref rid="fn1105">132</xref></sup> and they who teach young children but do not do their work conscientiously will not see a sign of blessing.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. But it is not so&#x0021; For R. &#x1E24;anina said:<sup><xref rid="fn1106">133</xref></sup> If the value [of the tree for other purposes] exceeds that [of its fruit] it is permissible [to cut it down]. There<sup><xref rid="fn1107">134</xref></sup> it speaks of other kinds of trees and here of olive-trees. Deduce this from what [the Baraitha] teaches, &#x2018;He was sitting beneath an olive-tree&#x2019;. Why [an olive-tree]? Because the blessing [which it provides] is great and yet the man comes and cuts it down&#x0021; [I quote against that reasoning] the first clause, &#x2018;They who breed small cattle&#x2019;&#x0021; If it is because they are a blessing, why do they not see [a sign of blessing]? The text should read, &#x2018;They who slaughter [small cattle]&#x2019;.</p>
<p label="24."><small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1108">135</xref></sup> If he loosened his shoe and went out into the street he is regarded as haughty.</p>
<p><small>GEMARA</small>. What is he to do? This is what it means to say: If he put on<sup><xref rid="fn1109">136</xref></sup> his shoe when he went out into the street he is regarded as haughty. Raba said: It is forbidden to bring a haughty man into one&#x2019;s house; for the Rabbis said:<sup><xref rid="fn1110">137</xref></sup> Any man in whom is haughtiness of spirit will in the end stumble through an [unfaithful] married woman, as it is stated, <italic>Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1111">138</xref></sup> Even if he be learned in the Torah like Moses our teacher, he will not be free from the judgment of Gehinnom. As for everyone who is lowly of spirit, the Holy One, blessed be He, will save him from [evil] visitations that come upon the world; as it is stated, <italic>For thus saith the High and Lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1112">139</xref></sup> [55<italic>b</italic>].</p>
<ftnote id="fn972">(1) Keth. 16b-17a (Sonc. ed., pp. 92ff.).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn973">(2) The meaning here is to recite the praises of a bride.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn976">(5) lit. &#x2018;word&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn977">(6) It is therefore wrong to make a statement and expect people to take it in a different sense.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn981">(10) Gen. XVIII, 12.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn982">(11) <italic>ibid.</italic> 13. When Sarah was told by the angel that she would have a son she laughed to herself and exclaimed, <italic>My lord being old;</italic> but when God repeated what she had said to Abraham, not to hurt his feelings He changed the word to <italic>I &#x2026; who am old</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn983">(12) The text should read <italic>kelapp&#x00EB; &#x2019;alyah</italic>, lit. &#x2018;towards the tail&#x2019;, i.e. reverse it, and the word which follows is an explanatory gloss (Jastrow <italic>s.v. &#x2019;alyah</italic>). The meaning is, To meet the question raised, it would be best in the Baraitha first to cite the passage from Genesis and then the example of &#x2018;a bad purchase&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn984">(13) The term <italic>innocent</italic> has a negative connotation, viz. one who keeps away from evil; but the term <italic>righteous</italic> has both a negative and positive connotation, viz. one who keeps away from evil and does good.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn985">(14) These are forensic terms. I. Where two witnesses testify against a man that he had committed an offence but disagree on the details, the accused is discharged. E.g., two witnesses testify that they saw him worshipping idols; one says that he worshipped the sun and the other that it was the moon. Because the witnesses are in disagreement on details, the man is acquitted. He is technically termed <italic>na&#x1E33;i me&#x2018;edim</italic>, &#x2018;innocent (or, freed) because of [the disagreement of] witnesses&#x2019;. II. In the criminal court young scholars sat in rows in front of the judges. When the trial ended and before the verdict was delivered, any one of these scholars could, if he knew anything in favour of the accused, come forward and speak for him, and if the judges accepted his statement they discharged the accused. He was then termed <italic>&#x1E93;addi&#x1E33; min hattalmidim</italic>, &#x2018;righteous (i.e. acquitted) because of the disciples&#x2019;. If the disciple wished to testify against the accused, he was not permitted to do so. That would be a case of <italic>rasha&#x2018; min hattalmidim</italic>, &#x2018;condemned because of the disciples&#x2019;, which was not allowed. Cf. Sanh. 33b-34a (Sonc. ed., p. 212) and Rashi <italic>ad loc.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn986">(15) This refusal to listen to disciples&#x2019; statements against the accused holds good only when <italic>one</italic> disciple came forward. This procedure is based on Num. XXXV, 30; cf. Sanh. <italic>loc. cit.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn987">(16) Ps. XI, 7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn988">(17) Since He is described as <italic>righteous</italic>, that is the wording which might have been expected.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn989">(18) Cf. &#x2018;Erub 19a (Sonc. ed., pp. 129f.).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn990">(19) So the text must be emended. V reads &#x2018;from forty&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn991">(20) Isa. IV, 3. The text is obviously corrupt and is conjecturally reconstructed from the Talmud. Abraham, in freeing the sinners of Israel from Gehinnom, performs an act of righteousness which merits him the love of God, Who is righteous, especially as He has written unto [eternal] life <italic>every one in Jerusalem</italic> (i.e. the whole people of Israel).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn992">(21) lit. &#x2018;matters of punishment&#x2019;, here people who have cause to weep.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn993">(22) And the majority rejoice rather than weep.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn994">(23) Eccl. VII, 2. Here mourning is mentioned first.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn995">(24) The wording of the Baraitha proves that, like Ecclesiastes, it does not deal with ordinary merry-making and seriousness, but with rejoicings at a marriage-feast and the anguish one feels in a house of mourning.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1038">(65) The question i: directed against the last words of the Baraitha. The assumption was that this clause is to be taken in connection with the one immediately before it: &#x2018;If with cold, four times&#x2019;.

<ftnote id="fn1039">(66) In this case there are three pauses, making four draughts.</ftnote>

There is a dispute between R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba and R. &#x1E6C;arfon. According to the former he has to leave the full amount of the robbery with every one of the persons involved; but R. &#x1E6C;arfon holds the view that he has to leave the amount of the robbery with the five claimants and withdraw.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1080">(107) Who declared that there was no precept of <italic>tefillin</italic>.</ftnote>

<title>Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah</title>
<chapter>
<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<h1><small>NAME OF THE TRACTATE</small></h1>
<p><italic>Derek &#x2019;Ere&#x1E93;</italic> is the title of two tractates: <italic>Rabbah</italic> (the large) and <italic>Zu&#x1E6D;a</italic> (the small). They consist mainly of moral and ethical teachings. Contrary to what we might expect, they are not larger and shorter divisions of the same treatise, but independent works with but little in common. Consequently, the terms <italic>Rabbah</italic> and <italic>Zu&#x1E6D;a</italic> cannot have been parts of the original titles.</p>
<p>Many passages in <italic>Derek &#x2019;Ere&#x1E93;</italic> are to be found, with slight variations, in the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds. For other sayings, however, no source is found in Rabbinic literature. This would indicate that these collections of Baraithoth belong mainly to the period of the <italic>Tanna&#x00EF;m</italic>. Subsequently, additions were made to the original text, since the tractates include dicta from much later authorities.</p>
<p>Among the early authorities the treatises were known as <italic>Hilkoth</italic> (the laws of) D.E., <italic>Masseketh</italic> (tractate) D.E., <italic>Middoth</italic> (rules of) D.E., <italic>Pir&#x1E33;&#x00EB;</italic> (chapters of) D.E., <italic>Mishnath</italic> (the Mishnah of) D.E., or simply <italic>Derek &#x2019;Ere&#x1E93;</italic>. In the current editions printed in the Talmud, the tractates <italic>Rabbah</italic> and <italic>Zu&#x1E6D;a</italic> each consists of eleven chapters, several in the former being somewhat longer than in the latter. The text for the present translation follows in the main that of the Wilna-Romm edition; but note has been taken of the most important variants found in MSS. and other printed editions, some of which have been adopted in the translation, with explanations in the notes. Constant reference has also been made to the variant readings and emendations of the Wilna Gaon (GRA), as well as other commentaries printed in the same edition of the Talmud.</p>
<p>The term <italic>Derek &#x2019;Ere&#x1E93;</italic> signifies &#x2018;good manners, propriety, correct behaviour, refinement, etiquette&#x2019;. These have always been regarded as most important in Jewish life. Already in the Bible many instances are recorded of good manners and correct conduct. To quote but a few: the filial love and respect shown by Shem and Japheth in covering the nakedness of their father, Noah; Abraham waiving his right as the elder and allowing his nephew, Lot, to choose the land he desired; Abraham&#x2019;s hospitality to the angels; Rebekah&#x2019;s kindness to Eliezer and his camels; the gallantry displayed by Moses in helping Jethro&#x2019;s daughters, which may serve as an instance of respect towards women; the command to rise before the aged and honour the elder; the duty to assist the poor with interestfree loans; the precept of humanitarianism and charitableness towards an enemy and his animals; the laws guaranteeing civil, moral and religious rights to the stranger and proselyte; and the exhortation to avoid personal and moral pollution by keeping the camp holy.</p>
<h1><small>ANALYSIS OF THE TRACTATE</small></h1>
<p>The first two chapters were also known under the title Tractate <italic>&#x2018;Arayoth</italic> (prohibited marriages). According to the Wilna Gaon, they do not belong here but to <italic>Kallah</italic>. Several MSS., indeed, begin DER at the third chapter, and in them the whole work is entitled <italic>Pere&#x1E33; Ben &#x2018;Azzai</italic> from the opening words. The author of the Ma&#x1E25;zor Vi&#x1E6D;ri (who was a disciple of Rashi) makes this tractate begin with the fourth chapter. Both these variants are noted in the current editions printed in the Talmud.</p>
<p>In Coronel&#x2019;s edition of <italic>&#x1E24;amishshah &#x1E32;un&#x1E6D;rasim</italic> (1864) we find many passages in <italic>Kallah</italic> which are more suitable in <italic>Derek &#x2019;Ere&#x1E93;</italic>. Hence both these tractates may have been compiled about the same time, some passages becoming misplaced. In the view of Coronel there was also a Gemara attached to this tractate (as with <italic>Kallah Rabbathi</italic>) which antedated the redaction of the Talmud. But from a study of the language and style of the last-named it would seem to belong to a later period.</p>
<p>The first chapter was probably a separate work. It deals with marriages which are forbidden on account of consanguinity and concludes with some ethical maxims on the subject of marriage. The second chapter, too, may have been a separate collection, because its subject-matter is entirely different from the first. It contains reflections on twelve classes of persons who are to be condemned and twelve who are to be commended, with Biblical texts appropriate to each. Then comes a list of sins which bring about the eclipse of the heavenly luminaries and other misfortunes, and the chapter ends with some mystic remarks on God and Israel and the three hundred and ninety heavens.</p>
<p>The following chapters, much of whose contents is also found in ARN, consist of ethical, moral and social teachings generally expressed in pithy sentences, arranged in the style of the <italic>Pir&#x1E33;&#x00EB; Aboth</italic>, except that they are anonymous. They conclude with a list of occupations which are to be avoided, followed by a collection of liturgical prayers for special occasions.</p>
<h1><small>DATE OF COMPOSITION AND THE TEXT</small></h1>
<p>As already stated, the nucleus of the tractate was composed in the Tannaitic period, to which were added teachings of the early &#x2019;<italic>Amora&#x00EF;m</italic>. Not only is the meaning of some passages so obscure that we must assume that obvious errors must have crept in, but some passages are clearly out of place. The current text is often corrupt. There are MSS. and editions of both <italic>Rabbah</italic> and <italic>Zu&#x1E6D;a</italic> which contain numerous variations both in text and order. Rabbi Dr. M. Higger, in his edition (New York, 1935), lists the most important of these differences.</p>
<p>The following reasons may be suggested as accounting for these variations. We must recognize a distinction between literature in the strict sense, i.e. a work composed in accordance with literary rules and conventions, and a compilation which was intended for oral transmission and only later reduced to writing. Each has its own characteristics. Oral tradition tends to develop certain peculiarities to aid the memory; e.g. the grouping together in convenient summaries of ten, seven, five or three; the juxtaposition of certain laws or sayings which have a common catchword.</p>
<p>With literary composition of the strict kind, on the other hand, the logical connection is the rule to be followed. From the Rabbinic dictum, &#x2018;The words transmitted orally thou art not at liberty to recite from writing&#x2019; (Gi&#x1E6D;. 60b, Sonc. ed., p. 284), some scholars have inferred that no records of the oral Torah existed before the fifth century <small>C.E.</small>, the great mass of rulings and opinions which developed through the centuries being retained in the Schools entirely without the aid of writing. But this view is based on a misinterpretation of the passage. It only means that the oral Torah may not be committed to writing to be used as textbooks in the Schools.</p>
<p>The objection to committing the oral Torah to writing arose from the fear that it might become confused with, and be given the same authority as, the text of the Torah. But the teachers must have possessed much material in written form, and no doubt prepared their lectures from collections of this kind, treating them, however, for reference only and not as textbooks. They were not allowed to read their lecture from MS., to avoid creating the impression that the discourse carried the same authority as the Scriptures. Even Rabbi Judah the Prince, who, as many maintain, wrote down the Mishnah, as did R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba and R. Meir before him in their codifications, intended it to be a work of reference and not a textbook.</p>
<p>Teaching continued to be oral and from memory until the sixth century, when new conditions demanded a change in method. The material was by that time too vast to be retained by memory only. The existence of the Academies was threatened by persecution, and it was resolved to reduce to definitive form all that had hitherto been preserved orally.</p>
<p>If errors could creep into <italic>halakic</italic> (legal) material, as we find, though great care must have been taken against this happening, how much more so with a subject like <italic>Derek &#x2019;Ere&#x1E93;</italic>, especially if it was committed to writing only after a lapse of time&#x0021; Whereas with <italic>halakah</italic> notes of legal decisions might have been sufficient to aid one&#x2019;s memory, with <italic>Derek &#x2019;Ere&#x1E93;</italic> the need was felt to have fuller notes, perhaps for the guidance of one&#x2019;s family circle. In such a collection errors inevitably crept into the text, either from lapse of memory or through copyists&#x2019; mistakes.</p>

<title>DEREK &#x2019;ERE&#x1E92; RABBAH</title>
<title>CHAPTER I</title>
<p label="1.">When a man betroths<sup><xref rid="fn1113">1</xref></sup> a woman, he debars himself from [marrying] seven blood relations, viz.: her mother, her mother&#x2019;s mother, her father&#x2019;s mother, her daughter, her son&#x2019;s daughter, her daughter&#x2019;s daughter and her sister while she herself is alive.<sup><xref rid="fn1114">2</xref></sup> In all these who are prohibited to him, the interdict is never lifted except in the case of his wife&#x2019;s sister who is forbidden to him only during her lifetime;<sup><xref rid="fn1115">3</xref></sup> and never does he disqualify his wife [from cohabitation with him] through [his intercourse] with her mother, her daughter or her sister.<sup><xref rid="fn1116">4</xref></sup></p>
<p label="2.">If [after betrothal the woman] was raped, she is permitted to him,<sup><xref rid="fn1117">5</xref></sup> but should she have been a willing party she is forbidden to him. If she is the wife of a <italic>kohen</italic>, she is forbidden to him whether [it happened] under force or with her consent. [For it is stated, <italic>And she be not seized</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1118">6</xref></sup>&#x2014;[only then] is she forbidden; if, however, she was <italic>seized</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1119">7</xref></sup> she is permitted. There is another class of woman who is forbidden [to her husband] even though she had been <italic>seized;</italic> and who is that? The wife of a <italic>kohen</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1120">8</xref></sup> R. Ishmael<sup><xref rid="fn1121">9</xref></sup> said: <italic>And she be not seized</italic> she is forbidden; consequently if she had been <italic>seized</italic> she is permitted. There is another class of woman who is permitted [to her husband] even if she had not been <italic>seized;</italic> and who is that? A woman whose betrothal was mistaken.<sup><xref rid="fn1122">10</xref></sup>]</p>
<p>If a divorcee who became betrothed was seduced, whether under force or of her free will, she is forbidden to return to her former husband.<sup><xref rid="fn1123">11</xref></sup> This is the opinion of R. Jose b. &#x1E32;ippar in the name of R. Eleazar b. Shammua&#x2018;. This is the reasoning by which R. Jose b. &#x1E32;ippar expounded his view:<sup><xref rid="fn1124">12</xref></sup> [It is written,] <italic>Her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1125">13</xref></sup> In what circumstances did she become defiled?<sup><xref rid="fn1126">14</xref></sup> It can only be explained by what the Sages have said: If a woman [after betrothal] was forcibly seduced, she is permitted to [her husband]; if she was a willing party she is forbidden to him; but in this case,<sup><xref rid="fn1127">15</xref></sup> whether under compulsion or of her free will she is forbidden to return to her former husband.<sup><xref rid="fn1128">16</xref></sup></p>
<p label="3."><sup><xref rid="fn1129">17</xref></sup> None of the women forbidden to him on account of incest requires a <italic>ge&#x1E6D;</italic> from him if he married any of them<sup><xref rid="fn1130">18</xref></sup> except his wife&#x2019;s sister,<sup><xref rid="fn1131">19</xref></sup> his brother&#x2019;s wife<sup><xref rid="fn1132">20</xref></sup> and a married woman,<sup><xref rid="fn1133">21</xref></sup> because these have a termination to their prohibition.<sup><xref rid="fn1134">22</xref></sup></p>
<p label="4.">The following exposition was given by R. &#x1E24;anina b. Uri before [a gathering of] the Sages in the name of R. Nathan: Anyone who is included in the category <italic>Shall not enter</italic> [<italic>into the assembly of the Lord</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn1135">23</xref></sup> disqualifies a woman by his cohabitation<sup><xref rid="fn1136">24</xref></sup> and disqualifies the child.<sup><xref rid="fn1137">25</xref></sup> They are: an Ammonite,<sup><xref rid="fn1138">26</xref></sup> Moabite,<sup><xref rid="fn1139">27</xref></sup> Egyptian,<sup><xref rid="fn1140">28</xref></sup> Idumean,<sup><xref rid="fn1141">29</xref></sup> slave, bastard, <italic>nathin</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1142">30</xref></sup> Samaritan<sup><xref rid="fn1143">31</xref></sup> and a <italic>&#x1E25;alal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1144">32</xref></sup> The daughter of a <italic>&#x1E25;alal</italic> is fit<sup><xref rid="fn1145">33</xref></sup> although [her father] is within [the category of] <italic>shall not enter</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1146">34</xref></sup></p>
<p label="5.">If a man had intercourse with any of the women prohibited to him as forbidden relatives, he is still permitted to marry her near relatives.<sup><xref rid="fn1147">35</xref></sup> [For instance,] he who had intercourse with a married woman is permitted to marry her daughter.</p>
<p label="6.">This is the question which R. Jose b. Taddai of Tiberias put to Rabban Gamaliel: If I, who may cohabit with my wife, am prohibited from marrying her daughter, how much more should I be prohibited from marrying the daughter of a married woman, seeing that I am prohibited from cohabiting with her&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn1148">36</xref></sup> He replied to him: Go and provide me [a wife] for the High Priest of whom it is written, <italic>A virgin of his own people shall he take to wife</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1149">37</xref></sup> and I will provide you [with wives] for Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn1150">38</xref></sup> Another explanation<sup><xref rid="fn1151">39</xref></sup> [in refutation of the reasoning is that] we do not use an <italic>a fortiori</italic> argument to abrogate a specific law of Scripture.<sup><xref rid="fn1152">40</xref></sup> Rabban Gamaliel excommunicated him.<sup><xref rid="fn1153">41</xref></sup></p>
<p label="7.">If a man cohabits with any woman forbidden him as incest, he does not thereby disqualify her from marrying a <italic>kohen</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1154">42</xref></sup> [If a <italic>kohen</italic> cohabits with his wife when she is] <italic>niddah</italic>, although he is liable to a penalty for the intercourse,<sup><xref rid="fn1155">43</xref></sup> the child [who is conceived] is qualified to stand and offer sacrifices upon the altar.<sup><xref rid="fn1156">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>A woman who had intercourse with that which is not a human being,<sup><xref rid="fn1157">45</xref></sup> although she is in consequence subject to the penalty of <italic>kareth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1158">46</xref></sup> she is not disqualified from marrying a <italic>kohen</italic>. R. Jose said: It once happened at Haitali<sup><xref rid="fn1159">47</xref></sup> that while a young woman was cleaning the floor<sup><xref rid="fn1160">48</xref></sup> a gorilla<sup><xref rid="fn1161">49</xref></sup> came and covered her from the rear. When the case came before the Sages, they did not disqualify her from marrying a <italic>kohen</italic>.</p>
<p label="8.">The following are the forbidden relatives in the second degree: his father&#x2019;s mother, his mother&#x2019;s mother,<sup><xref rid="fn1162">50</xref></sup> the wife of his mother&#x2019;s father, the wife of his father&#x2019;s father,<sup><xref rid="fn1163">51</xref></sup> the wife of his son&#x2019;s son, the wife of his daughter&#x2019;s son, the wife of a father&#x2019;s maternal brother, the wife of a mother&#x2019;s paternal brother. Bar &#x1E32;appara adds the mother of his father&#x2019;s father and the mother of his mother&#x2019;s father. The wife of his father&#x2019;s brother is forbidden to him<sup><xref rid="fn1164">52</xref></sup> but the daughter [his cousin] is permitted to him; his father&#x2019;s brother is permitted to marry his<sup><xref rid="fn1165">53</xref></sup> wife or his daughter; the wife of his mother&#x2019;s brother is forbidden to him but his daughter is permitted to him. His mother&#x2019;s brother is permitted to marry [the nephew&#x2019;s] wife or daughter.</p>
<p>A man is permitted to marry the wife of his father-in-law<sup><xref rid="fn1166">54</xref></sup> and the wife of his son-in-law, but the Sages said that the wife of his father-in-law is not permitted to him because of appearance&#x2019;s sake; [the mother-in-law&#x2019;s] daughter is permitted to him.<sup><xref rid="fn1167">55</xref></sup> A man may not marry the daughter of his stepson,<sup><xref rid="fn1168">56</xref></sup> but [the stepson&#x2019;s] wife is permitted to him. His stepson is permitted to marry [the stepfather&#x2019;s] wife and daughter. A man may marry the wife of his brother&#x2019;s son and the wife of his sister&#x2019;s son.<sup><xref rid="fn1169">57</xref></sup></p>
<p label="9.">If a man remarried his divorced wife after her marriage [with a second husband who subsequently died or divorced her], he may not cohabit with her, neither may a levir marry her [if her husband died childless].<sup><xref rid="fn1170">58</xref></sup> The wife of a fit man who has a brother who is crushed in his privy parts<sup><xref rid="fn1171">59</xref></sup> is permitted to her husband but is prohibited to the levir.<sup><xref rid="fn1172">60</xref></sup> The rival<sup><xref rid="fn1173">61</xref></sup> of a <italic>so&#x1E6D;ah</italic> is permitted to her husband but forbidden to the levir.<sup><xref rid="fn1174">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>A man who married a sister of his brother&#x2019;s divorced wife or a sister of his brother&#x2019;s <italic>&#x1E25;alu&#x1E93;ah</italic>, [though this sister] is permitted to her husband she is forbidden to the levir [if her husband died childless].</p>
<p>The wife of a man crushed in his privy parts who has a fit brother, though forbidden to her husband,<sup><xref rid="fn1175">63</xref></sup> is permitted to the levir. A <italic>so&#x1E6D;ah</italic> is forbidden both to the husband and to the levir.<sup><xref rid="fn1176">64</xref></sup> A <italic>&#x1E25;alu&#x1E93;ah</italic> is likewise forbidden to both. The wife of a man crushed in his privy parts whose brother is similarly maimed is forbidden to both.</p>
<p label="10.">A female proselyte, captive woman, freed woman,<sup><xref rid="fn1177">65</xref></sup> the widow of one who was of mixed family,<sup><xref rid="fn1178">66</xref></sup> a <italic>so&#x1E6D;ah</italic>, [56<italic>a</italic>] <italic>&#x1E25;alu&#x1E93;ah</italic>, divorcee and a <italic>&#x1E25;alalah</italic> are unfit to marry a <italic>kohen</italic>. If they were married to a lay-Israelite, the daughters [of the union] are fit to marry a <italic>kohen</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1179">67</xref></sup></p>
<p label="11.">He who cohabits with a maidservant is liable to the penalty for transgressing fourteen negative commands and also to the penalty of <italic>kareth</italic> at the hand of Heaven, viz.: <italic>Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1180">68</xref></sup> <italic>Thou shalt not sow thy field with two kinds of seed;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1181">69</xref></sup> <italic>Neither shall there come upon thee a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1182">70</xref></sup> <italic>Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with two kinds of seed;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1183">71</xref></sup> <italic>Thou shalt not plough</italic> [<italic>with an ox and an ass together</italic>];<sup><xref rid="fn1184">72</xref></sup> <italic>Thou shalt not wear a mingled stuff;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1185">73</xref></sup> <italic>Thou shalt not commit adultery;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1186">74</xref></sup> <italic>Thou shalt not covet;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1187">75</xref></sup> <italic>And thou shalt not lie with any beast;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1188">76</xref></sup> <italic>Neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1189">77</xref></sup> also one on account of [laws concerning] a non-Jewish maidservant, a harlot, a <italic>niddah</italic> and a heathen woman.

<p label="12.">Who marries a wife fitting for him;<sup><xref rid="fn1192">80</xref></sup> Elijah kisses and the Holy One, blessed be He, loves him; but who takes a wife who is not fitting for him, Elijah binds and the Holy One, blessed be He, lashes him.<sup><xref rid="fn1193">81</xref></sup> Woe to him who disqualifies his seed, blemishes his family and takes to wife one who is not fit for him.

<ftnote id="fn1115">(3) Cf. Lev. XVIII, 18.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1116">(4) The law applies to all the seven relatives. The three are mentioned probably because one might have thought that, on account of their close relationship, his wife would in such a circumstance be forbidden to him. Cf. Yeb. 94b-95a (Sonc. ed., pp. 643ff.).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1117">(5) Cf. Deut. XXII, 23-27.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1118">(6) Num. V, 13, E.V. <italic>neither she be taken in the act.</italic> The phrase is interpreted by the Rabbis in the sense that she did not act under compulsion but willingly, referring to a married woman who was defiled secretly without witnesses to testify against her.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1119">(7) i.e. violated by force.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1120">(8) Cf. Yeb. 56b (Sonc. ed., p. 378), Keth. 51b (Sonc. ed., p. 298).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1121">(9) According to R. Ishmael there is no distinction between the wife of a <italic>kohen</italic> and a lay-Israelite in the case of rape.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1122">(10) If, e.g., a condition were attached to the betrothal that remained unfulfilled. In such a case the woman may leave her husband without a <italic>ge&#x1E6D;</italic>, and in any subsequent intercourse, whether forced or willing, her status is that of an unmarried woman who had never been previously married. The passage within brackets is added by GRA and is necessary, otherwise R. Ishmael would be contradicting himself. Cf. Yeb. 100b (Sonc. ed., p. 692), Keth. <italic>loc. cit.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1123">(11) If her second husband subsequently died or divorced her. She is, however, permitted to remarry her former husband after betrothal alone, where no marriage with the second man took place and he died.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1124">(12) This is the reading of GRA as against V and H, who name R. Ishmael as the authority.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1125">(13) Deut. XXIV, 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1126">(14) If she was legally married to the second husband the term <italic>defiled</italic> is inapplicable.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1127">(15) Of the divorcee who became betrothed and was then seduced. This is the reading of GRA. V and H have &#x2018;the wife of a <italic>kohen&#x2019;</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1128">(16) So GRA. V and H &#x2018;to him&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1129">(17) V and H insert here &#x2018;and this is the reasoning by which R. Jose b. &#x1E32;ippar expounded in the name of R. Eleazar b. Shammua&#x2018;&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1130">(18) Such an unlawful marriage is regarded merely as harlotry, and we do not fear lest people infer that a married woman may leave her husband and remarry without a <italic>ge&#x1E6D;</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1131">(19) Whom he married after he had been told that his wife, who had gone overseas, was dead.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1132">(20) Whom he married on the evidence that his brother (the woman&#x2019;s husband) was dead but later returned. The requirement of a divorce in these cases is only a preventive measure against the possibility of assuming that the second marriage was legal, and hence inferring that a married woman may leave her husband to marry another without a <italic>ge&#x1E6D;</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1133">(21) Whose husband was reported by one witness to be dead and she remarried with the sanction of a <italic>Beth Din</italic> who accepted the evidence, and later the husband returned. In such a case the woman requires a divorce from her second husband as a preventive measure against the possibility of assuming that the first had divorced her and the second had married her legally, and consequently a married woman may leave her husband without a <italic>ge&#x1E6D;.</italic> Cf. Yeb. 94b (Sonc. ed., p. 641).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1134">(22) lit. &#x2018;a permission after their prohibition&#x2019;; e.g. by the death of his wife, by the death of his brother and by being divorced.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1137">(25) From his marriage. Such a child cannot be counted as belonging to the community. The reading of GRA is followed.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1141">(29) <italic>ibid.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1142">(30) A descendant of the Gibeonites; cf. Josh. IX, 27.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1143">(31) Cuthean (Samaritan) was probably substituted from fear of the censor for an original <italic>go&#x00EF;</italic> (heathen).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1144">(32) One unfit for the priesthood on account of his father&#x2019;s illegitimacy.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1145">(33) To marry even a <italic>kohen.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1146">(34) This is in accordance with the opinion of R. Dosethai b. Judah in &#x1E32;id. 77a (Sonc. ed., p. 395), who maintained that as the sons of Israel are a <italic>mi&#x1E33;weh</italic> of purification for <italic>&#x1E25;alaloth</italic>, so are the daughters a <italic>mi&#x1E33;weh</italic> of purification for <italic>&#x1E25;alalim</italic>, so that their issue is eligible for the priesthood. The Mishnah (<italic>ibid.</italic>) states: The daughter of a <italic>&#x1E25;alal</italic> is unfit to the priesthood for all time.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1147">(35) Only relatives of a married wife are subject to the law of incest.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1148">(36) The purpose of this <italic>a fortiori</italic> argument is to point out that one should not be allowed to marry anyone except the daughter of a widow or of a divorcee, because these are no longer a man&#x2019;s wife.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1149">(37) Lev. XXI, 14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1150">(38) Since a High Priest may not marry a widow or a divorcee, their daughters also ought to be prohibited according to R. Jose&#x2019;s argument, and this would be contrary to the Scriptural text. Hence the reasoning must be fallacious. The premise is false, viz. that he is permitted to cohabit with his wife who was the daughter of a married woman.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1151">(39) The Yal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D; omits the words &#x2018;another explanation&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1152">(40) It is explicitly stated, <italic>He shall take to wife</italic>, but if we adopt R. Jose&#x2019;s argument, a High Priest could never marry.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1153">(41) The Yal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D; omits this sentence.</ftnote>

<Title>CHAPTER III</Title>
<p label="1.">Ben &#x2018;Azzai said: Whoever sets the following four things [constantly] before his eyes and upon his heart will never commit a sin: Whence he came, whither he goes, Who is his Judge and what he is destined to become. Whence he came? From a place of darkness. Whither he goes? To a place of thick darkness. [Another reading:] Whence he came? From a place of uncleanness. Whither he goes? To cause others to be unclean.<sup><xref rid="fn1276">1</xref></sup> [Another reading:] Whence he came? From a fetid drop and from a place which no person is able to behold.<sup><xref rid="fn1277">2</xref></sup> Whither he goes? To the nether-world to be judged in Gehinnom<sup><xref rid="fn1278">3</xref></sup> and burnt in fire. And Who is his Judge? He must realize that his Judge is not of flesh and blood but the Lord of all works, blessed be He, with Whom there is no injustice, forgetfulness, respect of persons or taking of bribes. What is he destined to become? A worm and maggot; as it is stated, <italic>How much less man, that is a worm&#x0021; and the son of man, that is a maggot&#x0021;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1279">4</xref></sup></p>
<p label="2.">R. Simeon said: A man is [full of] worms during his life and [full of] maggots when dead. He is full of worms during life&#x2014;i.e. vermin, and full of maggots when dead&#x2014;i.e. what swarms when he is dead.<sup><xref rid="fn1280">5</xref></sup></p>
<p label="3.">R. Eleazar b. Jacob said: Man is comely and praiseworthy but emits an ugly expression from his mouth. To what can this be compared? To a large salon in the middle of which a tannary pipe was fixed. So is man: if now when he discharges excrement from his bowels he prides himself over other creatures, should he emit from his bowels foliatum,<sup><xref rid="fn1281">6</xref></sup> balsam or any other kind of aromatic spice, how much more would he pride himself over other creatures&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn1282">7</xref></sup></p>
<p label="4.">Shortly before R. Eleazar b. Azariah died, his disciples went in to visit him.<sup><xref rid="fn1283">8</xref></sup> They sat in front of him and said, &#x2018;Master, teach us the ways of life&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn1284">9</xref></sup> He said to them, &#x2018;My sons, what can I teach you? Go and let each of you be solicitous for the honour of his colleague; and when you stand up to pray, know before Whom you stand and pray; for on that account you will [be worthy to] enter into the life of the World to Come&#x2019;.</p>
<p label="5.">Five things we learnt from R. Eliezer at the time of his death, and we had greater joy over what we then learnt than over what he taught us during his life.<sup><xref rid="fn1285">10</xref></sup> They are: a ball, a shoe-last, an amulet, <italic>tefillin</italic> and a cushion can become unclean, and [if unclean] may be immersed just as they are.<sup><xref rid="fn1286">11</xref></sup> Go and pay due regard to them, because they are important ordinances which were told to Moses on Mount Sinai.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1276">(1) The human body, when dead, causes ritual defilement.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1277">(2) The womb.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1278">(3) So GRA. V and H read &#x2018;and Abaddon&#x2019;, a name for the nether-world.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1279">(4) Job XXV, 6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1280">(5) Another possible interpretation is that he feels the bite of maggots even when he is dead; cf. Shab. 13b (Sonc. ed., p. 54), &#x2018;Worms are as painful to the dead as a needle in the flesh of the living&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1281">(6) An ointment or oil prepared from the leaves of spikenard.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1283">(8) Cf. Ber. 28b (Sonc. ed., p. 173).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1284">(9) So GRA. V has &#x2018;only one subject&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1285">(10) They rejoiced because his teaching was accepted. The laws which he taught in his lifetime were rejected since he had been excommunicated. After his death the ban was lifted.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1286">(11) For the explanation of this teaching, cf. ARN XIX, p. 108, n. 6. Instead of &#x2018;as they are&#x2019; another reading is <italic>bemashehu</italic>, i.e. in a small quantity of water and not the full measure of forty <italic>se&#x2019;ah.</italic></ftnote>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER IV</title>
<p label="1.">You should always be pleasant on entering and leaving [a house]. Spend less time on business and occupy yourself with [the study of] the Torah. It once happened that R. Simeon b. Eleazar<sup><xref rid="fn1287">1</xref></sup> was coming from Migdal Eder<sup><xref rid="fn1288">2</xref></sup> from the house of his teacher and was riding leisurely on his ass by the seaside.<sup><xref rid="fn1289">3</xref></sup> A certain man<sup><xref rid="fn1290">4</xref></sup> chanced to meet him, who was exceedingly ugly. He said to him, &#x2018;Ra&#x1E33;a,<sup><xref rid="fn1291">5</xref></sup> how ugly are the children of Abraham our father&#x0021;&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1292">6</xref></sup> The other replied, &#x2018;What can I do for you? Speak to the Craftsman Who made me&#x2019;. R. Simeon b. Eleazar immediately dismounted from the ass, prostrated himself before him<sup><xref rid="fn1293">7</xref></sup> and said to him, &#x2018;I apologize to you, forgive me&#x2019;. He replied to him, &#x2018;I will not forgive you until you go to the Craftsman Who made me and say to Him, &#x201C;How ugly is the vessel which You have made&#x0021;&#x201D; &#x2019; R. Simeon walked behind him for three <italic>mil</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1294">8</xref></sup> When his fellow-citizens heard [of his arrival] they came out to meet him, greeting him with the words, &#x2018;Peace be upon you, Rabbi&#x2019;. The man said to them, &#x2018;Whom are you calling Rabbi?&#x2019; They answered, &#x2018;He who is walking behind you&#x2019;. Thereupon he exclaimed, &#x2018;If this man be a Rabbi, may there not be any more like him in Israel&#x0021;&#x2019; He told them the whole story. They earnestly begged him to pardon him, and he replied, &#x2018;I will forgive him, but only on condition that he does not act<sup><xref rid="fn1295">9</xref></sup> in the same manner again&#x2019;.</p>
<p>That same day R. Simeon sat and expounded in his great Academy: Be always pliable like the reed and not unyielding like the cedar. In the case of a reed, though the four winds of the world were to blow upon it, the reed bends with them, and when the winds drop, it remains standing in its place, with the result that one is able to make a pen of it to write a scroll of the Torah. But the cedar is not like that: if the east, north [or] west wind blows upon it, it cannot move it from its place; but as soon as the south wind blows upon it, it uproots it and the result is that people come and cut it up,<sup><xref rid="fn1296">10</xref></sup> chop it and use it for building houses, and what is left is used for firewood. Therefore the Sages said: Be always pliable like the reed and not unyielding like the cedar.<sup><xref rid="fn1297">11</xref></sup></p>
<p label="2.">How does one honour his teacher? When they are both walking along the way, he must place himself at his<sup><xref rid="fn1298">12</xref></sup> left hand and not at his right. If three [were walking together] and a Sage or a teacher was among them, the teacher is to be in the middle, the more important of the other two on his right and the less important on his left. We find it so in connection with the three angels who came to Abraham our father, viz. Gabriel, Michael and Raphael. Gabriel came to overthrow Sodom and Gomorrah, Raphael came to heal Abraham<sup><xref rid="fn1299">13</xref></sup> and Michael came to announce to Sarah [that she would have a son]. Michael was in the middle, Gabriel on his right and Raphael on his left.<sup><xref rid="fn1300">14</xref></sup> When Abraham our father saw the Ministering Angels, the Divine Presence appeared and stood over him. He said to them, &#x2018;Sires, wait until I take leave of the Divine Presence, which is greater than you&#x2019;, as it is stated, <italic>And he said: My lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1301">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Abraham our father had taken leave of the Divine Presence, he came, bowed to them and led them beneath the tree, as it is stated, <italic>Let now a little water be fetched, and wash your feet</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1302">16</xref></sup> and afterwards [it is written], <italic>And I will fetch a morsel of bread</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1303">17</xref></sup> But [when the angels came] to Lot, what did he say? <italic>And tarry all night, and wash your feet</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1304">18</xref></sup> Others say: Lot spoke to them [in this manner] only as a clever device. He said [to himself], &#x2018;If [the men of Sodom] find them with their faces, hands and feet already washed, the result will be that they will kill me, my wife and my daughters.<sup><xref rid="fn1305">19</xref></sup> Let them, therefore, find them with the dust still on their feet, and they will think that they have only just arrived&#x2019;.</p>
<p label="3.">He who walks behind his teacher may not leave him without first obtaining his permission. If they were both equal in learning, the host enters [the house] first and then the guest, but when leaving the guest goes out first and the host leaves last.<sup><xref rid="fn1306">20</xref></sup> He who is about to leave the company of his fellow,<sup><xref rid="fn1307">21</xref></sup> whether he be greater than he or not, must say to him, &#x2018;I am leaving&#x2019;.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1287">(1) Others read &#x2018;R. Eleazar b. R. Simeon&#x2019;. But the story here related is more befitting the character of his son, R. Simeon. Cf. B.M. 85a (Sonc. ed., p. 487).</ftnote>

Abraham had mistaken the angels for Arabs, who worship the dust of their feet and, being anxious not to introduce idolatry in any form into his house, he asked them to wash their feet first. Lot, however, who had no such anxiety, offered them a night&#x2019;s lodging before asking them to wash their feet. Others, who give the interpretation which follows in the text, maintain that Lot also was anxious that they should first wash their feet, a custom he had learnt from Abraham; but the reason that he told them to stay the night before washing was to deceive the people of Sodom.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1305">(19) For not reporting their arrival earlier.</ftnote>

<p label="1.">A person should never leave [the company of his teacher or even] his fellow unless he had previously obtained his consent. All can learn such good manners from the All-present, Who said, as it were, to Abraham, &#x2018;I am now leaving&#x2019;, as it is stated, <italic>And the Lord went His way</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1308">1</xref></sup> <italic>as soon as He had left off speaking to Abraham; and Abraham returned unto his place</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1309">2</xref></sup></p>

<p>The story is told of the four Sages, viz. Rabban Gamaliel, R. Joshua, R. Eleazar b. Azariah and R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba, who were on their way to attend a Privy Council<sup><xref rid="fn1313">6</xref></sup> which also included a certain philosopher as a member. R. Joshua said to Rabban Gamaliel, &#x2018;Master, would you like us to call on our companion the philosopher?&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1314">7</xref></sup> He replied, &#x2018;No&#x2019;. In the morning he again asked him, &#x2018;Master, would you like us to call on our companion the philosopher?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;Yes&#x2019;. R. Joshua went and knocked on the door. The philosopher thought and said [to himself], &#x2018;This can only be the manners of a Sage&#x2019;. [When he knocked] a second time, [the philosopher] got up and washed his face, hands and feet. On the third knock he arose and opened the door and saw the Sages of Israel coming all together.<sup><xref rid="fn1315">8</xref></sup> Rabban Gamaliel was in the middle, R. Joshua and R. Eleazar b. Azariah on his right and R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba on his left.</p>
<p>The philosopher was meditating and saying [to himself], &#x2018;How shall I greet these Sages of Israel? If I say, &#x201C;Peace be upon you, Rabban Gamaliel&#x201D;, I shall be guilty of derogatory conduct towards the [other] Sages. If I say, &#x201C;Peace be upon you, Sages of Israel&#x201D;, that would be an insult to Rabban Gamaliel&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn1316">9</xref></sup> As soon as he approached them, he greeted them with the words, &#x2018;Peace be upon you, Sages of Israel, headed by Rabban Gamaliel&#x2019;.</p>
<p>(We learn [this rule of etiquette] not from [this story of] Rabban Gamaliel but from the Divine Presence, as it is stated, <italic>I saw the Lord sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right hand and on His left</italic>.)<sup><xref rid="fn1317">10</xref></sup></p>
<p label="3.">Always let all people [who visit you] be regarded by you as robbers, but show them the same respect as to Rabban Gamaliel. The story is told of R. Joshua on whom a certain person called early in the morning. He gave him food and drink, and took him up to the loft to sleep and then removed the ladder from under him. What did that man do? He arose in the middle of the night, collected the vessels<sup><xref rid="fn1318">11</xref></sup> and wrapped them up in his cloak. As soon as he started to descend,<sup><xref rid="fn1319">12</xref></sup> he fell from the loft and broke his neck. When morning came, R. Joshua rose early and found him where he had fallen. He said to him, &#x2018;Ra&#x1E33;a&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn1320">13</xref></sup> do all persons act as you have?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;Master, I did not know that you had removed the ladder from under me&#x2019;.

When he pressed them to eat and drink, they vowed by the Torah that they would neither eat nor drink, but later they partook of food and drink. When the time came for them to depart he used to flagellate them. This matter came to the notice of Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Zakkai and the Sages who were angered by it. They said, &#x2018;Who will go and inform us [of his action]?&#x2019; R. Joshua replied, &#x2018;I will go and see how he conducts himself&#x2019;.</p>
<p>He went and found him at the entrance of his house and greeted him, &#x2018;Peace be upon you, Master&#x2019;. The other replied, &#x2018;Peace be upon you, Master and Teacher&#x2019;. He said, &#x2018;I need a lodging&#x2019;. The other replied, &#x2018;Lodge here in peace&#x2019;. They sat down and occupied themselves in the study of the Torah until evening. In the morning [R.

He then said, &#x2018;Who will accompany me [on my way back]?&#x2019; The other replied, &#x2018;I will&#x2019;. R. Joshua was then meditating and saying [to himself], &#x2018;What can I report to the Sages who sent me [to institute inquiries]?&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1324">3</xref></sup> He then turned [to look] back. [R. Simeon] asked him, &#x2018;Master, why did you turn to look behind you?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;I have something to ask you. Why did you flagellate other guests who stayed with you and me you did not flagellate?&#x2019; He said to him, &#x2018;Master, you are a great Sage and you have good manners. The persons who stay with me I usually press to eat, but they vow by the Torah [not to eat] and transgress [their vow]; and so have I heard from the mouth of the Sages that whoever vows by the Torah and breaks his vow has to be given forty lashes&#x2019;. He said to him, &#x2018;May Heaven bless you for what you have done. By your life and by the life of your head&#x0021; Whoever behaves in this manner, give him the forty lashes on your account [57<italic>a</italic>] and [another] forty on account of the Sages who sent me&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn1325">4</xref></sup> R. Joshua returned and reported to the Sages what he had witnessed while he was with Simeon b. An&#x1E6D;ipa&#x1E6D;ros.</p>
<p label="2.">A man should never be fastidious concerning his meals. It once happened that Hillel the Elder had a certain man to a meal, when a poor person came and stood at his door and said, &#x2018;I am to marry today and have no provisions at all&#x2019;. Hillel&#x2019;s wife took the entire meal [which she had prepared] and gave it to him. She then kneaded fresh dough, cooked another dinner and placed it before them. He said to her, &#x2018;My dear, why did you not bring it to us sooner?&#x2019; She told him all that had happened. He said to her, &#x2018;My dear, I, too, did not judge you in the scale of guilt but in the scale of merit, because everything you did was only in the name of Heaven&#x2019;.</p>
<p label="3.">We do not leave over a portion of the food in a stew-pot, but we should leave over a portion of the food in the dish.<sup><xref rid="fn1326">5</xref></sup> It once happened that R. Joshua was the guest of a certain widow who served him with a dish of beans. He ate without leaving any. On the second occasion he also ate without leaving any. On the third occasion she over-seasoned it with salt; and as soon as R. Joshua tasted it he withdrew his hand from it and ate his bread dry. She asked, &#x2018;Why did you withdraw your hand from the pounded beans?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;I had already eaten earlier in the day&#x2019;. She said to him, &#x2018;You should then have withdrawn your hand also from the bread&#x2019;. &#x2018;Perhaps,&#x2019; she continued, &#x2018;you left [the dish today] as compensation for the former meals&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn1327">6</xref></sup> But have not the Sages said: We do not leave over a portion of the food in the stew-pot but we should leave over a portion of the food in the dish&#x0021;&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1328">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hence R. Joshua said, &#x2018;No one has ever had the better of me except this woman, a little boy and a little girl&#x2019;. What was the incident with the little girl? Once R. Joshua was walking in a field when he met a little girl who called out to him, &#x2018;Why are you walking across the field?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;I am walking along a [trodden] path&#x2019;. &#x2018;Robbers like yourself,&#x2019; she retorted, &#x2018;have trodden it down.&#x2019; What was the incident with the little boy? Once R. Joshua was on a journey and came across a little boy sitting at a cross-road. He asked him, &#x2018;My son, by which road will I be able to go to the town, by this one or by that?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;Both of them are before you; but this one is long and short and that one is short and long&#x2019;. [He proceeded along the short but long road.] When he approached the city&#x2019;s wall, he found that it was surrounded by gardens and orchards, and turned back. Noticing the same little boy sitting where he had left him, he said, &#x2018;My son, why did you play a trick on me? Did you not tell me that this road was short?&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1329">8</xref></sup> &#x2018;Master,&#x2019; he retorted, &#x2018;you are a great Sage and this is your wisdom? Did I not tell you that it is long?&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1330">9</xref></sup> R. Joshua went and kissed him upon his head and exclaimed, &#x2018;Happy are you, O Israel, for all of you are wise, both young and old&#x2019;.</p>
<p label="4.">How does one dance before a bride?<sup><xref rid="fn1331">10</xref></sup> Beth Shammai said, &#x2018;The bride as she is&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn1332">11</xref></sup> Beth Hillel said, &#x2018;Beautiful and graceful bride&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn1333">12</xref></sup> Beth Shammai said to Beth Hillel, &#x2018;According to your view, if she were lame or blind one still has to call her &#x201C;beautiful and graceful bride&#x201D;, but the Torah has declared, <italic>Keep thee far from a false matter&#x0021;</italic>&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1334">13</xref></sup> Beth Hillel replied to Beth Shammai, &#x2018;If one has made a bad purchase in the market, should one praise it in his eyes or depreciate it? Surely one should praise it in his eyes&#x2019;. Therefore the Sages said: The disposition of man should always be pleasant with people.</p>
<p label="5.">One should break off a piece of bread<sup><xref rid="fn1335">14</xref></sup> only from the part that is baked to a crust and not from the soft part;<sup><xref rid="fn1336">15</xref></sup> neither should one hold in his hand a piece [of bread] as big as an egg,<sup><xref rid="fn1337">16</xref></sup> because one who acts in this manner is a glutton and a tippler, neither should a man drink his goblet of wine in one draught, and if he did so he is a tippler and a glutton. How many pauses should he make before drinking it up? [If he drinks it] in two draughts he shows good manners; in three he is of the arrogant.</p>
<p>A man should not begin to eat leek or onion from the top side but from the leaves, and if he did eat it so he is a glutton and a tippler. He should not drink two goblets for reciting Grace after meals because it makes him appear like a tippler.<sup><xref rid="fn1338">17</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1322">(1) Some eds. add: &#x2018;providing it is a thing permitted to be done&#x2019;. Cf. Pes. 86b (Sonc. ed., p. 456, n. 6) where the margin adds &#x2018;except depart&#x2019;. This is probably meant humorously&#x2014;a guest should not outstay his welcome until he is told to go&#x0021; Others read <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05E6;&#x05D0;</span> for <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D3;&#x05D0;</span> &#x2018;except a forbidden thing&#x2019;, which harmonizes with the addition in our text.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1326">(5) The text is emended by GRA to agree with &#x2018;Erub. 53b (Sonc. ed., p. 373). Cf. also Midrash Lamentations I (Sonc. ed., p. 85). V and H insert &#x2018;not&#x2019; in the second instead of the first clause. When food is poured from the pot into the dish, none should be left over in the pot for the servant; but when the contents of the dish are ladled into the plates, some must be left in the dish for him.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1331">(10) What does one recite or sing in praise of a bride?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1332">(11) One should not exaggerate, and if she is obviously not beautiful one should not say that she is.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1338">(17) Cf. Ber. 51b (Sonc. ed., p. 310) where the reason given is connected with &#x2018;pairs&#x2019;, alluding to the idea that even numbers are unlucky and cause a person to come under the influence of evil spirits. Our text, however, can be explained in accordance with Pes. 110b (Sonc. ed., pp. 568f.) where it states that in Palestine they are not particular about &#x2018;pairs&#x2019;; it is nevertheless forbidden for the reason given here.</ftnote>

<p label="1.">When two sit at one table, the senior of them puts forth his hand first<sup><xref rid="fn1339">1</xref></sup> and then the junior; if the junior puts forth [his hand first] he is a glutton.</p>
<p label="2.">The story is told of R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba who prepared a meal for his disciples. They<sup><xref rid="fn1340">2</xref></sup> served them with two dishes, one raw and the other cooked. First they served them with raw foods. The bright [pupil] among them took hold of the stalk with one hand and with the other tried to break a piece off, and when it did not come off he withdrew his hands from it and ate his bread dry.<sup><xref rid="fn1341">3</xref></sup> The foolish [pupil], however, took hold of the stalk in one hand and bit into it with his teeth. R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said to him, &#x2018;Not so, my son; place your heel on it in the plate&#x0021;&#x2019; After that a cooked dish was served to them, of which they ate their fill. Then [R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba] said to them, &#x2018;My sons, I only did this to test whether you have good manners or not&#x2019;.</p>
<p label="3.">A man should begin his mealtime at the fourth hour of the day<sup><xref rid="fn1342">4</xref></sup> and enter the bath-house only at the fourth hour of the day.<sup><xref rid="fn1343">5</xref></sup></p>

<p>It is related of R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba that he went into a privy behind R. Joshua to watch his behaviour. He noticed that he entered the privy only on the side, exposed himself<sup><xref rid="fn1348">10</xref></sup> only after he had sat down, and wiped himself only with the left hand. What is the reason that we do not wipe with the right hand? R. Eliezer said: Because one eats with it. R. Joshua said: Because one writes<sup><xref rid="fn1349">11</xref></sup> with it.

<p label="1.">A guest should not say to his host, &#x2018;Serve me that I may eat&#x2019;, but [must wait] until he is invited to eat. If they poured out a goblet [of wine] for him he must drink it with pauses.<sup><xref rid="fn1352">1</xref></sup> How many pauses should he make? In the case of warm [beverages] three and with cold four. R. Judah said: This applies only to goblets of Galilee,<sup><xref rid="fn1353">2</xref></sup> but with goblets used in Judah<sup><xref rid="fn1354">3</xref></sup> he drinks with as many pauses as he likes.<sup><xref rid="fn1355">4</xref></sup></p>
<p label="2.">A man should not say to his fellow, &#x2018;Come and eat [with me in return] for the food you gave me&#x2019;, because this is a kind of usury.<sup><xref rid="fn1356">5</xref></sup> In Jerusalem, however, they used to exchange invitations one with another.<sup><xref rid="fn1357">6</xref></sup></p>
<p label="3.">A man should not send to his fellow a barrel of wine and put oil at its mouth,<sup><xref rid="fn1358">7</xref></sup> because this may lead to fatal consequences. It once happened that a man arranged a banquet in honour of his son; when his guests arrived and sat down at the table, he went to get the oil.<sup><xref rid="fn1359">8</xref></sup> When he discovered that the barrel was full of wine he strangled himself and died.<sup><xref rid="fn1360">9</xref></sup> Hence the Sages said: A man should not send to his fellow a barrel of wine and put oil at its mouth, because it may lead to fatal consequences.</p>
<p label="4.">A man should not say to his fellow, &#x2018;Take oil&#x2019; from an empty jar,<sup><xref rid="fn1361">10</xref></sup> because the latter would be grateful to him without cause.<sup><xref rid="fn1362">11</xref></sup> A man should not urge his fellow to dine with him knowing that he will not do so; and he should not offer him many gifts when he knows that he will not accept them.</p>
<p label="5.">A man should not pass off new wine for old<sup><xref rid="fn1363">12</xref></sup> when giving his friend a drink because that is a kind of robbery. If he was giving drink to ass-drivers, he may not say to them, &#x2018;Take away this man&#x2019;s cup and pass it to someone else&#x2019; because this is a kind of robbery.<sup><xref rid="fn1364">13</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn1360">(9) From shame, since he had nothing else prepared to set before his guests.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1361">(10) When he knows that the man will not do so.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1362">(11) He gains the gratitude of the man through something which he had no intention of doing. This is the reason in all the cases mentioned.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1363">(12) So GRA. V reverses the adjectives. H omits this sentence.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1364">(13) The suggestion is that he had had his drink when he had not.</ftnote>

A man should not bite off a piece of bread and return it to the plate; similarly he should not bite off a piece of bread and give it to his fellow, because not all tastes are alike. He should also not drink from a cup and hand it to his fellow because of danger to life.<sup><xref rid="fn1369">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Once R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba was staying at the inn of a certain man who handed him a goblet of wine from which he had already drunk.

<p>A man should not drink his goblet and place it upon the table; but he should retain it until the waiter comes and then hand it to him.<sup><xref rid="fn1373">7</xref></sup></p>
<p label="3.">Rabbi [Judah the Prince] said the following five things [concerning bread]: we may not place raw meat on bread,<sup><xref rid="fn1374">8</xref></sup> we may not pass a cup [full of wine] or a plate [of soup] over bread, we may not throw bread, we may not rest a dish on bread and we may not sit on articles of food because it would crush them.<sup><xref rid="fn1375">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>A guest may not take his portion and give it to the attendant, lest something untoward happen to [the rest of] the meal;<sup><xref rid="fn1376">10</xref></sup> but he should take [his portion], keep it in front of him and later hand it to the attendant.</p>
<p>Guests may not give anything [from what is set before them] to the host&#x2019;s son or to his servant or deputy unless they have received the host&#x2019;s permission to do so. It once happened that in a time of scarcity a man invited three guests to his house and only had three eggs<sup><xref rid="fn1377">11</xref></sup> which he set before them. When the host&#x2019;s child entered and stood before them, one of the guests took his portion and gave it to him; the second guest did the same and so did the third. When the father came in and saw him with one egg in his mouth and holding two in his hands, he picked him up to his full height and flung him to the ground so that he died. When the mother saw her child dead she got up from [her seat] upon the roof<sup><xref rid="fn1378">12</xref></sup> and threw herself down and died. On seeing this, the father also stood on the roof and threw himself down and died. R. Eliezer b. Jacob said: Because of this three souls perished.</p>

<p label="2.">Who enters a bath-house should not knead<sup><xref rid="fn1387">9</xref></sup> or scrape<sup><xref rid="fn1388">10</xref></sup> or urinate on the marble floor.<sup><xref rid="fn1389">11</xref></sup> It once happened that they begged Rabban Gamaliel, who was weak, to urinate on the marble floor but he refused.<sup><xref rid="fn1390">12</xref></sup> Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel said: He who urinates on the marble floor is the companion of an ass, and he who eats in the street is like a dog; some say that he is unfit to give evidence.<sup><xref rid="fn1391">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the case of a privy he who is inside must give way<sup><xref rid="fn1392">14</xref></sup> to him who enters;<sup><xref rid="fn1393">15</xref></sup> but in the case of a bath-house he who is about to enter must give way<sup><xref rid="fn1394">16</xref></sup> to him who is inside.<sup><xref rid="fn1395">17</xref></sup> One may not bring into the bath-house oil in a glass vessel because of danger.<sup><xref rid="fn1396">18</xref></sup> One may not spit in a bath-house because of danger.<sup><xref rid="fn1397">19</xref></sup> One may not spit anywhere in the presence of others.</p>
<p label="3.">One may cite the rules appertaining to a privy in a privy and the rules appertaining to a bath-house in a bath-house.<sup><xref rid="fn1398">20</xref></sup> One should not extend a greeting<sup><xref rid="fn1399">21</xref></sup> in a place where people are undressed<sup><xref rid="fn1400">22</xref></sup> but only in a place where the majority present are dressed.<sup><xref rid="fn1401">23</xref></sup> If most of the persons present are dressed it is as though they are all dressed; if the majority are undressed it is as though they are all undressed. A man may not give greeting to his fellow in the bath-house on account of danger, and if one does greet him he should say, &#x2018;It is a bath-house&#x0021;&#x2019; Others say that he may return the greeting and it does not matter.</p>
<p label="4.">A man should not let his feet [dangle] in a bath-tub while he lies stretched out [naked], because it is immodest. A man should not say to his fellow in a bath-house, &#x2018;Rub me in well with your hand&#x2019;, and he who says so will not depart from there unscathed. R. Judah said: This only applies when there is little water,<sup><xref rid="fn1402">24</xref></sup> but when there is plenty of water it is all right. It is discreditable for a man to read [the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic>] twice<sup><xref rid="fn1403">25</xref></sup> or to immerse [in a ritual bath] twice.<sup><xref rid="fn1404">26</xref></sup></p>
<p label="5.">If a man covers himself in his cloak and stays in the room where they sweat he is as if he robbed the public.<sup><xref rid="fn1405">27</xref></sup> He who washes himself in cold water and then sluices himself with lukewarm water is as if he robbed the public.<sup><xref rid="fn1406">28</xref></sup> And if one did rob the public what should he do?<sup><xref rid="fn1407">29</xref></sup> He should go and dig wells, ditches and grottoes, or repair highways and streets,<sup><xref rid="fn1408">30</xref></sup> and then he will be forgiven.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1379">(1) Cf. Ber. 60a (Sonc. ed., p. 376).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1380">(2) i.e. in what order should he undress himself.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1381">(3) This is a necessary part of one&#x2019;s toilet in hot countries.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1382">(4) Because it is &#x2018;the king of all the limbs&#x2019;, Shab. 61a (Sonc. ed., p. 286).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1383">(5) To spare him the fatigue. The words within brackets are inserted by GRA and H.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1384">(6) The right half of the body being stronger, more honour must be shown to it. Removing the left first is likewise a mark of honour to the right because the right shoe remains longer on the foot.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1385">(7) Cf. Deut. VI, 8, where the hand is mentioned first.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1386">(8) Cf. Men. 36a (Sonc. ed., p. 224).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1387">(9) i.e. massage strongly.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1388">(10) With a strigil to invigorate the circulation. Cf. Shab. 147a (Sonc. ed., p. 747) where this is forbidden only on the Sabbath. Perhaps here it is only forbidden in the presence of many but not in the inner room where few people congregate (so NY). Another reading is &#x2018;or have his limbs broken&#x2019;, by a very vigorous massage.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1389">(11) In the presence of others, but he must retire to a corner.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1390">(12) [The translation is conjectural and suggested by the context. As it stands the text is unintelligible, but <italic>shemen</italic>, &#x2018;oil&#x2019;, seems to indicate a corruption of <italic>mashtin</italic>, &#x2018;to urinate&#x2019;.]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1391">(13) Lack of self-respect may lead to one testifying falsely. Cf. &#x1E32;id. 40b (Sonc. ed., p. 203).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1392">(14) i.e. hurry himself.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1393">(15) Because to hold oneself back endangers health.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1394">(16) i.e. wait.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1395">(17) He must wash himself completely with hot and then cold water before leaving the bath-house. Cf. DEZ VIII, p. 588.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1396">(18) In case the glass breaks.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1397">(19) Someone may slip over it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1398">(20) Cf. &#x2018;A.Z. 44b (Sonc. ed., p. 221), &#x2018;One may not discuss questions relating to Torah in a bath&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1399">(21) lit. &#x2018;inquire [after one&#x2019;s peace] and reply&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1400">(22) Cf. Shab. 10a (Sonc. ed., p. 36) where &#x2018;peace&#x2019; is said to be one of God&#x2019;s names.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1401">(23) So GRA. i.e. not in the inner chamber of the bath-house but in the outer chamber.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1402">(24) When the rubbing may arouse unclean thoughts.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1403">(25) Cf. Ber. 33b (Sonc. ed., p. 210, n. 7) where this applies only where he says each word of the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic> twice. If he repeats the whole sentence he is to be silenced, because it may appear as if he addresses himself to two Powers, similar to the dualism of the Persians, a God of light and a God of darkness. NY suggests a reading &#x2018;to wash himself twice&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1404">(26) Because people may suspect that he associates too much with women, a ritual bath being required after a seminal emission.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1405">(27) He prevents another from using the bath.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1406">(28) To wash oneself first in hot and then in cold water is beneficial to the body; to use up hot water after having already washed with cold is waste of water.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1407">(29) To make redress.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1408">(30) And so provide water for the general public among whom the aggrieved persons are to be found.</ftnote>

<title>Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta</title>
<chapter>
<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>This tractate differs from <italic>Derek &#x2019;Ere&#x1E93; Rabbah</italic> in that its teachings are directed mainly at scholars. A close examination reveals that the tractate is not the work of one author. In the editions of the Talmud, chaps. V-VIII are noted as having been taken from the <italic>Ma&#x1E25;zor Vi&#x1E6D;ri</italic>. The author of <italic>Halakoth Gedoloth</italic> quotes the section corresponding to chaps. V-VIII under the name of <italic>Derek &#x2019;Ere&#x1E93; Zu&#x1E6D;a</italic>, but designates the other chapters <italic>Darkan shel Talmid&#x00EB; &#x1E24;akamim</italic>, which is the opening phrase of chap. I.</p>
<p>It is possible that an unknown author compiled this shortened form of <italic>Derek &#x2019;Ere&#x1E93;</italic> and called it <italic>Zu&#x1E6D;a</italic>, and subsequently the term <italic>Rabbah</italic> may have been added to the original work to distinguish it from the smaller digest. The language and style of <italic>Zu&#x1E6D;a</italic> presuppose a much later date, probably after the completion of the Talmud. In some instances it is evident that the author must have had the Talmud before him. The first four chapters, however, appear to date from an earlier period. They may even have been an independent collection already in existence in the time of the <italic>Tanna&#x00EF;m</italic>, as they contain material which is old and often quoted as Baraithoth by the early authorities.</p>
<p>The different sections were put together by a later compiler, because all have the common factor that they contain exhortations to self-examination and meekness, and advocate temperance, resignation, gentleness, patience, respect for age, readiness to forgive, and the moral and social duties of a scholar.</p>
<p><italic>Zu&#x1E6D;a</italic> is written mostly in the form of short, pithy and disconnected maxims arranged in the style of <italic>Pir&#x1E33;&#x00EB; Aboth</italic>, except that they are anonymous. Here, too, the compiler attempted to arrange the teachings as far as possible according to external characteristics, the order followed being determined by the initial word or by the number of maxims. Precepts beginning with the same word are placed together even when unrelated in subject-matter. Especially are they so combined into groups of four, five or seven maxims, numbers which serve as an aid in memorizing the passages.</p>
<p>It has already been mentioned in the Introduction to <italic>Derek &#x2019;Ere&#x1E93; Rabbah</italic> that in Coronel&#x2019;s edition of <italic>&#x1E24;amishshah &#x1E32;un&#x1E6D;rasim</italic> we find many passages in <italic>Kallah Rabbathi</italic>, with Gemara attached, which really belong to <italic>Derek &#x2019;Ere&#x1E93;</italic>. They are as follows: III-V in KR are similar to I-III in DEZ, while VI, VII, IX and X in KR are similar to III-XI in DER.</p>
<h1><small>ANALYSIS OF THE TRACTATE</small></h1>
<p>In chaps. I-IV disciples are exhorted to devote themselves to the study of the Torah, to be humble, modest and sin-fearing. The conclusion of chap. IV may well have been an oration delivered at the ordination of a Rabbi.</p>
<p>Chaps. V-VIII contain rules of conduct for various occasions such as when eating and drinking, and on social behaviour in general. Here we find repetitions of and similarities to the contents of DER.</p>
<p>Chap. IX consists of advice given by R. Eliezer Ha-&#x1E32;appar to one of his disciples on a variety of subjects.</p>
<p>Like the <italic>Pere&#x1E33; Hashshalom</italic>, chap. X was probably a separate work which was later attached to the tractate. It deals with the signs of the coming of the Messianic era.</p>
<p>In DEZ the lack of redaction is more marked than in DER. In its present form it is later than DER (probably third century) and was quoted by <italic>&#x2019;Amora&#x00EF;m</italic> as Baraithoth and interpreted by teachers of the fourth century. The fact that the Geonim make mention of this tractate indicates that its final redaction must have taken place before that of the Babylonian Talmud.</p>
<p>[In the Talmud editions the chapters are not subdivided, but for the sake of convenience the numbering of the paragraphs has been adopted mainly from Higger&#x2019;s edition.]</p>

<title>DEREK &#x2019;ERE&#x1E92; ZU&#x1E6C;A</title>
<title>CHAPTER I</title>
<p label="1.">The characteristics of a scholar are that he is meek, humble,<sup><xref rid="fn1452">1</xref></sup> alert, filled [with a desire for learning],<sup><xref rid="fn1453">2</xref></sup> modest, beloved by all, humble to the members of his household and sin-fearing. He judges a man [fairly] according to his deeds,<sup><xref rid="fn1454">3</xref></sup> and says &#x2018;I have no desire for all the things of this world because this world is not for me&#x2019;. He sits and studies,<sup><xref rid="fn1455">4</xref></sup> soiling his cloak at the feet of the scholars.<sup><xref rid="fn1456">5</xref></sup> In him no one sees any evil. He questions according to the subject-matter<sup><xref rid="fn1457">6</xref></sup> and answers to the point.<sup><xref rid="fn1458">7</xref></sup></p>
<p label="2.">Be like a gourd split open that the wind may enter,<sup><xref rid="fn1459">8</xref></sup> like a deep furrow which retains its water,<sup><xref rid="fn1460">9</xref></sup> like a jar coated with pitch which preserves its wine,<sup><xref rid="fn1461">10</xref></sup> and like a sponge which absorbs all.<sup><xref rid="fn1462">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Be not like a wide opening which allows the wind to rush in,<sup><xref rid="fn1463">12</xref></sup> or like a narrow opening which injures the valuable [as they press through].<sup><xref rid="fn1464">13</xref></sup> Be like a doorstep on which everyone treads<sup><xref rid="fn1465">14</xref></sup> and like a low peg which is within the reach of all.<sup><xref rid="fn1466">15</xref></sup></p>
<p label="3.">If you suffered monetary loss, remember Job who was smitten both financially and physically. If you have been smitten physically, remember Dathan and Abiram who descended alive into Sheol.<sup><xref rid="fn1467">16</xref></sup></p>
<p label="4.">Do not be enticed into sin by your eyes, because enticement into sin is caused only through the eyes.<sup><xref rid="fn1468">17</xref></sup></p>
<p label="5.">Do not cause yourself to feel ashamed by your teeth<sup><xref rid="fn1469">18</xref></sup> lest you eat more than is good for you.<sup><xref rid="fn1470">19</xref></sup></p>
<p label="6.">Do not turn away from meritorious deeds and do not be attracted to heresy.<sup><xref rid="fn1471">20</xref></sup> Do not inquire of Sadducees<sup><xref rid="fn1472">21</xref></sup> lest you be drawn into Gehinnom.<sup><xref rid="fn1473">22</xref></sup></p>
<p label="7.">If others speak evil of you, answer them not; should it be a serious [calumny], regard it as slight. If, however, you spoke evil of others, though [the calumny] be slight, regard it as serious [and do not rest] until you go and pacify them.<sup><xref rid="fn1474">23</xref></sup></p>
<p label="8.">Let not your [behaviour during] adolescence be of blemished repute, for this would be derogatory to the Torah; but let it be of unblemished repute, for this would tend to glorify the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn1475">24</xref></sup></p>
<p label="9.">Love and honour the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn1476">25</xref></sup> Love your fellow-creatures and respect them.<sup><xref rid="fn1477">26</xref></sup></p>
<p label="10.">Set aside your will in face of the will of your fellow,<sup><xref rid="fn1478">27</xref></sup> for so did Rachel towards Leah and David towards Saul.<sup><xref rid="fn1479">28</xref></sup> Set aside your will and the will of your fellow in face of the will of Heaven, for so we find it with Jacob who did not kiss Joseph.<sup><xref rid="fn1480">29</xref></sup></p>
<p label="11.">Love the [term] &#x2018;perhaps&#x2019; and hate the [expression] &#x2018;how much?&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1481">30</xref></sup> R. &#x1E24;id&#x1E33;a expressed this in another way: Love the [term] &#x2018;perhaps&#x2019; and hate the [expression] &#x2018;what of it?&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1482">31</xref></sup></p>
<p label="12.">Keep aloof from anything that may lead to sin, from anything hideous and from whatever seems hideous,<sup><xref rid="fn1483">32</xref></sup> lest others suspect you of sin.</p>
<p label="13.">Slander not your fellow because there is no remedy for him who slanders his fellow.</p>
<p label="14.">Do not eat bread with a <italic>kohen</italic> who is an <italic>&#x2018;am ha-&#x2019;are&#x1E93;</italic> lest he give you sacred food to eat.<sup><xref rid="fn1484">33</xref></sup></p>
<p label="15.">Refrain from grumbling lest you grumble against others and be led into further sin.<sup><xref rid="fn1485">34</xref></sup></p>
<p label="16.">There were seven patriarchs with whom a divine covenant was made, viz.: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, Phinehas and David. In connection with Abraham it is written, <italic>In that day the Lord made a covenant with Abraham saying</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1486">35</xref></sup> In connection with Isaac it is written, <italic>But My covenant will I establish with Isaac</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1487">36</xref></sup> In connection with Jacob it is written, <italic>Then will I remember My covenant with Jacob</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1488">37</xref></sup> In connection with Moses it is written, <italic>For after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1489">38</xref></sup> In connection with Aaron it is written, <italic>It is an everlasting covenant of salt before the Lord</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1490">39</xref></sup> In connection with Phinehas it is written, <italic>And it shall be unto him, and to his seed after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1491">40</xref></sup> In connection with David it is written, <italic>I have made a covenant with My chosen, I have sworn unto David My servant</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1492">41</xref></sup></p>
<p label="17.">The following seven patriarchs have gone to their eternal rest with great honour and worms and maggots had no dominion over them, viz.: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, Miriam and their father Amram.<sup><xref rid="fn1493">42</xref></sup> Some say: Also David, as it is stated, <italic>Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth; my flesh also dwelleth in safety</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1494">43</xref></sup></p>
<p label="18.">There were nine<sup><xref rid="fn1495">44</xref></sup> who entered the Garden of Eden alive, viz.: Enoch the son of Yered, Elijah, the Messiah, Eliezer the servant of Abraham, Hiram, king of Tyre,<sup><xref rid="fn1496">45</xref></sup> Ebed-melech the Cushite, Jabe&#x1E93; the son of R. Judah the Prince, Bithiah the daughter of Pharaoh, and Sera&#x1E25; the daughter of Asher. Some say: Also R. Joshua b. Levi.</p>

<ftnote id="fn1453">(2) H reads <italic>memulla&#x1E25;</italic>, &#x2018;bright&#x2019;, as in &#x1E32;id. 29b (Sonc. ed., p. 141). Cf. KR III, 2, p. 443, n. 13.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1456">(5) For <italic>me&#x1E6D;annef</italic> H reads <italic>mith&#x2018;a&#x1E6D;&#x1E6D;ef</italic>, &#x2018;wrapped in his cloak&#x2019;, perhaps in the same sense as in Aboth I, 4 (Sonc. ed., p. 3), &#x2018;Suffer thyself to be covered by the dust of their feet&#x2019;, i.e. sit in the dust on the ground at their feet while they teach. GRA reads <italic>ma&#x1E6D;&#x1E6D;il</italic>, &#x2018;and throws his cloak in front of the feet of scholars&#x2019;, perhaps for them to sit on. For a different explanation, cf. KR III, p. 444, n. 17.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1457">(6) Cf. Shab. 3b (Sonc. ed., pp. 5f.), &#x2018;R. &#x1E24;iyya said to Rab: &#x201C;When Rabbi is occupied with one tractate, do not ask him a question relating to another&#x201D; &#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1458">(7) lit. &#x2018;in accordance with the accepted decision&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1459">(8) Let your mind be open to receive instruction. For readings which add the negative, cf. ARN p. 85 and KR p. 449.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1460">(9) Such a bed yields good produce; so must a scholar study continuously and raise good disciples.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1461">(10) i.e. he must have a retentive memory.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1462">(11) Cf. Aboth V, 18 (Sonc. ed., V, 15, p. 69).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1463">(12) i.e. do not cultivate associates indiscriminately, yet do not be so unapproachable that worthy companionships cannot get near to you. Or, do not create a stir on entering and leaving; or, do not allow petty and frivolous ideas to enter your mind.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1464">(13) By having to stoop or squeeze in; i.e. do not cause people worthy or your association to demean themselves or hold aloof.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1465">(14) i.e. be ready to learn from all.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1467">(16) Cf. Num. XVI, 32f.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1468">(17) Cf. So&#x1E6D;ah 8a (Sonc. ed., p. 35), &#x2018;We have learnt a tradition that the evil impulse only bears sway over what a person&#x2019;s eyes see&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1469">(18) GRA reads: &#x2018;Do not be attracted to appetizing dishes&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1470">(19) lit. &#x2018;more than is sufficient&#x2019;. NY quotes a reading: &#x2018;That you do not give them too much to eat&#x2019;. Another and better variant is: &#x2018;That you eat not&#x2019;, etc., i.e. <italic>shello&#x2019;</italic> instead of <italic>shemma&#x2019;</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1471">(20) Heb. <italic>minuth</italic>, a term for the teachings of the early Jewish-Christians.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1472">(21) A party holding views antagonistic to those of the Pharisees. They regarded only those observances obligatory which are in the written Torah and did not acknowledge what was derived by Rabbinical interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1473">(22) By abandoning the Torah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1474">(23) On the evil of slander, cf. &#x2018;Arak. 15b (Sonc. ed., pp. 86ff.).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1475">(24) The translation follows GRA.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1476">(25) By carrying out your duties towards God.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1482">(31) If I commit this trivial sin; so GRA, lit. &#x2018;What is in it?&#x2019; it is of little consequence.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1483">(32) Cf. &#x1E24;ul. 44b (Sonc. ed., p. 239).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1484">(33) Cf. Ned. 20a (Sonc. ed., p. 56).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1491">(40) <italic>ibid.</italic> XXV, 13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1492">(41) Ps. LXXXIX, 4. Perhaps this passage is quoted here to teach men to emulate their special characteristics. Abraham stands as the example of hospitality, Isaac of self-sacrifice, Jacob of scholarship (cf. Gen. XXV, 27, where according to Rabbinic interpretation <italic>tents</italic> means schools), Moses of meekness, Aaron of peace-making, Phinehas of zeal on behalf of God, and David of singing His praise.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1493">(42) In B.B. 17a (Sonc. ed., p. 86), &#x2018;and Benjamin the son of Jacob&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1494">(43) Ps. XVI, 9, the last words being understood as &#x2018;unaffected by worms&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1495">(44) For the list, cf. KR III, p. 461, and notes</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1496">(45) It is more likely that the word <italic>king</italic> has crept in by mistake and the text should read &#x2018;Hiram of Tyre&#x2019;, who was of the tribe of Naphtali (1 Kings VII, 13f.).</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER II<sup><xref rid="fn1497">1</xref></sup></title>
<p label="1.">Let all your undertakings be for the name of Heaven.<sup><xref rid="fn1498">2</xref></sup> Love Heaven and fear Heaven. Hurry to perform in gladness all the precepts.</p>
<p label="2.">Sit before the Elders and incline your ear to hear their words. Listen carefully to the words of your fellow; be not hasty to answer but give proper thought to your words. Speak of the first [point] first and of the last [point] last, and admit the truth. Speak not before him who is greater than you in wisdom.</p>
<p label="3.">If you desire to study,<sup><xref rid="fn1499">3</xref></sup> do not say regarding what you do not understand, &#x2018;I understand&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn1500">4</xref></sup> If you are questioned on [even] a trivial matter and you are not acquainted with it, be not ashamed to say, &#x2018;I do not know&#x2019;. If you were taught something which you did not grasp, be not ashamed to say [to the teacher], &#x2018;Repeat it to me&#x2019; and do not pretend to yourself &#x2018;I understood it&#x2019;.</p>
<p label="4.">Do [good] deeds for the sake of their Maker<sup><xref rid="fn1501">5</xref></sup> and speak of them<sup><xref rid="fn1502">6</xref></sup> for their own sake.<sup><xref rid="fn1503">7</xref></sup> Make not of them a crown wherewith to adorn yourself, an axe with which to chop or a spade with which to dig.<sup><xref rid="fn1504">8</xref></sup> Undertake to study the Torah [even] in straitened circumstances and disregard any insult. A well-ordered [moral] stock-taking and a virtuous adolescence [yield] security and truth.<sup><xref rid="fn1505">9</xref></sup></p>
<p label="5.">Love and honour the Torah; love righteous ways, reproofs<sup><xref rid="fn1506">10</xref></sup> and uprightness. Do not run after honour; do not be presumptuous in giving decisions.</p>
<p>Realize that from now until tomorrow everything you have, whether it belongs to you or not, is not yours;<sup><xref rid="fn1507">11</xref></sup> because what is yours is [in reality] not yours, so how can what is not yours be yours&#x0021; Of him who regards what is not his as his own, Scripture declares, <italic>Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his&#x0021; How long? and that ladeth himself with many pledges&#x0021;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1508">12</xref></sup></p>
<p label="6.">Accustom yourself to end on an auspicious note.<sup><xref rid="fn1509">13</xref></sup> Be modest and amiable towards all, and be humble and gentle of speech. Be quick [to render service] to a superior and easy of approach to a suppliant [for your service].<sup><xref rid="fn1510">14</xref></sup> [Be like] a good merchant<sup><xref rid="fn1511">15</xref></sup> and broad-shouldered.<sup><xref rid="fn1512">16</xref></sup></p>
<p label="7.">Keep aloof from anything which may bring you to sin. Recoil from [even] a minor sin that it may not lead you to a major sin. Hasten to [perform] a light precept<sup><xref rid="fn1513">17</xref></sup> and flee<sup><xref rid="fn1514">18</xref></sup> from even] a trivial transgression lest it will lead you to commit a grave transgression.</p>
<p label="8.">Let the honour of your fellow be as dear to you as your own.<sup><xref rid="fn1515">19</xref></sup> Show respect to all persons; say not, &#x2018;I will flatter this man that he may give me to eat, or that he may give me to drink, or another man that he may clothe me, or yet another that he may give me shelter&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn1516">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is better that you be ashamed of yourself<sup><xref rid="fn1517">21</xref></sup> than be put to shame by others.<sup><xref rid="fn1518">22</xref></sup> Let not your teeth bring shame upon you,<sup><xref rid="fn1519">23</xref></sup> nor your mouth bring you to abuse.<sup><xref rid="fn1520">24</xref></sup> Let not your tongue [cause others to] curse you or your lips discredit you, and do not bow down to your words.<sup><xref rid="fn1521">25</xref></sup></p>
<p label="9.">If you desire to secure your fellow&#x2019;s love, concern yourself with his welfare. If you want to keep away from sin, go, reflect and consider its consequences well. Take delight in the performance of a <italic>mi&#x1E93;wah</italic>, study hard and exult in [carrying it out] in all its details.<sup><xref rid="fn1522">26</xref></sup></p>
<p label="10.">If you did [someone] a great favour regard it as small, and do not say, &#x2018;I did this good act with my own [money]&#x2019;. Rather was it [from what God] had graciously given you and you should offer thanks to Heaven.<sup><xref rid="fn1523">27</xref></sup> If others have done you a slight favour regard it as if it were great, and do not say, &#x2018;The favour was done to me because of my worthy acts&#x2019;, but [say, &#x2018;In spite of] my unworthy acts a favour was done to me&#x2019;, as it is stated, <italic>And repayeth them that hate Him to their face, to destroy them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1524">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>If you wronged someone slightly regard it as a great wrong and exclaim, &#x2018;Woe is me, for I have sinned&#x0021; Woe is me, because harm was done through me&#x0021;&#x2019; If others did you a great wrong regard it as small and exclaim, &#x2018;I suffered slightly; I deserved more&#x2019;.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1497">(1) In H chap. II and the beginning of III are included, with many variants, in chap. I.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1498">(2) Having a sincere and high purpose. &#x2018;Heaven&#x2019; is a term for God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1499">(3) H adds &#x2018;the Torah&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1500">(4) GRA reads: &#x2018;and if he desires to teach [you a certain subject], do not say, &#x201C;I have heard it&#x201D; &#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1501">(5) i.e. God, Who decreed them (so RN to Ned. 62a); but Ba&#x1E25;ya ibn Pa&#x1E33;uda, in the Introduction to his <italic>Duties of the Heart</italic>, interprets, &#x2018;for the performance of them&#x2019;, i.e. doing good for its own sake and not from an interested motive.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1502">(6) viz. words of Torah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1503">(7) i.e. do not study in order to be called a Sage or Rabbi; cf. Ned. 62a (Sonc. ed., p. 197). So according to the emended text of GRA.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1504">(8) Cf. Aboth IV, 7 (Sonc. ed., IV, 5, p. 46).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1505">(9) GRA&#x2019;s emendation may mean: &#x2018;and your security will be real&#x2019;, or, &#x2018;your promise [which you give] will be true&#x2019;. An alternative rendering of V may be: &#x2018;[If your deeds] are well considered, and you have good breeding, your promise will be trustworthy&#x2019;. Cf. the reading in KR IV, 7, p. 466.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1506">(10) Levelled at you. Cf. <italic>Reprove a wise man, and he will love thee</italic> (Prov. IX, 8).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1507">(11) &#x2018;Is not yours&#x2019; is added by GRA.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1508">(12) Hab. II, 6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1509">(13) i.e. if you must criticize or predict misfortune, your last words should inspire confidence and comfort. Or, &#x2018;accustom yourself to finish anything good which you began to do&#x2019;, otherwise it will be credited to him who completes it. Other possible interpretations are: &#x2018;Accustom yourself to complete a deal with goodness&#x2019;, i.e. there should be no cause for resentment by the other party; &#x2018;Accustom yourself to end everything well&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1510">(14) Cf. DER II, p. 540, n. 41.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1511">(15) Who can distinguish between the genuine and the spurious; so know how to react towards different types of persons.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1512">(16) i.e. able to deal with all types. H reads <italic>re&#x1E25;ab kesef</italic>, &#x2018;liberal with money&#x2019;. Another interpretation is: &#x2018;Be like a good merchant (i.e. well stocked with goods so that a customer need not be kept waiting while the required article is brought from outside), and like a carrier who can carry a big load easily&#x2019;. The meaning may then be: Be well stocked and carry a heavy load of learning, so that you are ready to supply knowledge to an inquirer.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1513">(17) Cf. Ps. CXIX, 60. One is more liable to be slack and procrastinating with an easy task and so forget it; to obviate this a man should hasten to perform it as soon as it presents itself.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1514">(18) Not merely avoid, but put as long a distance as possible between yourself and transgression.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1515">(19) Cf. Aboth II, 15 (Sonc. ed., II, 10, p. 20).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1516">(20) Cf. Be&#x1E93;ah 32b (Sonc. ed., p. 165): &#x2018;He who is dependent on another&#x2019;s table, the world is dark for him and his life is no life&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1517">(21) i.e. be the first to recognize your faults and rectify them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1518">(22) Cf. Sanh. 42a (Sonc. ed., p. 274).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1519">(23) i.e. by spending more than you can afford on food so that you become reduced in circumstances.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1520">(24) By drinking more than is good for you.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1521">(25) Do not speak in haste without premeditation so that you will not have to humble yourself by asking pardon or having to retract. Other possible interpretations are: Do not regard your words as dogmatic; or, do not be self-opinionated; or, do not be a slave to your words, i.e. refrain from making a promise. H reads <italic>tishta&#x1E25;</italic>, &#x2018;do not spread your words&#x2019;, i.e. do not be verbose.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1522">(26) So GRA who conjectures <italic>bifra&#x1E6D;eha</italic>, but there is no MS. confirmation for it. A suggested reading is, <italic>shekan ureba&#x1E93; bifta&#x1E25;eha</italic>, &#x2018;Dwell and couch at the doors of [the Academy]&#x2019;; i.e. by constant study make yourself familiar with the <italic>mi&#x1E93;woth</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1523">(27) For the means with which to do good.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1524">(28) Deut. VII, 10. It is better not to receive the reward in this world but to store it up for the hereafter</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER III</title>
<p label="1.">Reflect before [the word] issues from your mouth. Consider your actions in accordance with good manners. Set a reward for every step you take.<sup><xref rid="fn1525">1</xref></sup> Submit to [divine] judgment and refrain from grumbling. Judge your fellow in the scale of merit<sup><xref rid="fn1526">2</xref></sup> and do not turn the scale against him.<sup><xref rid="fn1527">3</xref></sup> Rejoice in your lot and enjoy the little you have. Hate not him who reproves you. Your lot will always be blessed if you possess a bountiful eye<sup><xref rid="fn1528">4</xref></sup> and a contented soul.</p>
<p label="2.">Accustom your tongue to say, &#x2018;I do not know&#x2019;, lest you be led to falsehood and be apprehended.</p>
<p label="3.">If you are negligent in [the performance of] one precept you will eventually be negligent with another like it. If you belittle<sup><xref rid="fn1529">5</xref></sup> one precept you will eventually belittle others like it.<sup><xref rid="fn1530">6</xref></sup> If you transgress the words of the Torah intentionally, you will be made to transgress them intentionally or unintentionally.<sup><xref rid="fn1531">7</xref></sup> [58<italic>b</italic>] If you take for yourself anything which is not yours, what is yours will be taken from you.</p>
<p label="4.">Be careful with consecrated objects both when giving them<sup><xref rid="fn1532">8</xref></sup> and when eating them.<sup><xref rid="fn1533">9</xref></sup></p>
<p label="5.">Be humble and affable to all persons and particularly to the members of your household.<sup><xref rid="fn1534">10</xref></sup></p>
<p label="6.">The first stage of vowing leads to folly; the first stage of [ritual] uncleanness leads to idolatry; the first stage of levity with women leads to unchastity.<sup><xref rid="fn1535">11</xref></sup></p>
<p label="7.">If you make yourself a surety [for another] it should be with the object of paying [that surety];<sup><xref rid="fn1536">12</xref></sup> or if you become a guarantor it should be with the object of paying [the guarantee].<sup><xref rid="fn1537">13</xref></sup> If you borrow [money] it should be with the object of repaying [the loan];<sup><xref rid="fn1538">14</xref></sup> and if you lend money bear in mind that you may have to claim it<sup><xref rid="fn1539">15</xref></sup> and that you might [even] have to make a settlement.<sup><xref rid="fn1540">16</xref></sup></p>
<p label="8.">If one has acquired for himself a good name,<sup><xref rid="fn1541">17</xref></sup> he has acquired it for himself.<sup><xref rid="fn1542">18</xref></sup> If one has acquired for himself words of Torah, he has acquired for himself the life of the World to Come.</p>
<p label="9.">A shamefaced person is not apt to learn, nor is an impatient person fitted to teach. An ignorant person<sup><xref rid="fn1543">19</xref></sup> cannot be pious, an uncultured person<sup><xref rid="fn1544">20</xref></sup> sin-fearing,<sup><xref rid="fn1545">21</xref></sup> or anyone who engages much<sup><xref rid="fn1546">22</xref></sup> in business become a scholar. Put your mind, therefore, to the study of the Torah rather than to business.</p>
<p label="10.">Fifteen characteristics are mentioned in connection with a scholar, viz.: he is decorous in his entering and leaving,<sup><xref rid="fn1547">23</xref></sup> modest in his sitting,<sup><xref rid="fn1548">24</xref></sup> subtle<sup><xref rid="fn1549">25</xref></sup> in the fear [of God], shrewd in knowledge, discerning in his ways, [his mind] is absorptive and retentive, he answers fully,<sup><xref rid="fn1550">26</xref></sup> asks in accordance with the subject-matter<sup><xref rid="fn1551">27</xref></sup> and answers in accordance with the accepted decisions, listens [to others]<sup><xref rid="fn1552">28</xref></sup> and enlarges upon each subject, goes [to seek instruction] from the wise and learns in order to teach and practise.</p>
<p label="11.">Be not like the topmost lintel which is inaccessible to the feet or like the doorpost<sup><xref rid="fn1553">29</xref></sup> where anyone who sits by it is troubled and which ultimately collapses. Be like the doorstep<sup><xref rid="fn1554">30</xref></sup> on which most people tread but which remains when the whole building is in ruins.<sup><xref rid="fn1555">31</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1525">(1) i.e. see that your steps are directed to perform deeds which deserve a reward.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1526">(2) Seek a favourable interpretation of his actions even though they seem suspicious. Cf. Aboth I, 6 (Sonc. ed., p. 5).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1527">(3) Take a charitable view of his deeds.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1528">(4) Well disposed, generous; cf. Prov. XXII, 9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1529">(5) lit. &#x2018;speak lightly of&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1530">(6) V adds in brackets &#x2018;and you have done nothing for your trouble&#x2019; in fulfilling the precepts since you regard them of small worth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1531">(7) Circumstances will make it impossible for you to perform the precepts even if you are desirous of making good former lapses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1532">(8) To the <italic>kohen</italic> or Levite; do not withhold them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1533">(9) They must be eaten in a state of ritual cleanliness.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1534">(10) According to the text emended by GRA. V and H read: &#x2018;Be humble and affable to return [a salutation] to your acquaintance. Be lowly of spirit with all men, with the members of your household more than with all men; and if you grumble and fight with your household, your end is for Gehinnom&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1535">(11) Cf. Ned. 20a (Sonc. ed., p. 56).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1536">(12) If called upon to do so.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1537">(13) Therefore do not offer to become a guarantor lightheartedly.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1538">(14) So borrow only if you are in a position to repay.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1539">(15) And have difficulty in collecting it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1540">(16) And lose part of the sum loaned. Another reading is <italic>lehafsid</italic>, &#x2018;lose the sum&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1541">(17) Cf. Prov. XXII, 1; Eccl. VII, 1; Aboth II, 8 (Sonc. ed., II, 7, p. 17).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1542">(18) In the sense that, unlike any other possession, it cannot be transmitted to another.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1543">(19) For this passage, cf. Aboth II, 6 (Sonc. ed., II, 5, p. 15, nn. 3-8).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1544">(20) One devoid of knowledge and ethical principles.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1545">(21) He may avoid sin from fear of the consequences but not from ethical motives.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1546">(22) And leaves little or no time for study.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1547">(23) &#x2018;And leaving&#x2019; is inserted by GRA.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1548">(24) Does not rush to occupy a front seat.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1549">(25) In devising ways of manifesting his fear; cf. Ber. 17a (Sonc. ed., p. 102).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1550">(26) He takes a considerable time before answering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1551">(27) Cf. above I, 1, n. 6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1552">(28) Added by GRA.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1553">(29) lit. &#x2018;the middle [post]&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1554">(30) lit. &#x2018;the nethermost post&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1555">(31) Referring to the quality of humility. GRA emends the text to read: &#x2018;Be not like a lintel which can injure the face (by a person crashing into it), nor like the doorpost which can hurt the legs and ultimately collapses; but be like the doorstep on which most people tread and which remains in its place even when the whole building collapses&#x2019;.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER IV</title>
<p label="1.">Scholars lend dignity to a company,<sup><xref rid="fn1556">1</xref></sup> but not so ignorant men.</p>
<p label="2.">He who occupies himself [only] with the study of Scripture is but of indifferent merit;<sup><xref rid="fn1557">2</xref></sup> with Mishnah is meritorious and rewarded for it; with Talmud there can be nothing more meritorious. Yet run always to the Mishnah more than to the <italic>Shas</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1558">3</xref></sup></p>
<p label="3.">Do your [teaching of] Torah gratuitously and accept no remuneration for it; because the Omnipresent gave it gratuitously<sup><xref rid="fn1559">4</xref></sup> and one may not take a fee for the [teaching of] words of Torah. If you should accept remuneration for the [teaching of] words of Torah, you will consequently destroy [the moral constitution of] the entire world. Say not, &#x2018;I have no money&#x2019;, since all money is His,<sup><xref rid="fn1560">5</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>Mine is the silver, and Mine the gold, saith the Lord of hosts</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1561">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>If you practise charity you will merit wealth; and if you merited wealth practise charity with it. While you still possess it [live in such a manner that you] gain through it this world and also inherit the World to Come; for if you do not practise charity with it, it will suddenly disappear, as it is stated, <italic>Wilt thou set thine eyes upon it? It is gone</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1562">7</xref></sup></p>
<p label="4.">Say not, &#x2018;That man is wise<sup><xref rid="fn1563">8</xref></sup> but I am not wise&#x2019;,<sup><xref rid="fn1564">9</xref></sup> because you did not attend [upon scholars] as he did.<sup><xref rid="fn1565">10</xref></sup> Say not, &#x2018;That man is rich but I am not rich&#x2019;,<sup><xref rid="fn1566">11</xref></sup> because not everyone has the privilege to enjoy two tables.<sup><xref rid="fn1567">12</xref></sup> Say not, &#x2018;That man is handsome but I am ugly&#x2019;, because at the hour of death man becomes carrion; furthermore [animal] carrion may be sold to a Gentile or may be given as a gift, but no one cares for human carrion.<sup><xref rid="fn1568">13</xref></sup> Say not, &#x2018;That man is righteous but I am not righteous, because both of you are destined to give an account before the Most High. Say not, &#x2018;That man is strong but I am weak&#x2019;,<sup><xref rid="fn1569">14</xref></sup> because strength is only with [them who fulfil] the Torah, as it is stated, <italic>Bless the Lord, ye angels of His, ye mighty in strength, that fulfil His word, hearkening unto the voice of His word</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1570">15</xref></sup></p>
<p label="5.">Take these words to heart: Know whence you came, and whither you go, and before Whom you are destined to give an account and reckoning.<sup><xref rid="fn1571">16</xref></sup> Eye not [enviously] another&#x2019;s wealth because it undermines the gates of heaven.<sup><xref rid="fn1572">17</xref></sup></p>
<p label="6.">Suffer not your ears to listen to idle chatter, because they are burnt first of [all] the organs.<sup><xref rid="fn1573">18</xref></sup> Eye not [enviously] another&#x2019;s wealth, because it may cast you into thick darkness and gloom.</p>
<p>Let not your mouth repeat calumny, because it is the first to be summoned for judgment. Let there not be found with you calumny, any evil thing or anything stolen, because all your limbs will testify against you. Let not your feet hurry you to commit a sin lest the Angel of Death come to meet you.<sup><xref rid="fn1574">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Be not afraid of an earthly court because the witnesses against you are lovers of money,<sup><xref rid="fn1575">20</xref></sup> but fear the heavenly Court because there are witnesses above who testify against you, and moreover [your sins] proclaim war on you incessantly.</p>
<p label="7.">If you fulfilled My words joyfully, My heavenly household will go out to greet you and I will greet you with the words, &#x2018;Enter in peace&#x2019;.</p>
<p label="8.">Because your eyes have not looked [enviously] on another&#x2019;s wealth, they will shine amidst thick darkness and gloom, as it is stated, <italic>Then shall thy light rise in darkness, and thy gloom be as the noon-day</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1576">21</xref></sup> Because your ears have not listened to idle chatter they will hear [words of] peace for you in [this] world and cause you to hear them in the World to Come, as it is stated, <italic>And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying: &#x2018;This is the way, walk ye in it; when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left</italic>.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1577">22</xref></sup> Because your mouth did not recount calumny, all your adversaries will be slain by it.<sup><xref rid="fn1578">23</xref></sup> Because your mouth occupied itself with [the teaching of] the Torah, all who are worthy of a blessing will bless themselves through it.<sup><xref rid="fn1579">24</xref></sup> Because you withheld your hands from plunder, what can evil persons do to you? Because you did not close your hands from almsgiving, what can violent persons<sup><xref rid="fn1580">25</xref></sup> do to you? Because your feet did not hurry you to commit a sin, what can the Angel of Death do to you?</p>
<p label="9.">I admonish you with these words of Mine. You can do as you please<sup><xref rid="fn1581">26</xref></sup> but do not say, &#x2018;I was not warned&#x2019;.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1556">(1) Or, &#x2018;behave well in a company&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1557">(2) lit. &#x2018;it is meritorious and not meritorious&#x2019;, because the Written Torah can only be understood with the aid of the Oral Torah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1558">(3) Because it is more easily absorbed. For this passage, cf. B.M. 33a, b (Sonc. ed., p. 206).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1559">(4) Cf. Ned. 36b-37a (Sonc. ed., p. 113). As Moses taught the Elders gratuitously so must they pass their teaching on to others without pay. According to the Talmud, <italic>loc. cit.</italic>, this does not apply to Scripture, for the teaching of which a fee is allowed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1560">(5) He will provide you with sustenance without having to take payment for teaching.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1561">(6) Hag. II, 8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1562">(7) Prov. XXIII, 5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1563">(8) Endowed by nature with great intellectual gifts.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1564">(9) i.e. I am not so endowed and therefore it is useless for me to study.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1565">(10) One must make every effort to gain knowledge; cf. Meg. 6b (Sonc. ed., p. 30).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1566">(11) Although I am more God-fearing than he.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1567">(12) i.e. enjoy prosperity in this world and the bliss of the hereafter.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1568">(13) So in death the difference between the handsome and the ugly ceases to exist.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1569">(14) And therefore unable to control my sinful desires.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1570">(15) Ps. CIII, 20. So occupy yourself with the study of the Torah and you will increase moral strength.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1571">(16) Cf. Aboth III, 1 (Sonc. ed., p. 26).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1572">(17) To the envious the luminaries of heaven shine but dimly.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1573">(18) lit. &#x2018;of the limbs&#x2019;. From hearing unworthy or idle talk he may proceed to speak unworthy or idle words and then do unworthy or idle acts. The ear is, accordingly, the first organ to &#x2018;catch fire&#x2019;; cf. Keth. 5b (Sonc. ed., p. 18).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1574">(19) Lest you die before you make atonement.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1575">(20) i.e. subject to bribery. [H. Loewe, <italic>Rabbinic Anthology</italic>, p. 587, in agreement with a variant cited in H, omits the negative and renders: &#x2018;Fear the earthly tribunal, even though witnesses against you can be bribed; fear yet more the heavenly tribunal&#x2019;.]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1576">(21) Isa. LVIII, 10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1577">(22) <italic>ibid.</italic> XXX, 21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1578">(23) So GRA.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1579">(24) They will wish for no greater blessing than will come to you for what you have earned by your mouth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1580">(25) lit. &#x2018;owners of an arm&#x2019;, the emendation of GRA. V has &#x2018;owners of silver and gold&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1581">(26) Since man is endowed with free will.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER V</title>
<p label="1.">A scholar should not eat standing, lick his fingers or belch in the presence of his fellow. He talks little, jokes little, sleeps in moderation, is frugal in pleasures and minimizes &#x2018;[Yes], yes&#x2019; or &#x2018;No, no&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn1582">1</xref></sup></p>
<p label="2.">A man should always make a point of knowing with whom he is sitting or standing, with whom he is sitting at table, with whom he is conversing and who is his co-signatory to a deed.<sup><xref rid="fn1583">2</xref></sup></p>
<p label="3.">By four things are scholars<sup><xref rid="fn1584">3</xref></sup> recognizable: by their cup,<sup><xref rid="fn1585">4</xref></sup> their purse,<sup><xref rid="fn1586">5</xref></sup> their temper<sup><xref rid="fn1587">6</xref></sup> and by their attire.<sup><xref rid="fn1588">7</xref></sup> Some say: Also by their speech.<sup><xref rid="fn1589">8</xref></sup></p>
<p label="4.">The adornment of [knowledge of] Torah is wisdom, the adornment of wisdom is humility, the adornment of humility is fear [of God], the adornment of the fear [of God] is the performance of meritorious deeds, the adornment of the performance of meritorious deeds is modesty.<sup><xref rid="fn1590">9</xref></sup></p>
<p label="5.">A man should not be awake when among those who are asleep or asleep when among those who are awake. He should not weep when among those who are joyous or be joyous when among those who weep. He should not be sitting when among those who are standing or standing when among those who are sitting. He should not study Scripture when among those who study Mishnah or study Mishnah when among those who study Scripture. This is the general rule: A man should not act differently from the practice of his fellow-men.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1582">(1) Cf. Shebu. 36a (Sonc. ed., p. 211) where the repetition of &#x2018;yes&#x2019; and &#x2018;no&#x2019; is regarded as an oath. It may perhaps also mean to be sparing in making promises.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1583">(2) Cf. Sanh. 23a (Sonc. ed., p. 131).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1584">(3) In &#x2018;Erub. 65b (Sonc. ed., p. 455) the wording is: &#x2018;By three things may a person&#x2019;s&#x2019;, etc., not only a scholar.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1585">(4) By the amount of liquor they consume.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1586">(5) By what they spend their money on.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1587">(6) In the Heb. there is an effective alliteration: <italic>kis</italic> (purse), <italic>kos</italic> (cup) and <italic>ka&#x2018;as</italic> (temper). The last indicates self-control.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1588">(7) A scholar was expected to maintain cleanliness in his attire. Cf. Shab. 114a (Sonc. ed., p. 557).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1589">(8) &#x2018;Erub. adds &#x2018;also by their laughter&#x2019; and omits &#x2018;by their attire&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1590">(9) i.e. the unostentatious manner in which they are done.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER VI</title>
<p label="1.">Four things are unbecoming to scholars. One should not start out on a journey by night,<sup><xref rid="fn1591">1</xref></sup> go out scented,<sup><xref rid="fn1592">2</xref></sup> be the last to enter the Synagogue,<sup><xref rid="fn1593">3</xref></sup> or frequent the society of ignorant persons.</p>
<p label="2.">On entering the elder precedes, on leaving the younger precedes;<sup><xref rid="fn1594">4</xref></sup> when ascending a staircase the elder precedes, when descending a staircase the younger precedes; [when entering] a Council Chamber the elder precedes; [when entering] a prison the younger precedes; to pronounce a blessing<sup><xref rid="fn1595">5</xref></sup> the elder takes precedence. The passer-by greets one who is sitting.</p>
<p label="3.">No person should sit down at table to eat before his elders [have taken their seat]. When cutting off a piece of bread [for Grace before meals] one should do so from the part that is baked into a crust.<sup><xref rid="fn1596">6</xref></sup> When one is about to eat a leek or onion, he should begin to eat from the leaves.<sup><xref rid="fn1597">7</xref></sup> One should not take hold of a loaf, bite a piece off and place it back upon the table. When about to drink water in public, one should turn his face away and drink.<sup><xref rid="fn1598">8</xref></sup></p>
<p label="4.">A man should not be a caviller, trickster or tippler. He should overlook an insult and not glorify himself by his fellow&#x2019;s humiliation.<sup><xref rid="fn1599">9</xref></sup></p>
<p label="5.">The first stage in committing a sin is impure thought, the second is scoffing, the third haughtiness, the fourth cruelty, the fifth idleness, the sixth causeless hatred and the seventh an evil eye.<sup><xref rid="fn1600">10</xref></sup> That is what Solomon said, <italic>When he speaketh fair, believe him not; for there are seven abominations in his heart</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1601">11</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1591">(1) Either because of danger or not to arouse suspicion of immoral intention.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1592">(2) According to Ber. 43b (Sonc. ed., p. 266) this applies to scenting one&#x2019;s clothes and in a place where people are suspected of sodomy.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1593">(3) Ber. <italic>loc. cit.</italic>, reads <italic>&#x2018;Beth Hammidrash&#x2019;</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1594">(4) Or, &#x2018;the more important &#x2026; the less important&#x2019;. Cf. Ber. 61a (Sonc. ed., p. 381): &#x2018;In conferring honour we commence with the greatest&#x2019;.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER VII</title>
<p label="1.">There are seven characteristics in an uncultured man<sup><xref rid="fn1602">1</xref></sup> and seven in a wise man. A wise man does not speak before one who is greater than he in wisdom and in number,<sup><xref rid="fn1603">2</xref></sup> does not enter into the midst of the words of his fellow,<sup><xref rid="fn1604">3</xref></sup> is not hasty to answer; he asks in accordance with the subject-matter and answers in accordance with the accepted decision, speaks on the first [point] first and on the last [point] last, concerning what he has not heard he says, &#x2018;I have not heard it&#x2019;,<sup><xref rid="fn1605">4</xref></sup> and acknowledges the truth.<sup><xref rid="fn1606">5</xref></sup> The reverse of these are in an uncultured man.</p>
<p label="2.">A scholar must be modest in eating, drinking, washing, anointing,<sup><xref rid="fn1607">6</xref></sup> putting his shoes on, walking, his attire, [the modulation of] his voice, expectorating<sup><xref rid="fn1608">7</xref></sup> and good works.<sup><xref rid="fn1609">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>As a bride keeps herself secluded all the time she is in her father&#x2019;s house and only makes herself known when she goes out<sup><xref rid="fn1610">9</xref></sup> [as if] to say, &#x2018;Anyone who can testify anything against me,<sup><xref rid="fn1611">10</xref></sup> let him come and testify&#x2019;, so must a scholar be modest in his [good] deeds but renowned for his conduct. He must seek truth and not falsehood, honesty and not robbery, meekness and not haughtiness, peace and not conflict, the counsel of the Elders and not the counsel of the young.<sup><xref rid="fn1612">11</xref></sup> He should rather walk behind a lion than behind a woman.<sup><xref rid="fn1613">12</xref></sup></p>

<title>CHAPTER VIII</title>
<p label="1.">Be pliable like the reed upon which the wind can blow from every direction it chooses;<sup><xref rid="fn1620">1</xref></sup> for the Torah can only endure with him who is humble in spirit.</p>
<p>Why is the Torah likened to water?<sup><xref rid="fn1621">2</xref></sup> It is to teach you that as water does not flow [from a lower] to a higher level but [from a higher level] to a lower, so the Torah endures only with him who is humble in spirit.<sup><xref rid="fn1622">3</xref></sup></p>
<p label="2.">Keep aloof from anything hideous and from whatever resembles it,<sup><xref rid="fn1623">4</xref></sup> and draw near to what [59<italic>a</italic>] is becoming and all that resembles it. Beware of one who counsels you in his own interest.<sup><xref rid="fn1624">5</xref></sup></p>
<p label="3.">Who waives his right to retribution<sup><xref rid="fn1625">6</xref></sup> is forgiven all his sins, as it is stated, <italic>Who is a God like unto Thee, that pardoneth the iniquity, and passeth by the transgression</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1626">7</xref></sup> [which means,] who is forgiven iniquity? He who passed by transgression [against himself].<sup><xref rid="fn1627">8</xref></sup></p>
<p label="4.">Whoever abases [<italic>mithnabbel</italic>] himself in connection with words of Torah<sup><xref rid="fn1628">9</xref></sup> will in the end be exalted on its account, as it is stated <italic>If thou hast done foolishly</italic> [<italic>nabalta</italic>] <italic>in lifting up thyself</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1629">10</xref></sup> [which means,] if you have abased yourself for words of the Torah, in the end you will be exalted.</p>
<p label="5.">He who seeks [knowledge of] the Torah, added wisdom will be given to him,<sup><xref rid="fn1630">11</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>Give to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1631">12</xref></sup></p>
<p label="6.">So long as a person is a sinner he has fear of his fellow-creatures; but so long as he is not a sinner his fellow-creatures have fear of him.<sup><xref rid="fn1632">13</xref></sup></p>
<p label="7.">Whoever makes light of a single point of the Torah is liable to <italic>kareth</italic>, as it is stated, <italic>Because he hath despised the word of the Lord &#x2026; that soul shall utterly be cut off</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1633">14</xref></sup> And he who makes light of the [precept of] washing the hands will be uprooted from the world.<sup><xref rid="fn1634">15</xref></sup></p>
<p label="8.">Whoever is not shamefaced will readily sin, as it is stated, <italic>The show of their countenance doth witness against them;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1635">16</xref></sup> but he who experiences shame<sup><xref rid="fn1636">17</xref></sup> will not readily sin, as it is stated, [<italic>And Moses said unto the people: &#x2018;Fear not; for God is come to prove you</italic>] <italic>and that His fear may be before you, that ye sin not</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1637">18</xref></sup></p>
<p label="9.">It is unbecoming for a host to eat in the presence of his guest [without inviting him to join him]; it is more unbecoming for one guest to bring in another guest;<sup><xref rid="fn1638">19</xref></sup> it is still more unbecoming when one eats in the presence of a scholar. More unbecoming than these three is for a guest to cause trouble to another guest.<sup><xref rid="fn1639">20</xref></sup> R. Meir said: [Most unbecoming of all is] he who takes [food] set before him and gives it to the host&#x2019;s child; for it once happened that [through such an action] a host killed his child.<sup><xref rid="fn1640">21</xref></sup></p>
<p label="10.">He who humbles himself will understand his instruction and whoever transgresses the words of the Sages deserves <italic>kareth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1641">22</xref></sup> Whoever [continually] declares [others] unfit is [himself] unfit.<sup><xref rid="fn1642">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: The beginning of my attendance upon the Sages<sup><xref rid="fn1643">24</xref></sup> was this. I was once on a journey when I came across a <italic>meth mi&#x1E93;wah</italic> which I carried about four <italic>mil</italic> until I brought it to a cemetery and buried it there. When I appeared before R. Eliezer and R. Joshua and told them what had happened, they said to me, &#x2018;Every step you took is reckoned against you as if you had shed blood&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn1644">25</xref></sup> I said to them, &#x2018;If, in a case where I intended to perform a meritorious act I have made myself liable like a wicked person, how much more [will I deserve punishment] when I have no [meritorious] intention&#x0021; From that moment I did not let an opportunity pass to minister to the Sages&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn1645">26</xref></sup> He used to say: One who does not minister to the Sages deserves death.</p>

<title>CHAPTER IX<sup><xref rid="fn1650">1</xref></sup></title>
<p label="1.">R. Eliezer Ha-&#x1E32;appar said: Keep aloof from making complaints, because if you complain against others you will be led to further sin.<sup><xref rid="fn1651">2</xref></sup></p>
<p label="2.">Love him who reproves you so that you may increase knowledge; and hate him who flatters<sup><xref rid="fn1652">3</xref></sup> you so that your knowledge may not decrease.</p>
<p label="3.">Love the Synagogue that you may receive your reward daily.<sup><xref rid="fn1653">4</xref></sup> Love the House of Study that your children may come to study the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn1654">5</xref></sup> Love the poor that your children may not come to that condition. Love meekness that you may complete [the number of] your years.<sup><xref rid="fn1655">6</xref></sup> Love the pious<sup><xref rid="fn1656">7</xref></sup> that you may be saved from the Angel of Darkness.<sup><xref rid="fn1657">8</xref></sup></p>
<p label="4.">Be heedful in the reading of the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic> and the <italic>&#x2018;Amidah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1658">9</xref></sup> that you may be saved from the judgment of Gehinnom. Let your house be open wide<sup><xref rid="fn1659">10</xref></sup> that you may have no lack of food. Be heedful not to shut the doors of your house when you sit down to eat and drink, because the doors of your house may bring you to poverty.<sup><xref rid="fn1660">10a</xref></sup></p>
<p label="5.">Be heedful to honour<sup><xref rid="fn1661">11</xref></sup> your wife<sup><xref rid="fn1662">12</xref></sup> that she become not barren. Be happy when sufferings come upon you, because they deliver you from the punishment of Gehinnom.<sup><xref rid="fn1663">13</xref></sup> Rejoice at your table when the hungry benefit from it so that your life may be prolonged in this world and in the World to Come.</p>
<p label="6.">Be happy when you donate gifts [of charity] quietly<sup><xref rid="fn1664">14</xref></sup> so that the anger [of the Angel of Death]<sup><xref rid="fn1665">15</xref></sup> may be diverted from you, as it is stated, <italic>A gift in secret pacifieth anger, and a present in the bosom strong wrath</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1666">16</xref></sup></p>
<p label="7.">If you have restrained yourself from doing a good deed, the Angel of Death will come to meet you.<sup><xref rid="fn1667">17</xref></sup> If you have exerted yourself<sup><xref rid="fn1668">18</xref></sup> in connection with the poor or the fulfilment of a precept, there will be fulfilled in you <italic>Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1669">19</xref></sup> If you guarded your mouth from slander, all the days of your life will be spent in peace; but if you were presumptuous towards a person greater than yourself, you will ultimately be stricken with skin disease.<sup><xref rid="fn1670">20</xref></sup></p>
<p label="8.">If you withheld yourself from performing a meritorious act and occupied yourself with a sinful act, your wife will ultimately die of a stroke, as it is stated, <italic>Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1671">21</xref></sup></p>
<p label="9.">If you bestirred yourself to honour a Sage, you will have perfect sons and daughters; and if you bestirred yourself to honour a poor man, you will have children in Israel who are learned in Torah and perform the commandments. If you were present at the death of a Sage, do not leave him until you have accompanied him to the grave,<sup><xref rid="fn1672">22</xref></sup> so that when you die you may enter and rest in the grave in peace.<sup><xref rid="fn1673">23</xref></sup></p>
<p label="10.">If you notice that your fellow&#x2019;s face is worried because he has become poor, do not send him away empty-handed, in order that you may be delivered from all evil;<sup><xref rid="fn1674">24</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>Whoso keepeth the commandment shall know no evil thing</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1675">25</xref></sup> If you have given him a loan in the time of his emergency, there will be fulfilled in you <italic>Then shalt thou call, and the Lord will answer</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1676">26</xref></sup></p>
<p label="11.">If you have humbled yourself, the Holy One, blessed be He, will lift you up; if you have exalted yourself before your fellow, the Holy One, blessed be He, will set you low. Should people strive<sup><xref rid="fn1677">27</xref></sup> with you, whether it be in the House of Study or at a social gathering,<sup><xref rid="fn1678">28</xref></sup> make peace with them, so that when you leave them<sup><xref rid="fn1679">29</xref></sup> they may speak well of you, as was spoken of Phinehas the son of Eleazar.<sup><xref rid="fn1680">30</xref></sup></p>
<p label="12.">And so used R. Eleazar Ha-&#x1E32;appar to say: Love peace and hate dissension. Great is peace, for even if [Israel] were to practise idolatry but maintained peace among themselves, the Divine Presence, as it were, would be unable to do them harm, as it is stated, <italic>Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1681">31</xref></sup> But if there is dissension between them, what is stated of them? <italic>Their heart is divided; now shall they bear their guilt</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1682">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>A house in which is dissension will ultimately be destroyed. A Synagogue [in which is dissension] will ultimately be turned into a place of idolatry.<sup><xref rid="fn1683">33</xref></sup> If two scholars reside in the same city who have set up separate Courts of Law and dissension occurs between them, they will ultimately die [prematurely].<sup><xref rid="fn1684">34</xref></sup> Abba Saul said: Dissension between separate Courts of Law is the ruination of the world.</p>
<p label="13.">Abba Isi b. Jo&#x1E25;anan said in the name of Samuel the Small: This world is likened to a person&#x2019;s eyeball: the white of the eye [corresponds to] the ocean which surrounds the whole world; the iris to the [inhabited] world; the pupil of the eye to Jerusalem; the face in the pupil to the Temple.

Nehemiah said: In the generation when the son of David comes, impudence will increase, esteem will be perverted,<sup><xref rid="fn1699">15</xref></sup> the vine will yield its fruit yet wine will be dear,<sup><xref rid="fn1700">16</xref></sup> and the government will be converted to heresy<sup><xref rid="fn1701">17</xref></sup> with none to reprove. 2. R. Jose said: Two are better than three,<sup><xref rid="fn1702">18</xref></sup> and alas for the one thing<sup><xref rid="fn1703">19</xref></sup> which goes and does not return. He used to say: We do not appoint as leader of the community one who is a blood-letter,<sup><xref rid="fn1704">20</xref></sup> a tanner or a builder;<sup><xref rid="fn1705">21</xref></sup> nor do we appoint any of them as an administrator.<sup><xref rid="fn1706">22</xref></sup> He used to say: They who dwell in villages and they who travel in the wilderness lead a miserable life,<sup><xref rid="fn1707">23</xref></sup> their money is not secure,<sup><xref rid="fn1708">24</xref></sup> and their children are not their own.<sup><xref rid="fn1709">25</xref></sup></p>
<p label="3.">Four <italic>peru&#x1E6D;oth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1710">26</xref></sup> are without a sign of blessing.<sup><xref rid="fn1711">27</xref></sup> They are: the wages of scribes,<sup><xref rid="fn1712">28</xref></sup> the wages of interpreters,<sup><xref rid="fn1713">29</xref></sup> money that came from overseas,<sup><xref rid="fn1714">30</xref></sup> and he who marries for the sake of a dowry.<sup><xref rid="fn1715">31</xref></sup> These will not be able to bequeath anything to their children or grandchildren.</p>
<p label="4.">There are some who marry for sexual indulgence, and there are some who marry for money. There are some who marry for social advancement<sup><xref rid="fn1716">32</xref></sup> and there are some who marry with sincere intention.<sup><xref rid="fn1717">33</xref></sup> Of him who marries for sexual indulgence Scripture declares, <italic>They have dealt treacherously against the Lord, for they have begotten strange children</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1718">34</xref></sup> Of him who marries for money Scripture declares, <italic>Now shall the new moon devour them with their portions</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1719">35</xref></sup> [implying] a month comes and a month goes and their money is gone. He who marries for social advancement will ultimately be deposed from his high position; but he who marries with sincere intention will ultimately have children who will be saviours of Israel.</p>
<p label="5.">The adornment of God is mankind; the adornment of mankind is the Torah;<sup><xref rid="fn1720">36</xref></sup> the adornment of the Torah is wisdom; the adornment of old age is grey hair; the adornment of youth is the fear of sin; the adornment of an <italic>&#x2018;am ha-&#x2019;are&#x1E93;</italic> is a curse.<sup><xref rid="fn1721">37</xref></sup></p>

<p label="7.">One who has wisdom but no fear [of God] is contemptible;<sup><xref rid="fn1723">39</xref></sup> [one who has] fear [of God] but no wisdom is poor;<sup><xref rid="fn1724">40</xref></sup> [one who has] neither wisdom nor fear [of God] is thoroughly wicked; [one who has] wisdom and fear [of God] is thoroughly righteous.</p>

<ftnote id="fn1701">(17) Heb. <italic>minuth.</italic> By &#x2018;the kingdom&#x2019; the Roman Empire is meant, and the statement is a remarkable forecast by R. Nehemiah (100 <small>C.E.</small>) of the conversion of Rome to Christianity under Constantine the Great in 313 <small>C.E.</small> Cf. however, Herford, <italic>Christianity in Talmud and Midrash</italic>, pp. 207ff., Sanh., <italic>loc. cit.</italic> (Sonc. ed., p. 656, n. 4).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1702">(18) So GRA. The two legs in youth are better than the three, i.e. the addition of a stick in old age for walking.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1703">(19) Youth.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1709">(25) Their wives are not safe from attack; cf. &#x2018;Erub. 55b (Sonc. ed., p. 391).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1710">(26) i.e. the monies earned from the four occupations enumerated.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1711">(27) It is therefore not advisable to engage in them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1712">(28) Cf. Pes. 50b (Sonc. ed., p. 246) where the reference is to writers of Torah-scrolls, <italic>tefillin</italic> and <italic>mezuzoth;</italic> if they become wealthy they would no longer write them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1713">(29) Officials who delivered the Sabbath lectures of the Rabbi to the congregation. The Rabbi whispered his statement to the interpreter, who elaborated it to the people. It includes the translators of the weekly lections of the Torah on the Sabbath in the Synagogue. The reason given in Pes. is that it appears like wages for Sabbath work.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1714">(30) Danger attended the transport of freights by sea and one might suffer <italic>loss</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1715">(31) Pes. has instead &#x2018;the profit of orphans&#x2019;, i.e. derived by trading with trust money.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1718">(34) Hos. V, 7. In &#x1E32;id. 70a (Sonc.ed., p.354) the verse is applied to one who marries for money and it states that &#x2018;he will have unworthy children&#x2019;, the word <italic>strange</italic> meaning &#x2018;strange from the ways of decency&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1719">(35) <italic>ibid.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1720">(36) So GRA. V has &#x2018;their garments&#x2019;; cf. Shab. 113b (Sonc. ed., p. 556).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1721">(37) The opposite of &#x2018;blessing&#x2019; which he deserves for the neglect of the Torah. The meaning is obscure. Two possibilities suggest themselves. 1) That he deserves nothing more than a curse (and this reflects the reciprocal hostility we find elsewhere between the <span dir="rtl">&#x05E2;&#x05F4;&#x05D4;</span> and the scholar. 2) That a curse comes most readily to the lips of an <span dir="rtl">&#x05E2;&#x05F4;&#x05D4;</span>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1722">(38) The reading in Ber. 47b (Sonc. ed., p. 287) and So&#x1E6D;ah 22a (Sonc. ed., p. 110) is: &#x2018;Even if he learnt Scripture and Mishnah but did not attend upon Rabbinical scholars, he is an <italic>&#x2018;am ha-&#x2019;are&#x1E93;&#x2019;</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1723">(39) Or his knowledge is contemptible, because he does not use it for a good purpose.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1724">(40) The clause is added by GRA. He lacks what is essential; or, his fear of God is of poor quality.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>In the edition of the Wilna Talmud, <italic>Derek &#x2019;Ere&#x1E93; Zu&#x1E6D;a</italic> consists of eleven chapters, the last being entitled <italic>Pere&#x1E33; Hashshalom</italic>. It is, however, not part of that tractate but a separate collection of dicta on the theme of Peace.</p>
<p>The probability is that it was appended to the tractate because it concludes with a description of the state of degeneracy which will precede the coming of the Messiah, whose advent will bring abiding peace to the world. Or it was attached to chap. IX, originally the end of the tractate, which touches on the blessings of peace.</p>

<title>PERE&#x1E32; HASHSHALOM</title>
<p label="1.">R. Joshua b. Levi said: Great is peace, for peace is to the world as leaven is to dough. Had not the Holy One, blessed be He, given peace to the earth, the sword and the beast would have robbed the world<sup><xref rid="fn1725">1</xref></sup> of its children. Whence<sup><xref rid="fn1726">2</xref></sup> [do we know this]? From what is written, <italic>And I will give peace in the land &#x2026; and I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1727">3</xref></sup> and <italic>land</italic> means nothing else than Israel, as it is stated, <italic>And all nations shall call you happy; for ye shall be a delightsome land</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1728">4</xref></sup> [And so Solomon declared,] <italic>One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh; and the earth abideth for ever</italic>:<sup><xref rid="fn1729">5</xref></sup> Solomon said:<sup><xref rid="fn1730">6</xref></sup> Although a generation passes away and another generation comes, one kingdom goes and another kingdom comes, one decree passes away and a new decree is imposed upon Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn1731">7</xref></sup> <italic>the earth abideth for ever</italic>, i.e. Israel will abide for ever,<sup><xref rid="fn1732">8</xref></sup> they are not forsaken nor will they be forsaken, they are not destroyed nor will they be destroyed, as it is stated, <italic>For I the Lord change not; and ye, O sons of Jacob are not consumed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1733">9</xref></sup>&#x2014;as I have not changed nor will I change, so you, the House of Jacob, are not destroyed and will not be destroyed, but [as it is stated], <italic>But ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God are alive every one of you this day</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1734">10</xref></sup></p>
<p label="2.">There<sup><xref rid="fn1735">11</xref></sup> they taught: Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel used to say: By three things does the world endure: justice, truth and peace.<sup><xref rid="fn1736">12</xref></sup> R. Muna said: The three are one, because if justice is done, truth has been effected and peace brought about; and all three are mentioned in one verse, as it is stated, <italic>Execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1737">13</xref></sup> [indicating that] wherever justice is done peace is to be found.</p>
<p label="3.">R. Joshua said: Great is peace, for when Israel stood [at Sinai] and declared, <italic>All that the Lord hath spoken we will do, and obey</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1738">14</xref></sup> [59<italic>b</italic>] the Holy One, blessed be He, rejoiced in them and gave them His Torah and blessed them with peace, as it is stated, <italic>The Lord will give strength</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1739">15</xref></sup> <italic>unto His people; the Lord will bless His people with peace</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1740">16</xref></sup></p>
<p label="4.">Hezekiah said: Great is peace, for in connection with all other precepts in the Torah it is written, <italic>If thou see</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1741">17</xref></sup> etc., <italic>If thou meet</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1742">18</xref></sup> <italic>If there chance</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1743">19</xref></sup> <italic>If thou buildest</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1744">20</xref></sup> [implying,] if a precept comes to your hand, you are bound to perform it;<sup><xref rid="fn1745">21</xref></sup> but what is written in connection with peace? <italic>Seek peace, and pursue it</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1746">22</xref></sup> [meaning,] seek it in your place and follow it to another place.<sup><xref rid="fn1747">23</xref></sup></p>
<p label="5.">Hezekiah said: Great is peace, for with regard to all the journeyings [of Israel] it is written, <italic>And they journeyed &#x2026; and they pitched</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1748">24</xref></sup> [the plural number implying that] they journeyed in dissension and encamped in dissension. When, however, they came to Mount Sinai, they all became one encampment, [as it is stated,] <italic>And there Israel encamped</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1749">25</xref></sup> <italic>before the mount</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1750">26</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, said, &#x2018;Since Israel hate dissension and love peace and became one encampment, this is the time when I will give them My Torah&#x2019;.</p>
<p>Adonijah was slain only because he was a quarrelsome person,<sup><xref rid="fn1751">27</xref></sup> and it is permissible to slander a quarrelsome person; for thus did Nathan the prophet say to Bathsheba, <italic>I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1752">28</xref></sup> And Rabbi [Judah the Prince] said: All falsehoods are prohibited, but it is permissible to utter a falsehood for the purpose of making peace between a man and his fellow.<sup><xref rid="fn1753">28a</xref></sup></p>
<p label="6.">Bar &#x1E32;appara said: Great is peace, for we find that the Torah modified a statement in order to maintain peace between Abraham and Sarah. It is stated, <italic>And Sarah laughed within herself, saying &#x2026; my lord being old</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn1754">29</xref></sup> but in the sequel<sup><xref rid="fn1755">30</xref></sup> it is written, <italic>I who am old</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1756">31</xref></sup></p>
<p label="7.">Bar &#x1E32;appara said: Great is peace, for we find that in the prophets, too, Scripture modified a statement for the purpose of maintaining peace between Manoa&#x1E25; and his wife. At first<sup><xref rid="fn1757">32</xref></sup> it is written, <italic>Behold, now, thou art barren &#x2026; but thou shalt conceive and bear a son;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1758">33</xref></sup> but in the sequel<sup><xref rid="fn1759">34</xref></sup> it is written, <italic>Behold thou shalt conceive and bear a son</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1760">35</xref></sup> and there is no mention of the words <italic>behold thou art barren</italic>.</p>
<p label="8.">Bar &#x1E32;appara said: Great is peace, for even the angels among whom there is no enmity, jealousy, hatred, strife, rivalry or dissension [have need for] the Holy One, blessed be He, to make peace among them; as it is stated,<sup><xref rid="fn1761">36</xref></sup> <italic>Dominion and fear are with Him; He maketh peace in His high places</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1762">37</xref></sup>&#x2014;<italic>dominion</italic> alludes to Michael and <italic>fear</italic> to Gabriel, one being of fire and the other of water<sup><xref rid="fn1763">38</xref></sup> and yet they do not injure one another;<sup><xref rid="fn1764">39</xref></sup> how much more so then do mortal beings, among whom all these dispositions exist, [have need of peace] &#x0021;</p>
<p label="9.">R. Ishmael said: Great is peace, for we find that the Holy One, blessed be He, permitted His Name, though written in holiness, to be blotted out in water,<sup><xref rid="fn1765">40</xref></sup> for the purpose of restoring peace between husband and wife.</p>
<p label="10.">R. Joshua said: Great is peace, for the covenant with the priests was made with [the word] &#x2018;peace&#x2019;, as it is stated, <italic>Behold, I give unto him My covenant of peace</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1766">41</xref></sup></p>
<p label="11.">R. Joshua said: Great is peace, for the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, is called &#x2018;peace&#x2019;, as it is stated, <italic>And he called it</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1767">42</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;Adonai-shalom&#x2019;</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1768">43</xref></sup> <sup><xref rid="fn1769">44</xref></sup>R. &#x1E24;iyya b. Abba said: Hence it can be deduced that a person may not extend a greeting of peace to his fellow in a place of filth, because it is stated, <italic>And Gideon built an altar there unto the Lord and called it &#x2018;Adonai-shalom&#x2019;</italic>. Now if an altar which does not eat, drink or smell and was erected only to make an atonement for [the sins of] Israel is called &#x2018;peace&#x2019;, he who loves peace and pursues peace, who welcomes people with the greeting of peace<sup><xref rid="fn1770">45</xref></sup> and responds with peace, and who maintains peace between Israel and their Father in heaven, how much more so&#x0021; R. Jose the Galilean said: Even the name of the Messiah is called &#x2018;peace&#x2019;, [as it is stated,] <italic>And his name is called &#x2026; Abi-ad-sar-shalom</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1771">46</xref></sup></p>
<p label="12.">R. Joshua said: Great is peace, for [the children of] Israel are called &#x2018;peace&#x2019;, as it is stated, <italic>For as the seed of peace, the vine shall give her fruit</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1772">47</xref></sup> To whom will peace [be given]? To <italic>the seed of peace</italic>.</p>
<p label="13.">R. Jose the Galilean said: Great is peace, seeing that when king Messiah will reveal himself to Israel, his first message will be peace, as it is stated, <italic>How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger of good tidings, that announceth peace</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1773">48</xref></sup></p>
<p label="14.">R. Jose the Galilean said: Great is peace, since even in a time of war one should begin [by attempting to arrange] peace, as it is stated, <italic>When thou drawest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1774">49</xref></sup></p>
<p label="15.">R. Joshua said: Great is peace, since the Holy One, blessed be He, will in the hereafter support the righteous with peace, as it is stated, <italic>The mind stayed on Thee Thou keepest in perfect peace</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1775">50</xref></sup></p>
<p label="16.">R. Joshua said: Great is peace, for it is given [as a blessing] to the living and the dead. Whence to the living? [As it is stated,] <italic>And Jethro said to Moses: &#x2018;Go in peace&#x2019;</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1776">51</xref></sup> And whence to the dead? [As it is stated,] <italic>But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1777">52</xref></sup></p>
<p label="17.">Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel said: Great is peace, for we find that the tribes<sup><xref rid="fn1778">53</xref></sup> reported an untrue statement in order to maintain peace between Joseph and his brethren; as it is stated, <italic>And they sent a message unto Joseph, saying: Thy father did command before he died, saying: So shall ye say unto Joseph: Forgive, I pray thee now, the transgression of thy brethren and their sin</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1779">54</xref></sup> but we do not find that [Jacob] had given them any such command.<sup><xref rid="fn1780">55</xref></sup></p>
<p label="18.">Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel said: Great is peace, for Aaron the [High] Priest was praised only for peace; for he loved peace, pursued peace, greeted with the salutation of peace and responded with it, as it is stated, <italic>He walked with Me in peace and uprightness</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1781">56</xref></sup> It teaches that when he noticed two persons at enmity one with the other, he used to go first to one of them and say to him, &#x2018;Why do you hate So-and-so? He has already come to my house, prostrated himself before me and said to me, &#x201C;I sinned against So-and-so&#x201D;. Go and pacify him&#x2019;. When he left this one, he went to the other and spoke to him similarly, and so made peace, love and friendship between a man and his fellow. What is written subsequently? <italic>For he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1782">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Joshua said: The prophet is called &#x2018;messenger [of the Lord]&#x2019; and the priest<sup><xref rid="fn1783">58</xref></sup> is called &#x2018;messenger [of the Lord]&#x2019;. The prophet is called &#x2018;messenger [of the Lord]&#x2019;, as it is stated, <italic>Then spoke Haggai the Lord&#x2019;s messenger;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1784">59</xref></sup> and the priest is called &#x2018;messenger [of the Lord]&#x2019;, as it is stated, <italic>For he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1785">60</xref></sup> Lest you think that this applies even to a priest who is an <italic>&#x2018;am ha-&#x2019;are&#x1E93;</italic>, the text declares, <italic>And they should seek the law at his mouth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1786">61</xref></sup></p>
<p label="19.">R. Joshua of Siknin said in the name of R. Levi: Great is peace, for all benedictions and prayers conclude with &#x2018;peace&#x2019;. In the case of the benedictions of the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1787">62</xref></sup> one concludes with &#x2018;peace&#x2019;: &#x2018;[Blessed art Thou, O Lord,] Who spreadest the tabernacle of peace&#x2019;;<sup><xref rid="fn1788">63</xref></sup> in the case of prayers<sup><xref rid="fn1789">64</xref></sup> one concludes with &#x2018;peace&#x2019;: &#x2018;[Blessed art Thou, O Lord,] Who makest peace&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn1790">65</xref></sup></p>
<p label="20.">R. Joshua b.

<title>Tractate Gerim</title>
<chapter>
<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<h1><small>JUDAISM AND PROSELYTES</small></h1>
<p>The Hebrew term for a proselyte is <italic>ger</italic>, plural <italic>gerim</italic>. Its original definition is &#x2018;an alien&#x2019; resident in the Holy Land; but when it came to denote a proselyte to Israel&#x2019;s faith, as a consequence of such conversions, the former had to be described differently and he was known as a <italic>ger toshab</italic>, &#x2018;a resident alien&#x2019;.</p>
<p>In the Bible there is abundant evidence that converts were accepted. Apart from the instance of Ruth and what is recorded in Esth. VIII, 17, the legislation mentions them specifically. Ex. XII, 48 directs what is to be done when <italic>a stranger shall sojourn with thee</italic> who wishes to observe the Passover. He must subject himself to the same restrictions as a born Israelite on the Day of Atonement (Lev. XVI, 29). The law concerning defilement by contact with the dead and the rite of purification applied equally to him (Num. XIX, 10). The regulations concerning certain offerings were the same for him as any other member of the community (<italic>ibid.</italic> XV, 14).</p>
<p>The hope that Gentiles will ultimately accept the God of Israel is often expressed. A section of Solomon&#x2019;s prayer at the dedication of the Temple is devoted to them (1 Kings VIII, 41-43). References in the prophetical literature are numerous (cf. Isa. II, 2f., XIV, 1, LVI, 3-6; Jer. III, 17, XII, 16; Zech. XIV, 9).</p>
<p>Contrary to the prevailing idea that post-Biblical Judaism all but excluded proselytes from the community, the evidence proves that an almost unceasing stream of converts swelled the ranks of the Jewish people. The testimony of Philo and Josephus on this point is corroborated by Roman writers like Tacitus and Juvenal (on the whole subject, cf. J.E. X, pp. 220-224, G. F. Moore, <italic>Judaism</italic>, I, pp. 323-353).</p>
<p>Among the Rabbis of the Talmudic era differences of opinion existed on the desirability of accepting converts. On one side is the statement of R. Eleazar, &#x2018;The Holy One, blessed be He, did not exile Israel among the nations save in order that proselytes might join them&#x2019; (Pes. 87b, Sonc. ed., p. 463). At the other extreme is the harsh saying of R. &#x1E24;elbo, &#x2018;Proselytes are as hard for Israel [to endure] as a sore&#x2019; (Yeb. 47b, Sonc. ed., p. 312), playing on the verb in Isa. XIV, 1, <italic>The stranger</italic> [<italic>ger</italic>] <italic>shall ioin himself</italic> [<italic>wenispe&#x1E25;u</italic>] <italic>with them</italic> and the noun <italic>sapa&#x1E25;ath</italic>, &#x2018;a scab&#x2019; in Lev. XIII, 2.</p>
<p>The position is fairly summed up by Professor Moore as follows: &#x2018;Speaking generally the tone of the utterances about proselytes is friendly, though not unduly enthusiastic. This is the more to be noted because the Jews&#x2019; experience with proselytes must at times have been decidedly discouraging. It can hardly be doubted that in perilous times many apostatized. In the outside lands, at least, many went over to Christianity. In the persecution under Hadrian they were under strong temptation to clear their own skirts by turning informers. It would be nothing surprising if under such circumstances the Rabbis should have looked askance at all proselytes. There is, however, little evidence of such a temper&#x2019; (<italic>op. cit.</italic>, p. 342).</p>
<h1><small>THE TRACTATE <italic>GERIM</italic></small></h1>
<p>This work is one of the &#x2018;Seven Minor Tractates&#x2019;. Its material is in the main gathered from what is found in the early Rabbinic sources and the Talmud. Whether the collection was made before or after the redaction of the Talmud is a disputed question (cf. the Editor&#x2019;s Preface).</p>
<p>In its extant form the tractate in all probability dates from the Geonic period. The subject was at that time of more than theoretical or academic interest. Referring to the laws which were enacted prohibiting proselytization by Jews under severe penalties, Professor Moore remarks, &#x2018;Against all such attempts of pagan or Christian rulers to shut up Judaism in itself and prevent its spread, the Jews persisted in their missionary efforts to make the religion God had revealed to their fathers the religion of mankind&#x2019; (<italic>op. cit.</italic>, p. 353). [The existence of <italic>Masseketh Gerim</italic>&#x2014;a manual of the laws relating to converts&#x2014;is in itself a substantiation of this statement.]</p>
<h1><small>ANALYSIS OF THE TRACTATE</small></h1>
<p>Chapter I commences with a full description of the method by which a would-be proselyte is received into the fold. Then, after specifying who is a genuine proselyte, it lays down what is to be done with his wine (and incidentally what is to be done with the food of any <italic>&#x2018;am ha-&#x2019;are&#x1E93;</italic> who becomes a <italic>&#x1E25;aber</italic>), and how far he is exempt from the laws relating to usury and priestly dues.</p>
<p>Chapter II deals with circumcision, lustration and sacrifice as prerequisites for entering into the Israelite covenant, and with the question whether proselytes are called to account for sins committed before their conversion.</p>
<p>Chapter III commences by defining the <italic>ger toshab</italic> and laying down rules for his treatment. It then discusses how far the Jewish laws of consanguinity apply to a proselyte, and gives regulations on what is to be done with the property of a proselyte after his death.</p>
<p>Chapter IV is a Midrashic disquisition on the consideration which should be shown to proselytes and on the favour with which they are regarded by God for following the example of the Patriarch Abraham.</p>

<title>GERIM</title>
<title>CHAPTER I</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. If a man wishes to become a proselyte he is not accepted at once but they<sup><xref rid="fn1796">1</xref></sup> say to him, &#x2018;Why do you want to become a proselyte? Do you not see that this people are debased, oppressed and degraded<sup><xref rid="fn1797">2</xref></sup> more than all other peoples, that diseases and chastisements come upon them and they bury their children and children&#x2019;s children, that they are slaughtered for [observing] circumcision, immersion<sup><xref rid="fn1798">3</xref></sup> and the other precepts [of the Torah] and cannot hold up their heads<sup><xref rid="fn1799">4</xref></sup> like other peoples?&#x2019;</p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. If he says, &#x2018;I am not worthy&#x2019;, they dismiss him and he goes his way.<sup><xref rid="fn1800">5</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. If, however, he undertakes [to become a proselyte], they take him down to the place of immersion, cover him in water up to his middle,<sup><xref rid="fn1801">6</xref></sup> and tell him some of the details of the precepts. [He is informed that he is accepted only] on condition that he will give gleanings, forgotten sheaves, the corner of the field and tithes.<sup><xref rid="fn1802">7</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. As they say this to a man, so they say to a woman that [she is accepted] on condition that she will be particular in regard to <italic>niddah, &#x1E25;allah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1803">8</xref></sup> and the kindling of the Sabbath lamp.</p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. When he has bathed and come up [out of the water], they speak to him words of kindness and comfort<sup><xref rid="fn1804">9</xref></sup> [saying], &#x2018;To Whom are you cleaving? Happy are you&#x0021; [You are cleaving] to Him Who spoke and the world came into being, blessed be He; for the world was created only for the sake of Israel;<sup><xref rid="fn1805">10</xref></sup> only Israel are called &#x201C;sons of God&#x201D;,<sup><xref rid="fn1806">11</xref></sup> and only Israel are [described as] &#x201C;beloved of God&#x201D;.<sup><xref rid="fn1807">12</xref></sup> All the things we have said to you<sup><xref rid="fn1808">13</xref></sup> we have said only to increase your reward&#x2019;.</p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. If a proselyte has been circumcised but has not yet bathed [he is a proselyte]; if he has bathed but not yet been circumcised [he is not yet a proselyte]; everything depends on the circumcision. This is the view of R. Eliezer, but R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: Also<sup><xref rid="fn1809">14</xref></sup> [the lack of] bathing is a bar.</p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>. Anyone who becomes a proselyte for the sake of [marrying a Jewish] woman, or out of fear, or love<sup><xref rid="fn1810">15</xref></sup> is not a proselyte. Similarly R. Judah and R. Nehemiah said: All [the Gentiles] who were converted in the days of Mordecai and Esther were not genuine proselytes, as it is stated, <italic>And many from among the peoples of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews was fallen upon them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1811">16</xref></sup> Anyone who is not converted from purely religious motives<sup><xref rid="fn1812">17</xref></sup> is not a proselyte. [60<italic>b</italic>]</p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>. A man gives immersion to a man, and a woman to a woman but not to a man.</p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>. If a man became a proselyte who had vessels of wine<sup><xref rid="fn1813">18</xref></sup> in his possession and he says, &#x2018;I am positive that none of it has been poured out as a libation&#x2019;, the wine is permitted to him and forbidden to others. R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: <sup><xref rid="fn1814">19</xref></sup>If it is forbidden to others, surely it is forbidden to himself&#x0021; If he says, &#x2018;[The wine has been made] in a state of purity in the presence of So-and-so who is a <italic>&#x1E25;aber</italic>, he is believed&#x2019;.</p>
<p>Similarly should an <italic>&#x2018;am ha-&#x2019;are&#x1E93;</italic> take upon himself to become a <italic>&#x1E25;aber</italic>, and he had food which should be in a state of ritual purity and said, &#x2018;I am positive that it has been prepared in ritual cleanliness&#x2019;, it is permitted to him and forbidden to others. R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: If it is forbidden to others, all the more it is forbidden to himself&#x0021; But if he said, &#x2018;It was prepared in ritual cleanliness in the presence of So-and-so who is a <italic>&#x1E25;aber&#x2019;</italic>, he is believed.<sup><xref rid="fn1815">20</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 10</small>. If an Israelite lends money to a Gentile or a Gentile lends money to an Israelite and he became a proselyte, he collects the principal but not the interest.<sup><xref rid="fn1816">21</xref></sup> R. Judah said: If before conversion he turned the whole into a loan,<sup><xref rid="fn1817">22</xref></sup> he collects the whole.</p>
<p><small>RULE 11</small>. How [is the law]? If a first-born son was born to him before he was converted, he is exempt;<sup><xref rid="fn1818">23</xref></sup> but if after he was converted he is liable; in case of doubt he is exempt. If he had dough ready for baking and a field ready for reaping, until he is converted he is exempt<sup><xref rid="fn1819">24</xref></sup> but from the time he is converted he is liable. If there is doubt he is exempt.</p>

<ftnote id="fn1816">(21) MS.K. reads: &#x2018;One (i.e. the proselyte) takes the capital only (because being now a Jew he may not take interest from a Jew [cf. Lev.

If he was born before his mother [who became a convert] underwent immersion he is circumcised at a day old,<sup><xref rid="fn1821">2</xref></sup> but if after his mother underwent immersion at eight days old.<sup><xref rid="fn1822">3</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. If a proselyte was already circumcised, or if a child was born circumcised, it is necessary to draw from him blood of the covenant,<sup><xref rid="fn1823">4</xref></sup> according to Beth Shammai; but Beth Hillel say that it is not necessary.</p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. R. Mathia b. &#x1E24;eresh said in the name of R. Ishmael:<sup><xref rid="fn1824">5</xref></sup> Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel did not differ on the question of a proselyte who was already circumcised or a child who was born circumcised. On what did they differ? On a child who was born circumcised on the Sabbath. Beth Shammai said: We override the Sabbath on his account to draw from him blood of the covenant, and Beth Hillel said that this is not necessary.<sup><xref rid="fn1825">6</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. If a slave underwent immersion before his master<sup><xref rid="fn1826">7</xref></sup> he becomes free. It is related of Queen Valeria<sup><xref rid="fn1827">8</xref></sup> that some of her slaves underwent immersion before her and some after her, and when the case came before the Sages they said that they who underwent immersion before her were free, but they who underwent immersion after her were still enslaved.</p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. Just as Israel were initiated into the covenant by three precepts, so proselytes are initiated by circumcision, immersion and a sacrifice. [The omission of] the first two debars him [from becoming a proselyte], but [the omission of] the third does not debar him. R. Eliezer [b. Jacob] said: The omission of the sacrifice is also a bar.<sup><xref rid="fn1828">9</xref></sup> This was the ruling of R. Eliezer b. Jacob: A proselyte who becomes a convert is required to set aside a fourth part [of a <italic>dinar</italic>] for his sacrifice of birds;<sup><xref rid="fn1829">10</xref></sup> but R. Simeon says that he is not required to do so.</p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. Proselytes are punished [for their sins before conversion] in the opinion of R. Jose; R. Judah said: He is not punished [61<italic>a</italic>] but is like a new-born child. R. &#x1E24;anina b. Gamaliel said: Why are proselytes afflicted?<sup><xref rid="fn1830">11</xref></sup> Because they calculate a year before or two years before [their conversion], saying, [&#x2018;I shall become a proselyte] when I have collected my debts and when I have finished what I have to do&#x2019;. R. Jose said to him,<sup><xref rid="fn1831">12</xref></sup> &#x2018;If they were to lose money [only as a punishment] you would be right; but they [sometimes] bury their children and grandchildren and sore diseases and chastisements befall them. Why are they afflicted? Because of their [transgression<sup><xref rid="fn1832">13</xref></sup> of] the seven commandments which were given to the descendants of Noah&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn1833">14</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1820">(1) So MS.K. and H. V wrongly, &#x2018;a proselyte is always circumcised at eight days old&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1821">(2) i.e. he is made a proselyte at the earliest moment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1822">(3) Like a child of a Jewish mother.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1823">(4) A slight incision is made to draw a drop of blood.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1824">(5) So MS.K. and H. V has &#x2018;Samuel&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1825">(6) To set the Sabbath aside, and the blood should be drawn on another day. Both Schools agreed that it was necessary to draw the blood of the covenant.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1826">(7) A Gentile who was being made a convert.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1827">(8) [In Yeb. 46a (Sonc. ed., p. 299) &#x2018;Queen&#x2019; is omitted. R.H. 17b (Sonc. ed., p. 70) mentions &#x2018;Valeria the proselyte&#x2019;.] Some of her slaves became Jewesses while she was still a heathen.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER III</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. What is a &#x2018;resident proselyte&#x2019;?<sup><xref rid="fn1834">1</xref></sup> Whoever undertakes to abstain from idolatry, in the view of R. Meir; R. Judah said: Whoever undertakes not to eat flesh that has not been ritually slaughtered.<sup><xref rid="fn1835">2</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. His spittle, his seat, his couch and his urine are unclean; his bread,<sup><xref rid="fn1836">3</xref></sup> his oil and his wine are clean. The prohibitions <italic>thou shalt not do him wrong</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1837">4</xref></sup> <italic>thou shalt not oppress</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1838">5</xref></sup> and <italic>the wages of a hired servant shall not abide with thee all night</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1839">6</xref></sup> apply to him.</p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. We do not marry him [to a Jewess] or take to wife women from him.<sup><xref rid="fn1840">7</xref></sup> We do not lend to him or borrow from him on interest.</p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. We do not settle him on the frontier<sup><xref rid="fn1841">8</xref></sup> or in an unhealthy district, but in a pleasant district in the centre of the Land of Israel,<sup><xref rid="fn1842">9</xref></sup> where he can find scope for his occupation, as it is stated, <italic>With thee he shall dwell in thy midst, in a place which he shall choose in one of thy gates, thou shalt not wrong him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1843">10</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. Every incestuous marriage which is forbidden to Israel under pain of death at the hands of a <italic>Beth Din</italic> is<sup><xref rid="fn1844">11</xref></sup> forbidden to proselytes.</p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. How is this? If he was married to the sister of his mother and her sister from the [same] mother, R. Meir says that he must dismiss her, but the Sages say that he may keep one of them.<sup><xref rid="fn1845">12</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>. An Israelite<sup><xref rid="fn1846">13</xref></sup> who has had intercourse with the daughter of a Gentile is to be tried according to the non-Jewish law, but a Gentile who has had intercourse with the daughter of an Israelite is to be tried according to Jewish law.</p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>. If a proselyte died leaving a son or daughter who became a convert with him, his property is ownerless<sup><xref rid="fn1847">14</xref></sup> and his slaves regain their freedom. If the slaves were minors<sup><xref rid="fn1848">15</xref></sup> they are acquired by &#x2018;drawing&#x2019;,<sup><xref rid="fn1849">16</xref></sup> because [the Sages] said that movable property is acquired by &#x2018;drawing&#x2019; and immovable property by seizure.<sup><xref rid="fn1850">17</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>. R. Eliezer said: [Immovable property] is acquired only by seizure; but if someone was walking in the field [of a proselyte who died] and a man came up to him to whom he said, &#x2018;The field is mine&#x2019;, the field is his; but the Sages say that he does not acquire the property until he has taken possession of it.<sup><xref rid="fn1851">18</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 10</small>. If one man comes from the south and another from the north, each one acquires the part which he traverses. This is the view of R. Eliezer; but the Sages said: Neither acquires until he has taken possession.</p>
<p><small>RULE 11</small>. [If a proselyte died] while liable for his wife&#x2019;s <italic>kethubah</italic> and [the claim of] a creditor and she says, &#x2018;This part of the property belongs to me and this part is due to me under my <italic>kethubah</italic>&#x2019;, she is entitled [to the whole]. If she says, &#x2018;This part is due to me under my <italic>kethubah</italic> and this part belongs to me&#x2019;, she is entitled only to her <italic>kethubah</italic>.</p>
<p><small>RULE 12</small>. Similarly, if a creditor says, &#x2018;This part belongs to me and that part is for my debt&#x2019;, he is entitled [to the whole]; but if he says, &#x2018;This part is for my debt and that part belongs to me&#x2019;, he is entitled only to his debt.</p>
<p><small>RULE 13</small>. If he had slaves pasturing a flock<sup><xref rid="fn1852">19</xref></sup> and someone came and said, &#x2018;These slaves and the flock are mine&#x2019;, they are his; but if the slaves are shrewd they can say, &#x2018;We are free men and the flock belongs to us&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn1853">20</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1834">(1) Heb. <italic>ger toshab</italic> as distinguished from <italic>ger &#x1E93;ede&#x1E33;</italic>, &#x2018;a righteous proselyte&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1835">(2) According to &#x2018;A.Z. 64b (Sonc. ed., p. 314) a <italic>ger toshab</italic> is defined as one who undertook to keep all the commandments except the prohibition against eating flesh not ritually slaughtered, and perhaps that should be the reading here.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1836">(3) So MS.K. and H; V &#x2018;his dough&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1837">(4) Lev. XIX, 33.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1838">(5) Deut. XXIV, 14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1839">(6) Lev. XIX, 13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1840">(7) Those within the category of <italic>ger toshab</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1841">(8) [Where he would be exposed to attack, or by intercourse with foreign neighbours lapse into heathenism.]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1842">(9) The words &#x2018;in the centre of the Land of Israel&#x2019; are superfluous and should perhaps be omitted.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1843">(10) Deut. XXIII, 17.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1844">(11) So MS.K. V and H insert &#x2018;not&#x2019;. [The question is debated in Sanh. 57b-58a (Sonc. ed., p. 393).]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1845">(12) This is the lit. rendering of V, which is hopelessly corrupt. MS.K. and H read: &#x2018;How is this? If he was married to the sister of his father from the same father or the sister of his father from the same mother, R. Meir says that he must dismiss her, but the Sages say that he may keep her. [If he has married] two sisters from the same mother, R. Meir says that he must dismiss both, but the Sages say that he must dismiss one of them&#x2019;. The instance here adduced has nothing to do with the statement which precedes. In Sanh. <italic>loc. cit.</italic> it is adduced as an illustration of the statement that &#x2018;a proselyte whose conception was not in holiness, but whose birth was in holiness (i.e. after his mother&#x2019;s conversion) is forbidden to his mother&#x2019;s relatives but not to his father&#x2019;s&#x2019;. In that case, however, we should certainly have to read here, &#x2018;if he had married his father&#x2019;s sister from the same father he may keep her, but if from the same mother, R. Meir says&#x2019;, etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1846">(13) This is an obvious mistake for &#x2018;a Gentile&#x2019;. [Cf. Sanh. 57b (Sonc. ed., p. 393) where it is explicitly stated.]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1847">(14) [There is nothing in V corresponding to &#x2018;is ownerless&#x2019; which is required by the context. MS.K. and H insert &#x2018;is like the deer&#x2019;, i.e. free, ownerless.]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1848">(15) [This is the reading suggested by N.Y.; V, MS.K. and H have &#x2018;shrewd&#x2019;. This version agrees with &#x1E32;id. 23a (Sonc. ed., p. 110): &#x2018;If a proselyte dies [without heirs] adult slaves acquire their freedom, but as for minors, whoever takes possession of them gains a title to them&#x2019;.]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1849">(16) [&#x2018;Taking possession by drawing towards one&#x2019;s self the object to be acquired&#x2019; (Jastrow).]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1850">(17) [This is the correct reading as against V&#x2019;s &#x2018;the Sages said that movable property is acquired by seizure&#x2019;. Cf. &#x1E32;id. I, 5 (Sonc. ed., p. 124). &#x2018;Movable property&#x2019; is lit. &#x2018;property which has no security&#x2019;, i.e. on which a creditor cannot distrain if sold; &#x2018;immovable property&#x2019;, on the other hand, like real estate, can be mortgaged for the owner&#x2019;s debts.]</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER IV</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. <italic>And a stranger</italic> [<italic>ger</italic>] <italic>shalt thou not wrong, neither shalt thou oppress him:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1854">1</xref></sup> you shall not <italic>wrong</italic> him in speech or <italic>oppress</italic> him in money dealings. Do not say to him,<sup><xref rid="fn1855">2</xref></sup> &#x2018;Yesterday you were worshipping Bel, &#x1E32;ores and Nebo, and till now pig&#x2019;s flesh was between your teeth, and now you stand up and speak with me&#x0021;&#x2019; And whence [do I learn] [not] to <italic>wrong</italic> him? He can retort, <italic>For ye were strangers in the land of Egypt?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1856">3</xref></sup> Hence R. Nathan used to say: Do not taunt your neighbour with the blemish which you yourself have.<sup><xref rid="fn1857">4</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. R. Eliezer b. Jacob said: Because [the proselyte&#x2019;s] original nature was evil,<sup><xref rid="fn1858">5</xref></sup> Scripture gave many warnings in connection with him, as it is stated, <italic>And a stranger shalt thou not wrong, neither shalt thou oppress him; for ye know the heart of a stranger</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1859">6</xref></sup> Hence because his original nature was evil, Scripture gave many warnings concerning him.</p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. Beloved are proselytes [by God], for [Scripture] everywhere uses the same epithets of them as of Israel; [61<italic>b</italic>] as it is stated, <italic>But thou, Israel, My servant, Jacob whom I have chosen</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1860">7</xref></sup> The term &#x2018;love&#x2019; is applied to Israel, as it is stated, <italic>I have loved you, saith the Lord</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1861">8</xref></sup> and the term &#x2018;love&#x2019; is applied to proselytes, as it is stated, <italic>And He loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1862">9</xref></sup> Israel are called &#x2018;servants&#x2019;, as it is stated, <italic>For unto Me the children of Israel are servants</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1863">10</xref></sup> and proselytes are called &#x2018;servants&#x2019;, as it is stated, <italic>To be His servants</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1864">11</xref></sup> The term &#x2018;acceptable&#x2019; is used of Israel, as it is stated, <italic>And it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before the Lord</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1865">12</xref></sup> and the term &#x2018;acceptable&#x2019; is used of proselytes, as it is stated, <italic>Their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be acceptable upon Mine altar</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1866">13</xref></sup> The term &#x2018;keeping&#x2019; is applied to Israel, as it is stated, <italic>The Lord is thy keeper, the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1867">14</xref></sup> and the term &#x2018;keeping&#x2019; is applied to proselytes, as it is stated, <italic>The Lord preserveth the strangers</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1868">15</xref></sup> The term &#x2018;ministering&#x2019; is applied to Israel, as it is stated, <italic>But ye shall be named the priests of the Lord, men shall call you the ministers of our God</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1869">16</xref></sup> and the term &#x2018;ministering&#x2019; is applied to proselytes, as it is stated, <italic>Also the aliens, that join themselves to the Lord, to minister unto Him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1870">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Beloved are proselytes seeing that our father Abraham did not circumcise himself when he was twenty or thirty years of age, but when he was ninety-nine years old;<sup><xref rid="fn1871">18</xref></sup> since if he had circumcised himself when he was twenty or thirty years old, no Gentile would have become a proselyte when he had passed the age of twenty or thirty. The Holy One, blessed be He, kept putting it off<sup><xref rid="fn1872">19</xref></sup> until he had reached ninety-nine years, so as not to close the door in the face of proselytes, [and to allow more days and years so as to increase the reward of those who do His will, as it is stated, <italic>The Lord was pleased, for His righteousness&#x2019; sake, to make the teaching great and glorious</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn1873">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our father Abraham called himself a <italic>ger</italic>, as it is stated, <italic>I am a stranger</italic> [<italic>ger</italic>] <italic>and a sojourner with you</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1874">21</xref></sup> Similarly David, king of Israel, called himself a <italic>ger</italic>, as it is stated, <italic>For I am a stranger</italic> [<italic>ger</italic>] <italic>with Thee</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1875">22</xref></sup> and likewise it states, <italic>For we are strangers before Thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1876">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Beloved is the Land of Israel because it makes proselytes fit [to be received]. If a man says in the Land of Israel, &#x2018;I am a proselyte&#x2019;, he is accepted at once, but outside the Land of Israel he is not accepted unless his witnesses are with him. Beloved is the Land of Israel because it atones for iniquities and transgressions, as it is stated, <italic>And the inhabitant shall not say: &#x2018;I am sick&#x2019;, the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1877">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>And so you find in the four classes that stand before the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is stated, <italic>One shall say: &#x2018;I am the Lord&#x2019;s&#x2019;; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the Lord, and surname himself by the name of Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1878">25</xref></sup> <italic>One shall say: &#x2018;I am the Lord&#x2019;s&#x2019;</italic>&#x2014;this alludes to one who belongs wholly to the Omnipresent and has no admixture of sin. <italic>Another shall call himself by the name of Jacob</italic>&#x2014;this alludes to the proselytes of righteousness.<sup><xref rid="fn1879">26</xref></sup> <italic>Another shall subscribe with his hand unto the Lord</italic>&#x2014;this alludes to those who repent. <italic>And surname himself by the name of Israel</italic>&#x2014;this alludes to those who fear Heaven.</p>

<title>Tractate Kutim</title>
<chapter>
<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<h1><small>THE SAMARITANS</small></h1>
<p>The people named in the Bible <italic>Kuthim</italic> are the descendants&#x2014;actual or supposed&#x2014;of the immigrants who were settled by Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, in the region of Samaria when he drove the Northern Kingdom into exile and who adopted the way of life of the Israelites (cf. 2 Kings XVII, 24ff.). After the Jews returned from Babylon, the question arose in an acute form whether the <italic>Kuthim</italic> should be regarded as members of the community in view of their claim to share in rebuilding the Temple. [For a critical inquiry into the origins of this people, cf. J. A. Montgomery, <italic>The Samaritans</italic>, 1907, and for an account of them cf. J.E. X, pp. 669-681.]</p>
<h1><small>TRACTATE <italic>KUTHIM</italic></small></h1>
<p>Not until the third century <small>C.E.</small> was the decision finally taken to treat the Samaritans as Gentiles although they had adopted many Jewish rites. Inasmuch as this tractate evidently presupposes that the question was still open, it must have been compiled in its original form before then. This view seems to be confirmed by the favourable attitude which the tractate generally adopts towards them; but there are traces of later additions in accordance with the change in the relationship between the two communities.</p>
<p>[Much of the material contained in the tractate is culled from Talmudic sources. The conclusion of Montgomery is: &#x2018;Most of the independent <italic>halakoth</italic> are favourable to them, and so may be presumed to be discarded Baraithoth. On the other hand, the <italic>halakoth</italic> which have been bodily applied to the Samaritans from the law concerning the Gentiles, testify to the later practical identification of the two classes&#x2019; (<italic>op. cit.</italic>, pp. 196f.).]</p>
<h1><small>CONTENTS OF THE TRACTATE</small></h1>
<p>It begins by laying down the principle that while in most respects Samaritans are on the same footing as Jews, in some they are on the same footing as heathens; and it proceeds to give a number of rules for regulating Jewish intercourse with them. These rules relate to the Temple Service, to the right to gleanings, etc., to the observance of tithe and <italic>&#x2018;erub</italic>, to social and business relationship with them and to their reliability as witnesses.</p>
<p>Chapter II deals chiefly with the permissibility of various Samaritan foods, such as meat and cheese, and with the status of Samaritan priests; also with the position of Samaritans in the matter of legal penalties and damages. It concludes with explaining why they have been forbidden to intermarry with the Israelites and how they may one day obtain acceptance into the fold.</p>

<title>KUTHIM</title>
<title>CHAPTER I</title>
<p label="1.">The Samaritans in some of their ways resemble the Gentiles and in some resemble Israel, but in the majority they resemble Israel.</p>
<p label="2.">We do not accept from them for offering [in the Temple] sacrificial birds brought by males with a flux,<sup><xref rid="fn1880">1</xref></sup> or sacrificial birds brought by females with a flux,<sup><xref rid="fn1881">2</xref></sup> or sacrificial birds brought by women after childbirth,<sup><xref rid="fn1882">3</xref></sup> or sin-offerings or trespass-offerings, but we receive from them vows and free-will-offerings.<sup><xref rid="fn1883">4</xref></sup></p>
<p label="3.">We do not transfer to them anything attached to the soil,<sup><xref rid="fn1884">5</xref></sup> or sell to them sheep to shear, or crops to reap<sup><xref rid="fn1885">6</xref></sup> or trees attached to the soil,<sup><xref rid="fn1886">7</xref></sup> but we sell them animals to slaughter.</p>
<p label="4.">We do not sell them large cattle even if they are mutilated, or foals or calves;<sup><xref rid="fn1887">8</xref></sup> but we may sell them a mutilated animal which can never recover.<sup><xref rid="fn1888">9</xref></sup></p>
<p label="5.">We do not sell them weapons of war or anything which can cause injury to the public.</p>
<p label="6.">We do not give to them [Israelite women] in marriage or take wives from them,<sup><xref rid="fn1889">10</xref></sup> but we lend to them and borrow from them on interest.<sup><xref rid="fn1890">11</xref></sup></p>
<p label="7.">We give them gleanings, forgotten sheaves and the corner of the field;<sup><xref rid="fn1891">12</xref></sup> they too observe [gleanings], forgotten sheaves and the corner of the field,<sup><xref rid="fn1892">13</xref></sup> and their word can be taken in regard to gleanings, forgotten sheaves and the corner of the field in their season and in regard to the tithe of the poor in its year.<sup><xref rid="fn1893">14</xref></sup> Their produce is reckoned as <italic>&#x1E6D;ebel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1894">15</xref></sup> like the produce of Gentiles, and they make the <italic>&#x2018;erub</italic> ineffective like Gentiles.<sup><xref rid="fn1895">16</xref></sup></p>
<p label="8.">An Israelite woman should not act as midwife to a Samaritan woman or suckle her child;<sup><xref rid="fn1896">17</xref></sup> but a Samaritan woman can act as midwife to an Israelite woman and suckle her child on her premises.</p>
<p label="9.">An Israelite may circumcise a Samaritan and a Samaritan can circumcise an Israelite. R. Judah said: A Samaritan may not circumcise an Israelite because he only circumcises him in the name of Mount Gerizim.<sup><xref rid="fn1897">18</xref></sup></p>
<p label="10.">We may stall an animal in the inn of a Samaritan, and [an Israelite] may hire a Samaritan to follow his beast. He may also entrust his cattle to a Samaritan shepherd,<sup><xref rid="fn1898">19</xref></sup> and he may entrust his son to a Samaritan to teach him a trade.<sup><xref rid="fn1899">20</xref></sup> We may associate with them and converse<sup><xref rid="fn1900">21</xref></sup> with them in any place, which is not so with Gentiles.<sup><xref rid="fn1901">22</xref></sup></p>
<p label="11.">He performs <italic>&#x1E25;ali&#x1E93;ah</italic> for his sister-in-law and gives a <italic>ge&#x1E6D;</italic> to his wife, and a Samaritan may be relied on to bring a <italic>ge&#x1E6D;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1902">23</xref></sup> from foreign countries to Israel.</p>
<p label="12.">These are the things which we do not sell them: animals which died of themselves or have been improperly slaughtered, animals forbidden [to an Israelite] as food,<sup><xref rid="fn1903">24</xref></sup> reptiles,<sup><xref rid="fn1904">25</xref></sup> a shoe made from the skin of an animal which died of itself,<sup><xref rid="fn1905">26</xref></sup> oil into which a mouse has fallen,<sup><xref rid="fn1906">27</xref></sup> or [the flesh of] a <italic>koskos</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1907">28</xref></sup> or of an embryo. Although Israelites eat a <italic>koskos</italic> and an embryo we do not sell them to the Samaritans, because such a sale would be under false pretences. And just as we do not sell these to them so we do not buy these from them, as it is stated <italic>For thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1908">29</xref></sup>&#x2014;since thou art holy, thou must not make another people holier than thyself.<sup><xref rid="fn1909">30</xref></sup></p>
<p label="13.">A Samaritan may be trusted if he says that he has buried [a miscarriage] or not buried it,<sup><xref rid="fn1910">31</xref></sup> and, with regard to an animal, that it has brought forth its first-born<sup><xref rid="fn1911">32</xref></sup> or not brought forth. A Samaritan may be trusted with regard to the plantation of the fourth year and uncircumcised fruit<sup><xref rid="fn1912">33</xref></sup> and grave-signs,<sup><xref rid="fn1913">34</xref></sup> but not with regard to overhanging boughs, protruding stones,<sup><xref rid="fn1914">35</xref></sup> land of the peoples,<sup><xref rid="fn1915">36</xref></sup> or a <italic>beth peras</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1916">37</xref></sup> because they are suspected [of carelessness] in these matters. The general principle is that in regard to matters in which they are suspected [of carelessness] they are not trusted.</p>

<title>CHAPTER II</title>
<p label="1.">We do not buy meat from a Samaritan butcher except that of which he is prepared himself to eat, nor [do we buy from him] baskets of birds unless he first puts them in his mouth.<sup><xref rid="fn1917">1</xref></sup> He must not give them to an Israelite to eat, since the Samaritans have from of old been suspected of giving Israelites carrion to eat.</p>
<p label="2.">The Samaritan is on the same footing as an Israelite in regard to all damages mentioned in the Torah. Whether an Israelite kills a Samaritan or a Samaritan kills an Israelite, if he did it by inadvertence he goes into exile [to a City of Refuge], if wilfully he is put to death. If the ox of an Israelite gored the ox of a Samaritan he is exempt from damages;<sup><xref rid="fn1918">2</xref></sup> but should the ox of a Samaritan have gored the ox of an Israelite, if the ox is <italic>tam</italic> he pays half the damage and if it is <italic>mu&#x2018;ad</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1919">3</xref></sup> he pays the whole damage. R. Meir said: If an ox of a Samaritan gores the ox of an Israelite, whether it is <italic>tam</italic> or <italic>mu&#x2018;ad</italic> the owner pays the whole damage and pays from his best possessions.<sup><xref rid="fn1920">4</xref></sup></p>
<p label="3.">Their cheeses are permitted. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: Those of private persons are permitted, but those of wholesalers<sup><xref rid="fn1921">5</xref></sup> are forbidden. Their cooked and preserved vegetables, into which they usually put wine or vinegar,<sup><xref rid="fn1922">6</xref></sup> are forbidden.</p>
<p label="4.">Israelite priests<sup><xref rid="fn1923">7</xref></sup> share with Samaritan priests in the latters&#x2019; districts because they, as it were, rescue [the produce] from their hands, but not in Israelite districts lest [Jews appear to] confirm their priesthood. If a Samaritan priest offers from what he is eating to an Israelite, should [the priest] be unclean it is permissible, but if clean it is forbidden.<sup><xref rid="fn1924">8</xref></sup></p>
<p label="5.">We do not buy [bread] from a Samaritan baker on the outgoing of Passover until after three bakings [have been made], or from private persons until three weeks have passed, or from the villages until after three bakings.<sup><xref rid="fn1925">9</xref></sup> When does this apply? When they have not prepared their unleavened bread together with Israelites or they observed Passover one day earlier; but if they baked their unleavened bread together with Israelites or observed Passover one day later, their leaven is permitted. R. Simeon forbids it because they do not know how to observe the law of unleavened bread like the Israelites.</p>
<p label="6.">At first they said: The wine of Gedor is forbidden on account of the wine of Kfar Paggasha.<sup><xref rid="fn1926">10</xref></sup> Later they revised this rule and said: Wherever [Samaritans] are suspected because of their mingling with Gentiles, if [their wine is] in an open [vessel] it is forbidden,<sup><xref rid="fn1927">11</xref></sup> and if in a closed [vessel] it is permitted. R. Meir said: All their wine is permitted except that which is in open [vessels for sale] in the markets; but the Sages said: In an open [vessel] it is everywhere forbidden and in a closed [vessel] permitted, while [a vessel] which has been pierced and then sealed is like one which is sealed. Their jars when new are permitted but when old are forbidden.<sup><xref rid="fn1928">12</xref></sup></p>
<p label="7.">Why are Samaritans forbidden to enter the Jewish community? Because they have become mixed up with the priests of the high places. R. Ishmael said: They were originally genuine proselytes. Why, then, are they forbidden? Because of the illegitimate females<sup><xref rid="fn1929">13</xref></sup> and because they do not perform the levirate duty to a married woman.<sup><xref rid="fn1930">14</xref></sup> When may they be received into the Jewish community? When they have renounced Mount Gerizim and acknowledged Jerusalem and the resurrection of the dead.<sup><xref rid="fn1931">15</xref></sup> From then onwards one who robs a Samaritan is like one who robs an Israelite. [62<italic>a</italic>]</p>
<ftnote id="fn1917">(1) [&#x1E24;ul. 4a (Sonc. ed., p. 10) reads: &#x2018;[The Israelite] cuts off the head of one of the birds and gives it to the Samaritan; if he ate it, then we may eat of his slaughtering&#x2019;.]</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1921">(5) H reads &#x2018;those of the villages&#x2019;. [The reason is that these cheeses are made for sale, and the makers are not particular to enclose them in skins of ritually clean animals.]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1922">(6) [Cf. <italic>Gerim</italic> I, 9, n. 18.]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1923">(7) About the time of Alexander the Great, the Samaritans built a temple on Mount Gerizim and a number of priests from Jerusalem, including a High Priest, went and ministered there. They were disowned by the Judeans.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1924">(8) The Samaritan priest, if unclean, would not eat <italic>terumah</italic>, and therefore the Israelite may eat what he was eating.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<h1><small>JUDAISM AND SLAVERY</small></h1>
<p>[Although civilized man today thinks of the institution of slavery with horror, it seems to have originated in a humanitarian motive based on utilitarianism. It was a moral advance on the practice of the victor putting the vanquished to death. Indeed the Latin word <italic>servus</italic> has been derived from <italic>servare</italic>, &#x2018;to preserve&#x2019;, as denoting a person who was not given over to general slaughter (cf. W. E. H. Lecky, <italic>History of European Morals</italic>, 1911, I, p. 102 n.).</p>
<p>In the economy of the ancient world slavery was indispensable, and Israel was no exception to the peoples who adopted it. But in this connection Israel was exceptional at least in one respect. Among the Romans and Greeks, e.g., the treatment of slaves varied in different periods. Not always was the master allowed to exercise power of life and death over them. Moralists arose who protested vehemently against the cruelties from which they suffered; but generally the lot of the slave was degraded in the extreme and his existence embittered.</p>
<p>With the people of Israel, on the other hand, the slave was never a mere chattel at the mercy of his master&#x2019;s whims, and the legislation which affected him uniformly treated him as a human being. It is true that the Hebrew who sold himself for a term of servitude from straitened circumstances or was sold to earn the money wherewith to refund a theft, bore a stigma. The heathen slave, likewise, belonged to an inferior class. Nevertheless the Hebrew term which described them both, <italic>&#x2018;ebed</italic>, was far from being derogatory. On the contrary, it was a dignified term since the Patriarchs, Moses, kings and prophets were designated &#x2018; <italic>&#x2018;ebed</italic> of God&#x2019; and the phrase was applied to the whole community of Israel. It must be remembered that all the essential services of social life were regarded by the Israelites as honourable, and they who performed them were invested with a degree of dignity.</p>
<p>A consequence of this was that the slave in an Israelite household was not the exact counterpart of the slave in a heathen household. On the subject in general, cf. J.E. XI, pp. 403-408, G. F. Moore, <italic>Judaism</italic>, II, pp. 135-138, A. Cohen, <italic>Everyman&#x2019;s Talmud</italic>, 1949, pp. 198-203, L. Baeck, <italic>The Essence of Judaism</italic>, 1936, pp. 203-207.</p>
<p>The last-mentioned authority remarks: &#x2018;In the Greek and Roman world, to say nothing of the old eastern states ruled by despots, the slave was considered to be a <italic>thing</italic>; he was not a subject of the law, but merely an object of the law. In the <italic>corpus juris</italic> he belonged to the chapter devoted to the law of things. To the Israelite law the slave is a person entitled to rights, one who stands before his master with definite legal claims. The master is therefore not considered to be the owner of the slave, but only his possessor. He has not a full and unlimited freedom of dealing with him, but merely a restricted and conditional power of disposal over him. It is thus established that serfdom is not a relationship which has its foundations in the general order of law, incorporating acknowledged rights, but that it is merely a temporary form of domestic service. Thus the principle of slavery is thereby destroyed&#x2019; (<italic>op. cit.</italic>, p. 205). He concludes his discussion of the subject with the statement: &#x2018;Slavery, in the real sense of the word, did not exist among the Jews. Israel was the only community to possess a civilization which did not rest upon the shoulders of slaves, and thus created for the first time a truly ethical civilization&#x2019; (<italic>op. cit.</italic>, p. 207).]</p>
<h1><small>TRACTATE <italic>&#x2018;ABADIM</italic></small></h1>
<p>[Since the legislation of the Torah deals with the status and rights of slaves, and in Rabbinic times some Jews possessed them, the subject is included in the discussions of the Talmud. Whether the compilation which forms this tractate was made early or late can hardly be determined with certainty.</p>
<p>If the passage which is found in the Kirchheim MS. (cf. III, 4, n. 8) but omitted in the printed editions is authentic, it would be evidence in favour of an early date because it displays an intimate knowledge of the Roman forms of manumission which would have been more familiar to the Jews then than in the Geonic period. On the other hand, I. H. Weiss, <italic>Dor Dor weDoreshaw</italic>, 1904, II, p. 224, adduces an instance where the tractate presents an amalgam of two early Baraithoth in the <italic>Mekilta</italic> which is clearly the work of a later hand. There is the possibility that the original collection of material was made in the earlier Rabbinic era and in its extant form was edited in the Geonic period.]</p>
<h1><small>CONTENTS OF THE TRACTATE</small></h1>
<p>The first chapter deals mainly with the various circumstances in which a Hebrew bondman, and more particularly a Hebrew bondwoman, obtains his or her release. It also contains a brief digression on the Jubilee.</p>
<p>Chapter II deals first with the treatment due to a Hebrew bondman from his Jewish master and the &#x2018;parting gifts&#x2019; which have to be presented to him at the end of his period of service. It then describes the method of his redemption from a non-Jewish master, and the conditions under which an Israelite may be sold for theft.</p>
<p>The first half of chapter III specifies which Jewish bondmen may continue in service after their period of six years, and describes the ceremony of boring through the ear of such a one. The second half lays down the rules for the acquisition and liberation of a Canaanite (i.e. heathen) slave.</p>
<p>[In V the text of each chapter is continuous. In the present translation it has been divided into paragraphs and numbered in agreement with Higger&#x2019;s edition.]</p>

Ishmael said: For that reason it is stated, <italic>As a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest&#x2019;s</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1937">6</xref></sup>&#x2014;as possession [depends] on the Jubilee, so a field which had been devoted [depends] on the Jubilee.<sup><xref rid="fn1938">7</xref></sup> The Jubilee is on the same footing as the New Year in regard to the blowing [of the <italic>shofar</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn1939">8</xref></sup> and the benedictions,<sup><xref rid="fn1940">9</xref></sup> except that [the blowing of] the <italic>shofar</italic> on the Jubilee overrides the Sabbath.<sup><xref rid="fn1941">9a</xref></sup> When did the Jubilees cease [to be observed]? From the time when Pul and Tiglath-pileser, kings of Assyria, came up and carried the Reubenites, the Gaddites and half the tribe of Manasseh into captivity.<sup><xref rid="fn1942">10</xref></sup></p>
<p label="2."><sup><xref rid="fn1943">11</xref></sup> A Hebrew slave is acquired by money purchase or by document, and he acquires his freedom by years of service,<sup><xref rid="fn1944">12</xref></sup> through the advent of the Jubilee<sup><xref rid="fn1945">13</xref></sup> and by deduction of money.<sup><xref rid="fn1946">14</xref></sup> The Hebrew handmaid has an advantage over him in that she acquires her freedom by the signs [of puberty]. The <italic>nir&#x1E93;a&#x2018;</italic> is acquired by the boring [of his ear] and acquires his freedom through [the advent of] the Jubilee or through the death of his master.</p>
<p label="3.">If a man writes a document of divorce for his handmaid,<sup><xref rid="fn1947">15</xref></sup> R. &#x1E24;anina b. Gamaliel says that she does not become free, but the Sages say that she does become free. If he said to her,<sup><xref rid="fn1948">16</xref></sup> &#x2018;Behold, you are free&#x2019;, the Sages say that she does not become free.</p>
<p>[4. If one who is about to die says, &#x2018;My slave So-and-so is free&#x2019;, then he is free. If he wrote a deed of manumission for him, &#x2018;Behold this [slave] is free&#x2019;, the latter should have concern.]<sup><xref rid="fn1949">17</xref></sup></p>
<p label="5.">A man may sell his daughter from one servitude to another,<sup><xref rid="fn1950">18</xref></sup> and from one matrimony to another and from servitude to matrimony, but not from matrimony to servitude. [R. Simeon said: He may not sell her from one servitude to another, much less from matrimony to servitude.]<sup><xref rid="fn1951">19</xref></sup></p>
<p label="6.">If a man sells his daughter on condition of her not being betrothed by the master, his sale is valid but his condition is void, because he made a condition overriding what is written in the Torah,<sup><xref rid="fn1952">20</xref></sup> and whoever makes a condition which overrides a prescription of the Torah [does something which] is void.</p>
<p label="7.">If the father wants to betroth her and the son wants to betroth her, the father takes precedence. If the son wants to betroth her and the father to redeem her, the son takes precedence, because the precept of betrothing takes precedence over the precept of redeeming, as it is stated, <italic>Who hath espoused her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1953">20a</xref></sup> Two must not be betrothed together.<sup><xref rid="fn1954">21</xref></sup></p>
<p label="8.">A brother<sup><xref rid="fn1955">22</xref></sup> must not betroth her. [This had to be mentioned] because it might have been argued: Seeing that the son who does not take the place of his father to act as levir may betroth her, does it not stand to reason that one who takes the place of his brother to act as levir should betroth her&#x0021; Hence [the Torah] states, <italic>And if he espouse her unto his son</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1956">23</xref></sup> thus excluding the brother.</p>
<p label="9.">If he betrothed her at the end of the [six] years [of bondage], should she still be in his possession<sup><xref rid="fn1957">24</xref></sup> she is betrothed, according to the view of R. Simeon b. Eleazar, and if not she is not betrothed. The Sages, however, say that as long as she is in his possession<sup><xref rid="fn1958">25</xref></sup> she is betrothed, since that was the condition on which he paid the money [for her] at the beginning.<sup><xref rid="fn1959">26</xref></sup></p>
<p label="10.">If a man sells his daughter and then went and betrothed her to another, he made game of the master<sup><xref rid="fn1960">27</xref></sup> according to R. Jose b. Judah; but the Sages say that he has done nothing.<sup><xref rid="fn1961">28</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1932">(1) An Israelite, according to the Rabbis, could become a slave either through being sold by the <italic>Beth Din</italic> to make restitution for a theft or through selling himself for a livelihood.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1933">(2) Because he refused to go free after six years&#x2019; service (Ex. XXI, 5f.; Deut. XV, 16f.).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1934">(3) This apparently means, so long as the years from one Jubilee to the next are being officially counted, as laid down in Lev. XXV, 8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1935">(4) Cf. <italic>ibid.</italic> XXVII, 16-21. A &#x2018;field of possession&#x2019; is one that has been inherited as distinct from a &#x2018;field of purchase&#x2019;.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER II</title>
<p label="1.">A Hebrew slave does work by day but not by night. R. Jose said: It all depends on his occupation. All agree that [the master] should not teach him to be a dyer, a butcher, or a baker for the public.<sup><xref rid="fn1962">1</xref></sup> He should not carry him to the privy or carry his clothes before him to the bath-house or gird his loins for him,<sup><xref rid="fn1963">2</xref></sup> massage or anoint him.</p>
<p label="2.">He eats the same food and drinks the same drink [as his master]; he sits at meals with him<sup><xref rid="fn1964">3</xref></sup> even if his stomach is full.<sup><xref rid="fn1965">4</xref></sup> If he is beaten or falls ill, [the master] does not reckon the time of his idleness,<sup><xref rid="fn1966">5</xref></sup> but if [the slave] runs away and returns, he does reckon the time when he was not working.</p>
<p label="3.">[An Israelite] may not sell himself in order to obtain clothing or bedding, but he may sell himself to maintain himself alive.</p>
<p label="4.">When [the slave] has completed his term of years, he must not be sent away empty-handed, as it is written, <italic>And when thou lettest him go free from thee, thou shalt not let him go empty; thou shalt furnish him liberally</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1967">6</xref></sup> R. Eleazar b. Azariah says: If the house is blessed on his account he is furnished liberally, but otherwise not. R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba says: In either case [the master] should not give him less than fifty <italic>zuz</italic>. We give him as parting gifts anything except slaves, documents and immovable property.<sup><xref rid="fn1968">7</xref></sup> Both a man and woman [owner is under the obligation to give parting gifts] but only a man can acquire a Hebrew slave while a woman cannot acquire a [male] Hebrew slave.</p>
<p label="5.">Two slaves should not be bought together, [so that a public sale should not be made with two slaves].<sup><xref rid="fn1969">7a</xref></sup></p>
<p label="6.">One who sells himself, one who runs away and one who gains his liberty by deduction of money does not receive parting gifts.</p>
<p label="7.">He who is sold for committing a theft should not be sold either in the market-place or in a bazaar, as it is stated, <italic>For unto Me the children of Israel are servants</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1970">8</xref></sup></p>
<p label="8.">If [an Israelite] sells himself to Gentiles, his relatives and the <italic>Beth Din</italic> are commanded to redeem him, but he is not commanded to redeem himself, as it is stated, <italic>One of his brethren shall redeem him; or his uncle or his uncle&#x2019;s son shall redeem him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1971">9</xref></sup> For R. Ishmael used to say: Seeing that others are commanded to redeem him must he not be commanded to redeem himself? [And if you ask] what do I make of the words, <italic>Or if he be waxen rich, he shall redeem himself?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1972">10</xref></sup> [The meaning is,] that just as if he redeems himself he does not return to servitude, so if others redeem him he does not return to servitude.<sup><xref rid="fn1973">11</xref></sup> R. Jose the Galilean said: If the <italic>Beth Din</italic> [sell him he returns] to servitude,<sup><xref rid="fn1974">12</xref></sup> but if relatives [redeem him it is] for his freedom; while R. &#x2018; A&#x1E33;iba said: If the <italic>Beth Din</italic> [redeem him it is] for his freedom but if relatives [redeem him he returns] to servitude.</p>
<p label="9.">If he stole two hundred [<italic>zuz</italic>] and his valuation<sup><xref rid="fn1975">13</xref></sup> is only a <italic>maneh</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1976">14</xref></sup> he is sold and sold again.<sup><xref rid="fn1977">15</xref></sup> If he stole a <italic>maneh</italic> and his valuation is two hundred <italic>zuz</italic> he is not to be sold.<sup><xref rid="fn1978">16</xref></sup> R. Eliezer said: In no case should he be sold unless his sale price and the amount of his theft are equal. He cannot be sold and sold again for the same theft and he returns [after his servitude] to the rank which he formerly held. This is the view of R. Meir; but R. Judah said: He does not return to the rank which he formerly held.<sup><xref rid="fn1979">17</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1962">(1) But he can serve him privately in these capacities. MS.K. and H add &#x2018;or a money-changer to the public&#x2019;.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1969">(7a) The words in brackets are added by MS.K. The term <italic>&#x1E6D;umaria</italic>, translated &#x2018;public sale&#x2019;, is obscure but it seems to indicate that too much publicity attaches to the sale of two slaves at once.

To make sense of this passage we must read &#x2018;he is [also] commanded to redeem himself&#x2019; instead of &#x2018;but he is not commanded to redeem himself&#x2019;. R. Ishmael learns this by <italic>a fortiori</italic> reasoning and uses the verse <italic>or if he be waxen rich</italic>, etc., from which it might be learnt that he need not sell himself again in order to repay those who have redeemed him.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1976">(14) A hundred <italic>zuz</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1977">(15) Each time for his valuation of one hundred <italic>zuz</italic>. [The correct reading is probably &#x2018;not sold again&#x2019;, cf. &#x1E32;id. 18a (Sonc. ed., p. 82, n. 3.)]</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1979">(17) [Cf. the discussion in Mak. 13a (Sonc. ed., p. 89).

<p label="1.">The <italic>nir&#x1E93;a&#x2018;</italic> should not have his ear pierced until he declares and repeats [his desire to remain in servitude], as it is stated, <italic>But if the servant shall plainly say</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1980">1</xref></sup> If the slave has a wife and children but the master has no wife and children, or if the master has a wife and children and the slave has no wife and children, he should not have his ear pierced. That is the view of R. Ishmael; R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: In either case he should have his ear pierced.</p>
<p>Anything may be used for the piercing, even a scissors,<sup><xref rid="fn1981">2</xref></sup> but [the proper instrument for] the command to pierce is an awl, as it is stated, <italic>And his master shall bore his ear through with an awl</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1982">3</xref></sup> He should only be pierced at the top of the ear according to R.

<p label="2.">A Canaanite slave<sup><xref rid="fn1984">5</xref></sup> is acquired by money payment, by written deed or by seizure, and he acquires his liberty with money which is paid [to his master] by others or with a written document which he receives [from him]. Such is the opinion of R. Meir; but the Sages said: [He acquires liberty] with money which he himself pays or with a deed received for him by others, provided only that the money belongs to others.<sup><xref rid="fn1985">6</xref></sup></p>
<p label="3.">He goes free for loss of a limb<sup><xref rid="fn1986">7</xref></sup>&#x2014;for an eye or a tooth, for the tips of the ears, for the tips of the fingers and toes, for the tip of the nose, for the tip of the membrum and for the tips of the breasts in a woman. R. Simeon said: [The last-mentioned applies also] to a man.</p>
<p label="4.">If [the master] knocks out two of his teeth together, or blinds his two eyes together, he goes free but receives no compensation; if they were knocked out at different times, he gains his liberty for the first and receives monetary compensation for the second.

<p label="5.">A slave of whom an Israelite is part-owner<sup><xref rid="fn1988">9</xref></sup> is [reckoned as] a free man.<sup><xref rid="fn1989">10</xref></sup></p>

<p label="7.">Whoever sells his slave to a Gentile or [to an Israelite] outside the Land [of Israel], or one who goes free for the loss of a limb, [the slave] does not require a deed of manumission. R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba says that he does require a deed of manumission.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<h1><small>THE TRACTATE</small></h1>
<p><italic>Masseketh Sefer Torah</italic>, &#x2018;the Tractate on the Torah Scroll&#x2019;, deals with the preparation, correct writing and proper handling of sacred scrolls, particularly the Pentateuch which is used for the reading of the lections in the statutory religious services in the Synagogue.</p>
<p>Forming part of the collection known as <italic>Massektoth &#x1E32;e&#x1E6D;annoth</italic>, it belongs also to the smaller collection, <italic>Sheba&#x2018; Massektoth &#x1E32;e&#x1E6D;annoth</italic>, &#x2018;The Seven Minor Tractates&#x2019;, which is the earliest collection of its kind in the Talmudic literature. All the seven are of great antiquity in their main contents and have their origin in the early period of oral traditions, when the writing down of such traditions was generally forbidden. Their author was a Palestinian who lived before the redaction of the Mishnah (beginning of the third century <small>C.E.</small>).</p>
<p>In the history of Rabbinic literature these tractates are of considerable importance because they represent the earliest digests dealing with a particular subject in a compact, comprehensive and detailed set of rules. Such regulations are scattered throughout the numerous pages of the Talmud, embedded in long and intricate discussions, together with material which has no direct bearing on the subject under treatment.</p>
<p>Although most of the rules in this tractate are to be found in the Tannaitic teaching in the Talmudic literature&#x2014;Mishnah, Baraitha, and the Palestinian and Babylonian Gemara&#x2014;twelve rules occur in it which cannot be traced in those sources. These are contained in II, 9f., III, 5-9, and V, 1-3, 6, 8.</p>
<p>There is a very close relationship between <italic>Masseketh Sefer Torah</italic> and the first five chapters of <italic>Soferim</italic>, the tractate on &#x2018;Scribes&#x2019;, and both probably assumed their present form in the Geonic period. It is also clear that the compiler of <italic>Soferim</italic> was acquainted with this tractate and drew largely upon it,<xref rid="fn1993">&#x2605;</xref> but whereas <italic>Sefer Torah</italic> is characterized by a simple and direct style and a clear cut system of rules, <italic>Soferim</italic> has numerous interpolations, amplifications and much irrelevant matter. The numbering of the chapters corresponds in the two tractates so far as they overlap, but there is a difference in the length of the respective chapters, their contents, and the numeration and extent of the rules.</p>

I prescribes the writing materials that must alone be used for sacred scrolls; the languages permitted in the originals and translations; indicates some deviations in the Septuagint from the Masoretic text; and deals also with the rules concerning the sheets, columns, and open and closed sections in the sacred scrolls.</p>
<p>Chap. II indicates the spaces that must be left between letters, words, columns and books in a scroll; the number of columns in a sheet; the width and length of columns and scrolls; the size of the upper and lower margins; blank spaces at the beginnings and ends of scrolls; special arrangement of lines in certain sections; the rollers, sewing and mending; and the disposal of outworn sheets.</p>
<p>Chap. III deals with the kind of books that may be written on one scroll; the extent of the spaces that must separate books of the Pentateuch and books of the Prophets respectively; which scrolls may be separated into smaller books; degrees of sanctity in the various sacred writings; palimpsests; procedure in case of scribal errors; manner of rolling and unrolling scrolls, and how many columns at a time are to be unrolled during the Scriptural reading; their reverential handling; and the respectful use of foodstuffs.</p>
<p>Chap. IV lists the divine names that may not be erased, the names that are always sacred and the words with the same spelling which are secular; and prohibits the profane use of any of the sacred names.</p>
<p>Chap. V discusses cases of error in the writing of divine names, concentration of thought and reverence when divine names are written; procedure when such names are written on a person&#x2019;s body, on an article of furniture, the horn of an animal or any other object; the writing of small scrolls for children&#x2019;s instruction; and the storage of disused sacred writings.</p>

<title>SEFER TORAH</title>
<title>CHAPTER I</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. It is not permitted to write a scroll of the Torah<sup><xref rid="fn1994">1</xref></sup> on skins of ritually unclean cattle or on skins of ritually unclean wild animals, nor may they<sup><xref rid="fn1995">2</xref></sup> be sewn with [their] sinews or [the parchment rolls of <italic>tefillin</italic>] be wound with their hair. It is an oral prescription delivered to Moses at Sinai that [these] shall be written on the skins of ritually clean cattle, or on skins of ritually clean wild animals, that they shall be sewn together with ritually clean sinews, [that the <italic>tefillin</italic> rolls] shall be wound with ritually clean hair, and that the writing be done with ink, because [this latter requirement] has support in Scripture, <italic>And I wrote them with ink in the book</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1996">3</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. It is permitted to write [sacred scrolls] on skins of <italic>nebeloth</italic> and on skins of <italic>&#x1E6D;erefoth</italic> and there is no need to consider the possibility of their having been pierced at the animal&#x2019;s heart.<sup><xref rid="fn1997">4</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. Skins<sup><xref rid="fn1998">5</xref></sup> for the [sacred] books, <italic>tefillin</italic> and <italic>mezuzoth</italic> may be bought anywhere, and one need not consider the possibility that they might be skins that were pierced at the animal&#x2019;s heart.</p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. The writing on <italic>&#x1E33;elaf</italic> must be on the side of the flesh, and on <italic>gewil</italic> it must be on the side of the hair; and if one changed the one for the other [the scroll] may not be used for the lection [in the statutory services].</p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. [Sacred texts]<sup><xref rid="fn1999">6</xref></sup> may not be written on <italic>difthera</italic>, a tablet or erased paper;<sup><xref rid="fn2000">7</xref></sup> nor with coal,<sup><xref rid="fn2001">8</xref></sup> shoe-black, or ink containing gum or vitriol. Vitriol may not be added to the ink.</p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. R. Jacob said in the name of R. Meir: Vitriol may be added to the ink. R. Judah said: R. Meir&#x2019;s statement about [writing with ink containing] vitriol applies to [the whole] Torah<sup><xref rid="fn2002">9</xref></sup> except the section dealing with a suspected wife.<sup><xref rid="fn2003">10</xref></sup> R. Jacob retorted: [R. Meir] said, &#x2018;Except the section dealing with a suspected wife&#x2019;, [by which he meant that] only in the special scroll<sup><xref rid="fn2004">11</xref></sup> which [was used] in the Temple [must the ink contain no vitriol] because [the writing] had to be blotted out.<sup><xref rid="fn2005">12</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>. R. Simeon b. La&#x1E33;ish said in the name of R. Meir, who had it from R. Ishmael, that vitriol may be added to the ink.</p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>. [Sacred texts]<sup><xref rid="fn2006">13</xref></sup> may not be written in [obsolete] Hebrew characters or in the Median, Elamitic or Greek languages.<sup><xref rid="fn2007">14</xref></sup> Seventy Elders wrote the Torah for king Ptolemy<sup><xref rid="fn2008">15</xref></sup> in Greek, and that day was as ominous for Israel as the day on which the Golden Calf was made, since the Torah could not be adequately translated.</p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>. They [all] introduced [the same] thirteen alterations:<sup><xref rid="fn2009">16</xref></sup> &#x2018;God created in the beginning&#x2019;; &#x2018;I shall make a man in image and likeness&#x2019;; &#x2018;And He finished on the sixth [day] and rested on the seventh [day]&#x2019;; &#x2018;Male and female He created him&#x2019;; &#x2018;Come let Me go down&#x2019;; &#x2018;And Sarah laughed among her relatives, saying&#x2019;; &#x2018;For in their anger they slew oxen and in their self-will they digged up a stall&#x2019;; &#x2018;And Moses took his wife and his children and set them upon a carrier of men&#x2019;; &#x2018;Now the time that the children of Israel dwelt in the land of Canaan and in the land of Egypt was four hundred and thirty years&#x2019;; &#x2018;I have not taken one desirable thing from them&#x2019;; &#x2018;And the [beast] with small legs&#x2019;; &#x2018;Which the Lord thy God hath allotted unto all the peoples to give light under the whole heaven&#x2019;; &#x2018;And they offer sacrifices to the sun or the moon or any of the host of heaven which I commanded should not be served&#x2019;.</p>
<p><small>RULE 10</small>. [Sacred scrolls] must not be written in gold. It is related that, in an Alexandrian scroll<sup><xref rid="fn2010">17</xref></sup> of the Torah, the divine names were written in gold, and when the matter came before the Sages they decided that it should be stored away.<sup><xref rid="fn2011">18</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 11</small>. If Hebrew words were written in Aramaic or Aramaic words in Hebrew, if <italic>Ha&#x2019;azinu</italic> was written in continuous lines,<sup><xref rid="fn2012">19</xref></sup> or if the breaking up [of the lines] was not done according to the rule, the scroll may not be used for the lections.</p>
<p><small>RULE 12</small>. If one finished [writing nearly] all the scroll [of the Torah] and less than a column of text remained, one need not hesitate to extend the writing so as to make of this a small column on its own.<sup><xref rid="fn2013">20</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 13</small>. If an open section was written as a closed one or <italic>vice versa</italic>, the scroll must be stored away. What is an open section? One which commences at the beginning of a line. How much space must there be at the end of a line so that the section beginning at the next line may be called an open one? A space on which may be written a name of three letters.<sup><xref rid="fn2014">21</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 14</small>. Should an entire section be finished at the end of a column, if one [blank] line remained and [the next] section is a closed one, [the scribe] begins it in the middle of the line; but if it is an open section, he begins at the top [of the next column] and leaves that line [blank].<sup><xref rid="fn2015">22</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn2013">(20) The extension of a short passage over a full column is done either by enlarging the characters or, according to others, by making each successive line shorter than the one preceding it.</ftnote>

</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER II</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. Sufficient space must be left between words<sup><xref rid="fn2016">1</xref></sup> so that they may be distinguished, and between letters so that they be not mixed. If the letters were mixed up or a break made in the middle of a word, the scroll must not be used for the lection in the statutory services.</p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. [It is permitted] to insert between columns two letters from a long word, but not from a short one. If, however, [the part of a longer word forms] a short word on its own,<sup><xref rid="fn2017">2</xref></sup> it is forbidden [to insert it between the columns].</p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. In a Torah scroll the space of two finger-breadths must be left [between columns], but in scrolls of the Prophets and in those of Pentateuchs<sup><xref rid="fn2018">3</xref></sup> a space of one thumb-breadth [only].</p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. In the lower margin of a Torah scroll the space of a handbreadth is left, and in the upper margin two-thirds of a handbreadth;<sup><xref rid="fn2019">4</xref></sup> but in scrolls of the Prophets and Pentateuchs three finger-breadths in the lower margin and two finger-breadths in the upper. In all these cases<sup><xref rid="fn2020">5</xref></sup> if it is desired to extend [the margins] this may be done, provided they do not exceed [the space of] the written matter.</p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. Between the books in a Torah scroll a vacant space of four lines must be left, and in a scroll containing the Twelve Prophets three lines.</p>
<p>At the end of a scroll and at its beginning sufficient [parchment] must be left to wind<sup><xref rid="fn2021">6</xref></sup> [it round the scroll]. In a Torah scroll no limit has been prescribed, but a roller should be attached at the end of the scroll and there is no need to do this at its beginning.<sup><xref rid="fn2022">7</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. A sheet of a Torah scroll must contain not less than three columns and not more than eight. In the case of <italic>&#x1E33;elaf</italic> parchments no limit was prescribed, [62<italic>b</italic>] and one may add [as many columns] as desired provided only there are not less than three columns [to the sheet].</p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>. If one finished [writing nearly] all the book<sup><xref rid="fn2023">8</xref></sup> and one column of text remained, one need not hesitate to make of it a separate small sheet.</p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>. If a sheet [of a Torah scroll] is worn out, one may not remove two [columns only] and replace them by two new columns; but three columns should be removed and replaced by three new ones, and the new columns must be written in the same size as the original script.</p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>. The width of a column [in a Torah scroll] must be such as to be recognizable at one glance,<sup><xref rid="fn2024">9</xref></sup> and in a small scroll not less than a handbreadth. R. Jose b. Judah says: It must not be less than the width of three fingers.</p>
<p><small>RULE 10</small>. The height<sup><xref rid="fn2025">10</xref></sup> of [a scroll] must not be greater than its circumference,<sup><xref rid="fn2026">11</xref></sup> nor its circumference greater than its height, but they must be exactly alike,<sup><xref rid="fn2027">12</xref></sup> and this is the most correct procedure.</p>
<p><small>RULE 11</small>. A Torah scroll may not consist half of <italic>gewil</italic> [and half of <italic>&#x1E33;elaf</italic>, but it may consist half of <italic>gewil</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn2028">13</xref></sup> and half [of the <italic>&#x1E33;elaf</italic>] of deers, although this is not the best procedure.</p>
<p><small>RULE 12</small>. [A tear in a Torah parchment sheet] may not be joined with glue, nor is it permitted to write on a patch, nor may [the sheets] be sewn together on the written side. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said in the name of R. Meir: [A torn sheet] may be joined with glue and it is permitted to write on a patch, but it is forbidden to do the sewing<sup><xref rid="fn2029">14</xref></sup> on the written side. If a scroll<sup><xref rid="fn2030">15</xref></sup> is torn, a patch may be placed on the outside.</p>
<ftnote id="fn2016">(1) lit. &#x2018;between name and name&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2017">(2) e.g. in a word like <italic>yimlok</italic> (he will reign) the last two letters can form an independent short word <italic>lak</italic> (to thee).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2018">(3) Intended for ordinary reading or study, and not for the public lections.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2019">(4) lit. &#x2018;two parts of a handbreadth&#x2019;. This is also the reading of V and M in Sof. II, 4. According to Men. 30a (Sonc. ed., p. 195) and H in Sof. <italic>loc. cit.</italic> the upper margin must be three finger-breadths wide.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2020">(5) lit. &#x2018;here and there&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2021">(6) Reading with many authorities <italic>leha&#x1E33;&#x1E33;if</italic>. V reads <italic>leha&#x1E33;im</italic> &#x2018;to raise up&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2022">(7) This regulation does not agree with Sof. II, 5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2023">(8) This refers either to one book of the Prophets or to several of them written in one scroll.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2024">(9) Accordingly, not more than three Hebrew words, each of ten letters, may be written in a line. If the column is wider, the reader experiences difficulty in passing from line to line.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2025">(10) lit. &#x2018;length&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2026">(11) When rolled up, so according to B.B. 14a (Sonc. ed., p. 67); lit. &#x2018;its width&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2027">(12) lit. &#x2018;takes the middle course&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2028">(13) The words of this Rule enclosed within square brackets are added from Sof. II, 10, <italic>q.v.</italic> If &#x2018;although&#x2019; is altered to &#x2018;because&#x2019;, the text will make sense but will be contrary to the Rule in Sof. <italic>loc. cit.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2029">(14) So according to GRA, H and M in Sof. II, 11. V reads here as in Sof. &#x2018;the writing&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2030">(15) Other than a Torah scroll.</ftnote>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER III</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. It is permissible to join the Torah and the Prophets in one scroll, according to R. Judah; but the Sages say: The Torah and the Prophets must be written in separate scrolls.<sup><xref rid="fn2031">1</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. Between a book of the Prophets and another one should not leave the same [empty space] as between two books of the Torah; but in each case the space must be that which has been prescribed for it.<sup><xref rid="fn2032">2</xref></sup> Furthermore [a book of the Prophets]<sup><xref rid="fn2033">3</xref></sup> must begin at the top.<sup><xref rid="fn2034">4</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. A Torah scroll<sup><xref rid="fn2035">5</xref></sup> may not be made into [separate] books of the Pentateuch, because it is forbidden to reduce a major sanctity<sup><xref rid="fn2036">6</xref></sup> to a minor sanctity.<sup><xref rid="fn2037">7</xref></sup> From scrolls containing sections of the Pentateuch, however, it is permitted to make up a Torah scroll. When may this be done? When the measurements<sup><xref rid="fn2038">8</xref></sup> and the number of the lines<sup><xref rid="fn2039">9</xref></sup> are alike.</p>
<p>It is not permissible to join together two sections of the Pentateuch or one and a half of them to form a single scroll.<sup><xref rid="fn2040">10</xref></sup> But if it was intended<sup><xref rid="fn2041">11</xref></sup> that additional scrolls be attached to them,<sup><xref rid="fn2042">12</xref></sup> it is permissible.</p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. If a Torah scroll has spaces or stops [to mark] the beginning of verses, it may not be used for the lections.<sup><xref rid="fn2043">13</xref></sup> [Similarly] if a letter has been engraved or joined to another, the scroll may not be used for the lections.</p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. A scroll [some of whose letters] are faded may not be used for the public lections.<sup><xref rid="fn2044">14</xref></sup> R. Simeon b. Eleazar says: If the outline [of the effaced letters] is distinguishable, it is permitted [to rewrite them].</p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. A scroll of the Torah in which a whole line<sup><xref rid="fn2045">15</xref></sup> is faded may not be used. If the greater part of a line is faded and the smaller part intact, the use of the scroll is permitted.</p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>. Not more than four<sup><xref rid="fn2046">16</xref></sup> columns of the Torah scroll may be unrolled [at one time during the reading of the lection] but there is no objection to the reading of ten [columns] in one [lection].</p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>. A scribe may not put upon the written part [of a Torah scroll] a reed-pen with ink on it;<sup><xref rid="fn2047">17</xref></sup> nor may he take hold of the sheets of parchment and thereby unroll [the scroll]; nor may he<sup><xref rid="fn2048">18</xref></sup> grasp the parchments to extract the written sheets;<sup><xref rid="fn2049">19</xref></sup> nor may he remove a scroll from its [case] by shaking it out. All these [restrictions], however, are relaxed in the case of official revisers of Scriptural scrolls.</p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>. It is not permissible to place a Torah scroll on a chair and to lean on it with one&#x2019;s elbows while reading; so according to R. Nehemiah. It is not permissible to place it over a chair [with its sheets] hanging down while it is read in the manner of ordinary documents, because [sacred] books must not be treated with disrespect.</p>
<p><small>RULE 10</small>. A Torah scroll may not be placed on a bed and [certainly]<sup><xref rid="fn2050">20</xref></sup> not at its foot or under it; nor may one sit<sup><xref rid="fn2051">21</xref></sup> on a bed while a [Torah] scroll rests on it. It is related that R. Eliezer<sup><xref rid="fn2052">22</xref></sup> once sat [unknowingly] on a bed on which a [Torah] scroll lay, and [when he realized it] he jumped up as if a snake had bitten him. [Such respect is shown for the Torah] because Scripture declares, <italic>Ye shall eep My sabbaths, and reverence My sanctuary</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2053">23</xref></sup>&#x2014;it is not the Sabbaths that one reverences but Him Who commanded [to observe them], for Scripture declares, <italic>This is my God, and I will glorify Him</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2054">24</xref></sup> [which means,]<sup><xref rid="fn2055">25</xref></sup> I will perform the commandment in a beautiful way to His glory.<sup><xref rid="fn2056">26</xref></sup> Such is the interpretation of R. Ishmael. R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba expounds it: I will expatiate on His excellencies.<sup><xref rid="fn2057">27</xref></sup> Abba Saul explains it: I will be like Him,<sup><xref rid="fn2058">28</xref></sup> i.e. as He is gracious and merciful so be thou gracious and merciful.</p>
<p><small>RULE 11</small>. Foodstuffs may not be treated with disrespect. One may not sit on a basket containing dates or dried figs;<sup><xref rid="fn2059">29</xref></sup> but he may sit on a basket that contains pulse and also on a cake of pressed figs, because it is customary to do so in such cases.<sup><xref rid="fn2060">30</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 12</small>. Foodstuffs may not be used as a covering. R. Meir says: Any fruit which has a husk may be [used as a covering]. R. Judah says: Any fruit which has a stem or a stalk<sup><xref rid="fn2061">31</xref></sup> may be [used as a covering].<sup><xref rid="fn2062">32</xref></sup> Foodstuffs may not be eaten with the aid of foodstuffs<sup><xref rid="fn2063">33</xref></sup> unless they are consumed simultaneously.<sup><xref rid="fn2064">34</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn2031">(1) According to GRA (in Sof. III, 1) who adopted the reading of B.B. 13b (Sonc. ed., p. 66): &#x2018;it is permissible to fasten the Torah, the Prophets and the Hagiographa together (in one scroll)&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2032">(2) i.e. four lines between books of the Torah and three between the books of the Prophets.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2033">(3) If the preceding book ended at the foot of a column.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2034">(4) Of the next column, the reason being that, if the books of the Prophets were separated one from the other, the beginning of each book would commence at the top of a column. This does not apply to Torah scrolls, which may never be cut up into separate books.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2035">(5) Which contains all the five books of Moses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2036">(6) The Torah scroll in its entirety.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2037">(7) A section of the Pentateuch.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2038">(8) Of all the scrolls that are to be joined together.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2039">(9) In each column.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2040">(10) Since it might be mistaken for a proper Torah scroll.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2041">(11) When these were written.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2042">(12) To complete a full Torah scroll.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2043">(13) Because all proper Torah scrolls must conform to the original without any deviations.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2044">(14) So H and GRA in Sof. III, 8. V reads &#x2018;one shall not rewrite [the letters] in it&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2045">(15) This is the reading in Sof. III, 9. V reads here &#x2018;one letter&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2046">(16) And not less than three (cf. Sof. III, 10).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2047">(17) So according to Sof. III, 11. The text in V is meaningless.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2048">(18) This is the reading in Sof. III, 11. V reads &#x2018;but he should&#x2019;.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER V</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. If [a scribe] wrote a sacred name twice,<sup><xref rid="fn2109">1</xref></sup> he retains the first and erases the latter.<sup><xref rid="fn2110">2</xref></sup> R. Judah says: If the latter occurred at the end of a column, he erases the first and retains the latter.<sup><xref rid="fn2111">3</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. If [the scribe wrote] a secular noun twice,<sup><xref rid="fn2112">4</xref></sup> he retains the first and wipes away the latter.<sup><xref rid="fn2113">5</xref></sup> R. Judah says: If the latter was at the top of a column,<sup><xref rid="fn2114">6</xref></sup> he wipes away the first and retains the latter.</p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. If a scribe writes <italic>Yehudah</italic> and omits the <italic>daleth</italic> he inserts it above the line. If he intended to write the Tetragrammaton<sup><xref rid="fn2115">7</xref></sup> and wrote <italic>Yehudah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2116">8</xref></sup> instead, he alters the <italic>daleth</italic> to <italic>he</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2117">9</xref></sup> and wipes away the final letter <italic>he</italic>.</p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. If it was required to write <italic>Yehudah</italic> but [the scribe] intended to write the Tetragrammaton, although he [inadvertently] inserted the <italic>daleth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2118">10</xref></sup> he erases it and writes another <italic>Yehudah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2119">11</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. If it was required to write the Tetragrammaton but [the scribe] intended to write <italic>Yehudah</italic>, although he inserted the <italic>daleth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2120">12</xref></sup> he wipes away the final <italic>he</italic> and alters [the preceding] <italic>daleth</italic> into <italic>he</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2121">13</xref></sup> R. Judah says: He should [also] go over the entire name with the reed-pen and so sanctify it. The Sages said to him: This is not the best procedure.</p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. If in writing the Tetragrammaton he made an error [by omitting] one letter he should suspend it above [the line]. If one erred [by omitting] all the name<sup><xref rid="fn2122">14</xref></sup> he should suspend it between the lines. So R. Judah; R. Jose says: [The scribe] wipes away the letters preceding it, writes the Tetragrammaton [in their place] and suspends [above the line] the part which he had wiped away. R. &#x1E24;ananiah b. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;ashia says: All the sheet must be stored away.</p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>. If one wrote <italic>Alef-lamed</italic> by mistake three<sup><xref rid="fn2123">15</xref></sup> times in the clause <italic>God delivereth me to the ungodly</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2124">16</xref></sup> one retains<sup><xref rid="fn2125">17</xref></sup> the first and erases<sup><xref rid="fn2126">18</xref></sup> the latter.<sup><xref rid="fn2127">19</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>. When one is writing the Tetragrammaton, one may not respond even if the king greets him;<sup><xref rid="fn2128">20</xref></sup> but if one was about to write two or three divine names successively<sup><xref rid="fn2129">21</xref></sup> one may pause between them and respond.</p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>. After dipping<sup><xref rid="fn2130">22</xref></sup> the reed-pen [in ink], one may not start with a letter<sup><xref rid="fn2131">23</xref></sup> of the divine name<sup><xref rid="fn2132">24</xref></sup> but with a letter of<sup><xref rid="fn2133">25</xref></sup> the preceding word.</p>
<p><small>RULE 10</small>. One who wipes away<sup><xref rid="fn2134">26</xref></sup> a single letter of a divine name transgresses a negative commandment. R. Ishmael<sup><xref rid="fn2135">27</xref></sup> says: On account of this it is stated, <italic>Ye shall destroy their name out of that place;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2136">28</xref></sup> and it is also stated, <italic>Ye shall not do so unto the Lord your God</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2137">29</xref></sup> It is permissible, however, to wipe away ink that dropped on the writing,<sup><xref rid="fn2138">30</xref></sup> since one&#x2019;s intention is only to rectify it.</p>
<p><small>RULE 11</small>. It is not permissible to make a scroll [of the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn2139">31</xref></sup> or of the <italic>Hallel</italic> for children.<sup><xref rid="fn2140">32</xref></sup> R. Judah permits [the writing of a scroll] from <italic>In the beginning</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2141">33</xref></sup> to the story of the Flood,<sup><xref rid="fn2142">34</xref></sup> and from the beginning of Leviticus to <italic>And it came to pass on the eighth day;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2143">35</xref></sup> but [in the case of] all the other books [of Scripture the writing of extracts is] forbidden.<sup><xref rid="fn2144">36</xref></sup> If, however, one intends to add to them,<sup><xref rid="fn2145">37</xref></sup> it is permissible [to write extracts from the Scriptures in scrolls].</p>
<p><small>RULE 12</small>. The following names are to be divided:<sup><xref rid="fn2146">38</xref></sup> <italic>Beth-&#x2019;el</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2147">39</xref></sup> <italic>Beth-&#x2019;awen</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2148">40</xref></sup> <italic>Be&#x2019;er-sheba&#x2018;</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2149">41</xref></sup> <italic>Po&#x1E6D;ifera&#x2018;</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2150">42</xref></sup> <italic>&#x1E92;afenath-pa&#x2018;nea&#x1E25;</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2151">43</xref></sup> [and the words] <italic>&#x1E25;arah &#x2019;af</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2152">44</xref></sup> <italic>&#x1E25;arah &#x2019;appi</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2153">45</xref></sup> R. Jose says: These must not be divided. All agree that there must be no breaking up of <italic>&#x2018;Ammiel</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2154">46</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;Amminadab</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2155">47</xref></sup> <italic>&#x1E92;uri&#x2019;el</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2156">48</xref></sup> <italic>&#x1E92;urishaddai</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2157">49</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 13</small>. If a person writes a divine name on his body, he must neither bathe nor anoint himself.<sup><xref rid="fn2158">50</xref></sup> R. Jose says: This is permitted provided only that he does not rub it off. [If he wrote it] on the horn of a cow or on the legs of a bed,<sup><xref rid="fn2159">51</xref></sup> he scrapes it off<sup><xref rid="fn2160">52</xref></sup> and stores it away.<sup><xref rid="fn2161">53</xref></sup> [If he wrote it] on a stone, he detaches it and stores it away.</p>
<p><small>RULE 14</small>. Should one cut off a strip of a scroll,<sup><xref rid="fn2162">54</xref></sup> it may [be used for ordinary purposes] if it is a new one,<sup><xref rid="fn2163">55</xref></sup> but if it is an old scroll<sup><xref rid="fn2164">56</xref></sup> [the use of the strip] is forbidden. As regards worn-out scrolls, phylacteries and wraps of scrolls, these must be stored away.<sup><xref rid="fn2165">57</xref></sup> They should not be deposited [in an unclean place]<sup><xref rid="fn2166">58</xref></sup> but in a deserted spot where they decay naturally.<sup><xref rid="fn2167">59</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn2109">(1) lit. &#x2018;he who writes two sacred names&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2110">(2) The first is retained because it was properly written; the second is erased because it was written in error.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2111">(3) [In Sof. V, 1, the reading is: &#x2018;R. Judah says: If the first occurs at the end of a column&#x2019;. Here H reads: &#x2018;If the latter occurs at the beginning of a column&#x2019;. Either of these must be substituted for V because the idea is that] it spoils the appearance to leave a blank space at the beginning of the top line of a column.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2112">(4) lit. &#x2018;two secular names&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2113">(5) While the ink is still wet.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2114">(6) [Cf. Sof. V, 2, n. 6.]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2115">(7) The four-lettered name <italic>Yod-he-waw-he</italic>. Lit. &#x2018;the name, he wrote the name&#x2019;, apparently a misprint.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2116">(8) <italic>Yod-he-waw-daleth-he</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2117">(9) This is done by adding a short vertical line to the <italic>daleth</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2118">(10) Thus writing the noun correctly but without intention.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2119">(11) Because the writing must be both intentional and correct.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2120">(12) So that <italic>Yehudah</italic> was not only intended but also written correctly, in the wrong place. [Cf. the variant reading in Sof. V, 3.]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2121">(13) The letters being almost the same and the alteration so slight, the Tetragrammaton is deemed to have been written intentionally and correctly.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2122">(14) The Tetragrammaton.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2123">(15) So GRA in Sof. V, 5. V reads &#x2018;twice&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2124">(16) Job XVI, 11. The Biblical text has the word twice, the first being the name of God and the second the preposition, and inadvertently one wrote it three times, intending the first two to stand for &#x2018;God&#x2019; (so sanctifying both) and the third for the preposition.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2125">(17) This is the reading in Sof. V, 5. V has &#x2018;wipes away&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2126">(18) So GRA in Sof. V, 5. V has &#x2018;retains&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2127">(19) The second <italic>&#x2019;el</italic> which, having been intended in error to stand for the divine name, is treated in accordance with Rule 1 above. By quoting an illustration from Job, the inference to be drawn is that the regulation with respect to a Torah scroll holds good also of the Prophets and the Hagiographa.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2128">(20) All one&#x2019;s attention must be concentrated on the writing of the divine name.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2129">(21) e.g. <italic>The Lord, the Lord, God</italic> (Ex. XXXIV, 6) or Deut. VI, 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2130">(22) lit. &#x2018;he who dips&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2131">(23) The text has <italic>me&#x2019;otho</italic>, lit. &#x2018;from it&#x2019;. A better reading, omitting the last <italic>waw</italic> would be <italic>me&#x2019;oth</italic>, &#x2018;from a letter of&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2132">(24) Because a pen full of ink may cause a blot.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2133">(25) Reading again <italic>me&#x2019;oth</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2134">(26) In Sof. V, 6, &#x2018;erases&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2135">(27) &#x2018;R. Simeon&#x2019; in Sof. <italic>loc. cit.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2136">(28) Deut. XII, 3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2137">(29) <italic>ibid.</italic> 4; i.e. the name of God must never be erased.</ftnote>

<title>Tractate Tefillin</title>
<chapter>
<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<h1><small>THE NAME</small></h1>
<p><italic>Tefillin</italic>, &#x2018;phylacteries&#x2019;, is one of the &#x2018;Seven Minor Tractates&#x2019; in the narrower sense (see Introduction to <italic>Sefer Torah</italic>). It is the plural of <italic>tefillah</italic>, a noun derived from the root TFL, &#x2018;to attach&#x2019;, which is similar to the Syriac TFLTA, meaning &#x2018;attachment, hanging&#x2019;. They are so named on account of their being worn on the arm and on the head. Another proposed derivation is from PLL, &#x2018;to argue, prove&#x2019;, because they are evidence that the name of God is called upon Israel (cf. Deut. XXVIII, 10, Tosafoth Men. 33b <italic>s.v. le&#x1E6D;o&#x1E6D;afoth</italic>). A third suggested derivation is from the root PLA&#x2019;, &#x2018;separation, distinction&#x2019;. The <italic>tefillin</italic> are a constant reminder that Israel must separate themselves from all evil thoughts and deeds.</p>
<h1><small>SHAPE AND CONTENTS OF THE <italic>TEFILLIN</italic></small></h1>
<p>A <italic>tefillah</italic> is made of leather, shaped into a quadrangular capsule with a base of thick skin, <italic>tithura</italic>, on one side of which is a hollow rim, <italic>ma&#x2018;barta</italic>, through which a leather strap, <italic>re&#x1E93;u&#x2018;ah</italic>, is passed. One <italic>tefillah</italic> is worn on the arm and the other on the head. Both must be black; but while the top and the sides of the hand-<italic>tefillah</italic> are smooth, those of the head-<italic>tefillah</italic> are grooved, being composed of four compartments with an ordinary letter <italic>shin</italic> on the right side and a specially formed <italic>shin</italic> with four heads on the left.</p>
<p>The middle of the strap of the head-<italic>tefillah</italic> is formed into a loop big enough to encircle the head, with the <italic>tefillah</italic> hanging from it above the forehead. At the back of the head the strap is made into a knot, shaped like the letter <italic>daleth</italic>, from which the two ends of the strap hang down in front of both shoulders and reaching below the waist (see the illustrations in J.E. X, pp. 22, 24).</p>
<p>One end of the strap of the hand-<italic>tefillah</italic> is made into a noose with a knot representing the letter <italic>yod</italic>. The other is threaded through the <italic>ma&#x2018;barta</italic> and then through the noose so that the knot adjoins the capsule while the loop is fastened round the left arm with the <italic>tefillah</italic> resting on the biceps facing the heart. The longer end of the strap is then wound seven times round the lower part of the left arm, ending with coils round the hand and two fingers, to represent the letters <italic>shin</italic> and <italic>daleth</italic> which, together with <italic>the yod</italic> mentioned, form the divine name <italic>Shaddai</italic>, &#x2018;Almighty&#x2019;. The <italic>shin</italic> on the head-<italic>tefillah</italic>, the <italic>daleth</italic> knot at the back of the head and the <italic>yod</italic> knot of the hand-<italic>tefillah</italic> also constitute the same divine name. In each capsule four passages from Scripture, enumerated in the tractate, are inserted.</p>
<h1><small>ORIGIN OF THE PRECEPT</small></h1>
<p>The commandment of <italic>tefillin</italic> is derived from the following passages: <italic>And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes</italic> (Ex. XIII, 9). <italic>And it shall be for a sign upon thy hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes</italic> (<italic>ibid.</italic> 16). <italic>And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes</italic> (Deut. VI, 8). <italic>And ye shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes</italic> (<italic>ibid.</italic> XI, 18).</p>
<p>Though Scripture does not specify <italic>tefillin</italic> in these verses, tradition from time immemorial interpreted the terms <italic>sign, memorial</italic> and <italic>frontlets</italic> as referring to the phylacteries. Many minutiae in the laws of <italic>tefillin</italic> are said to have been communicated to Moses on Mount Sinai. So familiar was the observance of the commandment that even the Mishnah (completed early in the third century <small>C.E.</small>) does not describe how it is to be performed. It is only from the Gemara and other oral traditions that the details are known.</p>
<h1><small>PURPOSE OF THE OBSERVANCE</small></h1>
<p>According to Scripture the commandment is a reminder of the deliverance from the slavery of Egypt. In Ex. XIII, 9, the precept is followed by the reason, <italic>For with a strong hand hath the Lord brought thee out of Egypt</italic>. To the commandment, <italic>ibid.</italic> 16, is added, <italic>For by strength of hand the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt</italic>. The reference in Deut. VI, 8, is followed by, <italic>Beware lest thou forget the Lord, Who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage</italic> (<italic>ibid.</italic> 12); and close to the commandment, in Deut. XI, 18 and preceding it, Scripture declares, <italic>And know ye this day &#x2026; His works which He did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh &#x2026; and unto all His land</italic> (<italic>ibid.</italic> 2f.).</p>
<p>Another function of the <italic>tefillin</italic> is to be a reminder of God&#x2019;s selection of Israel to be His witnesses and to proclaim His Unity. The text, <italic>And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the name of the Lord is called upon thee</italic> (Deut. XXVIII, 10), is interpreted by R. Eliezer the Great as referring to the head-<italic>tefillah</italic> (Ber. 6a, Sonc. ed., p. 25).</p>
<h1><small>THE TRACTATE</small></h1>
<p>Practically the entire contents of this tractate are devoted to the details relating to the commandment of <italic>tefillin</italic>. It deals with the materials and languages that may be used for <italic>tefillin</italic> scrolls; the shapes and the kind of damage which disqualify them for religious use; and who is and who is not subject to the obligation.</p>
<p>Advice is given in avoiding any disrespectful treatment of the <italic>tefillin</italic>, and on the remedies should such treatment occur. Guidance is given as to persons from whom they may be bought, and specific laws are laid down on the number of scrolls to be placed in each <italic>tefillah</italic>, the contents of the scrolls and the kind of capsules required.</p>
<p>It may be stated that there is a difference of opinion between Rashi and his grandson, Rabbenu Tam, on the interpretation of the law relating to the order in which the scrolls are to be placed (for details, cf. J.E., X, p. 23). Some pious Jews, therefore, put on two pairs so as to satisfy the views of the two authorities. That which accords with Rashi is put on first and the other towards the end of the morning service. In certain congregations both are worn simultaneously.</p>
<p>Rules are given in the tractate on the exact place of the head and the arm where the <italic>tefillin</italic> are to be worn; the times for their observance, excluding the Sabbath and Festivals; which of the two <italic>tefillin</italic> is to be put on and taken off first; the procedure in the absence of one <italic>tefillah;</italic> and which shape or covering causes them to be forbidden.</p>
<p>Direction is also provided in circumstances when sacred objects are found on the Sabbath; and where and when <italic>tefillin</italic> may be kept or worn; and a story is told in confirmation of the respect due to them. Emphasis is laid on the importance of the commandment of <italic>tefillin</italic> which is as great as the study of the Torah day and night. Its performance and the observance of the precepts of <italic>mezuzah</italic> and <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic> endear Israel to God.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the tractate is not exhaustive and a number of rules relating to <italic>tefillin</italic> are not included but are to be found in the Talmud.</p>
<p>[In V the text is continuous. The division into paragraphs and their numbering are adopted from Higger&#x2019;s edition.]</p>

<title>TEFILLIN</title>
<p label="1.">It is not permitted to write [the four scrolls of] <italic>tefillin</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2168">1</xref></sup> on skins of ritually unclean cattle or on skins of ritually unclean wild animals. It is permitted, however, to write them on skins of <italic>nebeloth</italic> and <italic>&#x1E6D;erefoth</italic> and there is no need to consider the possibility of their having been pierced at the animal&#x2019;s heart.<sup><xref rid="fn2169">2</xref></sup></p>
<p label="2.">If [<italic>tefillin</italic> scrolls] were perforated, they become unfit for religious use [if the hole occurred] in the written part; but if it occurred in the margin they remain fit. If the letter <italic>waw</italic> was shaped like a <italic>zayin</italic> or <italic>vice versa</italic>, straight-lined letters like curved ones<sup><xref rid="fn2170">3</xref></sup> or <italic>vice versa</italic>, open letters closed<sup><xref rid="fn2171">4</xref></sup> or <italic>vice versa</italic>, or if the shape of their letters had been altered [in any other way], or if they were written in [obsolete] Hebrew, or were made as a kind of amulet&#x2014;they are unfit for religious use.</p>
<p label="3.">Women, slaves and minors<sup><xref rid="fn2172">5</xref></sup> are exempt from [the commandment of] <italic>tefillin</italic>. A minor who knows how to take care of his <italic>tefillin</italic> is subject to the law of <italic>tefillin</italic>. It is related that &#x1E6C;abi, R. Gamaliel&#x2019;s slave, used to put on <italic>tefillin;</italic> Michal, Saul&#x2019;s daughter, used to put on <italic>tefillin;</italic> Jonah&#x2019;s wife used to make the festival pilgrimages<sup><xref rid="fn2173">6</xref></sup> to Jerusalem.<sup><xref rid="fn2174">7</xref></sup></p>
<p label="4.">[Regarding] the bearers of a bier [to the burial place] and those who relieve them<sup><xref rid="fn2175">8</xref></sup> and those who relieve the latter, whether in front of the bier or behind the bier<sup><xref rid="fn2176">9</xref></sup>&#x2014;all who are required [to carry] the bier are exempt<sup><xref rid="fn2177">10</xref></sup> [from putting on <italic>tefillin</italic>], but those who are not required for the bier are liable. When a halt is made for lamentations,<sup><xref rid="fn2178">11</xref></sup> those who are engaged in the lamentations are exempt, but those<sup><xref rid="fn2179">12</xref></sup> who cannot see<sup><xref rid="fn2180">13</xref></sup> the inside [space between the rows]<sup><xref rid="fn2181">14</xref></sup> are liable.</p>
<p label="5.">If a person says [to another], &#x2018;Come and read [a Scriptural text] over my son because he is frightened&#x2019;, or &#x2018;Write, or place, upon him a [holy] scroll&#x2019;, or &#x2018;Put <italic>tefillin</italic> upon him that he may sleep&#x2019;,<sup><xref rid="fn2182">15</xref></sup> he should not be listened to.<sup><xref rid="fn2183">16</xref></sup></p>
<p label="6.">A <italic>tefillah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2184">17</xref></sup> is susceptible of ritual uncleanness. [If it becomes unclean, the priest] sprinkles upon it [the water of the red heifer]<sup><xref rid="fn2185">18</xref></sup> and repeats the process, and then immerses it [in a ritual bath]. R. &#x1E24;anina b. Gamaliel says: It is necessary to unloose it.<sup><xref rid="fn2186">19</xref></sup> If [a <italic>tefillah</italic>] fell into water and remained there long enough [for the writing] to be washed away, it should be subjected to an examination.<sup><xref rid="fn2187">20</xref></sup></p>
<p label="7.">Straps of <italic>tefillin</italic> may be bought anywhere.<sup><xref rid="fn2188">21</xref></sup> R. Simeon b. Gamaliel says: Any skin that had been used [for a secular] purpose is forbidden [to be used for the straps of <italic>tefillin</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn2189">22</xref></sup></p>
<p label="8."><italic>Tefillin</italic> may be bought only from a reliable person;<sup><xref rid="fn2190">23</xref></sup> and where there is no reliable person a pair of <italic>tefillin</italic> should be given [to an expert] who examines them. This does not mean that the seller gives him the scrolls, but that he himself chooses what he pleases and has them examined.<sup><xref rid="fn2191">24</xref></sup> If on examination the selected <italic>tefillin</italic> prove to be fit,<sup><xref rid="fn2192">25</xref></sup> he may take all the batch without any scruples.<sup><xref rid="fn2193">26</xref></sup></p>
<p label="9.">The [sections of the] head-<italic>tefillah</italic> are written on four separate scrolls<sup><xref rid="fn2194">27</xref></sup> [beginning with] <italic>Sanctify unto Me;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2195">28</xref></sup> <italic>And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2196">29</xref></sup> <italic>Hear;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2197">30</xref></sup> <italic>And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2198">31</xref></sup> So also with the hand-<italic>tefillah</italic>, except that [all the four sections] are written in one scroll.<sup><xref rid="fn2199">32</xref></sup> If one wrote them in four separate scrolls [the <italic>tefillah</italic>] is fit for religious use. R. Judah says: They should be sewn together and put into one capsule.<sup><xref rid="fn2200">33</xref></sup> R. Judah, however, admits that if two <italic>tefillin</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2201">34</xref></sup> were [like] the head-<italic>tefillah</italic>, one may wrap one of them in a piece of leather and so convert it into a hand-<italic>tefillah</italic>.</p>
<p label="10.">The hand-<italic>tefillah</italic> is put on the upper part of the hand<sup><xref rid="fn2202">35</xref></sup> [because Scripture declares, <italic>And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2203">36</xref></sup> which means that the sign shall be for thee<sup><xref rid="fn2204">37</xref></sup> but not for others<sup><xref rid="fn2205">38</xref></sup>]. <sup><xref rid="fn2206">39</xref></sup>So also [the Scriptural expression] <italic>between thine eyes</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2207">40</xref></sup> [implies] the upper part of the head, [because] <italic>upon thy hand</italic> and <italic>between thine eyes</italic> [occur in juxtaposition we infer]: as <italic>upon thy hand</italic> [means] on the upper part of the hand, so <italic>between thine eyes</italic> [means] on the upper part of the head. This is according to R. Eliezer b. Jacob; R. Judah says: It is stated <italic>upon thy hand</italic> and it is also stated [in the same verse] <italic>between thine eyes</italic> [the inference being that] as <italic>upon thy hand</italic> [refers to] a place that is susceptible of ritual uncleanness by one [symptom of] leprosy,<sup><xref rid="fn2208">41</xref></sup> so also <italic>between thine eyes</italic> [refers to] a place that is susceptible of ritual uncleanness by one [symptom of] leprosy.<sup><xref rid="fn2209">42</xref></sup> [Another reason:] It is stated <italic>between thine eyes</italic> and it is also stated, <italic>Nor make any baldness between your eyes:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2210">43</xref></sup> as baldness occurs where there is hair [on the head] so you must put the <italic>tefillah</italic> only where there is hair [on the hand].<sup><xref rid="fn2211">44</xref></sup> It is stated, <italic>And thou shalt write them</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2212">45</xref></sup> and it is also stated [in juxtaposition] <italic>and thou shalt bind them;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2213">46</xref></sup> [hence the inference that] the hand that writes [the <italic>mezuzah</italic>]<sup><xref rid="fn2214">47</xref></sup> is the hand that binds [the <italic>tefillah</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn2215">48</xref></sup></p>
<p label="11.">The commandment of [wearing] <italic>tefillin</italic> is from dawn until evening. If a person sleeps in the day-time he need not trouble to remove his <italic>tefillin</italic>. If a man rises early to go on a journey, he should not put them on before the time [for the performance] of the commandment; but if he had put them on before [the proper time for the performance of] the commandment, he should place his hand upon them at the time [for the performance] of the commandment<sup><xref rid="fn2216">49</xref></sup> and say the benedictions.</p>
<p label="12.">[Absence of] the hand-<italic>tefillah</italic> does not prevent the religious use of the head-<italic>tefillah</italic>, neither does [the absence of] the head-<italic>tefillah</italic> prevent the religious use of the hand-<italic>tefillah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2217">50</xref></sup> If a man inverted a <italic>tefillah</italic> capsule<sup><xref rid="fn2218">51</xref></sup> he has not fulfilled his religious duty.</p>
<p>When a man puts on [the <italic>tefillin</italic>], he should put on that of the hand first; and when he takes them off, he should take off that of the head first. A similar rule applies in the case of sandals, viz. when he puts them on, he should put on that of the right foot first, and when he takes them off, he should take off that of the left foot first.<sup><xref rid="fn2219">52</xref></sup> Likewise, any [dish] that is served last<sup><xref rid="fn2220">53</xref></sup> is removed first, except bread.<sup><xref rid="fn2221">54</xref></sup></p>
<p label="13.">If a man makes his head-[<italic>tefillah</italic>] round, this is a dangerous practice<sup><xref rid="fn2222">55</xref></sup> which does not carry with it [the fulfilment of] the commandment.<sup><xref rid="fn2223">56</xref></sup> To put [the head-<italic>tefillah</italic>] on one&#x2019;s forehead or [the hand-<italic>tefillah</italic>] on the palm of one&#x2019;s hand<sup><xref rid="fn2224">57</xref></sup> is in the manner of heresy.<sup><xref rid="fn2225">58</xref></sup> To overlay them with gold or put [that of the hand] on one&#x2019;s <italic>ne&#x1E33;lah</italic>, which means a sleeve, is the manner of the outsiders.<sup><xref rid="fn2226">59</xref></sup> [63<italic>a</italic>]</p>
<p label="14."><italic>Tefillin</italic> may be moved within a house [even on the Sabbath].<sup><xref rid="fn2227">60</xref></sup> If [on the Sabbath day] a man finds <italic>tefillin</italic> in a public domain,<sup><xref rid="fn2228">61</xref></sup> he should carry them [into a safe place] one pair at a time.<sup><xref rid="fn2229">62</xref></sup> R. Gamaliel says: Two pairs at a time.<sup><xref rid="fn2230">63</xref></sup> [This rule applies to] both men and women,<sup><xref rid="fn2231">64</xref></sup> to new <italic>tefillin</italic> and to old. R. Judah says: [This procedure] is permitted with old <italic>tefillin</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2232">65</xref></sup> but forbidden with new.<sup><xref rid="fn2233">66</xref></sup></p>
<p label="15.">If a man finds a [Torah] scroll or a bundle of <italic>tefillin</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2234">67</xref></sup> he should pass them on to his fellow, and his fellow should pass them on to his fellow on the Sabbath,<sup><xref rid="fn2235">68</xref></sup> even though they be a hundred persons. If [there is no other person]<sup><xref rid="fn2236">69</xref></sup> with him, he<sup><xref rid="fn2237">70</xref></sup> should take them up [while standing] within four cubits [distance from them] and remove them to [the next point] within four cubits [distance from the first point];<sup><xref rid="fn2238">71</xref></sup> because R. Simeon said: Any prohibition<sup><xref rid="fn2239">72</xref></sup> imposed by a Rabbinical Court<sup><xref rid="fn2240">73</xref></sup> does not apply to holy writings.<sup><xref rid="fn2241">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>If a man is in a school house or in a House of Study,<sup><xref rid="fn2242">75</xref></sup> [or] in a privy or a bath-house,<sup><xref rid="fn2243">76</xref></sup> and forgot to remove his <italic>tefillin</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2244">77</xref></sup> he should cover them with his hair<sup><xref rid="fn2245">78</xref></sup> and leave the place.<sup><xref rid="fn2246">79</xref></sup> If he is unable to do so, he should proceed to a near-by house where he takes them off.<sup><xref rid="fn2247">80</xref></sup></p>
<p label="16.">[<italic>Tefillin</italic>] may be put into a money-bag even when there is money in it. They may also be suspended from the legs of a bed; but if another person<sup><xref rid="fn2248">81</xref></sup> be with him [in bed] it is forbidden. They must not be placed under one&#x2019;s head;<sup><xref rid="fn2249">82</xref></sup> but if thereby they are protected<sup><xref rid="fn2250">83</xref></sup> it is permitted.</p>
<p>If a man carried a heavy load<sup><xref rid="fn2251">84</xref></sup> and was perspiring, he need not trouble to remove his <italic>tefillin</italic>. A potter should remove the hand-<italic>tefillah</italic> but wear the head-<italic>tefillah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2252">85</xref></sup> A baker should remove the head-<italic>tefillah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2253">86</xref></sup> and wear the hand-<italic>tefillah;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2254">87</xref></sup> but if he uses both hands in baking he also takes off the hand-<italic>tefillah</italic>.</p>
<p label="17.">[Regarding a bath-house], if a man is about to enter the room where persons are undressed, he removes his <italic>tefillin</italic> at a distance of four cubits from the nude persons. If some are undressed and others dressed, he does not remove his <italic>tefillin</italic> but should not put them on at the outset.<sup><xref rid="fn2255">88</xref></sup></p>
<p label="18.">If a person is about to enter a tannery,<sup><xref rid="fn2256">89</xref></sup> a pond [enclosure]<sup><xref rid="fn2257">90</xref></sup> or a wash-house, he removes his <italic>tefillin</italic> at a distance of four cubits. If a person is about to enter a privy, he removes the <italic>tefillin</italic> at a distance of four cubits. If it was a superior bathing-place,<sup><xref rid="fn2258">91</xref></sup> one does not remove the <italic>tefillin</italic> before he reaches it.</p>
<p label="19.">It once happened that R. Eliezer went to Ubelin<sup><xref rid="fn2259">92</xref></sup> [where he stayed] with a certain house-owner. It was a practice there to bathe in a cave. When R. Eliezer took his clothes off and removed his <italic>tefillin</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2260">93</xref></sup> [the host] said to him, &#x2018;Rabbi, is not the water of that cave better than that of this one?&#x2019; And although there was only a distance of four cubits between the one and the other, R. Eliezer dressed and put on his <italic>tefillin</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2261">94</xref></sup> because he never walked four cubits without <italic>tefillin</italic>. In this manner did R. Eliezer make the commandment of <italic>tefillin</italic> a permanent practice.</p>
<p label="20.">Thus used R. Eliezer to say: Great is the commandment of <italic>tefillin</italic>, for the Holy One, blessed be He, spoke as follows to Israel, <italic>But thou shalt meditate therein day and night</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2262">95</xref></sup> &#x2018;Sovereign of the universe,&#x2019; said Israel to the Holy One, blessed be He, &#x2018;is it possible for us to meditate day and night [in the Torah]?&#x2019; The Holy One, blessed be He, answered them, &#x2018;My children, put <italic>tefillin</italic> on your heads and on your arms and I shall account it to you as if you meditated in the Torah day and night&#x2019;; as it is stated, <italic>And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the law of the Lord may be in thy mouth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2263">96</xref></sup></p>
<p label="21.">Beloved are Israel [by God], for they observe all the commandments that are in the Torah. How? <italic>Tefillin</italic> on their hands, <italic>tefillin</italic> on their heads, a <italic>mezuzah</italic> on their doors and four <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic> on their garments. Concerning them David, king of Israel, said, <italic>Seven times a day do I praise Thee, because of Thy righteous ordinances</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2264">97</xref></sup></p>
<p>[The Sages] illustrated this with a parable. To what may this be compared? To a king who said to his wife, &#x2018;Be well dressed and adorned in my presence&#x2019;. &#x2018;For what reason?&#x2019; she asked him. &#x2018;In order that you may be acceptable to me,&#x2019; he replied. Similarly the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, &#x2018;My children, be well dressed and adorned in My presence with [your performance of] the commandments&#x2019;. &#x2018;For what reason?&#x2019; they asked Him. &#x2018;In order,&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;that you may be acceptable to Me&#x2019;; as it is stated, <italic>Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tir&#x1E93;ah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2265">98</xref></sup> [which means,] &#x2018;Thou art beautiful when thou art acceptable<sup><xref rid="fn2266">99</xref></sup> to Me through [thy performance of] the commandments&#x2019;.</p>
<ftnote id="fn2168">(1) These are specified below. Cf. also the Introduction.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2169">(2) There was a heathen practice to remove the heart from an animal while it was still alive and offer it as a sacrifice. Rabbinic law regards such an animal as an idolatrous offering (cf. Mishnah &#x2018;A.Z. 29b, Sonc. ed., p. 145) and forbids its entire use, including the skin.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2174">(7) Although the commandment applied only to males (cf. Ex. XXXIV, 23).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2175">(8) In carrying the bier.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2176">(9) Who have not yet carried it or have done so respectively.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2177">(10) This is in disagreement with the ruling in the Mishnah (Ber. 17b, Sonc. ed., p. 106) where only those who are in front of the bier are exempt if they are required to carry it. Those behind are always liable even if their help is required, since they had already done their duty to the dead (cf. Rashi <italic>ad loc.</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2178">(11) A number of such halts were made by those who returned from a burial to the mourner&#x2019;s house. (Cf. Sema&#x1E25;oth X.]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2179">(12) In the back rows when they stand several deep.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2180">(13) So in accordance with Ber. 19b (Sonc. ed., p. 117). V reads &#x2018;those who see&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2181">(14) Where the mourner is.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2182">(15) This is the reading in j.Shab. VI, 2, 8b. The text in V is corrupt.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2183">(16) Because sacred objects should not be used for such purposes. Cf. Sanh. 101a (Sonc. ed., p. 684, nn. 6f.).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2187">(20) To make sure that the writing is still in a good condition or to repair it if necessary.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2188">(21) There is no need, as in the case with the <italic>tefillin</italic>, to buy them from a reliable person.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2189">(22) Hence they must be bought only from a reliable person who can guarantee that no previous use had been made of the skin.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2190">(23) One who can testify that they were prepared in accordance with the law.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2191">(24) lit. &#x2018;that he takes for himself and he examines&#x2019;.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2204">(37) Where only he who wears the <italic>tefillah</italic> can see it, i.e. on the biceps covered by the sleeve.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2205">(38) Had the <italic>tefillah</italic> been put on the palm of the hand it would be visible to all.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2206">(39) The part enclosed in square brackets is based on Men. 37b (Sonc. ed., p. 229).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2207">(40) Ex. XIII, 9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2208">(41) The biceps, like any other part of the body that is free from hair, is declared ritually unclean by one symptom only, viz. white hair in the leprous spot.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2209">(42) Viz. the upper part of the head, whose symptom of uncleanness is yellow hair in the leprous spot. The region between the eyes, however, where both hair and clean flesh are to be found, can be declared unclean by either of the two symptoms (yellow or white hair) and must therefore be ruled out.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2210">(43) Deut. XIV, 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2211">(44) Since both verses contain the expression <italic>between &#x2026; eyes</italic>.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2213">(46) The <italic>tefillin</italic> (<italic>ibid.</italic> 8).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2214">(47) i.e. the right hand, with which most people write.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2215">(48) The hand-<italic>tefillah</italic> is therefore put on the left hand.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2216">(49) At dawn.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2217">(50) Each <italic>tefillah</italic> is independent of the other.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2221">(54) Which must remain on the table until the Grace after meals had been recited (cf. Sanh. 92a, Sonc. ed., p. 617).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2222">(55) Because an accidental blow on it might split one&#x2019;s head. Cf. Meg. 24b (Sonc. ed., p. 148, n. 2).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2223">(56) The commandment being that it must be cube-shaped and flat at the base.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2224">(57) In accordance with the literal meaning of the verse, <italic>And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes</italic> (Deut. VI, 8), which is contrary to the traditional interpretation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2225">(58) Heb. <italic>minuth</italic>, used especially of the views and practices of the early Jewish-Christians. According to Maimonides the <italic>minim</italic> were Sadducees.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2226">(59) Persons who follow their own interpretation of Scripture and not that of the Rabbis. [On this paragraph, cf. J. Rabbinowitz, <italic>Mishnah Megillah</italic>, pp. 128f.]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2227">(60) They are not regarded as articles forbidden to be handled on the Sabbath or Festival, although not worn on the holy days.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2228">(61) Where they may be trodden upon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2229">(62) The hand-<italic>tefillah</italic> on his arm and the head-<italic>tefillah</italic> on his head in the same manner as they are worn on week-days.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2230">(63) As there is sufficient room on the arm and on the head for two sets, he may put two hand-<italic>tefillin</italic> on his arm and two head-<italic>tefillin</italic> on his head.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2231">(64) Although the latter are exempt from the commandment of <italic>tefillin</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2232">(65) Which show marks of wear or have a proper knot, so that there can be no doubt that they were genuine <italic>tefillin</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2233">(66) Since they may be only amulets.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2234">(67) In a public domain where they may be trodden upon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2235">(68) Each one carrying them a lesser distance than four cubits. Carrying an article a longer distance in a public domain is forbidden on the Sabbath.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2236">(69) The words in square brackets are missing in V but inserted by H.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2237">(70) lit. &#x2018;one [man]&#x2019;.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2240">(73) Such as the prohibition to carry objects in a public domain even within a distance of four cubits.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2241">(74) Consequently it is permitted on the Sabbath to carry a Torah scroll or <italic>tefillin</italic> to a place of safety, provided all the stages between the points of taking up and setting down are each less than four cubits in length.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2242">(75) Places in which the <italic>tefillin</italic> would not be sufficiently protected if left there.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2243">(76) It would be disrespectful for the <italic>tefillin</italic> to be left there.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2244">(77) Before the Sabbath had commenced, or before he entered the two last-mentioned places.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2245">(78) So as not to be seen wearing <italic>tefillin</italic> on the Sabbath in public.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2246">(79) Taking them off when he reaches his home.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2247">(80) Leaving them there until the termination of the Sabbath.</ftnote>

<title>Tractate Tzitzit</title>
<chapter>
<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<h1><small>BASIS OF THE ORDINANCE</small></h1>
<p>The commandment of <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic>, &#x2018;fringes&#x2019; or &#x2018;tassels&#x2019;, is derived from the following two verses of Scripture: <italic>Speak unto the children of Israel &#x2026; that they make them &#x2026; fringes in the corners of their garments</italic> (Num. XV, 38), and <italic>Thou shalt make thee twisted cords upon the four corners of thy covering</italic> (Deut. XXII, 12).</p>
<h1><small>THE <italic>&#x1E6C;ALLITH</italic></small></h1>
<p><italic>&#x1E92;i&#x1E93;ith</italic> must be inserted in each of the four corners of the garment. As modern clothes have no four corners, the <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic> are inserted in the <italic>&#x1E6D;allith</italic>, a shawl of wool or silk worn during morning and certain other prayers. The <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic> are suspended from the four corners of the <italic>&#x1E6D;allith</italic> as described below.</p>
<h1><small>THE SMALL <italic>&#x1E6C;ALLITH</italic></small></h1>
<p>In addition, a small <italic>&#x1E6D;allith</italic> called <italic>&#x1E6D;allith &#x1E33;a&#x1E6D;an</italic> or <italic>&#x2019;arba&#x2018; kanefoth</italic> with <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic> in its four corners is worn all day as an undergarment. It is rectangular in shape with an opening in the middle through which the head is passed, and it hangs down from the shoulders covering the chest and back. It is made of wool, but other soft materials are also used, particularly in those worn by children.</p>
<h1><small>HOW <italic>&#x1E92;I&#x1E92;ITH</italic> ARE MADE</small></h1>
<p>Four threads, one of them longer than the others, prepared especially for the religious precept, are inserted in each hole which is made near each of the four corners of the big or small <italic>&#x1E6D;allith</italic>. The threads are then folded in two equal halves, the long thread projecting from one of these, and a double knot is made. The halves being held together, the long thread is wound round the others seven times. They are then separated and a double knot is made. Eight coils followed by a double knot in a similar manner is the next stage, and this is followed by eleven coils and a double knot, concluding with thirteen coils and a final double knot&#x2014;a total of thirty-nine coils and five double knots. Originally a thread, or two threads, of blue wool formed part of the four threads, but this practice has been discontinued because the <italic>&#x1E25;illazon</italic> blue prescribed (cf. &#x00A7;10 of the tractate) became unobtainable.</p>
<h1><small>SYMBOLISM OF THE COMMANDMENT</small></h1>
<p>Like <italic>tefillin</italic> and <italic>mezuzah</italic>, the <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic> are a reminder to the Israelite of his duty to the Creator of the world and a symbol of His love for those who obey His precepts. The Scriptural injunction, <italic>And it shall be unto you for a fringe</italic> (Num. XV, 39) continues <italic>that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the Lord, and do them; and that ye go not about after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go astray . . that ye may remember and do all My commandments, and be holy unto your God</italic> (<italic>ibid.</italic> 39f.).</p>
<h1><small>CONTENTS OF THE TRACTATE</small></h1>
<p>Beginning with the rules on which persons and garments are subject to the obligation of <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic>, the tractate proceeds to describe how the threads for them are to be made and what their minimum length must be.</p>
<p>Two opinions are recorded on the question whether the absence of the blue or the white wool from the <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic>, or one or more of the four <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic> from the <italic>&#x1E6D;allith</italic>, causes disqualification; and the distance of the hole for the <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic> from the corner of the <italic>&#x1E6D;allith</italic> is indicated.</p>
<p>Rules are defined on the type of person from whom <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic> may be bought, and on the procedure to be adopted when one of the <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic> is missing.</p>
<p>Various views are expressed on the degree of sanctity to be accorded to <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic> and on the question of their removal from a shroud.</p>
<p><italic>&#x1E24;illazon</italic> is declared to be the only blue eligible in the dyeing of the blue threads; a description is given of the fish that produces it; and the tractate concludes with the ruling that the blue dye may be bought only from a reliable person.</p>

<title>&#x1E92;I&#x1E92;ITH</title>
<p label="1.">All<sup><xref rid="fn2267">1</xref></sup> are subject to the obligation of <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic>. R. Simeon exempts women since [the commandment of <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic>] is a positive commandment which is dependent on a fixed time.<sup><xref rid="fn2268">2</xref></sup> Any minor who knows how to wrap himself with a <italic>&#x1E6D;allith</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2269">3</xref></sup> should be provided with it by his father.</p>
<p>A <italic>&#x1E6D;allith</italic> which is [long enough to] cover one&#x2019;s head and the greater part of the body is subject to <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic>.</p>
<p label="2.">As regards a [linen] sheer, Beth Shammai exempt it [from <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn2270">4</xref></sup> but Beth Hillel declare it liable.<sup><xref rid="fn2271">5</xref></sup> An undergarment is exempt, but R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba holds that it is liable. A [double-sized] <italic>&#x1E6D;allith</italic> that is folded over is subject to <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic>, but R. Simeon exempts it.<sup><xref rid="fn2272">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>A <italic>&#x1E6D;allith</italic> consisting entirely of blue wool is subject to <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2273">7</xref></sup> A bolster converted into a sheet or a sheet converted into a <italic>&#x1E6D;allith</italic> is subject to <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic>. A night garment and bed-curtains<sup><xref rid="fn2274">8</xref></sup> are exempt from <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2275">9</xref></sup> A toga,<sup><xref rid="fn2276">10</xref></sup> a travelling cloak,<sup><xref rid="fn2277">11</xref></sup> shawls fastened at the shoulder,<sup><xref rid="fn2278">12</xref></sup> a cloak worn on the head,<sup><xref rid="fn2279">13</xref></sup> and an <italic>&#x2019;an&#x1E6D;enah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2280">14</xref></sup> are exempt. This is the general rule: Any [garment] that is without four corners is exempt from <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic>.</p>
<p label="3.">As for the commandment of <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic>, Beth Shammai say: [It requires that there shall be] four threads, [each] of four finger-[breadths in length]; but Beth Hillel say: Three threads [each] of three finger-[breadths in length]. R. Jose b. Judah remarked: Although Beth Hillel said, &#x2018;Three [threads, each] of three [finger-breadths in length]&#x2019;, their ruling is practically identical with that of the other.<sup><xref rid="fn2281">15</xref></sup></p>
<p label="4.">Leaving out [from the <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic>] the blue threads though not the white ones, or the white threads though not the blue ones, invalidates them because [the absence of] either the blue or the white invalidates the other. R. [Ishmael]<sup><xref rid="fn2282">16</xref></sup> maintains: The absence of one does not invalidate the other.</p>
<p label="5.">[The absence of one] of the four <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic> invalidates the others, because all of them [constitute] a single religious observance. R. Ishmael says: They are four independent observances.</p>

<ftnote id="fn2271">(5) In their view the prohibition of wearing <italic>mingled stuff</italic> is superseded by the commandment of <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic>, since the prohibition in Deut. is immediately followed (in verse 12) by the commandment of <italic>twisted cords</italic> or <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic>. The juxtaposition of the two commandments indicates that the latter supersedes the former.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2272">(6) Since if it should happen to be unfolded, the <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic> would not be in their proper place, in the four corners, but in the middle of the sheet.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2285">(19) His reason being that, as it is proper to insert <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic> within three finger-breadths from the corner, one might use a hanging thread left from the sewing as one of the four threads required for the <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic>. But that would render the entire fringe invalid, since all the threads have to be made specifically for the purpose of the commandment, whereas the hanging thread was one ready made (cf. Men. Sonc. ed., p. 248, nn. 1f.).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2286">(20) The colour might not be that of the <italic>&#x1E25;illazon</italic> blue, which is the only colour that is recognized.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2290">(24) lit. &#x2018;to go out with it&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2291">(25) The removal of the <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic> would be an insult to the dead, which is condemned in Prov. XVII, 5, <italic>Whoso mocketh the poor blasphemeth his Maker</italic>, and a dead man is the poorest of all.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2292">(26) And should be undone before the <italic>&#x1E6D;allith</italic> is used as a shroud.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2293">(27) The dyeing of <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic> must be for the specified purpose of the commandment. The reading &#x2018;to test&#x2019; [<italic>lenassoth</italic>] is preferable to the variant &#x2018;to cover himself&#x2019; [<italic>lekassoth</italic>].</ftnote>

<title>Tractate Mezuzah</title>
<chapter>
<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<h1><small>THE NAME</small></h1>
<p><italic>Mezuzah</italic> means literally &#x2018;a doorpost&#x2019;, but it is the technical term given to the small scroll which is placed on the right-hand doorpost of a dwelling-house as described below.</p>
<h1><small>ORIGIN AND ANTIQUITY</small></h1>
<p>Deut. VI, 9, <italic>And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house, and upon thy gates</italic>, with its repetition in XI, 20, is the Scriptural origin of the commandment in general terms. Tradition supplies the practical interpretation in detail. As the tractate deals specifically with many, if not most of these details, it was given its title. Josephus (38-95 <small>C.E.</small>), in his <italic>Antiquities</italic> IV, viii, 13, speaks of the <italic>mezuzah</italic> as an old and firmly established institution.</p>
<h1><small>THE SCROLL AND-ITS CASE</small></h1>
<p>Two passages of Scripture are written on the <italic>mezuzah</italic> scroll: Deut. VI, 4-9 and <italic>ibid.</italic> XI, 13-21. The scroll is a rectangular piece of parchment made of skin from a ritually clean animal and the script is Hebrew.</p>
<p>On the upper third of the rolled-up scroll the divine name <italic>Shaddai</italic> (Almighty) is inscribed; and in accordance with a cabbalistic direction three words, representing &#x2018;the Lord, our God, the Lord&#x2019;, are written at the bottom of the back of the scroll. It is enclosed in a tube or oblong case of wood, metal or any other suitable material. An opening is usually made in it to allow the name <italic>Shaddai</italic> to be seen, and to protect the writing without concealing the divine name the opening is covered with a transparent material. Some <italic>mezuzah</italic> cases are artistically carved and beautifully ornamented (see the illustrations in J.E. VIII, pp. 531ff.). It is customary to touch and kiss the <italic>mezuzah</italic> on entering and leaving the room.</p>
<h1><small>ROOMS LIABLE TO THE <italic>MEZUZAH</italic></small></h1>
<p>Maimonides, summarizing the traditional rules on the conditions required to make a room or building liable to the obligation of a <italic>mezuzah</italic>, lays down the following requirements: It must have an area of four cubits square; two doorposts; a lintel; a ceiling and doors. The doorway must be a minimum of ten handbreadths in height; the room must be for ordinary and not sacred purposes; it must be used for human habitation; it must not be used as a privy or bath-room; and it must be a permanent and not temporary structure.</p>
<h1><small>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PRECEPT</small></h1>
<p>&#x2018;They (the Jews) are also to inscribe the principal blessings from God upon their doors, that God&#x2019;s readiness to bless them may appear everywhere conspicuous about them.&#x2019; So wrote Josephus in the passage referred to above. &#x2018;It is incumbent on every Jew,&#x2019; declared Maimonides, &#x2018;to be most scrupulous in the observance of the commandment of <italic>mezuzah</italic>, so that whenever he enters or leaves the room he meets the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, and is reminded of His love and unity. Thus he will be awakened from his slumber, errors and vanities. He will be driven to the realization that nothing endures for ever except the knowledge of the Rock of the universe. This contemplation will inevitably bring him back to self-realization and plant him in the paths of the upright.&#x2019;</p>
<h1><small>CONTENTS OF THE TRACTATE</small></h1>
<p>Chapter I discusses the materials on which a <italic>mezuzah</italic> should or should not, be written; the marginal spaces to be left around the written text; and where perforation causes no disqualification of the scroll. It forbids the alteration of the shape of the letters and the use of obsolete Hebrew. A list of types of buildings and other structures and doorways that are exempt from the <italic>mezuzah</italic> concludes the chapter.</p>
<p>The second chapter lays down that the <italic>mezuzah</italic> is to be placed on the right-hand doorpost, and defines which of the two doorposts is to be so regarded, drawing a distinction between different types of houses and various other structures. It deals also with the exact position on the doorpost to which the <italic>mezuzah</italic> is to be affixed, limits the distance between the entrance and the <italic>mezuzah</italic>, and indicates the manner of affixing.</p>
<p>Regulations are given on the time allowed to elapse before a <italic>mezuzah</italic> must be affixed. A distinction is drawn between a tenancy in the Land of Israel and outside it, and between a house rented from a Jew and one rented from a Gentile. The chapter concludes with limiting the period within which a <italic>mezuzah</italic> and certain other ritual objects must be re-examined in order that their condition and suitability for their continued use may be verified.</p>
<p>[In the Talmud edition the text in each chapter is continuous. It has been divided into paragraphs and numbered in agreement with Higger&#x2019;s edition.]</p>

<title>CHAPTER I</title>
<p label="1.">It is not permitted to write <italic>mezuzoth</italic> on the skins of ritually unclean cattle or on skins of ritually unclean wild animals. It is permitted, however, to write them on skins of <italic>nebeloth</italic> and <italic>&#x1E6D;erefoth</italic>, and there is no need to consider the possibility of their having been pierced at the animal&#x2019;s heart.<sup><xref rid="fn2298">1</xref></sup></p>
<p label="2.">It is required to leave [a space of] one line on every side [of the text of the <italic>mezuzah</italic>], according to R. Simeon b. Eleazar.</p>
<p label="3.">If a hole was made in the place of the script it is unfit for religious use; but if it occurred in the margin it remains fit.</p>
<p>If the letter <italic>waw</italic> [in a <italic>mezuzah</italic>] was shaped like a <italic>zayin</italic> or <italic>vice versa</italic>, curved letters like straight-lined letters<sup><xref rid="fn2299">2</xref></sup> or <italic>vice versa</italic>, open letters closed<sup><xref rid="fn2300">3</xref></sup> or <italic>vice versa</italic>, or if the shape of its letters had been altered [in any other way], or if it was written in [obsolete] Hebrew, it is unfit for religious use.</p>
<p label="4.">A magazine for straw, a wood-shed [and any] storage room are exempt [from the <italic>mezuzah</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn2301">4</xref></sup> A stable for cattle is exempt, but if women make use of it<sup><xref rid="fn2302">5</xref></sup> it is liable. Cone-shaped huts,<sup><xref rid="fn2303">6</xref></sup> travellers&#x2019; stations, field sheds<sup><xref rid="fn2304">7</xref></sup> and tanneries are exempt from <italic>mezuzah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2305">8</xref></sup></p>
<p label="5.">A bath-house is exempt, but if a dwelling-house adjoins it the outer doorway is liable.</p>
<p label="6.">A corner doorway that has only one doorpost, [or] a doorway made in [a structure of] boards which has only one doorpost is liable. R. Eliezer b. Jacob declares it exempt.</p>
<p label="7.">Arched doorways are exempt, but R. Meir and R. Judah declare that they are liable. All, however, agree that if they have the [usual] structure below<sup><xref rid="fn2306">9</xref></sup> and the arched section above they are liable to <italic>mezuzah</italic>.</p>
<p label="8.">City gates, the gates of open places<sup><xref rid="fn2307">10</xref></sup> and the gates of Temple Courts are exempt.<sup><xref rid="fn2308">11</xref></sup> [The doorways of] chambers in the Temple were exempt from <italic>mezuzah</italic>, but the Chamber of the Counsellors,<sup><xref rid="fn2309">12</xref></sup> which served as a residence for the High Priest on seven days in the year,<sup><xref rid="fn2310">13</xref></sup> and potters&#x2019; booths are subject to <italic>mezuzah</italic>. R. Jose declares them exempt.</p>
<ftnote id="fn2298">(1) There was a heathen practice to remove the heart from an animal while it was still alive and offer it as a sacrifice. Rabbinic law regards such an animal as an idolatrous offering (cf. Mishnah &#x2018;A.Z. 29b, Sonc. ed., p. 145) and forbids its entire use, including the skin.</ftnote>

Maimonides understood the term to mean &#x2018;summer-house&#x2019;, thatched on top and open on the four sides.

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER II</title>
<p label="1.">The <italic>mezuzah</italic> is placed<sup><xref rid="fn2311">1</xref></sup> on the right-hand side of the entrance from the street into the lodge, and [on the right-hand side of] the exit from the courtyard into the lodge.<sup><xref rid="fn2312">2</xref></sup></p>
<p label="2.">If a garden has a doorpost where it adjoins the courtyard, the <italic>mezuzah</italic> is placed [on the right-hand side of] the exit from the garden into the courtyard; and if a lodge is attached to it,<sup><xref rid="fn2313">3</xref></sup> <italic>mezuzoth</italic> are to be placed on both doorways [of the lodge].</p>
<p label="3.">Where small rooms open into a reception room,<sup><xref rid="fn2314">4</xref></sup> the <italic>mezuzah</italic> is placed on that doorway which is customarily used.<sup><xref rid="fn2315">5</xref></sup> If they are all customarily used, <italic>mezuzoth</italic> are placed on all the doorways.</p>
<p label="4.">If a number of rooms have doorways leading from one room to the other,<sup><xref rid="fn2316">6</xref></sup> <italic>mezuzoth</italic> are placed at the entrance of each one of them. R. Judah says: If the ladder is movable on the four sides&#x2026;.<sup><xref rid="fn2317">7</xref></sup></p>
<p label="5.">If a doorway leads from a roof [into a room], the <italic>mezuzah</italic> is placed [on the right-hand side of] the entrance from the roof. R. Nathan b. R. Jose said: In such a case Beth Shammai hold that the doorway is subject to <italic>mezuzah</italic> and Beth Hillel hold that it is exempt.</p>
<p label="6.">In a booth that is set back<sup><xref rid="fn2318">8</xref></sup> from [the edge of] a roof the <italic>mezuzah</italic> is to be placed [on the right-hand side of] the exit from the booth to the roof. R. Jose says: [On the right-hand side of the entrance] from the roof to the booth.</p>
<p label="7.">In the case of a portico that is set back from the rooms and has no other exit,<sup><xref rid="fn2319">9</xref></sup> the <italic>mezuzah</italic> is placed [on the right-hand side of] the exit from the portico into the rooms. R. Jose says: [On the right-hand side of] the entrance from the rooms to the portico.</p>
<p label="8.">If an entrance serves as two doorways and a wall [of not more than] one handbreath in width [separates them], only one <italic>mezuzah</italic> is to be affixed, according to R. Judah. [If the wall was] wider than that two <italic>mezuzoth</italic> are required.</p>
<p label="9.">The <italic>mezuzah</italic> is placed in the upper half of the doorpost;<sup><xref rid="fn2320">10</xref></sup> so R. Meir. R. Judah says: [It should be placed] below the handbreadth [from the top of the doorpost] and above one handbreadth [from the bottom].</p>
<p label="10.">If one made a groove in the wall at a distance of [not more than] one handbreadth [from the doorpost], and placed [the <italic>mezuzah</italic>] in it, the <italic>mezuzah</italic> is valid. [If the distance] was greater than that it is invalid.</p>
<p>If one made a groove in a stick and put the <italic>mezuzah</italic> in it, it is invalid. If one inserted [the <italic>mezuzah</italic>] in a tube and hung it up behind the door [or] behind the doorpost,<sup><xref rid="fn2321">11</xref></sup> R. Meir declared it valid, but R. Judah declared it invalid.</p>
<p label="11.">A new house is subject to the obligation of <italic>mezuzah</italic> as soon as it is completed.</p>
<p label="12.">One who lodges in an inn in the Land of Israel for thirty days is subject to the obligation of <italic>mezuzah</italic>, and if one rents [a house] he must affix [a <italic>mezuzah</italic>] forthwith. Outside the Land of Israel, [one who lives in an inn] is exempt, and one who rents [a house] must affix [a <italic>mezuzah</italic>] after thirty days.</p>
<p label="13.">[A Jew] who rents a house from a Gentile or from a Samaritan must affix a <italic>mezuzah</italic> forthwith, and when he quits he must remove it; but if one rents a house from an Israelite, he affixes the <italic>mezuzah</italic> forthwith and when he quits he must not remove it.</p>
<p label="14.">One who buys a house from a Gentile or a Samaritan is under the obligation of putting a <italic>mezuzah</italic>, but [if he bought it] from an Israelite it is presumed [to have been provided with the necessary <italic>mezuzoth</italic>].</p>
<p label="15.">If one buys a brick-mould from a Gentile, he should not heat it before he had examined it.</p>
<p>[The scroll in] the <italic>mezuzah</italic> should be examined once in twenty-five years, according to R. Simeon. R. Jacob says: A much longer time [may be allowed to intervene]. Both, however, agree that if it was transferred from one place to another it requires examination.</p>
<p>In like manner, water-tanks<sup><xref rid="fn2322">12</xref></sup> in a public domain must be examined once in seven years, but those situated in a private domain once in twenty-five years, according to R. Meir; but the Sages say: In either case the general rule is that wherever there is a top cover<sup><xref rid="fn2323">13</xref></sup> the examination takes place once in seven years, and where there is no top cover the examination takes place once in twenty-five years.</p>
