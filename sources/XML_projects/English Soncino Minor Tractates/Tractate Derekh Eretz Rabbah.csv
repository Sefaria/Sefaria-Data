Version Notes,
"Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah, Introduction.1","<small>NAME OF THE TRACTATE</small><br/><i>Derek ’Ereẓ</i> is the title of two tractates: <i>Rabbah</i> (the large) and <i>Zuṭa</i> (the small). They consist mainly of moral and ethical teachings. Contrary to what we might expect, they are not larger and shorter divisions of the same treatise, but independent works with but little in common. Consequently, the terms <i>Rabbah</i> and <i>Zuṭa</i> cannot have been parts of the original titles."
"Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah, Introduction.2","Many passages in <i>Derek ’Ereẓ</i> are to be found, with slight variations, in the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds. For other sayings, however, no source is found in Rabbinic literature. This would indicate that these collections of Baraithoth belong mainly to the period of the <i>Tannaïm</i>. Subsequently, additions were made to the original text, since the tractates include dicta from much later authorities."
"Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah, Introduction.3","Among the early authorities the treatises were known as <i>Hilkoth</i> (the laws of) D.E., <i>Masseketh</i> (tractate) D.E., <i>Middoth</i> (rules of) D.E., <i>Pirḳë</i> (chapters of) D.E., <i>Mishnath</i> (the Mishnah of) D.E., or simply <i>Derek ’Ereẓ</i>. In the current editions printed in the Talmud, the tractates <i>Rabbah</i> and <i>Zuṭa</i> each consists of eleven chapters, several in the former being somewhat longer than in the latter. The text for the present translation follows in the main that of the Wilna-Romm edition; but note has been taken of the most important variants found in MSS. and other printed editions, some of which have been adopted in the translation, with explanations in the notes. Constant reference has also been made to the variant readings and emendations of the Wilna Gaon (GRA), as well as other commentaries printed in the same edition of the Talmud."
"Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah, Introduction.4","The term <i>Derek ’Ereẓ</i> signifies ‘good manners, propriety, correct behaviour, refinement, etiquette’. These have always been regarded as most important in Jewish life. Already in the Bible many instances are recorded of good manners and correct conduct. To quote but a few: the filial love and respect shown by Shem and Japheth in covering the nakedness of their father, Noah; Abraham waiving his right as the elder and allowing his nephew, Lot, to choose the land he desired; Abraham’s hospitality to the angels; Rebekah’s kindness to Eliezer and his camels; the gallantry displayed by Moses in helping Jethro’s daughters, which may serve as an instance of respect towards women; the command to rise before the aged and honour the elder; the duty to assist the poor with interestfree loans; the precept of humanitarianism and charitableness towards an enemy and his animals; the laws guaranteeing civil, moral and religious rights to the stranger and proselyte; and the exhortation to avoid personal and moral pollution by keeping the camp holy."
"Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah, Introduction.5",<small>ANALYSIS OF THE TRACTATE</small>
"Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah, Introduction.6","The first two chapters were also known under the title Tractate <i>‘Arayoth</i> (prohibited marriages). According to the Wilna Gaon, they do not belong here but to <i>Kallah</i>. Several MSS., indeed, begin DER at the third chapter, and in them the whole work is entitled <i>Pereḳ Ben ‘Azzai</i> from the opening words. The author of the Maḥzor Viṭri (who was a disciple of Rashi) makes this tractate begin with the fourth chapter. Both these variants are noted in the current editions printed in the Talmud."
"Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah, Introduction.7","In Coronel’s edition of <i>Ḥamishshah Ḳunṭrasim</i> (1864) we find many passages in <i>Kallah</i> which are more suitable in <i>Derek ’Ereẓ</i>. Hence both these tractates may have been compiled about the same time, some passages becoming misplaced. In the view of Coronel there was also a Gemara attached to this tractate (as with <i>Kallah Rabbathi</i>) which antedated the redaction of the Talmud. But from a study of the language and style of the last-named it would seem to belong to a later period."
"Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah, Introduction.8","The first chapter was probably a separate work. It deals with marriages which are forbidden on account of consanguinity and concludes with some ethical maxims on the subject of marriage. The second chapter, too, may have been a separate collection, because its subject-matter is entirely different from the first. It contains reflections on twelve classes of persons who are to be condemned and twelve who are to be commended, with Biblical texts appropriate to each. Then comes a list of sins which bring about the eclipse of the heavenly luminaries and other misfortunes, and the chapter ends with some mystic remarks on God and Israel and the three hundred and ninety heavens."
"Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah, Introduction.9","The following chapters, much of whose contents is also found in ARN, consist of ethical, moral and social teachings generally expressed in pithy sentences, arranged in the style of the <i>Pirḳë Aboth</i>, except that they are anonymous. They conclude with a list of occupations which are to be avoided, followed by a collection of liturgical prayers for special occasions."
"Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah, Introduction.10",<small>DATE OF COMPOSITION AND THE TEXT</small>
"Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah, Introduction.11","As already stated, the nucleus of the tractate was composed in the Tannaitic period, to which were added teachings of the early ’<i>Amoraïm</i>. Not only is the meaning of some passages so obscure that we must assume that obvious errors must have crept in, but some passages are clearly out of place. The current text is often corrupt. There are MSS. and editions of both <i>Rabbah</i> and <i>Zuṭa</i> which contain numerous variations both in text and order. Rabbi Dr. M. Higger, in his edition (New York, 1935), lists the most important of these differences."
"Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah, Introduction.12","The following reasons may be suggested as accounting for these variations. We must recognize a distinction between literature in the strict sense, i.e. a work composed in accordance with literary rules and conventions, and a compilation which was intended for oral transmission and only later reduced to writing. Each has its own characteristics. Oral tradition tends to develop certain peculiarities to aid the memory; e.g. the grouping together in convenient summaries of ten, seven, five or three; the juxtaposition of certain laws or sayings which have a common catchword."
"Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah, Introduction.13","With literary composition of the strict kind, on the other hand, the logical connection is the rule to be followed. From the Rabbinic dictum, ‘The words transmitted orally thou art not at liberty to recite from writing’ (Giṭ. 60b, Sonc. ed., p. 284), some scholars have inferred that no records of the oral Torah existed before the fifth century <small>C.E.</small>, the great mass of rulings and opinions which developed through the centuries being retained in the Schools entirely without the aid of writing. But this view is based on a misinterpretation of the passage. It only means that the oral Torah may not be committed to writing to be used as textbooks in the Schools."
"Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah, Introduction.14","The objection to committing the oral Torah to writing arose from the fear that it might become confused with, and be given the same authority as, the text of the Torah. But the teachers must have possessed much material in written form, and no doubt prepared their lectures from collections of this kind, treating them, however, for reference only and not as textbooks. They were not allowed to read their lecture from MS., to avoid creating the impression that the discourse carried the same authority as the Scriptures. Even Rabbi Judah the Prince, who, as many maintain, wrote down the Mishnah, as did R. ‘Aḳiba and R. Meir before him in their codifications, intended it to be a work of reference and not a textbook."
"Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah, Introduction.15","Teaching continued to be oral and from memory until the sixth century, when new conditions demanded a change in method. The material was by that time too vast to be retained by memory only. The existence of the Academies was threatened by persecution, and it was resolved to reduce to definitive form all that had hitherto been preserved orally."
"Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah, Introduction.16","If errors could creep into <i>halakic</i> (legal) material, as we find, though great care must have been taken against this happening, how much more so with a subject like <i>Derek ’Ereẓ</i>, especially if it was committed to writing only after a lapse of time! Whereas with <i>halakah</i> notes of legal decisions might have been sufficient to aid one’s memory, with <i>Derek ’Ereẓ</i> the need was felt to have fuller notes, perhaps for the guidance of one’s family circle. In such a collection errors inevitably crept into the text, either from lapse of memory or through copyists’ mistakes."
"Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah, Introduction.17","[In the Talmud editions the chapters are not subdivided into paragraphs and numbered, but for the sake of convenience this is done in the translation according to Higger’s edition.]"
"Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah, Introduction.18",M.GINSBERG.
Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah.1.1,"When a man betroths<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) On the terms ‘betrothal’ and ‘marriage’ in Jewish law, cf. <i>Kallah</i>, p. 401, n. 1.</i> a woman, he debars himself from [marrying] seven blood relations, viz.: her mother, her mother’s mother, her father’s mother, her daughter, her son’s daughter, her daughter’s daughter and her sister while she herself is alive.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) Cf. Yeb. 40a, b (Sonc. ed., p. 249).</i> In all these who are prohibited to him, the interdict is never lifted except in the case of his wife’s sister who is forbidden to him only during her lifetime;<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) Cf. Lev. 18, 18.</i> and never does he disqualify his wife [from cohabitation with him] through [his intercourse] with her mother, her daughter or her sister.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) The law applies to all the seven relatives. The three are mentioned probably because one might have thought that, on account of their close relationship, his wife would in such a circumstance be forbidden to him. Cf. Yeb. 94b-95a (Sonc. ed., pp. 643ff.).</i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah.1.2,"If [after betrothal the woman] was raped, she is permitted to him,<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) Cf. Deut. 22, 23-27.</i> but should she have been a willing party she is forbidden to him. If she is the wife of a <i>kohen</i>, she is forbidden to him whether [it happened] under force or with her consent. [For it is stated, <i>And she be not seized</i><sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) Num. 5, 13, E.V. <i>neither she be taken in the act.</i> The phrase is interpreted by the Rabbis in the sense that she did not act under compulsion but willingly, referring to a married woman who was defiled secretly without witnesses to testify against her.</i>—[only then] is she forbidden; if, however, she was <i>seized</i><sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) i.e. violated by force.</i> she is permitted. There is another class of woman who is forbidden [to her husband] even though she had been <i>seized;</i> and who is that? The wife of a <i>kohen</i>.<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) Cf. Yeb. 56b (Sonc. ed., p. 378), Keth. 51b (Sonc. ed., p. 298).</i> R. Ishmael<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) According to R. Ishmael there is no distinction between the wife of a <i>kohen</i> and a lay-Israelite in the case of rape.</i> said: <i>And she be not seized</i> she is forbidden; consequently if she had been <i>seized</i> she is permitted. There is another class of woman who is permitted [to her husband] even if she had not been <i>seized;</i> and who is that? A woman whose betrothal was mistaken.<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) If, e.g., a condition were attached to the betrothal that remained unfulfilled. In such a case the woman may leave her husband without a <i>geṭ</i>, and in any subsequent intercourse, whether forced or willing, her status is that of an unmarried woman who had never been previously married. The passage within brackets is added by GRA and is necessary, otherwise R. Ishmael would be contradicting himself. Cf. Yeb. 100b (Sonc. ed., p. 692), Keth. <i>loc. cit.</i></i>]
If a divorcee who became betrothed was seduced, whether under force or of her free will, she is forbidden to return to her former husband.<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) If her second husband subsequently died or divorced her. She is, however, permitted to remarry her former husband after betrothal alone, where no marriage with the second man took place and he died.</i> This is the opinion of R. Jose b. Ḳippar in the name of R. Eleazar b. Shammua‘. This is the reasoning by which R. Jose b. Ḳippar expounded his view:<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) This is the reading of GRA as against V and H, who name R. Ishmael as the authority.</i> [It is written,] <i>Her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled</i>.<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">(13) Deut. 24, 4.</i> In what circumstances did she become defiled?<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">(14) If she was legally married to the second husband the term <i>defiled</i> is inapplicable.</i> It can only be explained by what the Sages have said: If a woman [after betrothal] was forcibly seduced, she is permitted to [her husband]; if she was a willing party she is forbidden to him; but in this case,<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">(15) Of the divorcee who became betrothed and was then seduced. This is the reading of GRA. V and H have ‘the wife of a <i>kohen’</i>.</i> whether under compulsion or of her free will she is forbidden to return to her former husband.<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">(16) So GRA. V and H ‘to him’.</i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah.1.3,"<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">(17) V and H insert here ‘and this is the reasoning by which R. Jose b. Ḳippar expounded in the name of R. Eleazar b. Shammua‘’.</i> None of the women forbidden to him on account of incest requires a <i>geṭ</i> from him if he married any of them<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">(18) Such an unlawful marriage is regarded merely as harlotry, and we do not fear lest people infer that a married woman may leave her husband and remarry without a <i>geṭ</i>.</i> except his wife’s sister,<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">(19) Whom he married after he had been told that his wife, who had gone overseas, was dead.</i> his brother’s wife<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">(20) Whom he married on the evidence that his brother (the woman’s husband) was dead but later returned. The requirement of a divorce in these cases is only a preventive measure against the possibility of assuming that the second marriage was legal, and hence inferring that a married woman may leave her husband to marry another without a <i>geṭ</i>.</i> and a married woman,<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">(21) Whose husband was reported by one witness to be dead and she remarried with the sanction of a <i>Beth Din</i> who accepted the evidence, and later the husband returned. In such a case the woman requires a divorce from her second husband as a preventive measure against the possibility of assuming that the first had divorced her and the second had married her legally, and consequently a married woman may leave her husband without a <i>geṭ.</i> Cf. Yeb. 94b (Sonc. ed., p. 641).</i> because these have a termination to their prohibition.<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">(22) lit. ‘a permission after their prohibition’; e.g. by the death of his wife, by the death of his brother and by being divorced.</i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah.1.4,"The following exposition was given by R. Ḥanina b. Uri before [a gathering of] the Sages in the name of R. Nathan: Anyone who is included in the category <i>Shall not enter</i> [<i>into the assembly of the Lord</i>]<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">(23) Deut. 23, 2-4.</i> disqualifies a woman by his cohabitation<sup>24</sup><i class=""footnote"">(24) From marrying a <i>kohen</i> or from eating <i>terumah</i> if she was the daughter of a <i>kohen.</i> Cf. Ḳid. 74b (Sonc. ed., pp. 381f.).</i> and disqualifies the child.<sup>25</sup><i class=""footnote"">(25) From his marriage. Such a child cannot be counted as belonging to the community. The reading of GRA is followed.</i> They are: an Ammonite,<sup>26</sup><i class=""footnote"">(26) Deut. 23, 4.</i> Moabite,<sup>27</sup><i class=""footnote"">(27) <i>ibid.</i></i> Egyptian,<sup>28</sup><i class=""footnote"">(28) <i>ibid.</i> 8f.</i> Idumean,<sup>29</sup><i class=""footnote"">(29) <i>ibid.</i></i> slave, bastard, <i>nathin</i>,<sup>30</sup><i class=""footnote"">(30) A descendant of the Gibeonites; cf. Josh. 9, 27.</i> Samaritan<sup>31</sup><i class=""footnote"">(31) Cuthean (Samaritan) was probably substituted from fear of the censor for an original <i>goï</i> (heathen).</i> and a <i>ḥalal</i>.<sup>32</sup><i class=""footnote"">(32) One unfit for the priesthood on account of his father’s illegitimacy.</i> The daughter of a <i>ḥalal</i> is fit<sup>33</sup><i class=""footnote"">(33) To marry even a <i>kohen.</i></i> although [her father] is within [the category of] <i>shall not enter</i>.<sup>34</sup><i class=""footnote"">(34) This is in accordance with the opinion of R. Dosethai b. Judah in Ḳid. 77a (Sonc. ed., p. 395), who maintained that as the sons of Israel are a <i>miḳweh</i> of purification for <i>ḥalaloth</i>, so are the daughters a <i>miḳweh</i> of purification for <i>ḥalalim</i>, so that their issue is eligible for the priesthood. The Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i>) states: The daughter of a <i>ḥalal</i> is unfit to the priesthood for all time.</i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah.1.5,"If a man had intercourse with any of the women prohibited to him as forbidden relatives, he is still permitted to marry her near relatives.<sup>35</sup><i class=""footnote"">(35) Only relatives of a married wife are subject to the law of incest.</i> [For instance,] he who had intercourse with a married woman is permitted to marry her daughter."
Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah.1.6,"This is the question which R. Jose b. Taddai of Tiberias put to Rabban Gamaliel: If I, who may cohabit with my wife, am prohibited from marrying her daughter, how much more should I be prohibited from marrying the daughter of a married woman, seeing that I am prohibited from cohabiting with her!<sup>36</sup><i class=""footnote"">(36) The purpose of this <i>a fortiori</i> argument is to point out that one should not be allowed to marry anyone except the daughter of a widow or of a divorcee, because these are no longer a man’s wife.</i> He replied to him: Go and provide me [a wife] for the High Priest of whom it is written, <i>A virgin of his own people shall he take to wife</i>,<sup>37</sup><i class=""footnote"">(37) Lev. 21, 14.</i> and I will provide you [with wives] for Israel.<sup>38</sup><i class=""footnote"">(38) Since a High Priest may not marry a widow or a divorcee, their daughters also ought to be prohibited according to R. Jose’s argument, and this would be contrary to the Scriptural text. Hence the reasoning must be fallacious. The premise is false, viz. that he is permitted to cohabit with his wife who was the daughter of a married woman.</i> Another explanation<sup>39</sup><i class=""footnote"">(39) The Yalḳuṭ omits the words ‘another explanation’.</i> [in refutation of the reasoning is that] we do not use an <i>a fortiori</i> argument to abrogate a specific law of Scripture.<sup>40</sup><i class=""footnote"">(40) It is explicitly stated, <i>He shall take to wife</i>, but if we adopt R. Jose’s argument, a High Priest could never marry.</i> Rabban Gamaliel excommunicated him.<sup>41</sup><i class=""footnote"">(41) The Yalḳuṭ omits this sentence.</i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah.1.7,"If a man cohabits with any woman forbidden him as incest, he does not thereby disqualify her from marrying a <i>kohen</i>.<sup>42</sup><i class=""footnote"">(42) Cf. Yeb. 61b (Sonc. ed., p. 409) where R. ‘Aḳiba maintains that the term <i>harlot</i> forbidden to a <i>kohen</i> applies only to one who is in fact a prostitute. GRA omits ‘not’. Higger quotes the suggestion of Prof. L. Ginzberg that there is a scribal error through dittography and the text should read: ‘Not only is the child a bastard but he even disqualifies her from marrying a <i>kohen’</i>.</i> [If a <i>kohen</i> cohabits with his wife when she is] <i>niddah</i>, although he is liable to a penalty for the intercourse,<sup>43</sup><i class=""footnote"">(43) Cf. Lev. 18, 19.</i> the child [who is conceived] is qualified to stand and offer sacrifices upon the altar.<sup>44</sup><i class=""footnote"">(44) The offspring of a forbidden but valid marriage cannot be considered a <i>ḥalal.</i> Cf. Yeb. 60a (Sonc. ed., p. 399).</i>
A woman who had intercourse with that which is not a human being,<sup>45</sup><i class=""footnote"">(45) i.e. an animal; <i>ibid.</i> 59b (Sonc. ed., p. 397).</i> although she is in consequence subject to the penalty of <i>kareth</i>,<sup>46</sup><i class=""footnote"">(46) If the offence was committed in the presence of witnesses after due warning, the penalty is stoning (Lev. 20, 16); in the absence of witnesses and warning, she is under the penalty of <i>kareth.</i></i> she is not disqualified from marrying a <i>kohen</i>. R. Jose said: It once happened at Haitali<sup>47</sup><i class=""footnote"">(47) The Babylonian form of Aitalu, the modern Aiterun, N.W. of Ḳadesh; cf. S. Klein, <i>Beiträge</i>, p. 47.</i> that while a young woman was cleaning the floor<sup>48</sup><i class=""footnote"">(48) lit. ‘house’; she must have been kneeling.</i> a gorilla<sup>49</sup><i class=""footnote"">(49) In Yeb. <i>loc. cit.</i>, ‘a wild dog’.</i> came and covered her from the rear. When the case came before the Sages, they did not disqualify her from marrying a <i>kohen</i>."
Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah.1.8,"The following are the forbidden relatives in the second degree: his father’s mother, his mother’s mother,<sup>50</sup><i class=""footnote"">(50) The Bible only prohibits a man’s mother and the Rabbis extended the prohibition to his mother’s mother on account of his mother. His father’s mother is likewise prohibited as they are both called ‘grand-mothers’.</i> the wife of his mother’s father, the wife of his father’s father,<sup>51</sup><i class=""footnote"">(51) The previous note applies here <i>mutatis mutandis</i>.</i> the wife of his son’s son, the wife of his daughter’s son, the wife of a father’s maternal brother, the wife of a mother’s paternal brother. Bar Ḳappara adds the mother of his father’s father and the mother of his mother’s father. The wife of his father’s brother is forbidden to him<sup>52</sup><i class=""footnote"">(52) Lev. 18, 14.</i> but the daughter [his cousin] is permitted to him; his father’s brother is permitted to marry his<sup>53</sup><i class=""footnote"">(53) The nephew’s.</i> wife or his daughter; the wife of his mother’s brother is forbidden to him but his daughter is permitted to him. His mother’s brother is permitted to marry [the nephew’s] wife or daughter.
A man is permitted to marry the wife of his father-in-law<sup>54</sup><i class=""footnote"">(54) Cf. Yeb. 21a (Sonc. ed., p. 124).</i> and the wife of his son-in-law, but the Sages said that the wife of his father-in-law is not permitted to him because of appearance’s sake; [the mother-in-law’s] daughter is permitted to him.<sup>55</sup><i class=""footnote"">(55) After the death of her sister, his wife.</i> A man may not marry the daughter of his stepson,<sup>56</sup><i class=""footnote"">(56) It is forbidden in Lev. 18, 17, and is not an incest of the second degree. It is only included here on account of the clause that follows. Cf. Yeb. <i>loc. cit.</i></i> but [the stepson’s] wife is permitted to him. His stepson is permitted to marry [the stepfather’s] wife and daughter. A man may marry the wife of his brother’s son and the wife of his sister’s son.<sup>57</sup><i class=""footnote"">(57) This is a repetition of what is stated above in connection with a nephew’s wife and daughter. [A table of prohibited marriages is provided in Hertz, <i>The Pentateuch and Haftorahs</i>, Leviticus, pp. 186f., Sonc. ed., p. 559.]</i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah.1.9,"If a man remarried his divorced wife after her marriage [with a second husband who subsequently died or divorced her], he may not cohabit with her, neither may a levir marry her [if her husband died childless].<sup>58</sup><i class=""footnote"">(58) So GRA.

A man who married a sister of his brother’s divorced wife or a sister of his brother’s <i>ḥaluẓah</i>, [though this sister] is permitted to her husband she is forbidden to the levir [if her husband died childless].
The wife of a man crushed in his privy parts who has a fit brother, though forbidden to her husband,<sup>63</sup><i class=""footnote"">(63) Cf. Deut. 23, 2.</i> is permitted to the levir. A <i>soṭah</i> is forbidden both to the husband and to the levir.<sup>64</sup><i class=""footnote"">(64) lit. ‘to this one and to that one’.</i> A <i>ḥaluẓah</i> is likewise forbidden to both.

Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah.1.10,"A female proselyte, captive woman, freed woman,<sup>65</sup><i class=""footnote"">(65) These are presumed to have had intercourse.</i> the widow of one who was of mixed family,<sup>66</sup><i class=""footnote"">(66) lit. ‘a widow of dough’. ‘Dough’ is a designation for a mixed community or family, i.e. with an admixture of illegitimate persons or persons of doubtful legitimacy. The reference here is to a girl, and not necessarily to a widow of a member, of such a mixed family. This is in accordance with the opinion of Rabban Gamaliel; cf. Keth. 14a (Sonc. ed., p. 76).</i> a <i>soṭah</i>, [56<i>a</i>] <i>ḥaluẓah</i>, divorcee and a <i>ḥalalah</i> are unfit to marry a <i>kohen</i>.

Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah.1.11,"He who cohabits with a maidservant is liable to the penalty for transgressing fourteen negative commands and also to the penalty of <i>kareth</i> at the hand of Heaven, viz.: <i>Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind;</i><sup>68</sup><i class=""footnote"">(68) Lev. 19, 19.

Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah.4.2,"You should always be pleasant on entering and leaving [a house]. Spend less time on business and occupy yourself with [the study of] the Torah. It once happened that R. Simeon b. Eleazar<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) Others read ‘R. Eleazar b. R. Simeon’. But the story here related is more befitting the character of his son, R. Simeon. Cf. B.M. 85a (Sonc. ed., p. 487).</i> was coming from Migdal Eder<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) In the extreme south of Judah.</i> from the house of his teacher and was riding leisurely on his ass by the seaside.<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) In Ta‘an. 20a (Sonc. ed., p. 100) ‘riverside’.</i> A certain man<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) According to some it was Elijah who wanted to teach him a lesson.</i> chanced to meet him, who was exceedingly ugly. He said to him, ‘Raḳa,<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) lit. ‘empty one’, good-for-nothing.</i> how ugly are the children of Abraham our father!’<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) Some versions read: ‘Are all your fellow-citizens as ugly as you?’ Cf. above, p. 295.</i> The other replied, ‘What can I do for you? Speak to the Craftsman Who made me’. R. Simeon b. Eleazar immediately dismounted from the ass, prostrated himself before him<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) R. Simeon realized that he had done wrong.</i> and said to him, ‘I apologize to you, forgive me’. He replied to him, ‘I will not forgive you until you go to the Craftsman Who made me and say to Him, “How ugly is the vessel which You have made!” ’ R. Simeon walked behind him for three <i>mil</i>.<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) V and H ‘half a <i>mil’</i>.</i> When his fellow-citizens heard [of his arrival] they came out to meet him, greeting him with the words, ‘Peace be upon you, Rabbi’. The man said to them, ‘Whom are you calling Rabbi?’ They answered, ‘He who is walking behind you’. Thereupon he exclaimed, ‘If this man be a Rabbi, may there not be any more like him in Israel!’ He told them the whole story. They earnestly begged him to pardon him, and he replied, ‘I will forgive him, but only on condition that he does not act<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) So GRA and H. V has ‘speak’.</i> in the same manner again’.
That same day R. Simeon sat and expounded in his great Academy: Be always pliable like the reed and not unyielding like the cedar. In the case of a reed, though the four winds of the world were to blow upon it, the reed bends with them, and when the winds drop, it remains standing in its place, with the result that one is able to make a pen of it to write a scroll of the Torah. But the cedar is not like that: if the east, north [or] west wind blows upon it, it cannot move it from its place; but as soon as the south wind blows upon it, it uproots it and the result is that people come and cut it up,<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) The translation follows the corrected text of GRA.</i> chop it and use it for building houses, and what is left is used for firewood. Therefore the Sages said: Be always pliable like the reed and not unyielding like the cedar.<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) Cf. Ta‘an <i>loc. cit.</i></i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah.4.3,"How does one honour his teacher? When they are both walking along the way, he must place himself at his<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) The teacher’s.</i> left hand and not at his right. If three [were walking together] and a Sage or a teacher was among them, the teacher is to be in the middle, the more important of the other two on his right and the less important on his left. We find it so in connection with the three angels who came to Abraham our father, viz. Gabriel, Michael and Raphael. Gabriel came to overthrow Sodom and Gomorrah, Raphael came to heal Abraham<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">(13) Of the effects of his circumcision.</i> and Michael came to announce to Sarah [that she would have a son]. Michael was in the middle, Gabriel on his right and Raphael on his left.<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">(14) Cf. Yoma 37a (Sonc. ed., p. 172).</i> When Abraham our father saw the Ministering Angels, the Divine Presence appeared and stood over him. He said to them, ‘Sires, wait until I take leave of the Divine Presence, which is greater than you’, as it is stated, <i>And he said: My lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant</i>.<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">(15) Gen. 18, 3. Abraham addressed the chief of them and consequently the word <i>lord</i> does not signify God. Others interpret that he spoke to God, praying Him to wait until he had attended to his guests. They therefore cite here <i>ibid.</i> XVII, 22, <i>And He left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.</i></i>
When Abraham our father had taken leave of the Divine Presence, he came, bowed to them and led them beneath the tree, as it is stated, <i>Let now a little water be fetched, and wash your feet</i>,<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">(16) <i>ibid.</i> XVIII, 4.</i> and afterwards [it is written], <i>And I will fetch a morsel of bread</i>.<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">(17) <i>ibid.</i> 5.</i> But [when the angels came] to Lot, what did he say? <i>And tarry all night, and wash your feet</i>.<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">(18) <i>ibid.</i> XIX, 2. Abraham had mistaken the angels for Arabs, who worship the dust of their feet and, being anxious not to introduce idolatry in any form into his house, he asked them to wash their feet first. Lot, however, who had no such anxiety, offered them a night’s lodging before asking them to wash their feet. Others, who give the interpretation which follows in the text, maintain that Lot also was anxious that they should first wash their feet, a custom he had learnt from Abraham; but the reason that he told them to stay the night before washing was to deceive the people of Sodom.</i> Others say: Lot spoke to them [in this manner] only as a clever device. He said [to himself], ‘If [the men of Sodom] find them with their faces, hands and feet already washed, the result will be that they will kill me, my wife and my daughters.<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">(19) For not reporting their arrival earlier.</i> Let them, therefore, find them with the dust still on their feet, and they will think that they have only just arrived’."
Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah.5.1,"He who walks behind his teacher may not leave him without first obtaining his permission. If they were both equal in learning, the host enters [the house] first and then the guest, but when leaving the guest goes out first and the host leaves last.<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">(20) The reason is not to leave the wife unprotected; cf.

Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah.5.2,"A person should never leave [the company of his teacher or even] his fellow unless he had previously obtained his consent. All can learn such good manners from the All-present, Who said, as it were, to Abraham, ‘I am now leaving’, as it is stated, <i>And the Lord went His way</i>,<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) God notified Abraham that He was departing.</i> <i>as soon as He had left off speaking to Abraham; and Abraham returned unto his place</i>.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) Gen. 18, 33.

The story is told of the four Sages, viz. Rabban Gamaliel, R. Joshua, R. Eleazar b. Azariah and R. ‘Aḳiba, who were on their way to attend a Privy Council<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) Or, lit. ‘an interior kingdom’.</i> which also included a certain philosopher as a member. R. Joshua said to Rabban Gamaliel, ‘Master, would you like us to call on our companion the philosopher?’<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) To confer with him before the meeting.</i> He replied, ‘No’. In the morning he again asked him, ‘Master, would you like us to call on our companion the philosopher?’ He replied, ‘Yes’. R. Joshua went and knocked on the door. The philosopher thought and said [to himself], ‘This can only be the manners of a Sage’. [When he knocked] a second time, [the philosopher] got up and washed his face, hands and feet. On the third knock he arose and opened the door and saw the Sages of Israel coming all together.<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) lit. ‘some from here and some from there’.</i> Rabban Gamaliel was in the middle, R. Joshua and R. Eleazar b. Azariah on his right and R. ‘Aḳiba on his left.
The philosopher was meditating and saying [to himself], ‘How shall I greet these Sages of Israel? If I say, “Peace be upon you, Rabban Gamaliel”, I shall be guilty of derogatory conduct towards the [other] Sages. If I say, “Peace be upon you, Sages of Israel”, that would be an insult to Rabban Gamaliel’.<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) Who had the title of Prince or Patriarch, and was President of the Great Sanhedrin in Jerusalem.</i> As soon as he approached them, he greeted them with the words, ‘Peace be upon you, Sages of Israel, headed by Rabban Gamaliel’.
(We learn [this rule of etiquette] not from [this story of] Rabban Gamaliel but from the Divine Presence, as it is stated, <i>I saw the Lord sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right hand and on His left</i>.)<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) 1 Kings 22, 19.

Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah.6.1,"Always let all people [who visit you] be regarded by you as robbers, but show them the same respect as to Rabban Gamaliel. The story is told of R. Joshua on whom a certain person called early in the morning. He gave him food and drink, and took him up to the loft to sleep and then removed the ladder from under him. What did that man do? He arose in the middle of the night, collected the vessels<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) Which were stored in the loft.</i> and wrapped them up in his cloak. As soon as he started to descend,<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) Thinking that the ladder was still there.</i> he fell from the loft and broke his neck. When morning came, R. Joshua rose early and found him where he had fallen. He said to him, ‘Raḳa!<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">(13) Cf. p. 545, n. 5.</i> do all persons act as you have?’ He replied, ‘Master, I did not know that you had removed the ladder from under me’. He said to him, ‘Raḳa! Do you not know that already yesterday<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">(14) From the moment you arrived</i> we were suspicious of you?’ Hence R. Joshua said: Always let all men be in your eyes as robbers, but show them the same respect as to Rabban Gamaliel."
Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah.6.2,"If one enters a house [by invitation], whatever the host tells him he must do.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) Some eds. add: ‘providing it is a thing permitted to be done’. Cf. Pes. 86b (Sonc. ed., p. 456, n. 6) where the margin adds ‘except depart’. This is probably meant humorously—a guest should not outstay his welcome until he is told to go! Others read <span dir=""rtl"">מצא</span> for <span dir=""rtl"">מדא</span> ‘except a forbidden thing’, which harmonizes with the addition in our text.</i> The story is told of R. Simeon b. Anṭipaṭros with whom many guests used to come and stay. When he pressed them to eat and drink, they vowed by the Torah that they would neither eat nor drink, but later they partook of food and drink. When the time came for them to depart he used to flagellate them. This matter came to the notice of Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai and the Sages who were angered by it. They said, ‘Who will go and inform us [of his action]?’ R. Joshua replied, ‘I will go and see how he conducts himself’.
He went and found him at the entrance of his house and greeted him, ‘Peace be upon you, Master’. The other replied, ‘Peace be upon you, Master and Teacher’. He said, ‘I need a lodging’. The other replied, ‘Lodge here in peace’. They sat down and occupied themselves in the study of the Torah until evening. In the morning [R. Joshua] said to him, ‘Master, I want to go to the bath-house’. He replied, ‘As you wish’;<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) Not a positive approval.</i> whereupon R. Joshua was afraid lest he would smite him on his thighs. After he returned [from the bath-house] they ate and drank. He then said, ‘Who will accompany me [on my way back]?’ The other replied, ‘I will’. R. Joshua was then meditating and saying [to himself], ‘What can I report to the Sages who sent me [to institute inquiries]?’<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) Since there was nothing untoward in the man’s behaviour.</i> He then turned [to look] back. [R. Simeon] asked him, ‘Master, why did you turn to look behind you?’ He replied, ‘I have something to ask you. Why did you flagellate other guests who stayed with you and me you did not flagellate?’ He said to him, ‘Master, you are a great Sage and you have good manners. The persons who stay with me I usually press to eat, but they vow by the Torah [not to eat] and transgress [their vow]; and so have I heard from the mouth of the Sages that whoever vows by the Torah and breaks his vow has to be given forty lashes’. He said to him, ‘May Heaven bless you for what you have done. By your life and by the life of your head! Whoever behaves in this manner, give him the forty lashes on your account [57<i>a</i>] and [another] forty on account of the Sages who sent me’.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) i.e. I do not mind how much you flagellate him.</i> R. Joshua returned and reported to the Sages what he had witnessed while he was with Simeon b. Anṭipaṭros."
Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah.6.3,"A man should never be fastidious concerning his meals. It once happened that Hillel the Elder had a certain man to a meal, when a poor person came and stood at his door and said, ‘I am to marry today and have no provisions at all’. Hillel’s wife took the entire meal [which she had prepared] and gave it to him. She then kneaded fresh dough, cooked another dinner and placed it before them. He said to her, ‘My dear, why did you not bring it to us sooner?’ She told him all that had happened. He said to her, ‘My dear, I, too, did not judge you in the scale of guilt but in the scale of merit, because everything you did was only in the name of Heaven’."
Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah.6.4,"We do not leave over a portion of the food in a stew-pot, but we should leave over a portion of the food in the dish.<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) The text is emended by GRA to agree with ‘Erub. 53b (Sonc. ed., p. 373). Cf. also Midrash Lamentations 1 (Sonc. ed., p. 85). V and H insert ‘not’ in the second instead of the first clause. When food is poured from the pot into the dish, none should be left over in the pot for the servant; but when the contents of the dish are ladled into the plates, some must be left in the dish for him.</i> It once happened that R. Joshua was the guest of a certain widow who served him with a dish of beans. He ate without leaving any. On the second occasion he also ate without leaving any. On the third occasion she over-seasoned it with salt; and as soon as R. Joshua tasted it he withdrew his hand from it and ate his bread dry. She asked, ‘Why did you withdraw your hand from the pounded beans?’ He replied, ‘I had already eaten earlier in the day’. She said to him, ‘You should then have withdrawn your hand also from the bread’. ‘Perhaps,’ she continued, ‘you left [the dish today] as compensation for the former meals!<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) When you ate it all.</i> But have not the Sages said: We do not leave over a portion of the food in the stew-pot but we should leave over a portion of the food in the dish!’<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) The corrected text of GRA is reproduced in translation. The hostess subtly rebuked R. Joshua for not having left some of the food.</i>
Hence R. Joshua said, ‘No one has ever had the better of me except this woman, a little boy and a little girl’. What was the incident with the little girl? Once R. Joshua was walking in a field when he met a little girl who called out to him, ‘Why are you walking across the field?’ He replied, ‘I am walking along a [trodden] path’. ‘Robbers like yourself,’ she retorted, ‘have trodden it down.’ What was the incident with the little boy? Once R. Joshua was on a journey and came across a little boy sitting at a cross-road. He asked him, ‘My son, by which road will I be able to go to the town, by this one or by that?’ He replied, ‘Both of them are before you; but this one is long and short and that one is short and long’. [He proceeded along the short but long road.] When he approached the city’s wall, he found that it was surrounded by gardens and orchards, and turned back. Noticing the same little boy sitting where he had left him, he said, ‘My son, why did you play a trick on me? Did you not tell me that this road was short?’<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) So GRA.</i> ‘Master,’ he retorted, ‘you are a great Sage and this is your wisdom? Did I not tell you that it is long?’<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) The last words are inserted by GRA.</i> R.

A man should not begin to eat leek or onion from the top side but from the leaves, and if he did eat it so he is a glutton and a tippler.

He should also not drink from a cup and hand it to his fellow because of danger to life.<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) The man may be fastidious and yet be forced to drink from it. It is permitted only after he had poured out some water from the cup to cleanse the rim; cf. Tamid 27b (Sonc. ed., p. 9).</i>
Once R. ‘Aḳiba was staying at the inn of a certain man who handed him a goblet of wine from which he had already drunk. R. ‘Aḳiba said to him, ‘Take and drink it’. [The host] again handed him another goblet of wine from which he had previously drunk, and R. ‘Aḳiba said to him, ‘Take and drink it’. Ben ‘Azzai said to him, ‘How long will you give [R. ‘Aḳiba] goblets of wine which had previously been tasted!’"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah.9.3,"It is also related of R. ‘Aḳiba that he was staying at the inn of a certain man [57<i>b</i>] who took a piece of bread and used it to support his plate.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) Displaying disrespect for food.</i> R. ‘Aḳiba snatched [the bread] and ate it. [The innkeeper] said to him, ‘Master, have you no bread to eat other than that on which I rested the plate?’ He replied, ‘I imagined that you would be scalded with tepid water;<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) i.e. I gave you a plain hint that this must not be done.</i> but now<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) Because of the question.</i> [I see] that you are not scalded even with hot water’.
A man should not drink his goblet and place it upon the table; but he should retain it until the waiter comes and then hand it to him.<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) He may stain the tablecloth.</i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah.10.1,"Rabbi [Judah the Prince] said the following five things [concerning bread]: we may not place raw meat on bread,<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) So as not to spoil it; this is the reason in all the cases mentioned.</i> we may not pass a cup [full of wine] or a plate [of soup] over bread, we may not throw bread, we may not rest a dish on bread and we may not sit on articles of food because it would crush them.<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) It is disrespectful even if he does not make it repugnant. H reverses the order of the paragraphs.</i>
A guest may not take his portion and give it to the attendant, lest something untoward happen to [the rest of] the meal;<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) And the guest will have had nothing to eat.</i> but he should take [his portion], keep it in front of him and later hand it to the attendant.
Guests may not give anything [from what is set before them] to the host’s son or to his servant or deputy unless they have received the host’s permission to do so. It once happened that in a time of scarcity a man invited three guests to his house and only had three eggs<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) Some read ‘food of the size of three eggs’.</i> which he set before them. When the host’s child entered and stood before them, one of the guests took his portion and gave it to him; the second guest did the same and so did the third. When the father came in and saw him with one egg in his mouth and holding two in his hands, he picked him up to his full height and flung him to the ground so that he died. When the mother saw her child dead she got up from [her seat] upon the roof<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) The text in Ḥul. 94b (Sonc. ed., p. 529) states that she went up to the roof.</i> and threw herself down and died. On seeing this, the father also stood on the roof and threw himself down and died. R. Eliezer b. Jacob said: Because of this three souls perished."
Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah.10.2,"On entering a bath-house one should say, ‘May it be Thy will, O Lord my God, that Thou cause me to enter in peace and depart in peace, and that Thou cause me to return [to my house] in peace, and deliver me from this heat and its like in the future’.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) Cf. Ber. 60a (Sonc. ed., p. 376).</i>
How should he conduct himself<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) i.e. in what order should he undress himself.</i> before entering? He removes his shoes, then his hat, then his cloak, then his girdle, then his shirt and finally his underwear. When he finished washing and left [the bath] and is handed a towel, he should dry his head and then the rest of his body. When he is given the oil<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) This is a necessary part of one’s toilet in hot countries.</i> he should oil his head<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) Because it is ‘the king of all the limbs’, Shab. 61a (Sonc. ed., p. 286).</i> and then the rest of his body. He then puts on his underwear and his shirt, binds his girdle, dons his cloak, [puts his hat on] and finally his shoes. [If he has his son with him or his servant, they put on the shoes for him.]<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) To spare him the fatigue. The words within brackets are inserted by GRA and H.</i> He puts on the right [shoe] first and then the left, and when he removes them he takes the left off first and then the right.<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) The right half of the body being stronger, more honour must be shown to it. Removing the left first is likewise a mark of honour to the right because the right shoe remains longer on the foot.</i> It is the same in connection with the <i>tefillin:</i> he puts on that of the hand first and then that of the head,<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) Cf. Deut. 6, 8, where the hand is mentioned first.</i> and when he removes them he first takes off that of the head and then of the hand.<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) Cf.

Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah.10.3,"Who enters a bath-house should not knead<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) i.e. massage strongly.</i> or scrape<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) With a strigil to invigorate the circulation. Cf. Shab. 147a (Sonc. ed., p. 747) where this is forbidden only on the Sabbath. Perhaps here it is only forbidden in the presence of many but not in the inner room where few people congregate (so NY). Another reading is ‘or have his limbs broken’, by a very vigorous massage.</i> or urinate on the marble floor.<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) In the presence of others, but he must retire to a corner.</i> It once happened that they begged Rabban Gamaliel, who was weak, to urinate on the marble floor but he refused.<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) [The translation is conjectural and suggested by the context. As it stands the text is unintelligible, but <i>shemen</i>, ‘oil’, seems to indicate a corruption of <i>mashtin</i>, ‘to urinate’.]</i> Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel said: He who urinates on the marble floor is the companion of an ass, and he who eats in the street is like a dog; some say that he is unfit to give evidence.<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">(13) Lack of self-respect may lead to one testifying falsely.

In the case of a privy he who is inside must give way<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">(14) i.e. hurry himself.</i> to him who enters;<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">(15) Because to hold oneself back endangers health.</i> but in the case of a bath-house he who is about to enter must give way<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">(16) i.e. wait.</i> to him who is inside.<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">(17) He must wash himself completely with hot and then cold water before leaving the bath-house. Cf. DEZ VIII, p. 588.</i> One may not bring into the bath-house oil in a glass vessel because of danger.<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">(18) In case the glass breaks.</i> One may not spit in a bath-house because of danger.<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">(19) Someone may slip over it.</i> One may not spit anywhere in the presence of others."
Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah.10.4,"One may cite the rules appertaining to a privy in a privy and the rules appertaining to a bath-house in a bath-house.<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">(20) Cf. ‘A.Z. 44b (Sonc. ed., p. 221), ‘One may not discuss questions relating to Torah in a bath’.</i> One should not extend a greeting<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">(21) lit. ‘inquire [after one’s peace] and reply’.</i> in a place where people are undressed<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">(22) Cf. Shab. 10a (Sonc. ed., p. 36) where ‘peace’ is said to be one of God’s names.</i> but only in a place where the majority present are dressed.<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">(23) So GRA. i.e. not in the inner chamber of the bath-house but in the outer chamber.</i> If most of the persons present are dressed it is as though they are all dressed; if the majority are undressed it is as though they are all undressed.

Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah.10.5,"A man should not let his feet [dangle] in a bath-tub while he lies stretched out [naked], because it is immodest. A man should not say to his fellow in a bath-house, ‘Rub me in well with your hand’, and he who says so will not depart from there unscathed. R. Judah said: This only applies when there is little water,<sup>24</sup><i class=""footnote"">(24) When the rubbing may arouse unclean thoughts.</i> but when there is plenty of water it is all right. It is discreditable for a man to read [the <i>Shema‘</i>] twice<sup>25</sup><i class=""footnote"">(25) Cf. Ber. 33b (Sonc. ed., p. 210, n. 7) where this applies only where he says each word of the <i>Shema‘</i> twice. If he repeats the whole sentence he is to be silenced, because it may appear as if he addresses himself to two Powers, similar to the dualism of the Persians, a God of light and a God of darkness. NY suggests a reading ‘to wash himself twice’.</i> or to immerse [in a ritual bath] twice.<sup>26</sup><i class=""footnote"">(26) Because people may suspect that he associates too much with women, a ritual bath being required after a seminal emission.</i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah.11.1,"If a man covers himself in his cloak and stays in the room where they sweat he is as if he robbed the public.<sup>27</sup><i class=""footnote"">(27) He prevents another from using the bath.</i> He who washes himself in cold water and then sluices himself with lukewarm water is as if he robbed the public.<sup>28</sup><i class=""footnote"">(28) To wash oneself first in hot and then in cold water is beneficial to the body; to use up hot water after having already washed with cold is waste of water.</i> And if one did rob the public what should he do?<sup>29</sup><i class=""footnote"">(29) To make redress.</i> He should go and dig wells, ditches and grottoes, or repair highways and streets,<sup>30</sup><i class=""footnote"">(30) And so provide water for the general public among whom the aggrieved persons are to be found.</i> and then he will be forgiven."
