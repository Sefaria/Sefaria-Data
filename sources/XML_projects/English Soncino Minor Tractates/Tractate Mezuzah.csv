Version Notes,
"Tractate Mezuzah, Introduction.1","<small>THE NAME</small><br/><i>Mezuzah</i> means literally ‘a doorpost’, but it is the technical term given to the small scroll which is placed on the right-hand doorpost of a dwelling-house as described below."
"Tractate Mezuzah, Introduction.2",<small>ORIGIN AND ANTIQUITY</small>
"Tractate Mezuzah, Introduction.3","Deut. 6, 9, <i>And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house, and upon thy gates</i>, with its repetition in XI, 20, is the Scriptural origin of the commandment in general terms. Tradition supplies the practical interpretation in detail. As the tractate deals specifically with many, if not most of these details, it was given its title. Josephus (38-95 <small>C.E.</small>), in his <i>Antiquities</i> IV, viii, 13, speaks of the <i>mezuzah</i> as an old and firmly established institution."
"Tractate Mezuzah, Introduction.4",<small>THE SCROLL AND-ITS CASE</small>
"Tractate Mezuzah, Introduction.5","Two passages of Scripture are written on the <i>mezuzah</i> scroll: Deut. 6, 4-9 and <i>ibid.</i> XI, 13-21. The scroll is a rectangular piece of parchment made of skin from a ritually clean animal and the script is Hebrew."
"Tractate Mezuzah, Introduction.6","On the upper third of the rolled-up scroll the divine name <i>Shaddai</i> (Almighty) is inscribed; and in accordance with a cabbalistic direction three words, representing ‘the Lord, our God, the Lord’, are written at the bottom of the back of the scroll. It is enclosed in a tube or oblong case of wood, metal or any other suitable material. An opening is usually made in it to allow the name <i>Shaddai</i> to be seen, and to protect the writing without concealing the divine name the opening is covered with a transparent material. Some <i>mezuzah</i> cases are artistically carved and beautifully ornamented (see the illustrations in J.E. VIII, pp. 531ff.). It is customary to touch and kiss the <i>mezuzah</i> on entering and leaving the room."
"Tractate Mezuzah, Introduction.7",<small>ROOMS LIABLE TO THE <i>MEZUZAH</i></small>
"Tractate Mezuzah, Introduction.8","Maimonides, summarizing the traditional rules on the conditions required to make a room or building liable to the obligation of a <i>mezuzah</i>, lays down the following requirements: It must have an area of four cubits square; two doorposts; a lintel; a ceiling and doors. The doorway must be a minimum of ten handbreadths in height; the room must be for ordinary and not sacred purposes; it must be used for human habitation; it must not be used as a privy or bath-room; and it must be a permanent and not temporary structure."
"Tractate Mezuzah, Introduction.9",<small>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PRECEPT</small>
"Tractate Mezuzah, Introduction.10","‘They (the Jews) are also to inscribe the principal blessings from God upon their doors, that God’s readiness to bless them may appear everywhere conspicuous about them.’ So wrote Josephus in the passage referred to above. ‘It is incumbent on every Jew,’ declared Maimonides, ‘to be most scrupulous in the observance of the commandment of <i>mezuzah</i>, so that whenever he enters or leaves the room he meets the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, and is reminded of His love and unity. Thus he will be awakened from his slumber, errors and vanities. He will be driven to the realization that nothing endures for ever except the knowledge of the Rock of the universe. This contemplation will inevitably bring him back to self-realization and plant him in the paths of the upright.’"
"Tractate Mezuzah, Introduction.11",<small>CONTENTS OF THE TRACTATE</small>
"Tractate Mezuzah, Introduction.12","Chapter I discusses the materials on which a <i>mezuzah</i> should or should not, be written; the marginal spaces to be left around the written text; and where perforation causes no disqualification of the scroll. It forbids the alteration of the shape of the letters and the use of obsolete Hebrew. A list of types of buildings and other structures and doorways that are exempt from the <i>mezuzah</i> concludes the chapter."
"Tractate Mezuzah, Introduction.13","The second chapter lays down that the <i>mezuzah</i> is to be placed on the right-hand doorpost, and defines which of the two doorposts is to be so regarded, drawing a distinction between different types of houses and various other structures. It deals also with the exact position on the doorpost to which the <i>mezuzah</i> is to be affixed, limits the distance between the entrance and the <i>mezuzah</i>, and indicates the manner of affixing."
"Tractate Mezuzah, Introduction.14","Regulations are given on the time allowed to elapse before a <i>mezuzah</i> must be affixed. A distinction is drawn between a tenancy in the Land of Israel and outside it, and between a house rented from a Jew and one rented from a Gentile. The chapter concludes with limiting the period within which a <i>mezuzah</i> and certain other ritual objects must be re-examined in order that their condition and suitability for their continued use may be verified."

"Tractate Mezuzah, Introduction.16",I. W. SLOTKI.
Tractate Mezuzah.1.1,"It is not permitted to write <i>mezuzoth</i> on the skins of ritually unclean cattle or on skins of ritually unclean wild animals. It is permitted, however, to write them on skins of <i>nebeloth</i> and <i>ṭerefoth</i>, and there is no need to consider the possibility of their having been pierced at the animal’s heart.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) There was a heathen practice to remove the heart from an animal while it was still alive and offer it as a sacrifice. Rabbinic law regards such an animal as an idolatrous offering (cf. Mishnah ‘A.Z. 29b, Sonc. ed., p. 145) and forbids its entire use, including the skin.</i>"
Tractate Mezuzah.1.2,"It is required to leave [a space of] one line on every side [of the text of the <i>mezuzah</i>], according to R. Simeon b. Eleazar."
Tractate Mezuzah.1.3,"If a hole was made in the place of the script it is unfit for religious use; but if it occurred in the margin it remains fit.
If the letter <i>waw</i> [in a <i>mezuzah</i>] was shaped like a <i>zayin</i> or <i>vice versa</i>, curved letters like straight-lined letters<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) e.g. an ordinary <i>kaf</i> like the final <i>kaf.</i></i> or <i>vice versa</i>, open letters closed<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) An ordinary <i>mem</i> like the final <i>mem.</i></i> or <i>vice versa</i>, or if the shape of its letters had been altered [in any other way], or if it was written in [obsolete] Hebrew, it is unfit for religious use."
Tractate Mezuzah.1.4,"A magazine for straw, a wood-shed [and any] storage room are exempt [from the <i>mezuzah</i>].<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) Only dwelling-houses are subject to the obligation.</i> A stable for cattle is exempt, but if women make use of it<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) In which to adorn themselves; but if they use any of the structures for bathing it is exempt (cf. Yoma 11a, Sonc. ed., p. 48; Y.D. CCLXXXVI, §2).</i> it is liable. Cone-shaped huts,<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) [Used by watchers in a field or by hunters; Krauss, <i>Talmudische Archäologie</i>, I, p. 6.]</i> travellers’ stations, field sheds<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) [Krauss, <i>Lehnwörter</i>, p. 226, and <i>Talm. Arch.</i> I, p. 276, n. 81, reads <i>hilaḳṭiyoth</i>. Maimonides understood the term to mean ‘summer-house’, thatched on top and open on the four sides. More probably it was used for stacking hay, etc., where it was dried by the wind.]</i> and tanneries are exempt from <i>mezuzah</i>.<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) They are not dwelling-houses.</i>"
Tractate Mezuzah.1.5,"A bath-house is exempt, but if a dwelling-house adjoins it the outer doorway is liable."
Tractate Mezuzah.1.6,"A corner doorway that has only one doorpost, [or] a doorway made in [a structure of] boards which has only one doorpost is liable. R. Eliezer b. Jacob declares it exempt."
Tractate Mezuzah.1.7,"Arched doorways are exempt, but R. Meir and R. Judah declare that they are liable. All, however, agree that if they have the [usual] structure below<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) Being four handbreadths wide and reaching to a height of ten handbreadths (cf. ‘Erub, 11b, Sonc. ed., p. 69).</i> and the arched section above they are liable to <i>mezuzah</i>."
Tractate Mezuzah.2.1,"City gates, the gates of open places<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) Where people assemble for special prayers or to discuss public matters.</i> and the gates of Temple Courts are exempt.<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) [But according to Yoma 11a, Sonc. ed., p. 47, city gates require a <i>mezuzah</i>.]</i> [The doorways of] chambers in the Temple were exempt from <i>mezuzah</i>, but the Chamber of the Counsellors,<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) Reading <i>lishkath parhedrin</i>, one of the Temple chambers, in agreement with Yoma 10a (Sonc. ed., p. 45). V and H read: <i>lishkath shel beth happarwah</i>, ‘the chamber of the Parwah house’, Parwah being the name of its Persian builder (cf. <i>ibid.</i> 35a, Sonc. ed., p. 161, n. 6).</i> which served as a residence for the High Priest on seven days in the year,<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">(13) Before the Day of Atonement (cf. <i>ibid.</i> 2a, Sonc. ed., p. 1).</i> and potters’ booths are subject to <i>mezuzah</i>. R. Jose declares them exempt."
Tractate Mezuzah.2.2,"The <i>mezuzah</i> is placed<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) lit. ‘written’.</i> on the right-hand side of the entrance from the street into the lodge, and [on the right-hand side of] the exit from the courtyard into the lodge.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) It refers to where the lodge is in front of a courtyard and has two doorways, one facing the street and the other facing the courtyard.</i>"
Tractate Mezuzah.2.3,"If a garden has a doorpost where it adjoins the courtyard, the <i>mezuzah</i> is placed [on the right-hand side of] the exit from the garden into the courtyard; and if a lodge is attached to it,<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) Between the garden and the courtyard, with doorways leading to each of them.</i> <i>mezuzoth</i> are to be placed on both doorways [of the lodge]."
Tractate Mezuzah.2.4,"Where small rooms open into a reception room,<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) Access to which is gained only through the small ones.</i> the <i>mezuzah</i> is placed on that doorway which is customarily used.<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) So according to H. V’s reading is corrupt.</i> If they are all customarily used, <i>mezuzoth</i> are placed on all the doorways."
Tractate Mezuzah.2.5,"If a number of rooms have doorways leading from one room to the other,<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) lit. ‘rooms within one another’.</i> <i>mezuzoth</i> are placed at the entrance of each one of them. R. Judah says: If the ladder is movable on the four sides….<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) The sentence is obviously incomplete. H reads: ‘If the ladder is movable a <i>mezuzah</i> is placed at every side’; but this also does not convey much sense.</i>"
Tractate Mezuzah.2.6,"If a doorway leads from a roof [into a room], the <i>mezuzah</i> is placed [on the right-hand side of] the entrance from the roof. R. Nathan b. R. Jose said: In such a case Beth Shammai hold that the doorway is subject to <i>mezuzah</i> and Beth Hillel hold that it is exempt."
Tractate Mezuzah.2.7,"In a booth that is set back<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) lit. ‘within’.</i> from [the edge of] a roof the <i>mezuzah</i> is to be placed [on the right-hand side of] the exit from the booth to the roof. R. Jose says: [On the right-hand side of the entrance] from the roof to the booth."
Tractate Mezuzah.2.8,"In the case of a portico that is set back from the rooms and has no other exit,<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) Except through one of the rooms.</i> the <i>mezuzah</i> is placed [on the right-hand side of] the exit from the portico into the rooms. R. Jose says: [On the right-hand side of] the entrance from the rooms to the portico."
Tractate Mezuzah.2.9,"If an entrance serves as two doorways and a wall [of not more than] one handbreath in width [separates them], only one <i>mezuzah</i> is to be affixed, according to R. Judah. [If the wall was] wider than that two <i>mezuzoth</i> are required."
Tractate Mezuzah.2.10,"The <i>mezuzah</i> is placed in the upper half of the doorpost;<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) lit. ‘from the half and above’. Another reading is: ‘on the upper third’; cf. the ruling in the name of Samuel in Men. 33a (Sonc. ed., p. 208).</i> so R. Meir. R. Judah says: [It should be placed] below the handbreadth [from the top of the doorpost] and above one handbreadth [from the bottom]."
Tractate Mezuzah.2.11,"If one made a groove in the wall at a distance of [not more than] one handbreadth [from the doorpost], and placed [the <i>mezuzah</i>] in it, the <i>mezuzah</i> is valid. [If the distance] was greater than that it is invalid.
If one made a groove in a stick and put the <i>mezuzah</i> in it, it is invalid. If one inserted [the <i>mezuzah</i>] in a tube and hung it up behind the door [or] behind the doorpost,<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) Hanging the stick on the doorpost.</i> R. Meir declared it valid, but R. Judah declared it invalid."
Tractate Mezuzah.2.12,A new house is subject to the obligation of <i>mezuzah</i> as soon as it is completed.
Tractate Mezuzah.2.13,"One who lodges in an inn in the Land of Israel for thirty days is subject to the obligation of <i>mezuzah</i>, and if one rents [a house] he must affix [a <i>mezuzah</i>] forthwith. Outside the Land of Israel, [one who lives in an inn] is exempt, and one who rents [a house] must affix [a <i>mezuzah</i>] after thirty days."
Tractate Mezuzah.2.14,"[A Jew] who rents a house from a Gentile or from a Samaritan must affix a <i>mezuzah</i> forthwith, and when he quits he must remove it; but if one rents a house from an Israelite, he affixes the <i>mezuzah</i> forthwith and when he quits he must not remove it."
Tractate Mezuzah.2.15,"One who buys a house from a Gentile or a Samaritan is under the obligation of putting a <i>mezuzah</i>, but [if he bought it] from an Israelite it is presumed [to have been provided with the necessary <i>mezuzoth</i>]."

Tractate Mezuzah.6,"If one buys a brick-mould from a Gentile, he should not heat it before he had examined it.
[The scroll in] the <italic>mezuzah</italic> should be examined once in twenty-five years, according to R. Simeon. R. Jacob says: A much longer time [may be allowed to intervene]. Both, however, agree that if it was transferred from one place to another it requires examination.
In like manner, water-tanks<sup><xref rid=""fn2322"">12</xref></sup> in a public domain must be examined once in seven years, but those situated in a private domain once in twenty-five years, according to R. Meir; but the Sages say: In either case the general rule is that wherever there is a top cover<sup><xref rid=""fn2323"">13</xref></sup> the examination takes place once in seven years, and where there is no top cover the examination takes place once in twenty-five years.
