Version Notes,
"Tractate Avadim, Introduction.1","<small>JUDAISM AND SLAVERY</small><br/>[Although civilized man today thinks of the institution of slavery with horror, it seems to have originated in a humanitarian motive based on utilitarianism. It was a moral advance on the practice of the victor putting the vanquished to death. Indeed the Latin word <i>servus</i> has been derived from <i>servare</i>, 'to preserve', as denoting a person who was not given over to general slaughter (cf. W. E. H. Lecky, <i>History of European Morals</i>, 1911, I, p. 102 n.)."
"Tractate Avadim, Introduction.2","In the economy of the ancient world slavery was indispensable, and Israel was no exception to the peoples who adopted it. But in this connection Israel was exceptional at least in one respect. Among the Romans and Greeks, e.g., the treatment of slaves varied in different periods. Not always was the master allowed to exercise power of life and death over them. Moralists arose who protested vehemently against the cruelties from which they suffered; but generally the lot of the slave was degraded in the extreme and his existence embittered."
"Tractate Avadim, Introduction.3","With the people of Israel, on the other hand, the slave was never a mere chattel at the mercy of his master's whims, and the legislation which affected him uniformly treated him as a human being. It is true that the Hebrew who sold himself for a term of servitude from straitened circumstances or was sold to earn the money wherewith to refund a theft, bore a stigma. The heathen slave, likewise, belonged to an inferior class. Nevertheless the Hebrew term which described them both, <i>'ebed</i>, was far from being derogatory. On the contrary, it was a dignified term since the Patriarchs, Moses, kings and prophets were designated ' <i>'ebed</i> of God' and the phrase was applied to the whole community of Israel. It must be remembered that all the essential services of social life were regarded by the Israelites as honourable, and they who performed them were invested with a degree of dignity."
"Tractate Avadim, Introduction.4","A consequence of this was that the slave in an Israelite household was not the exact counterpart of the slave in a heathen household. On the subject in general, cf. J.E. XI, pp. 403-408, G. F. Moore, <i>Judaism</i>, II, pp. 135-138, A. Cohen, <i>Everyman's Talmud</i>, 1949, pp. 198-203, L. Baeck, <i>The Essence of Judaism</i>, 1936, pp. 203-207."
"Tractate Avadim, Introduction.5","The last-mentioned authority remarks: 'In the Greek and Roman world, to say nothing of the old eastern states ruled by despots, the slave was considered to be a <i>thing</i>; he was not a subject of the law, but merely an object of the law. In the <i>corpus juris</i> he belonged to the chapter devoted to the law of things. To the Israelite law the slave is a person entitled to rights, one who stands before his master with definite legal claims. The master is therefore not considered to be the owner of the slave, but only his possessor. He has not a full and unlimited freedom of dealing with him, but merely a restricted and conditional power of disposal over him. It is thus established that serfdom is not a relationship which has its foundations in the general order of law, incorporating acknowledged rights, but that it is merely a temporary form of domestic service. Thus the principle of slavery is thereby destroyed' (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 205). He concludes his discussion of the subject with the statement: 'Slavery, in the real sense of the word, did not exist among the Jews. Israel was the only community to possess a civilization which did not rest upon the shoulders of slaves, and thus created for the first time a truly ethical civilization' (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 207).]"

"Tractate Avadim, Introduction.7","[Since the legislation of the Torah deals with the status and rights of slaves, and in Rabbinic times some Jews possessed them, the subject is included in the discussions of the Talmud. Whether the compilation which forms this tractate was made early or late can hardly be determined with certainty."
"Tractate Avadim, Introduction.8","If the passage which is found in the Kirchheim MS. (cf. III, 4, n. 8) but omitted in the printed editions is authentic, it would be evidence in favour of an early date because it displays an intimate knowledge of the Roman forms of manumission which would have been more familiar to the Jews then than in the Geonic period. On the other hand, I. H. Weiss, <i>Dor Dor weDoreshaw</i>, 1904, II, p. 224, adduces an instance where the tractate presents an amalgam of two early Baraithoth in the <i>Mekilta</i> which is clearly the work of a later hand. There is the possibility that the original collection of material was made in the earlier Rabbinic era and in its extant form was edited in the Geonic period.]"
"Tractate Avadim, Introduction.9",<small>CONTENTS OF THE TRACTATE</small>
"Tractate Avadim, Introduction.10","The first chapter deals mainly with the various circumstances in which a Hebrew bondman, and more particularly a Hebrew bondwoman, obtains his or her release. It also contains a brief digression on the Jubilee."
"Tractate Avadim, Introduction.11","Chapter II deals first with the treatment due to a Hebrew bondman from his Jewish master and the 'parting gifts' which have to be presented to him at the end of his period of service. It then describes the method of his redemption from a non-Jewish master, and the conditions under which an Israelite may be sold for theft."
"Tractate Avadim, Introduction.12","The first half of chapter III specifies which Jewish bondmen may continue in service after their period of six years, and describes the ceremony of boring through the ear of such a one. The second half lays down the rules for the acquisition and liberation of a Canaanite (i.e. heathen) slave."
"Tractate Avadim, Introduction.13",[In V the text of each chapter is continuous. In the present translation it has been divided into paragraphs and numbered in agreement with Higger's edition.]
"Tractate Avadim, Introduction.14",M. SIMON.
Tractate Avadim.1.1,"[The regulations regarding] a Hebrew slave<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) An Israelite, according to the Rabbis, could become a slave either through being sold by the <i>Beth Din</i> to make restitution for a theft or through selling himself for a livelihood.</i> and a slave whose ear is bored [<i>nirza'</i>]<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) Because he refused to go free after six years' service (Ex. XXI, 5f.; Deut. XV, 16f.).</i> are in force only when the Jubilee [is in force].<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) This apparently means, so long as the years from one Jubilee to the next are being officially counted, as laid down in Lev. XXV, 8.</i>"
Tractate Avadim.1.2,"[The regulations regarding] a field of possession<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) Cf. <i>ibid.</i> XXVII, 16-21. A 'field of possession' is one that has been inherited as distinct from a 'field of purchase'.</i> and a field which had been devoted [to the Temple]<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) Cf. <i>ibid.</i> 28f.</i> are in force only when the Jubilee [is in force]. R. Ishmael said: For that reason it is stated, <i>As a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's</i><sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) <i>ibid.</i> 21.</i>—as possession [depends] on the Jubilee, so a field which had been devoted [depends] on the Jubilee.<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) A field of possession which had been dedicated by the owner, then sold by the priests and not redeemed before the Jubilee. Such a field at the Jubilee became the property of the priest. Cf. Rashi on <i>ibid.</i> 16.</i> The Jubilee is on the same footing as the New Year in regard to the blowing [of the <i>shofar</i>],<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) Cf. <i>ibid.</i> XXV, 9.</i> and the benedictions,<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) [Nine blessings have to be said over the <i>shofar</i> as on the New Year; R.H. 26b (Sonc. ed., p. 120, n. 2).]</i> except that [the blowing of] the <i>shofar</i> on the Jubilee overrides the Sabbath.<sup>9a</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9<i>a</i>) [The <i>shofar</i> is not blown on the day of the New Year which falls on the Sabbath.]</i> When did the Jubilees cease [to be observed]? From the time when Pul and Tiglath-pileser, kings of Assyria, came up and carried the Reubenites, the Gaddites and half the tribe of Manasseh into captivity.<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) Cf. 2 Kings XV, 19, 29.</i>"
Tractate Avadim.1.3,"<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) This paragraph is quoted from Mishnah Ḳid. I, 2 (Sonc. ed., p. 59).</i> A Hebrew slave is acquired by money purchase or by document, and he acquires his freedom by years of service,<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) Cf. Ex. XXI, 2; Deut. XV, 12.</i> through the advent of the Jubilee<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">(13) Cf. Lev. XXV, 40f.</i> and by deduction of money.<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">(14) i.e. by repaying his master his purchase price less the value of the service he has completed.</i> The Hebrew handmaid has an advantage over him in that she acquires her freedom by the signs [of puberty]. The <i>nirza'</i> is acquired by the boring [of his ear] and acquires his freedom through [the advent of] the Jubilee or through the death of his master."
Tractate Avadim.1.4,"If a man writes a document of divorce for his handmaid,<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">(15) Instead of giving her a deed of manumission. According to the Gemara, Giṭ. 85b (Sonc. ed., p. 412), there was no difference of opinion on this point.</i> R. Hanina b. Gamaliel says that she does not become free, but the Sages say that she does become free. If he said to her,<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">(16) Without giving her a document.</i> 'Behold, you are free', the Sages say that she does not become free."
Tractate Avadim.1.5,"[4. If one who is about to die says, 'My slave So-and-so is free', then he is free. If he wrote a deed of manumission for him, 'Behold this [slave] is free', the latter should have concern.]<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">(17) [Whether he is free. This paragraph is omitted in V and MS.K. but added in H.]</i>"
Tractate Avadim.1.6,"A man may sell his daughter from one servitude to another,<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">(18) i.e. he may sell her a second time if the first master dies or releases her.</i> and from one matrimony to another and from servitude to matrimony, but not from matrimony to servitude. [R. Simeon said: He may not sell her from one servitude to another, much less from matrimony to servitude.]<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">(19) The words in brackets are not in V and are introduced from MS.K.</i>"
Tractate Avadim.1.7,"If a man sells his daughter on condition of her not being betrothed by the master, his sale is valid but his condition is void, because he made a condition overriding what is written in the Torah,<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">(20) Which declares, <i>If she please not her master who hath espoused her to himself</i> (Ex. XXI, 8). The Rabbis took this to mean that he bought her for the purpose of espousing her.</i> and whoever makes a condition which overrides a prescription of the Torah [does something which] is void."
Tractate Avadim.1.8,"If the father wants to betroth her and the son wants to betroth her, the father takes precedence. If the son wants to betroth her and the father to redeem her, the son takes precedence, because the precept of betrothing takes precedence over the precept of redeeming, as it is stated, <i>Who hath espoused her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed</i>.<sup>20a</sup><i class=""footnote"">(20a) Ex. XXI, 8.</i> Two must not be betrothed together.<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">(21) A master cannot be betrothed to two maidservants simultaneously.</i>"
Tractate Avadim.1.9,"A brother<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">(22) Of the master of the maidservant.</i> must not betroth her. [This had to be mentioned] because it might have been argued: Seeing that the son who does not take the place of his father to act as levir may betroth her, does it not stand to reason that one who takes the place of his brother to act as levir should betroth her! Hence [the Torah] states, <i>And if he espouse her unto his son</i>,<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">(23) Ex. XXI, 9.</i> thus excluding the brother."
Tractate Avadim.1.10,"If he betrothed her at the end of the [six] years [of bondage], should she still be in his possession<sup>24</sup><i class=""footnote"">(24) i.e. if there is still time for her to do work for him to the value of a <i>peruṭah</i>.</i> she is betrothed, according to the view of R. Simeon b. Eleazar, and if not she is not betrothed. The Sages, however, say that as long as she is in his possession<sup>25</sup><i class=""footnote"">(25) Until the setting of the sun.</i> she is betrothed, since that was the condition on which he paid the money [for her] at the beginning.<sup>26</sup><i class=""footnote"">(26) viz. that the purchase money should also serve as the money of betrothal.</i>"
Tractate Avadim.1.11,"If a man sells his daughter and then went and betrothed her to another, he made game of the master<sup>27</sup><i class=""footnote"">(27) And the betrothal to the second is valid; cf. Ḳid. 19b (Sonc. ed., p. 88).</i> according to R. Jose b. Judah; but the Sages say that he has done nothing.<sup>28</sup><i class=""footnote"">(28) The second betrothal is invalid.</i>"
Tractate Avadim.2.1,"A Hebrew slave does work by day but not by night. R. Jose said: It all depends on his occupation. All agree that [the master] should not teach him to be a dyer, a butcher, or a baker for the public.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) But he can serve him privately in these capacities. MS.K. and H add 'or a money-changer to the public'.</i> He should not carry him to the privy or carry his clothes before him to the bath-house or gird his loins for him,<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) [H understands the phrase to mean 'support his master in walking'.]</i> massage or anoint him."
Tractate Avadim.2.2,"He eats the same food and drinks the same drink [as his master]; he sits at meals with him<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) MS.K. and H add 'and sleeps facing him'.</i> even if his stomach is full.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) lit. 'heavy', i.e. he is not hungry. This is the reading of MS.K. and H. V has 'even if he is idle'.</i> If he is beaten or falls ill, [the master] does not reckon the time of his idleness,<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) i.e. he deducts the time the slave did not work from the period of service.</i> but if [the slave] runs away and returns, he does reckon the time when he was not working."
Tractate Avadim.2.3,"[An Israelite] may not sell himself in order to obtain clothing or bedding, but he may sell himself to maintain himself alive."
Tractate Avadim.2.4,"When [the slave] has completed his term of years, he must not be sent away empty-handed, as it is written, <i>And when thou lettest him go free from thee, thou shalt not let him go empty; thou shalt furnish him liberally</i>.<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) Deut. XV, 13f.</i> R. Eleazar b. Azariah says: If the house is blessed on his account he is furnished liberally, but otherwise not. R. 'Aḳiba says: In either case [the master] should not give him less than fifty <i>zuz</i>. We give him as parting gifts anything except slaves, documents and immovable property.<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) i.e. things that do not grow from the soil, because Scripture ordained, <i>Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy threshing-floor and out of thy wine-press</i> (Deut. XV, 14).</i> Both a man and woman [owner is under the obligation to give parting gifts] but only a man can acquire a Hebrew slave while a woman cannot acquire a [male] Hebrew slave."
Tractate Avadim.2.5,"Two slaves should not be bought together, [so that a public sale should not be made with two slaves].<sup>7a</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7a) The words in brackets are added by MS.K. The term <i>ṭumaria</i>, translated 'public sale', is obscure but it seems to indicate that too much publicity attaches to the sale of two slaves at once. [Krauss, <i>Lehnwörter</i> reads either <span dir=""rtl"">טימיתא</span>, 'price' (p. 264) or <span dir=""rtl"">טימוס</span>, 'tax' (p. 263).]</i>"
Tractate Avadim.2.6,"One who sells himself, one who runs away and one who gains his liberty by deduction of money does not receive parting gifts."
Tractate Avadim.2.7,"He who is sold for committing a theft should not be sold either in the market-place or in a bazaar, as it is stated, <i>For unto Me the children of Israel are servants</i>.<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) Lev. XXV, 55. They must be treated as human beings and not as chattels.</i>"
Tractate Avadim.2.8,"If [an Israelite] sells himself to Gentiles, his relatives and the <i>Beth Din</i> are commanded to redeem him, but he is not commanded to redeem himself, as it is stated, <i>One of his brethren shall redeem him; or his uncle or his uncle's son shall redeem him</i>.<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) <i>ibid.</i> 48f. E.V. <i>may redeem</i>. To make sense of this passage we must read 'he is [also] commanded to redeem himself' instead of 'but he is not commanded to redeem himself'. R. Ishmael learns this by <i>a fortiori</i> reasoning and uses the verse <i>or if he be waxen rich</i>, etc., from which it might be learnt that he need not sell himself again in order to repay those who have redeemed him.</i> For R. Ishmael used to say: Seeing that others are commanded to redeem him must he not be commanded to redeem himself? [And if you ask] what do I make of the words, <i>Or if he be waxen rich, he shall redeem himself?</i><sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) <i>ibid.</i></i> [The meaning is,] that just as if he redeems himself he does not return to servitude, so if others redeem him he does not return to servitude.<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) In order to repay them.</i> R. Jose the Galilean said: If the <i>Beth Din</i> [sell him he returns] to servitude,<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) To refund the money.</i> but if relatives [redeem him it is] for his freedom; while R. ' Aḳiba said: If the <i>Beth Din</i> [redeem him it is] for his freedom but if relatives [redeem him he returns] to servitude."
Tractate Avadim.2.9,"If he stole two hundred [<i>zuz</i>] and his valuation<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">(13) As a slave.</i> is only a <i>maneh</i>,<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">(14) A hundred <i>zuz</i>.</i> he is sold and sold again.<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">(15) Each time for his valuation of one hundred <i>zuz</i>. [The correct reading is probably 'not sold again', cf. Ḳid. 18a (Sonc. ed., p. 82, n. 3.)]</i> If he stole a <i>maneh</i> and his valuation is two hundred <i>zuz</i> he is not to be sold.<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">(16) Since half of him cannot be sold (Ḳid. <i>loc. cit.</i>).</i> R. Eliezer said: In no case should he be sold unless his sale price and the amount of his theft are equal. He cannot be sold and sold again for the same theft and he returns [after his servitude] to the rank which he formerly held. This is the view of R. Meir; but R. Judah said: He does not return to the rank which he formerly held.<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">(17) [Cf. the discussion in Mak. 13a (Sonc. ed., p. 89). H has a different version of this paragraph: 'If one has stolen a <i>maneh</i> and his valuation is a <i>maneh</i>, or [if he stole] two hundred [<i>zuz</i>] and his valuation is two hundred [<i>zuz</i>], he may be sold; but [if he stole] two hundred [<i>zuz</i>] and his valuation is a <i>maneh</i> he may not be sold. R. Eliezer said: He is not sold unless his sale price and his theft are equal. [If he stole] a hundred [<i>zuz</i>] and his valuation is two hundred [<i>zuz</i>], he may not be sold. He may not be sold and resold for another theft or for repayment of double (cf. Ex. XXII, 3, 6, 8) or repayment of fourfold and fivefold (cf. <i>ibid.</i> XXI, 37). [After his servitude] he returns to the rank', etc.]</i>"
Tractate Avadim.3.1,"The <i>nirza'</i> should not have his ear pierced until he declares and repeats [his desire to remain in servitude], as it is stated, <i>But if the servant shall plainly say</i>.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) Ex. XXI, 5. The Heb. is lit. 'saying shall say', i.e. say and say again.</i> If the slave has a wife and children but the master has no wife and children, or if the master has a wife and children and the slave has no wife and children, he should not have his ear pierced. That is the view of R. Ishmael; R. 'Aḳiba said: In either case he should have his ear pierced."
Tractate Avadim.3.2,"Anything may be used for the piercing, even a scissors,<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) Another reading is 'nail'.</i> but [the proper instrument for] the command to pierce is an awl, as it is stated, <i>And his master shall bore his ear through with an awl</i>.<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) <i>ibid.</i> 6.</i> He should only be pierced at the top of the ear according to R. Meir; but R. Judah said: He can be pierced also on the flap. He should be pierced only in the right ear in the presence of the <i>Beth Din</i>, as it is stated, <i>Then his master shall bring him unto the</i> Elohim.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) <i>ibid. Elohim</i> is understood as 'judges'.</i> Both <i>door</i> and <i>doorpost</i> are mentioned [in the verse]; why are they both mentioned? It is to compare the door to the doorpost: as the doorpost is upright, so the door must be upright."
Tractate Avadim.3.3,"A Canaanite slave<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) Any heathen slave was called 'Canaanite' with reference to Gen. IX, 25.</i> is acquired by money payment, by written deed or by seizure, and he acquires his liberty with money which is paid [to his master] by others or with a written document which he receives [from him]. Such is the opinion of R. Meir; but the Sages said: [He acquires liberty] with money which he himself pays or with a deed received for him by others, provided only that the money belongs to others.<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) Because everything possessed by a Canaanite slave belongs, to his master.</i>"
Tractate Avadim.3.4,"He goes free for loss of a limb<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) Cf. Ex. XXI, 26f.</i>—for an eye or a tooth, for the tips of the ears, for the tips of the fingers and toes, for the tip of the nose, for the tip of the membrum and for the tips of the breasts in a woman. R. Simeon said: [The last-mentioned applies also] to a man."
Tractate Avadim.3.5,"If [the master] knocks out two of his teeth together, or blinds his two eyes together, he goes free but receives no compensation; if they were knocked out at different times, he gains his liberty for the first and receives monetary compensation for the second. If [the master] cut off some of his flesh or knocked out a tooth which was about to fall out, he does not go free.<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) Because the flesh would grow again and a slave was liberated only for losses which would not grow again like an ordinary tooth or an eye. MS.K. inserts the sentence: '[A slave] can be emancipated by an <span dir=""rtl"">אנטוקטא</span> or a board or a tablet, but not by a headgear [presented by] kings'. [This addition is a variant of what occurs in Giṭ. 20a (Sonc. ed., p. 77). See there n. 6. Krauss (<i>Lenhwörter</i> I, pp. 267f., and his <i>Talmudische Archäologie</i> II, p. 99) gives a detailed discussion of the reading in MS.K. and quotes the view that it enumerates the Roman methods of manumission and the terms correspond to the Latin <i>manumissio per vindictam, per censum, per tabulas</i> and <i>manumissio in praesentia regis</i>.]</i>"
Tractate Avadim.3.6,"A slave of whom an Israelite is part-owner<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) While the other half is free.</i> is [reckoned as] a free man.<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) i.e. his master must liberate him.</i>"
Tractate Avadim.3.7,"If one sells his slave after thirty days,<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) This is meaningless. Kirchheim emends, in accordance with B.Ḳ. 90a (Sonc. ed., p. 519): 'If one sells his slave to another with the stipulation that he should still serve him for thirty days, R. Meir says', etc.</i> R. Meir says that [the first owner has the benefit of the law of] <i>a day or two</i>,<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) The law that if an owner strikes his slave and he survives a day or two days the owner is not punished.</i> but not the second. [R. Judah says: The second also has the benefit.]<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">(13) The sentence in brackets is added in MS.K</i> R. Eliezer said: Neither has the benefit of <i>a day or two</i>."
Tractate Avadim.3.8,"Whoever sells his slave to a Gentile or [to an Israelite] outside the Land [of Israel], or one who goes free for the loss of a limb, [the slave] does not require a deed of manumission. R. 'Aḳiba says that he does require a deed of manumission."
