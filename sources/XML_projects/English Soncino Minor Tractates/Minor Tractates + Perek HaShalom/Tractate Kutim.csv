Version Notes,
"Tractate Kutim, Introduction.1","<small>THE SAMARITANS</small><br/>The people named in the Bible <i>Kuthim</i> are the descendants—actual or supposed—of the immigrants who were settled by Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, in the region of Samaria when he drove the Northern Kingdom into exile and who adopted the way of life of the Israelites (cf. 2 Kings XVII, 24ff.). After the Jews returned from Babylon, the question arose in an acute form whether the <i>Kuthim</i> should be regarded as members of the community in view of their claim to share in rebuilding the Temple. [For a critical inquiry into the origins of this people, cf. J. A. Montgomery, <i>The Samaritans</i>, 1907, and for an account of them cf. J.E. X, pp. 669-681.]"

"Tractate Kutim, Introduction.3","Not until the third century <small>C.E.</small> was the decision finally taken to treat the Samaritans as Gentiles although they had adopted many Jewish rites. Inasmuch as this tractate evidently presupposes that the question was still open, it must have been compiled in its original form before then. This view seems to be confirmed by the favourable attitude which the tractate generally adopts towards them; but there are traces of later additions in accordance with the change in the relationship between the two communities."
"Tractate Kutim, Introduction.4","[Much of the material contained in the tractate is culled from Talmudic sources. The conclusion of Montgomery is: 'Most of the independent <i>halakoth</i> are favourable to them, and so may be presumed to be discarded Baraithoth. On the other hand, the <i>halakoth</i> which have been bodily applied to the Samaritans from the law concerning the Gentiles, testify to the later practical identification of the two classes' (<i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 196f.).]"
"Tractate Kutim, Introduction.5",<small>CONTENTS OF THE TRACTATE</small>
"Tractate Kutim, Introduction.6","It begins by laying down the principle that while in most respects Samaritans are on the same footing as Jews, in some they are on the same footing as heathens; and it proceeds to give a number of rules for regulating Jewish intercourse with them. These rules relate to the Temple Service, to the right to gleanings, etc., to the observance of tithe and <i>'erub</i>, to social and business relationship with them and to their reliability as witnesses."
"Tractate Kutim, Introduction.7","Chapter II deals chiefly with the permissibility of various Samaritan foods, such as meat and cheese, and with the status of Samaritan priests; also with the position of Samaritans in the matter of legal penalties and damages. It concludes with explaining why they have been forbidden to intermarry with the Israelites and how they may one day obtain acceptance into the fold."
"Tractate Kutim, Introduction.8",[In the Talmud editions the text of the chapters is continuous. It has here been divided into paragraphs and numbered in agreement with Higger's edition.]
"Tractate Kutim, Introduction.9",M. SIMON.
Tractate Kutim.1.1,"The Samaritans in some of their ways resemble the Gentiles and in some resemble Israel, but in the majority they resemble Israel."
Tractate Kutim.1.2,"We do not accept from them for offering [in the Temple] sacrificial birds brought by males with a flux,<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) Lev. XV, 14.</i> or sacrificial birds brought by females with a flux,<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) <i>ibid.</i> 29.</i> or sacrificial birds brought by women after childbirth,<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) <i>ibid.</i> XII, 6, 8.</i> or sin-offerings or trespass-offerings, but we receive from them vows and free-will-offerings.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) The words 'vows and free-will offerings' have dropped out of the printed text and MS.K., but are added by H in agreement with Shek. I, 5 (Sonc. ed., p. 3).</i>"
Tractate Kutim.1.3,"We do not transfer to them anything attached to the soil,<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) Lest they should transfer it to Gentiles to whom such ownership is forbidden. [In 'A.Z. 20b (Sonc. ed., p. 107) this rule is stated in connection with Gentiles. As with several other rulings which follow it was subsequently applied to Samaritans.]</i> or sell to them sheep to shear, or crops to reap<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) The correct reading is probably 'unripe produce (for cattle food) to clip'.</i> or trees attached to the soil,<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) The words 'to be cut down' should certainly be inserted.</i> but we sell them animals to slaughter."
Tractate Kutim.1.4,"We do not sell them large cattle even if they are mutilated, or foals or calves;<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) [From the fear that the owner will not allow them to rest on the Sabbath; cf. 'A.Z. 15a (Sonc. ed., p. 75).]</i> but we may sell them a mutilated animal which can never recover.<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) [Because it will not be put to work and so the fear, previously stated, does not apply.]</i>"
Tractate Kutim.1.5,We do not sell them weapons of war or anything which can cause injury to the public.
Tractate Kutim.1.6,"We do not give to them [Israelite women] in marriage or take wives from them,<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) [For the reason, cf. below II, 7, n. 13.]</i> but we lend to them and borrow from them on interest.<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) [Either the text should be emended to 'and we do not lend to them', etc., or the clause is a later insertion at the time of the final repudiation of the Samaritans. Cf. Kirchheim <i>ad loc.</i></i>"
Tractate Kutim.1.7,"We give them gleanings, forgotten sheaves and the corner of the field;<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) Cf. <i>Gerim</i> I, 3, n. 7.</i> they too observe [gleanings], forgotten sheaves and the corner of the field,<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">(13) And therefore no tithe need be given for them.</i> and their word can be taken in regard to gleanings, forgotten sheaves and the corner of the field in their season and in regard to the tithe of the poor in its year.<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">(14) The tithe of produce was given to the poor in the third and sixth year of the seven-year cycle.</i> Their produce is reckoned as <i>ṭebel</i><sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">(15) i.e. produce from which the heave-offering and tithe have not been separated.</i> like the produce of Gentiles, and they make the <i>'erub</i> ineffective like Gentiles.<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">(16) Cf. 'Erub. 61b (Sonc. ed., p. 433, n. 1).</i>"
Tractate Kutim.1.8,"An Israelite woman should not act as midwife to a Samaritan woman or suckle her child;<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">(17) [Based on Mishnah 'A.Z. II, 2 (Sonc. ed., p. 129) where it speaks of 'a heathen woman' and the reason given is 'because she would be delivering a child to idolatry'. Since the Tosiftha 'A.Z. III permits it in the case of a Samaritan, the text here is probably a later adaptation and] originally read 'may act as midwife … and suckle'.</i> but a Samaritan woman can act as midwife to an Israelite woman and suckle her child on her premises."
Tractate Kutim.1.9,"An Israelite may circumcise a Samaritan and a Samaritan can circumcise an Israelite. R. Judah said: A Samaritan may not circumcise an Israelite because he only circumcises him in the name of Mount Gerizim.<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">(18) The mountain sacred to the Samaritans as the Temple Mount in Jerusalem was to the Jews. [The phrase 'seems to mean simply, ""with the intention of attaching the person to the community of Gerizim"" ' (Montgomery, <i>The Samaritans</i>, pp. 170f.).]</i>"
Tractate Kutim.1.10,"We may stall an animal in the inn of a Samaritan, and [an Israelite] may hire a Samaritan to follow his beast. He may also entrust his cattle to a Samaritan shepherd,<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">(19) [Because a Samaritan is not suspected of perverted practices with an animal. Cf. 'A.Z. 15b (Sonc. ed., p. 78).]</i> and he may entrust his son to a Samaritan to teach him a trade.<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">(20) [We do not fear that he will influence the boy against Judaism.]</i> We may associate with them and converse<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">(21) The correct reading according to Kirchheim is <span dir=""rtl"">מסתפרין</span>, 'may have the hair cut by them', instead of <span dir=""rtl"">מספרין</span> [in agreement with Mishnah 'A.Z. II, 3 (Sonc. ed., p. 135).</i> with them in any place, which is not so with Gentiles.<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">(22) Who are suspected of murderous intent.</i>"
Tractate Kutim.1.11,"He performs <i>ḥalizah</i> for his sister-in-law and gives a <i>geṭ</i> to his wife, and a Samaritan may be relied on to bring a <i>geṭ</i><sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">(23) i.e. his word is taken that he witnessed the signing and sealing of the <i>geṭ</i>.</i> from foreign countries to Israel."
Tractate Kutim.1.12,"These are the things which we do not sell them: animals which died of themselves or have been improperly slaughtered, animals forbidden [to an Israelite] as food,<sup>24</sup><i class=""footnote"">(24) Lest they should sell them to Israelites as fit for consumption.</i> reptiles,<sup>25</sup><i class=""footnote"">(25) Lest they should mix them with things sold to Israelites.</i> a shoe made from the skin of an animal which died of itself,<sup>26</sup><i class=""footnote"">(26) Cf. Hul. 94a (Sonc. ed., p. 528, n. 4): 'The animal may have died through the bite of a serpent and the hide of the animal may thereby have become contaminated'. Rashi <i>ad loc.</i> explains that the leather of an animal which died of itself is inferior to that of a healthy animal, and to sell shoes from this leather is false pretences.</i> oil into which a mouse has fallen,<sup>27</sup><i class=""footnote"">(27) [The oil would thereby become unclean, and in this matter the Samaritans were scrupulous.]</i> or [the flesh of] a <i>koskos</i><sup>28</sup><i class=""footnote"">(28) 'A <span dir=""rtl"">בוס בוס</span>' is added by MS.K. and H. It is the term for an animal which has been hurriedly slaughtered because otherwise it would soon have died naturally.</i> or of an embryo. Although Israelites eat a <i>koskos</i> and an embryo we do not sell them to the Samaritans, because such a sale would be under false pretences. And just as we do not sell these to them so we do not buy these from them, as it is stated <i>For thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God</i><sup>29</sup><i class=""footnote"">(29) Deut. XIV, 21.</i>—since thou art holy, thou must not make another people holier than thyself.<sup>30</sup><i class=""footnote"">(30) 'Since thou art holy', etc., is omitted in V. [Kirchheim explains that the underlying principle is that which is laid down in Pes. 50b-51a (Sonc. ed., p. 247): 'Things which are permitted, yet others treat them as forbidden, you may not permit it in their presence'. It is there expressly applied to Samaritans.]</i>"
Tractate Kutim.1.13,"A Samaritan may be trusted if he says that he has buried [a miscarriage] or not buried it,<sup>31</sup><i class=""footnote"">(31) [Cf. Nid. 56b (Sonc. ed., p. 397). If the foetus was buried in a room, any person entering it would be rendered ritually unclean.]</i> and, with regard to an animal, that it has brought forth its first-born<sup>32</sup><i class=""footnote"">(32) [Then the subsequent birth would not come under the law of the firstling, which was a priestly due.]</i> or not brought forth. A Samaritan may be trusted with regard to the plantation of the fourth year and uncircumcised fruit<sup>33</sup><i class=""footnote"">(33) Cf. Lev. XIX, 23f.</i> and grave-signs,<sup>34</sup><i class=""footnote"">(34) If he says that there is no grave in a place which is not marked.</i> but not with regard to overhanging boughs, protruding stones,<sup>35</sup><i class=""footnote"">(35) Which form a 'tent' for communicating ritual defilement. [Cf. Nid. Sonc. ed., p. 399, n. 2.]</i> land of the peoples,<sup>36</sup><i class=""footnote"">(36) [i.e. countries outside the Holy Land in matters which concern ritual purity.]</i> or a <i>beth peras</i>,<sup>37</sup><i class=""footnote"">(37) [Cf. Jast. p. 1233.]</i> because they are suspected [of carelessness] in these matters. The general principle is that in regard to matters in which they are suspected [of carelessness] they are not trusted."
Tractate Kutim.2.1,"We do not buy meat from a Samaritan butcher except that of which he is prepared himself to eat, nor [do we buy from him] baskets of birds unless he first puts them in his mouth.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) [Hul. 4a (Sonc. ed., p. 10) reads: '[The Israelite] cuts off the head of one of the birds and gives it to the Samaritan; if he ate it, then we may eat of his slaughtering'.]</i> He must not give them to an Israelite to eat, since the Samaritans have from of old been suspected of giving Israelites carrion to eat."
Tractate Kutim.2.2,"The Samaritan is on the same footing as an Israelite in regard to all damages mentioned in the Torah. Whether an Israelite kills a Samaritan or a Samaritan kills an Israelite, if he did it by inadvertence he goes into exile [to a City of Refuge], if wilfully he is put to death. If the ox of an Israelite gored the ox of a Samaritan he is exempt from damages;<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) i.e. if it was not known to have a tendency to be a gorer.</i> but should the ox of a Samaritan have gored the ox of an Israelite, if the ox is <i>tam</i> he pays half the damage and if it is <i>mu'ad</i><sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) <span dir=""rtl"">תם</span> (innocuous) denotes an ox which had not previously gored, <i>mu'ad</i> (warned) one which had done so and the owner had been warned.</i> he pays the whole damage. R. Meir said: If an ox of a Samaritan gores the ox of an Israelite, whether it is <i>tam</i> or <i>mu'ad</i> the owner pays the whole damage and pays from his best possessions.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) [Cf. B.Ḳ. 38b (Sonc. ed., p. 217).]</i>"
Tractate Kutim.2.3,"Their cheeses are permitted. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: Those of private persons are permitted, but those of wholesalers<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) H reads 'those of the villages'. [The reason is that these cheeses are made for sale, and the makers are not particular to enclose them in skins of ritually clean animals.]</i> are forbidden. Their cooked and preserved vegetables, into which they usually put wine or vinegar,<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) [Cf. <i>Gerim</i> I, 9, n. 18.]</i> are forbidden."
Tractate Kutim.2.4,"Israelite priests<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) About the time of Alexander the Great, the Samaritans built a temple on Mount Gerizim and a number of priests from Jerusalem, including a High Priest, went and ministered there. They were disowned by the Judeans.</i> share with Samaritan priests in the latters' districts because they, as it were, rescue [the produce] from their hands, but not in Israelite districts lest [Jews appear to] confirm their priesthood. If a Samaritan priest offers from what he is eating to an Israelite, should [the priest] be unclean it is permissible, but if clean it is forbidden.<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) The Samaritan priest, if unclean, would not eat <i>terumah</i>, and therefore the Israelite may eat what he was eating.</i>"
Tractate Kutim.2.5,"We do not buy [bread] from a Samaritan baker on the outgoing of Passover until after three bakings [have been made], or from private persons until three weeks have passed, or from the villages until after three bakings.<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) H reads 'makings' which has the same meaning as 'bakings'. [As the continuation indicates, the ruling was made because the Samaritan Passover did not always coincide exactly with the Jewish Festival. Cf. Kirchheim <i>ad loc.</i>]</i> When does this apply? When they have not prepared their unleavened bread together with Israelites or they observed Passover one day earlier; but if they baked their unleavened bread together with Israelites or observed Passover one day later, their leaven is permitted. R. Simeon forbids it because they do not know how to observe the law of unleavened bread like the Israelites."
Tractate Kutim.2.6,"At first they said: The wine of Gedor is forbidden on account of the wine of Kfar Paggasha.<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) For Gedor there is a variant 'Kador' and for Paggasha (the text in V is corrupt) 'Pansha'. Apparently Gedor was a Samaritan village and Kfar Paggasha a heathen village near by with whose inhabitants the Samaritans freely mingled. Hence the doubt about the wine.</i> Later they revised this rule and said: Wherever [Samaritans] are suspected because of their mingling with Gentiles, if [their wine is] in an open [vessel] it is forbidden,<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) Because some of it may have been used in heathen worship.</i> and if in a closed [vessel] it is permitted. R. Meir said: All their wine is permitted except that which is in open [vessels for sale] in the markets; but the Sages said: In an open [vessel] it is everywhere forbidden and in a closed [vessel] permitted, while [a vessel] which has been pierced and then sealed is like one which is sealed. Their jars when new are permitted but when old are forbidden.<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) [Cf. 'A.Z. 29b (Sonc. ed., p. 146); another instance of a law relating to Gentiles which was later applied to Samaritans. An old jar may have contained the wine of a heathen.]</i>"
Tractate Kutim.2.7,"Why are Samaritans forbidden to enter the Jewish community? Because they have become mixed up with the priests of the high places. R. Ishmael said: They were originally genuine proselytes. Why, then, are they forbidden? Because of the illegitimate females<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">(13) [Since they are a mixed people, they include females who may not have been born to Israelite mothers and in turn their offspring are non-Israelite since their status in this respect depends upon that of the mother.]</i> and because they do not perform the levirate duty to a married woman.<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">(14) But perform <i>ḥalizah</i> instead. Cf. I, 11.</i> When may they be received into the Jewish community? When they have renounced Mount Gerizim and acknowledged Jerusalem and the resurrection of the dead.<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">(15) [That the Samaritans denied the doctrine of resurrection is recorded in Sanh. 90b (Sonc. ed., p. 606, n. 1).]</i> From then onwards one who robs a Samaritan is like one who robs an Israelite.
