Version Notes,
"Tractate Semachot, Introduction.1","<i>Semaḥoth</i> (lit. 'Joys') is a euphemistic term for the older name of the tractate, <i>'Ebel Rabbathi</i> (lit. 'Great Mourning'). A tractate of this name is cited in the Talmud, M.Ḳ. 24a, 26b (Sonc. ed., pp. 148, 172) and Keth. 28a (Sonc. ed., p. 153), but is not completely identical with the present work."
"Tractate Semachot, Introduction.2","The original <i>Semaḥoth</i> consisted of a collection of <i>Baraithoth</i> dealing with the laws of mourning for the dead prescribed by Judaism, compiled in Palestine by R. Eliezer b. Ẓadoḳ (first cent. <small>C.E.</small>). Later it was amplified and embellished by R. Hiyya, a Babylonian of the second century. It took its present form probably in the middle of the eighth century."
"Tractate Semachot, Introduction.3","The tractate consists of fourteen chapters and, in addition to the laws of mourning, includes much aggadic material and several stories, e.g. the death of the Ten Martyrs (ch. VIII) and the son of R. Hanina b. Teradion (ch. XII). It opens with an aggadic passage of a less gloomy character, the compiler apparently feeling it desirable to begin on a brighter note."
"Tractate Semachot, Introduction.4","<i>Semaḥoth</i> prescribes the regulations to be observed during the closing hours of a person's life, from the time he is dying until after the burial, and the ceremonial mourning to be kept by his nearest kin during the seven and the thirty days which follow. The tractate may therefore be described as 'The Mourner's Manual'."
"Tractate Semachot, Introduction.5","I venture the suggestion that, because mourners were forbidden to study the Torah during the seven days of strict mourning, the tractate with its aggadic embellishments served as a suitable text for reading and meditation."
"Tractate Semachot, Introduction.6",I have to acknowledge my indebtedness to M. Higger's invaluable edition of <i>Semaḥoth</i> which was of great help in the preparation of this work.

"Tractate Semachot, Proem.1","<i>And it came to pass at midnight, that the Lord smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt</i>,<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) Ex. XII, 29.</i> etc.; and it is written, <i>For all the first-born among the children of Israel are Mine, both men and beast; on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them for Myself</i>.<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) Num. VIII, 17.</i> R. Joḥanan said: Although He smote them with the plague of death at midnight, the souls writhed within them until morning. A common proverb says, 'If you give a morsel of bread to a child, inform his mother'.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) Cf. Bezah 16a (Sonc. ed., p. 81) where it is quoted, not as a proverb, but as a saying of Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel.</i> Likewise, the Holy One, blessed be He, said, 'I will inform My children of the death by choking<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) GRA's emendation of a verb in the text meaning 'which silences'.</i> of which their enemies are dying. Let their souls await the morning [before expiring], so that My children shall look upon [the fate of] their enemies'."
Tractate Semachot.1.1,"<small>RULE 1</small>. A dying man<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) Heb. <i>gosēs</i>, the term applied when the rattle in the throat indicates that a person is at the point of death.</i> is regarded as a living entity in respect of all matters in the world: he holds [his brother's wife] tied to the leviratical marriage,<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) Cf. Deut. XXV, 5ff. Should the brother die while he himself is dying, the former's widow is precluded from marrying until she is released by the latter from his obligation to wed her (cf. Ohol. I, 6, Sonc. ed., pp. 151f).</i> he frees [his mother] from the obligation of a leviratical marriage<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) If his father died and left no other children, his mother is free to remarry because the dying man is regarded as living. Even a child who survives one day frees his mother from the levirate. Cf. Nid. 43b (Sonc. ed., p. 303).</i> and enables her to eat <i>terumah</i>,<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) If his mother is the daughter of a lay-Israelite married to a <i>kohen</i>, she may continue to eat <i>terumah</i> so long as he remains at the point of death.</i> and he [may also] disqualify her from eating <i>terumah;</i><sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) If she is the daughter of a <i>kohen</i> married to a lay-Israelite, she may not eat of the <i>terumah</i> belonging to her father which, on the death of her husband, she is permitted to eat when she returns to his home (cf. Lev. XXII, 12f). The reason is that, since her son is regarded as living, it would be contrary to the stipulation in Lev. <i>and have no child</i>.</i> he inherits and transmits;<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) i.e. an estate. On inheritance and transmission, cf. B.B. 108a (Sonc. ed., p. 448).</i> if one of his limbs is severed, it is regarded as a limb cut off from the living;<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) There is a legal difference if it is a limb severed from a living or dead body. If it was from a dead body, a piece of flesh from it, even the size of an olive, communicates defilement; but if from a living body it does not. Therefore, if one of the dying man's limbs is severed, flesh from it does not defile because he is considered a living being.</i> if [part of his] flesh [is severed], it is regarded as flesh cut off from the living;<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) Flesh not necessarily from a severed limb.</i> and the blood of his sin-offering and guilt-offering is sprinkled for him until the time he dies.<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) Where a man who brought a sin- or guilt-offering died before it was sacrificed, the animal for the former had to be killed and the latter turned into the fields to graze until it died naturally. But with a dying man who brought an offering, the ritual connected with his sacrifice was carried out completely.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.1.2,"<small>RULE 2</small>. We do not tie up his cheek-bones,<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) To prevent the jaw from dropping; cf. Shab. 151a (Sonc. ed., p. 771).</i> or stop up his apertures,<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) To prevent air from entering.</i> or place a metal vessel or anything which chills on his navel;<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) Shab. <i>loc. cit.</i> reads 'on his stomach', that it should not swell.</i> as it is stated, <i>Before the silver cord is snapped asunder and the golden bowl is shattered, and the pitcher is broken at the fountain.</i><sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">(13) Eccl. XII, 6. None of these acts may be done because they hasten death.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.1.3,"<small>RULE 3</small>. We may not move him, or place him on sand or salt<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">(14) For 'salt' GRA reads 'a vessel that chills'; cf. Tosiftha Shab. XVIII, 18.</i> until he dies.<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">(15) So that the body should keep cool and not swell.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.1.4,"<small>RULE 4</small>. We may not close the eyes<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">(16) Shab. <i>loc. cit.</i> (Sonc. ed., p. 772). Closing the eyes of a corpse is a very ancient practice. According to Ibn Ezra the custom is alluded to in Gen. XLVI, 4, <i>and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes</i> (cf. his commentary <i>ad loc</i>.). The custom was current among the ancient Greeks and Romans and is practised by the Egyptians [cf. Seyffert, <i>Dictionary of Classical Antiquities</i>, p. 101b, and Lane, <i>Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians</i>, ch. XXVIII]. A man, at the moment of death, was believed to behold the Divine Presence (cf. Job XIX, 27) and therefore it was unfitting that after that vision his eyes should look at anything mundane. Cf. A. Bender in <i>Jewish Quarterly Review</i>, VII (1895), pp. 102f.</i> of a dying man. Whoever touches and moves him is a murderer. For R. Meir used to say: He can be compared to a lamp which is dripping;<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">(17) Shab. <i>loc cit.</i> reads 'a lamp that is going out'.</i> should a man touch it he extinguishes it. Similarly whoever closes the eyes of a dying man is considered as if he had taken his life."
Tractate Semachot.1.5,"<small>RULE 5</small>. We do not rend the garments or bare the shoulder,<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">(18) Cf. Rashi to M.Ḳ. 22b (Sonc. ed., p. 140). R. Meir of Rothenberg explains the word <i>ḥolezin</i> in the usual sense of 'removing the shoes'.</i> or deliver a memorial address, or bring the coffin into the house until he dies.<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">(19) These things should be avoided so as not to frighten the dying person.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.1.6,"<small>RULE 6</small>. We do not summon the people<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">(20) Cf. 1 Sam. XV, 4, XXIII, 8 for this usage of the Heb. verb. Brüll adds the word <i>'ayaroth</i> (cf. Sanh. 47a, Sonc. ed., p. 311), 'We do not summon the people of the townships'.</i> or recount his good deeds. R. Judah said: If he is a scholar we recount his good deeds.<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">(21) Because he is accustomed to have his praises sung and it would not distress him in the circumstances.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.1.7,"<small>RULE 7</small>.<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">(22) This Rule is not connected with the preceding, but speaks of a case where there is a dead person in the town.</i> In the town people do not greet each other.<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">(23) Because all must share in the mourning, and greeting is not permitted to a mourner.</i> This applies only in a village,<sup>24</sup><i class=""footnote"">(24) Where all learn quickly of the death.</i> but in a large city it is permissible."
Tractate Semachot.1.8,"<small>RULE 8</small>. We do not carry out the mourning rites for one who came out [at birth] by pieces or with feet foremost, or for one born prematurely<sup>25</sup><i class=""footnote"">(25) Heb. <i>nefel</i>, a child who dies within thirty days of birth.</i> at eight months<sup>26</sup><i class=""footnote"">(26) And cannot therefore survive.</i> alive or at nine months dead."
Tractate Semachot.1.9,"<small>RULE 9</small>. For a non-Jew or a slave we do not occupy ourselves with his funeral rites, but we exclaim of him, 'Alas lion!<sup>27</sup><i class=""footnote"">(27) So H; V repeats 'lion'.</i> alas mighty man!'. R. Judah said: [We, for instance, exclaim], 'Alas, Ṭabi!<sup>28</sup><i class=""footnote"">(28) The faithful slave of Rabban Gamaliel (cf. Ber. 16b, Sonc. ed. p. 96).</i> alas, faithful man who ate<sup>29</sup><i class=""footnote"">(29) In Ber. 'who worked for his living'.</i> of his labour!'. They said to him,<sup>30</sup><i class=""footnote"">(30) To R. Jose who, in Ber. (Sonc. ed., p. 97), suggested the praise to be made over a faithful slave.</i> '[If so], what have you left [to be said] of worthy men [who are not slaves]?' He replied, 'If he was worthy, why should we not say it of him, since<sup>31</sup><i class=""footnote"">(31) So H; V lacks 'since'.</i> we do not receive condolence for [the loss of] male or female slaves?'"
Tractate Semachot.1.10,"<small>RULE 10</small>. It is related that when R. Eliezer's female slave died, his disciples came to comfort him. He entered the courtyard [to avoid them], but they followed him; he went into the house, but they followed him. He said to them, 'I imagined that you would be scalded with tepid water, but now you are not even scalded with hot water.<sup>32</sup><i class=""footnote"">(32) The meaning is, I made it clear to you that I did not want to receive your condolence; cf. Ber. <i>loc. cit.</i></i> Have [the Sages] not said: <sup>33</sup><i class=""footnote"">(33) In Ber., 'Have I not taught you', etc.</i>We do not receive condolence for slaves because they are reckoned as animals?'<sup>34</sup><i class=""footnote"">(34) The text in Ber. reads: What do we say over them? As we say to a man on the death of his ox or ass, 'May the Omnipresent repair thy loss', so we say to a man on the death of his slaves, 'May the Omnipresent repair thy loss'.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.1.11,"<small>RULE 11</small>. And when Ṭabi the slave of Rabban Gamaliel died, he received condolence for him. They asked him, 'Master, have you not taught us that we do not receive condolence for slaves?' He replied, 'My slave Ṭabi was unlike all other slaves; he was a worthy man'."
Tractate Semachot.1.12,"<small>RULE 12</small>. He also permitted Ṭabi to put on the <i>tefillin</i>. They said to him, 'Master, have you not taught us that slaves are exempt from [the precept of] <i>tefillin?</i>' He replied, 'My slave Ṭabi was unlike all other slaves; he was a worthy man'."
Tractate Semachot.1.13,"<small>RULE 13</small>. We do not call male and female slaves 'Father So-and-so, Mother So-and-so'. Those of the house of Rabban Gamaliel, however, were called 'Father Ṭabi' and 'Mother Ṭabitha'.<sup>35</sup><i class=""footnote"">(35) Quoted from Ber. <i>loc. cit.</i> [The female slave Ṭabitha is mentioned in j.Nid. I, 4, 49b.]</i>"
Tractate Semachot.1.14,"<small>RULE 14</small>. We confine the term 'our father' to the three Patriarchs,<sup>36</sup><i class=""footnote"">(36) Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</i> and the term 'our mother' to the four Matriarchs.<sup>37</sup><i class=""footnote"">(37) Sara, Rebekah, Rachel and Leah. This Rule is also culled, in a slightly different form from Ber. <i>loc. cit.</i></i>"
Tractate Semachot.2.1,"<small>RULE 1</small>. We do not occupy ourselves in any respect with the funeral rites of one who committed suicide wilfully. R. Ishmael said: We exclaim over him, 'Alas for a lost<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) Heb. <i>niṭṭelah</i>, '[a life] carried away'. H reads <i>nishlah</i> with a similar meaning (cf. <i>God takth away</i> [<i>yeshel</i>] <i>his soul</i>, Job XXVII, 8). GRA emends to <i>nithlah</i>, 'hanged'.</i> [life!] Alas for a [lost] life!' R. 'Aḳiba said to him, 'Leave him unmourned; speak neither well nor ill of him'.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) lit. 'do not bless him and do not curse him'.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.2.2,"We do not rend garments for him,<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) According to the <i>Ṭur</i> Y.D., §345, near relatives do not rend their garments.</i> bare the shoulder, or deliver a memorial address over him. We do, however, stand in a row<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) At the cemetery after the funeral those present divide themselves into two rows and the mourners pass between them to receive condolences.</i> for him and recite the benediction of mourners<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) The condolence ended with the words, 'Blessed be He Who comforteth the mourners' (Keth. 8b, Sonc. ed., p. 40). Hence the term 'benediction of mourners'; cf. J. Rabbinowitz, <i>Mishnah Megillah</i>, p. 119.</i> for him, from respect of the living [relatives]. The general rule is: With anything that makes for respect of the living we occupy ourselves, but with anything that does not make for the respect of the living, the public do not in any way occupy themselves."
Tractate Semachot.2.3,"<small>RULE 2</small>. Who [comes within the category of] 'one who committed suicide wilfully'? He does not who climbed to the top of a tree and fell down and died, or he who went up to the top of the roof and fell down and died.<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) It may have been an accidental fall.</i> But he who calls out, 'Look, I am going to the top of the roof or to the top of the tree, and I will throw myself down that I may die' [comes within the category]. When people saw him go up to the top of a tree or roof [for the purpose] and he fell down and died, he is presumed to have committed suicide wilfully; and with the person who commits suicide wilfully we do not occupy ourselves in any respect."
Tractate Semachot.2.4,"<small>RULE 3</small>. If a person was found strangled or hanging from a tree or lying dead on a sword, he is presumed not to have committed suicide wilfully, and none [of the rites] are withheld from him."
Tractate Semachot.2.5,"<small>RULE 4</small>. It is related of the son of Gorgias<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) A variant is Gornos. [He is not mentioned elsewhere in Rabbinic literature.]</i> of Lydda that he ran away from school and his father pointed to his ear.<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) i.e. he threatened to punish him.</i> In fear of his father he went and destroyed himself in a pit.<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) So GRA and H. V wrongly 'with a garment'.</i> They went and inquired of R. Ṭarfon who ruled: We do not withhold anything from him.<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) He is buried with full rites.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.2.6,"<small>RULE 5</small>. It is related of a child in Benë Beraḳ<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) A town near Jaffa.</i> that he broke a bottle on the Sabbath and his father pointed to his ear. In fear of his father he went and destroyed himself in a pit. They inquired of R. 'Aḳiba who ruled: We do not withhold anything from him."
Tractate Semachot.2.7,"<small>RULE 6</small>. Hence the Sages ruled: A man should not point at the ear of a child, but either punish him immediately or keep silent and say nothing to him."
Tractate Semachot.2.8,"R. Simeon b. Eleazar said:<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) Sanh. 107b (Sonc. ed., p. 736), Soṭah 47a (Sonc. ed., p. 246).</i> With human nature,<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">(13) Heb. <i>Yezer</i>, which means human instinct; cf. Lazarus, <i>Ethics of Judaism</i>, II, pp. 106f.</i> a child and a woman, the left hand should repulse them but the right hand bring them back.<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">(14) One should not be too severe with them, not suppressing their desires but disciplining them.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.2.9,"<small>RULE 7</small>. With those executed by a Court we do not occupy ourselves in any respect. Their brothers and relatives come and greet the witnesses and judges<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">(15) Cf. Sanh. 46a (Sonc. ed., p. 305).</i> [as if to say], 'We have no [ill feelings] against you in our hearts because you gave a true judgment'. They observe no [public] mourning<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">(16) i.e. the seven days, thirty days and the twelve months.</i> for them but grieve, since grief is felt only in the heart."
Tractate Semachot.2.10,"<small>RULE 8</small>. R. Nathan said: There is no difference between silence and mourning.<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">(17) i.e. the silence of the mourners is itself a form of mourning. Hence the persons mentioned in the previous Rule must not even grieve. It is suggested that R. Nathan's statement was originally a marginal note which found its way into the text.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.2.11,"<small>RULE 9</small>. The 'meal of comfort'<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">(18) The first meal partaken by the mourners on their return from the funeral is termed 'the meal of comfort [<i>habra'ah</i>]'; cf. 2 Sam. III, 35, <i>to cause David to eat bread</i> (<i>lehabroth</i>). It was prepared by friends and consisted of lentils and eggs (cf. Sanh. 63a, Sonc. ed., p. 430, n. 6) the round shape of which being a reminder of the revolving wheel of fortune.</i> is not eaten in their case, as it is stated, <i>Ye shall not eat</i> [anything] <i>with the blood</i>.<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">(19) Lev. XIX, 26. This is homiletically interpreted to mean: where blood is shed (i.e. an execution has taken place) no ceremonial meal of mourners should be eaten. Cf. Sanh. <i>loc. cit.</i></i>"
Tractate Semachot.2.12,"[The judges of] a Court who ordered the execution of a man used not to eat anything on that day.<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">(20) Sanh. <i>loc. cit.</i></i>"
Tractate Semachot.2.13,"[The condemned] are allowed to converse with their brothers and relatives; and not to delay matters<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">(21) i.e. to avoid giving the appearance that the execution of justice is unduly protracted.</i> they are given to drink wine containing frankincense<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">(22) To numb the senses; cf. Sanh. 43a (Sonc. ed., p. 279).</i> so that they should not feel grieved. They are urged<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">(23) lit. 'they teach them'.</i> to confess, because he who confesses has a portion in the World to Come. We find it so with Achan to whom Joshua said, <i>My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord, the God of Israel, and make confession unto Him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide nothing from me. And Achan answered Joshua, and said: Of a truth I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done</i>.<sup>24</sup><i class=""footnote"">(24) Josh. VII, 19f.</i> What is the meaning of <i>and thus and thus?</i> It teaches that he violated the ban twice.<sup>25</sup><i class=""footnote"">(25) By taking from the devoted things on two occasions. Sanh. 43b (Sonc. ed., p. 284) explains that he took of the ban three times, twice in the days of Moses and once at Jericho.</i> [44<i>b</i>] <i>I have sinned</i>, i.e. I and not my household, I and not my children. This teaches that he truthfully<sup>26</sup><i class=""footnote"">(26) <i>Of a truth ('omnam</i>) is explained as <i>be'emunah</i> ('truthfully').</i> confessed. And whence do we know that his confession made atonement for him? As it is stated, <i>And Joshua said: Why hast thou troubled us? The Lord shall trouble thee this day</i><sup>27</sup><i class=""footnote"">(27) <i>ibid</i>. 25.</i>—<i>this day</i> art thou to be troubled but thou shalt not be troubled in the World to Come; and it states, <i>And the sons of Zerah: Zimri, and Ethan, and Heman, and Calcol and Dara: five of them in all.</i><sup>28</sup><i class=""footnote"">(28) 1 Chron. II, 6.</i> Do we not know that there were <i>five of them in all?</i><sup>29</sup><i class=""footnote"">(29) Since five names are specified.</i> It teaches that Achan will be with them in the world to come.<sup>30</sup><i class=""footnote"">(30) Cf. Sanh. 44b (Sonc. ed., p. 291). Zimri, according to a tradition, is identical with Achan. As Achan is mentioned together with the other four, who are considered to be worthy men, it is an indication that his confession was accepted and with them he shared in the World to Come.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.2.14,"Similarly one who steals the tax<sup>31</sup><i class=""footnote"">(31) i.e. eludes the customs; cf. B.Ḳ. 113a (Sonc. ed., p. 663), Tosiftha B.Ḳ. X, 8.</i> or anything devoted [to the Sanctuary] is as if he shed blood; and not only is he as if he shed blood, but he is also as if he worships idols, was guilty of immorality and desecrates the Sabbath.<sup>32</sup><i class=""footnote"">(32) [On this passage, cf. Büchler, <i>Studies in Sin and Atonement</i>, p. 198n.]</i>"
Tractate Semachot.2.15,"<small>RULE 10</small>. We do not occupy ourselves with those who separated themselves from the community<sup>33</sup><i class=""footnote"">(33) According to Maimonides (<i>Hil. 'Ebel</i>, I, 5, cf. <i>Ṭur</i> Y.D., §345) the reference is to those who discarded all the religious precepts and ceremonies of Judaism.</i> in any respect. Their brothers and relatives clothe themselves in white, wrap themselves in white and eat and drink and rejoice because an enemy of the All-present perished; as it is stated, <i>Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate Thee? And do not I strive with those that rise up against Thee? I hate them with utmost hatred; I count them mine enemies</i>.<sup>34</sup><i class=""footnote"">(34) Ps. CXXXIX, 21f.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.2.16,"<small>RULE 11</small>. We do not withhold mourning rites from those executed by the Government.<sup>35</sup><i class=""footnote"">(35) i.e. the occupying power, viz. the Romans.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.2.17,"When do we begin to count [the days of mourning] for them?<sup>36</sup><i class=""footnote"">(36) Usually this begins from the moment the grave is filled in, but here the body of the victim was not handed over to the family for burial.</i> From the time that [the relatives] despaired in their appeal [for the body to be delivered to them for burial], but not [given up the hope] of stealing it. For he who steals is as if he shed blood, and not only is he as if he had shed blood, but also as if he worshipped idols, etc.<sup>37</sup><i class=""footnote"">(37) This sentence is repeated from the last clause of Rule 9 and has no relevance to the present context.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.2.18,"<small>RULE 12</small>. Mourning rites are not withheld in any respect from one who fell into the sea, or was washed away by a stream, or killed by a wild beast. When do we begin to count [the days of mourning] for such as these? From the time that hope of finding them has been given up. If they found a body limb by limb, we do not count [the days of mourning] until the head and greater part [of the torso] is found. R. Judah said: The spine and skull constitute the greater part [of the torso]."
Tractate Semachot.2.19,"<small>RULE 13</small>. If one's husband, wife, father or mother had been impaled<sup>38</sup><i class=""footnote"">(38) By the Roman authorities. Impaling was not a form of execution carried out by the Jews.</i> in his city, one should not continue to reside there<sup>39</sup><i class=""footnote"">(39) On seeing him, people will recall the impaling of his relative, and that would be a slight on the memory of the victim.</i> unless it is a city as big as Antioch.<sup>40</sup><i class=""footnote"">(40) The ancient capital of Syria. Since it is a large city, the fact might not be generally known.</i> [Even then] one should not reside in the same side of the city but in another part. Until when is one so forbidden? Until the flesh is completely decomposed and the identity<sup>41</sup><i class=""footnote"">(41) lit. 'the form'.</i> unrecognizable from the bones."
Tractate Semachot.2.20,"<small>RULE 14</small>. [Beth Shammai said:]<sup>42</sup><i class=""footnote"">(42) GRA omits. For what follows, cf. Keth. 27b, 28a (Sonc. ed., p. 152).</i> If a man divorced his wife, he should not live in the same alley or courtyard as she.<sup>43</sup><i class=""footnote"">(43) Lest he be tempted to cohabit with her.</i> If the alley belonged to both of them, he transfers the door [of his house] to another side; and if the courtyard belonged to both of them, one vacates it on account of the other, and the woman vacates it on account of the man. This rule only applies if she has remarried<sup>44</sup><i class=""footnote"">(44) So GRA; V 'they have married'. After remarriage with another she can never return to her first husband (cf. Deut.

It is related of a certain woman whose daughter was ill that she ascended the Temple Mount and went round it, and did not move from there until they came and told her, 'She is cured'."
Tractate Semachot.6.14,"To one who lost some object they say, 'May He Who dwells in this House put it into the heart of the finder to return it to you at once'. It is related of Eleazar b.

The Rabbis regarded this Festival as the complement of Passover in the same way that <i>Shemini 'Azereth</i> (cf. Num.

Tractate Semachot.7.2,"<small>RULE 2</small>.

R. Eliezer b. R.

Tractate Semachot.7.4,"<small>RULE 4</small>.

A mourner is regarded on a Festival as if he were no mourner, but in matters of a private nature he does observe mourning. The general rule is: as regards any [mourning rite] in the carrying out of which others are associated with him,<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">(16) e.g. consolation of the mourners.</i> a Festival is taken into account with the seven days,<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">(17) Hence when the burial took place during the Festival, people come to condole for four days only or not at all.</i> otherwise it is not taken into account with them."
Tractate Semachot.7.8,"<small>RULE 8</small>. Thirty are the days of mourning.<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">(18) All the points mentioned in this Rule are discussed in the continuation.</i> For thirty days he may not put on pressed clothes<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">(19) i.e. clothes ironed or pressed smooth of creases; cf.

If a man forbade his wife by vow to have any benefit from him [the prohibition lasts] thirty days. The vow of a Nazirite of unspecified duration [remains in force] for thirty days."
Tractate Semachot.7.9,"<small>RULE 9</small>. Whence [thirty days] for mourning? As it is stated, <i>And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days</i>.<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">(21) <i>ibid</i>. XXXIV, 8.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.7.10,"<small>RULE 10</small>. How is it with pressed clothes? It is forbidden [for a mourner] to don pressed clothes, i.e. those that came from the press.<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">(22) After bleaching, the clothes were put in the press; M.Ḳ. 23a (Sonc. ed., p. 145, n. 5).</i> This is the view of Rabbi [Judah the Prince]; the Sages said: [It refers] to dyed but not white garments. R. Meir said: White but not dyed, new but not worn garments.

Tractate Semachot.7.11,"<small>RULE 11</small>. How is it with cutting the hair? [A mourner] is forbidden to remove the hair whether of the head or of his [upper] lip, or of the beard or of the hair on any part of him. A woman is permitted to remove hair<sup>28</sup><i class=""footnote"">(28) The translation follows the text of GRA and H.</i> after the seven days."
Tractate Semachot.7.12,"<small>RULE 12</small>. How is it with the collection of debts?<sup>29</sup><i class=""footnote"">(29) Cf.

Tractate Semachot.7.13,"<small>RULE 13</small>. How is it with a woman of 'goodly form'? [It is stated,] <i>And thou hast a desire unto her, and wouldest take her to thee to wife; then thou shalt bring her home to thy house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails</i>.<sup>30</sup><i class=""footnote"">(30) Deut.

Eliezer;<sup>31</sup><i class=""footnote"">(31) The text is so corrected by GRA and H in accordance with Yeb. <i>loc. cit</i>. The Heb. verb, the meaning of which is disputed, is lit. 'do'.</i> R. 'Aḳiba [takes the meaning to be,] she lets the hair of her head grow long and lets her nails grow. R. Eliezer said: An act is mentioned in respect of the head<sup>32</sup><i class=""footnote"">(32) <i>She shall shave her head</i>.</i> and an act is mentioned in respect of her nails;<sup>33</sup><i class=""footnote"">(33) <i>And 'do' her nails</i>.</i> as the former signifies removal of the hair so the latter signifies removal of the nails. R. 'Aḳiba said: An act is mentioned in respect of the head and an act is mentioned in respect of the nails; as disfigurement is the purpose of the former so is disfigurement the purpose of the latter. There is a support for R. Eliezer [in the verse], <i>And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard</i>.<sup>34</sup><i class=""footnote"">(34) 2 Sam. XIX, 25, where the word for <i>trimmed</i> is lit. 'done'.</i> There is a support for R. 'Aḳiba [in the verse], <i>Till his hair was grown like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws</i>.<sup>35</sup><i class=""footnote"">(35) Dan. IV, 30. The 'support' is here not the usage of the verb but the idea that letting the nails grow is a disfigurement.</i>"

When does this apply? Only if she does not wish to become a proselyte; but if she is willing to become a proselyte, he has her immersed [in the ritual bath] and emancipates her, and is permitted to marry her forthwith. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: Even if she is not willing<sup>42</sup><i class=""footnote"">(42) Added by GRA.</i> at first, he has her immersed as a handmaid, emancipates her and may marry her forthwith.

Only if his father or mother-in-law died; but if his wife died, he is forbidden to remarry until three Festivals have gone by. R. Judah said: Until two Festivals have gone by, and he brings [her into the marital chamber] on the third. When does this apply?

Cf., however, M.Ḳ. 25a (Sonc. ed., p. 154), Shab. 105b (Sonc. ed., p. 509) where it is taught that one rends the garments on the death of any worthy man.</i> R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: When a Sage dies, all present at his death rend [their garments] for him, but all those who are not present do not rend them."
Tractate Semachot.9.2,"<small>RULE 2</small>. For a Sage who died<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) M.Ḳ. 22b (Sonc. ed., pp. 143f).</i> one bares the right [shoulder]; for an <i>'Ab Beth Din</i> who died one bares the left [shoulder]; for a <i>Nasi'</i> who died one bares both shoulders.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) lit.

'Aḳiba bared both shoulders and kept on beating his heart<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) For 'heart' Sanh. reads 'his flesh'.</i> until the blood flowed, and he cried out, <i>'My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof!</i>'<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) 2 Kings II, 12.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.9.3,"<small>RULE 3</small>.<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) M.Ḳ. 22b (Sonc. ed., p. 140).</i> One does not bare [the shoulder] for the dead in general but only for his father and mother; and if they are not worthy,<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) e.g. if the son is a distinguished scholar, as it would be undignified for him to be seen with bared shoulders; cf. <i>Ṭur</i> Y.D., §340.</i> he does not rend even for his father and mother. It is related that when R. 'Aḳiba's father died, those present bared [the shoulder], but he did not."
Tractate Semachot.9.4,"<small>RULE 4</small>. For the dead in general one rends [the garments] with a knife,<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) M.Ḳ. 22b (Sonc. ed., p. 143).</i> but for his father and mother he does not rend with a knife.<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) But with the hand.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.9.5,"<small>RULE 5</small>. For the dead in general one does not bare his chest, but for his father and mother he bares it.<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) M.Ḳ. <i>loc. cit.</i> (Sonc. ed., p. 142). 'Chest' is lit. 'heart'.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.9.6,"<small>RULE 6</small>. For the dead in general one does not divide<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">(13) <i>ibid</i>.</i> the [upper] selvage-border [of his garment],<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">(14) i.e. about the neck and shoulders.</i> but for his father and mother he does divide it. R. Judah said: Any rending [of a garment] which does not divide the selvage-border is mere make-believe. R. Judah said:<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">(15) M.Ḳ. 26b (Sonc. ed., p. 169).</i> Any initial rending must be [to the extent of] three fingers, while the extension may be as small as he cares.<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">(16) lit. 'whatever it be', i.e. when the tear is extended for another death.</i> One only rends as far down as the region of the navel.<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">(17) If a succession of deaths occurs, that is the limit to which the tear may extend.</i> In the case of children, others rend for them.<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">(18) The reading in M.Ḳ. is 'children are made to rend'; not that they are under the obligation to do so, but in order to arouse sadness in those who witness it.</i> One who rends [not as a relative but] from respect [for the dead] may stitch [the edges] forthwith. The rending of one's undershirt is not indispensable.<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">(19) Cf. M.Ḳ. 22b (Sonc. ed., p. 142).</i> R. Benjamin said in the name of R. 'Aḳiba: One must rend the undershirt."
Tractate Semachot.9.7,"<small>RULE 7</small>.<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">(20) <i>ibid</i>.</i> For the dead in general one rends only the uppermost [garment], but for his father and mother he must rend [all] even though he be wearing a hundred. A woman only rends her uppermost [garment]. R. Judah said: A woman rends her undergarment, turns it front to back, and then rends the remaining [garments].<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">(21) So as not to expose her chest.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.9.8,"<small>RULE 8</small>. For the dead generally one tacks<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">(22) With large basting stitches.</i> the rent together after seven days, and [completely] restitches [the edges] after thirty; but for one's father and mother one never restitches [the edges]. A woman tacks the rent together after seven [days] and restitches [the edges] after thirty. R. Judah said: A woman tacks the rent together immediately<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">(23) From a sense of self-respect (M.Ḳ. <i>loc. cit.</i>).</i> and restitches [the edges] after seven [days].<sup>24</sup><i class=""footnote"">(24) So GRA and H; V reads 'three'.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.9.9,"<small>RULE 9</small>.<sup>25</sup><i class=""footnote"">(25) Cf.

R. Hananel, on the basis of a passage in j.M.Ḳ. III, 8, 83d, explains 'reduces the funeral expenses and the lament to a minimum'.</i> but in the case of his father and mother, whoever greatly occupies himself with their affairs and does not expedite the bier is praiseworthy. But if time is pressing, or the Sabbath-eve is approaching, or rain falls, he may expedite the bier for his father and mother and does not unduly occupy himself with their affairs."
Tractate Semachot.9.10,"<small>RULE 10</small>. For the dead in general it is forbidden to wear pressed clothes until thirty days [are completed], but in the case of his father and mother it is forbidden until the [next] Festival occurs and then only if his companions rebuke him.<sup>28</sup><i class=""footnote"">(28) On his untidy appearance.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.9.11,"<small>RULE 11</small>.<sup>29</sup><i class=""footnote"">(29) M.Ḳ. 22b (Sonc. ed., p. 141).</i> For the dead generally it is forbidden to trim one's hair until thirty days are completed; but in the case of his father and mother, one lets the hair grow long until his companions rebuke him."
Tractate Semachot.9.12,"<small>RULE 12</small>. For the dead generally one is forbidden to engage in trade<sup>30</sup><i class=""footnote"">(30) Not ordinary trade which is permissible after seven days of mourning, but to set out on a business journey to distant lands, because that might be interpreted as an indication of callousness.</i> until thirty days are completed; but for one's father and mother until his companions rebuke him and say to him, 'Come out with us'."
Tractate Semachot.9.13,"<small>RULE 13</small>.<sup>31</sup><i class=""footnote"">(31) Cf. M.Ḳ. <i>loc. cit.</i></i> For the dead generally it is forbidden to go to a house of feasting until thirty days are completed; but for one's father and mother, all the twelve months unless it is for a sacred cause.<sup>32</sup><i class=""footnote"">(32) e.g. a wedding.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.9.14,"<small>RULE 14</small>. If news reached him that his father died and he rent, but [in fact] it was his mother, he has done his duty.<sup>33</sup><i class=""footnote"">(33) He has not to rend again.</i> [If news reached him that] his mother died, but it was his father and he rent, he has done his duty. [If news reached him that] his father died and he rent, but it was one of his near relatives, he has done his duty. [If news reached him that] one of his near relatives died, but it was his father, he has not done his duty.<sup>34</sup><i class=""footnote"">(34) He has to rend again.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.9.15,"<small>RULE 15</small>. If one's father and mother died [at the same time], he makes only one rent for the two of them.<sup>35</sup><i class=""footnote"">(35) Cf. M.Ḳ. 26b (Sonc. ed., p. 170).</i> R. Judah b. Tema said: He rends for each separately. If one's ten children died at the same time, he makes one rent for all of them."
Tractate Semachot.9.16,"<sup>36</sup><i class=""footnote"">(36) <i>ibid</i>.</i>If after he had made a rent [for another] news reached him that his son died, he continues to rend until it [reaches down] to the navel; when it has reached the navel he turns [the garment] front to back."
Tractate Semachot.9.17,"If his son died and he rent [and news of another death reached him], he leaves a space of three fingers and again rends."
Tractate Semachot.9.18,"<small>RULE 16</small>.<sup>37</sup><i class=""footnote"">(37) The text is corrupt, and the translation follows the version of Nachmanides (cf. N.Y.).</i> The rent must be made only between the two borders;<sup>38</sup><i class=""footnote"">(38) On either side of the front opening of the shirt or tunic.</i> one who makes the rent along the border or at the side has not done his duty.<sup>39</sup><i class=""footnote"">(39) Because the rent is hidden.</i> R. Judah said: He has done his duty. R. Judah said: It happened in the days of Harsum<sup>40</sup><i class=""footnote"">(40) The name of a High Priest who lived in a time of persecution. GRA reads <i>ḥerum</i> which means 'prohibition to travel', e.g. in a time of war.</i> that people used to make the rent at the lower end [of the garment] and at the side. His colleagues retorted, 'No proof may be adduced [from a practice adopted] in a time of danger'."
Tractate Semachot.9.19,"A man dressed in torn garments does not rend.<sup>41</sup><i class=""footnote"">(41) Since his garments are already torn, the new rent will not be distinguishable.</i> R. Judah said: One who rends a cloak of <i>Birrus</i>,<sup>42</sup><i class=""footnote"">(42) 'A cloth named after a Celtic people, Burri' (Krauss); 'a cloak of thick woollen material' (Jastrow).</i> a Brundisian cloak,<sup>43</sup><i class=""footnote"">(43) A cloak thicker than the previous material (Jastrow); a cloth named after a Celtic people, the Burridens (Krauss).</i> a <i>Poenula</i>,<sup>44</sup><i class=""footnote"">(44) A travelling cloak (Jastrow).</i> a stitched garment or a veil,<sup>45</sup><i class=""footnote"">(45) Jastrow emends <span dir=""rtl"">חרוד</span> to <span dir=""rtl"">רדיד</span>, a garment of fine texture.</i> has not done his duty.<sup>46</sup><i class=""footnote"">(46) These materials are either too thick or too fine for the rent to be distinguishable.</i> One who rends a basted garment<sup>47</sup><i class=""footnote"">(47) i.e. one sewn with large stitches.</i> has done his duty. What constitutes a basted garment? [When its tear] has been completely basted."
Tractate Semachot.9.20,"<small>RULE 17</small>. These are the rents which may not be basted: [When it was done] for his father or mother, for his teacher who instructed him in wisdom, for a scroll of the Torah which has been burnt, for the ruined Temple, for evil tidings, [on hearing] the Divine Name blasphemed, on seeing Jerusalem from Mount Scopus,<sup>48</sup><i class=""footnote"">(48) Because from there the ruins of Jerusalem are visible.</i> and [on the death of] a <i>Nasi</i>'. Some add: [On the death of] a High Priest, a prophet, or an <i>'Ab Beth Din</i>. As regards the burning of a scroll of the Torah, [the garment is rent] not on hearing of this happening but only when he stands by while it burns. As for the ruined Temple, [he rends his garment] even if he heard that it has been destroyed; similarly with evil tidings because they are as grievous as the destruction of the Temple."
Tractate Semachot.9.21,"One who sees Jerusalem from Mount Scopus must rend; when he enters [the city] he extends the rent, and if he goes up [again to Jerusalem] he must extend it further. 'If he goes up again'—this is to teach that he is obliged to make a rent every time he goes up [to Jerusalem] during each period [of thirty days].<sup>49</sup><i class=""footnote"">(49) [The meaning is illustrated by j.Ber. IX, 2, 13d: R. Simeon Ḳamṭraya asked R. Hiyya b. Abba, 'Since I am an ass-driver and go up to Jerusalem throughout the year, how is it about rending my garment?' He replied, 'Within thirty days [after a visit] it is unnecessary for you to rend'.]</i> If he came up [to Jerusalem] and settled there, he rends once and has thereby done his duty."
Tractate Semachot.9.22,"<small>RULE 18</small>.

M.Ḳ. 26b (Sonc. ed., p. 169).</i> All rent [garments] which may not be basted must not be sold to non-Jews<sup>52</sup><i class=""footnote"">(52) Lest they resell it to a Jew.</i> or stitched together or be reversed from top to bottom, according to the view of R. Simeon; but R. Eliezer permits it to be done. <sup>53</sup><i class=""footnote"">(53) Cf. M.Ḳ. <i>loc. cit.</i> (Sonc. ed., p. 172).</i>One who borrows a tunic from his companion to go and visit his father and when he arrives finds that his father died, he rends it, bastes it and returns it to his companion. If, however, he borrowed it without specifying for what purpose he needed it, he is not permitted<sup>54</sup><i class=""footnote"">(54) This is the reading of GRA and H.</i> to rend it."
Tractate Semachot.9.23,"<small>RULE 19</small>.<sup>55</sup><i class=""footnote"">(55) Cf. M.Ḳ. <i>loc. cit.</i></i> One who goes out before the bier of the dead with a garment already rent robs the dead [of his due]. More grievous is the robbing of the dead than robbing the living, because one who robs the living can appease him by making restitution, but one who robs the dead cannot appease him by making restitution."
Tractate Semachot.9.24,"<sup>56</sup><i class=""footnote"">(56) This sentence and the next Rule are transposed in accordance with GRA. A better sequence is thereby obtained.</i>Likewise you may say: One who honours his father and mother after their death<sup>57</sup><i class=""footnote"">(57) Cf.

Tractate Semachot.9.25,"<small>RULE 20</small>.

Ber. 18a (Sonc. ed., p. 106).</i> is exempt from reading the <i>Shema'</i> and <i>Tefillah</i> and from all the commandments prescribed in the Torah. Even if he desires to place himself under greater restrictions [than the law requires] he should not do so out of respect for the dead."
Tractate Semachot.10.2,"<small>RULE 2</small>.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) Cf. Ber. 19a (Sonc. ed., p. 116).</i> When the time comes for reading the <i>Shema'</i>, all the people [present] read it but he remains silent; when they stand to read the <i>Tefillah</i>, all read it but he justifies for himself the divine decree. What does he say? 'Sovereign of all the universe, I have sinned before Thee; I have repaid but few of my obligations; I merit much more punishment than this; may it be Thy will to repair our breaches and to comfort us'. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: He also prays for all the needs of the dead person."

He is not included in the <i>Zimmun</i>, others do not say Grace on his behalf, and we do not request him, 'Say Grace'.<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) This means to lead the company in Grace after meals; but the Gemara, Ber. 17b (Sonc. ed., p. 107), reads 'and he does not say a blessing [over food]', which Rashi interprets as referring to Grace before meals.</i> When does this apply? On week-days, but on the Sabbath<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) When there is no outward mourning.</i> he eats as much as he needs, he may eat meat and drink wine, and is included in the <i>Zimmun</i>. Rabban Gamaliel said: A mourner [is regarded] on the Sabbath as if he were not a mourner."

Tractate Semachot.10.8,"<small>RULE 8</small>. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: Rabban Gamaliel had a borrowed grave<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">(19) It is not mentioned elsewhere in Rabbinic literature and what it denotes is uncertain. It probably means a sepulchre owned by Rabban Gamaliel which was lent for the purpose described when it was required.</i> in Jabneh where they brought the dead and locked the door behind it.

R. Meir said: In the first and second week he does not enter the Synagogue, in the third he enters and sits in his [usual] place, and in the fourth he is like any other person. To what does this apply? To a Synagogue, but as for a House of Study he may enter it even in the first week."
Tractate Semachot.10.12,"<sup>27</sup><i class=""footnote"">(27) This paragraph is Rule 10 in H in a fuller form.</i>On the Sabbath-eve at dusk he unmuffles his head; at the termination of the Sabbath he muffles it again.

Tractate Semachot.10.15,"<sup>30</sup><i class=""footnote"">(30) This is Rule 15 in H in a different form.</i>R. Hanina b. Gamaliel said: We may discourse upon an aggadic theme in the <i>Beth Hammidrash</i> of a mourner. In Judea they greeted mourners [on the Sabbath] on their entry and departure to indicate that there is no mourning on the Sabbath."
Tractate Semachot.11.1,"<small>RULE 1</small>. In a city where there are two dead, they take out the first<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) i.e. the one who died first and then the second.</i> [for burial]; and if<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) So GRA and H. V reads 'and they do not'.</i> they keep the first overnight<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) For reasons which follow.</i> they take out the second, because [the Sages] said, 'Whoever keeps the dead overnight disfigures him'.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) Sanh. 46b (Sonc. ed., p. 307) reads 'transgresses a negative commandment on account of him', and GRA corrects accordingly.</i> But if [the delay] is to dig a grave for him, or to procure shrouds for him, or to enable his relatives to come from another place, he may be kept overnight and there is no wrong done.<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) lit. 'and there is nothing in it'.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.11.2,"When a Sage and a disciple die, they first take out the Sage [for burial]; a disciple and an <i>'am ha'arez</i>, they first take out the disciple. If both were Sages or disciples or an <i>'am ha'arez</i> they take out the one who dies first. If a man and a woman [died], they first take out the woman because a woman is apt to become disfigured more quickly.<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) Cf. Rashi on the Mishnah M.Ḳ. 27a.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.11.3,"<small>RULE 2</small>. The differences between man and woman<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) In respect of funeral rites.</i> are: [the bier of] a man is set down in the broadway<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) lit. 'an open space' in the city where the bier was set down for the delivery of the memorial address. There, too, the 'benediction of the mourners' was recited on the return from the cemetery (cf. Keth. 8b, Sonc. ed., p. 37). According to Krauss, <i>Synagogale Altertümer</i>, p. 297, it was the open space in front of the Synagogue, but this definition is disputed; cf. J. Rabbinowitz, <i>Mishnah Megillah</i>, p. 88.</i> but not that of a woman;<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) 'For the sake of propriety', M.Ḳ. 27a (Sonc. ed., p. 177).</i> for a man they go up with the <i>ḥeber 'ir</i><sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) This term may signify a Rabbi who took a leading part in town affairs, or 'a group' denoting either a town council similar to the Roman Collegia or an official communal religious or charitable organization (Meg. 27b, Sonc. ed., p. 164, n. 1). The assembly was usually headed by the Rabbi, and it was considered undignified for him to do so for a woman.</i> but not for a woman; for a male [mourner] the mourners' meal<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) Cf. above II, 9, p. 332, n. 18.</i> is provided but not for a female [mourner].<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) Out of propriety and in order to avoid suspicion of any irregular conduct.</i> R. Judah said: If she has young children, a meal is provided [for her] together with them."
Tractate Semachot.11.4,"<small>RULE 3</small>. If they have taken out the first [body] and buried him, they do not stand in the row for him, nor do they recite for him the benediction of mourners until they have taken out the second and buried him. When they have taken out the second and buried him, people come and stand in the row and comfort [the mourners], and they thereby exempt the community [from their duty in this matter]. We do not offer consolation to two mourners<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">(13) Unless they are both related to the dead person.</i> at the same time unless they are of equal status."
Tractate Semachot.11.5,"<small>RULE 4</small>. We do not take out two dead on one bier unless they are of equal status and [merit] equal praise. It is related of a certain man in Usha<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">(14) In Galilee.</i> that the house collapsed on his two sons and daughter. People went and inquired of R. Judah [49<i>a</i>] who said, 'Take out the three of them at the same time'.<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">(15) On one bier.</i> They placed the bridegrooms<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">(16) i.e. the sons who but for the accident would later be bridegrooms.</i> at one end [of the bier] and the bride<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">(17) i.e. the dead daughter.</i> at the other and they lamented, 'Alas, alas, bridegrooms! Alas, alas, bride!'"
Tractate Semachot.11.6,"<small>RULE 5</small>. We do not deliver two memorial addresses [at the same time] in one city unless there are sufficient to attend each. We do not bewail two brides [at the same time] in one city unless there are sufficient to attend each. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: Even then it is forbidden because of ill-feeling.<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">(18) People should not fall out in their choice of which to attend.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.11.7,"<small>RULE 6</small>. When a dead person and a bride are being honoured and [the two processions] approach one another, we cause the funeral procession to make way for the bridal procession,<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">(19) Cf. Keth. 17a (Sonc. ed., p. 94).</i> because the honour of the living takes precedence over the honour of the dead. In the case of a royal procession and a bridal procession, the latter makes way<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">(20) <i>ibid</i>.</i> out of respect for the king. King Agrippa made way for a bride and the Sages praised him. They asked him, 'What was your reason for doing this?' He replied, 'I wear a crown every day but she wears a crown for one hour only'."

Abba Saul said: [Good] deeds<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">(22) i.e. honouring the dead or the bride.</i> take precedence of the study of the Torah. R. Judah acted as follows: Whenever he saw a dead person or a bride being honoured, he used to look at his disciples and exclaim, 'Deeds before study'."
Tractate Semachot.11.9,"<small>RULE 8</small>.<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">(23) Cf. M.Ḳ. 20b (Sonc. ed., p. 131).</i> A woman who is bereaved of her father-in-law or any of her husband's relatives may not paint her eyelids with kohl or adorn herself, but conducts herself as [her husband] does.<sup>24</sup><i class=""footnote"">(24) i.e. she observes mourning with him.</i> Likewise if [her husband] is bereaved of his father-in-law or any of his wife's relatives, he cannot compel her to adorn herself but conducts himself as she does."
Tractate Semachot.11.10,"<small>RULE 9</small>.<sup>25</sup><i class=""footnote"">(25) Cf. M.Ḳ. 27a (Sonc. ed., p. 177).</i> Sweeping the floors, washing dishes and making beds do not constitute work for a mourner.<sup>26</sup><i class=""footnote"">(26) They are permissible.</i>"

Tractate Semachot.11.12,"<small>RULE 11</small>. Should five brothers eat at their father's table and he dies, if each of them [usually] goes to his own home to sleep, he overturns [the bed] in his house; but if not, he overturns it only in the house which is used [for sleeping]."
Tractate Semachot.11.13,"<small>RULE 12</small>. If a man possesses five houses, should he be making use of all of them he overturns [the bed] in all of them; if not, he does not overturn it in all of them but only in the house which is used [for sleeping]."
Tractate Semachot.11.14,"<small>RULE 13</small>. If one resides with his friend as a guest, should he be very intimate with him he overturns [the bed there], and if not he does not overturn it."
Tractate Semachot.11.15,"<small>RULE 14</small>. If one is on a journey and news reaches him that he suffered a bereavement, should he be able to overturn [the bed] with the consent of others he overturns it, and if not he does not overturn it."
Tractate Semachot.11.16,"<small>RULE 15</small>. One overturns his bed [which is laid] on two benches or on four stones even if there be five mattresses on it, and even though it be [only] four handbreadths<sup>31</sup><i class=""footnote"">(31) H reads 'cubits'.</i> above the ground, so long as its legs are tilted upwards."
Tractate Semachot.11.17,"<small>RULE 16</small>. So long as his dead is lying before him, a mourner may not sleep on a bed [in an erect position] or on an overturned bed."
Tractate Semachot.11.18,"<small>RULE 17</small>.<sup>32</sup><i class=""footnote"">(32) Cf.

Tractate Semachot.11.19,"<small>RULE 18</small>. The bed has to be overturned six times, five times, four times [or] three times, neither less nor more. How is this? If the death took place close to dusk,<sup>36</sup><i class=""footnote"">(36) And the burial has taken place so that at nightfall one day of mourning has already gone.</i> [it is done] six times; if close to dusk on the Sabbath-eve five times; if a Festival occurs on the day following the Sabbath four times; in the case of the two days of the New Year [after a Sabbath] three times.<sup>37</sup><i class=""footnote"">(37) There being no mourning on Sabbaths and Festivals.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.11.20,"<small>RULE 19</small>.<sup>38</sup><i class=""footnote"">(38) M.Ḳ. 27a (Sonc. ed., p. 173).</i> When does one overturn the bed? From the time the corpse is taken out through the door of the house, according to the view of R. Eliezer. R. Joshua said: From the time the slab closes the tomb. It is related that when Rabban Gamaliel the Elder<sup>39</sup><i class=""footnote"">(39) Rabban Gamaliel was R. Eliezer's brother-in-law.</i> died, as soon as he was taken out through the door of his house, [R.

Tractate Semachot.12.1,"<small>RULE 1</small>.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) Cf.

This is termed 'gathering the bones'; cf. M.Ḳ. I, 5 (Sonc. ed., pp. 40f). By Rabbinical law a man gathering the bones of his father or mother is regarded as a mourner during that day.</i> Both of them may not eat sacred flesh.<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) On that day only.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.12.2,"<small>RULE 2</small>. R. Eliezer said: [On receiving] 'near tidings',<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) Cf. M.Ḳ. 20a (Sonc. ed., p. 127).</i> [that is to say, if news reached him] within thirty days [of the death], one observes [mourning] for seven [days] and thirty [days]; [if the news reached him] later than this he observes [mourning] for only one day. R. 'Aḳiba said: On receiving 'near tidings' [that is to say, if news reached him] within twelve months [of the death], one observes [mourning] for seven [days] and thirty [days]. The Sages said: Whether it be 'near tidings' or 'distant tidings',<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) After thirty days.</i> he observes [mourning] for seven [days] and thirty [days]. It is related that when R. Ẓadoḳ's father died at Ginzaḳ<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) Gazaka, a city in North Media; according to Rawlinson it is Shiz, near lake Urmia (M.Ḳ., Sonc. ed., p. 128, n. 5).</i> in Media and the news reached him after three years, he observed [mourning] for seven [days] and thirty [days]."
Tractate Semachot.12.3,"<small>RULE 3</small>. Any [dead person] for whom one rends [the garments] on his death, one also rends for him when his bones are gathered. For [a dead person] for whom one may not baste [the edge of his garments] on his death, one may not baste them when his bones are gathered."
Tractate Semachot.12.4,"<small>RULE 4</small>. The gathering of bones must be done only during one day; therefore one only gathers them towards dusk.<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) To reduce the period of mourning.</i> If he gathered them throughout the day and<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) The words that follow are based on the reading of GRA and H.</i> it became dark, it is permissible [to continue] on the following day. We do not stand in the row for them, nor do we recite over them the benediction of mourners, nor offer consolation to the mourners<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) By paying a eulogy to the dead.</i> [in public], but we may do so in private. We do not hold an assembly for them in the broadway,<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">(13) Cf. XI, 2, p. 384, n. 10.</i> but we do bring the mourners' meal into the mourner's home.<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">(14) But not in public as is done after a funeral.</i> R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: During the day he lies<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">(15) The translation follows the emended text of GRA and H.</i> on an overturned bed and at dusk he straightens it."
Tractate Semachot.12.5,"<small>RULE 5</small>. The following was the practice of the Brotherhoods<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">(16) Associations organized for the purpose, <i>inter alia</i>, of attending to the dead and mourners. Cf. Krauss, <i>Talmudische Archäologie</i>, II, p. 63 and p. 480, n. 459.</i> in Jerusalem: Some went to the house of mourning, others to the house of feasting,<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">(17) A marriage feast.</i> some went to a circumcision<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">(18) lit. 'the week of the son', a disguised term for the circumcision ceremony which was adopted during the Hadrianic persecution when the rite was prohibited; cf. B.B., Sonc. ed., p. 246, n. 8.</i> and others to gather bones. [In the choice between going] to the house of mourning and the house of feasting, the house of feasting takes precedence; to a circumcision and to gather bones, the circumcision takes precedence. The pious men of olden days, however, gave precedence to the house of mourning over the house of feasting, for it is stated, <i>It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting; for that is the end of all men, and the living will lay it to his heart</i>.<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">(19) Eccl. VII, 2.</i> Whoever follows the bier should say, 'I, too, will follow this one [to the grave]'."
Tractate Semachot.12.6,<small>RULE 6</small>. We do not break the bones nor sever the sinews [of a corpse] unless the bones were already broken of their own accord and the sinews severed of their own accord.
Tractate Semachot.12.7,"<small>RULE 7</small>. A man may gather all bones except those of his father and mother,<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">(20) But others gather them for him.</i> in the view of R. Joḥanan b. Nuri. R. 'Aḳiba said: Bones may not be gathered until the flesh dissolves; once the flesh is dissolved the appearance [of the person] is no longer recognizable.<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">(21) Consequently there is no disrespect to a dead parent if the son gathers the bones.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.12.8,"<small>RULE 8</small>. One may gather the bones of two dead persons at the same time; he then places one collection at one end of the sheet [49<i>b</i>] and the other at the other side of it, in the view of R. 'Aḳiba. R. Joḥanan b. Nuri said: [If this is done] the sheet may in the end decay and the bones be mixed together; so we gather them and place them [separately] in cedar<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">(22) According to the text emended by GRA and H.</i> [boxes]."
Tractate Semachot.12.9,"<small>RULE 9</small>. We sprinkle wine and oil upon [the bodies], in the view of R. 'Aḳiba; R. Simeon b. Nanos said: Oil but not wine because wine causes deterioration;<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">(23) It is not permitted to hasten their disintegration.</i> and the Sages said: Neither oil nor wine because they breed wood-worms,<sup>24</sup><i class=""footnote"">(24) So GRA. V is in disorder.</i> but we place dry clods of earth upon them. R. Eliezer b. Ẓadoḳ said: When my father was dying he gave me this instruction, 'On my death bury me first in a valley, and later gather my bones and place them in a cedar<sup>25</sup><i class=""footnote"">(25) As emended by GRA.</i> coffin, but do not gather them with your hands'. And I did so for him. R. Joḥanan entered [the cave] and spread a sheet over [the bones]; then I entered, rent [my garments] and spread dry clods of earth [over the bones].<sup>26</sup><i class=""footnote"">(26) GRA reads 'and spread a linen sheet over them'.</i> As [my father] did for his father so I did for him."
Tractate Semachot.12.10,"<small>RULE 10</small>. A man bandages<sup>27</sup><i class=""footnote"">(27) Correcting <span dir=""rtl"">מברך</span> to <span dir=""rtl"">מכרך</span>.</i> and binds [the limb] of a man but not of a woman; a woman bandages and binds both a man and a woman. A man attends to a man suffering from disease of the bowels but not to a woman;<sup>28</sup><i class=""footnote"">(28) From modesty.</i> a woman attends both to a man<sup>29</sup><i class=""footnote"">(29) A woman is assumed to be less liable to prurient thoughts.</i> and a woman suffering from disease of the bowels."
Tractate Semachot.12.11,"<small>RULE 11</small>. Abba Saul b. Bothnith<sup>30</sup><i class=""footnote"">(30) So H for the unintelligible reading of V.</i> used to say to his sons, 'Bury me at the feet of my father and remove the thread of blue from [the <i>zizith</i> of] my cloak'."

R. Judah said: If his father is old or ill, he may enter and bathe him because that is a way of honouring him.<sup>33</sup><i class=""footnote"">(33) By attending to his needs.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.12.13,"<small>RULE 13</small>. We do not take out [the dead on] a bier unless his head and the greater part of his body are there. R. Judah said: The spinal column and the skull constitute the greater part. It is related of the son of R. Hanina b. Teradion that he took to evil ways and robbers seized and killed him. After three days his swollen body was found; they placed him in a coffin,<sup>34</sup><i class=""footnote"">(34) According to an emended reading.</i> set him on a bier, took him into the city and paid him a eulogy<sup>35</sup><i class=""footnote"">(35) For the parallel to this story, cf. Midrash Lamentations III, 6 (Sonc. ed., p. 195).</i> out of respect for his father and mother. His father quoted over him the verse, <i>And thou moan, when thine end cometh, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed, and say, 'How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof; neither have I hearkened to the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me! I was well nigh in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly</i>.'<sup>36</sup><i class=""footnote"">(36) Prov. V, 11-14.</i> When he had finished he went back to the beginning of the verse. His mother quoted over him the verse, <i>A foolish son is the vexation to his father, and bitterness to her that bore him</i>.<sup>37</sup><i class=""footnote"">(37) <i>ibid</i>. XVII, 25.</i> His sister quoted over him the verse, <i>Bread of falsehood is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel</i>.<sup>38</sup><i class=""footnote"">(38) <i>ibid</i>.

Tractate Semachot.13.1,"<small>RULE 1</small>. One who gathers or guards bones is exempt from reading the <i>Shema'</i>, the <i>Tefillah</i>, from <i>tefillin</i> and all the commandments prescribed by the Torah. Should he desire to impose a strict view upon himself, he may not do so because of the honour of the bones.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) His obedience of laws, from which he is exempt, would result in delay in the burial of the bones.</i> R. Joḥanan b. Nuri said: He should withdraw a distance of four cubits and read [the prayers]. R. Simeon b. 'Azzai said: If he was travelling on a ship with the bones, he should remove them to another part [of the vessel] and read.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) The text is in disorder and the translation follows the version of GRA.</i> R. Isaac said: If they are the bones of a near relative he is exempt, but if of strangers he is under obligation. R. Simeon said: On the Sabbath he is under obligation,<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) Because if he does not read the prayers he would appear to be mourning on the Sabbath which is not permitted.</i> but on week-days he is exempt. R. Nathan said:<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) The text is corrupt and emended by GRA. R. Nathan agrees with the ruling that one who guards bones is exempt from the <i>Shema'</i>, etc., because his concern about their safety may not allow him to concentrate on his religious devotions; but where he carries them in a bundle the question of their safety does not arise and he should be able to concentrate.</i> If the bundle [containing the bones] is with him, he is not exempt<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) In his note on the text GRA reads 'is exempt', but in his annotation to Y.D. ch. 403 he rules that, in the circumstances here described, the man is obliged to read the prayers, etc.</i> because the obligation of guarding [the bones] rests upon him but not the obligation of guarding the bundle."
Tractate Semachot.13.2,"<small>RULE 2</small>. One who is removing bones or sacred books from one place to another may not place them on a wagon or a ship or an animal and<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) So GRA and H.

Tractate Semachot.13.3,"<small>RULE 3</small>. If one passes through graves he should not wear the <i>tefillin</i> or carry sacred books in his hand, because it is disrespectful [to the dead].<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) In Ber. 18a (Sonc. ed., p. 108) he is said to transgress the teaching, <i>Whoso mocketh the poor blasphemeth his Maker</i> (Prov. XVII, 5), because the dead are 'poor' in that they cannot acquire merit by the study and performance of the Torah.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.13.4,"<small>RULE 4</small>. If one is constructing a burial chamber<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) Vaults were made in the graves for receiving the dead; cf. Ber. 14b (Sonc. ed., p. 85).</i> [in a cemetery] and the time for reading the <i>Shema'</i> arrives, he should not read the <i>Shema'</i> or the <i>Tefillah</i> but withdraw to a clean place and read; after that he re-enters [the chamber]."
Tractate Semachot.13.5,"<small>RULE 5</small>. If one finds a dead body in a grave he may not move it from its place,<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) The dead acquire possession of the spot wherein they are buried. Cf. Sanh. 47b (Sonc. ed., p. 316).</i> unless he knows that the place was lent to it.<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) Cf. above X, 8. The word 'lent' is according to the text of GRA and H.</i>"

GRA reads: 'One who finds bones in mounds should place them in a grave'.</i> in the view of R. 'Aḳiba; but the Sages said: He should not move them from their place. If he found them in a burial chamber or in a cedar-wood coffin,<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">(14) So Jastrow. GRA has 'or in a ravine'.</i> he should not move them from their place."
Tractate Semachot.13.7,"<small>RULE 7</small>. We may not transfer a dead body or bones from one place of honour to another, or from a place of shame to a place of honour,<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">(15) The translation follows GRA who alters the text in agreement with j.M.Ḳ. II, 4, 81b.</i> and needless to say from a place of honour to a place of shame; but within [the dead person's] property it is permissible [to transfer] even from a place of honour to a place of shame, because it is to his honour.<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">(16) To be buried within his own property.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.13.8,"<small>RULE 8</small>. We do not bury two dead bodies in close proximity to each other, or a dead body in close proximity to bones, or bones in close proximity to a dead body. R. Judah said: Whoever sleeps with him in his lifetime<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">(17) i.e. young children.</i> is buried with him in his death.<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">(18) i.e. in close proximity to him.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.13.9,"<small>RULE 9</small>. One may derive benefit from a grave which has been cleared,<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">(19) Since it is no longer considered the possession of the dead.</i> but he may not turn it into a magazine for straw, a stable, a store for wood or a depot. If one clears a burial chamber he may not make use of it [for any other purpose]. If one prepares a grave for a living person<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">(20) In preparation for his death.</i> he may sell it; but if he prepared it for the dead he may not sell it. Stones which were hewn<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">(21) To be used for a sepulchre.</i> for one still living may be sold, but if for the dead they may not be sold. If one clears a coffin he may not make use of it; but if it was made of stone or earthenware it must be broken up, and if of wood it must be burnt. If one finds boards in a cemetery<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">(22) So emended by GRA. V reads 'if one carries out boards to a cemetery'.</i> he may not move them from their place."
Tractate Semachot.14.1,"<small>RULE 1</small>. A watercourse should not be diverted through cemeteries,<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) Out of respect for the dead; cf. Meg. 29a (Sonc. ed., p. 177).</i> a path should not be cut through them, cattle should not be grazed on them, one should not take a walk there<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) It should not be used as a short cut.</i> for pleasure, and one should not gather wood or grass from there. If he gathered them he may not make use of them, and if he gathered them for the benefit [of the cemetery]<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) To clear the ground for more graves. The words in brackets are inserted by GRA and H.</i> he burns them on the spot."
Tractate Semachot.14.2,"<small>RULE 2</small>. Inherited lands may be conveyed from one [party] to another or alienated from one family to another, but a grave cannot be so conveyed or alienated.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) Cf. below, §11.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.14.3,"<small>RULE 3</small>. A new cemetery<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) In which only a few have been buried.</i> may be measured<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) To find out how much land had already been used for burials as a guide for further interments.</i> and sold or divided;<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) Among heirs.</i> an old one may not be measured, sold or divided. A new cemetery may sometimes be regarded as old and an old one as new. An old cemetery in which ten bodies have been buried without the consent of the owners is regarded as new; it may be measured, sold or divided. A new cemetery in which one premature child<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) Under thirty days old; how much more an adult!</i> lies buried with the consent of the owners is regarded as old; it may not be measured, sold or divided.<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) 'Or divided' is added by GRA and H.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.14.4,"<small>RULE 4</small>. No right of legal ownership can be claimed in respect of a cemetery of exiles;<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) Who in time of pestilence or war move from place to place.</i> in time of pestilence or war no right of legal ownership can be claimed in respect of cemeteries.<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) This clause is explanatory of the preceding.</i> Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel said: Premature children do not acquire possession of their grave.<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) If buried without the consent of the owners.</i> One who has buried without the consent [of the owner of the land] possesses no right of legal ownership."
Tractate Semachot.14.5,"<small>RULE 5</small>. A woman who inherited a grave-space is buried therein as also her issue, in the view of R. Meir; R. Judah said: She [is buried there] but not<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">(13) So GRA and H. V reads 'and all' incorrectly.</i> her issue. R. Judah admits that any offspring whom she saw in her lifetime are buried with her [if they die] after her death.<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">(14) But not a posthumous child. V has 'on her death' and the reading of H is adopted.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.14.6,"<small>RULE 6</small>. If her father says, 'Let her be buried by my side' and her husband says, 'Let her be buried [50<i>a</i>] by my side', she is buried by the side of her father; but if she had children, she is buried by her husband's side, and if she says, 'Bury me by the side of my children', she is buried by their side."
Tractate Semachot.14.7,"<small>RULE 7</small>. If her father says, 'She is not to be buried by my side' and her husband says, 'She is not to be buried by my side', she is buried by the side of her husband because her husband has the obligation to support her, redeem her [from captivity],<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">(15) Cf. Keth. 46b (Sonc. ed., p. 266).</i> bury her and provide all that is necessary<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">(16) So GRA.</i> for her funeral, [for example,] a bier, pipers<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">(17) To play at the funeral; cf. B.M. VI, 1 (Sonc. ed., p. 437, n. 3).</i> and wailing women.<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">(18) Cf. M.Ḳ. III, 9 (Sonc. ed., p. 185). They are mentioned in Jer. IX, 16.</i> Where it is customary to have a memorial address, he has a memorial address delivered over his wife. If her husband does not attend to her [burial, her father] attends to it and the expenses are recovered from [the husband] by force."
Tractate Semachot.14.8,"<small>RULE 8</small>.<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">(19) The text is in disorder. The translation follows the emendation of GRA on the basis of Sanh. 47b (Sonc. ed., p. 316). Higger (Introduction, pp. 49f) points out that the text is not in agreement with the parallel passage in Tosiftha Ohol. XVI, 9 or with the Babylonian Talmud <i>loc. cit.</i> or with the Jerusalem Talmud, Nazir IX, 3, 57d. He suggests that the compiler of <i>Semaḥoth</i> must have had before him various passages dealing with the uncleanness of the grave and the prohibition of using graves and he mixed them up. The introductory phrase 'consequently you may say' points to the fact that there must have been a discussion on the subject and the statement in the text sums up the conclusion arrived at.</i> Consequently you say that there are three kinds of graves: a grave which has been found may be cleared,<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">(20) i.e. the bones are transferred to another place. A person had been buried there without the knowledge and consent of the owner.</i> and if cleared its site is [ritually] clean and it is permitted to make use of it. A known grave may not be cleared,<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">(21) As a precautionary measure against persons contracting defilement.</i> and if cleared its site is [ritually] unclean and it is forbidden to make use of it. A grave which injures the public<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">(22) Reading <span dir=""rtl"">המזיק</span>, i.e. a grave which lies in a public thoroughfare and so communicates uncleanness to people who are overshadowed by something which also overshadows it.</i> may not be cleared, and if cleared its site is [ritually] clean but it is forbidden to make use of it."
Tractate Semachot.14.9,"<small>RULE 9</small>. As regards a cemetery which is enclosed by a city on three sides or on two opposite sides, if it is more than fifty cubits distant from one side [of the city] and more than fifty cubits distant from the other side, it is not<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">(23) The negative is inserted by GRA and H.</i> cleared and if less it may be cleared."
Tractate Semachot.14.10,"<small>RULE 10</small>.<sup>24</sup><i class=""footnote"">(24) The text is reconstructed in agreement with Tosiftha B.B. I, 11.</i> All graves may be cleared except that of a king or a prophet. R. 'Aḳiba said: The grave of a king or prophet may also be cleared. R. 'Aḳiba was asked, 'Were not the graves of the house of David and of Huldah the prophetess<sup>25</sup><i class=""footnote"">(25) Cf. 2 Kings XXII, 14.</i> [situated] in Jerusalem and no man ever touched them?' He replied, 'Can you adduce a proof from [Jerusalem]? There was an underground passage there and the uncleanness was conveyed to the brook of Kidron'.<sup>26</sup><i class=""footnote"">(26) East of Jerusalem.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.14.11,"<small>RULE 11</small>. If one sells to another the path [leading] to his grave, this is no sale.<sup>27</sup><i class=""footnote"">(27) Because the sale is a slight on his family; cf. B.B. 100b (Sonc. ed., p. 420).</i> If one sells to another his place of mourning,<sup>28</sup><i class=""footnote"">(28) When, on the return from the cemetery, the cortège halts and the mourners receive condolence; cf. B.B. Sonc. ed., p. 416, n. 8.</i> it is no sale. If one sells<sup>29</sup><i class=""footnote"">(29) V reads 'buys' which is corrected by GRA.</i> to another his halting place,<sup>30</sup><i class=""footnote"">(30) Where, on returning from the funeral, ceremonial halts were made to offer consolation to the mourners.</i> the elders of the <i>'Ab Beth Din</i> estimate it as an area of four <i>ḳab</i>.<sup>31</sup><i class=""footnote"">(31) An area sufficient for sowing four <i>ḳab</i> of seed.</i> A private path [has a width] of four cubits, a public road [a width] of sixteen cubits, the king's highway has no limits. The path of a funeral cortège has no limits.<sup>32</sup><i class=""footnote"">(32) The followers may even tread upon cornfields if there is no room for them on the public highway.</i> and the path of [a place of] mourning has no limits."
Tractate Semachot.14.12,"<small>RULE 12</small>.<sup>33</sup><i class=""footnote"">(33) Cf. M.Ḳ. 21b (Sonc. ed., p. 136).</i> One who sees a mourner within the thirty days speaks to him words of consolation but does not inquire after his welfare; after thirty days he inquires after his welfare but does not speak to him words of consolation; within the twelve months he inquires after his welfare and then speaks words of consolation to him; after twelve months he speaks to him words of consolation and then inquires after his welfare."
Tractate Semachot.14.13,"R. Meir said: One who sees a mourner within the thirty days speaks to him words of consolation and then inquires after his welfare; after thirty days but within twelve months he inquires after his welfare and then speaks to him words of consolation; after twelve months he makes no reference at all [to the bereavement]. For R. Meir illustrated the matter by a parable. To what may it be compared? To one who has a wound and was cured of it, and a physician came and said to him, 'Pay me a fee and I will lance your wound and cure you'. Likewise, whoever reminds a mourner after twelve months [of his bereavement] is accounted as if he had stirred up his wound again. Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel said: To one whose wife died and he remarried within twelve months we speak words of consolation in the street but not in his home.<sup>34</sup><i class=""footnote"">(34) Not to embarrass his second wife.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.14.14,"<small>RULE 13</small>. All bring to the house of a mourner loaves of white bread, meat and fish, and where an assembly in the broadway<sup>35</sup><i class=""footnote"">(35) Cf. XII, 4, n. 13.</i> is held also vegetables, peas and fish. Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel said: Where it is customary also cooked dishes.<sup>36</sup><i class=""footnote"">(36) Cf. B.B. 16b (Sonc. ed., p. 84). When Abraham died, Jacob made a broth of lentils to comfort his father Isaac.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.14.15,"<small>RULE 14</small>.<sup>37</sup><i class=""footnote"">(37) Cf. Keth. 8b (Sonc. ed., p. 42), j.Ber. III, 6a. The text here is similar to that of the Jerusalem Talmud.</i> Ten cups of wine are drunk in the house of a mourner: two before the meal, five during the meal and three after the meal, namely one for the benediction of mourners,<sup>38</sup><i class=""footnote"">(38) The Jerusalem Talmud reads 'for the Grace after meals'.</i> one for the consolation of the mourners and one [in honour of] charity.<sup>39</sup><i class=""footnote"">(39) i.e. in honour of those who came to comfort the mourners and performed a pious act.</i> Three more [cups of wine] were added later, namely, one for the Chief of the Synagogue,<sup>40</sup><i class=""footnote"">(40) An official who administered the external affairs of the Synagogue (cf. Yoma VII, 1, Sonc. ed., p. 322, n. 2).</i> one for the Synagogue attendant<sup>41</sup><i class=""footnote"">(41) An official who seems to have been next in rank to the Chief of the Synagogue.</i> and one for Rabban Gamaliel.<sup>42</sup><i class=""footnote"">(42) Who introduced a simple style for funerals to lessen the expense and relieve poor mourners; cf. M.Ḳ. 27b (Sonc. ed., p. 178), Keth. 8b (Sonc. ed., p. 43).</i> When, however, the <i>Beth Din</i> found that people became intoxicated they restored the <i>status quo</i>.<sup>43</sup><i class=""footnote"">(43) i.e. that ten cups only should be drunk.</i>"
Tractate Semachot.14.16,"<small>RULE 15</small>. He who recites the Grace after meals in the house of a mourner does not say the fourth benediction,<sup>44</sup><i class=""footnote"">(44) Cf. P.B., p. 283. In Ber. 46b (Sonc. ed., p. 281) the decision is that the benediction is not omitted.</i> in the view of R. Jose the Galilean; R. 'Aḳiba said: [He recites] 'Who art kind and dealest kindly'; the Sages said: [The benediction to be recited is, 'Blessed art Thou] Who art the true Judge, Who rulest over Thy works, Judge of all generations in righteousness, Whose people and servants we all are; and for all this it is our duty to thank and bless Him'."
Tractate Semachot.14.17,"<small>RULE 16</small>.<sup>45</sup><i class=""footnote"">(45) Cf. Ber. 54a (Sonc. ed., p. 327).</i> He who sees a place where miracles were wrought for Israel says, 'Blessed be He Who wrought miracles for our fathers in this place. <i>O give thanks unto the Lord, for He is good'</i>.<sup>46</sup><i class=""footnote"">(46) Ps.
