Version Notes,
"Tractate Gerim, Introduction.1","<small>JUDAISM AND PROSELYTES</small><br/>The Hebrew term for a proselyte is <i>ger</i>, plural <i>gerim</i>. Its original definition is 'an alien' resident in the Holy Land; but when it came to denote a proselyte to Israel's faith, as a consequence of such conversions, the former had to be described differently and he was known as a <i>ger toshab</i>, 'a resident alien'."
"Tractate Gerim, Introduction.2","In the Bible there is abundant evidence that converts were accepted. Apart from the instance of Ruth and what is recorded in Esth. VIII, 17, the legislation mentions them specifically. Ex. XII, 48 directs what is to be done when <i>a stranger shall sojourn with thee</i> who wishes to observe the Passover. He must subject himself to the same restrictions as a born Israelite on the Day of Atonement (Lev. XVI, 29). The law concerning defilement by contact with the dead and the rite of purification applied equally to him (Num. XIX, 10). The regulations concerning certain offerings were the same for him as any other member of the community (<i>ibid.</i> XV, 14)."
"Tractate Gerim, Introduction.3","The hope that Gentiles will ultimately accept the God of Israel is often expressed. A section of Solomon's prayer at the dedication of the Temple is devoted to them (1 Kings VIII, 41-43). References in the prophetical literature are numerous (cf. Isa. II, 2f., XIV, 1, LVI, 3-6; Jer. III, 17, XII, 16; Zech. XIV, 9)."
"Tractate Gerim, Introduction.4","Contrary to the prevailing idea that post-Biblical Judaism all but excluded proselytes from the community, the evidence proves that an almost unceasing stream of converts swelled the ranks of the Jewish people. The testimony of Philo and Josephus on this point is corroborated by Roman writers like Tacitus and Juvenal (on the whole subject, cf. J.E. X, pp. 220-224, G. F. Moore, <i>Judaism</i>, I, pp. 323-353)."
"Tractate Gerim, Introduction.5","Among the Rabbis of the Talmudic era differences of opinion existed on the desirability of accepting converts. On one side is the statement of R. Eleazar, 'The Holy One, blessed be He, did not exile Israel among the nations save in order that proselytes might join them' (Pes. 87b, Sonc. ed., p. 463). At the other extreme is the harsh saying of R. Helbo, 'Proselytes are as hard for Israel [to endure] as a sore' (Yeb. 47b, Sonc. ed., p. 312), playing on the verb in Isa. XIV, 1, <i>The stranger</i> [<i>ger</i>] <i>shall ioin himself</i> [<i>wenispeḥu</i>] <i>with them</i> and the noun <i>sapaḥath</i>, 'a scab' in Lev. XIII, 2."
"Tractate Gerim, Introduction.6","The position is fairly summed up by Professor Moore as follows: 'Speaking generally the tone of the utterances about proselytes is friendly, though not unduly enthusiastic. This is the more to be noted because the Jews' experience with proselytes must at times have been decidedly discouraging. It can hardly be doubted that in perilous times many apostatized. In the outside lands, at least, many went over to Christianity. In the persecution under Hadrian they were under strong temptation to clear their own skirts by turning informers. It would be nothing surprising if under such circumstances the Rabbis should have looked askance at all proselytes. There is, however, little evidence of such a temper' (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 342)."
"Tractate Gerim, Introduction.7",<small>THE TRACTATE <i>GERIM</i></small>
"Tractate Gerim, Introduction.8",This work is one of the 'Seven Minor Tractates'. Its material is in the main gathered from what is found in the early Rabbinic sources and the Talmud. Whether the collection was made before or after the redaction of the Talmud is a disputed question (cf. the Editor's Preface).
"Tractate Gerim, Introduction.9","In its extant form the tractate in all probability dates from the Geonic period. The subject was at that time of more than theoretical or academic interest. Referring to the laws which were enacted prohibiting proselytization by Jews under severe penalties, Professor Moore remarks, 'Against all such attempts of pagan or Christian rulers to shut up Judaism in itself and prevent its spread, the Jews persisted in their missionary efforts to make the religion God had revealed to their fathers the religion of mankind' (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 353). [The existence of <i>Masseketh Gerim</i>—a manual of the laws relating to converts—is in itself a substantiation of this statement.]"
"Tractate Gerim, Introduction.10",<small>ANALYSIS OF THE TRACTATE</small>
"Tractate Gerim, Introduction.11","Chapter I commences with a full description of the method by which a would-be proselyte is received into the fold. Then, after specifying who is a genuine proselyte, it lays down what is to be done with his wine (and incidentally what is to be done with the food of any <i>'am ha-'arez</i> who becomes a <i>ḥaber</i>), and how far he is exempt from the laws relating to usury and priestly dues."
"Tractate Gerim, Introduction.12","Chapter II deals with circumcision, lustration and sacrifice as prerequisites for entering into the Israelite covenant, and with the question whether proselytes are called to account for sins committed before their conversion."
"Tractate Gerim, Introduction.13","Chapter III commences by defining the <i>ger toshab</i> and laying down rules for his treatment. It then discusses how far the Jewish laws of consanguinity apply to a proselyte, and gives regulations on what is to be done with the property of a proselyte after his death."
"Tractate Gerim, Introduction.14",Chapter IV is a Midrashic disquisition on the consideration which should be shown to proselytes and on the favour with which they are regarded by God for following the example of the Patriarch Abraham.
"Tractate Gerim, Introduction.15",M. SIMON.
Tractate Gerim.1.1,"<small>RULE 1</small>. If a man wishes to become a proselyte he is not accepted at once but they<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) The Rabbis who consider his application.</i> say to him, 'Why do you want to become a proselyte? Do you not see that this people are debased, oppressed and degraded<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) 'Debased' in themselves, 'oppressed' by others, and 'degraded' in consequence. MS.K. and H read 'lowly and persecuted'.</i> more than all other peoples, that diseases and chastisements come upon them and they bury their children and children's children, that they are slaughtered for [observing] circumcision, immersion<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) To purify themselves after ritual defilement.</i> and the other precepts [of the Torah] and cannot hold up their heads<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) lit. 'behave in public'.</i> like other peoples?'"
Tractate Gerim.1.2,"<small>RULE 2</small>. If he says, 'I am not worthy', they dismiss him and he goes his way.<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) MS.K. and H read: 'If he says, ""I am not worthy to place my neck under the yoke of Him Who spoke and the world came into being, blessed be He"", they receive him forthwith, and if not he is dismissed and goes his way'. In Yeb. 47a. (Sonc. ed., p. 311), the reading is 'I know and yet am unworthy' of the privilege of membership of Israel.</i>"
Tractate Gerim.1.3,"<small>RULE 3</small>. If, however, he undertakes [to become a proselyte], they take him down to the place of immersion, cover him in water up to his middle,<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) The place of nakedness.</i> and tell him some of the details of the precepts. [He is informed that he is accepted only] on condition that he will give gleanings, forgotten sheaves, the corner of the field and tithes.<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) Cf. Lev. XIX, 9; Deut. XXIV, 19; Num. XVIII, 26ff.; Deut. XIV, 22ff.; XXVI, 12ff.</i>"
Tractate Gerim.1.4,"<small>RULE 4</small>. As they say this to a man, so they say to a woman that [she is accepted] on condition that she will be particular in regard to <i>niddah, ḥallah</i><sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) Added by MS.K. and H.</i> and the kindling of the Sabbath lamp."
Tractate Gerim.1.5,"<small>RULE 5</small>. When he has bathed and come up [out of the water], they speak to him words of kindness and comfort<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) So MS.K. and H, V 'appropriate words'.</i> [saying], 'To Whom are you cleaving? Happy are you! [You are cleaving] to Him Who spoke and the world came into being, blessed be He; for the world was created only for the sake of Israel;<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) [Cf. Midrash Rabbah, Leviticus, XXXVI, 4 (Sonc. ed., p. 461): 'The heaven and earth were only created for the sake of Israel', because God foresaw that they alone would accept the Torah, without which the universe could not endure.]</i> only Israel are called ""sons of God"",<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) [Cf. Deut. XIV, 1.]</i> and only Israel are [described as] ""beloved of God"".<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) [To be understood in the light of the dictum, 'Beloved are Israel, for unto them was given the desirable instrument', i.e. the Torah (Aboth III, 18, Sonc. ed., III, 14, p. 37).] MS.K. omits the clause.</i> All the things we have said to you<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">(13) viz. at the beginning, 'Why do you want to become a proselyte?'</i> we have said only to increase your reward'."
Tractate Gerim.1.6,"<small>RULE 6</small>. If a proselyte has been circumcised but has not yet bathed [he is a proselyte]; if he has bathed but not yet been circumcised [he is not yet a proselyte]; everything depends on the circumcision. This is the view of R. Eliezer, but R. 'Aḳiba said: Also<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">(14) Reading <i>'af</i> with MS.K. and H instead of <i>'en</i> (not) in V. [Cf. the discussion on the subject in Yeb. 46a, b (Sonc. ed., pp. 302ff.).]</i> [the lack of] bathing is a bar."
Tractate Gerim.1.7,"<small>RULE 7</small>. Anyone who becomes a proselyte for the sake of [marrying a Jewish] woman, or out of fear, or love<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">(15) [Of the Jews, perhaps deriving material advantage from his conversion.]</i> is not a proselyte. Similarly R. Judah and R. Nehemiah said: All [the Gentiles] who were converted in the days of Mordecai and Esther were not genuine proselytes, as it is stated, <i>And many from among the peoples of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews was fallen upon them</i>.<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">(16) Esth. VIII, 17.</i> Anyone who is not converted from purely religious motives<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">(17) lit. 'to the name of Heaven'.</i> is not a proselyte. [60<i>b</i>]"
Tractate Gerim.1.8,"<small>RULE 8</small>. A man gives immersion to a man, and a woman to a woman but not to a man."
Tractate Gerim.1.9,"<small>RULE 9</small>. If a man became a proselyte who had vessels of wine<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">(18) [Wine in the possession of a Gentile is termed <i>yayin nesek</i>, 'wine of libation', and is forbidden to Jews on the suspicion that it may have been used in idolatrous rites.]</i> in his possession and he says, 'I am positive that none of it has been poured out as a libation', the wine is permitted to him and forbidden to others. R. 'Aḳiba said: <sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">(19) A comparison with Tosiftha Ṭohoroth sec. 9 shows that there is a lacuna in the text and that R. 'Aḳiba is speaking of the case where the wine had not been made by the proselyte himself but by another Gentile.</i>If it is forbidden to others, surely it is forbidden to himself! If he says, '[The wine has been made] in a state of purity in the presence of So-and-so who is a <i>ḥaber</i>, he is believed'."
Tractate Gerim.1.10,"Similarly should an <i>'am ha-'arez</i> take upon himself to become a <i>ḥaber</i>, and he had food which should be in a state of ritual purity and said, 'I am positive that it has been prepared in ritual cleanliness', it is permitted to him and forbidden to others. R. 'Aḳiba said: If it is forbidden to others, all the more it is forbidden to himself! But if he said, 'It was prepared in ritual cleanliness in the presence of So-and-so who is a <i>ḥaber'</i>, he is believed.<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">(20) This paragraph is omitted in V and inserted in MS.K. and H.</i>"
Tractate Gerim.1.11,"<small>RULE 10</small>. If an Israelite lends money to a Gentile or a Gentile lends money to an Israelite and he became a proselyte, he collects the principal but not the interest.<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">(21) MS.K. reads: 'One (i.e. the proselyte) takes the capital only (because being now a Jew he may not take interest from a Jew [cf. Lev. XXV, 36f.], and the other (the Jew) takes the interest as well'. The reason is that if this were not done, it might be suspected that the Gentile became a convert to escape paying the interest.</i> R. Judah said: If before conversion he turned the whole into a loan,<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">(22) i.e. added the interest to the principal and wrote a fresh contract for the whole sum as a loan.</i> he collects the whole."
Tractate Gerim.1.12,"<small>RULE 11</small>. How [is the law]? If a first-born son was born to him before he was converted, he is exempt;<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">(23) From his redemption (cf. Ex. XXXIV, 20). MS.K. and H read: 'If a son were born to him or his cow calved or his cow were slaughtered before he was converted, he is exempt' from the priestly dues.</i> but if after he was converted he is liable; in case of doubt he is exempt. If he had dough ready for baking and a field ready for reaping, until he is converted he is exempt<sup>24</sup><i class=""footnote"">(24) From <i>ḥallah</i> and the tithe.</i> but from the time he is converted he is liable. If there is doubt he is exempt."
Tractate Gerim.2.1,"<small>RULE 1</small>. There is a proselyte who is circumcised at eight days old<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) So MS.K. and H. V wrongly, 'a proselyte is always circumcised at eight days old'.</i>. How is this? If he was born before his mother [who became a convert] underwent immersion he is circumcised at a day old,<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) i.e. he is made a proselyte at the earliest moment.</i> but if after his mother underwent immersion at eight days old.<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) Like a child of a Jewish mother.</i>"
Tractate Gerim.2.2,"<small>RULE 2</small>. If a proselyte was already circumcised, or if a child was born circumcised, it is necessary to draw from him blood of the covenant,<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) A slight incision is made to draw a drop of blood.</i> according to Beth Shammai; but Beth Hillel say that it is not necessary."
Tractate Gerim.2.3,"<small>RULE 3</small>. R. Mathia b. Heresh said in the name of R. Ishmael:<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) So MS.K. and H. V has 'Samuel'.</i> Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel did not differ on the question of a proselyte who was already circumcised or a child who was born circumcised. On what did they differ? On a child who was born circumcised on the Sabbath. Beth Shammai said: We override the Sabbath on his account to draw from him blood of the covenant, and Beth Hillel said that this is not necessary.<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) To set the Sabbath aside, and the blood should be drawn on another day. Both Schools agreed that it was necessary to draw the blood of the covenant.</i>"
Tractate Gerim.2.4,"<small>RULE 4</small>. If a slave underwent immersion before his master<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) A Gentile who was being made a convert.</i> he becomes free. It is related of Queen Valeria<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) [In Yeb. 46a (Sonc. ed., p. 299) 'Queen' is omitted. R.H. 17b (Sonc. ed., p. 70) mentions 'Valeria the proselyte'.] Some of her slaves became Jewesses while she was still a heathen.</i> that some of her slaves underwent immersion before her and some after her, and when the case came before the Sages they said that they who underwent immersion before her were free, but they who underwent immersion after her were still enslaved."
Tractate Gerim.2.5,"<small>RULE 5</small>. Just as Israel were initiated into the covenant by three precepts, so proselytes are initiated by circumcision, immersion and a sacrifice. [The omission of] the first two debars him [from becoming a proselyte], but [the omission of] the third does not debar him. R. Eliezer [b. Jacob] said: The omission of the sacrifice is also a bar.<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) Omitted by V but added by MS.K. and H. Cf. Kerith. 9a (Sonc. ed., p. 66).</i> This was the ruling of R. Eliezer b. Jacob: A proselyte who becomes a convert is required to set aside a fourth part [of a <i>dinar</i>] for his sacrifice of birds;<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) To be offered when the Temple will be rebuilt; Kerith. <i>loc. cit.</i> (Sonc. ed., p. 67, n. 12).</i> but R. Simeon says that he is not required to do so."
Tractate Gerim.2.6,"<small>RULE 6</small>. Proselytes are punished [for their sins before conversion] in the opinion of R. Jose; R. Judah said: He is not punished [61<i>a</i>] but is like a new-born child. R. Hanina b. Gamaliel said: Why are proselytes afflicted?<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) By God.</i> Because they calculate a year before or two years before [their conversion], saying, ['I shall become a proselyte] when I have collected my debts and when I have finished what I have to do'. R. Jose said to him,<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) 'R. Jose … him' added by MS.K. and H.</i> 'If they were to lose money [only as a punishment] you would be right; but they [sometimes] bury their children and grandchildren and sore diseases and chastisements befall them. Why are they afflicted? Because of their [transgression<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">(13) While they were still Gentiles.</i> of] the seven commandments which were given to the descendants of Noah'.<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">(14) [The practice of equity, and prohibitions against blasphemy, idolatry, immorality, bloodshed, robbery and eating a limb torn from a live animal; Sanh. 56a (Sonc. ed., pp. 381f.).]</i>"
Tractate Gerim.3.1,"<small>RULE 1</small>. What is a 'resident proselyte'?<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) Heb. <i>ger toshab</i> as distinguished from <i>ger zedeḳ</i>, 'a righteous proselyte'.</i> Whoever undertakes to abstain from idolatry, in the view of R. Meir; R. Judah said: Whoever undertakes not to eat flesh that has not been ritually slaughtered.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) According to 'A.Z. 64b (Sonc. ed., p. 314) a <i>ger toshab</i> is defined as one who undertook to keep all the commandments except the prohibition against eating flesh not ritually slaughtered, and perhaps that should be the reading here.</i>"
Tractate Gerim.3.2,"<small>RULE 2</small>. His spittle, his seat, his couch and his urine are unclean; his bread,<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) So MS.K. and H; V 'his dough'.</i> his oil and his wine are clean. The prohibitions <i>thou shalt not do him wrong</i>,<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) Lev. XIX, 33.</i> <i>thou shalt not oppress</i><sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) Deut. XXIV, 14.</i> and <i>the wages of a hired servant shall not abide with thee all night</i><sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) Lev. XIX, 13.</i> apply to him."
Tractate Gerim.3.3,"<small>RULE 3</small>. We do not marry him [to a Jewess] or take to wife women from him.<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) Those within the category of <i>ger toshab</i>.</i> We do not lend to him or borrow from him on interest."
Tractate Gerim.3.4,"<small>RULE 4</small>. We do not settle him on the frontier<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) [Where he would be exposed to attack, or by intercourse with foreign neighbours lapse into heathenism.]</i> or in an unhealthy district, but in a pleasant district in the centre of the Land of Israel,<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) The words 'in the centre of the Land of Israel' are superfluous and should perhaps be omitted.</i> where he can find scope for his occupation, as it is stated, <i>With thee he shall dwell in thy midst, in a place which he shall choose in one of thy gates, thou shalt not wrong him</i>.<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) Deut. XXIII, 17.</i>"
Tractate Gerim.3.5,"<small>RULE 5</small>. Every incestuous marriage which is forbidden to Israel under pain of death at the hands of a <i>Beth Din</i> is<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) So MS.K. V and H insert 'not'. [The question is debated in Sanh. 57b-58a (Sonc. ed., p. 393).]</i> forbidden to proselytes."
Tractate Gerim.3.6,"<small>RULE 6</small>. How is this? If he was married to the sister of his mother and her sister from the [same] mother, R. Meir says that he must dismiss her, but the Sages say that he may keep one of them.<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) This is the lit. rendering of V, which is hopelessly corrupt. MS.K. and H read: 'How is this? If he was married to the sister of his father from the same father or the sister of his father from the same mother, R. Meir says that he must dismiss her, but the Sages say that he may keep her. [If he has married] two sisters from the same mother, R. Meir says that he must dismiss both, but the Sages say that he must dismiss one of them'. The instance here adduced has nothing to do with the statement which precedes. In Sanh. <i>loc. cit.</i> it is adduced as an illustration of the statement that 'a proselyte whose conception was not in holiness, but whose birth was in holiness (i.e. after his mother's conversion) is forbidden to his mother's relatives but not to his father's'. In that case, however, we should certainly have to read here, 'if he had married his father's sister from the same father he may keep her, but if from the same mother, R. Meir says', etc.</i>"
Tractate Gerim.3.7,"<small>RULE 7</small>. An Israelite<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">(13) This is an obvious mistake for 'a Gentile'. [Cf. Sanh. 57b (Sonc. ed., p. 393) where it is explicitly stated.]</i> who has had intercourse with the daughter of a Gentile is to be tried according to the non-Jewish law, but a Gentile who has had intercourse with the daughter of an Israelite is to be tried according to Jewish law."
Tractate Gerim.3.8,"<small>RULE 8</small>. If a proselyte died leaving a son or daughter who became a convert with him, his property is ownerless<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">(14) [There is nothing in V corresponding to 'is ownerless' which is required by the context. MS.K. and H insert 'is like the deer', i.e. free, ownerless.]</i> and his slaves regain their freedom. If the slaves were minors<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">(15) [This is the reading suggested by N.Y.; V, MS.K. and H have 'shrewd'. This version agrees with Ḳid. 23a (Sonc. ed., p. 110): 'If a proselyte dies [without heirs] adult slaves acquire their freedom, but as for minors, whoever takes possession of them gains a title to them'.]</i> they are acquired by 'drawing',<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">(16) ['Taking possession by drawing towards one's self the object to be acquired' (Jastrow).]</i> because [the Sages] said that movable property is acquired by 'drawing' and immovable property by seizure.<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">(17) [This is the correct reading as against V's 'the Sages said that movable property is acquired by seizure'. Cf. Ḳid. I, 5 (Sonc. ed., p. 124). 'Movable property' is lit. 'property which has no security', i.e. on which a creditor cannot distrain if sold; 'immovable property', on the other hand, like real estate, can be mortgaged for the owner's debts.]</i>"
Tractate Gerim.3.9,"<small>RULE 9</small>. R. Eliezer said: [Immovable property] is acquired only by seizure; but if someone was walking in the field [of a proselyte who died] and a man came up to him to whom he said, 'The field is mine', the field is his; but the Sages say that he does not acquire the property until he has taken possession of it.<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">(18) [By performing some act such as levelling, etc. Cf. B.B. 100a (Sonc. ed., p. 418, n. 7).]</i>"
Tractate Gerim.3.10,"<small>RULE 10</small>. If one man comes from the south and another from the north, each one acquires the part which he traverses. This is the view of R. Eliezer; but the Sages said: Neither acquires until he has taken possession."
Tractate Gerim.3.11,"<small>RULE 11</small>. [If a proselyte died] while liable for his wife's <i>kethubah</i> and [the claim of] a creditor and she says, 'This part of the property belongs to me and this part is due to me under my <i>kethubah</i>', she is entitled [to the whole]. If she says, 'This part is due to me under my <i>kethubah</i> and this part belongs to me', she is entitled only to her <i>kethubah</i>."
Tractate Gerim.3.12,"<small>RULE 12</small>. Similarly, if a creditor says, 'This part belongs to me and that part is for my debt', he is entitled [to the whole]; but if he says, 'This part is for my debt and that part belongs to me', he is entitled only to his debt."
Tractate Gerim.3.13,"<small>RULE 13</small>. If he had slaves pasturing a flock<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">(19) Following the text of MS.K. and H.</i> and someone came and said, 'These slaves and the flock are mine', they are his; but if the slaves are shrewd they can say, 'We are free men and the flock belongs to us'.<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">(20) By declaring themselves freemen they can inherit their master's property.</i>"
Tractate Gerim.4.1,"<small>RULE 1</small>. <i>And a stranger</i> [<i>ger</i>] <i>shalt thou not wrong, neither shalt thou oppress him:</i><sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) Ex. XXII, 20.</i> you shall not <i>wrong</i> him in speech or <i>oppress</i> him in money dealings. Do not say to him,<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) What follows is according to MS.K. For Bel, etc., cf. Isa. XLVI, 1, <i>Bel boweth down</i> (<span dir=""rtl"">קרס</span>), <i>Nebo stoopeth</i>, alluding to Babylonian deities.</i> 'Yesterday you were worshipping Bel, Ḳores and Nebo, and till now pig's flesh was between your teeth, and now you stand up and speak with me!' And whence [do I learn] [not] to <i>wrong</i> him? He can retort, <i>For ye were strangers in the land of Egypt?</i><sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) Ex. <i>loc. cit.</i> [The more correct version is found in Mekilta <i>ad loc.</i>: 'If you wrong him he is able to wrong you? Therefore there is a saying, <i>For ye were strangers</i>, etc.'</i> Hence R. Nathan used to say: Do not taunt your neighbour with the blemish which you yourself have.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) [Cf. B.M. 59b (Sonc. ed.,p. 356).]</i>"
Tractate Gerim.4.2,"<small>RULE 2</small>. R. Eliezer b. Jacob said: Because [the proselyte's] original nature was evil,<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) [When he was a heathen, and ill-treatment by an Israelite may have the effect of making him relapse.]</i> Scripture gave many warnings in connection with him, as it is stated, <i>And a stranger shalt thou not wrong, neither shalt thou oppress him; for ye know the heart of a stranger</i>.<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) Ex. XXIII, 9.</i> Hence because his original nature was evil, Scripture gave many warnings concerning him."
Tractate Gerim.4.3,"<small>RULE 3</small>. Beloved are proselytes [by God], for [Scripture] everywhere uses the same epithets of them as of Israel; [61<i>b</i>] as it is stated, <i>But thou, Israel, My servant, Jacob whom I have chosen</i>.<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) Isa.
