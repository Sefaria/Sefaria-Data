Version Notes,
"Tractate Tefillin, Introduction.1","<small>THE NAME</small><br/><i>Tefillin</i>, 'phylacteries', is one of the 'Seven Minor Tractates' in the narrower sense (see Introduction to <i>Sefer Torah</i>). It is the plural of <i>tefillah</i>, a noun derived from the root TFL, 'to attach', which is similar to the Syriac TFLTA, meaning 'attachment, hanging'. They are so named on account of their being worn on the arm and on the head. Another proposed derivation is from PLL, 'to argue, prove', because they are evidence that the name of God is called upon Israel (cf. Deut. XXVIII, 10, Tosafoth Men. 33b <i>s.v. leṭoṭafoth</i>). A third suggested derivation is from the root PLA', 'separation, distinction'. The <i>tefillin</i> are a constant reminder that Israel must separate themselves from all evil thoughts and deeds."
"Tractate Tefillin, Introduction.2",<small>SHAPE AND CONTENTS OF THE <i>TEFILLIN</i></small>
"Tractate Tefillin, Introduction.3","A <i>tefillah</i> is made of leather, shaped into a quadrangular capsule with a base of thick skin, <i>tithura</i>, on one side of which is a hollow rim, <i>ma'barta</i>, through which a leather strap, <i>rezu'ah</i>, is passed. One <i>tefillah</i> is worn on the arm and the other on the head. Both must be black; but while the top and the sides of the hand-<i>tefillah</i> are smooth, those of the head-<i>tefillah</i> are grooved, being composed of four compartments with an ordinary letter <i>shin</i> on the right side and a specially formed <i>shin</i> with four heads on the left."
"Tractate Tefillin, Introduction.4","The middle of the strap of the head-<i>tefillah</i> is formed into a loop big enough to encircle the head, with the <i>tefillah</i> hanging from it above the forehead. At the back of the head the strap is made into a knot, shaped like the letter <i>daleth</i>, from which the two ends of the strap hang down in front of both shoulders and reaching below the waist (see the illustrations in J.E. X, pp. 22, 24)."
"Tractate Tefillin, Introduction.5","One end of the strap of the hand-<i>tefillah</i> is made into a noose with a knot representing the letter <i>yod</i>. The other is threaded through the <i>ma'barta</i> and then through the noose so that the knot adjoins the capsule while the loop is fastened round the left arm with the <i>tefillah</i> resting on the biceps facing the heart. The longer end of the strap is then wound seven times round the lower part of the left arm, ending with coils round the hand and two fingers, to represent the letters <i>shin</i> and <i>daleth</i> which, together with <i>the yod</i> mentioned, form the divine name <i>Shaddai</i>, 'Almighty'. The <i>shin</i> on the head-<i>tefillah</i>, the <i>daleth</i> knot at the back of the head and the <i>yod</i> knot of the hand-<i>tefillah</i> also constitute the same divine name. In each capsule four passages from Scripture, enumerated in the tractate, are inserted."
"Tractate Tefillin, Introduction.6",<small>ORIGIN OF THE PRECEPT</small>
"Tractate Tefillin, Introduction.7","The commandment of <i>tefillin</i> is derived from the following passages: <i>And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes</i> (Ex. XIII, 9). <i>And it shall be for a sign upon thy hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes</i> (<i>ibid.</i> 16). <i>And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes</i> (Deut. VI, 8). <i>And ye shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes</i> (<i>ibid.</i> XI, 18)."
"Tractate Tefillin, Introduction.8","Though Scripture does not specify <i>tefillin</i> in these verses, tradition from time immemorial interpreted the terms <i>sign, memorial</i> and <i>frontlets</i> as referring to the phylacteries. Many minutiae in the laws of <i>tefillin</i> are said to have been communicated to Moses on Mount Sinai. So familiar was the observance of the commandment that even the Mishnah (completed early in the third century <small>C.E.</small>) does not describe how it is to be performed. It is only from the Gemara and other oral traditions that the details are known."
"Tractate Tefillin, Introduction.9",<small>PURPOSE OF THE OBSERVANCE</small>
"Tractate Tefillin, Introduction.10","According to Scripture the commandment is a reminder of the deliverance from the slavery of Egypt. In Ex. XIII, 9, the precept is followed by the reason, <i>For with a strong hand hath the Lord brought thee out of Egypt</i>. To the commandment, <i>ibid.</i> 16, is added, <i>For by strength of hand the Lord brought us forth out of Egypt</i>. The reference in Deut. VI, 8, is followed by, <i>Beware lest thou forget the Lord, Who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage</i> (<i>ibid.</i> 12); and close to the commandment, in Deut. XI, 18 and preceding it, Scripture declares, <i>And know ye this day … His works which He did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh … and unto all His land</i> (<i>ibid.</i> 2f.)."
"Tractate Tefillin, Introduction.11","Another function of the <i>tefillin</i> is to be a reminder of God's selection of Israel to be His witnesses and to proclaim His Unity. The text, <i>And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the name of the Lord is called upon thee</i> (Deut. XXVIII, 10), is interpreted by R. Eliezer the Great as referring to the head-<i>tefillah</i> (Ber. 6a, Sonc. ed., p. 25)."
"Tractate Tefillin, Introduction.12",<small>THE TRACTATE</small>
"Tractate Tefillin, Introduction.13",Practically the entire contents of this tractate are devoted to the details relating to the commandment of <i>tefillin</i>. It deals with the materials and languages that may be used for <i>tefillin</i> scrolls; the shapes and the kind of damage which disqualify them for religious use; and who is and who is not subject to the obligation.
"Tractate Tefillin, Introduction.14","Advice is given in avoiding any disrespectful treatment of the <i>tefillin</i>, and on the remedies should such treatment occur. Guidance is given as to persons from whom they may be bought, and specific laws are laid down on the number of scrolls to be placed in each <i>tefillah</i>, the contents of the scrolls and the kind of capsules required."
"Tractate Tefillin, Introduction.15","It may be stated that there is a difference of opinion between Rashi and his grandson, Rabbenu Tam, on the interpretation of the law relating to the order in which the scrolls are to be placed (for details, cf. J.E., X, p. 23). Some pious Jews, therefore, put on two pairs so as to satisfy the views of the two authorities. That which accords with Rashi is put on first and the other towards the end of the morning service. In certain congregations both are worn simultaneously."
"Tractate Tefillin, Introduction.16","Rules are given in the tractate on the exact place of the head and the arm where the <i>tefillin</i> are to be worn; the times for their observance, excluding the Sabbath and Festivals; which of the two <i>tefillin</i> is to be put on and taken off first; the procedure in the absence of one <i>tefillah;</i> and which shape or covering causes them to be forbidden."
"Tractate Tefillin, Introduction.17",Direction is also provided in circumstances when sacred objects are found on the Sabbath; and where and when <i>tefillin</i> may be kept or worn; and a story is told in confirmation of the respect due to them. Emphasis is laid on the importance of the commandment of <i>tefillin</i> which is as great as the study of the Torah day and night. Its performance and the observance of the precepts of <i>mezuzah</i> and <i>zizith</i> endear Israel to God.
"Tractate Tefillin, Introduction.18",It should be noted that the tractate is not exhaustive and a number of rules relating to <i>tefillin</i> are not included but are to be found in the Talmud.
"Tractate Tefillin, Introduction.19",[In V the text is continuous. The division into paragraphs and their numbering are adopted from Higger's edition.]
"Tractate Tefillin, Introduction.20",I. W. SLOTKI.
"Tractate Tefillin, Tefillin.1","It is not permitted to write [the four scrolls of] <i>tefillin</i><sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) These are specified below. Cf. also the Introduction.</i> on skins of ritually unclean cattle or on skins of ritually unclean wild animals. It is permitted, however, to write them on skins of <i>nebeloth</i> and <i>ṭerefoth</i> and there is no need to consider the possibility of their having been pierced at the animal's heart.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) There was a heathen practice to remove the heart from an animal while it was still alive and offer it as a sacrifice. Rabbinic law regards such an animal as an idolatrous offering (cf. Mishnah 'A.Z. 29b, Sonc. ed., p. 145) and forbids its entire use, including the skin.</i>"
"Tractate Tefillin, Tefillin.2","If [<i>tefillin</i> scrolls] were perforated, they become unfit for religious use [if the hole occurred] in the written part; but if it occurred in the margin they remain fit. If the letter <i>waw</i> was shaped like a <i>zayin</i> or <i>vice versa</i>, straight-lined letters like curved ones<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) The final <i>kaf</i>, e.g., like an ordinary <i>kaf.</i></i> or <i>vice versa</i>, open letters closed<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) Such as an ordinary <i>mem</i> like a final <i>mem.</i></i> or <i>vice versa</i>, or if the shape of their letters had been altered [in any other way], or if they were written in [obsolete] Hebrew, or were made as a kind of amulet—they are unfit for religious use."
"Tractate Tefillin, Tefillin.3","Women, slaves and minors<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) Boys under thirteen years of age. On the exemption of women, cf. <i>Ẓizith</i> §1.</i> are exempt from [the commandment of] <i>tefillin</i>. A minor who knows how to take care of his <i>tefillin</i> is subject to the law of <i>tefillin</i>. It is related that Ṭabi, R. Gamaliel's slave, used to put on <i>tefillin;</i> Michal, Saul's daughter, used to put on <i>tefillin;</i> Jonah's wife used to make the festival pilgrimages<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) [For Ṭabi, cf. j.'Erub. X, I, 26a; for the two women, cf. 'Erub. 96a (Sonc. ed., p. 665).]</i> to Jerusalem.<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) Although the commandment applied only to males (cf. Ex. XXXIV, 23).</i>"
"Tractate Tefillin, Tefillin.4","[Regarding] the bearers of a bier [to the burial place] and those who relieve them<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) In carrying the bier.</i> and those who relieve the latter, whether in front of the bier or behind the bier<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) Who have not yet carried it or have done so respectively.</i>—all who are required [to carry] the bier are exempt<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) This is in disagreement with the ruling in the Mishnah (Ber. 17b, Sonc. ed., p. 106) where only those who are in front of the bier are exempt if they are required to carry it. Those behind are always liable even if their help is required, since they had already done their duty to the dead (cf. Rashi <i>ad loc.</i>).</i> [from putting on <i>tefillin</i>], but those who are not required for the bier are liable. When a halt is made for lamentations,<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) A number of such halts were made by those who returned from a burial to the mourner's house. (Cf. Semaḥoth X.]</i> those who are engaged in the lamentations are exempt, but those<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) In the back rows when they stand several deep.</i> who cannot see<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">(13) So in accordance with Ber. 19b (Sonc. ed., p. 117). V reads 'those who see'.</i> the inside [space between the rows]<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">(14) Where the mourner is.</i> are liable."
"Tractate Tefillin, Tefillin.5","If a person says [to another], 'Come and read [a Scriptural text] over my son because he is frightened', or 'Write, or place, upon him a [holy] scroll', or 'Put <i>tefillin</i> upon him that he may sleep',<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">(15) This is the reading in j.Shab. VI, 2, 8b. The text in V is corrupt.</i> he should not be listened to.<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">(16) Because sacred objects should not be used for such purposes. Cf. Sanh. 101a (Sonc. ed., p. 684, nn. 6f.).</i>"
"Tractate Tefillin, Tefillin.6","A <i>tefillah</i><sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">(17) V has the plural form.</i> is susceptible of ritual uncleanness. [If it becomes unclean, the priest] sprinkles upon it [the water of the red heifer]<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">(18) Cf. Num. XIX.</i> and repeats the process, and then immerses it [in a ritual bath]. R. Hanina b. Gamaliel says: It is necessary to unloose it.<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">(19) To remove the stitches that hold the parts of the capsule together, in order that the water may penetrate to all parts.</i> If [a <i>tefillah</i>] fell into water and remained there long enough [for the writing] to be washed away, it should be subjected to an examination.<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">(20) To make sure that the writing is still in a good condition or to repair it if necessary.</i>"
"Tractate Tefillin, Tefillin.7","Straps of <i>tefillin</i> may be bought anywhere.<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">(21) There is no need, as in the case with the <i>tefillin</i>, to buy them from a reliable person.</i> R. Simeon b. Gamaliel says: Any skin that had been used [for a secular] purpose is forbidden [to be used for the straps of <i>tefillin</i>].<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">(22) Hence they must be bought only from a reliable person who can guarantee that no previous use had been made of the skin.</i>"
"Tractate Tefillin, Tefillin.8","<i>Tefillin</i> may be bought only from a reliable person;<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">(23) One who can testify that they were prepared in accordance with the law.</i> and where there is no reliable person a pair of <i>tefillin</i> should be given [to an expert] who examines them. This does not mean that the seller gives him the scrolls, but that he himself chooses what he pleases and has them examined.<sup>24</sup><i class=""footnote"">(24) lit. 'that he takes for himself and he examines'.</i> If on examination the selected <i>tefillin</i> prove to be fit,<sup>25</sup><i class=""footnote"">(25) lit. 'he examined and found as proper'.</i> he may take all the batch without any scruples.<sup>26</sup><i class=""footnote"">(26) The fitness of the sample is assumed to represent the fitness of the whole batch.</i>"
"Tractate Tefillin, Tefillin.9","The [sections of the] head-<i>tefillah</i> are written on four separate scrolls<sup>27</sup><i class=""footnote"">(27) lit. 'sections'.</i> [beginning with] <i>Sanctify unto Me;</i><sup>28</sup><i class=""footnote"">(28) Ex. XIII, 1-10.</i> <i>And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee;</i><sup>29</sup><i class=""footnote"">(29) <i>ibid.</i> 11-16.</i> <i>Hear;</i><sup>30</sup><i class=""footnote"">(30) Deut. VI, 4-9.</i> <i>And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken</i>.<sup>31</sup><i class=""footnote"">(31) <i>ibid.</i> XI, 13-21.</i> So also with the hand-<i>tefillah</i>, except that [all the four sections] are written in one scroll.<sup>32</sup><i class=""footnote"">(32) lit. 'he makes one section'.</i> If one wrote them in four separate scrolls [the <i>tefillah</i>] is fit for religious use. R. Judah says: They should be sewn together and put into one capsule.<sup>33</sup><i class=""footnote"">(33) Unlike the head-<i>tefillah</i>, which consists of four compartments joined together to form one capsule.</i> R. Judah, however, admits that if two <i>tefillin</i><sup>34</sup><i class=""footnote"">(34) lit. 'both of them'.</i> were [like] the head-<i>tefillah</i>, one may wrap one of them in a piece of leather and so convert it into a hand-<i>tefillah</i>."
"Tractate Tefillin, Tefillin.10","The hand-<i>tefillah</i> is put on the upper part of the hand<sup>35</sup><i class=""footnote"">(35) The biceps, and not on the palm of the hand.</i> [because Scripture declares, <i>And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand</i>,<sup>36</sup><i class=""footnote"">(36) Ex. XIII, 9.</i> which means that the sign shall be for thee<sup>37</sup><i class=""footnote"">(37) Where only he who wears the <i>tefillah</i> can see it, i.e. on the biceps covered by the sleeve.</i> but not for others<sup>38</sup><i class=""footnote"">(38) Had the <i>tefillah</i> been put on the palm of the hand it would be visible to all.</i>]. <sup>39</sup><i class=""footnote"">(39) The part enclosed in square brackets is based on Men. 37b (Sonc. ed., p. 229).</i>So also [the Scriptural expression] <i>between thine eyes</i><sup>40</sup><i class=""footnote"">(40) Ex. XIII, 9.</i> [implies] the upper part of the head, [because] <i>upon thy hand</i> and <i>between thine eyes</i> [occur in juxtaposition we infer]: as <i>upon thy hand</i> [means] on the upper part of the hand, so <i>between thine eyes</i> [means] on the upper part of the head. This is according to R. Eliezer b. Jacob; R. Judah says: It is stated <i>upon thy hand</i> and it is also stated [in the same verse] <i>between thine eyes</i> [the inference being that] as <i>upon thy hand</i> [refers to] a place that is susceptible of ritual uncleanness by one [symptom of] leprosy,<sup>41</sup><i class=""footnote"">(41) The biceps, like any other part of the body that is free from hair, is declared ritually unclean by one symptom only, viz. white hair in the leprous spot.</i> so also <i>between thine eyes</i> [refers to] a place that is susceptible of ritual uncleanness by one [symptom of] leprosy.<sup>42</sup><i class=""footnote"">(42) Viz. the upper part of the head, whose symptom of uncleanness is yellow hair in the leprous spot. The region between the eyes, however, where both hair and clean flesh are to be found, can be declared unclean by either of the two symptoms (yellow or white hair) and must therefore be ruled out.</i> [Another reason:] It is stated <i>between thine eyes</i> and it is also stated, <i>Nor make any baldness between your eyes:</i><sup>43</sup><i class=""footnote"">(43) Deut. XIV, 1.</i> as baldness occurs where there is hair [on the head] so you must put the <i>tefillah</i> only where there is hair [on the hand].<sup>44</sup><i class=""footnote"">(44) Since both verses contain the expression <i>between … eyes</i>.</i> It is stated, <i>And thou shalt write them</i><sup>45</sup><i class=""footnote"">(45) Referring to the <i>mezuzah</i> (Deut. VI, 9).</i> and it is also stated [in juxtaposition] <i>and thou shalt bind them;</i><sup>46</sup><i class=""footnote"">(46) The <i>tefillin</i> (<i>ibid.</i> 8).</i> [hence the inference that] the hand that writes [the <i>mezuzah</i>]<sup>47</sup><i class=""footnote"">(47) i.e. the right hand, with which most people write.</i> is the hand that binds [the <i>tefillah</i>].<sup>48</sup><i class=""footnote"">(48) The hand-<i>tefillah</i> is therefore put on the left hand.</i>"
"Tractate Tefillin, Tefillin.11","The commandment of [wearing] <i>tefillin</i> is from dawn until evening. If a person sleeps in the day-time he need not trouble to remove his <i>tefillin</i>. If a man rises early to go on a journey, he should not put them on before the time [for the performance] of the commandment; but if he had put them on before [the proper time for the performance of] the commandment, he should place his hand upon them at the time [for the performance] of the commandment<sup>49</sup><i class=""footnote"">(49) At dawn.</i> and say the benedictions."
"Tractate Tefillin, Tefillin.12","[Absence of] the hand-<i>tefillah</i> does not prevent the religious use of the head-<i>tefillah</i>, neither does [the absence of] the head-<i>tefillah</i> prevent the religious use of the hand-<i>tefillah</i>.<sup>50</sup><i class=""footnote"">(50) Each <i>tefillah</i> is independent of the other.</i> If a man inverted a <i>tefillah</i> capsule<sup>51</sup><i class=""footnote"">(51) When it is on his hand or head.</i> he has not fulfilled his religious duty."
"Tractate Tefillin, Tefillin.13","When a man puts on [the <i>tefillin</i>], he should put on that of the hand first; and when he takes them off, he should take off that of the head first. A similar rule applies in the case of sandals, viz. when he puts them on, he should put on that of the right foot first, and when he takes them off, he should take off that of the left foot first.<sup>52</sup><i class=""footnote"">(52) [Cf. DER. X, 1.]</i> Likewise, any [dish] that is served last<sup>53</sup><i class=""footnote"">(53) Another and better reading is 'first'.</i> is removed first, except bread.<sup>54</sup><i class=""footnote"">(54) Which must remain on the table until the Grace after meals had been recited (cf. Sanh. 92a, Sonc. ed., p. 617).</i>"
"Tractate Tefillin, Tefillin.14","If a man makes his head-[<i>tefillah</i>] round, this is a dangerous practice<sup>55</sup><i class=""footnote"">(55) Because an accidental blow on it might split one's head. Cf. Meg. 24b (Sonc. ed., p. 148, n. 2).</i> which does not carry with it [the fulfilment of] the commandment.<sup>56</sup><i class=""footnote"">(56) The commandment being that it must be cube-shaped and flat at the base.</i> To put [the head-<i>tefillah</i>] on one's forehead or [the hand-<i>tefillah</i>] on the palm of one's hand<sup>57</sup><i class=""footnote"">(57) In accordance with the literal meaning of the verse, <i>And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes</i> (Deut. VI, 8), which is contrary to the traditional interpretation.</i> is in the manner of heresy.<sup>58</sup><i class=""footnote"">(58) Heb. <i>minuth</i>, used especially of the views and practices of the early Jewish-Christians. According to Maimonides the <i>minim</i> were Sadducees.</i> To overlay them with gold or put [that of the hand] on one's <i>neḳlah</i>, which means a sleeve, is the manner of the outsiders.<sup>59</sup><i class=""footnote"">(59) Persons who follow their own interpretation of Scripture and not that of the Rabbis. [On this paragraph, cf. J. Rabbinowitz, <i>Mishnah Megillah</i>, pp. 128f.]</i> [63<i>a</i>]"
"Tractate Tefillin, Tefillin.15","<i>Tefillin</i> may be moved within a house [even on the Sabbath].<sup>60</sup><i class=""footnote"">(60) They are not regarded as articles forbidden to be handled on the Sabbath or Festival, although not worn on the holy days.</i> If [on the Sabbath day] a man finds <i>tefillin</i> in a public domain,<sup>61</sup><i class=""footnote"">(61) Where they may be trodden upon.</i> he should carry them [into a safe place] one pair at a time.<sup>62</sup><i class=""footnote"">(62) The hand-<i>tefillah</i> on his arm and the head-<i>tefillah</i> on his head in the same manner as they are worn on week-days.</i> R. Gamaliel says: Two pairs at a time.<sup>63</sup><i class=""footnote"">(63) As there is sufficient room on the arm and on the head for two sets, he may put two hand-<i>tefillin</i> on his arm and two head-<i>tefillin</i> on his head.</i> [This rule applies to] both men and women,<sup>64</sup><i class=""footnote"">(64) Although the latter are exempt from the commandment of <i>tefillin</i>.</i> to new <i>tefillin</i> and to old. R. Judah says: [This procedure] is permitted with old <i>tefillin</i><sup>65</sup><i class=""footnote"">(65) Which show marks of wear or have a proper knot, so that there can be no doubt that they were genuine <i>tefillin</i>.</i> but forbidden with new.<sup>66</sup><i class=""footnote"">(66) Since they may be only amulets.</i>"
"Tractate Tefillin, Tefillin.16","If a man finds a [Torah] scroll or a bundle of <i>tefillin</i>,<sup>67</sup><i class=""footnote"">(67) In a public domain where they may be trodden upon.</i> he should pass them on to his fellow, and his fellow should pass them on to his fellow on the Sabbath,<sup>68</sup><i class=""footnote"">(68) Each one carrying them a lesser distance than four cubits. Carrying an article a longer distance in a public domain is forbidden on the Sabbath.</i> even though they be a hundred persons. If [there is no other person]<sup>69</sup><i class=""footnote"">(69) The words in square brackets are missing in V but inserted by H.</i> with him, he<sup>70</sup><i class=""footnote"">(70) lit. 'one [man]'.</i> should take them up [while standing] within four cubits [distance from them] and remove them to [the next point] within four cubits [distance from the first point];<sup>71</sup><i class=""footnote"">(71) And so on, until he reaches a place where they can be properly deposited.</i> because R. Simeon said: Any prohibition<sup>72</sup><i class=""footnote"">(72) Read <i>'issur</i> with H instead of <i>'omed</i> (standing) in V.</i> imposed by a Rabbinical Court<sup>73</sup><i class=""footnote"">(73) Such as the prohibition to carry objects in a public domain even within a distance of four cubits.</i> does not apply to holy writings.<sup>74</sup><i class=""footnote"">(74) Consequently it is permitted on the Sabbath to carry a Torah scroll or <i>tefillin</i> to a place of safety, provided all the stages between the points of taking up and setting down are each less than four cubits in length.</i>"
"Tractate Tefillin, Tefillin.17","If a man is in a school house or in a House of Study,<sup>75</sup><i class=""footnote"">(75) Places in which the <i>tefillin</i> would not be sufficiently protected if left there.</i> [or] in a privy or a bath-house,<sup>76</sup><i class=""footnote"">(76) It would be disrespectful for the <i>tefillin</i> to be left there.</i> and forgot to remove his <i>tefillin</i>,<sup>77</sup><i class=""footnote"">(77) Before the Sabbath had commenced, or before he entered the two last-mentioned places.</i> he should cover them with his hair<sup>78</sup><i class=""footnote"">(78) So as not to be seen wearing <i>tefillin</i> on the Sabbath in public.</i> and leave the place.<sup>79</sup><i class=""footnote"">(79) Taking them off when he reaches his home.</i> If he is unable to do so, he should proceed to a near-by house where he takes them off.<sup>80</sup><i class=""footnote"">(80) Leaving them there until the termination of the Sabbath.</i>"
"Tractate Tefillin, Tefillin.18","[<i>Tefillin</i>] may be put into a money-bag even when there is money in it. They may also be suspended from the legs of a bed; but if another person<sup>81</sup><i class=""footnote"">(81) A variant reading is: 'if his wife be with him'.</i> be with him [in bed] it is forbidden. They must not be placed under one's head;<sup>82</sup><i class=""footnote"">(82) To sleep on them; and much more so under any other part of the body.</i> but if thereby they are protected<sup>83</sup><i class=""footnote"">(83) From thieves or disrespectful treatment.</i> it is permitted."
"Tractate Tefillin, Tefillin.19","If a man carried a heavy load<sup>84</sup><i class=""footnote"">(84) [This and the following regulations applied at the time when the <i>tefillin</i> were worn throughout the day and not, as now, only during the morning prayers.]</i> and was perspiring, he need not trouble to remove his <i>tefillin</i>. A potter should remove the hand-<i>tefillah</i> but wear the head-<i>tefillah</i>.<sup>85</sup><i class=""footnote"">(85) Since his work requires the use of his hands only.</i> A baker should remove the head-<i>tefillah</i><sup>86</sup><i class=""footnote"">(86) Otherwise the heat of the oven might damage it.</i> and wear the hand-<i>tefillah;</i><sup>87</sup><i class=""footnote"">(87) Using his right hand for the baking.</i> but if he uses both hands in baking he also takes off the hand-<i>tefillah</i>."
"Tractate Tefillin, Tefillin.20","[Regarding a bath-house], if a man is about to enter the room where persons are undressed, he removes his <i>tefillin</i> at a distance of four cubits from the nude persons. If some are undressed and others dressed, he does not remove his <i>tefillin</i> but should not put them on at the outset.<sup>88</sup><i class=""footnote"">(88) So according to H.

"Tractate Tefillin, Tefillin.21","If a person is about to enter a tannery,<sup>89</sup><i class=""footnote"">(89) Where there are unpleasant smells.</i> a pond [enclosure]<sup>90</sup><i class=""footnote"">(90) For steeping flax or similar things.</i> or a wash-house, he removes his <i>tefillin</i> at a distance of four cubits. If a person is about to enter a privy, he removes the <i>tefillin</i> at a distance of four cubits. If it was a superior bathing-place,<sup>91</sup><i class=""footnote"">(91) [Cf. Tamid I, 1, Sonc. ed., p. 2, where the Temple was said to have 'a superior privy', its superiority being that it could be locked to prevent intrusion.]</i> one does not remove the <i>tefillin</i> before he reaches it."
"Tractate Tefillin, Tefillin.22","It once happened that R. Eliezer went to Ubelin<sup>92</sup><i class=""footnote"">(92) Or, 'Obelin'. There was a village of that name near Jaffa in S. Palestine, and one near Sepphoris in Galilee. A visit by R. Eliezer to Obelin is mentioned in 'Erub. 11b-12a (Sonc. ed., pp. 71f.).</i> [where he stayed] with a certain house-owner. It was a practice there to bathe in a cave. When R. Eliezer took his clothes off and removed his <i>tefillin</i>,<sup>93</sup><i class=""footnote"">(93) To bathe in one of the caves.</i> [the host] said to him, 'Rabbi, is not the water of that cave better than that of this one?' And although there was only a distance of four cubits between the one and the other, R. Eliezer dressed and put on his <i>tefillin</i>,<sup>94</sup><i class=""footnote"">(94) To walk to the other cave.</i> because he never walked four cubits without <i>tefillin</i>. In this manner did R. Eliezer make the commandment of <i>tefillin</i> a permanent practice."
"Tractate Tefillin, Tefillin.23","Thus used R. Eliezer to say: Great is the commandment of <i>tefillin</i>, for the Holy One, blessed be He, spoke as follows to Israel, <i>But thou shalt meditate therein day and night</i>.<sup>95</sup><i class=""footnote"">(95) Josh. I, 8.</i> 'Sovereign of the universe,' said Israel to the Holy One, blessed be He, 'is it possible for us to meditate day and night [in the Torah]?' The Holy One, blessed be He, answered them, 'My children, put <i>tefillin</i> on your heads and on your arms and I shall account it to you as if you meditated in the Torah day and night'; as it is stated, <i>And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the law of the Lord may be in thy mouth</i>.<sup>96</sup><i class=""footnote"">(96) Ex.

"Tractate Tefillin, Tefillin.24","Beloved are Israel [by God], for they observe all the commandments that are in the Torah. How? <i>Tefillin</i> on their hands, <i>tefillin</i> on their heads, a <i>mezuzah</i> on their doors and four <i>zizith</i> on their garments. Concerning them David, king of Israel, said, <i>Seven times a day do I praise Thee, because of Thy righteous ordinances</i>.<sup>97</sup><i class=""footnote"">(97) Ps. CXIX, 164.</i>"
"Tractate Tefillin, Tefillin.25","[The Sages] illustrated this with a parable. To what may this be compared? To a king who said to his wife, 'Be well dressed and adorned in my presence'. 'For what reason?' she asked him. 'In order that you may be acceptable to me,' he replied. Similarly the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, 'My children, be well dressed and adorned in My presence with [your performance of] the commandments'. 'For what reason?' they asked Him. 'In order,' He replied, 'that you may be acceptable to Me'; as it is stated, <i>Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah</i>,<sup>98</sup><i class=""footnote"">(98) Cant.
