Version Notes,
"PERE&#x1E32; HASHSHALOM, Introduction.1","In the edition of the Wilna Talmud, <i>Derek ’Ereẓ Zuṭa</i> consists of eleven chapters, the last being entitled <i>Pereḳ Hashshalom</i>. It is, however, not part of that tractate but a separate collection of dicta on the theme of Peace."
"PERE&#x1E32; HASHSHALOM, Introduction.2","The probability is that it was appended to the tractate because it concludes with a description of the state of degeneracy which will precede the coming of the Messiah, whose advent will bring abiding peace to the world. Or it was attached to chap. IX, originally the end of the tractate, which touches on the blessings of peace."

"PERE&#x1E32; HASHSHALOM, Pereḳ Hashshalom.1","R. Joshua b. Levi said: Great is peace, for peace is to the world as leaven is to dough. Had not the Holy One, blessed be He, given peace to the earth, the sword and the beast would have robbed the world<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) So H; V reads ‘man’.</i> of its children. Whence<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) So GRA; V reads ‘why is it written?’</i> [do we know this]? From what is written, <i>And I will give peace in the land … and I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land;</i><sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) Lev. 26, 6. The Heb. for <i>earth</i> and <i>land</i> is the same.</i> and <i>land</i> means nothing else than Israel, as it is stated, <i>And all nations shall call you happy; for ye shall be a delightsome land</i>.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) Mal. 3, 12. The identification of <i>land</i> with Israel is here evident. V and H add: ‘And it states, <i>And, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest</i>’.</i> [And so Solomon declared,] <i>One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh; and the earth abideth for ever</i>:<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) Eccl. 1, 4.</i> Solomon said:<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) So GRA. V reads: ‘A kingdom comes and a kingdom goes, but Israel endures for ever. But Solomon, although’.</i> Although a generation passes away and another generation comes, one kingdom goes and another kingdom comes, one decree passes away and a new decree is imposed upon Israel,<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) lit. ‘upon the enemies of Israel’, a euphemism.</i> <i>the earth abideth for ever</i>, i.e. Israel will abide for ever,<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) <i>Earth</i> refers to Israel. [Cf. Midrash <i>ad loc.</i>, Sonc. ed., p. 15.]</i> they are not forsaken nor will they be forsaken, they are not destroyed nor will they be destroyed, as it is stated, <i>For I the Lord change not; and ye, O sons of Jacob are not consumed</i><sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) Mal. 3, 6.</i>—as I have not changed nor will I change, so you, the House of Jacob, are not destroyed and will not be destroyed, but [as it is stated], <i>But ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God are alive every one of you this day</i>.<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) Deut. 4, 4.</i>"
"PERE&#x1E32; HASHSHALOM, Pereḳ Hashshalom.2","There<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) In Babylon.</i> they taught: Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel used to say: By three things does the world endure: justice, truth and peace.<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) Cf. Aboth I, 18 (Sonc. ed., p. 10).</i> R. Muna said: The three are one, because if justice is done, truth has been effected and peace brought about; and all three are mentioned in one verse, as it is stated, <i>Execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates</i>,<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">(13) Zech. 8, 16.</i> [indicating that] wherever justice is done peace is to be found."
"PERE&#x1E32; HASHSHALOM, Pereḳ Hashshalom.3","R. Joshua said: Great is peace, for when Israel stood [at Sinai] and declared, <i>All that the Lord hath spoken we will do, and obey</i>,<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">(14) Ex. 24, 7.</i> [59<i>b</i>] the Holy One, blessed be He, rejoiced in them and gave them His Torah and blessed them with peace, as it is stated, <i>The Lord will give strength</i><sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">(15) Here taken as a synonym of Torah.</i> <i>unto His people; the Lord will bless His people with peace</i>.<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">(16) Ps. 29, 11.</i>"
"PERE&#x1E32; HASHSHALOM, Pereḳ Hashshalom.4","Hezekiah said: Great is peace, for in connection with all other precepts in the Torah it is written, <i>If thou see</i>,<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">(17) Ex. 23, 5.</i> etc., <i>If thou meet</i>,<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">(18) <i>ibid.</i> 4.</i> <i>If there chance</i>,<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">(19) Deut. 22, 6.</i> <i>If thou buildest</i>,<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">(20) <i>ibid.</i> 8, E.V. <i>when thou buildest</i>.</i> [implying,] if a precept comes to your hand, you are bound to perform it;<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">(21) But if not, you are not bound to perform it.</i> but what is written in connection with peace? <i>Seek peace, and pursue it</i>,<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">(22) Ps. 34, 15.</i> [meaning,] seek it in your place and follow it to another place.<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">(23) If your presence can help to bring about peace there.</i>"
"PERE&#x1E32; HASHSHALOM, Pereḳ Hashshalom.5","Hezekiah said: Great is peace, for with regard to all the journeyings [of Israel] it is written, <i>And they journeyed … and they pitched</i>,<sup>24</sup><i class=""footnote"">(24) Num. 33, 5 ff.</i> [the plural number implying that] they journeyed in dissension and encamped in dissension. When, however, they came to Mount Sinai, they all became one encampment, [as it is stated,] <i>And there Israel encamped</i><sup>25</sup><i class=""footnote"">(25) The verb is singular in the Heb.</i> <i>before the mount</i>.<sup>26</sup><i class=""footnote"">(26) Ex. 19, 2.</i> The Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘Since Israel hate dissension and love peace and became one encampment, this is the time when I will give them My Torah’.
Adonijah was slain only because he was a quarrelsome person,<sup>27</sup><i class=""footnote"">(27) Although the kingdom was promised by David to Solomon, Adonijah tried to usurp it, knowing that it would cause strife and bloodshed.</i> and it is permissible to slander a quarrelsome person; for thus did Nathan the prophet say to Bathsheba, <i>I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words</i>.<sup>28</sup><i class=""footnote"">(28) 1 Kings 1, 14.</i> And Rabbi [Judah the Prince] said: All falsehoods are prohibited, but it is permissible to utter a falsehood for the purpose of making peace between a man and his fellow.<sup>28a</sup><i class=""footnote"">(28a) [Cf. the procedure adopted by Aaron, below §18, ARN XII, p. 71ff.]</i>"
"PERE&#x1E32; HASHSHALOM, Pereḳ Hashshalom.6","Bar Ḳappara said: Great is peace, for we find that the Torah modified a statement in order to maintain peace between Abraham and Sarah. It is stated, <i>And Sarah laughed within herself, saying … my lord being old</i>;<sup>29</sup><i class=""footnote"">(29) Gen. 18, 12.</i> but in the sequel<sup>30</sup><i class=""footnote"">(30) When God repeated this to Abraham.</i> it is written, <i>I who am old</i>.<sup>31</sup><i class=""footnote"">(31) <i>ibid.</i> 13. God concealed from Abraham that Sarah called him ‘an old man’.</i>"
"PERE&#x1E32; HASHSHALOM, Pereḳ Hashshalom.7","Bar Ḳappara said: Great is peace, for we find that in the prophets, too, Scripture modified a statement for the purpose of maintaining peace between Manoaḥ and his wife. At first<sup>32</sup><i class=""footnote"">(32) When the angel spoke to Manoaḥ’s wife.</i> it is written, <i>Behold, now, thou art barren … but thou shalt conceive and bear a son;</i><sup>33</sup><i class=""footnote"">(33) Judg. 13, 3.</i> but in the sequel<sup>34</sup><i class=""footnote"">(34) When she reported her encounter with the angel to her husband.</i> it is written, <i>Behold thou shalt conceive and bear a son</i>,<sup>35</sup><i class=""footnote"">(35) <i>ibid.</i> 7.</i> and there is no mention of the words <i>behold thou art barren</i>."
"PERE&#x1E32; HASHSHALOM, Pereḳ Hashshalom.8","Bar Ḳappara said: Great is peace, for even the angels among whom there is no enmity, jealousy, hatred, strife, rivalry or dissension [have need for] the Holy One, blessed be He, to make peace among them; as it is stated,<sup>36</sup><i class=""footnote"">(36) The emended text of GRA is followed.</i> <i>Dominion and fear are with Him; He maketh peace in His high places</i><sup>37</sup><i class=""footnote"">(37) Job 25, 2.</i>—<i>dominion</i> alludes to Michael and <i>fear</i> to Gabriel, one being of fire and the other of water<sup>38</sup><i class=""footnote"">(38) Cf. Midrash Rabbah, Numbers, XII, 8 (Sonc. ed., p. 472), where Gabriel is said to be made of fire and Michael of snow.</i> and yet they do not injure one another;<sup>39</sup><i class=""footnote"">(39) Because God makes peace between them.</i> how much more so then do mortal beings, among whom all these dispositions exist, [have need of peace] !"
"PERE&#x1E32; HASHSHALOM, Pereḳ Hashshalom.9","R. Ishmael said: Great is peace, for we find that the Holy One, blessed be He, permitted His Name, though written in holiness, to be blotted out in water,<sup>40</sup><i class=""footnote"">(40) Cf. Num. 5, 6ff., especially verse 23.</i> for the purpose of restoring peace between husband and wife."
"PERE&#x1E32; HASHSHALOM, Pereḳ Hashshalom.10","R. Joshua said: Great is peace, for the covenant with the priests was made with [the word] ‘peace’, as it is stated, <i>Behold, I give unto him My covenant of peace</i>.<sup>41</sup><i class=""footnote"">(41) <i>ibid.</i> XXV, 12.</i>"
"PERE&#x1E32; HASHSHALOM, Pereḳ Hashshalom.11","R. Joshua said: Great is peace, for the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, is called ‘peace’, as it is stated, <i>And he called it</i><sup>42</sup><i class=""footnote"">(42) The altar erected by Gideon.</i> <i>‘Adonai-shalom’</i>.<sup>43</sup><i class=""footnote"">(43) Judg. 6, 24, i.e. ‘the Lord is peace’; cf. Shab. 10b (Sonc. ed., p. 37) and Midrash Rabbah, Leviticus, IX, 9 (Sonc. ed., p. 117) where the rendering is ‘And he called Him Lord, Peace’, which is described in n. 1 as ‘a very bold Midrashic rendering’.</i> <sup>44</sup><i class=""footnote"">(44) This sentence is omitted by GRA.</i>R. Ḥiyya b. Abba said: Hence it can be deduced that a person may not extend a greeting of peace to his fellow in a place of filth, because it is stated, <i>And Gideon built an altar there unto the Lord and called it ‘Adonai-shalom’</i>. Now if an altar which does not eat, drink or smell and was erected only to make an atonement for [the sins of] Israel is called ‘peace’, he who loves peace and pursues peace, who welcomes people with the greeting of peace<sup>45</sup><i class=""footnote"">(45) lit. ‘who is first with [the greeting of] ‘Peace [upon you]’; cf. Ber. 17a (Sonc. ed., p. 102) where it is reported by Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai that never did anyone anticipate him with the salutation of peace, not even a heathen in the market-place.</i> and responds with peace, and who maintains peace between Israel and their Father in heaven, how much more so! R. Jose the Galilean said: Even the name of the Messiah is called ‘peace’, [as it is stated,] <i>And his name is called … Abi-ad-sar-shalom</i>.<sup>46</sup><i class=""footnote"">(46) Isa. 9, 5, i.e. ‘the Everlasting Father, the Ruler of peace’.</i>"
"PERE&#x1E32; HASHSHALOM, Pereḳ Hashshalom.12","R. Joshua said: Great is peace, for [the children of] Israel are called ‘peace’, as it is stated, <i>For as the seed of peace, the vine shall give her fruit</i>.<sup>47</sup><i class=""footnote"">(47) Zech. 8, 12.</i> To whom will peace [be given]? To <i>the seed of peace</i>."
"PERE&#x1E32; HASHSHALOM, Pereḳ Hashshalom.13","R. Jose the Galilean said: Great is peace, seeing that when king Messiah will reveal himself to Israel, his first message will be peace, as it is stated, <i>How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger of good tidings, that announceth peace</i>.<sup>48</sup><i class=""footnote"">(48) Isa. 52, 7.</i>"
"PERE&#x1E32; HASHSHALOM, Pereḳ Hashshalom.14","R. Jose the Galilean said: Great is peace, since even in a time of war one should begin [by attempting to arrange] peace, as it is stated, <i>When thou drawest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it</i>.<sup>49</sup><i class=""footnote"">(49) Deut. 20, 10.</i>"
"PERE&#x1E32; HASHSHALOM, Pereḳ Hashshalom.15","R. Joshua said: Great is peace, since the Holy One, blessed be He, will in the hereafter support the righteous with peace, as it is stated, <i>The mind stayed on Thee Thou keepest in perfect peace</i>.<sup>50</sup><i class=""footnote"">(50) Isa. 26, 3. The preceding verse speaks of <i>the righteous nation</i>.</i>"
"PERE&#x1E32; HASHSHALOM, Pereḳ Hashshalom.16","R. Joshua said: Great is peace, for it is given [as a blessing] to the living and the dead. Whence to the living? [As it is stated,] <i>And Jethro said to Moses: ‘Go in peace’</i>.<sup>51</sup><i class=""footnote"">(51) Ex. 4, 18.</i> And whence to the dead? [As it is stated,] <i>But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace</i>.<sup>52</sup><i class=""footnote"">(52) Gen. 15, 15.</i>"
"PERE&#x1E32; HASHSHALOM, Pereḳ Hashshalom.17","Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel said: Great is peace, for we find that the tribes<sup>53</sup><i class=""footnote"">(53) i.e. the sons of Jacob.</i> reported an untrue statement in order to maintain peace between Joseph and his brethren; as it is stated, <i>And they sent a message unto Joseph, saying: Thy father did command before he died, saying: So shall ye say unto Joseph: Forgive, I pray thee now, the transgression of thy brethren and their sin</i>,<sup>54</sup><i class=""footnote"">(54) <i>ibid.</i> L, 16.</i> but we do not find that [Jacob] had given them any such command.<sup>55</sup><i class=""footnote"">(55) Cf. Yeb. 65b (Sonc. ed., p. 437).</i>"
"PERE&#x1E32; HASHSHALOM, Pereḳ Hashshalom.18","Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel said: Great is peace, for Aaron the [High] Priest was praised only for peace; for he loved peace, pursued peace, greeted with the salutation of peace and responded with it, as it is stated, <i>He walked with Me in peace and uprightness</i>.<sup>56</sup><i class=""footnote"">(56) Mal. 2, 6.</i> It teaches that when he noticed two persons at enmity one with the other, he used to go first to one of them and say to him, ‘Why do you hate So-and-so? He has already come to my house, prostrated himself before me and said to me, “I sinned against So-and-so”. Go and pacify him’. When he left this one, he went to the other and spoke to him similarly, and so made peace, love and friendship between a man and his fellow. What is written subsequently? <i>For he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts</i>.<sup>57</sup><i class=""footnote"">(57) <i>ibid.</i> 7. The text of GRA has been followed. [Cf. above, p. 599.]</i>
R. Joshua said: The prophet is called ‘messenger [of the Lord]’ and the priest<sup>58</sup><i class=""footnote"">(58) So GRA. V and H read ‘a Sage’.</i> is called ‘messenger [of the Lord]’. The prophet is called ‘messenger [of the Lord]’, as it is stated, <i>Then spoke Haggai the Lord’s messenger;</i><sup>59</sup><i class=""footnote"">(59) Hag. 1, 13.</i> and the priest is called ‘messenger [of the Lord]’, as it is stated, <i>For he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts</i>.<sup>60</sup><i class=""footnote"">(60) Mal. 2, 7.</i> Lest you think that this applies even to a priest who is an <i>‘am ha-’areẓ</i>, the text declares, <i>And they should seek the law at his mouth</i>.<sup>61</sup><i class=""footnote"">(61) <i>ibid.</i></i>"
"PERE&#x1E32; HASHSHALOM, Pereḳ Hashshalom.19","R. Joshua of Siknin said in the name of R. Levi: Great is peace, for all benedictions and prayers conclude with ‘peace’. In the case of the benedictions of the <i>Shema‘</i><sup>62</sup><i class=""footnote"">(62) In the morning service two benedictions precede the <i>Shema‘</i> and one benediction follows it; in the evening service two precede and two follow it (P.B., pp. 37ff., 96).</i> one concludes with ‘peace’: ‘[Blessed art Thou, O Lord,] Who spreadest the tabernacle of peace’;<sup>63</sup><i class=""footnote"">(63) The conclusion of the second benediction after the <i>Shema‘</i> in the evening services on Sabbaths and Festivals (P.B., p. 114).</i> in the case of prayers<sup>64</sup><i class=""footnote"">(64) i.e. the <i>‘Amidah</i> (P.B., pp. 44-54).</i> one concludes with ‘peace’: ‘[Blessed art Thou, O Lord,] Who makest peace’.<sup>65</sup><i class=""footnote"">(65) P.B., p. 54, where this formula is now used only during the penitential season, though originally said on all occasions. V and H include, but GRA deletes, ‘The benediction of the <i>kohanim</i> concludes with “peace” in <i>and give them peace</i> (Num. 6, 26)’.</i>"
PERE&#x1E32; HASHSHALOM.1,"R. Joshua b. Levi said: The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, ‘You have brought about the destruction of My Temple and the dispersion of My children; pray, therefore, for the peace [of Zion] and I will give you peace’;<sup>66</sup><i class=""footnote"">(66) So GRA. V and H read, ‘I will forgive you’.</i> as it is stated, <i>Pray for the peace of Jerusalem</i>,<sup>67</sup><i class=""footnote"">(67) Ps. 122, 6.</i> and it also declares, <i>Peace be within thy walls</i>,<sup>68</sup><i class=""footnote"">(68) <i>ibid.</i> 7.</i> and it is also stated, <i>For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say: Peace be within thee</i>.<sup>69</sup><i class=""footnote"">(69) <i>ibid.</i> 8.</i>
As for him who loves peace, pursues peace, and gives the greeting of peace and responds with peace, the Holy One, blessed be He, will cause him to inherit life in this world and life in the World to Come, as it is stated, <i>But the humble shall inherit the land, and delight themselves in the abundance of peace</i>.<sup>70</sup><i class=""footnote"">(70) <i>ibid.</i> XXXVII, 11.</i> [60<i>a</i>]"
