<title>FOREWORD BY THE CHIEF RABBI</title>
<p>It gives me great pleasure to write a brief Foreword to the first complete English translation of the <italic>Massektoth &#x1E32;e&#x1E6D;annoth</italic>. These volumes further illustrate the notable contribution made by Anglo-Jewish scholars in the very difficult field of rendering into accurate, readable and intelligible English the great classics of Judaism. The Soncino Press, in the spirit of its founder, has displayed a characteristic courage in adding yet another important Rabbinic work to the row of publications which have brought it renown and gratitude on the part of scholars and students of Jewish literature throughout the world.</p>
<p>As can be seen both from the translation of the several Tractates, Introduction and Notes, the distinguished Editor and his collaborators have taken account of the research of scholars in dealing with the many problems associated with the text and dating of some of the tractates. The study of the context of these volumes must increase the student&#x2019;s appreciation of the variety and wealth of Israel&#x2019;s spiritual and ethical treasures.</p>

<chapter>
<title>PREFACE</title>
<p>In many editions of the Babylonian Talmud, at the end of the fourth Order, <italic>Seder Nezi&#x1E33;in</italic>, a series of Rabbinic works is included under the heading <italic>Massekoth &#x1E32;e&#x1E6D;annoth</italic>, &#x2018;Minor Tractates&#x2019;. The number varies but the fullest collection is provided in the Wilna-Romm edition where the total is fifteen. The title is not appropriate to all of them, because <italic>&#x2019;Aboth d&#x2019;Rabbi Nathan, Soferim, Sema&#x1E25;oth</italic> and <italic>Kallah Rabbathi</italic> are of considerable extent and the name has been attached to many more tractates than were originally intended.</p>
<p>Only seven appear to have formed the first collection of &#x2018;Minor Tractates&#x2019;. The earliest mention of it which has so far been discovered is in a reference to <italic>Masseketh &#x1E92;i&#x1E93;ith</italic> to be found in a work entitled <italic>Torath &#x2019;Adam</italic> by Na&#x1E25;manides (13th century) who speaks of <italic>Sheba&#x2018; Massekoth &#x1E32;e&#x1E6D;annoth</italic>, &#x2018;Seven Minor Tractates&#x2019;. A manuscript of them in the possession of the French scholar, Eliakim Carmoly, was edited by Raphael Kirchheim in 1851 under the title <italic>Septem Libri Talmudici Parvi Hiersolymitani</italic>, and consists of <italic>Sefer Torah, Mezuzah, Tefillin, &#x1E92;i&#x1E93;ith</italic> (all published by him for the first time), <italic>&#x2018;Abadim, Kuthim</italic> and <italic>Gerim</italic>. L. Zunz, <italic>Die Gottesdienstlichen Vortr&#x00E4;ge der Juden</italic>, 1892, p. 93, gives a different enumeration, viz. <italic>Dere&#x1E33; &#x2019;Ere&#x1E93;</italic> (<italic>Rabbah</italic> and <italic>Zu&#x1E6D;a</italic>), <italic>Soferim, Kallah, Sema&#x1E25;oth, &#x1E92;i&#x1E93;ith, Gerim</italic> and <italic>Kuthim</italic>. He adds a tractate <italic>Hilchoth &#x2019;Ere&#x1E93; Yisrael</italic>.</p>
<p>All the fifteen tractates which are here presented in their entirety for the first time in translation may be regarded as an apocrypha to the Talmud. H. L. Strack, <italic>Introduction to the Talmud and Midrash</italic>, 1931, p. 73, calls them &#x2018;Extra-canonical Tractates&#x2019;, and the question arises whether they were excluded because they were not in existence when the Babylonian Talmud was &#x2018;closed&#x2019; at the end of the fifth century or, as others hold, for the reason that they belong to the Tannaitic period and, like other <italic>halakic</italic> compendia, were superseded by the Mishnah of Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi.</p>
<p>Apart from <italic>&#x2019;Aboth d&#x2019;Rabbi Nathan</italic>, which is an elaboration of <italic>Pir&#x1E33;e &#x2019;Aboth</italic>, and <italic>Kallah Rabbathi</italic>, which is a Gemara on <italic>Kallah</italic>, the Minor Tractates are described by Zunz as &#x2018;Baraithoth in the form and style of the Tosefta&#x2019;, which means that the presentation of the material is archaic in form and style. References are met with in the Midrash and Talmud which seem to indicate that digests of certain <italic>halakic</italic> rulings existed then which correspond to some of the Minor Tractates.</p>
<p>The most striking occurs in the Midrash to Eccles. V, 8 on the text which is rendered, <italic>Moreover, the profit of the earth is in all things</italic>, and reads as follows: &#x2018;Those subjects which you deem additional to the Torah&#x2014;e.g. the addenda of the School of Rabbi [Judah ha-Nasi] and of R. Nathan, <italic>halakoth</italic> concerning proselytes (cf. also Midrash to Ruth I, 19, Sonc. ed., p. 35) and slaves&#x2014;they too were given to Moses on Sinai, and like the laws of <italic>&#x1E92;i&#x1E93;ith, Tefillin</italic> and <italic>Mezuzah</italic> are an integral part of the Torah&#x2019; (Sonc. ed., p. 138). The present writer makes the comment <italic>ad loc.:</italic> &#x2018;i.e. additions to the Mishnah (the so-called Baraithoth), <italic>&#x2019;Aboth d&#x2019;Rabbi Nathan</italic> and the tractates on Proselytes and Slaves, which were added to the official Mishnah; similarly the post-Talmudic tractates on <italic>&#x1E92;i&#x1E93;ith</italic>, etc., which he goes on to mention. The reference can hardly be to the actual laws of these subjects, as there would be no point in mentioning that these are not superfluous, for it is obvious&#x2019;.</p>
<p>If the interpretation is correct, the passage affords strong evidence of the existence of some of these tractates. Unfortunately the teaching is anonymous and the Midrash to Ecclesiastes is itself later; so no conclusion can be drawn from it as to their date. We are on firmer ground with respect to the tractate <italic>Sema&#x1E25;oth</italic>, because its existence in the Talmudic period is attested by the Talmud itself. It is quoted under its alternative title, <italic>&#x2019;Ebel Rabbathi</italic>, in M.&#x1E32;. 24a, 26b (Sonc. ed., pp. 148 and 172) and Keth. 28a (Sonc. ed., p. 153). The Rabbis who refer to it are Rafram b. Papa, Papa and Na&#x1E25;man, who all lived in the fourth century.</p>
<p>Mention is also made of &#x2018;the tractate <italic>Kallah</italic>&#x2019; in Shab. 114a (Sonc. ed., p. 558) by R. Jo&#x1E25;anan (3rd century), in Ta&#x2018;an 10b (Sonc. ed., p. 45) and &#x1E32;id. 49b (Sonc. ed., p. 247), but its meaning is disputed. While Rashi explains it as one of the tractates which are rarely studied, others connect <italic>Kallah</italic> with the Babylonian assemblies twice a year for the study of the laws of the Jewish Festivals. In view of this uncertainty no sure deduction can be drawn from these passages.</p>
<p>The Palestinian Talmud (Shab. VI, 2, 8a end) quotes a ruling on the correct order of putting on and taking off one&#x2019;s shoes from &#x2018;<italic>Dere&#x1E33; &#x2019;Ere&#x1E93;</italic>&#x2019;; and the Babylonian Talmud (Ber. 22a, Sonc. ed., p. 131) has an allusion by R. Judah (2nd century) to &#x2018;the <italic>halakoth</italic> of <italic>Dere&#x1E33; &#x2019;Ere&#x1E93;</italic>&#x2019;. What is intended is the tractate <italic>Dere&#x1E33; &#x2019;Ere&#x1E93; Rabbah</italic> which most authorities hold to be an early production; whereas <italic>Dere&#x1E33; &#x2019;Ere&#x1E93; Zu&#x1E6D;a</italic> is in all probability a much later work (cf. J.E. IV, p. 529).</p>
<p>While the available data may not be conclusive, they are sufficient to make it hazardous to maintain dogmatically that a pre-Gaonic date for any of the tractates must be ruled out. It is known that collections of <italic>halakoth</italic> decisions were made by several Tanna&#x00EF;m before the Mishnah of Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi was accepted as the authoritative standard. Consequently the compilation of <italic>halakic</italic> manuals on various subjects in Talmudic times is not inherently impossible. Higger, in the Introduction to his edition of <italic>The Seven Minor Tractates</italic>, judges them to be &#x2018;the first post-Mishnaic compendia regulating specific Jewish practices and usages&#x2019;. His opinion is that &#x2018;most of the Minor Tractates are Palestinian in origin, but were later modified or elaborated in Babylonia&#x2019;.</p>
<p>A contrary view is held by such scholars as I. H. Weiss, <italic>Dor Dor weDoreshaw</italic>, 1904, II, pp. 216ff, and L. Ginzberg, J.E. VII, p. 640; <italic>On Jewish Law and Lore</italic>, 1955, pp. 166f. The latter contends: &#x2018;Among the products of the codifiers of the Gaonic period should be reckoned the seven small treatises, in the style of the Mishnah&#x2026;. The only probable sources for these treatises are the Talmud and the <italic>halakic</italic> midrashim. The small amount of new material which they contain is not to be traced to old, lost sources, but is the work of the compiler or compilers, whose authority prominent rabbis did not rate very highly. Toward the end of the period of the Gaonim, it is probable that codifications, now entirely lost, were made of different branches of the ritual as well as of the juridical law&#x2019;. Hence he regards the seven tractates as codes produced in that era which, unlike others, survived.</p>
<p>The translators in this volume incline to the opinion of Higger that in their original form many of the tractates belong to a comparatively early date and were subsequently revised.</p>
<p>&#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A;</p>
<p>In undertaking the translation, my collaborators were faced with a difficult task. The Wilna-Romm edition has been selected as the basic text because of its availability, but it is unreliable and often in a corrupt condition. Wherever possible the invaluable notes and emendations of the Wilna Gaon were utilised, as were the editions of Schechter, M&#x00FC;ller and Higger. Passages in one tractate not infrequently reappear in other tractates; but no attempt has been made to obtain strict uniformity in translation or even interpretation, and each translator has been allowed to give his own version. Cross-references usually indicate where the difference is material.</p>
<p>Biblical quotations are taken from the American-Jewish Translation with its arrangement of chapter and verse, and when a deviation is required by the Rabbinic interpretation it is noted in the Commentary. To all citations from the Babylonian Talmud and Midrash Rabbah I have added the location in the English versions published by the Soncino Press. Editorial additions to Introductions and Commentary are enclosed within square brackets.</p>
<p>I have, in conclusion, to thank the scholars who co-operated with me in the production of this work. The devotion with which they discharged their laborious task is deeply appreciated.</p>

<p>The typescript of this work was in the hands of the Publishers when the untimely death of Mr. H. Vezey Strong caused its suspension. My long association with him in connection with the Soncino Press entitles me to acknowledge the great debt which Anglo-Jewry owes to the enthusiasm and expert knowledge of typography which he devoted to the works issued by that publishing house. On the death of its Founder, Mr. Jack Davidson, he resolved that the high traditions of the Soncino Press should not suffer by the passing of his colleague.</p>
<p>One consequence of the delay in publication was the appearance of J. Goldin&#x2019;s translation of &#x2018;The Fathers according to Rabbi Nathan&#x2019; in the Yale Judaica Series before the version in this collection. The student of the Tractate may find it an advantage to have two independent renderings before him for consultation.</p>

<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<h1><small>LOCATION AND CHARACTER</small></h1>
<p>The tractate &#x2019;<italic>Aboth d&#x2019;Rabbi Nathan</italic> is usually found in the editions of the Talmud at the end of Seder Nezi&#x1E33;in. It heads the series of &#x2018;Minor Tractates&#x2019; printed after Sanhedrin and is the longest of them; though it is doubtful whether ARN is strictly to be included among the &#x2018;Minor Tractates&#x2019;.</p>
<p>ARN may be described as a homiletical exposition and expansion of Mishnah Aboth&#x2014;the collection of ethical maxims and aphorisms of the <italic>Tanna&#x00EF;m</italic> popularly entitled &#x2018;Ethics of the Fathers&#x2019;. In this work the separate sentences of Mishnah Aboth are generally taken as texts which are either explained by reference to Biblical passages or illustrated by narratives and legends. Frequently long digressions are made, and subjects and stories are introduced which are connected but loosely and by a slender thread with the text. Accordingly, the five chapters of Mishnah Aboth are expounded and elaborated in the forty-one chapters of ARN. Furthermore, this work contains material which is unique in Talmudic literature, and sometimes is the only extant source for many sentences, proverbs and incidents which are quoted in the Talmud and Midrash. Indeed, the view has been strongly put forward that the <italic>&#x2019;Amora&#x00EF;m</italic> were already familiar with this work and drew from its source material in about thirty instances.</p>
<p>This summary description of the work suggests that ARN may be regarded as the <italic>Tosiftha</italic>, or perhaps as the <italic>Gemara</italic>, to Mishnah Aboth, and in the Middle Ages it was often quoted by these titles. Nevertheless, it must be observed that the Mishnah Aboth, which served as the basis for ARN, could not have been the present work, because of the many substantial variations in the text of the maxims of the Rabbis. An earlier version of Mishnah Aboth must have been used by the author of ARN.</p>
<h1><small>VERSIONS OF THE TRACTATE</small></h1>
<p>ARN has come down to us in two recensions. But there must have been other versions of this work, since the Rabbis of the Middle Ages quote passages from ARN which are not found in either of the recensions known to us. In 1887 Solomon Schechter published from manuscripts these two recensions in parallel columns, designating them Recension A and Recension B (in this work quoted as 1 ARN and 2 ARN respectively). The two recensions, though closely related to each other, are obviously independent. They are alike in method and in much of the material included, but at times differ considerably and give the impression of two distinct works. Schechter, in his comprehensive and penetrating study on this subject, has shown that Recension B is cited only by Spanish Rabbis, whereas Rashi and most of the French and German Rabbis used Recension A.</p>
<h1><small>ITS COMPOSITION</small></h1>
<p>The treatise ARN, like Mishnah Aboth, may be said to be a compilation of four main collections, and its chapters correspond to the following scheme:</p>
<p align="blockquote"><small>COLLECTION A</small>, consisting of chaps. I to XI, is in the nature of a Midrash on Aboth I, 1-11, and illustrates by text and parable the teaching of the <italic>Zugoth</italic> (pairs of <italic>Tanna&#x00EF;m</italic>) beginning with the men of the Great Synagogue and continuing chronologically down to Hillel and Shammai.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><small>COLLECTION B</small>, consisting of chaps. XII to XVIII, is likewise a Midrash elucidating the maxims contained in Aboth I, 12-15 and II, 5-21, and comprises the teachings of Hillel and Shammai, Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Zakkai and his five famous disciples.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><small>COLLECTION C</small>, consisting of chaps. XIX to XXX, is an independent mishnaic collection similar to Aboth III and IV.</p>
<p align="blockquote"><small>COLLECTION D</small>, consisting of chaps. XXXI to XLI is, like Aboth V, a series of anonymous statements connected by the similarity of their form. Here historical, legendary and ethical material is classified in groups of identical numbers, from ten to three.</p>
<p>It will be seen that the order of ARN is to a large extent identical with that of Mishnah Aboth but with one striking exception to which attention must be drawn. Mishnah Aboth I, after enumerating the <italic>Zugoth</italic> and their maxims down to the last pair, Hillel and Shammai, continues with the sayings of Hillel&#x2019;s descendants down to Rabbi Judah the Prince and his son Rabban Gamaliel III. All contemporary Rabbis and their maxims are set aside so as not to interrupt the line of the Patriarchate from Hillel to Rabbi Judah the Prince. Accordingly, the aphorisms of Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Zakkai, the immediate successor of Hillel, are relegated to chap. II. ARN, on the other hand, is exact in its presentation of the chain of tradition and records the sayings of Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Zakkai in their right place, immediately after those of Hillel, while the dicta of Rabban Gamaliel I and of his son are relegated to a later place namely in chap. XXII.</p>
<h1><small>COMPARISON WITH MISHNAH ABOTH</small></h1>
<p>A comparison of the texts of the maxims of the Rabbis as found in Mishnah Aboth and in ARN is most revealing. The texts in the latter are often the informal opinions of the Rabbis, the views expressed by them in the course of conversation or discussion. These opinions, however, were edited by Rabbi Judah the Prince and his predecessors until they assumed the precise, pointed and epigrammatic style as preserved in Mishnah Aboth. Finkelstein (in his <italic>Introduction to the Tractate Abot and Abot of Rabbi Nathan</italic>, p. vii) comments on this feature in these words: &#x2018;While Abot of Rabbi Nathan is invaluable because it has preserved the maxims of the ancient teachers in their original informal style, the Mishnah of Abot is also invaluable because in it we discover how the Academies transformed these maxims into formal norms, to be handed down from generation to generation&#x2019;.</p>
<h1><small>THE TITLE OF THE TRACTATE</small></h1>
<p>The title of this work, <italic>&#x2019;Aboth d&#x2019;Rabbi Nathan</italic>&#x2014;with its variants &#x2018;Mishnah Aboth of Rabbi Nathan&#x2019; and &#x2018;Baraitha of Rabbi Nathan&#x2019;&#x2014;is problematical, particularly its attribution to Rabbi Nathan. The <italic>Tanna&#x2019;</italic> of that name, or R. Nathan ha-Babli as he is often referred to, was a native of Babylon who migrated to the Holy Land in the middle of the second century <small>C.E.</small> He was at once respected for his learning and lineage&#x2014;his father was the Exilarch in Babylon&#x2014;and was appointed <italic>Ab Beth Din</italic> with his colleague, R. Meir, as <italic>&#x1E24;akam</italic>. Owing to dissensions between these two scholars on the one side and the Patriarch, Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel, on the other, they conspired to depose the Patriarch and usurp his authority. When the plot was discovered, the Patriarch had the conspirators expelled from the Academy. They were ultimately readmitted only on the condition that the name of neither should be mentioned in the Academy in connection with halachic decisions. R. Meir&#x2019;s authority was hidden under the style &#x2018;Others say&#x2019; and R. Nathan&#x2019;s under &#x2018;Some say&#x2019; (Horayoth 13b, Sonc. ed., p. 104). It is therefore easy to understand why the family of the Patriarch was not well disposed towards R. Nathan. No wonder, then, that Rabbi Judah the Prince, the son of the above-named Rabban Simeon, omitted as far as he could the name of R. Nathan from the Mishnah which he compiled. And though R. Nathan was the author of many ethical maxims, not once is his name found in Mishnah Aboth. R. Nathan, however, is known to have made independently a compilation of Mishnah and Baraitha; and it is reasonable to assume that ARN was originally a work which emanated from his school.</p>
<p>The author of the Ma&#x1E25;zor <italic>Vi&#x1E6D;ri</italic>, Rabbi Sim&#x1E25;ah, a disciple of Rashi, in his commentary on Aboth makes the following interesting observation: &#x2018;This Baraitha is called &#x201C;Aboth of R. Nathan&#x201D;, but I do not know the reason for it. The suggestion that it is so called because R. Nathan is the first authority mentioned therein is untenable, since R. Jose the Galilean is named first, R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba second and R. Nathan only third. It must be said, however, that the Sages had a tradition that R. Nathan compiled this work. And just as we know of the Mishnah collections of R. &#x1E24;iyya and R. Hoshaya, and also the collections of Bar &#x1E32;appara, Samuel and Levi, so this work must have been part of the Mishnah compilation of R. Nathan referred to in Midrash &#x1E32;oheleth and Pesi&#x1E33;tha Rabbathi&#x2019;.</p>
<p>&#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A; &#x002A;</p>
<p>The present translation of ARN is based on the printed text as included in the Vilna-Romm edition of the Talmud, but constant reference has been made to Schechter&#x2019;s critical edition of Recension A and to the manuscripts, especially MS. E, which he quotes. The references to Mishnah Aboth are to the edition in the <italic>Authorized Daily Prayer Book</italic> since it is readily available. Recourse has been had to the several commentaries on this work, particularly to the brilliant and ingenious glosses and emendations of Rabbi Elijah of Vilna; to all due acknowledgment is here made. I would also express my gratitude to the many friends and scholars who so freely proffered me advice and help. And though it would be invidious to single out names, I feel that I would be failing in respect and courtesy if I did not acknowledge my deep indebtedness and gratitude to the Editor, who not only read through the manuscript with meticulous thoroughness, but discussed with me with an open mind the manifold problems and difficulties presented by this tractate. It is also with great pleasure that I express my appreciation of the invaluable assistance and advice tendered to me by my friends, Dr. L. Collins, of London and Mr. E. L. Wolfe, of Hove, with both of whom I made a thorough and minute study of the text, and together we weighed, sifted and pondered over ideas and expressions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I would say how glad I am of the opportunity granted me by the Soncino Press of making this tractate available to the English-speaking world, that it might be accepted as a companion volume to that ever-popular and ever-fresh work, the &#x2018;Ethics of the Fathers&#x2019;; for both are replete with eternal gems and moral treasures, and together make a positive contribution to the spiritual uplift of man.</p>

<p label="1.">Moses was sanctified by the cloud and received the Torah at Sinai, as it is stated, <italic>And the glory of the Lord abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered him six days</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1">1</xref></sup> [It covered Moses] in order to cleanse him, and this occurred after [the proclamation of] the Ten Commandments. So expounded R. Jose the Galilean. R. A&#x1E33;iba said: The verse <italic>and the cloud covered him six days</italic> refers to [the mountain and not to] Moses.<sup><xref rid="fn2">2</xref></sup> The continuation of the verse, <italic>And the seventh day He called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud</italic>, is to single Moses out for special honour.<sup><xref rid="fn3">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Nathan said: Why was it that Moses remained on the mountain six whole days without the Word<sup><xref rid="fn4">4</xref></sup> descending upon him? It was that he might be purged of all food and drink which were in his bowels, until such time as he would become holy and be like the ministering angels.<sup><xref rid="fn5">5</xref></sup> R. Mathia b. &#x1E24;eresh said to him, &#x2018;Master, surely the only purpose was to impress him so that he should receive the words of the Torah with awe and fear, with dread and trembling, as it is stated, <italic>Serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn6">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is related that R. Josiah and R. Mathia b. &#x1E24;eresh happened to be sitting engaged in the study of the Torah, when R. Josiah departed to pursue some secular affairs. R. Mathia b. &#x1E24;eresh said to him, &#x2018;Master, why do you forsake the words of the living God and immerse yourself in secular affairs? And though you are my teacher and I your pupil, [I venture to say that] it is not right to forsake the words of the living God and immerse oneself in secular affairs&#x2019;. It was said of them that while they were engaged together in the study of the Torah they were like foes one towards the other, but when they departed they were like lifelong friends.</p>
<p label="2.">By the hand of Moses was the Torah given at Sinai, as it is stated, <italic>And He wrote them upon two tables of stone, and gave them unto me</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn7">7</xref></sup> and in another passage it is stated, <italic>These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which the Lord made between Him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn8">8</xref></sup> The Torah which the Holy One, blessed be He, gave to Israel was given solely through Moses, as it is stated, <italic>Between Him and the children of Israel</italic>. Thus Moses was worthy to become the intermediary between Israel and the All-present. Moses offered the ram of consecration<sup><xref rid="fn9">9</xref></sup> and prepared the anointing oil with which he anointed Aaron and his sons during the seven days of consecration. Of that same oil were anointed all subsequent High Priests and kings.<sup><xref rid="fn10">10</xref></sup> Eleazar burned the heifer of purification<sup><xref rid="fn11">11</xref></sup> from whose ashes all the unclean of later generations were made clean. R. Eliezer said: Great was this act<sup><xref rid="fn12">12</xref></sup> because it was effective for all future generations, since Aaron and his sons were consecrated with this anointing oil [and their priesthood continued for many generations], as it is stated, <italic>And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto Me in the priest&#x2019;s office</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn13">13</xref></sup></p>
<p label="3.">Joshua received [the Torah] from Moses, as it is stated, <italic>And thou shalt put of thy honour upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may hearken</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn14">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The elders received it from Joshua, as it is stated, <italic>And the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of the Lord, that He had wrought for Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn15">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Judges received it from the elders,<sup><xref rid="fn16">16</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>And it came to pass in the days when the judges judged</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn17">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The prophets received it from the Judges, as it is stated, <italic>I have sent unto you all My servants the prophets, sending them daily betimes and often</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn18">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi received it from the [earlier] prophets.</p>
<p>The men of the Great Assembly<sup><xref rid="fn19">19</xref></sup> received it from Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi. T<small>HEY SAID THREE THINGS: BE DELIBERATE IN JUDGMENT, RAISE UP MANY DISCIPLES, AND MAKE A FENCE ROUND THE TORAH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn20">20</xref></sup></p>
<p label="4."><small>BE DELIBERATE IN JUDGMENT</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that a man should be cautious in judgment, because the more cautious a man is in judgment the more confirmed is he in his judgment, as it is stated, <italic>These are the proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out</italic><sup><xref rid="fn21">21</xref></sup>&#x2014;they did not merely copy them out but deliberated on them.<sup><xref rid="fn22">22</xref></sup> Abba Saul said: [The meaning is] not that they deliberated on them but brought them to light.<sup><xref rid="fn23">23</xref></sup> At first it was held that the books of Proverbs, Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes were to be stored away<sup><xref rid="fn24">24</xref></sup> since they merely contained aphorisms and were not part of the [holy] writings. Thereupon they condemned them to be stored away, [and so they remained] until the men of the Great Assembly<sup><xref rid="fn25">25</xref></sup> came and brought them to light again. For it is stated,<sup><xref rid="fn26">26</xref></sup> <italic>And I beheld among the thoughtless ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding&#x2026;. And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of a harlot, and wily of heart. She is riotous and rebellious, her feet abide not in her house; now she is in the streets, now in the broad places, and lieth in wait at every corner. So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face she said to him: Sacrifices of peace-offerings were due from me; this day have I paid my vows. Therefore came I forth to meet thee, to seek thy face, and I have found thee. I have decked my couch with coverlets, with striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt. I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; let us solace ourselves with loves. For my husband is not at home, he is gone a long journey; he hath taken the bag of money with him; he will come home at the full moon</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn27">27</xref></sup> And it is written in the Song of Songs: <italic>Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field;</italic> [17<italic>a</italic>] <italic>let us lodge in the villages. Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see whether the vine hath budded, whether the vine-blossom be opened, and the pomegranates be in flower; there will I give thee my love</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn28">28</xref></sup> And it is written in Ecclesiastes: <italic>Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes; but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn29">29</xref></sup> And it is further written in the Song of Songs: <italic>I am my beloved&#x2019;s and his desire is toward me</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn30">30</xref></sup> Thus they did not deliberate on them but brought them to light.</p>
<p>Another interpretation of <small>BE DELIBERATE IN JUDGMENT</small>: What does it mean? It teaches that a man should speak his words calmly and should not speak in anger; for he who speaks in anger will [in the end] cause his words to be forgotten. We find it so in the case of Moses our master that he forgot his words, as it is stated, <italic>And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war that went to the battle: This is the statute of the law which the Lord hath commanded Moses</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn31">31</xref></sup> He commanded Moses but not me; He commanded Moses, my father&#x2019;s brother, but not me.<sup><xref rid="fn32">32</xref></sup> And where do we find that Moses had spoken in anger? It states, <italic>And Moses was wrath with the officers of the Lord&#x2026;. And Moses said unto them: Have ye saved all the women alive?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn33">33</xref></sup> Why does the verse state <italic>all the women?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn34">34</xref></sup> It is because of the advice which the wicked Balaam counselled against Israel, as it is written, <italic>And now, behold, I go unto my people; come, and I will announce to thee what this people shall do to thy people in the end of days</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn35">35</xref></sup> He said to Balak, &#x2018;This people whom you hate is hungry for food and athirst for drink, since they have nothing to eat or drink except the manna alone. Go, then, erect booths for them, set out food and drink for them, and place there beautiful girls of royal station, to the end that the people may stray after Baal of Peor, and they will fall by the hand of the All-present&#x2019;. Forthwith Balak proceeded to carry out all that the wicked Balaam had counselled. See, now, what calamity that wicked Balaam brought upon Israel, since through him there fell twenty and four thousand of them, as it is stated, <italic>And these that died by the plague were twenty and four thousand</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn36">36</xref></sup> Is there not here an argument from the greater to the less? If it happened to Moses, who was the wisest among the wise and the greatest among the great, the father of the prophets, that when he spoke in anger he forgot his words, how much more so [does this apply to us ordinary persons]&#x0021; It therefore teaches that a man should speak his words calmly and not speak in anger.</p>
<p>Ben &#x2018;Azzai said: Beware of idle chatter in your speech.<sup><xref rid="fn37">37</xref></sup></p>
<p label="5."><small>AND MAKE A FENCE ROUND THE TORAH</small>. Make a fence to your words as the Holy One, blessed be He, made a fence to His words; and likewise Adam the first man, the Torah, Moses, Job, the Prophets, the Writings,<sup><xref rid="fn38">38</xref></sup> and the Sages all made a fence to their words.<sup><xref rid="fn39">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>What fence did the Holy One, blessed be He, make to His words? It is stated, <italic>Even all the nations shall say; Wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto this land?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn40">40</xref></sup> This teaches that it was already revealed to Him Who spoke and the world came into being<sup><xref rid="fn41">41</xref></sup> that future generations will ask: <italic>Wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto this land?</italic> Consequently the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, &#x2018;Moses, write [down the answer] and place it on record for generations to come: <italic>Then men shall say: Because they forsook the covenant of the Lord &#x2026; and went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods that they knew not, and that He had not allotted unto them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn42">42</xref></sup> Hence you learn that the Holy One, blessed be He, made a fence to His words, and recorded in the Torah what people would say in the future; thus bearing witness that the Holy One, blessed be He, pays His creatures their reward in full.<sup><xref rid="fn43">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>What fence did Adam, the first man, make to his words? It is stated, <italic>And the Lord God commanded the man, saying: Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn44">44</xref></sup> Adam was unwilling to tell this to Eve exactly as the Holy One, blessed be He, had commanded him; he therefore made a fence to his words, over and above the words which the Holy One, blessed be He, had spoken to him, and this is what he said to her, <italic>But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said: Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn45">45</xref></sup> By so doing he meant to keep both himself and Eve away from the tree, even to the extent of not touching it. At that moment the wicked serpent reasoned to himself saying, &#x2018;Since I cannot bring about the fall of Adam, I will bring about the fall of Eve&#x2019;. Thereupon he went and seated himself beside Eve and entered into much conversation with her. He said, &#x2018;If you think it is the touching [of the tree] that the Holy One, blessed be He, has forbidden us, behold I will touch it and not die; so you, too, will not die if you touch it&#x2019;. What did the wicked serpent then do? He arose, touched the tree with his hands and feet, and shook it violently so that its fruit fell to the ground. There are some, however, who say that he did not actually touch it, but that as soon as the tree saw him it cried out, &#x2018;O wicked one, do not touch me&#x2019;; as it is stated, <italic>Let not the foot of pride overtake me, and let not the hand of the wicked shake me</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn46">46</xref></sup></p>
<p label="6.">Another interpretation of the verse, <italic>Let not the foot of pride overtake me</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn47">47</xref></sup> refers it to Titus, may his bones rot&#x0021; For he raised his hand in contempt and struck the altar exclaiming, &#x2018;Lukos&#x0021; Lukos&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn48">48</xref></sup> You are a king just as I am a king, come and engage in battle with me. How many oxen have been slain upon you&#x0021; How many birds have been killed upon you&#x0021; How much wine has been poured out upon you&#x0021; How much incense has been burned upon you&#x0021; It is you who are destroying the whole world&#x2019;, as it is stated, <italic>Ah, Ariel, Ariel</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn49">49</xref></sup> <italic>the city where David was encamped&#x0021; Add ye year to year, let the feasts come round&#x0021;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn50">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore the serpent said to her, &#x2018;If you think it is the eating [of the fruit of the tree] that the Holy One, blessed be He, has forbidden us, behold I will eat of it and will not die; so you, too, will not die if you eat of it&#x2019;. Eve then began to think to herself, &#x2018;All that my master has commanded me from the beginning is false&#x2019;&#x2014;for Eve used to address Adam as &#x2018;master from the beginning&#x2019;. She immediately took of the fruit and ate it, and also gave some to Adam, which he ate, as it is stated, <italic>And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes</italic>, etc.<sup><xref rid="fn51">51</xref></sup></p>
<p label="7.">With ten curses was Eve cursed at that time, as it is stated, <italic>Unto the woman He said: I will multiply and multiply thy pain and thy travail; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn52">52</xref></sup> <italic>I will multiply and multiply</italic>&#x2014;these are the two discharges of blood [which cause pain to women], the menstrual and [at the termination of] virginity. [<italic>Thy pain</italic>&#x2014;this is the anxiety connected with the rearing of children.]<sup><xref rid="fn53">53</xref></sup> <italic>And thy travail</italic>&#x2014;this is the pain associated with conception. <italic>In pain thou shalt bring forth children</italic>&#x2014;this is to be understood in its literal meaning. <italic>And thy desire shall be to thy husband</italic>&#x2014;this teaches that a woman particularly yearns for her husband when he is about to set out on a journey. <italic>And he shall rule over thee</italic>&#x2014;for the man solicits by word of mouth whereas the woman solicits in her heart. [Furthermore, during her periods] she is wrapped up like a mourner, shut up as in a prison and banished from the company of all men. Now what brought about the act of touching? The answer is the fence which Adam had made to his words.<sup><xref rid="fn54">54</xref></sup> Hence [the Sages] said: When a man makes a fence to his words, he is not always able to stand by his words. They further said: Hence let not a man add to the words which he has heard. R. Jose said: A firm [wall] of ten hand-breadths is better than a tottering [wall] of a hundred cubits.</p>
<p>What was in the mind of the wicked serpent at that time? &#x2018;I will go,&#x2019; he thought, &#x2018;slay Adam and marry his wife; then I will be king over the whole world. I shall also walk erect and eat all the dainties of the world.&#x2019; Whereupon the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, &#x2018;You reckoned [17<italic>b</italic>] to slay Adam and marry Eve; therefore <italic>I will put enmity between thee and the woman</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn55">55</xref></sup> You reckoned to be king over the whole world; therefore <italic>Cursed art thou from among all cattle</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn56">56</xref></sup> You reckoned to walk erect; therefore <italic>Upon thy belly shalt thou go</italic>. You reckoned to eat all the dainties of the world; therefore <italic>Dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life</italic>.</p>
<p>R. Simeon b. Menasia said: Alas for the most useful servant that was lost to the world&#x0021; For had not the serpent been cursed, every Israelite would have been provided with two serpents for his personal use at home; one he would send to the west and the other to the east, to bring him thence gems, precious stones, pearls and every desirable thing in the world, and no creature could ever injure them.<sup><xref rid="fn57">57</xref></sup> Moreover, they could have been employed in the place of camels, asses and mules to provide manure for gardens and orchards.</p>
<p label="8.">R. Judah b. Bathyra said: Adam, the first man, was reclining in the Garden of Eden with ministering angels at his service, roasting meat and cooling wine for him. Then the serpent came and, seeing him in all his glory, at once grew envious of him.<sup><xref rid="fn58">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>How was Adam, the first man, created? In the first hour his dust was gathered together, in the second his outline was shaped, in the third he was made into solid substance, in the fourth his limbs were articulated, in the fifth his orifices were opened, in the sixth a soul was infused into him, in the seventh he stood on his feet, in the eighth Eve became his mate, in the ninth he was brought into the Garden of Eden, in the tenth he received his command [concerning the tree], in the eleventh he sinned, and in the twelfth he was driven out, thus fulfilling what is stated, <italic>Man tarrieth not overnight in his glory</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn59">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>Which Psalm did Adam recite on the first day?<sup><xref rid="fn60">60</xref></sup> <italic>The earth is the Lord&#x2019;s and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn61">61</xref></sup> because He created the world, assigned it to mankind, and is the sole Judge of the world. Which did he recite on the second day? <italic>Great is the Lord, and highly to be praised, in the city of our God, His holy mountain;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn62">62</xref></sup> because He divided the work of creation and became Sovereign in His universe. Which did he recite on the third day? <italic>God standeth in the congregation of God; in the midst of the judges He judgeth;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn63">63</xref></sup> because He then created the sea and the dry land, the earth was rolled<sup><xref rid="fn64">64</xref></sup> into position, and a place was set apart for His people. Which did he recite on the fourth day? <italic>O Lord, Thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, Thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, shine forth;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn65">65</xref></sup> because He then created the sun, the moon, the stars and the planets, which give light on earth, and He will in the future punish those who worship them. Which did he recite on the fifth day? <italic>Sing aloud unto God our strength; shout unto the God of Jacob;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn66">66</xref></sup> because He then created the birds, the fishes and the sea-monsters, which sing aloud His praises in the world. Which did he recite on the sixth day? <italic>The Lord reigneth; He is clothed in majesty; the Lord is clothed, He hath girded Himself with strength; yea the world is established, that it cannot be moved;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn67">67</xref></sup> because He then completed all His works, was exalted and sat enthroned in the heights of the universe. Which did he recite on the seventh day? <italic>A Psalm, a Song. For the Sabbath day;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn68">68</xref></sup> because of the day which will be all Sabbath, when there will be neither eating nor drinking nor worldly affairs, but the righteous will sit with crowns on their heads enjoying<sup><xref rid="fn69">69</xref></sup> the brilliance of the Divine Presence, as it is stated, <italic>And they beheld God, and did eat and drink</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn70">70</xref></sup> like the ministering angels. And why was this so?<sup><xref rid="fn71">71</xref></sup> In order that [Adam] might immediately partake of the Sabbath meal.</p>
<p>R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: I will expound this to you with a parable. To what might Adam be compared? To a man who married a proselyte and used to give her instruction, saying, &#x2018;My dear, do not eat bread when your hands are defiled, do not eat untithed produce, do not profane the Sabbath, do not make vows rashly, and do not associate with another man. If you break one of these rules, you will die&#x2019;. Now what did a certain man do?<sup><xref rid="fn72">72</xref></sup> He arose and ate in her presence bread although his hands were defiled, he ate before her untithed produce&#x2014;he profaned the Sabbath and made vows rashly&#x2014;and also offered her some [of the food].<sup><xref rid="fn73">73</xref></sup> What could that proselyte have thought to herself? All that my husband forbade me in the beginning was without foundation. She thereupon went and transgressed them all.</p>
<p>R. Simeon b. Yo&#x1E25;ai said: I, too, will explain this to you by a parable. To what might Adam be compared? To a man who had his wife at home with him. Now what did that man do? He went and brought a cask into which he put an exact number of figs and nuts. He also caught a scorpion, placed it in the mouth of the cask, covered the cask with a tight-fitting lid and put it away in a corner. He then said to his wife, &#x2018;My dear, all that I possess in this house is at your disposal except this cask which you may not touch under any circumstances&#x2019;. What did this woman do? No sooner had her husband gone off to market than she arose, opened the cask, put her hand in it and was bitten by the scorpion. Immediately she went and flung herself on her bed. When her husband returned from market he asked her what had happened, and she replied, &#x2018;I put my hand in the cask and was bitten by a scorpion, and now I am dying&#x2019;. He said to her, &#x2018;Did I not tell you in the beginning that everything I had in the house was at your disposal except that cask which you were not to touch under any circumstances?&#x2019; He at once became furious with her and drove her out. So it was with Adam, the first man, when the Holy One, blessed be He, charged him, <italic>Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn74">74</xref></sup> No sooner had Adam eaten of it than he was driven out [of Eden], to fulfil that which is stated, <italic>Man tarrieth not overnight in his glory; he is like the beasts that perish</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn75">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the same one day he was formed, created, his outline was shaped, he became solid substance, his limbs were articulated, his orifices opened, a soul was infused into him, he stood on his feet, Eve became his mate, he named [all creatures], was brought into the Garden of Eden, given a command, sinned and was driven out, to fulfil that which is stated, <italic>Man tarrieth not overnight in his glory</italic>. On that same day two went upon the bed and four came down.<sup><xref rid="fn76">76</xref></sup> R. Judah b. Bathyra said: On that day two went upon the bed and six came down.<sup><xref rid="fn77">77</xref></sup></p>
<p>On that day three decrees were pronounced upon Adam, as it is stated, <italic>And unto Adam He said: Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife &#x2026; cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it &#x2026; thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn78">78</xref></sup> When Adam heard that the Holy One, blessed be He, had decreed against him, <italic>Thou shalt eat the grass of the field</italic>, his limbs forthwith began to tremble and he exclaimed, &#x2018;Lord of the universe&#x0021; Am I and my beast to eat from one manger?&#x2019; Whereupon the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, &#x2018;Since your limbs trembled [at the prospect]&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn79">79</xref></sup> <italic>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn80">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>Just as three decrees were pronounced upon Adam so were three decrees pronounced upon Eve, as it is stated, <italic>I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy travail; in pain thou shalt bring forth children</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn81">81</xref></sup> [<italic>I will greatly multiply</italic>]&#x2014;for when a woman begins to experience her monthly flow she suffers pain; <italic>I will greatly multiply</italic><sup><xref rid="fn82">82</xref></sup> [<italic>thy pain</italic>]&#x2014;for when a woman experiences intercourse for the first time it is painful to her; <italic>thy pain</italic> [<italic>and thy travail</italic>]&#x2014;for during the first three months of pregnancy a woman&#x2019;s features become coarsened and pallid.</p>
<p>As [his first] evening set in and Adam saw the world darkening in the west, he exclaimed, &#x2018;Woe is me&#x0021; Because I have sinned, the Holy One, blessed be He, is darkening the world upon me&#x0021;&#x2019; He was unaware that such was the course of nature; but in the morning when he saw the world becoming light in the east he was exceedingly happy. He arose and built an altar, he took a bullock whose horns came into being before its hoofs<sup><xref rid="fn83">83</xref></sup> and offered it as a burnt-offering, as it is stated, <italic>And it shall please the Lord better than a bullock that hath horns and hoofs</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn84">84</xref></sup></p>
<p>The bullock which Adam offered, the bull which Noah offered,<sup><xref rid="fn85">85</xref></sup> and the ram which our father Abraham offered on the altar instead of his son, were all beasts whose horns came into being before their hoofs, as it is stated, [18<italic>a</italic>] <italic>And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn86">86</xref></sup></p>
<p>Then and there<sup><xref rid="fn87">87</xref></sup> three bands of ministering angels came down with harps and lyres and other musical instruments in their hands and joined with him in a song of praise, as it is stated, <italic>A Psalm, a Song. For the Sabbath day. It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord&#x2026;. To declare Thy lovingkindness in the morning, and Thy faithfulness in the night seasons</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn88">88</xref></sup> <italic>To declare Thy lovingkindness in the morning</italic>&#x2014;this refers to the world to come which is likened to the brightness of the morning, as it is stated, <italic>They are new every morning; great is Thy faithfulness</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn89">89</xref></sup> <italic>And Thy faithfulness in the night seasons</italic>&#x2014;this refers to this world which is likened to [the darkness of] night, as it is stated, <italic>The burden of Dumah. One calleth unto me out of Seir: Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn90">90</xref></sup></p>
<p>At that time the Holy One, blessed be He, said, &#x2018;If I do not inflict punishment upon the serpent I will be destroying the whole world&#x2019;. He also said, &#x2018;As for man whom I made lord and king over the world, how he has become entangled [in the wiles of the serpent] and eaten of the [forbidden] tree&#x0021;&#x2019; Thereupon He turned His attention to him and cursed him, as it is stated, <italic>And the Lord God said unto the serpent</italic>, etc.<sup><xref rid="fn91">91</xref></sup> R. Jose said: Had the curse of the serpent been deferred to later,<sup><xref rid="fn92">92</xref></sup> He would in the meantime have destroyed the whole world.</p>
<p>When the Holy One, blessed be He, created Adam, the first man, He formed him behind and before,<sup><xref rid="fn93">93</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>Thou hast formed me behind and before, and laid Thy hand upon me</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn94">94</xref></sup> Ministering angels descended to adore him,<sup><xref rid="fn95">95</xref></sup> whereupon the Holy One, blessed be He, took him up and placed him beneath His wings, as it is stated, <italic>And laid Thy hand upon me</italic>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation of <italic>And laid Thy hand upon me:</italic> when Adam sinned, the Holy One, blessed be He, removed one [of His hands] from him. From this it may be inferred that when Adam and the Temple were created, they were each created by His two hands. Whence do we know that man was created by His two hands? For it is stated, <italic>Thy hands have made me and fashioned me</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn96">96</xref></sup> And whence do we know that the Temple was created by His two hands? For it is stated, <italic>The sanctuary, O Lord, which Thy hands have established</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn97">97</xref></sup> And it is also said, <italic>And He brought them to His holy border, to the mountain which His right hand had gotten;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn98">98</xref></sup> and further it is written, <italic>The Lord shall reign for ever and ever</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn99">99</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn2">(2) This reading is adopted by all Commentators and has MS. support. The sense of the controversy also requires this reading.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3">(3) The two views represented in this passage originate in the meaning given to the suffix of the verb <italic>covered</italic> which can signify &#x2018;him&#x2019; or &#x2018;it&#x2019;. R. Jose is of the opinion that immediately after the declaration of the Ten Commandments, which occurred on the sixth day of Sivan, Moses was enveloped by a Divine Cloud and thereby underwent a seven-day period of purification before he could ascend the mount and approach the Divine Presence for his forty days&#x2019; stay. A similar purification was prescribed in Temple times for the High Priest before entering upon the ritual of the Day of Atonement. R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba, on the other hand, holds that the Cloud covered the mountain and not Moses. Moses was not required to undergo a period of purification, because the call to him to ascend the mount came to him on the seventh day of the month counting from the day on which Israel arrived in the wilderness of Sinai (cf. Ex. XIX, 1). The call to Moses from among the assembly of Israel was merely a mark of honour, to show that he stood high above the congregation. Cf. Yoma 4aff (Sonc. ed., pp. 13ff).

As Eleazar, Aaron&#x2019;s son, acted in this matter on the instruction and under the direction of Moses, the whole ritual is referable to Moses, and on that account it was effective for all future generations.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn22">(22) The Heb. for <italic>copied out</italic> (<italic>he &#x2018;eti&#x1E33;u</italic>) may also be derived from a root meaning &#x2018;to grow old, to spend much time&#x2019;; hence the suggested interpretation &#x2018;pondered over, deliberated&#x2019;. The proverbs were studied for a long time and their meaning elucidated.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn23">(23) Giving the Heb. verb <italic>he&#x2019;eti&#x1E33;u</italic> the sense of &#x2018;moving from a place&#x2019; as in Gen. XII, 8; hence bringing out the work from its place of concealment to the light of day. The interpretation is also borne by the late Heb. verb <italic>perash</italic> used by Abba Saul; cf. Reifmann in <italic>Keneset Hagedolah</italic> I, p. 91. According to Finkelstein, <italic>op. cit.</italic>, p. 126, <italic>perash</italic> here signifies &#x2018;they put aside&#x2019; for concealment and burial.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn39">(39) The usual meaning given to the maxim &#x2018;make a fence&#x2019; is that the Rabbis added restrictions and further severities to the Torah to avoid the infringement of the commandment. The examples cited, however, as illustrations of those who &#x2018;made fences&#x2019;, differ in character from each other and do not conform to the pattern of the traditional definition. The older and perhaps original meaning of the maxim was an injunction to the Rabbis to explain and present the reasons for their decision, thereby safeguarding it against ridicule and rejection. It is in this sense that God made a fence to His words. As a development of the original meaning of the maxim was the exhortation to the Rabbis to express the power of God in a form intelligible to human beings; this was the &#x2018;fence&#x2019; adopted by the Prophets. The other examples of &#x2018;fences&#x2019; are additional prohibitions in the usual sense. For a detailed discussion on this subject, cf. the essays of Finkelstein in <italic>Journal of Biblical Literature</italic>, vol. LVII (1938), pp. 13-50, and vol. LIX (1940), pp. 455-469.</ftnote>

Cf. the parallel passage in <italic>&#x2019;Aboth d&#x2019;Rabbi Nathan</italic>, Recension II, ed. Schechter, p. 3.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn43">(43) A difficult passage with the text in an uncertain state.

The Meiri in his commentary on Aboth explains the last sentence to mean that God prescribed in His Torah only such laws as were acceptable to man and within the capacity of human activity, and did not lay upon His creatures impossible demands. In this way mankind was afforded an opportunity of drawing a full reward.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER II</title>
<p label="1.">What fence did the Torah make to her words? It is stated, <italic>And thou shalt not approach unto a woman &#x2026; as long as she is impure by her uncleanness</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn100">1</xref></sup> It might be supposed that he may embrace or kiss her, or engage with her in frivolous talk; the text therefore declares, <italic>Thou shalt not approach</italic>. It might be further supposed that he may sleep with her if she is clothed in the one bed; the text therefore declares, <italic>Thou shalt not approach</italic>. Again it might be supposed that she may wash her face and paint her eyes; the text therefore declares, <italic>And of her that is sick with her impurity</italic><sup><xref rid="fn101">2</xref></sup>&#x2014;all the days of her impurity she shall be in banishment [from society].<sup><xref rid="fn102">3</xref></sup> Hence [the Sages] said: Every woman who makes herself unattractive during the period of her impurity wins the approbation of the Rabbis, and she who adorns herself during the period of her impurity incurs their censure.</p>
<p label="2.">The story is told<sup><xref rid="fn103">4</xref></sup> of a certain man who had read much Scripture, studied much Mishnah, and had attended on many scholars, yet had died in the midst of his days. His wife used to take his <italic>tefillin</italic>, carry them round the Synagogues and Houses of Study, and weepingly complain, &#x2018;Masters, is it not written in your Torah, <italic>That is thy life, and the length of thy days?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn104">5</xref></sup> Why, then, did my husband die in the midst of his days, he who read much Scripture, studied much Mishnah, and attended on many scholars?&#x2019; There was no one who could answer her. One day, Elijah, of blessed memory, met her and said to her, &#x2018;My daughter, why do you weep and complain?&#x2019; She replied, &#x2018;My husband had read much Scripture, studied much Mishnah and attended on many scholars; yet he died in the midst of his days&#x2019;. He asked her, &#x2018;During the first three days of your impurity what was his relationship towards you?&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn105">6</xref></sup> She said to him &#x2018;Master, God forbid&#x0021; He did not touch me even with his little finger, but used to say to me, &#x201C;Touch no vessel lest you bring me into a state of doubt&#x201D; &#x2019;. &#x2018;And what was his relationship towards you during the latter days of your impurity?&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn106">7</xref></sup> She replied, &#x2018;Master, I ate and drank with him, slept with him<sup><xref rid="fn107">8</xref></sup> in the one bed with our bodies touching, but he had no other intention&#x2019;. Whereupon Elijah said to her, &#x2018;Blessed be the All-present for slaying him, since it is written in the Torah, <italic>And thou shalt not approach unto a woman &#x2026; as long as she is impure by her uncleanness</italic>.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn108">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is stated, <italic>None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn109">10</xref></sup> hence [the Sages] said: Let no man remain alone with a woman at an inn, even though she be his sister or daughter, on account of public opinion. Let no man converse with a woman in the market-place, not even with his wife and needless to say with another woman, on account of public gossip. Let no man walk behind a woman in the market-place, not even behind his wife and needless to say behind another woman, on account of public gossip.</p>
<p>It is stated here,<sup><xref rid="fn110">11</xref></sup> <italic>None of you shall approach</italic>, and it is stated there, <italic>Thou shalt not approach;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn111">12</xref></sup> do not therefore approach to any conduct which may lead to transgression.<sup><xref rid="fn112">13</xref></sup> Keep aloof from anything hideous or from whatever seems hideous.<sup><xref rid="fn113">14</xref></sup> Accordingly the Sages said: Keep aloof from a trivial sin lest it lead you on to a grave sin. Run to perform a minor precept for it will lead you on to an important precept.</p>
<p>It is stated, <italic>Thy belly is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn114">15</xref></sup> <italic>Thy belly is like a heap of wheat</italic>&#x2014;this describes the congregation of Israel;<sup><xref rid="fn115">16</xref></sup> <italic>set about with lilies</italic>&#x2014;these are the seventy elders.<sup><xref rid="fn116">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation of <italic>Thy belly is like a heap of wheat</italic> [<italic>set about with lilies</italic>]&#x2014;these are those light precepts<sup><xref rid="fn117">18</xref></sup> which are as tender as a hedge of lilies and through their observance by Israel lead them to life in the world to come. How is this so? A man&#x2019;s wife is at home with him during the period of her impurity. He could have intimacy with her or not at his will, since no man sees him and no man knows of it to rebuke him. Hence he fears only Him Who ordained the law of [the uncleanness of women. Similarly if a man suffers a seminal emission, he may immerse himself or not as he will, since no man sees him and no man knows of it to rebuke him. Hence He fears only Him Who ordained the law of] immersion.<sup><xref rid="fn118">19</xref></sup> You may reason similarly with the law of the dough-offering<sup><xref rid="fn119">20</xref></sup> and the law of the first of the fleece.<sup><xref rid="fn120">21</xref></sup> Such are the light precepts which are as tender as lilies and through their observance by Israel lead them to life in the world to come.</p>
<p label="3.">What fence did Moses make to his words? It is stated, <italic>And the Lord said unto Moses: Go unto the people, and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn121">22</xref></sup> Now the righteous Moses was not willing to tell it to Israel in the manner in which the Holy One, blessed be He, spoke to him, but said to them, <italic>Be ready against the third day; come not near a woman</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn122">23</xref></sup> Thus Moses added a third day for them of his own accord, because Moses reasoned as follows, &#x2018;If a man will cohabit with his wife and on the third day the seed will issue from her they will become unclean,<sup><xref rid="fn123">24</xref></sup> and in consequence Israel<sup><xref rid="fn124">25</xref></sup> would receive the Torah from Mount Sinai in a state of defilement. I will therefore add a third day for them, so that no man will cohabit with his wife<sup><xref rid="fn125">26</xref></sup> and there will be no fear of the seed issuing from her. All will be clean, and in consequence [the women of] Israel will receive the Torah from Mount Sinai in a state of cleanness&#x2019;.</p>
<p>This<sup><xref rid="fn126">27</xref></sup> is one of the things which Moses did of his own accord, reasoning by <italic>a fortiori</italic> argument, and his decision conformed to the will of the All-present.<sup><xref rid="fn127">28</xref></sup> He broke the tablets, and this act of his accorded with the will of the All-present; he kept away from the Tent of Meeting, and this act of his accorded with the will of the All-present; he separated from his wife, and this act of his accorded with the will of the All-present.</p>
<p>[&#x2018;He separated from his wife, and this act of his accorded with the will of the All-present.&#x2019;] How was this? He reasoned as follows: If with regard to the Israelites, who were sanctified for a short period only and summoned for the sole purpose of receiving the Ten Commandments at Mount Sinai, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to me, <italic>Go unto the people, and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn128">29</xref></sup> I, who am in readiness for the purpose [of receiving] the word of God daily and hourly, since I know not when He will speak with me, whether by day or by night, must all the more separate myself from a woman&#x0021; And his decision accorded with the will of the All-present.<sup><xref rid="fn129">30</xref></sup> R. Judah b. Bathyra said: Moses did not separate from his wife until he was ordered to do so by the Almighty, as it is stated, <italic>With him do I speak mouth to mouth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn130">31</xref></sup>&#x2014;by a <italic>mouth-to-mouth</italic> order I commanded him to separate from his wife, and he did so. Others interpret in this way: Moses did not separate from his wife until he was ordered to do so by the [18<italic>b</italic>] Almighty, as it is stated, <italic>Go say to them: Return ye to your tents;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn131">32</xref></sup> and after that it is written, <italic>But as for thee, stand thou here by Me</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn132">33</xref></sup> Moses then turned about<sup><xref rid="fn133">34</xref></sup> and separated from his wife, and in so doing he was in accord with the will of the All-present.</p>
<p>&#x2018;He kept away from the Tent of Meeting.&#x2019; How was this? He reasoned as follows: &#x2018;If in connection with my brother Aaron, who has been anointed with the anointing oil, clothed in the additional vestments of the High-priesthood and ministers therein in holiness, the Holy One, blessed be He, admonished, <italic>Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy place;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn134">35</xref></sup> I, who have not been ordained for the purpose, must all the more keep away from the Tent of Meeting&#x2019;. He kept away from the Tent of Meeting and in so doing he was in accord with the will of the All-present.<sup><xref rid="fn135">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x2018;He broke the tablets.&#x2019; How was this? It is related that when Moses ascended on high to receive the tablets which had been inscribed and were lying in readiness [to be revealed] since the six days of creation,<sup><xref rid="fn136">37</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven</italic> [&#x1E25;aruth] <italic>upon the tables</italic><sup><xref rid="fn137">38</xref></sup>&#x2014;read not <italic>&#x1E25;aruth</italic> [graven] but <italic>&#x1E25;eruth</italic> [freedom], for only he is truly free who occupies himself with the Torah<sup><xref rid="fn138">39</xref></sup>&#x2014;at that time the ministering angels arraigned Moses, saying, &#x2018;Lord of the universe&#x0021; <italic>What is man, that Thou art mindful of him? And the son of man, that Thou thinkest of him? Yet Thou hast made him but little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour. Thou hast made him to have dominion over the works of Thy hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet: sheep and oxen, all of them, yea, and the beasts of the field; the fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea&#x2019;</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn139">40</xref></sup> They were referring disparagingly to Moses, saying, &#x2018;What virtue is there in man born of woman that he has ascended on high, as it is stated, <italic>Thou art ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive, thou hast received gifts?</italic>&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn140">41</xref></sup> Moses took the tablets and descended with them, rejoicing exceedingly. But as soon as he saw the depravity with which they had depraved themselves in the episode of the calf, he said to himself, &#x2018;How can I give them the tablets, thereby binding them to the performance of weighty commandments, and in consequence condemning them [if they disobeyed] to death before Heaven, for it is written therein, <italic>Thou shalt have no other gods before Me?</italic>&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn141">42</xref></sup> He turned back, but when the seventy elders saw this they hurried after him. He seized one end of the tablets while they seized the other end, but the strength of Moses prevailed over theirs, as it is stated, <italic>And in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror, which Moses wrought in the sight of all Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn142">43</xref></sup> He glanced at the tablets and saw that the writing had flown from them; so he exclaimed, &#x2018;How can I give Israel these worthless tablets? I will grasp hold of them and break them, as it is stated, <italic>And I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn143">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Jose the Galilean said: I will illustrate this to you by a parable. To what can the matter be compared? To a human king who ordered his agent, &#x2018;Go and betroth for me a beautiful, graceful and well-behaved maiden&#x2019;. The agent went and performed the betrothal. After the betrothal he discovered that she was unfaithful with another.

In the same way did the righteous Moses reason to himself, &#x2018;How can I now give Israel the tablets, binding them thereby to the performance of weighty commandments, and in consequence condemning them [if they disobeyed] to death, for it is written therein, <italic>He that sacrificeth unto the gods, save unto the Lord only, shall be utterly destroyed?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn146">47</xref></sup> I will rather seize the tablets and break them, and lead Israel back to the right way.

<p>R. Judah b.

Should he, however, say, &#x2018;I am sure of myself, and even though I go among them I will not stumble through them&#x2019;; or should he say, &#x2018;I will hear their words and then come away&#x2019;?

<ftnote id="fn102">(3) The Heb. <span dir="rtl">&#x05E0;&#x05D3;&#x05D4;</span>, &#x2018;a woman in her impurity&#x2019;, is here connected with its original meaning of &#x2018;cast out, banished from society&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn103">(4) Quoted from Shab. 13a, b (Sonc. ed., p. 53) with some variants.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn104">(5) Deut. XXX, 20.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn105">(6) The number &#x2018;three&#x2019; found in V is difficult to explain, as the woman&#x2019;s impurity continues, according to Biblical law, for a minimum period of seven days. Consequently there is no ground for drawing a distinction between the first three and the subsequent days. Most scholars, following GRA, substitute &#x2018;seven&#x2019; for &#x2018;three&#x2019;, and the reference is to the monthly period of uncleanness. The &#x2018;latter days of impurity&#x2019; would be, what is known in Talmudic phraseology, &#x2018;the days of white garments&#x2019;, i.e. the seven days of observation after the. cessation of the discharge. During this period a woman is forbidden by Rabbinic law all intimacy with her husband, including acts of endearment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn106">(7) In Shab. 13a the text reads: &#x2018;during the days of your white garments&#x2019;. Cf. the preceding note.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn107">(8) V adds &#x2018;in my clothes&#x2019; which is omitted in the Talmudic version and appears incompatible with the following words, &#x2018;with our bodies touching&#x2019;.

<ftnote id="fn133">(34) A strange expression in this context. The meaning seems to be that Moses extended the temporary restriction to all the days of his life, and this met with God&#x2019;s approval. Cf. the second recension on this passage in Schechter&#x2019;s ed., p. 10.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER III</title>
<p label="1.">R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: He who takes a <italic>peru&#x1E6D;ah</italic> from charity when not in need of it will not depart from this world before he falls in need of his fellow-men. He also said: He who wraps rags over his eyes or about his loins, and cries, &#x2018;Help the blind&#x0021; Help the leper&#x0021;&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn196">1</xref></sup> will in the end cry so in earnest. He also said: He who throws his bread to the ground, or scatters his money in his anger, will not depart from this world before he falls in need of his fellow-men.</p>
<p label="2.">He also said: He who tears his clothes in his anger or breaks his vessels in his rage, will in the end worship idols; for such is the device of the evil inclination: to-day it bids man, &#x2018;Tear your clothes&#x2019; and to-morrow it bids him, &#x2018;Worship idols&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn197">2</xref></sup></p>
<p label="3.">He also said: He who hopes for the death of his wife that he may inherit her property or that he may marry her sister, or hopes for the death of his brother<sup><xref rid="fn198">3</xref></sup> that he may marry the widow, will surely be survived by them.<sup><xref rid="fn199">4</xref></sup> Concerning such a person Scripture states, <italic>He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it, and whoso breaketh through a fence, a serpent shall bite him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn200">5</xref></sup></p>
<p label="4.">The story is told<sup><xref rid="fn201">6</xref></sup> of a certain man who, in contravention of R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba&#x2019;s teaching, unloosed a woman&#x2019;s hair in the marketplace. When the woman came before R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba he ordered the man to pay her the sum of four hundred <italic>zuz</italic>. The man said, &#x2018;Rabbi, give me time to pay&#x2019;, and he agreed. [When the man had come out] a friend of his said to him, &#x2018;I will advise you how you will not have to pay her even one <italic>peru&#x1E33;ah</italic>&#x2019;. &#x2018;Do advise me&#x2019;, said the man; and the friend said, &#x2018;Go and take oil to the value of an <italic>issar</italic>, and break the jar in front of the door of that woman&#x2019;. [He did so.] What did the woman do? She came out of her house, unloosed her hair in the open street, scooped up [the oil with her hand], and then laid her hand on her head.<sup><xref rid="fn202">7</xref></sup> The man had arranged witnesses against her, and he proceeded before R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba and said, &#x2018;To such a worthless woman must I pay four hundred <italic>zuz?</italic> For the sake of oil worth an <italic>issar</italic> she lost all self-respect, came out of her house, unloosed her hair in the open street, scooped up the oil, and then laid her hand on her head&#x0021;&#x2019; R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba replied, &#x2018;Your words prove nothing. For he who wounds himself, though he is not permitted to do so, is free from liability, whereas if others wounded him they are liable. If this woman wounds herself she is free from liability, but you, having wounded her, must pay her four hundred <italic>zuz</italic>&#x2019;.</p>
<p label="5.">R. Dosethai b. R. Jannai said: If you have prepared your soil<sup><xref rid="fn203">8</xref></sup> and sown your seed at the first rainfall<sup><xref rid="fn204">9</xref></sup> go and sow again at the second rainfall, lest hail fall in the world and the first sowing will be affected while the second sowing may endure, <italic>for thou knowest not which shall prosper, whether this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good</italic><sup><xref rid="fn205">10</xref></sup> or both alike bad, as it is stated, <italic>In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thy hand</italic>. If you have prepared your soil and sown your seed at the first and second rainfalls, go and sow again at the third rainfall, lest a blight come upon the world and the early sowings will be blasted while the late sowing may endure, as it is stated, <italic>For thou knowest not which shall prosper, whether this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good</italic>, as it is stated, <italic>In the morning sow thy seed</italic>, etc.</p>
<p label="6.">R. Ishmael b. R. Jose said: Study Torah in your old age. If you have studied Torah in your youth, say not, &#x2018;I will not study in my old age&#x2019;; but continue studying <italic>for thou knowest not which shall prosper</italic>. If you studied in a time of wealth do not leave off<sup><xref rid="fn206">11</xref></sup> in a time of poverty; if in a time of plenty do not leave off in a time of famine; if in a time of ease do not leave off in a time of hardship; because one word [learnt] by a man in adversity is more precious to him than a hundred learnt in prosperity, as it is stated, <italic>In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thy hand</italic>.</p>
<p>R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: If you have studied Torah in your youth, study it also in your old age, and say not, &#x2018;I will not study Torah in my old age&#x2019;, <italic>for thou knowest not which shall prosper</italic>, whether both will remain with you, <italic>or whether they both shall be alike good</italic>, as it is stated, <italic>In the morning sow thy seed</italic>, etc.</p>
<p>R. Meir said: If you have studied under one teacher, say not, &#x2018;It is enough for me&#x2019;; but go to [another] scholar and study Torah under him. Go not, however, to anyone, but to him who is akin to you from the outset,<sup><xref rid="fn207">12</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn208">13</xref></sup> It is incumbent upon a man to attend upon three scholars [19<italic>b</italic>] such as R. Eliezer, R. Joshua and R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba, as it is stated, <italic>Happy is the man that hearkeneth to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my door</italic><sup><xref rid="fn209">14</xref></sup>&#x2014;read not <italic>my gates</italic> but &#x2018;the door of my gates&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn210">15</xref></sup> For<sup><xref rid="fn211">16</xref></sup> you know not whether both will remain with you <italic>or whether they both shall be alike good</italic>, as it is stated, <italic>In the morning sow thy seed</italic>, etc.</p>
<p>R. Joshua said: Take a wife in your youth and take a wife in your old age; beget children in your youth and beget children in your old age. Say not, &#x2018;I will no more take a wife&#x2019;, but take her and beget sons and daughters and increase your offspring on the earth, because you know not whether both<sup><xref rid="fn212">17</xref></sup> will remain with you <italic>or whether both shall be alike good</italic>, as it is stated, <italic>In the morning sow thy seed</italic>, etc.</p>
<p label="7.">He used to say: If you have given a <italic>peru&#x1E6D;ah</italic> to a poor man in the morning, and there comes to you in the evening another poor man asking for alms, give to him also, because you know not whether both<sup><xref rid="fn213">18</xref></sup> will remain with you <italic>or whether they both shall be alike good</italic>, as it is stated, <italic>In the morning sow thy seed</italic>, etc.</p>
<p label="8.">The story is told<sup><xref rid="fn214">19</xref></sup> of a certain pious man who, in a year of drought, gave a poor man a <italic>dinar</italic>. His wife scolded him for it; so he went and passed the night in a cemetery. There he overheard two spirits conversing with one another. &#x2018;Come, my dear,&#x2019; said one to her companion, &#x2018;let us wander about the world and find out what calamity is about to come upon the world.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn215">20</xref></sup> The other replied, &#x2018;My dear, I cannot go forth because I am buried in a matting of reeds;<sup><xref rid="fn216">21</xref></sup> but you go and tell me whatever you hear&#x2019;. She departed and on her return was asked, &#x2018;Did you hear from behind the curtain<sup><xref rid="fn217">22</xref></sup> what calamity is about to come upon the world?&#x2019; She replied, &#x2018;I heard that whoever sows at the first rainfall will have his crops smitten by hail&#x2019;. The man went and sowed at the second rainfall, with the result that everybody&#x2019;s crop was smitten but his was not. The following year he again went and passed the night in the cemetery and overheard the same two spirits conversing with one another. &#x2018;Come,&#x2019; said one to her companion, &#x2018;let us wander about the world and find out what calamity is about to come upon the world.&#x2019; The other replied, &#x2018;My dear, have I not previously told you that I cannot go forth because I am buried in a matting of reeds? You go, and tell me whatever you hear&#x2019;. She departed and on her return her companion asked her, &#x2018;Did you hear anything from behind the curtain?&#x2019; She replied, &#x2018;I heard that whoever sows at the second rainfall will have his crops blasted&#x2019;. He went and sowed at the first rainfall. When the blight came into the world, everybody&#x2019;s crop was blasted but his was not. His wife asked him, &#x2018;How was it that when the calamity came into the world, everybody&#x2019;s crops were smitten and blasted but yours were not?&#x2019; He told her the whole story. After a time a quarrel broke out between that pious man&#x2019;s wife and the mother of the young woman,<sup><xref rid="fn218">23</xref></sup> and the former said to the other, &#x2018;Come and I will show you your daughter buried in a matting of reeds&#x0021;&#x2019; The following year the man went and spent the night in the cemetery and overheard those two spirits conversing with one another. One said, &#x2018;Come, my dear, let us wander about the world and listen to what is said behind the curtain&#x2019;. But her companion replied, &#x2018;My dear, leave me alone; what has passed between you and me has in the past been overheard by the living&#x2019;.</p>
<p label="9.">It is told of a certain pious man who was in the habit of dispensing charity that he was once travelling in a ship when a storm arose and the ship was sunk in the sea. R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba who witnessed [the tragedy] came before the Beth Din to testify on behalf of the wife to enable her to remarry. Before the time came for him to testify, that pious man entered and stood before him. R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said to him, &#x2018;You are the man who was drowned at sea&#x2019;. &#x2018;Yes, I am,&#x2019; he replied. &#x2018;And who brought you up from the sea?&#x2019; asked R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba. He answered, &#x2018;The charity which I dispensed brought me up from the sea&#x2019;. &#x2018;How do you know it?&#x2019; asked R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba. He replied, &#x2018;When I went down to the nethermost depths, I heard a mighty roaring of the waves calling one to the other, &#x201C;Hurry and let us bring up this man from the sea because he dispensed charity all his days&#x201D; &#x2019;. At this R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba began [to praise] saying, &#x2018;Blessed be God, the God of Israel, Who has chosen the words of the Torah and the sayings of the wise; for the words of the Torah and the sayings of the wise endure for ever and to all eternity, as it is stated, <italic>Cast thy bread upon the waters, for thou shalt find it after many days</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn219">24</xref></sup> It is also written, <italic>Charity delivereth from death</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn220">25</xref></sup></p>
<p label="10.">It is told<sup><xref rid="fn221">26</xref></sup> of Benjamin the Just, who was the overseer of the charity fund, that one day a woman came to him and said, &#x2018;Master, assist me&#x2019;. He replied, &#x2018;By the Temple Service, there is nothing left in the charity fund&#x2019;. She said, &#x2018;Master, if you do not assist me, I perish with my four<sup><xref rid="fn222">27</xref></sup> children&#x2019;. He thereupon assisted her from his own purse. After a time Benjamin the Just fell ill and lay in pain on his bed. The ministering angels addressed the Holy One, blessed be He, saying, &#x2018;Sovereign of the universe, Thou hast said that whoever saves a single soul in Israel is deemed as though he had saved alive the whole world.<sup><xref rid="fn223">28</xref></sup> How much greater must be the merit of Benjamin the Just who saved alive a widow and her four children&#x0021; He is now on his bed suffering much pain in his sickness&#x2019;. Thus they sought mercy on his behalf and the decree against him was annulled, twenty-two years being added to his life.</p>

<title>CHAPTER IV</title>
<p label="1."><small>SIMON THE</small> J<small>UST WAS ONE OF THE LAST SURVIVORS OF THE GREAT ASSEMBLY. HE USED TO SAY: UPON THREE THINGS THE WORLD IS BASED: UPON THE TORAH, UPON THE TEMPLE SERVICE, AND UPON THE PRACTICE OF LOVINGKINDNESS</small>.</p>
<p><small>UPON THE TORAH</small>&#x2014;how is this? It states, <italic>For I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God rather than burnt-offerings</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn224">1</xref></sup> Hence one may infer that of all sacrifices the burnt-offering is the most acceptable since it is entirely consumed by fire, as it is stated, <italic>And the priest shall make the whole smoke on the altar, for a burnt-offering</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn225">2</xref></sup> In another passage it states, <italic>And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt-offering unto the Lord</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn226">3</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the study of Torah is even more acceptable to the All-present than burnt-offerings, since if a man studies Torah he knows the will of the All-present, as it is stated, <italic>Then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find out the will of God</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn227">4</xref></sup> Hence it follows that when a scholar sits and expounds the Torah in an assembly, Scripture accounts it to him as though he had offered the fat and the blood [of a sacrifice] upon the altar.</p>
<p>Should<sup><xref rid="fn228">5</xref></sup> two scholars be sitting engaged in the study of the Torah, and a bridal procession or a cort&#x00E8;ge passes by them, if there are sufficient people present to attend to the needs of the occasion,<sup><xref rid="fn229">6</xref></sup> let them not interrupt their studies; otherwise it is their duty to rise and cheer<sup><xref rid="fn230">7</xref></sup> and applaud the bride or accompany the dead to the grave.</p>
<p label="2.">It once happened that R. Judah b. Ilai was sitting and lecturing to his disciples when a bride passed before him. At once he took in his hand what was usual for the occasion,<sup><xref rid="fn231">8</xref></sup> and cheered<sup><xref rid="fn232">9</xref></sup> the bride until she had passed by.</p>
<p label="3.">On another occasion while R. Judah b. Ilai was sitting and lecturing to his disciples, a bride passed before him. &#x2018;What was that?&#x2019; he asked, and they replied, &#x2018;A bridal party&#x2019;. He said to them, &#x2018;My sons, arise and attend to the bride, for so we find that the Holy One, blessed be He, attended to a bride, as it is stated, <italic>And the Lord God built up the rib</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn233">10</xref></sup> And if He attended to a bride, how much more should we do so&#x0021;&#x2019; Where do we find that the Holy One, blessed be He, attended to a bride? For it is stated, <italic>And the Lord God built up the rib;</italic> and in coastal towns a bride is referred to as <italic>ben&#x2019;itha</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn234">11</xref></sup> Hence we learn that the Holy One, blessed be He, equipped Eve, adorned her as a bride and conducted her to Adam, as it is stated, <italic>And He brought her unto Adam</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn235">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>On one occasion only did the Holy One, blessed be He, act as a groomsman to man; thereafter a man provides his own groomsman, as it is stated, <italic>Bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn236">13</xref></sup> On one occasion only was the wife formed out of the man;<sup><xref rid="fn237">14</xref></sup> thereafter a man takes the daughter of his fellow to wife.</p>
<p label="4."><small>UPON THE TEMPLE SERVICE</small>&#x2014;how is this? As long as the Temple Service continued, the world was a source of blessing to its inhabitants and the rains fell [20<italic>a</italic>] in their seasons, as it is stated, <italic>To love the Lord your God, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul, that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain&#x2026;. And I will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn238">15</xref></sup> But when the Temple Service ceased, the world was no longer a source of blessing to its inhabitants and the rains did not fall in their season, as it is stated, <italic>Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived &#x2026; and He shut up the heaven, so that there shall be no rain</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn239">16</xref></sup> And it also declares in the Book of Haggai, <italic>I pray you, consider from this day and forward&#x2014;before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the Lord, through all that time, when one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were but ten; when one came to the winevat to draw out fifty measures, there were but twenty</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn240">17</xref></sup> Why does not the verse also state in regard to the winevat &#x2018;to draw out twenty measures, there were but ten&#x2019; as it does in regard to the wheat? Because the winevat is a significant omen, more so than wheat, thus teaching you that whenever the yield of wine is affected it is a bad omen for the whole year. [At that time] Israel said to the Holy One, blessed be He, &#x2018;Sovereign of the universe&#x0021; Why hast Thou done this to us?&#x2019; And the Divine Spirit replied, &#x2018;<italic>Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came to little &#x2026; Because of My house that lieth waste, while ye run every man for his own house</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn241">18</xref></sup> But if you will devote yourselves to the service of the Temple, I will bless you as formerly, as it is stated, <italic>Consider, I pray you &#x2026; from the four-and-twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of the Lord&#x2019;s temple was laid &#x2026; Is the seed yet in the barn?

<p label="5."><small>UPON THE PRACTICE OF LOVINGKINDNESS</small>&#x2014;how is this? Scripture states, <italic>I desire lovingkindness and not sacrifice</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn243">20</xref></sup> In the beginning the world was created by lovingkindness alone, as it is stated, <italic>For I have said: The world is built by lovingkindness; Thou dost establish the heavens with Thy faithfulness</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn244">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>It happened once that Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Zakkai was coming out of Jerusalem, followed by R. Joshua, and he beheld the Temple in ruins. &#x2018;Woe to us,&#x2019; cried R. Joshua, &#x2018;for this house that lies in ruins, the place where atonement was made for the sins of Israel&#x0021;&#x2019; Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan said to him, &#x2018;My son, be not grieved, for we have another means of atonement which is as effective, and that is, the practice of lovingkindness, as it is stated, <italic>For I desire lovingkindness and not sacrifice</italic>&#x2019;. And so we find it with Daniel, the man greatly beloved, who devoted himself to acts of lovingkindness. What were the acts of lovingkindness to which Daniel devoted himself? If you say that he offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings in Babylon, had it not been previously ordained, <italic>Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt-offerings in every place that thou seest; but in the place which the Lord shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn245">22</xref></sup> What, then, were the acts of lovingkindness to which he devoted himself? He provided for the bride and made her to rejoice, he attended the dead to the grave, he gave alms to the poor, and prayed three times daily, and his prayer was accepted with favour, as it is stated, <italic>And when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house&#x2014;now his windows were open in his upper chamber toward Jerusalem&#x2014;and he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn246">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>When<sup><xref rid="fn247">24</xref></sup> Vespasian came to destroy Jerusalem, he proclaimed [to its inhabitants], &#x2018;Fools, why do you seek to destroy this city and burn the Temple? What do I demand of you? Merely that you deliver to me one bow or one arrow<sup><xref rid="fn248">25</xref></sup> and then I will depart from you&#x2019;. They answered him, &#x2018;As we went forth against your two predecessors<sup><xref rid="fn249">26</xref></sup> and slew them, so we will go out against you and slay you&#x2019;. When Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Zakkai heard this, he sent for the men of Jerusalem and said to them, &#x2018;My sons, why would you destroy this city and burn the Temple? What does he demand of you? Merely one bow or one arrow, and then he will depart from you&#x2019;. They answered him, &#x2018;As we went forth against his two predecessors and slew them, so we will go out against him and slay him&#x2019;.</p>
<p>Now Vespasian had some men of his resident [within and] close to the walls of Jerusalem, and whatever they heard they wrote upon an arrow which they shot beyond the wall. [In this manner] they reported that Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Zakkai was among Caesar&#x2019;s friends. So Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Zakkai appealed to the men of Jerusalem. After he had pleaded with them for several days<sup><xref rid="fn250">27</xref></sup> and they would not agree with him, he sent for his disciples, R. Eliezer and R. Joshua, and said to them, &#x2018;My sons, arise and carry me forth from here. Make a coffin for me and I will lie in it&#x2019;. [They did so, and] R. Eliezer took hold of it at the head and R. Joshua at the foot, and they carried him until sunset when they arrived at the gates of Jerusalem. The gatekeepers asked, &#x2018;What is this?&#x2019; They replied, &#x2018;A dead man; do you not know that a corpse may not be kept overnight in Jerusalem?&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn251">28</xref></sup> They said, &#x2018;If it is a corpse, carry it out&#x2019;. They carried it out (and bore it until sunset)<sup><xref rid="fn252">29</xref></sup> when they arrived before Vespasian, opened the coffin and [Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan] stood before him. He asked, &#x2018;You are Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Zakkai? Ask what I shall give you&#x2019;. He replied, &#x2018;I ask for nothing but Jabneh whither I may go and teach my disciples, where I can institute prayers,<sup><xref rid="fn253">30</xref></sup> and observe all the commandments prescribed in the Torah&#x2019;. He said to him, &#x2018;Go and do all that you wish to perform&#x2019;. Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan then said, &#x2018;May I be permitted to say a word to you?&#x2019; &#x2018;Speak,&#x2019; he said. Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan then said, &#x2018;You are about to become Emperor&#x2019;. &#x2018;How do you know this?&#x2019; he asked, and Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan replied, &#x2018;There is a tradition with us that the Temple will not be delivered into the hand of a common soldier but to a king, as it is stated, <italic>And He shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one</italic>&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn254">31</xref></sup> It is related that a few days had not elapsed before there came to him a despatch<sup><xref rid="fn255">32</xref></sup> from his city [Rome], informing him that Caesar had died, and he had been elected Emperor. They brought to him a battering-ram which he directed<sup><xref rid="fn256">33</xref></sup> towards the wall of Jerusalem. Then they brought to him logs of cedar which he inserted in the battering-ram and hurled at the wall until he breached it. They then brought to him a pig&#x2019;s head which he inserted in the battering-ram and shot it on to the sacrificial limbs that were upon the altar. At that moment Jerusalem was captured. Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan was sitting and anxiously waiting for news, as Eli had sat and waited for news, as it is stated, <italic>Lo, Eli sat upon his seat by the wayside, watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn257">34</xref></sup> As soon as Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Zakkai heard that Jerusalem was destroyed and the Temple in flames, he rent his clothes, his disciples also rent their clothes, and they wept and cried out and lamented.</p>
<p>Scripture states,<sup><xref rid="fn258">35</xref></sup> <italic>Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn259">36</xref></sup> This alludes to the chief priests who were in the Temple, took their keys in their hands and hurled them upwards, exclaiming before the Holy One, blessed be He, &#x2018;Lord of the universe&#x0021; here are Thy keys which Thou didst entrust to us, seeing that we have not been faithful treasurers to discharge the duties imposed by the King, and we are no longer worthy to eat from the King&#x2019;s table&#x2019;.</p>
<p>The patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and the twelve tribes also wept and cried out and lamented, saying, <italic>Wail, O cypress-tree, for the cedar is fallen, because the glorious ones are spoiled;</italic> [<italic>wail, O ye oaks of Bashan, for the strong forest is come down</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn260">37</xref></sup> <italic>Wail, O cypress-tree, for the cedar is fallen</italic> refers to the Temple; <italic>because the glorious ones are spoiled</italic> refers to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and the twelve tribes; <italic>wail, O ye oaks of Bashan</italic> refers to Moses, Aaron and Miriam; <italic>for the strong forest is come down</italic> refers to the Holy of Holies. <italic>Hark&#x0021; the wailing of the shepherds, for their glory is spoiled</italic><sup><xref rid="fn261">38</xref></sup> refers to David and his son Solomon. <italic>Hark&#x0021; the roaring of young lions, for the thickets of the Jordan are spoiled</italic> refers to Elijah and Elisha.</p>
<p label="6.">In three things did the Holy One, blessed be He, make human beings to differ one from the other: in voice, in temperament<sup><xref rid="fn262">39</xref></sup> and in features.<sup><xref rid="fn263">40</xref></sup> Why in voice? The Holy One, blessed be He, made the voices of men different one from the other; for had He not done so, immorality would have increased in the world, since as soon as a man left his home another might enter and ravish his wife in his own house. Therefore did the Holy One, blessed be He, make men differ from each other in voice, one man&#x2019;s voice being different from his fellow&#x2019;s. Why in temperament? The Holy One, blessed be He, made the temperament of men different one from the other; because had He not done so men would be jealous of each other. Therefore did the Holy One, blessed be He, make mankind differ from one another in temperament, one man&#x2019;s temperament being different from his fellow&#x2019;s. Why in appearance? The Holy One, blessed be He, made the features of human beings different one from another; because had He not done so, the daughters of Israel would not recognize their husbands nor the husbands their wives. Therefore did the Holy One, blessed be He, make them different in facial features.</p>

<p label="1.">A<small>NTIGONOS OF</small> S<small>OCHO RECEIVED THE TRADITION FROM</small> S<small>IMON THE</small> J<small>UST. HE USED TO SAY: BE NOT</small> [20<italic>b</italic>] <small>LIKE SERVANTS WHO SERVE THE MASTER FOR THE SAKE OF RECEIVING A REWARD</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn264">1</xref></sup> <small>BUT BE LIKE SERVANTS WHO SERVE THE MASTER WITHOUT THE EXPECTATION OF RECEIVING A REWARD; AND LET THE FEAR OF HEAVEN BE UPON YOU</small>, in order that your reward may be double in the world to come.<sup><xref rid="fn265">2</xref></sup></p>
<p label="2.">Antigonos of Socho had two disciples<sup><xref rid="fn266">3</xref></sup> who repeated this doctrine to their disciples and their disciples to their disciples. They rose up and examined the matter, saying, &#x2018;Why did our predecessors say this? Is it right for a labourer to toil all day and not receive his reward in the evening? Had our predecessors known that there was another world and that there would be the resurrection of the dead they surely would not have taught thus&#x0021;&#x2019; So they arose and turned away from the Torah. Two sects sprang from them: the Sadducees and the Boeth-usians,<sup><xref rid="fn267">4</xref></sup> the Sadducees named after Zadok and the Boethusians after Boethus. All their lives they used vessels of silver and gold, but not<sup><xref rid="fn268">5</xref></sup> because they were arrogant in mind. The Sadducees said that it was a tradition of the Pharisees to subject themselves to austerity in this world,<sup><xref rid="fn269">6</xref></sup> and in the world to come they possess nothing at all.</p>

It actually contradicts the doctrine of disinterested service.

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER VI</title>
<p label="1.">J<small>OSE B</small>. J<small>OEZER SAID: LET YOUR HOUSE BE A MEETING-HOUSE FOR THE WISE</small>. What is meant by this? It teaches that a man&#x2019;s house should be available to the wise, their disciples, and the disciples of their disciples; in the same manner that a man might say to his fellow, &#x2018;I will wait for you at such and such a place&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn270">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation of <small>LET YOUR HOUSE BE A MEETING-HOUSE FOR THE WISE</small>: this means that when a disciple comes into your presence and says to you, &#x2018;Give me instruction&#x2019;, if it is within your power to teach him, instruct him, but if not dismiss him at once.<sup><xref rid="fn271">2</xref></sup> Moreover, let him not sit before you on a couch or on a chair or on a bench, but on the ground; and every word that you utter he should accept with awe and reverence, with fear and dread.</p>
<p label="2."><small>AND SIT AMIDST THE DUST OF THEIR FEET</small>. What is meant by this? When a scholar comes to a town, say not, &#x2018;I have no need of him&#x2019;; but go to him, and sit not before him on a couch or on a chair or on a bench, but sit before him on the ground; and every word that he utters accept with awe and reverence, with fear and dread, in the same manner that our forefathers received the Torah at Mount Sinai with awe and reverence, with fear and dread.</p>
<p>Another interpretation of <small>AND SIT AMIDST THE DUST OF THEIR FEET</small>&#x2014;as did R. Eliezer; <small>AND DRINK IN THEIR WORDS WITH THIRST</small>&#x2014;as did R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba.</p>
<p>What was the beginning of R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba? It was said of him that at the age of forty he had learnt nothing at all. On one occasion, as he was standing by the mouth of a well, he enquired, &#x2018;Who carved out this stone?&#x2019; They answered, &#x2018;The water which constantly falls on it, day in and day out&#x2019;. They continued, &#x2018; &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba, have you not read the verse, <italic>The waters wear the stones?</italic>&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn272">3</xref></sup> Forthwith R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba applied to himself the following <italic>a fortiori</italic> argument: If the soft [water] can wear away the hard [stone], how much more can the words of the Torah, which are hard like iron, carve a way into my heart which is of flesh and blood&#x0021; Immediately he turned to the study of the Torah. Both he and his son went and sat down before the school-teacher and said to him, &#x2018;Master, teach us the Torah&#x2019;. R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba took hold of the tablet by one end and his son by the other end, and on it the teacher wrote <italic>&#x2019;alef beth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn273">4</xref></sup> which he learnt, <italic>&#x2019;alef taw</italic><sup><xref rid="fn274">5</xref></sup> which he learnt, and then the Book of Leviticus which he also learnt.<sup><xref rid="fn275">6</xref></sup> So he continued to study until he had learnt the whole Torah. He then went and sat before R. Eliezer and R. Joshua and said to them, &#x2018;My masters, initiate me into the reasoning of the Mishnah&#x2019;. As soon as they recited one <italic>halakah</italic> to him, he went away and sat down alone asking himself, &#x2018;Why is <italic>&#x2019;alef</italic> so written? Why is <italic>beth</italic> so written? Why is this stated?&#x2019; He thereupon returned to his masters and asked them, and held them up with his words.</p>
<p>R. Simeon b. Eleazar said, &#x2018;I will illustrate this to you by a parable. To what can this be compared? To a stonemason who was quarrying stones in a mountain. One day he took his pick in his hand, went out and sat on the mountain, and chipped away small stones. When people came and asked him what he was doing, he told them, &#x201C;I mean to uproot the mountain and cast it into the Jordan&#x201D;. They said to him, &#x201C;You cannot possibly uproot the whole mountain&#x201D;. Nevertheless, he continued chipping away until it became the size of a large boulder. He inserted himself beneath it, unloosed it, uprooted it, and cast it into the Jordan, saying, &#x201C;Here is not your place but there&#x201D; &#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn276">7</xref></sup> In this way did R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba glean the knowledge of Torah from<sup><xref rid="fn277">8</xref></sup> R. Eliezer and R. Joshua. R. &#x1E6C;arfon said to him, &#x2018; &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba, it is of you that the verse speaks, <italic>He bindeth the streams that they trickle not; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light</italic>.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn278">9</xref></sup> The things which were hidden from men R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba brought to light.</p>
<p>Every day he used to gather a bundle of wood, half of which he sold to provide food for himself, and the other half he used for his personal needs. His neighbours rose up against him and cried, &#x2018; &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba, you are ruining us with your smoke&#x0021; Come, sell all [the wood] to us, and with the money you can buy oil, and study by the light of an oil lamp&#x2019;. But he replied, &#x2018;I derive many uses from [the wood]: first I study by its light, secondly I keep myself warm by it, and thirdly I am able to sleep on it&#x2019;.</p>
<p>In the Hereafter [the example of] R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba will condemn all the poor; for when they will be charged, &#x2018;Why did you not study Torah?&#x2019; and they plead, &#x2018;Because we were too poor&#x2019;, it will be retorted, &#x2018;Was not R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba very poor and in straitened circumstances?&#x2019; And if they plead, &#x2018;Because of our little children&#x2019;, it will be retorted, &#x2018;Did not R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba have many sons and daughters for whom he had to provide as well as his wife Rachel [and yet he studied the Torah]?&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn279">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>He was forty years old when he started to study Torah and by the end of thirteen years he taught Torah in public. It is said that he did not depart this life before he had enjoyed the luxury of tables of silver and gold, and ascended his bed by golden steps. His wife went out dressed in fine robes<sup><xref rid="fn280">11</xref></sup> and wearing a &#x2018;golden city&#x2019; tiara.<sup><xref rid="fn281">12</xref></sup> When his disciples said to him, &#x2018;Master, you put us to shame by the [lavish] way you treat her&#x2019;, he replied, &#x2018;Much hardship has she endured with me for the sake of the Torah&#x2019;.</p>
<p label="3.">What was the beginning of R. Eliezer b. Hyr&#x1E33;anos? He was twenty-two years old and had not yet studied Torah. One day he said [to his father], &#x2018;I will go and study Torah under Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Zakkai&#x2019;. His father Hyr&#x1E33;anos replied, &#x2018;You shall not taste a morsel of food until you shall have ploughed a complete furrow&#x2019;. He rose early in the morning and ploughed a complete furrow. It is said that that day was the eve of the Sabbath, so that he went and dined at the house of his father-in-law. Another version is that he tasted nothing between six hours before the Sabbath and six hours after the Sabbath. As he was walking on his way he saw a stone which he thought<sup><xref rid="fn282">13</xref></sup> [to be food]; he took it and put it in his mouth&#x2014;some say that it was cattle dung. He walked on until he came to an inn where he spent the night. He went and sat before Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Zakkai in Jerusalem. Soon an offensive smell came forth from his mouth; whereupon Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Zakkai said, &#x2018;Eliezer, my son, have you eaten anything to-day&#x0021;&#x2019; He did not answer. Again the question was put to him and he still remained silent. The innkeeper was sent for and asked, &#x2018;Has Eliezer eaten with you?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;I thought that perhaps he had eaten at your table, Master&#x2019;. &#x2018;I, too, thought that perhaps he had eaten at your table,&#x2019; said Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan; &#x2018;between us we might have lost R. Eliezer.&#x2019; He then said to Eliezer, &#x2018;Just as an offensive smell came forth from your mouth, so shall there go forth from you a distinguished name in Torah&#x2019;.</p>
<p>When his father Hyr&#x1E33;anos heard that he was studying Torah under Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Zakkai, he declared, &#x2018;I shall go [to Jerusalem] and prohibit my son Eliezer by vow [from deriving any benefit] from my estate&#x2019;. It was said that on that day Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Zakkai was sitting and expounding the Torah in Jerusalem, and all the notables of Israel were sitting before him. On learning that Hyr&#x1E33;anos had arrived, he posted watchmen and charged them, &#x2018;If Hyr&#x1E33;anos comes in and wishes to sit down,<sup><xref rid="fn283">14</xref></sup> do not let him.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn284">15</xref></sup> When he came in and wished to sit down, they did not allow him to do so, and he was compelled to move forward<sup><xref rid="fn285">16</xref></sup> until he came to where Ben &#x1E92;i&#x1E93;ith Hakkeseth, Na&#x1E33;dimon b. Gorion, and Ben Kalba Sabua&#x2018;<sup><xref rid="fn286">17</xref></sup> were seated, and he sat down among them trembling. It was said that on that day Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Zakkai turned his gaze upon R. Eliezer and bade him commence the discourse. He said, &#x2018;I cannot do so&#x2019;. The master as well as the disciples urged him, whereupon he began the discourse and expounded matters about which no ear had ever heard [the like]. At every utterance that came from his lips, Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Zakkai stood up and kissed him on the head; but R. Eliezer exclaimed, &#x2018;My master, you have taught me the truth&#x2019;. Before the time of adjournment had arrived, his father Hyr&#x1E33;anos stood up and said, &#x2018;My masters, I came here for the sole purpose of depriving my son Eliezer by vow of my property, but now [I declare] all my property assigned to my son Eliezer, [21<italic>a</italic>] and all his brothers stand dispossessed and deprived of everything&#x2019;.</p>
<p>Why was &#x1E92;i&#x1E93;ith Hakkeseth so named? Because he used to recline upon a silver couch at the head of all the notables of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn287">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is related concerning the daughter of Na&#x1E33;dimon b. Gorion that her bed had been arrayed at the cost of twelve thousand golden <italic>dinars</italic>, and that from one eve of the Sabbath to the next a Tyrian golden <italic>dinar</italic> was spent by her on sweetmeats. She was then a childless widow awaiting the decision of her brother-in-law.<sup><xref rid="fn288">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Why was Na&#x1E33;dimon b. Gorion so named? Because the sun had again broken through for his sake.<sup><xref rid="fn289">20</xref></sup> Once<sup><xref rid="fn290">21</xref></sup> when all Israel had come up to Jerusalem for the festival, there was no water for them to drink. Na&#x1E33;dimon went to a certain nobleman and said to him, &#x2018;Lend me twelve wells of water from now until such and such a day, and if I do not repay you twelve wells of water I will give you twelve talents of silver&#x2019;. He fixed a time-limit for repayment. When the time came the nobleman sent him [the message], &#x2018;Deliver to me either twelve wells of water or twelve talents of silver&#x2019;. He replied, &#x2018;There is still time during the day [for repayment]&#x2019;. The nobleman sneeringly said to him, &#x2018;There has been no rain the whole year, will it rain now?&#x2019; The nobleman repaired in a happy mood to the bath-house, while Na&#x1E33;dimon b. Gorion entered the Temple,<sup><xref rid="fn291">22</xref></sup> wrapped himself in his cloak and stood up to pray. He said, &#x2018;Lord of the universe&#x0021; It is revealed and known before Thee that I did not act for my own glory or for the glory of my father&#x2019;s house, but for Thy glory did I act that the pilgrims should have water to drink&#x2019;. Immediately the sky became overcast and rain began to fall until the twelve wells were filled to overflowing. He then sent [a message] to that nobleman, &#x2018;Deliver to me the money for the extra water which you have because of me&#x2019;. He replied, &#x2018;The sun has already set and the rain has fallen in my possession&#x2019;. Na&#x1E33;dimon returned to the Temple,<sup><xref rid="fn291">22</xref></sup> wrapped himself in his cloak and again stood up in prayer, saying, &#x2018;Lord of the universe&#x0021; Perform for me a miracle now as Thou didst perform before&#x2019;. Immediately the wind blew, the clouds dispersed, and the sun shone through. When they met the nobleman said, &#x2018;I know that it was only for your sake that the Holy One, blessed be He, disorganized His world&#x2019;.</p>
<p>Why was Kalba Sabua&#x2018; so named? Because whoever entered his house hungry like a dog came out fed to the full.<sup><xref rid="fn292">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>When the Emperor Vespasian came to destroy Jerusalem, the zealots sought to burn all his stores with fire. Kalba Sabua&#x2018; said to them, &#x2018;Why do you destroy this city and seek to burn all [my] stores with fire? Wait until I go in and ascertain what I have in the house&#x2019;. He went in and found that he had enough to supply food for every citizen in Jerusalem for a period of twenty-two years. He immediately gave orders and the produce was stacked and cleaned, ground and sifted, kneaded and baked into bread, so providing a food-supply for every citizen in Jerusalem for twenty-two years. They, however, paid no heed to him. What did the men of Jerusalem do? They took the loaves of bread,<sup><xref rid="fn293">24</xref></sup> cut them through with saws and soiled them with mud. In consequence the men of Jerusalem had to resort to cooking straw and eating it.<sup><xref rid="fn294">25</xref></sup> Every man of Israel who was encamped near the walls of Jerusalem called out, &#x2018;For a reward of five dates I will go down and fetch five heads of the enemy&#x2019;. One man was given five dates, and he went down and brought back five heads of the men of Vespasian. When Vespasian examined the excrement of the besieged men and saw that it was without a trace of corn, he remarked to his soldiers, &#x2018;If these men who subsist on straw only can slay so many of you, how many more of you would they slay if they were to eat and drink like you&#x0021;&#x2019;</p>

<title>CHAPTER VII</title>
<p label="1.">J<small>OSEPH B.</small> J<small>O&#x1E24;ANAN OF</small> J<small>ERUSALEM SAID: LET YOUR HOUSE BE OPENED WIDE, AND LET THE POOR BE MEMBERS OF YOUR HOUSEHOLD; AND TALK NOT MUCH WITH A WOMAN</small>.</p>
<p><small>LET YOUR HOUSE BE OPENED WIDE</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that a man&#x2019;s house should be opened wide to the south, to the east, to the west and to the north, like Job who made four doors to his house. And why did Job make four doors to his house? So that the poor should not have the trouble of going round the entire house. He who came from the north entered straight ahead, and he who came from the south entered straight ahead, and so on all sides. For this reason Job made four doors to his house.</p>
<p><small>AND LET THE POOR BE MEMBERS OF YOUR HOUSEHOLD</small>. This does not mean literally that they should be members of your household, but that the poor should be able to talk freely about what they ate and drank in your house, just as the poor talked freely about what they had eaten and drunk in Job&#x2019;s house. When the poor met, one would ask the other, &#x2018;Whence do you come?&#x2019; and he would reply, &#x2018;From Job&#x2019;s house&#x2019;. Or one would ask the other, &#x2018;Where are you going?&#x2019; and he would reply, &#x2018;To Job&#x2019;s house&#x2019;. When the great calamity befell him, he addressed the Holy One, blessed be He, saying, &#x2018;Lord of the universe&#x0021; Did I not feed the hungry and give drink to the thirsty, as it is stated, <italic>If I have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn295">1</xref></sup> And did I not clothe the naked, as it is stated, <italic>And warmed with the fleece of my sheep?</italic>&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn296">2</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, answered him, &#x2018;For all that, Job, you have not attained to one half the standard [of hospitality] displayed by Abraham. You remained in your house waiting for guests to come to you. To him who was accustomed to eat wheaten bread you gave wheaten bread, to him who was accustomed to eat meat you gave meat, and to him who was accustomed to drink wine you gave wine. Abraham, however, did not act so. He went abroad,<sup><xref rid="fn297">3</xref></sup> and when he met wayfarers he brought them to his home. Even to him who was unaccustomed to eat wheaten bread he gave wheaten bread, to him who was unaccustomed to eat meat he gave meat, and to him who was unaccustomed to drink wine he gave wine. Not only that; but he went and built large mansions along the roadways and placed in them a supply of food and drink, so that whoever entered ate and drank and blessed Heaven. Therefore was he granted happiness;<sup><xref rid="fn298">4</xref></sup> and whatever the heart desired<sup><xref rid="fn299">5</xref></sup> was to be found in Abraham&#x2019;s home, as it is stated, <italic>And Abraham planted a tamarisk-tree in Beer-sheba</italic>&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn300">6</xref></sup></p>
<p label="2.">Teach the members of your household humility; for when a man is humble and the members of his household are also humble, if a poor man comes to the door and asks, &#x2018;Is your father at home?&#x2019; they will reply, &#x2018;Yes, come in&#x2019;. Before he even enters the house the table is already laid for him, and when he comes in he eats and drinks and blesses the name of Heaven. On this account that man is granted much happiness.<sup><xref rid="fn301">7</xref></sup> But when a man is not<sup><xref rid="fn302">8</xref></sup> humble and the members of his household are ill-tempered, if a poor man comes to the door and asks, &#x2018;Is your father at home?&#x2019; they will reply, &#x2018;No&#x2019;, rebuke him and drive him away with harsh words.</p>
<p>Another interpretation of &#x2018;Teach the members of your household humility&#x2019;. What does it mean? It teaches that when a man is humble and the members of his household are also humble, if he sets out to a land beyond the sea, he will say [with confidence], &#x2018;I thank Thee, O Lord my God, that my wife is not engaged in strife with her neighbours&#x2019;. His heart is not anxious, but his mind is at ease until the time of his return. But when a man is not humble and the members of his household are ill-tempered, if he sets out for a distant land, he will say [with apprehension], &#x2018;May it be Thy will, O Lord my God, that my wife be not engaged in strife with her neighbours nor my children in conflict&#x2019;. His heart is anxious and his mind ill at ease until the time of his return.</p>
<p><small>AND TALK NOT MUCH WITH A WOMAN.</small> This is so even though she be his wife, and needless to say if she be his fellow&#x2019;s wife. For when a man talks much with a woman he brings evil upon himself, neglects the study of the Torah, and in the end will inherit Gehinnom.</p>
<p label="3.">Another interpretation of <small>AND TALK NOT MUCH WITH A WOMAN</small>. What does it mean? When a man has come into the House of Study and has not there received the respect due to him, or he has had an argument with his fellow, let him not go and report it to his wife, saying, &#x2018;I had an argument with my neighbour; this is what he said to me and this is what I replied&#x2019;. Thereby he disgraces himself, disgraces his wife and disgraces his neighbour; and his wife who previously held him in esteem [now inwardly] laughs at him. Moreover, when the neighbour hears of it, he exclaims, &#x2018;Alas&#x0021; words which concerned only me and him he has gone and gossiped to his wife&#x2019;. The outcome is that this man disgraces himself, his wife and his neighbour.</p>

<title>CHAPTER VIII</title>
<p label="1.">J<small>OSHUA B.</small> P<small>ERA&#x1E24;IAH AND</small> N<small>ITTAI THE</small> A<small>RBELITE RECEIVED THE TRADITION FROM THE PRECEDING</small>. J<small>OSHUA B.</small> P<small>ERA&#x1E24;IAH SAID: PROVIDE YOURSELF WITH A TEACHER, AND GET YOURSELF A COMPANION, AND JUDGE ALL MEN FAVOURABLY</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn303">1</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>PROVIDE YOURSELF WITH A TEACHER</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that a man should provide himself with a permanent teacher from whom he may learn Scripture, Mishnah, Midrash, <italic>halakah</italic> and <italic>&#x2019;aggadoth</italic>. Accordingly, points which the teacher omitted to tell him in Scripture he can teach him later in the Mishnah, [what he omitted in the Mishnah he can teach him later in the Midrash,]<sup><xref rid="fn304">2</xref></sup> what he omitted in the Midrash he can teach him later in the <italic>halakoth</italic>, and finally what he omitted in the <italic>halakoth</italic> he can teach him in the <italic>&#x2019;aggadoth</italic>. Consequently this man remains in his place and is replete with well-being and blessing.</p>
<p label="2.">R. Meir used to say: He who learns Torah from one teacher, to what can he be compared? To a man who has but one field; he sowed it partly with wheat and partly with barley, in another part he planted olive-trees and in still another fruit-trees. The consequence is that this man is [in one place and is] replete with well-being and blessing. When, however, a man learns from two or three teachers, he may be compared to a person who has many fields; in one he sowed wheat and in another barley, in a third he planted olive-trees and in yet another he planted fruit-trees. The result is that this man is always on the move<sup><xref rid="fn305">3</xref></sup> in the country and has no enjoyment of well-being and blessing.</p>
<p label="3."><small>AND GET YOURSELF A COMPANION</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that a man should get a companion for himself one who will eat with him, drink with him, read the Scriptures with him, study Mishnah with him, lodge with him, and reveal to him all secret lore, the mysteries of the Torah and the problems of everyday life. When they sit together engaged in the study of the Torah, if one of them errs in a <italic>halakah</italic> or in the opening passage of a chapter, or he pronounces what is unclean to be clean or what is clean to be unclean, or he declares what is forbidden to be permitted or what is permitted to be forbidden, his companion can correct him. [21<italic>b</italic>] Whence do we know that when his companion corrects him and continues to read with him they both receive a good reward for their labour? Because it is stated, <italic>Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn306">4</xref></sup></p>
<p label="4.">If three sit together and are engaged in the study of the Torah, the Holy One, blessed be He, accounts it to them as though they had formed a conclave<sup><xref rid="fn307">5</xref></sup> before Him, as it is stated, <italic>It is He that buildeth His upper chambers in the heaven, and hath founded His vault upon the earth; He that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth; the Lord is His name</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn308">6</xref></sup> Hence you learn that if three sit together and are engaged in the study of the Torah, it is accounted to them as though they formed a conclave before the Holy One, blessed be He.</p>
<p label="5.">If two sit together and are engaged in the study of the Torah, their reward is set aside for them on high, as it is stated, <italic>Then they that feared the Lord spoke one with another, and the Lord hearkened</italic> &#x2026; [<italic>and a book of remembrance was written before Him, for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon His name</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn309">7</xref></sup> Who are <italic>they that feared the Lord?</italic> Those who decide upon a course, [and declare their intention,] saying, &#x2018;We will go to free the bound and redeem the captive&#x2019;. The Holy One, blessed be He, provides them with the opportunity, and they proceed to do it forthwith.<sup><xref rid="fn310">8</xref></sup> And who are <italic>they that thought upon His name?</italic> Those who merely think in their hearts [without declaring an intention], &#x2018;We will go to free the bound and redeem the captive&#x2019;. These the Holy One, blessed be He, affords no opportunity,<sup><xref rid="fn311">9</xref></sup> and an angel comes and strikes them to the ground.<sup><xref rid="fn312">10</xref></sup></p>
<p label="6.">If one man sits and occupies himself in the Torah, his reward is set aside for him on high, as it is stated, <italic>Though he sit alone and meditate in stillness, yet he hath taken</italic> [his reward] <italic>unto himself</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn313">11</xref></sup> This may be illustrated by a parable.<sup><xref rid="fn314">12</xref></sup> To what can the matter be likened? To a man who had a young son. When the father went to market leaving his son on his own, the child arose, took a scroll, placed it on his lap, and began to study it. When the father returned from market he exclaimed, &#x2018;See what my young son has done&#x0021; When I left him and set out to market he, of his own accord, took a scroll, placed it on his lap, and began to study it&#x0021;&#x2019; Hence you learn that, even if one man sits alone and occupies himself in the Torah, his reward is set aside for him on high.</p>
<p label="7."><small>AND JUDGE ALL MEN FAVOURABLY</small>. It once happened that a young girl was taken captive and two pious men set out after her to ransom her. One of them entered a house of ill-fame.<sup><xref rid="fn315">13</xref></sup> When he came out he said to his companion, &#x2018;Of what did you suspect me?&#x2019; The other replied, &#x2018;I thought that perhaps [you went there] to find out at what price she was held for ransom&#x2019;. He said, &#x2018;By the Temple Service&#x0021; So it was; and as you judged me favourably, so may the Holy One, blessed be He, judge you favourably.&#x2019;</p>
<p label="8.">Again it happened that a young girl was taken captive and two pious men set out after her to ransom her. One of them, however, was arrested on a [false] charge of robbery and was detained in prison, where his wife daily brought him bread and water. One day he said to her, &#x2018;Go to my colleague and tell him that I am detained in prison [because of my efforts to save the girl] from harlotry,<sup><xref rid="fn316">14</xref></sup> while he stays at home, making merry, with no concern about the girl&#x2019;. She replied, &#x2018;Is it not enough for you that you are detained in prison that you must occupy yourself with futile matters?&#x2019; She did not go, but occupied herself with matters of no moment. He then said to her, &#x2018;I beg of you, go and inform him&#x2019;. She went and informed his colleague. Now what did that man do? He went and took with him much silver and gold as well as several men, and released the two of them. On his release he said to his companions, &#x2018;Permit this young girl to sleep with me in bed with her clothes on&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn317">15</xref></sup> [They did so.] The following morning he said to them, &#x2018;Prepare a ritual bath for me and also for her&#x2019;. They did so. He then said to those who had prepared the baths, &#x2018;When I asked for a ritual bath for myself, of what did you suspect me?&#x2019; They replied, &#x2018;We thought that during all the days that you were confined in prison you must have suffered hunger and thirst, and that now that you have come out into the free world your emotions were stirred and you probably suffered a pollution&#x2019;. He further said to them, &#x2018;And when I asked for a ritual bath for the young girl, of what did you suspect her?&#x2019; They replied, &#x2018;Seeing that all those days that she had been living among heathens she was obliged to eat of their food and drink with them, now [that she is free] you asked that a ritual bath be prepared for her in order that she may become clean&#x2019;. He said to them, &#x2018;By the Temple Service&#x0021; So it was; and as you judged me favourably, so may the Holy One, blessed be He, judge you favourably&#x2019;.</p>
<p>Just as the righteous men of old were pious, so also were their beasts. It was said that the camels of our father Abraham would not enter a house in which there was an idol, as it is stated, <italic>For I have cleared the house, and made room for the camels</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn318">16</xref></sup> <italic>I have cleared the house</italic> of the terafim; why, then, does the verse add <italic>and made room for the camels?</italic> It teaches that they would not enter the house of Laban the Aramean until all the idols had been cleared out before them.</p>
<p>Once the ass of R. &#x1E24;anina b. Dosa was stolen by bandits. They locked it up in a courtyard and placed before it hay, barley and water, but it would neither eat nor drink. They said, &#x2018;Why should we let it die here and befoul the courtyard with its stench?&#x2019; So they proceeded to open the gate for it and let it go free. It dragged itself<sup><xref rid="fn319">17</xref></sup> all the way until it reached the house of R. &#x1E24;anina b. Dosa. When it arrived, R. &#x1E24;anina&#x2019;s son heard its cry and said to his father, &#x2018;Father, the sound is very similar to that of our beast.&#x2019; The father said to him, &#x2018;My son, open the door for it, since it is almost dead from hunger&#x2019;. He at once opened the door for it, and put before it hay, barley and water which it ate and drank. Because of this incident the Sages declared: Just as the righteous men of old were pious, so too were their beasts.</p>

<title>CHAPTER IX</title>
<p label="1.">N<small>ITTAI</small><sup><xref rid="fn320">1</xref></sup> <small>THE</small> A<small>RBELITE SAID: KEEP FAR FROM A BAD NEIGHBOUR, ASSOCIATE NOT WITH THE WICKED, AND ABANDON NOT BELIEF IN RETRIBUTION</small>.</p>
<p><small>KEEP FAR FROM A BAD NEIGHBOUR</small>. It is all one whether the neighbour is within or without your house or in a [nearby] field; for leprosy affects only the house of the wicked, as it is stated, <italic>His own iniquities shall ensnare the wicked</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn321">2</xref></sup> It teaches that leprosy is caused only through the iniquity of the wicked. Indeed, the sins of the wicked cause the righteous man&#x2019;s wall to be pulled down. For instance, where there is a party-wall between the house of the wicked and the righteous, and a plague-spot appears in the party-wall on the side of the wicked man&#x2019;s house [so that the wall must be demolished], the result is that the righteous man&#x2019;s wall is pulled down through the iniquity of the wicked. R. Ishmael, the son of R. Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Bero&#x1E33;ah, said: Woe to the wicked and woe to his neighbour, since the sins of the wicked cause the righteous man&#x2019;s wall to be pulled down.</p>
<p label="2.">With ten trials did our fathers try the Holy One, blessed be He, yet they were only punished because of their evil tongue,<sup><xref rid="fn322">3</xref></sup> which was but one of them. They are as follows:<sup><xref rid="fn323">4</xref></sup> once at the Red Sea,<sup><xref rid="fn324">5</xref></sup> once when the manna first fell<sup><xref rid="fn325">6</xref></sup> and again later on,<sup><xref rid="fn326">7</xref></sup> once at the [first] appearance of the quails<sup><xref rid="fn327">8</xref></sup> and again later on,<sup><xref rid="fn328">9</xref></sup> once at Marah,<sup><xref rid="fn329">10</xref></sup> once at Rephidim,<sup><xref rid="fn330">11</xref></sup> once at Horeb,<sup><xref rid="fn331">12</xref></sup> once at the episode of the golden calf,<sup><xref rid="fn332">13</xref></sup>, and once in connection with the spies.<sup><xref rid="fn333">14</xref></sup> The incident of the spies was the gravest of them all, as it is stated, <italic>Ye have put Me to proof these ten times, and have not hearkened to My voice</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn334">15</xref></sup> And it is similarly [stated], <italic>Even those men that did bring up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before the Lord</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn335">16</xref></sup> Now is there not an inference from the less to the greater? If [for making disparaging remarks about] the Land, which can neither speak, nor blush, nor feel shame, the Holy One, blessed be He, exacted punishment from the spies for its humiliation, how much more will He exact punishment for a man&#x2019;s humiliation from his fellow who speaks [evil] words against him and puts him to shame&#x0021;</p>
<p>R. Simeon said: Upon those who utter slander does the plague of leprosy fall. We find it so with Aaron and Miriam who slandered Moses and were visited with punishment, as it is stated, <italic>And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn336">17</xref></sup> Why does Scripture mention Miriam&#x2019;s name first before Aaron&#x2019;s? It teaches that Zipporah<sup><xref rid="fn337">18</xref></sup> went and spoke of it to Miriam; Miriam went and spoke of it to Aaron, and both of them arose and spoke ill of that righteous man [Moses]. Because the two of them stood speaking ill of that righteous man, Divine punishment came upon them, as it is stated, <italic>And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them, and departed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn338">19</xref></sup> What is the significance of the expression <italic>and departed?</italic> It suggests that [the leprosy] departed from Aaron<sup><xref rid="fn339">20</xref></sup> and attached itself to Miriam, because Aaron did not enter into the details of the matter whereas Miriam did; therefore she was immediately punished with greater severity. Miriam said, &#x2018;To me came the Word yet I did not separate myself from my husband&#x2019;. Aaron said, &#x2018;To me came the Word yet I did not separate myself from my wife. The Word also came to our fathers of old and they did not separate themselves from their wives. But [Moses], in his arrogance, has separated from his wife&#x0021;&#x2019; They did not criticize him to his face<sup><xref rid="fn340">21</xref></sup> but only behind his back, and their criticism was not stated as a fact but only as a surmise; since it was a matter of doubt whether he had acted so from arrogance or not. Now is there not here an inference from the less to the greater? If Miriam, who spoke only against her brother, spoke only in [22<italic>a</italic>] secret<sup><xref rid="fn341">22</xref></sup> and spoke only behind Moses&#x2019; back, was punished, how much greater will be the punishment of an ordinary man who speaks ill to the face of his fellow and puts him to shame&#x0021;</p>
<p>At that time Aaron said to Moses, &#x2018;Moses, my brother, do you think that this leprosy affects only Miriam? It touches also the person of our father Amram. Let me illustrate this to you. To what can the matter be compared? To a man who had taken a glowing coal in his hand; no matter how much he shifts it about from place to place his flesh is still scorched. For so it is stated, <italic>Let her not, I pray, be as one dead</italic>&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn342">23</xref></sup> Thereupon Aaron began to conciliate Moses, saying, &#x2018; Moses, my brother, have we ever done evil to any person in the world?&#x2019; He answered, &#x2018;You have not&#x2019;. &#x2018;Well then,&#x2019; he said, &#x2018;if we have never hurt anyone in the world, how could we hurt you, our brother? What can I do now? It was a misunderstanding between us; we have broken<sup><xref rid="fn343">24</xref></sup> the covenant between us and you, as it is stated, <italic>And remembered not the brotherly covenant</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn344">25</xref></sup> Are we to lose our sister because the covenant which was made between us is broken?&#x2019; Immediately Moses drew a small circle, stood within it and prayed for mercy on her behalf, saying, &#x2018;I shall not stir from here until my sister Miriam is healed&#x2019;, as it is stated, <italic>Heal her now, O God, I beseech Thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn345">26</xref></sup> Forthwith the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, &#x2018;If a king had rebuked her, or if her father had rebuked her, would it not be proper that she hide in shame for seven days? Surely, if I, the King of kings, rebuke her, how much more should she hide in shame for fourteen days [at the least]&#x0021; Yet for your sake I pardon her&#x2019;. As it is stated, <italic>And the Lord said unto Moses: If her father had but spit in her face</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn346">27</xref></sup> etc.</p>
<p><italic>Now the man Moses was very meek</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn347">28</xref></sup> It is possible [to think] he was meek but not handsome and imposing;<sup><xref rid="fn348">29</xref></sup> therefore Scripture states, <italic>And he spread the tent over the tabernacle:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn349">30</xref></sup> as the tabernacle was ten cubits in height, so Moses must have been ten cubits tall. It is possible [to think] that he was as meek as the ministering angels; therefore Scripture continues, [<italic>Moses was very meek</italic>] <italic>above all the men:</italic> above all men, it is said, but not above the ministering angels. It is possible [to think] that he was as meek as those of the former generations;<sup><xref rid="fn350">31</xref></sup> therefore Scripture continues, <italic>Upon the face of the earth</italic>, implying above those of his own generation, but not above those of the former generations.</p>
<p>Three types of leprous condition were created in the world: the moist, the dry and the polypus;<sup><xref rid="fn351">32</xref></sup> but the soul of Moses was lowlier than them all.</p>
<p label="3.">R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: Also upon those who utter calumny<sup><xref rid="fn352">33</xref></sup> does the plague [of leprosy] fall. We find it so in the case of Gehazi; because he uttered calumny against his master leprosy clung to him until his dying day, as it is stated, <italic>The leprosy, therefore, of Naaman shall cleave unto thee&#x2026;. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn353">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>He further said: Also upon those who are arrogant does the plague [of leprosy] fall. We find it so in the case of Uzziah, as it is stated, <italic>But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up so that he did corruptly, and he trespassed against the Lord his God; for he went unto the temple of the Lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense. And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the Lord, that were valiant men; and they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him: It pertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the Lord, but to the priests the sons of Aaron that are consecrated it pertaineth to burn incense; go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thy honour from the Lord God. Then Uzziah was wrath, and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense; and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy broke forth in his forehead</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn354">35</xref></sup> At that moment the sanctuary was split from end to end,<sup><xref rid="fn355">36</xref></sup> and [the chasm covered an area of] twelve square miles. The priests fled in alarm. The king also made haste to go out <italic>because the Lord had smitten him. And he was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a house set apart, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the Lord; and Jotham his son was over the king&#x2019;s house, judging the people of the land</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn356">37</xref></sup></p>
<p label="4."><small>ASSOCIATE NOT WITH THE WICKED</small>. This teaches that a man should not associate himself either with an evil man or a wicked man. We find it so in the case of Jehoshaphat; because he associated with Ahab and went up with him to Ramoth Gilead, the wrath of the Lord came upon him, as it is stated, <italic>Shouldest thou help the wicked, and love them that hate the Lord? For this thing wrath is upon thee from the Lord</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn357">38</xref></sup> And also later when he associated with Ahaziah, and they made themselves ships in Ezion Geber, the Lord wrecked his enterprise, as it is stated, <italic>Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the Lord hath made a breach in thy works. And the ships were broken</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn358">39</xref></sup> So, too, we find with Amnon who associated with Jonadab and received from him bad advice, as it is stated, <italic>But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David&#x2019;s brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn359">40</xref></sup> he was <italic>subtle</italic> to do evil.<sup><xref rid="fn360">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation of <small>ASSOCIATE NOT WITH THE WICKED</small>: even to [bring him near to] the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn361">42</xref></sup></p>
<p label="5."><small>AND ABANDON NOT BELIEF IN RETRIBUTION</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that a man&#x2019;s heart should be daily in fear of retribution<sup><xref rid="fn362">43</xref></sup> and he should say, &#x2018;Woe is me, perhaps reckoning will overtake me to-day or to-morrow&#x2019;. As a consequence he is fearful every day, as it is stated of Job, <italic>For I feared a fear</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn363">44</xref></sup></p>
<p label="6.">Another interpretation of <small>AND ABANDON NOT BELIEF IN RETRIBUTION</small>. What does this mean? When a man sees that he is successful in whatever he undertakes, let him not say, &#x2018;Because I am meritorious the All-present has provided me with food and drink in this world, while the capital [of my reward] is laid up for me in the world to come&#x2019;. Rather should he say, &#x2018;Woe is me, perhaps I have only one meritorious deed to my credit before Him, and as a reward for that He has granted me food and drink in this world, so as to cut me off utterly in the world to come&#x2019;.</p>

<p label="1.">J<small>UDAH B.</small> &#x1E6C;<small>ABBAI AND</small> S<small>IMEON B.</small> S<small>HE&#x1E6C;A&#x1E24; RECEIVED THE TRADITION FROM THE PRECEDING</small>. J<small>UDAH B.</small> &#x1E6C;<small>ABBAI SAID: ACT NOT AS THOSE THAT WOULD INFLUENCE THE JUDGES; AND WHEN THE SUITORS STAND BEFORE YOU LET THEM BE AS WRONGDOERS IN YOUR SIGHT, AND WHEN THEY HAVE DEPARTED LET THEM BE AS INNOCENT IN YOUR SIGHT, ONCE THEY HAVE ACCEPTED THE JUDGMENT</small>.</p>
<p label="2."><small>ACT NOT AS THOSE THAT WOULD INFLUENCE THE JUDGES</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that if you come to the House of Study and hear a ruling or a decision, be not hasty to dispute it, but sit and ask yourself, &#x2018;Why did they say it? On what grounds did they arrive at their decision?&#x2019; Or if they stated a law, ask them first of all the fundamental principle of the law about which they were consulted.<sup><xref rid="fn364">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>When two suitors come before you to law, one poor and the other rich, do not say, &#x2018;How can I declare the poor man innocent and the rich man guilty?&#x2019; or &#x2018;How can I declare the rich man innocent and the poor man guilty?&#x2019; or &#x2018;If I find against the poor man, he will become my enemy; and if I find in favour of the poor man, the rich man will become my enemy.&#x2019; Furthermore, do not say, &#x2018;How dare I take the money from one and give it to the other?&#x2019; For the Torah declares, <italic>Ye shall not respect persons in judgment</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn365">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Meir used to say: What does Scripture intend by the words, <italic>Ye shall hear the small and the great alike?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn366">3</xref></sup> It means that one suitor should not sit and the other stand; one should not speak all that he wishes and the other be told to be brief. R. Judah said: I have heard that if [the judges] desire both suitors to sit they may do so, and there is no objection to it. What is prohibited is for one to sit and the other to stand.<sup><xref rid="fn367">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>[Another interpretation:] What is meant by <italic>the small and the great alike?</italic> A minor law-suit should be as important to you as a major law-suit, a law-suit involving a <italic>peru&#x1E6D;ah</italic> should be as important to you as one involving one hundred <italic>mina</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn368">5</xref></sup></p>

We find it so in the case of Saul; when he was asked to assume the regal dignity he hid himself, as it is stated, <italic>And the Lord answered: Behold, he hath hid himself among the baggage</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn371">8</xref></sup> But when he was told to surrender the crown, he pursued David to kill him.</p>

<title>CHAPTER XI</title>
<p label="1.">S<small>HEMAIAH AND</small> A<small>B&#x1E6C;ALYON RECEIVED THE TRADITION FROM THE PRECEDING</small>. S<small>HEMAIAH SAID: LOVE WORK AND HATE PUBLIC OFFICE, AND BECOME NOT KNOWN TO THE RULING POWER</small>.</p>
<p><small>LOVE WORK</small>. What does this mean? It teaches [22<italic>b</italic>] that a man should love work and not hate it; for just as the Torah was given [to man] by a covenant, so work too was given by a covenant, as it is stated, <italic>Six days shalt thou labour and do all thy work; but the seventh day is a sabbath unto the Lord thy God</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn372">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: There are times when a man does work [on the Sabbath] and escapes the penalty of death, and there are times when a man does no work [on the Sabbath] and incurs death by Heaven. How can this be? If a man sat the whole week doing no work and on the eve of the Sabbath, having nothing to eat, took of the sacred money which is in his possession and used it for his needs, he thereby incurred the penalty of death by Heaven.<sup><xref rid="fn373">2</xref></sup> On the other hand, if he is at work on the Temple building, although he receives sacred money in payment which he uses for his needs, he escapes the penalty of death.</p>
<p>R. Dosethai said: When do we find that if a man does no work all the six days he will eventually have to work all the seven days? If he is idle all the days of the week doing no work, when the Sabbath eve arrives he will have nothing to eat. He then goes forth and joins a band of robbers; he is caught and put in chains, and is now compelled to work [also] on the Sabbath. All this is the sequel of his not working during the six days of the week.</p>
<p>R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: Even Adam, the first man, did not taste a morsel until he had done some work, as it is stated, <italic>And He put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn374">3</xref></sup> and only then [is it recorded], <italic>Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn375">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. &#x1E6C;arfon said: Even the Holy One, blessed be He, did not cause His Presence to dwell in Israel until they had performed some work, as it is stated, <italic>And let them make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn376">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Judah b. Bathyra said: What should a man do when he has no work to undertake? If he has a dilapidated courtyard or a waste field let him go and attend to it;<sup><xref rid="fn377">6</xref></sup> for it is stated, <italic>Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn378">7</xref></sup> Why does the verse add the words <italic>and do all thy work?</italic> To include the case of a man who has dilapidated courtyards or waste fields, that he should go and occupy himself with them.</p>
<p>R. Jose<sup><xref rid="fn379">8</xref></sup> said: No man dies except in idleness, as it is stated, <italic>And he expired, and was gathered unto his people</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn380">9</xref></sup> Hence if a man had a seizure, came under the care of his physician and died, he only died because he was in idleness.<sup><xref rid="fn381">10</xref></sup> If a man was standing [idly] on the top of a roof or a castle or a building or by the river&#x2019;s edge and fell and died, he only died because he was in idleness.</p>
<p>We have heard this<sup><xref rid="fn382">11</xref></sup> in connection with men, but whence in connection with women? As it is stated, <italic>Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn383">12</xref></sup> And whence in connection with children? As it is stated, <italic>So the people were restrained from bringing</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn384">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Nathan said: At the time that Moses was engaged upon the work of the Tabernacle, he declined to consult with the princes of Israel. Consequently they sat in silence, thinking to themselves, &#x2018;The time will soon come when Moses will have need of us&#x2019;. When they heard the proclamation made in the camp which declared, <italic>The stuff they had was sufficient</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn385">14</xref></sup> they exclaimed, &#x2018;Alas, we have had no share in the work of the Tabernacle&#x0021;&#x2019; They arose and added a large contribution of their own accord, as it is stated, <italic>And the rulers brought the onyx stones</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn386">15</xref></sup></p>
<p label="2."><small>AND HATE PUBLIC OFFICE</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that no man should himself put a crown on his head, but others should put it on him; as it is stated, <italic>Let another man praise thee and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn387">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: Whoever exalts himself by his knowledge of Torah, to what is he like? To a carcase which lies in the road, anybody passing by puts his hand to his nose and moves far away from it; as it is stated, <italic>If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast planned devices, lay thy hand upon thy mouth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn388">17</xref></sup> Ben &#x2018;Azzai said to him, &#x2018;Interpret the text in this sense: If a man debases himself for the sake of Torah, eats dry dates, wears shabby clothes, and sits and keeps guard at the door of the wise, though every passer-by may think him a fool, in the end you will find that the whole Torah is within him&#x2019;.</p>
<p>R. Jose said: Go down and you will be up,<sup><xref rid="fn389">18</xref></sup> go up and you will be down. He who exalts himself by his knowledge of Torah will in the end be brought low; he who humbles himself by his knowledge of Torah will in the end be exalted.</p>
<p label="3."><small>AND BECOME NOT KNOWN TO THE RULING POWER</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that a man should not wish to have a reputation [for wealth] with the ruling powers,<sup><xref rid="fn390">19</xref></sup> because if this happens they will eventually have their eyes upon him, put him to death and confiscate all his wealth. [Similarly, a man should not cause a reputation for wealth to be spread abroad about his neighbour among the ruling powers.]<sup><xref rid="fn391">20</xref></sup> Thus if a man meets his friend in the market and exclaims, &#x2018;May the Holy One, blessed be He, bless that man [still more]&#x0021; Only to-day there came from his establishment a hundred oxen, a hundred sheep and a hundred goats&#x0021;&#x2019;, an inspector may hear it and proceed to inform the governor, who has the man&#x2019;s house surrounded and confiscates all his wealth. Of such a man Scripture says, <italic>He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice &#x2026; it is counted a curse to him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn392">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation of <small>AND BECOME NOT KNOWN TO THE RULING POWER</small>. A man&#x2019;s friend is sitting in the market and the former exclaims, &#x2018;May the Holy One, blessed be He, bestow still more blessings upon him&#x0021; To-day he brought into his house so many <italic>kors</italic> of wheat and so many <italic>kors</italic> of barley&#x0021;&#x2019; Robbers hear of it and come and surround his house, taking away all his wealth, so that in the morning he is left with nothing. Of such a man Scripture says, <italic>He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice</italic>, etc.</p>
<p>Another interpretation of <small>AND BECOME NOT KNOWN TO THE RULING POWER</small>. What does it mean? It teaches that a man should not intend [to occupy office] in order to say, &#x2018;I am the city&#x2019;s governor&#x2019;, or &#x2018;I am the deputy-governor&#x2019;, because they rob Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn393">22</xref></sup></p>
<p label="4.">Another interpretation: A man should not have the intention [to occupy] a governmental position, for though in the beginning they show him favour, ultimately they trouble him sorely.<sup><xref rid="fn394">23</xref></sup></p>
<p label="5.">A<small>B&#x1E6C;ALYON SAID: WISE MEN, BE HEEDFUL OF YOUR WORDS</small>, lest men teach doctrines in your name not in accord with the Torah, and <small>YOU THEREBY INCUR THE PENALTY OF EXILE, AND ARE EXILED TO A PLACE OF EVIL WATERS</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn395">24</xref></sup> Moreover, the disciples who come after you may also teach doctrines in your name not in accord with the Torah, and they too incur the penalty of exile and are exiled to a place of evil waters.<sup><xref rid="fn396">25</xref></sup> What is to be understood by &#x2018;evil waters&#x2019;? That which is implied in the verse, <italic>But they mingled themselves with the nations, and learned their works</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn397">26</xref></sup> Others say: The phrase &#x2018;evil waters&#x2019; bears its literal significance.<sup><xref rid="fn398">27</xref></sup> Another view is: [The meaning is] lest they be exiled for hard labour.</p>
<ftnote id="fn372">(1) Ex. XX, 9f. This verse, however, does not contain the word &#x2018;covenant&#x2019; required for the purpose of the analogy, and the commentators substitute Ex.

<title>CHAPTER XII</title>
<p label="1.">H<small>ILLEL AND</small> S<small>HAMMAI RECEIVED THE TRADITION FROM THE PRECEDING</small>. H<small>ILLEL SAID: BE OF THE DISCIPLES OF</small> A<small>ARON, LOVING PEACE AND PURSUING PEACE</small>, promoting peace between man and wife, <small>LOVING MANKIND AND BRINGING THEM NEAR TO THE TORAH</small>.</p>
<p><small>HE USED TO SAY: WHOEVER MAKES HIS NAME GREAT LOSES HIS NAME; WHOSOEVER INCREASES NOT HIS KNOWLEDGE DECREASES IT; HE WHO DOES NOT STUDY DESERVES DEATH; AND HE WHO MAKES USE OF THE CROWN</small><sup><xref rid="fn399">1</xref></sup> <small>WILL PASS AWAY</small>.</p>
<p label="2."><small>HE FURTHER USED TO SAY: IF I AM NOT FOR MYSELF WHO IS FOR ME? AND IF I AM ONLY FOR MYSELF, WHAT AM I? AND IF NOT NOW, WHEN?</small></p>
<p label="3."><small>LOVING PEACE</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that a man should love [to foster] peace in Israel between man and man, just as Aaron loved [to foster] peace in Israel between man and man, as it is stated, <italic>The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips; he walked with Me in peace and uprightness, and did turn many away from iniquity</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn400">2</xref></sup> R. Meir said: What is meant by <italic>and did turn many away from iniquity?</italic> Whenever Aaron walked along the road and met a wicked man, he would offer him greetings. On the following day when that man was about to commit a transgression, he would say, &#x2018;Woe is me&#x0021; How can I raise my eyes after doing that and look Aaron in the face? I should be ashamed before him, since he greeted me&#x2019;. Consequently that man withholds himself from transgression.</p>
<p>Similarly, when two men had quarrelled one with the other, Aaron would go and sit with one of them and say, &#x2018;My son, see what your companion is doing&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn401">3</xref></sup> He beats his breast and tears his clothes, exclaiming, &#x201C;Woe is me&#x0021; how can I raise my eyes and look my companion in the face? I am ashamed before him since it is I who offended him&#x201D; &#x2019;. Aaron would sit with him until he had removed all enmity from his heart. Then Aaron would go and sit with the other and say likewise, &#x2018;My son, see what your companion is doing&#x0021; He beats his breast and tears his clothes, exclaiming, &#x201C;Woe is me&#x0021; how can I raise my eyes and look my companion in the face? I am ashamed before him since it was I who offended him&#x201D; &#x2019;. Aaron would sit with him until he had removed all enmity from his heart. Later when the two met, they embraced and kissed each other. Therefore it is stated, <italic>They wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn402">4</xref></sup></p>
<p label="4.">Another interpretation&#x2014;why was it that for Aaron <italic>all the house of Israel</italic> wept thirty days, i.e. the men as well as the women? Because Aaron judged everyone favourably,<sup><xref rid="fn403">5</xref></sup> for he never said to any man or any woman, &#x2018;You have done wrong&#x2019;. Therefore it is written of him that <italic>all the house of Israel</italic> wept for him. Of Moses, on the other hand, who rebuked the people with harsh words, it is stated, <italic>And all the children of Israel wept for Moses</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn404">6</xref></sup> Moreover, many thousands in Israel were given the name Aaron, since but for him they would not have come into the world, because he was the peacemaker between husband and wife. When [after being reconciled] they were united, they would name the child who was born after him. [23<italic>a</italic>]</p>
<p>Others say that for this reason it is stated, <italic>And they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel</italic>&#x2014;because who could look upon Moses our teacher sitting and weeping and himself not weep? Others express it in this way: Who could look upon Eleazar and Phinehas,<sup><xref rid="fn405">7</xref></sup> the two High Priests, standing and weeping and himself not weep?</p>
<p>At that time Moses wished to die in the same manner as Aaron had died; because he saw Aaron&#x2019;s couch arrayed in great splendour, and hosts of ministering angels lamenting him. Did Moses express this desire in the hearing of another person? No, he only expressed the wish to himself and the Holy One, blessed be He, heard his whisper [and granted his wish,] as it is stated, <italic>And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn406">8</xref></sup> From this you may infer that Moses wished to die the same death as Aaron.</p>
<p>At that hour [when Moses was to die], He said to the angel of death, &#x2018;Go and bring Me the soul of Moses&#x2019;. The angel of death went and stood before him and said, &#x2018;Moses, deliver your soul to me&#x2019;. Moses rebuked him saying, &#x2018;In the place where I am seated you have not the right to stand,<sup><xref rid="fn407">9</xref></sup> yet you say to me, &#x201C;Deliver your soul to me&#x201D; &#x2019;. He rebuked him and drove him away in anger. At length the Holy One, blessed be He, [intervened and] said to Moses, &#x2018;Moses, you have had enough of this world; the world to come awaits you since the six days of creation&#x2019;, as it is stated, <italic>And the Lord said: Behold there is a place by Me, and thou shalt stand upon the rock</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn408">10</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, took the soul of Moses and stored it under the Throne of Glory, as it is stated, <italic>The soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy God</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn409">11</xref></sup> When He took his soul it was with a kiss, as it is stated, <italic>By the mouth of the Lord</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn410">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Not only the soul of Moses is stored under the Throne of Glory but the souls of the righteous are also stored there, as it is stated, <italic>The soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy God</italic>. It is possible [to think that] it is the same with the souls of the wicked; therefore Scripture declares, <italic>And the souls of thine enemies, them shall He sling out as from the hollow of a sling</italic><sup><xref rid="fn411">13</xref></sup>. To what may this be compared? To a man who took a stone and placed it in a sling; though he hurls it from place to place he knows not where it will come to rest. Similarly, the souls of the wicked are held fast [as in a vice],<sup><xref rid="fn412">14</xref></sup> and driven about aimlessly in the world, knowing not whereon to rest.</p>
<p>Again said He to the angel of death, &#x2018;Go and bring Me the soul of Moses&#x2019;. He went and searched for him in his usual place but could not find him. He went to the Great Sea and asked, &#x2018;Has Moses been here?&#x2019; The Sea replied, &#x2018;Since the day Israel passed through me I have not seen him&#x2019;. He went to the mountains and hills and asked, &#x2018;Has Moses been here?&#x2019; They replied, &#x2018;Since the day Israel received the Torah on Mount Sinai we have not seen him&#x2019;. He then went to Sheol and Abaddon<sup><xref rid="fn413">15</xref></sup> and asked, &#x2018;Has Moses been here?&#x2019; They replied, &#x2018;We have heard his name but have not seen him&#x2019;. He went to the ministering angels and asked, &#x2018;Has Moses been here?&#x2019; They replied, &#x2018;<italic>God understandeth his way, and He knoweth his place</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn414">16</xref></sup> God has hidden him away for life in the world to come, and no creature knows his whereabouts&#x2019;, as it is stated, <italic>But wisdom, where shall it be found? And where is the place of understanding? Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living. The deep saith: It is not in me; and the sea saith: It is not with me</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn415">17</xref></sup> <italic>Destruction and Death say: We have heard a rumour thereof with our ears</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn416">18</xref></sup> Joshua also was sitting and grieving over Moses, because he did not know where he was, until the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, &#x2018;Joshua, why do you grieve for Moses? <italic>Moses My servant is dead</italic>&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn417">19</xref></sup></p>
<p label="5."><small>PURSUING PEACE</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that a man should pursue peace in Israel among all men in the same way that Aaron pursued peace in Israel among all men; as it is stated, <italic>Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn418">20</xref></sup> R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: If a man stays at home in quietude, how can he pursue peace in Israel among all men? He should rather leave his home and go about the world so that he can pursue peace in Israel, as it is stated, <italic>Seek peace, and pursue it</italic>: meaning <italic>seek peace</italic> in your own place, <italic>and pursue it</italic> by going elsewhere.</p>
<p>Even the Holy One, blessed be He, made peace on high.<sup><xref rid="fn419">21</xref></sup> What manner of peace did He make on high? By not naming ten [angels] &#x2018;Gabriel&#x2019;, ten &#x2018;Michael&#x2019;, ten &#x2018;Uriel&#x2019;, or ten &#x2018;Raphael&#x2019;, after the manner of men who name ten [persons] &#x2018;Reuben&#x2019;, ten &#x2018;Simeon&#x2019;, ten &#x2018;Levi&#x2019;, or ten &#x2018;Judah&#x2019;. Had He done as men do, on summoning one [angel, all bearing that name] would come before Him and they would be envious of one another. He therefore named one [angel] &#x2018;Gabriel&#x2019; and one &#x2018;Michael&#x2019;, so that when He summons an angel [by name] only one appears before Him and is sent wherever He wishes. And whence do we know that [the angels] reverence one another, respect one another, and are more humble than human beings? When they are about to open their mouths to sing hymns, one says to the other, &#x2018;You begin, for you are greater than I&#x2019;; and the other replies, &#x2018;No, you begin, for you are greater than I&#x2019;. This is quite unlike the behaviour of human beings, everyone saying to his fellow, &#x2018;I am greater than you&#x2019;. According to another view [the courteous remarks are made by] groups of angels, one group saying to the other, &#x2018;You begin, for you are greater than we&#x2019;; as it is stated, <italic>And one called unto another, and said</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn420">22</xref></sup></p>
<p label="6."><small>LOVING MANKIND</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that a man should love his fellow-creatures and not hate them; for so we find it among the men of the generation of the Dispersion. Since they loved one another,<sup><xref rid="fn421">23</xref></sup> the Holy One, blessed be He, did not wish to destroy them, but dispersed them to the four corners of the earth.<sup><xref rid="fn422">24</xref></sup> Because the men of Sodom, on the other hand, hated one another, the Holy One, blessed be He, destroyed them from this world and the world to come; as it is stated, <italic>The men of Sodom were wicked and sinners against the Lord exceedingly</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn423">25</xref></sup> [<italic>Wicked</italic> signifies that they hated one another;]<sup><xref rid="fn424">26</xref></sup> <italic>sinners</italic>, that they offended against morality; <italic>against the Lord</italic>, that they profaned the Name; <italic>exceedingly</italic>, that they sinned with premeditation. Hence you learn that because they hated one another, the Holy One, blessed be He, destroyed them from this world and from the world to come.</p>
<p label="7."><small>AND BRINGING THEM NEAR TO THE TORAH</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that a man should prevail upon his fellows and bring them beneath the wings of the Divine Presence, as our father Abraham used to prevail upon men and bring them beneath the wings of the Divine Presence. Not only Abraham did this, but also Sarah, as it is stated, <italic>And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother&#x2019;s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had made in Haran</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn425">27</xref></sup> Is it not a fact that all mankind cannot create even a gnat? How, then, can Scripture declare, <italic>And the souls that they had</italic> made <italic>in Haran&#x0021;</italic> It teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, accounted it to them as though they had created them.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn426">28</xref></sup> Just as a man does not share his fellow&#x2019;s reward in this world, so a man does not share his fellow&#x2019;s reward in the world to come; as it is stated, <italic>And behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power, but they had no comforter</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn427">29</xref></sup> Why does the verse repeat <italic>they had no comforter?</italic> It speaks of those men who in this world eat and drink and are fortunate in their sons and daughters, but in the world to come have nothing<sup><xref rid="fn428">30</xref></sup> and are without a comforter. In this world, if a man has been robbed or suffered a bereavement, his sons, brothers and kinsmen come to comfort him. It is possible [to imagine] that it is the same in the world to come; therefore Scripture declares, <italic>He hath neither son nor brother</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn429">31</xref></sup> Similarly, if a man sins and begets an illegitimate child, they say to him, &#x2018;Fool that you are&#x0021; You have harmed yourself and also the child&#x2019;. For that illegitimate son may be desirous of studying Torah together with the scholars who sit and study in Jerusalem. He joins their company until they reach Ashdod; there he halts and cries, &#x2018;Woe is me&#x0021; Had I not been of illegitimate birth, I should now be studying with those who were hitherto my fellow-students; but being illegitimate I may not sit and study with them because an illegitimate is not allowed to enter Jerusalem; as it is stated, <italic>And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn430">32</xref></sup></p>
<p label="8."><small>HE USED TO SAY: IF I AM NOT FOR MYSELF, WHO IS FOR ME</small>? If I do not win merit for myself in my lifetime, who will do so for me?<sup><xref rid="fn431">33</xref></sup> <small>AND IF I AM ONLY FOR MYSELF, WHAT AM I</small>? If I have won merit for myself alone, what have I achieved?<sup><xref rid="fn432">34</xref></sup> <small>AND IF NOT NOW, WHEN</small>? If I do not win merit for myself in my lifetime, who will do so for me after my death? As Scripture declares, <italic>For a living dog is better than a dead lion</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn433">35</xref></sup> <italic>A living dog is better</italic> refers to a wicked man while he exists in this world;<sup><xref rid="fn434">36</xref></sup> <italic>than a dead lion</italic> refers to the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob who sleep in the dust.<sup><xref rid="fn435">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation: <italic>A living dog is better</italic> refers to a wicked man while he exists in this world, because if he repents the Holy One, blessed be He, receives him; whereas a righteous man, once dead, cannot add to his merits.</p>
<p label="9.">He used to say: If you will come to my house I will go to yours. Wheresoever my heart desires [to go] there my feet lead me.<sup><xref rid="fn436">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x2018;If you will come to my house I will go to yours.&#x2019; What does this mean? It refers to the persons who are found in the Synagogues and Houses of Study early in the morning and late at night. The Holy One, blessed be He, will bless them in the world to come, in accordance with what is stated, <italic>In every place where I cause My name to be mentioned I will come unto thee and bless thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn437">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x2018;Wheresoever my heart desires [to go] there my feet lead me.&#x2019; What does this mean? It refers to the persons who leave their silver and gold behind and go up [to Jerusalem] for the Festival to appear before the Divine Presence in the Temple. The Holy One, blessed be He, stands on guard for them in the midst of their homesteads, as it is stated, <italic>Neither shall any man covet thy land, when thou goest up to appear before the Lord thy God</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn438">40</xref></sup></p>
<p label="10.">He used to say: If I am here, all are here; if I am not here, who is here?<sup><xref rid="fn439">41</xref></sup> Turn it<sup><xref rid="fn440">42</xref></sup> and turn it again, for everything [23<italic>b</italic>] is in it. And with regard to all things [the rule applies]: according to the labour so is the reward.<sup><xref rid="fn441">43</xref></sup></p>
<p label="11.">The story is told of Hillel the Elder that he was walking along the road when he met some men carrying wheat. He asked them, &#x2018;How much a <italic>se&#x2019;ah?</italic>&#x2019; They replied, &#x2018;Two <italic>dinars</italic>&#x2019;. Later he met other men [carrying wheat] and he asked them, &#x2018;How much a <italic>se&#x2019;ah?</italic>&#x2019; They replied, &#x2018;Three <italic>dinars</italic>.&#x2019; He said to them, &#x2018;But those who were in front of you only asked two <italic>dinars</italic>&#x2019;. They rejoined, &#x2018;You stupid Babylonian, do you not know the rule: according to the labour so is the reward?&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn442">44</xref></sup> He said to them, &#x2018;You foolish and empty-headed persons&#x0021; Because I ask you [a civil question], do you answer me [rudely]?&#x2019; Nevertheless Hillel the Elder so affected them that he turned them on to the good path.</p>
<p><small>MOREOVER, HE SAW A SKULL FLOATING ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER; HE SAID TO IT, &#x2018;BECAUSE YOU DROWNED OTHERS THEY DROWNED YOU, AND THEY THAT DROWNED YOU WILL THEMSELVES BE DROWNED</small>&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn443">45</xref></sup></p>
<p label="13.">He also said the following four [aphorisms] in Aramaic: <small>WHOSOEVER MAKES GREAT HIS NAME LOSES HIS NAME; HE WHO DOES NOT WAIT UPON SCHOLARS DESERVES DEATH; HE WHO DOES NOT INCREASE HIS KNOWLEDGE LOSES WHAT HE HAS; AND HE WHO MAKES USE OF THE CROWN WILL PASS AWAY AND PERISH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn444">46</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>WHOEVER MAKES GREAT HIS NAME LOSES HIS NAME</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that a man should not spread abroad of himself a reputation [for wealth] in the kingdom, because if he does so, before long the authorities will cast their eyes upon him, kill him, and confiscate his wealth.<sup><xref rid="fn445">47</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>HE WHO DOES NOT WAIT UPON SCHOLARS DESERVES DEATH</small>. What does it mean? The story is told of a certain man of Beth-Ramah<sup><xref rid="fn446">48</xref></sup> who used to conduct himself in the strictest piety, that Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Zakkai once sent a disciple to him to test him in his conduct.<sup><xref rid="fn447">49</xref></sup> When he arrived, he found that the man took some oil and set it on the oven-range [to be warmed], then he removed it from the range and poured it into a dish of crushed beans. On being asked what he was doing, the man replied, &#x2018;I am a High Priest<sup><xref rid="fn448">50</xref></sup> and I always eat <italic>terumah</italic> in conditions of cleanness&#x2019;. &#x2018;Is this oven-range clean or unclean?&#x2019; [the disciple] asked him, and he answered, &#x2018;Is it ever mentioned in the Torah about an oven-range being unclean? Surely the Torah speaks only of a common oven as being unclean; as it is stated, <italic>Whatsoever is in it shall be unclean</italic>&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn449">51</xref></sup> The other retorted, &#x2018;Just as the Torah speaks of a common oven as being unclean, so it likewise speaks of an oven-range as being unclean; for it is stated, <italic>Whether oven, or range for pots, it shall be broken in pieces; they are unclean</italic>&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn450">52</xref></sup> He added, &#x2018;If that is what you were accustomed to do, you have never eaten clean <italic>terumah</italic> in your life&#x2019;.</p>
<p><small>HE WHO DOES NOT INCREASE HIS KNOWLEDGE LOSES WHAT HE HAS</small>. What does it mean? It teaches that if a man has studied one tractate, or even two or three tractates, and does not add anything thereto, eventually he will forget what he learnt in the beginning.</p>
<p><small>AND HE WHO MAKES USE OF THE CROWN WILL PASS AWAY AND PERISH</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that he who makes use of the Expressed Name<sup><xref rid="fn451">53</xref></sup> has no portion in the world to come.</p>

<ftnote id="fn403">(5) The usual and literal connotation of the phrase is: &#x2018;he judged a judgment of truth according to its truth&#x2019;, i.e. he dealt out justice strictly and in all its severity. This quality, however, is inapplicable to Aaron in this context where he is described as overlooking faults. In the parallel passage in the Yal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D; on the verse in Num. <italic>ibid.</italic>, this phrase is descriptive of Moses and not of Aaron; consequently the commentators have resorted to emendation here in order to make the passages correspond (cf. GRA and the Glosses of J. Bachrach). The translation given in the text retains the original reading and is to be interpreted: he regarded every matter in the light of truth, i.e. he considered every person&#x2019;s action as right (he &#x2018;gave him right&#x2019;), or at least endeavoured to see justification in every person&#x2019;s action, taking a favourable view of it.

<title>CHAPTER XIII</title>
<p label="1.">S<small>HAMMAI SAID: MAKE YOUR STUDY OF THE TORAH A FIXED HABIT; SAY LITTLE AND DO MUCH; AND RECEIVE ALL MEN WITH A CHEERFUL COUNTENANCE</small>.</p>
<p label="2."><small>MAKE YOUR STUDY OF THE TORAH A FIXED HABIT</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that if a man hears a theme from a Sage in the House of Study, he should not treat it as something casual, but should regard it as a fixed norm. Moreover, what a man learns he should perform and teach to others that they, too, may perform it; as it is stated, <italic>That ye may learn them, and observe to do them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn452">1</xref></sup> It similarly states of Ezra, <italic>For Ezra had set his heart to seek the law of the Lord, and to do it</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn453">2</xref></sup> the verse continuing, <italic>And to teach in Israel statutes and ordinances</italic>.</p>
<p label="3."><small>SAY LITTLE AND DO MUCH</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that the righteous say little and do much, whereas the wicked say much and do not even a little. Whence do we know that the righteous say little and do much? We find it so with Abraham our father who said to the angels, &#x2018;You will eat with me to-day a morsel of bread&#x2019;; as it is stated, <italic>And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and stay ye your heart</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn454">3</xref></sup> But in the end, see how much Abraham prepared for the ministering angels&#x2014;he went and prepared for them three oxen and nine measures of fine flour&#x0021; Whence do we know that he prepared for them nine measures of fine flour? For it is stated, <italic>And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said: Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn455">4</xref></sup> Now the word <italic>three</italic> signifies literally what it says; <italic>fine</italic> also implies three making six; and <italic>meal</italic> implies a further three, making nine in all. And whence do we know that he prepared for them three oxen? For it is stated, <italic>And Abraham ran unto the herd and fetched a calf tender</italic> [<italic>and good</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn456">5</xref></sup> Now the word <italic>herd</italic> implies one, <italic>calf</italic> implies another making two, and <italic>tender</italic> implies a third, thus making three in all. Some say that the word <italic>good</italic> implies a fourth. <italic>And he gave them unto the servant, and he hastened to dress them:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn457">6</xref></sup> he gave them to his son Ishmael in order to train him in the performance of good deeds.</p>
<p>The Holy One, blessed be He, likewise said little and did much; as it is stated, <italic>And He said unto Abram: Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; and also that nation whom they shall serve, will I judge; and afterward shall they come out with great substance</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn458">7</xref></sup> [In His announcement] He only used a word of two letters, <italic>daleth</italic> and <italic>nun</italic>; eventually when the Holy One, blessed be He, inflicted punishment upon the enemies of Israel, He did so with seventy-two letters; as it is stated, <italic>Or hath God assayed to go and take Him a nation from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an out-stretched arm, and by great terrors?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn459">8</xref></sup> Hence you learn that when He inflicted punishment upon Israel&#x2019;s enemies He only did so with seventy-two letters.</p>
<p>And whence do we know that the wicked say much and do not even a little? We find it so with Ephron who said to Abraham, <italic>A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver</italic>, [<italic>what is that betwixt me and thee</italic>]<italic>?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn460">9</xref></sup> Eventually when Abraham weighed out the silver for him, it is stated, <italic>And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver &#x2026;</italic> [<italic>current money with the merchant</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn461">10</xref></sup></p>
<p label="4."><small>AND RECEIVE ALL MEN WITH A CHEERFUL COUNTENANCE</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that if a man presents the most precious gifts in the world to his fellow but gives them with a sullen countenance, Scripture regards him as having presented him with nothing. On the other hand, he who receives his fellow with a cheerful countenance, though he give him nothing, Scripture accounts it to him as though he had presented him with the most precious gifts in the world.</p>

(<italic>go&#x00EF;</italic>), should be omitted from the enumeration. The virtue of the number 72 lies in the fact that one of the sacred Names consists of 72 letters.</ftnote>

<p>Hillel the Elder had eighty disciples:<sup><xref rid="fn462">1</xref></sup> thirty of them were worthy that the Divine Presence should rest upon them as upon Moses our teacher, but their generation was not worthy of it; thirty of them were worthy that the intercalation of the years<sup><xref rid="fn463">2</xref></sup> should be determined by them; and twenty were average. The greatest of them all was Jonathan b. &#x2019;Uzziel,<sup><xref rid="fn464">3</xref></sup> and the least of them all was Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Zakkai. It was said of Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan b.

<p label="6.">When the son of Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Zakkai died, his disciples came in to console him. R. Eliezer came and sat before him and said, &#x2018;My master, is it your wish that I say a word in your presence?&#x2019; He replied to him, &#x2018;Speak&#x2019;. Thereupon he said, &#x2018;Adam, the first man, had a son who died, and he allowed himself to be comforted in his loss. And whence do we know that he accepted condolence? For it is stated, <italic>And Adam knew his wife again</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn480">19</xref></sup> Therefore do you also accept condolence&#x2019;. He retorted, &#x2018;Is it not sufficient for me to bear my own grief that you have to mention Adam&#x2019;s grief?&#x2019; Then R. Joshua<sup><xref rid="fn481">20</xref></sup> entered and said, &#x2018;My master, is it your wish that I say a word in your presence?&#x2019; He replied to him &#x2018;Speak&#x2019;. Thereupon he said, &#x2018;Job had sons and daughters who all died in one day and he allowed himself to be comforted; you too accept condolence. And whence do we know that Job accepted condolences? For it is stated, <italic>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn482">21</xref></sup> He retorted, &#x2018;Is it not sufficient for me to bear my own grief that you have to mention Job&#x2019;s grief?&#x2019; Next R. Jose entered, sat before him and said, &#x2018;My master, is it your wish that I say a word in your presence?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;Speak&#x2019;. Thereupon he said, &#x2018;Aaron had two grown sons and both died in one day, yet he allowed himself to be comforted, as it is stated, <italic>And Aaron held his peace</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn483">22</xref></sup> the phrase <italic>held his peace</italic> implying that he accepted condolence. Therefore do you also accept condolence&#x2019;. He retorted, &#x2018;Is it not sufficient for me to bear my own grief that you have to mention Aaron&#x2019;s grief?&#x2019; Then R. Simeon entered and said, &#x2018;My master, is it your wish that I say a word in your presence?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;Speak&#x2019;. Thereupon he said, &#x2018;King David had a son who died, and he allowed himself to be comforted; do you also accept condolence. And whence do we know that David accepted condolence? For it is stated, <italic>And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her; and she bore a son, and called his name Solomon</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn484">23</xref></sup> Therefore do you also accept condolence&#x2019;. He retorted, &#x2018;Is it not sufficient for me to bear my own grief that you have to mention King David&#x2019;s grief?&#x2019; Finally R. Eleazar b. &#x2018;Arak<sup><xref rid="fn485">24</xref></sup> entered. When [Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan saw him approaching] he said to his attendant, &#x2018;Take my clothes and follow me to the bath-house, because this man is distinguished and I cannot appear before him as I am&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn486">25</xref></sup> Then R. Eleazar came in and sat before him and said. &#x2018;Let me tell you a parable. To what is the matter like? To a man with whom a king had deposited an article of value. Daily the man wept and exclaimed, &#x201C;Woe is me&#x0021; when will I be free from the responsibility of this trust?&#x201D; You, too, my master, had a son versed in the Torah, who had studied the Pentateuch,<sup><xref rid="fn487">26</xref></sup> Prophets and Hagiographa, Mishnah, <italic>halakoth</italic> and <italic>&#x2019;aggadoth</italic>. He has departed sinless from this world. Surely you should derive comfort from having returned your trust intact&#x0021;&#x2019; Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan said to him, &#x2018;Eleazar my son, you have comforted me as men can comfort&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn488">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>When they left his presence, R. Eleazar said [to his colleagues], &#x2018;I will go to Dimsith,<sup><xref rid="fn489">28</xref></sup> a delectable spot with excellent and refreshing waters&#x2019;. The others said, &#x2018;We will go to Jabneh,<sup><xref rid="fn490">29</xref></sup> a place abounding with scholars and lovers of Torah&#x2019;. Because he went to Dimsith, a delectable spot with excellent and refreshing waters, his fame in the Torah waned;<sup><xref rid="fn491">30</xref></sup> whereas they who went to Jabneh, a place abounding with scholars and lovers of the Torah, their renown in Torah increased.</p>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER XV</title>
<p label="1."><small>THEY EACH SAID THREE THINGS</small>. R. E<small>LIEZER SAID: LET THE HONOUR OF YOUR FELLOW BE DEAR TO YOU AS YOUR OWN; BE NOT EASILY MOVED TO ANGER; REPENT ONE DAY BEFORE YOUR DEATH</small>.</p>
<p><small>LET THE HONOUR OF YOUR FELLOW BE DEAR TO YOU AS YOUR OWN</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that as a man regards his own honour, so should he regard the honour of his fellow; and as a man would not wish to see an ill report spread about his own honour, so should he not wish to see an ill report spread about the honour of his fellow.</p>
<p>Another interpretation of <small>LET THE HONOUR OF YOUR FELLOW BE DEAR TO YOU AS YOUR OWN</small>: Thus if a man once possessed a million and is now deprived of all his wealth, he should not lose his self-respect even to the slightest degree.<sup><xref rid="fn492">1</xref></sup></p>
<p label="2."><small>BE NOT EASILY MOVED TO ANGER</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that a man should be meek like Hillel the Elder and not impatient like Shammai the Elder.</p>
<p>What was the meekness of Hillel the Elder? It is related<sup><xref rid="fn493">2</xref></sup> that two men once wagered with each other the sum of four hundred <italic>zuz</italic>, saying, &#x2018;Whoever will succeed in provoking Hillel to anger will take the four hundred <italic>zuz</italic>&#x2019;. One of them went [to call on Hillel]. The day was the eve of the Sabbath towards dusk, and Hillel was then washing his head. He came, knocked at the door, and called out, &#x2018;Where is Hillel? Where is Hillel?&#x2019; Hillel wrapped himself in his robe and went to him, asking, &#x2018;My son, what do you require?&#x2019; &#x2018;I have a question to ask,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;Ask it,&#x2019; said Hillel. Thereupon he asked, &#x2018;Why are the inhabitants of Palmyra bleary-eyed?&#x2019; He answered, &#x2018;Because they live in sandy deserts, and the winds scatter the sand over their eyes; for that reason their eyes are bleary&#x2019;. The man departed, waited a while, returned, again knocked at the door, and called out, &#x2018;Where is Hillel? Where is Hillel?&#x2019; Hillel wrapped himself in his robe and went out to him, asking, &#x2018;My son, what do you require?&#x2019; &#x2018;I have a question<sup><xref rid="fn494">3</xref></sup> to ask,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;Ask it,&#x2019; said Hillel. Thereupon he asked, &#x2018;Why have the Africans flat feet?&#x2019; He answered, &#x2018;Because they live in marshy places and constantly walk in the water;<sup><xref rid="fn495">4</xref></sup> for that reason their feet are flat&#x2019;. The man departed, waited a while, returned, again knocked at the door and called out, &#x2018;Where is Hillel? Where is Hillel?&#x2019; He wrapped himself in his robe, and went out to him, asking, &#x2018;What do you wish to ask?&#x2019; &#x2018;I have a question to ask,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;Ask it,&#x2019; said Hillel. The man then wrapped himself in his cloak and sat down before him. &#x2018;What do you wish to ask?&#x2019; said Hillel. The other rejoined, &#x2018;Is that the manner in which a President<sup><xref rid="fn496">5</xref></sup> replies? May there not be many like you in Israel&#x0021;&#x2019; &#x2018;Heaven forfend&#x0021;&#x2019; exclaimed Hillel, &#x2018;mind your temper. What is it you require?&#x2019; He asked, &#x2018;Why have the Babylonians long heads?&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn497">6</xref></sup> He answered, &#x2018;My son, you have asked an important question. Because they lack skilful midwives there, as soon as a child is born it is placed in the arms<sup><xref rid="fn498">7</xref></sup> of male and female slaves; for that reason their heads are long. Here [in the Holy Land] there are expert midwives, and as soon as a child is born it is placed in a cot and its head is massaged; for that reason their heads are round&#x2019;. Then said the man to him, &#x2018;Through you I have lost four hundred <italic>zuz</italic>&#x2019;. Hillel retorted, &#x2018;Hillel is worthy that you should lose [twice] four hundred <italic>zuz</italic> on his account, and Hillel should not lose his temper&#x2019;.</p>
<p label="3.">What was the impatience of Shammai the Elder? It is related that a man<sup><xref rid="fn499">8</xref></sup> once came and stood before Shammai and said to him, &#x2018;Master, how many Torahs have you?&#x2019; He answered, &#x2018;Two, one written and one oral&#x2019;. The man said, &#x2018;I believe you regarding the written, but I do not believe you regarding the oral&#x2019;. Shammai rebuked him and [24<italic>b</italic>] angrily drove him away. The man then came before Hillel and asked, &#x2018;Master, how many Torahs were given [to Israel]&#x2019;. He answered, &#x2018;Two, one written and one oral&#x2019;. He said, &#x2018;I believe you regarding the written, but I do not believe you regarding the oral&#x2019;. Hillel said to him, &#x2018;My son, take a seat&#x2019;. He then wrote the alphabet for him. Hillel asked him, &#x2018;What is this letter?&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn500">9</xref></sup> &#x2018;An <italic>alef</italic>,&#x2019; he replied. Hillel said, &#x2018;It is not an <italic>alef</italic> but a <italic>beth</italic>&#x2019;. He asked, &#x2018;And what is this letter?&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn501">10</xref></sup> &#x2018;A <italic>beth</italic>,&#x2019; he replied. Hillel said, &#x2018;It is not a <italic>beth</italic> but a <italic>gimel</italic>&#x2019;. &#x2018;Moreover, how do you know that this letter is <italic>alef</italic>, that <italic>beth</italic>, and the other <italic>gimel?</italic>&#x2019; continued Hillel. He replied, &#x2018;So it has been handed down to us by our forebears: this is <italic>alef</italic>, that <italic>beth</italic>, and the other <italic>gimel</italic>&#x2019;. &#x2018;Just as you have accepted this<sup><xref rid="fn502">11</xref></sup> on trust, so accept the other<sup><xref rid="fn503">12</xref></sup> on trust.&#x2019;</p>
<p>Once a gentile was passing behind a Synagogue when he heard a child reciting the verse, <italic>And these are the garments which they shall make: a breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn504">13</xref></sup> He came to Shammai and asked him, &#x2018;Master, for whom is all that finery?&#x2019; He answered, &#x2018;For the High Priest who stands and ministers at the altar&#x2019;. The gentile said to him, &#x2018;Make me a proselyte on condition that you appoint me High Priest&#x2019;. Shammai retorted, &#x2018;Is there no priest in Israel and have we no High Priests in Israel to serve in the High-priesthood, except this insignificant proselyte who comes with staff and scrip only and wishes to minister as High Priest?&#x2019; He rebuked him and angrily drove him away. The gentile then came to Hillel and said to him, &#x2018;Master, make me a proselyte on condition that you appoint me High Priest, so that I may stand and minister at the altar&#x2019;. Hillel said to him, &#x2018;Take a seat, and I will tell you something. If a man wishes to have an audience of a human king, is it not proper for him to learn how to make his entrance and his exit?&#x2019; &#x2018;Certainly,&#x2019; answered the gentile. Hillel continued, &#x2018;As you are desirous to have an audience of the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, is it not all the more incumbent upon you to learn how to enter the Holy of Holies, how to trim the lamps, how to approach the altar, how to order the table, how to arrange the altar-pile?&#x2019; &#x2018;Do whatever seems good to you,&#x2019; said the gentile. Hillel then wrote the alphabet for him which he soon learnt, and then [he studied] the Book of Leviticus. So he continued until he reached the verse, <italic>And the common man that draweth nigh shall be put to death</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn505">14</xref></sup> Then the proselyte reasoned within himself thus, &#x2018;If Israelites who are designated sons of the All-present,<sup><xref rid="fn506">15</xref></sup> of whom the Divine Presence declares, <italic>Ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn507">16</xref></sup> are warned by Scripture, <italic>And the common man that draweth nigh shall be put to death</italic>, how much more so does it apply to me, an insignificant proselyte, who am come with nothing but my scrip&#x0021;&#x2019; In this manner the proselyte was reconciled of his own accord. He came to Hillel the Elder and said to him, &#x2018;May all the blessings of the Torah alight on your head&#x0021; Had you been like Shammai the Elder, I would never have entered the assembly of Israel. The impatience of Shammai sought to destroy me out of this world and out of the world to come; your gentleness brought me to life in this world and in the world to come&#x2019;. It is reported that that proselyte became the father of two sons; one he named Hillel and the other Gamaliel. They were called &#x2018;Hillel&#x2019;s proselytes&#x2019;.</p>
<p label="4."><small>REPENT ONE DAY BEFORE YOUR DEATH</small>. The disciples asked R. Eliezer.<sup><xref rid="fn508">17</xref></sup> &#x2018;Does, then, a man know on which day he will die that he should repent [the day before]?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;All the more reason that he repent to-day lest he die tomorrow, or that he repent to-morrow lest he die the day after; as a consequence his whole life is spent in repentance&#x2019;.</p>
<p>R. Jose b. Judah said in the name of R. Judah b. R. Ilai, who said it in the name of his father R. Ilai, who reported it in the name of R. Eliezer the Great: <small>REPENT ONE DAY BEFORE YOUR DEATH; WARM YOURSELF BEFORE THE FIRE OF THE SAGES, BUT BEWARE OF THEIR GLOWING COALS LEST YOU BE SCORCHED, FOR THEIR BITE IS THE BITE OF A FOX, AND THEIR STING IS THE STING OF A SCORPION; YEA ALL THEIR WORDS ARE LIKE COALS OF FIRE</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn509">18</xref></sup></p>

<title>CHAPTER XVI</title>
<p label="1.">R. J<small>OSHUA SAID: THE EVIL EYE, THE EVIL INCLINATION, AND THE HATRED OF MANKIND DRIVE A MAN OUT OF THE WORLD</small>.</p>
<p><small>THE EVIL EYE</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that as a man regards his own house, so he should regard the house of his fellow; and as a man would not wish an evil report spread about his wife and children, so he should not wish an evil report spread about his fellow&#x2019;s wife and children.</p>
<p>Another interpretation. What is meant by <small>THE EVIL EYE</small>? It teaches that no man should begrudge the learning of his fellow. The story is told of a man who looked with a grudging eye upon his colleague&#x2019;s learning that his life was cut short and he departed [prematurely from the world].</p>
<p label="2."><small>THE EVIL INCLINATION</small>. What does this mean? It has been said that the evil inclination is senior to the good inclination by thirteen years,<sup><xref rid="fn510">1</xref></sup> for it grows with and accompanies the child from the moment it comes forth from the mother&#x2019;s womb. If the child begins to profane the Sabbath it<sup><xref rid="fn511">2</xref></sup> does not deter him; if he is about to take life it does not deter him; if he is about to commit an immoral act it does not deter him. After thirteen years, however, the good inclination is born in him. If then he is about to profane the Sabbath it<sup><xref rid="fn512">3</xref></sup> warns him, &#x2018;You fool&#x0021; Scripture states, <italic>Every one that profaneth it shall surely be put to death</italic>&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn513">4</xref></sup> If he is about to take life, it warns him, &#x2018;You fool&#x0021; Scripture states, <italic>Whoso sheddeth man&#x2019;s blood, by man shall his blood be shed</italic>&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn514">5</xref></sup> If he is about to commit an immoral act, it warns him, &#x2018;You fool&#x0021; Scripture states, <italic>Both the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death</italic>&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn515">6</xref></sup> When a man&#x2019;s passions are stirred and he is about to commit an act of lewdness, all his limbs are ready to obey him, because the evil inclination is king over the two hundred and forty-eight limbs of man. On the other hand, when a man is about to perform an act of piety, all his limbs become sluggish,<sup><xref rid="fn516">7</xref></sup> because the evil inclination which is within him bears sway over the two hundred and forty-eight limbs of his body, whereas the good inclination is like one who is confined in prison, as it is stated, <italic>For out of prison he came forth to be king</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn517">8</xref></sup> which verse has been interpreted as referring to the good inclination.<sup><xref rid="fn518">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Others interpret this verse as referring to the righteous Joseph. When that wicked woman<sup><xref rid="fn519">10</xref></sup> came [to tempt him] she afflicted him with her words, saying, &#x2018;I will have you imprisoned&#x2019;; and he replied, &#x2018;<italic>The Lord looseth the prisoners</italic>&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn520">11</xref></sup> She said, &#x2018;I will have your eyes plucked out&#x2019;; and he replied, &#x2018;<italic>The Lord openeth the eyes of the blind</italic>&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn521">12</xref></sup> She said, &#x2018;I will bend your stature&#x2019;; and he replied, &#x2018;<italic>The Lord raiseth up them that are bowed down</italic>&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn522">13</xref></sup> She said, &#x2018;I will accuse you of sin&#x2019;;<sup><xref rid="fn523">14</xref></sup> and he replied, &#x2018;<italic>The Lord loveth the righteous</italic>&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn524">15</xref></sup> She said, &#x2018;I will make you a stranger&#x2019;;<sup><xref rid="fn525">16</xref></sup> and he replied, &#x2018;<italic>The Lord preserveth the strangers</italic>&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn526">17</xref></sup> Finally he said, &#x2018;<italic>How then can I do this great wickedness</italic>&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn527">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Marvel not at the [virtue of the] righteous Joseph, for consider the case of R. Zadok, the greatest man of his generation. When he was taken captive, a certain matron acquired him [as a slave] and sent in a beautiful maid-servant to him. As soon as he saw her, he turned his eyes to the wall so as not to look upon her, and sat absorbed in study the whole night long. In the morning the girl went and complained to her mistress, saying, &#x2018;I would rather die than be given to that man&#x0021;&#x2019; [The matron] sent for him and asked, &#x2018;Why did you not treat this woman as men usually act?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;What else could I do, seeing that I belong to the High-priestly line? I am from a noble family and said to myself, &#x201C;[I must refrain] lest I cohabit with her and increase the number of illegitimate children in Israel&#x201D; &#x2019;. On hearing his words, she ordered [his release] and set him free with great honour.</p>
<p>Do not marvel at [the virtue of] R. Zadok, for consider the case of R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba who was greater than he. When R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba came to a certain land,<sup><xref rid="fn528">19</xref></sup> a malicious accusation was laid against him before the Ruler. The latter sent in two beautiful women to him who had bathed, anointed and adorned themselves like brides for their grooms. They importuned him throughout the night, each saying, &#x2018;Turn to me&#x2019;. He sat between them, spat [in disgust], and turned to neither of them. They went and complained to the Ruler, saying, &#x2018;We would rather die than be given to that man&#x0021;&#x2019; He sent for him and asked, &#x2018;Why did you not treat these women as men usually act towards women? Are they not beautiful? Are they not human like yourself? Did not He Who created you create them?&#x2019; He answered, &#x2018;I could not do otherwise; their odour seemed to me like the odour of carrion, torn beasts and creeping things&#x2019;.</p>
<p>Do not marvel at [the virtue of] R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba, for consider the case of R. Eliezer the Great who was more distinguished than he. R. Eliezer brought up his sister&#x2019;s daughter, and for thirteen years she [slept] with him in one bed until she reached puberty. Then he said to her, &#x2018;Go and get married&#x2019;. She replied, &#x2018;Am I not your maid, [even contented] to be a servant to wash the feet of your disciples?&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn529">20</xref></sup> He said to her, &#x2018;My daughter, I am now an old man; go and marry a young man of your own age&#x2019;. She replied, &#x2018;Have I not already told you that I am your maid, [even contented] to be a servant to wash the feet of your disciples?&#x2019; When he heard her words, he obtained her consent to a betrothal and married her.</p>
<p label="3.">R. Reuben b. I&#x1E93;troboli said: How can a man keep far away from the evil inclination which is within his body? For the first drop which a man injects into a woman is the evil inclination.<sup><xref rid="fn530">21</xref></sup> Moreover, the evil inclination dwells at the entrances of the heart, as it is stated, <italic>Sin coucheth at the door</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn531">22</xref></sup> It already speaks to the human being while he is an infant in the cot, saying, &#x2018;That man seeks to kill you&#x2019;, and [in consequence the infant] is ready to pluck out his hair.<sup><xref rid="fn532">23</xref></sup> When an infant lies in his cot and places his hand upon a snake or a scorpion so that he is bitten, this was caused by none other than the evil inclination which is within his body. Or when he lays his hand on glowing coals and is burnt, this was caused by none other than the evil inclination which is within his body, since the evil inclination it is that drives him headlong [to destruction]. Observe, however, a kid or lamb: when it sees a well it turns back, since there is no evil inclination in a beast [to lead it into harm].</p>
<p>R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: I will explain it to you by a parable. To what is the evil inclination like? [25<italic>a</italic>] To a piece of iron which is cast into the fire. As long as it is in the fire one can make of it whatever vessel he wishes. So it is with the evil inclination: there is no other remedy for it but the study of the Torah which is likened to fire;<sup><xref rid="fn533">24</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat, and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink; for thou wilt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the Lord will reward thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn534">25</xref></sup> Read not <italic>will reward</italic> [<italic>yeshallem</italic>] <italic>thee</italic> but &#x2018;will make him at peace [<italic>yashlim</italic>] with thee.&#x2019;</p>
<p>R. Judah the Prince said: I will explain it to you by a parable. To what is the evil inclination like? To the case of two men who entered an inn and one of them was arrested on a charge of robbery. When asked, &#x2018;Who was with you [as an accomplice]?&#x2019; he could reply, &#x2018;There was no one with me&#x2019;; but he says to himself, &#x2018;Since I am to be executed, let my fellow be executed along with me&#x2019;. In the same way the evil inclination speaks, &#x2018;Since I am doomed in the world to come, I will drag the entire body with me to destruction&#x2019;.</p>
<p>R. Simeon b. Yo&#x1E25;ai said: By this reasoning Israel will never see Gehinnom. This may be explained by a parable. To what is the matter like? To a mortal king who had a field of poor quality. Certain men came and leased it at a rental of ten <italic>kors</italic> of wheat annually. They manured it, hoed it, watered it and weeded it; but they could only make it yield one <italic>kor</italic> of wheat during the year. The king asked them for an explanation and they replied, &#x2018;Our sovereign lord&#x0021; You know that the field which you leased to us originally yielded nothing to you; now after manuring it, weeding it and watering it, we made it yield us no more than one <italic>kor</italic> of wheat&#x2019;. In like manner Israel will in the future plead with the Holy One, blessed be He, &#x2018;Lord of the universe&#x0021; Thou knowest that it is the evil inclination that incites us, as it is stated, <italic>For He knoweth our impulse</italic>&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn535">26</xref></sup></p>
<p label="4."><small>AND THE HATRED OF MANKIND</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that a man should not adopt the rule: Love the Sages and hate the disciples, or Love the disciples and hate the <italic>&#x2018;Am ha&#x2019;are&#x1E93;</italic>. Let his rule be: Love them all, and hate [only] heretics, apostates, seducers and informers. So said David, <italic>Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate Thee? And do not I strive with those that rise up against thee? I hate them with utmost hatred; I count them mine enemies</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn536">27</xref></sup> But does not Scripture declare, <italic>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the Lord?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn537">28</xref></sup> And why? Because I created him. If he acts as <italic>thy people</italic> should act,<sup><xref rid="fn538">29</xref></sup> then you must love him, but if not, then you must not love him. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: With a great oath<sup><xref rid="fn539">30</xref></sup> was this command said, <italic>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. I the Lord have created him</italic><sup><xref rid="fn540">31</xref></sup>&#x2014;if you love him, I am trustworthy to give you a good reward; but if you do not, I am a Judge to punish you.<sup><xref rid="fn541">32</xref></sup></p>

<title>CHAPTER XVII</title>
<p label="1.">R. J<small>OSE SAID: LET THE PROPERTY OF YOUR FELLOW BE AS DEAR TO YOU AS YOUR OWN; FIT YOURSELF FOR THE STUDY OF THE TORAH, SINCE IT DOES NOT COME TO YOU BY INHERITANCE</small>.</p>
<p label="2.">What does this mean? It teaches that as a man regards his own property, so he should regard the property of his fellow; and as a man would not wish to see an evil report spread about his own property, so he should not wish to see an evil report spread about the property of his fellow.</p>
<p>Another interpretation of <small>LET THE PROPERTY OF YOUR FELLOW BE AS DEAR TO YOU AS YOUR OWN</small>. What does it mean? When a disciple comes to you and asks for instruction, if it is within your power to teach him, do so; but if not, dismiss him at once and take no money from him;<sup><xref rid="fn542">1</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>Say not unto thy neighbour: Go and come again, and to-morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn543">2</xref></sup></p>
<p label="3."><small>FIT YOURSELF FOR THE STUDY OF THE TORAH, SINCE IT DOES NOT COME TO YOU BY INHERITANCE</small>. Thus when Moses our teacher perceived that his sons had not the knowledge of the Torah to be able to succeed him in leadership, he wrapped himself in his robe and stood up to pray. He said, &#x2018;Sovereign of the universe&#x0021; Make known to me who will come in and go out at the head of this people, as it is stated, <italic>And Moses spoke unto the Lord, saying: Let the Lord, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation, who may go out before them, and who may come in before them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn544">3</xref></sup> Thereupon the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, &#x2018;Moses, <italic>take thee Joshua</italic>&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn545">4</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, further said to Moses, &#x2018;Go and appoint for him an interpreter<sup><xref rid="fn546">5</xref></sup> that he may expound [the Torah] in your presence at the head of the notables of Israel&#x2019;. At that time Moses said to Joshua, &#x2018;Joshua, as for this people that I am delivering into your charge, they are not he-goats but kids; I am not delivering to you sheep but lambs, because as yet they have not occupied themselves with the commandments, and so have not reached the stage of he-goats;<sup><xref rid="fn547">6</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock and feed thy kids, beside the shepherds&#x2019; tents</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn548">7</xref></sup></p>
<p label="4.">Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Zakkai<sup><xref rid="fn549">8</xref></sup> was once walking in the market place when he observed a young woman picking grains of barley from under the feet of the cattle of the Arabs. He said to her, &#x2018;My daughter, who are you?&#x2019; She remained silent. Again he asked her, &#x2018;My daughter, who are you?&#x2019; She continued silent [for a time], and then said to him, &#x2018;Wait a moment&#x2019;. She wrapped herself in her hair, sat down before him and said, &#x2018;I am the daughter of Na&#x1E33;dimon b. Gorion&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn550">9</xref></sup> He asked, &#x2018;My daughter, what became of your father&#x2019;s wealth?&#x2019; She replied, &#x2018;Master, is not the proverb current in Jerusalem, &#x201C;The salt<sup><xref rid="fn551">10</xref></sup> of wealth is its diminution [by charitable use] (or, according to another version, &#x201C;[The salt of wealth is] benevolence&#x201D;)?&#x2019; &#x2018;And what became of the wealth of your father-in-law?&#x2019; he asked. She replied, &#x2018;The one swallowed up the other&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn552">11</xref></sup> Then Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Zakkai turned to his disciples and said, &#x2018;All my life I have read the verse, <italic>If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock</italic>, but did not understand its significance until to-day when I have realized its meaning, viz. that Israel will come under the domination of the lowest of the nations, and not merely under the domination of the lowest of the nations but will be among the dung of their cattle&#x2019;. The young woman then asked him, &#x2018;Master, do you remember when you put your signature to my marriage contract?&#x2019; &#x2018;I do,&#x2019; he replied; and turning to his disciples he said, &#x2018;By the Temple Service&#x0021; I signed this young woman&#x2019;s marriage contract, and it mentioned a settlement of one million Tyrian golden dinars&#x2019;. [It is related that] the members of the family to which the young woman belonged never set out from their house to go to the Temple until the finest woollen rugs were spread before them.</p>
<p label="5.">The story<sup><xref rid="fn553">12</xref></sup> is told of a young woman who was taken captive together with her ten maids. A Gentile acquired her and she grew up in his house. One day he handed her a jug and said, &#x2018;Go and fetch me some water&#x2019;. One of her maids arose and took it from her. &#x2018;What is this?&#x2019; he asked; and she replied, &#x2018;By your life, master&#x0021; I was one of five hundred maids of this young woman&#x2019;s mother.&#x2019; When he heard these words, he at once set her free together with her ten maids.</p>
<p label="6.">Another story is told of a young woman who was taken captive. A Gentile acquired her and she grew up in his house. The Angel of Dreams<sup><xref rid="fn554">13</xref></sup> appeared to him and said, &#x2018;Send the young woman from your house&#x2019;. His wife said to him, &#x2018;Do not send her away&#x2019;. Again the Angel of Dreams appeared to him and said, &#x2018;If you do not send her away I will kill you&#x2019;, and he let her go. He followed her, saying [to himself], &#x2018;I must go and see what will befall this young woman&#x2019;. On her journey she became thirsty and went down to drink at a spring, When she placed her hand on the wall, a snake came and bit her so that she died, [her body] floating on the surface of the water. He went down, took her out and buried her. On his return home he remarked to his wife, &#x2018;This people whom you behold bear the anger of none other than their Father in heaven&#x2019;.</p>
<p label="7."><small>AND LET ALL YOUR DEEDS BE DONE FOR THE SAKE OF HEAVEN</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn555">14</xref></sup> That means, for the sake of the Torah, as it is stated, <italic>In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He will direct thy paths</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn556">15</xref></sup></p>

<title>CHAPTER XVIII</title>
<p label="1.">Likewise<sup><xref rid="fn560">1</xref></sup> R. Judah the Prince used to recount the praises of the following Sages: R. &#x1E6C;arfon, R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba, R. Eleazar b. Azariah, R. Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Nuri and R. Jose the Galilean.</p>
<p>R. &#x1E6C;arfon he described as a heap of stones (another version: a heap of nuts). When a man removes one, they all topple and fall over each other. So it was with R. &#x1E6C;arfon; whenever a disciple came to him and said, &#x2018;Teach me&#x2019;, he would produce for him [instruction in] Scripture, Mishnah, Midrash, <italic>halakoth</italic> and <italic>&#x2019;aggadoth</italic>. When that disciple departed, he left laden with blessing and [intellectual] wealth.</p>
<p>R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba he described as a treasury with compartments.<sup><xref rid="fn561">2</xref></sup> To what may [25<italic>b</italic>] R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba be compared? To a pedlar who takes his sack and goes into a field. When he finds wheat he drops it in the sack; similarly when he finds barley, spelt, beans and lentils he drops them all in the sack. On returning home he sorts them all out, putting the wheat apart, the barley apart, the spelt, the beans, the lentils all apart. Such was the practice of R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba: he sorted all the Torah [he amassed] into its various compartments.<sup><xref rid="fn562">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Eleazar b. Azariah he described as a perfumer&#x2019;s chest. To what may R. Eleazar be compared? To a perfumer who takes his chest with him and enters a city. The townsfolk come out and enquire, &#x2018;Have you fine oil? Have you spikenard oil? Have you balsam oil?&#x2019; and find that he has everything [they require]. So it was with R. Eleazar b. Azariah. When a disciple came to him and enquired about Scripture he enlightened him, about Mishnah he enlightened him, about Midrash or <italic>halakoth</italic> or <italic>&#x2019;aggadoth</italic> he enlightened him. When the disciple departed he left laden with [intellectual] wealth and blessing.</p>
<p label="2.">When R. Joshua was an old man, his disciples came to visit him.<sup><xref rid="fn563">4</xref></sup> He said to them, &#x2018;My sons, what new interpretation was there at the House of Study to-day?&#x2019; They replied, &#x2018;We are your disciples and drink your waters&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn564">5</xref></sup> He said to them, &#x2018;Heaven forfend&#x0021; No generation is orphaned of its Sages.<sup><xref rid="fn565">6</xref></sup> Whose Sabbath<sup><xref rid="fn566">7</xref></sup> was it?&#x2019; They replied, &#x2018;It was the Sabbath of R. Eleazar b. Azariah&#x2019;. He asked, &#x2018;And what was the theme of his discourse to-day?&#x2019; They answered, &#x2018;It was the section [beginning], <italic>Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones</italic>&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn567">8</xref></sup> He further asked, &#x2018;What exposition did he give in connection with it?&#x2019; They said, &#x2018;His comment was as follows: The men came to learn, the women to listen, but why had the little ones to come? In order to grant a good reward to those who brought them&#x2019;. He said to them, &#x2018;You had such a precious pearl in your possession and sought to withhold it from me&#x0021; Had you visited me only for the purpose of imparting this to me, it would have been sufficient&#x2019;. They said to him, &#x2018;He also gave this exposition: <italic>The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails well fastened are the words of masters of assemblies:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn568">9</xref></sup> as the goad guides the heifer along its furrows, so do the words of the Torah guide a man along the paths of life. But [should you contend,] As the goad is movable so the words of the Torah are likewise movable,<sup><xref rid="fn569">10</xref></sup> the text adds, <italic>And as nails well fastened:</italic> As nails well fastened cannot be pulled out, so the words of the Torah cannot be dislodged. <italic>Masters of assemblies:</italic> these are the disciples of the wise who enter [the House of Study] and sit in several groups; some declare a thing forbidden others declaring it permitted, some pronounce a thing unclean others pronouncing it clean, some rule a thing unfit others ruling it fit. Now lest a man say to you, &#x201C;I will sit idle and not study&#x201D;, the text continues, <italic>They were given from one shepherd</italic>, i.e. one God created them,<sup><xref rid="fn570">11</xref></sup> one leader<sup><xref rid="fn571">12</xref></sup> gave them, the Lord of all creation uttered them. Therefore make your ear like a funnel and allow to enter therein the words of those who forbid and those who permit, the words of those who pronounce unclean and of those who pronounce clean, the words of those who rule it unfit and of those who rule it fit&#x2019;.</p>
<p label="3.">R. Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Nuri he described as a chest [filled with] <italic>halakoth</italic>.</p>
<p>R. Jose the Galilean he described as a collector of the finest, devoid of arrogance; because he held fast to the rule of the Sages<sup><xref rid="fn572">13</xref></sup> derived from Mount Sinai, and diligently taught all the wise men of Israel.</p>
<p label="4.">Issi b. Judah used to describe certain Sages in these terms:<sup><xref rid="fn573">14</xref></sup> R. Meir was a wise man and a scribe;<sup><xref rid="fn574">15</xref></sup> R. Judah was a wise man when he desired to be such;<sup><xref rid="fn575">16</xref></sup> the Mishnah of R. Eliezer b. Jacob was little and good;<sup><xref rid="fn576">17</xref></sup> R. Jose always had his reasons; R. Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Nuri was a chest [filled with] <italic>halakoth;</italic> R. Jose the Galilean was a collector of the very finest, devoid of arrogance; R. Simeon b. Gamaliel was a shop stocked with the best purple; R. Simeon studied much and forgot little. Later when R. Simeon met Issi b. Judah he said to him, &#x2018;Why do you prate about me before the Sages?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;I merely said that you study much and forget little, and the little you do forget is but the bran of your learning&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn577">18</xref></sup></p>

<p label="1.">&#x2018;A&#x1E33;abya b. Mahalalel said: Whosoever takes four things to heart<sup><xref rid="fn578">1</xref></sup> will never sin: whence he came, whither he is going, what he is destined to become, and who is his Judge. &#x2018;Whence he came&#x2019;&#x2014;from a place of darkness; &#x2018;whither he is going&#x2019;&#x2014;to a place of thick darkness; &#x2018;what he is destined to become&#x2019;&#x2014;dust, worms and maggots; &#x2018;and who is his Judge&#x2019;&#x2014;the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He.</p>
<p label="2.">R. Simeon said: Man came from a place of darkness and returns to a place of darkness. He came from a fetid drop, from a place which no eye can behold. And what is he destined to become? Dust, worms and maggots, as it is stated, <italic>How much less man, that is a worm&#x0021; and the son of man, that is a maggot&#x0021;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn579">2</xref></sup> R. Eleazar b. Jacob said: <italic>Man that is a worm</italic> when alive, <italic>and the son of man that is a maggot</italic> when dead. In what sense is he a worm when alive? By reason of the lice [which infest him]. And a maggot when dead? By reason of the creeping things which he generates when dead.</p>
<p label="3.">R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: I will illustrate it to you by a parable. To what can the matter be compared? To a king who built a large palace in which he resided,<sup><xref rid="fn580">3</xref></sup> but the waste-pipe of a tannery ran through it and emptied itself at the entrance. Every passer-by exclaimed, &#x2018;How beautiful and magnificent would that palace be if the waste-pipe of the tannery did not run through it&#x0021;&#x2019; Just so is it with man; and if in his present state, when from his entrails issue fetid streams,<sup><xref rid="fn581">4</xref></sup> he lords it over all creatures, how much more would he lord it over all creatures if there were to issue from him streams of fine oil, balsam and spikenard&#x0021;</p>
<p label="4.">When R. Eliezer fell ill, his disciples came to visit him. They sat before him and said, &#x2018;Master, tell us in one word what you have taught us&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn582">5</xref></sup> He replied, &#x2018;What shall I tell you? Go forth and be mindful of the honour of your fellow-man, and when you pray know before Whom you are standing and praying. Then will you merit the life of the world to come&#x2019;.</p>
<p>R. Eleazar said: Five things did we learn from R. Eliezer [on that day], and they afforded us greater pleasure than all that we had enjoyed from him in his lifetime, and they are as follows: If a round cushion, a ball, a shoemaker&#x2019;s last, an amulet or a phylactery, about which you spoke to us, were torn, what would be the law?<sup><xref rid="fn583">6</xref></sup> The answer he gave was: They can contract uncleanness so be careful with them; and [if unclean] they may be immersed as they are. These laws are well established, for they were communicated to Moses on Mount Sinai.<sup><xref rid="fn584">7</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn578">(1) Cf. Aboth III, 1 (Sonc. ed., p. 26) where the more popular version reads: &#x2018;Consider three things&#x2019;, etc., omitting the third item, &#x2018;what he is destined to become&#x2014;dust, worms and maggots&#x2019; as being heterodox in outlook; cf. Finkelstein, <italic>Akiba: Scholar, Saint and Martyr</italic>, pp. 159f, where the maxim of &#x2018;A&#x1E33;abya is described as &#x2018;this unequivocal denial of personal immortality&#x2019;.

In the parallel passage, Ber. 28b (Sonc. ed., p. 173), the text reads: &#x2018;Teach us the ways of life&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn583">(6) The five articles enumerated have in common that they are made of leather and are permanently filled with stuffing. It is established law that an article of leather can contract defilement only if it is a receptacle, i.e. it has a cavity in which it can hold things. Since the articles here listed are <italic>permanently</italic> filled, the Sage held the view that they are not considered to be vessels with receptacles and consequently cannot be ritually defiled. R. Eliezer, however, was of the opinion that since the filling was removable, they were to be considered vessels with receptacles and could contract defilement. Furthermore, if any one of the enumerated articles were torn the opinion was unanimous that it could contract defilement, because some of the filling must have fallen out and in consequence a receptacle was formed. If, in the circumstances stated, the article became unclean, there was a further argument between R. Eliezer and the Sages whether it was necessary to remove <italic>all</italic> the filling before immersion took place. The Sages held the view that this must be done otherwise the immersion would be invalid, since the filling interposed between the vessel and the water. R. Eliezer, on the other hand, ruled that it could be immersed as it was without the removal of the filling. R. Eliezer here put forward his views as ancient traditional rulings. Cf. Kel. XXIII, 1 (Sonc. ed., p. 110).</ftnote>

<p label="1.">R. &#x1E24;ananiah, the deputy High Priest,<sup><xref rid="fn585">1</xref></sup> said: He who lays the words of the Torah to his heart will be freed from the anxieties of the sword, hunger, madness, lust, the evil inclination, adultery, vain thoughts, and of the yoke of human cares; for so it is written in the Book of Psalms by David king of Israel, <italic>The precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn586">2</xref></sup> And he who does not lay the words of the Torah to his heart will be burdened with the anxieties of the sword, hunger, madness, lust, the evil inclination, adultery, vain thoughts, and of the yoke of human cares; for so it is written in the Book of Deuteronomy by Moses our master, <italic>And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever; because thou didst not serve the Lord thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things; therefore shalt thou serve thine enemy whom the Lord shall send against thee in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn587">3</xref></sup> <italic>In hunger:</italic> what does this mean? When a man longs to eat barley bread and cannot afford even that, his enemies demand of him white bread and rich meat. <italic>And in thirst:</italic> what does this mean? When a man longs to drink a drop of sour wine or a drop of beer and cannot afford even that, his enemies demand of him the best wine of all the lands. <italic>And in nakedness:</italic> what does this mean? When a man wishes to wear a woollen or linen shirt and cannot afford even that, his enemies demand of him the finest silks and satins of all the lands. <italic>And in want of all things:</italic> he will be without a lamp, [26<italic>a</italic>] without a knife and without a table. Another interpretation of <italic>And in want of all things:</italic> he will be without vinegar and salt. When people curse one another they say, &#x2018;May there be no vinegar or salt in your house&#x0021;&#x2019;</p>

<p>Another interpretation of <italic>My mother&#x2019;s sons were incensed against me:</italic> this refers to Moses when he fled to Midian; as it is stated, <italic>When Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian; and he sat by a well. Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters &#x2026; and the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them and watered their flocks</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn595">11</xref></sup> Moses came forward and sat in judgment upon [the men].

Thereupon he rose up and helped [the women].<sup><xref rid="fn597">13</xref></sup> Some report the matter as follows: So long as Moses was standing by the edge of the well the waters surged up towards him, but when he moved away the waters receded. At that moment he exclaimed, &#x2018;Woe is me&#x0021; I have abandoned my people and am come to dwell with strangers&#x0021;&#x2019;</p>
<p>Another interpretation of <italic>My mother&#x2019;s sons were incensed against me:</italic> this refers to the people of Israel when they made the golden calf.<sup><xref rid="fn598">14</xref></sup> At first they said, <italic>All that the Lord hath spoken will we do and obey</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn599">15</xref></sup> but later they said, <italic>This is thy god, O Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn600">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation of <italic>My mother&#x2019;s sons were incensed against me</italic>: this refers to the spies when they spread an evil report about the land, and in consequence caused the carcasses of Israel to fall in the wilderness; as it is stated, <italic>Your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn601">17</xref></sup></p>

<p>Another interpretation of <italic>They made me keeper of the vineyards:</italic> this refers to the people of Israel when they were exiled to Babylon. The prophets in their midst arose and bade them, &#x2018;Set apart your <italic>terumah</italic> and your tithes.&#x2019; They replied, &#x2018;It was because we did not separate <italic>terumah</italic> and tithes that we were exiled from our land, and now you bid us to set apart <italic>terumah</italic> and tithes [in exile]?&#x2019; Scripture therefore states, <italic>They made me keeper of the vineyards;</italic> [<italic>but mine own vineyard have I not kept</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn603">19</xref></sup></p>

<p label="1.">R. D<small>OSA B.</small> H<small>ARKINAS SAID: MORNING SLEEP, AND MIDDAY WINE</small>, [<small>AND CHILDREN&#x2019;S TALK, AND SITTING IN THE MEETING-HOUSES OF THE IGNORANT</small>] <small>DRIVE A MAN OUT OF THE WORLD</small>.</p>
<p><small>MORNING SLEEP</small>&#x2014;what does this mean? It teaches that a man should not wilfully sleep late so that the time-limit for the recital of the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic> passes; for if he sleep late so that the time-limit for reciting the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic> passes he consequently neglects the study of the Torah,<sup><xref rid="fn604">1</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>The sluggard saith: There is a lion in the way; yea, a lion is in the streets. The door is turning upon its hinges, and the sluggard is still upon his bed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn605">2</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>MIDDAY WINE</small>&#x2014;what does this mean? It teaches that a man should not form the habit of drinking wine at midday; for when he drinks wine at midday, the consequence is that he neglects the [study of the] whole Torah, as it is stated, <italic>Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a boy, and thy princes feast in the morning</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn606">3</xref></sup> And it continues, <italic>Happy art thou, O land, when thy king is a free man</italic>, [<italic>and thy princes eat in due season&#x0021;</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn607">4</xref></sup> And when is that <italic>due season?</italic> You must say that it is in the time to come, as it is stated, <italic>I the Lord will hasten it</italic><sup><xref rid="fn608">5</xref></sup> <italic>in its due season</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn609">6</xref></sup> Scripture also states, <italic>Like the time it will be said of Jacob and of Israel: What hath God wrought&#x0021;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn610">7</xref></sup> Thus said the Holy One, blessed be He, to Balaam: <italic>Like the time</italic> (<italic>ka&#x2018;eth</italic>), and not &#x2018;in the time&#x2019; (<italic>ba&#x2018;eth</italic>)&#x2014;not in the time in which you live, but <italic>like the time</italic> when I am about to bring deliverance to Israel.</p>
<p><small>CHILDREN&#x2019;S TALK</small>&#x2014;what does this mean? It teaches that a man should not make a practice of sitting and studying at home;<sup><xref rid="fn611">8</xref></sup> because when a man sits and studies at home and engages in conversation with his children and members of his household, the outcome is that he neglects the Torah; and it is stated, <italic>This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein day and night</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn612">9</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>AND SITTING IN THE MEETING-HOUSES OF THE IGNORANT</small>&#x2014;what does this mean? It teaches that a man should not sit with idlers in the market-place;<sup><xref rid="fn613">10</xref></sup> [for when a man sits with idlers in the market-place] it follows that he neglects the Torah, as it is stated, <italic>Happy is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the wicked nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the seat of the scornful. But his delight is in the law of the Lord</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn614">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Meir said: What does the verse mean by <italic>nor sat in the seat of the scornful?</italic> It refers to the theatres and circuses<sup><xref rid="fn615">12</xref></sup> of the Gentiles<sup><xref rid="fn616">13</xref></sup> where men are condemned to death, and it is written, <italic>I hate the gathering of evil-doers</italic> (<italic>mere&#x2018;im</italic>), <italic>and will not sit with the wicked</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn617">14</xref></sup> By <italic>mere&#x2018;im</italic> the wicked are meant, as it is stated, <italic>For evil-doers</italic> (<italic>mere&#x2018;im</italic>) <italic>shall be cut off</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn618">15</xref></sup> And what will be their punishment in the hereafter? Even as it is stated, <italic>For behold the day cometh, it burneth as a furnace; and all the proud, and all that work wickedness shall be stubble</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn619">16</xref></sup> And by <italic>the proud</italic> none other are intended but the scorners, as it is stated, <italic>A proud and haughty man, scorner is his name</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn620">17</xref></sup></p>
<p label="2.">It is related of R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba that once when he was sitting and lecturing to his disciples he recalled the conduct of his youth,<sup><xref rid="fn621">18</xref></sup> and offered up the prayer, &#x2018;I thank Thee, O Lord my God, that Thou hast set my portion with those who sit in the House of Study, and hast not set my portion with the idlers in the market-place&#x2019;.</p>
<ftnote id="fn604">(1) By reciting the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic> one fulfils a dual obligation: the duty of proclaiming the unity of God and that of Torah-study; cf. Yal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D; on Ps. I, 2, &#x00A7;614.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn611">(8) So according to the MSS. V. reads: &#x2018;a man should not make a practice, while studying at home, of engaging in conversation with his wife and children, because all the time he sits at home and studies and converses with his children and members of his household, the outcome is&#x2019;, etc. The proper place for study is the house of learning where his family will not distract him.</ftnote>

<p>Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan b.

<p>R. E<small>LEAZAR B.</small> A<small>ZARIAH SAID: WHERE THERE IS NO TORAH THERE ARE NO MANNERS</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn624">3</xref></sup> etc. He used to say: A man who has good deeds to his credit and has learnt much Torah, to what is he like? To a tree planted by the waters, whose branches are few but whose roots are many, so that even if the four winds of the world come and blow against it they cannot move it from its place; as it is stated, <italic>For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn625">4</xref></sup> etc. But he who has no good deeds to his credit and yet has learnt much Torah, to what is he like?

<p>Rabban Gamaliel said: Provide yourself with a teacher and get a companion:<sup><xref rid="fn627">6</xref></sup> a teacher for wisdom and a companion for study.

<p label="3.">Wisdom does not produce words, nor do words produce wisdom; [the chief thing] is doing.<sup><xref rid="fn630">9</xref></sup> He who multiplies words brings about sin, as it is stated, <italic>In the multitude of words there wanteth not transgression;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn631">10</xref></sup> and it further states, <italic>Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn632">11</xref></sup></p>

<p><sup><xref rid="fn644">12</xref></sup>He used to say: He who learns Torah in his youth, to what is he like?

<p label="2.">But a man who has no good deeds to his credit, though he has studied Torah, to what is he like?

But a man who has no good deeds to his credit, though he has studied much Torah, is like a coating of lime spread on bricks, so that even if the lightest rain falls on it, it will immediately dissolve and fall away.</p>

<p>He used to say: He who learns Torah in his youth, its words are absorbed in his blood and issue from his mouth with clarity; but he who learns Torah only in his old age, its words are not absorbed in his blood and do not issue from his mouth with clarity. Accordingly the proverb runs, &#x2018;If thou hadst no delight in them in thy youth, how canst thou attain them in thy old age?&#x2019;</p>
<p label="5.">He used to say: The words of the Torah are hard to acquire as vessels of gold, and are easily destroyed as glassware; as it is stated, <italic>Gold and glass cannot equal it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn661">7</xref></sup> A comparison is drawn between gold and glass: a golden vessel can be repaired when it is broken, but vessels of glass cannot be repaired when broken unless they are reduced to their original element.<sup><xref rid="fn662">8</xref></sup> And how am I to interpret, <italic>Neither shall the exchange thereof be vessels of fine gold?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn663">9</xref></sup> It teaches that he who toils in [the words of the Torah] and fulfils them, his face shines like fine gold; but he who toils in them and does not fulfil them, his face is dark like glass.<sup><xref rid="fn664">10</xref></sup></p>
<p label="6.">He used to say: A man may study the Torah for twenty years and forget it in two years. How can this be? If he sits idle for six months and does not revise his studies, he will in consequence pronounce the unclean to be clean and the clean to be unclean. [If he continues idle for] twelve months without revision, he will then confuse [the names of] the Sages;<sup><xref rid="fn665">11</xref></sup> if for eighteen months without revision, he will forget the opening words of the chapters; and if twenty-four months without revision, he will forget even the titles [27<italic>a</italic>] of the Tractates.<sup><xref rid="fn666">12</xref></sup> And so, having pronounced the unclean to be clean and the clean to be unclean, having also confused [the names of] the Sages, and forgotten the chapter headings and even the titles of the Tractates, he will eventually sit in silence. Of him Solomon said, <italic>I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding; and, lo, it was all grown over with thistles, the face thereof was covered with nettles, and the stone wall thereof was broken down</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn667">13</xref></sup> When the wall of a vineyard collapses the entire vineyard is soon destroyed.</p>
<p label="7.">He used to say: He who causes another to perform a commandment is regarded by Scripture as if he had performed it himself&#x2026;. <sup><xref rid="fn668">14</xref></sup>This may be illustrated by a parable. To what can it be compared? To a human king who caught a bird and gave it to one of his servants saying, &#x2018;Be careful with the bird. If you guard it, well and good; but if not I will take your life for it&#x2019;. So, too, did the Holy One, blessed be He, say to Israel, &#x2018;I have entrusted the words of the Torah to you. If you guard them, well and good; but if not I will take your lives for them&#x2019;. For it is stated, <italic>Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes saw</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn669">15</xref></sup> [And it is also stated,] <italic>For it is no vain thing for you, because it is your life</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn670">16</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn655">(1) This chapter is devoted entirely to the teachings of Elisha b. &#x2019;Abuyah, a great scholar of the second century <small>C.E.</small> and teacher of R. Meir, who entered too deeply into theosophical speculations and eventually abandoned Judaism. Thereafter he was always referred to as <italic>&#x2019;A&#x1E25;er</italic>, &#x2018;That other one&#x2019;; cf. &#x1E24;ag. 15a (Sonc. ed., pp. 93ff). For a recent and learned study of this &#x2018;outcast&#x2019; scholar, cf. Travers Herford in <italic>Essays Presented to J. H. Hertz</italic>, 1944, pp. 215-225.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn656">(2) The study of the Torah can become a permanent blessing only if it is founded on the good life. This is the theme of all the illustrations quoted.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn657">(3) So according to the MSS. and GRA. V. reads &#x2018;bricks&#x2019;, an obvious error since the contrast is between lime spread on stone and lime spread on bricks, the former enduring whilst the latter flakes off quickly.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn658">(4) The Heb. noun is the Greek for &#x2018;a stone&#x2019;, here a solid base with four polished sides (cf. below XXVIII, 9, p. 137). Since the cup has a wide four-square base, even if it be shaken and pushed, it will retain its balance and not lose its contents.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn659">(5) Reading <span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05DC;&#x05D9;&#x05E0;&#x05D5;&#x05E1;</span>, as found in the MSS. and &#x2018;Aruk. V. reads &#x2018;fine trappings&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn660">(6) Here, too, reading <italic>kalinos</italic> in accordance with the authorities quoted in the preceding note. V. has &#x2018;a bridle to curb it&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn661">(7) Job XXVIII, 17.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn662">(8) i.e. melted by fire and then reshaped.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn663">(9) <italic>ibid.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn664">(10) The meaning is either opaque glass which is dull, or glass which quickly darkens.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn665">(11) Attributing a teaching to the wrong authority.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn666">(12) This is the more logical order and is supported by MSS., cf. Schechter <italic>ad loc.</italic> V. reverses the order, putting &#x2018;the titles of the Tractates&#x2019; before &#x2018;the opening words of the chapters&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn667">(13) Prov. XXIV, 30f.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn668">(14) There seems to be a lacuna here, because the parable which follows has no relation to the preceding statement. GRA inserts here the teaching of R. Dostai b. Yannai in Aboth III, 10 (Sonc. ed., III, 8, p. 32): &#x2018;Whosoever forgets one word of his study, him Scripture regards as though he was guilty against his soul.&#x2019; This dictum is well illustrated by the parable. Cf. Men. 99b (Sonc. ed., p. 607)</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn669">(15) Deut. IV, 9. In Aboth <italic>loc. cit.</italic> this verse is quoted in support of R. Dostai&#x2019;s teaching mentioned in the preceding note.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER XXV</title>
<p label="1.">Ben &#x2018;Azzai said: He whose mind is at ease because of his learning,<sup><xref rid="fn671">1</xref></sup> it is a good omen for him; and he whose mind is ill at ease because of his learning, it is a bad omen for him. He whose mind is at ease with his inclination,<sup><xref rid="fn672">2</xref></sup> it is a good omen for him; and he whose mind is ill at ease with his inclination, it is a bad omen for him. Whoever holds the good opinion of the Sages at the hour of his death, it is a good omen for him; but whoever does not hold the good opinion of the Sages, it is a bad omen for him. Whoever [dies] with his face directed upwards<sup><xref rid="fn673">3</xref></sup> it is a good omen; if it is turned downwards it is a bad omen. If his eyes look straight towards the people [about him] it is a good omen; if they do not look towards the people [about him] it is a bad omen. Whoever [dies] with a cheerful countenance it is a good omen; if with a frowning countenance it is a bad omen.</p>
<p>When Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Zakkai was about to depart from this world,<sup><xref rid="fn674">4</xref></sup> he wept aloud. His disciples said to him, &#x2018;Master&#x0021; Exalted pillar&#x0021; Light of the world&#x0021; Mighty hammer&#x0021; Why do you weep?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;Is it into the presence of a human king that I am going? If he be angry with me his anger endures only in this world; if he imprison me the imprisonment endures only in this world; and if he kill me my death is only in this world. Moreover, him I can appease with words and bribe with money. Behold, I am going into the Presence of the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He. If He be angry with me His anger endures in this world and in the world to come; and Him I cannot appease with words or bribe with money. Furthermore, before me lie two ways, one leading to the Garden of Eden and the other to Gehinnom, and I know not whether I will be condemned to Gehinnom or conducted to the Garden of Eden; and concerning this<sup><xref rid="fn675">5</xref></sup> Scripture declares, <italic>All they that go down to the dust shall kneel before Him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn676">6</xref></sup> Of Moses Scripture states, <italic>And he expired, and died, and was gathered to his people</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn677">7</xref></sup> And it further states, <italic>And I will take away My hand</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn678">8</xref></sup> It also states, <italic>And He spread it before me, and it was written on its face and on its back</italic><sup><xref rid="fn679">9</xref></sup>&#x2014;<italic>face</italic> refers to this world and <italic>back</italic> to the world to come. According to another interpretation <italic>face</italic> refers to the suffering of the righteous on earth and the prosperity of the wicked in this world, and <italic>back</italic> to the reward of the righteous in the hereafter and the punishment of the wicked in Gehinnom. <italic>And there was written therein lamentations, and sweet music, and woe</italic><sup><xref rid="fn680">10</xref></sup>&#x2014;<italic>lamentations</italic> [<italic>&#x1E33;inim</italic>] refers to the punishment of the wicked<sup><xref rid="fn681">11</xref></sup> in this world, as it is stated, <italic>This is the lamentation</italic> [<italic>&#x1E33;inah</italic>] <italic>which shall be chanted; the daughters of the nations shall chant it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn682">12</xref></sup> <italic>Sweet music</italic> [<italic>hegeh</italic>] refers to the reward of the righteous in the hereafter, as it is stated, <italic>With an instrument of ten strings, and with the psaltery; with sweet music</italic> [<italic>higgayon</italic>] <italic>upon the harp</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn683">13</xref></sup> <italic>Woe</italic> [<italic>he</italic>] refers to the punishment of the wicked in the world to come, as it is stated, <italic>Calamity</italic> [<italic>howah</italic>] <italic>shall come upon calamity, and rumour shall be upon rumour</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn684">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>[In his last utterance] he<sup><xref rid="fn685">15</xref></sup> said, &#x2018;Remove all vessels from the house that they be not defiled, and prepare a throne for Hezekiah king of Judah&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn686">16</xref></sup></p>
<p label="2.">He used to say: He who dies in a tranquil frame of mind it is a good omen for him;<sup><xref rid="fn687">17</xref></sup> if in a state of delirium it is a bad omen for him. [If he dies] while speaking it is a good omen; if while silent it is a bad omen. If while conversing about the Torah it is a good omen, about business affairs it is a bad omen; if while engaged upon a religious act it is a good omen, upon a worthless pursuit it is a bad omen. [If he dies] in the midst of a joyous atmosphere it is a good omen, amidst sadness it is a bad omen; [if he dies] smiling it is a good omen, if weeping it is a bad omen. Should a man die on the Sabbath-eve it is a good omen,<sup><xref rid="fn688">18</xref></sup> if at the termination of the Sabbath it is a bad omen. If he dies on the eve of the Day of Atonement it is a bad omen,<sup><xref rid="fn689">19</xref></sup> if at the termination of the Day of Atonement it is a good omen.</p>
<p label="3.">The day when R. Eliezer fell ill was, according to tradition, the Sabbath-eve. R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba and his colleagues came to visit him, and he was sitting in his canopied four-poster<sup><xref rid="fn690">20</xref></sup> while they waited in an anteroom. His son Hyr&#x1E33;anos went in to remove his father&#x2019;s <italic>tefillin</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn691">21</xref></sup> but he would not allow him to do so. Hyr&#x1E33;anos came out weeping and said to the Sages, &#x2018;My masters, it seems that my father&#x2019;s mind is deranged&#x2019;. [Thereupon R. Eliezer] called out, &#x2018;My son, it is not my mind that is deranged but yours, because you put off kindling the Sabbath lamp for which you incur the penalty of death at the hand<sup><xref rid="fn692">22</xref></sup> of Heaven and occupied yourself with the <italic>tefillin</italic> for which you incur only the penalty of transgressing a Rabbinic precept concerning the Sabbath rest&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn693">23</xref></sup> When the Sages perceived that his mind was clear, they entered, sat at a distance of four cubits away from him,<sup><xref rid="fn694">24</xref></sup> and enquired of him, &#x2018;Master, if a round cushion, a ball, a shoe-last, an amulet or a phylactery were torn, can they contract uncleanness?&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn695">25</xref></sup> He replied, &#x2018;They can, and [if they are unclean] they may be immersed as they are. Be careful about these laws, because they are important laws which were communicated to Moses at Sinai&#x2019;. They continued to question him on matters concerning cleanness and uncleanness and the regulations of ritual immersion. They said to him, &#x2018;Master, what is the law in this case?&#x2019; and he answered, &#x2018;It is unclean&#x2019;. &#x2018;And what is the law in that case?&#x2019; and he answered, &#x2018;It is clean&#x2019;. Throughout he pronounced the unclean to be unclean and the clean to be clean. After that R. Eliezer said to the Sages, &#x2018;I am concerned about the disciples of the present generation lest they be punished with death at the hand of Heaven&#x2019;. They asked him, &#x2018;Master, what is the reason?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;Because they did not come and attend upon me&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn696">26</xref></sup> He then said to &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba b. Joseph, &#x2018; &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba, why did you not come and attend upon me?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;Master, I had no leisure&#x2019;. He retorted, &#x2018;I wonder whether you will die a natural death&#x2019;. Some say that R. Eliezer did not make that rejoinder, but as R. Eliezer spoke to his disciples in this manner, R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba at once felt his blood melt within him and exclaimed, &#x2018;Master, what will my death be?&#x2019; and he replied, &#x2018;Yours will be the most cruel of all&#x2019;.</p>
<p>R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba then approached, sat down before him and said, &#x2018;Master teach me now&#x2019;. He began and taught him three hundred <italic>halakoth</italic> on the subject of &#x2018;the bright spot&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn697">27</xref></sup> At that time R. Eliezer raised his two arms and, laying them upon his breast, exclaimed, &#x2018;Alas for these two arms of mine, [the equal of] two scrolls of the Torah, which must leave this world&#x0021; For though all the seas were ink, all reeds quills and all men scribes, they could not set down all the Scripture which I read, all the Mishnah which I studied, and all that I had gained by attending upon the scholars at their sessions. And I took from my teachers no more than a man takes of the sea when he dips his finger in it; and my disciples took no more from me than a paint-stick takes of the paint in the tube.<sup><xref rid="fn698">28</xref></sup> Moreover, I can recite three hundred (another version: three thousand) <italic>halakoth</italic> on the prohibition, <italic>Thou shalt not suffer a sorceress to live</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn699">29</xref></sup> yet no one ever questioned me about them except &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba b. Joseph. For on one occasion he said to me, &#x201C;Master, teach me how cucumbers are planted&#x201D;<sup><xref rid="fn700">30</xref></sup>. So I pronounced a word and the entire field [about us] was filled with cucumbers. He then said to me, &#x201C;You have taught me how they are planted, now teach me how to uproot them&#x201D;. I again pronounced a word and all the cucumbers were gathered in one place&#x2019;.</p>
<p>R. Eleazar b. Azariah enquired of him, &#x2018;Master, what is the law if the shoe is still on the shoemaker&#x2019;s last?&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn701">31</xref></sup> He answered, &#x2018;It is clean&#x2019;. He made reply [to many questions] declaring the unclean to be unclean and the clean to be clean until with the word &#x2018;clean&#x2019; [on his lips] his soul departed. At once R. Eleazar b. Azariah rent his clothes and wept. He went out to the Sages and said, &#x2018;Come, my masters, and behold R. Eliezer who is clean for the world to come, because his soul departed with the word &#x201C;clean&#x201D; [upon his lips]&#x2019;. After the Sabbath, R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba set out and encountered [his master&#x2019;s] bier as it proceeded from Caesarea to Lydda. Forthwith he rent his garments and plucked his hair, and [beat his breast until] his blood flowed to the ground. He wept and cried, &#x2018;Woe is me&#x0021; I grieve for you, my master&#x0021; Woe is me&#x0021; I mourn for you, my teacher who left his whole generation orphaned&#x0021;&#x2019; As they stood in a row<sup><xref rid="fn702">32</xref></sup> he began his funeral oration and said, &#x2018;<italic>My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn703">33</xref></sup> I have many coins, but there is no money-changer to exchange them&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn704">34</xref></sup> [27<italic>b</italic>]</p>
<p label="4.">B<small>EN</small> &#x2018;A<small>ZZAI SAID: RUN TO FULFIL EVEN A LIGHT PRECEPT</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn705">35</xref></sup> He used to say: If you have performed a precept and have no regrets with regard to it, it will in the end draw many precepts in its train. And if one has committed a transgression and has no regrets about it, it will in the end draw many transgressions in its train; <small>FOR ONE PRECEPT LEADS TO ANOTHER PRECEPT, AND ONE TRANSGRESSION TO ANOTHER TRANSGRESSION; FOR THE REWARD OF A PRECEPT IS ANOTHER PRECEPT, AND THE REWARD OF A TRANSGRESSION IS ANOTHER TRANSGRESSION</small>.</p>
<p>He used to say: Desist<sup><xref rid="fn706">36</xref></sup> of your own accord and you will reap the reward for desisting; but let not others make you desist, because they will then reap the reward for making you desist.</p>
<p>He used to say: Step down from your place two or three degrees and sit there, because it is better for you to be told to ascend than to be told to descend; as it is stated, <italic>For better is it that it be said unto thee: Come up hither, than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince, whom thine eyes have seen</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn707">37</xref></sup></p>
<p label="5.">There are three whose life is not worth living, and they are: He who must look to the table of another [for sustenance], he who lives in an attic, and whoever is dominated by his wife. Others add: he whose body is afflicted with sufferings.<sup><xref rid="fn708">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>He used to say: It is easier to rule over the whole world than to sit and teach<sup><xref rid="fn709">39</xref></sup> people who are wrapped in linen robes.<sup><xref rid="fn710">40</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn671">(1) The knowledge which he acquired did not make him overbearing, but confirms him in his faith and helps him to live the good life. Cf. Tosif. Ber. III, 5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn672">(2) i.e. his desires are not in constant conflict within him. A variant reading has &#x2018;his Creator&#x2019; for &#x2018;his inclination&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn673">(3) Indicating that he is prepared to meet his Maker with a clear conscience. Cf. on this passage, Keth. 103b (Sonc. ed., p. 661).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn674">(4) Cf. Ber. 28b (Sonc. ed., p. 173).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn675">(5) The day of his death.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn676">(6) Ps. XXII, 30. This verse is interpreted in Midrash Rabbah, Numbers, XIV, 22 (Sonc. ed., p. 640), as indicating that at death all are led into the Presence of God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn677">(7) This verse is not found of Moses, but only of Abraham (Gen. XXV, 8) and Isaac (<italic>ibid.</italic> XXXV, 29). The text is in disorder, and the verses which follow have but a slender connection with the theme of the passage (cf. GRA and Schechter&#x2019;s notes <italic>ad loc.</italic>). The verse in the text suggests that the righteous are &#x2018;gathered&#x2019; to God and are shown the reward which has been stored up for them. Cf. Midrash Rabbah, Gen. LXII, 2 (Sonc. ed., p. 549).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn678">(8) Ex. XXXIII, 23. This verse also suggests that at the hour of death God &#x2018;takes away His hand&#x2019; and reveals their reward to the righteous.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn679">(9) Ezek. II, 10, E.V., <italic>written within and without</italic>. The scroll which was spread before the prophet apparently contained the doctrine of retribution; cf. &#x2018;Erub. 21a (Sonc. ed., p. 147).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn680">(10) <italic>ibid.</italic>, E.V., <italic>lamentations, and moaning, and woe</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn681">(11) In the parallel passage in &#x2018;Erub. <italic>loc. cit.</italic>, as well as in Rashi&#x2019;s commentary on the verse of Ezek., <italic>lamentations</italic> refers to the sufferings of the righteous on earth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn682">(12) <italic>ibid.</italic> XXXII, 16, E.V., <italic>lamentation wherewith they shall lament &#x2026; shall lament therewith</italic>. This verse proves that the term <italic>&#x1E33;inah</italic>, the singular of <italic>&#x1E33;inim</italic>, signifies a dirge of misery and suffering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn683">(13) Ps. XCII, 4, E.V., <italic>with a solemn sound</italic>. The words <italic>hegeh</italic> and <italic>higgayon</italic> are related in meaning, suggesting melodious song.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn684">(14) Ezek. VII, 26. The words <span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05D9;</span> and <span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05D5;&#x05D4;</span> are here brought together, each signifying &#x2018;sorrow, woe&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn685">(15) viz. of Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Zakkai.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn686">(16) Who will accompany him into the next world. Rabban Jo&#x1E25;anan, like king Hezekiah, had acted zealously for the spread of Torah-study and the observance of the commandments; cf. Sanh. 94b (Sonc. ed., p. 637).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn687">(17) Because he is able to put his affairs in order with calmness and deliberation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn688">(18) He will enter immediately into rest.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn689">(19) He dies with his sins unexpiated.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn690">(20) So according to a variant reading and the parallel passage in Sanh. 68a (Sonc. ed., p. 461). V. reads: &#x2018;he was sleeping in his room&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn691">(21) Which are not worn on the Sabbath.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn692">(22) To light the Sabbath lamp after the Sabbath had begun constitutes a profanation of the holy day involving the death penalty.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn693">(23) Wearing the <italic>tefillin</italic> on the Sabbath is comparable to the wearing of an adornment, which is forbidden only by Rabbinic law.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn694">(24) R. Eliezer had been placed under the ban of excommunication (cf. B.M. 59b, Sonc. ed., p. 353) and all intercourse with him by his colleagues was carried out at a distance of four cubits.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn695">(25) On the questions and the ritualistic principles involved, cf. above XIX, 4 (p. 108, n. 6).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn696">(26) On account of the ban imposed upon him, the scholars had not sought his instruction.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn697">(27) A symptom, as well as a type, of leprosy; cf. Lev. XIII.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn698">(28) The text is evidently faulty and the translation follows the emendation of GRA which accords with the parallel passage in Sanh. 68a (Sonc. ed., p. 462). V is lit., &#x2018;I withheld not of all that my eyes desired only to the extent of a man dipping his finger in the sea, and I no more lost of my learning than a paint-stick removes paint from a tube&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn699">(29) Ex. XXII, 17.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn700">(30) The reference to the planting and uprooting of cucumbers has a magical connotation; cf. Sanh. <italic>loc. cit.</italic> V adds in brackets, &#x2018;and how they are uprooted&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn701">(31) Since the shoe is still on the last, it could be regarded as unfinished, and consequently should not contract defilement.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn702">(32) Which was formed around the bier.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn703">(33) 2 Kings II, 12.</ftnote>

<p label="1.">R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: A fence<sup><xref rid="fn711">1</xref></sup> to honour is [the avoidance of] jesting,<sup><xref rid="fn712">2</xref></sup> a fence to wisdom is silence, a fence to vows is self-restraint,<sup><xref rid="fn713">3</xref></sup> a fence to purity is holiness, a fence to humility is the fear of sin.</p>
<p label="2.">He used to say: Come not among scoffers lest you learn of their ways. Eat not bread with a priest who is an <italic>&#x2018;am ha-&#x2019;are&#x1E93;</italic> lest you trespass in hallowed things. Be not free with vows lest you trespass in oaths.<sup><xref rid="fn714">4</xref></sup> Be not in the habit of feasting sumptuously lest in the end you will have to eat the bread of charity.<sup><xref rid="fn715">5</xref></sup> Bring not yourself to a state of doubt lest you come up against a certain [transgression]. Do not leave the land [of Israel] lest you serve idols; for so David said, <italic>For they have driven me out this day that I should not cleave unto the inheritance of the Lord, saying; Go, serve other gods</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn716">6</xref></sup> Can it, however, enter your mind that king David would serve idols? But this is what David meant: Whosoever leaves the land of Israel and goes abroad, Scripture regards him as an idolater.</p>
<p>He used to say: Whoever is buried in other lands is considered as though he were buried in Babylon;<sup><xref rid="fn717">7</xref></sup> whoever is buried in Babylon is as though he were buried in the land of Israel; whoever is buried in the land of Israel is as though he were buried beneath the altar, because all the land of Israel is fit [to be the site of] the altar; and whoever is buried beneath the altar<sup><xref rid="fn718">8</xref></sup> is as though he were buried beneath the Throne of Glory; as it is stated, <italic>The throne of glory, on high from the beginning, is the place of our sanctuary</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn719">9</xref></sup></p>
<p label="3."><small>HE USED TO SAY: AN IGNORANT MAN CANNOT BE PIOUS, THE BASHFUL MAN CANNOT LEARN, AND THE IMPATIENT MAN CANNOT TEACH</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn720">10</xref></sup> He used to say: Why do disciples of the Sages [often] die young? It is not because they are immoral or because they rob; but because they interrupt their study of the Torah to indulge in idle talk. Moreover, [when returning to their studies] they do not begin where they left off.</p>
<p label="4.">R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: The Israelites who live outside the land of Israel serve idols in all innocence.<sup><xref rid="fn721">11</xref></sup> How is this? For example, a Gentile prepares a banquet for his son and invites all the Jews of his town to it; although they eat and drink [of their own], and their own attendant waits on them and serves them with drink, Scripture accounts it to them as though they had eaten of the sacrifices of the dead; as it is stated, <italic>And they call thee and thou eat of their sacrifice</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn722">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. E<small>LIEZER OF</small> M<small>ODIN SAID: IF A MAN PROFANES THE SABBATHS</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn723">13</xref></sup> <small>SLIGHTS THE FESTIVALS, MAKES VOID THE COVENANT IN THE FLESH</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn724">14</xref></sup> <small>OR MISINTERPRETS THE TORAH, EVEN THOUGH HE POSSESSES TORAH AND GOOD DEEDS, HE HAS NO SHARE IN THE WORLD TO COME</small>.</p>
<p>R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: Whoever marries a wife who is unsuited to him transgresses five commandments, namely: <italic>Thou shalt not take vengeance;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn725">15</xref></sup> <italic>Thou shalt not bear a grudge;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn726">16</xref></sup> <italic>Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn727">17</xref></sup> <italic>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn728">18</xref></sup> and <italic>That thy brother may live with thee</italic><sup><xref rid="fn729">19</xref></sup>&#x2014;because since he hates her, he wishes her dead, and, in consequence, he abstains from fulfilling the duty to be fruitful and multiply in the world.<sup><xref rid="fn730">20</xref></sup></p>
<p label="5.">He used to say: If a man eats food which is unsuitable for his constitution,<sup><xref rid="fn731">21</xref></sup> he transgresses three commandments: he disgraces himself, he disgraces his food, and he recites a benediction to no purpose.<sup><xref rid="fn732">22</xref></sup></p>
<p label="6.">R. Judah b. Ilai said: If a man died and left a son, and that son, who had learnt no Torah from his father, now seeks to learn Torah from others, he is obviously insincere in his quest.<sup><xref rid="fn733">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Eleazar ha-&#x1E32;appar said: Be not like the top lintel of a doorway which is out of reach of a man&#x2019;s hand, nor like the top of the door-frame which can injure the face, nor like the middle of the door-frame which can hurt the legs; but be like the threshold below upon which all tread, and when the entire building is demolished it remains in its place.<sup><xref rid="fn734">24</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn711">(1) The &#x2018;fence&#x2019; is here taken in the sense of a safeguard or an aid to. With this paragraph, cf. Aboth III, 17.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn712">(2) That this is the true meaning of the saying is proved by the wording in Schechter&#x2019;s second version of ARN XXXIII (beg.), &#x2018;a fence to honour is not to jest&#x2019;. Cf. Finkelstein&#x2019;s translation of this maxim in his <italic>Akiba: Scholar, Saint and Martyr</italic>, p. 111, &#x2018;Laughter protects one&#x2019;s honour&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn713">(3) By practising abstinence the making of vows becomes unnecessary.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn716">(6) 1 Sam. XXVI, 19.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn717">(7) Death being an expiation, when a person dies and is interred, he is brought one degree closer to the Divine Presence which manifests its greatest concentration and brilliance in the Throne of Glory which is directly above the altar in Jerusalem. The degrees in ascending scale which lead to the Divine Glory are: other lands, Babylon, the land of Israel, Jerusalem (this is omitted in the text), the altar, and the Throne of Glory. Cf. Kel. I, 6ff (Sonc. ed., pp. 10ff).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn718">(8) This is a strange statement. GRA substitutes &#x2018;in Jerusalem&#x2019; for &#x2018;beneath the altar&#x2019;. Cf. Keth. 111a (Sonc. ed., p. 714).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn732">(22) lit. &#x2018;that is not in accordance with the regulation&#x2019;. Since the food is harmful to health, no blessing is to be recited, and one who does so pronounces the name of God in vain.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER XXVII</title>
<p label="1.">R. J<small>OSE SAID: HE WHO HONOURS THE TORAH IS HIMSELF HONOURED BY MANKIND</small>, as it is stated, <italic>For them that honour Me I will honour, and they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn735">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation<sup><xref rid="fn736">2</xref></sup> of <italic>For them that honour Me I will honour:</italic> this refers to Pharaoh king of Egypt who paid honour to Him Who spoke and the world came into being by going out at the head of his council of ministers. His servants said to him, &#x2018;Usually kings go out behind their ministers, but you go out at their head&#x0021;&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;Am I going out to meet a [28<italic>a</italic>] king of flesh and blood? No, I go to meet the Presence of the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He&#x2019;. Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, paid Pharaoh honour, and He Himself meted out retribution to him, as it is stated, <italic>I have compared thee, O my love, to a steed in Pharaoh&#x2019;s chariots</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn737">3</xref></sup></p>
<p label="2.">R. Pappias said: The congregation of Israel praised the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, as it is stated, <italic>Thou hast trodden the sea with Thy horses</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn738">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Joshua b. &#x1E32;or&#x1E25;ah said: When Pharaoh came to the Red Sea he was riding on a stallion, and the Holy One, blessed be He, appeared to him on a mare,<sup><xref rid="fn739">5</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>To a steed in Pharaoh&#x2019;s chariots</italic>. But did He not ride upon a cherub, as it is stated, <italic>And He rode upon a cherub, and did fly; yea, He did swoop down upon the wings of the wind?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn740">6</xref></sup> The cherub appeared to the steeds of Pharaoh in the form of a mare, and they followed her into the sea.</p>
<p><italic>And they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed:</italic> this refers to Sennacherib who behaved contemptuously before Him Who spoke and the world came into being, as it is stated, <italic>By thy servants hast thou taunted the Lord, and hast said: With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I have cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice cypress-trees thereof; and I have entered into his farthest height, the forest of his fruitful field. I have digged and drunk water, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of Egypt</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn741">7</xref></sup> Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, meted out punishment to him by an angel who shaved his head and beard,<sup><xref rid="fn742">8</xref></sup> so that he returned shamefacedly to his land.<sup><xref rid="fn743">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. I<small>SHMAEL THE SON OF</small> R. J<small>O&#x1E24;ANAN B.</small> B<small>EROKA SAID: HE WHO LEARNS IN ORDER TO TEACH</small>, etc.<sup><xref rid="fn744">10</xref></sup> He used to say: It is not incumbent upon you to undertake to finish the whole of the Torah, yet you are not free to keep aloof from it.<sup><xref rid="fn745">11</xref></sup> But he who greatly amasses [knowledge of the Torah] accumulates abundant reward.</p>
<p>R. E<small>LEAZAR B.</small> &#x1E24;<small>ISMA SAID: THE LAWS CONCERNING BIRD-OFFERINGS AND THE PURIFICATION OF WOMEN ARE THE ESSENTIAL ORDINANCES</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn746">12</xref></sup> R. Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Nuri said: The <italic>halakoth</italic>, the laws of ritual purity and of menstrual women and bird-offerings are the essentials of the Torah. He used to say: The arranging of the table<sup><xref rid="fn747">13</xref></sup> and the establishment of a <italic>Beth Din</italic><sup><xref rid="fn748">14</xref></sup> as well as its upkeep bring welfare to the world.</p>
<p label="3.">R. Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Dehabai said: If a man says, &#x2018;This law is not acceptable&#x2019;,<sup><xref rid="fn749">15</xref></sup> he has no share in the world to come. He used to say: Keep not aloof from a pursuit which is limitless or from a task which is endless.<sup><xref rid="fn750">16</xref></sup> [This may be illustrated by] a parable. To what is the matter like? To a man who was [hired] to carry away the waters from the sea and pour them out on the dry land. The sea did not grow less nor was the dry land filled up; so the man became dispirited. Whereupon people said to him, &#x2018;You fool&#x0021; why are you dispirited? Continue to draw your pay of one golden <italic>dinar</italic> daily&#x2019;.</p>
<p label="4.">R. E<small>LIEZER B.</small> S<small>HAMMUA&#x2018; SAID: LET THE HONOUR OF YOUR DISCIPLE BE AS DEAR TO YOU AS YOUR OWN, AND THE HONOUR OF YOUR COLLEAGUE AS THE REVERENCE FOR YOUR TEACHER, AND THE REVERENCE FOR YOUR TEACHER AS THE REVERENCE OF HEAVEN</small>. Whence do we know that the honour of a disciple should be as dear as one&#x2019;s own honour?<sup><xref rid="fn751">17</xref></sup> All may derive it from Moses our teacher who said to Joshua, <italic>Choose for us men</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn752">18</xref></sup> It is not stated, &#x2018;Choose for me&#x2019; but <italic>Choose for us</italic>, proving that he regarded Joshua as an equal, although he was the master and Joshua his disciple.</p>
<p>Whence do we know that the honour of a colleague should be as dear as [the reverence for] one&#x2019;s teacher? As it is stated, <italic>And Aaron said unto Moses: Oh my lord</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn753">19</xref></sup> But was not Moses his younger brother? Yet he acknowledged Moses as his master.<sup><xref rid="fn754">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>And whence do we know that the reverence<sup><xref rid="fn755">21</xref></sup> for a teacher should be as dear to one as the reverence of Heaven? As it is stated, <italic>And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses from his youth up, answered and said: My lord Moses, shut them in</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn756">22</xref></sup> He then considered his teacher&#x2019;s honour as equal to that of the Divine.<sup><xref rid="fn757">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>For<sup><xref rid="fn758">24</xref></sup> at first they said, &#x2018;Corn [is plentiful] in Judah, straw in Galilee, and chaff beyond the Jordan&#x2019;. Later, however, they said, &#x2018;In Judah there is no corn [only straw], in Galilee there is no straw but only chaff, and beyond the Jordan there is neither the one nor the other&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn759">25</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn735">(1) 1 Sam. II, 30. &#x2018;Me&#x2019; is here identified with the Torah, a doctrine frequent in the Zohar and other mystical literature.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn736">(2) Omitted in V, but inserted by GRA.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn737">(3) Cant. I, 9. This verse in no wise proves the point that God Himself inflicted punishment upon Pharaoh. GRA substitutes for this verse Hab. III, 15, quoted in the preceding paragraph. This latter verse suggests that God set forth on His horses in order to requite Pharaoh; cf. Sanh. 94b (Sonc. ed., p. 634).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn738">(4) Hab. <italic>ibid.</italic> This verse too offers no proof for R. Pappias&#x2019; statement, and it has been suggested that Cant. I, 9 should be read here as indicating the high esteem in which Pharaoh&#x2019;s steeds were held, since God likens His love for Israel to a highly prized mare among Pharaoh&#x2019;s chariots. The text of the passage is evidently in disorder and Schechter gives it up as hopeless. [Bacher, <italic>Ag. d. Tannaiten</italic> I, p. 319, n. 3, thinks that the appropriate quotation is Hab. III, 8.]</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn750">(16) i.e. the study of the Torah. This is an exposition of R. &#x1E6C;arfon&#x2019;s dictum in Aboth II, 21 (Sonc. ed., II, 16, p. 24). The author may well be R. &#x1E6C;arfon himself.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn757">(23) Joshua regarded disobedience to his teacher Moses as disobedience to the Divine command.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn758">(24) This word is deleted by GRA as the passage has no connection with what has gone before; but cf. the commentary of B.Y.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn759">(25) The passage describes in metaphor the state of learning which prevailed in Judah and the provinces, and proceeds to contrast the attainments of the early generations with the later, showing how the standard had deteriorated in the course of the years. Cf. &#x2018;Erub. 53a (Sonc. ed., pp. 370ff). Schechter considers this passage out of place here and suggests its transference to XXVIII, 2.</ftnote>

If a man transgressed a negative command and repented, the repentance suspends [the punishment] and the Day of Atonement effects atonement; and concerning him it states, <italic>For on this day shall atonement be made for you</italic>. If a man transgressed a prohibition punishable by <italic>kareth</italic> or by death at the hands of the court and repented, the repentance and the Day of Atonement together suspend [the punishment] and sufferings in the course of the year will purge the sin;<sup><xref rid="fn794">21</xref></sup> and concerning him it states, <italic>Then will I visit their transgression with the rod</italic>. But if a man profaned the Name of Heaven<sup><xref rid="fn795">22</xref></sup> [and repented], there is no power in the repentance to suspend [punishment], or in sufferings to purge the sin, or in the Day of Atonement to effect atonement; but repentance [with the Day of Atonement and]<sup><xref rid="fn796">23</xref></sup> with sufferings together suspend [the punishment], and death purges the sin; and concerning him it states, <italic>Surely this iniquity shall not be expiated by you till ye die</italic>.</p>

<ftnote id="fn808">(6) If his doubt referred to an inadvertent misappropriation of Temple property (cf. Lev. V, 15f).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn809">(7) This is the minimum price of a ram for a guilt-offering (Lev. <italic>ibid.</italic>) Consequently the cost of the sacrifice in the case where a man sinned in error is less than that of the sacrifice where a man was in doubt whether he had sinned in error; in the former the cost is one <italic>sela</italic>, in the latter two <italic>selas</italic>.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER XXXI</title>
<p label="1."><sup><xref rid="fn827">1</xref></sup>R. A&#x1E25;ai b. Josiah said: He who buys grain in the market,<sup><xref rid="fn828">2</xref></sup> to what may he be compared? To a child whose mother has died; though it is taken around to the homes of nursing mothers, it is not satisfied. And he who buys bread in the market, to what may he be compared? To a man who digs his own grave.<sup><xref rid="fn829">3</xref></sup> But he who eats of his own produce is like a child reared at his mother&#x2019;s breast.</p>
<p>He used to say: When a man eats of his own labour his mind is at ease. Even when he is dependent upon his father or mother or children, his mind is not at ease; and needless to say when he is dependent upon strangers.</p>
<p label="2."><small>BY TEN SAYINGS WAS THE WORLD CREATED</small>. What need is there for mankind to [know] this? It is to teach that if a person performs one precept, or keeps one Sabbath, or saves one life, Scripture imputes it to him as though he had saved a whole world which was created by ten sayings.<sup><xref rid="fn830">4</xref></sup> And if a person commits one sin, or profanes one Sabbath, or destroys one life, Scripture imputes it to him as though he had destroyed a whole world which was created by ten sayings. We find it so with Cain who slew his brother Abel; as it is stated, <italic>The voice of thy brother&#x2019;s bloods crieth unto Me</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn831">5</xref></sup> He shed the blood of one person, yet Scripture speaks of many bloods&#x0021; But it teaches you that the blood of his sons, of his sons&#x2019; sons and of his descendants to the end of all generations that were destined to issue from him, all stood and cried to the Holy One, blessed be He. Hence you learn that one man is equal in worth to the entire creation.<sup><xref rid="fn832">6</xref></sup></p>
<p label="3.">R. Nehemiah said: Whence do we know that one man is equal in worth to the entire creation? For it is stated, <italic>This is the book of the generations of Adam</italic>. [<italic>In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made He him</italic>];<sup><xref rid="fn833">7</xref></sup> and elsewhere it states, <italic>These are the generations of the heaven and of the earth when they were created</italic>, [<italic>in the day that the Lord God made earth and heaven</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn834">8</xref></sup> As in the one verse [which describes the creation of the world] the terms <italic>created</italic> and <italic>made</italic> are used, so in the other verse [which describes the creation of man] the terms <italic>created</italic> and <italic>made</italic> are used. This teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, showed Adam all the future generations that were to issue from him standing and sporting, as it were, before him. Some say that He showed him only the righteous [of every generation], as it is stated, <italic>Every one that is written unto life in Jerusalem</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn835">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Joshua b. &#x1E32;or&#x1E25;a said: It states, <italic>Thine eyes did see mine unformed substance, and in Thy book they were all written</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn836">10</xref></sup> This teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, showed Adam, the first man, every generation and its teachers, every generation and its administrators, every generation and its leaders, every generation and its prophets, every generation and its heroes, every generation and its transgressors, every generation and its pious men, and that in a certain generation such a king will arise and in a certain generation such a Sage will live.</p>
<p>R. Eliezer the son of R. Jose the Galilean said: Nine hundred and seventy-four generations before the creation of the world the Torah was already written<sup><xref rid="fn837">11</xref></sup> and lay in the bosom of the Holy One, blessed be He, singing praises together with the ministering angels; as it is stated, <italic>Then I was by Him as a nursling; and I was daily all delight</italic>, [<italic>playing always before Him</italic>,] <italic>playing in His habitable earth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn838">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>[R. Jose the Galilean said: All that the Holy One, blessed be He, created in the world, He also created in man.<sup><xref rid="fn839">13</xref></sup>] This may be illustrated by a parable. To what can it be compared? To a man who takes a piece of wood intending to engrave many designs on it; but as he has insufficient space for his designs, he is dejected. He, however, who draws his designs on the ground can do so interminably, and keep everything distinct and apart. On the other hand,<sup><xref rid="fn840">14</xref></sup> the Holy One, blessed be He,&#x2014;may His great name be blessed for ever and to all eternity&#x2014;in His wisdom and understanding created the whole world: He created the heaven and the earth, the celestial beings and terrestrial creatures. He likewise fashioned in man all that He had created in His world: He created forests in the world and forests in man, viz. his hairs; He created wild beasts in the world and wild beasts in man, viz. the intestinal worms;<sup><xref rid="fn841">15</xref></sup> He created destructive agents<sup><xref rid="fn842">16</xref></sup> in the world and destructive agents in man, these [act via] the ears of man;<sup><xref rid="fn843">17</xref></sup> He created odours<sup><xref rid="fn844">18</xref></sup> in the world and odours in man, these are [sensed by] the nose of man; He created a sun in the world and a sun in man, viz. the light of [the countenance of] man;<sup><xref rid="fn845">19</xref></sup> fetid water in the world and also in man, viz. his nasal discharge; salt water in the world and also in man, viz. his tears; streams in the world and also in man, viz. the secretions;<sup><xref rid="fn846">20</xref></sup> ramparts<sup><xref rid="fn847">21</xref></sup> in the world [29<italic>b</italic>] and also in man, viz. his lips;<sup><xref rid="fn848">22</xref></sup> doors in the world and also in man, viz. his teeth; vaults in the world and also a vault in man, viz. his tongue;<sup><xref rid="fn849">23</xref></sup> sweet water in the world and also in man, viz. his sputum; contours<sup><xref rid="fn850">24</xref></sup> in the world and also in man, viz. his jaws; towers in the world and a tower in man, viz. his neck;<sup><xref rid="fn851">25</xref></sup> riggings<sup><xref rid="fn852">26</xref></sup> in the world and also in man, viz. his arms; pegs in the world and also in man, viz. his fingers; a king in the world and also in man, viz. his head; [wine-bearing] clusters in the world and also in man, viz. his blood;<sup><xref rid="fn853">27</xref></sup> counsellors in the world and also in man, viz. his kidneys;<sup><xref rid="fn854">28</xref></sup> grinding mills in the world and also in man, viz. his stomach; crushing mills in the world and also in man, viz. his spleen; refuse bins in the world and also in man, viz. the belly; pits in the world and also in man, viz the navel;<sup><xref rid="fn855">29</xref></sup> running waters in the world and also in man, viz. the urine; life in the world and also in man, viz. his blood; trees in the world and also in man, viz. the bones; hills in the world and also in man, viz. the hips; a pestle and mortar in the world and also in man, viz. his knees;<sup><xref rid="fn856">30</xref></sup> horses in the world and also in man, viz. his shanks;<sup><xref rid="fn857">31</xref></sup> the angel of death in the world and also in man, viz. his heels;<sup><xref rid="fn858">32</xref></sup> hills and valleys in the world and also in man, for erect he is like a hill, fallen he is like a valley. Hence you learn that all that the Holy One, blessed be He, created in His world He also created in man.</p>
<ftnote id="fn827">(1) This paragraph has no connection with the theme of this chapter, which is an extensive commentary on Aboth V. Such commentary begins with &#x00A7;2. Accordingly it has been suggested that this paragraph should be joined to the previous chapter. This arrangement has been adopted by Schechter.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn830">(4) The importance of the world is enhanced by the fact that God, in view of His omnipotence, took so much trouble with its creation, for instead of a single fiat He resorted to ten utterances to perfect the world.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn831">(5) Gen. IV, 10, E.V., <italic>brother&#x2019;s blood</italic>. The Heb. noun is plural.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn835">(9) Is. IV, 3. The verse refers to the righteous, God&#x2019;s elect, whose names are inscribed in the &#x2018;Book of Life&#x2019;, which is identical with <italic>the book of the generations of Adam</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn836">(10) Ps. CXXXIX, 16. <italic>Thy book</italic> is interpreted as <italic>the book of the generations</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn837">(11) The Divine plan, as intimated <italic>ibid.</italic> CV, 8: <italic>The word</italic> (i.e. the Torah) <italic>which He commanded to a thousand generations</italic>, was that a thousand generations were to pass before the giving of the Torah to man. Since, in fact, Moses received the Torah and he lived in the twenty-sixth generation from the creation, it follows that the Torah must have been in existence for nine hundred and seventy-four generations before the creation. Cf. &#x1E24;ag. 13b, 14a (Sonc. ed., p. 82, n. 7).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn838">(12) Prov. VIII, 30f.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn839">(13) This sentence is omitted in V. It is found in the Oxford MS. of this work [cf. Bacher, <italic>Ag. d. Tannaiten</italic>, I, p. 365, n. 1] and serves as a fine introduction to the parable and the extensive paragraph which follow.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn840">(14) So according to Schechter&#x2019;s text which has MS. authority. V reads &#x2018;so too&#x2019;. The contrast in the thought is this: whereas man requires the whole surface of the earth to draw his designs, God formed within the confined space of his body everything which He had created in the world. This is the concept of the &#x2018;microcosm&#x2019;: that man is regarded as an epitome of the universe, a world in miniature.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn841">(15) The text varies between &#x2018;the intestines of man&#x2019; and &#x2018;the worms in man&#x2019;. Both readings apparently refer to the same thing, the intestinal worms.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn842">(16) Heb. <italic>&#x1E33;or&#x1E93;in</italic>, a difficult word with doubtful meaning. According to Jastrow &#x2018;destructive insects&#x2019;, but he emends the end of the line to &#x2018;intestines&#x2019; in place of &#x2018;ears&#x2019;. Bacher, R.E.J. XXXVII, pp. 301f, compares this word with the Aramaic expression in Dan. III, 8: <italic>wa&#x2019;akalu &#x1E33;ar&#x1E93;ehon</italic>, &#x2018;and they brought accusations&#x2019; and translates here &#x2018;accusers&#x2019;, &#x2018;slanderers&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn843">(17) Which are the receptacles of slanderous and malicious talk.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn845">(19) Another reading is &#x2018;his forehead&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn846">(20) lit. &#x2018;tears&#x2019;; but as tears have just been mentioned with the qualification &#x2018;of the eyes&#x2019;, the word might mean &#x2018;secretions&#x2019;. GRA reads &#x2018;the urine&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn847">(21) Another reading is &#x2018;seals&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn848">(22) Cf. &#x2018;Arak. 15b (Sonc. ed., p. 87) where it is stated that the tongue is surrounded by two walls, one of bone (the teeth) and one of flesh (the lips), to guard it from speaking evil.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn849">(23) Or, the palate, which is the vault of the mouth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn850">(24) lit. &#x2018;jaws&#x2019;. GRA reads &#x2018;stars&#x2019;; cf. Shab. 151b (Sonc. ed., p. 774) where the stars represent man&#x2019;s cheeks.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn851">(25) Cf. Cant. VII, 5 where the neck is likened to <italic>a tower of ivory</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn852">(26) The word is unique in Heb. literature and the meaning is a matter of conjecture. Jastrow&#x2019;s translation is adopted here. [Krauss, <italic>Lehnw&#x00F6;rter</italic>, p. 413, suggests a connection with <span dir="rtl">&#x05E1;&#x05E8;&#x05D3;&#x05D9;&#x05D5;&#x05D8;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;</span>, &#x2018;officers&#x2019;, which is also found in the commentary <italic>Tummath Yesharim</italic>.]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn853">(27) The red juice of the grape is designated &#x2018;blood&#x2019; in Deut. XXXII, 14. In the MSS. &#x2018;his breasts&#x2019; is read in place of &#x2018;his blood&#x2019;; for this cf. Cant. VII, 8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn854">(28) For this and the following two comparisons, cf. Ber. 61a, b (Sonc. ed., p. 384): &#x2018;the kidneys prompt [thought]&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn855">(29) Which forms a slight depression on the body.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn856">(30) These articulate in ball and socket fashion, i.e. like a pestle and mortar.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER XXXII</title>
<p label="1."><small>THERE WERE TEN GENERATIONS FROM</small> A<small>DAM TO</small> N<small>OAH</small>. What need is there for mankind to [know] this? It is to teach you that although those generations provoked Him continually, the Holy One, blessed be He, did not bring the waters of the flood upon them on account of the righteous and pious who were among them. Some say that as long as Methuselah was alive the flood did not descend upon the earth; and even when Methuselah died the flood was yet suspended for them for seven days after his death, as it is stated, <italic>And it came to pass after the seven days</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn859">1</xref></sup> What special feature was there about those seven days? They were the days of mourning for that righteous man which stayed the retribution; therefore it is stated, <italic>And it came to pass after the seven days</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn860">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation of <italic>And it came to pass after the seven days:</italic> it teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, granted them this further respite after the original period of one hundred and twenty years, in which time they might repent;<sup><xref rid="fn861">3</xref></sup> but they did not do so, therefore it is stated, <italic>And it came to pass after the seven days</italic>.</p>
<p>Another interpretation is: the words teach that the Holy One, blessed be He, reversed for them the order of the universe, the sun rising in the west and setting in the east, perchance they would notice it, be awestruck and repent; but they did not do so, therefore it is stated, <italic>And it came to pass after the seven days</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn862">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another interpretation: The words teach that the Holy One, blessed be He, spread His table before them and showed them His bounty of the kind to be enjoyed in the world to come, so that they might scrutinize themselves and say, &#x2018;Woe to us for all this good which we shall have lost&#x0021;&#x2019; But they corrupted their way upon the earth,<sup><xref rid="fn863">5</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt;</italic> [<italic>for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn864">6</xref></sup></p>
<p label="2.">R. Eleazar b. Par&#x1E6D;a said: It is written, <italic>My spirit shall not judge man for ever</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn865">7</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, said, &#x2018;I shall not judge them until I shall have first doubled their reward&#x2019;,<sup><xref rid="fn866">8</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>They spend their days in prosperity, and peacefully they go down to the grave</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn867">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Jose the Galilean said: Scripture states, <italic>Shall not judge</italic>. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, &#x2018;I shall not regard the evil impulse as equal to the good impulse&#x2019;. When is this so? Before the decree has been sealed; but once the decree has been sealed, both impulses bear equal responsibility for sin.<sup><xref rid="fn868">10</xref></sup></p>
<p label="3.">He used to say: From the righteous the evil impulse is removed<sup><xref rid="fn869">11</xref></sup> and they are left with<sup><xref rid="fn870">12</xref></sup> the good impulse only, as it is stated, <italic>My heart is slain within me</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn871">13</xref></sup> From the wicked the good impulse is removed and they are left with the evil impulse only, as it is stated, <italic>Transgression speaketh to the wicked, methinks&#x2014;there is no fear of God before his eyes</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn872">14</xref></sup> Average people are left with both impulses: he who draws near to the evil impulse is swayed by it, and he who draws near to the good impulse is swayed by it, as it is stated, <italic>Because He standeth at the right hand of the needy, to save him from them that judge his soul</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn873">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: Scripture states, <italic>Shall not judge</italic>. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, &#x2018;I will not judge them until I have rewarded the righteous&#x2019;. This is so only in this world;<sup><xref rid="fn874">16</xref></sup> but as for the world to come Scripture declares, <italic>His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his dust</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn875">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: Scripture states, <italic>My spirit shall not judge man for ever</italic>. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, &#x2018;They did not scrutinize themselves as mortals,<sup><xref rid="fn876">18</xref></sup> but displayed an arrogant spirit towards the Most High&#x2019;, [as it is stated,] <italic>Yet they said unto God: Depart from us</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn877">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Meir said: Scripture states, <italic>Shall not judge</italic>. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, &#x2018;That generation declared, &#x201C;The Lord shall not judge&#x201D; [meaning,] there is no Judge in the world; the All-present has abandoned the world&#x2019;.</p>
<p>Rabbi [Judah the Prince] said: Scripture states, <italic>Shall not judge</italic>. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, &#x2018;They do not set up courts of justice on earth, so I will set up<sup><xref rid="fn878">20</xref></sup> against them courts of justice on high&#x2019;.</p>
<ftnote id="fn859">(1) Gen. VII, 10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn860">(2) Cf. Sanh. 108b (Sonc. ed., p. 744).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn861">(3) The verse in Gen. VI, 3, <italic>Therefore shall his days be a hundred and twenty years</italic>, is interpreted by the Rabbis as a period of warning which God granted to that generation in which to repent. When this ended, He allowed them a further seven days&#x2019; grace.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn862">(4) The words <italic>the seven days</italic> recall the days of the creation and suggest that God interfered with the order of nature, as laid down at the creation, in the hope that mankind would be awestruck at the phenomenon and repent.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn863">(5) The text is in disorder and the translation follows Schechter&#x2019;s text which gives the MS. reading. V reads &#x2018;and [woe to us] for having destroyed our seed from the earth&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn864">(6) <italic>ibid.</italic> VI, 12.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn865">(7) <italic>ibid.</italic> 3. The verb <italic>yadon</italic>, translated in the Versions as &#x2018;abide&#x2019; or &#x2018;contend&#x2019;, is here given the meaning &#x2018;judge&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn866">(8) This is in agreement with the Rabbinic doctrine (cf. &#x1E32;id. 40b, Sonc. ed., p. 202) that God bestows prosperity upon the wicked in this world, paying them a double reward for the few good deeds to their credit in this world (cf. B.B. 15b, Sonc. ed., p. 75), in order to deny them the world to come.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn867">(9) Job XXI, 13. Their reward is thus double: they live in prosperity and die in tranquillity without suffering; cf. Sanh. 108a (Sonc. ed., p. 739) where the verse is explained as referring to the generation of the flood.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn868">(10) The intention of this passage is obscure. Perhaps the meaning is: because the evil impulse enters man at birth (Gen. VIII, 21) and the nature of man is prone to fall under its sway (<italic>ibid.</italic> VI, 5), God will not judge it on the same footing as the good impulse, but make allowance for human frailty. Once man has been sentenced at the seat of judgment, both impulses are on equal footing as regards responsibility for sin. Cf. the somewhat similar statement by the same author in Midrash Rabbah, Genesis, XXVI, &#x00A7;6 (Sonc. ed., pp. 216f).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn869">(11) lit. &#x2018;he takes away from them&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn870">(12) lit. &#x2018;and he gives them&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn871">(13) Ps. CIX, 22, E.V., <italic>is wounded. By heart</italic> is meant the desires of the heart, i.e. the evil impulse. [According to Bacher, <italic>Ag. d. Tannaiten</italic>, I, p. 361, n. 3, the interpretation is based on the use of <italic>leb</italic> for <italic>heart</italic> instead of <italic>lebab</italic> both here and in the next quotation. The latter is explained by the Rabbis as the two impulses while the former denotes only one of them.]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn872">(14) <italic>ibid.</italic> XXXVI, 2. <italic>Transgression speaketh</italic> is interpreted as &#x2018;the evil impulse prompts&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn873">(15) <italic>ibid.</italic> CIX, 31. The <italic>needy</italic> are the average persons who are lacking in good deeds. <italic>Them that judge his soul</italic> are the two impulses in man which control him. On the passage, cf. Ber. 61b (Sonc. ed., p. 385).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn874">(16) The punishment of the wicked will be the more poignant when they see the bliss of the righteous. This, however, can only happen in this world and not in the world to come, because the generation of the flood will not stand in the judgment in the world to come; cf. Sanh. 107b (Sonc. ed., p. 737).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn875">(17) <italic>ibid.</italic> CXLVI, 4. Consequently the wicked will not see anything of the reward granted to the righteous in the hereafter.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn876">(18) According to this interpretation the subject of <italic>yadon</italic>, here understood as &#x2018;they did not judge themselves&#x2019; is the generation of the flood.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn877">(19) Job XXI, 14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn878">(20) There is a variant, &#x2018;I, too, will not set up&#x2019;; i.e. I will punish them without recourse to judicial procedure.</ftnote>

It is to teach that all those generations were provoking Him, and there was not one man who would walk in the ways of the Holy One, blessed be He, until Abraham our father came and walked in His ways; as it is stated, <italic>Because that Abraham hearkened to My voice</italic>, [<italic>and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws</italic>.]<sup><xref rid="fn879">1</xref></sup> The verse does not say &#x2018;law&#x2019; but <italic>laws</italic>. But whence did he learn them?<sup><xref rid="fn880">2</xref></sup> It teaches you that the Holy One, blessed be He, provided Abraham with two reins which, like two Sages, instructed him, counselled him, and taught him wisdom all the night long, as it is stated, <italic>I will bless the Lord who hath given me counsel; yea, in the night seasons my reins instruct me</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn881">3</xref></sup> Moreover, our father Abraham was wont to practise righteousness first and justice afterwards, as it is stated, <italic>For I have known him, to the end that he might command</italic> [<italic>his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of the Lord, to do righteousness and justice</italic>].<sup><xref rid="fn882">4</xref></sup> Whenever two disputants came before our father Abraham with a lawsuit, the one claiming a <italic>mina</italic> from the other, he would take out a <italic>mina</italic>, give it to the defendant, and say to him, &#x2018;Argue your case before me&#x2019;. After their case had been argued, if [he found that] one was in debt to the other, he would say to the defendant in whose hand was the <italic>mina</italic>, &#x2018;Pay the <italic>mina</italic> to your companion&#x2019;; but if [the claim was] not [proved], he would say to them, &#x2018;Divide it between you and depart in peace&#x2019;. King David, on the other hand, did not act so; he was wont to do justice first and righteousness afterwards, as it is stated, <italic>And David executed justice and righteousness unto all his people</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn883">5</xref></sup> When disputants came before king David with a lawsuit, one claiming a <italic>mina</italic> from the other, he said to them, &#x2018;Argue your case&#x2019;. After their case had been argued, if [he found that] one owed a <italic>mina</italic> to the other, he would take out a <italic>mina</italic> of his own and give it to the claimant; but if [the claim was] not [proved] he would say to them, &#x2018;Depart in peace&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn884">6</xref></sup></p>
<p label="2."><small>WITH TEN TRIALS WAS</small> A<small>BRAHAM OUR FATHER TRIED BY THE</small> H<small>OLY</small> O<small>NE</small>, <small>BLESSED BE</small> H<small>E, AND HE WAS FOUND STEADFAST IN THEM ALL</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn885">7</xref></sup> They are: twice when he had to leave his home,<sup><xref rid="fn886">8</xref></sup> twice with his two sons,<sup><xref rid="fn887">9</xref></sup> twice with his two wives,<sup><xref rid="fn888">10</xref></sup> once [when he fought] against the kings,<sup><xref rid="fn889">11</xref></sup> once at the Covenant between the Pieces,<sup><xref rid="fn890">12</xref></sup> once in Ur of the Chaldees<sup><xref rid="fn891">13</xref></sup> and once at the Covenant of Circumcision.<sup><xref rid="fn892">14</xref></sup> [30<italic>a</italic>] Why [was he subjected to these trials]? So that when our father Abraham will come to claim his reward, the angels<sup><xref rid="fn893">15</xref></sup> will say, &#x2018;Far more than all of us is our father Abraham worthy of claiming his reward&#x2019;; as it is stated, <italic>Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn894">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Corresponding to the ten trials with which our father Abraham was tried, in all of which he was found steadfast, the Holy One, blessed be He, performed ten miracles for his children in Egypt.<sup><xref rid="fn895">17</xref></sup> On account of them He brought ten plagues [upon the Egyptians]; so, too, on account of them ten miracles were wrought for Israel at the Red Sea;<sup><xref rid="fn896">18</xref></sup> and also on account of them He brought ten plagues upon the Egyptians at the Red Sea.<sup><xref rid="fn897">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Egyptians thundered against Israel with their voices; so did the Holy One, blessed be He, thunder against them with His voice at the Red Sea, as it is stated, <italic>God thundereth marvellously with His voice</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn898">20</xref></sup> The Egyptians advanced towards the Red Sea with bow and arrow; and the Holy One, blessed be He, likewise revealed Himself to them with bow and arrow, as it is stated, <italic>Thy bow is made quite bare</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn899">21</xref></sup> and it is also stated, <italic>And He sent His arrows, and scattered them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn900">22</xref></sup> The Egyptians advanced towards the Red Sea with swords; and the Holy One, blessed be He, also came against them with swords and spears, as it is stated, <italic>And He sent out His arrows, and scattered them; and He shot forth lightnings and discomfited them</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn901">23</xref></sup> &#x2018;lightning&#x2019; indicates nothing else than the sword, as it is stated, <italic>A sword, a sword, it is sharpened, and also furbished; it is sharpened that it may make a sure slaughter, it is furbished that it may be as lightning</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn902">24</xref></sup> The Egyptians gloried in shield and buckler; and the Holy One, blessed be He, did likewise, as it is stated, <italic>Take hold of shield and buckler, and rise up to my help</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn903">25</xref></sup> The Egyptians advanced with spears; so, too, did the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is stated, <italic>At the shining of Thy glittering spear</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn904">26</xref></sup> The Egyptians advanced with stones and slings; and the Holy One, blessed be He, triumphed over them with great hailstones, as it is stated, <italic>At the brightness before Him, there passed through His black clouds, hailstones and coals of fire</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn905">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the time when our ancestors stood at the Red Sea, Moses said to them, &#x2018;Rise up and cross&#x2019;; but they replied, &#x2018;We will not cross until the Sea appears to us as yawning holes&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn906">28</xref></sup> Moses took his staff and struck the Sea so that it became like yawning holes, as it is stated, <italic>Thou hast stricken through with his own rods the head of his rulers</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn907">29</xref></sup> Moses said to them, &#x2018;Rise up and cross&#x2019;; but they replied, &#x2018;We will not cross until the Sea will become before us like a valley&#x2019;. Moses struck the Sea and it became before them as a valley, as it is stated, <italic>He cleaved the sea and caused them to pass through;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn908">30</xref></sup> and it is also stated, <italic>As the cattle that go down into the valley</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn909">31</xref></sup> Moses said to them, &#x2018;Rise up and cross&#x2019;; but they replied, &#x2018;We will not cross until it will be divided before us into parts&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn910">32</xref></sup> [Moses struck the Sea so that it was divided into parts,] as it is stated, <italic>To Him who divided the Red Sea into parts</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn911">33</xref></sup> Moses said to them, &#x2018;Rise up and cross&#x2019;; but they replied, &#x2018;We will not cross until it will become for us like clay&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn912">34</xref></sup> Moses took his staff and struck the Sea so that it became for them like clay, as it is stated, <italic>Thou hast trodden the sea with Thy horses, the clay of the mighty waters</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn913">35</xref></sup> Moses said to them, &#x2018;Rise up and cross&#x2019;; but they replied, &#x2018;We will not cross until it will become for us as a wilderness&#x2019;. Moses took up his staff and struck the Sea [and it became for them as a wilderness], as it is stated, <italic>And He led them through the depths, as through a wilderness</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn914">36</xref></sup> Moses said to them, &#x2018;Rise up and cross&#x2019;; but they replied, &#x2018;We will not cross until it will crumble into pieces before us.&#x2019; Moses took his staff and struck the Sea [so that it crumbled into pieces], as it is stated, <italic>Thou didst break the sea in pieces by Thy strength</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn915">37</xref></sup> Moses said to them, &#x2018;Rise up and cross&#x2019;; but they replied, &#x2018;We will not cross until it will turn into rocks for us&#x2019;. Moses took his staff and struck the Sea [and it turned into rocks], as it is stated, <italic>Thou didst shatter the heads of the sea-monsters on the waters</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn916">38</xref></sup> and you must say that the heads of sea-monsters can only be shattered on rocks. Moses said to them, &#x2018;Rise up and cross&#x2019;; but they replied, &#x2018;We will not cross until it will become dry land for us&#x2019;. Moses took his staff and struck the Sea [and it became dry land], as it is stated, <italic>He turned the sea into dry land</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn917">39</xref></sup> and it further states, <italic>But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn918">40</xref></sup> Moses said to them, &#x2018;Rise up and cross&#x2019;; but they replied, &#x2018;We will not cross until it will stand up before us like walls&#x2019;. Moses took his staff and struck the Sea [so that it stood up like walls], as it is stated, <italic>And the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn919">41</xref></sup> Moses said to them, &#x2018;Rise up and cross&#x2019;; but they replied, &#x2018;We will not cross until it will stand up for us [as in] bottles&#x2019;. Moses took his staff and struck the Sea [so that it stood up as in bottles], as it is stated, <italic>The floods stood upright as in bottles</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn920">42</xref></sup> And whence do we know that from between the several divisions a fire came forth which licked them up?<sup><xref rid="fn921">43</xref></sup> For it is stated, <italic>As when fire kindleth melting waters, and the fire causeth the waters to boil; to make Thy name known to Thine adversaries</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn922">44</xref></sup> The bottles produced a flow of oil and honey into the mouths of the infants from which they drew nourishment, as it is stated, <italic>And He made him to suck honey out of the crag</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn923">45</xref></sup> Some say that fresh water issued for them from the Sea which they drank when they were in the sea-lanes, because sea-water is salty, as it is stated, <italic>the floods</italic> [<italic>nozelim</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn924">46</xref></sup> and by <italic>nozelim</italic> sweet water is meant, as it is stated, <italic>A well of living waters, and flowing streams</italic> [<italic>nozelim</italic>] <italic>from Lebanon</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn925">47</xref></sup> Above them were clouds of glory that the sun should not overpower them, and so Israel passed through that they might suffer no discomfort. R. Eliezer said: He arched the deep over them like a vault, and Israel passed through that they should suffer no discomfort. R. Eliezer and R. Simeon said: The upper and lower waters [combined] to overthrow the Egyptians, as it is stated, <italic>And the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn926">48</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn879">(1) Gen. XXVI, 5.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn884">(6) In V the text reads, as with Abraham, &#x2018;Divide it between you and depart in peace&#x2019;. This is an obvious error, because where the case was not proved, king David made no gift of money. Consequently the words &#x2018;divide it between you&#x2019; are incorrectly interpolated.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn885">(7) The version in Aboth V, 4 (Sonc. ed., V, 3, p. 59) is &#x2018;and he stood firm in them all&#x2019;.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn891">(13) According to a tradition, Abraham had been thrown by Nimrod into a fiery furnace because of his belief in God, from which he came forth unharmed. The name <italic>Ur</italic> means &#x2018;fire&#x2019; in Heb.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn892">(14) Cf. <italic>ibid.</italic> XVII, 10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn893">(15) GRA reads &#x2018;all will say&#x2019;. There is a variant &#x2018;the nations of the world will say&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn894">(16) Eccl. IX, 7. Midrash Rabbah, Ecclesiastes, <italic>ad loc.</italic>, applies the verse to Abraham when, after his many trials, he was steadfast in his faith.</ftnote>

<p label="1."><small>WITH TEN TRIALS DID THE</small> H<small>OLY</small> O<small>NE, BLESSED BE</small> H<small>E, TEST OUR FATHERS</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn927">1</xref></sup> and in all of them they were not found perfect. They are: <italic>In the wilderness, in the Arabah, over against Suph, between Paran and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Di-zahab</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn928">2</xref></sup> <italic>In the wilderness:</italic> where they made the golden calf, as it is stated, <italic>They have made them a molten calf</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn929">3</xref></sup> <italic>In the Arabah:</italic> [where they murmured] for water, as it is stated, <italic>And the people thirsted there for water</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn930">4</xref></sup> <italic>Over against Suph:</italic> because they rebelled at the Red Sea.<sup><xref rid="fn931">5</xref></sup> Some say that it refers to Micah&#x2019;s graven image.<sup><xref rid="fn932">6</xref></sup> R. Judah said: They rebelled at the Sea and also while in the Sea, as it is stated, <italic>They were rebellious at the sea, even in the Red Sea</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn933">7</xref></sup> <italic>Between Paran</italic>: in the episode of the spies, as it is stated, <italic>And Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn934">8</xref></sup> <italic>And Tophel:</italic> this refers to the disparaging remarks which they made regarding the manna.<sup><xref rid="fn935">9</xref></sup> <italic>And Laban:</italic> this refers to Korah&#x2019;s revolt.<sup><xref rid="fn936">10</xref></sup> <italic>And Hazeroth:</italic> in the matter of the quails.<sup><xref rid="fn937">11</xref></sup> Here are seven [trials], and elsewhere it states, <italic>And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn938">12</xref></sup> [thus making ten]. <italic>And Di-zahab;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn939">13</xref></sup> Aaron<sup><xref rid="fn940">14</xref></sup> said to them, &#x2018;Sufficient unto you is this sin of the gold which you provided for the calf&#x2019;. R. Eliezer b. Jacob said: This sin [of the golden calf] is sufficient [in gravity] for Israel to suffer on its account from now until the resurrection.<sup><xref rid="fn941">15</xref></sup></p>
<p label="2.">By ten terms of praise is the Holy One, blessed be He, designated: viz. the Name beginning with <italic>alef-daleth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn942">16</xref></sup> <italic>YHVH</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn943">17</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2019;Elohim</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn944">18</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2019;Eloah</italic>, <italic>&#x2019;Eloheka</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn945">19</xref></sup>, <italic>&#x2019;Elohekem</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn946">20</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2019;El</italic>, <italic>&#x2019;Ehyeh &#x2019;asher &#x2019;eheyeh</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn947">21</xref></sup> <italic>Shaddai</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn948">22</xref></sup> and <italic>&#x1E92;eba&#x2019;oth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn949">23</xref></sup> R.

<p label="3.">By ten terms of opprobium are idols designated: viz. detestable things, abominations, molten images, graven images, things of naught, <italic>&#x2019;asherim</italic>, sun-pillars, carved figures, wickedness, and <italic>teraphim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn951">25</xref></sup></p>
<p label="4.">Two distinguishing marks are inserted in the Torah at a short section.<sup><xref rid="fn952">26</xref></sup> Which is that short section? The verses, <italic>And it came to pass, when the ark was set forward, that Moses said</italic> &#x2026; [<italic>And when it rested, he said</italic>, etc.].<sup><xref rid="fn953">27</xref></sup> Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel said: It would have been appropriate for this section to have been taken from its place here and written elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="fn954">28</xref></sup> [30<italic>b</italic>]</p>
<p>Similarly [a peculiarity occurs in the verse], <italic>And Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn955">29</xref></sup> But was he the son of Manasseh? Surely he was the [grand]son of Moses&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn956">30</xref></sup> But since his deeds were unlike those of his [grand]father Moses, his descent is traced to Manasseh.<sup><xref rid="fn957">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Similarly we find in the verse, <italic>These are the two anointed ones that stand by the Lord of the whole earth:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn958">32</xref></sup> these are Aaron and the Messiah.<sup><xref rid="fn959">33</xref></sup> I know not which of the two is the more beloved; when, however, Scripture states, <italic>The Lord hath sworn and will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever</italic> [<italic>after the manner of Melchizedek</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn960">34</xref></sup> I know that king Messiah is more beloved than the righteous priest.<sup><xref rid="fn961">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scripture states, <italic>The boar out of the</italic> wood <italic>doth ravage it</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn962">36</xref></sup> although as written [the Hebrew means], <italic>The boar of the</italic> river <italic>doth ravage it. The boar of the</italic> wood <italic>doth ravage it</italic>&#x2014;because when Israel do not perform the will of the All-present, the heathen nations are like a boar of the wood to them: as the boar of the wood kills persons, attacks beasts<sup><xref rid="fn963">37</xref></sup> and injures human beings, so when Israel do not perform the will of the All-present, the heathen nations kill, attack and injure them. But when Israel perform the will of the All-present, the heathen nations have no power over them [and are harmless] like the boar of the river: as the boar of the river neither kills persons nor injures human beings, so when Israel perform His will no nation or tongue can kill, attack or injure them.

<p label="5.">In ten places in the Torah [certain words or letters] have dots over them:<sup><xref rid="fn964">38</xref></sup> viz.

<ftnote id="fn928">(2) Deut. I, 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn929">(3) Ex. XXXII, 8. This verse, however, does not mention &#x2018;the wilderness&#x2019;. Cf. Pseudo-Jonathan on Num. XXIV, 1: &#x2018;And he (Balaam) set his face toward the wilderness, in order to call to mind against them the golden calf which they had made there&#x2019;. In Schechter&#x2019;s ed. Ps. CVI, 19 is quoted here: <italic>They made a calf in Horeb</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn930">(4) Ex. XVII, 3. This occurred at Rephidim, which might be described as &#x2018;Arabah&#x2019;, i.e. a desert, a waterless region.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn931">(5) Which is called in Heb. <italic>Yam Suf</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn932">(6) Micah was an Ephraimite who had set up a private idolatrous shrine (cf. Judg. XVII). He had made his graven image while yet in Egypt, and took it with him when Israel crossed the Red Sea. Cf. Sanh. 103b (Sonc. ed., p. 704) where the verse from Zech. X, 11, <italic>And there passed through the Sea a rival</italic> (E.V., <italic>and over the sea affliction shall pass</italic>) is interpreted as a reference to Micah&#x2019;s idol.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn936">(10) Cf. Num. XVI. It is difficult to see how <italic>Laban</italic>, meaning &#x2018;white&#x2019;, can allude to Korah&#x2019;s revolt. The commentators suggest that the allusion is based on the Midrash (Tan&#x1E25;uma, Num. XVI, 1) where it is related that Korah was prompted to question the authority of Moses by a specious argument about the law of <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic> which provides for &#x2018;white&#x2019; threads as well as a blue one.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn950">(24) Deut. XX, 9. Here the word has a secular meaning.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn951">(25) All these terms are of frequent occurrence in the Bible. For &#x2018;wickedness&#x2019; a reading &#x2018;Baalim&#x2019; has been suggested.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn952">(26) The marks are in the form of an inverted <italic>nun</italic>, one being placed at the beginning and the other at the end of the section. They serve to put the section in parentheses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn953">(27) Num. X, 35f.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn954">(28) Cf. Shab. 116a (Sonc. ed., p. 568).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn957">(31) lit. &#x2018;they suspend him with Manasseh&#x2019;. He was one of the most wicked kings of Judah (cf. 2 Kings XXI, 1-17). Out of respect for Moses, Scripture associates the idolatrous priest Jonathan with the wicked Manasseh. Cf. B.B. 109b (Sonc. ed., p. 453).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn958">(32) Zech. IV, 14. The allusion is to Joshua the High Priest and to Zerubbabel of the royal line of David.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn959">(33) Representing the priesthood and monarchy. This passage is inserted here in contrast to the preceding exposition: as the wicked are traced back to the wicked, so the righteous are traced back to, or named after, the righteous. Accordingly, Joshua the High Priest, is here designated &#x2018;Aaron&#x2019; and the leader Zerubbabel &#x2018;king Messiah&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn960">(34) Ps. CX, 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn961">(35) The first element in the name Melchizedek signifies &#x2018;king&#x2019;. The verse therefore implies that the priest is <italic>after the manner of</italic> the king, i.e. he ranks second to the king, thus proving that king Messiah has precedence over the High Priest.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn962">(36) <italic>ibid.</italic> LXXX, 14.

Blau, <italic>Masoretische Untersuchungen</italic>. Among the many theories put forward in explanation of these dots two may be mentioned: (<italic>i</italic>) they were intended to call attention to important homiletical teachings which the early Rabbis had connected with the dotted words; (<italic>ii</italic>) they indicate that the words or letters are doubtful and are to be deleted. Cf. J.E., VIII, p. 368.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn965">(39) Gen. XVI, 5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn966">(40) Sarah reproached Abraham because he did not check Hagar&#x2019;s haughtiness towards her.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn969">(43) Since they were angels they had knowledge of her whereabouts; but they asked a rhetorical question out of courtesy and in order to endear her to her husband.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn970">(44) <italic>ibid.</italic> XIX, 33. In M.T. it is the last word of this verse which has the dot; the reference might be to <italic>ibid.</italic> 35.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn971">(45) The text is in disorder and various corrections have been proposed. The reading adopted is that of MS. E, <span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05D4;</span> for <span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05DC;&#x05D0;</span>. The exposition seems to be this: the word <span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05D1;&#x05E7;&#x05D5;&#x05DE;&#x05D4;</span> in verse 33, which speaks of the elder daughter, has a dot over it suggesting the deletion of the word. Accordingly Lot did know she rose up, in contrast with the younger daughter, of whose rising he was unaware.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn980">(54) <italic>ibid.</italic> XXI, 30.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn981">(55) The two sentences are in contradiction. Hence the insertion of &#x2018;Others say that&#x2019; (cf. B.Y.). The text has &#x2018;idolaters&#x2019; for &#x2018;peoples&#x2019; which is the reading of GRA and others.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn982">(56) <italic>ibid.</italic> XXIX, 15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn983">(57) For all occasions the tenth-measure had to be used, even when it was necessary to measure three-tenths as for the meal-offering for a bullock; cf. Men. 87b (Sonc. ed., p. 529).</ftnote>

<p label="2.">[The<sup><xref rid="fn1036">2</xref></sup> houses of] Jerusalem cannot become defiled by leprosy.<sup><xref rid="fn1037">3</xref></sup> [Jerusalem] cannot be condemned as an apostate city.<sup><xref rid="fn1038">4</xref></sup> No juttings, balconies or gutters in it were allowed to overhang the public thoroughfare lest they form a tent for defilement by a corpse.<sup><xref rid="fn1039">5</xref></sup> No dead bodies were kept in it overnight,<sup><xref rid="fn1040">6</xref></sup> and no human bones were carried through it. A resident alien was not permitted to settle in it. No graves were allowed to remain within it, except the tombs of the House of David and of the prophetess Huldah, which existed there since the days of the early prophets. And why, when they cleared the city of graves, did they not remove these tombs? It is said that there was an underground cave there through which the uncleanness passed out to the brook Kidron.<sup><xref rid="fn1041">7</xref></sup> No plants were planted in it;<sup><xref rid="fn1042">8</xref></sup> no gardens or orchards were laid out in it, except the rose-gardens which existed there from the days of the early prophets. No geese or fowl were reared in it,<sup><xref rid="fn1043">9</xref></sup> and needless to say no pigs;<sup><xref rid="fn1044">10</xref></sup> no dunghills were allowed to remain in it on account of uncleanness. No &#x2018;stubborn and rebellious son&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1045">11</xref></sup> could be condemned in it, according to the view of R. Nathan, for it is stated, <italic>Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1046">12</xref></sup> and Jerusalem is neither <italic>his city</italic> nor <italic>his place</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1047">13</xref></sup> No houses could be sold there [together with the ground on which they stood], but only the structure above the ground; and no house sold in it became irredeemable after twelve months.<sup><xref rid="fn1048">14</xref></sup> No payment was allowed to be taken there as rent, but a charge could be made for the hire of bed and bedding.<sup><xref rid="fn1049">15</xref></sup> R. Judah said: It was not even allowed to make a charge for bed and bedding. What did they<sup><xref rid="fn1050">16</xref></sup> do with the skins of the sacrifices?<sup><xref rid="fn1051">17</xref></sup> They gave them to the proprietors of the guest-houses. Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel said: Visitors were accommodated within the house while the owners lived outside; visitors therefore acted shrewdly and used to bring as offerings Egyptian lambs<sup><xref rid="fn1052">18</xref></sup> whose skins were worth four or five <italic>selas</italic> each which they gave to the owners of guest-houses in Jerusalem, and in this way the house-owners profited.</p>
<p label="3.">One verse of Scripture states, [<italic>The place which the Lord shall choose</italic>] <italic>in one of thy tribes;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1053">19</xref></sup> and another verse states, [<italic>The place which the Lord your God shall choose</italic>] <italic>out of all your tribes</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1054">20</xref></sup> <italic>In one of thy tribes</italic> refers to [a place in] the tribes of Judah and Benjamin;<sup><xref rid="fn1055">21</xref></sup> <italic>out of all your tribes</italic> refers to Jerusalem, in which all Israel have a share. What was in the portion of Judah? The Temple mount, the priestly chambers and the courts. And what was in the portion of Benjamin? The Sanctuary, the porch and the Holy of Holies. A wedge<sup><xref rid="fn1056">22</xref></sup> of land projected [from Judah&#x2019;s portion], entered [Benjamin&#x2019;s portion], and then fell back again [into Judah&#x2019;s portion], and on this the altar was built. Thus Benjamin was deemed worthy to become the host of the Almighty, as it is stated, <italic>And He dwelleth between his shoulders</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1057">23</xref></sup></p>
<p label="4.">Joshua<sup><xref rid="fn1058">24</xref></sup> said, &#x2018;As soon as I know that the Temple will be situated in the region between Judah and Benjamin, I will go and set aside the fertile region around Jericho [as compensation]&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn1059">25</xref></sup> And who enjoyed its produce all the intervening years? The children of the Kenite, Moses&#x2019; father-in-law, as it is stated, <italic>And the children of the Kenite, Moses</italic>&#x2019; <italic>father-in-law, went up out of the city of palm-trees</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1060">26</xref></sup> They<sup><xref rid="fn1061">27</xref></sup> said that when the Holy One, blessed be He, will again reveal His Presence, He will pay a goodly reward to Jethro and his sons. And whence did Jethro&#x2019;s descendants maintain themselves [in the meantime]?<sup><xref rid="fn1062">28</xref></sup> From their pottery works,<sup><xref rid="fn1063">29</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>And the families of scribes that dwelt at Jabez;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1064">30</xref></sup> and it also states, <italic>These were the potters, and those that dwelt among plantations</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1065">31</xref></sup> etc. For they were great men, possessed of houses, fields and vineyards, but for the sake of the work of the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, they abandoned everything and departed, and <italic>there they dwelt occupied in the king&#x2019;s work</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1066">32</xref></sup> Where did they go? To Jabez<sup><xref rid="fn1067">33</xref></sup> to study Torah with him, and so they became the All-present&#x2019;s people. For Jabez was a good and worthy man, true and pious, who sat and expounded the Torah, as it is stated, <italic>And Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying: Oh that Thou wouldest bless me indeed &#x2026; And God granted him that which he requested</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1068">34</xref></sup></p>
<p label="5."><small>TEN MIRACLES WERE WROUGHT FOR OUR FATHERS IN THE TEMPLE: NO FLY WAS EVER SEEN IN THE TEMPLE SLAUGHTER-HOUSE. NO UNCLEAN ACCIDENT EVER BEFELL THE HIGH PRIEST ON THE DAY OF ATONEMENT</small>. There was an exception in the case of R. Ishmael b. &#x1E32;im&#x1E25;ith who went out [on the Day of Atonement] to converse with a certain prince and some saliva dropped from the latter&#x2019;s mouth and fell upon his garments, [thereby rendering him unclean]; so his brother entered and officiated as High Priest in his stead. Their mother accordingly saw her two sons [officiating as] High Priests on that day. On seeing her the Sages asked her, &#x2018;What merit had you?&#x2019; She replied, &#x2018;Never did the beams of my house see the hair of my head&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn1069">35</xref></sup> No man<sup><xref rid="fn1070">36</xref></sup> was ever injured in the Temple, and no man ever stumbled there. <small>NO WOMAN EVER MISCARRIED THROUGH THE SMELL OF THE HALLOWED FLESH</small>. Never did the priests render a sacrifice disqualified. Whenever the priests ate too much of the hallowed flesh they used [31<italic>b</italic>] to drink the waters of Siloam, whereby the food was assimilated within them as in the normal process of digestion. 6. <small>NO DISQUALIFYING DEFECT WAS EVER FOUND IN THE</small> &#x2018;<small>OMER</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn1071">37</xref></sup> <small>OR IN THE TWO LOAVES</small>,<sup><xref rid="fn1072">38</xref></sup> <small>OR IN THE SHEWBREAD</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1073">39</xref></sup></p>
<p label="7.">Whenever an earthenware vessel was broken, the fragments were swallowed up in the place [where they lay].<sup><xref rid="fn1074">40</xref></sup> <small>THE WIND NEVER PREVAILED OVER THE PILLAR OF SMOKE</small> [which ascended from the altar]. When the pillar of smoke ascended from the altar of the burnt-offering it rose up straight as a stick until it reached the sky; and when the column of incense went forth from the golden altar, it proceeded in a direct line towards the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p label="8."><small>THE PEOPLE STOOD CLOSELY PRESSED TOGETHER YET FOUND AMPLE SPACE TO PROSTRATE THEMSELVES</small>. When Israel went up to prostrate themselves before their Father in heaven, although they sat so closely pressed together that none could insert a finger between them, yet when they prostrated themselves they found ample space to do so. The greatest miracle of all was that even when a hundred people were bowing all at the same time, the superintendent of the assembly never found it necessary to call out, &#x2018;Make room for your brethren&#x2019;. Miracles were wrought also in the Temple court; for even if all Israel entered there, the Temple court accommodated them all. The greatest miracle of all was that when Israel stood in prayer so closely pressed together that none could insert a finger between them, yet when they prostrated themselves there was the space of a man&#x2019;s height between them.<sup><xref rid="fn1075">41</xref></sup></p>
<p label="9.">Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel said: Jerusalem is destined that all the nations and all the kingdoms will be gathered together in her midst, as it is stated, <italic>And all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the Lord</italic>, [<italic>to Jerusalem</italic>],<sup><xref rid="fn1076">42</xref></sup> and elsewhere it declares, <italic>Let the waters be gathered together</italic>;<sup><xref rid="fn1077">43</xref></sup> as the &#x2018;gathering together&#x2019; of the latter verse means that all the waters of creation are to be brought into one place, so the &#x2018;gathering together&#x2019; of the former verse means that all the nations and kingdoms will be assembled in her midst, as it is stated, <italic>And all the nations shall be gathered unto it</italic>.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1035">(1) The current editions read &#x2018;in the Temple&#x2019;. This is an error, because the list of miracles wrought in the Temple is given later in the chapter, &#x00A7;5, and the name &#x2018;Jerusalem&#x2019; is specified in the last eight items. It would seem that the first two were common to the Temple and Jerusalem. Cf. Aboth V, 8 (Sonc. ed., V, 5, pp. 61f). Furthermore, in the current editions the first two items are followed by, &#x2018;Ten miracles were wrought for our fathers in Jerusalem&#x2019;. It is suggested that these words were a marginal correction for the opening line of the chapter, intended to replace it, but by mistake it was inserted in the text in addition to the opening line. Cf. Schechter&#x2019;s note in his ed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1036">(2) Here is enumerated a list of special regulations which applied to Jerusalem. Cf. B.&#x1E32;. 82b (Sonc. ed., pp. 468f) and Maimonides, Yad, <italic>Beth Habbe&#x1E25;irah</italic>, VII, 14.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1039">(5) Cf. Num. XIX, 14.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1040">(6) The dead were buried the same day and not kept overnight.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1041">(7) There was accordingly no danger of the defilement being spread.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1042">(8) The reason was the same as for the regulation forbidding all overhanging projections; here, too, the branches of the trees would form a &#x2018;tent&#x2019; over a corpse and thereby spread the defilement.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1043">(9) These birds spread defilement by carrying reptiles in their beaks.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1060">(26) Judg. I, 16. <italic>The city of palm-trees</italic> is the fertile land at Jericho; cf. Deut. XXXIV, 3. Jethro&#x2019;s descendants enjoyed this region for four hundred and forty years, i.e. from the entry into Canaan until the building of the Temple.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1061">(27) i.e. the Sages.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1062">(28) From the time they gave up possession of that region until the realization of their promised reward.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1069">(35) It being improper, especially for a married woman, to expose her hair; cf. Yoma 47a (Sonc. ed., p. 223, n. 4). In the Talmudic version he conversed with an Arab, not with a prince.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1070">(36) V inserts &#x2018;No man was ever attacked in Jerusalem&#x2019;. It is out of place in this paragraph which deals with the miracles in the Temple, and is omitted in the MSS.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1078">(1) The eschatological doctrines assumed here are that some time in the future, after the Messianic era, the dead will come to life again. This will be followed by the Day of Judgment, and all who will be acquitted will then enjoy the world to come. It would seem that all, the wicked as well as the righteous, will be resurrected, with the exception only of the very wicked who, as enumerated here, will not come back to life and consequently will not stand in judgment. For a comprehensive study of this subject, cf. the chapters on &#x2018;The Hereafter&#x2019; in G. F. Moore, <italic>Judaism</italic>, II, Part VII and A.

<ftnote id="fn1100">(23) This passage, enclosed in brackets, is undoubtedly out of place and should be inserted at the conclusion of the view of R. Jose the Galilean. It is against his argument that this objection is raised.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1109">(32) Here follows logically the objection against the argument, viz. the bracketed passage above. Many verses are adduced which contain the word <italic>there</italic> and allude to the righteous.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1110">(33) Jer. II, 2. The generation of the wilderness are here praised for their loyalty to God, and the prophet declares that this act of faith will stand future generations in good stead so that they will be worthy of a place in the world to come. And if descendants will enter the world to come in their merit, surely they themselves will enter&#x0021; Cf. Sanh. 110b (Sonc. ed., pp. 758f).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1116">(39) This statement of Rabban Gamaliel is, according to the commentators, out of place here. It would seem that he is expressing a favourable view with regard to the future of the generation of the wilderness. In the first verse he notes that the days of the parents and the days of the children are equated, and he argues therefrom that since the days of the children are prolonged, because they did not sin in the wilderness, and will merit life in the hereafter, so the parents&#x2019; days will also be prolonged and they too will be deemed worthy of the hereafter on account of their children. The second verse adds force to his view that the children&#x2019;s virtue will stand in good stead for the parents.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1117">(40) Rabban Gamaliel and R. Joshua both hold a favourable view for the generation of the wilderness, while R. Eliezer is supported by R. Jose the Galilean in denying them life in the world to come.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1118">(41) If they do not conduct their affairs with the utmost caution and sincerity.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1119">(42) A writer of sacred texts such as Torah scrolls, and for <italic>Tefillin</italic> and <italic>Mezuzoth</italic>. Cf. &#x2018;Erub. 13a (Sonc. ed., p. 81) where the scribe is admonished to be meticulous in his work lest by the addition or omission of one letter he destroy the world by writing blasphemous matter.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1120">(43) A writer of deeds and documents who can do untold harm by careless writing, and even by forging documents. Some translate <italic>sofer</italic> as &#x2018;a teacher of young children&#x2019;, and refer to Mishnah &#x1E32;id. 82a (Sonc. ed., pp. 421f).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1121">(44) A doctor who considers himself the &#x2018;best&#x2019;, and refuses in his conceit to consult others could be responsible for the patient&#x2019;s death; or one who is at the height of his profession and refuses to attend poor patients. Cf. &#x1E32;id. <italic>loc. cit.</italic> (Sonc. ed., p. 423, n. 9).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1122">(45) One who sits alone as judge. This is strongly condemned by the Rabbis; cf. Aboth IV, 10 (Sonc. ed., IV, 8, p. 48). Such a man is too sure of himself and lacks the qualities essential in a judge: humility and responsibility. Some interpret the term as referring to judges in general; for their condemnation, cf. Shab. 139a (Sonc. ed., p. 700).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1123">(46) He misleads people by his prognostications. A variant, adopted by GRA, is &#x2018;a shopkeeper&#x2019;. His trade is described in &#x1E32;id. <italic>loc. cit.</italic> as the trade of robbers, because he frequently resorts to fraudulent practices.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1124">(47) Either the officer of the court who carries out its sentences and can inflict vindictive punishment upon the condemned, or the precentor of the Synagogue who renders the service not in a spirit of devotion but to display his vocal ability.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1125">(48) On account of monetary loss he is prepared to declare fit for consumption an animal about which there is a doubt. Cf. &#x1E32;id. <italic>loc. cit.</italic> This passage [cf. Soferim XV, 10, below p. 287] has long been a perplexing problem to scholars, and much learning has been displayed to justify the severe condemnation of the seven types. Cf. the commentaries. An ingenious interpretation of the passage has been put forward by Rabbi Moses Kunitzer in his <italic>Hamma&#x1E93;ref</italic>, Part I, pp. 74f. He suggests that the seven occupations are merely a mnemonic for the seven names of persons listed in the following paragraph (and also in Sanh. 90a, Sonc. ed., pp. 602f) who have no portion in the world to come. Much ingenuity is exercised to find the link whereby the occupation is connected with the respective name. E.g. the &#x2018;writer&#x2019; represents Ahab who, as reported in Sanh. 102b (Sonc. ed., p. 697), wrote on the gates of Samaria &#x2018;Ahab denies the God of Israel&#x2019;; the &#x2018;diviner&#x2019; represents Balaam who is described in Josh. XIII, 22 as <italic>the soothsayer</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1126">(49) Cf. Mishnah Sanh. 90a (Sonc. ed., pp. 602f).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1127">(50) 2 Chron. XXXIII, 13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1128">(51) For this and the next paragraph, cf. Sanh. 103b (Sonc. ed., p. 702).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1129">(52) i.e. he pronounces the Tetragrammaton as it is spelt. Cf. Mishnah Sanh. 90a (Sonc. ed., p. 602).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1130">(53) lit. &#x2018;he trills with his voice&#x2019;; cf. Tosiftha Sanh. XII, 5. According to Sanh. 101a (Sonc. ed., p. 684) the meaning is that he treats the verses of the Song of Songs as a secular poem. According to Rashi <italic>ad loc.</italic> he recites it not in agreement with the traditional cantillation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1131">(54) Before uttering the charm; cf. Sanh. 90a (Sonc. ed., p. 602).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1132">(55) Ex. XV, 26.</ftnote>

<p label="10.">Hillel the Elder expounded seven exegetical rules<sup><xref rid="fn1162">27</xref></sup> in the presence of the Sons of Bathyra,<sup><xref rid="fn1163">28</xref></sup> viz.<sup><xref rid="fn1164">29</xref></sup> the inference drawn from a minor premise to a major, the inference drawn from a similarity of words or phrases, [32<italic>b</italic>] a general principle established on the basis of a law contained in one verse or of laws contained in two verses, the rule when a generalization is followed in the text by a specification, and when a specification is followed in the text by a generalization, the inference drawn from an analogous passage elsewhere, the interpretation of a word or passage from its context. These are the seven rules which Hillel the Elder expounded in the presence of the Sons of Bathyra.<sup><xref rid="fn1165">30</xref></sup></p>
<p label="11."><small>SEVEN THINGS MARK THE CLOD AND SEVEN THE WISE MAN</small>. [<small>THE WISE MAN DOES NOT SPEAK BEFORE ONE WHO IS GREATER THAN HE IN WISDOM AND IN YEARS, AND DOES NOT BREAK IN UPON THE WORDS OF HIS FELLOW, AND IS NOT HASTY TO ANSWER; HE ASKS TO THE POINT AND ANSWERS ACCORDING TO THE ACCEPTED DECISION; HE SPEAKS ON THE FIRST POINT FIRST AND ON THE LAST POINT LAST;</small>] <small>AND OF WHAT HE HAS NOT HEARD A TRADITION HE SAYS, &#x2018;I HAVE NOT HEARD&#x2019;; AND HE IS NOT ASHAMED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE TRUTH. THE OPPOSITE OF THESE ARE SAID TO MARK THE CLOD</small>.</p>
<p label="12.">&#x2018;The wise man does not speak before one who is greater than he in wisdom and in years &#x2019;:<sup><xref rid="fn1166">31</xref></sup> such was Moses, as it is stated, <italic>And Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1167">32</xref></sup> Now who was the more competent to speak, Moses or Aaron? Surely Moses, since he had heard the words from the Almighty, whereas Aaron heard them from Moses. But Moses said, &#x2018;Is it proper for me to speak in the presence of my elder brother?&#x2019; He therefore requested Aaron to speak, [which he did,] as it is stated, <italic>And Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord had spoken unto Moses</italic>.</p>
<p>&#x2018;And he does not break in upon the words of his fellow&#x2019;: such was Aaron, as it is stated, <italic>And Aaron spoke unto Moses: Behold, this day have they offered their sin-offering, and their burnt-offering</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1168">33</xref></sup> etc. Aaron accordingly held his peace until Moses had finished speaking and did not say to him, &#x2018;Be brief&#x2019;. Only then did he reply to Moses, <italic>&#x2018;Behold, this day they have offered</italic>, etc., and we are mourners&#x0021;&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1169">34</xref></sup> Some say that Aaron drew Moses away from the midst of the community and said to him, &#x2018;Moses, my brother, if it is forbidden a mourner to eat of the [second-] tithe, which is of lesser holiness, how much more is it forbidden a mourner to eat of the sin-offering, which is of greater holiness&#x0021;&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1170">35</xref></sup> At once Moses admitted [that he was right], as it is stated, <italic>When Moses heard that, it was well-pleasing in his sight;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1171">36</xref></sup> and also in the sight of the Almighty.<sup><xref rid="fn1172">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>This<sup><xref rid="fn1173">38</xref></sup> also may be derived from the passage, <italic>And he</italic> [Moses] <italic>was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron that were left</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1174">39</xref></sup>&#x2014;hence it was said that when a man entertains<sup><xref rid="fn1175">40</xref></sup> his disciples he only turns his face to the greatest, but when he is angry he only turns to the least of them, as it is stated, <italic>And he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar</italic>, although in fact Aaron was also included in the indignation.</p>
<p>Aaron was older than Moses, and the Holy One, blessed be He, is greater than Aaron; why then did He not speak direct with Aaron? Because he was not one to stand in the breach, for had he been one to stand in the breach, sin would not have caused the tragedy of Nadab and Abihu.<sup><xref rid="fn1176">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>Similarly in connection with our father Abraham.<sup><xref rid="fn1177">42</xref></sup> When he was interceding on behalf of the men of Sodom, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, <italic>If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will forgive all the place for their sake</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1178">43</xref></sup> Now it was revealed and known before Him Who spake and the world came into being that had there been three or five righteous men in Sodom, sin would not have brought upon them the calamity. Nevertheless the Holy One, blessed be He, waited until Abraham finished pleading and then answered him, as it is stated, <italic>And the Lord went His way, as soon as He had left off speaking to Abraham</italic>&#x2014;if it is possible to say so, He said to him, &#x2018;I will now take My leave&#x2019;&#x2014;<italic>and Abraham returned unto his place</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1179">44</xref></sup></p>
<p label="13.">&#x2018;And he is not hasty to answer&#x2019;: such was Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, as it is stated, <italic>I said: Days should speak</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1180">45</xref></sup> This teaches that they<sup><xref rid="fn1181">46</xref></sup> sat in silence before Job; when he stood they stood; when he sat they sat; when he ate they ate; and when he drank they drank. Until finally he asked leave of them to speak, as it is stated, <italic>After this opened Job his mouth and cursed his day &#x2026; and said: Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night wherein it was said: A man-child is brought forth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1182">47</xref></sup> &#x2018;Perish the day when my father drew near to my mother and she told him that she was with child&#x0021;&#x2019; And whence do we know that they did not speak confusedly together? Because it is stated, <italic>And Job spoke and said;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1183">48</xref></sup> <italic>Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite and said;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1184">49</xref></sup> <italic>Then answered Bildad the Shuhite and said;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1185">50</xref></sup> <italic>Then answered Zophar the Naamathite and said;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1186">51</xref></sup> <italic>And Elihu the son of Barachel answered and said</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1187">52</xref></sup> Scripture places them in order, one following the other, to teach all who enter the world that a wise man does not speak before one who is greater than he in wisdom, and he does not break in upon the words of his fellow, and he is not hasty to answer.</p>
<p>&#x2018;He asks to the point&#x2019;: such was Judah, as it is stated, <italic>I will be surety for him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1188">53</xref></sup> &#x2018;He asks not to the point&#x2019;: such was Reuben, as it is stated, <italic>And Reuben spoke unto his father saying: Thou shalt slay my two sons</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1189">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x2018;He speaks on the first point first&#x2019;: such was Jacob.<sup><xref rid="fn1190">55</xref></sup> Others say: such was Sarah.<sup><xref rid="fn1191">56</xref></sup> &#x2018;And on the last point last&#x2019;: such were the men of Haran.<sup><xref rid="fn1192">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x2018;And acknowledges the truth&#x2019;: such was Moses, as it is stated, <italic>And when Moses heard that, it was well-pleasing in his sight</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1193">58</xref></sup> So also did the Holy One, blessed be He, acknowledge the truth, as it is stated, <italic>And the Lord said unto me: They have well said that which they have spoken;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1194">59</xref></sup> and it is also stated, The daughters of Zelophehad speak aright.<sup><xref rid="fn1195">60</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1135">(1) i.e. of greater importance and usefulness.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1136">(2) lit. &#x2018;He created&#x2019;, and so throughout this passage.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1137">(2a) The phrase could also be translated &#x2018;evil spirits&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1138">(3) For this and the next paragraph, cf. &#x1E24;ag. 16a (Sonc. ed., pp. 101f).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1139">(4) The commentators without exception correct the number to &#x2018;seven&#x2019; in conformity with the parallel passage in So&#x1E6D;. 22b (Sonc. ed., pp. 112f) and j.Ber. IX, 5, 14b, and therefore omit one of the types listed here. Cf. below, n. 9. This passage purports to denounce the types enumerated as being eccentric, sanctimonious and hypercritical.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1140">(5) Either the Pharisee who observes the Torah for what he can profit thereby, like Shechem (cf. Gen. XXXIV, 19) who submitted to the rite of circumcision only from an ulterior motive; or he who carries his good deeds upon his shoulder (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05DB;&#x05DD;</span>), i.e. ostentatiously.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1141">(6) He walks with exaggerated humility, scarcely lifting his feet from the ground, so that he strikes his feet against stones and stumbles. The reading here is <span dir="rtl">&#x05E0;&#x05DB;&#x05E4;&#x05D0;&#x05D9;</span>, in the parallel passages <span dir="rtl">&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05E7;&#x05E4;&#x05D9;</span>; in either case the word must be derived from the root <span dir="rtl">&#x05E0;&#x05E7;&#x05E3;</span>, &#x2018;to strike&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1142">(7) In order not to look at a woman he walks with closed eyes, so that he dashes his face against a wall and bruises himself and bleeds. The reading here, <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05E7;&#x05E6;&#x05D9;&#x05D0;&#x05D9;</span>, can only be explained by its parallel elsewhere, <span dir="rtl">&#x05E7;&#x05D9;&#x05D6;&#x05D0;&#x05D9;</span>, &#x2018;one who bleeds&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1143">(8) He who walks with bowed head like a pestle in a mortar. It is a matter of doubt whether the word <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05DB;&#x05D5;&#x05D1;&#x05D0;&#x05D9;</span> (or its variant <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D3;&#x05D5;&#x05DB;&#x05D9;&#x05D0;</span>, as in the parallel passages) means the pestle or the mortar. The translation might well be &#x2018;the mortar Pharisee&#x2019;, i.e. he who wears a large cap on his head in the form of a mortar to cover his eyes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1144">(9) lit. &#x2018;the Pharisee who has work (to do)&#x2019;. This type is omitted in the parallel passages.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1145">(10) The text makes no sense and the reading adopted is that given in the margin <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D4; &#x05D7;&#x05D5;&#x05D1;&#x05EA;&#x05D9;</span> <span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05D0;&#x05E2;&#x05E9;&#x05E0;&#x05D4;</span>, lit. &#x2018;(who exclaims) what is my duty that I may perform it?&#x2019; implying that he has already fulfilled every obligation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1146">(11) The word in the text defies interpretation and is obviously a corruption. The reading adopted is that found in the parallel passages, <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D0;&#x05D4;&#x05D1;&#x05D4;</span>, &#x2018;from love&#x2019;, and even this is explained in a derogatory sense, viz. he performs the commandments for love of the reward or to win the love of his fellows, and not from disinterested motives.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1147">(12) i.e. fear of retribution.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1148">(13) Cf. Gi&#x1E6D;. 70a (Sonc. ed., p. 334).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1149">(14) Or, &#x2018;travel&#x2019;, omitting the second word <italic>&#x2019;ere&#x1E93;</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1150">(15) Either for drinking or bathing.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1151">(16) Cf. &#x1E24;ag. 12a (Sonc. ed., p. 65) where &#x2018;ten&#x2019; things, i.e. powers, are listed; cf. Rashi <italic>ad loc.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1152">(17) The MSS. add: &#x2018;The three Patriarchs are Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; and the four Matriarchs are Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel and Leah&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1153">(18) GRA substitutes &#x2018;faithfulness&#x2019;, since for &#x2018;wisdom&#x2019; there is no proof-text adduced.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1154">(19) Hos. II, 21f. In these verses five virtues are enumerated (if &#x2018;faithfulness&#x2019; is read in place of &#x2018;wisdom&#x2019;). The remaining two virtues are inferred from Ps. LXXXV 11, <italic>Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other</italic>. This verse is added to the text by GRA.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1155">(20) Cf. &#x1E24;ag. 12b (Sonc. ed., p. 69).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1156">(21) The Heb. noun means &#x2018;mixed, seasoned&#x2019;, from <italic>tebalin</italic>, &#x2018;spices&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1157">(22) Deriving <italic>tebel</italic> from the root <italic>yabal</italic>, &#x2018;to lead, bring in&#x2019;. Everything on earth returns to the earth; cf. Eccl. III, 20. Some restrict the term <italic>tebel</italic> in its application to the land of Israel which is seasoned with every thing, and has the power to attract all. In this connection reference is made to Mishnah Keth XIII, 11 (Sonc. ed., p. 709), where it is stated: &#x2018;All may be compelled to go up to the land of Israel to dwell there, but none may be compelled to leave it.&#x2019; GRA suggests an entirely different reading, <italic>shemmableh &#x2019;eth hakkol</italic>, &#x2018;because it wears everything away&#x2019;; but there is no MS. support for this reading.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1158">(23) In virtue and righteous deeds.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1159">(24) Also in religious conduct and good deeds.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1160">(25) This last quality brings the number up to eight; it is omitted by GRA.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1161">(26) Prov. XII, 26. E.V., <italic>The righteous is guided by his friend</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1162">(27) Cf. Tosiftha Sanh. VII end.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1163">(28) A distinguished family, of Babylonian descent, at the head of the Sanhedrin in the reign of Herod, and noteworthy for their humility; cf. Pes. 66a (Sonc. ed., p. 333, n. 6) and B.M. 85a (Sonc. ed., p. 485).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1164">(29) Cf. with these rules the thirteen principles laid down by R. Ishmael; cf. Sifra, beginning, and P.B. pp. 13f.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1165">(30) This sentence is not found in the MSS. What follows is from Aboth V, 10 (Sonc. ed., V, 7, pp. 64f).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1166">(31) lit. &#x2018;and in number&#x2019;, i.e. either in number of years, or in the number of scholars who agree with the opposite view, they forming the majority.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1167">(32) Ex. IV, 30.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1168">(33) Lev. X, 19.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1169">(34) Because of the tragic death of Nadab and Abihu, Aaron&#x2019;s sons. <italic>Ibid</italic>. 2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1170">(35) Cf. Zeb. 101a (Sonc. ed., p. 486).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1171">(36) <italic>ibid.</italic> 20.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1172">(37) i.e. Aaron&#x2019;s reply pleased the Almighty.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1173">(38) This and the following paragraph are clearly misplaced.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1174">(39) <italic>ibid.</italic> 16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1175">(40) lit. &#x2018;makes a feast&#x2019;. A variant is &#x2018;teaches&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1176">(41) Adopting the reading as suggested by GRA. V has &#x2018;He had not sons able to stand in the breach; for had his sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, been able to stand in the breach, sin could not &#x2026;&#x2019; Because Aaron did not resist the people when they made the golden calf&#x2014;it being Moses who stood in the breach to avert God&#x2019;s anger and not Aaron (Ps.

<p label="1."><small>SEVEN KINDS OF PUNISHMENT COME UPON THE WORLD FOR SEVEN CARDINAL TRANSGRESSIONS. IF SOME GIVE THEIR TITHES AND OTHERS DO NOT, THERE COMES A FAMINE THROUGH DROUGHT</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1196">1</xref></sup> If some offer the heave-offering<sup><xref rid="fn1197">2</xref></sup> and others do not, there comes a famine through tumult.<sup><xref rid="fn1198">3</xref></sup> If some set apart the dough-offering<sup><xref rid="fn1199">4</xref></sup> and others do not, there comes a famine of extermination. If all resolved not to give their tithes, they thereby caused the heavens to close from sending down dew or rain, and men toil but have no sufficiency. R. Josiah said: For the sin of [withholding] the dough-offering no blessing enters into the fruit; and men toil but have no sufficiency. For the sin of [withholding] the heave-offering and the tithes, the heavens are closed from sending down dew or rain; and the people are delivered into the hand of their enemies.</p>
<p label="2.">Pestilence comes upon the world for the sin of [withholding from the poor] the gleanings,<sup><xref rid="fn1200">5</xref></sup> the forgotten sheaf,<sup><xref rid="fn1201">6</xref></sup> the corner of the field, and the poor-tithe.<sup><xref rid="fn1202">7</xref></sup> It is related that a widow lived in the vicinity of a landowner, and her two sons went into his field to glean, but he refused them permission.

The sons said, &#x2018;When can we return to our mother? Perhaps she will have with her something to eat&#x2019;. She found nothing with them and they found nothing with her to eat. They put their heads between the knees of their mother and all three died in one day. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, &#x2018;You have taken their lives; as surely as you live, I will exact your lives from you&#x2019;. For it is stated, <italic>Rob not the weak, because he is weak, neither crush the poor in the gate; for the Lord will plead their cause, and despoil of life those that despoil them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1204">9</xref></sup></p>

<p>When they seized Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel and R. Ishmael [33<italic>a</italic>] [b.

R. Ishmael b. Elisha said to him, &#x2018;May I say a word to you?&#x2019; He said, &#x2018;Speak&#x2019;; and R. Ishmael said,<sup><xref rid="fn1208">13</xref></sup> &#x2018;Perhaps when you were sitting down to a meal, poor persons came and stood at your door, and you did not allow them to enter and eat with you&#x2019;.

Then R. Ishmael said, &#x2018;Perhaps when you were sitting and expounding [the Torah] on the Temple mount, and all the multitudes of Israel were sitting before you, your mind was puffed up&#x2019;. Rabban Simeon answered, &#x2018;Ishmael, my brother, a man must be prepared to accept his fate&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn1209">14</xref></sup> They both pleaded with the executioner; one said, &#x2018;I am a priest, son of a High Priest; put me to death first so that I do not witness the death of my colleague&#x2019;. The other said, &#x2018;I am a prince, the son of a prince; put me to death first so that I do not witness the death of my colleague&#x2019;. The executioner said, &#x2018;Draw lots&#x2019;. They did so, and the lot fell upon Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel. The executioner took the sword and cut off his head. R. Ishmael b. Elisha took it up, held it to his bosom, wept and exclaimed, &#x2018;Holy mouth, faithful mouth&#x0021; Holy mouth, faithful mouth&#x0021; Mouth that gave forth beautiful gems, precious stones and pearls&#x0021; Who has buried you in the dust and filled your tongue with dust and ashes?

It signifies that they will be &#x2018;widows and not widows&#x2019;, as when there are no witnesses forthcoming [to testify to the death of their husbands] to permit them to remarry; as [happened at the destruction of] Bethar,<sup><xref rid="fn1213">18</xref></sup> where not a single person escaped [to testify to the death of any individual] to permit the wives to remarry. Similarly, from the simple meaning of the words, <italic>And your wives shall be widows</italic>, I know that the children will be orphans. It signifies that they will be &#x2018;orphans and not orphans&#x2019;; for their property will remain in the presumed ownership of their fathers, and the children will not be permitted either to inherit the property or to transact any business with it.</p>

<p>&#x2018;Because of idolatry&#x2019;, as it is stated, <italic>And I will destroy your high places</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1215">20</xref></sup> [And it is also stated, <italic>And you will I scatter among the nations</italic>.]<sup><xref rid="fn1216">21</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, said [to Israel], &#x2018;Since you take delight in idolatry, I will exile you to a place where idolatry is practised&#x2019;. Therefore it is stated, <italic>And I will destroy your high places</italic>, etc.</p>
<p>&#x2018;And because of neglect of the year of release of the land.&#x2019; Whence do we know this? For it is stated, <italic>Then shall the land be paid her sabbaths</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1217">22</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, said [to Israel], &#x2018;Since you do not give rest to the land, it will take its rest without you;<sup><xref rid="fn1218">23</xref></sup> and according to the numbers of months that you failed to give it rest, it will rest of itself&#x2019;.

<p>&#x2018;And because of immorality.&#x2019; How is this to be understood? R. Ishmael b. R.

Ishmael suggests that his sad fate might be attributed to his having delayed justice. It is on this score that the story finds its place here. The passage to be inserted reads: &#x2018;Did a woman ever come to you to ask about her monthly impurity, or a man about his vow, and they were kept waiting, because you were asleep or having a meal, or perhaps you had no free time, or perhaps the attendant would not allow them to enter?&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1209">(14) The reason suggested&#x2014;his elation and pride at the sight of men standing and listening to his teaching&#x2014;apparently accounted for his fate, and Rabban Simeon acknowledged God&#x2019;s justice.</ftnote>

<p label="1.">Five persons are not granted forgiveness:<sup><xref rid="fn1221">1</xref></sup> he who repents repeatedly, he who sins repeatedly, he who sins in a sinless generation, he who sins with the intention of repenting, and he who is guilty of profaning the Name.<sup><xref rid="fn1222">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Because of his sinfulness<sup><xref rid="fn1223">3</xref></sup> man has not the power to comprehend the Form on high;<sup><xref rid="fn1224">4</xref></sup> otherwise he would have been entrusted with the keys [of the unknown] and discover how heaven and earth had been created.</p>

<ftnote id="fn1221">(1) The meaning is not that the doors of forgiveness are for ever shut against them, but that they are so hardened in sinning that they will not manifest any desire to repent. On this passage, cf. above XXIX, 5, p. 141f.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1222">(2) GRA alters the number at the opening to six, so bringing it into conformity with the other sayings of &#x2018;six&#x2019; enumerated at the end of this chapter. He deletes &#x2018;he who sins with the intention of repenting&#x2019;, and in its place inserts the following two persons: &#x2018;he who sins with the intention of the Day of Atonement affording him atonement, and he who causes the many to sin&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1223">(3) Some commentators attach <span dir="rtl">&#x05D1;&#x05E2;&#x05D5;&#x05E0;&#x05D5;</span>, &#x2018;in his sin&#x2019;, to the preceding which would then read: &#x2018;he who has among his sins the guilt of profaning the Name&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1224">(4) Probably the principles of theosophy and metaphysics.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1225">(5) i.e. freedom of choice is in man&#x2019;s hand. Cf. Aboth III, 19 (Sonc. ed., III, 15, p. 38) where an analogous maxim is ascribed to R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba. The other anonymous statements given here belong most probably to him.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1227">(7) Since for certain transgressions repentance is not sufficient and something more is required to annul the decree; cf. above XXIX, 5, p. 141f. In Yoma 86b (Sonc. ed., p. 432) the text reads: &#x2018;The repentance of confirmed sinners delays punishment even though the decree of punishment has already been sealed&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1228">(8) Cf. Ber. 55a (Sonc. ed., p. 335).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1229">(9) Cf. above XXIX, 5, p. 141f.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1230">(10) These &#x2018;are paid outright&#x2019;, i.e. they will enjoy the reward of their grudging fulfilment of the precepts of the Torah on earth, while their punishment lies in store for them in the world to come. &#x2018;With ill grace&#x2019; is lit. &#x2018;with an evil eye&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1231">(11) These righteous men are punished during their lifetime for their few shortcomings and lapses, but a full reward for their good deeds is &#x2018;credited&#x2019; to them to be enjoyed in the hereafter.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1232">(12) That man should leave this life as sinless as when he was born into it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1233">(13) Cf. the fuller form of this saying in Aboth III, 18 (Sonc. ed., III, 14, pp. 37f), where it is ascribed to R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1236">(16) Prov. IV, 2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1237">(17) Cf. &#x1E32;id. 40b (Sonc. ed., p. 201) where the exposition of the parable is given in the text. The single bough which overhangs an unclean place represents the few and minor failings of the righteous on earth, and the act of lopping off suggests the punishment they suffer in this world whereby they are purged of their sins.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1238">(18) Here the bough overhangs a clean place and represents the few good deeds of the wicked on earth, and the lopping off suggests the prosperity they enjoy in this world whereby they are paid off for the little good they did, so that in the hereafter they suffer for their misdeeds.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1239">(19) Cf. Sanh. 95a (Sonc. ed., p. 639).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1252">(32) Meaning &#x2018;the peaceful one&#x2019;; cf. 2 Sam. XII, 24, 1 Chron. XXII, 9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1253">(33) &#x2018;The beloved of the Lord&#x2019;, the name given to Solomon by God through the prophet Nathan; cf. 2 Sam. XII, 25.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1254">(34) &#x2018;The Preacher, or Convener&#x2019; (Eccles. I, 1). According to Rabbinic tradition Solomon was also named &#x1E32;oheleth because his words were spoken in &#x2018;the assembly&#x2019; (<italic>kahal</italic>); cf. Midrash Rabbah, Ecclesiastes, I, 1, &#x00A7;2 (Sonc. ed., p. 3).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1255">(35) Cf. Prov. XXX, 1, where the superscription reads, <italic>The words of Agur the son of Jakeh</italic>. In view of the Rabbinic tradition that Solomon was the author of the Book of Proverbs, the names in this verse are interpreted as descriptive of him. &#x2018;He was called Agur because he stored up (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D4;&#x05E7;&#x05D9;&#x05D0;</span>) knowledge of the Torah, and the son of Jakeh because he spewed it out (<italic>hi&#x1E33;&#x1E33;i</italic>&#x2019;) in that he ignored the warning against multiplying wives. Another interpretation: He was called Agur because he girded (<italic>&#x1E25;agar</italic>) his loins to acquire wisdom, and the son of Jakeh because he was free (<italic>na&#x1E33;i</italic>) from sin&#x2019; (Yal&#x1E33;u&#x1E6D; Prov. <italic>ad loc.</italic>). See also Midrash to Eccles. <italic>loc. cit.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1256">(36) Cf. Prov. XXXI, 1. The word Lemuel is explained as &#x2018;towards (<span dir="rtl">&#x05DC;&#x05DE;&#x05D5;</span>) God (<span dir="rtl">&#x05D0;&#x05DC;</span>)&#x2019;, and is regarded as an epithet of Solomon who was dedicated to God; or &#x2018;against God&#x2019; when he multiplied wives (Midrash to Eccles. <italic>loc. cit.</italic>).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1266">(10) lit. &#x2018;they will not bring on sin to his hand&#x2019;, i.e. he himself will be safeguarded against sinning, for the righteousness of the many will act as a defence to him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1267">(11) Ps. XVI, 10. &#x2018;For God will prevent sin from bringing about his downfall&#x2019; (Rashi to Yoma 87a).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1268">(12) Because the sins he caused others to commit are beyond the remedial action of his own repentance.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1269">(13) Prov. XXVIII, 17.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1270">(14) Cf. Mishnah Yoma VIII, 9 (Sonc. ed., p. 423). In the Mishnah the words &#x2018;I will sin and repent&#x2019; are repeated, and according to the explanation in the Gemara (Yoma 87a, Sonc. ed., p. 433) it is only when a man said so on two occasions that he is precluded from repentance. Cf, however, Maimonides, <italic>Hil. Teshubah</italic>, IV, 1, where the words &#x2018;I will sin and repent&#x2019; are only stated once.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1271">(15) According to the commentators, also if he said so on two occasions.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1272">(16) The Heb. <italic>mara&#x1E33;</italic> means primarily &#x2018;to scour, rub away&#x2019;, then &#x2018;to wipe away, cleanse completely&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1273">(17) lit. &#x2018;and he walks in his integrity&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1274">(18) This view contradicts the statement in the foregoing passage as well as Mishnah Yoma <italic>loc. cit.</italic> where it is taught that if a man says on two occasions &#x2018;I will sin and repent&#x2019;, the opportunity of repenting is denied him. It has been suggested that the text should read here, &#x2018;He who sins once and then a second time is granted pardon up to three times (inclusive), but no more&#x2019;. Cf. Yoma 86b (Sonc. ed., p. 430).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1275">(19) Cf. Aboth V, 13 (Sonc. ed., V, 10, p. 67) for the full text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1276">(20) GRA substitutes &#x2018;teach&#x2019; for &#x2018;learn&#x2019; throughout this passage.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1277">(21) Who is pleased to see others study although he evinces no interest in learning for himself.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1278">(22) It is difficult to see how this type exhibits the characteristics of the men of Sodom, who were notoriously grudging and selfish. Perhaps it must be assumed that the type described is the man who has a special talent for teaching and grudgingly withholds it from the pupils. [It may be an erroneous insertion based on the analogous saying in Aboth V, 13, Sonc. ed., V, 10, p. 67.]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1279">(23) lit. &#x2018;has a portion&#x2019;, i.e. shares in the reward of the scholars.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1280">(24) So according to GRA and many commentators. In V a negative is inserted, reading &#x2018;and does not sit&#x2019;. Similarly in the next phrase.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1281">(25) The text describing the third category is in disorder; it is reconstructed according to GRA and Schechter.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1282">(26) Allowing the great scholar to sit at the head while he sits at a distance.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1283">(27) Implying that he has nothing to learn from the Sages.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1284">(28) Cf. Aboth V, 18 (Sonc. ed., V, 15, p. 69).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1285">(29) He has not the ability to discriminate between the weighty and the light, the important and the trivial.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1286">(30) The Heb. <italic>&#x1E33;ema&#x1E25;</italic> here denotes the superfine dust which is of useless quality (Maimonides). According to Taylor, quoted by J. H. Hertz in his P.B. with Commentary, p. 697, &#x2018;The sieve (or, sifter) spoken of is one which retains the fine flour in a receptacle attached to the machine, and is so constructed that the coarse grain passes out at the end of the sieve&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1287">(31) The text as well as the meaning is dubious. To what does &#x2018;him&#x2019; refer? Perhaps to the last type mentioned, the wicked student. According to R. Eliezer he is not so much wicked as deficient in discrimination. He describes him as a horn which is perforated at its sharp end, thereby allowing what enters to run out. Moreover, his mind is defective (<span dir="rtl">&#x05E7;&#x05D9;&#x05D8;&#x05D5;&#x05E2;&#x05D4;</span> from the root <span dir="rtl">&#x05E7;&#x05D8;&#x05E2;</span>, &#x2018;to mutilate&#x2019;) and he can retain only what comes last, like the child who keeps only what he receives last and has not the sense to appraise relative values.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1288">(32) Or, &#x2018;the student of poor intellect&#x2019;; cf. Ned. 41a (Sonc. ed., p. 129): &#x2018;No one is poor save him who lacks knowledge&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1289">(33) He is useless like the unclean and inedible fish.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1290">(34) Or, &#x2018;the student of rich intellect&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1291">(35) His is a combination of wealth and learning, thus fulfilling the verse, <italic>The crown of the wise is their riches</italic> (Prov. XIV, 24).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1292">(36) The Jordan fish is small; and this student is narrow and restricted; he has limited knowledge but cannot develop it by argument.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1293">(37) Like the Great Sea fish which is large, so he is proficient and discerning, and by argumentation is able to interpret the Torah correctly in accordance with tradition.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1294">(38) So GRA. V reads &#x2018;qualities&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1295">(39) A variant is &#x2018;a javelin&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1296">(40) Evil spirits or demons were regarded as material beings, possessing human organs and exercising human functions; cf. above XXXVII, 3, p. 183.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1297">(41) Cf. Ber. 57b (Sonc. ed., p. 356) where three Rabbis are named.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1298">(42) R. Eleazar was very wealthy; cf. Shab. 54b (Sonc. ed., p. 252).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1299">(43) He suffered martyrdom under the Romans.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1300">(44) They were leading authorities but never ordained as Rabbis.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1301">(45) He became a heretic and is referred to in the Talmud as <italic>&#x2019;A&#x1E25;er</italic>, &#x2018;another&#x2019;; cf. &#x1E24;ag. 15a (Sonc. ed., pp. 93ff).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1302">(46) Ber. <italic>loc. cit.</italic> has &#x2018;piety&#x2019; in place of &#x2018;humility&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1303">(47) Cf. Mishnah Sanh. VIII, 5 (Sonc. ed., p. 488).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1304">(48) Because they can no more sin and the world is more peaceful.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1305">(49) The righteous while alive add merit to themselves and stand as a protective shield for their generation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1306">(50) While sleeping they can do no evil.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1307">(51) Because their time could be better spent in study and good deeds which would be an advantage to themselves and to others. This sentence is missing in V but is found in MS. E. and also in Mishnah Sanh. <italic>loc. cit.</italic> The insertion of this sentence brings the number of items up to three, which is the theme of this paragraph. Cf. GRA.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1308">(52) In quietude the wicked devise mischief but the righteous meditate on the Torah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1309">(53) Cf. Mishnah Ber. IX, 5 (Sonc. ed., p. 328): &#x2018;A man should not act in an unseemly manner while opposite the Eastern Gate of the Temple since it faces the Holy of Holies&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1310">(54) A variant reads &#x2018;but to north or south&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1311">(55) Cf. Ber. 61b, 62a (Sonc. ed., pp. 387ff).</ftnote>

<p>Toil in the study of the Torah, and do not occupy yourself with idle matters. It is related that R. Simeon b.

<p>It is related that R. Simeon b. Eleazar<sup><xref rid="fn1323">7</xref></sup> was returning from his master&#x2019;s house in Migdal-eder<sup><xref rid="fn1324">8</xref></sup> riding on an ass along the sea-shore when he met a man who was extremely ugly. He said to him, &#x2018;Worthless man&#x0021; How ugly you are&#x0021; Are all the men of your town as ugly as you?&#x2019; The other replied, &#x2018;What can I do? Go to the Craftsman Who made me and say to Him, &#x201C;How ugly is this vessel which Thou hast made&#x0021;&#x201D; &#x2019; When R. Simeon realized that he had done wrong, he dismounted from the ass, prostrated himself before the man and said, &#x2018;I apologize to you, forgive me&#x2019;. But the man answered, &#x2018;I will not forgive you until you say to the Craftsman Who made me, &#x201C;How ugly is the vessel which Thou hast made&#x0021;&#x201D; &#x2019; R. Simeon ran after him for three miles [until he reached his town]. When the people of the town came out to meet him, greeting him with the words, &#x2018;Peace be unto you, Master&#x2019;, the man asked them, &#x2018;Whom do you address as Master?&#x2019; They replied, &#x2018;Him who follows you&#x2019;. He said to them, &#x2018;If this man is a master, may there not be many like him in Israel&#x0021;&#x2019; &#x2018;Heaven forbid&#x0021;&#x2019; they exclaimed; &#x2018;what did he do to you?&#x2019; He answered, &#x2018;This is how he behaved towards me&#x2019;. They said to him, &#x2018;Nevertheless, forgive him&#x2019;. The man replied, &#x2018;I will forgive him, but on condition that he will never again act in this manner&#x2019;. That same day R. Simeon entered his great House of Study and lectured: At all times a man should be pliant as a reed and not hard like a cedar. Now what is the feature of the reed? Though all the winds come and blow upon it, it gives and bends with them; but when the winds are stilled it again stands upright in its place. And what happens to the reed in the end?<sup><xref rid="fn1325">9</xref></sup> It is privileged that of it a pen is made for writing a Torah scroll. The cedar, on the other hand, cannot stand in its place [against the winds], for when the south<sup><xref rid="fn1326">10</xref></sup> wind blows upon it, it uproots and overturns it. And what happens to the cedar in the end? Lumbermen come and cut it up, and it is used for roofing houses while the residue is cast into the fire. Hence [the Sages] said: A man should be pliant as a reed and not hard like a cedar.</p>
<p label="2.">Three different tributes are paid to men [for their acts of charity]. He who gives alms, a blessing be upon him; he who lends is better than he; but he who provides [the poor man with money to do trade] sharing the profits with him<sup><xref rid="fn1327">11</xref></sup> is the best of all.<sup><xref rid="fn1328">12</xref></sup></p>

<title>Tractate Soferim</title>
<chapter>
<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<h1><small>NAME OF TRACTATE</small></h1>
<p>The tractate is known as <italic>Masseketh Soferim</italic> (&#x2018;The Tractate for Scribes&#x2019;) or <italic>Hilkoth Soferim</italic> (&#x2018;The Laws, or Regulations, for Scribes&#x2019;). The scribes referred to were a class of pious and learned men who were partly or wholly engaged in copying scrolls of the Torah and other scripts used for religious purposes.</p>
<p>In consideration of the fact that the principal subject of the first nine chapters is the correct functioning of the scribes, their professional and religious duties, and guidance in the selection of the right materials for the sacred work, the entire tractate was given the title of &#x2018;Scribes&#x2019;. Such a method of naming was not unusual in ancient Hebrew works, which were not, in their titles, always descriptive of their full contents.</p>
<h1><small>DATE OF COMPILATION</small></h1>
<p>From internal evidence it is clear that, in its present form, <italic>Soferim</italic> was compiled some time after the final redaction of the Babylonian Talmud. Most scholars hold that the date of its compilation was in the Gaonic period, about the middle of the eighth century (cf. J. E. and <italic>O&#x1E93;ar Yisrael</italic>, <italic>s.v.</italic>, and the authorities there quoted).</p>
<h1><small>PLACE IN RABBINIC LITERATURE</small></h1>
<p><italic>Soferim</italic> is one of the <italic>Massektoth &#x1E32;e&#x1E6D;annoth</italic>, &#x2018;The Minor Tractates&#x2019; of the Talmud, known also as <italic>Sefarim &#x1E24;i&#x1E93;&#x1E93;onim</italic>, &#x2018;External Books&#x2019;. This denotes the works outside the Talmudic Canon whose relation to the Talmud is somewhat analogous to that of the <italic>Baraithoth</italic> to the Mishnah. The number of these Minor Tractates is variously given as fifteen or thirteen, while earlier authorities mention only seven.</p>
<h1><small>IMPORTANCE AND AUTHORITY</small></h1>
<p><italic>Soferim</italic> is regarded as the most authoritative in this category. The contents of the first five chapters, without the interpolations, are paralleled in a separate tractate in the <italic>Massektoth &#x1E32;e&#x1E6D;annoth</italic> known as <italic>Sefer Torah</italic> (&#x2018;Scroll of the Torah&#x2019;). The latter also belongs to the Gaonic era.</p>
<p>The rulings in <italic>Soferim</italic> at times disagree with those of the Babylonian or Jerusalem Talmud, and in a number of instances, according to the Tosafists (cf., e.g., Ber. 18a, <italic>s.v. Lema&#x1E25;ar;</italic> Pes. 40b, <italic>s.v. &#x2019;Abal</italic>), its guidance is to be followed. One example may be quoted where the ruling of a Mishnah is disregarded in favour of one in <italic>Soferim:</italic> In Meg. III, 6 (30b, 31a, Sonc. ed., p. 187) it is laid down that on fast days, other than the ninth of <italic>Ab</italic> and the fasts associated with supplications in times of drought, the Scriptural reading is the section of the Blessings and Curses (Lev. XXVI, 3-46); but nowadays the ruling of <italic>Soferim</italic> XVII, 7 is adopted to read the passage beginning <italic>And Moses besought</italic> (Ex. XXXII, 11-14 and XXXIV, 1-10). Much of the tractate has also been incorporated in the Synagogue liturgy, the <italic>Masorah</italic> and similar works.</p>
<h1><small>SOLE AUTHORITY</small></h1>
<p>Regarding the regulations for scribes, <italic>Soferim</italic> is in some respects the only source, no mention of them being found in the Mishnah. The explanation of this omission may possibly be that the regulations in question were so well known when the Mishnah was compiled (<italic>c.</italic> 200 <small>C.E.</small>) that there was no need to commit them to writing. A similar reason for other omissions, it may be added, is given by Maimonides in his <italic>Commentary on the Mishnah</italic>, Men. IV, 1.</p>
<h1><small>NATURE OF THE MATERIAL</small></h1>
<p>Legal <italic>Baraithoth</italic> and other Rabbinical teaching, mainly or Palestinian origin, constitute the bulk of the tractate, and to these were added customs which were in vogue in the Holy Land or Babylon. The <italic>Baraithoth</italic>, like the Mishnah and Gemara, were originally oral traditions and in outline, at least, must have taken shape before the redaction of the Talmud. In the last section of the tractate there is also embodied material from the Babylonian Talmud (cf. Rappaport, <italic>Kerem &#x1E24;emed</italic>, VI, p. 247; Zunz, G.V., 2nd ed., p. 322).</p>
<h1><small>IRREGULAR SEQUENCE</small></h1>
<p>Originally that part of <italic>Soferim</italic> which is concise and systematic was prepared for the specific use of scribes. It has, however, undergone many changes, and the present text is not conspicuous for order and logical sequence. Rules for the preparation of scrolls, the statutory prayers, public readings and stories from the <italic>&#x2019;Aggada</italic> all find their random places in the chapters of the tractate (cf. Zunz, <italic>op. cit.</italic>, p. 100).</p>
<h1><small>A PRACTICAL MANUAL</small></h1>
<p>Like the other <italic>Massektoth &#x1E32;e&#x1E6D;annoth, Soferim</italic>, though containing considerable interpolations, is concerned in the main with the single theme of scribes and sacred documents. On account of their form, they are often regarded as the first manuals in Rabbinic literature which consist of systematic collections of concise and comprehensive rules for practical use. In older Rabbinic literature rules of this nature would be scattered over many tractates of the Talmud and embedded in complicated discussions.</p>
<h1><small>MAIN DIVISIONS</small></h1>
<p>In a rough classification the tractate may be divided into three sections:</p>
<p>(<italic>i</italic>) Rules concerning the preparation and proper writing and handling of sacred scrolls and the persons qualified for the work (chaps. I-V).</p>
<p>(<italic>ii</italic>) Continuation of the rules on the same subject (chaps. VI-IX).</p>
<p>(<italic>iii</italic>) Rules concerning the public reading of the Torah, the Prophets and Hagiographa, the statutory services on the New Moon and Festivals, the fasts and other solemn days; liturgical rules in connection with one or other of these occasions (chaps. X-XV, XVII-XXI).</p>
<p>Chapter XVI discusses in the main the place of the <italic>&#x2019;Aggada</italic> in Rabbinic literature, and about half of chapter XXI is devoted to it. In the edition of V the number of Rules is 226. M gives the number as 230 and J.E. as 225.</p>

<title>SOFERIM</title>
<title>CHAPTER I</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. It is not permitted to write [the sacred] books,<sup><xref rid="fn1382">1</xref></sup> <italic>tefillin</italic> and <italic>mezuzoth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1383">2</xref></sup> on skins of ritually unclean cattle or on skins of ritually unclean wild animals. Nor may they<sup><xref rid="fn1384">3</xref></sup> be sewn with their sinews, or [the parchment rolls of <italic>tefillin</italic>] be wound with their hair. It is an oral prescription delivered to Moses at Sinai that [all these] shall be written on the skins of ritually clean cattle or ritually clean wild animals, be sewn together with their sinews and [the <italic>tefillin</italic> rolls] wound with their hair. It is also an oral prescription delivered to Moses at Sinai that [the parchments] shall be ruled with a reed<sup><xref rid="fn1385">4</xref></sup> and the writing on the skin be done with ink. [This latter requirement] has support in Scripture, <italic>And I wrote them with ink in the book</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1386">5</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. R. Joshua the grits-dealer was asked: &#x2018;Why is it permitted to write [sacred scrolls] on the skins of <italic>nebeloth</italic> and <italic>&#x1E6D;erefoth?</italic>&#x2019; &#x2018;I will give you an analogy,&#x2019; R. Joshua replied. &#x2018;This is similar to the case of two men who were condemned to death by the State, one being executed by the king and the other by the executioner. Which of them is superior? He who was executed by the king.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1387">6</xref></sup> &#x2018;If so,&#x2019; he retorted, &#x2018;they should be permitted to be eaten&#x0021;&#x2019; &#x2018;It is stated,&#x2019; replied R. Joshua, &#x2018;<italic>Ye shall not eat any</italic> nebelah.<sup><xref rid="fn1388">7</xref></sup> Scripture has forbidden it, so what can I do for you?&#x2019; (From here it is inferred that it is permitted to write on skins of <italic>nebelah</italic> and on skins of <italic>&#x1E6D;erefah</italic> and there is no need to consider the possibility of their having been pierced at the animal&#x2019;s heart.)<sup><xref rid="fn1389">8</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. Skins<sup><xref rid="fn1390">9</xref></sup> for the [sacred] books, <italic>tefillin</italic> and <italic>mezuzoth</italic> may be bought anywhere, and one need not consider the possibility that they might be skins which were pierced at the animal&#x2019;s heart.</p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. The writing on <italic>&#x1E33;elaf</italic> must be on the side of the flesh, and on <italic>gewil</italic> it must be on the side of the hair, no deviation from this being permitted. It is an oral prescription delivered to Moses at Sinai that if one changed one for the other, [the scroll] may not be used for the lection [in the statutory services].</p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. [The sacred texts]<sup><xref rid="fn1391">10</xref></sup> may not be written on <italic>difthera</italic> or erased paper;<sup><xref rid="fn1392">11</xref></sup> nor with coal,<sup><xref rid="fn1393">12</xref></sup> shoe-black, ink containing gum, vitriol or fruit-juice.<sup><xref rid="fn1394">13</xref></sup> Vitriol may not be added to the ink.</p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. [The sacred texts] may not be written in [obsolete] Hebrew characters,<sup><xref rid="fn1395">14</xref></sup> or in the Aramaic, Median or Greek languages.<sup><xref rid="fn1396">15</xref></sup> If they were written in any other language or in any other characters they may not be used for the lection [in the statutory services], since they must be written in the Assyrian [script].</p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>. It once happened that five elders wrote the Torah for King Ptolemy<sup><xref rid="fn1397">16</xref></sup> in Greek, and that day was as ominous for Israel as the day on which the golden calf was made, since the Torah could not be accurately translated.</p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>. It also happened that King Ptolemy assembled seventy-two elders and placed them in seventy-two [separate] rooms without telling them the reason for which he had assembled them. He then went to each one of them and said to him,<sup><xref rid="fn1398">17</xref></sup> &#x2018;Write for me [a translation of] the Torah of Moses your master&#x2019;. The Omnipresent inspired them<sup><xref rid="fn1399">18</xref></sup> and the mind of all of them was identical, so that each on his own<sup><xref rid="fn1400">19</xref></sup> wrote the [same translation of the] Torah, introducing [the same] thirteen alterations<sup><xref rid="fn1401">20</xref></sup> as follows: &#x2018;God created in the beginning&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn1402">21</xref></sup> &#x2018;And God said I shall make a man in image and likeness.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1403">22</xref></sup> &#x2018;And He finished on the sixth [day] and rested on the seventh [day].&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1404">23</xref></sup> &#x2018;Male and female He created him.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1405">24</xref></sup> &#x2018;Come let Me go down and there confound their language.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1406">25</xref></sup> &#x2018;And Sarah laughed among her relatives,<sup><xref rid="fn1407">26</xref></sup> saying.&#x2019; &#x2018;For in their anger they slew oxen<sup><xref rid="fn1408">27</xref></sup> and in their self-will they digged up a stall.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1409">28</xref></sup> &#x2018;And Moses took his wife and his children and set them upon a carrier<sup><xref rid="fn1410">29</xref></sup> of men.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1411">30</xref></sup> &#x2018;Now the time that the children of Israel dwelt in Egypt and in the land of Canaan and in other lands<sup><xref rid="fn1412">31</xref></sup> was four hundred and thirty years.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1413">32</xref></sup> &#x2018;And he sent the elect of the children of Israel.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1414">33</xref></sup> &#x2018;And upon the elect of the children of Israel He laid not His hand.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1415">34</xref></sup> &#x2018;I have not taken one desirable thing<sup><xref rid="fn1416">35</xref></sup> from them.&#x2019; &#x2018;The [beast] with small legs.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1417">36</xref></sup> &#x2018;Which the Lord thy God hath allotted to give light unto all the peoples under the whole heaven.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1418">37</xref></sup> &#x2018;Which I commanded should not be served.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1419">38</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>. [The sacred scrolls] may not be written in gold. It is related that in an Alexandrian<sup><xref rid="fn1420">39</xref></sup> scroll of the Torah all the divine names were written in gold, and when the matter came before the Sages they decided that it should be stored away.<sup><xref rid="fn1421">40</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 10</small>. All the Torah is in Hebrew but it contains some Aramaic words.<sup><xref rid="fn1422">41</xref></sup> What is in Hebrew may not be written in Aramaic and the Aramaic words may not be altered; for example, <italic>Jegar-sahadutha</italic> and <italic>Galeed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1423">42</xref></sup> Others hold that the rule applies only to <italic>Jegar-sahadutha</italic> and <italic>Galeed</italic> because they are two specifically Aramaic and Hebrew expressions respectively.<sup><xref rid="fn1424">43</xref></sup> If Hebrew words were written in Aramaic or Aramaic words in Hebrew, the scroll may not be used for the lection. The Aramaic [and Hebrew] words referred to are <italic>Jegar-sahadutha, Galeed</italic> and the like.</p>
<p>If <italic>ha&#x2019;azinu hashshamayim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1425">44</xref></sup> was arranged like the Song of Moses<sup><xref rid="fn1426">45</xref></sup> or if the Song of Moses was arranged like <italic>ha&#x2019;azinu;</italic> if continuous lines were written in broken ones or vice versa; [35<italic>b</italic>] or if the breaking up was not done according to the rule, the scroll may not be used for the lection.</p>
<p><small>RULE 11</small>. If one finished [writing nearly] all the Torah and less than a column<sup><xref rid="fn1427">46</xref></sup> remained of the text, one need not hesitate to make of this a small column on its own.<sup><xref rid="fn1428">47</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 12</small>. A [parchment] sheet [of the Torah scroll] containing six columns may be divided into two sheets;<sup><xref rid="fn1429">48</xref></sup> but one of five columns may not be divided, in order that it should not<sup><xref rid="fn1430">49</xref></sup> be separated into one of two<sup><xref rid="fn1431">50</xref></sup> and one of three columns. No one is allowed to write [a scroll of the Torah] unless one is able to read.<sup><xref rid="fn1432">51</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 13</small>. A scroll of the Torah that was written by a Sadducee,<sup><xref rid="fn1433">52</xref></sup> an informer,<sup><xref rid="fn1434">53</xref></sup> a proselyte,<sup><xref rid="fn1435">54</xref></sup> a slave, a woman,<sup><xref rid="fn1436">55</xref></sup> a madman or a minor may not be used for the lection.<sup><xref rid="fn1437">56</xref></sup> This is the rule: Whosoever cannot act in religious matters on behalf of the public is not permitted to write a scroll of the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn1438">57</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 14</small>. If an open section was written as closed or vice versa, the scroll must be stored away. What is an open section? One which does not begin at the beginning of a line. And what is a closed section? [One which is separated from what precedes by a vacant] space in the middle of the line. And how much space must be left at the beginning of a line so that a section may be called &#x2018;open&#x2019;? A space in which a name of three letters may be written.<sup><xref rid="fn1439">58</xref></sup> And how much space must be left in the middle of a line so that a section may be called &#x2018;closed&#x2019;? A space in which a name of three letters may be written. If an entire section was completed at the end of a column, one vacant line must be left at the top [of the next column]; but if a vacant space in which a name of three letters may be written was left at the foot [of the column], one begins [the next column] from the top.</p>
<ftnote id="fn1382">(1) The scrolls of the Pentateuch used for the lections in public worship.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1383">(2) These two nouns are added by GRA and M. For Hebrew and other terms, see the Glossary.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1384">(3) The parchment sheets of which the scrolls are made up.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1385">(4) To guide the hand of the scribe, the letters being written under the ruled lines.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1386">(5) Jer. XXXVI, 18.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1387">(6) <italic>Nebeloth</italic> and <italic>&#x1E6D;erefoth</italic> are the effect of an act of God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1388">(7) Deut. XIV, 21. E.V. <italic>of anything that dieth of itself</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1389">(8) This sentence is enclosed in brackets in some eds. It was a heathen practice to remove the heart from a live animal to be offered as a sacrifice; this, in Rabbinic law, rendered the entire animal, including its skin, forbidden as an idolatrous offering (&#x2018;A.Z. 29b, Sonc. ed., p. 145).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1390">(9) Before they were dressed; but dressed skins may be bought only from trust-worthy persons who can testify that the dressing had been done in accordance with the law.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1391">(10) Mentioned in Rule 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1392">(11) Others, &#x2018;palimpsest&#x2019;. GRA omits &#x2018;erased&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1393">(12) Or, &#x2018;black pigment&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1394">(13) Others, &#x2018;rain-water&#x2019;, &#x2018;wine-lees&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1395">(14) The script must be &#x2018;Assyrian&#x2019; (the modern Hebrew square characters) and the language &#x2018;the holy tongue&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1396">(15) According to Meg. 9a (Sonc. ed., p. 48) it is permitted to write the Torah in Greek although this is not allowed in the case of <italic>tefillin</italic> and <italic>mezuzoth</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1397">(16) Presumed to be Ptolemy Philadelphus who reigned over Egypt 285-247 <small>B.C.E.</small> He arranged for the Greek Version, the Septuagint, to be made, as narrated in the next paragraph. [The Tractate gives two accounts of the translation, the present one being the later which reflects the harmful effects which the Septuagint had in arresting the development of exegesis among the Hellenistic Jews (cf. Weiss, <italic>Dor</italic>, I, p. 90).]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1398">(17) lit. &#x2018;to them&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1399">(18) lit. &#x2018;put counsel in the heart of each one of them&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1400">(19) So GRA.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1401">(20) Deviations from the traditional text. In the extant Versions of the Septuagint only some of these are found.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1402">(21) Instead of <italic>In the beginning God created</italic> (Gen. I, 1) the Heb. of which might be misinterpreted to mean that a power named &#x2018;Bereshith&#x2019; (in the beginning) created God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1403">(22) The Heb. text reads: <italic>Let us make man in our image, after our likeness</italic> (Gen. I, 26). The plural <italic>us</italic> and <italic>our</italic> might erroneously suggest a plurality of deities.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1404">(23) For the Heb.: <italic>And He finished on the seventh day</italic> (Gen. II, 2) which could be understood to imply that God did some work on the seventh day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1405">(24) Instead of <italic>created them</italic> (<italic>ibid.</italic> V, 2) from which it might be inferred that man and woman were, from the first, two separate beings, contrary to <italic>ibid.</italic> II, 21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1406">(25) Instead of <italic>let us go down</italic> (<italic>ibid.</italic> XI, 7).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1407">(26) i.e. she laughed in the presence of people and therefore incurred censure (<italic>ibid.</italic> XVIII, 12). The Heb. means &#x2018;within herself&#x2019; as Abraham had done when he <italic>laughed &#x2026; in his heart</italic> (<italic>ibid.</italic> XVII, 17) and had not been rebuked.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1408">(27) So GRA, H and M. V incorrectly &#x2018;a man&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1409">(28) Changing <italic>men</italic> (<italic>ibid.</italic> XLIX, 6) to &#x2018;oxen&#x2019; and <italic>oxen</italic> to &#x2018;stall&#x2019; in order to remove the stigma of murder from Jacob&#x2019;s sons.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1410">(29) So M. V and H read &#x2018;carriers of men&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1411">(30) i.e. an animal conformable with the dignity of Moses, instead of <italic>ass</italic> (Ex. IV, 20).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1412">(31) So M. V omits &#x2018;and in other lands&#x2019;. [The reading of the Septuagint is &#x2018;in the land of Canaan and in the land of Egypt&#x2019;.]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1413">(32) Instead of the Heb. which omits &#x2018;in the land of Canaan and in other lands&#x2019; (Ex. XII, 40), and implies that all the 430 years were spent in Egypt when, in fact, they could not have dwelt there more than 210 years (cf. Rashi to Meg. 9a).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1414">(33) So GRA and Meg. 9a but omitted in V. &#x2018;Elect&#x2019; is substituted for <italic>young men</italic> (<italic>ibid.</italic> XXIV, 5), the former being regarded as more suitable persons for the service.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1415">(34) Here also &#x2018;elect&#x2019; was substituted for the Heb. for <italic>nobles</italic> (<italic>ibid.</italic> 11). The alteration was not essential, but &#x2018;elect&#x2019; which was mentioned earlier was preferred. It should be noted that in the total of thirteen alterations, this and the preceding are counted as one.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1416">(35) A &#x2018;desirable thing&#x2019; [which occurs in the Septuagint] for the Heb. <italic>ass</italic> (Num. XVI, 15) to avoid the suggestion that Moses did not take an ass but more precious objects.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1417">(36) Instead of the Heb. for <italic>the hare</italic> (Lev. XI, 6) which is <italic>arnebeth</italic>, so as not to give offence to Ptolemy the name of whose queen was Arnebeth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1418">(37) The insertion &#x2018;to give light&#x2019; (Deut. IV, 19) removes the possible misunderstanding that the heavenly bodies enumerated in the verse were intended by God to be objects of worship.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1419">(38) Deut. XVII, 3 reads <italic>which I have commanded not</italic>. This might be taken to mean that God did not desire their existence and their creation was consequently due to a power beyond His control. It should be noted that the last two alterations are regarded as one in the enumeration because both deal with heavenly bodies as objects of worship.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1420">(39) So M. V and H read &#x2018;a scroll of the Torah of Alexander&#x2019; [i.e. Alexander Jannaeus (103-76 <small>B.C.E.</small>) according to Krauss, <italic>Lehnw&#x00F6;rter</italic>, II, p. 55].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1421">(40) lit. &#x2018;it shall be hidden&#x2019;; not to be used for the lection.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1422">(41) lit. &#x2018;translation&#x2019; (<italic>Targum</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1423">(42) Gen. XXXI, 47, &#x2018;the heap of witness&#x2019; in Aramaic and Hebrew.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1424">(43) In the case of the other parts, however, although one language should not be changed for another, the scroll is not disqualified if a change was made (cf. N.Y. <italic>ad loc.</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1425">(44) <italic>Give ear ye heavens</italic>, the opening words of Deut. XXXII, 1-43, which is arranged in the scroll as follows:</ftnote>
<ftnote>_________________</ftnote>
<ftnote>_________________</ftnote>
<ftnote>_________________</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1426">(45) Ex. XV, 1-18 written as:</ftnote>
<ftnote>_________________</ftnote>
<ftnote>_________________</ftnote>
<ftnote>_________________</ftnote>
<ftnote>_________________</ftnote>
<ftnote>_________________</ftnote>
<ftnote>or, according to others:</ftnote>
<ftnote>_________________</ftnote>
<ftnote>_________________</ftnote>
<ftnote>_________________</ftnote>
<ftnote>_________________</ftnote>
<ftnote>_________________</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1427">(46) So GRA and H. V reads: &#x2018;If one finished all the column and left over less, one extends the wording so as to make&#x2019;, etc. A reading in M is &#x2018;if one finished all the book and left less than a column, one extends the writing so as to make&#x2019;, etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1428">(47) The extension of a short passage over a full column is done either by enlarging the characters or, according to others, by making each successive line shorter than the one preceding it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1429">(48) Each containing three columns.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1430">(49) So GRA and N. Y. H and M read: &#x2018;perhaps one might&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1431">(50) Not less than three columns may be contained in each sheet.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1432">(51) M inserts: &#x2018;one is not allowed to write unless [the parchment] was ruled; and if an unruled sheet was written on, it is disqualified&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1433">(52) An adherent of a sect which was opposed to the teachings and traditions of the Pharisees. M adds <italic>min</italic>, a Jewish heretic or Jewish-Christian.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1435">(54) This refers to a &#x2018;proselyte settler&#x2019; (<italic>ger toshab</italic>), one who does not observe the commandments but, on account of domicile in the land of Israel, has renounced idolatry.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1436">(55) So GRA and M; not in V and H.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1437">(56) For the unsuitability of the persons enumerated, cf. Gi&#x1E6D;. 45b (Sonc. ed., p. 199).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1438">(57) So GRA. V reads: &#x2018;everyone who writes it [must be a person who] may act on behalf of the public [in discharging a religious obligation]&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1439">(58) The view of Maimonides which has been adopted is that space must be left for three words, each of three letters (cf. Y.D. 275, &#x00A7;2).</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER II</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. Sufficient space must be left between words<sup><xref rid="fn1440">1</xref></sup> so that they can be distinguished, and between letters so that they be not mixed. If the letters were mixed or a break was made in the middle of a word, the scroll must not be used for the lection in the statutory services.<sup><xref rid="fn1441">2</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. Between lines there must be left the space of a line, between words the space of a letter, between letters that of a hairbreadth, and between columns the space of the width of a thumb. If [a word at]<sup><xref rid="fn1442">3</xref></sup> the end of a column was copied<sup><xref rid="fn1443">4</xref></sup> at the beginning [of the next column, the scroll] is disqualified. If the letters were mixed or if a break was made in the middle of a word, the lection may not be read from it.</p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. It is permitted to insert<sup><xref rid="fn1444">5</xref></sup> between columns [part of] a word of five<sup><xref rid="fn1445">6</xref></sup> letters. One may not write two letters within<sup><xref rid="fn1446">7</xref></sup> the column and three without;<sup><xref rid="fn1447">8</xref></sup> but it is not so with a short word.<sup><xref rid="fn1448">9</xref></sup> If the [part of a longer word, however, forms] a short word of two<sup><xref rid="fn1449">10</xref></sup> letters on its own,<sup><xref rid="fn1450">11</xref></sup> it is forbidden [to insert it between the columns].<sup><xref rid="fn1451">12</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. In a Torah scroll the space<sup><xref rid="fn1452">13</xref></sup> of two finger-breadths must be left between columns, but in scrolls of the Prophets and ordinary Pentateuchs<sup><xref rid="fn1453">14</xref></sup> a space of one thumb-breadth only. In the lower margin of a Torah scroll the space of a handbreadth is left, and in the upper margin three fingerbreadths;<sup><xref rid="fn1454">15</xref></sup> but in scrolls of the Prophets and ordinary Pentateuchs three finger-breadths in the lower margin and two finger-breadths in the upper. In all these cases,<sup><xref rid="fn1455">16</xref></sup> if it is desired to extend [the margins] this may be done, provided they do not exceed [the space of] the written matter. Between the books<sup><xref rid="fn1456">17</xref></sup> in a Torah scroll a vacant space of four lines must be left, and in a scroll of the Prophets three lines.<sup><xref rid="fn1457">18</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. If one finished [writing nearly] all the book<sup><xref rid="fn1458">19</xref></sup> and one column of text remained, one need not hesitate to make a small sheet of it.<sup><xref rid="fn1459">20</xref></sup> At the conclusion of the [last] column [sufficient parchment] must be left to wind [round the scroll]. It is proper<sup><xref rid="fn1460">21</xref></sup> to attach a roller to the end of a scroll for winding, but there is no need to attach one at the beginning of a scroll. In a Torah scroll, however, rollers should be attached at both ends. A scroll<sup><xref rid="fn1461">22</xref></sup> is therefore rolled up towards the beginning but a Torah scroll<sup><xref rid="fn1462">23</xref></sup> towards its<sup><xref rid="fn1463">24</xref></sup> centre. A Torah scroll may not be opened by [holding on to] a sheet;<sup><xref rid="fn1464">25</xref></sup> and the height<sup><xref rid="fn1465">26</xref></sup> of such a scroll must be six handbreadths.</p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. A sheet of a Torah scroll must contain not less than three columns and not more than eight. As regards the lines [in a scroll] a reason was given [for four different numbers]: corresponding to the journeys,<sup><xref rid="fn1466">27</xref></sup> forty-two; corresponding to the myriads of Israel, sixty; corresponding to the elders of Israel, seventy-two; and corresponding to the reproofs in Deuteronomy, [36<italic>a</italic>] ninety-eight; all depending on [the size of] the script.<sup><xref rid="fn1467">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>&#x2018;Corresponding to the journeys,&#x2019; as it is said, <italic>And Moses wrote their goings forth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1468">29</xref></sup> &#x2018;Corresponding to the myriads of Israel,&#x2019; as it is said, <italic>Write thou these words &#x2026; and with Israel;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1469">30</xref></sup> as Israel numbered sixty myriads so may the lines of the Torah be sixty [in a column]. &#x2018;Corresponding to the elders, seventy-two,&#x2019; as it is said, <italic>Gather unto Me seventy men</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1470">31</xref></sup> &#x2026; <italic>there remained &#x2026; in the camp &#x2026; of them that were recorded</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1471">32</xref></sup> &#x2018;Corresponding to the reproofs, ninety-eight,&#x2019; as it is said, <italic>If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1472">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the case of <italic>&#x1E33;elaf</italic> parchments no limit was prescribed, and one may add [as many lines]<sup><xref rid="fn1473">34</xref></sup> as desired, provided only there are not less than three columns [to the sheet].<sup><xref rid="fn1474">35</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>. If a sheet [of a Torah scroll] is worn out, one may not remove two [columns only]<sup><xref rid="fn1475">36</xref></sup> and replace them by two new columns; but three columns should be removed and replaced by three new ones, and the new columns must be written in the same size as the original script.</p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>. The width of a column [in a Torah scroll] must be such as to be recognizable at one glance,<sup><xref rid="fn1476">37</xref></sup> and in a small scroll not less than a handbreadth. R. Jose b. Judah says: It must not be less than the width of three fingers.</p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>. Half the length [of a column]<sup><xref rid="fn1477">38</xref></sup> must not be greater than its width, nor its width greater than half its length, but they must be exactly alike,<sup><xref rid="fn1478">39</xref></sup> and this is the most correct procedure.<sup><xref rid="fn1479">40</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 10</small>. A Torah scroll may not consist of half <italic>gewil</italic> and half <italic>&#x1E33;elaf</italic>, but it may consist of half <italic>gewil</italic> and half <italic>&#x1E33;elaf</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1480">41</xref></sup> of deers, although<sup><xref rid="fn1481">42</xref></sup> this is not the best procedure.</p>
<p><small>RULE 11</small>. [A tear in a parchment sheet of a Torah scroll] may not be joined with glue, nor is it permitted to write on a patch, nor may [the sheets] be sewn together on the written side. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said in the name of R. Meir: [A torn sheet] may be joined with glue and it is permitted to write on a patch. It is forbidden, however, to do the sewing<sup><xref rid="fn1482">43</xref></sup> on the written side within but [it must be done] on the outside.</p>
<p>A space should be left [unstitched] at the top and at the foot [of the sheets] in order that the scroll be not torn [in use].<sup><xref rid="fn1483">44</xref></sup> This, however, was at once qualified by adding: from the foot towards the top and from the top towards the foot. It is an oral prescription delivered to Moses at Sinai that, if a Torah scroll was torn, a patch may be placed on its outside.</p>
<p>In the case of the double letters of the alphabet,<sup><xref rid="fn1484">45</xref></sup> the first ones<sup><xref rid="fn1485">46</xref></sup> are written at the beginning and in the middle of a word, and the second<sup><xref rid="fn1486">47</xref></sup> at the end. If this is reversed,<sup><xref rid="fn1487">48</xref></sup> the scroll is disqualified. If a scroll<sup><xref rid="fn1488">49</xref></sup> is torn, a patch may be placed on the inside and<sup><xref rid="fn1489">50</xref></sup> it is not [obligatory to attach it] on the outside.<sup><xref rid="fn1490">51</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn1440">(1) lit. &#x2018;between name and name&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1441">(2) In V Rule 1 is enclosed within brackets, probably because it is included in the fuller version in the next Rule.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1442">(3) So according to GRA.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1443">(4) lit. &#x2018;made&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1444">(5) lit. &#x2018;place&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1445">(6) So N.Y. V, H and M read &#x2018;four&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1446">(7) So N.Y. V and H have &#x2018;at the end&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1447">(8) Because the greater part of the word must appear within the column. So N.Y. V, H and M read &#x2018;and two between the columns&#x2019;. GRA emends to &#x2018;one at the end of the column and three between the lines&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1448">(9) Of two letters (N.Y.). One letter may be written between columns (H).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1449">(10) So GRA. V, H and M, &#x2018;three letters&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1450">(11) In a noun like <span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05DC;&#x05D7;&#x05DF;</span> (table), for instance, which consists of four letters, the last two can form the word <span dir="rtl">&#x05D7;&#x05DF;</span> (grace).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1451">(12) The reading of GRA and N.Y.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1452">(13) So M, H and N.Y. V repeats &#x2018;space&#x2019; unnecessarily.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1453">(14) Intended for study only and not for public lections.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1454">(15) So H in agreement with Men. 30a (Sonc. ed., p. 195). V and M read &#x2018;two parts of a handbreadth&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1455">(16) lit. &#x2018;here and there&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1456">(17) lit. &#x2018;between a book and a book&#x2019;. The Torah scroll consists of five books.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1457">(18) Both in the case of the major and minor Prophets (N.Y.).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1458">(19) So N.Y. V, H and M read &#x2018;books&#x2019;. The reference is either to one book of the Prophets or to several written in one scroll.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1459">(20) Cf. I, Rule 11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1460">(21) lit. &#x2018;in the beginning&#x2019;, &#x2018;at the outset&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1461">(22) Of the Prophets, having its cylinder at the end of the scroll.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1462">(23) Which has cylinders at both ends.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1463">(24) So H, M and GRA. V omits the pronoun.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1464">(25) Owing to its sanctity. It must be opened by manipulating the cylinders. Another reading for <span dir="rtl">&#x05E4;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;&#x05D7;&#x05D9;&#x05DF;</span> is <span dir="rtl">&#x05E4;&#x05D5;&#x05D7;&#x05EA;&#x05D9;&#x05DF;</span> (H, cf. N.Y.) which gives the clause the meaning that when a Torah scroll is used for reading the lection not less than a full sheet, which contains not fewer than three columns, must be kept unrolled throughout the reading.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1465">(26) lit. &#x2018;length from top to bottom&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1466">(27) The reading of H and GRA. V and M have &#x2018;in the journeys&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1467">(28) The larger the characters the fewer the number of lines in a column.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1468">(29) Num. XXXIII, 2. As the expression of writing (<italic>wrote</italic>) occurs in the same context as the journeys (<italic>goings forth</italic>), the number of lines in a <italic>written</italic> column may be the same as the number of the journeys.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1469">(30) Ex. XXXIV, 27. <italic>Write</italic> and <italic>Israel</italic> (numbering sixty myriads) occur in the same context.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1470">(31) Num. XI, 16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1471">(32) <italic>ibid.</italic> 26. The number of the elders is found in the same passage as the expression of writing (<italic>recorded</italic>, lit. &#x2018;written&#x2019;).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1472">(33) Deut. XXVIII, 58, <italic>the words of this law</italic> refers to the reproofs numbering 98 and occurs with <italic>written</italic> in the same passage.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1473">(34) N.Y. explains, &#x2018;sheets&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1474">(35) i.e. the lines in a column, or according to N.Y. the sheets, should not be so many as to leave less than three columns for the last sheet of the scroll.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1475">(36) So M. N.Y. (cf. &#x1E6C;ur Y.D. 280) explains, &#x2018;sheets&#x2019; instead of &#x2018;columns&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1476">(37) i.e. not more than three Heb. words, each of ten letters, could be written in a line. If the column is wider, the reader experiences difficulty in passing from line to line.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1477">(38) Of text. This is exclusive of the upper and lower margins. Others explain, &#x2018;sheet&#x2019;, instead of &#x2018;column&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1478">(39) So GRA. The reading of V is: &#x2018;he takes the middle course and so does it in&#x2019;, etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1479">(40) Some versions omit &#x2018;half&#x2019; twice in this paragraph which agrees with B.B. 14a (Sonc. ed., p. 67): &#x2018;A scroll of the Torah should be such that its length does not exceed its circumference nor its circumference its length [when rolled up]&#x2019;. On this reading, the paragraph deals with the size of the scroll in its entirety.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1480">(41) So Asheri (cf. N.Y.). V and H have the plural of <italic>&#x1E33;elaf</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1481">(42) GRA and others. V reads &#x2018;because&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1482">(43) GRA, H and M. According to V &#x2018;the writing&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1483">(44) By leaving a part unstitched, the liability to tear when the scroll is rolled up would be reduced. GRA reads this paragraph as follows: &#x2018;It is an oral prescription delivered to Moses at Sinai that a space should be left [unstitched] at the top and at the foot [of the sheets]. This, however, was at once qualified [by the Sages who questioned whether this was such an oral prescription or merely a rule] so that the scroll should not be torn [cf. Meg. 19b, Sonc. ed., pp. 118f]. If a Torah scroll was torn a patch may be placed on its outside&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1484">(45) The five letters <span dir="rtl">&#x05DB;&#x05F3;, &#x05DE;&#x05F3;, &#x05E0;&#x05F3;, &#x05E4;&#x05F3;, &#x05E6;&#x05F3;</span> which have a different form as finals.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1485">(46) i.e. the letters in the non-final form.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1486">(47) The final letters.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1487">(48) A final letter in the middle or at the beginning or vice versa.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1488">(49) Other than a Torah scroll.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1489">(50) So M. V reads &#x2018;but&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1490">(51) The sentence is omitted in H, his reading being &#x2018;if a scroll was torn&#x2019; instead of &#x2018;if a Torah scroll was torn&#x2019;.</ftnote>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER III</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. It is permissible to join the Torah and the Prophets in one scroll, so R. Judah; but the Sages say: The Torah and the Prophets must be written in separate scrolls.<sup><xref rid="fn1491">1</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. Between a book of the Prophets and another, one should not leave the same empty space as between two books of the Torah, but in each case the space must be that which has been prescribed for it.<sup><xref rid="fn1492">2</xref></sup> Furthermore, [a book of the Prophets]<sup><xref rid="fn1493">3</xref></sup> must begin at the top.<sup><xref rid="fn1494">4</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. A Torah scroll<sup><xref rid="fn1495">5</xref></sup> may not be made into the separate books of the Pentateuch, neither into single books nor into two or three joined together, because it is forbidden to reduce a major sanctity<sup><xref rid="fn1496">6</xref></sup> to a minor sanctity.<sup><xref rid="fn1497">7</xref></sup> From scrolls containing sections of the Pentateuch, however, it is permitted to make up a Torah scroll. When may this be done? When the measurements<sup><xref rid="fn1498">8</xref></sup> and the numbers of the lines<sup><xref rid="fn1499">9</xref></sup> are alike.</p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. It is not permissible to join together two sections of the Pentateuch or one and a half of them to form a single scroll.<sup><xref rid="fn1500">10</xref></sup> But if it was intended<sup><xref rid="fn1501">11</xref></sup> that additional scrolls be attached to them,<sup><xref rid="fn1502">12</xref></sup> it is permissible.</p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. It is related that Boethus b. Zonin<sup><xref rid="fn1503">13</xref></sup> had eight books of the Prophets<sup><xref rid="fn1504">14</xref></sup> joined together in one scroll in accordance with a ruling of R. Eleazar b. &#x2018;Azariah. Others maintain that he had them all in separate scrolls. It is also related that a certain person brought before the Sages a single scroll containing the Torah, the Prophets and the Hagiographa.<sup><xref rid="fn1505">15</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. This<sup><xref rid="fn1506">16</xref></sup> applies only to a codex,<sup><xref rid="fn1507">17</xref></sup> but in the case of a scroll<sup><xref rid="fn1508">18</xref></sup> the Torah and the Prophets must each consist of a separate parchment.</p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>. If a Torah scroll has spaces or stops [to mark] the beginning of verses, it may not be used for the lections.<sup><xref rid="fn1509">19</xref></sup> So also if a letter has been engraved or joined to another, the scroll may not be used for the lections.</p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>. A scroll [some of whose letters] are faded may not be used for the lections.<sup><xref rid="fn1510">20</xref></sup> R. Simeon b. Eleazar says: If the outline [of the effaced letters] is distinguishable, it is permitted [to rewrite them].</p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>. A scroll of the Torah in which a whole line is faded may not be used for the lections. If the greater part of a line is faded and the smaller part intact, the use of the scroll is permitted. If a Torah scroll contains an error, it may not be used for the lections. How many [errors disqualify it]? One in a column, is the view of R. Judah. R. Simeon b. Gamaliel says: Even if there be one error in three columns<sup><xref rid="fn1511">21</xref></sup> the scroll may not be used for the lections.</p>
<p><small>RULE 10</small>. Not less than three columns of the Torah scroll [may be unrolled at one time during the reading], but there is no objection to the reading of ten [columns] in one [lection]. It is a religious precept that the most important member<sup><xref rid="fn1512">22</xref></sup> shall roll up the scroll.<sup><xref rid="fn1513">23</xref></sup> When one rolls up a Torah scroll he should roll it [so that it closes] at the seam<sup><xref rid="fn1514">24</xref></sup> and not at [the middle of] a sheet.<sup><xref rid="fn1515">25</xref></sup> A Torah scroll should [36<italic>b</italic>] be rolled up<sup><xref rid="fn1516">26</xref></sup> from without,<sup><xref rid="fn1517">27</xref></sup> but the [band]<sup><xref rid="fn1518">28</xref></sup> should be tied from within.<sup><xref rid="fn1519">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>When one hands a Torah scroll to another person it must be done with the right hand only, and he who receives it must also do so with the right hand only, because the Torah was delivered at Mount Sinai in this manner, as it is stated, <italic>At His right hand was a fiery law unto them</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1520">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>R. Shefa&#x1E6D;ai<sup><xref rid="fn1521">31</xref></sup> said in the name of R. Jo&#x1E25;anan: If one reads the Scripture without a melody<sup><xref rid="fn1522">32</xref></sup> or learns the Mishnah without a tune,<sup><xref rid="fn1523">33</xref></sup> of him Scripture says, <italic>Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1524">34</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 11</small>. A scribe may not put upon the written part [of a Torah scroll] a reed-pen with ink on it; nor may he take hold of the sheets of parchment<sup><xref rid="fn1525">35</xref></sup> and thereby unroll [the scroll]; nor may he grasp them to extract the written sheets;<sup><xref rid="fn1526">36</xref></sup> nor may he remove a scroll from its [case] by shaking it out. All these [restrictions] are relaxed with the official revisers of Scripture scrolls. A Torah scroll may not be released from its case while it is lying on one&#x2019;s lap<sup><xref rid="fn1527">37</xref></sup> because this is disrespectful treatment. It is not permissible to place a Torah scroll on one&#x2019;s knees or lean on it with one&#x2019;s elbows while reading; so according to the ruling of R. Nehemiah.</p>
<p><small>RULE 12</small>. A Torah scroll may not be placed over a chair [with its sheets] hanging down while it is being read, in the manner of ordinary documents, because [sacred] books must not be treated with disrespect. The proper procedure is<sup><xref rid="fn1528">38</xref></sup> to hold it in the hands<sup><xref rid="fn1529">39</xref></sup> with reverence and so read it. [Sacred] books<sup><xref rid="fn1530">40</xref></sup> may not be thrown about<sup><xref rid="fn1531">41</xref></sup> nor may they be treated in [any other] disrespectful manner.</p>
<p><small>RULE 13</small>. A scroll of the Torah may not be placed on a bed and [certainly]<sup><xref rid="fn1532">42</xref></sup> not at its foot or under it; nor may one sit on a bed on which a [Torah] scroll [happens to] rest. It is related that R. Eleazar once sat [unwittingly] on a bed on which lay a [Torah] scroll and [when he realized it] he jumped up as if a snake had bitten him. [Respect is shown for the Torah] because Scripture states, <italic>Ye shall keep My sabbaths, and reverence My sanctuary</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1533">43</xref></sup>&#x2014;it is not the sabbaths that one reverences but Him who commanded [to keep them], nor is one to reverence the sanctuary but Him who commanded [to make] it.</p>
<p>It is obligatory to make beautiful <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic>, beautiful <italic>mezuzoth</italic>, to write a beautiful scroll of the Torah with choice ink, with a fine reed-pen [written] by an expert penman<sup><xref rid="fn1534">44</xref></sup> on well-finished parchments, on deer skins,<sup><xref rid="fn1535">45</xref></sup> and to wrap it in precious silks; for Scripture states, <italic>This is my God, and I will glorify Him</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1536">46</xref></sup> which means, perform the commandments in a beautiful manner to His glory.<sup><xref rid="fn1537">47</xref></sup> Such is the interpretation of R. Ishmael. R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba expounds the text as meaning that one should expatiate on His excellencies. Abba Saul explains: Be like Him;<sup><xref rid="fn1538">48</xref></sup> as He is merciful and gracious so be thou merciful and gracious.</p>
<p><small>RULE 14</small>. Foodstuffs may not be treated with disrespect, nor may they be thrown about. One may not sit on a basket containing dates or dried figs;<sup><xref rid="fn1539">49</xref></sup> but he may sit on a basket which contains pulse or on a cake of pressed figs, because it is customary to do so.<sup><xref rid="fn1540">50</xref></sup> Foodstuffs may not be used as a support<sup><xref rid="fn1541">51</xref></sup> or as a covering, nor may foodstuffs be eaten with the aid of foodstuffs,<sup><xref rid="fn1542">52</xref></sup> unless [the latter] are fit to be eaten.<sup><xref rid="fn1543">53</xref></sup> R. Eliezer b. Jacob says: Any fruit which has a stem or stalk<sup><xref rid="fn1544">54</xref></sup> may be used as a covering.<sup><xref rid="fn1545">55</xref></sup> R. Simeon b.

Gamaliel also says: Any foodstuff which has a protection<sup><xref rid="fn1547">57</xref></sup> may be used as a covering. One who writes [Torah] scrolls may not turn over a sheet on its face<sup><xref rid="fn1548">58</xref></sup> because this is disrespectful treatment.</p>
<p><small>RULE 15</small>. If one finished [writing nearly] all the [Torah] scroll and left over one column, there is no objection to his arranging it on a small sheet [on its own].<sup><xref rid="fn1549">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>Foodstuffs may not be used as a covering.<sup><xref rid="fn1550">60</xref></sup> R. Meir says: Any fruit which has a husk may be used as a covering. R. Judah says: Any fruit which has a stem or a stalk may be used as a covering.</p>
<p><small>RULE 16</small>. Foodstuffs may not be eaten with the aid of foodstuffs unless they are consumed simultaneously. If a scroll cannot be covered with a cloth,<sup><xref rid="fn1551">61</xref></sup> it may be turned over on its writing.<sup><xref rid="fn1552">62</xref></sup> R. Jo&#x1E25;anan said: Whoever holds a Torah scroll without a covering<sup><xref rid="fn1553">63</xref></sup> will be buried without a covering.<sup><xref rid="fn1554">64</xref></sup> Buried without a covering&#x0021; Is this thinkable?

<ftnote id="fn1491">(1) So V, H, M. GRA adopts the reading of B.B. 13b (Sonc. ed., p. 66): &#x2018;It is permissible to fasten the Torah, the Prophets and the Hagiographa [in one scroll]&#x2019;.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1494">(4) Of the next column, the reason being that, if the books of the Prophets were separated one from the other, the beginning of each book would commence at the top of a column. This does not apply to Torah scrolls which may never be cut up into separate books.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1506">(16) That the Torah, Prophets and Hagiographa may be included in one scroll.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1507">(17) Since, as a book for study, no one could attribute to it the sanctity of a Torah scroll.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1508">(18) In that form only the contents could show whether it was a Torah scroll only.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1509">(19) Because the Torah scroll must conform to the original form without any alterations.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1510">(20) So H and GRA. V reads &#x2018;one should not rewrite them&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1511">(21) The reading of GRA. In V and M, &#x2018;even three errors in a column&#x2019;. The reading of H is: &#x2018;Three in a column is the view of R. Judah. Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel says: Even if there be one error in one column&#x2019;.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1514">(24) So that if the scroll is pulled, only the seam will be affected.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1515">(25) Which might be torn by the pull.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1517">(27) i.e. the back of the written side, while the scroll is being held up by another person who is faced by the written side.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1518">(28) Which is wound around the scroll to prevent it from unrolling.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1519">(29) The knot facing the written side. In this way, when the next lection is to be read, the knot can be easily undone without having to turn the scroll over.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1520">(30) Deut. XXXIII, 2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1521">(31) In Meg. 32a (Sonc. ed., p. 194) the name is Shefa&#x1E6D;iah.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1528">(38) lit. &#x2018;but&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1529">(39) By means of a cloth since, according to Rule 16 below, it is forbidden to touch a Torah scroll with the bare hands.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER V</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. If one wrote a sacred name twice,<sup><xref rid="fn1655">1</xref></sup> he retains the first and erases the latter.<sup><xref rid="fn1656">2</xref></sup> R. Judah says: If the first occurs at the end of a column, he erases the first and retains the second.<sup><xref rid="fn1657">3</xref></sup> [If he wrote] a secular noun twice,<sup><xref rid="fn1658">4</xref></sup> he retains the first and wipes away the latter.<sup><xref rid="fn1659">5</xref></sup> R. Judah says: If the first was at the end<sup><xref rid="fn1660">6</xref></sup> of a column, he wipes away the first and retains the latter.</p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. If one writes <italic>Yehudah</italic> and omits the <italic>daleth</italic>, he inserts<sup><xref rid="fn1661">7</xref></sup> it above the line. If he intended to write the Tetragrammaton<sup><xref rid="fn1662">8</xref></sup> and wrote <italic>Yehudah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1663">9</xref></sup> instead,<sup><xref rid="fn1664">10</xref></sup> he alters the <italic>daleth</italic> into a <italic>he</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1665">11</xref></sup> and wipes away the final letter <italic>he</italic>. If it was required to write <italic>Yehudah</italic> and he intended to write the Tetragrammaton, although he [inadvertently] inserted the <italic>daleth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1666">12</xref></sup> he erases it<sup><xref rid="fn1667">13</xref></sup> and writes another <italic>Yehudah</italic>.</p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. If it was required to write the Tetragrammaton but he intended to write <italic>Yehudah</italic>, although he did not insert the <italic>daleth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1668">14</xref></sup> he must wipe away [the entire word] and re-write the Tetragrammaton. R. Judah says: He should go over it with the reed-pen and so sanctify it. [The Sages] said to him: This is not the best procedure.</p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. He who writes the divine name and made an error [by omitting] one letter should suspend it above [the line].<sup><xref rid="fn1669">15</xref></sup> R. Simeon of Shezur says: All the name may be suspended [if omitted] but a single letter of it may not be suspended. If one erred [by omitting] all the name, he should suspend it between the lines, according to the view of R. Judah. R. Meir says: He wipes away the writing that precedes and writes the name on the part which he wiped away. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said in the name of R. Meir: The name only may be suspended but the Tetragrammaton must not be written on an erasure. R. &#x1E24;anina b. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;abia says: The whole sheet<sup><xref rid="fn1670">16</xref></sup> must be stored away.<sup><xref rid="fn1671">17</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. If one wrote three<sup><xref rid="fn1672">18</xref></sup> times <italic>Alef-lamed</italic> by mistake in the phrase <italic>God delivereth me to the ungodly</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1673">19</xref></sup> he retains the first and erases the second.<sup><xref rid="fn1674">20</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. When one is writing the Tetragrammaton he may not respond even if the king greets him.<sup><xref rid="fn1675">21</xref></sup> If he was about to write two or three divine names successively,<sup><xref rid="fn1676">22</xref></sup> he may pause between them and respond. After dipping the reed-pen in ink, he may not start with the letters of a divine name<sup><xref rid="fn1677">23</xref></sup> but with the preceding letter.<sup><xref rid="fn1678">24</xref></sup> One who erases a single letter of a divine name transgresses a negative commandment. R. Simeon said:<sup><xref rid="fn1679">25</xref></sup> On account of this it is stated, <italic>Ye shall destroy their name out of that place. Ye shall not do so unto the Lord your God</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1680">26</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>. It is permissible, however, to wipe away ink that dropped upon the writing,<sup><xref rid="fn1681">27</xref></sup> since one&#x2019;s intention is only to rectify it.</p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>. If one omits a line in error, he may not suspend it between the lines, but inserts it in close proximity<sup><xref rid="fn1682">28</xref></sup> to the place<sup><xref rid="fn1683">29</xref></sup> of the error by erasing one [adjacent line] and inserting two<sup><xref rid="fn1684">30</xref></sup> in its place, or [by erasing] two lines and writing three;<sup><xref rid="fn1685">31</xref></sup> provided only that he does not erase three lines.<sup><xref rid="fn1686">32</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>. It is not permissible to make a scroll of the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic> or of the <italic>Hallel</italic> for children,<sup><xref rid="fn1687">33</xref></sup> but if the scribe intends to add to it, it is permissible.<sup><xref rid="fn1688">34</xref></sup> R. Judah permits the writing of a scroll from <italic>In the beginning</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1689">35</xref></sup> to the story of the flood,<sup><xref rid="fn1690">36</xref></sup> and from the beginning of Leviticus to <italic>And it came to pass on the eighth day;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1691">37</xref></sup> but in the case of all the other books [of Scripture the writing of extracts is] forbidden.<sup><xref rid="fn1692">38</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 10</small>. The following names are to be divided:<sup><xref rid="fn1693">39</xref></sup> Beth-el,<sup><xref rid="fn1694">40</xref></sup> Beth-&#x2019;awen,<sup><xref rid="fn1695">41</xref></sup> Beer-sheba,<sup><xref rid="fn1696">42</xref></sup> &#x1E92;ofenath-pa&#x2019;nea&#x1E25;, [37<italic>b</italic>] Po&#x1E6D;i-fera,<sup><xref rid="fn1697">43</xref></sup> Ben-&#x2019;oni,<sup><xref rid="fn1698">44</xref></sup> Yedid-yah,<sup><xref rid="fn1699">45</xref></sup> Halelu-yah.<sup><xref rid="fn1700">46</xref></sup> R. Jose says: These must not be divided.<sup><xref rid="fn1701">47</xref></sup> All, however, agree that there must be no breaking up of &#x2018;Ammi&#x2019;el,<sup><xref rid="fn1702">48</xref></sup> &#x2018;Amminadab,<sup><xref rid="fn1703">49</xref></sup> &#x1E92;uri&#x2019;el,<sup><xref rid="fn1704">50</xref></sup> &#x1E92;urishaddai.<sup><xref rid="fn1705">51</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 11</small>. The following names may not be broken up: Yisra&#x2019;el, Ga&#x2019;tham,<sup><xref rid="fn1706">52</xref></sup> Po&#x1E6D;ifar, Nebukadne&#x1E93;&#x1E93;ar.<sup><xref rid="fn1707">53</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 12</small>. If a person writes a divine name on his body, he must neither bathe nor anoint himself<sup><xref rid="fn1708">54</xref></sup> (nor stand in an unclean place.<sup><xref rid="fn1709">55</xref></sup> If he must perform an obligatory immersion,<sup><xref rid="fn1710">56</xref></sup> he should wind a reed about it,<sup><xref rid="fn1711">57</xref></sup> descend and perform an immersion. R. Jose said: He may at all times descend and perform an immersion in the ordinary way)<sup><xref rid="fn1712">58</xref></sup> provided he does not rub it off.</p>
<p><small>RULE 13</small>. [If one wrote a divine name] on the horn of a cow or on the legs of a bed,<sup><xref rid="fn1713">59</xref></sup> he scrapes it off<sup><xref rid="fn1714">60</xref></sup> and stores it away. [If he wrote it] on a stone, he detaches it and stores it away.<sup><xref rid="fn1715">61</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 14</small>. If the seam of a sacred scroll was broken for the first time,<sup><xref rid="fn1716">62</xref></sup> it may be sewn up again;<sup><xref rid="fn1717">63</xref></sup> if a second time, it may be sewn up again; if a third time, it must not be sewn up again.<sup><xref rid="fn1718">64</xref></sup> If one cuts off a strip of a new scroll,<sup><xref rid="fn1719">65</xref></sup> it may [be used for ordinary purposes],<sup><xref rid="fn1720">66</xref></sup> but if it is cut off an old scroll,<sup><xref rid="fn1721">67</xref></sup> [its use is] forbidden. Worn-out scrolls, phylacteries and wraps of scrolls must be stored away.<sup><xref rid="fn1722">68</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 15</small>. It is related of R. &#x1E24;alafta that, when he visited Rabban Gamaliel, he found him sitting at his table with the Targum of Job<sup><xref rid="fn1723">69</xref></sup> in his hand and reading it. He said to him, &#x2018;Master, will you permit me to tell you what my eyes saw?&#x2019; &#x2018;Tell me,&#x2019; he replied. &#x2018;I was watching Rabban Gamaliel the Elder, your father&#x2019;s<sup><xref rid="fn1724">70</xref></sup> father, while he was sitting at the side of a building [in course of construction] on the Temple Mount, when a Targum of Job was brought to him. &#x201C;Remove a course of stones,&#x201D; he ordered the builder,<sup><xref rid="fn1725">71</xref></sup> &#x201C;and bury this under it.&#x201D; &#x2019; R. Jose b. R. Judah said: They overturned a tub of mortar upon it.<sup><xref rid="fn1726">72</xref></sup> Rabbi said: There are two objections to the statement&#x2014;firstly, how could mortar<sup><xref rid="fn1727">73</xref></sup> be available on the Temple Mount?<sup><xref rid="fn1728">74</xref></sup> Further, it is not permissible to destroy such writings<sup><xref rid="fn1729">75</xref></sup> with one&#x2019;s own hands&#x0021; [They should not be deposited in an unclean place] but in a deserted spot where they decay of their own accord.<sup><xref rid="fn1730">76</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 16</small>. If one lends a Torah scroll to his friend, the latter may not lend it to another person. If one deposits a Torah scroll with his friend, the latter must unroll it once in twelve months.<sup><xref rid="fn1731">77</xref></sup> If he is capable of reading it, he may do so,<sup><xref rid="fn1732">78</xref></sup> but if he unrolled it for his own benefit,<sup><xref rid="fn1733">79</xref></sup> reading it is forbidden. Symmachos said: He unrolls a new scroll once in thirty days and an old one once in twelve months. R. Eliezer b. Jacob says:<sup><xref rid="fn1734">80</xref></sup> Both a new and an old scroll [should be unrolled] once in twelve months.<sup><xref rid="fn1735">81</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 17</small>. All occurrences of the name Solomon in the Song of Songs are sacred<sup><xref rid="fn1736">82</xref></sup> except one which is secular.

<ftnote id="fn1661">(7) lit. &#x2018;suspends&#x2019; between the <italic>waw</italic> and the <italic>he</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1662">(8) The four letters <italic>Yod-he-waw-he</italic>, lit. &#x2018;the name&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1663">(9) <span dir="rtl">&#x05D9;&#x05D4;&#x05D5;&#x05D3;&#x05D4;</span>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1664">(10) This is the reading of GRA and H. V omits &#x2018;if he intended to write&#x2019;,</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1665">(11) This is done by adding a short vertical line to the <italic>daleth</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1666">(12) So H. V reads: &#x2018;he did not write in it&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1667">(13) Following GRA. V and H &#x2018;detains it&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1668">(14) So that the Tetragrammaton was written correctly but unintentionally so.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1669">(15) Neither erasure nor wiping away of the written words is necessary.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1670">(16) In which the omission of the Tetragrammaton had occurred.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1671">(17) As with all sacred objects that are worn out or decaying, or are for any other reason unfit for further use. GRA revised the wording of this Rule to conform in the main with the text in Men. 30b (Sonc. ed., p. 196): &#x2018;If the Tetragrammaton was omitted in error [and a number of the words following it already written], what had been written is erased, the erased words are suspended [above the line] and the Tetragrammaton is inserted in the space of the erasure; so R. Judah. R. Meir said: He wipes the writing away and writes [the Tetragrammaton] in the space. R. Jose said: Even the Tetragrammaton may be suspended [above the line]. R. Simeon of Shezur said: It is permissible to suspend all the Tetragrammaton [above the line] but not a part of it. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said in the name of R. Meir: The Tetragrammaton may not be written in a space which has been erased or wiped away, nor may it be suspended [above the line]; but the entire sheet is removed and stored away&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1672">(18) So GRA. V &#x2018;twice&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1673">(19) Job XVI, 11. The text has the word twice, the first being the divine name and the second the preposition; inadvertently he wrote it three times, intending the first two to stand for &#x2018;God&#x2019; (thus sanctifying both) and the third for &#x2018;to&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1674">(20) So GRA and H. The first occurrences of <italic>&#x2019;el</italic> were meant to be the divine name and Rule 1 above applies. By quoting an illustration from Job, the inference to be drawn is that the regulation with respect to a Torah scroll holds good also of the Prophets and Hagiographa.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1675">(21) All his attention must be concentrated on the sanctity of the divine name.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1676">(22) E.g. <italic>The Lord, the Lord, God</italic> in Ex. XXXIV, 6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1677">(23) Because a pen full of ink may cause a blot.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1678">(24) Which, if blotted, can be erased or wiped away.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1679">(25) Citing the Scriptural basis of the regulation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1680">(26) Deut. XII, 3f, i.e. the name of God must not be erased.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1681">(27) Even of a divine name.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1682">(28) lit. &#x2018;opposite&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1683">(29) So GRA. V and H omit &#x2018;inserts in &#x2026; place of&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1684">(30) The one omitted and the one erased.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1685">(31) The two erased and the one omitted.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1686">(32) In order to insert more than one missing line. The erasure of one or two lines is sufficient for the insertion of the omitted line without undue pressure on the space between the lines; but the treatment of more than one line in this manner would disfigure the entire column (N.Y.).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1687">(33) Extracts from Scripture may not be made for study by children.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1688">(34) From &#x2018;but if&#x2019; to &#x2018;permissible&#x2019; is an addition by GRA.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1689">(35) Gen. I, 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1690">(36) i.e. to Gen. VI, 8. In each instance the extract is a connected theme.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1691">(37) Lev. IX, 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1692">(38) Only in the case of the Pentateuch were the two extracts mentioned allowed to be written for the instruction of children. V adds here, &#x2018;if he intends to add to it, it is permitted&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1693">(39) Although each represents one name, it is to be written as two words.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1694">(40) e.g. Gen. XII, 8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1695">(41) Hos. IV, 15, X, 15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1696">(42) E.g. Gen. XXI, 31.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1697">(43) <italic>ibid.</italic> XLI, 45. E.V. <italic>Zaphenathpaneah</italic> and <italic>Poti-phera</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1698">(44) <italic>ibid.</italic> XXXV, 18.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1699">(45) 2 Sam. XII, 25. E.V. <italic>Jedidiah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1700">(46) E.g. Ps. CXI, 1, &#x2018;praise ye the Lord&#x2019;. E.V. prints it as one word. V and H add: <span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05D7;&#x05E8;&#x05D4; &#x05D0;&#x05E3; &#x05D5;&#x05D7;&#x05E8;&#x05D4; &#x05D0;&#x05E4;&#x05D9;</span>, <italic>and the anger</italic> [<italic>of the Lord</italic>] <italic>was kindled, My wrath shall wax hot</italic> (Ex. XXII, 23; Num. XI, 10).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1701">(47) But written as one word.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1702">(48) A name meaning &#x2018;God is with me&#x2019; (e.g. Num. XIII, 12). Another reading is <span dir="rtl">&#x05E2;&#x05D6;&#x05D9;&#x05D0;&#x05DC;</span>, &#x2018;God is my strength&#x2019; (e.g. Ex. VI, 18).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1703">(49) A name meaning &#x2018;my kinsman is noble&#x2019; (e.g. <italic>ibid.</italic> 23).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1704">(50) A name meaning &#x2018;my Rock is God&#x2019; (Num. III, 35).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1705">(51) A name meaning &#x2018;my Rock is Shaddai&#x2019; (cf. Num. I, 6).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1706">(52) A name occurring in Gen. XXXVI, 11, 16, 1 Chron. I, 36. E.V. <italic>Gatam</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1707">(53) V and H unnecessarily repeat <span dir="rtl">&#x05E6;&#x05DE;&#x05D9;&#x05D0;&#x05DC;, &#x05E2;&#x05D5;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05D0;&#x05DC;, &#x05E6;&#x05D5;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05E9;&#x05D3;&#x05D9;</span>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1708">(54) So that the name be not washed away.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1709">(55) Out of respect.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1710">(56) As, e.g., after a period of ritual impurity.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1711">(57) To prevent the name from coming into contact with the water which might wash it away.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1712">(58) The words in brackets are inserted by GRA who follows Shab. 120b (Sonc. ed., p. 597). V and H read: R. Jose permits, provided, etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1713">(59) For magical purposes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1714">(60) [The correct reading is perhaps <span dir="rtl">&#x05D2;&#x05D5;&#x05D3;&#x05D3;&#x05D3;</span> for <span dir="rtl">&#x05D2;&#x05D5;&#x05E8;&#x05E8;&#x05D3;</span>, &#x2018;he chops off (the horn or leg)&#x2019;.]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1715">(61) From respect for the divine name.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1716">(62) lit. &#x2018;one&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1717">(63) On the undamaged part of the sheet, near the writing, although the margins between the columns are thereby reduced.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1718">(64) Because the margins would become too small.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1719">(65) lit. &#x2018;scrolls&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1720">(66) Being new, the scroll had not yet been consecrated.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1721">(67) Which has been consecrated by the script.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1722">(68) Having once been consecrated, they may no longer be used for ordinary purposes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1723">(69) This must have been an earlier work than the extant Targum. [The anecdote is related in Shab. 115a (Sonc. ed., p. 565) with some variants.]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1724">(70) V rightly corrects &#x2018;mother&#x2019;s&#x2019; to &#x2018;father&#x2019;s&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1725">(71) V incorrectly &#x2018;his children&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1726">(72) This sentence is added by GRA from Shab. 115a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1727">(73) Which is composed of earth and water.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1728">(74) Where only a mixture of sand and lime was used.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1729">(75) Books like the Targum of Job whose use was forbidden on account of their exclusion from the Canon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1730">(76) The objection to a written, as against an oral, Targum at the time was the fear that the same sanctity might be attached to it as to the Hebrew text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1731">(77) This sentence is inserted by GRA following B.M. 29b (Sonc. ed., p. 182).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1732">(78) While the scroll is being unrolled in accordance with this Rule.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1733">(79) So corrected by GRA.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1734">(80) From &#x2018;and an old&#x2019; to &#x2018;says&#x2019; is added by GRA from B.M. 29b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1735">(81) In the course of the discussion in B.M. 29b this is amended to &#x2018;thirty days&#x2019; to differentiate the opinion of R. Eliezer from that of the first authority who is quoted above.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1736">(82) Referring to God in the Rabbinical interpretation of the Book.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1737">(83) Cant. III, 7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1738">(84) <italic>ibid.</italic> VIII, 12.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1739">(85) Understood as referring to God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1740">(86) Dan. II, 37. E.V. <italic>O king, king of kings, unto whom</italic>, etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1741">(87) Interpreted as an invocation to God in Shebu. 35b (Sonc. ed., p. 207).</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER VI</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. A scribe must provide a distinguishing mark<sup><xref rid="fn1743">1</xref></sup> for the section<sup><xref rid="fn1744">2</xref></sup> beginning <italic>And it came to pass when the ark set forward</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1745">3</xref></sup> both at its beginning and at its end, because it is a book on its own.

<p><small>RULE 2</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn1747">5</xref></sup> The scribe must leave a prescribed space at the opening of the section which begins <italic>And the people were as murmurers;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1748">6</xref></sup> [and not only] at its beginning [but also] at its end, because it is a book on its own. Others hold that its proper place is in the section of the setting forward of the standards.</p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. Ten [letters or groups of letters] in the Torah are marked by dots:<sup><xref rid="fn1749">7</xref></sup> In <italic>the Lord judge between me and thee</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1750">8</xref></sup> there is a dot on the <italic>beth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1751">9</xref></sup> of <italic>ubeneka</italic> (and between thee).

In <italic>and kissed him</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1754">12</xref></sup> the entire word <italic>wayyishsha&#x1E33;ehu</italic> is marked by dots. In <italic>and his brethren went to feed their father&#x2019;s flock</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1755">13</xref></sup> the letters of <italic>&#x2019;eth</italic> (the mark of the defined accusative) are dotted.

In <italic>the secret things belong unto the Lord our God; but the things that are revealed belong unto us and to our children for</italic> ever,<sup><xref rid="fn1760">18</xref></sup> the <italic>&#x2018;ayin</italic> in <italic>&#x2018;ad</italic> (for) has a dot.</p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. R. Simeon b. La&#x1E33;ish said: Three scrolls of the Torah were found in the Temple court:<sup><xref rid="fn1761">19</xref></sup> the <italic>Ma&#x2018;on</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1762">20</xref></sup> scroll, the <italic>Za&#x2019;a&#x1E6D;u&#x1E6D;&#x00EB;</italic> scroll, and the <italic>Hu&#x2019;</italic> scroll. In one of these they found the expression of <italic>ma&#x2018;on</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1763">21</xref></sup> and in the other two it was written, <italic>The eternal God is me&#x2018;onah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1764">22</xref></sup> (a dwelling place), so they adopted the reading of the two scrolls and discarded that of the one scroll. In another of the scrolls they found it written, <italic>And he sent the za&#x2018;a&#x1E6D;u&#x1E6D;&#x00EB;</italic> (nobles) <italic>of the children of Israel</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1765">23</xref></sup> and in the other two they found written <italic>And he sent na&#x2018;ar&#x00EB;</italic> (the young men of) <italic>the children of Israel</italic>, so they retained the reading of the two and abandoned that of the one. In one of the scrolls <italic>hu</italic>&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1766">24</xref></sup> was written eleven times, but in the other two <italic>hi</italic>&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn1767">25</xref></sup> was written eleven times, so they adopted the reading of the two and discarded that of the one.</p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. Three expressions of <italic>lo&#x2019;</italic> are written <italic>lamed-alef</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1768">26</xref></sup> but read as <italic>lamed-waw</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1769">27</xref></sup> They are: <italic>&#x2019;asher lo&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1770">28</xref></sup> <italic>jointed legs above their feet;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1771">29</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2019;asher lo&#x2019; &#x1E25;omah;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1772">30</xref></sup> and <italic>&#x2019;asher lo&#x2019; ye&#x2018;adah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn1773">31</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. The following [occurrences of <italic>lamed-alef</italic> (not)] which have to be read as <italic>lamed-waw</italic> (to, by, has) are found in the Prophets and Hagiographa: <italic>multiply;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1774">32</xref></sup> <italic>Hushai;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1775">33</xref></sup> <italic>said;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1776">34</xref></sup> <italic>thou hast multiplied;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1777">35</xref></sup> <italic>their affliction;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1778">36</xref></sup> <italic>He slay me;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1779">37</xref></sup> <italic>I keep silence;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1780">38</xref></sup> <italic>as the</italic> (<italic>wandering</italic>) <italic>sparrow;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1781">39</xref></sup> <italic>his friends;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1782">40</xref></sup> <italic>Zerubbabel;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1783">41</xref></sup> <italic>were fashioned;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1784">42</xref></sup> <italic>know ye;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1785">43</xref></sup> <italic>be gathered;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn1786">44</xref></sup> <italic>name</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn1787">45</xref></sup> [this last also] in the corresponding passage.<sup><xref rid="fn1788">46</xref></sup> [38<italic>a</italic>]</p>

<ftnote id="fn1743">(1) The traditional mark is an inverted <italic>nun</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1744">(2) So GRA. V reads &#x2018;a prescribed space at the opening&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1745">(3) Num. X, 35. The section consists of the two verses, <italic>ibid.</italic> 35f.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1746">(4) Num. II.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1747">(5) This Rule is partly a repetition of the preceding, since the end of the section, <italic>ibid.</italic> X, 35f, is followed by the beginning of <italic>And the people were as murmurers</italic> (<italic>ibid.</italic> XI, 1); and partly incorrect since no mark is inserted at the end of the latter section. The entire Rule is to be deleted according to GRA.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1748">(6) <italic>ibid.</italic> XI, 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1749">(7) The dots are placed above the letters. Cf. above, ARN XXXIV, p. 165 where the Rabbinical explanations are given.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn1761">(19) Presumably when the text of Scripture was about to be fixed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn1762">(20) So GRA. V has <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05E2;&#x05E0;&#x05D4;</span>. This and the following two names were derived from the peculiar word which distinguished each scroll.</ftnote>

<p><small>RULE 1</small>. Moses<sup><xref rid="fn2181">1</xref></sup> warned<sup><xref rid="fn2182">2</xref></sup> Israel that they should read out of the Torah<sup><xref rid="fn2183">3</xref></sup> on Sabbaths, Festivals, New Moons and the intermediate days of the Festivals;<sup><xref rid="fn2184">4</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the appointed seasons of the Lord</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2185">5</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. Ezra ordained for Israel that they should read in the Torah on Mondays and Thursdays and in the afternoon service on the Sabbath.<sup><xref rid="fn2186">6</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. There is no difference between a Festival and the Sabbath<sup><xref rid="fn2187">7</xref></sup> save only in the matter of preparing food.<sup><xref rid="fn2188">8</xref></sup> There is no difference between the Sabbath and the Day of Atonement save only that a wilful violation of the former [is punishable] by men<sup><xref rid="fn2189">9</xref></sup> while a wilful violation of the latter [is punished] by <italic>kareth</italic>.</p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. R. Judah said: At the place [in the Torah] where we leave off on the Sabbath morning we begin to read at the afternoon service, and on the following Monday, Thursday and Sabbath.</p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. On Mondays and Thursdays<sup><xref rid="fn2190">10</xref></sup> and at the Sabbath afternoon service three men read [from the Torah].<sup><xref rid="fn2191">11</xref></sup> Their number must be neither reduced nor increased; nor is a <italic>haf&#x1E6D;arah</italic> read from [a book of] a Prophet. He who begins as well as he who concludes [the reading of the prescribed section of] the Torah recites the appropriate benedictions before and after his reading.<sup><xref rid="fn2192">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>On the New Moon and during the intermediate days of a Festival, four [persons read from the Torah]. Their number must be neither reduced nor increased. This is the general rule: On any day which has a <italic>musaf</italic> and is not a Festival, four persons read [from the Torah].</p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. On a Festival five [persons read from the prescribed portion of the Torah]; on the Day of Atonement, six; and on the Sabbath, seven. The number must not be reduced but may be increased. On a Festival, for the violation of which only a negative precept is infringed, five persons [read in the Torah]; on the Day of Atonement, for the violation of which <italic>kareth</italic> is incurred, six; on the Sabbath, the violation of which is punishable by stoning, seven; and one concludes with [a reading from a book of] a Prophet.</p>
<p>The one who begins as well as the one who concludes [the lection] recites the benediction before and after his reading.</p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>. The accompanying benedictions of the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2193">13</xref></sup> may not be repeated<sup><xref rid="fn2194">14</xref></sup> in congregational prayer, irrespective of whether they are said standing<sup><xref rid="fn2195">15</xref></sup> or sitting;<sup><xref rid="fn2196">16</xref></sup> nor may one act as reader in public worship;<sup><xref rid="fn2197">17</xref></sup> nor may [the <italic>kohanim</italic>] lift their hands;<sup><xref rid="fn2198">18</xref></sup> nor may the <italic>haf&#x1E6D;arah</italic> be read from the Prophet;<sup><xref rid="fn2199">19</xref></sup> nor may halts<sup><xref rid="fn2200">20</xref></sup> be made [at funerals]<sup><xref rid="fn2201">21</xref></sup> for men, how much less for women since no halts are made for women; nor may <italic>&#x1E33;addish</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2202">22</xref></sup> and <italic>bareku</italic> be said<sup><xref rid="fn2203">23</xref></sup>&#x2014;if less than ten adult males<sup><xref rid="fn2204">24</xref></sup> are present.</p>
<p>Our teachers in the West<sup><xref rid="fn2205">25</xref></sup> rule that seven [adult males<sup><xref rid="fn2206">26</xref></sup> are sufficient]<sup><xref rid="fn2207">27</xref></sup> and, as a reason for their ruling, they quote, <italic>When men let grow their hair in Israel, when the people offer themselves willingly, bless ye the Lord</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2208">28</xref></sup> [which implies that the number present must be the same] as that of the [Hebrew] words.<sup><xref rid="fn2209">29</xref></sup> Others hold that even six [adult males are sufficient for the purpose, since up to] <italic>bareku</italic> [the number of words] is six.</p>
<p>Furthermore, where there are nine or ten persons who have heard either <italic>bareku</italic> or <italic>&#x1E33;addish</italic> and, after the service, one of them [who missed one of the benedictions] said <italic>bareku</italic> or <italic>&#x1E33;addish</italic>, he has thereby performed [the duty of public worship].<sup><xref rid="fn2210">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Sages long ago issued an ordinance to Synagogue precentors to say after the prayer for redemption,<sup><xref rid="fn2211">31</xref></sup> <italic>Blessed be the name of the Lord from this time forth and for ever</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2212">32</xref></sup> and after that, &#x2018;Bless ye the Lord Who is to be blessed&#x2019;,<sup><xref rid="fn2213">33</xref></sup> so as to enable those who had not heard the benedictions<sup><xref rid="fn2214">34</xref></sup> to perform the duty of public worship; for R. Jo&#x1E25;anan said: Would that a man read his prayers all the day long.<sup><xref rid="fn2215">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>The congregations of the West and the congregations of the East<sup><xref rid="fn2216">36</xref></sup> have a custom to say it<sup><xref rid="fn2217">37</xref></sup> after &#x2018;He Who maketh peace&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn2218">38</xref></sup> in the three statutory prayers<sup><xref rid="fn2219">39</xref></sup> of the Eighteen Benedictions,<sup><xref rid="fn2220">40</xref></sup> as a provision for the benefit of those who arrived late and for those who leave early.<sup><xref rid="fn2221">41</xref></sup> [The verse from Psalms with the benedictions is also said] even after the public reading from the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn2222">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>As regards the redemption of land,<sup><xref rid="fn2223">43</xref></sup> however, [the presence is required of] nine male adults and a <italic>kohen</italic>; and the same law applies to the redemption of a human being.<sup><xref rid="fn2224">44</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn2181">(1) In V and H a passage has been interpolated after &#x2018;Moses&#x2019; which has no relation to the subject-matter. It seems to have been originally a marginal note explanatory of the meaning of <italic>hi&#x1E33;ni</italic>&#x2019;, an unusual verb to be employed in the sense of &#x2018;warn&#x2019;. It reads as follows: <italic>Hi&#x1E33;ni</italic>&#x2019;, i.e. &#x2018;he warned&#x2019;, as we have learned in a Mishnah (So&#x1E6D;. I, 1), <italic>hamme&#x1E33;ann&#x00EB;&#x2019;</italic> (of the same root as <italic>hi&#x1E33;ni&#x2019;</italic> which means), If [a husband] &#x2018;warns&#x2019; his wife [not to associate with a certain man], R. Eliezer said: His warning is valid if it was given in the presence of two witnesses, though he makes her drink [the water of bitterness] on the evidence of one witness [who saw that she had secluded herself with the man after she had been given due warning], because a warning is not valid if given in the presence of less than two witnesses; for [only where there are two witnesses] would she be able to plead, &#x2018;I was not warned&#x2019;, but when [there was only] one witness she might dare to plead, &#x2018;I was not warned&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2182">(2) For <italic>hi&#x1E33;ni&#x2019;</italic> some eds. read the normal verb <italic>hith&#x1E33;in</italic>, &#x2018;he established a custom, ordained&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2183">(3) In the service of the Synagogue.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2184">(4) lit. &#x2018;the secular [part] of the Festival&#x2019;, the days intervening between the holy days which begin and end the Festivals of Passover and Tabernacles.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2185">(5) Lev. XXIII, 44.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2186">(6) [For this and other ordinances of Ezra, cf. B.&#x1E32;. 82a (Sonc. ed., p. 466) where the reason is given for these additional lections.]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2187">(7) In regard to forbidden work.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2188">(8) lit. &#x2018;food of a person&#x2019;. On a Festival, but not when it falls on the Sabbath, the preparation of food for the day by cooking is permitted.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2189">(9) i.e. a court of law.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2190">(10) During the morning service.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2191">(11) The first of the seven portions into which the weekly <italic>sidra&#x2019;</italic> or section is divided for the Sabbath lection. On the specified occasions it is subdivided between three worshippers.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2192">(12) For the benedictions, cf. P.B., p. 68.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2193">(13) These are the <italic>&#x1E33;addish, bareku</italic> and <italic>yo&#x1E93;er &#x2019;or</italic> (P.B., pp. 37ff) which precede the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic>, and the three benedictions of the <italic>&#x2018;Amidah</italic> which follow it (P.B., pp. 44ff) including the <italic>&#x1E33;edushshah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2194">(14) lit. &#x2018;they must not break off in connection with the <italic>Shema&#x2018; &#x2019;</italic>. The ruling applies to persons who had read the morning prayers in private and now wish to join in congregational worship. They do not repeat all the statutory morning prayers, but may repeat &#x2018;broken off&#x2019; parts, viz. those specified in the preceding note (cf. N.Y. and Rashi to Meg. 23b). For other interpretations, cf. Meg. (Sonc. ed., p. 141, n. 1) [and J. Rabbinowitz, <italic>Mishnah Megillah</italic>, pp. 114ff].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2195">(15) i.e. the benedictions which follow the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic> said while the worshippers are standing.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2196">(16) The benedictions which precede the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic> said while the worshippers are sitting.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2197">(17) In connection with any part of the prayers. Lit. &#x2018;they do not pass before the [reading] chest&#x2019;, to lead the congregation in the conduct of the service.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2198">(18) To bless the people during the service; cf. P.B., p. 238a.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2199">(19) As is the law in regard to the Torah itself; cf. Meg. 23b (Sonc. ed., p. 141).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2200">(20) lit. &#x2018;a standing and a sitting&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2201">(21) It was customary, when returning from a burial, to halt and sit seven times to praise and lament the dead.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2202">(22) P.B., p. 37.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2203">(23) Even without the other statutory prayers.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2204">(24) Who have attained their thirteenth birthday.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2205">(25) The land of Israel which was west of Babylon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2206">(26) Who have not heard one of the benedictions indicated above.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2207">(27) For the purpose of repeating the benedictions.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2208">(28) Judg. V, 2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2209">(29) Because the verse contains the word <italic>bareku</italic> (<italic>bless ye</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2210">(30) Contrary to the ruling of the Rabbis of the West and the others who hold that seven or even six are enough.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2211">(31) &#x2018;O Rock of Israel,&#x2019; etc. (P.B., p. 44).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2212">(32) Ps. CXIII, 2.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2213">(33) <italic>Bareku</italic>, etc. (P.B., p. 37).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2214">(34) Owing to their late arrival.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2215">(35) Therefore it is permissible for the precentor to repeat the benedictions under discussion more than once for the benefit of those who did not hear him when he first read them.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2216">(36) The land of Israel and Babylon respectively.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2217">(37) The verse from Psalms followed by the benedictions mentioned.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2218">(38) P.B., p. 54, forming the conclusion of the <italic>&#x2018;Amidah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2219">(39) For the evening, morning and afternoon. This custom is contrary to the previous opinion which permits an interruption between the prayer for redemption and the <italic>&#x2018;Amidah</italic> which immediately follows it. The originators of the custom forbid such an interruption.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2220">(40) The actual number is nineteen, but it was eighteen when originally instituted.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2221">(41) It is for their benefit that the repetition is not made at the end of the entire service.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2222">(42) If persons came in as late as that.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER XI</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. One who reads the Torah [in public worship] should read not less than three verses,<sup><xref rid="fn2225">1</xref></sup> and he should not read for the interpreter<sup><xref rid="fn2226">2</xref></sup> more than one verse [at a time].<sup><xref rid="fn2227">3</xref></sup> In the case of [the lection from] a Prophet, however, three [verses at a time may be read];<sup><xref rid="fn2228">4</xref></sup> but if the three verses constituted three different paragraphs, he may read one verse at a time<sup><xref rid="fn2229">5</xref></sup>&#x2014;for instance, <italic>For thus saith the Lord; Ye were sold for nought</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2230">6</xref></sup> &#x2026; [39<italic>b</italic>] <italic>For thus saith the Lord God: My people went down aforetime into Egypt</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2231">7</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2026; Now, therefore, what do I here, saith the Lord</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2232">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a city where only one person is able to read [from the Torah scroll] he reads all<sup><xref rid="fn2233">9</xref></sup> the prescribed sections, provided he sits down between the reading of one section and the next.<sup><xref rid="fn2234">10</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. It is permitted to skip from place to place in [a scroll of] a Prophet,<sup><xref rid="fn2235">11</xref></sup> but not in a Torah scroll, because [the scroll of] a Prophet may be unrolled in public but not of the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn2236">12</xref></sup> Similarly ruled R.

Jose gave the following instruction to Bar<sup><xref rid="fn2248">24</xref></sup> &#x2018;Ula, the precentor of the Babylonian Synagogue [in Sepphoris]:<sup><xref rid="fn2249">25</xref></sup> When only one Torah scroll is available the unrolling<sup><xref rid="fn2250">26</xref></sup> should be done in front of the ark curtain,<sup><xref rid="fn2251">27</xref></sup> but when two scrolls are available you should carry the first [back to the ark] and then take out the other.<sup><xref rid="fn2252">28</xref></sup> To what extent [is skipping in the Torah permitted]? R. Jose said: As, for instance, the sections<sup><xref rid="fn2253">29</xref></sup> [read on the Day of Atonement] by the High Priest.<sup><xref rid="fn2254">30</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. If the precentor read in the Torah on a Sabbath for less than seven persons,<sup><xref rid="fn2255">31</xref></sup> having forgotten and thought that he had already read for<sup><xref rid="fn2256">32</xref></sup> seven persons, he should read again completing the number of seven, and call up an eighth as <italic>maf&#x1E6D;ir;</italic> provided always that the lection<sup><xref rid="fn2257">33</xref></sup> consists of [a minimum of] twenty-one verses and allows three verses for each of the seven persons who are called up. And if a section consists of less [than three verses for each of the seven persons]<sup><xref rid="fn2258">34</xref></sup> an addition should be made to the section from the one following it.<sup><xref rid="fn2259">35</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. If a section consisted of four or five verses, he reads the whole of it, but with a section of six verses he may read and make a break<sup><xref rid="fn2260">36</xref></sup> because it has the [minimum] length for two readings. If on a Monday or Thursday, or the Sabbath afternoon service or the afternoon service of Festivals<sup><xref rid="fn2261">37</xref></sup> less than ten verses<sup><xref rid="fn2262">38</xref></sup> were read, he should repeat the reading to complete ten verses. From where [in the Torah] does one read in the afternoon service of a Festival [when it occurs on a Sabbath]?<sup><xref rid="fn2263">39</xref></sup> In the regular order where [the Torah reading] was interrupted before the Festival.<sup><xref rid="fn2264">40</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. If in the course of public reading he skipped a verse and omitted to read it, should he have read ten verses exclusive<sup><xref rid="fn2265">41</xref></sup> of the verse skipped, he need not go back; but if less than<sup><xref rid="fn2266">42</xref></sup> ten, he must go back and read ten verses in correct order so that none is left out. This is the case with [the reading of] a week-day,<sup><xref rid="fn2267">43</xref></sup> Sabbath afternoon and Festival afternoon;<sup><xref rid="fn2268">44</xref></sup> but on a Sabbath [morning] if he forgot and passed over a verse and then realized [his mistake], he must stop<sup><xref rid="fn2269">45</xref></sup> and re-read [the passage in full]. Even after one had read the <italic>haf&#x1E6D;arah</italic> in [a Book of] a Prophet and recited the <italic>musaf</italic>, he must stop forthwith and read [the Scriptural passage]. The <italic>musaf</italic>, however,<sup><xref rid="fn2270">46</xref></sup> need not be repeated.</p>
<ftnote id="fn2225">(1) The number corresponds to the three main divisions of the Bible: the Pentateuch, Prophets and Hagiographa; Meg. 24a (Sonc. ed., p. 143).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2226">(2) Who translated and expounded the Heb. text into Aramaic for the congregation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2227">(3) So that the interpreter, who had no book before him, should not become confused.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2228">(4) If desired. Since no instruction in law is involved in the lection from the Prophets as in the Torah, a mistake would not be serious.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2229">(5) For the interpreter.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2234">(10) lit. &#x2018;between reading and reading&#x2019;. The number of times he sits down corresponds to the number of persons who are to be called up for the reading. This ruling applies to the time when only the first and last who were called up recited the benedictions before and after the reading. At the present time, when each person called up recites the benedictions before and after his portion, there is no need for the sitting down.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2235">(11) Omitting the intermediate portions.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2236">(12) The unrolling of which might disturb the congregation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2237">(13) GRA in agreement with j.Meg. IV, 5, 75b. V and H read &#x2018;interpreted it, as for instance&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2238">(14) And consequently no unrolling is required. Why, then, should skipping in such a case be forbidden?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2239">(15) lit. &#x2018;but&#x2019; added by GRA. V and H omit.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2240">(16) lit. <italic>after the death</italic>, designating the section Lev. XVI.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2241">(17) lit. <italic>howbeit on the tenth</italic>, designating the section beginning Lev. XXIII, 27. These sections are far removed from one another and the Torah scroll must consequently be unrolled in public. Why is this permitted?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2242">(18) Therefore unrolling in public is permitted.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2243">(19) i.e. the Day of Atonement. As they form one subject, skipping from place to place is allowed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2244">(20) lit. &#x2018;and you may know&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2245">(21) lit. &#x2018;in every place one may not&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2246">(22) The section beginning <italic>And on the tenth day</italic> (Num. XXIX, 7).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2247">(23) For the reason stated above.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2248">(24) So j.Meg. IV, 5, 75b, the text of which is followed here. V has &#x2018;Mar&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2249">(25) In Upper Galilee.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2250">(26) When skipping is necessary from one passage to another.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2251">(27) There is no need to return the scroll to the ark after the first reading had concluded and then take it out again for the second section.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2252">(28) The present custom is to take both scrolls from the ark at the same time and to keep the second rolled and wrapped until the completion of the reading from the first.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2253">(29) Which are not so far from one another as to cause the interpreter to stop and keep the congregation waiting while the scroll is being unrolled to the second section, and deal with the same subject, thus causing no confusion to the hearers.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2254">(30) So GRA and H in agreement with j.Meg. <italic>loc. cit.</italic> The reading of V is &#x2018;Jehoiada the priest&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2255">(31) lit. &#x2018;readings or callings&#x2019;, i.e. the lection was allocated to less than the minimum number.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2256">(32) Or, &#x2018;had called up&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2257">(33) lit. &#x2018;the order&#x2019;, the prescribed section for the reading of the day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2258">(34) This apparently refers to ancient Synagogues where only short portions of the Torah were read or where it was completed once in three years, not annually as is the present custom. Then the section for a Sabbath may sometimes have been very short.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2259">(35) lit. &#x2018;from another portion&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2260">(36) At the end of the third verse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2261">(37) On which occasion three persons are called to the reading of the Torah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2262">(38) According to some authorities, if nine verses were read no repetition of the reading is necessary (cf. <italic>&#x2019;Ora&#x1E25; &#x1E24;ayyim</italic> CXXXVII, &#x00A7;1 and commentaries <italic>ad loc.</italic>). Others maintain that in general ten is the minimum number.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2263">(39) On a Festival which occurs on a week-day there is no reading from the Torah in the afternoon service.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2264">(40) i.e. from the beginning of the lection of the next Sabbath.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2265">(41) So GRA and H. V has &#x2018;from&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2266">(42) lit. &#x2018;within&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2267">(43) i.e. Monday and Thursday.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2268">(44) Since the omitted verses will be read on the following Sabbath morning in the course of the lection.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2269">(45) Added by GRA.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2270">(46) So GRA. V inserts &#x2018;because&#x2019; which cannot be justified.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER XII</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. It is permitted to make a break<sup><xref rid="fn2271">1</xref></sup> in the blessings<sup><xref rid="fn2272">2</xref></sup> but not in the curses.<sup><xref rid="fn2273">3</xref></sup> R. &#x1E24;iyya b. Gamda said: What is the reason?<sup><xref rid="fn2274">4</xref></sup> Because it is written [<italic>My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord</italic>,]<sup><xref rid="fn2275">5</xref></sup> <italic>neither cut thou up His correction</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2276">6</xref></sup>&#x2014;do not cut them<sup><xref rid="fn2277">7</xref></sup> up into pieces.<sup><xref rid="fn2278">8</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. R. Levi said:<sup><xref rid="fn2279">9</xref></sup> The Holy One, blessed be He, said: It is not proper that My children shall be cursed while I am being blessed.<sup><xref rid="fn2280">10</xref></sup> R. Jose b. Abin said: It is not for this reason, but because one who stands up to read in the Torah must begin and conclude with something auspicious.<sup><xref rid="fn2281">11</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. Levi b. Pa&#x1E6D;i enquired of R. Hanina, &#x2018;What is the law in regard to the curses each of which begins with <italic>&#x2019;arur?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2282">12</xref></sup> Must they be read by one person only,<sup><xref rid="fn2283">13</xref></sup> and must a benediction be recited before and after them?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;There is no [passage] that requires a benediction before and after its reading but the curses of Leviticus<sup><xref rid="fn2284">14</xref></sup> and Deuteronomy&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn2285">15</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. When Jonathan, a children&#x2019;s teacher from Gufta,<sup><xref rid="fn2286">16</xref></sup> came down here,<sup><xref rid="fn2287">17</xref></sup> he saw a children&#x2019;s teacher, R. Abuna, reading the Song of the Well<sup><xref rid="fn2288">18</xref></sup> and reciting the benedictions before and after it. &#x2018;Is it proper,&#x2019; he asked him, &#x2018;to act in this manner?&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn2289">19</xref></sup> &#x2018;Do you,&#x2019; the other retorted, &#x2018;still require [a ruling] on this subject? All poems<sup><xref rid="fn2290">20</xref></sup> must be preceded and followed by benedictions.&#x2019;</p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. A question<sup><xref rid="fn2291">21</xref></sup> was asked of<sup><xref rid="fn2292">22</xref></sup> R. Simon. &#x2018;There is no section&#x2019;,<sup><xref rid="fn2293">23</xref></sup> he told them in the name of R. Joshua b. Levi, &#x2018;which requires a benediction before and after its reading other than the Song at the Sea, the Ten Words,<sup><xref rid="fn2294">24</xref></sup> and the curses in Deuteronomy&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn2295">25</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. R. Abahu<sup><xref rid="fn2296">26</xref></sup> said: I have not heard [such a ruling],<sup><xref rid="fn2297">27</xref></sup> but it is feasible to apply it to the Ten Words. R. Jose b. Abin said in the name of Rabbi:<sup><xref rid="fn2298">28</xref></sup> The last ten verses in Deuteronomy<sup><xref rid="fn2299">29</xref></sup> require a benediction before and after they have been read.<sup><xref rid="fn2300">30</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>. R. Isaac Se&#x1E25;orah asked R. Isaac Nappa&#x1E25;a, &#x2018;What do we read [first]<sup><xref rid="fn2301">31</xref></sup> when the New Moon of <italic>&#x1E6C;ebeth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2302">32</xref></sup> falls on a Sabbath?&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn2303">33</xref></sup> [He replied,] &#x2018;In the section of <italic>kalloth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2304">34</xref></sup> while the <italic>maf&#x1E6D;ir</italic> reads<sup><xref rid="fn2305">35</xref></sup> the passages relating to the Sabbath and the New Moon.<sup><xref rid="fn2306">36</xref></sup> If it falls on a week-day we call up on the first day<sup><xref rid="fn2307">37</xref></sup> three persons for the reading of the New Moon, the fourth reading that of <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic>, because that which is more frequent takes precedence.<sup><xref rid="fn2308">38</xref></sup> But since the reading of the New Moon was read first,<sup><xref rid="fn2309">39</xref></sup> [40<italic>a</italic>] three persons are to be called up on the second day for the reading of the <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> passage,<sup><xref rid="fn2310">40</xref></sup> while the fourth reads<sup><xref rid="fn2311">41</xref></sup> the section of the New Moon, viz. <italic>uberash&#x00EB; &#x1E25;odshekem</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2312">42</xref></sup> to the end of the passage.<sup><xref rid="fn2313">43</xref></sup> Why is this so?<sup><xref rid="fn2314">44</xref></sup> Because it was only on account of the New Moon <italic>musaf</italic> that a fourth person is added&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn2315">45</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>. R. Jose b. Abin said: For the Song of <italic>Ha&#x2019;azinu</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2316">46</xref></sup> not less than six persons<sup><xref rid="fn2317">47</xref></sup> are to be called up, and your mnemonic sign<sup><xref rid="fn2318">48</xref></sup> is <italic>h z y w l k</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2319">49</xref></sup> which stands for <italic>ha&#x2019;azinu</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2320">50</xref></sup> <italic>zekor</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2321">51</xref></sup> <italic>yarkibehu</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2322">52</xref></sup> <italic>wayyishman</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2323">53</xref></sup> <italic>lu</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2324">54</xref></sup> <italic>ki yadin &#x2026; &#x2018;ammo</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2325">55</xref></sup> It must also be provided with<sup><xref rid="fn2326">56</xref></sup> the space of a full line above it and of a full line below it. Corresponding to it the custom has been adopted to write in the Torah its number of lines.<sup><xref rid="fn2327">57</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>. A mnemonic sign for the beginnings of the lines<sup><xref rid="fn2328">58</xref></sup> is the following: <italic>ha&#x2019;azinu</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2329">59</xref></sup>

<ftnote id="fn2271">(1) i.e. the passage may be divided and two persons called up to the reading.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2272">(2) e.g. Lev. XXVI, 3-13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2273">(3) <italic>ibid.</italic> 14-46.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2274">(4) Why may not more than one person be called to the section of the curses?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2275">(5) This is the first part of the verse which is not quoted in the text of the Tractate.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2276">(6) Prov. III, 11, E.V. <italic>neither spurn</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2277">(7) lit. &#x2018;make it&#x2019;, a section in the Torah which deals with God&#x2019;s chastening of Israel.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2278">(8) The Heb. root may bear both meanings: &#x2018;spurn&#x2019; and &#x2018;cut up&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2279">(9) Explaining the reason that no more than one person may be called to the reading of the curses in Lev. XXVI, 14ff.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2280">(10) By the recital of the benedictions in the middle of reading the curses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2281">(11) If two persons were to be called to the reading, the first would finish and the second begin with a verse which threatens a curse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2282">(12) Deut. XXVII, 15-26, each verse commencing <italic>Cursed be</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2283">(13) As with the curses of Lev. XXVI, 14ff which must not be read by more than one person.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2284">(14) <italic>Torath Kohanim</italic>, lit. &#x2018;the law of the priests&#x2019;, the name of the Book of Leviticus. The passage is XXVI, 14-46.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2285">(15) <italic>Mishneh Torah</italic>, lit. &#x2018;the repetition of the law&#x2019;, the name of the Book of Deuteronomy. The passage is XXVIII, 15-68. Only with these passages, which are not restricted to a particular time, are the benedictions recited before and after they have been read; but with the <italic>&#x2019;arur</italic> curses, which were spoken by the Levites only (cf. Deut. XXVII, 14) and at the time when the Jordan was crossed (<italic>ibid.</italic> 2), no benedictions are to be recited.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2286">(16) In Galilee. V incorrectly &#x2018;Gufthera&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2287">(17) Tiberias where R. Abuna re-sided. The city is a on lower level, hence the verb &#x2018;came down&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2288">(18) Num. XXI, 17-20.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2289">(19) The rule is that the benedictions are recited only at the beginning and end of the entire section to be read. The Song of the Well, appearing in the middle of a section, should consequently require no benedictions before and after its reading.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2290">(20) Such as the Song of the Sea (Ex. XV, 1-19), the Song of the Well and probably also Deut. XXXII, 1-43.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2291">(21) In connection with the preceding Rule.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2292">(22) Another reading is &#x2018;he came and asked&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2293">(23) lit. &#x2018;you have not&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2294">(24) The Decalogue (Ex. XX, 2-17).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2295">(25) Deut. XXVIII, 15-68. Others add &#x2018;the curses in Leviticus&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2296">(26) So GRA and H. V reads &#x2018;Abi&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2297">(27) That in the case of the passages specified benedictions are to be recited before and after the reading.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2298">(28) [The reading should be &#x2018;R. Berekiah&#x2019; or &#x2018;R. Simon&#x2019;; cf. Bacher, <italic>Ag. d. pal. Amor&#x00E4;er</italic>, III, p. 727, n. 7.]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2299">(29) So GRA and N.Y. The text in V is difficult.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2300">(30) These verses, which describe the death of Moses, form a section of their own, because they were written by Joshua (according to R. Judah or R. Nehemiah) or, if written by Moses, they were dictated to him by God while he &#x2018;wrote them down with tears&#x2019; (B.B. 15a, Sonc. ed., p. 72).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2301">(31) In the second and third scrolls.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2302">(32) Which always occurs in the week of <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2303">(33) Three scrolls are then taken from the ark. The usual weekly portion is read in the first, and the passages for New Moon and <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> in the second and third.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2304">(34) E.V. <italic>made an end</italic> (Num. VII, 1). This designates the entire section, descriptive of the dedication offerings brought by the princes of Israel, which is prescribed for the reading of the day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2305">(35) In the third scroll.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2306">(36) Num. XXVIII, 9-15. The present custom is always to read the section for the Sabbath and New Moon first, and then the passage for <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2307">(37) Of the two days of the New Moon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2308">(38) The New Moon occurs monthly, <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> once a year.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2309">(39) On the first day of the New Moon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2310">(40) In the first scroll. Only two scrolls are taken out on a week-day during <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2311">(41) In the second scroll.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2312">(42) E.V. <italic>and in your new moons</italic> (Num. XXVIII, 11).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2313">(43) <italic>ibid.</italic> 15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2314">(44) i.e. why is the fourth person called to the reading of the New Moon passage and not, as on the first day, to the <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> passage?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2315">(45) On the other week-days of <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> there is no <italic>musaf</italic>. This argument cannot be applied to the first day of the New Moon because it is the second day which begins the month. The first of the two days of the New Moon is the last day of the preceding month. V and H insert here a ruling which has no connection with this chapter and is practically identical with XIV, 2 below.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2316">(46) E.V. <italic>give ear</italic>, designating the section Deut. XXXII, 1-43. For <italic>Ha&#x2019;azinu</italic> (the reading of GRA) V and H read &#x2018;the Levites&#x2019;, because the poem was sung by the Levites in the Temple during the Sabbath <italic>musaf</italic> in six parts on successive Sabbaths.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2317">(47) Because the Levites concluded it in cycles of six Sabbath divisions.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2318">(48) For the words beginning each of the six parts. The divisions, according to Maimonides, emphasize the exhortations and arouse the people to repentance.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2319">(49) pronounced <span dir="rtl">.&#x05D4;&#x05D6;&#x05D9;&#x05F4;&#x05D5; &#x05DC;&#x05F4;&#x05DA;</span></ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2322">(52) E.V. <italic>He made him ride</italic> (<italic>ibid.</italic> 13).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2324">(54) E.V. <italic>if</italic> (<italic>ibid.</italic> 29).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2325">(55) E.V. <italic>for the Lord will judge His people</italic> (<italic>ibid.</italic> 36).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2326">(56) lit. &#x2018;and it has&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2327">(57) The number is 72 according to GRA who apparently includes the two blank lines. Maimonides and others give the number as 70.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2328">(58) Of the song <italic>Ha&#x2019;azinu</italic>. The following renderings are from E.V. While the Heb. words stand at the beginning of the respective lines, the translations, owing to English idiom, do not always occupy the same position in the sentence.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER XIII</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. In regard, however,<sup><xref rid="fn2498">1</xref></sup> to the Song of David in Samuel<sup><xref rid="fn2499">2</xref></sup> and in the Psalms,<sup><xref rid="fn2500">3</xref></sup> the Sages have not prescribed a limit;<sup><xref rid="fn2501">4</xref></sup> but a skilled scribe spaces them out symmetrically<sup><xref rid="fn2502">5</xref></sup> according to the beginnings, the middle pauses, and the endings of the verses.<sup><xref rid="fn2503">6</xref></sup> A similar arrangement is also followed throughout the Psalms and in Job and Proverbs.</p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. The scroll of Esther<sup><xref rid="fn2504">7</xref></sup> requires ruled lines<sup><xref rid="fn2505">8</xref></sup> as does the real<sup><xref rid="fn2506">9</xref></sup> Torah,<sup><xref rid="fn2507">10</xref></sup> because it is called &#x2018;a scroll&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn2508">11</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. The ten sons of Haman<sup><xref rid="fn2509">12</xref></sup> and the kings of Canaan<sup><xref rid="fn2510">13</xref></sup> are written in the form of a half-brick over a half-brick and a brick over a brick.<sup><xref rid="fn2511">14</xref></sup> Such a structure<sup><xref rid="fn2512">15</xref></sup> does not endure.<sup><xref rid="fn2513">16</xref></sup> What is implied by &#x2018;such&#x2019;?<sup><xref rid="fn2514">17</xref></sup> Does it indicate a recommendation<sup><xref rid="fn2515">18</xref></sup> or an indispensable condition?<sup><xref rid="fn2516">19</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. R. Jose<sup><xref rid="fn2517">20</xref></sup> said to R. &#x1E24;anina, the nephew of R. Hoshaiah, &#x2018;Surely you remember that when we were standing in front of the shop of your uncle, R. Hoshaiah, R. Ba&#x2019; b. Zabda passed by and we put the question to him, and he replied that the condition was indispensable&#x2019;.</p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. R. &#x1E24;iyya b. R. Adda of Jaffa, quoting R. Jeremiah in the name of R. Ze&#x2018;ira, said: The names of the ten sons of Haman and the word <italic>ten</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2518">21</xref></sup> must be recited in one breath.</p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. R. Jose b. Abin said: When they<sup><xref rid="fn2519">22</xref></sup> are written down, the word <italic>&#x2019;ish</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2520">23</xref></sup> must be at the top of the column<sup><xref rid="fn2521">24</xref></sup> and each <italic>we&#x2019;eth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2522">25</xref></sup> at the end [of the lines, a total] of eleven lines,<sup><xref rid="fn2523">26</xref></sup> and <italic>&#x2018;asereth</italic> at the end of the column. Thus, in reading transversely, the columns<sup><xref rid="fn2524">27</xref></sup> appear laced and closely corded like transverse lacing [of a web].<sup><xref rid="fn2525">28</xref></sup> It symbolizes that when [the ten sons] fall there will be no rising for them.</p>
<p>The phrase <italic>&#x2019;a&#x1E25;ar haddebarim &#x2026; Hammedatha</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2526">29</xref></sup> was translated by R. Joseph as follows:<sup><xref rid="fn2527">30</xref></sup> &#x2018;After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha the Aggagite, son of Sera&#x1E25;,<sup><xref rid="fn2528">31</xref></sup> son of Buza, son of Aflutos,<sup><xref rid="fn2529">32</xref></sup> son of Deosis,<sup><xref rid="fn2530">33</xref></sup> son of Padom,<sup><xref rid="fn2531">34</xref></sup> son of Ma&#x2018;adi,<sup><xref rid="fn2532">35</xref></sup> son of Be&#x2018;alkon,<sup><xref rid="fn2533">36</xref></sup> son of Antamarus,<sup><xref rid="fn2534">37</xref></sup> son of &#x1E24;arum,<sup><xref rid="fn2535">38</xref></sup> son of Hadoram,<sup><xref rid="fn2536">39</xref></sup> son of Shazar,<sup><xref rid="fn2537">40</xref></sup> son of Nagar,<sup><xref rid="fn2538">41</xref></sup> son of Parshandatha,<sup><xref rid="fn2539">42</xref></sup> son of Wayezatha, son of &#x2018;Amale&#x1E33;,<sup><xref rid="fn2540">43</xref></sup> son of the concubine of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau; he advanced him and set his seat above all his princes and his servants, because pride goeth before destruction&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn2541">44</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>. R. Ze&#x2018;ira said: The <italic>waw</italic> of <italic>Wayezatha</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2542">45</xref></sup> must project like a boat-pole on the river Libruth.<sup><xref rid="fn2543">46</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>. If a person holds a scroll of the Torah [in order to read it], there is a difference of opinion between two <italic>Tanna&#x2019;im</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2544">47</xref></sup> One declared that he should open it, look [for the passage which is to be read], roll it up and then say the benediction;<sup><xref rid="fn2545">48</xref></sup> but the other declared that he should open it, look [for the required passage] and say the benediction.<sup><xref rid="fn2546">49</xref></sup> What is the reason?<sup><xref rid="fn2547">50</xref></sup> Because it is written, <italic>And when he opened it, all the people stood up;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2548">51</xref></sup> and what follows? <italic>And Ezra blessed</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2549">52</xref></sup> <italic>the Lord, the great God</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2550">53</xref></sup> Whereby did he proclaim His greatness?<sup><xref rid="fn2551">54</xref></sup> Rab said: He proclaimed His greatness by pronouncing the Ineffable Name.<sup><xref rid="fn2552">55</xref></sup> Raba said: He proclaimed His greatness by the recital of the prescribed benediction.</p>
<p>What is the form of the benedictions?<sup><xref rid="fn2553">56</xref></sup> In an assembly of ten<sup><xref rid="fn2554">57</xref></sup> one says, &#x2018;Bless ye the Lord Who is to be blessed&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn2555">58</xref></sup> In the case of an individual, when he rises early to read in the Torah, he says, &#x2018;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, Who hast given us a Torah from heaven, everlasting life from the heights. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who givest the Torah&#x2019;. Then<sup><xref rid="fn2556">59</xref></sup> he rolls up the scroll<sup><xref rid="fn2557">60</xref></sup> and says, &#x2018;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, Who hast given us a Torah of truth and hast planted everlasting life in our midst. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who givest the Torah&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn2558">61</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>. Similarly when one reads from the Prophets,<sup><xref rid="fn2559">62</xref></sup> a benediction is said as follows: &#x2018;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, Who hast chosen good prophets, and hast found pleasure in their words which were spoken in truth. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who hast chosen the Torah and Moses Thy servant, and Israel Thy people, and the prophets of truth and righteousness&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn2560">63</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 10</small>. And at the end [of the reading of the portion from the Prophets], one says the following benedictions: &#x2018;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, Rock of all worlds, righteous through all generations, O faithful God, Who sayest and doest, Who speakest<sup><xref rid="fn2561">64</xref></sup> and fulfillest, all Whose words are truth and righteousness&#x2019;. The people forthwith stand and say:<sup><xref rid="fn2562">65</xref></sup> &#x2018;Faithful art Thou, O Lord our God, faithful are Thy words, ever faithful, living and enduring are Thy name and remembrance; and do Thou reign<sup><xref rid="fn2563">66</xref></sup> continually over us for ever and ever&#x2019;. This point<sup><xref rid="fn2564">67</xref></sup> is one of the disagreements between the scholars of the East and West; the former give the response<sup><xref rid="fn2565">68</xref></sup> while sitting and the latter while standing. But wherever two <italic>Tanna&#x2019;im</italic> or two <italic>&#x2019;Amora&#x2019;im</italic> differ, and we are not certain with whom the <italic>halakah</italic> agrees, we follow him who maintains the stricter view. How much more then must we, in regard to the praise<sup><xref rid="fn2566">69</xref></sup> of the Life of all the worlds,<sup><xref rid="fn2567">70</xref></sup> which is a matter of the heart,<sup><xref rid="fn2568">71</xref></sup> teach our disciples as the rule to be practised that the <italic>halakah</italic> is in agreement with him who upholds the stricter view;<sup><xref rid="fn2569">72</xref></sup> as Scripture states, <italic>The Lord hath made every thing for His own purpose</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2570">73</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 11</small>. After that<sup><xref rid="fn2571">74</xref></sup> the <italic>maf&#x1E6D;ir</italic> resumes his recital<sup><xref rid="fn2572">75</xref></sup> and says, &#x2018;Faithful art Thou, O Lord our God, and faithful are Thy words, and not one of Thy words shall return void, for Thou art a faithful<sup><xref rid="fn2573">76</xref></sup> God and King. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, the God Who art faithful in all Thy words&#x2019;.</p>
<p><small>RULE 12</small>. &#x2018;Comfort,<sup><xref rid="fn2574">77</xref></sup> O Lord our God, Zion Thy city, for it is the home of our life, and save her that is grieved in spirit speedily, even in our days. [40<italic>b</italic>] Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who makest Zion joyful through her children.&#x2019;</p>
<p><small>RULE 13</small>. &#x2018;Gladden us, O Lord our God,<sup><xref rid="fn2575">78</xref></sup> with Elijah the prophet, Thy servant, and with the kingdom of the house of David, Thine anointed. Soon may he come and rejoice our hearts. Suffer not a stranger to sit upon his throne, nor let others any longer inherit his glory; for by Thy holy name Thou didst swear unto him, that his light should not be quenched for ever. In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely; and this is his name whereby he shall be called: the Lord is our righteousness.<sup><xref rid="fn2576">79</xref></sup> Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who causest the horn of salvation to flourish for Thy people Israel.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn2577">80</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 14</small>. &#x2018;For the Torah, [for the divine service],<sup><xref rid="fn2578">81</xref></sup> for the prophets and for this holy<sup><xref rid="fn2579">82</xref></sup> &#x2026; which Thou, O Lord our God, hast given us for holiness and for rest, for honour and for glory. For all these things, O Lord our God, we thank Thee, and continually bless<sup><xref rid="fn2580">83</xref></sup> Thy name, O God of our salvation. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who sanctifiest Israel and such and such a day.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn2581">84</xref></sup></p>
<p>An exception is made on the Sabbath when &#x2018;Israel&#x2019; is not mentioned in the conclusion but only &#x2018;Who sanctifiest the Sabbath&#x2019;; because the Sabbath preceded Israel, as it is written, <italic>For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day He ceased from work and rested</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2582">85</xref></sup> and it is further said, <italic>See that the Lord hath given you the sabbath</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2583">86</xref></sup> which implies that the Sabbath had already been in existence.</p>

<ftnote id="fn2507">(10) Here denotes the Pentateuch.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2508">(11) The text corrected by GRA. V has &#x2018;scroll called&#x2019;. &#x2018;Scroll&#x2019; is lit. &#x2018;book&#x2019;, the word used in Esth. IX, 32. For another reason, cf. Meg. 16b (Sonc. ed., p. 100).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2509">(12) Esth. IX, 7-9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2510">(13) Josh. XII, 9-24.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2511">(14) Like the song of <italic>Ha&#x2019;azinu</italic> (cf. above XII, 8).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2512">(15) In which bricks and half-bricks rest one above the other and do not overlap.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2513">(16) And so is symbolic of the fate of Haman&#x2019;s sons.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2514">(17) The statement &#x2018;such a structure does not last&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2515">(18) As the arrangement is only a symbol, a deviation from it would not disqualify the scroll.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2516">(19) A deviation would then lead to disqualification. The answer follows in the next Rule.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2517">(20) The translation follows GRA and H in agreement with j.Meg. III, 7, 74b. V reads: &#x2018;R. Jose b. &#x1E24;anina, the brother of R. Hoshaiah, R. Abba b. Zabda surrounded thee, and we asked him this, and he said in the name of Rab that the condition was indispensable&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2518">(21) Esth. IX, 10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2519">(22) The names of Haman&#x2019;s sons.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2521">(24) And at the beginning of the first line.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2522">(25) Sign of the defined accusative which occurs ten times, each preceding the names of the ten sons.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2523">(26) The first line consisting of <italic>&#x2019;ish</italic> on the right and <italic>we&#x2019;eth</italic> on the left, the next nine lines having the name on the right and <italic>we&#x2019;eth</italic> on the left, while the eleventh line has the name <italic>Wayezatha</italic> on the right and <italic>&#x2018;asereth</italic> (<italic>ten</italic>) on the left.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2524">(27) On the right (consisting of <italic>&#x2019;ish</italic> and the ten names), and the left (ten times <italic>we&#x2019;eth</italic> and <italic>&#x2018;asereth</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2525">(28) The reading of V is corrupt and the translation follows GRA, N.Y. and Jastrow.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2526">(29) Esth. III, 1, E.V. <italic>After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of Hammedatha</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2527">(30) R. Joseph is the reputed author of a later Aramaic translation of the Prophets and Hagiographa.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2528">(31) A name derived from a root &#x2018;to stink&#x2019;. The object of the genealogy is to trace Haman, the symbol of the enemies of Jews throughout their history, through a chain of despicable men to Esau, the brother but enemy of the patriarch Jacob.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2529">(32) Buza means &#x2018;contempt&#x2019;, and Aflutos is probably Plutos, a heathen god.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2530">(33) Dionysus (?).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2531">(34) Or, Pados (putrid?).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2532">(35) Meaning &#x2018;sickness&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2533">(36) The meaning is &#x2018;cunning&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2534">(37) Signifying &#x2018;crushed stones&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2535">(38) Or, &#x1E24;uram, possibly the heathen god Ares.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2536">(39) Or, Heridos, i.e. Herod who is known in history as a tyrant.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2537">(40) Meaning &#x2018;hip disease&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2538">(41) Or, possibly, Negad (a whip).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2539">(42) This and the following were also names of two of Haman&#x2019;s sons.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2540">(43) The ancestor of the people who were the first to attack Israel after their exodus from Egypt.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2541">(44) The last four words come from Prov. XVI, 18. The translation of the paragraph embodies most of GRA&#x2019;s emendations.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2542">(45) Esth. IX, 9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2543">(46) i.e. the <italic>waw</italic> must be longer than the other letters. The ruling is quoted from Meg. 16b (Sonc. ed., p. 99). The river has not been identified.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2544">(47) On the question whether the prescribed benedictions should be said while the scroll is open or rolled.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2545">(48) Were one to say it while the scroll is open, people might erroneously assume that the benediction is written in the Torah (Meg. 32a, Sonc. ed., pp. 192f).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2546">(49) Because nobody could be so ignorant as to be unaware that the benedictions do not form a part of the text of the Torah (Meg. <italic>loc. cit.</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2547">(50) That the scroll must be open when the benediction is said.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2548">(51) Neh. VIII, 5 referring to the scroll of the Torah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2549">(52) i.e. he said the prescribed benedictions.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2550">(53) <italic>ibid.</italic> 6. As Ezra <italic>opened</italic> the scroll and <italic>blessed the Lord</italic>, so everyone who reads the Torah must have the scroll open when the benedictions are said.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2551">(54) As implied in the words <italic>the great God</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2552">(55) The Tetragrammaton.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2553">(56) Before and after the reading in the Torah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2554">(57) A minimum of ten males over the age of thirteen is required for congregational worship.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2555">(58) And then follow the benedictions given later for an individual in private reading.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2556">(59) At the conclusion of the reading.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2557">(60) This is a unanimous ruling. It is upheld even by the Rabbi who maintained that the scroll must be open when the first benediction is said.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2558">(61) The benedictions now in use are shorter (P.B., p. 147).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2559">(62) The <italic>haf&#x1E6D;arah</italic> which is read after the conclusion of the prescribed section of the Torah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2560">(63) <italic>Weha&#x1E93;&#x1E93;ede&#x1E33;</italic>, the noun being preceded by <italic>he</italic>, the definite article. This is the version adopted by the Sefaradim, while the Ashkenazim omit the article (cf. P.B., p. 149).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2561">(64) V reads <italic>medabber</italic>, without the article, as in the current version (P.B., <italic>loc. cit.</italic>).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2562">(65) This is not the present usage when the reader proceeds to say the benedictions mentioned in Rule 11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2563">(66) So GRA. V reads &#x2018;He will reign&#x2019;, H &#x2018;Thou wilt reign&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2564">(67) Whether the benediction is to be said while sitting or standing.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2565">(68) To the reader, with the benediction.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2566">(69) The benedictions.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2567">(70) [On this designation of God, cf. Marmorstein, <italic>The Old Rabbinic Doctrine of God</italic>, I, p. 85.]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2568">(71) V reads <italic>galu&#x00EF;</italic> (revealed), M and H <italic>talu&#x00EF;</italic> (dependent).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2569">(72) Following the emended text of GRA.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2570">(73) Prov. XVI, 4. There is consequently all the more reason why the stricter view should be followed, viz. that the blessings and praises of God be said while standing.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2571">(74) After the people have concluded their benedictions (see the preceding Rule).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2572">(75) lit. &#x2018;subject&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2573">(76) The current version adds &#x2018;and merciful&#x2019; (P.B., p. 149).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2574">(77) This is the continuation of the benedictions after the <italic>haf&#x1E6D;arah</italic>. The version now in use (P.B., <italic>loc. cit.</italic>) reads &#x2018;have mercy&#x2019; instead of &#x2018;comfort&#x2019; (GRA emends accordingly), and &#x2018;O Lord our God&#x2019; and &#x2018;Thy city&#x2019; are omitted.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2575">(78) From &#x2018;with Elijah&#x2019; to &#x2018;swear unto him&#x2019; is represented in V by &#x2018;etc.&#x2019; M and H cite the benediction in full.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2576">(79) &#x2018;In his days &#x2026; righteousness&#x2019; is a quotation from Jer. XXIII, 6 and is now omitted from the benediction.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2577">(80) The present custom (in accordance with Pes. 117b, Sonc. ed., p. 603) is to conclude, &#x2018;Blessed art Thou, O Lord, the Shield of David&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2578">(81) M and H insert this phrase which is included in P.B.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2579">(82) The &#x2018;Sabbath&#x2019; or the name of the Festival is inserted here; and when a Festival coincides with the Sabbath both are mentioned.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2580">(83) The P.B. version reads, &#x2018;Thee, blessed be Thy name by the mouth of every living being continually and for ever&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2581">(84) For &#x2018;such and such a day&#x2019; the name of the Festival is inserted.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2582">(85) Ex. XXXI, 17.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2583">(86) <italic>ibid.</italic> XVI, 29. The Sabbath was instituted at the creation of the world, and the use of the definite article in the second quotation indicates that it was a well-known institution at the time. The Festivals, on the other hand, were ordained after the people of Israel came into existence.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER XIV</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. And why did [the Rabbis] enact all these [benedictions]?<sup><xref rid="fn2584">1</xref></sup> In order to establish a correspondence between the seven benedictions [of the <italic>haf&#x1E6D;arah</italic>] and the seven readers.<sup><xref rid="fn2585">2</xref></sup> You may also similarly explain the reason for the twenty-two verses read in the [Book of a] Prophet: twenty-two corresponding to the seven readers, each of whom must read [a minimum of] three verses, and one corresponding to the superintendent of the Synagogue services.</p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. All that had been said<sup><xref rid="fn2586">3</xref></sup> applies only where the text was neither translated nor expounded; but where it was translated or expounded<sup><xref rid="fn2587">4</xref></sup> the <italic>maf&#x1E6D;ir</italic> reads three, five or six verses in the Prophet, and this suffices.<sup><xref rid="fn2588">5</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. In the case of Ruth, the Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes,<sup><xref rid="fn2589">6</xref></sup> Lamentations and Esther,<sup><xref rid="fn2590">7</xref></sup> it is necessary to say the benediction, &#x2018;Concerning the reading of the <italic>Megillah</italic>&#x2019;,<sup><xref rid="fn2591">8</xref></sup> although it is included in the Hagiographa.</p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. One who reads in the Hagiographa must say, &#x2018;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, Who hast sanctified us by Thy commandments and hast given us command to read in the Holy Writings&#x2019;.</p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. [The Rabbis] enacted that, as regards [the reading of] the scroll of Esther, the benediction on the &#x2018;season&#x2019; must be said;<sup><xref rid="fn2592">9</xref></sup> and after the conclusion of the reading the reader must say, &#x2018;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, O God Who dost plead our cause, judge our suit and avenge our wrong, Who redeemest and savest us from the hand of all tyrants. Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, Helper and Saviour&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn2593">10</xref></sup> The benediction is said<sup><xref rid="fn2594">11</xref></sup> on account of the humiliation of the Torah, while others maintain that it is said on account of the humiliation of Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn2595">12</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. [The Rabbis] further laid down that it is also necessary to offer praise and thanksgiving [in the benediction] for the redemption and release.<sup><xref rid="fn2596">13</xref></sup> Then one concludes: &#x2018;Blessed art Thou, O Lord, God of vengeance, Who dost requite enemies according to their deeds, art a Shield to the righteous, and savest Thy people from the hands of their adversaries&#x2019;. After that the righteous are lauded: &#x2018;Blessed be Mordecai, blessed be Esther, blessed be all Israel&#x2019;. Rab, however, declared that it is necessary to say, &#x2018;Accursed be Haman and accursed be his sons&#x2019;. R. Phinehas said: It is necessary to say, &#x2018;Harbonah be remembered for good&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn2597">14</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>. R. Berekiah, quoting R. Jeremiah who had it from R. &#x1E24;iyya, who reported it in the name of R. Jo&#x1E25;anan, said: When R. Jonathan came to the verse, <italic>Whom Nebuchadnezzar &#x2026; had carried away</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2598">15</xref></sup> he used to exclaim, &#x2018;O the wicked Nebuchadnezzar, may his bones be crushed&#x0021; the good is rewarded<sup><xref rid="fn2599">16</xref></sup> according to his goodness and the wicked according to his wickedness, as it is stated, <italic>The memory of the righteous shall be for a blessing; but the name of the wicked shall rot</italic>&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn2600">17</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>. The <italic>maf&#x1E6D;ir</italic> recites also the parts of the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2601">18</xref></sup> Of what Shema&#x2018; has this been said?<sup><xref rid="fn2602">19</xref></sup> Of the one [recited when] the scroll of the Torah [is taken from the ark].<sup><xref rid="fn2603">20</xref></sup> How does one begin?<sup><xref rid="fn2604">21</xref></sup> <italic>Happy are they that dwell in Thy house</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2605">22</xref></sup> Then the <italic>maf&#x1E6D;ir</italic> stands and recites, <italic>There is none like unto Thee among the gods, O Lord; and there are no works like Thine</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2606">23</xref></sup> <italic>Who is like unto Thee, O Lord, among the mighty? Who is like unto Thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2607">24</xref></sup> <italic>Thy kingdom is a kingdom for all ages, and Thy dominion endureth throughout all generations</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2608">25</xref></sup> <italic>The Lord is King, the Lord hath reigned, the Lord shall reign for ever and ever</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2609">26</xref></sup> <italic>The Lord was pleased, for His righteousness&#x2019; sake, to make the teaching great and glorious</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2610">27</xref></sup> <italic>The Lord will give strength unto His people; the Lord will bless His people with peace</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2611">28</xref></sup> <italic>Thou art the Lord, even Thou alone; Thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all things that are therein, the seas and all that is in them and Thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth Thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2612">29</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>. Thereupon<sup><xref rid="fn2613">30</xref></sup> the <italic>maf&#x1E6D;ir</italic> steps forward,<sup><xref rid="fn2614">31</xref></sup> takes the scroll of the Torah and says, <italic>Hear, O Israel</italic>, chanting the first verse,<sup><xref rid="fn2615">32</xref></sup> and the people say it after him in response.</p>
<p><small>RULE 10</small>. [The <italic>maf&#x1E6D;ir</italic>] then elevates the Torah scroll and says: &#x2018;One is our God, great is our Lord, holy and revered is His name for ever and ever&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn2616">33</xref></sup> Then he repeats: &#x2018;One is our God, great is our Lord, holy is He. One is our God, great is our Lord, holy and revered is His name&#x2019;. [This is said three times] corresponding in number<sup><xref rid="fn2617">34</xref></sup> to the three patriarchs; others hold that it corresponds to the three <italic>kedushshoth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2618">35</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 11</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn2619">36</xref></sup> <italic>&#x2018;Thy righteousness also, O God, reacheth unto high heaven; Thou Who hast done great things, O God, who is like unto Thee?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2620">37</xref></sup> <italic>O Lord, Thy name endureth for ever; Thy memorial, O Lord, throughout all generations</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2621">38</xref></sup> Let all ascribe strength to God and give honour to the Torah. <italic>O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt His name together</italic>.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn2622">39</xref></sup> The Torah scroll must be elevated at <italic>Hear, O Israel</italic>, at the threefold declaration of the unity of God, and at <italic>O magnify the Lord with me</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2623">40</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 12</small>. One must also say:<sup><xref rid="fn2624">41</xref></sup> &#x2018;Magnified and hallowed,<sup><xref rid="fn2625">42</xref></sup> praised and glorified, exalted and extolled, uplifted, honoured and adored<sup><xref rid="fn2626">43</xref></sup> above all be the name of the supreme King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, in the worlds which He hath created, this world and the world to come, in accordance with His desire and the desire of all His people, the house of Israel. May His kingdom be revealed and made visible unto us speedily and at a near time; and may He build His house in our days, and be gracious unto our remnant and unto the remnant of His people Israel in His mercy and in the abundance of His lovingkindness, in peace and grace, kindness and compassion. May the Omnipresent do all this for us for the sake of His great name; and say ye, Amen&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn2627">44</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 13</small>. After that he elevates the Torah scroll and says: &#x2018;One is our God, great is our Lord, holy and revered is His name for ever and ever&#x2019;. Then he begins to chant, &#x2018;The Lord is God, the Lord is His name&#x2019;. The congregation says it after him in response; then he repeats it twice and the congregation responds twice.<sup><xref rid="fn2628">45</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 14</small>. The scroll of the Torah is immediately unrolled a space of three columns and is elevated so as to show the face of the script to the people standing on the right and on the left. Then it is turned round towards the front and towards the rear; for it is a precept for all men and women to see the script,<sup><xref rid="fn2629">46</xref></sup> to bend their knees and exclaim, &#x2018;<italic>And this is the Torah which Moses set before the children of Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2630">47</xref></sup> <italic>The Torah of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul</italic>&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn2631">48</xref></sup> The <italic>maf&#x1E6D;ir</italic> then hands it over to the superintendent of the Synagogue services who returns it to the first<sup><xref rid="fn2632">49</xref></sup> of those who are to be called to the reading, because it is not an honour for the Torah to be left alone.<sup><xref rid="fn2633">50</xref></sup> Similarly it is not proper for the precentor to stand alone before the reading-desk; so [two persons] should stand with him, one on his right and the other on his left, [the number] corresponding to that of the patriarchs.<sup><xref rid="fn2634">51</xref></sup> The pure-minded men of Jerusalem acted in this manner: When the Torah scroll was taken out of the ark and when it was returned they followed it as a mark of respect.</p>
<p><small>RULE 15</small>. A minor<sup><xref rid="fn2635">52</xref></sup> may read in the Torah and translate it, but he may not read the parts of the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2636">53</xref></sup> by reciting &#x2018;Who formest light&#x2019;;<sup><xref rid="fn2637">54</xref></sup> nor may he stand before the reading-desk,<sup><xref rid="fn2638">55</xref></sup> nor lift up his hands.<sup><xref rid="fn2639">56</xref></sup> A <italic>po&#x1E25;ea&#x1E25;</italic>, that is one whose knees are exposed or whose clothes are torn, or one whose head is uncovered, may read the parts of the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic>. Others say that if a person&#x2019;s knees [are exposed] or his clothes torn he may read the parts of the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic>, but one may not do so when his head is uncovered, since it is not permitted to utter the divine names [with uncovered head]. In either case he may translate, but not read in the Torah, nor stand before the reading-desk, nor lift up his hands.</p>
<p><small>RULE 16</small>. A blind man may recite the parts of the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic> and translate. R. Judah said: One who has never seen the light may not read the parts of the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2640">57</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 17</small>. The minor of whom the Rabbis spoke<sup><xref rid="fn2641">58</xref></sup> is one who is under twelve years of age. A person who is above that age may read the parts of the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic>, but may not stand before the reading-desk nor lift up his hands<sup><xref rid="fn2642">59</xref></sup> until he is twenty years of age and bearded. If he has no beard, although he is twenty years of age, he is forbidden to do so because<sup><xref rid="fn2643">60</xref></sup> he looks like an eunuch. Others say that even an actual eunuch is permitted [to perform these acts]. If, however, a person has grown a beard even from the age of eighteen, he may stand before the reading-desk and lift up his hands.</p>
<p><small>RULE 18</small>. As regards the scroll of Esther, all are qualified to read it except a deaf person, an imbecile and a minor. R. Judah declared a minor to be qualified. R. Levi said: The scroll of Esther must be read [on <italic>Purim</italic>] at night and repeated in the daytime, as it is stated, <italic>So that my glory may sing praise to Thee</italic>&#x2014;i.e. by night, <italic>and not be silent</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2644">61</xref></sup>&#x2014;i.e. by day. (Therefore it is customary to read it at the termination of the Sabbath of two [successive weeks].)<sup><xref rid="fn2645">62</xref></sup> [41<italic>a</italic>] When R. Meir once passed by a Synagogue he heard the reading of<sup><xref rid="fn2646">63</xref></sup> a section [of the scroll of Esther].<sup><xref rid="fn2647">64</xref></sup> &#x2018;How long,&#x2019; he said to them, &#x2018;will you be cutting up the Torah<sup><xref rid="fn2648">65</xref></sup> into sections?&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn2649">66</xref></sup> [&#x2018;We do it&#x2019;], they replied, &#x2018;on account of <italic>my glory may sing praise unto Thee</italic>&#x2019;, and he allowed them [to continue the practice]. People have adopted the practice of reading it on two<sup><xref rid="fn2650">67</xref></sup> Saturday nights of <italic>Adar</italic> until fifteen days of the month have elapsed. In what manner is it read? At [the termination of] the first Sabbath of <italic>Adar</italic> the people read together up to <italic>In that night</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2651">68</xref></sup> and on the next Saturday night they read from <italic>In that night</italic> up to <italic>and speaking peace to all his seed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2652">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the case of the Song of Songs, it is read on the last [two] nights of the [Passover] Festival,<sup><xref rid="fn2653">70</xref></sup> half of it on the first night and the other half on the second night.</p>
<p>Ruth [is read] on the termination of the first day of Pentecost to [the end of] its [first] half, and concluded on the termination of the last day of the Festival. Others hold that with all the Festivals, we begin to read [the respective scrolls] on the Saturday night preceding them. People have also adopted the following procedure, viz. that no ruling is authoritatively laid down unless a custom<sup><xref rid="fn2654">71</xref></sup> had been definitely established.<sup><xref rid="fn2655">72</xref></sup> As regards the saying of the Rabbis that &#x2018;a custom cancels a ruling&#x2019;,<sup><xref rid="fn2656">73</xref></sup> it applies to a custom of the pious men of old; but a custom which has no support from the Torah is only like an error of judgment.<sup><xref rid="fn2657">74</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 19</small>. As we read [the weekly portion] from the Torah and the <italic>haf&#x1E6D;arah</italic> from the Prophet in daytime, so it is obligatory to read the scroll of Esther in daytime;<sup><xref rid="fn2658">75</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>In the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2659">76</xref></sup> on which it was taught in the Mishnah:<sup><xref rid="fn2660">77</xref></sup> The whole of the day is a proper time for the reading of the scroll of Esther.</p>
<p><small>RULE 20</small>. There is no difference between scrolls [of Scripture] and <italic>tefillin</italic> and <italic>mezuzoth</italic> save that the scrolls,<sup><xref rid="fn2661">78</xref></sup> etc. If a <italic>tefillah</italic> had worn out, no <italic>mezuzah</italic> may be made of it;<sup><xref rid="fn2662">79</xref></sup> but if a <italic>mezuzah</italic> had worn out it may be made into <italic>tefillin</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2663">80</xref></sup> because in sacred matters ascent to a higher degree of sanctity is allowed but not descent to a lesser degree.</p>
<ftnote id="fn2584">(1) For the <italic>haf&#x1E6D;arah</italic> as specified in the previous chapter.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2585">(2) The minimum number who must be called to the reading of the Torah every Sabbath.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2586">(3) In the preceding Rule concerning the minimum number of verses to be read in the Prophet.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2587">(4) So that much of the time of the worshippers was taken up by the translation or exposition.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2588">(5) The reading is curtailed for the convenience of the congregation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2589">(6) Inserted by GRA and H.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2590">(7) These books are read respectively on Pentecost, Passover, Tabernacles, the Fast of Ab and <italic>Purim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2591">(8) The full benediction is: &#x2018;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, Who hast sanctified us by Thy commandments, and hast given us command concerning the reading of the <italic>Megillah&#x2019;</italic> (P.B., p. 276). The present custom is to say the benediction for the scroll of Esther only. The others are read usually from a printed book without a benediction.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2592">(9) Like the benediction in the preceding note it begins with &#x2018;Blessed art Thou &#x2026; universe&#x2019; and concludes with &#x2018;Who hast kept us in life, and hast preserved us, and enabled us to reach this season&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2593">(10) Cf. the version in P.B., p. 276.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2594">(11) The reason for the benediction is given to explain why it must begin with &#x2018;Blessed art Thou&#x2019;, although it would appear to be a continuation of the benediction for the <italic>Megillah</italic> which includes this beginning.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2595">(12) Whose vindication is celebrated. As it is independent of the <italic>Megillah</italic>, it must consequently begin again with the usual formula. For &#x2018;Torah&#x2019;, M and H read &#x2018;the Divine Presence&#x2019; affronted by Haman&#x2019;s plot against God&#x2019;s people.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2596">(13) From threatened destruction.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2597">(14) He contributed to Haman&#x2019;s downfall (cf. Esth. VII, 9). For the version now in use, cf. P.B., p. 277.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2598">(15) Esth II, 6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2599">(16) lit. &#x2018;to mix&#x2019; (drinks), hence &#x2018;to serve drinks&#x2019; and, metaphorically, &#x2018;retribution, recompense&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2600">(17) Prov. X, 7. This verse justifies the execration of Nebuchadnezzar and (in Rule 6) of Haman.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2601">(18) This is explained below. The recitation of the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic> is deemed to be a great honour which compensates for the lesser dignity conferred by the reading of the <italic>haf&#x1E6D;arah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2602">(19) The <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic> is recited several times during the service.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2603">(20) Cf. the next Rule.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2604">(21) The collection of Biblical verses recited when the Torah scroll is taken from the ark.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2605">(22) Ps. LXXXIV, 5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2606">(23) <italic>ibid.</italic> LXXXVI, 8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2607">(24) Ex. XV, 11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2608">(25) Ps. CXLV, 13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2609">(26) Compounded from Ps. X, 16, XCIII, 1 (E.V. <italic>reigneth</italic>) and Ex. XV, 18.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2610">(27) Isa. XLII, 21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2611">(28) Ps. XXIX, 11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2612">(29) Neh. IX, 6.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2613">(30) lit. &#x2018;immediately&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2614">(31) lit. &#x2018;enters&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2615">(32) i.e. the whole of Deut. VI, <italic>4</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2616">(33) This is the reading of GRA. V, M and H omit the sentence.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2617">(34) The three repetitions of &#x2018;one is our God&#x2019;, etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2618">(35) lit. &#x2018;sanctifications&#x2019;, i.e. &#x2018;Holy, holy, holy&#x2019; with suitable introductions said three times in the morning service (cf. P.B., pp. 39, 45 and 73).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2619">(36) This is a continuation of the verses begun in Rule 8.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2620">(37) Ps. LXXI, 19.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2621">(38) <italic>ibid.</italic> CXXXV, 13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2622">(39) <italic>ibid</italic> XXXIV, 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2623">(40) For the modern ritual, cf. P.B., p. 145.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2624">(41) In concluding the verses and prayers cited in the preceding Rules.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2625">(42) This word is included by GRA and H.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2626">(43) V adds in parenthesis &#x2018;honoured and revered&#x2019; (so also M).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2627">(44) Cf. the version in P.B., pp. 145f.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2628">(45) This Rule is enclosed in round brackets in V. It appears to be a duplicate of Rule 10, but both M and H include it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2629">(46) Before it is read. The ritual here described is followed by the Sefaradim. The Ashkenazim elevate the scroll after the conclusion of the reading (cf. P.B., p. 148).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2630">(47) Deut. IV, 44. For other verses which are now added, cf. P.B., <italic>loc. cit.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2631">(48) Ps. XIX, 8. This verse is not included now.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2632">(49) lit. &#x2018;the head&#x2019; (so GRA). V has &#x2018;to cover the heads&#x2019;, which is obscure.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2633">(50) lit. &#x2018;single&#x2019;. It is therefore necessary for the <italic>maf&#x1E6D;ir</italic>, the superintendent and one of the congregation who is to read a portion to accompany the scroll.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2634">(51) V inserts in parenthesis a ruling which seems displaced although it is included by GRA, M and H. It reads: &#x2018;Some say that [the <italic>maf&#x1E6D;ir</italic>] recites the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic> with the benediction &#x201C;Who formest light&#x201D; (P.B., p. 128) and &#x201C;Holy&#x201D; (p. 131) because of the benediction which he says &#x201C;For the Torah, for the divine service&#x201D;, etc. (pp. 149f)&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2635">(52) The age is defined in Rule 17.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2636">(53) Cf. X, 7, p. 258 nn. 24ff.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2637">(54) The first of the benedictions before the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic> (cf. P.B., pp. 37f).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2638">(55) lit. &#x2018;pass before&#x2019;, etc., to act as reader of the prayers for the congregation.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2639">(56) To pronounce the priestly benediction if he is a <italic>Kohen</italic> (cf. P.B., p. 238a).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2640">(57) Since it contains thanksgivings for the creation and enjoyment of light.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2641">(58) In Rule 15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2642">(59) So GRA. V, M and H read: &#x2018;and he who stands before the reading-desk and he who lifts up his hands&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2643">(60) So GRA. V, M and H read &#x2018;although&#x2019; for &#x2018;he is &#x2026; because&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2644">(61) Ps. XXX, 13.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2645">(62) It is later explained that there was an ancient practice for the congregation to read the Book of Esther on the two Saturday evenings before <italic>Purim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2646">(63) lit. &#x2018;the voices&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2647">(64) On a Saturday night.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2648">(65) Which, in its wider sense, includes the Book of Esther.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2649">(66) lit. &#x2018;making the Torah callings up, callings up&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2650">(67) Inserted by GRA.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2651">(68) Esth. VI, 1; half the book.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2652">(69) To the end of the book.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2653">(70) So one MS. quoted by M. V and others add &#x2018;of the exile&#x2019;, which cannot be justified since only the last day of Passover is a &#x2018;Festival of the exile&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2654">(71) On which it is based.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2655">(72) So GRA. V, M and H read: &#x2018;unless it is a custom&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2656">(73) [Cf. j.B.M. VII, 1, 11b.]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2657">(74) lit. &#x2018;weighing of an opinion&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2658">(75) This is a repetition of R. Levi&#x2019;s teaching quoted in the preceding paragraph, except that it is more specific. The word <italic>welishnothah</italic> (translated &#x2018;repeated&#x2019;) might be mistranslated as &#x2018;the study of the Mishnah&#x2019; on the <italic>Megillah</italic>. The wording here precludes such a rendering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2659">(76) Esth. IX, 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2660">(77) Meg. II, 5 (Sonc. ed., p. 124).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2661">(78) The subject is continued in XV, 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2662">(79) A <italic>mezuzah</italic> is deemed to be of a lesser degree of sanctity.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2663">(80) If the margins are still in a good condition and fit for the purpose.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER XV</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. There is no difference between scrolls [of Scripture] and <italic>tefillin</italic> and <italic>mezuzoth</italic> save that the scrolls may be written in any language,<sup><xref rid="fn2664">1</xref></sup> whereas <italic>tefillin</italic> and <italic>mezuzoth</italic> may only be written in the Assyrian script.<sup><xref rid="fn2665">2</xref></sup> Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel said: Even scrolls [of Scripture] were permitted by the Rabbis to be written only in Greek.<sup><xref rid="fn2666">3</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. Although Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel<sup><xref rid="fn2667">4</xref></sup> said, &#x2018;Even scrolls [of Scripture] were permitted by the Rabbis to be written only in Greek&#x2019;, the Sages did not agree with him. For Rabbi related:<sup><xref rid="fn2668">5</xref></sup> It once happened that Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel was standing at the side of a building [in course of construction] on the Temple Mount, when a Targum of the book of Job was brought before him. He ordered the builder, &#x2018;Bury it under the course of stones&#x2019;. But the Sages also maintained their ruling, because we have learned in the Mishnah:<sup><xref rid="fn2669">6</xref></sup> All holy writings<sup><xref rid="fn2670">7</xref></sup> may be saved from a fire<sup><xref rid="fn2671">8</xref></sup> irrespective of whether they are used in public reading<sup><xref rid="fn2672">9</xref></sup> or not;<sup><xref rid="fn2673">10</xref></sup> and although they are written in any language, they must be stored away.<sup><xref rid="fn2674">11</xref></sup> And why do we not read [some of these scrolls]? On account of [possible] neglect of the House of Study.<sup><xref rid="fn2675">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The sheath of a scroll may be saved<sup><xref rid="fn2676">13</xref></sup> together with the scroll, and the <italic>tefillin</italic> bag together with the <italic>tefillin</italic>, although they contain money.<sup><xref rid="fn2677">14</xref></sup> To what place may one rescue them? To a closed alley.<sup><xref rid="fn2678">15</xref></sup> Ben Bathyra said: Even into an open alley.</p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. Although the Sages have said that [some of] the Holy Writings may only be read from [the Sabbath] afternoon service onwards,<sup><xref rid="fn2679">16</xref></sup> yet they may be studied and expounded. If it is necesssary [to refer to] a word,<sup><xref rid="fn2680">17</xref></sup> one may take a scroll and examine it. As regards secular documents, however, although they have ruled lines,<sup><xref rid="fn2681">18</xref></sup> it is forbidden to read them [on the Sabbath].</p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. Benedictions,<sup><xref rid="fn2682">19</xref></sup> in which many passages of the Torah were quoted,<sup><xref rid="fn2683">20</xref></sup> must not be saved from a fire [on the Sabbath].<sup><xref rid="fn2684">21</xref></sup> Hence it was declared: They who write down benedictions are like those who burn the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn2685">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>It was related of a man who wrote benedictions that R. Ishmael went to examine him. As soon as he heard the sound of R. Ishmael&#x2019;s steps, he seized a bundle of written sheets<sup><xref rid="fn2686">23</xref></sup> and threw it into a bowl of water. In the following words [did R. Ishmael] address him, &#x2018;The punishment for the latter act<sup><xref rid="fn2687">24</xref></sup> is greater than for the former&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn2688">25</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. Why did he<sup><xref rid="fn2689">26</xref></sup> so address him? On account of the passages from the Torah which were quoted in them.<sup><xref rid="fn2690">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>For<sup><xref rid="fn2691">28</xref></sup> R. Simeon b. Yo&#x1E25;ai taught: He who occupies himself with [only the study of] Scripture indulges in an indifferent practice;<sup><xref rid="fn2692">29</xref></sup> with Mishnah it is a practice for which a reward is conferred; as for one who occupies himself with <italic>Shas</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2693">30</xref></sup> there is no worthier practice, provided he had first studied Scripture and Mishnah.<sup><xref rid="fn2694">31</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. Always run to the Mishnah more than to the <italic>Shas</italic>. R. Jose b. Abin said: [The preceding Rule only applies to the time] before Rabbi had edited<sup><xref rid="fn2695">32</xref></sup> the <italic>Mishnayoth</italic>, but now that Rabbi has edited the <italic>Mishnayoth</italic> run to the Mishnah more than to the <italic>Shas</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2696">33</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>. [The Sages], however, said: Scripture has been compared to water, the Mishnah to wine, and the <italic>Shas</italic> to spiced-wine. The world cannot exist without water, it cannot exist without wine, and it cannot exist without spiced-wine; but a rich man enjoys all three of them. So, too, it is impossible for the world to exist without Scripture and without Mishnah, but it can never exist without the <italic>Shas</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2697">34</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>. The Torah<sup><xref rid="fn2698">35</xref></sup> has also been compared to salt, the Mishnah to pepper, and the <italic>Shas</italic> to spices. The world cannot exist without salt, without pepper and without spices; but the rich man enjoys all three. So, too, it is impossible for the world to exist without Scripture, without Mishnah and without the <italic>Shas</italic>.</p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>. Happy is the man whose labour is in [the study of] the <italic>Shas</italic>. Not that he should skip Scripture and the Mishnah and come [direct] to the <italic>Shas;</italic> but he should learn Scripture and Mishnah with the object of coming to the <italic>Shas</italic>. Of such a person it is stated, <italic>The rich man&#x2019;s wealth is his strong city, and as a high wall in his own conceit</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2699">36</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 10</small>. Abba Gurion of &#x1E92;adian<sup><xref rid="fn2700">37</xref></sup> said in the name of Abba Guria:<sup><xref rid="fn2701">38</xref></sup> A man should not teach his son to be an ass-driver,<sup><xref rid="fn2702">39</xref></sup> sailor, waggoner, shepherd<sup><xref rid="fn2703">40</xref></sup> or shopkeeper,<sup><xref rid="fn2704">41</xref></sup> because their occupations are robbery.<sup><xref rid="fn2705">42</xref></sup> R. Judah,<sup><xref rid="fn2706">43</xref></sup> however, quoting him,<sup><xref rid="fn2707">44</xref></sup> said: Ass-drivers are mostly wicked, but sailors are mostly pious.<sup><xref rid="fn2708">45</xref></sup> The best of physicians are [destined] for Gehinnom<sup><xref rid="fn2709">46</xref></sup> and the most worthy of butchers is Amalek&#x2019;s partner.<sup><xref rid="fn2710">47</xref></sup> Bastards are mostly keen-witted,<sup><xref rid="fn2711">48</xref></sup> slaves are mostly arrogant,<sup><xref rid="fn2712">49</xref></sup> the children of reputed parents are mostly bashful, and children usually resemble the mother&#x2019;s brother.</p>
<p>R. Simeon b. Yo&#x1E25;ai taught: Kill the best of the heathens in time of war;<sup><xref rid="fn2713">50</xref></sup> crush the brain of the best of serpents. The most worthy of women indulges in witchcraft. Happy is he who does the will of the Omnipresent.<sup><xref rid="fn2714">51</xref></sup> [41<italic>b</italic>]</p>

<ftnote id="fn2665">(2) The Hebrew square characters are described as &#x2018;Assyrian&#x2019; because they came into common use for religious writings after the return from the Babylonian exile (cf. Sanh. 21b, 22a, Sonc. ed., pp. 119ff and notes).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2672">(9) Such as the Prophets from which the <italic>haf&#x1E6D;arah</italic> is selected.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2673">(10) viz. the Hagiographa.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2674">(11) When they are worn out and no longer fit for use. Sacred writings must never be destroyed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2675">(12) On the Sabbath when lectures are delivered in the Houses of Study. By engaging in the reading of the books mentioned the public would neglect the lectures.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2676">(13) From a fire on the Sabbath.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2677">(14) Which otherwise would not be permitted to be moved.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2678">(15) Where movement on the Sabbath is less restricted than in the public domain.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2679">(16) When there are no public lectures in the Houses of Study (cf. Shab. 116b, Sonc. ed., p. 572).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2680">(17) In Shab. <italic>loc. cit.</italic> the reading is &#x2018;a verse&#x2019;.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2684">(21) They do not possess the same degree of sanctity as the scrolls of Scripture.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2690">(27) i.e. the benedictions; and could not, therefore, be saved from a fire on the Sabbath.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2691">(28) The following reason has no connection with the beginning of Rule 5. It refers back to Rule 2 above which lays down that one must not read certain books of the Scripture during the hours when lectures are delivered in the Houses of Study (N.Y.).</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2693">(30) The Heb. letters <italic>shin samek</italic>, pronounced <italic>Shas</italic>, stand for <span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05E9;&#x05D4; &#x05E1;&#x05D3;&#x05E8;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span> &#x2018;the six orders&#x2019; of the Mishnah or of the combined Mishnah and Gemara. Here it evidently refers to the Gemara only. The corresponding passage in B.M. 33a (Sonc. ed., p. 206) reads &#x2018;Gemara&#x2019;. It has been suggested that the proper reading is &#x2018;Talmud&#x2019; (cf. B.M. <italic>loc. cit.</italic>, n. 6).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2694">(31) It is accordingly proved that the study of Mishnah and Gemara, which necessarily includes the Scriptures, is of far higher importance than of Scripture only.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2695">(32) lit. &#x2018;sunk&#x2019;, an unusual verb in such a connection. [Instead of <span dir="rtl">&#x05E9;&#x05E7;&#x05E2;</span>, H mentions a MS. variant <span dir="rtl">&#x05E7;&#x05D1;&#x05E2;</span> (fixed).]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2696">(33) So N.Y. as required by the context. V, M and H read: &#x2018;run to the <italic>Shas</italic> more than to the Mishnah.&#x2019;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2697">(34) Which includes all.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2698">(35) The term here embraces the whole of the Scriptures.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2699">(36) Prov. XVIII, 11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2700">(37) i.e. Bethsaida in Galilee.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2701">(38) So GRA in agreement with &#x1E32;id. 82a (Sonc. ed., p. 423). V reads &#x2018;said&#x2019; after the first &#x2018;Gurion&#x2019; and a second &#x2018;Gurion&#x2019; for &#x2018;Guria&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2702">(39) These, when sent on a long journey, hire themselves to others and so make a profit by using the time which belongs to the original employer.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2703">(40) He feeds his flock in other persons&#x2019; fields.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2704">(41) He gives false measure or sells adulterated goods.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2705">(42) The descriptions are no doubt a reflection of the standards of the time.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2706">(43) Differing from Abba Gurion.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2707">(44) Abba Guria.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2708">(45) The perils of the sea turn their thoughts to God.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2709">(46) Because they may be guilty of causing loss of life through neglect or over-confidence; or, by trusting too much in their own skill, they deny the power of God [with this passage, cf. ARN XXXVI, 5, and notes].</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2710">(47) In his desire to avoid financial loss, he sells unwholesome meat and thereby spreads disease. &#x2018;Amalek&#x2019; is the type of Israel&#x2019;s enemies.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2711">(48) They are like their cunning fathers who enticed their mothers.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2712">(49) Reading <span dir="rtl">&#x05D2;&#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span> with GRA. V, M and H have <span dir="rtl">&#x05E0;&#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span>, &#x2018;beautiful&#x2019;, an improbable reading.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2713">(50) [For the various forms of this saying, cf. Bacher, <italic>Ag. d. Tannaiten</italic> II, p. 86, n. 3. The qualifying phrase &#x2018;in the time of war&#x2019; he regards as a later addition to soften the harshness of the utterance. It was called forth in a time of bitter oppression and is not to be taken as typical of Jewish ethics. On the subject, cf. J. S. Bloch, <italic>Israel and the Nations</italic>, pp. 204ff.]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2714">(51) Because he is delivered from all worldly temptations.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER XVI</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. R. Nehorai said: I abandon all professions in the world and teach my son only Torah,<sup><xref rid="fn2715">1</xref></sup> because a man enjoys part of its reward in this world while the principal remains intact for the world to come. The other professions, however, are not so. For should a person come to sickness, old age or suffering and is unable to carry on his work, he would die of starvation; whereas with the Torah it is not so, but it protects him from all evil in his youth and gives him a future and hope in his old age. What does it say in Scripture of his youth? <italic>But they that wait for the Lord shall renew their strength</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2716">2</xref></sup> And what does it say of his old age? <italic>They shall still bring forth fruit in old age</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2717">3</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. R. Joshua b. Levi said: With regard to the <italic>&#x2019;aggadta</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2718">4</xref></sup> he who writes it down has no share in the world to come,<sup><xref rid="fn2719">5</xref></sup> he who expounds it<sup><xref rid="fn2720">6</xref></sup> is cursed,<sup><xref rid="fn2721">7</xref></sup> while he who listens to it receives no reward.</p>
<p>R. &#x1E24;innena b. Papa taught:<sup><xref rid="fn2722">8</xref></sup> <italic>The Lord spoke with you face to face</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2723">9</xref></sup>&#x2014;<italic>face</italic> implies two,<sup><xref rid="fn2724">10</xref></sup> <italic>to face</italic> also implies two, thus providing four expressions of &#x2018;face&#x2019; [alluding to] Scripture,<sup><xref rid="fn2725">11</xref></sup> Mishnah, <italic>halakoth</italic> and <italic>&#x2019;aggadoth;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2726">12</xref></sup> an awestruck face for Scripture, a neutral face for Mishnah, a friendly<sup><xref rid="fn2727">13</xref></sup> face for <italic>Shas</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2728">14</xref></sup> and a smiling<sup><xref rid="fn2729">15</xref></sup> face for <italic>&#x2019;aggadta</italic>.</p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. R. Nehemiah, in the name of R. Jacob b. Jannai, remarked on the text, <italic>As in water face answereth to face:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2730">16</xref></sup> It is customary to have a master who desires to teach and a student who does not want to learn, or a student who desires to learn and a master who does not want to teach him; but in this case<sup><xref rid="fn2731">17</xref></sup> the Master desires to teach and the student to learn.<sup><xref rid="fn2732">18</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. R. Isaac Nappa&#x1E25;a began his discourse as follows: <italic>Stay me with dainties</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2733">19</xref></sup> refers to the well-founded<sup><xref rid="fn2734">20</xref></sup> <italic>halakoth; refresh me with apples</italic> refers to the <italic>&#x2019;aggadoth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2735">21</xref></sup> whose fragrance is pleasant like that of apples. <italic>For I am love-sick</italic>&#x2014;R. Isaac said: In the past when money was plentiful<sup><xref rid="fn2736">22</xref></sup> one longed to hear a word of the <italic>halakah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2737">23</xref></sup> but now that money is scarce<sup><xref rid="fn2738">24</xref></sup> one longs to hear<sup><xref rid="fn2739">25</xref></sup> a word of <italic>&#x2019;aggadah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2740">26</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. R. Tan&#x1E25;um b. &#x1E24;anilai said: If the Torah had been given as a clear-cut code,<sup><xref rid="fn2741">27</xref></sup> no judge would have a <italic>locus standi</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2742">28</xref></sup> in laying down a ruling;<sup><xref rid="fn2743">29</xref></sup> but now a judge has a <italic>locus standi</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2744">30</xref></sup> for if he declares a thing to be clean there are [authorities] who declare a thing in a similar condition to be unclean, and if he decides that it is unclean there are [authorities] who declare a thing in a similar condition to be clean.<sup><xref rid="fn2745">31</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. R. Jannai said: The Torah which the Holy One, blessed be He, gave to Moses was delivered to him in forty-nine aspects of uncleanness and forty-nine aspects of cleanness,<sup><xref rid="fn2746">32</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>And his banner</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2747">33</xref></sup> (<italic>wediglo</italic>), the numerical value of its letters being forty-nine.</p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>. R. Abahu said in the name of R. Jo&#x1E25;anan: R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba had a distinguished<sup><xref rid="fn2748">34</xref></sup> disciple who knew how to interpret the Torah in forty-nine aspects of uncleanness and forty-nine aspects of cleanness, not one reason being the same as another.<sup><xref rid="fn2749">35</xref></sup> Consequently<sup><xref rid="fn2750">36</xref></sup> if those who rule a thing to be unclean are in the majority it is unclean, and if those who rule a thing to be clean are in the majority it is clean.<sup><xref rid="fn2751">37</xref></sup> Whence [did he learn] all these? [From his extensive studies], because he was learned in the Scriptures, expert in the Mishnah, distinguished in Talmud and brilliant<sup><xref rid="fn2752">38</xref></sup> in <italic>&#x2019;aggadah</italic>.</p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>. It was related of R. Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Zakkai that he did not neglect the study of a single passage of the Torah.<sup><xref rid="fn2753">39</xref></sup> He also studied [all] Scripture,<sup><xref rid="fn2754">40</xref></sup> Targum, Mishnah, <italic>halakoth</italic> and <italic>&#x2019;aggadoth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2755">41</xref></sup> He learned everything. It was also related of him that he declared, &#x2018;If all the heavens were sheets, all the trees quills and all the seas ink, they would not suffice for recording my wisdom which I acquired from my masters; and yet I have gained<sup><xref rid="fn2756">42</xref></sup> no more of the wisdom of the Sages than a fly [acquires] which dips in the great sea and deprives it of the tiniest drop&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn2757">43</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>. From whom did he<sup><xref rid="fn2758">44</xref></sup> receive the Torah? From Hillel and Shammai. It was said of Hillel that he had not omitted to study any of the words of the Sages, even all languages, even the speech of mountains, hills and valleys, the speech of trees and herbs, the speech of wild beasts and cattle, the speech of demons<sup><xref rid="fn2759">45</xref></sup> and parables. Why [did he study] all these? Because it is stated, <italic>The Lord was pleased, for His righteousness&#x2019; sake, to make the teaching great and glorious</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2760">46</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 10</small>. R. Joshua b. Levi said: I have never looked into a book of <italic>&#x2019;aggadta</italic> except once when I looked and found written therein that the one hundred and seventy-five sections of the Torah,<sup><xref rid="fn2761">47</xref></sup> in which occurs any expression of speaking, saying or commanding, correspond to the number of years of our father Abraham;<sup><xref rid="fn2762">48</xref></sup> for it is written, <italic>Thou hast ascended on high, Thou hast led captivity captive; Thou hast received gifts</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2763">49</xref></sup> <italic>for the sake of the man</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2764">50</xref></sup> and it is also written, <italic>The greatest man</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2765">51</xref></sup> <italic>among the Anakim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2766">52</xref></sup> On this account the Rabbis instituted one hundred and seventy-five orders in the Torah [to be read in public worship] every Sabbath<sup><xref rid="fn2767">53</xref></sup> [as regularly as the] continual burnt-offering.<sup><xref rid="fn2768">54</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 11</small>. The hundred and forty-seven psalms<sup><xref rid="fn2769">55</xref></sup> included in the Book of Psalms correspond to the number of years of Jacob.<sup><xref rid="fn2770">56</xref></sup> This is intended to teach you that all the praises which Israel offer to the Holy One, blessed be He, correspond to the number of years of our father Jacob. What is the reason?<sup><xref rid="fn2771">57</xref></sup> [Scripture states,] <italic>Yet Thou art holy, O Thou that art enthroned upon the praises of Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2772">58</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 12</small>. The hundred and twenty-three times that Israel respond with <italic>Halleluyah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2773">59</xref></sup> correspond to the number of years of Aaron.<sup><xref rid="fn2774">60</xref></sup> What is the reason?<sup><xref rid="fn2775">61</xref></sup> [Scripture states,] <italic>Halleluyah, praise God be&#x1E33;odsho</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2776">62</xref></sup> which [is interpreted as] &#x2018;with His holy man&#x2019;, i.e. Aaron, the holy man of God.</p>
<p>Nevertheless<sup><xref rid="fn2777">63</xref></sup> I was afraid at night.<sup><xref rid="fn2778">64</xref></sup></p>

An adult, however, who reads portions of the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic> may say &#x2018;Holy&#x2019; because it is in the order [of the Biblical text];<sup><xref rid="fn2783">69</xref></sup> but as for the &#x2018;Holy&#x2019; of the <italic>&#x2018;Amidah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2784">70</xref></sup> since he would have to say &#x2018;We will reverence and sanctify Thee&#x2019;,<sup><xref rid="fn2785">71</xref></sup> it is not proper for him to say it if less than ten adults are present. A minor, furthermore, may not be counted in the quorum of ten<sup><xref rid="fn2786">72</xref></sup> for <italic>Bareku</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2787">73</xref></sup> the reading of the Torah and <italic>&#x1E33;addish</italic> until he is thirteen years of age; but no examination<sup><xref rid="fn2788">74</xref></sup> is carried out in such cases.<sup><xref rid="fn2789">75</xref></sup>.</p>

<p><small>RULE 1</small>. <italic>The words of the wise are as goads &#x2026; they are given from one shepherd;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2790">1</xref></sup> and one Shepherd<sup><xref rid="fn2791">2</xref></sup> has uttered them. Therefore they must be saved from a fire.<sup><xref rid="fn2792">3</xref></sup> A book of the <italic>&#x2019;aggadta</italic>, although not allowed to be written, must nevertheless be saved from a fire. What is the reason? <italic>It is a time to work for the Lord; they have made void Thy law</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2793">4</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. [The sequence of the Sabbath readings] is interrupted<sup><xref rid="fn2794">5</xref></sup> for New Moons, <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah, Purim</italic>, fasts, <italic>ma&#x2018;amadoth</italic> and the Day of Atonement.<sup><xref rid="fn2795">6</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. In what manner are the interruptions made if the New Moon or the days of <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> fall on a Sabbath? [In the former case] seven persons read the regular Sabbath section while the eighth reads that of the New Moon, viz. the two portions<sup><xref rid="fn2796">7</xref></sup> <italic>And on the sabbath day</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2797">8</xref></sup> and <italic>And in your new moons;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2798">9</xref></sup> and if the first day of <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2799">10</xref></sup> falls on a Sabbath, seven read [the section] of the Sabbath while the eighth reads, <italic>And it came to pass on the day that Moses had made an end</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2800">11</xref></sup> up to <italic>so he made the candlestick</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2801">12</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. [42<italic>a</italic>] What<sup><xref rid="fn2802">13</xref></sup> is the procedure on <italic>Purim?</italic> If <italic>Purim</italic> falls on a Sabbath, seven read [the section] of the Sabbath while the eighth reads <italic>Then came Amalek</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2803">14</xref></sup> The three fast days<sup><xref rid="fn2804">15</xref></sup> are not observed on consecutive days but are separated [and observed] on Monday, Thursday and Monday. Our Rabbis in the land of Israel had the custom of fasting after <italic>Purim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2805">16</xref></sup> on account of [the victory over] Nicanor and his associates,<sup><xref rid="fn2806">17</xref></sup> and also because the commemoration of sad events is postponed rather than antedated.</p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. [What was the procedure in the case of] <italic>ma&#x2018;amadoth?</italic> As it was taught:<sup><xref rid="fn2807">18</xref></sup> The men of the <italic>ma&#x2018;amadoth</italic> used to fast [as follows]: On every Monday for the sake of those who sail on the sea, as it is written, <italic>And God said: Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2808">19</xref></sup> on Tuesdays for the sake of wayfarers, as it is written, <italic>And God said: Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2809">20</xref></sup> on Wednesdays for the sake of children that they should not be attacked by croup, as it is written, <italic>And God said: Let there be lights</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2810">21</xref></sup> the written form being defective;<sup><xref rid="fn2811">22</xref></sup> on Thursdays they fasted for the sake of pregnant women and nursing mothers that they should not lose their children, as it is said, <italic>And God said: Let the waters swarm with swarms</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2812">23</xref></sup> On the Sabbath eve and at the conclusion of the Sabbath<sup><xref rid="fn2813">24</xref></sup> they did not fast from respect for the Sabbath. Some declare<sup><xref rid="fn2814">25</xref></sup> that at the twilight of the Sabbath eve an additional soul is given to every Israelite, and after the Sabbath it is taken from him.<sup><xref rid="fn2815">26</xref></sup> Another reason<sup><xref rid="fn2816">27</xref></sup> is that Christians<sup><xref rid="fn2817">28</xref></sup> should not say, &#x2018;Because we rejoice on the Sunday they fast on it&#x2019;. The Sages, however, said: In the period of the <italic>ma&#x2018;amadoth</italic> they were not concerned with the hatred of the Christians, but the reason is that it is written <italic>He ceased from work wayyinnafash</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2818">29</xref></sup> [which is homiletically interpreted] <italic>wai &#x2018;al nefesh</italic>, &#x2018;Woe for [the loss of the additional] soul&#x2019;.</p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. On Passover we read from the section of the Festivals in Leviticus;<sup><xref rid="fn2819">30</xref></sup> on Pentecost <italic>Seven weeks;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2820">31</xref></sup> on New Year <italic>In the seventh month on the first day of the month;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2821">32</xref></sup> on the Day of Atonement <italic>After the death</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2822">33</xref></sup> On the first day of Tabernacles we read from the section of the Festivals in Leviticus,<sup><xref rid="fn2823">34</xref></sup> and on the other days of Tabernacles the section of the offerings of the Festival.<sup><xref rid="fn2824">35</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>. On <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> we read the section of [the dedication of the altar by] the princes;<sup><xref rid="fn2825">36</xref></sup> on <italic>Purim, Then came Amalek;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2826">37</xref></sup> on the New Moon, <italic>And in your new moons;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2827">38</xref></sup> at the <italic>ma&#x2018;amadoth</italic> the account of the creation.<sup><xref rid="fn2828">39</xref></sup> On the fast days of the Ninth of <italic>Ab</italic> and the last seven days in connection with droughts,<sup><xref rid="fn2829">40</xref></sup> we read the section of the blessings and curses;<sup><xref rid="fn2830">41</xref></sup> but on other fast days <italic>And Moses besought</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2831">42</xref></sup> and we read as the <italic>haf&#x1E6D;arah Seek ye the Lord</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2832">43</xref></sup> Some say that no <italic>haf&#x1E6D;arah</italic> is to be read, but the people have adopted the custom of reading the <italic>haf&#x1E6D;arah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2833">44</xref></sup> There must be no break in the section of curses because it is not proper to end with curses and to begin with curses.<sup><xref rid="fn2834">45</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>. On Mondays and Thursdays and at the Sabbath afternoon service the regular portion of the week is read, and this is not reckoned as a part of the reading [for the succeeding Sabbath].<sup><xref rid="fn2835">46</xref></sup> [The reason<sup><xref rid="fn2836">47</xref></sup> is] because it is stated, <italic>And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the appointed seasons of the Lord</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2837">48</xref></sup> which implies that it is an ordinance that each [appointed section] shall be read in its season. Hence [the Rabbis] said: [The sequence of the readings] is interrupted for them all&#x2014;for New Moons, <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah, Purim</italic>, fasts, <italic>ma&#x2018;amadoth</italic> and the Day of Atonement,<sup><xref rid="fn2838">49</xref></sup> irrespective of whether these occur on a Sabbath, a Monday or Thursday, on which days there exists a regular sequence of readings.<sup><xref rid="fn2839">50</xref></sup> This sequence is interrupted<sup><xref rid="fn2840">51</xref></sup> and the [special sections] are read. You cannot, however, say of fasts or <italic>ma&#x2018;amadoth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2841">52</xref></sup> that they would fall on a Sabbath in order [to lay down the rule that] the normal sequence of the Sabbath [readings] is interrupted on their account. [For these can interrupt the sequence] of a Monday or Thursday only.</p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>. When a New Moon falls on the Sabbath, the eighth person who has to read <italic>And on the sabbath day</italic> and <italic>And in the beginnings of your months</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2842">53</xref></sup> also reads, as the <italic>haf&#x1E6D;arah, Thus said the Lord God: The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2843">54</xref></sup> If [the New Moon] falls on a Sunday, he<sup><xref rid="fn2844">55</xref></sup> reads on the Sabbath preceding the New Moon <italic>And Jonathan said unto him: To-morrow is the new moon</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2845">56</xref></sup> On the New Moon itself, three persons read the section of the continual offering. The first person reads, <italic>And &#x2026; spoke</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2846">57</xref></sup> <italic>Command</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2847">58</xref></sup> <italic>And thou shalt say</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2848">59</xref></sup> The second person reads, <italic>The one lamb</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2849">60</xref></sup> <italic>And the tenth part</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2850">61</xref></sup> <italic>It is a continual burnt-offering</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2851">62</xref></sup> <italic>And the drink-offering thereof</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2852">63</xref></sup> <italic>And the other lamb</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2853">64</xref></sup> The third person repeats and reads, <italic>It is a continual burnt-offering, And the drink-offering, And the other lamb, And on the sabbath day</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2854">65</xref></sup> <italic>This is the burnt-offering of every sabbath</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2855">66</xref></sup> [The reason for this arrangement is] because [the Rabbis] ruled that it is not permitted to read less than three verses in a section nor<sup><xref rid="fn2856">67</xref></sup> is it permissible to leave unfinished less than three verses at the end of a section.<sup><xref rid="fn2857">68</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 10</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn2858">69</xref></sup> If two verses were read,<sup><xref rid="fn2859">70</xref></sup> and another section was begun,<sup><xref rid="fn2860">71</xref></sup> there must be no stop before three verses of the latter were read. And since [the third person] reads, &#x2026; <italic>burnt-offering, And the drink-offering thereof, And the other lamb, And on the sabbath day, This is the burnt-offering of &#x2026; sabbath</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2861">72</xref></sup> it follows that the third person reads five verses,<sup><xref rid="fn2862">73</xref></sup> while [the next] one reads the whole section of the New Moon, <italic>And in the beginnings of your months</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2863">74</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 11</small>. On the New Moon it is necessary to say after <italic>May the glory</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2864">75</xref></sup> the following: <italic>The Lord reigneth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2865">76</xref></sup> <italic>O sing unto the Lord a new song;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2866">77</xref></sup> and after that, <italic>O give thanks unto the Lord, call upon His name</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2867">78</xref></sup> and the six daily psalms;<sup><xref rid="fn2868">79</xref></sup> for<sup><xref rid="fn2869">80</xref></sup> R. Jose said, &#x2018;May my lot be among those who include in their daily prayers<sup><xref rid="fn2870">81</xref></sup> those six psalms&#x2019;. It has also been stated: Why did David mention Abraham, Isaac and Jacob<sup><xref rid="fn2871">82</xref></sup> in the psalm beginning, <italic>O give thanks unto the Lord, call upon His name?</italic> Because it has to be said daily.</p>

Simeon b. La&#x1E33;ish asked him, &#x2018;Which is first, the psalm<sup><xref rid="fn2879">8</xref></sup> or the additional sacrifice?&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn2880">9</xref></sup> He replied,<sup><xref rid="fn2881">10</xref></sup> &#x2018;It is obvious that the psalm is read first&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn2882">11</xref></sup> For this reason<sup><xref rid="fn2883">12</xref></sup> the people have adopted the custom of saying psalms<sup><xref rid="fn2884">13</xref></sup> at their proper times;<sup><xref rid="fn2885">14</xref></sup> as we have learned in the Mishnah:<sup><xref rid="fn2886">15</xref></sup> &#x2018;These were the psalms which the Levites used to recite in the Temple: On Sunday<sup><xref rid="fn2887">16</xref></sup> they used to recite, <italic>The earth is the Lord&#x2019;s, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2888">17</xref></sup> On Monday, <italic>Great is the Lord, and exceedingly to be praised</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2889">18</xref></sup> etc. On Tuesday, <italic>God standeth in the congregation of God</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2890">19</xref></sup> etc. On Wednesday, <italic>O Lord, Thou God to whom vengeance belongeth</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2891">20</xref></sup> etc. On Thursday, <italic>Sing aloud unto God our strength</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2892">21</xref></sup> etc. On Friday, <italic>The Lord reigneth; He is clothed in majesty</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2893">22</xref></sup> On the Sabbath, <italic>A psalm, a Song. For the sabbath day</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2894">23</xref></sup> [which is the psalm and song also]<sup><xref rid="fn2895">24</xref></sup> for the hereafter, for the day which will be wholly a Sabbath and [will bring] rest in life everlasting&#x2019;. For whoever makes mention of a Biblical verse at its proper time is regarded [by God] as though he had built a new altar and offered a sacrifice upon it.</p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. On <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> [the psalm is] <italic>I will extol Thee, O Lord</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2896">25</xref></sup> On <italic>Purim</italic> it is <italic>Shiggaion of David</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2897">26</xref></sup> but others say it is <italic>O God, keep not Thou silence</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2898">27</xref></sup> On the first day of Passover it is, <italic>Praise ye the name of the Lord</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2899">28</xref></sup> and the same [is said during] the intermediate days of the Festival; but on the first [two] days of Passover one must [also] say <italic>May the glory of the Lord</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2900">29</xref></sup> while all the people stand. Then<sup><xref rid="fn2901">30</xref></sup> they sit and say all the prescribed psalms<sup><xref rid="fn2902">31</xref></sup> up to <italic>And blessed be His glorious name for ever;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2903">32</xref></sup> but on the last day of Passover the Great <italic>Hallel</italic> is said. And what is the Great <italic>Hallel?</italic> [42<italic>b</italic>] <italic>O give thanks unto the Lord, for He is good &#x2026; O give thanks unto the God of gods</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2904">33</xref></sup> The people have adopted the custom of saying the Great <italic>Hallel</italic>, although this is not the proper thing to do.<sup><xref rid="fn2905">34</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. On the Feast of Weeks<sup><xref rid="fn2906">35</xref></sup> [the psalm is] <italic>Ascribe unto the Lord, O ye sons of might</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2907">36</xref></sup> On the ninth day of <italic>Ab</italic> [the reading consists] of four verses of Jeremiah, <italic>Hast Thou utterly rejected Judah?</italic> to <italic>For Thou hast made all these things</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2908">37</xref></sup> and the following two psalms, <italic>O God, the heathen are come into Thine inheritance</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2909">38</xref></sup> and <italic>By the rivers of Babylon</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2910">39</xref></sup> Although it is usual<sup><xref rid="fn2911">40</xref></sup> to give precedence to the Holy Words<sup><xref rid="fn2912">41</xref></sup> over the words of [prophetical] traditions,<sup><xref rid="fn2913">42</xref></sup> in this case the latter<sup><xref rid="fn2914">43</xref></sup> takes precedence over the former.<sup><xref rid="fn2915">44</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. Some [congregations] read the Book of Lamentations in the evening<sup><xref rid="fn2916">45</xref></sup> while others postpone it to the [following] morning after the reading of the Torah, when the reader<sup><xref rid="fn2917">46</xref></sup> stands up, his head covered with ashes, his clothes torn,<sup><xref rid="fn2918">47</xref></sup> and reads it with weeping and lamentation. If he is able to translate it, well and good; but if he is unable he entrusts it to one who knows how to translate properly and [that person] does the translation, so that the rest of the people, the women and children may understand it; in that women are obliged to listen to the reading of the Book, how much more so does it apply to men.</p>
<p>Women have similarly the duty to read the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic>, the [<italic>&#x2018;Amidah</italic>] prayer and the Grace after meals, and to have a <italic>mezuzah</italic> [on their doors]. But if they are not acquainted with the holy tongue they are to be taught [to say them] in any language which they can understand and master. From this it was deduced that the man who recites the benedictions<sup><xref rid="fn2919">48</xref></sup> must raise his voice for the benefit of his young sons, his wife and daughters. It is, therefore, a logical deduction that every section of the Torah and the Prophet [prescribed for the readings] of the Sabbath should be translated for the people, the women and the children after the reading of the Torah. This is why it was ruled: On the Sabbath the people come [to the Synagogue] early and depart late. They come early to read the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic>, like the pious men of old, with the first glimpse of the sun; and they depart late to listen to the interpretation of the weekly section. On a Festival, however, they come late, because they have to prepare the food for the day;<sup><xref rid="fn2920">49</xref></sup> and they hasten to depart because it is unreasonable to interpret [the Torah or the Prophet] for them, it having been stated: Rab did not appoint an interpreter from [the beginning of the first day of] the Festival to the conclusion of the second day.<sup><xref rid="fn2921">50</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. There was likewise a beautiful custom in Jerusalem to train<sup><xref rid="fn2922">51</xref></sup> their young sons and daughters to afflict themselves on a fast day:<sup><xref rid="fn2923">52</xref></sup> at the age of eleven to the middle of the day, at the age of twelve the full day, and at the age of thirteen [the boy] was taken round<sup><xref rid="fn2924">53</xref></sup> and presented to every elder to bless him and pray for him that he may be worthy to study the Torah and engage in good deeds. In like manner,<sup><xref rid="fn2925">54</xref></sup> everyone who had a man superior to him in the town would rise from his place and go and bow down to him [requesting] that he pray on his behalf. This is meant to teach us that they<sup><xref rid="fn2926">55</xref></sup> were splendid men and their deeds were splendid, and that their hearts [were directed] towards Heaven. Furthermore, they did not leave their young children behind but took them to the Synagogue to encourage them in the performance of the precepts.</p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. On the day when R. Eleazar b. &#x2018;Azariah was appointed head of the academy, he began his discourse by saying: <italic>Ye are standing this day all of you &#x2026; your little ones, your wives</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2927">56</xref></sup> the men came to listen, the women came to receive a reward for their journey,<sup><xref rid="fn2928">57</xref></sup> but why did the little ones come? That a reward may be given to those who bring them. From this the young daughters of Israel learnt the practice of coming to the Synagogue so that a reward may be granted to those who bring them while they would [in due course]<sup><xref rid="fn2929">58</xref></sup> also receive their reward.<sup><xref rid="fn2930">59</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn2931">60</xref></sup> The reader on the Ninth of <italic>Ab</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2932">61</xref></sup> says,<sup><xref rid="fn2933">62</xref></sup> &#x2018;Blessed &#x2026; the true Judge&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn2934">63</xref></sup> Some place the Torah scroll<sup><xref rid="fn2935">64</xref></sup> on the ground in a black wrapping and say, <italic>The crown is fallen from our head</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2936">65</xref></sup> The reading and the lamentations are carried out as with a man whose dead lies before him. Some change their [customary] places [in the Synagogue]; others descend from their benches, and all of them roll in ashes and do not greet one another throughout the night and also throughout the day until the people have finished their lamentations. During the recital of the lamentations it is forbidden to speak [any irrelevant] word, or to go outside [the Synagogue], lest one&#x2019;s mind be diverted from the mourning; and it is obvious that no conversation with a Gentile is permitted.<sup><xref rid="fn2937">66</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>. In the evening service<sup><xref rid="fn2938">67</xref></sup> no one can hear the other, because all pray in a whisper;<sup><xref rid="fn2939">68</xref></sup> therefore we say neither &#x2018;Bless ye&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn2940">69</xref></sup> nor &#x2018;[Blessed] be the name&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn2941">70</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn2878">(7) Ps. XCIV, 23. As this Psalm was prescribed normally for Wednesdays (in connection with the sacrifices and libations of the day) but was said on these two occasions on the Sunday (for which a different Psalm had been arranged), it follows that the recital of a particular Psalm is independent of the sacrifices or libations of the day. It was ordained, therefore, that the Psalm for the New Moon, originally prescribed for the Temple service, should also be said at the present time (cf. N.Y.).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2879">(8) Which was said in connection with the morning continual offering.</ftnote>

Rab&#x2019;s reason was that, owing to the legitimate indulgence on the Festival days, his mind might not be clear to impart the proper instruction or to give the necessary guidance to the public through the interpreter.

<title>CHAPTER XIX</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. In the morning service,<sup><xref rid="fn2942">1</xref></sup> however,<sup><xref rid="fn2943">2</xref></sup> after the psalms and the Scriptural verses, [the reader] in the <italic>Yo&#x1E93;er</italic> benediction<sup><xref rid="fn2944">3</xref></sup> says &#x2018;Bless ye&#x2019; in a low voice; but neither &#x2018;Holy&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn2945">4</xref></sup> nor <italic>&#x1E33;addish</italic> is to be recited. In the afternoon prayer, however, both &#x2018;Holy&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn2946">5</xref></sup> and <italic>&#x1E33;addish</italic> are said.</p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn2947">6</xref></sup> And on the New Year we say, <italic>O clap your hands, all ye peoples;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2948">7</xref></sup> on the Day of Atonement <italic>Bless the Lord, O my soul</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2949">8</xref></sup> and <italic>Out of the depths have I called Thee, O Lord;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2950">9</xref></sup> on the Festival of Tabernacles <italic>In Judah is God known;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2951">10</xref></sup> on the Eighth Day [of Solemn Assembly] <italic>For the Leader &#x2026; on the Sheminith</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn2952">11</xref></sup> If one is not conversant with these psalms, he says I <italic>will give thanks unto the Lord with my whole heart</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2953">12</xref></sup> and that suffices.</p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. On Passover, both in the [<italic>&#x2018;Amidah</italic>] prayer<sup><xref rid="fn2954">13</xref></sup> and over the cup of wine<sup><xref rid="fn2955">14</xref></sup> one must mention &#x2018;On this Festival of holy convocation, this day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread&#x2019;; and during the intermediate days of the Festival &#x2018;This Festival of Unleavened Bread&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn2956">15</xref></sup> On the seventh day one says<sup><xref rid="fn2957">16</xref></sup> &#x2018;On the Seventh Day of Solemn Assembly&#x2019;, but no mention is made of &#x2018;Festival&#x2019; since it is not an independent Festival.<sup><xref rid="fn2958">17</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. On the Feast of Weeks<sup><xref rid="fn2959">18</xref></sup> one says &#x2018;On this Festival of holy convocation and this day of the Feast of Weeks&#x2019;. The evening, morning and afternoon services consist of the same prayers.<sup><xref rid="fn2960">19</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. On the New Moon of <italic>Nisan</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2961">20</xref></sup> one must mention<sup><xref rid="fn2962">21</xref></sup> &#x2018;On this day of the New Moon&#x2019;; and on the New Year &#x2018;On this Festival of holy convocation,<sup><xref rid="fn2963">22</xref></sup> this day of the New Year, this Day of Memorial, a day of blowing the <italic>Shofar</italic>&#x2019;, concluding with<sup><xref rid="fn2964">23</xref></sup> &#x2018;King over all the earth, Who sanctifiest Israel and the Day of Memorial and the Seasons&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn2965">24</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. On the Day of Atonement no mention is made<sup><xref rid="fn2966">25</xref></sup> of &#x2018;on the Festival Day&#x2019;, because there is no Festival on a fast day; but one says, &#x2018;On this day of holy convocation, on this day of the Fast of the Tenth,<sup><xref rid="fn2967">26</xref></sup> on this day of pardoning of iniquity&#x2019;, concluding with<sup><xref rid="fn2968">27</xref></sup> &#x2018;pardonest and forgivest our iniquities and the iniquities of Thy people Israel in mercy, and grantest remission for their transgressions, King over all the earth, Who sanctifiest Israel and the day of the Fast of Atonement, and the Seasons and the holy convocation&#x2019;; but no mention is made of Festival and joy since there is no joy without par-taking of food.</p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>. As we laud [God] on the first day, the intermediate days and the last day<sup><xref rid="fn2969">28</xref></sup> of the Festival, so we laud Him [on the other] Festivals in the morning,<sup><xref rid="fn2970">29</xref></sup> afternoon and evening prayers.<sup><xref rid="fn2971">30</xref></sup> And how is He lauded&#x0021; &#x2018;Our God and the God of our fathers, do Thou make the glory of Thy kingdom manifest upon us&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn2972">31</xref></sup> This is followed by, &#x2018;We pray Thee, O Lord our God,<sup><xref rid="fn2973">32</xref></sup> may &#x2026; rise and come,<sup><xref rid="fn2974">33</xref></sup> etc. Bestow upon us&#x2019;;<sup><xref rid="fn2975">34</xref></sup> and the conclusion of the prayer is, &#x2018;Blessed art Thou Who sanctifiest Thy people Israel, the Festival of joy, the Seasons and the holy convocation&#x2019;.</p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>. As the concluding words [of the benedictions] of the New Year and the Day of Atonement are different from those of other Festivals, so are the prayers of these days; and we do not include &#x2018;remembrance&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn2976">35</xref></sup> either in the first three<sup><xref rid="fn2977">36</xref></sup> or last three<sup><xref rid="fn2978">37</xref></sup> [benedictions of the <italic>&#x2018;Amidah</italic>] except only on the two Festival days of the New Year and Day of Atonement<sup><xref rid="fn2979">38</xref></sup> and, even with these, permission was given with difficulty.<sup><xref rid="fn2980">39</xref></sup> If the New Year falls on a Sabbath, one does not say &#x2018;A day of blowing the <italic>Shofar</italic>&#x2019; but &#x2018;a day of remembrance of blowing the <italic>Shofar</italic>&#x2019;, because the blowing of the <italic>Shofar</italic> does not take precedence of the Sabbath in country towns,<sup><xref rid="fn2981">40</xref></sup> this being a preventive measure.<sup><xref rid="fn2982">41</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>. On the New Moon,<sup><xref rid="fn2983">42</xref></sup> the associations of elders, leaders and students were assembled in session<sup><xref rid="fn2984">43</xref></sup> from the time of the afternoon service onwards until the sun had set and the moon appeared in the night [sky].<sup><xref rid="fn2985">44</xref></sup> It is necessary to say [after the ceremonial meal] in the benediction over the wine,<sup><xref rid="fn2986">45</xref></sup> &#x2018;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, Who createst the fruit of the vine. Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, Who hast revealed the secret of the renewal of the moon, Who didst instruct and teach us<sup><xref rid="fn2987">46</xref></sup> the [courses of] the seasons, New Moons and Festivals<sup><xref rid="fn2988">47</xref></sup> and Who didst appoint men of understanding who determine the times [of the New Moons and Festivals]. Thou, our Rock, hast weighed and calculated the minutest divisions of time whereby those New Moons and Festivals are determined, as it is written, <italic>Who appointedst the moon for seasons; the sun knoweth his going down</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn2989">48</xref></sup> and it also states, <italic>For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make</italic>&#x2019;;<sup><xref rid="fn2990">49</xref></sup> and one concludes with &#x2018;Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who sanctifiest Israel and the New Moons&#x2019;. [Then one says,] &#x2018;O give thanks unto the Lord for He is good; on this day we all in Jerusalem rejoice and are happy in the All-present. May Elijah the prophet soon come to us; may the king Messiah cause to spring forth in our days the [happy] time like the years<sup><xref rid="fn2991">50</xref></sup> when the Temple will be rebuilt, and may joyous occasions multiply in Israel&#x2019;; and the people answer and say &#x2018;Amen&#x2019;. [The prayer is then continued,] &#x2018;May good tidings multiply in Israel, may happy days multiply in Israel, may disciples of the Torah multiply in Israel. Consecrated is the New Moon, consecrated at the beginning of the month, consecrated in its proper time, consecrated in its intercalation,<sup><xref rid="fn2992">51</xref></sup> consecrated according to<sup><xref rid="fn2993">52</xref></sup> the Torah, consecrated according to the <italic>halakah</italic>, consecrated in the celestial regions, consecrated in the terrestrial regions, consecrated in the land of Israel, consecrated in Zion, consecrated in Jerusalem, consecrated in all the habitations of Israel, consecrated by the order of our Rabbis, consecrated in the House of Assembly. O give thanks unto the Lord for He is good&#x2019;. Then [the reader] says, &#x2018;You are all blessed&#x2019;. After every benediction, moreover, [the reader] says, &#x2018;O give thanks unto the Lord for He is good&#x2019;, except after the benedictions of the Levites.<sup><xref rid="fn2994">53</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 10</small>. When he<sup><xref rid="fn2995">54</xref></sup> sings the praises of God he does so in the presence of the twelve notable men<sup><xref rid="fn2996">55</xref></sup> of the town and twelve <italic>&#x1E25;aberim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn2997">56</xref></sup> corresponding to the twelve tribes, the twelve months and the twelve constellations.</p>
<p><small>RULE 11</small>. Although [in the Grace after meals the prayer] &#x2018;May &#x2026; rise and come&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn2998">57</xref></sup> has been said in [the benediction concluding with] &#x2018;rebuildest Jerusalem&#x2019; and all<sup><xref rid="fn2999">58</xref></sup> the benediction of <italic>zimmun</italic> has been said over the cup<sup><xref rid="fn3000">59</xref></sup> [of wine], that cup being passed on to one&#x2019;s wife<sup><xref rid="fn3001">60</xref></sup> to fulfil that which is stated, <italic>To cause a blessing to rest on thy house</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3002">61</xref></sup> nevertheless another cup of wine is brought over which is said the benediction &#x2018;Who createst the fruit of the vine&#x2019; and afterwards &#x2018;Who didst reveal&#x2019;, etc.<sup><xref rid="fn3003">62</xref></sup> The same rule also applies<sup><xref rid="fn3004">63</xref></sup> to the benediction of bridegrooms and the benediction of mourners,<sup><xref rid="fn3005">64</xref></sup> because two sanctifications<sup><xref rid="fn3006">65</xref></sup> must not be pronounced over the same cup. Our Masters have adopted the practice of saying the benediction of bridegrooms<sup><xref rid="fn3007">66</xref></sup> in the morning over a cup of wine in the presence of ten men; and [in the presence of] new guests all the seven days;<sup><xref rid="fn3008">67</xref></sup> and similarly in the evening after<sup><xref rid="fn3009">68</xref></sup> the meal.</p>
<p><small>RULE 12</small>. With regard to the benediction of mourners on the Sabbath, when mourning is suspended, it is said after the statutory service in the presence of the worshippers over a cup of wine; for R. Eliezer b. Hyr&#x1E33;anos said:<sup><xref rid="fn3010">69</xref></sup> Solomon saw the greatness<sup><xref rid="fn3011">70</xref></sup> of those who bestow lovingkindness, and built two gates for Israel, one for bridegrooms and the other for mourners and excommunicated persons. On the Sabbath the inhabitants of Jerusalem used to congregate, ascend the Temple Mount and take their seats between these two gates to show kindness to these persons. Since the Temple was destroyed it was enacted that bridegrooms and mourners should go to the Synagogue so that kindness could be shown to them: to bridegrooms by recounting their praises and escorting them to their homes. To mourners [by comforting them as follows:] After the reader finishes the <italic>musaf</italic>, everyone goes behind the doors of the Synagogue, which are in front of<sup><xref rid="fn3012">71</xref></sup> the Synagogue, and there meets the mourners and all their relatives. The benediction<sup><xref rid="fn3013">72</xref></sup> is said followed by <italic>&#x1E33;addish</italic>. The version &#x2018;In the world that will be renewed in the time to come&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn3014">73</xref></sup> is only said after the study of<sup><xref rid="fn3015">74</xref></sup> the Talmud and a Rabbinic discourse.<sup><xref rid="fn3016">75</xref></sup></p>

<ftnote id="fn2980">(39) Because, as a rule, no break is allowed in these benedictions.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn2981">(40) Outside Jerusalem. This was permitted in the Temple only (Rashi). According to Maimonides the permissibility extended to all Jerusalem.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn2994">(53) Who omitted &#x2018;for He is good&#x2019; (cf. its omission in 2 Chron. XX, 21). GRA reads &#x2018;the mourners&#x2019; instead of &#x2018;the Levites&#x2019; (cf. Rule 12 below). N.Y. also had this reading but considers the phrase &#x2018;except after&#x2019;, etc., superfluous.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn3009">(68) So GRA. V, M and H read &#x2018;before&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3010">(69) This follows GRA. V, M and H read: &#x2018;in the evening after the prayer in the presence of the worshippers over a cup on the Sabbath when mourning in public is suspended according to R. Eliezer b.

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER XX</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. The benediction over the moon must not be said except at the conclusion of the Sabbath when one is in an exhilarated mood<sup><xref rid="fn3017">1</xref></sup> and well dressed. [43<italic>a</italic>] He directs his eyes towards the moon, places his feet together and pronounces the benediction &#x2018;Who<sup><xref rid="fn3018">2</xref></sup> didst create the heavens by Thy word and all their hosts by the breath of Thy mouth. Thou didst set for them a fixed law and time that they should not change their ordained task. They are glad and rejoice to perform the will of their Possessor.<sup><xref rid="fn3019">3</xref></sup> They act loyally, for their<sup><xref rid="fn3020">4</xref></sup> action is truth. To the moon Thou didst say that it should renew itself with a precious light and a diadem of beauty for those who have been sustained from the womb<sup><xref rid="fn3021">5</xref></sup> who, like it, will be renewed in the future and glorify their Creator for the majesty of His kingdom. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who hallowest the New Moons&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn3022">6</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. Then one says three times, &#x2018;An auspicious omen, an auspicious omen, shall it be for all Israel. Blessed be He Who formed thee, blessed be Thy Maker, blessed be thy Possessor, blessed be thy Creator&#x2019;. Turning in the direction of the moon,<sup><xref rid="fn3023">7</xref></sup> he jumps three times and exclaims three times, &#x2018;As I jump towards thee but do not<sup><xref rid="fn3024">8</xref></sup> touch thee, so if others should jump against me to hurt me may they not touch me. Let terror and dread fall upon them and may this be retrospective, Amen, Amen, Selah. Praise ye the Lord&#x2019;. He then says &#x2018;Peace&#x2019; three times to his fellow and goes home with a cheerful heart. That is [the conclusion of the regulations] concerning the interruptions for New Moons.<sup><xref rid="fn3025">9</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. What are the regulations respecting <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3026">10</xref></sup> The Rabbis said: On the twenty-fifth day of <italic>Kislew</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3027">11</xref></sup> the <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> lamp is kindled,<sup><xref rid="fn3028">12</xref></sup> and it is forbidden to use an old lamp;<sup><xref rid="fn3029">13</xref></sup> but if a person has only an old lamp, he must thoroughly heat it in fire;<sup><xref rid="fn3030">14</xref></sup> nor may [the <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> lamp] be moved<sup><xref rid="fn3031">15</xref></sup> from its place before it is extinguished.<sup><xref rid="fn3032">16</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. The commandment to kindle it extends from sunset until the last person has left<sup><xref rid="fn3033">17</xref></sup> the street.<sup><xref rid="fn3034">18</xref></sup> And, although there is no actual proof,<sup><xref rid="fn3035">19</xref></sup> there is an allusion to it: <italic>The pillar of cloud by day</italic> [<italic>and the pillar of fire by night</italic>,] <italic>departed not</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3036">20</xref></sup> If it was lit in daytime, one must derive no benefit from it, nor may the benediction be said over it; for so [the Rabbis] said: No benediction is to be pronounced over the lamp before one enjoys its light. There is no need, however, to be concerned about changing the wick before it has been used up.</p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. It is a religious precept to place the <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> lamp by the door which is near to the public domain,<sup><xref rid="fn3037">21</xref></sup> in such a manner that the <italic>mezuzah</italic> should be on the right hand and the <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> lamp on the left, to fulfil what is stated, <italic>How fair and how pleasant art thou</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3038">22</xref></sup>&#x2014;<italic>how fair</italic> with the <italic>mezuzah</italic> and <italic>how pleasant</italic> with the <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> lamp. The number<sup><xref rid="fn3039">23</xref></sup> of lights [for each night] is in accordance with the ruling of the School of Hillel,<sup><xref rid="fn3040">24</xref></sup> because in sacred matters one should proceed to a higher grade<sup><xref rid="fn3041">25</xref></sup> but not descend to a lower one,<sup><xref rid="fn3042">26</xref></sup> [and also because the number of lights should] correspond to the days [of the Festival] as they pass.</p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. In what manner are the benedictions<sup><xref rid="fn3043">27</xref></sup> said? On the first day, the person who kindles [the lamp] says three benedictions while the onlooker says two. The person who kindles says, &#x2018;Blessed art Thou, O Lord,<sup><xref rid="fn3044">28</xref></sup> Who hast sanctified us by Thy commandments and hast given us command to kindle the light of <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic>&#x2019;. Then<sup><xref rid="fn3045">29</xref></sup> he says, &#x2018;We kindle these lights on account of the deliverances and the miracles and the wonders which Thou didst work for our fathers, by means of Thy holy priests.<sup><xref rid="fn3046">30</xref></sup> During all the eight days of <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> these lights are sacred, and it is not permitted to make any profane use of them but we are only to look at them, in order that we may give thanks unto Thy name for thy wonders, Thy miracles and Thy deliverances&#x2019;. [The third benediction is] &#x2018;Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who hast kept us in life&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn3047">31</xref></sup> [Before this] he says, &#x2018;Who wroughtest miracles for our fathers&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn3048">32</xref></sup> These benedictions are for the person who kindles the lights, but the onlooker says on the first day only two benedictions: &#x2018;Who hast kept us in life&#x2019; and &#x2018;Who wroughtest miracles&#x2019;. From that day onwards the person who kindles the lights says, &#x2018;To kindle&#x2019; and &#x2018;Who wroughtest&#x2019;, while the onlooker only says &#x2018;Who wroughtest miracles&#x2019;.</p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>. The precentor must say, &#x2018;Thou art holy&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn3049">33</xref></sup> on the eight days<sup><xref rid="fn3050">34</xref></sup> of <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic>, and similarly on New Moons and on the intermediate days of a Festival,<sup><xref rid="fn3051">35</xref></sup> because <italic>beside</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3052">36</xref></sup> <italic>the continual burnt-offering</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3053">37</xref></sup> is written in connection with them. And R. Hiyya learnt: On any day on which there is a musaf <italic>&#x1E33;edushshah</italic> is said except on <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> on which <italic>&#x1E33;edushshah</italic> is said although there is no <italic>musaf</italic> on it, because <italic>Hallel</italic> is included [in the service]. Some maintain [that it is said] on <italic>Purim</italic> also, because the scroll of Esther is read on it.</p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>. In the benediction for Thanksgiving<sup><xref rid="fn3054">38</xref></sup> we include [on <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic>] &#x2018;and thanks for the wonders and salvation of Thy priests which Thou hast wrought in the days of Mattathias, son of Jo&#x1E25;anan, High Priest, and the Hasmoneans his sons. So also, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, perform for us miracles and wonders, and we will give thanks unto Thy name for ever. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who art all-good&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn3055">39</xref></sup> The miracles [of the days] of Mordecai and Esther are also mentioned [on <italic>Purim</italic>] in the benediction for Thanksgiving. Both<sup><xref rid="fn3056">40</xref></sup> are likewise mentioned in the Grace after meals.<sup><xref rid="fn3057">41</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>. The whole <italic>Hallel</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3058">42</xref></sup> is recited during all the eight days of <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic>. During [the recital of] the first two<sup><xref rid="fn3059">43</xref></sup> chapters one may not return greetings, and there is no need to say that one must not give greetings. During [the recital of] the last two chapters one may give greetings out of fear;<sup><xref rid="fn3060">44</xref></sup> during the two middle chapters<sup><xref rid="fn3061">45</xref></sup> [greetings may be given] for the sake of peace or out of respect. The following are the first two chapters: <italic>Praise, O ye servants of the Lord</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3062">46</xref></sup> and <italic>When Israel went forth</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3063">47</xref></sup> The two middle ones are: <italic>Not unto us</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3064">48</xref></sup> and <italic>I love</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3065">49</xref></sup> The last two are: <italic>O praise the Lord</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3066">50</xref></sup> and <italic>O give thanks unto the Lord</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3067">51</xref></sup> It is also necessary to say a benediction<sup><xref rid="fn3068">52</xref></sup> before them and read them melodiously. For R. Simeon b. Jeho&#x1E93;ada&#x1E33; said:<sup><xref rid="fn3069">53</xref></sup> On eighteen days and one night the individual reads the whole <italic>Hallel</italic> and they are: the eight days of <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic>, the eight days of Tabernacles,<sup><xref rid="fn3070">54</xref></sup> the Festival of Solemn Assembly, the first Festival day of Passover and the night preceding it.<sup><xref rid="fn3071">55</xref></sup> In the Diaspora<sup><xref rid="fn3072">56</xref></sup> [the whole <italic>Hallel</italic> is read on] twenty-one days and two nights. The most proper way of performing the commandment is to read the <italic>Hallel</italic> psalms on the two nights [of Passover] in the Diaspora in the Synagogue,<sup><xref rid="fn3073">57</xref></sup> to say the benediction over them, and to recite them melodiously to fulfil what is stated, <italic>And let us exalt His name together</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3074">58</xref></sup> When, however, one reads [the <italic>Hallel</italic>] at home,<sup><xref rid="fn3075">59</xref></sup> there is no need to say the benediction because it has already been said in the congregational service.<sup><xref rid="fn3076">60</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 10</small>. A scroll<sup><xref rid="fn3077">61</xref></sup> is then taken out<sup><xref rid="fn3078">62</xref></sup> and we read in the section of the princes,<sup><xref rid="fn3079">63</xref></sup> <italic>And he that presented his offering the first day was;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3080">64</xref></sup> and likewise for each day [the corresponding section of the offering] of that day,<sup><xref rid="fn3081">65</xref></sup> until the eighth day. On the Sabbath [during <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic>] one reads, <italic>And it came to pass on the day that Moses made an end</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3082">66</xref></sup> up to <italic>so he made the candlestick</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3083">67</xref></sup> On the eighth day he reads from <italic>On the eighth day</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3084">68</xref></sup> through all the sections<sup><xref rid="fn3085">69</xref></sup> until <italic>so he made the candlestick</italic>. On the Sabbath<sup><xref rid="fn3086">70</xref></sup> one also reads as the <italic>haf&#x1E6D;arah, Thus all the work &#x2026; was finished</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3087">71</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 11</small>. During the eight days of <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> we read the following one day earlier:<sup><xref rid="fn3088">72</xref></sup> <italic>On the second day</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3089">73</xref></sup> <italic>On the third day</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3090">74</xref></sup> <italic>On the fourth day</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3091">75</xref></sup> <italic>On the fifth day</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3092">76</xref></sup> <italic>On the sixth day</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3093">77</xref></sup> <italic>On the seventh day</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3094">78</xref></sup> <italic>On the eighth day</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3095">79</xref></sup> so as to complete ten verses.<sup><xref rid="fn3096">80</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 12</small>. When the New Moon of <italic>&#x1E6C;ebeth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3097">81</xref></sup> falls on a Sunday, three persons read on the first day<sup><xref rid="fn3098">82</xref></sup> in the passage of the New Moon first, while the fourth reads the passage of <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic>, because that which is more frequent takes precedence,<sup><xref rid="fn3099">83</xref></sup> and so [the reading for the New Moon] precedes the other. On the second day, however, the order is not the same, but three persons read the passage of <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> while the fourth reads that of the New Moon, because on the previous day the section of the New Moon had been read first.<sup><xref rid="fn3100">84</xref></sup> [This is the procedure] because R. Isaac Se&#x1E25;orah asked R. Isaac Nappa&#x1E25;a, &#x2018;Which do we read [first]<sup><xref rid="fn3101">85</xref></sup> when the New Moon of <italic>&#x1E6C;ebeth</italic> falls on a Sabbath?&#x2019; [He replied,] &#x2018;In the section of <italic>kalloth Mosheh</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3102">86</xref></sup> while the <italic>maf&#x1E6D;ir</italic> reads<sup><xref rid="fn3103">87</xref></sup> the passages relating to the Sabbath and the New Moon.<sup><xref rid="fn3104">88</xref></sup> If it falls on a week-day, on the first day [of the New Moon] three persons read [the passage] for the New Moon, the fourth reading that of <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah;</italic> because that which is more frequent takes precedence. As, however, the section of the New Moon was read first,<sup><xref rid="fn3105">89</xref></sup> three persons are to be called up on the second day for the reading of the <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> section,<sup><xref rid="fn3106">90</xref></sup> while the fourth reads<sup><xref rid="fn3107">91</xref></sup> the section of the New Moon, viz. <italic>And in your new moons</italic> to the end of the section.<sup><xref rid="fn3108">92</xref></sup> Why is this so?<sup><xref rid="fn3109">93</xref></sup> Because it is only on account of the <italic>musaf</italic> of New Moon<sup><xref rid="fn3110">94</xref></sup> that a fourth person is added.<sup><xref rid="fn3111">95</xref></sup> Behold [we have concluded the regulations respecting] the interruption which is made for the sake of <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3112">96</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn3017">(1) After the happiness of the Sabbath day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3018">(2) Preceded, as all benedictions, by &#x2018;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3019">(3) Inserted by GRA and M; omitted by V. H adds it in the textual notes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3020">(4) So GRA, M and H. V has &#x2018;for his&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3021">(5) A reference to Israel (cf. Is. XLVI, 3).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3022">(6) H reads &#x2018;hallowest Israel and the New Moons&#x2019;; the reading of GRA is &#x2018;Who renewest the months&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3023">(7) lit. &#x2018;towards it&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3024">(8) M reads &#x2018;and cannot&#x2019; which is the reading in the ritual.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3025">(9) Cf. XVII, 2f where the regulations for the New Moon began and, with many interruptions, insertions and amplifications, continued to the end of this Rule.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3026">(10) lit. &#x2018;how do we interrupt for <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic>&#x2019;, a reference to XVII, 2 where <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> was first introduced in this set of regulations with the statement, &#x2018;The sequence &#x2026; is interrupted for &#x2026; <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah&#x2019;</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3027">(11) The ninth Heb. month on the twenty-fifth of which the Festival begins.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3028">(12) This takes place on the preceding evening, the night belonging to the following day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3029">(13) If it is an earthen lamp, because the burnt oil renders it unsightly.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3030">(14) To burn away the old oil, after which the lamp may be used.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3031">(15) lit. &#x2018;lifted&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3032">(16) Carrying the lamp about while it is burning might cause suspicion that one is making a profane use of it; but the <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> light, commemorating the miracles which led up to the celebration (cf. Rule 5), is sacred, is only to be looked at and must not be used for any other purpose.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3033">(17) lit. &#x2018;the foot ceases from&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3034">(18) The light is intended to serve as a public demonstration, but at such a late hour there are no passers-by to see it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3035">(19) That the lighting must take place after sunset.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3036">(20) Ex. XIII, 22, which indicates that the pillar of fire which, like the <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> lamp, was intended to shed light, appeared in the night only</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3037">(21) So that the light is seen from the street.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3038">(22) Cant. VII, 7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3039">(23) Inserted by GRA, wanting in V, M and H.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3040">(24) One light on the first night, two on the second, and so on, until eight lights burn on the eighth and last night of the Festival.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3041">(25) Adding lights on the succeeding nights.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3042">(26) As would happen if the number were to be reduced from eight on the first night to one on the last in accordance with the view of Beth Shammai.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3043">(27) Over the <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> lights.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3044">(28) Inserting after &#x2018;Lord&#x2019;, as in all benedictions, &#x2018;our God, King of the universe&#x2019; (P.B., p. 274).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3045">(29) After the three benedictions: the one just given and the two mentioned below.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3046">(30) The Maccabees who were a priestly family.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3047">(31) Concluding &#x2018;and hast preserved us, and enabled us to reach this season&#x2019; (P.B., p. 274).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3048">(32) Beginning, as usual, &#x2018;Blessed art &#x2026; universe&#x2019; and concluding &#x2018;in the days of old at this season&#x2019; (P.B., p. 274).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3049">(33) i.e. the <italic>&#x1E33;edushshah</italic>. It appears that, instead of beginning with &#x2018;We will sanctify&#x2019; (P.B., p. 45) or &#x2018;We will reverence&#x2019; (P.B., p. 160), there was a custom to begin with &#x2018;Thou art holy&#x2019; on Sabbath and Festivals. Rule 7 extends this practice to some of the less important days as specified below. It has also been suggested to read, instead of <italic>&#x2019;attah &#x1E33;adosh</italic> (&#x2018;Thou art holy&#x2019;) <italic>&#x2019;eth ha&#x1E33;&#x1E33;edushshah</italic> (&#x2018;the <italic>&#x1E33;edushshah</italic>&#x2019;).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3050">(34) So GRA. V, M and H read &#x2018;in the eighteen [benedictions]&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3051">(35) viz. Passover and Tabernacles.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3052">(36) Inserted by GRA, omitted by V, M and H.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3053">(37) Num. XXVIII, 15 (on the New Moon); <italic>ibid.</italic> 24 (on the intermediate days of Passover); and <italic>ibid.</italic> XXIX, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34 (on those of Tabernacles).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3054">(38) Beginning &#x2018;We give thanks&#x2019; (P.B., p. 51).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3055">(39) The present version of this form of thanksgiving is longer and differs in wording (P.B., p. 52).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3056">(40) Those for <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> and <italic>Purim</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3057">(41) In the second benediction (P.B., p. 281).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3058">(42) Including Pss. CXV, 1-11 and CXVI, 1-11 (P.B., pp. 220f).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3059">(43) So GRA. V, M and H read &#x2018;three&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3060">(44) To a person who can cause harm in his resentment at not having been greeted.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3061">(45) The reading of GRA. V and M have &#x2018;and return greetings for the sake of peace and out of respect&#x2019;. H omits the text of V and GRA.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3062">(46) Ps. CXIII.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3063">(47) <italic>ibid.</italic> CXIV. V, M and H adds Ps. CXV as the third.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3064">(48) <italic>ibid.</italic> CXV; &#x2018;the two middle &#x2026; <italic>us&#x2019;</italic> is the reading of GRA.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn3066">(50) <italic>ibid.</italic> CXVII.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3067">(51) <italic>ibid.</italic> CXVIII.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3068">(52) &#x2018;Blessed art Thou &#x2026; to read the <italic>Hallel</italic>&#x2019; (P.B., p. 219).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3069">(53) So GRA. V, H and M read &#x2018;learnt&#x2019; using a term which refers to a Mishnah, whereas the quotation is from the Gemara in Ta&#x2018;an. 28b (Sonc. ed., pp. 150f).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3070">(54) Omitted by V and M, but added by GRA and H in agreement with Ta&#x2018;an. <italic>loc. cit.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3071">(55) [Cf. Pes. V, 7 (Sonc. ed., p. 327) where it is described how the <italic>Hallel</italic> was recited during the sacrifice of the Paschal lamb on the eve of Passover.]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3072">(56) i.e. all countries outside the land of Israel where two days are observed as holy instead of the first day of Tabernacles, two days for the Festival of Solemn Assembly, and two days each for the first and seventh day of Passover.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3073">(57) In addition to reading them at home in the course of the <italic>Seder</italic> ritual. &#x2018;In the Synagogue&#x2019; is inserted by GRA but omitted by V, M and H.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3074">(58) Ps. XXXIV, 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3075">(59) During the <italic>Seder</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3076">(60) lit. &#x2018;among many&#x2019;. The Service in Synagogue precedes the <italic>Seder</italic> in the home.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3077">(61) M and H read &#x2018;a scroll of the Torah&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3078">(62) In the Synagogue Service during <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3079">(63) Num. VII.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3080">(64) <italic>ibid.</italic> 12-17.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3081">(65) lit. &#x2018;and so for each day its day&#x2019;, the number of the <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> day corresponding to the respective number of the days of the offerings of the princes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3082">(66) Num. VII, 1.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3083">(67) <italic>ibid.</italic> VIII, 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3084">(68) <italic>ibid.</italic> 54.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3085">(69) Of the offerings of all the princes.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3086">(70) So GRA. V and M read: &#x2018;and so on the eighth day until <italic>And this was the work of the candlestick</italic> (Num. VIII, 4) all the verse&#x2019;. H has a different text.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3087">(71) i.e. in the passage 1 Kings VII, 51&#x2014;VIII, 21.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3088">(72) lit. &#x2018;we advance to say&#x2019;. To the prescribed reading of the day that of the following day is added.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3089">(73) Num. VII, 18-23. This is added to the reading of the first day and then repeated on the second, and similarly with the rest.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3090">(74) <italic>ibid.</italic> 24-29.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3091">(75) <italic>ibid.</italic> 30-35.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3092">(76) <italic>ibid.</italic> 36-41.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3093">(77) <italic>ibid.</italic> 42-47.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3094">(78) <italic>ibid.</italic> 48-53.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3095">(79) <italic>ibid.</italic> 54-59.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3096">(80) Which is the minimum required for the reading of the three persons who are called to the Torah each day of <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3097">(81) Which always occurs during <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3098">(82) Of the New Moon, which is observed sometimes on one day and sometimes on two.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3099">(83) The New Moon occurs every month, <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> once a year.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3100">(84) So GRA. V, M and H read: &#x2018;because the reckoning of the month is from the second day only when the years are regular&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3101">(85) In the second and third scrolls of the Torah. In the first the regular portion of the week is read.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3102">(86) E.V. <italic>Moses had made an end</italic> (Num. VII, 1). The extent of the reading is given in Rule 10 above.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3103">(87) In the third scroll.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3104">(88) Num. XXVIII, 9-15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3105">(89) On the first day of New Moon.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3106">(90) In the first scroll. Only two scrolls are taken out on the week-days of <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3107">(91) In the second scroll.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3108">(92) Num. XXVIII, 11-15.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3109">(93) Why is the order of the reading reversed on the second day as compared with the first?</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3110">(94) On the other week-days of <italic>&#x1E24;anukkah</italic> there is no <italic>musaf</italic>. This argument cannot be applied to the first day of New Moon because it is the second day which begins the month, the first being the last day of the old month.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3111">(95) Rule 12 incorporates nearly the whole of XII, 7.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3112">(96) Cf. XVII, 2f.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER XXI</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. [Reverting to the sequence of the readings which] is interrupted for <italic>Purim</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3113">1</xref></sup> It is<sup><xref rid="fn3114">2</xref></sup> the custom of our Rabbis in the West to afflict themselves by fasting the three days of the fast of Mordecai and Esther<sup><xref rid="fn3115">3</xref></sup> intermittently, viz. after <italic>Purim</italic> on the Monday, Thursday and Monday.</p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. And why do we not fast in the month of <italic>Nisan?</italic> Because on the first of <italic>Nisan</italic> the Tabernacle was erected<sup><xref rid="fn3116">4</xref></sup> and twelve princes offered their sacrifices during [the first] twelve days, a day for each tribe,<sup><xref rid="fn3117">5</xref></sup> and everyone held a festival on his day.<sup><xref rid="fn3118">6</xref></sup> Furthermore, in the time to come the Sanctuary will be rebuilt in <italic>Nisan</italic>, to confirm what is stated, <italic>There is nothing new under the sun</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3119">7</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. For this reason<sup><xref rid="fn3120">8</xref></sup> no supplications<sup><xref rid="fn3121">9</xref></sup> are offered on any of the days of <italic>Nisan</italic> and there is no fasting until <italic>Nisan</italic> has passed. The only exception is [the fast of] the firstborn who fast on the eve of Passover.<sup><xref rid="fn3122">10</xref></sup> The very pious also fast on that day on account of the unleavened bread, in order that they shall begin to eat it<sup><xref rid="fn3123">11</xref></sup> with relish.<sup><xref rid="fn3124">12</xref></sup> Scholars fast on Mondays and Thursdays [throughout the year] on account of the desecration of the name of God<sup><xref rid="fn3125">13</xref></sup> and for the honour of the Temple which was burnt.</p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. To what does the foregoing apply? To fasting in private, but it is forbidden to proclaim a public fast until <italic>Nisan</italic> has passed.</p>
<p>On the first day of <italic>Adar</italic> a public proclamation is made regarding the shekels.<sup><xref rid="fn3126">14</xref></sup> Why on the first of <italic>Adar?</italic> Because it was foreseen, revealed and known before Him Who spoke and the world came into being that Haman would in time to come weigh [shekels] against Israel.<sup><xref rid="fn3127">15</xref></sup> He, therefore, forestalled him and instructed Moses that the shekels of Israel should precede Haman&#x2019;s. It is required that Israel shall give their shekels before [43<italic>b</italic>] the Sabbath of Remember;<sup><xref rid="fn3128">16</xref></sup> and it is forbidden to say of them<sup><xref rid="fn3129">17</xref></sup> that they are &#x2018;for a ransom&#x2019; [but must be given] for a freewill-offering. From the proceeds water and food should be supplied for their poor brethren on account of a sacrifice<sup><xref rid="fn3130">18</xref></sup> and gifts to the poor.<sup><xref rid="fn3131">19</xref></sup> Some supply bread and wine, others supply bread and fish; in any event not less than two gifts<sup><xref rid="fn3132">20</xref></sup> should be given, although they consist only of wheat and beans.</p>

<p><small>RULE 7</small>. R.

Eliezer b. R. Ma&#x1E33;om raised an objection:<sup><xref rid="fn3167">55</xref></sup> [It has been taught,] &#x2018;He who reads the <italic>haf&#x1E6D;arah</italic> from the Prophet shall read not less than twenty-one verses&#x2019;,<sup><xref rid="fn3168">56</xref></sup> but [if R.

<p><small>RULE 8</small>. Where the custom is to read the <italic>Megillah</italic> on two days<sup><xref rid="fn3171">59</xref></sup> it should be so read, [and where it is customary to read it] in the night and in the day, it should be so read; all depends on the practice of the country. Furthermore, all Israel must read it in the holy tongue.<sup><xref rid="fn3172">60</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3173">61</xref></sup> <italic>The greatest man among the Anakim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3174">62</xref></sup><italic>&#x2014;among the Anakim</italic> refers to our father Abraham whose height was equal to that of seventy-four men; his eating and drinking were of a similar proportion, equal to those of seventy-four men; so too his strength. What did he do?<sup><xref rid="fn3175">63</xref></sup> He removed the sixteen<sup><xref rid="fn3176">64</xref></sup> sons of Keturah, built for them a walled city of iron and settled them in it. The sun never penetrated into it because it was exceedingly high, so Abraham handed to them disks of precious stones and pearls of which use will be made<sup><xref rid="fn3177">65</xref></sup> in the hereafter when the Holy One, blessed be He, will cause the sun and moon to be confounded, as it is written, <italic>When the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3178">66</xref></sup> because use will be made of these [disks as luminaries].</p>
<p>Og<sup><xref rid="fn3179">67</xref></sup> is identical with Eliezer,<sup><xref rid="fn3180">68</xref></sup> and [he was so huge that] he could hide Abraham&#x2019;s feet in the palm of his hand. Once he was rebuked [by Abraham] and from fright his tooth fell out. Abraham picked it up and made ivory beds of it in which he slept. Others say that he made of it a chair which he used<sup><xref rid="fn3181">69</xref></sup> all his life. Who gave him to Abraham? Nimrod.<sup><xref rid="fn3182">70</xref></sup> Og went and built sixty cities, the smallest of which was sixty miles high, as it is stated, <italic>Threescore cities, all the region of Argob</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3183">71</xref></sup> And what did he eat? A thousand oxen and the same [number of] other animals, and his drink consisted of a thousand measures. A<sup><xref rid="fn3184">72</xref></sup> drop of his semen weighed thirty-six pounds.<sup><xref rid="fn3185">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>It was taught: What did our father Jacob do when his sons brought him the coat [stained] with blood?<sup><xref rid="fn3186">74</xref></sup> He did not believe them at all. Whence do we infer this? For it is written, <italic>But he refused to be comforted</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3187">75</xref></sup> because no consolations are acceptable for a living person. One, however, who is dead passes naturally from the mind,<sup><xref rid="fn3188">76</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3189">77</xref></sup> What then did he do? He proceeded to make a test with sheaves,<sup><xref rid="fn3190">78</xref></sup> writing upon them the respective names of the tribes, their constellations and the months, and said to them, &#x2018;I order you to prostrate yourselves before Levi because he wears the Urim and Thummim&#x2019;,<sup><xref rid="fn3191">79</xref></sup> but they did not stand up. &#x2018;Before Judah who is king&#x2019;, but they did not stand up; but when he mentioned Joseph to them, they all stood up and bowed before Joseph. But it was not yet quite clear that he was alive. So Jacob went to the mountains, hewed twelve stones, arranged them in a row, and wrote on each the name of its tribe, the name of its constellation and the name of its month. On one stone he wrote &#x2018;Reuben, lamb, <italic>Nisan</italic>&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn3192">80</xref></sup> and similarly on every stone. He began from Simeon and said to them, &#x2018;I order you to stand up for Reuben&#x2019;, but they did not stand up. &#x2018;For Simeon&#x2019;, but they did not stand up. &#x2018;For every tribe&#x2019;, but the stones did not stand up. As soon, however, as he mentioned the name of Joseph to them, they stood up at once and bowed before Joseph&#x2019;s stone.<sup><xref rid="fn3193">81</xref></sup> For this reason, all the tribes were written on Joseph&#x2019;s stone. Similarly, all Israel are called by Joseph&#x2019;s name, as it is stated, <italic>Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3194">82</xref></sup> So also all the heads of the families of the priests and Levites, [e.g.] <italic>Eliashib</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3195">83</xref></sup> because of the phrase <italic>lahashibo &#x2019;el &#x2019;abiw;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3196">84</xref></sup> <italic>El&#x1E33;anah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3197">85</xref></sup> because Potiphar had bought him [as it is stated,] <italic>And Joseph ms brought down to Egypt, and Potiphar &#x2026; bought him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3198">86</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Rebekah left her father&#x2019;s house<sup><xref rid="fn3199">87</xref></sup> she was three years old,<sup><xref rid="fn3200">88</xref></sup> because it is customary among kings, when a daughter is born to them, to hear of it after three days;<sup><xref rid="fn3201">89</xref></sup> but as her father did not hear [of her birth] he did not defile her up to that time; and now a miracle happened to her in that her father died so that he should not defile her, as it is written, <italic>Neither had any man known her</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3202">90</xref></sup> and by <italic>man</italic> only her father could be meant,<sup><xref rid="fn3203">91</xref></sup> for such was the practice of the Arameans to lie with their virgin daughters after they were three years of age,<sup><xref rid="fn3204">92</xref></sup> and then to give them away in marriage.<sup><xref rid="fn3205">93</xref></sup></p>
<p>Dinah was six years old when she bore Asenath from [her association with] Shechem,<sup><xref rid="fn3206">94</xref></sup> corresponding to<sup><xref rid="fn3207">95</xref></sup> the six years which Jacob served Laban in payment for the flock,<sup><xref rid="fn3208">96</xref></sup> thus completing<sup><xref rid="fn3209">97</xref></sup> the twenty years of his service. [The Archangel] Michael then descended and took her away to the house of Potiphar.</p>

The Passover ending on the twenty-first (in the land of Israel) or on the twenty-second (in the Diaspora), only eight or nine days of the month remain.

<ftnote id="fn3155">(43) This is explained in the continuation.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn3164">(52) Ex. XVII, 8-16, read on <italic>Purim</italic>, which consists only of nine verses.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3165">(53) So GRA, M and H. V reads: &#x2018;he said, No, it is taught, it&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3166">(54) This reply could also have been given to the preceding objection, since in Gen. I, 6-13, if only verse 8 is divided into two, there would be nine verses, as in the section of Amalek.</ftnote>

V omits it but inserts in brackets: &#x2018;It is permitted to skip in a Prophet but not in the Torah, because if [a reader] skipped even one verse by not reading it, and restored the scroll [to the ark] and recited <italic>&#x1E33;addish</italic>, he must unroll it again, say the benedictions, and read that verse and the two verses which follow it&#x2019;.

<ftnote id="fn3169">(57) In accordance with R. Huna&#x2019;s ruling above that &#x2018;for three readings &#x2026; no less than ten verses must be allotted&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3170">(58) Since a minimum of three verses must be read for each person who is called up. No reply is given to the objection, but it is possible to provide the following explanation: Only when no more than three persons are called up is it necessary to allot ten verses, but when the number of persons is more than three, as, e.g., on the Sabbath when not less than seven persons must be called to the Torah, three verses for each person or twenty-one in all are sufficient.</ftnote>

<title>Tractate Semachot</title>
<chapter>
<title>INTRODUCTION</title>
<p><italic>Sema&#x1E25;oth</italic> (lit. &#x2018;Joys&#x2019;) is a euphemistic term for the older name of the tractate, <italic>&#x2019;Ebel Rabbathi</italic> (lit. &#x2018;Great Mourning&#x2019;). A tractate of this name is cited in the Talmud, M.&#x1E32;. 24a, 26b (Sonc. ed., pp. 148, 172) and Keth. 28a (Sonc. ed., p. 153), but is not completely identical with the present work.</p>
<p>The original <italic>Sema&#x1E25;oth</italic> consisted of a collection of <italic>Baraithoth</italic> dealing with the laws of mourning for the dead prescribed by Judaism, compiled in Palestine by R. Eliezer b. &#x1E92;ado&#x1E33; (first cent. <small>C.E.</small>). Later it was amplified and embellished by R. &#x1E24;iyya, a Babylonian of the second century. It took its present form probably in the middle of the eighth century.</p>
<p>The tractate consists of fourteen chapters and, in addition to the laws of mourning, includes much aggadic material and several stories, e.g. the death of the Ten Martyrs (ch. VIII) and the son of R. &#x1E24;anina b. Teradion (ch. XII). It opens with an aggadic passage of a less gloomy character, the compiler apparently feeling it desirable to begin on a brighter note.</p>
<p><italic>Sema&#x1E25;oth</italic> prescribes the regulations to be observed during the closing hours of a person&#x2019;s life, from the time he is dying until after the burial, and the ceremonial mourning to be kept by his nearest kin during the seven and the thirty days which follow. The tractate may therefore be described as &#x2018;The Mourner&#x2019;s Manual&#x2019;.</p>
<p>I venture the suggestion that, because mourners were forbidden to study the Torah during the seven days of strict mourning, the tractate with its aggadic embellishments served as a suitable text for reading and meditation.</p>
<p>I have to acknowledge my indebtedness to M. Higger&#x2019;s invaluable edition of <italic>Sema&#x1E25;oth</italic> which was of great help in the preparation of this work.</p>

<title>PROEM<sup><xref rid="fn3211">1</xref></sup></title>
<p><italic>And it came to pass at midnight, that the Lord smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3212">2</xref></sup> etc.; and it is written, <italic>For all the first-born among the children of Israel are Mine, both men and beast; on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them for Myself</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3213">3</xref></sup> R. Jo&#x1E25;anan said: Although He smote them with the plague of death at midnight, the souls writhed within them until morning. A common proverb says, &#x2018;If you give a morsel of bread to a child, inform his mother&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn3214">4</xref></sup> Likewise, the Holy One, blessed be He, said, &#x2018;I will inform My children of the death by choking<sup><xref rid="fn3215">5</xref></sup> of which their enemies are dying. Let their souls await the morning [before expiring], so that My children shall look upon [the fate of] their enemies&#x2019;.</p>
<ftnote id="fn3211">(1) The introductory passage bears no relation to the subject-matter of the tractate. The reason which the compiler may have had in mind in using it as a preface is mentioned in the Introduction. Higger (Introduction to his ed., p. 24) has demonstrated that this passage was originally the conclusion of <italic>Soferim</italic> which, in most MSS., preceded <italic>Sema&#x1E25;oth.</italic> The tractate <italic>Soferim</italic> ends with an unpleasant subject and the author, following an ancient practice, added an aggadic passage of a more cheerful nature (cf. the repetition in the Bible of the penultimate verse of the books of Malachi, Lamentations and Ecclesiastes). The Proem is to be found in <italic>Pesi&#x1E33;ta Rabbathi</italic> XVII, ed. M. Friedmann, pp. 87a, b. Owing to the juxta-position of the two tractates, it was erroneously attached to <italic>Sema&#x1E25;oth.</italic></ftnote>

<title>SEMA&#x1E24;OTH</title>
<title>CHAPTER I</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. A dying man<sup><xref rid="fn3216">1</xref></sup> is regarded as a living entity in respect of all matters in the world: he holds [his brother&#x2019;s wife] tied to the leviratical marriage,<sup><xref rid="fn3217">2</xref></sup> he frees [his mother] from the obligation of a leviratical marriage<sup><xref rid="fn3218">3</xref></sup> and enables her to eat <italic>terumah</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3219">4</xref></sup> and he [may also] disqualify her from eating <italic>terumah;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3220">5</xref></sup> he inherits and transmits;<sup><xref rid="fn3221">6</xref></sup> if one of his limbs is severed, it is regarded as a limb cut off from the living;<sup><xref rid="fn3222">7</xref></sup> if [part of his] flesh [is severed], it is regarded as flesh cut off from the living;<sup><xref rid="fn3223">8</xref></sup> and the blood of his sin-offering and guilt-offering is sprinkled for him until the time he dies.<sup><xref rid="fn3224">9</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. We do not tie up his cheek-bones,<sup><xref rid="fn3225">10</xref></sup> or stop up his apertures,<sup><xref rid="fn3226">11</xref></sup> or place a metal vessel or anything which chills on his navel;<sup><xref rid="fn3227">12</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>Before the silver cord is snapped asunder and the golden bowl is shattered, and the pitcher is broken at the fountain.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3228">13</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. We may not move him, or place him on sand or salt<sup><xref rid="fn3229">14</xref></sup> until he dies.<sup><xref rid="fn3230">15</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. We may not close the eyes<sup><xref rid="fn3231">16</xref></sup> of a dying man. Whoever touches and moves him is a murderer. For R. Meir used to say: He can be compared to a lamp which is dripping;<sup><xref rid="fn3232">17</xref></sup> should a man touch it he extinguishes it. Similarly whoever closes the eyes of a dying man is considered as if he had taken his life.</p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. We do not rend the garments or bare the shoulder,<sup><xref rid="fn3233">18</xref></sup> or deliver a memorial address, or bring the coffin into the house until he dies.<sup><xref rid="fn3234">19</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. We do not summon the people<sup><xref rid="fn3235">20</xref></sup> or recount his good deeds. R. Judah said: If he is a scholar we recount his good deeds.<sup><xref rid="fn3236">21</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3237">22</xref></sup> In the town people do not greet each other.<sup><xref rid="fn3238">23</xref></sup> This applies only in a village,<sup><xref rid="fn3239">24</xref></sup> but in a large city it is permissible.</p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>. We do not carry out the mourning rites for one who came out [at birth] by pieces or with feet foremost, or for one born prematurely<sup><xref rid="fn3240">25</xref></sup> at eight months<sup><xref rid="fn3241">26</xref></sup> alive or at nine months dead.</p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>. For a non-Jew or a slave we do not occupy ourselves with his funeral rites, but we exclaim of him, &#x2018;Alas lion&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn3242">27</xref></sup> alas mighty man&#x0021;&#x2019;. R. Judah said: [We, for instance, exclaim], &#x2018;Alas, &#x1E6C;abi&#x0021;<sup><xref rid="fn3243">28</xref></sup> alas, faithful man who ate<sup><xref rid="fn3244">29</xref></sup> of his labour&#x0021;&#x2019;. They said to him,<sup><xref rid="fn3245">30</xref></sup> &#x2018;[If so], what have you left [to be said] of worthy men [who are not slaves]?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;If he was worthy, why should we not say it of him, since<sup><xref rid="fn3246">31</xref></sup> we do not receive condolence for [the loss of] male or female slaves?&#x2019;</p>
<p><small>RULE 10</small>. It is related that when R. Eliezer&#x2019;s female slave died, his disciples came to comfort him. He entered the courtyard [to avoid them], but they followed him; he went into the house, but they followed him. He said to them, &#x2018;I imagined that you would be scalded with tepid water, but now you are not even scalded with hot water.<sup><xref rid="fn3247">32</xref></sup> Have [the Sages] not said: <sup><xref rid="fn3248">33</xref></sup>We do not receive condolence for slaves because they are reckoned as animals?&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn3249">34</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 11</small>. And when &#x1E6C;abi the slave of Rabban Gamaliel died, he received condolence for him. They asked him, &#x2018;Master, have you not taught us that we do not receive condolence for slaves?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;My slave &#x1E6C;abi was unlike all other slaves; he was a worthy man&#x2019;.</p>
<p><small>RULE 12</small>. He also permitted &#x1E6C;abi to put on the <italic>tefillin</italic>. They said to him, &#x2018;Master, have you not taught us that slaves are exempt from [the precept of] <italic>tefillin?</italic>&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;My slave &#x1E6C;abi was unlike all other slaves; he was a worthy man&#x2019;.</p>
<p><small>RULE 13</small>. We do not call male and female slaves &#x2018;Father So-and-so, Mother So-and-so&#x2019;. Those of the house of Rabban Gamaliel, however, were called &#x2018;Father &#x1E6C;abi&#x2019; and &#x2018;Mother &#x1E6C;abitha&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn3250">35</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 14</small>. We confine the term &#x2018;our father&#x2019; to the three Patriarchs,<sup><xref rid="fn3251">36</xref></sup> and the term &#x2018;our mother&#x2019; to the four Matriarchs.<sup><xref rid="fn3252">37</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn3216">(1) Heb. <italic>gos&#x0113;s</italic>, the term applied when the rattle in the throat indicates that a person is at the point of death.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3217">(2) Cf. Deut. XXV, 5ff. Should the brother die while he himself is dying, the former&#x2019;s widow is precluded from marrying until she is released by the latter from his obligation to wed her (cf. Ohol. I, 6, Sonc. ed., pp. 151f).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3218">(3) If his father died and left no other children, his mother is free to remarry because the dying man is regarded as living. Even a child who survives one day frees his mother from the levirate. Cf. Nid. 43b (Sonc. ed., p. 303).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3219">(4) If his mother is the daughter of a lay-Israelite married to a <italic>kohen</italic>, she may continue to eat <italic>terumah</italic> so long as he remains at the point of death.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3220">(5) If she is the daughter of a <italic>kohen</italic> married to a lay-Israelite, she may not eat of the <italic>terumah</italic> belonging to her father which, on the death of her husband, she is permitted to eat when she returns to his home (cf. Lev. XXII, 12f). The reason is that, since her son is regarded as living, it would be contrary to the stipulation in Lev. <italic>and have no child</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3221">(6) i.e. an estate. On inheritance and transmission, cf. B.B. 108a (Sonc. ed., p. 448).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3222">(7) There is a legal difference if it is a limb severed from a living or dead body. If it was from a dead body, a piece of flesh from it, even the size of an olive, communicates defilement; but if from a living body it does not. Therefore, if one of the dying man&#x2019;s limbs is severed, flesh from it does not defile because he is considered a living being.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3223">(8) Flesh not necessarily from a severed limb.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3224">(9) Where a man who brought a sin- or guilt-offering died before it was sacrificed, the animal for the former had to be killed and the latter turned into the fields to graze until it died naturally. But with a dying man who brought an offering, the ritual connected with his sacrifice was carried out completely.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3225">(10) To prevent the jaw from dropping; cf. Shab. 151a (Sonc. ed., p. 771).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3226">(11) To prevent air from entering.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3227">(12) Shab. <italic>loc. cit.</italic> reads &#x2018;on his stomach&#x2019;, that it should not swell.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3228">(13) Eccl. XII, 6. None of these acts may be done because they hasten death.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3229">(14) For &#x2018;salt&#x2019; GRA reads &#x2018;a vessel that chills&#x2019;; cf. Tosiftha Shab. XVIII, 18.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3230">(15) So that the body should keep cool and not swell.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3231">(16) Shab. <italic>loc. cit.</italic> (Sonc. ed., p. 772). Closing the eyes of a corpse is a very ancient practice. According to Ibn Ezra the custom is alluded to in Gen. XLVI, 4, <italic>and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes</italic> (cf. his commentary <italic>ad loc</italic>.). The custom was current among the ancient Greeks and Romans and is practised by the Egyptians [cf. Seyffert, <italic>Dictionary of Classical Antiquities</italic>, p. 101b, and Lane, <italic>Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians</italic>, ch. XXVIII]. A man, at the moment of death, was believed to behold the Divine Presence (cf. Job XIX, 27) and therefore it was unfitting that after that vision his eyes should look at anything mundane. Cf. A. Bender in <italic>Jewish Quarterly Review</italic>, VII (1895), pp. 102f.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3232">(17) Shab. <italic>loc cit.</italic> reads &#x2018;a lamp that is going out&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3233">(18) Cf. Rashi to M.&#x1E32;. 22b (Sonc. ed., p. 140). R. Meir of Rothenberg explains the word <italic>&#x1E25;ole&#x1E93;in</italic> in the usual sense of &#x2018;removing the shoes&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3234">(19) These things should be avoided so as not to frighten the dying person.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3235">(20) Cf. 1 Sam. XV, 4, XXIII, 8 for this usage of the Heb. verb. Br&#x00FC;ll adds the word <italic>&#x2018;ayaroth</italic> (cf. Sanh. 47a, Sonc. ed., p. 311), &#x2018;We do not summon the people of the townships&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3236">(21) Because he is accustomed to have his praises sung and it would not distress him in the circumstances.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3237">(22) This Rule is not connected with the preceding, but speaks of a case where there is a dead person in the town.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3238">(23) Because all must share in the mourning, and greeting is not permitted to a mourner.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3239">(24) Where all learn quickly of the death.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3240">(25) Heb. <italic>nefel</italic>, a child who dies within thirty days of birth.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3241">(26) And cannot therefore survive.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3242">(27) So H; V repeats &#x2018;lion&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3243">(28) The faithful slave of Rabban Gamaliel (cf. Ber. 16b, Sonc. ed. p. 96).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3244">(29) In Ber. &#x2018;who worked for his living&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3245">(30) To R. Jose who, in Ber. (Sonc. ed., p. 97), suggested the praise to be made over a faithful slave.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3246">(31) So H; V lacks &#x2018;since&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3247">(32) The meaning is, I made it clear to you that I did not want to receive your condolence; cf. Ber. <italic>loc. cit.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3248">(33) In Ber., &#x2018;Have I not taught you&#x2019;, etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3249">(34) The text in Ber. reads: What do we say over them? As we say to a man on the death of his ox or ass, &#x2018;May the Omnipresent repair thy loss&#x2019;, so we say to a man on the death of his slaves, &#x2018;May the Omnipresent repair thy loss&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3250">(35) Quoted from Ber. <italic>loc. cit.</italic> [The female slave &#x1E6C;abitha is mentioned in j.Nid. I, 4, 49b.]</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3251">(36) Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3252">(37) Sara, Rebekah, Rachel and Leah. This Rule is also culled, in a slightly different form from Ber. <italic>loc. cit.</italic></ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER II</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. We do not occupy ourselves in any respect with the funeral rites of one who committed suicide wilfully. R. Ishmael said: We exclaim over him, &#x2018;Alas for a lost<sup><xref rid="fn3253">1</xref></sup> [life&#x0021;] Alas for a [lost] life&#x0021;&#x2019; R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said to him, &#x2018;Leave him unmourned; speak neither well nor ill of him&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn3254">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>We do not rend garments for him,<sup><xref rid="fn3255">3</xref></sup> bare the shoulder, or deliver a memorial address over him. We do, however, stand in a row<sup><xref rid="fn3256">4</xref></sup> for him and recite the benediction of mourners<sup><xref rid="fn3257">5</xref></sup> for him, from respect of the living [relatives]. The general rule is: With anything that makes for respect of the living we occupy ourselves, but with anything that does not make for the respect of the living, the public do not in any way occupy themselves.</p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. Who [comes within the category of] &#x2018;one who committed suicide wilfully&#x2019;? He does not who climbed to the top of a tree and fell down and died, or he who went up to the top of the roof and fell down and died.<sup><xref rid="fn3258">6</xref></sup> But he who calls out, &#x2018;Look, I am going to the top of the roof or to the top of the tree, and I will throw myself down that I may die&#x2019; [comes within the category]. When people saw him go up to the top of a tree or roof [for the purpose] and he fell down and died, he is presumed to have committed suicide wilfully; and with the person who commits suicide wilfully we do not occupy ourselves in any respect.</p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. If a person was found strangled or hanging from a tree or lying dead on a sword, he is presumed not to have committed suicide wilfully, and none [of the rites] are withheld from him.</p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. It is related of the son of Gorgias<sup><xref rid="fn3259">7</xref></sup> of Lydda that he ran away from school and his father pointed to his ear.<sup><xref rid="fn3260">8</xref></sup> In fear of his father he went and destroyed himself in a pit.<sup><xref rid="fn3261">9</xref></sup> They went and inquired of R. &#x1E6C;arfon who ruled: We do not withhold anything from him.<sup><xref rid="fn3262">10</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. It is related of a child in Ben&#x00EB; Bera&#x1E33;<sup><xref rid="fn3263">11</xref></sup> that he broke a bottle on the Sabbath and his father pointed to his ear. In fear of his father he went and destroyed himself in a pit. They inquired of R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba who ruled: We do not withhold anything from him.</p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. Hence the Sages ruled: A man should not point at the ear of a child, but either punish him immediately or keep silent and say nothing to him.</p>
<p>R. Simeon b. Eleazar said:<sup><xref rid="fn3264">12</xref></sup> With human nature,<sup><xref rid="fn3265">13</xref></sup> a child and a woman, the left hand should repulse them but the right hand bring them back.<sup><xref rid="fn3266">14</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>. With those executed by a Court we do not occupy ourselves in any respect. Their brothers and relatives come and greet the witnesses and judges<sup><xref rid="fn3267">15</xref></sup> [as if to say], &#x2018;We have no [ill feelings] against you in our hearts because you gave a true judgment&#x2019;. They observe no [public] mourning<sup><xref rid="fn3268">16</xref></sup> for them but grieve, since grief is felt only in the heart.</p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>. R. Nathan said: There is no difference between silence and mourning.<sup><xref rid="fn3269">17</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>. The &#x2018;meal of comfort&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn3270">18</xref></sup> is not eaten in their case, as it is stated, <italic>Ye shall not eat</italic> [anything] <italic>with the blood</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3271">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>[The judges of] a Court who ordered the execution of a man used not to eat anything on that day.<sup><xref rid="fn3272">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>[The condemned] are allowed to converse with their brothers and relatives; and not to delay matters<sup><xref rid="fn3273">21</xref></sup> they are given to drink wine containing frankincense<sup><xref rid="fn3274">22</xref></sup> so that they should not feel grieved. They are urged<sup><xref rid="fn3275">23</xref></sup> to confess, because he who confesses has a portion in the World to Come. We find it so with Achan to whom Joshua said, <italic>My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord, the God of Israel, and make confession unto Him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide nothing from me. And Achan answered Joshua, and said: Of a truth I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3276">24</xref></sup> What is the meaning of <italic>and thus and thus?</italic> It teaches that he violated the ban twice.<sup><xref rid="fn3277">25</xref></sup> [44<italic>b</italic>] <italic>I have sinned</italic>, i.e. I and not my household, I and not my children. This teaches that he truthfully<sup><xref rid="fn3278">26</xref></sup> confessed. And whence do we know that his confession made atonement for him? As it is stated, <italic>And Joshua said: Why hast thou troubled us? The Lord shall trouble thee this day</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3279">27</xref></sup>&#x2014;<italic>this day</italic> art thou to be troubled but thou shalt not be troubled in the World to Come; and it states, <italic>And the sons of Zerah: Zimri, and Ethan, and Heman, and Calcol and Dara: five of them in all.</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3280">28</xref></sup> Do we not know that there were <italic>five of them in all?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3281">29</xref></sup> It teaches that Achan will be with them in the world to come.<sup><xref rid="fn3282">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Similarly one who steals the tax<sup><xref rid="fn3283">31</xref></sup> or anything devoted [to the Sanctuary] is as if he shed blood; and not only is he as if he shed blood, but he is also as if he worships idols, was guilty of immorality and desecrates the Sabbath.<sup><xref rid="fn3284">32</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 10</small>. We do not occupy ourselves with those who separated themselves from the community<sup><xref rid="fn3285">33</xref></sup> in any respect. Their brothers and relatives clothe themselves in white, wrap themselves in white and eat and drink and rejoice because an enemy of the All-present perished; as it is stated, <italic>Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate Thee? And do not I strive with those that rise up against Thee? I hate them with utmost hatred; I count them mine enemies</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3286">34</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 11</small>. We do not withhold mourning rites from those executed by the Government.<sup><xref rid="fn3287">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>When do we begin to count [the days of mourning] for them?<sup><xref rid="fn3288">36</xref></sup> From the time that [the relatives] despaired in their appeal [for the body to be delivered to them for burial], but not [given up the hope] of stealing it. For he who steals is as if he shed blood, and not only is he as if he had shed blood, but also as if he worshipped idols, etc.<sup><xref rid="fn3289">37</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 12</small>. Mourning rites are not withheld in any respect from one who fell into the sea, or was washed away by a stream, or killed by a wild beast. When do we begin to count [the days of mourning] for such as these? From the time that hope of finding them has been given up. If they found a body limb by limb, we do not count [the days of mourning] until the head and greater part [of the torso] is found. R. Judah said: The spine and skull constitute the greater part [of the torso].</p>
<p><small>RULE 13</small>. If one&#x2019;s husband, wife, father or mother had been impaled<sup><xref rid="fn3290">38</xref></sup> in his city, one should not continue to reside there<sup><xref rid="fn3291">39</xref></sup> unless it is a city as big as Antioch.<sup><xref rid="fn3292">40</xref></sup> [Even then] one should not reside in the same side of the city but in another part. Until when is one so forbidden? Until the flesh is completely decomposed and the identity<sup><xref rid="fn3293">41</xref></sup> unrecognizable from the bones.</p>
<p><small>RULE 14</small>. [Beth Shammai said:]<sup><xref rid="fn3294">42</xref></sup> If a man divorced his wife, he should not live in the same alley or courtyard as she.<sup><xref rid="fn3295">43</xref></sup> If the alley belonged to both of them, he transfers the door [of his house] to another side; and if the courtyard belonged to both of them, one vacates it on account of the other, and the woman vacates it on account of the man. This rule only applies if she has remarried<sup><xref rid="fn3296">44</xref></sup> and in the case of the [divorced] wife of a <italic>kohen</italic> even if she has not remarried.<sup><xref rid="fn3297">45</xref></sup> It further applies only if she is divorced after marriage and not after betrothal.<sup><xref rid="fn3298">46</xref></sup> Likewise one who has freed his sister-in-law from the levirate marriage<sup><xref rid="fn3299">47</xref></sup> does not vacate on account of her, because he does not feel attracted to her.</p>

<title>CHAPTER III</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. A child who lived only one day counts to his father and mother as a fully-grown man.<sup><xref rid="fn3300">1</xref></sup> [The words] &#x2018;who lived only one day&#x2019; are not to be taken as an [irreducible] limit;<sup><xref rid="fn3301">2</xref></sup> even if only his head and the greater part of his body came out viable [he is so counted, but in their formulation of the law] the Sages speak of what actually happens.</p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3302">3</xref></sup> [An infant] who is carried in the arms<sup><xref rid="fn3303">4</xref></sup> is buried by one woman and two men.<sup><xref rid="fn3304">5</xref></sup> Abba Saul said: [The burial may be done] by one man and two women. [The Sages] said to him: One woman may be alone with two men, but one man may not be alone with two women.<sup><xref rid="fn3305">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>[The people at the burial] do not stand in line on account of him and they need not recite the mourner&#x2019;s benediction on account of him unless he was thirty days old. If he was thirty days old, he is accompanied [to the grave] by men and women and is carried in a case upon the arms<sup><xref rid="fn3306">7</xref></sup> up to the age of twelve months. If he was twelve months old, he is accompanied by men and women and is carried in a case on the shoulder up to the age of three years. R. Judah said: Should his father desire to honour him, they take him out in a coffin to the cemetery even before<sup><xref rid="fn3307">8</xref></sup> he is three years old.</p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. If three years old he is taken out on a bier. R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: If he is three years old but his limbs are [developed] like those of an infant two years old,<sup><xref rid="fn3308">9</xref></sup> or if he is two years old but his limbs are like those of an infant three years old, he is carried on a bier. Simeon the brother of Azariah said: For anyone who is taken out on a bier the people show their distress.<sup><xref rid="fn3309">10</xref></sup> R. Meir said in the name of R. Eleazar b. Azariah: If he is known to the public at large they participate in connection with him [at the funeral], but if not, they do not participate in connection with him.</p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. R. Judah said in the name of R. Eleazar b. Azariah: For the purpose of a memorial address it is sufficient that his neighbours [know him]. In the case of the poor a memorial address is delivered for a child of three,<sup><xref rid="fn3310">11</xref></sup> and in the case of the rich for a child of four. R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: In the case of the poor, for a child of six and in the case of the rich for a child of seven. The children of the rich are like the children of scholars and the children of scholars like the children of kings.<sup><xref rid="fn3311">12</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. In the case of a child of developed intelligence<sup><xref rid="fn3312">13</xref></sup> we dwell [in the memorial address for him] on his own [good] deeds, but if he has no such deeds we dwell on the deeds of his parents; and if his parents have no such deeds we dwell on the deeds of his relatives. In the case of a bride we dwell on the honour of her father or father-in-law, because she rises [in esteem] with him<sup><xref rid="fn3313">14</xref></sup> but does not fall with him. We may not ascribe merits to one who has none,<sup><xref rid="fn3314">15</xref></sup> but we may magnify those which he possessed.<sup><xref rid="fn3315">16</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3316">17</xref></sup> In Jerusalem there was a saying, &#x2018;Perform actions [which can be lamented] in front of your bier&#x2019;,<sup><xref rid="fn3317">18</xref></sup> and in Judea there was a saying, &#x2018;Perform actions [which can be lamented] behind your bier&#x2019;. For in Jerusalem they recounted in front of a dead man&#x2019;s bier only the merits which he possessed; but in Judea they recounted merits which he possessed and did not possess. They, however, who walked behind the bier only repeated after them the merits which he possessed.<sup><xref rid="fn3318">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>[One who dies] between the ages of three and thirty [is mourned] like a bridegroom;<sup><xref rid="fn3319">20</xref></sup> between thirty and forty like a brother;<sup><xref rid="fn3320">21</xref></sup> between forty and fifty like a father.<sup><xref rid="fn3321">22</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: Between thirty and forty, if he has children or the majority of his own age have children, [he is mourned] like a father; if not, like a brother. Between forty and fifty, if he has children or the majority of his own age have grandchildren, [he is mourned] like a grandfather, if not like a father.<sup><xref rid="fn3322">23</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>.<italic></italic><sup><xref rid="fn3323">24</xref></sup> If one dies under fifty, that is death by <italic>kareth;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3324">25</xref></sup> at fifty-two, that is the death of Samuel of Ramah; at sixty, that is the death referred to in the Torah, as it is stated, <italic>Thou shalt come to thy grave in ripe age;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3325">26</xref></sup> at seventy, that is the death of the hoary head, as it is stated, <italic>The days of our years are threescore years and ten;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3326">27</xref></sup> at eighty, that is the death of a vigorous old man,<sup><xref rid="fn3327">28</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>Or even by strength fourscore years</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3328">29</xref></sup> More than this is a life of trouble, for so<sup><xref rid="fn3329">30</xref></sup> <italic>Barzilai the Gileadite said to David, I am this day fourscore years old; can I discern between good and bad?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3330">31</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>. If one dies after [an illness of] one day, that is a death by [divine] wrath;<sup><xref rid="fn3331">32</xref></sup> after two days, it is a precipitous death; after three days, it is a death by pestilence; after four days, it is a hurried death; after six days, it is the death decreed in the Torah;<sup><xref rid="fn3332">33</xref></sup> after seven days, it is a death of [divine] love; after a longer period, it is a death of suffering.</p>
<p><small>RULE 10</small>. R. &#x1E24;anina b. Antigonos said: An old man who eats forbidden fat<sup><xref rid="fn3333">34</xref></sup> or one who desecrates the Sabbath dies by <italic>kareth</italic>. And what is there to show us that they died by <italic>kareth?</italic> But he who dies after [an illness of] three days dies by <italic>kareth;</italic> after four by a hurried death; after six, it is the death decreed in the Torah; after seven it is a death of [divine] love; after a longer period it is a death by suffering.</p>
<p>R. Judah said:<sup><xref rid="fn3334">35</xref></sup> The pious men of former times used to suffer with stomach trouble for about twenty days before death in order to be cleansed of everything, so that they should come pure<sup><xref rid="fn3335">36</xref></sup> into the World to Come;<sup><xref rid="fn3336">37</xref></sup> as it is said, <italic>The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold, and a man is tried by his praise</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3337">38</xref></sup> [45<italic>a</italic>].</p>

<ftnote id="fn3310">(11) The child being a greater joy to poor parents who have few pleasures in life, and so his death is a greater loss.</ftnote>

<p><small>RULE 1</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3338">1</xref></sup> For all [the nearest of kin] for whom a <italic>kohen</italic> defiles himself as commanded in the Torah<sup><xref rid="fn3339">2</xref></sup> [a mourner must observe mourning], viz. for his father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister and wife.<sup><xref rid="fn3340">3</xref></sup> R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: For relatives in the second degree<sup><xref rid="fn3341">4</xref></sup> he observes the periods of mourning and grieves,<sup><xref rid="fn3342">5</xref></sup> [but should he be a <italic>kohen</italic>] he does not defile himself.</p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: He mourns for his father&#x2019;s father and son&#x2019;s son.<sup><xref rid="fn3343">6</xref></sup> But the Sages said: For whomsoever he mourns he should mourn with, and for whomsoever he does not mourn, he does not mourn with.<sup><xref rid="fn3344">7</xref></sup> If there is a doubt whether [the deceased] is a brother or not<sup><xref rid="fn3345">8</xref></sup> or whether he is his son or not, he mourns and grieves for him, but [if he is a <italic>kohen</italic>] he does not defile himself for him.</p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. For his betrothed wife one does not mourn, grieve,<sup><xref rid="fn3346">9</xref></sup> or [if a <italic>kohen</italic>] defile himself.<sup><xref rid="fn3347">10</xref></sup> For his divorced wife, although he had children by her, he does not mourn, grieve, or [if a <italic>kohen</italic>] defile himself.</p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. Which is [the period of] &#x2018;grieving&#x2019;? From the day of the death until the day of the burial, according to R. Meir; but the Sages said: &#x2018;Grieving&#x2019; is only for one day.<sup><xref rid="fn3348">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>If a High Priest is married to a widow or an ordinary <italic>kohen</italic> to a divorced woman or one freed<sup><xref rid="fn3349">12</xref></sup> from levirate marriage, he mourns and grieves for her but does not defile himself.</p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. For his betrothed sister, R. Meir said that [a <italic>kohen</italic>] defiles himself. R. Judah and R. Simeon said that he does not.<sup><xref rid="fn3350">13</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. For [his sister who was] &#x2018;wounded&#x2019;,<sup><xref rid="fn3351">14</xref></sup> R. Judah said that [a <italic>kohen</italic>] defiles himself. R. Meir and R. Simeon said that he does not. For a woman who was raped or seduced, all agree that [a <italic>kohen</italic>] does not defile himself. For an adolescent,<sup><xref rid="fn3352">15</xref></sup> all agree that he defiles himself.</p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>. The general principle laid down by R. Simeon is: He defiles himself for any one who is eligible [to marry] a High Priest, but may not defile himself for one who is not eligible [to marry] a High Priest.</p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>. Of all those regarding whom they said that a <italic>kohen</italic> defiles himself, the defilement is not voluntary but obligatory. R. Simeon said: It is voluntary. R. Joshua said: It is obligatory.<sup><xref rid="fn3353">16</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>. It is related of Joseph, a <italic>kohen</italic>, that his wife died on the eve of Passover and he would not defile himself for her. His colleagues pushed him<sup><xref rid="fn3354">17</xref></sup> and defiled him forcibly. Defilement is not voluntary but compulsory.</p>
<p><small>RULE 10</small>. Until how long is it one&#x2019;s duty to defile himself for her? R. Meir said: The whole of that day;<sup><xref rid="fn3355">18</xref></sup> R. Judah said: Up to three hours. R. Judah said in the name of R. &#x1E6C;arfon: Until the top stone closes the grave.<sup><xref rid="fn3356">19</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 11</small>. It is related that when R. Simeon b. Yeho&#x1E93;ada&#x1E33; died in Lydda, his brother Jo&#x1E25;anan came from Galilee to defile himself for him after the top stone had closed the grave. They went and inquired of the Sages who said: He may not defile himself, but open the grave for him that he may view [the body].</p>
<p><small>RULE 12</small>. It is related<sup><xref rid="fn3357">20</xref></sup> of a boy<sup><xref rid="fn3358">21</xref></sup> that he willed away his property to strangers and left his family out. They protested saying, &#x2018;Let [his body] be examined&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn3359">22</xref></sup> They went and inquired of the Sages who said, &#x2018;The body may not be examined; after the top stone has closed the grave, a corpse may not be moved from his place&#x2019;. Another explanation is: Since he is dead, his hair has undergone change.<sup><xref rid="fn3360">23</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 13</small>. An ordinary <italic>kohen</italic> who defiled himself for his near kin may not defile himself for strangers even on the same day.<sup><xref rid="fn3361">24</xref></sup> This rule applies only when there are sufficient to carry the bier and bury him, but if there are not sufficient to carry the bier and bury him, then he must defile himself.<sup><xref rid="fn3362">25</xref></sup> Should he have defiled himself and sufficient people come to carry the bier and bury, he must withdraw to a place of cleanness.</p>
<p><small>RULE 14</small>. Should there be two roads [for his return from the cemetery] one short but [ritually] unclean and one long but [ritually] clean, if the other persons take the longer road he should go with them; and if they do not, he should take the unclean road out of respect for the people.<sup><xref rid="fn3363">26</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 15</small>. While he stands and buries his dead he may, during the time he is standing in the grave, receive [a body] for burial from others;<sup><xref rid="fn3364">27</xref></sup> but once he has withdrawn from the grave he may not defile himself.</p>
<p><small>RULE 16</small>. If he defiles himself [for a stranger] on the same day [as for another], R. &#x1E6C;arfon deems him culpable, but R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba frees him from culpability. If he defiles himself the next day, all are agreed that he is culpable, because he has rendered one day [of his mourning] void.<sup><xref rid="fn3365">28</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 17</small>. A <italic>kohen</italic> must defile himself for his near kin even when they have a disqualification;<sup><xref rid="fn3366">29</xref></sup> for his son and daughter who are <italic>Nethinim</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3367">30</xref></sup> or illegitimate;<sup><xref rid="fn3368">31</xref></sup> for his brother and sister who are <italic>Nethinim</italic> or illegitimate; but not for any issue he may have from a slave or a non-Jewess (nor from the issue he may have from another source).<sup><xref rid="fn3369">32</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 18</small>. If there is a doubt whether [the deceased] is his brother or not or whether he is his son or not, he mourns and grieves but [if a <italic>kohen</italic>] he does not defile himself.<sup><xref rid="fn3370">33</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 19</small>. How long is [the period of] &#x2018;grieving&#x2019;? From the day of the death until the day of the burial, according to the view of R. Meir; but the Sages said: &#x2018;Grieving&#x2019; is for one day only.</p>
<p><small>RULE 20</small>. A High Priest who defiles himself for the dead, lets the hair of his head go loose, or rends his garments,<sup><xref rid="fn3371">34</xref></sup> receives forty lashes.<sup><xref rid="fn3372">35</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 21</small>. Any defilement contracted by a Nazirite from the dead and for which he must shave his head,<sup><xref rid="fn3373">36</xref></sup> if contracted by a High Priest he receives forty lashes for it; but [for those defilements for which] the Nazirite has not to shave his head, [if contracted by a High Priest], he does not receive forty lashes.<sup><xref rid="fn3374">37</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 22</small>. A High Priest<sup><xref rid="fn3375">38</xref></sup> who defiles himself or enters a cemetery receives forty lashes.</p>
<p><small>RULE 23</small>. If [a <italic>kohen</italic>] entered<sup><xref rid="fn3376">39</xref></sup> the residence of non-Jews<sup><xref rid="fn3377">40</xref></sup> or the territory of Gentiles<sup><xref rid="fn3378">41</xref></sup> or a <italic>beth happeras</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3379">42</xref></sup> or goes outside the land [of Israel],<sup><xref rid="fn3380">43</xref></sup> he receives punishment for disobedience.<sup><xref rid="fn3381">44</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 24</small>. If he enters a field wherein [the location of] a grave had disappeared, he is not culpable unless he traverses the whole of it.<sup><xref rid="fn3382">45</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 25</small>. A <italic>kohen</italic> may defile himself by going outside the land [of Israel] for the purpose of [dealing with a non-Jewish Court in] a civil suit or a capital charge, to announce the new moon or intercalate the year, or to rescue his field from a non-Jew, even if he only goes to protest [against his taking possession of it].<sup><xref rid="fn3383">46</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 26</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3384">47</xref></sup> [He may go outside the land of Israel] to study Torah or to take a wife. R. Judah said: If he has nowhere else to study he may so defile himself, otherwise he may not. R. Jose said: Even though he has elsewhere to study he may defile himself, because no one is so meritorious as to be able to learn Torah from any man. It is related of Jose the Babylonian that he defiled himself by going outside the land [of Israel to study Torah] with R. Jose in Zidon.<sup><xref rid="fn3385">48</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 27</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3386">49</xref></sup> A <italic>kohen</italic> must defile himself for [the burial of] a bone from his father&#x2019;s [corpse] of the size of a barleycorn,<sup><xref rid="fn3387">50</xref></sup> but he may not defile himself for a limb severed from a living person be it even that of his father. R. Judah said: At first [a <italic>kohan</italic>] may not defile himself for a limb severed from a corpse, be it even that of his father.</p>
<p><small>RULE 28</small>. It is related of Joseph [the son of] Pis&#x1E33;as<sup><xref rid="fn3388">51</xref></sup> who had a swelling on his foot that a doctor came to remove it. He said to him, &#x2018;When you have left as much as a single hair, tell me&#x2019;. He cut the abscess, and when he had left only as much as a single hair,<sup><xref rid="fn3389">52</xref></sup> he informed him. He called his son Ne&#x1E25;unia and said to him, &#x2018;My son, until now it was your duty to attend to me, but now go your way; for the Sages said, &#x201C;One must not defile himself for a limb that was severed from a living person, even if it be his father&#x2019;s&#x201D; &#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn3390">53</xref></sup> When the Sages heard of it they said, &#x2018;Of such a man as he it has been stated, <italic>My soul is continually in my hand; yet have I not forgotten Thy law;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3391">54</xref></sup> [and it further states,] <italic>There is a righteous man that perisheth in his righteousness</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3392">55</xref></sup> <italic>and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his evil-doing.&#x2019;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3393">56</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 29</small>. If he found a <italic>meth mi&#x1E93;wah</italic>, he must attend to him and bury him. Which is a <italic>meth mi&#x1E93;wah.?</italic> When [he who finds the body] cries out and the inhabitants of the city cannot hear his voice; but if they can hear his voice, it is not a <italic>meth mi&#x1E93;wah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3394">57</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 30</small>. [The body remains] a <italic>meth mi&#x1E93;wah</italic> until sufficient people arrive to carry the bier and bury him; but once there are sufficient to carry the bier and bury him it is no longer a <italic>meth mi&#x1E93;wah</italic>. [45<italic>b</italic>]</p>
<p><small>RULE 31</small>. If a High Priest<sup><xref rid="fn3395">58</xref></sup> and a Nazirite [found a <italic>meth mi&#x1E93;wah</italic>], R. Eliezer said that the High Priest should defile himself and not the Nazirite, because the latter must offer a sacrifice on his defilement<sup><xref rid="fn3396">59</xref></sup> whereas the former does not. But the Sages said: The Nazirite should defile himself even if he has to bring a hundred sacrifices, and let not the High Priest<sup><xref rid="fn3397">60</xref></sup> defile himself, because the one is consecrated from the womb and the other is not,<sup><xref rid="fn3398">61</xref></sup> and the consecration of the one is temporary<sup><xref rid="fn3399">62</xref></sup> and that of the other permanent.</p>
<p><small>RULE 32</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3400">63</xref></sup> All are agreed that [in the case of the High] Priest anointed with the oil of anointing<sup><xref rid="fn3401">64</xref></sup> and [the High Priest robed] in many vestments,<sup><xref rid="fn3402">65</xref></sup> the latter must defile himself.<sup><xref rid="fn3403">66</xref></sup> As between a [High Priest robed] in many vestments and a deputy [High Priest] who had been anointed,<sup><xref rid="fn3404">67</xref></sup> the latter must defile himself. As between a deputy [High Priest] and a <italic>memunneh</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3405">68</xref></sup> the latter must defile himself. As between a <italic>memunneh</italic> and a <italic>kohen</italic> anointed for war,<sup><xref rid="fn3406">69</xref></sup> the latter must defile himself. As between a <italic>kohen</italic> anointed for war and an ordinary <italic>kohen</italic>, the latter must defile himself.<sup><xref rid="fn3407">70</xref></sup> As between an ordinary <italic>kohen</italic> and a Levite, the Levite must defile himself.<sup><xref rid="fn3408">71</xref></sup> As between a Levite and a lay-Israelite, the latter must defile himself.<sup><xref rid="fn3409">72</xref></sup> If, however, the two [who find a <italic>meth mi&#x1E93;wah</italic>] are of equal status, the quicker of the two must defile himself; and if the two of them are [equally] quick, then whichever of them wishes to do so should defile himself.</p>
<p><small>RULE 33</small>. If they found [the body] between a ploughed field and a fallow field, they bury him in the fallow field;<sup><xref rid="fn3410">73</xref></sup> between a ploughed field and a field sown with seeds, they bury him in the ploughed field; between a field sown with seeds and an orchard, they bury him in the field sown with seeds; between an orchard and a vineyard,<sup><xref rid="fn3411">74</xref></sup> they bury him in the orchard. If both are alike, they bury him in the nearer of the two; and if they are equidistant,<sup><xref rid="fn3412">75</xref></sup> they bury him in whichever of them they desire.</p>
<p><small>RULE 34</small>. R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: This was the beginning of my ministration<sup><xref rid="fn3413">76</xref></sup> before the Sages. I once went out early and found the body of a man who had been killed. I took charge of him for a distance of three Sabbath-limits<sup><xref rid="fn3414">77</xref></sup> until I brought him to a place of burial and buried him. When I came and discussed the matter before the Sages, they said to me, &#x2018;For each step you took it will be accounted to you as if you had committed murder&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn3415">78</xref></sup> I then argued from the less to the greater as a result of my experience:<sup><xref rid="fn3416">79</xref></sup> if when I intended to perform a meritorious act I rendered myself culpable, how much more so if I had not intended to perform a meritorious act&#x0021;&#x2019; Whenever a person repeated this incident before R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba, he exclaimed, &#x2018;This was the beginning of my ministration [before the Sages]&#x2019;.</p>
<ftnote id="fn3338">(1) Cf. M.&#x1E32;. 20b (Sonc. ed., p. 130).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3339">(2) Lev. XXI, 2f.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3340">(3) So GRA and H. V reads &#x2018;wife and sister&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3341">(4) i.e. his grandfather, grandchildren and nephews (Rashi to M.&#x1E32;. <italic>loc. cit.</italic>). In Sonc. ed., p. 130, n. 7 the enumeration is grandfather, grandmother, grandchildren and the brothers and sisters of parents.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3342">(5) While waiting for the funeral to take place; cf. Rule 19 below.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3343">(6) R. Simeon either interprets that R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba excludes the daughter&#x2019;s son and the sister&#x2019;s son, or differs from him in that he holds that one mourns only for these two relatives in the second degree.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3344">(7) As one mourns in sympathy with one&#x2019;s father on the death of his father, so should a father mourn with his son on the death of the latter&#x2019;s son.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3345">(8) Where the identity of the child at birth or in infancy became confused. j.Yeb. XI, 7, 12a cites an actual case.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3346">(9) &#x2018;Or grieve&#x2019; is added by GRA and H.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3347">(10) The duty of mourning, etc., for a wife devolves upon the husband only when she can be termed <italic>his kin</italic> (Lev. XXI, 2). The betrothed woman does not come in this category and the divorced wife has lost that status (cf. Sanh. 28b, Sonc. ed., p. 171). See also Yeb. 22a (Sonc. ed., p. 132), 29b (Sonc. ed., p. 183).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3348">(11) Cf. Zeb. 100b (Sonc. ed., pp. 483f).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3349">(12) Although such marriages are forbidden (Lev. XXI, 7, 14, the levirate woman being treated in Rabbinic law as a divorced woman), yet if contracted they are valid; but being irregular, they come under the prohibition of <italic>ibid</italic>. 2 (priests in general) and <italic>ibid</italic>. XXI, 11 (the High Priest). Cf. Yeb. 90b (Sonc. ed., p. 616), &#x2018;but he may not defile himself for his unlawful wife&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3350">(13) Lev. XXI, 3, <italic>and for his sister a virgin</italic>, betrothal being a form of marriage; cf. Yeb. 60a (Sonc. ed., pp. 400f).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3351">(14) lit. &#x2018;struck by wood&#x2019;, viz. one who lost her hymen as the result of a blow; Yeb. <italic>loc. cit.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3352">(15) i.e. over the age of twelve years and six months.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3353">(16) The phrase <italic>for her he defiles</italic> [<italic>E.V. may he defile</italic>] <italic>himself</italic> (Lev. XXI, 3) is to be understood as an obligation; cf. Zeb. 100a (Sonc. ed., p. 480).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3354">(17) He forced him to make contact with the corpse; Zeb. <italic>loc. cit.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3355">(18) i.e. of the death. The funeral generally took place on the same day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3356">(19) Cf. Nazir, Sonc. ed., p. 202, n. 5.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3357">(20) Cf. B.B. 154a (Sonc. ed., p. 669).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3358">(21) A minor under thirteen years and one day, who could not legally dispose of his property.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3359">(22) i.e. let the body be exhumed and his age ascertained from the presence or absence of signs of puberty.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3360">(23) Therefore the examination cannot produce decisive evidence of age.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3361">(24) Cf. Nazir 42b (Sonc. ed., pp. 154f).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3362">(25) Then it is a case of <italic>meth mi&#x1E93;wah</italic> (v. Glos.).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3363">(26) This is the reading of H.V has &#x2018;respect for the Name&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3364">(27) As he is engaged in burying his dead, the new burial merely prolongs his uncleanness; cf. Nazir 42b (Sonc. ed., p. 155).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3365">(28) i.e. he has to begin afresh the seven days of mourning.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3366">(29) If they are his children by marriage to a divorced woman, etc. (cf. Lev. XXI, 7).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3367">(30) The name given to the descendants of the Gibeonites whom Joshua made hewers of wood and drawers of water (Josh. IX).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3368">(31) The issue of an incestuous marriage.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3369">(32) The clause in brackets is omitted by GRA. It may, however, refer to the issue of one who left the community.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3370">(33) Repeated from the latter part of Rule 2, and Rule 19 is repeated from Rule 4.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3371">(34) Cf. Lev. XXI, 10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3372">(35) Cf. Tosiftha Mak. IV, 17.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3373">(36) Cf. Num. VI, 9.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3374">(37) Cf. Nazir 49b (Sonc. ed., p. 184). If, e.g., the Nazirite came in contact with a corpse or the flesh of a corpse of the size of an olive.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3375">(38) This Rule virtually repeats Rule 20 and is deleted by GRA.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3376">(39) So GRA and H. V reads &#x2018;although they entered&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3377">(40) Who do not conform to the laws of uncleanness and he is therefore liable to contract defilement.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3378">(41) i.e. a district in Palestine which is inhabited only by non-Jews.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3379">(42) The noun <italic>peras</italic> denotes &#x2018;half&#x2019; the length of a furrow. A <italic>beth happera</italic> is defined by Jastrow as &#x2018;an area of a square <italic>peras</italic>, especially a field, of a square <italic>peras</italic>, declared unclean on account of crushed bones carried over it from a ploughed grave&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3380">(43) Where the laws of uncleanness are not observed by the inhabitants.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3381">(44) Unlike the forty stripes which is the punishment for certain offences, this penalty is left to the discretion of the Court and is consequently a Rabbinical form of punishment.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3382">(45) Then he must have come in contact with it.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3383">(46) Cf. &#x2018;A.Z. 13a (Sonc. ed., p. 66).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3384">(47) <italic>ibid</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3385">(48) In Ph&#x0153;nicia.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn3388">(51) Cf. j.Nazir VII, 1, 55d. The text here is corrupt and the reading of GRA which agrees with the Talmud is followed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3389">(52) i.e. the swelling was hanging from the foot as by a hair.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3390">(53) Joseph was a <italic>kohen</italic>.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3391">(54) Ps. CXIX, 109.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn3401">(64) All High Priests, beginning with Aaron, were consecrated with oil. During the reign of Josiah this ceremony ceased because the king had concealed the flask of special oil used for the ceremony (Hor. 12a, Sonc. ed., p. 85).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3402">(65) During the Second Temple the High Priest was not anointed, and was only distinguished from the ordinary priests by wearing a larger number of vestments when officiating, eight as against their four.

<title>CHAPTER V</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. A mourner is forbidden to do work<sup><xref rid="fn3417">1</xref></sup> throughout the seven days<sup><xref rid="fn3418">2</xref></sup> [of mourning], he, his sons and daughters,<sup><xref rid="fn3419">3</xref></sup> his male and female slaves and his cattle; and as he<sup><xref rid="fn3420">4</xref></sup> is forbidden to do work, so too others are forbidden to do work for him.</p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. They may do work for him in connection with perishable things; they may gather his harvest for him, operate his wine-press for him and bung<sup><xref rid="fn3421">5</xref></sup> his casks. If his olives had been turned,<sup><xref rid="fn3422">6</xref></sup> R. Judah says that he may put on the first<sup><xref rid="fn3423">7</xref></sup> beam and after his mourning he completes the work. R. Jose said to him, &#x2018;But they are perishable things&#x0021; He may complete [the whole operation in his mourning]&#x2019;.</p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. With regard to his flax [which is ready] for lifting from the retting and his wool [ready] for lifting from the dye-bath, if there are others [to do the work] they should lift it,<sup><xref rid="fn3424">8</xref></sup> but if not he may lift it in private.<sup><xref rid="fn3425">9</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. If his cask [of wine] is [ready] for bunging, R. Judah says that they cover it with shingles<sup><xref rid="fn3426">10</xref></sup> and after the mourning he completes [the work]. R. Jose said to him, &#x2018;But it is perishable &#x0021; He<sup><xref rid="fn3427">11</xref></sup> may complete [the whole operation in his mourning]&#x2019;.</p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. They may besprinkle his white field<sup><xref rid="fn3428">12</xref></sup> but may not<sup><xref rid="fn3429">13</xref></sup> sow it; they may sow for him a strip [of field] for a crop of flax when his turn for watering rights comes, according to R. Eliezer; but the Sages said: If he had not already sown it with flax, he should sow it with another kind [of crops], and if he does not sow it that week, he can sow it the following week.<sup><xref rid="fn3430">14</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. If he is a baker in the town and there is no other, he may do the work in private out of respect<sup><xref rid="fn3431">15</xref></sup> for the public.</p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>. R. Simeon b. Yo&#x1E25;ai<sup><xref rid="fn3432">16</xref></sup> said: If he is a hair-dresser or a bath-attendant in the service of the public, and a Festival is close at hand, he may do the work in private out of respect for the public.</p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>. If he is engaged in cutting a person&#x2019;s hair and people come and tell him, &#x2018;Your father is dead&#x2019;, he should complete the work; this applies whether he is the hair-dresser or he is having his hair dressed. Workmen who have undertaken to do work for a mourner are forbidden to do it in his house but may do it in their own. R. Simeon b. Yo&#x1E25;ai<sup><xref rid="fn3433">17</xref></sup> said: A workman hired by the day is forbidden<sup><xref rid="fn3434">18</xref></sup> to do work in either [place]; a workman on a contract basis<sup><xref rid="fn3435">19</xref></sup> is forbidden [to do it in the mourner&#x2019;s] house, but may do it in his own home. If it is work in connection with objects attached to the ground, it is forbidden [to do the work in either place];<sup><xref rid="fn3436">20</xref></sup> in another town it is permitted in either case.<sup><xref rid="fn3437">21</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>. A mourner overtaken by his days of mourning<sup><xref rid="fn3438">22</xref></sup> may ease [his hair] with a shearing-knife or a clipping-tool,<sup><xref rid="fn3439">23</xref></sup> but not with a scissors; and if his clothes are soiled he may wash them in cold water but not in urine.<sup><xref rid="fn3440">24</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 10</small>. A mourner and an excommunicated person who are travelling on the road are permitted to wear their shoes, but as soon as they reach a city they must remove them. The same rule applies [to everybody] on the Ninth of <italic>Ab</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3441">25</xref></sup> and on a public fast day.<sup><xref rid="fn3442">26</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 11</small>. An excommunicated person who died has to be &#x2018;stoned&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn3443">27</xref></sup>&#x2014;not that they place a high heap of stones upon him, as in the case of Achan<sup><xref rid="fn3444">28</xref></sup>&#x2014;but the messenger of the <italic>Beth Din</italic> takes a stone and places it on the coffin in order to fulfil the duty of &#x2018;stoning&#x2019; in his case.<sup><xref rid="fn3445">29</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 12</small>. An excommunicated person may not read a passage of Scripture to others nor may others read it to him; he may not teach nor may others teach him; but he may read Scripture and study for himself so as not to forget his learning.<sup><xref rid="fn3446">30</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 13</small>. He may be hired to work and others may hire themselves to him for work; not for his profit, but in order not to close the door before him.<sup><xref rid="fn3447">31</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 14</small>. One who is placed under excommunication by his city is not<sup><xref rid="fn3448">32</xref></sup> considered to be under it in another city; [46<italic>a</italic>] one under the ban to the disciples is not under the ban to the Sages; one under the ban to the Sages is under the ban to the disciples; one under the ban to all the people is not under the ban to the <italic>Nasi&#x2019;;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3449">33</xref></sup> one under the ban to the <italic>Nasi&#x2019;</italic> is under the ban to all the people.</p>
<p><small>RULE 15</small>. If one of those who had placed a person under the ban dies, should he have given authority to his colleagues [to annul the ban], they free him, otherwise they do not.<sup><xref rid="fn3450">34</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 16</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3451">35</xref></sup> No ban holds for less than thirty days, and no &#x2018;reproof&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn3452">36</xref></sup> for less than seven days.</p>
<p><small>RULE 17</small>. Rabban Gamaliel said: Any one against whom the Sages pronounce excommunication,<sup><xref rid="fn3453">37</xref></sup> even if they later received him back, does not leave the world in peace.<sup><xref rid="fn3454">38</xref></sup></p>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER VI</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3455">1</xref></sup> A mourner is forbidden to read the Pentateuch, Prophets and Hagiographa;<sup><xref rid="fn3456">2</xref></sup> he is also forbidden to study Mishnah, Talmud, <italic>halakoth</italic> and <italic>&#x2019;aggadoth</italic>. He is under the prohibition to bathe, anoint [the body], put on sandals<sup><xref rid="fn3457">3</xref></sup> and cohabit. He is obliged to cover his head and overturn his couch.<sup><xref rid="fn3458">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is related of Rabban Gamaliel<sup><xref rid="fn3459">5</xref></sup> that when his wife died he bathed on the first night. His disciples said to him, &#x2018;Master, have you not taught us that a mourner is forbidden to bathe?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;I am not like other men, I am delicate&#x2019;.</p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3460">6</xref></sup> If people greet him, he should say to them, &#x2018;I am a mourner&#x2019;. On the first day and on the second day he should say to them, &#x2018;I am a mourner&#x2019;, but on the third day he may return their salutation in a low voice, although he may not greet them.<sup><xref rid="fn3461">7</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. On the first day he does not put on the <italic>tefillin;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3462">8</xref></sup> on the second day he puts them on and if people come to comfort him he takes them off, according to the view of R. Eliezer. R. Joshua said: On the first and second day he does not put on the <italic>tefillin;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3462">8</xref></sup> on the third day he puts them on and if people come to comfort him he takes them off.<sup><xref rid="fn3463">9</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. If [another] death took place in that city, on the first and second day [of his own mourning] he does not go out with [the other mourners],<sup><xref rid="fn3464">10</xref></sup> but on the third day he goes out with them and stands in the line to receive condolence but not to offer comfort to the others. This only holds good when there are sufficient people to carry the bier and do the burial, but if there are not sufficient he goes out with them even on the first day.<sup><xref rid="fn3465">11</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. If he came from another district to his relatives, on the second and third day he completes [the days of his mourning] with them, but from the fourth day he counts [the remaining period of mourning] on his own.<sup><xref rid="fn3466">12</xref></sup> R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: If he found them still sitting [as mourners] even if it is the seventh day<sup><xref rid="fn3467">13</xref></sup> he completes [the period] with them; and if he did not find them sitting [as mourners] even if it be the second day he counts on his own.</p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. On the first and second day, he may not do work even if he is in receipt of charity.<sup><xref rid="fn3468">14</xref></sup> On the third day he may<sup><xref rid="fn3469">15</xref></sup> work but in private.</p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3470">16</xref></sup> He may not work in a field adjoining the city or the road, but he may work privately in his own garden. Likewise a woman may not work on top of the roof or within the courtyard, but she may work privately in her house so long as she is not overlooked by her neighbours.<sup><xref rid="fn3471">17</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>. [The period of] three days applies to a dog which devoured [some of] the flesh of a corpse and entered a house. If this happened after three days the house is clean, if less it is unclean.<sup><xref rid="fn3472">18</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>. [The period of] three days<sup><xref rid="fn3473">19</xref></sup> applies to any of the five species<sup><xref rid="fn3474">20</xref></sup> [of grain] sown; [if three days] before Passover it is permitted [to be eaten], if less than this it is prohibited.<sup><xref rid="fn3475">21</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 10</small>. One should not go out with a caravan less than three days before the Sabbath.</p>
<p>One may not go out to war,<sup><xref rid="fn3476">22</xref></sup> if it is of a voluntary nature,<sup><xref rid="fn3477">23</xref></sup> less than three days before the Sabbath. One may not set out on a ship less than three days before the Sabbath.<sup><xref rid="fn3478">24</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 11</small>. On the first and second day [of mourning] he may not enter the Temple Mount; on the third day he may enter but must go round to the left.<sup><xref rid="fn3479">25</xref></sup> These are they who must go round to the left: a mourner, an excommunicated person, one who has a sick person in his house, and one who lost an object. [When asked,] &#x2018;Why do you<sup><xref rid="fn3480">26</xref></sup> go round to the left?&#x2019; [he answers,] &#x2018;Because I am a mourner&#x2019;. They reply, &#x2018;May He Who dwells in this House comfort you&#x2019;. [If he says,] &#x2018;Because I am under a ban&#x2019;, [they reply,] &#x2018;May He Who dwells in this House put it into their heart to draw you near&#x2019;; so said R. Meir. R. Jose said to him, &#x2018;You make out as if they [who banned] passed a wrong judgment on him; but [what they say is,] &#x201C;May He Who dwells in this house put it into your heart to hearken to the words of your colleagues so that they may draw you near&#x201D; &#x2019;. To one who has a sick person in his house they say, &#x2018;May He Who dwells in this House have mercy upon him&#x2019;; and if he is barely living<sup><xref rid="fn3481">27</xref></sup> [they say,] &#x2018;May He have mercy upon him immediately&#x2019;. It is related of a certain woman whose daughter was ill that she ascended the Temple Mount and went round it, and did not move from there until they came and told her, &#x2018;She is cured&#x2019;.</p>
<p>To one who lost some object they say, &#x2018;May He Who dwells in this House put it into the heart of the finder to return it to you at once&#x2019;. It is related of Eleazar b. &#x1E24;ananiah b. Hezekiah b. Gorion that he lost a scroll of the Torah which he had bought for one hundred <italic>minas</italic>. He ascended [the Temple Mount], went round it and did not move from there until they came and told him, &#x2018;The scroll of the Torah has been found&#x2019;.</p>
<p><small>RULE 12</small>. From the beginning Solomon built the Temple only on condition that anyone in trouble would come there and pray; as it is stated, <italic>If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be; what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3482">28</xref></sup> I have here only the case of an individual; whence do we know that it also holds good of a community? The text continues, <italic>Of all Thy people Israel</italic>. Whence do we know that it holds good of the non-Jew? The text states, <italic>Moreover concerning the stranger that is not of Thy people Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3483">29</xref></sup> From the words <italic>be made by any man</italic> you might think that it holds good of one who wants children or possessions which will not be for his welfare; hence Scripture states, <italic>For Thou, even Thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3484">30</xref></sup>&#x2014;what is good for him do Thou give to him. And whence do we know that this holds good only if they do not continue in their rebellion? As it is stated, <italic>Who shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3485">31</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn3455">(1) For a full discussion of what is prohibited to a mourner, cf. M.&#x1E32;. 15a, b and 21a, b (Sonc. ed., pp. 90ff, 133ff). The law is based on Ezek. XXIV, 17, 23 where the prophet is warned not to observe the usual rites of mourning.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3456">(2) Because the study of the Torah is a joy.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3457">(3) These and covering the head are signs of mourning; cf. 2 Sam. XV, 30, Jer. XIV, 3f, Esth. VI, 12.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3458">(4) Cf.

<title>CHAPTER VII</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. The Sabbath enters into the number of the days of mourning<sup><xref rid="fn3486">1</xref></sup> but does not interrupt;<sup><xref rid="fn3487">2</xref></sup> Festivals interrupt<sup><xref rid="fn3488">3</xref></sup> but do not enter into the number.<sup><xref rid="fn3489">4</xref></sup> R. Eliezer said: Since the destruction of the Temple, &#x2018;<italic>A&#x1E93;ereth</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3490">5</xref></sup> is reckoned as the Sabbath [during the period of mourning]. Rabban Gamaliel<sup><xref rid="fn3491">6</xref></sup> said: New Year and the Day of Atonement are [in this respect] like the Festivals; but the Sages say: The rule is according to the view of neither, but &#x2018;<italic>A&#x1E93;ereth</italic> is like the Festivals and the New Year and Day of Atonement are like the Sabbath.</p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. If a man suffered a bereavement one day before a Festival, he interrupts [his mourning] throughout the Festival and counts six days [of mourning] after the Festival; if three days before the Festival he does not need to overturn his couch<sup><xref rid="fn3492">7</xref></sup> [after the Festival] according to R. Eliezer;<sup><xref rid="fn3493">8</xref></sup> but the Sages said: Even one day, or even one hour [before the Festival]. R. Eliezer b. R. Simeon said: These are the very words of Beth Shammai, and also the very words of Beth Hillel; because Beth Shammai said, &#x2018;Three days before a Festival&#x2019; and Beth Hillel said, &#x2018;Even one day and even one hour&#x2019;. [46<italic>b</italic>]</p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. Abba Saul said: If one buried his dead three days before a Festival, the restrictions<sup><xref rid="fn3494">9</xref></sup> appertaining to the seven days&#x2019; mourning cease to apply to him; if eight days before a Festival, the restrictions of the thirty days cease to apply<sup><xref rid="fn3495">10</xref></sup> (and the ruling is in accordance with this statement).<sup><xref rid="fn3496">11</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. [Should the death occur] eight days before a Festival, if he wishes to cut his hair or wash his clothes on the eve of the Festival he may do so; if he did not cut his hair or wash his clothes on the eve of the Festival, he may not do so until the thirty days are completed.</p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. [If the death occurs] two days within the Festival,<sup><xref rid="fn3497">12</xref></sup> he interrupts [the mourning] for all the Festival and counts seven [days] after it, and people occupy themselves<sup><xref rid="fn3498">13</xref></sup> with him for the five days after the Festival. [If the death occurs] seven days within the Festival, he interrupts [the mourning] for all the Festival and counts [seven days] after the Festival, and the community do not occupy themselves with him at all after the Festival.<sup><xref rid="fn3499">14</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. On the days which he counts after a Festival, neither his slave nor his cattle need abstain from work; only he and his near kin conduct themselves like mourners.</p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>. A Festival is reckoned for the mourner into the count of the thirty [days]<sup><xref rid="fn3500">15</xref></sup> but not into the count of the seven [days]. A mourner is regarded on a Festival as if he were no mourner, but in matters of a private nature he does observe mourning. The general rule is: as regards any [mourning rite] in the carrying out of which others are associated with him,<sup><xref rid="fn3501">16</xref></sup> a Festival is taken into account with the seven days,<sup><xref rid="fn3502">17</xref></sup> otherwise it is not taken into account with them.</p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>. Thirty are the days of mourning.<sup><xref rid="fn3503">18</xref></sup> For thirty days he may not put on pressed clothes<sup><xref rid="fn3504">19</xref></sup> or cut his hair. Thirty days are allowed for the collection of debts; thirty days must elapse before a captive woman of &#x2018;goodly form&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn3505">20</xref></sup> may be taken to wife; thirty days in the case of betrothal; thirty days in the case of marriage; thirty days within which a charge of lack of virginity can be made; thirty days are granted to a widow about to remarry to make her preparations; thirty days for a sister-in-law [after her levirate marriage to declare, &#x2018;He has not cohabited with me&#x2019;]. If a man forbade his wife by vow to have any benefit from him [the prohibition lasts] thirty days. The vow of a Nazirite of unspecified duration [remains in force] for thirty days.</p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>. Whence [thirty days] for mourning? As it is stated, <italic>And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3506">21</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 10</small>. How is it with pressed clothes? It is forbidden [for a mourner] to don pressed clothes, i.e. those that came from the press.<sup><xref rid="fn3507">22</xref></sup> This is the view of Rabbi [Judah the Prince]; the Sages said: [It refers] to dyed but not white garments. R. Meir said: White but not dyed, new but not worn garments. He may put on his money-belt,<sup><xref rid="fn3508">23</xref></sup> girdle,<sup><xref rid="fn3509">24</xref></sup> felt-shoes<sup><xref rid="fn3510">25</xref></sup> and turban.<sup><xref rid="fn3511">26</xref></sup> It is permitted to take garments to be pressed within thirty days.<sup><xref rid="fn3512">27</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 11</small>. How is it with cutting the hair? [A mourner] is forbidden to remove the hair whether of the head or of his [upper] lip, or of the beard or of the hair on any part of him. A woman is permitted to remove hair<sup><xref rid="fn3513">28</xref></sup> after the seven days.</p>
<p><small>RULE 12</small>. How is it with the collection of debts?<sup><xref rid="fn3514">29</xref></sup> If a person lends his friend money without specifying a date [for repayment], he may not demand it of him until thirty days are completed.</p>
<p><small>RULE 13</small>. How is it with a woman of &#x2018;goodly form&#x2019;? [It is stated,] <italic>And thou hast a desire unto her, and wouldest take her to thee to wife; then thou shalt bring her home to thy house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3515">30</xref></sup> [This means that] she shall shave her head and cut her nails, so the view of R. Eliezer;<sup><xref rid="fn3516">31</xref></sup> R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba [takes the meaning to be,] she lets the hair of her head grow long and lets her nails grow. R. Eliezer said: An act is mentioned in respect of the head<sup><xref rid="fn3517">32</xref></sup> and an act is mentioned in respect of her nails;<sup><xref rid="fn3518">33</xref></sup> as the former signifies removal of the hair so the latter signifies removal of the nails. R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: An act is mentioned in respect of the head and an act is mentioned in respect of the nails; as disfigurement is the purpose of the former so is disfigurement the purpose of the latter. There is a support for R. Eliezer [in the verse], <italic>And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3519">34</xref></sup> There is a support for R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba [in the verse], <italic>Till his hair was grown like eagles&#x2019; feathers, and his nails like birds&#x2019; claws</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3520">35</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3521">36</xref></sup> If she wore white garments and they were comely for her, black garments and they were comely for her,<sup><xref rid="fn3522">37</xref></sup> bracelets, nose-rings or rings, they are taken away from her so that she should sit and appear in her disfigurement. <italic>And she shall remain in thy house:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3523">38</xref></sup> so that while she remains in his house he enters and sees her in her disfigurement. <italic>And bewail her father and her mother:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3524">39</xref></sup> this means her actual father and mother, in the view of R. Eliezer; but R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba explains that <italic>her father and her mother</italic> refers to the idols [which she worshipped], as it is stated, <italic>Who say to a stock: &#x2018;Thou art my father&#x2019;, and to a stone: &#x2018;Thou hast brought us forth&#x2019;</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3525">40</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>A month of days</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3526">41</xref></sup>&#x2014;i.e. thirty days. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: [It means] three months, as it is stated, <italic>And bewail her father and her mother a month</italic>, i.e. one month, <italic>of days</italic> signifies [with the former] two months, <italic>and after that</italic> [is added in the text] to include the third month, [the purpose being] that the holy seed shall not be mingled with that of other peoples. When does this apply? Only if she does not wish to become a proselyte; but if she is willing to become a proselyte, he has her immersed [in the ritual bath] and emancipates her, and is permitted to marry her forthwith. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: Even if she is not willing<sup><xref rid="fn3527">42</xref></sup> at first, he has her immersed as a handmaid, emancipates her and may marry her forthwith. Why all this [procedure]? In order that the holy seed should not be mingled with that of other peoples.<sup><xref rid="fn3528">43</xref></sup> It is better for Israelites to eat the flesh of animals about to die, yet ritually slaughtered, than the flesh of dying animals which definitely perished.<sup><xref rid="fn3529">44</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 14</small>. How is it with betrothal? It is forbidden to hold a betrothal feast within the thirty days [of mourning].<sup><xref rid="fn3530">45</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 15</small>. How is it with marriage? It is forbidden to hold a marriage feast within the thirty days [of mourning], but if his meat is prepared<sup><xref rid="fn3531">46</xref></sup> and his father or mother-in-law<sup><xref rid="fn3532">47</xref></sup> died, he brings the bride into the bridal chamber, performs the act of consummation and then separates himself from her [until] after the seven days.<sup><xref rid="fn3533">48</xref></sup> When does this apply? Only if his father or mother-in-law died; but if his wife died, he is forbidden to remarry until three Festivals have gone by. R. Judah said: Until two Festivals have gone by, and he brings [her into the marital chamber] on the third. When does this apply? Only if he has children, but if he has no children or his children are young, it is permitted for him to remarry within thirty days.<sup><xref rid="fn3534">49</xref></sup> It happened that R. &#x1E6C;arfon&#x2019;s wife died, and he said to her sister within the days of mourning, &#x2018;Be my wife and bring up your sister&#x2019;s children&#x2019;. Nevertheless he did not cohabit with her until after the thirty days.</p>
<p><small>RULE 16</small>. How is it with virginity? Within thirty days he may make a plea of the absence of virginity,<sup><xref rid="fn3535">50</xref></sup> but after thirty days he cannot.</p>
<p><small>RULE 17</small>. How is it with a widow?<sup><xref rid="fn3536">51</xref></sup> If the man [to whom she is betrothed] claims her [in marriage] and she holds back, we allow her thirty days to make provision for herself; and as we allow [that period] to the woman, so too we allow it to the man.<sup><xref rid="fn3537">52</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 18</small>. How is it with a sister-in-law?<sup><xref rid="fn3538">53</xref></sup> If a sister-in-law declared within thirty days [after the levirate marriage], &#x2018;I have had no cohabitation&#x2019;,<sup><xref rid="fn3539">54</xref></sup> [the levir] is compelled to give her <italic>&#x1E25;ali&#x1E93;ah</italic>, but [if her declaration was made] after thirty days, he is not compelled<sup><xref rid="fn3540">55</xref></sup> to give her <italic>&#x1E25;ali&#x1E93;ah</italic>.</p>
<p><small>RULE 19</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3541">56</xref></sup> Should a man forbid his wife by vow to have any benefit from him, [if the prohibition is to last] not more than thirty days he must appoint a steward,<sup><xref rid="fn3542">57</xref></sup> but if for a longer period he must divorce her and give her [the amount stipulated in] her <italic>kethubah</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3543">58</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 20</small>. [How is it with a Nazirite whose vow is of unspecified duration?]<sup><xref rid="fn3544">59</xref></sup> The vow of a Nazirite which is of unspecified duration [remains in force] thirty days.<sup><xref rid="fn3545">60</xref></sup> Whether he declared, &#x2018;Behold I am a Nazirite&#x2019; without qualification, or he declared, &#x2018;Behold I am a Nazirite for one day&#x2019;, his status as a Nazirite lasts thirty days.<sup><xref rid="fn3546">61</xref></sup> If he completed his period as a Nazirite outside the land of Israel<sup><xref rid="fn3547">62</xref></sup> and later returned there, [47<italic>a</italic>] Beth Shammai said that he remains a Nazirite for thirty days, and Beth Hillel said that he [reverts to the] beginning of his status as a Nazirite.<sup><xref rid="fn3548">63</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 21</small>. One who resides in the land of Israel thirty days is under the obligation to affix a <italic>mezuzah</italic>, and he who rents a house must do so forthwith;<sup><xref rid="fn3549">64</xref></sup> but he who resides outside the land of Israel is exempt. One who rents a house for thirty days<sup><xref rid="fn3550">65</xref></sup> and one who resides in an isolated place<sup><xref rid="fn3551">66</xref></sup> for thirty days is under the obligation to affix a <italic>mezuzah</italic>.</p>
<p><small>RULE 22</small>. If one buys newly born cattle from his neighbour, [he may retain the dam] to suckle them, in the case of small cattle<sup><xref rid="fn3552">67</xref></sup> for thirty days and in the case of large cattle<sup><xref rid="fn3553">68</xref></sup> for fifty days. R. Jose said: In the case of small cattle for three months because they need much attention.<sup><xref rid="fn3554">69</xref></sup> As for attending to the first-born of cattle<sup><xref rid="fn3555">70</xref></sup> [before handing them over to the <italic>kohen</italic>], in the case of small cattle the period is thirty days and for large cattle fifty days. R. Jose said: In the case of small cattle the period is three months because they need much attention.</p>
<p><small>RULE 23</small>. Beth Shammai<sup><xref rid="fn3556">71</xref></sup> declared an old <italic>Sukkah</italic> to be invalid; Beth Hillel pronounced it valid (but he must add something new to it).<sup><xref rid="fn3557">72</xref></sup> What is &#x2018;an old <italic>Sukkah&#x2019;?</italic> One which was made thirty days before the Festival [of Tabernacles]; but should he have made it for the purpose of [being used on] the Festival, even [if erected] at the beginning of the year, it is valid.</p>
<p><small>RULE 24</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3558">73</xref></sup> Rice, millet, panic and sesame which took root before the New Year are tithed<sup><xref rid="fn3559">74</xref></sup> as belonging to the previous year<sup><xref rid="fn3560">75</xref></sup> and are permitted in the seventh year;<sup><xref rid="fn3561">76</xref></sup> but if they did not [take root before the New Year] they are forbidden in the seventh year and are tithed as belonging to the next year.<sup><xref rid="fn3562">77</xref></sup> R. Simeon of Shezur said: Egyptian beans sown from the outset for the purpose of seeds<sup><xref rid="fn3563">78</xref></sup> are treated in a like manner. R. Simeon said: Large beans are treated in a like manner if they formed pods<sup><xref rid="fn3564">79</xref></sup> before the New Year. Shallots<sup><xref rid="fn3565">80</xref></sup> and Egyptian beans which have not been watered within thirty days of the New Year are treated as if a year had passed<sup><xref rid="fn3566">81</xref></sup> and may be retained in the seventh year; otherwise they are not considered as such and may not be retained in the seventh year.</p>
<p><small>RULE 25</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3567">82</xref></sup> If one plants, bends over<sup><xref rid="fn3568">83</xref></sup> or grafts a tree within thirty days of the New Year, a year has passed for him [by the New Year]<sup><xref rid="fn3569">84</xref></sup> and he may preserve the growth during the seventh year; otherwise a year has not passed for him and he may not preserve the growth in the seventh year. R. Judah said: Any grafting which does not take root within three days will never do so. R. Simeon and R. Jose said: Any grafting which does not take root within two weeks is no grafting. The fruit of such a planting is forbidden until the fifteenth of <italic>Sheba&#x1E6D;</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3570">85</xref></sup></p>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER VIII</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. We go out to the cemetery and examine<sup><xref rid="fn3571">1</xref></sup> the dead within three days and do not fear [being suspected of] superstitious practices.<sup><xref rid="fn3572">2</xref></sup> It once happened that [a man who was buried] was examined [and found to be living], and he lived for twenty-five years and then died. Another<sup><xref rid="fn3573">3</xref></sup> [so examined lived and] begat five children before he died.</p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. We erect a canopy<sup><xref rid="fn3574">4</xref></sup> for bridegrooms and brides [who died before marriage] and suspend from it articles which have and have not reached the edible stage; this is the opinion of R. Meir. R. Judah<sup><xref rid="fn3575">5</xref></sup> said: We only suspend from it articles which have not reached the edible stage.<sup><xref rid="fn3576">6</xref></sup> These are what are suspended from it: Nuts which have not reached the edible stage,<sup><xref rid="fn3577">7</xref></sup> loaves of bread which are not edible,<sup><xref rid="fn3578">8</xref></sup> strips of purple wool, flasks of perfumed oil. And these are the articles which may not be suspended from it: Nuts which have reached the edible stage, pomegranates which have reached the edible stage, loaves of bread which are edible, and flasks of sweet oil. The general rule is: no benefit may be derived from anything that is suspended from the canopy.</p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. We scatter before bridegrooms and brides strings of fish<sup><xref rid="fn3579">9</xref></sup> and pieces of meat in summer but not in winter; but not pieces of cooked fish, mushrooms, truffles or sesame both in summer and winter; but one takes roasted ears of corn and nuts and throws them. The general rule is: we may not scatter before them anything that is perishable.</p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. We may let wine and oil flow through pipes<sup><xref rid="fn3580">10</xref></sup> before bridegrooms and brides and we do not fear [being suspected of] superstitious practices; nor do we fear of sinning by putting food to shame.<sup><xref rid="fn3581">11</xref></sup> It is related that Judah and Hillel, the sons of Rabban Gamaliel, came to Ben Zakkai at Kabul<sup><xref rid="fn3582">12</xref></sup> and the citizens let wine and oil flow through pipes [in their honour].</p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. We may burn [articles]<sup><xref rid="fn3583">13</xref></sup> at the funerals of kings and mutilate [their animals], and we do not fear [being suspected of] superstitious practices. Any mutilation which disqualifies the animal as food makes it forbidden to be eaten, but benefit may be derived from it; and when the mutilation does not disqualify the animal it may be eaten and obviously benefit may be derived from it. Which mutilation disqualifies it? From the knee downwards.<sup><xref rid="fn3584">14</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. We may burn articles at the funeral of kings but not at the funeral of princes.<sup><xref rid="fn3585">15</xref></sup> When Rabban Gamaliel the Elder died, the proselyte On&#x1E33;elos burnt after him more than eighty Tyrian <italic>minas</italic>. They asked him, &#x2018;What was your purpose in doing this?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;It is written, <italic>Thou</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3586">16</xref></sup> <italic>shalt die in peace; and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings that were before thee, so shall they make a burning for thee</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3587">17</xref></sup> And is not Rabban Gamaliel worth more than a hundred useless kings?&#x2019;</p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>. We cover the hair of [dead] brides, uncover the face of [dead] bridegrooms,<sup><xref rid="fn3588">18</xref></sup> and place ink and pen at their side,<sup><xref rid="fn3589">19</xref></sup> and we do not fear [being suspected of] superstitious practices.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn3590">20</xref></sup>(When Rabban Gamaliel the Elder entered [the meeting place of the Rabbis to intercalate the year], he found eight [present]. He asked, &#x2018;Who is it that entered without permission?&#x2019; Samuel the Small arose and said, &#x2018;Rabbi, I entered only to inquire about the law [of intercalation]&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn3591">21</xref></sup> He answered, &#x2018;O Eldad and Medad,<sup><xref rid="fn3592">22</xref></sup> all Israel know that if I had ordered that only two should enter, you would have been one [of them] to enter&#x2019;.)<sup><xref rid="fn3593">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>We suspend the key and writing-tablet of a dead man from his coffin from grief of soul. When Samuel the Small died, they suspended his key and writing-tablet from his coffin because he had no son, and when Rabban Gamaliel the Elder and R. Eleazar delivered their funeral orations over him, they exclaimed, &#x2018;For this one it is fitting to weep, for this one it is fitting to mourn. When kings die they leave their crowns to their sons; when wealthy men die they leave their riches to their children; but Samuel the Small has taken away with him all the desirable things in the world and has departed&#x2019;. And thus he<sup><xref rid="fn3594">24</xref></sup> spoke at the time of his death, &#x2018;Simeon [b. Gamaliel] and Ishmael [the son of Elisha the High Priest]<sup><xref rid="fn3595">25</xref></sup> are destined for the sword and the rest of the people for spoliation; great distress will befall [Israel] after them&#x2019;. He uttered these words in Aramaic.</p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3596">26</xref></sup> When R. Simeon b. Gamaliel and R. Ishmael came [to be tried], it was decreed against them that they should be put to death. Whereupon R. Ishmael broke into tears; and R. Simeon said to him, &#x2018;<italic>Abrek</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3597">27</xref></sup> why do you weep? Two steps more<sup><xref rid="fn3598">28</xref></sup> and you will be in the bosom of the righteous, and yet you weep&#x0021;&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;Do I then weep because we are about to be executed? It is because we are about to be executed [in the same way] as murderers and desecrators of the Sabbath&#x2019;. He said to him, &#x2018;Perhaps you were having a meal or you were sleeping when a woman came to ask [a ruling] concerning her ritual impurity or her cleanness, and your servant told her that you were asleep. And the Torah states, <italic>Ye shall not aflict</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3599">29</xref></sup> <italic>any widow or fatherless child. If thou afflict them in any wise</italic>&#x2014;<italic>for if they cry at all unto Me, I will surely hear their cry</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3600">30</xref></sup> And what is written after this? <italic>My wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword</italic>&#x2019;. Some say that it was [47<italic>b</italic>] R. Simeon b. Gamaliel who was weeping and R. Ishmael who answered him in these words.</p>
<p>When R. Simeon and R. Ishmael were executed and the report reached R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba and R. Judah b. Baba, they arose, girded their loins with sackcloth, rent their garments and exclaimed, &#x2018;Our brother-Israelites, if good were destined to come to the world, at first none would receive it but R. Simeon and R. Ishmael; but now that it is revealed before Him Who spake and the universe came into being that eventually great punishments will come upon the world, they have consequently been taken out of the world; [as it is stated,] <italic>The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3601">31</xref></sup> and it continues, <italic>He entereth into peace, they rest in their beds</italic>&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn3602">32</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>. When R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba was executed in Caesarea and the news reached R. Judah b. Baba and R. &#x1E24;anina b. Teradion, they arose, girded themselves in sackcloth, rent their garments and exclaimed, &#x2018;Our brethren, hearken unto us&#x0021; R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba was not executed for robbery or because he did not labour in the Torah with all his strength. He has only been put to death as a sign,<sup><xref rid="fn3603">33</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>Thus shall Ezekiel be unto you a sign; according to all that he hath done shall ye do; when this cometh, then shall ye know that I am the Lord God</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3604">34</xref></sup> Within a short while there will be no place found in the land of Israel where no [slain] will be cast forth, as it is stated, <italic>Speak: Thus saith the Lord</italic>&#x2014;<italic>And the carcasses of men fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman, which none gathereth&#x2019;</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3605">35</xref></sup> It is reported that it was not long before war came and disturbed the world, and within twelve months the municipalities<sup><xref rid="fn3606">36</xref></sup> in Judea ceased; as it is stated, <italic>Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye confident ones:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3607">37</xref></sup> <italic>Ye women that are at ease</italic> refers to the municipalities in Judea, <italic>ye confident ones</italic> refers to the fortified towns.<sup><xref rid="fn3608">38</xref></sup> <italic>Confident ones</italic> is nothing else than a term for walled cities.<sup><xref rid="fn3609">39</xref></sup> It is reported that twelve months had not passed before what had been said was fulfilled.</p>
<p><small>RULE 10</small>. R. Meir illustrated it by a parable. To what is the matter like? To a king who prepared a banquet and invited guests without fixing a time when they should leave. The shrewd among them left at the ninth hour,<sup><xref rid="fn3610">40</xref></sup> returned home and went to bed while it was still light; others left at sunset while the shops were still open and the lamps burning, entered their homes and went to bed by the light of the lamps; still others left at two or three hours in the night when some shops were open and some shut, some with their lamps alight and some with their lamps extinguished, entered their homes and went to bed in the dark. Those remaining at the banquet became intoxicated, and wounded and killed each other; as it is stated, <italic>I saw the Lord standing beside the altar; and He said: Smite the capitals, that the posts may shake; and break them in pieces on the head of all of them; and I will slay the residue of them with the sword</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3611">41</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 11</small>. When R. &#x1E24;anina b. Teradion was arrested<sup><xref rid="fn3612">42</xref></sup> on the charge of heresy,<sup><xref rid="fn3613">43</xref></sup> [the Romans] sentenced him to be burnt, his wife to be executed and his daughter to be consigned to a brothel. He asked, &#x2018;What have they decreed against that poor woman?&#x2019; They replied, &#x2018;She is to be executed&#x2019;. Thereupon he recited of her the verse, <italic>The Lord is righteous in all his ways</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3614">44</xref></sup> She asked, &#x2018;What have they decreed against the Rabbi?&#x2019; They replied, &#x2018;He is to be burnt&#x2019;. Thereupon she recited of him the verse, <italic>Great in counsel, and mighty in work</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3615">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>When they burnt him, they wrapped him in a scroll of the Torah and burnt him. His daughter wept, wailed and threw herself before him. Whereupon he exclaimed, &#x2018;My daughter, if for me you weep, if for me you throw yourself down, it were better that a fire which [a man] has fanned should consume me and not one which [a man] has not fanned;<sup><xref rid="fn3616">46</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>A fire not blown by man shall consume him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3617">47</xref></sup> If, however, you threw yourself down because of the scroll of the Torah, behold, the letters are flying upwards and only parchment is being consumed. For even great servants of the king are punished by inferior servants, [as it is stated,] <italic>Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets, I have slain them by the words of My mouth&#x2019;</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3618">48</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 12</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3619">49</xref></sup> R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: A king had four sons. One was silent when punished, another protested when punished, another begged for mercy when punished, and another when punished said to his father, &#x2018;Go on punishing me&#x2019;. Abraham remained silent when punished, as it is stated, <italic>Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, even Isaac &#x2026; and offer him there for a burnt-offering</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3620">50</xref></sup> He could have argued, &#x2018;Yesterday You said to me, <italic>For in Isaac shall seed be called to thee&#x0021;</italic>&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn3621">51</xref></sup> Then it is stated, <italic>And Abraham rose early in the morning</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3622">52</xref></sup> Job protested when punished, as it is stated, <italic>I will say unto God: Do not condemn me; make me know wherefore Thou contendest with me</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3623">53</xref></sup> Hezekiah besought God for mercy when punished, as it is stated, <italic>Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the Lord, saying</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3624">54</xref></sup> etc. Some say that Hezekiah protested when he was punished since he later added, <italic>And have done that which is good in Thy sight</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3625">55</xref></sup> David [when punished] said to his Father, &#x2018;Continue to punish me&#x2019;, as it is stated, <italic>Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3626">56</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 13</small>. We do not interrupt the study of the Torah until the soul departs from the dying man.<sup><xref rid="fn3627">57</xref></sup> When R. Simeon, the son of R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba, fell ill, the latter did not interrupt his expositions in the Academy but made inquiries after him through a messenger. The first messenger came and reported, &#x2018;He is very ill&#x2019;. He said to [his disciples], &#x2018;Continue to ask questions&#x2019;. Then a second came and reported, &#x2018;He has grown worse&#x2019;. R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba resumed the study of the Torah. A third came and reported, &#x2018;He is dying&#x2019;, and he said [to his disciples, &#x2018;Continue] to ask questions&#x2019;. A fourth came and reported, &#x2018;He is dead&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn3628">58</xref></sup> Whereupon he arose, removed the <italic>tefillin</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3629">59</xref></sup> rent his garments and said to them, &#x2018;Our brother-Israelites, hearken&#x0021; Until now we had the duty to study the Torah; but from now onward we have the duty to occupy ourselves with honouring the dead&#x2019;.</p>
<p>A large assembly gathered to bury R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba&#x2019;s son, and he said to them, &#x2018;Bring a bench<sup><xref rid="fn3630">60</xref></sup> for me to the cemetery&#x2019;. He stood<sup><xref rid="fn3631">61</xref></sup> upon it and expounded, &#x2018;Our brother-Israelites, hearken&#x0021; Not because I am a scholar [have you come here], there being greater scholars here than I; not because I am a rich man [have you come here], there being richer men here than I; the men of the Darom<sup><xref rid="fn3632">62</xref></sup> know R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba, but how should the men of Galilee know him?<sup><xref rid="fn3633">63</xref></sup> Men know him, but how should women and young children? I know, however, that your reward is great because you have only taken the great trouble to come here for the honour of the Torah and for the sake of the commandment [to attend the dead to the grave]. I should be comforted though I had seven sons whom I [now] buried. Not that a man desires to bury his children, but I know that my son is destined for the World to Come because he caused the many to be righteous, and<sup><xref rid="fn3634">64</xref></sup> whoever causes the many to be righteous, sin occurs not through him, and whoever causes the many to sin, they do not afford him the faculty to repent. Moses was righteous and caused the many to be righteous, [therefore] the righteousness of the many was [considered] dependent on him, as it is stated, <italic>He executed the righteousness of the Lord, and His ordinances with Israel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3635">65</xref></sup> Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, sinned and caused others to sin, [therefore] the sin of the many was [considered] dependent on him, as it is stated, <italic>For the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and wherewith he made Israel to sin&#x2019;</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3636">66</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 14</small>. Further [R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba] sat on the bench [and taught]: Good things are brought about through the agency of good men.<sup><xref rid="fn3637">67</xref></sup> Even if Moses and Aaron had not arisen, Israel would still have been worthy to be redeemed from Egypt,<sup><xref rid="fn3638">68</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>And afterward shall they come out with great substance</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3639">69</xref></sup> Had not Moses and Aaron and the Generation of the Wilderness arisen, Israel would still have been worthy to receive the Torah, as it is stated, <italic>He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3640">70</xref></sup> The section of &#x2018;the judges&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn3641">71</xref></sup> would have been worthy to be promulgated even if Jethro had not arisen. The section of &#x2018;the smaller Passover&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn3642">72</xref></sup> would have been worthy to be promulgated even if the &#x2018;unclean&#x2019; had not arisen, as it is stated, <italic>We are unclean by the dead body of a man; wherefore are we to be kept back, so as not to bring the offering of the Lord in its appointed season among the children of Israel?</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3643">73</xref></sup> The section of &#x2018;inheritance&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn3644">74</xref></sup> would have been worthy to be promulgated even if the daughters of Zelophehad<sup><xref rid="fn3645">75</xref></sup> had not arisen. The Temple would have been worthy to be built even if David and Solomon had not arisen, as it is stated, <italic>The sanctuary, O Lord, which Thy hands have established</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3646">76</xref></sup> Israel would have been worthy to be redeemed in the days of Haman even it Mordecai and Esther had not arisen, as it is stated, <italic>And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3647">77</xref></sup> etc.</p>
<p>Israel were destined to be enslaved even if Pharaoh had not arisen in Egypt, as it is stated, <italic>And</italic> [they] <italic>shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3648">78</xref></sup> Israel were destined to serve idols even if Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, had not arisen, as it is stated, <italic>And this people will rise up, and go astray after the foreign gods of the land</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3649">79</xref></sup> The section of &#x2018;the blasphemer&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn3650">80</xref></sup> and of &#x2018;the gatherer of sticks&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn3651">81</xref></sup> would have been worthy to be promulgated even if the son of the Israelitish woman and the gatherer of sticks had not arisen. Israel would have been destined to be destroyed by the sword even if so and so<sup><xref rid="fn3652">82</xref></sup> had not arisen, as it is stated, <italic>All the sinners of My people shall die by the sword;</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3653">83</xref></sup> and it declares, <italic>By sword and famine shall they be consumed</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3654">84</xref></sup> Israel would have deserved to be destroyed even if Nebuchadnezzar and his companions had not arisen, as it is stated, <italic>Therefore shall Zion for your sake be ploughed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3655">85</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 15</small>. And further [he expounded]: Reward is brought about through persons of merit and punishment through persons of guilt. <sup><xref rid="fn3656">86</xref></sup>When Trajan was about to execute Pappus and his brother Lulianus in Laodicea, he said to them, &#x2018;If you are of the people of Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, let your God come and deliver you from my hands, in the same way as He delivered Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah [from Nebuchadnezzar]&#x2019;. They replied, &#x2018;Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah were worthy men and Nebuchadnezzar was a worthy king, and it was fitting that a miracle should be wrought through their agency; but you are a wicked king and are not worthy that a miracle should be wrought through your agency. As for us, we deserve death at the hand of God, and if you do not slay us, the Omnipresent has many other agents of death; He has many demons, many bears, many leopards, many snakes, many venomous serpents, many scorpions which will come and attack us; but when we die you will learn that we are the descendants of Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah&#x2019;. It is reported that before they died they witnessed his eyes gouged out.<sup><xref rid="fn3657">87</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 16</small>. The allegorical interpreters<sup><xref rid="fn3658">88</xref></sup> of Scripture said: <italic>And ye shall break down their altars:</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3659">89</xref></sup> wherein have the trees and the stones sinned?<sup><xref rid="fn3660">90</xref></sup> Because they were a stumbling-block to man Scripture decreed, <italic>And ye shall break down</italic>. This is an argument from minor to major: if with trees and stones, which are capable neither of merit nor guilt, neither of good nor evil, because they were a stumbling-block to man the Torah declared, <italic>And ye shall break down</italic>, how much more [will a man be punished] who causes his neighbour to sin and turns him away from the way of life to the path of death&#x0021; Similarly, <italic>And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3661">91</xref></sup> If a human being sinned, how has the animal offended?<sup><xref rid="fn3662">92</xref></sup> Because evil came to a human being through it, and so that the animal shall not pass through the street and people say, &#x2018;This is the animal on account of which So-and-so was stoned&#x2019;. This is an argument from minor to major: if with an animal, which is capable neither of merit nor guilt, neither of good nor evil, because it was a stumbling-block to a human being the Torah declared, <italic>It shall be stoned</italic>, how much more [will a man be punished] who causes his neighbour to sin and turns him from the way of life to the path of death&#x0021;</p>
<p>Similarly Scripture declares of the stones of the altar, <italic>Thou shalt lift up no iron tool upon them</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3663">93</xref></sup> and elsewhere it states, <italic>For if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast profaned it</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3664">94</xref></sup> Wherein is iron different from all other metals to be unfit for [the building of] the altar? Because the sword is a symbol of curse and the altar an agent of atonement; so we remove the symbol of curse on account of the agent of atonement. This is an argument from minor to major: if with the stones of the altar which do not see and speak, eat or drink, because they make peace between Israel and their Father in heaven the Torah declared, <italic>Thou shalt lift no iron tool upon them</italic>, the children of the Torah,<sup><xref rid="fn3665">95</xref></sup> who are an atonement for the world, how much more [should they not lift an iron tool against each other&#x0021;] Similarly Scripture declares, <italic>Thou shalt build the altar of the Lord thy God of unhewn stones</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3666">96</xref></sup>&#x2014;stones that bring peace to the world. This is an argument from minor to major: if with stones which do not see or hear, speak or eat or drink, because they make peace between Israel and their Father in heaven they must be &#x2018;whole&#x2019; [48<italic>a</italic>] before [the Holy One, blessed be He], how much more the children of the Torah, who are an atonement for the world, must be &#x2018;whole&#x2019; before the Holy One, blessed be He&#x0021;</p>

<title>CHAPTER IX</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. One does not rend [his garments] for the dead<sup><xref rid="fn3667">1</xref></sup> except for his teacher who taught him wisdom.<sup><xref rid="fn3668">2</xref></sup> R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: When a Sage dies, all present at his death rend [their garments] for him, but all those who are not present do not rend them.</p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. For a Sage who died<sup><xref rid="fn3669">3</xref></sup> one bares the right [shoulder]; for an <italic>&#x2019;Ab Beth Din</italic> who died one bares the left [shoulder]; for a <italic>Nasi&#x2019;</italic> who died one bares both shoulders.<sup><xref rid="fn3670">4</xref></sup> It is related<sup><xref rid="fn3671">5</xref></sup> that when R. Eliezer died, R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba bared both shoulders and kept on beating his heart<sup><xref rid="fn3672">6</xref></sup> until the blood flowed, and he cried out, <italic>&#x2018;My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof&#x0021;</italic>&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn3673">7</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3674">8</xref></sup> One does not bare [the shoulder] for the dead in general but only for his father and mother; and if they are not worthy,<sup><xref rid="fn3675">9</xref></sup> he does not rend even for his father and mother. It is related that when R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba&#x2019;s father died, those present bared [the shoulder], but he did not.</p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. For the dead in general one rends [the garments] with a knife,<sup><xref rid="fn3676">10</xref></sup> but for his father and mother he does not rend with a knife.<sup><xref rid="fn3677">11</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. For the dead in general one does not bare his chest, but for his father and mother he bares it.<sup><xref rid="fn3678">12</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. For the dead in general one does not divide<sup><xref rid="fn3679">13</xref></sup> the [upper] selvage-border [of his garment],<sup><xref rid="fn3680">14</xref></sup> but for his father and mother he does divide it. R. Judah said: Any rending [of a garment] which does not divide the selvage-border is mere make-believe. R. Judah said:<sup><xref rid="fn3681">15</xref></sup> Any initial rending must be [to the extent of] three fingers, while the extension may be as small as he cares.<sup><xref rid="fn3682">16</xref></sup> One only rends as far down as the region of the navel.<sup><xref rid="fn3683">17</xref></sup> In the case of children, others rend for them.<sup><xref rid="fn3684">18</xref></sup> One who rends [not as a relative but] from respect [for the dead] may stitch [the edges] forthwith. The rending of one&#x2019;s undershirt is not indispensable.<sup><xref rid="fn3685">19</xref></sup> R. Benjamin said in the name of R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba: One must rend the undershirt.</p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3686">20</xref></sup> For the dead in general one rends only the uppermost [garment], but for his father and mother he must rend [all] even though he be wearing a hundred. A woman only rends her uppermost [garment]. R. Judah said: A woman rends her undergarment, turns it front to back, and then rends the remaining [garments].<sup><xref rid="fn3687">21</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>. For the dead generally one tacks<sup><xref rid="fn3688">22</xref></sup> the rent together after seven days, and [completely] restitches [the edges] after thirty; but for one&#x2019;s father and mother one never restitches [the edges]. A woman tacks the rent together after seven [days] and restitches [the edges] after thirty. R. Judah said: A woman tacks the rent together immediately<sup><xref rid="fn3689">23</xref></sup> and restitches [the edges] after seven [days].<sup><xref rid="fn3690">24</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3691">25</xref></sup> For the dead generally one expedites<sup><xref rid="fn3692">26</xref></sup> the bier and does not occupy himself unduly with their affairs;<sup><xref rid="fn3693">27</xref></sup> but in the case of his father and mother, whoever greatly occupies himself with their affairs and does not expedite the bier is praiseworthy. But if time is pressing, or the Sabbath-eve is approaching, or rain falls, he may expedite the bier for his father and mother and does not unduly occupy himself with their affairs.</p>
<p><small>RULE 10</small>. For the dead in general it is forbidden to wear pressed clothes until thirty days [are completed], but in the case of his father and mother it is forbidden until the [next] Festival occurs and then only if his companions rebuke him.<sup><xref rid="fn3694">28</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 11</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3695">29</xref></sup> For the dead generally it is forbidden to trim one&#x2019;s hair until thirty days are completed; but in the case of his father and mother, one lets the hair grow long until his companions rebuke him.</p>
<p><small>RULE 12</small>. For the dead generally one is forbidden to engage in trade<sup><xref rid="fn3696">30</xref></sup> until thirty days are completed; but for one&#x2019;s father and mother until his companions rebuke him and say to him, &#x2018;Come out with us&#x2019;.</p>
<p><small>RULE 13</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3697">31</xref></sup> For the dead generally it is forbidden to go to a house of feasting until thirty days are completed; but for one&#x2019;s father and mother, all the twelve months unless it is for a sacred cause.<sup><xref rid="fn3698">32</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 14</small>. If news reached him that his father died and he rent, but [in fact] it was his mother, he has done his duty.<sup><xref rid="fn3699">33</xref></sup> [If news reached him that] his mother died, but it was his father and he rent, he has done his duty. [If news reached him that] his father died and he rent, but it was one of his near relatives, he has done his duty. [If news reached him that] one of his near relatives died, but it was his father, he has not done his duty.<sup><xref rid="fn3700">34</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 15</small>. If one&#x2019;s father and mother died [at the same time], he makes only one rent for the two of them.<sup><xref rid="fn3701">35</xref></sup> R. Judah b. Tema said: He rends for each separately. If one&#x2019;s ten children died at the same time, he makes one rent for all of them.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn3702">36</xref></sup>If after he had made a rent [for another] news reached him that his son died, he continues to rend until it [reaches down] to the navel; when it has reached the navel he turns [the garment] front to back.</p>
<p>If his son died and he rent [and news of another death reached him], he leaves a space of three fingers and again rends.</p>
<p><small>RULE 16</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3703">37</xref></sup> The rent must be made only between the two borders;<sup><xref rid="fn3704">38</xref></sup> one who makes the rent along the border or at the side has not done his duty.<sup><xref rid="fn3705">39</xref></sup> R. Judah said: He has done his duty. R. Judah said: It happened in the days of &#x1E24;arsum<sup><xref rid="fn3706">40</xref></sup> that people used to make the rent at the lower end [of the garment] and at the side. His colleagues retorted, &#x2018;No proof may be adduced [from a practice adopted] in a time of danger&#x2019;.</p>
<p>A man dressed in torn garments does not rend.<sup><xref rid="fn3707">41</xref></sup> R. Judah said: One who rends a cloak of <italic>Birrus</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3708">42</xref></sup> a Brundisian cloak,<sup><xref rid="fn3709">43</xref></sup> a <italic>Poenula</italic>,<sup><xref rid="fn3710">44</xref></sup> a stitched garment or a veil,<sup><xref rid="fn3711">45</xref></sup> has not done his duty.<sup><xref rid="fn3712">46</xref></sup> One who rends a basted garment<sup><xref rid="fn3713">47</xref></sup> has done his duty. What constitutes a basted garment? [When its tear] has been completely basted.</p>
<p><small>RULE 17</small>. These are the rents which may not be basted: [When it was done] for his father or mother, for his teacher who instructed him in wisdom, for a scroll of the Torah which has been burnt, for the ruined Temple, for evil tidings, [on hearing] the Divine Name blasphemed, on seeing Jerusalem from Mount Scopus,<sup><xref rid="fn3714">48</xref></sup> and [on the death of] a <italic>Nasi</italic>&#x2019;. Some add: [On the death of] a High Priest, a prophet, or an <italic>&#x2019;Ab Beth Din</italic>. As regards the burning of a scroll of the Torah, [the garment is rent] not on hearing of this happening but only when he stands by while it burns. As for the ruined Temple, [he rends his garment] even if he heard that it has been destroyed; similarly with evil tidings because they are as grievous as the destruction of the Temple.</p>
<p>One who sees Jerusalem from Mount Scopus must rend; when he enters [the city] he extends the rent, and if he goes up [again to Jerusalem] he must extend it further. &#x2018;If he goes up again&#x2019;&#x2014;this is to teach that he is obliged to make a rent every time he goes up [to Jerusalem] during each period [of thirty days].<sup><xref rid="fn3715">49</xref></sup> If he came up [to Jerusalem] and settled there, he rends once and has thereby done his duty.</p>
<p><small>RULE 18</small>. One who buys a tunic which has been rent [by a mourner] from<sup><xref rid="fn3716">50</xref></sup> his companion may not baste it unless he knows that the rent is of the kind which may be basted. One who sells a tunic which has been rent [by a mourner] to his companion must inform him whether the rent is of the kind which may be basted or not.<sup><xref rid="fn3717">51</xref></sup> All rent [garments] which may not be basted must not be sold to non-Jews<sup><xref rid="fn3718">52</xref></sup> or stitched together or be reversed from top to bottom, according to the view of R. Simeon; but R. Eliezer permits it to be done. <sup><xref rid="fn3719">53</xref></sup>One who borrows a tunic from his companion to go and visit his father and when he arrives finds that his father died, he rends it, bastes it and returns it to his companion. If, however, he borrowed it without specifying for what purpose he needed it, he is not permitted<sup><xref rid="fn3720">54</xref></sup> to rend it.</p>
<p><small>RULE 19</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3721">55</xref></sup> One who goes out before the bier of the dead with a garment already rent robs the dead [of his due]. More grievous is the robbing of the dead than robbing the living, because one who robs the living can appease him by making restitution, but one who robs the dead cannot appease him by making restitution.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn3722">56</xref></sup>Likewise you may say: One who honours his father and mother after their death<sup><xref rid="fn3723">57</xref></sup> is as if he honoured them in their lifetime, since one who honours them while they are alive may do so from fear or for the sake of an inheritance; but he who honours them after their death does so in the name of Heaven only.<sup><xref rid="fn3724">58</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 20</small>. He who made a rent for one [presumed] dead and he revived, if he dies immediately afterwards [the man who made a rent] has fulfilled his duty, but if [death occurred] after some time he has not done his duty.<sup><xref rid="fn3725">59</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 21</small>. Whosoever rescues garments from the dead<sup><xref rid="fn3726">60</xref></sup> robs the dead. There are times when a man may rescue them and times when he may not. [48<italic>b</italic>] If the garments have not touched the bier he may rescue them, but if they have touched the bier he may not. We, however, instruct people not to seize them.<sup><xref rid="fn3727">61</xref></sup> And whoever piles up garments on the dead commits a transgression because of the law which forbids wilful destruction,<sup><xref rid="fn3728">62</xref></sup> according to the view of R. Meir. R. Eliezer b. &#x1E92;ado&#x1E33; said: It disgraces him. Rabban Gamaliel said: He causes maggots to breed upon [the dead]. R. Nathan said: The garment which goes down with him to the grave will come back with him in the time to come,<sup><xref rid="fn3729">63</xref></sup> as it is stated, <italic>It is changed as clay under the seal; and they stand as a garment</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3730">64</xref></sup></p>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER X</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. A mourner, as long as his dead is lying before him,<sup><xref rid="fn3731">1</xref></sup> is exempt from reading the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic> and <italic>Tefillah</italic> and from all the commandments prescribed in the Torah. Even if he desires to place himself under greater restrictions [than the law requires] he should not do so out of respect for the dead.</p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3732">2</xref></sup> When the time comes for reading the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic>, all the people [present] read it but he remains silent; when they stand to read the <italic>Tefillah</italic>, all read it but he justifies for himself the divine decree. What does he say? &#x2018;Sovereign of all the universe, I have sinned before Thee; I have repaid but few of my obligations; I merit much more punishment than this; may it be Thy will to repair our breaches and to comfort us&#x2019;. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: He also prays for all the needs of the dead person.</p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3733">3</xref></sup> A mourner eats [his meal] in the house of his neighbour, and if he has no neighbour he eats it in another room; and if he has no other room [than that in which the dead is lying], he puts up a partition and eats; and if he is not able to put up a partition, he turns his face away from the dead and eats. But he must not eat in a reclining posture,<sup><xref rid="fn3734">4</xref></sup> eat as much food as he needs, eat meat or drink wine. He is not included in the <italic>Zimmun</italic>, others do not say Grace on his behalf, and we do not request him, &#x2018;Say Grace&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn3735">5</xref></sup> When does this apply? On week-days, but on the Sabbath<sup><xref rid="fn3736">6</xref></sup> he eats as much as he needs, he may eat meat and drink wine, and is included in the <italic>Zimmun</italic>. Rabban Gamaliel said: A mourner [is regarded] on the Sabbath as if he were not a mourner.</p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. We do not remove the body [for burial] near [the time of] reading the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic>, unless it is an hour before.<sup><xref rid="fn3737">7</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3738">8</xref></sup> Once the bearers of the bier have carried [the body] out&#x2014;such as are before the bier<sup><xref rid="fn3739">9</xref></sup> and such as are behind it<sup><xref rid="fn3740">10</xref></sup>&#x2014;those who are before the bier, whose services are still needed, are exempt from reading the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic> and are forbidden<sup><xref rid="fn3741">11</xref></sup> to wear shoes. All alike are exempt from the <italic>Tefillah</italic> and from putting on the <italic>tefillin</italic>.</p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3742">12</xref></sup> Having buried the dead and returned [from the graveside], if they are able to begin and complete [the reading of the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic>] before arriving at the row,<sup><xref rid="fn3743">13</xref></sup> they read<sup><xref rid="fn3744">14</xref></sup> it and afterwards stand in the row; but if not, they stand in the row and afterwards read [the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic>] and the <italic>Tefillah</italic>.</p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3745">15</xref></sup> The inner row [of the comforters] who can see the mourners is exempt [from reading the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic>], but the outer row is under the obligation. R. Judah said: Even if there be [only] one row, those who stand for the sake of [comforting] the mourner are exempt, but those who stand for the sake of [their own] honour<sup><xref rid="fn3746">16</xref></sup> [are under the obligation].<sup><xref rid="fn3747">17</xref></sup> If they came to the memorial address,<sup><xref rid="fn3748">18</xref></sup> those who can see the mourners are exempt and those who cannot see them are under the obligation.</p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: Rabban Gamaliel had a borrowed grave<sup><xref rid="fn3749">19</xref></sup> in Jabneh where they brought the dead and locked the door behind it. Men came, stood in the row and comforted the mourners and the public was thereby exempt [from this duty]. Later [the bodies] were conveyed to Jerusalem [for burial].</p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>. After [the tomb] was closed with the top stone, [the mourner] muffles his head.<sup><xref rid="fn3750">20</xref></sup> Should he take his stand in the row,<sup><xref rid="fn3751">21</xref></sup> he unmuffles his head and exempts others [from standing in the row for him]. When he leaves the row he muffles his head. After he has entered his house, should others come to comfort him, he unmuffles his head and exempts them.</p>
<p><small>RULE 10</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3752">22</xref></sup> When a Sage or a disciple suffers bereavement, people come and sit down before him and discuss the laws relating to mourners. Should they make a mistake he corrects them in a low tone, but he does not ask questions.<sup><xref rid="fn3753">23</xref></sup> If he so desire he may speak personally to them, and if not he appoints someone to be his spokesman. It is related that when his son died, R. Judah appointed someone to be his spokesman. It is related that when his son died, R. Jose the Galilean appointed someone to be his spokesman. It is related that when his son died, R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba continued his discourse all the day.<sup><xref rid="fn3754">24</xref></sup> The same is also reported of Rabbi [Judah the Prince]; he continued his discourse all the day.</p>
<p><small>RULE 11</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3755">25</xref></sup> In the first week a mourner does not enter the Synagogue; in the second week he enters but does not sit in his [usual] place; in the third week he enters and sits in his [usual] place but does not speak; in the fourth week he is like any other person. R. Simeon said: In the first week<sup><xref rid="fn3756">26</xref></sup> people come up to him to comfort him; the second week is treated like the first, the third like the second, and in the fourth week he is like any other person. R. Meir said: In the first and second week he does not enter the Synagogue, in the third he enters and sits in his [usual] place, and in the fourth he is like any other person. To what does this apply? To a Synagogue, but as for a House of Study he may enter it even in the first week.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn3757">27</xref></sup>On the Sabbath-eve at dusk he unmuffles his head; at the termination of the Sabbath he muffles it again. On the Sabbath-eve at dusk he turns back [the garment which is] rent; at the termination of the Sabbath he turns it to the front.</p>
<p><small>RULE 12</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3758">28</xref></sup> When a Sage dies, his <italic>Beth Hammidrash</italic> goes into vacation and all the others change their place. When an <italic>&#x2019;Ab Beth Din</italic> dies, all the other Houses of Study in his city go into vacation and the others change their place. When a <italic>Nasi&#x2019;</italic> dies, all the Houses of Study go into vacation; people do not walk about in the street but enter [their homes] and sit in silence overcome by distress like men without a leader. When the time of rising arrives, they stand up and reduce their affairs to a minimum. The people of the Synagogue enter the Synagogue [on the Sabbath] and seven persons read the weekly portion of the Torah and go away.</p>
<p><small>RULE 13</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3759">29</xref></sup> Neither <italic>Halakah</italic> nor <italic>&#x2019;Aggada</italic> should be expounded in the <italic>Beth Hammidrash</italic> of a mourner. Should a question be raised, they begin with the laws relating to mourners, pass on to other themes and revert to and end with the laws relating to mourners.</p>
<p><sup><xref rid="fn3760">30</xref></sup>R. &#x1E24;anina b. Gamaliel said: We may discourse upon an aggadic theme in the <italic>Beth Hammidrash</italic> of a mourner. In Judea they greeted mourners [on the Sabbath] on their entry and departure to indicate that there is no mourning on the Sabbath.</p>

<title>CHAPTER XI</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. In a city where there are two dead, they take out the first<sup><xref rid="fn3761">1</xref></sup> [for burial]; and if<sup><xref rid="fn3762">2</xref></sup> they keep the first overnight<sup><xref rid="fn3763">3</xref></sup> they take out the second, because [the Sages] said, &#x2018;Whoever keeps the dead overnight disfigures him&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn3764">4</xref></sup> But if [the delay] is to dig a grave for him, or to procure shrouds for him, or to enable his relatives to come from another place, he may be kept overnight and there is no wrong done.<sup><xref rid="fn3765">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>When a Sage and a disciple die, they first take out the Sage [for burial]; a disciple and an <italic>&#x2018;am ha&#x2019;are&#x1E93;</italic>, they first take out the disciple. If both were Sages or disciples or an <italic>&#x2019;am ha&#x2019;are&#x1E93;</italic> they take out the one who dies first. If a man and a woman [died], they first take out the woman because a woman is apt to become disfigured more quickly.<sup><xref rid="fn3766">6</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. The differences between man and woman<sup><xref rid="fn3767">7</xref></sup> are: [the bier of] a man is set down in the broadway<sup><xref rid="fn3768">8</xref></sup> but not that of a woman;<sup><xref rid="fn3769">9</xref></sup> for a man they go up with the <italic>&#x1E25;eber &#x2018;ir</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3770">10</xref></sup> but not for a woman; for a male [mourner] the mourners&#x2019; meal<sup><xref rid="fn3771">11</xref></sup> is provided but not for a female [mourner].<sup><xref rid="fn3772">12</xref></sup> R. Judah said: If she has young children, a meal is provided [for her] together with them.</p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. If they have taken out the first [body] and buried him, they do not stand in the row for him, nor do they recite for him the benediction of mourners until they have taken out the second and buried him. When they have taken out the second and buried him, people come and stand in the row and comfort [the mourners], and they thereby exempt the community [from their duty in this matter]. We do not offer consolation to two mourners<sup><xref rid="fn3773">13</xref></sup> at the same time unless they are of equal status.</p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. We do not take out two dead on one bier unless they are of equal status and [merit] equal praise. It is related of a certain man in Usha<sup><xref rid="fn3774">14</xref></sup> that the house collapsed on his two sons and daughter. People went and inquired of R. Judah [49<italic>a</italic>] who said, &#x2018;Take out the three of them at the same time&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn3775">15</xref></sup> They placed the bridegrooms<sup><xref rid="fn3776">16</xref></sup> at one end [of the bier] and the bride<sup><xref rid="fn3777">17</xref></sup> at the other and they lamented, &#x2018;Alas, alas, bridegrooms&#x0021; Alas, alas, bride&#x0021;&#x2019;</p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. We do not deliver two memorial addresses [at the same time] in one city unless there are sufficient to attend each. We do not bewail two brides [at the same time] in one city unless there are sufficient to attend each. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: Even then it is forbidden because of ill-feeling.<sup><xref rid="fn3778">18</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. When a dead person and a bride are being honoured and [the two processions] approach one another, we cause the funeral procession to make way for the bridal procession,<sup><xref rid="fn3779">19</xref></sup> because the honour of the living takes precedence over the honour of the dead. In the case of a royal procession and a bridal procession, the latter makes way<sup><xref rid="fn3780">20</xref></sup> out of respect for the king. King Agrippa made way for a bride and the Sages praised him. They asked him, &#x2018;What was your reason for doing this?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;I wear a crown every day but she wears a crown for one hour only&#x2019;.</p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>. We do not<sup><xref rid="fn3781">21</xref></sup> interrupt the study of the Torah for the sake of a funeral or bridal procession. Abba Saul said: [Good] deeds<sup><xref rid="fn3782">22</xref></sup> take precedence of the study of the Torah. R. Judah acted as follows: Whenever he saw a dead person or a bride being honoured, he used to look at his disciples and exclaim, &#x2018;Deeds before study&#x2019;.</p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3783">23</xref></sup> A woman who is bereaved of her father-in-law or any of her husband&#x2019;s relatives may not paint her eyelids with kohl or adorn herself, but conducts herself as [her husband] does.<sup><xref rid="fn3784">24</xref></sup> Likewise if [her husband] is bereaved of his father-in-law or any of his wife&#x2019;s relatives, he cannot compel her to adorn herself but conducts himself as she does.</p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3785">25</xref></sup> Sweeping the floors, washing dishes and making beds do not constitute work for a mourner.<sup><xref rid="fn3786">26</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 10</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3787">27</xref></sup> A <italic>dargesh</italic><sup><xref rid="fn3788">28</xref></sup> is tilted up<sup><xref rid="fn3789">29</xref></sup> and not overturned. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: He loosens its step<sup><xref rid="fn3790">30</xref></sup> and leaves it as it is.</p>
<p><small>RULE 11</small>. Should five brothers eat at their father&#x2019;s table and he dies, if each of them [usually] goes to his own home to sleep, he overturns [the bed] in his house; but if not, he overturns it only in the house which is used [for sleeping].</p>
<p><small>RULE 12</small>. If a man possesses five houses, should he be making use of all of them he overturns [the bed] in all of them; if not, he does not overturn it in all of them but only in the house which is used [for sleeping].</p>
<p><small>RULE 13</small>. If one resides with his friend as a guest, should he be very intimate with him he overturns [the bed there], and if not he does not overturn it.</p>
<p><small>RULE 14</small>. If one is on a journey and news reaches him that he suffered a bereavement, should he be able to overturn [the bed] with the consent of others he overturns it, and if not he does not overturn it.</p>
<p><small>RULE 15</small>. One overturns his bed [which is laid] on two benches or on four stones even if there be five mattresses on it, and even though it be [only] four handbreadths<sup><xref rid="fn3791">31</xref></sup> above the ground, so long as its legs are tilted upwards.</p>
<p><small>RULE 16</small>. So long as his dead is lying before him, a mourner may not sleep on a bed [in an erect position] or on an overturned bed.</p>
<p><small>RULE 17</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3792">32</xref></sup> One who sleeps on a bench or on a bench for water-jugs<sup><xref rid="fn3793">33</xref></sup> is subject to the duty of overturning.<sup><xref rid="fn3794">34</xref></sup> If he declares, &#x2018;I will not overturn the bed but sleep<sup><xref rid="fn3795">35</xref></sup> on the bench&#x2019;, we do not listen to him but say, &#x2018;It is subject to [the law of] overturning&#x2019;.</p>
<p><small>RULE 18</small>. The bed has to be overturned six times, five times, four times [or] three times, neither less nor more. How is this? If the death took place close to dusk,<sup><xref rid="fn3796">36</xref></sup> [it is done] six times; if close to dusk on the Sabbath-eve five times; if a Festival occurs on the day following the Sabbath four times; in the case of the two days of the New Year [after a Sabbath] three times.<sup><xref rid="fn3797">37</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 19</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3798">38</xref></sup> When does one overturn the bed? From the time the corpse is taken out through the door of the house, according to the view of R. Eliezer. R. Joshua said: From the time the slab closes the tomb. It is related that when Rabban Gamaliel the Elder<sup><xref rid="fn3799">39</xref></sup> died, as soon as he was taken out through the door of his house, [R. Eliezer] said to them,<sup><xref rid="fn3800">40</xref></sup> &#x2018;Overturn your beds&#x2019;; and when the slab closed the tomb R. Joshua said, Overturn your beds&#x2019;. They replied, &#x2018;We have already overturned them by order of the Elder&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn3801">41</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn3761">(1) i.e. the one who died first and then the second.</ftnote>

There, too, the &#x2018;benediction of the mourners&#x2019; was recited on the return from the cemetery (cf. Keth. 8b, Sonc. ed., p. 37). According to Krauss, <italic>Synagogale Altert&#x00FC;mer</italic>, p. 297, it was the open space in front of the Synagogue, but this definition is disputed; cf. J. Rabbinowitz, <italic>Mishnah Megillah</italic>, p. 88.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn3770">(10) This term may signify a Rabbi who took a leading part in town affairs, or &#x2018;a group&#x2019; denoting either a town council similar to the Roman Collegia or an official communal religious or charitable organization (Meg. 27b, Sonc. ed., p. 164, n. 1). The assembly was usually headed by the Rabbi, and it was considered undignified for him to do so for a woman.</ftnote>

<title>CHAPTER XII</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3802">1</xref></sup> The day of hearing<sup><xref rid="fn3803">2</xref></sup> [the news of the death] is regarded as the day of burial<sup><xref rid="fn3804">3</xref></sup> for rending [garments], mourning and the observance of the seven [days] and thirty [days]; but as for eating sacred flesh<sup><xref rid="fn3805">4</xref></sup> he is only regarded as one who gathers bones.<sup><xref rid="fn3806">5</xref></sup> Both of them may not eat sacred flesh.<sup><xref rid="fn3807">6</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. R. Eliezer said: [On receiving] &#x2018;near tidings&#x2019;,<sup><xref rid="fn3808">7</xref></sup> [that is to say, if news reached him] within thirty days [of the death], one observes [mourning] for seven [days] and thirty [days]; [if the news reached him] later than this he observes [mourning] for only one day. R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: On receiving &#x2018;near tidings&#x2019; [that is to say, if news reached him] within twelve months [of the death], one observes [mourning] for seven [days] and thirty [days]. The Sages said: Whether it be &#x2018;near tidings&#x2019; or &#x2018;distant tidings&#x2019;,<sup><xref rid="fn3809">8</xref></sup> he observes [mourning] for seven [days] and thirty [days]. It is related that when R. &#x1E92;ado&#x1E33;&#x2019;s father died at Ginza&#x1E33;<sup><xref rid="fn3810">9</xref></sup> in Media and the news reached him after three years, he observed [mourning] for seven [days] and thirty [days].</p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. Any [dead person] for whom one rends [the garments] on his death, one also rends for him when his bones are gathered. For [a dead person] for whom one may not baste [the edge of his garments] on his death, one may not baste them when his bones are gathered.</p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. The gathering of bones must be done only during one day; therefore one only gathers them towards dusk.<sup><xref rid="fn3811">10</xref></sup> If he gathered them throughout the day and<sup><xref rid="fn3812">11</xref></sup> it became dark, it is permissible [to continue] on the following day. We do not stand in the row for them, nor do we recite over them the benediction of mourners, nor offer consolation to the mourners<sup><xref rid="fn3813">12</xref></sup> [in public], but we may do so in private. We do not hold an assembly for them in the broadway,<sup><xref rid="fn3814">13</xref></sup> but we do bring the mourners&#x2019; meal into the mourner&#x2019;s home.<sup><xref rid="fn3815">14</xref></sup> R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: During the day he lies<sup><xref rid="fn3816">15</xref></sup> on an overturned bed and at dusk he straightens it.</p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. The following was the practice of the Brotherhoods<sup><xref rid="fn3817">16</xref></sup> in Jerusalem: Some went to the house of mourning, others to the house of feasting,<sup><xref rid="fn3818">17</xref></sup> some went to a circumcision<sup><xref rid="fn3819">18</xref></sup> and others to gather bones. [In the choice between going] to the house of mourning and the house of feasting, the house of feasting takes precedence; to a circumcision and to gather bones, the circumcision takes precedence. The pious men of olden days, however, gave precedence to the house of mourning over the house of feasting, for it is stated, <italic>It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting; for that is the end of all men, and the living will lay it to his heart</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3820">19</xref></sup> Whoever follows the bier should say, &#x2018;I, too, will follow this one [to the grave]&#x2019;.</p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. We do not break the bones nor sever the sinews [of a corpse] unless the bones were already broken of their own accord and the sinews severed of their own accord.</p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>. A man may gather all bones except those of his father and mother,<sup><xref rid="fn3821">20</xref></sup> in the view of R. Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Nuri. R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: Bones may not be gathered until the flesh dissolves; once the flesh is dissolved the appearance [of the person] is no longer recognizable.<sup><xref rid="fn3822">21</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>. One may gather the bones of two dead persons at the same time; he then places one collection at one end of the sheet [49<italic>b</italic>] and the other at the other side of it, in the view of R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba. R. Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Nuri said: [If this is done] the sheet may in the end decay and the bones be mixed together; so we gather them and place them [separately] in cedar<sup><xref rid="fn3823">22</xref></sup> [boxes].</p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>. We sprinkle wine and oil upon [the bodies], in the view of R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba; R. Simeon b. Nanos said: Oil but not wine because wine causes deterioration;<sup><xref rid="fn3824">23</xref></sup> and the Sages said: Neither oil nor wine because they breed wood-worms,<sup><xref rid="fn3825">24</xref></sup> but we place dry clods of earth upon them. R. Eliezer b. &#x1E92;ado&#x1E33; said: When my father was dying he gave me this instruction, &#x2018;On my death bury me first in a valley, and later gather my bones and place them in a cedar<sup><xref rid="fn3826">25</xref></sup> coffin, but do not gather them with your hands&#x2019;. And I did so for him. R. Jo&#x1E25;anan entered [the cave] and spread a sheet over [the bones]; then I entered, rent [my garments] and spread dry clods of earth [over the bones].<sup><xref rid="fn3827">26</xref></sup> As [my father] did for his father so I did for him.</p>
<p><small>RULE 10</small>. A man bandages<sup><xref rid="fn3828">27</xref></sup> and binds [the limb] of a man but not of a woman; a woman bandages and binds both a man and a woman. A man attends to a man suffering from disease of the bowels but not to a woman;<sup><xref rid="fn3829">28</xref></sup> a woman attends both to a man<sup><xref rid="fn3830">29</xref></sup> and a woman suffering from disease of the bowels.</p>
<p><small>RULE 11</small>. Abba Saul b. Bothnith<sup><xref rid="fn3831">30</xref></sup> used to say to his sons, &#x2018;Bury me at the feet of my father and remove the thread of blue from [the <italic>&#x1E93;i&#x1E93;ith</italic> of] my cloak&#x2019;.</p>

R. Judah said: If his father is old or ill, he may enter and bathe him because that is a way of honouring him.<sup><xref rid="fn3834">33</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 13</small>. We do not take out [the dead on] a bier unless his head and the greater part of his body are there. R. Judah said: The spinal column and the skull constitute the greater part. It is related of the son of R. &#x1E24;anina b. Teradion that he took to evil ways and robbers seized and killed him. After three days his swollen body was found; they placed him in a coffin,<sup><xref rid="fn3835">34</xref></sup> set him on a bier, took him into the city and paid him a eulogy<sup><xref rid="fn3836">35</xref></sup> out of respect for his father and mother. His father quoted over him the verse, <italic>And thou moan, when thine end cometh, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed, and say, &#x2018;How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof; neither have I hearkened to the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me&#x0021; I was well nigh in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly</italic>.&#x2019;<sup><xref rid="fn3837">36</xref></sup> When he had finished he went back to the beginning of the verse. His mother quoted over him the verse, <italic>A foolish son is the vexation to his father, and bitterness to her that bore him</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3838">37</xref></sup> His sister quoted over him the verse, <italic>Bread of falsehood is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3839">38</xref></sup></p>

<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER XIII</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. One who gathers or guards bones is exempt from reading the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic>, the <italic>Tefillah</italic>, from <italic>tefillin</italic> and all the commandments prescribed by the Torah. Should he desire to impose a strict view upon himself, he may not do so because of the honour of the bones.<sup><xref rid="fn3840">1</xref></sup> R. Jo&#x1E25;anan b. Nuri said: He should withdraw a distance of four cubits and read [the prayers]. R. Simeon b. &#x2018;Azzai said: If he was travelling on a ship with the bones, he should remove them to another part [of the vessel] and read.<sup><xref rid="fn3841">2</xref></sup> R. Isaac said: If they are the bones of a near relative he is exempt, but if of strangers he is under obligation. R. Simeon said: On the Sabbath he is under obligation,<sup><xref rid="fn3842">3</xref></sup> but on week-days he is exempt. R. Nathan said:<sup><xref rid="fn3843">4</xref></sup> If the bundle [containing the bones] is with him, he is not exempt<sup><xref rid="fn3844">5</xref></sup> because the obligation of guarding [the bones] rests upon him but not the obligation of guarding the bundle.</p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. One who is removing bones or sacred books from one place to another may not place them on a wagon or a ship or an animal and<sup><xref rid="fn3845">6</xref></sup> sit on them; but if it is for their benefit<sup><xref rid="fn3846">7</xref></sup> or to escape paying ransom to robbers it is permissible.<sup><xref rid="fn3847">8</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. If one passes through graves he should not wear the <italic>tefillin</italic> or carry sacred books in his hand, because it is disrespectful [to the dead].<sup><xref rid="fn3848">9</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. If one is constructing a burial chamber<sup><xref rid="fn3849">10</xref></sup> [in a cemetery] and the time for reading the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic> arrives, he should not read the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic> or the <italic>Tefillah</italic> but withdraw to a clean place and read; after that he re-enters [the chamber].</p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. If one finds a dead body in a grave he may not move it from its place,<sup><xref rid="fn3850">11</xref></sup> unless he knows that the place was lent to it.<sup><xref rid="fn3851">12</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. If one finds bones in a grave he should place them in mounds,<sup><xref rid="fn3852">13</xref></sup> in the view of R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba; but the Sages said: He should not move them from their place. If he found them in a burial chamber or in a cedar-wood coffin,<sup><xref rid="fn3853">14</xref></sup> he should not move them from their place.</p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>. We may not transfer a dead body or bones from one place of honour to another, or from a place of shame to a place of honour,<sup><xref rid="fn3854">15</xref></sup> and needless to say from a place of honour to a place of shame; but within [the dead person&#x2019;s] property it is permissible [to transfer] even from a place of honour to a place of shame, because it is to his honour.<sup><xref rid="fn3855">16</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>. We do not bury two dead bodies in close proximity to each other, or a dead body in close proximity to bones, or bones in close proximity to a dead body. R. Judah said: Whoever sleeps with him in his lifetime<sup><xref rid="fn3856">17</xref></sup> is buried with him in his death.<sup><xref rid="fn3857">18</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>. One may derive benefit from a grave which has been cleared,<sup><xref rid="fn3858">19</xref></sup> but he may not turn it into a magazine for straw, a stable, a store for wood or a depot. If one clears a burial chamber he may not make use of it [for any other purpose]. If one prepares a grave for a living person<sup><xref rid="fn3859">20</xref></sup> he may sell it; but if he prepared it for the dead he may not sell it. Stones which were hewn<sup><xref rid="fn3860">21</xref></sup> for one still living may be sold, but if for the dead they may not be sold. If one clears a coffin he may not make use of it; but if it was made of stone or earthenware it must be broken up, and if of wood it must be burnt. If one finds boards in a cemetery<sup><xref rid="fn3861">22</xref></sup> he may not move them from their place.</p>
<ftnote id="fn3840">(1) His obedience of laws, from which he is exempt, would result in delay in the burial of the bones.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3841">(2) The text is in disorder and the translation follows the version of GRA.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3842">(3) Because if he does not read the prayers he would appear to be mourning on the Sabbath which is not permitted.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3843">(4) The text is corrupt and emended by GRA. R. Nathan agrees with the ruling that one who guards bones is exempt from the <italic>Shema&#x2018;</italic>, etc., because his concern about their safety may not allow him to concentrate on his religious devotions; but where he carries them in a bundle the question of their safety does not arise and he should be able to concentrate.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3844">(5) In his note on the text GRA reads &#x2018;is exempt&#x2019;, but in his annotation to Y.D. ch. 403 he rules that, in the circumstances here described, the man is obliged to read the prayers, etc.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3845">(6) So GRA and H. V has &#x2018;and not sit&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3846">(7) i.e. for the protection of the bones.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3847">(8) V inserts here a sentence in brackets which is irrelevant to the subject and is omitted by GRA and H.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3848">(9) In Ber. 18a (Sonc. ed., p. 108) he is said to transgress the teaching, <italic>Whoso mocketh the poor blasphemeth his Maker</italic> (Prov. XVII, 5), because the dead are &#x2018;poor&#x2019; in that they cannot acquire merit by the study and performance of the Torah.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3849">(10) Vaults were made in the graves for receiving the dead; cf. Ber. 14b (Sonc. ed., p. 85).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3850">(11) The dead acquire possession of the spot wherein they are buried. Cf. Sanh. 47b (Sonc. ed., p. 316).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3851">(12) Cf. above X, 8. The word &#x2018;lent&#x2019; is according to the text of GRA and H.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3852">(13) Reading <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05D4;&#x05DE;&#x05D5;&#x05E8;&#x05D5;&#x05EA;</span> defined as &#x2018;mounds used as burying places of executed criminals&#x2019; (Jastrow). GRA reads: &#x2018;One who finds bones in mounds should place them in a grave&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3853">(14) So Jastrow. GRA has &#x2018;or in a ravine&#x2019;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3854">(15) The translation follows GRA who alters the text in agreement with j.M.&#x1E32;. II, 4, 81b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3855">(16) To be buried within his own property.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3856">(17) i.e. young children.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3857">(18) i.e. in close proximity to him.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3858">(19) Since it is no longer considered the possession of the dead.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3859">(20) In preparation for his death.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3860">(21) To be used for a sepulchre.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3861">(22) So emended by GRA. V reads &#x2018;if one carries out boards to a cemetery&#x2019;.</ftnote>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>CHAPTER XIV</title>
<p><small>RULE 1</small>. A watercourse should not be diverted through cemeteries,<sup><xref rid="fn3862">1</xref></sup> a path should not be cut through them, cattle should not be grazed on them, one should not take a walk there<sup><xref rid="fn3863">2</xref></sup> for pleasure, and one should not gather wood or grass from there. If he gathered them he may not make use of them, and if he gathered them for the benefit [of the cemetery]<sup><xref rid="fn3864">3</xref></sup> he burns them on the spot.</p>
<p><small>RULE 2</small>. Inherited lands may be conveyed from one [party] to another or alienated from one family to another, but a grave cannot be so conveyed or alienated.<sup><xref rid="fn3865">4</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 3</small>. A new cemetery<sup><xref rid="fn3866">5</xref></sup> may be measured<sup><xref rid="fn3867">6</xref></sup> and sold or divided;<sup><xref rid="fn3868">7</xref></sup> an old one may not be measured, sold or divided. A new cemetery may sometimes be regarded as old and an old one as new. An old cemetery in which ten bodies have been buried without the consent of the owners is regarded as new; it may be measured, sold or divided. A new cemetery in which one premature child<sup><xref rid="fn3869">8</xref></sup> lies buried with the consent of the owners is regarded as old; it may not be measured, sold or divided.<sup><xref rid="fn3870">9</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 4</small>. No right of legal ownership can be claimed in respect of a cemetery of exiles;<sup><xref rid="fn3871">10</xref></sup> in time of pestilence or war no right of legal ownership can be claimed in respect of cemeteries.<sup><xref rid="fn3872">11</xref></sup> Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel said: Premature children do not acquire possession of their grave.<sup><xref rid="fn3873">12</xref></sup> One who has buried without the consent [of the owner of the land] possesses no right of legal ownership.</p>
<p><small>RULE 5</small>. A woman who inherited a grave-space is buried therein as also her issue, in the view of R. Meir; R. Judah said: She [is buried there] but not<sup><xref rid="fn3874">13</xref></sup> her issue. R. Judah admits that any offspring whom she saw in her lifetime are buried with her [if they die] after her death.<sup><xref rid="fn3875">14</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 6</small>. If her father says, &#x2018;Let her be buried by my side&#x2019; and her husband says, &#x2018;Let her be buried [50<italic>a</italic>] by my side&#x2019;, she is buried by the side of her father; but if she had children, she is buried by her husband&#x2019;s side, and if she says, &#x2018;Bury me by the side of my children&#x2019;, she is buried by their side.</p>
<p><small>RULE 7</small>. If her father says, &#x2018;She is not to be buried by my side&#x2019; and her husband says, &#x2018;She is not to be buried by my side&#x2019;, she is buried by the side of her husband because her husband has the obligation to support her, redeem her [from captivity],<sup><xref rid="fn3876">15</xref></sup> bury her and provide all that is necessary<sup><xref rid="fn3877">16</xref></sup> for her funeral, [for example,] a bier, pipers<sup><xref rid="fn3878">17</xref></sup> and wailing women.<sup><xref rid="fn3879">18</xref></sup> Where it is customary to have a memorial address, he has a memorial address delivered over his wife. If her husband does not attend to her [burial, her father] attends to it and the expenses are recovered from [the husband] by force.</p>
<p><small>RULE 8</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3880">19</xref></sup> Consequently you say that there are three kinds of graves: a grave which has been found may be cleared,<sup><xref rid="fn3881">20</xref></sup> and if cleared its site is [ritually] clean and it is permitted to make use of it. A known grave may not be cleared,<sup><xref rid="fn3882">21</xref></sup> and if cleared its site is [ritually] unclean and it is forbidden to make use of it. A grave which injures the public<sup><xref rid="fn3883">22</xref></sup> may not be cleared, and if cleared its site is [ritually] clean but it is forbidden to make use of it.</p>
<p><small>RULE 9</small>. As regards a cemetery which is enclosed by a city on three sides or on two opposite sides, if it is more than fifty cubits distant from one side [of the city] and more than fifty cubits distant from the other side, it is not<sup><xref rid="fn3884">23</xref></sup> cleared and if less it may be cleared.</p>
<p><small>RULE 10</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3885">24</xref></sup> All graves may be cleared except that of a king or a prophet. R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: The grave of a king or prophet may also be cleared. R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba was asked, &#x2018;Were not the graves of the house of David and of Huldah the prophetess<sup><xref rid="fn3886">25</xref></sup> [situated] in Jerusalem and no man ever touched them?&#x2019; He replied, &#x2018;Can you adduce a proof from [Jerusalem]? There was an underground passage there and the uncleanness was conveyed to the brook of Kidron&#x2019;.<sup><xref rid="fn3887">26</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 11</small>. If one sells to another the path [leading] to his grave, this is no sale.<sup><xref rid="fn3888">27</xref></sup> If one sells to another his place of mourning,<sup><xref rid="fn3889">28</xref></sup> it is no sale. If one sells<sup><xref rid="fn3890">29</xref></sup> to another his halting place,<sup><xref rid="fn3891">30</xref></sup> the elders of the <italic>&#x2019;Ab Beth Din</italic> estimate it as an area of four <italic>&#x1E33;ab</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3892">31</xref></sup> A private path [has a width] of four cubits, a public road [a width] of sixteen cubits, the king&#x2019;s highway has no limits. The path of a funeral cort&#x00E8;ge has no limits.<sup><xref rid="fn3893">32</xref></sup> and the path of [a place of] mourning has no limits.</p>
<p><small>RULE 12</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3894">33</xref></sup> One who sees a mourner within the thirty days speaks to him words of consolation but does not inquire after his welfare; after thirty days he inquires after his welfare but does not speak to him words of consolation; within the twelve months he inquires after his welfare and then speaks words of consolation to him; after twelve months he speaks to him words of consolation and then inquires after his welfare.</p>
<p>R. Meir said: One who sees a mourner within the thirty days speaks to him words of consolation and then inquires after his welfare; after thirty days but within twelve months he inquires after his welfare and then speaks to him words of consolation; after twelve months he makes no reference at all [to the bereavement]. For R. Meir illustrated the matter by a parable. To what may it be compared? To one who has a wound and was cured of it, and a physician came and said to him, &#x2018;Pay me a fee and I will lance your wound and cure you&#x2019;. Likewise, whoever reminds a mourner after twelve months [of his bereavement] is accounted as if he had stirred up his wound again. Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel said: To one whose wife died and he remarried within twelve months we speak words of consolation in the street but not in his home.<sup><xref rid="fn3895">34</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 13</small>. All bring to the house of a mourner loaves of white bread, meat and fish, and where an assembly in the broadway<sup><xref rid="fn3896">35</xref></sup> is held also vegetables, peas and fish. Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel said: Where it is customary also cooked dishes.<sup><xref rid="fn3897">36</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 14</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3898">37</xref></sup> Ten cups of wine are drunk in the house of a mourner: two before the meal, five during the meal and three after the meal, namely one for the benediction of mourners,<sup><xref rid="fn3899">38</xref></sup> one for the consolation of the mourners and one [in honour of] charity.<sup><xref rid="fn3900">39</xref></sup> Three more [cups of wine] were added later, namely, one for the Chief of the Synagogue,<sup><xref rid="fn3901">40</xref></sup> one for the Synagogue attendant<sup><xref rid="fn3902">41</xref></sup> and one for Rabban Gamaliel.<sup><xref rid="fn3903">42</xref></sup> When, however, the <italic>Beth Din</italic> found that people became intoxicated they restored the <italic>status quo</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3904">43</xref></sup></p>
<p><small>RULE 15</small>. He who recites the Grace after meals in the house of a mourner does not say the fourth benediction,<sup><xref rid="fn3905">44</xref></sup> in the view of R. Jose the Galilean; R. &#x2018;A&#x1E33;iba said: [He recites] &#x2018;Who art kind and dealest kindly&#x2019;; the Sages said: [The benediction to be recited is, &#x2018;Blessed art Thou] Who art the true Judge, Who rulest over Thy works, Judge of all generations in righteousness, Whose people and servants we all are; and for all this it is our duty to thank and bless Him&#x2019;.</p>
<p><small>RULE 16</small>.<sup><xref rid="fn3906">45</xref></sup> He who sees a place where miracles were wrought for Israel says, &#x2018;Blessed be He Who wrought miracles for our fathers in this place. <italic>O give thanks unto the Lord, for He is good&#x2019;</italic>.<sup><xref rid="fn3907">46</xref></sup></p>
<ftnote id="fn3862">(1) Out of respect for the dead; cf. Meg. 29a (Sonc. ed., p. 177).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3863">(2) It should not be used as a short cut.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3864">(3) To clear the ground for more graves. The words in brackets are inserted by GRA and H.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3865">(4) Cf. below, &#x00A7;11.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3866">(5) In which only a few have been buried.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3867">(6) To find out how much land had already been used for burials as a guide for further interments.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3868">(7) Among heirs.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3869">(8) Under thirty days old; how much more an adult&#x0021;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3870">(9) &#x2018;Or divided&#x2019; is added by GRA and H.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3871">(10) Who in time of pestilence or war move from place to place.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3872">(11) This clause is explanatory of the preceding.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3873">(12) If buried without the consent of the owners.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3874">(13) So GRA and H. V reads &#x2018;and all&#x2019; incorrectly.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3875">(14) But not a posthumous child. V has &#x2018;on her death&#x2019; and the reading of H is adopted.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3876">(15) Cf. Keth. 46b (Sonc. ed., p. 266).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3877">(16) So GRA.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3878">(17) To play at the funeral; cf. B.M. VI, 1 (Sonc. ed., p. 437, n. 3).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3879">(18) Cf. M.&#x1E32;. III, 9 (Sonc. ed., p. 185). They are mentioned in Jer. IX, 16.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3880">(19) The text is in disorder. The translation follows the emendation of GRA on the basis of Sanh. 47b (Sonc. ed., p. 316).
