Version Notes,
"Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta, Introduction.1","This tractate differs from <i>Derek ’Ereẓ Rabbah</i> in that its teachings are directed mainly at scholars. A close examination reveals that the tractate is not the work of one author. In the editions of the Talmud, chaps. V-VIII are noted as having been taken from the <i>Maḥzor Viṭri</i>. The author of <i>Halakoth Gedoloth</i> quotes the section corresponding to chaps. V-VIII under the name of <i>Derek ’Ereẓ Zuṭa</i>, but designates the other chapters <i>Darkan shel Talmidë Ḥakamim</i>, which is the opening phrase of chap. I."
"Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta, Introduction.2","It is possible that an unknown author compiled this shortened form of <i>Derek ’Ereẓ</i> and called it <i>Zuṭa</i>, and subsequently the term <i>Rabbah</i> may have been added to the original work to distinguish it from the smaller digest. The language and style of <i>Zuṭa</i> presuppose a much later date, probably after the completion of the Talmud. In some instances it is evident that the author must have had the Talmud before him. The first four chapters, however, appear to date from an earlier period. They may even have been an independent collection already in existence in the time of the <i>Tannaïm</i>, as they contain material which is old and often quoted as Baraithoth by the early authorities."
"Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta, Introduction.3","The different sections were put together by a later compiler, because all have the common factor that they contain exhortations to self-examination and meekness, and advocate temperance, resignation, gentleness, patience, respect for age, readiness to forgive, and the moral and social duties of a scholar."
"Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta, Introduction.4","<i>Zuṭa</i> is written mostly in the form of short, pithy and disconnected maxims arranged in the style of <i>Pirḳë Aboth</i>, except that they are anonymous. Here, too, the compiler attempted to arrange the teachings as far as possible according to external characteristics, the order followed being determined by the initial word or by the number of maxims. Precepts beginning with the same word are placed together even when unrelated in subject-matter. Especially are they so combined into groups of four, five or seven maxims, numbers which serve as an aid in memorizing the passages."
"Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta, Introduction.5","It has already been mentioned in the Introduction to <i>Derek ’Ereẓ Rabbah</i> that in Coronel’s edition of <i>Ḥamishshah Ḳunṭrasim</i> we find many passages in <i>Kallah Rabbathi</i>, with Gemara attached, which really belong to <i>Derek ’Ereẓ</i>. They are as follows: III-V in KR are similar to I-III in DEZ, while VI, VII, IX and X in KR are similar to III-XI in DER."
"Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta, Introduction.6",<small>ANALYSIS OF THE TRACTATE</small>
"Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta, Introduction.7","In chaps. I-IV disciples are exhorted to devote themselves to the study of the Torah, to be humble, modest and sin-fearing. The conclusion of chap. IV may well have been an oration delivered at the ordination of a Rabbi."
"Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta, Introduction.8","Chaps. V-VIII contain rules of conduct for various occasions such as when eating and drinking, and on social behaviour in general. Here we find repetitions of and similarities to the contents of DER."
"Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta, Introduction.9",Chap. IX consists of advice given by R. Eliezer Ha-Ḳappar to one of his disciples on a variety of subjects.
"Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta, Introduction.10","Like the <i>Pereḳ Hashshalom</i>, chap. X was probably a separate work which was later attached to the tractate. It deals with the signs of the coming of the Messianic era."
"Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta, Introduction.11",In DEZ the lack of redaction is more marked than in DER. In its present form it is later than DER (probably third century) and was quoted by <i>’Amoraïm</i> as Baraithoth and interpreted by teachers of the fourth century. The fact that the Geonim make mention of this tractate indicates that its final redaction must have taken place before that of the Babylonian Talmud.
"Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta, Introduction.12","[In the Talmud editions the chapters are not subdivided, but for the sake of convenience the numbering of the paragraphs has been adopted mainly from Higger’s edition.]"

Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.1.1,"The characteristics of a scholar are that he is meek, humble,<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) Cf. Aboth IV, 4 (Sonc. ed., p. 45).</i> alert, filled [with a desire for learning],<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) H reads <i>memullaḥ</i>, ‘bright’, as in Ḳid. 29b (Sonc. ed., p. 141). Cf. KR III, 2, p. 443, n. 13.</i> modest, beloved by all, humble to the members of his household and sin-fearing. He judges a man [fairly] according to his deeds,<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) He does not, e.g., interpret a man’s good actions as determined by ulterior motives and does not show favour where it is not deserved.</i> and says ‘I have no desire for all the things of this world because this world is not for me’. He sits and studies,<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) H omits ‘and studies’.</i> soiling his cloak at the feet of the scholars.<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) For <i>meṭannef</i> H reads <i>mith‘aṭṭef</i>, ‘wrapped in his cloak’, perhaps in the same sense as in Aboth I, 4 (Sonc. ed., p. 3), ‘Suffer thyself to be covered by the dust of their feet’, i.e. sit in the dust on the ground at their feet while they teach. GRA reads <i>maṭṭil</i>, ‘and throws his cloak in front of the feet of scholars’, perhaps for them to sit on. For a different explanation, cf. KR III, p. 444, n. 17.</i> In him no one sees any evil. He questions according to the subject-matter<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) Cf. Shab. 3b (Sonc. ed., pp. 5f.), ‘R. Ḥiyya said to Rab: “When Rabbi is occupied with one tractate, do not ask him a question relating to another” ’.</i> and answers to the point.<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) lit. ‘in accordance with the accepted decision’.</i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.1.2,"Be like a gourd split open that the wind may enter,<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) Let your mind be open to receive instruction. For readings which add the negative, cf. ARN p. 85 and KR p. 449.</i> like a deep furrow which retains its water,<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) Such a bed yields good produce; so must a scholar study continuously and raise good disciples.</i> like a jar coated with pitch which preserves its wine,<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) i.e. he must have a retentive memory.</i> and like a sponge which absorbs all.<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) Cf. Aboth V, 18 (Sonc. ed., V, 15, p. 69).</i>
Be not like a wide opening which allows the wind to rush in,<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) i.e. do not cultivate associates indiscriminately, yet do not be so unapproachable that worthy companionships cannot get near to you. Or, do not create a stir on entering and leaving; or, do not allow petty and frivolous ideas to enter your mind.</i> or like a narrow opening which injures the valuable [as they press through].<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">(13) By having to stoop or squeeze in; i.e. do not cause people worthy or your association to demean themselves or hold aloof.</i> Be like a doorstep on which everyone treads<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">(14) i.e. be ready to learn from all.</i> and like a low peg which is within the reach of all.<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">(15) lit. ‘on which all hang [their things]’.</i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.1.3,"If you suffered monetary loss, remember Job who was smitten both financially and physically. If you have been smitten physically, remember Dathan and Abiram who descended alive into Sheol.<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">(16) Cf. Num. 16, 32f.</i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.1.4,"Do not be enticed into sin by your eyes, because enticement into sin is caused only through the eyes.<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">(17) Cf. Soṭah 8a (Sonc. ed., p. 35), ‘We have learnt a tradition that the evil impulse only bears sway over what a person’s eyes see’.</i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.1.5,"Do not cause yourself to feel ashamed by your teeth<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">(18) GRA reads: ‘Do not be attracted to appetizing dishes’.</i> lest you eat more than is good for you.<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">(19) lit. ‘more than is sufficient’. NY quotes a reading: ‘That you do not give them too much to eat’. Another and better variant is: ‘That you eat not’, etc., i.e. <i>shello’</i> instead of <i>shemma’</i>.</i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.1.6,"Do not turn away from meritorious deeds and do not be attracted to heresy.<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">(20) Heb. <i>minuth</i>, a term for the teachings of the early Jewish-Christians.</i> Do not inquire of Sadducees<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">(21) A party holding views antagonistic to those of the Pharisees. They regarded only those observances obligatory which are in the written Torah and did not acknowledge what was derived by Rabbinical interpretation.</i> lest you be drawn into Gehinnom.<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">(22) By abandoning the Torah.</i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.1.7,"If others speak evil of you, answer them not; should it be a serious [calumny], regard it as slight. If, however, you spoke evil of others, though [the calumny] be slight, regard it as serious [and do not rest] until you go and pacify them.<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">(23) On the evil of slander, cf. ‘Arak. 15b (Sonc. ed., pp. 86ff.).</i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.1.8,"Let not your [behaviour during] adolescence be of blemished repute, for this would be derogatory to the Torah; but let it be of unblemished repute, for this would tend to glorify the Torah.<sup>24</sup><i class=""footnote"">(24) The translation follows GRA.</i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.1.9,"Love and honour the Torah.<sup>25</sup><i class=""footnote"">(25) By carrying out your duties towards God.</i> Love your fellow-creatures and respect them.<sup>26</sup><i class=""footnote"">(26) By observing your duties towards them.</i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.1.10,"Set aside your will in face of the will of your fellow,<sup>27</sup><i class=""footnote"">(27) When they conflict; cf. Aboth II, 4 (Sonc. ed., p. 14).</i> for so did Rachel towards Leah and David towards Saul.<sup>28</sup><i class=""footnote"">(28) Cf. KR IV, p. 454f.</i> Set aside your will and the will of your fellow in face of the will of Heaven, for so we find it with Jacob who did not kiss Joseph.<sup>29</sup><i class=""footnote"">(29) Cf. <i>ibid.</i></i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.1.11,"Love the [term] ‘perhaps’ and hate the [expression] ‘how much?’<sup>30</sup><i class=""footnote"">(30) i.e. ‘how much harm will it do to me?’ Or, be envious of others by saying, ‘Look how much So-and-so possesses!’</i> R. Ḥidḳa expressed this in another way: Love the [term] ‘perhaps’ and hate the [expression] ‘what of it?’<sup>31</sup><i class=""footnote"">(31) If I commit this trivial sin; so GRA, lit. ‘What is in it?’ it is of little consequence.</i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.1.12,"Keep aloof from anything that may lead to sin, from anything hideous and from whatever seems hideous,<sup>32</sup><i class=""footnote"">(32) Cf. Ḥul. 44b (Sonc. ed., p. 239).</i> lest others suspect you of sin."
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.1.13,Slander not your fellow because there is no remedy for him who slanders his fellow.
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.1.14,"Do not eat bread with a <i>kohen</i> who is an <i>‘am ha-’areẓ</i> lest he give you sacred food to eat.<sup>33</sup><i class=""footnote"">(33) Cf. Ned. 20a (Sonc. ed., p. 56).</i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.1.15,"Refrain from grumbling lest you grumble against others and be led into further sin.<sup>34</sup><i class=""footnote"">(34) Cf. below, IX, 1, p. 589.</i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.1.16,"There were seven patriarchs with whom a divine covenant was made, viz.: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, Phinehas and David. In connection with Abraham it is written, <i>In that day the Lord made a covenant with Abraham saying</i>.<sup>35</sup><i class=""footnote"">(35) Gen. 15, 18.</i> In connection with Isaac it is written, <i>But My covenant will I establish with Isaac</i>.<sup>36</sup><i class=""footnote"">(36) <i>ibid.</i> XVII, 21.</i> In connection with Jacob it is written, <i>Then will I remember My covenant with Jacob</i>.<sup>37</sup><i class=""footnote"">(37) Lev. 26, 42.</i> In connection with Moses it is written, <i>For after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel</i>.<sup>38</sup><i class=""footnote"">(38) Ex. 34, 27.</i> In connection with Aaron it is written, <i>It is an everlasting covenant of salt before the Lord</i>.<sup>39</sup><i class=""footnote"">(39) Num. 18, 19.</i> In connection with Phinehas it is written, <i>And it shall be unto him, and to his seed after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood</i>.<sup>40</sup><i class=""footnote"">(40) <i>ibid.</i> XXV, 13.</i> In connection with David it is written, <i>I have made a covenant with My chosen, I have sworn unto David My servant</i>.<sup>41</sup><i class=""footnote"">(41) Ps. 89, 4. Perhaps this passage is quoted here to teach men to emulate their special characteristics. Abraham stands as the example of hospitality, Isaac of self-sacrifice, Jacob of scholarship (cf. Gen. 25, 27, where according to Rabbinic interpretation <i>tents</i> means schools), Moses of meekness, Aaron of peace-making, Phinehas of zeal on behalf of God, and David of singing His praise.</i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.1.17,"The following seven patriarchs have gone to their eternal rest with great honour and worms and maggots had no dominion over them, viz.: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, Miriam and their father Amram.<sup>42</sup><i class=""footnote"">(42) In B.B. 17a (Sonc. ed., p. 86), ‘and Benjamin the son of Jacob’.</i> Some say: Also David, as it is stated, <i>Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth; my flesh also dwelleth in safety</i>.<sup>43</sup><i class=""footnote"">(43) Ps. 16, 9, the last words being understood as ‘unaffected by worms’.</i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.2.1,"There were nine<sup>44</sup><i class=""footnote"">(44) For the list, cf. KR III, p. 461, and notes</i> who entered the Garden of Eden alive, viz.: Enoch the son of Yered, Elijah, the Messiah, Eliezer the servant of Abraham, Hiram, king of Tyre,<sup>45</sup><i class=""footnote"">(45) It is more likely that the word <i>king</i> has crept in by mistake and the text should read ‘Hiram of Tyre’, who was of the tribe of Naphtali (1 Kings 7, 13f.).</i> Ebed-melech the Cushite, Jabeẓ the son of R. Judah the Prince, Bithiah the daughter of Pharaoh, and Seraḥ the daughter of Asher. Some say: Also R. Joshua b. Levi."
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.2.2,"Let all your undertakings be for the name of Heaven.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) Having a sincere and high purpose. ‘Heaven’ is a term for God.</i> Love Heaven and fear Heaven. Hurry to perform in gladness all the precepts."
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.2.3,"Sit before the Elders and incline your ear to hear their words. Listen carefully to the words of your fellow; be not hasty to answer but give proper thought to your words. Speak of the first [point] first and of the last [point] last, and admit the truth. Speak not before him who is greater than you in wisdom."
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.2.4,"If you desire to study,<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) H adds ‘the Torah’.</i> do not say regarding what you do not understand, ‘I understand’.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) GRA reads: ‘and if he desires to teach [you a certain subject], do not say, “I have heard it” ’.</i> If you are questioned on [even] a trivial matter and you are not acquainted with it, be not ashamed to say, ‘I do not know’. If you were taught something which you did not grasp, be not ashamed to say [to the teacher], ‘Repeat it to me’ and do not pretend to yourself ‘I understood it’."
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.2.5,"Do [good] deeds for the sake of their Maker<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) i.e. God, Who decreed them (so RN to Ned. 62a); but Baḥya ibn Paḳuda, in the Introduction to his <i>Duties of the Heart</i>, interprets, ‘for the performance of them’, i.e. doing good for its own sake and not from an interested motive.</i> and speak of them<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) viz. words of Torah.</i> for their own sake.<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) i.e. do not study in order to be called a Sage or Rabbi; cf. Ned. 62a (Sonc. ed., p. 197). So according to the emended text of GRA.</i> Make not of them a crown wherewith to adorn yourself, an axe with which to chop or a spade with which to dig.<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) Cf. Aboth IV, 7 (Sonc. ed., IV, 5, p. 46).</i> Undertake to study the Torah [even] in straitened circumstances and disregard any insult. A well-ordered [moral] stock-taking and a virtuous adolescence [yield] security and truth.<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) GRA’s emendation may mean: ‘and your security will be real’, or, ‘your promise [which you give] will be true’. An alternative rendering of V may be: ‘[If your deeds] are well considered, and you have good breeding, your promise will be trustworthy’. Cf. the reading in KR IV, 7, p. 466.</i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.2.6,"Love and honour the Torah; love righteous ways, reproofs<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) Levelled at you. Cf. <i>Reprove a wise man, and he will love thee</i> (Prov. 9, 8).</i> and uprightness. Do not run after honour; do not be presumptuous in giving decisions.
Realize that from now until tomorrow everything you have, whether it belongs to you or not, is not yours;<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) ‘Is not yours’ is added by GRA.</i> because what is yours is [in reality] not yours, so how can what is not yours be yours! Of him who regards what is not his as his own, Scripture declares, <i>Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! How long? and that ladeth himself with many pledges!</i><sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) Hab. 2, 6.</i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.2.7,"Accustom yourself to end on an auspicious note.<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">(13) i.e. if you must criticize or predict misfortune, your last words should inspire confidence and comfort. Or, ‘accustom yourself to finish anything good which you began to do’, otherwise it will be credited to him who completes it. Other possible interpretations are: ‘Accustom yourself to complete a deal with goodness’, i.e. there should be no cause for resentment by the other party; ‘Accustom yourself to end everything well’.</i> Be modest and amiable towards all, and be humble and gentle of speech. Be quick [to render service] to a superior and easy of approach to a suppliant [for your service].<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">(14) Cf. DER II, p. 540, n. 41.</i> [Be like] a good merchant<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">(15) Who can distinguish between the genuine and the spurious; so know how to react towards different types of persons.</i> and broad-shouldered.<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">(16) i.e. able to deal with all types. H reads <i>reḥab kesef</i>, ‘liberal with money’. Another interpretation is: ‘Be like a good merchant (i.e. well stocked with goods so that a customer need not be kept waiting while the required article is brought from outside), and like a carrier who can carry a big load easily’. The meaning may then be: Be well stocked and carry a heavy load of learning, so that you are ready to supply knowledge to an inquirer.</i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.2.8,"Keep aloof from anything which may bring you to sin. Recoil from [even] a minor sin that it may not lead you to a major sin. Hasten to [perform] a light precept<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">(17) Cf. Ps. 119, 60. One is more liable to be slack and procrastinating with an easy task and so forget it; to obviate this a man should hasten to perform it as soon as it presents itself.</i> and flee<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">(18) Not merely avoid, but put as long a distance as possible between yourself and transgression.</i> from even] a trivial transgression lest it will lead you to commit a grave transgression."
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.2.9,"Let the honour of your fellow be as dear to you as your own.<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">(19) Cf. Aboth II, 15 (Sonc. ed., II, 10, p. 20).</i> Show respect to all persons; say not, ‘I will flatter this man that he may give me to eat, or that he may give me to drink, or another man that he may clothe me, or yet another that he may give me shelter’.<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">(20) Cf. Beẓah 32b (Sonc. ed., p. 165): ‘He who is dependent on another’s table, the world is dark for him and his life is no life’.</i>
It is better that you be ashamed of yourself<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">(21) i.e. be the first to recognize your faults and rectify them.</i> than be put to shame by others.<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">(22) Cf. Sanh. 42a (Sonc. ed., p. 274).</i> Let not your teeth bring shame upon you,<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">(23) i.e. by spending more than you can afford on food so that you become reduced in circumstances.</i> nor your mouth bring you to abuse.<sup>24</sup><i class=""footnote"">(24) By drinking more than is good for you.</i> Let not your tongue [cause others to] curse you or your lips discredit you, and do not bow down to your words.<sup>25</sup><i class=""footnote"">(25) Do not speak in haste without premeditation so that you will not have to humble yourself by asking pardon or having to retract. Other possible interpretations are: Do not regard your words as dogmatic; or, do not be self-opinionated; or, do not be a slave to your words, i.e. refrain from making a promise. H reads <i>tishtaḥ</i>, ‘do not spread your words’, i.e. do not be verbose.</i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.2.10,"If you desire to secure your fellow’s love, concern yourself with his welfare. If you want to keep away from sin, go, reflect and consider its consequences well. Take delight in the performance of a <i>miẓwah</i>, study hard and exult in [carrying it out] in all its details.<sup>26</sup><i class=""footnote"">(26) So GRA who conjectures <i>bifraṭeha</i>, but there is no MS. confirmation for it. A suggested reading is, <i>shekan urebaẓ biftaḥeha</i>, ‘Dwell and couch at the doors of [the Academy]’; i.e. by constant study make yourself familiar with the <i>miẓwoth</i>.</i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.3.1,"If you did [someone] a great favour regard it as small, and do not say, ‘I did this good act with my own [money]’. Rather was it [from what God] had graciously given you and you should offer thanks to Heaven.<sup>27</sup><i class=""footnote"">(27) For the means with which to do good.</i> If others have done you a slight favour regard it as if it were great, and do not say, ‘The favour was done to me because of my worthy acts’, but [say, ‘In spite of] my unworthy acts a favour was done to me’, as it is stated, <i>And repayeth them that hate Him to their face, to destroy them</i>.<sup>28</sup><i class=""footnote"">(28) Deut. 7, 10. It is better not to receive the reward in this world but to store it up for the hereafter</i>
If you wronged someone slightly regard it as a great wrong and exclaim, ‘Woe is me, for I have sinned! Woe is me, because harm was done through me!’ If others did you a great wrong regard it as small and exclaim, ‘I suffered slightly; I deserved more’."
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.3.2,"Reflect before [the word] issues from your mouth. Consider your actions in accordance with good manners. Set a reward for every step you take.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) i.e. see that your steps are directed to perform deeds which deserve a reward.</i> Submit to [divine] judgment and refrain from grumbling. Judge your fellow in the scale of merit<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) Seek a favourable interpretation of his actions even though they seem suspicious. Cf. Aboth I, 6 (Sonc. ed., p. 5).</i> and do not turn the scale against him.<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) Take a charitable view of his deeds.</i> Rejoice in your lot and enjoy the little you have. Hate not him who reproves you. Your lot will always be blessed if you possess a bountiful eye<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) Well disposed, generous; cf. Prov. 22, 9.</i> and a contented soul."
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.3.3,"Accustom your tongue to say, ‘I do not know’, lest you be led to falsehood and be apprehended."
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.3.4,"If you are negligent in [the performance of] one precept you will eventually be negligent with another like it. If you belittle<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) lit. ‘speak lightly of’.</i> one precept you will eventually belittle others like it.<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) V adds in brackets ‘and you have done nothing for your trouble’ in fulfilling the precepts since you regard them of small worth.</i> If you transgress the words of the Torah intentionally, you will be made to transgress them intentionally or unintentionally.<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) Circumstances will make it impossible for you to perform the precepts even if you are desirous of making good former lapses.</i> [58<i>b</i>] If you take for yourself anything which is not yours, what is yours will be taken from you."
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.3.5,"Be careful with consecrated objects both when giving them<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) To the <i>kohen</i> or Levite; do not withhold them.</i> and when eating them.<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) They must be eaten in a state of ritual cleanliness.</i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.3.6,"Be humble and affable to all persons and particularly to the members of your household.<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) According to the text emended by GRA. V and H read: ‘Be humble and affable to return [a salutation] to your acquaintance. Be lowly of spirit with all men, with the members of your household more than with all men; and if you grumble and fight with your household, your end is for Gehinnom’.</i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.3.7,"The first stage of vowing leads to folly; the first stage of [ritual] uncleanness leads to idolatry; the first stage of levity with women leads to unchastity.<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) Cf. Ned. 20a (Sonc. ed., p. 56).</i>"
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.3.8,"If you make yourself a surety [for another] it should be with the object of paying [that surety];<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) If called upon to do so.</i> or if you become a guarantor it should be with the object of paying [the guarantee].<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">(13) Therefore do not offer to become a guarantor lightheartedly.</i> If you borrow [money] it should be with the object of repaying [the loan];<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">(14) So borrow only if you are in a position to repay.</i> and if you lend money bear in mind that you may have to claim it<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">(15) And have difficulty in collecting it.</i> and that you might [even] have to make a settlement.<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">(16) And lose part of the sum loaned. Another reading is <i>lehafsid</i>, ‘lose the sum’.</i>"

Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.3.10,"A shamefaced person is not apt to learn, nor is an impatient person fitted to teach. An ignorant person<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">(19) For this passage, cf.

Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.3.11,"Fifteen characteristics are mentioned in connection with a scholar, viz.: he is decorous in his entering and leaving,<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">(23) ‘And leaving’ is inserted by GRA.</i> modest in his sitting,<sup>24</sup><i class=""footnote"">(24) Does not rush to occupy a front seat.</i> subtle<sup>25</sup><i class=""footnote"">(25) In devising ways of manifesting his fear; cf.

Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.4.3,"He who occupies himself [only] with the study of Scripture is but of indifferent merit;<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) lit. ‘it is meritorious and not meritorious’, because the Written Torah can only be understood with the aid of the Oral Torah.</i> with Mishnah is meritorious and rewarded for it; with Talmud there can be nothing more meritorious.

Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.4.4,"Do your [teaching of] Torah gratuitously and accept no remuneration for it; because the Omnipresent gave it gratuitously<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) Cf. Ned. 36b-37a (Sonc. ed., p. 113). As Moses taught the Elders gratuitously so must they pass their teaching on to others without pay. According to the Talmud, <i>loc. cit.</i>, this does not apply to Scripture, for the teaching of which a fee is allowed.</i> and one may not take a fee for the [teaching of] words of Torah.

Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.4.7,"Suffer not your ears to listen to idle chatter, because they are burnt first of [all] the organs.<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">(18) lit. ‘of the limbs’. From hearing unworthy or idle talk he may proceed to speak unworthy or idle words and then do unworthy or idle acts. The ear is, accordingly, the first organ to ‘catch fire’; cf.

Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.4.9,"Because your eyes have not looked [enviously] on another’s wealth, they will shine amidst thick darkness and gloom, as it is stated, <i>Then shall thy light rise in darkness, and thy gloom be as the noon-day</i>.<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">(21) Isa. 58, 10.</i> Because your ears have not listened to idle chatter they will hear [words of] peace for you in [this] world and cause you to hear them in the World to Come, as it is stated, <i>And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying: ‘This is the way, walk ye in it; when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left</i>.’<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">(22) <i>ibid.</i> XXX, 21.</i> Because your mouth did not recount calumny, all your adversaries will be slain by it.<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">(23) So GRA.</i> Because your mouth occupied itself with [the teaching of] the Torah, all who are worthy of a blessing will bless themselves through it.<sup>24</sup><i class=""footnote"">(24) They will wish for no greater blessing than will come to you for what you have earned by your mouth.</i> Because you withheld your hands from plunder, what can evil persons do to you?

Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.5.2,"A scholar should not eat standing, lick his fingers or belch in the presence of his fellow. He talks little, jokes little, sleeps in moderation, is frugal in pleasures and minimizes ‘[Yes], yes’ or ‘No, no’.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) Cf. Shebu. 36a (Sonc. ed., p. 211) where the repetition of ‘yes’ and ‘no’ is regarded as an oath. It may perhaps also mean to be sparing in making promises.</i>"

Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.6.1,A man should not be awake when among those who are asleep or asleep when among those who are awake. He should not weep when among those who are joyous or be joyous when among those who weep. He should not be sitting when among those who are standing or standing when among those who are sitting. He should not study Scripture when among those who study Mishnah or study Mishnah when among those who study Scripture. This is the general rule: A man should not act differently from the practice of his fellow-men.
Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.6.2,"Four things are unbecoming to scholars.

Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta.9.13,"And so used R. Eleazar Ha-Ḳappar to say: Love peace and hate dissension.
