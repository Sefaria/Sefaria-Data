Version Notes,
"SEFER TORAH, Introduction.1","<small>THE TRACTATE</small><br/><i>Masseketh Sefer Torah</i>, 'the Tractate on the Torah Scroll', deals with the preparation, correct writing and proper handling of sacred scrolls, particularly the Pentateuch which is used for the reading of the lections in the statutory religious services in the Synagogue."
"SEFER TORAH, Introduction.2","Forming part of the collection known as <i>Massektoth Ḳeṭannoth</i>, it belongs also to the smaller collection, <i>Sheba' Massektoth Ḳeṭannoth</i>, 'The Seven Minor Tractates', which is the earliest collection of its kind in the Talmudic literature. All the seven are of great antiquity in their main contents and have their origin in the early period of oral traditions, when the writing down of such traditions was generally forbidden. Their author was a Palestinian who lived before the redaction of the Mishnah (beginning of the third century <small>C.E.</small>)."
"SEFER TORAH, Introduction.3","In the history of Rabbinic literature these tractates are of considerable importance because they represent the earliest digests dealing with a particular subject in a compact, comprehensive and detailed set of rules. Such regulations are scattered throughout the numerous pages of the Talmud, embedded in long and intricate discussions, together with material which has no direct bearing on the subject under treatment."
"SEFER TORAH, Introduction.4","Although most of the rules in this tractate are to be found in the Tannaitic teaching in the Talmudic literature—Mishnah, Baraitha, and the Palestinian and Babylonian Gemara—twelve rules occur in it which cannot be traced in those sources. These are contained in II, 9f., III, 5-9, and V, 1-3, 6, 8."
"SEFER TORAH, Introduction.5","There is a very close relationship between <i>Masseketh Sefer Torah</i> and the first five chapters of <i>Soferim</i>, the tractate on 'Scribes', and both probably assumed their present form in the Geonic period. It is also clear that the compiler of <i>Soferim</i> was acquainted with this tractate and drew largely upon it,<sup>★</sup><i class=""footnote"">★ [I. H. Weiss, <i>Dor</i> (1904), II, pp. 224f., maintains that <i>Sefer Torah</i> is an abstract from <i>Soferim</i>.]</i> but whereas <i>Sefer Torah</i> is characterized by a simple and direct style and a clear cut system of rules, <i>Soferim</i> has numerous interpolations, amplifications and much irrelevant matter. The numbering of the chapters corresponds in the two tractates so far as they overlap, but there is a difference in the length of the respective chapters, their contents, and the numeration and extent of the rules."
"SEFER TORAH, Introduction.6",<small>ANALYSIS</small>
"SEFER TORAH, Introduction.7","Chap. I prescribes the writing materials that must alone be used for sacred scrolls; the languages permitted in the originals and translations; indicates some deviations in the Septuagint from the Masoretic text; and deals also with the rules concerning the sheets, columns, and open and closed sections in the sacred scrolls."
"SEFER TORAH, Introduction.8","Chap. II indicates the spaces that must be left between letters, words, columns and books in a scroll; the number of columns in a sheet; the width and length of columns and scrolls; the size of the upper and lower margins; blank spaces at the beginnings and ends of scrolls; special arrangement of lines in certain sections; the rollers, sewing and mending; and the disposal of outworn sheets."
"SEFER TORAH, Introduction.9","Chap. III deals with the kind of books that may be written on one scroll; the extent of the spaces that must separate books of the Pentateuch and books of the Prophets respectively; which scrolls may be separated into smaller books; degrees of sanctity in the various sacred writings; palimpsests; procedure in case of scribal errors; manner of rolling and unrolling scrolls, and how many columns at a time are to be unrolled during the Scriptural reading; their reverential handling; and the respectful use of foodstuffs."
"SEFER TORAH, Introduction.10","Chap. IV lists the divine names that may not be erased, the names that are always sacred and the words with the same spelling which are secular; and prohibits the profane use of any of the sacred names."
"SEFER TORAH, Introduction.11","Chap. V discusses cases of error in the writing of divine names, concentration of thought and reverence when divine names are written; procedure when such names are written on a person's body, on an article of furniture, the horn of an animal or any other object; the writing of small scrolls for children's instruction; and the storage of disused sacred writings."
"SEFER TORAH, Introduction.12",I. W. SLOTKI.
SEFER TORAH.1.1,"<small>RULE 1</small>. It is not permitted to write a scroll of the Torah<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) The scroll of the Pentateuch used for the lections in public worship.</i> on skins of ritually unclean cattle or on skins of ritually unclean wild animals, nor may they<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) The parchment sheets of which the scroll is made up.</i> be sewn with [their] sinews or [the parchment rolls of <i>tefillin</i>] be wound with their hair. It is an oral prescription delivered to Moses at Sinai that [these] shall be written on the skins of ritually clean cattle, or on skins of ritually clean wild animals, that they shall be sewn together with ritually clean sinews, [that the <i>tefillin</i> rolls] shall be wound with ritually clean hair, and that the writing be done with ink, because [this latter requirement] has support in Scripture, <i>And I wrote them with ink in the book</i>.<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) Jer. XXXVI, 18.</i>"
SEFER TORAH.1.2,"<small>RULE 2</small>. It is permitted to write [sacred scrolls] on skins of <i>nebeloth</i> and on skins of <i>ṭerefoth</i> and there is no need to consider the possibility of their having been pierced at the animal's heart.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) It was a heathen practice to remove the heart from a live animal to offer it as a sacrifice, and this, in Rabbinic law (Mishnah 'A.Z. 29b, Sonc. ed., p. 145) rendered the entire animal, including its skin, forbidden as an idolatrous offering.</i>"
SEFER TORAH.1.3,"<small>RULE 3</small>. Skins<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) Before they were dressed; but dressed skins may be bought only from trustworthy persons who can testify that the dressing had been done in accordance with the law.</i> for the [sacred] books, <i>tefillin</i> and <i>mezuzoth</i> may be bought anywhere, and one need not consider the possibility that they might be skins that were pierced at the animal's heart."
SEFER TORAH.1.4,"<small>RULE 4</small>. The writing on <i>ḳelaf</i> must be on the side of the flesh, and on <i>gewil</i> it must be on the side of the hair; and if one changed the one for the other [the scroll] may not be used for the lection [in the statutory services]."
SEFER TORAH.1.5,"<small>RULE 5</small>. [Sacred texts]<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) Mentioned in Rule 1.</i> may not be written on <i>difthera</i>, a tablet or erased paper;<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) Others 'palimpsest'. GRA in Sof. I, 5 omits 'erased'.</i> nor with coal,<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) Or, 'black pigment'.</i> shoe-black, or ink containing gum or vitriol. Vitriol may not be added to the ink."
SEFER TORAH.1.6,"<small>RULE 6</small>. R. Jacob said in the name of R. Meir: Vitriol may be added to the ink. R. Judah said: R. Meir's statement about [writing with ink containing] vitriol applies to [the whole] Torah<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) Cf. 'Erub. 13a [Sonc. ed., p. 82).</i> except the section dealing with a suspected wife.<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) Num. V, 11ff.</i> R. Jacob retorted: [R. Meir] said, 'Except the section dealing with a suspected wife', [by which he meant that] only in the special scroll<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) A small scroll on which were written the curses that would befall an unfaithful wife.</i> which [was used] in the Temple [must the ink contain no vitriol] because [the writing] had to be blotted out.<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) Cf. Num. <i>ibid.</i> 23f.</i>"
SEFER TORAH.1.7,"<small>RULE 7</small>. R. Simeon b. Laḳish said in the name of R. Meir, who had it from R. Ishmael, that vitriol may be added to the ink."
SEFER TORAH.1.8,"<small>RULE 8</small>. [Sacred texts]<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">(13) Mentioned in Rule 1.</i> may not be written in [obsolete] Hebrew characters or in the Median, Elamitic or Greek languages.<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">(14) According to Meg. 9a (Sonc. ed., p. 48) it is permitted to write the Torah in Greek, though this is not allowed in the case of <i>tefillin</i> and <i>mezuzoth</i>.</i> Seventy Elders wrote the Torah for king Ptolemy<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">(15) Assumed to be Ptolemy Philadelphus who reigned in Egypt, 285-247 <small>B.C.E.</small>, and who arranged for the Greek Version, the Septuagint, to be made, as narrated in Sof. I, 8 (cf. the notes <i>ad loc.</i>).</i> in Greek, and that day was as ominous for Israel as the day on which the Golden Calf was made, since the Torah could not be adequately translated."
SEFER TORAH.1.9,"<small>RULE 9</small>. They [all] introduced [the same] thirteen alterations:<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">(16) For a comparison of these variants with the Heb. text, cf. on Sof. I, 8.</i> 'God created in the beginning'; 'I shall make a man in image and likeness'; 'And He finished on the sixth [day] and rested on the seventh [day]'; 'Male and female He created him'; 'Come let Me go down'; 'And Sarah laughed among her relatives, saying'; 'For in their anger they slew oxen and in their self-will they digged up a stall'; 'And Moses took his wife and his children and set them upon a carrier of men'; 'Now the time that the children of Israel dwelt in the land of Canaan and in the land of Egypt was four hundred and thirty years'; 'I have not taken one desirable thing from them'; 'And the [beast] with small legs'; 'Which the Lord thy God hath allotted unto all the peoples to give light under the whole heaven'; 'And they offer sacrifices to the sun or the moon or any of the host of heaven which I commanded should not be served'."
SEFER TORAH.1.10,"<small>RULE 10</small>. [Sacred scrolls] must not be written in gold. It is related that, in an Alexandrian scroll<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">(17) Cf. note to Sof. I, 9.</i> of the Torah, the divine names were written in gold, and when the matter came before the Sages they decided that it should be stored away.<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">(18) lit. 'it shall be hidden', i.e. not used for the lections.</i>"
SEFER TORAH.1.11,"<small>RULE 11</small>. If Hebrew words were written in Aramaic or Aramaic words in Hebrew, if <i>Ha'azinu</i> was written in continuous lines,<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">(19) Cf. Sof. I, 10, n. 44, for the correct arrangement.</i> or if the breaking up [of the lines] was not done according to the rule, the scroll may not be used for the lections."
SEFER TORAH.1.12,"<small>RULE 12</small>. If one finished [writing nearly] all the scroll [of the Torah] and less than a column of text remained, one need not hesitate to extend the writing so as to make of this a small column on its own.<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">(20) The extension of a short passage over a full column is done either by enlarging the characters or, according to others, by making each successive line shorter than the one preceding it.</i>"
SEFER TORAH.1.13,"<small>RULE 13</small>. If an open section was written as a closed one or <i>vice versa</i>, the scroll must be stored away. What is an open section? One which commences at the beginning of a line. How much space must there be at the end of a line so that the section beginning at the next line may be called an open one? A space on which may be written a name of three letters.<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">(21) The opinion of Maimonides, which has been adopted, is that space must be left for three words, each of three letters (cf. Y.D. CCLXXV, §2).</i>"
SEFER TORAH.1.14,"<small>RULE 14</small>. Should an entire section be finished at the end of a column, if one [blank] line remained and [the next] section is a closed one, [the scribe] begins it in the middle of the line; but if it is an open section, he begins at the top [of the next column] and leaves that line [blank].<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">(22) Cf. Sof. I, 14.</i>"
SEFER TORAH.2.1,"<small>RULE 1</small>. Sufficient space must be left between words<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) lit. 'between name and name'.</i> so that they may be distinguished, and between letters so that they be not mixed. If the letters were mixed up or a break made in the middle of a word, the scroll must not be used for the lection in the statutory services."
SEFER TORAH.2.2,"<small>RULE 2</small>. [It is permitted] to insert between columns two letters from a long word, but not from a short one. If, however, [the part of a longer word forms] a short word on its own,<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) e.g. in a word like <i>yimlok</i> (he will reign) the last two letters can form an independent short word <i>lak</i> (to thee).</i> it is forbidden [to insert it between the columns]."
SEFER TORAH.2.3,"<small>RULE 3</small>. In a Torah scroll the space of two finger-breadths must be left [between columns], but in scrolls of the Prophets and in those of Pentateuchs<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) Intended for ordinary reading or study, and not for the public lections.</i> a space of one thumb-breadth [only]."
SEFER TORAH.2.4,"<small>RULE 4</small>. In the lower margin of a Torah scroll the space of a handbreadth is left, and in the upper margin two-thirds of a handbreadth;<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) lit. 'two parts of a handbreadth'. This is also the reading of V and M in Sof. II, 4. According to Men. 30a (Sonc. ed., p. 195) and H in Sof. <i>loc. cit.</i> the upper margin must be three finger-breadths wide.</i> but in scrolls of the Prophets and Pentateuchs three finger-breadths in the lower margin and two finger-breadths in the upper. In all these cases<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) lit. 'here and there'.</i> if it is desired to extend [the margins] this may be done, provided they do not exceed [the space of] the written matter."
SEFER TORAH.2.5,"<small>RULE 5</small>. Between the books in a Torah scroll a vacant space of four lines must be left, and in a scroll containing the Twelve Prophets three lines."
SEFER TORAH.2.6,"At the end of a scroll and at its beginning sufficient [parchment] must be left to wind<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) Reading with many authorities <i>lehaḳḳif</i>. V reads <i>lehaḳim</i> 'to raise up'.</i> [it round the scroll]. In a Torah scroll no limit has been prescribed, but a roller should be attached at the end of the scroll and there is no need to do this at its beginning.<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) This regulation does not agree with Sof. II, 5.</i>"
SEFER TORAH.2.7,"<small>RULE 6</small>. A sheet of a Torah scroll must contain not less than three columns and not more than eight. In the case of <i>ḳelaf</i> parchments no limit was prescribed, [62<i>b</i>] and one may add [as many columns] as desired provided only there are not less than three columns [to the sheet]."
SEFER TORAH.2.8,"<small>RULE 7</small>. If one finished [writing nearly] all the book<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) This refers either to one book of the Prophets or to several of them written in one scroll.</i> and one column of text remained, one need not hesitate to make of it a separate small sheet."
SEFER TORAH.2.9,"<small>RULE 8</small>. If a sheet [of a Torah scroll] is worn out, one may not remove two [columns only] and replace them by two new columns; but three columns should be removed and replaced by three new ones, and the new columns must be written in the same size as the original script."
SEFER TORAH.2.10,"<small>RULE 9</small>. The width of a column [in a Torah scroll] must be such as to be recognizable at one glance,<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) Accordingly, not more than three Hebrew words, each of ten letters, may be written in a line. If the column is wider, the reader experiences difficulty in passing from line to line.</i> and in a small scroll not less than a handbreadth. R. Jose b. Judah says: It must not be less than the width of three fingers."
SEFER TORAH.2.11,"<small>RULE 10</small>. The height<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) lit. 'length'.</i> of [a scroll] must not be greater than its circumference,<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) When rolled up, so according to B.B. 14a (Sonc. ed., p. 67); lit. 'its width'.</i> nor its circumference greater than its height, but they must be exactly alike,<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) lit. 'takes the middle course'.</i> and this is the most correct procedure."
SEFER TORAH.2.12,"<small>RULE 11</small>. A Torah scroll may not consist half of <i>gewil</i> [and half of <i>ḳelaf</i>, but it may consist half of <i>gewil</i>]<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">(13) The words of this Rule enclosed within square brackets are added from Sof. II, 10, <i>q.v.</i> If 'although' is altered to 'because', the text will make sense but will be contrary to the Rule in Sof. <i>loc. cit.</i></i> and half [of the <i>ḳelaf</i>] of deers, although this is not the best procedure."
SEFER TORAH.2.13,"<small>RULE 12</small>. [A tear in a Torah parchment sheet] may not be joined with glue, nor is it permitted to write on a patch, nor may [the sheets] be sewn together on the written side. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said in the name of R. Meir: [A torn sheet] may be joined with glue and it is permitted to write on a patch, but it is forbidden to do the sewing<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">(14) So according to GRA, H and M in Sof. II, 11. V reads here as in Sof. 'the writing'.</i> on the written side. If a scroll<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">(15) Other than a Torah scroll.</i> is torn, a patch may be placed on the outside."
SEFER TORAH.3.1,"<small>RULE 1</small>. It is permissible to join the Torah and the Prophets in one scroll, according to R. Judah; but the Sages say: The Torah and the Prophets must be written in separate scrolls.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) According to GRA (in Sof. III, 1) who adopted the reading of B.B. 13b (Sonc. ed., p. 66): 'it is permissible to fasten the Torah, the Prophets and the Hagiographa together (in one scroll)'.</i>"
SEFER TORAH.3.2,"<small>RULE 2</small>. Between a book of the Prophets and another one should not leave the same [empty space] as between two books of the Torah; but in each case the space must be that which has been prescribed for it.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) i.e. four lines between books of the Torah and three between the books of the Prophets.</i> Furthermore [a book of the Prophets]<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) If the preceding book ended at the foot of a column.</i> must begin at the top.<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) Of the next column, the reason being that, if the books of the Prophets were separated one from the other, the beginning of each book would commence at the top of a column. This does not apply to Torah scrolls, which may never be cut up into separate books.</i>"
SEFER TORAH.3.3,"<small>RULE 3</small>. A Torah scroll<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) Which contains all the five books of Moses.</i> may not be made into [separate] books of the Pentateuch, because it is forbidden to reduce a major sanctity<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) The Torah scroll in its entirety.</i> to a minor sanctity.<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) A section of the Pentateuch.</i> From scrolls containing sections of the Pentateuch, however, it is permitted to make up a Torah scroll. When may this be done? When the measurements<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) Of all the scrolls that are to be joined together.</i> and the number of the lines<sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) In each column.</i> are alike."
SEFER TORAH.3.4,"It is not permissible to join together two sections of the Pentateuch or one and a half of them to form a single scroll.<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) Since it might be mistaken for a proper Torah scroll.</i> But if it was intended<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) When these were written.</i> that additional scrolls be attached to them,<sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) To complete a full Torah scroll.</i> it is permissible."
SEFER TORAH.3.5,"<small>RULE 4</small>. If a Torah scroll has spaces or stops [to mark] the beginning of verses, it may not be used for the lections.<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">(13) Because all proper Torah scrolls must conform to the original without any deviations.</i> [Similarly] if a letter has been engraved or joined to another, the scroll may not be used for the lections."
SEFER TORAH.3.6,"<small>RULE 5</small>. A scroll [some of whose letters] are faded may not be used for the public lections.<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">(14) So H and GRA in Sof. III, 8. V reads 'one shall not rewrite [the letters] in it'.</i> R. Simeon b. Eleazar says: If the outline [of the effaced letters] is distinguishable, it is permitted [to rewrite them]."
SEFER TORAH.3.7,"<small>RULE 6</small>. A scroll of the Torah in which a whole line<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">(15) This is the reading in Sof. III, 9. V reads here 'one letter'.</i> is faded may not be used. If the greater part of a line is faded and the smaller part intact, the use of the scroll is permitted."
SEFER TORAH.3.8,"<small>RULE 7</small>. Not more than four<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">(16) And not less than three (cf. Sof. III, 10).</i> columns of the Torah scroll may be unrolled [at one time during the reading of the lection] but there is no objection to the reading of ten [columns] in one [lection]."
SEFER TORAH.3.9,"<small>RULE 8</small>. A scribe may not put upon the written part [of a Torah scroll] a reed-pen with ink on it;<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">(17) So according to Sof. III, 11. The text in V is meaningless.</i> nor may he take hold of the sheets of parchment and thereby unroll [the scroll]; nor may he<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">(18) This is the reading in Sof. III, 11. V reads 'but he should'.</i> grasp the parchments to extract the written sheets;<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">(19) Which are rolled up; lit. 'and bring forth the writing without'.</i> nor may he remove a scroll from its [case] by shaking it out. All these [restrictions], however, are relaxed in the case of official revisers of Scriptural scrolls."
SEFER TORAH.3.10,"<small>RULE 9</small>. It is not permissible to place a Torah scroll on a chair and to lean on it with one's elbows while reading; so according to R. Nehemiah. It is not permissible to place it over a chair [with its sheets] hanging down while it is read in the manner of ordinary documents, because [sacred] books must not be treated with disrespect."
SEFER TORAH.3.11,"<small>RULE 10</small>. A Torah scroll may not be placed on a bed and [certainly]<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">(20) Cf. N.Y. on Sof. III, 13. The insertion of 'certainly' avoids an anticlimax.</i> not at its foot or under it; nor may one sit<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">(21) lit. 'that one may sit'.</i> on a bed while a [Torah] scroll rests on it. It is related that R. Eliezer<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">(22) In Sof. III, 13, 'R. Eleazar'.</i> once sat [unknowingly] on a bed on which a [Torah] scroll lay, and [when he realized it] he jumped up as if a snake had bitten him. [Such respect is shown for the Torah] because Scripture declares, <i>Ye shall eep My sabbaths, and reverence My sanctuary</i><sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">(23) Lev. XIX, 30.</i>—it is not the Sabbaths that one reverences but Him Who commanded [to observe them], for Scripture declares, <i>This is my God, and I will glorify Him</i><sup>24</sup><i class=""footnote"">(24) Ex. XV, 2.</i> [which means,]<sup>25</sup><i class=""footnote"">(25) Connecting <i>we'anwehu</i> (<i>I will glorify Him</i>) homiletically with <i>na'eh</i> (beautiful) and understanding it as 'I will serve Him in a beautiful manner'.</i> I will perform the commandment in a beautiful way to His glory.<sup>26</sup><i class=""footnote"">(26) lit. 'before Him'.</i> Such is the interpretation of R. Ishmael. R. 'Aḳiba expounds it: I will expatiate on His excellencies.<sup>27</sup><i class=""footnote"">(27) Heb. <i>na'oth</i>, lit. 'beauties', excellent attributes.</i> Abba Saul explains it: I will be like Him,<sup>28</sup><i class=""footnote"">(28) He explains <i>we'anwehu</i> as the equivalent of <i>'ani wahu</i> (I and He).</i> i.e. as He is gracious and merciful so be thou gracious and merciful."
SEFER TORAH.3.12,"<small>RULE 11</small>. Foodstuffs may not be treated with disrespect. One may not sit on a basket containing dates or dried figs;<sup>29</sup><i class=""footnote"">(29) Because they might be crushed and spoilt.</i> but he may sit on a basket that contains pulse and also on a cake of pressed figs, because it is customary to do so in such cases.<sup>30</sup><i class=""footnote"">(30) Pulse and dried figs are not spoilt by sitting on them.</i>"
SEFER TORAH.3.13,"<small>RULE 12</small>. Foodstuffs may not be used as a covering. R. Meir says: Any fruit which has a husk may be [used as a covering]. R. Judah says: Any fruit which has a stem or a stalk<sup>31</sup><i class=""footnote"">(31) Whereby it can be lifted if it should happen to fall into the contents of the vessel it covered.</i> may be [used as a covering].<sup>32</sup><i class=""footnote"">(32) Since it would not be necessary to throw it away after use.</i> Foodstuffs may not be eaten with the aid of foodstuffs<sup>33</sup><i class=""footnote"">(33) Using them, e.g., in place of a spoon.</i> unless they are consumed simultaneously.<sup>34</sup><i class=""footnote"">(34) And would not be thrown away.</i>"
SEFER TORAH.4.1,"<small>RULE 1</small>. The following divine names may not be erased, viz.<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) lit. 'he who writes'.</i> <i>Alef-lamed-he-yod-mem</i>,<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) Meaning 'God'.</i> <i>Alef-daleth-nun-yod</i>,<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) Translated 'Lord'.</i> <i>Yod-he-waw-he</i>,<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) Composing the Tetragrammaton.</i> <i>Shaddai</i>,<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) i.e. 'Almighty'.</i> <i>Ẓeba'oth</i>,<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) Meaning '[Lord of] hosts'.</i> <i>'Eheyeh-'asher-'eheyeh</i>.<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) <i>I am that I am</i> (Ex. III, 14).</i> R. Jose says: <i>Ẓeba'oth</i> is generally treated as a secular noun.<sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) Which may therefore be erased.</i>"
SEFER TORAH.4.2,"<small>RULE 2</small>. If one writes <i>'El</i><sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) It can mean 'to' or 'God' so far as the consonants are concerned.</i> it may be erased;<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) It is presumed to be the preposition 'to'. This Rule is omitted in Sof. IV, 2.</i> if <i>'El</i> of <i>Alef-lamed-he-yod-mem</i> or <i>Yod-he</i> of the four letters [of the Tetragrammaton],<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) Which are <i>Yod-he-waw-he</i>.</i> they may not be erased, because there are divine names corresponding to them."
SEFER TORAH.4.3,<small>RULE 3</small>. All prefixes or suffixes connected with a divine name may be erased.

In <i>Lord of lords</i>,<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">(16) <i>ibid.</i></i> the first is sacred and the second secular. In <i>the God of Abraham</i><sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">(17) Gen.

SEFER TORAH.4.6,"<small>RULE 6</small>. All nouns in the Torah [signifying God] that are mentioned in connection with Abraham are sacred except the first.<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">(23) The verse, <i>And he said: My lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight</i> (Gen.

All names in the Torah mentioned in connection with Lot are secular<sup>25</sup><i class=""footnote"">(25) There is only one secular name in the Lot passages, and the Tetragrammaton occurs twice.

Lot's address to the angels is understood as ending at <i>not so</i>, and his petition to God then begins, <i>My Lord, behold</i>, etc. [So the Targum and Shebu. 35b, Sonc. ed., pp. 205f.]</i> [All names] in the story of Micah<sup>27</sup><i class=""footnote"">(27) Judg.

SEFER TORAH.4.8,"<small>RULE 8</small>. In <i>God standeth in the congregation of God, in the midst of the judges</i><sup>31</sup><i class=""footnote"">(31) The Heb. has the consonants of the divine name.</i> <i>He judges</i>,<sup>32</sup><i class=""footnote"">(32) Ps.

In <i>Forbear thee from meddling with God, Who is with me</i>,<sup>42</sup><i class=""footnote"">(42) <i>ibid.</i></i> the name is sacred, according to the view of R. Jose b. Judah. In <i>O God, the proud are risen up against me</i>,<sup>43</sup><i class=""footnote"">(43) Ps. LXXXVI, 14.</i> the name is sacred but the reader must pause in his reading [after <i>God</i>].<sup>44</sup><i class=""footnote"">(44) In the absence of the pause, the adjective <i>proud</i> might erroneously be taken as qualifying God.</i>"
SEFER TORAH.5.1,"<small>RULE 1</small>. If [a scribe] wrote a sacred name twice,<sup>1</sup><i class=""footnote"">(1) lit. 'he who writes two sacred names'.</i> he retains the first and erases the latter.<sup>2</sup><i class=""footnote"">(2) The first is retained because it was properly written; the second is erased because it was written in error.</i> R. Judah says: If the latter occurred at the end of a column, he erases the first and retains the latter.<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">(3) [In Sof. V, 1, the reading is: 'R. Judah says: If the first occurs at the end of a column'. Here H reads: 'If the latter occurs at the beginning of a column'. Either of these must be substituted for V because the idea is that] it spoils the appearance to leave a blank space at the beginning of the top line of a column.</i>"
SEFER TORAH.5.2,"<small>RULE 2</small>. If [the scribe wrote] a secular noun twice,<sup>4</sup><i class=""footnote"">(4) lit. 'two secular names'.</i> he retains the first and wipes away the latter.<sup>5</sup><i class=""footnote"">(5) While the ink is still wet.</i> R. Judah says: If the latter was at the top of a column,<sup>6</sup><i class=""footnote"">(6) [Cf. Sof. V, 2, n. 6.]</i> he wipes away the first and retains the latter."
SEFER TORAH.5.3,"<small>RULE 3</small>. If a scribe writes <i>Yehudah</i> and omits the <i>daleth</i> he inserts it above the line. If he intended to write the Tetragrammaton<sup>7</sup><i class=""footnote"">(7) The four-lettered name <i>Yod-he-waw-he</i>. Lit. 'the name, he wrote the name', apparently a misprint.</i> and wrote <i>Yehudah</i><sup>8</sup><i class=""footnote"">(8) <i>Yod-he-waw-daleth-he</i>.</i> instead, he alters the <i>daleth</i> to <i>he</i><sup>9</sup><i class=""footnote"">(9) This is done by adding a short vertical line to the <i>daleth</i>.</i> and wipes away the final letter <i>he</i>."
SEFER TORAH.5.4,"<small>RULE 4</small>. If it was required to write <i>Yehudah</i> but [the scribe] intended to write the Tetragrammaton, although he [inadvertently] inserted the <i>daleth</i>,<sup>10</sup><i class=""footnote"">(10) Thus writing the noun correctly but without intention.</i> he erases it and writes another <i>Yehudah</i>.<sup>11</sup><i class=""footnote"">(11) Because the writing must be both intentional and correct.</i>"
SEFER TORAH.5.5,"<small>RULE 5</small>. If it was required to write the Tetragrammaton but [the scribe] intended to write <i>Yehudah</i>, although he inserted the <i>daleth</i><sup>12</sup><i class=""footnote"">(12) So that <i>Yehudah</i> was not only intended but also written correctly, in the wrong place. [Cf. the variant reading in Sof. V, 3.]</i> he wipes away the final <i>he</i> and alters [the preceding] <i>daleth</i> into <i>he</i>.<sup>13</sup><i class=""footnote"">(13) The letters being almost the same and the alteration so slight, the Tetragrammaton is deemed to have been written intentionally and correctly.</i> R. Judah says: He should [also] go over the entire name with the reed-pen and so sanctify it. The Sages said to him: This is not the best procedure."
SEFER TORAH.5.6,"<small>RULE 6</small>. If in writing the Tetragrammaton he made an error [by omitting] one letter he should suspend it above [the line]. If one erred [by omitting] all the name<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">(14) The Tetragrammaton.</i> he should suspend it between the lines. So R. Judah; R. Jose says: [The scribe] wipes away the letters preceding it, writes the Tetragrammaton [in their place] and suspends [above the line] the part which he had wiped away. R. Hananiah b. 'Aḳashia says: All the sheet must be stored away."
SEFER TORAH.5.7,"<small>RULE 7</small>. If one wrote <i>Alef-lamed</i> by mistake three<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">(15) So GRA in Sof. V, 5. V reads 'twice'.</i> times in the clause <i>God delivereth me to the ungodly</i>,<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">(16) Job XVI, 11. The Biblical text has the word twice, the first being the name of God and the second the preposition, and inadvertently one wrote it three times, intending the first two to stand for 'God' (so sanctifying both) and the third for the preposition.</i> one retains<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">(17) This is the reading in Sof. V, 5. V has 'wipes away'.</i> the first and erases<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">(18) So GRA in Sof. V, 5. V has 'retains'.</i> the latter.<sup>19</sup><i class=""footnote"">(19) The second <i>'el</i> which, having been intended in error to stand for the divine name, is treated in accordance with Rule 1 above. By quoting an illustration from Job, the inference to be drawn is that the regulation with respect to a Torah scroll holds good also of the Prophets and the Hagiographa.</i>"
SEFER TORAH.5.8,"<small>RULE 8</small>. When one is writing the Tetragrammaton, one may not respond even if the king greets him;<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">(20) All one's attention must be concentrated on the writing of the divine name.</i> but if one was about to write two or three divine names successively<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">(21) e.g. <i>The Lord, the Lord, God</i> (Ex. XXXIV, 6) or Deut. VI, 4.</i> one may pause between them and respond."
SEFER TORAH.5.9,"<small>RULE 9</small>. After dipping<sup>22</sup><i class=""footnote"">(22) lit. 'he who dips'.</i> the reed-pen [in ink], one may not start with a letter<sup>23</sup><i class=""footnote"">(23) The text has <i>me'otho</i>, lit. 'from it'. A better reading, omitting the last <i>waw</i> would be <i>me'oth</i>, 'from a letter of'.</i> of the divine name<sup>24</sup><i class=""footnote"">(24) Because a pen full of ink may cause a blot.</i> but with a letter of<sup>25</sup><i class=""footnote"">(25) Reading again <i>me'oth</i>.</i> the preceding word."
SEFER TORAH.5.10,"<small>RULE 10</small>. One who wipes away<sup>26</sup><i class=""footnote"">(26) In Sof. V, 6, 'erases'.</i> a single letter of a divine name transgresses a negative commandment. R. Ishmael<sup>27</sup><i class=""footnote"">(27) 'R. Simeon' in Sof. <i>loc. cit.</i></i> says: On account of this it is stated, <i>Ye shall destroy their name out of that place;</i><sup>28</sup><i class=""footnote"">(28) Deut. XII, 3.</i> and it is also stated, <i>Ye shall not do so unto the Lord your God</i>.<sup>29</sup><i class=""footnote"">(29) <i>ibid.</i> 4; i.e. the name of God must never be erased.</i> It is permissible, however, to wipe away ink that dropped on the writing,<sup>30</sup><i class=""footnote"">(30) Even of a divine name.</i> since one's intention is only to rectify it."
SEFER TORAH.5.11,"<small>RULE 11</small>. It is not permissible to make a scroll [of the <i>Shema'</i>]<sup>31</sup><i class=""footnote"">(31) So Sof. V, 9; lacking in V here.</i> or of the <i>Hallel</i> for children.<sup>32</sup><i class=""footnote"">(32) Extracts from the Scriptures may not be written on scrolls intended for children's instruction.</i> R. Judah permits [the writing of a scroll] from <i>In the beginning</i><sup>33</sup><i class=""footnote"">(33) Gen. I, 1.</i> to the story of the Flood,<sup>34</sup><i class=""footnote"">(34) <i>ibid.</i> VI, 8.</i> and from the beginning of Leviticus to <i>And it came to pass on the eighth day;</i><sup>35</sup><i class=""footnote"">(35) Lev. IX, 1.</i> but [in the case of] all the other books [of Scripture the writing of extracts is] forbidden.<sup>36</sup><i class=""footnote"">(36) Only in the case of the Pentateuch were the two extracts mentioned allowed to be written for the instruction of children.</i> If, however, one intends to add to them,<sup>37</sup><i class=""footnote"">(37) To complete all the book.</i> it is permissible [to write extracts from the Scriptures in scrolls]."
SEFER TORAH.5.12,"<small>RULE 12</small>. The following names are to be divided:<sup>38</sup><i class=""footnote"">(38) Although each represents one name it is to be written as two words.</i> <i>Beth-'el</i>,<sup>39</sup><i class=""footnote"">(39) e.g. Gen.

XI, 10).</i> <i>ḥarah 'appi</i>.<sup>45</sup><i class=""footnote"">(45) lit. 'My anger was kindled' (cf. Ex. XXII, 23).</i> R. Jose says: These must not be divided. All agree that there must be no breaking up of <i>'Ammiel</i>,<sup>46</sup><i class=""footnote"">(46) A name meaning 'God is with me' (e.g. Num. XIII, 12).</i> <i>'Amminadab</i>,<sup>47</sup><i class=""footnote"">(47) Meaning 'my kinsman is noble' (e.g. <i>ibid.</i> 23).</i> <i>Ẓuri'el</i>,<sup>48</sup><i class=""footnote"">(48) The name means 'my rock is God' (cf. <i>ibid.</i> III, 35).</i> <i>Ẓurishaddai</i>.<sup>49</sup><i class=""footnote"">(49) A name meaning 'my rock is Shaddai' (e.g. <i>ibid.</i> I, 6).</i>"
SEFER TORAH.5.13,"<small>RULE 13</small>. If a person writes a divine name on his body, he must neither bathe nor anoint himself.<sup>50</sup><i class=""footnote"">(50) So that the name may not be washed off.</i> R. Jose says: This is permitted provided only that he does not rub it off. [If he wrote it] on the horn of a cow or on the legs of a bed,<sup>51</sup><i class=""footnote"">(51) For magical purposes.</i> he scrapes it off<sup>52</sup><i class=""footnote"">(52) [Perhaps the reading should be <i>godedo</i>, 'he chops it off' (the horn or the leg) for <i>goreron</i>, 'he scrapes them off'</i> and stores it away.<sup>53</sup><i class=""footnote"">(53) Out of respect for the divine name. The text has 'scrapes them … stores them'.</i> [If he wrote it] on a stone, he detaches it and stores it away."
SEFER TORAH.5.14,"<small>RULE 14</small>. Should one cut off a strip of a scroll,<sup>54</sup><i class=""footnote"">(54) lit. 'in scrolls'.</i> it may [be used for ordinary purposes] if it is a new one,<sup>55</sup><i class=""footnote"">(55) Being new, the scroll had not yet been consecrated.</i> but if it is an old scroll<sup>56</sup><i class=""footnote"">(56) Which has been consecrated for holy use.</i> [the use of the strip] is forbidden. As regards worn-out scrolls, phylacteries and wraps of scrolls, these must be stored away.<sup>57</sup><i class=""footnote"">(57) Having been once consecrated they may no longer be used for ordinary purposes.</i> They should not be deposited [in an unclean place]<sup>58</sup><i class=""footnote"">(58) The words in brackets are added in H.</i> but in a deserted spot where they decay naturally.<sup>59</sup><i class=""footnote"">(59) lit.
