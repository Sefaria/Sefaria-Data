Version Notes,
"Introduction, Foreword by the Chief Rabbi.1","It gives me great pleasure to write a brief Foreword to the first complete English translation of the <i>Massektoth Ḳeṭannoth</i>. These volumes further illustrate the notable contribution made by Anglo-Jewish scholars in the very difficult field of rendering into accurate, readable and intelligible English the great classics of Judaism. The Soncino Press, in the spirit of its founder, has displayed a characteristic courage in adding yet another important Rabbinic work to the row of publications which have brought it renown and gratitude on the part of scholars and students of Jewish literature throughout the world."
"Introduction, Foreword by the Chief Rabbi.2","As can be seen both from the translation of the several Tractates, Introduction and Notes, the distinguished Editor and his collaborators have taken account of the research of scholars in dealing with the many problems associated with the text and dating of some of the tractates. The study of the context of these volumes must increase the student’s appreciation of the variety and wealth of Israel’s spiritual and ethical treasures."

"Introduction, Preface.1","In many editions of the Babylonian Talmud, at the end of the fourth Order, <i>Seder Neziḳin</i>, a series of Rabbinic works is included under the heading <i>Massekoth Ḳeṭannoth</i>, ‘Minor Tractates’. The number varies but the fullest collection is provided in the Wilna-Romm edition where the total is fifteen. The title is not appropriate to all of them, because <i>’Aboth d’Rabbi Nathan, Soferim, Semaḥoth</i> and <i>Kallah Rabbathi</i> are of considerable extent and the name has been attached to many more tractates than were originally intended."
"Introduction, Preface.2","Only seven appear to have formed the first collection of ‘Minor Tractates’. The earliest mention of it which has so far been discovered is in a reference to <i>Masseketh Ẓiẓith</i> to be found in a work entitled <i>Torath ’Adam</i> by Naḥmanides (13th century) who speaks of <i>Sheba‘ Massekoth Ḳeṭannoth</i>, ‘Seven Minor Tractates’. A manuscript of them in the possession of the French scholar, Eliakim Carmoly, was edited by Raphael Kirchheim in 1851 under the title <i>Septem Libri Talmudici Parvi Hiersolymitani</i>, and consists of <i>Sefer Torah, Mezuzah, Tefillin, Ẓiẓith</i> (all published by him for the first time), <i>‘Abadim, Kuthim</i> and <i>Gerim</i>. L. Zunz, <i>Die Gottesdienstlichen Vorträge der Juden</i>, 1892, p. 93, gives a different enumeration, viz. <i>Dereḳ ’Ereẓ</i> (<i>Rabbah</i> and <i>Zuṭa</i>), <i>Soferim, Kallah, Semaḥoth, Ẓiẓith, Gerim</i> and <i>Kuthim</i>. He adds a tractate <i>Hilchoth ’Ereẓ Yisrael</i>."
"Introduction, Preface.3","All the fifteen tractates which are here presented in their entirety for the first time in translation may be regarded as an apocrypha to the Talmud. H. L. Strack, <i>Introduction to the Talmud and Midrash</i>, 1931, p. 73, calls them ‘Extra-canonical Tractates’, and the question arises whether they were excluded because they were not in existence when the Babylonian Talmud was ‘closed’ at the end of the fifth century or, as others hold, for the reason that they belong to the Tannaitic period and, like other <i>halakic</i> compendia, were superseded by the Mishnah of Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi."
"Introduction, Preface.4","Apart from <i>’Aboth d’Rabbi Nathan</i>, which is an elaboration of <i>Pirḳe ’Aboth</i>, and <i>Kallah Rabbathi</i>, which is a Gemara on <i>Kallah</i>, the Minor Tractates are described by Zunz as ‘Baraithoth in the form and style of the Tosefta’, which means that the presentation of the material is archaic in form and style. References are met with in the Midrash and Talmud which seem to indicate that digests of certain <i>halakic</i> rulings existed then which correspond to some of the Minor Tractates."
"Introduction, Preface.5","The most striking occurs in the Midrash to Eccles. 5, 8 on the text which is rendered, <i>Moreover, the profit of the earth is in all things</i>, and reads as follows: ‘Those subjects which you deem additional to the Torah—e.g. the addenda of the School of Rabbi [Judah ha-Nasi] and of R. Nathan, <i>halakoth</i> concerning proselytes (cf. also Midrash to Ruth 1, 19, Sonc. ed., p. 35) and slaves—they too were given to Moses on Sinai, and like the laws of <i>Ẓiẓith, Tefillin</i> and <i>Mezuzah</i> are an integral part of the Torah’ (Sonc. ed., p. 138). The present writer makes the comment <i>ad loc.:</i> ‘i.e. additions to the Mishnah (the so-called Baraithoth), <i>’Aboth d’Rabbi Nathan</i> and the tractates on Proselytes and Slaves, which were added to the official Mishnah; similarly the post-Talmudic tractates on <i>Ẓiẓith</i>, etc., which he goes on to mention. The reference can hardly be to the actual laws of these subjects, as there would be no point in mentioning that these are not superfluous, for it is obvious’."
"Introduction, Preface.6","If the interpretation is correct, the passage affords strong evidence of the existence of some of these tractates. Unfortunately the teaching is anonymous and the Midrash to Ecclesiastes is itself later; so no conclusion can be drawn from it as to their date. We are on firmer ground with respect to the tractate <i>Semaḥoth</i>, because its existence in the Talmudic period is attested by the Talmud itself. It is quoted under its alternative title, <i>’Ebel Rabbathi</i>, in M.Ḳ. 24a, 26b (Sonc. ed., pp. 148 and 172) and Keth. 28a (Sonc. ed., p. 153). The Rabbis who refer to it are Rafram b. Papa, Papa and Naḥman, who all lived in the fourth century."
"Introduction, Preface.7","Mention is also made of ‘the tractate <i>Kallah</i>’ in Shab. 114a (Sonc. ed., p. 558) by R. Joḥanan (3rd century), in Ta‘an 10b (Sonc. ed., p. 45) and Ḳid. 49b (Sonc. ed., p. 247), but its meaning is disputed. While Rashi explains it as one of the tractates which are rarely studied, others connect <i>Kallah</i> with the Babylonian assemblies twice a year for the study of the laws of the Jewish Festivals. In view of this uncertainty no sure deduction can be drawn from these passages."
"Introduction, Preface.8","The Palestinian Talmud (Shab. VI, 2, 8a end) quotes a ruling on the correct order of putting on and taking off one’s shoes from ‘<i>Dereḳ ’Ereẓ</i>’; and the Babylonian Talmud (Ber. 22a, Sonc. ed., p. 131) has an allusion by R. Judah (2nd century) to ‘the <i>halakoth</i> of <i>Dereḳ ’Ereẓ</i>’. What is intended is the tractate <i>Dereḳ ’Ereẓ Rabbah</i> which most authorities hold to be an early production; whereas <i>Dereḳ ’Ereẓ Zuṭa</i> is in all probability a much later work (cf. J.E. IV, p. 529)."
"Introduction, Preface.9","While the available data may not be conclusive, they are sufficient to make it hazardous to maintain dogmatically that a pre-Gaonic date for any of the tractates must be ruled out. It is known that collections of <i>halakoth</i> decisions were made by several Tannaïm before the Mishnah of Rabbi Judah ha-Nasi was accepted as the authoritative standard. Consequently the compilation of <i>halakic</i> manuals on various subjects in Talmudic times is not inherently impossible. Higger, in the Introduction to his edition of <i>The Seven Minor Tractates</i>, judges them to be ‘the first post-Mishnaic compendia regulating specific Jewish practices and usages’. His opinion is that ‘most of the Minor Tractates are Palestinian in origin, but were later modified or elaborated in Babylonia’."
"Introduction, Preface.10","A contrary view is held by such scholars as I. H. Weiss, <i>Dor Dor weDoreshaw</i>, 1904, II, pp. 216ff, and L. Ginzberg, J.E. VII, p. 640; <i>On Jewish Law and Lore</i>, 1955, pp. 166f. The latter contends: ‘Among the products of the codifiers of the Gaonic period should be reckoned the seven small treatises, in the style of the Mishnah…. The only probable sources for these treatises are the Talmud and the <i>halakic</i> midrashim. The small amount of new material which they contain is not to be traced to old, lost sources, but is the work of the compiler or compilers, whose authority prominent rabbis did not rate very highly. Toward the end of the period of the Gaonim, it is probable that codifications, now entirely lost, were made of different branches of the ritual as well as of the juridical law’. Hence he regards the seven tractates as codes produced in that era which, unlike others, survived."
"Introduction, Preface.11",The translators in this volume incline to the opinion of Higger that in their original form many of the tractates belong to a comparatively early date and were subsequently revised.

"Introduction, Preface.13","In undertaking the translation, my collaborators were faced with a difficult task. The Wilna-Romm edition has been selected as the basic text because of its availability, but it is unreliable and often in a corrupt condition. Wherever possible the invaluable notes and emendations of the Wilna Gaon were utilised, as were the editions of Schechter, Müller and Higger. Passages in one tractate not infrequently reappear in other tractates; but no attempt has been made to obtain strict uniformity in translation or even interpretation, and each translator has been allowed to give his own version. Cross-references usually indicate where the difference is material."
"Introduction, Preface.14","Biblical quotations are taken from the American-Jewish Translation with its arrangement of chapter and verse, and when a deviation is required by the Rabbinic interpretation it is noted in the Commentary. To all citations from the Babylonian Talmud and Midrash Rabbah I have added the location in the English versions published by the Soncino Press. Editorial additions to Introductions and Commentary are enclosed within square brackets."
"Introduction, Preface.15","I have, in conclusion, to thank the scholars who co-operated with me in the production of this work. The devotion with which they discharged their laborious task is deeply appreciated."

"Introduction, Preface.17","The typescript of this work was in the hands of the Publishers when the untimely death of Mr. H. Vezey Strong caused its suspension. My long association with him in connection with the Soncino Press entitles me to acknowledge the great debt which Anglo-Jewry owes to the enthusiasm and expert knowledge of typography which he devoted to the works issued by that publishing house. On the death of its Founder, Mr. Jack Davidson, he resolved that the high traditions of the Soncino Press should not suffer by the passing of his colleague."
"Introduction, Preface.18",One consequence of the delay in publication was the appearance of J. Goldin’s translation of ‘The Fathers according to Rabbi Nathan’ in the Yale Judaica Series before the version in this collection. The student of the Tractate may find it an advantage to have two independent renderings before him for consultation.

"Introduction, Publishers’ Note.1","The Publishers express their gratitude to the Rev. Dr. I. W. Slotki, M.B.E., M.A., Litt.D., F.R.S.L., who agreed to undertake the preparation of the Indices although under great pressure from his many other activities."
"Introduction, Publishers’ Note.2","As a further aid to reference, the pagination according to the Wilna-Romm edition has been indicated both <i>recto a</i> and <i>verso b</i>."
