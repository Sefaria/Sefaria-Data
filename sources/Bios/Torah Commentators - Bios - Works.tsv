Genesis	N/A	The first book of the Torah is called Bereshith (Genesis) and contains only three laws. It traces the primeval history of the world starting with the creation of the world, Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, Cain and Abel and Noah and the flood. Afterwards the focus shifts to the history of the Children of Israel covering the three patriarchs; Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and the four matriarchs; Sarah, Rebekah, Leah and Rachel. It concludes with the rivalry between Jacob's ten sons and his favoured son Joseph.		-900	500	Sinai/Canaan	1488	Soncino	Biblical	Bereshit,Gen,Gen.,Breishit,Ber,Bereishit,Ber.	בראשית		Tanach,Torah
Exodus	N/A	The second book of the Torah is called Shemot (Exodus) and covers Moses’ childhood in Egypt and God’s appearance to him in a burning bush. Moses is commanded to redeem the Children of Israel from slavery in Egypt but Pharoah refuses. Following the ten plagues and the crossing of the Red Sea, Moses leads the people to Mt. Sinai where they receive God’s Torah (Law) and Berit (Covenant). Immediately afterwards the people violate this Berit (Covenant) by creating and worshipping a Golden Calf. The book also includes the instructions for building the Tabernacle and many laws to do with torts.		-900	500	Sinai/Canaan	1488	Soncino	Biblical	Exod.,Ex.,Exo,Shmot,Shemot,Ex,Exo.,Exod	שמות		Tanach,Torah
Leviticus	N/A	Vayikra (Leviticus), also called Torah Kohanim, has very little narrative. It begins with the instructions regarding the korbanot (sacrificial offerings). The remainder of the book is entirely devoted to legal questions about what are clean and unclean, laws for slaughtering animals, which animals are Kosher (fit) to eat and priestly laws of Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement). It also includes various moral and ritual laws to do with maintaining the sanctity of religious worship and a detailed list of punishments incurred for violations.		-900	500	Sinai/Canaan	1488	Soncino	Biblical	Vayikra,Lev.,Lev	ויקרא		Tanach,Torah
Numbers	N/A	Bemidbar (Numbers) relates the consolidation of Israel as a community in the Sinai and God taking up residence in the Mishkan (Tabernacle). They are now commanded to take possession of the Promised Law. The people are numbered and preparations are made. However there is considerable grumbling about the hardships of the desert journey and rebellions against the authority of Moses and Aaron. This sees God destroy about 15,000 by various means. When the people arrive at the Promise Land they send out spies who return with unfavourable reports. This ends with God punishing the remaining Israelites to wander the desert for 40 years until a new generation of Israelites returns to the Plain of Moab read to cross the river Jordan.		-900	500	Sinai/Canaan	1488	Soncino	Biblical	Num.,Num,Bamidbar,Bemidbar	במדבר		Tanach,Torah
Deuteronomy	N/A	Devarim (Deuteronomy) consists of three sermons by Moses delivered shortly before entering the Promised Land. The first sermon recalls the period of forty years of wondering in the wilderness and concludes with an exhortation to observe the Torah’s commandments. The second reminds the Israelites to remain loyal to God and not to follow strange gods. To observe the laws He has given them, on which possession of the Promised Land is dependent. The third provides comfort that even if Israel is unfaithful and exiled from the land, through repentance a return is possible.		-900	500	Sinai/Canaan	1488	Soncino	Biblical	Deu.,Devarim,Deu,Deut.,Deut	דברים		Tanach,Torah
Joshua	N/A	The first of the four books making up the Neviim Rishonim (Early Prophets) - Joshua begins with a commandment to take possession of Canaan and a warning to Joshua to keep faith with the Covenant. Then the Israelites cross the Jordan through the miraculous intervention of God and the Ark of the Covenant and are circumcised. The conquest of Canaan begins with Jericho and Ai and renewal of the Berit (Covenant). The book continues with the conquest of the south of country before the narratives moves on to the northern campaign. Joshua defeats a multi-ethic coalition headed by the King of Hazor. The book shifts from the conquest of the land to its division between the tribes. The book concludes with Joshua charging the leaders of Israel to remain faithful to God and a warning of the consequences of not doing so.		-900	400	Canaan	1488	Soncino	Biblical	Jos,Yehoshua,Jos.,Josh,Josh.	יהושע		Tanach,Prophets
Judges	N/A	The second of the four books making up the Neviim Rishonim (Early Prophets) - Shofetim (Judges) is divided into three major sections: a double prologue, a main body and a double epilogue. The book opens with the Israelites in the land of Canaan which God has promised to them, but worshiping foreign gods. The main body gives six accounts each concerning a major judge and their struggles against the oppressive kings of the surrounding nations. The main judges are Othniel, Ehud, Deborah and Barak, Gideon, Abimelch an Israelite who oppresses his own people, Jephthah and Samson. The minor judges are Shamgar, Tola, Jair, Ibzan, Elon and Abdon. The Epilogue concludes with stories that are not connected to a specific judge; Dan and the Idols of Micah and Gibeah and the Levite Concubine.		-900	400	Canaan	1488	Soncino	Biblical	Shoftim,Jdg,Judg,Jdg.,Judg.	שופטים		Tanach,Prophets
I Samuel	N/A	The third of the four books making up the Neviim Rishonim (Early Prophets) - Shemuel (Samuel) is divided into two parts and chronicles the birth of Samuel and God’s call to him as a boy. Samuel begins with the Prophet's birth and God's call to him as a boy. The story of the Ark of the Covenant that follows tells of Israel's oppression by the Philistines and their capturing of the Ark of the Covenant. Samuel appeals to God and the Philistines are decisively beaten. As Samuel grows old the people clamour for a King. Reluctantly Samuel appoints Saul from the tribe of Benjamin as King. Saul defeats the enemies of the Israelites, but sins against God. Samuel is then commanded to anoint David as King. Saul’s son and heir Jonathan befriends David but jealous, Saul plots David's death. David flees into the wilderness, where joins the Philistines, but continues secretly to champion his own people, until Saul and Jonathan are killed in battle. At this point, David offers a majestic eulogy, where he praises the bravery and magnificence of both his friend Jonathan and King Saul. David defeats Israel’s enemies, captures Jerusalem and brings the Ark to there. David wishes to build a temple, but Nathan tells him that one of David's sons will build the temple. David also commits adultery with Bathsheba and plots the death of her husband; for this God sends disasters against his house. For the remainder of his reign there are problems: one of his sons rapes one of his daughters, another son kills the first, his favourite son rebels and is killed, until finally only two contenders for the succession remain, one of them Bathsheba's son Solomon.		-750	250	Judea/Israel	1488	Soncino	Biblical	I Sam.,1Sam.,First Samuel,Shmuel Aleph,1Sam,I Shmuel,Samuel I,Shmuel I,1 Samuel,I Sam,I Shemuel	שמואל א	ש״א,ש"א,שמואל א׳,שמואל א'	Tanach,Prophets

I Kings	N/A	The fourth book making up the Neviim Rishonim (Early Prophets) - Melakhim (Kings) is divided into two parts. It presents the history of ancient Israel and Judah from the death of David to the release of his successor Jeconiah from imprisonment in Babylon, a period of some 400 years. David dies and Solomon comes to the throne. At the beginning of his reign he assumes God's promises to David and brings splendour to Israel and peace and prosperity to his people. The centrepiece of Solomon's reign is the building of the First Temple. As a consequence of Solomon's failure to stamp out the worship of other gods, the kingdom of David is split in two. His son Rehoboam becomes ruler of the southern kingdom of Judah. The northern tribes appoint Jeroboam as king of Israel. However these kings are uniformly bad leading God to bring the Assyrians to destroy and exile the northern tribes. The Kingdom of Judah endures with King Hezekiah instituting far reaching religious reform, centralising sacrifice at the temple in Jerusalem and destroying the images of other gods. However, these reforms do not last beyond his reign and eventually God brings the Babylonians to destroy the southern kingdom. The book concludes with the exile of the ruling class, prophets and priest. In the final verses Jeconiah is released from prison and honoured by the king of Babylon.		-500	100	Judea/Israel	1488	Soncino	Biblical	I Melachim,Melachim Aleph,Kings I,Melachim I,1 Kings,First Kings,I Melakhim	מלכים א	מ״א,מ"א,מלכים א׳,מלכים א'	Tanach,Prophets

Isaiah	N/A	The Book of Isaiah is the first of the Neviim Aharonim (Latter Prophets). The book is identified by a superscription as the works of Isaiah son of Amos though in the Middle Ages the commentator Abraham Ibn Ezra identified a second Isaiah living much later. The book can be divided into three separate collections. Isaiah 1–33 promises judgment and restoration for Judah, Jerusalem and the nations. Chapters 34–66 presume that judgment has been pronounced and restoration will follows soon. It can thus be read as an extended meditation on the destiny of Jerusalem into and after the Babylonian Exile.		-600	150	Judea/Israel	1488	Soncino	Biblical	Isa.,Yishayahu,Isa	ישעיהו	ישעיה	Tanach,Prophets
Jeremiah	N/A	The Book of Jeremiah is the second of the Neviim Aharonim (Latter Prophets). The superscription identifies it as Jeremiah son of Hilkiah. The book is divided into biographical, pros and poetic strands. Jeremiah prophesise during the reforms of King Josiah up to the assassination of the Babylonian appointed governor. During this period; Josiah reforms the religion, Babylon destroys Assyria, Egypt briefly imposes vassal status on Judah, and Babylon defeats Egypt and makes Judah a vassal. Judah revolts twice against Babylon resulting in Jerusalem and the Temple's destruction and the aristocracy is exiled. The poetic material is found largely in chapters 1–25 and consists of oracles in which the prophet speaks as God's messenger. These passages, dealing with Israel's unfaithfulness to God, the call to repentance, and attacks on the religious and political establishment, are mostly undated and have no clear context.		-550	50	Judea/Israel	1488	Soncino	Biblical	Yirmiyahu,Jer,Jer.	ירמיהו	ירמיה	Tanach,Prophets
Ezekiel	N/A	The Book of Ezekiel is the third of the Neviim Aharonim (Latter Prophets). According to the book itself, it records seven visions of the prophet Ezekiel, exiled in Babylon, for 22 years. Although it is the product of a long and complex history and does not necessarily preserve the very words of the prophet the visions and the book are structured around three themes: (1) Judgment on Israel (chapters 1–24); (2) Judgment on the nations (chapters 25–32); and (3) Future blessings for Israel (chapters 33–48). Its themes include the concepts of the presence of God, purity, Israel as a divine community, and individual responsibility to God.		-500	50	Ancient Babylonian Empire	1488	Soncino	Biblical	Ezek,Ezek.,Yehezkel,Yechezkel	יחזקאל		Tanach,Prophets
Hosea	N/A	The Book of Hosea is the first of the Tere Asar (Twelve Minor Prophets). The term denotes the short length of the text in relation to the longer prophetic texts known as the Major Prophets. He prophesies during a dark and melancholic era of Israel's history, the period of the Northern Kingdom's decline and fall. The apostasy of the people was rampant, having turned away from God in order to serve the calves of Jeroboam and Baal, a Canaanite god. The prophecy of Hosea centres on God's unending love towards a sinful Israel. In this text, God's agony is expressed over the betrayal of Israel. Hosea was directed by God to marry a prostitute. Marriage here is symbolic of the covenantal relationship between God and Israel. However, Israel has been unfaithful to God by following other gods and breaking the commandments which are the terms of the covenant, hence Israel is symbolized by a harlot who violates the obligations of marriage to her husband.		-800	200	Judea/Israel	1488	Soncino	Biblical	Hos.,Hos,Hoshea	הושע		Tanach,Prophets
Joel	N/A	The Book of Joel is the second of the Tere Asar (Twelve Minor Prophets). The term denotes the short length of the text in relation to the longer prophetic texts known as the Major Prophets. After a superscription ascribing the prophecy to Joel son of Pethuel, the book may be broken down into four sections. Lament over a great locust plague and a severe drought and the effects of these events on agriculture and farmers. A more apocalyptic passage compares the locusts to an army and reveals that they are God’s army. It closes with a call for national repentance in the face of God's judgment and a promise of future blessings.		-300	300	Judea/Israel	1488	Soncino	Biblical	Yoel	יואל		Tanach,Prophets
Amos	N/A	The Book of Amos is third of the Tere Asar (Twelve Minor Prophets). The term denotes the short length of the text in relation to the longer prophetic texts known as the Major Prophets. Amos was an older contemporary of Hosea and Isaiah, and was active during the reign of Jeroboam II. Amos lived in the kingdom of Judah but preached in the northern kingdom of Israel.

Obadiah	N/A	The Book of Obadiah is the fourht of the Tere Asar (Twelve Minor Prophets). The term denotes the short length of the text in relation to the longer prophetic texts known as the Major Prophets. The text consists of a single chapter, divided into 21 verses, making it the shortest book of the Tanakh (Bible). The book is a vision concerning the fall of Edom. Obadiah describes an encounter with God who addresses Edom’s arrogance and charges them for their violent actions against their brother nation, the House of Jacob. When Nebuchadnezzar II sacked Jerusalem and carted away the King of Judea, Edom assisted the Babylonians in looting the city. Obadiah suggests Edom should have remembered that blood was thicker than water. He said in judgement God would wipe out the house of Esau forever and not even a remnant would remain.		-600	100	Judea/Israel	1488	Soncino	Biblical	Ovadiah	עובדיה		Tanach,Prophets
Jonah	N/A	The Book of Jonah is the fifth of the Tere Asar (Twelve Minor Prophets). The term denotes the short length of the text in relation to the longer prophetic texts known as the Major Prophets.  Jonah son of Amittai  is sent by God to prophesise the destruction of city of Nineveh but instead attempts to escape the divine mission. He boards a ship but God calls up a great storm and he is swallowed by a great fish. Jonah repents and is vomited out onto dry land. He travels to Nineveh and calls on the people to repent. Jonah is furious, however, and angrily tells God that this is the reason he tried to flee from Him, as he knew Him to be a just and merciful God. He then beseeches God to kill him, a request which is denied when God causes a tree to grow over him, giving him shade. Initially grateful, Jonah's anger returns the next day, when God sends a worm to eat the plant, withering it, and he tells God that it would be better if he were dead. God responds, "You are concerned about the bush, for which you did not labour and which you did not grow; it came into being in a night and perished in a night. And should I not be concerned about Nineveh, that great city, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who do not know their right hand from their left, and also many animals? “Jonah is read as the Haftarah for the afternoon of Yom Kippur due to its story of God's willingness to forgive those who repent.		-400	300	Judea/Israel	1488	Soncino	Biblical	Yonah,Jon.,Jon	יונה		Tanach,Prophets
Micah	N/A	The Book of Micah is the sixth of the Tere Asar (Twelve Minor Prophets). The term denotes the short length of the text in relation to the longer prophetic texts known as the Major Prophets.

The book has three major divisions, chapters 1–2, 3–5 and 6–7, each introduced by the word "Hear," with a pattern of alternating announcements of doom and expressions of hope within each division. Micah reproaches unjust leaders, defends the rights of the poor against the rich and powerful, and preaches social justice; while looking forward to a world at peace centred on Zion under the leadership of a new Davidic monarch. While the book is relatively short, it includes lament (1.8–16; 7.8–10), theophany (1.3–4), hymnic prayer of petition and confidence (7.14–20),[7] and the "covenant lawsuit" (6.1–8), a distinct genre in which God sues Israel for breach of contract, that is, for violation of the Sinai covenant.		-600	150	Judea/Israel	1488	Soncino	Biblical	Mic.,Mic,Mikha	מיכה		Tanach,Prophets
Nahum	N/A	The Book of Nahum is the seventh of the Tere Asar (Twelve Minor Prophets). The term denotes the short length of the text in relation to the longer prophetic texts known as the Major Prophets. According to some, Nahum prophesies at the beginning of the reign of Ahaz. Others, however, think that his prophecies refer to the latter half of the reign of Hezekiah. The book of Nahum consists of two parts: Chapter one shows the majesty and might of God in goodness and severity. Chapters two and three describe the fall of Nineveh the capital of the Assyrian empire.		-650	50	Judea/Israel	1488	Soncino	Biblical	Nah.,Nah	נחום		Tanach,Prophets

Zephaniah	N/A	The Book of Zephaniah is the ninth of the Tere Asar (Twelve Minor Prophets). The term denotes the short length of the text in relation to the longer prophetic texts known as the Major Prophets. The superscription attributes its authorship to Zephaniah son of Cushi son of Gedaliah son of Amariah son of Hezekiah. Zephaniah devotes most of his energies to accomplishing a change in the behaviour of Israel through the threat of future calamity. He conceives of a date in the future when the Lord will judge all the people of the earth. This coming judgment will affect all of the nations, including the author’s own nation of Judah . The threats made against Jerusalem, however, are much more specific than the prophecies concerning foreign nations. This strengthened the belief that the Israelites, God’s chosen nations, were even more culpable than other nations. The book concludes by extending a promise of deliverance to the remnant of Israel from Babylonian captivity.		-550	100	Judea/Israel	1488	Soncino	Biblical	Zeph.,Tzephaniah,Zeph	צפניה		Tanach,Prophets

It is set at the start of the Persian Empire with Zerubbabel leading the Jews after their return to the land of Israel. Haggai’s message is filled with an urgency to rebuild the Second Temple and attributes a recent drought to the people's refusal to do so, which he views as key to Jerusalem’s glory. The book ends with the prediction of the downfall of kingdoms, with one Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, as the Lord’s chosen leader.		-450	70	Second Temple Judea	1488	Soncino	Biblical	Chaggai,Hag,Hag.	חגי		Tanach,Prophets
Zechariah	N/A	The Book of Zechariah is the eleventh of the Tere Asar (Twelve Minor Prophets). The term denotes the short length of the text in relation to the longer prophetic texts known as the Major Prophets. Zechariah’s ministry took place during the reign of Darius the Great (Zechariah 1:1), and was contemporary with Haggai in a post-exilic world after the fall of Jerusalem. Zechariah is specific about dating his writing 520–518 BCE. Chapters 1 to 6 recall the nation's history, for the purpose of presenting a solemn warning to the present generation. Chapters 7 and 8, delivered two years later, are an answer to the question whether the days of mourning for the destruction of the city should be kept any longer, and an encouraging address to the people, assuring them of God's presence and blessing. Chapters 9 to 14 consist of two “prophecies” or "burdens". The first prophecy (ch. 9-11) gives an outline of the course of God's providential dealings with his people down to the time of the coming of the Messiah. The second prophecy (ch. 12–14) points out the glories that await Israel in "the latter day", the final conflict and triumph of God's kingdom.		-450	70	Second Temple Judea	1488	Soncino	Biblical	Zech.,Zech,Zachariah,Zekharia,Zekharya	זכריה		Tanach,Prophets
Malachi	N/A	The Book of Malachi is the twelfth of the Tere Asar (Twelve Minor Prophets). The term denotes the short length of the text in relation to the longer prophetic texts known as the Major Prophets. The book is commonly attributed to a prophet by the name of Malachi though one of the Targums identifies Ezra as the author of Malachi. The Book of Malachi was written to correct the lax religious and social behaviour of the Israelites – particularly the priests – in post-exilic Jerusalem. Although the prophets urged the people of Judah and Israel to see their exile as punishment for failing to uphold their covenant with God, it was not long after they had been restored to the land and to Temple worship that the people's commitment to their God began once again to wane.		-450	70	Second Temple Judea	1488	Soncino	Biblical	Mal.,Mal	מלאכי		Tanach,Prophets
Psalms	N/A	Tehillim (Book of Psalms) is the first book of the Ketuvim(Writings), the third section of the Tanakh (Bible). The book is an anthology of 150 individual psalms.

The book is divided into five books that parallel the five books of the Torah (Pentateuch). There a five genres of Psalms; Hymns, songs of praise for God's work in creation or in history. Communal laments marking a disaster in the community. Royal Psalms pertaining to such matters as the king's coronation, marriage and battles.

Proverbs	N/A	The Book of Mishle (Proverbs) is the second book of Ketuvim (Writings) the third section of the Tanakh (Bible). Proverbs is not merely an anthology but a "collection of collections" relating to a pattern of life which lasted for more than a millennium. It is an example of the Biblical wisdom tradition, and raises questions of values, moral behaviour, the meaning of human life, and right conduct. The repeated theme is that "the fear of God (meaning submission to the will of God) is the beginning of wisdom". Roughly half the book is made up of short "sayings"; the other half is made up of longer poetic units of various types. These include "instructions" formulated as advice from a teacher or parent addressed to a student or child, dramatic personifications of both Wisdom and Folly, and the "words of the wise" sayings, longer than the Solomonic "sayings" but shorter and more diverse than the "instructions".		-600	200	Judea/Israel	1488	Soncino	Biblical	Prov,Pro,Prov.,Mishlei,Pro.	משלי		Tanach,Writings

Song of Songs	N/A	Shir Hashirim (The Song of Songs), also known as the Song of Solomon is the first of the five Megillot (scrolls) of Ketuvim (Writings) the last section of the Tanakh (Bible). Scripturally, it is unique in its celebration of sexual love. It gives "the voices of two lovers, praising each other, yearning for each other, proffering invitations to enjoy". The two are in harmony, each desiring the other and rejoicing in sexual intimacy; the women (or "daughters") of Jerusalem form a chorus to the lovers, functioning as an audience whose participation in the lovers' erotic encounters facilitates the participation of the reader. Jewish tradition reads it as an allegory of the relationship between God and Israel. The story is read on the prior to Sabbath each week by Sephardim and on Shabbat during Pesah by Ashkenazim.		-500	400	Judea/Israel	1488	Soncino	Biblical	Shir HaShirim,Canticles,Song.,Song	שיר השירים		Tanach,Writings
Ruth	N/A	Ruth (Book of Ruth) is the second of the five Megillot (scrolls) of Ketuvim (Writings) the last section of the Tanakh (Bible). The book tells of Ruth's accepting the God of the Israelites as her God and the Israelite people as her own. In Ruth 1:16 and 17 Ruth tells Naomi, her Israelite mother in law, "Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the Lord deal with me, be it ever so severely, if even death separates you and me."

Lamentations	N/A	Eikha (Book of Lamentations) is the third of the five Megillot (scrolls) of Ketuvim (Writings) the last section of the Tanakh (Bible). It is generally accepted that the destruction of Jerusalem by Babylon in 586 BCE forms the background to the poems.  The book is partly a traditional "city lament" mourning the desertion of the city by God, its destruction, and the ultimate return of the divinity, and partly a funeral dirge in which the bereaved bewails and addresses the dead. The tone is bleak: God does not speak, the degree of suffering is presented as undeserved, and expectations of future redemption are minimal. The book is traditionally recited on the fast day of Tisha Be-Av (Ninth of Av), mourning the destruction of both the First and Second Temples.		-550	50	Judea/Israel	1488	Soncino	Biblical	Lam,Lam.,Eichah	איכה		Tanach,Writings
Ecclesiastes	N/A	Qoheleth (Book of Ecclesiastes ) is the fourth of the five Megillot (scrolls) of Ketuvim (Writings) the last section of the Tanakh (Bible). It proceeds to discuss the meaning of life and the best way of life. He proclaims all the actions of man to be inherently hevel, meaning "vain", "futile", "empty", "meaningless", "temporary", "transitory", "fleeting", or "mere breath," as the lives of both wise and foolish people end in death. While Koheleth clearly endorses wisdom as a means for a well-lived earthly life, he does not ascribe eternal meaning to it. In light of this senselessness, one should enjoy the simple pleasures of daily life, such as eating, drinking, and taking enjoyment in one's work, which are gifts from the hand of God. The book concludes with the injunction: "Fear God, and keep his commandments; for that is the whole duty of everyone" (12:13). The author "Koheleth" uses a literary device to introduce himself as "son of David king in Jerusalem" - Solomon. It is read by Yemenite and Ashkenazi Jews during Sukkot.		-500	400	Judea/Israel	1488	Soncino	Biblical	Eccles.,Ecc,Kohelet,Ecc.	קהלת		Tanach,Writings

Ezra	N/A	Ezra–Nehemiah is the original combined version of the biblical books of Ezra and Nehemiah—the two were originally one, but were divided by Christians in the 3rd century CE and in Jewish circles in the 15th century. The text of Ezra–Nehemiah is composed largely in Late Biblical Hebrew with significant sections in Aramaic; there are occasional reflections of Old Persian vocabulary, but little significant influence from Greek. Covering the period from the fall of Babylon in 539 BCE to the second half of the 5th century BCE, it tells of the successive missions to Jerusalem of Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah, and their efforts to restore the worship of the God of Israel and to create a purified Jewish community. The narrative is highly schematic, each stage of the restoration following the same pattern: God "stirs up" the Persian king, the king commissions a Jewish leader to undertake a task, the leader overcomes opposition and succeeds, and success is marked by a great assembly.		-400	50	Second Temple Judea	1488	Soncino	Biblical	Ezr.,Ezr	עזרא		Tanach,Writings

Legends of the Jews	Louis Ginzberg	Legends of the Jews is an original synthesis of a vast amount of aggadah from all of classical rabbinic literature, as well as apocryphal, pseudopigraphical and even early Christian literature, with legends ranging from the creation of the world and the fall of Adam, through a huge collection of legends on Moses, and ending with the story of Esther and the Jews in Persia. Ginzberg had an encyclopedic knowledge of all rabbinic literature, and his masterwork included a massive array of aggadot. However he did not create an anthology which showed these aggadot distinctly. Rather, he paraphrased them and rewrote them into one continuous narrative that covered four volumes, followed by two volumes of footnotes that give specific sources. See Jewish folklore and Aggadah.		1909			1909-1938		Contemporary	The Legends of the Jews	אגדות היהודים		Midrash,Aggadic Midrash
Yalkut Shimoni on Torah		The Yalkut Shimoni (Gathering of Simon) or simply Yalkut is an aggadic (homiletic) compilation on the books of the Tanakh. From such older aggadot as were accessible to him, the author collected various interpretations and explanations of Biblical passages, and arranged these according to the sequence of those portions of the Bible to which they referred.

Yalkut Shimoni on Nach		The Yalkut Shimoni (Gathering of Simon) or simply Yalkut is an aggadic (homiletic) compilation on the books of the Tanakh. From such older aggadot as were accessible to him, the author collected various interpretations and explanations of Biblical passages, and arranged these according to the sequence of those portions of the Bible to which they referred. The second part deals with the Neviim and the Ketuvim, and contains 1,085 sections. For Neviim the redactor followed the Talmudic order of the prophetic books. In the arrangement of the Ketuvim the author deviates from the Talmudic order by placing the Book of Esther before the Book of Daniel.		1100			1521	Thessaloniki	Rishonim				Midrash,Aggadic Midrash
Tanna Debei Eliyahu Rabbah	N/A	Tanna Deve Eliyahu (Teachings of the School of Elijah) is the composite name of a midrash, consisting of two parts, whose final redaction took place at the end of the 10th century CE. The first part is called Seder Eliyahu Rabbah (31 chapters); the second, Seder Eliyahu Zuṭa (15 chapters). The underlying theme of the Tanna debe Eliyahu, which, with many interruptions, runs through the whole work, is the evolution of the world-system. The midrash calls the single periods of the history of man "shiṭṭot" (series). The first series, which deals with the beginning of the world and extends to the moment when man was driven out of Eden, consists of two subsections, (a) Ma'aseh Merkabah and (b) Ma'aseh Bereshit. The second series embraces the period from the expulsion of man from Eden to the Flood.  The six series of the world-system, found in the first part of the book was conceived prior to the creation of mankind. In the second part of the book mankind’s immorality seem it sink lower and lower until finally its destruction became necessary.		976	8	Talmudic Babylon/Italy/Israel	1598	Venice	Gaonim	Tanna Debei Eliyahu Rabah, Tanna Devei Eliyahu	תנא דבי אליהו רבה		Midrash,Aggadic Midrash

Pirkei Derabi Eliezer	N/A	Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer (Chapters of Rabbi Eliezer) is an aggadic-midrashic work on the Torah containing exegesis and retellings of biblical stories. The composition enjoyed widespread circulation and recognition throughout Jewish history, and continues to do so in the present. Traditionally, it has been understood to be a tannaitic composition which originated with the tanna Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, - a disciple of Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakai and teacher of Rabbi Akiva - and his disciples. However, modern scholarship has shown the book in fact a a medieval work from the 8th Century. The work is divided into 54 chapters, which may be divided into seven groups. Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer comprises exegesis, legends and folklore, as well as astronomical discussions related to the story of the Creation. The author dwells longest on the description of the second day of Creation, in which the Ma'aseh ha-Merkavah (Ezek. i.) is described in various forms.		830	200	Talmudic Israel/Babylon	1514	Istanbul	Gaonim	Baraita de-Rabbi Eliezer,Pirkei Derabbi Eliezer,Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezer,Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer,Pirke Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus,Haggadah de-Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus,Pirke Rabbi Eliezer ha-Gadol	פרקי דרבי אליעזר		Midrash,Aggadic Midrash

Bereishit Rabbah	N/A	Bereshith Rabbah (The Great Genesis) is a midrash comprising a collection of rabbinical homiletical interpretations of the Book of Genesis. It contains many simple explanations of words and sentences, often in Aramaic, suitable for the instruction of youth. It also contains varied haggadic expositions popular in the public lectures of the synagogues and schools. The tradition that Rabbi Hoshaiah is the author of Genesis Rabbah may be taken to mean that he began the work as numerous additions have been made over the subsequent years before it was redacted (4th-5th Century CE). The editor strung together various longer or shorter explanations and haggadic interpretations of the successive passages, sometimes anonymously, sometimes citing the author. Even then the text was probably not closed, for longer or shorter passages could always be added, the number of prefatory passages to a section be increased, and those existing be enlarged by accretion.  It is divided into sections variably numbered between 97-101. This arrangement shows some similarity with the triennial reading of the Torah as was practised in Israel.		500		Talmudic Israel/Babylon	1512	Istanbul	Achronim	Genesis Rabbah,Gen.

Vayikra Rabbah	N/A	Vayikrah Rabbah (The Great Leviticus) is a homiletic midrash to Leviticus. It is referred to by Nathan ben Jehiel (circa 1035–1106) and Rashi (1040–1105). It originated in the Land of Israel and is composed largely from older works.  Its redactor made use of Genesis Rabbah, Pesikta de-Rav Kahana, and the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds. It might have been written in 7th Century CE but others place it in the 5th Century. It is not a continuous explanatory interpretation to Leviticus, but a collection of exclusive sermons or lectures on the themes or texts of that book. It consists altogether of 37 such homilies, each of which constitutes a separate chapter. Leviticus Rabbah often refers to Scriptural passages on which the homilies are based as parashiyot and are further designated according to their content.		500		Talmudic Israel/Babylon	1512	Istanbul	Achronim	Leviticus Rabbah,Leviticus Rabba,Vayikra Rabba	ויקרא רבה		Midrash,Aggadic Midrash,Midrash Rabbah

Devarim Rabbah	N/A	Devarim Rabbah (The Great Deuteronomy) is an aggadic midrash or homiletic commentary on Deuteronomy. Unlike Bereshit Rabbah, the Midrash to Deuteronomy does not contain running commentaries on the text of the Bible, but twenty-five complete, independent homilies, together with two fragmentary ones. These are arranged as sedarim, the Sabbatical lessons for public worship according to the Palestinian triennial cycle. The stylistic manner of the opening discourse with a halakhic question is so closely connected with the original Midrash Tanḥuma. However, the introductory formula Yelamdenu ("May our teacher instruct us?") was used so often it was oftned named Yelamdenu. It was written around 900.		900		Talmudic Israel/Babylon	1512	Istanbul	Rishonim	Dvarim Rabba,Dvarim Rabbah,Deuteronomy Rabbah,D'varim Rabbah,D'varim Rabba,Devarim Rabba,Deuteronomy Rabba	דברים רבה		Midrash,Aggadic Midrash,Midrash Rabbah
Esther Rabbah	N/A	Esther Rabbah (The Great Esther) is the midrash to the Book of Esther. Except in the Vilna and Warsaw editions with their modern and arbitrary divisions, this Midrash consists of six "parashiyyot" (chapters, sections; singular = "parashah") introduced by one or more proems. From its plan and scope it is apparently an incomplete collection derived from the rich haggadic material on Esther. The book draws from earlier Midrashim and was expanded over the centuries. It was probably written around the 10th Century though others date it to the 12th or 13th century.		1200	100	Talmudic Israel/Babylon	1519	Istanbul	Rishonim	Ester Rabba,Esther Rabba,Ester Rabbah	אסתר רבה		Midrash,Aggadic Midrash,Midrash Rabbah

Its main sources being the Jerusalem Talmud, Bereshit Rabbah, Vayiḳra Rabbah, and Ekhah Rabbati. It would seem, moreover, that its author was opposed to the Babylonian Talmud which he disparages. It was composed shortly after Kohelet Rabbah, between the 5th and 9th centuries.		825	125	Talmudic Israel/Babylon	1519	Istanbul	Gaonim	Rut Rabbah,Ruth Rabba,Ruth Rabbah	רות רבה		Midrash,Aggadic Midrash,Midrash Rabbah
Eichah Rabbah	N/A	Ekhah Rabbah (The Great Lamentations) is a haggadic and homiletic interpretation of the Book of Lamentations. It belongs to oldest works of the Midrashic literature. It begins with 36 consecutive proems forming a separate collection, certainly made by the author. They constitute more than one-fourth of the work. These proems which are arranged in the sequence of the verses originated in the discourses. The haggadic explanations of this book were treated as appropriate dirges on the destruction of the first and second Temples in Jerusalem on the Ninth of Av. Numerous Greek words suggest the book was composed in Israel, sometime after the Jerusalem Talmud was completed, in the 5th century.		500		Talmudic Israel/Babylon	1519	Istanbul	Achronim	Eichah Rabba,Eicha Rabbah,Eicha Rabba	איכה רבה		Midrash,Aggadic Midrash,Midrash Rabbah
Sifra	N/A	Sifra (Book) is the Halakic midrash to Leviticus. It is frequently quoted in the Talmud, and the study of it followed that of the Mishnah. Like Leviticus itself, the midrash is occasionally called Torat Kohanim and in two passages also Sifra debe Rab. The authorship of the Sifra has been disputed. Maimonides and some modern scholars claimed Rabbi Judah the Prince was the author, whilst other scholars identify it with R. Hiyya. The Sifra shows strong connections with R. Akiva's school but with traces of R. Judah's influence. More doubtful is the relation to R. Ishmael's midrash; and in this connection must be considered the question whether the citation of certain explanations of Leviticus actually found in the Sifra are not in part due to confusion. But to R. Ishmael's school undoubtedly belong the later additions to "Arayot (forbidden relations). The Sifra was divided, according to an old arrangement, into 9 dibburim (sayings) and 80 parashiyyot (sections). As it exists today it is divided into 14 larger sections and again into smaller sub- sections.		300	50	Talmudic Israel/Babylon	1862	Vienna	Achronim	Torat Cohanim, Sifra de-Bei Rav	ספרא	תורת כהנים, ספרא דבי רב	Midrash,Halachic Midrash
Mekhilta	N/A	Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael (Measure, Rule of R. Ishamel) is a halakhic midrash to the Book of Exodus, used to denote a compilation of Scriptural exegesis using Talmudic hermeneutics. Neither the Babylonian nor the Jerusalem Talmud mention the Mekhilta by name, but it is referred to once as She'ar Sifre debe Rab. The first person to mention the Mekhilta by name was the author of the Geonic work Halakhot Gedolot. Another Geonic name for it was Mekhilta de-Erez Yisrael. The author, or more correctly the redactor, of the Mekhilta cannot be ascertained. Some scholars thought it was R. Ishmael ben Elisha, R. Akiba's contemporary. The present Mekhilta cannot, however, be the one composed by R. Ishmael, as is proved by the references in it to R. Ishmael's pupils and to other later tannaim. Both Maimonides and the author of the Halakhot Gedolot, moreover, refer, evidently on the basis of a tradition, to a much larger Mekhilta extending to the end of the Torah, while the midrash here considered discusses only certain passages of Exodus. It must be assumed, therefore, that R. Ishmael composed an explanatory midrash to the last four books of the Torah, and that his pupils amplified it.		135		Talmudic Israel/Babylon	1515	Istanbul	Tannaim	Mechilta Shemot,Mechilta Shemoth,Mechilta,Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael,Mechilta d'Rabbi Yishmael	מכילתא	מכילתא דרבי ישמעאל	Midrash,Halachic Midrash
Mekhilta DeRabbi Shimon Bar Yochai	N/A	The Mekhilta de-Rabbi Shimon (Measures, Rules of R. Simon) is a halakhic midrash on Exodus from the school of R. Akiba. Rabbi Shimon is identified with R. Shimon bar Yohai. He is probably the author. However, the frequent citation of his son Elazar makes it plausible that he edited his father's midrash. Though no midrash of this name is mentioned in the Talmud, it was known by other names including Mekhilta Ahirta de R. Shimon or Mekhilta Aheret. Today it has disappeared, but some extracts from it have been preserved and collected together as Midrash ha-Gadol		1000		Talmudic Israel/Babylon	1870	Vienna	Rishonim	Mekhilta DeRabbi Shimon,Mekhilta DeRashbi	מכילתא דרבי שמעון בר יוחאי	מכילתא דרבי שמעון ,מכילתא דרשב"י	Midrash,Halachic Midrash
Aramaic Targum to Song of Songs	N/A	Targum to the Song of Songs (Translation of the Song of Songs‎) belongs to the Aramaic translations of the bible which were used for instruction and explanation in schools and public worship. Song of Songs' language is mostly Western Aramaic from Israel with some traces of Eastern Aramaic. Its present version is traceable back to the 7th Century. It also contains some Arabic words suggesting that additions and changes were made during the Muslim period. There is a unitary topic running through it as the Targum recounts the entire history of Israel from the Exodus to the destruction of the Temple. Two layers of text are found; a simple translation of the Biblical text and an expansive homiletic midrash. This targum was so popular it was translated into Yiddish, Ladino, Latin, Judaeo-Arabic, Judaeo-Persian, Neo-Aramaic and several modern European languages.		600	200	Talmudic Israel/Babylon	1919-21	New York	Gaonim	Targum Shir Hashirim	תרגום על שיר השירים		Tanach,Targum
Targum Jonathan on Genesis	N/A	Targum Pseudo-Jonathan is a western targum (translation) of the Torah (Pentateuch) from the land of Israel (as opposed to the eastern Babylonian Targum Onkelos). Its correct title was originally Targum Yerushalmi (Jerusalem Targum), which is how it was known in medieval times. But because of a printer's mistake it was later labeled Targum Jonathan, in reference to Jonathan ben Uzziel. Some editions of the Pentateuch continue to call it Targum Jonathan to this day. Most scholars refer to the text as Targum Pseudo-Jonathan. This targum is more than a mere translation. It includes much Aggadic material collected from various sources as late as the Midrash Rabbah as well as earlier material from the Talmud. It is effectively a combination of a commentary and a translation. In the portions where it is pure translation, it often agrees with the Targum Onkelos. The date of its composition is disputed. It cannot have been completed before the Arabic conquest as it refers to Mohammad's wife Fatimah, but might have been initially composed in the 4th Century CE. However, some scholars date it in the 14th Century.		200	50	Talmudic Israel	1524	Venice	Tannaim	Targum Yonatan on Genesis	תרגום יונתן על בראשית		Tanach,Targum
Onkelos Deuteronomy	N/A	Targum Onkelos is the official eastern (Babylonian) targum (Aramaic translation) to the Torah. However, its early origins may have been western, in Israel. Some identify this translation as the work of Aquila of Sinope in an Aramaic translation (Zvi Hirsch Chajes), or believe that the name "Onkelos" originally referred to Aquila but was applied in error to the Aramaic instead of the Greek translation. The translator is unique in that he avoids any type of personification. Samuel D. Luzzatto suggests that the translation was originally meant for the "simple people". This view was strongly rebutted by Nathan Marcus Adler in his introduction to Netinah La-Ger. In Talmudic times, and to this day in Yemenite Jewish communities, Targum Onkelos was recited by heart as a verse-by-verse translation alternately with the Hebrew verses of the Torah in the synagogue. The Talmud states that "a person should complete his portions of scripture along with the community, reading the scripture twice and the targum once (Shnayim mikra ve-echad targum)." This passage is taken by many to refer to Targum Onkelos.		100	20	Talmudic Israel/Babylon	1482	Bologna	Tannaim	Targum Onkelos Deuteronomy	תרגום אונקלוס על דברים		Tanach,Targum

Megillat Taanit	N/A	Megillat Taanit (The Fast Scroll) is a chronicle which enumerates 35 eventful days on which the Jewish nation either performed glorious deeds or witnessed joyful events. These days were celebrated as feast-days. Public mourning was forbidden on 14 of them, and public fasting on all. The days are enumerated, not in the chronological order of the events they commemorate, but in the sequence of the calendar. In most of the editions this chronicle consists of two parts, which are distinct in language and in form. The text or Megillat Ta'anit proper, written in Aramaic and containing merely brief outlines in concise style and the Scholia or commentaries on the text, written in Hebrew no earlier than the 7th Century. Megillat Ta'anit is extant in many editions, and has had numerous commentaries. The best edition of the Aramaic and Hebrew text is that of Vered Noam.		55	15	Talmudic Israel/Babylon	1513	Mantua	Tannaim	Megillat ta'anit,Megilat taanit	מגילת תענית		Apocrypha
Megillat Antiochus	N/A	Megillat Antiochus (The Scroll of Antiochus) also Megillat Ha-Ḥashmonaim, Megillat Hanukkah, or Megillat Yevanit, recounts the story of Hanukkah and the history of the victory of the Maccabees (or Hasmoneans) over the Seleucid Empire. Early texts of the work exist in both Aramaic and Hebrew, but the Hebrew version is a literal translation from the Aramaic original. A Judaeo-Arabic translation was prepared by Saadya Gaon. There are several theories as to the work's authorship. Some scholars date it to somewhere between the 1st and 5th centuries. During the Middle Ages, Megillat Antiochus was read in the Italian synagogues on Hanukkah just as the Book of Esther is read on Purim. It still forms part of the liturgy of the Yemenite Jews.		300	400		1568	Thessaloniki		Scroll of Antiochus,Megillat Ha-Ḥashmonaim,Megillat Hanukkah	מגילת אנטיוכס	מגילת החשמונאים	Apocrypha
The Book of Maccabees II	N/A	2 Maccabees is a deuterocanonical book which focuses on the Jews' revoltagainst Antiochus IV Epiphanes and concludes with the defeat of the Syrian general Nicanor in 161 BC by Judas Maccabeus, the hero of the work. Unlike 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees was written in Koine Greek,[1] probably Alexandria, Egypt, c 124 BC. It presents a revised version of the historical events recounted in the first seven chapters of 1 Maccabees, adding material from the Pharisaic tradition, including prayer for the dead and the resurrection on Judgement Day. Catholics and Orthodox consider the work to be canonical and part of the Bible. Protestants and Jews reject most of the doctrinal innovations present in the work. Some Protestants include 2 Maccabees as part of the Biblical Apocrypha, useful for reading in the church. Article VI of the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England defines it as useful but not the basis of doctrine and not necessary for salvation.		-143	10	Hellenistic Egypt			Biblical	Sefer Hashmonaem II,The Second Book of Maccabees	ספר מקבים ב	ספר חשמונאים ב	Apocrypha
The Book of Maccabees I	N/A	1 Maccabees is a book written in Hebrew by a Jewish author after the restoration of an independent Jewish kingdom, about the latter part of the 2nd century BC. The original Hebrew is lost and the most important surviving version is the Greek translation contained in the Septuagint. The book is held as canonical scripture by some Christian churches (including Catholic,Orthodox, and Coptic churches), but not by Anglican and Protestant denominations. Such Protestants consider it to be an apocryphal book (see also Deuterocanon). In modern-day Judaism, the book is often of great historical interest, but has no official religious status.		-135	10	Second Temple Judea			Biblical	First Maccabees,Sefer Hashmonaim I,The first Book of Maccabees	ספר מקבים א	ספר מקבים,ספר חשמונאים א	Apocrypha
Seder Olam Rabbah	N/A	Seder Olam Rabbah (The Great Order of the World) is a 2nd-century CE Hebrew language chronology detailing the dates of biblical events from the Creation to Alexander the Great's conquest of Persia. Originally Seder Olam was a more extensive work dealing with the post-Alexandrian period. Instead the period from Alexander to Hadrian is condensed into the end of chapter 30. It adds no stories beyond what is in the biblical text, and addresses such questions as the age of Isaac at the binding and the number of years that Joshua led the Israelites. In its present form the Seder Olam Rabbah consists of 30 chapters, each 10 chapters forming a section, or gate. Tradition considers it to have been written about 160 CE by Yose ben Halafta, which is not unreasonable, but it was probably also supplemented and edited at a later period.		350	150	Talmudic Israel/Babylon	1513	Mantua	Tannaim	Seder Olam,Olam Rabbah	סדר עולם רבה	סדר עולם	Apocrypha
Sefer haArouch	Natan ben Yehiel	R. Nathan ben Yehiel of Rome’s magnum opus Ha-Arukh (The Order) is a lexicon of Hebrew and Aramaic words found in rabbinic literature. The sources for this work are numerous and show a wide breath of learning. These include Ha-Arukh by Ẓemaḥ b. Palṭoi, R. Maẓliaḥ, R. Moses ha-Darshan (a student of Hai Gaon), R. Gershom of Mainz, R. Hananel b. Hushiel and R. Nissim ben Jacob. Whilst the author shows extensive knowledge of philology, geography, folklore of the Near East he by no means knew all of the languages found in the work. However, organisation and presenting of the information made Ha-Arukh one of the most successful lexicons with a wide circulation in Italy, France and the Middle East.		1101			1470	Rome	Rishonim	Sefer haarouch	ספר הערוך		Dictionary
The Jastrow Dictionary	Marcus Jastrow	Commonly known as Jastrow’s Dictionary, this work was the first English language dictionary for studying the Talmud, Midrashim and Targumim. With over 30,000 entries, it was far more comprehensive than any other dictionary of Aramaic/Hebrew available until surpassed by more modern works. Each entry is fully vocalized, defined in English and presented in various contexts and word roots are cross-referenced wherever possible. It was written by Marcus Jastorw, a Polish-American rabbi in 1903.				Philadelphia	1903	London	Contemporary	Jastrow	ספר המילים		Dictionary
Magen Avraham	Abraham Abele Gombiner	Magen Avraham is a commentary on Orah Hayyim a section of R. Joseph Karo’s Shulhan Arukh. R. ‎Avraham Gombiner began his commentary in 1665 and completed it in 1671. His brother Yehudah ‎travelled in 1673 to Amsterdam to print the work, but did not have the necessary funds and died ‎on the journey. It was not published until 1692 by Shabbethai Bass in Dyhernfurth after Rabbi ‎Gombiner’s death. Gombiner's son Hayyim named the book Magen Avraham to perpetuate his ‎memory even though his father's students s claimed he wished to name it Ner Yisrael ("Lamp of ‎Israel") (abbreviation: ‎נר‎ ‎יפה‎ ‎של‎ ‎רבי‎ ‎אברהם הלוי‎). Rabbi Gombiner's innovative approach ‎incorporates the customs of his contemporary Poland and introduced the Kabbalistic customs of ‎Safed, especially those found in Rabbi Isaiah Horowitz's Shene Luhot Haberit. His work is terse and ‎difficult and requires explanation by later commentators.  ‎				Leszno, Poland	1692	Dyhernfurth	Achronim		מגן אברהם	נר ישראל	Halakha

Ben Ish Hai	Yosef Hayyim	Ben Ish Ḥai (Son of a Man (who) Lives), is the best known work of Hakham Yossef Hayyim. It is a collection of the laws on everyday life interspersed with mystical insights and customs, addressed to the masses and arranged by the weekly Torah portion. Its wide circulation has seen it become a standard reference work in Sephardi Halakha; functioning as an abridgement of the Shulhan Arukh much like its Ashkenazi counterpart the Kizur Shulhan Arukh.

Kitzur Shulchan Aruch	Shlomo Ganzfried	The Kitzur Shulhan Arukh is a summary of the Shulhan Arukh of Joseph Karo with reference to later commentaries, The Kitzur states what is permitted and what is forbidden without ambiguity. Ganzfried emphasised the customs of Jews of Hungary at that time. This work was explicitly written as a popular text, and its wide circulation has seen it become a standard reference work in halakhah; functioning as an abridgement of the Shulhan Arukh much like its Sephardi counterpart, the Ben Ish Hai. Ganzfried based his decisions on three Ashkenazi authorities: Rabbi Yaakov Lorberbaum; Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi, author of Shulhan Arukh HaRav; and Rabbi Abraham Danzig, author of Hayyei Adam and Hochmat Adam. In cases of disagreement he adopted the majority view. However, the Mishnah Berurah has mostly supplanted his work, along with the Hayyei Adam and the Arukh HaShulhan, as the primary authority on Jewish daily living among Ashkenazi Jews.

Mishnah Berurah	Israel Meir Kagan	Mishnah Berurah (Clarified Teaching) is a work of halakhah by Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan also colloquially known by the name of another of his books, Hafez Hayyim (Desirer of Life). His Mishnah Berurah is a commentary on Orah Hayyim, the first section of the Shulhan Arukh which deals with laws of prayer, synagogue, Shabbat and holidays, summarizing the opinions of the post-Medieval rabbinic authority. It is widely used as a reference and has mostly supplanted the Hayyei Adam and the Arukh HaShulhan as the primary authority on Jewish daily living among Ashkenazi Jews. He displays a tendency towards stringency though he does include lenient opinions.				Raduń	1884-1907	Warsaw	Achronim	Mishneh Brurah,Mishna Berura	משנה ברורה		Halakhah
Arbaah Turim	Jacob ben Asher	Arba'ah Turim (Four Rows) often called simply the Tur, is an important Halakhic code, composed by Yaakov ben Asher. In the Arba'ah Turim, Rabbi Jacob traces the practical Jewish law from the Torah text and the dicta of the Talmud through the Rishonim. He used the code of Rabbi Isaac Alfasi as his starting point; these views are then compared to those of Maimonides, as well as to the Ashkenazi traditions contained in the Tosafist literature. Unlike Maimonides' Mishneh Torah, the Tur is not limited to normative positions, but compares the various opinions on any disputed point. In most instances of debate, Rabbi Jacob follows the opinion of his father, Rabbi Asher ben Yehiel, the Rosh. The four sections are as follows: Orah Hayim; laws of prayer and synagogue, Sabbath and holidays. Yoreh De'ah; shehita and kashrut and forbidden mixtures. Even Ha'ezer; laws of marriage and divorce. Hoshen Mishpat; laws of finance, financial responsibility, damages (personal and financial) and legal procedure.

Sefer Hasidim	Judah HeHasid	Sefer Hasidim (Book of the Pious) is a foundation work of the teachings of the Hassidei Ashkenaz (Pious Ones of Germany). This Hebrew book originated between the late 12th and early 13th centuries in the Rhineland, shortly after the Second Crusade. It influenced the distinctive religious practices, Hebrew literary style of Jews in Ashkenaz and also shaped the discourse about Jewish ethics in medieval Europe and beyond. It offers an account of the day-to-day religious life of medieval German Jews, and their customs, beliefs, and traditions. The authentic Ḥasid is described in terms of asceticism, humility, serenity, altruism, and strict ethical behaviour. Though the work is non-systematic, it combines the thoughts of the three leaders of German Hasidism: Samuel the Ḥasid, Judah the Ḥasid of Regensburg (his son), and Eleazar ben Judah of Worms. The book was intended as a religious guide.				Speyer	1538	Bologna	Rishonim		ספר חסידים		Halakhah
Aruch HaShulchan	Yechiel Michel Epstein	Arukh HaShulhan (The Table Is Set) is a chapter-by-chapter restatement of the Shulhan Arukh. Compiled and written by Rabbi Yehiel Michel Epstein, the work attempts to be a clear, organized summary of the sources for each chapter of the Shulhan Arukh and its commentaries, with special emphasis on the positions of the Jerusalem Talmud, Maimonides and the glosses of Rema. When he deems it necessary, he also mentions the views of earlier authorities. The work follows the structure of the Tur and the Shulhan Arukh: a division into four large parts, subdivided into parallel chapters (simanim) that match in all three works. These are further subdivided into paragraphs (seifim). Epstein also wrote a similar work entitled Arukh HaShulhan he-Atid (Laying the Table of the Future), a parallel work to Arukh HaShulhan summarising and analysing the laws that will apply in Messianic times. Indeed, some of these laws, such as those relating to agriculture and farming, apply today for those living in the Land of Israel.		1893		Pinsk	1884-1893	Vilna	Achronim	Arukh hashulchan	ערוך השולחן		Halakhah
Kolbo	Aharon ben Jacob Ha-Kohen of Lunil	Kol Bo (all is in it) is a collection of Jewish ritual and civil laws, probably by Aaron ben Jacob ha-Kohen. It is mostly likely an abridgement of a longer work called Orḥot Ḥayyim, though this claim is disputed with some opinions saying the Kol Bo was a shorter earlier attempt to write a Halakhic work. Others claim the two works were authored by independent writers from Provence with both Gedaliah ibn Yaḥya Shemariah b. Simḥah or Joseph ben Tobiah of Provence suggested as authors. The Kol Bo does not pretend to any order; the laws that were later arranged in Oraḥ Ḥayyim are found together with those that were later arranged in Yoreh De'ah and Eben ha-'Ezer. Likewise, many laws are entirely missing in the Kol Bo. It is peculiar also in that some of the laws are briefly stated, while others are stated at great length, without division into paragraphs. After the regular code, terminating with the laws of mourning (No. 115), there comes a miscellaneous collection, containing the "taḳḳanot" of R. Gershom and of Jacob Tam, the Ma'aseh Torah of Judah ha-Nasi I, the legend of Solomon's throne, the legend of Joshua b. Levi, a Kabbalistic dissertation on circumcision, a dissertation on gemaṭria and noṭariḳon, sixty-one decisions of Eliezer b. Nathan; forty-four decisions of Samson Zadok, decisions of Isaac of Corbeil, and responsa of Perez ha-Kohen, decisions of Isaac Orbil, of the geonim Naṭronai, Hai Gaon, Amram Gaon, Nahshon Gaon, laws of the "miḳweh" taken from Perez's Sefer ha-Miẓwot, responsa, and finally the law of excommunication of Naḥmanides. For this reason it is quoted under the title of "Sefer ha-Liḳḳuṭim" in Avḳat Rokel, No. 13.		1490		Narbonne	1490	Middle-Age Italy	Rishonim		כלבו		Halakhah
Chofetz Chaim	Israel Meir Kagan	The Hafetz Hayyim (Desirer of Life) is the magnum opus of Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan. The book deals with the Jewish ethics of Lashon Hara (evil speech or loosely gossip and slander and prohibitions of defamation) and is considered the authoritative source on the subject. Rabbi Kagan provides copious sources from the Torah, Talmud and Rishonim (early commentators) about the severity of Jewish law on gossip is sometimes translated as prohibitions of slander, but in essence is concerning the prohibitions of saying unpleasant things about a person, even if they are true. The book is divided into three parts: Mekor Hayyim (Source of Life), which is the legal text. Be’er Mayyim Hayyim (Well of living water), which contain the footnotes and legal argument. It is commonly printed together with the text Shemirath ha-Lashon (Guarding of the tongue), an ethical treatise on the proper use of the faculty of speech.		1873		Raduń	1873	Vilna	Achronim	Chafetz Chaim	חָפֵץ חַיִּים		Halakhah
Shulchan Aruch HaRav	Shneur Zalman of Liadi	The Shulhan Arukh HaRav (Code of Jewish Law by the Rabbi) is a record of prevailing halakha by Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi, known during his lifetime as HaRav (The Rabbi) of Habad. Within the Habad community the work is known as the Alter Rebbe's Shulhan Arukh. Although widely accepted, the work was originally limited in printings. Much of the original text was destroyed in a fire in Lubavitch, and only parts of copies of the draft survived. The Shulhan Arukh HaRav is today used by most Hasidim as their basis for daily practice. It is broadly considered an authoritative halakhic text, and is frequently cited by later authorities such as Yisrael Meir Kagan in his Mishnah Berurah and Hakham Yosef Haim in his the Ben Ish Hai of, as well as in many contemporary responsa by leading halachic authorities of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It is also one of the three works on which Shlomo Ganzfried based his Kitzur Shulhan Arukh, the well-known precis of customary Ashkenazi Halakha.		1800	5	Belarus	1847-1875	Zhitomer/Warsaw	Achronim		שולחן ערוך הרב		Halakhah
Sefer HaChinukh	Pinhas ben Joseph ha-Levi	The Sefer ha-Hinukh (Book of Education),  is a work which systematically discusses the 613 commandments of the Torah. It was published anonymously in 13th century Spain. The work's enumeration of the commandments is based upon Maimonides' system of counting as per his Sefer Hamitvot; each is listed according to its appearance in the weekly Torah portion and the work is structured correspondingly. It separately discusses each of the 613 commandments, both from a legal and a moral perspective. For each, the discussion starts by linking the mizvah to its Biblical source, and then addresses the philosophical underpinnings of the commandment. Following this, it presents a brief overview of the halakha (practical Jewish law) governing its observance - usually based on Maimonides' Mishneh Torah - and closes with a summary as to the commandment's applicability. The sixteenth century author Gedaliah ibn Yaḥyah credited the Sefer ha-Hinukh to Rabbi Aharon HaLevi of Barcelona(1235-c. 1290), a Talmudic scholar and halakhist; but others disagree, as the views of the Hinukh contradict opinions held by HaLevi in other works. This has led to the conclusion that the true author to Sefer Ha-Hinukh was a different Rabbi Aharon Halevi, a student of the Rashba, rather than his colleague Though there is a debate about who is the true author, it is agreed upon that the Sefer ha-Hinukh was written by a father to his son, upon reaching the age of Bar Mizvah. Professor Israel Ta-Shma of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem argued that the author of as in fact Aaron's brother, Pinchas ben Joseph ha-Levi, who had written the work.		1270	15	Middle-Age Spain	1523	Venice	Rishonim	Sefer HaHinuch	ספר החינוך		Halakhah

This work was approved by the greatest Polish and Lithuanian scholars and since 1674 ‎has been published in most editions of the Yoreh De'ah. He frequently contested the decisions of ‎his predecessors, and followed an entirely new path in the interpretation of the Talmudic law. He ‎made light, too, of the decisions of his contemporaries, and thus drew on himself the enmity of ‎some among them, including David ben Shemuel HaLevi, author of Ture Zahav, and Aaron Shemuel ‎Kaidanover, author of Birkhat HaZevah.‎		1646		Krakow	1646	Krakow	Achronim	Shach on Yoreh De'ah	שפתי כהן	ש"ך	Halakhah

Sefer Yetzirah	N/A	Sefer Yezirah (Book of Formation) is the title of the earliest extant book on Jewish esotericism, although some early commentators treated it as a treatise on mathematical and linguistic theory as opposed to Kabbalah. It describes how the universe was created by the God of Israel (a list of all of God's Hebrew names appears in the first sentence of the book) through 32 wondrous ways of wisdom. The book is traditionally ascribed to the patriarch Abraham. However, according to modern historians, the origin of the text is unknown and hotly debated. Some scholars believe it might have an early medieval origin, while others emphasize earlier traditions appearing in the book. The division of the letters into the three classes of vowels, mutes, and sonants also appears in Hellenic texts. The historical origin of the Sefer Yezirah was placed by Reitzenstein in the 2nd century BCE. According to Benton, the Hebrew grammatical form places its origin closer to the period of the Mishnah, around the 2nd century CE. Nonetheless, the ascription of its authorship to the biblical patriarch Abraham shows the high esteem which it enjoyed for centuries. It may even be said that this work had a greater influence on the development of the Jewish mind than almost any other book after the completion of the Talmud.		0	200		1562	Mantua	Tannaim	The Book of Formation	ספר יצירה		Kabbalah
Sefer HaBahir	anonymous	Sefer HaBahir (Book of the Brightness) is an anonymous mystical work, attributed to a 1st-century rabbinic sage Nehunya ben HaKanah because it begins with the words, "R. Nehunya ben HaKanah said". It is an early work of esoteric Jewish mysticism which eventually became known as Kabbalah. Medieval Kabbalists write that the Bahir did not come down to them as a unified book, but rather in pieces found in scattered scrolls and booklets. The scattered and fragmentary nature of the Bahir’​s text, which sometimes ends discussion in mid-sentence and which often jumps randomly from topic to topic supports this claim. The historical critical study of this book points to a later date of composition. For some time scholars believed that it was written in the 13th century by Isaac the Blind, or by those in his school. The first sentence, "And now men see not the light which is bright in the skies" (Job 37:21), being isolated, and having no connection with what follows, was taken to be an allusion to the blindness of its author. However, modern scholars of Kabbalah now hold that at least part of the Bahir was an adaptation of an older work, the Sefer Raza Rabba. This older book is mentioned in some of the works of the Geonim; however no complete copies of Sefer Raza Rabba are still in existence. However, quotes from this book can still be found in some older works. Scholar Ronit Meroz argues that elements in the Bahir date back to 10th century Babylonia, as witnessed by the acceptance of the Babylonian system of vowel points, which later fell into disuse, while other elements were written in 12th century Provence. The Bahir assumes the form of an exegetic midrash on the first chapters of Genesis. It is divided into sixty short paragraphs or a hundred and forty passages and is in the form of a dialogue between master and disciples. The Bahir contains commentaries explaining the mystical significance of Biblical verses; the mystical significance of the shapes of the Hebrew letters; the mystical significance of the cantillation signs and vowel points on the letters; the mystical significance of statements in the Sefer Yezirah and the use of sacred names in magic.					1651	Amsterdam	NA		ספר הבהיר		Kabbalah
Pardes Rimonim	Moshe Cordovero	Pardes Rimonim (Orchard of Pomegranates) is a primary text of Kabbalah composed by the Jewish mystic Moses ben Jacob Cordovero in Safed. It is composed of thirteen gates or sections each subdivided into chapters. He indicates in his introduction that the work is based upon notes he took during his study of the Zohar, the foundational work of the Kabbalahand was designed "in order not to become lost and confused in its [the Zohar] depths". The work is an encyclopaedic summary of the Kabbalah, including an effort to "elucidate all the tenets of the Cabala, such as the doctrines of the sefirot, emanation, the divine names, the import and significance of the alphabet, etc." Pardes Rimonim was the first comprehensive exposition of Medieval Kabbalah, though its rationally influenced scheme was superseded by the subsequent 16th century Safed mythological scheme of Isaac Luria.					1651	Amsterdam	Rishonim	The Garden of Pomegranates	פרדס רימונים		Kabbalah

Maggid Meisharim	Joseph Karo	The Maggid Meisharim (Preacher of Righteousness), is  a strange and mystical diary, written by  Rabbi Joseph Karo during a period of fifty years recorded the nocturnal visits of an angelic being, his heavenly mentor, the personified Mishna (the authoritative collection of Jewish Oral Law). His visitor spurred him to acts of righteousness and even asceticism, exhorted him to study the Kabbala and reproved him for moral laxities. The discussions treat of various subjects. The maggid enjoins Karo to be modest in the extreme, to say his prayers with the utmost devotion, to be gentle and patient always. Especial stress is laid on asceticism; and Karo is often severely rebuked for taking more than one glass of wine, or for eating meat. Whenever Karo did not follow the severe instructions of his maggid, he suddenly heard its warning voice. His mentor also advised him in family affairs, told him what reputation he enjoyed in heaven, and praised or criticized his decisions in religious questions. Karo received new ideas from his maggid in regard to the Kabbala only; such information was in the nature of sundry Kabalistic interpretations of the Pentateuch, that in content, though not in form, remind one of the theories of Karo's pupil, Moses ben Jacob Cordovero. The present form of the Maggid Meisharim shows plainly that it was never intended for publication, being merely a collection of stray notes; nor does Karo's son Judah mention the book among his father's works (Introduction to the Responsa). It is known, on the other hand, that during Karo's lifetime the kabalists believed his Maggid to be actually existent.The Maggid Meisharim, furthermore, shows a knowledge of Karo's public and private life that no one could have possessed after his death; and the fact that the maggid promises things to its favourite that were never fulfilled such as a martyr's death proves that it is not the work of a forger or composed for Karo's glorification.

Sefer Etz Chaim	Hayyim Vital	Ez Hayyim (Tree of Life) is a collection of the teachings of Rabbi Yitzhak Luria by his disciple Hayyim Vital. It is the primary interpretation and synthesis of Lurianic Kabbalah. It consists of the primary introduction to the remainder of the Lurianic system. The Shemona She'arim was arranged by Shemuel Vital, the son of Hayyim Vital. Ez Hayyim is the only work published within Hayyim Vital's lifetime, the rest of his writings were buried with him in an unedited form. Supposedly Shemuel Vital had a dream that he was to exhume his father's grave and remove certain writings leaving the others buried. Shemuel Vital went on then to redact and publish the works as the Eight Gates which are then, at times subdivided into other works. Sephardi Kabbalists endeavour to study all eight gates. Ez Hayyim is published standard in a single volume three part arrangement, the initial two parts published by Hayyim Vital, with a third part, Nahar Shalom by Rabbi Shalom Sharabi, being now considered the third part.					1782		Achronim	Etz Chaim,Etz Hayyim, Etz Chayim	עץ חיים	ספר עץ חיים, Sefer Etz Chaim	Kabbalah

Hakdamah Lesefer HaZohar	Yehudah Ashlag	Tikune ha-Zohar (Repairs of the Zohar), also known as the Tikunim is a main text of Kabbalah. It is a separate appendix to the Zohar consisting of seventy commentaries on the opening word of Bereshit, in a style of Kabbalistic Midrash. Containing deep secret teachings of Torah, stirring dialogues and fervent prayers, the explicit and apparent theme and intention of Tikune ha-Zohar is to repair and support the Shekhinah or Malkhut and to bring on the Redemption and conclude the Exile. It is almost entirely written in Aramaic, except for quotations from Tanakh. The Aramaic of Tikunei ha-Zohar differs somewhat from the Aramaic of the Talmud and from the Aramaic of the rest of the Zohar. Though claimed to be ancient it is a medieval work. There is a Jewish custom to study it especially in the month of Elul and also during the Ten Days of Repentance.				Jerusalem	1945	Jerusalem	Contemporary		הקדמה לספר הזוהר		Kabbalah
Zohar		The Zohar (Splendor or Radiance) is the foundational work in the literature of Jewish mystical thought known as Kabbalah. It is a group of books including commentary on the mystical aspects of the Torah (the five books of Moses) and scriptural interpretations as well as material on mysticism, mythical cosmogony, and mystical psychology. The Zohar contains discussions of the nature of God, the origin and structure of the universe, the nature of souls, redemption, the relationship of Ego to Darkness and "true self" to "The Light of God", and the relationship between the "universal energy" and man. Its scriptural exegesis can be considered an esoteric form of the rabbinic literature known as Midrash, which elaborates on the Torah. The Zohar is mostly written in what has been described as an exalted, eccentric style of Aramaic. The Zohar first appeared in Spain in the 13th century, and was published by a Jewish writer named Moses de Leon. De Leon ascribed the work to R. Shimon bar Yohai. The Zohar spread among the Jews with remarkable swiftness. Scarcely fifty years had passed since its appearance in Spain before it was quoted by many Kabbalists, including the Italian mystical writer Menahem Recanati and by Todros Abulafia. Certain Jewish communities, however, such as the Dar Daim, Andalusian (Western Sefardic or Spanish and Portuguese Jews), and some Italian communities, never accepted it as authentic. Whilst some people believe it is genuinely part of an oral tradition, handed down from Moses to R. Shimon B. Yohai, others continued to oppose this. The noted Kabbalist Isaac of Acco is supposed to have heard directly from the widow of de Leon that her husband proclaimed authorship by Shimon b. Yohai for profit. Joseph ben Todros and his student Jacob both swore an oath that de Leon did not write it. Elijah Delmedigo (c.1458 – c.1493) endeavored to show that the Zohar could not be attributed to Shimon b. Yohai, by a number of arguments. Debates continued right up until the modern era with R. Yahyeh Qafeh attacking what he saw as subversive doctrines found in it. Modern scholarship, led by Gershom Scholem, tends to agree with Isaac of Acco's statements.		1250	150	Middle-Age Spain	1558	Mantua	Rishonim	Sefer haZohar	זוהר	ספר זוהר,ספר הזוהר	Kabbalah

Hallel	anonymous	Hallel (Hebrew: ‎הלל‎‎, "Praise") is a prayer, composed of a blessing, Psalms 113-118, which is recited ‎on major and minor festivals. Full-Hallel is recited on the first (two nights in the diaspora) of Pesah, ‎all of Sukkot, Shavout, Shemini Aseret and Simhat Torah (in the diaspora). Half-Hallel omits the first ‎eleven verses of Psalms 115 and 116. It is recited on the last six days of Pesah and on Rosh Hodesh. ‎While Ashkenazi and Spanish and Portuguese Jews recite a blessing at the beginning and end of ‎Half-Hallel, Sephardi Jews do not, particularly if the blessing they recite at the beginning of Full-‎Hallel is ‎לגמור את ההלל‎ (to complete the Hallel) instead of ‎לקרוא את ההלל‎ (to read the Hallel) as ‎recited by Ashkenazi Jews and Spanish and Portuguese Jews. Psalms from the Hallel have been set ‎to music many times, notably by Johann Bach and Vivaldi.‎							Tannaim		הלל		Liturgy

Yedid Nefesh	anonymous	Yedid Nefesh (Hebrew: ‎יְדִיד נֶפֶש‎) is the title of a piyyut. It is usually sung on the Jewish Sabbath. ‎Some sing it between Minhah (afternoon prayer) of Friday and the beginning of Kabbalat Shabbat. ‎It is sung by many Jews during Seudah Shelishit (the third meal on Shabbat; the first is on Friday ‎night, the second on Saturday lunch, and the third on Saturday before nightfall). Many Hassidim ‎say or sing it every morning before beginning to the Pesukei dezimra section of Shaharit in order to ‎arouse their love of God in preparation for the praises of Pesukei dezimra. This poem is commonly ‎attributed to the sixteenth century kabbalist, Rabbi Elazar ben Moshe Azikri (1533-1600), who first ‎published it in Sefer Haredim, but he did not claim authorship. Stefan C. Reif notes the first ‎appearance of Yedid Nefesh in the Samuel ben David ben Solomon’s commentary on Numbers.‎		1600	25				Achronim		ידִיד נֶפֶש		Liturgy,Piyutim

Messilat Yesharim	Moshe Chaim Luzzatto	Mesillat Yesharim is an ethical (musar) text composed by the influential Rabbi Moshe Hayyim ‎Luzzatto (1707–1746). It was written and published in Amsterdam. The earliest known manuscript ‎version, written in 1738, was arranged as a dialogue between a hakham (wise man) and ‎a hasid (pious person). Before publication, it was rearranged to have only one speaker. The ‎dialogue version often sheds light on the more well-known version. Mesillat Yesharim is probably ‎Luzzato's most influential work, widely learned in virtually every yeshiva since formal study of ‎musar texts was introduced to the yeshiva curriculum by the Mussar Movement of Rabbi Yisrael ‎Salanter. The aim is the perfection of character. Within each step, Luzzatto explains the step itself, ‎its elements, how it can be acquired, and what might detract from its acquisition.‎		1738		Amsterdam	1740	Amsterdam	Achronim	Mesillas Yeshorim,Path of the Just,Path of the Upright,Mesillat Yesharim	מסילת ישרים		Musar

Sefer HaYashar	anonymous	Sefer Ha-Yashar (The Book of Righteousness); one of the most popular ethical books in the Middle Ages. It was frequently attributed to R. Tam, the tosafist, who wrote a book by a similar name. Some manuscripts attribute the book to Zerahiah ha-Yevani, but there is no evidence for this. Others have suggested R. Jonah Gerondi as the author but his ideas are contradicted by Sefer Ha-Yashar. It remains an anonymous work probably written in the 13th century.

Tanna debei Eliyahu Zuta	N/A	Tanna Deve Eliyahu (Teachings of the School of Elijah) is the composite name of a midrash, consisting of two parts, whose final redaction took place at the end of the 10th century CE. The first part is called Seder Eliyahu Rabbah (31 chapters); the second, Seder Eliyahu Zuṭa (15 chapters). The underlying theme of the Tanna debe Eliyahu, which, with many interruptions, runs through the whole work, is the evolution of the world-system. The midrash calls the single periods of the history of man "shiṭṭot" (series). The first series, which deals with the beginning of the world and extends to the moment when man was driven out of Eden, consists of two subsections, (a) Ma'aseh Merkabah and (b) Ma'aseh Bereshit. The second series embraces the period from the expulsion of man from Eden to the Flood.  The six series of the world-system, found in the first part of the book was conceived prior to the creation of mankind. In the second part of the book mankind’s immorality seem it sink lower and lower until finally its destruction became necessary.		976	8	Talmudic Babylon/Italy/Israel	1904	Venice	Gaonim

Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer	N/A	Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer (Chapters of Rabbi Eliezer) is an aggadic-midrashic work on the Torah containing exegesis and retellings of biblical stories. The composition enjoyed widespread circulation and recognition throughout Jewish history, and continues to do so in the present. Traditionally, it has been understood to be a tannaitic composition which originated with the tanna Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, - a disciple of Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakai and teacher of Rabbi Akiva - and his disciples. However, modern scholarship has shown the book in fact a a medieval work from the 8th Century. The work is divided into 54 chapters, which may be divided into seven groups. Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer comprises exegesis, legends and folklore, as well as astronomical discussions related to the story of the Creation. The author dwells longest on the description of the second day of Creation, in which the Ma'aseh ha-Merkavah (Ezek. i.) is described in various forms.		830	200	Talmudic Israel/Babylon	1514	Istanbul	Gaonim	Baraita de-Rabbi Eliezer,Pirkei Derabbi Eliezer,Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezer,Pirke de-Rabbi Eliezer,Pirke Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus,Haggadah de-Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus,Pirke Rabbi Eliezer ha-Gadol	פרקי דרבי אליעזר		Midrash,Aggadic Midrash

Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael	N/A	Mekhilta de-Rabbi Ishmael (Measure, Rule of R. Ishamel) is a halakhic midrash to the Book of Exodus, used to denote a compilation of Scriptural exegesis using Talmudic hermeneutics. Neither the Babylonian nor the Jerusalem Talmud mention the Mekhilta by name, but it is referred to once as She'ar Sifre debe Rab. The first person to mention the Mekhilta by name was the author of the Geonic work Halakhot Gedolot. Another Geonic name for it was Mekhilta de-Erez Yisrael. The author, or more correctly the redactor, of the Mekhilta cannot be ascertained. Some scholars thought it was R. Ishmael ben Elisha, R. Akiba's contemporary. The present Mekhilta cannot, however, be the one composed by R. Ishmael, as is proved by the references in it to R. Ishmael's pupils and to other later tannaim. Both Maimonides and the author of the Halakhot Gedolot, moreover, refer, evidently on the basis of a tradition, to a much larger Mekhilta extending to the end of the Torah, while the midrash here considered discusses only certain passages of Exodus. It must be assumed, therefore, that R. Ishmael composed an explanatory midrash to the last four books of the Torah, and that his pupils amplified it.		135		Talmudic Israel/Babylon	1515	Istanbul	Tannaim	Mechilta Shemot,Mechilta Shemoth,Mechilta,Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael,Mechilta d'Rabbi Yishmael	מכילתא	מכילתא דרבי ישמעאל	Midrash,Halachic Midrash

Sifrei Bamidbar	N/A	Sifrei (Books) also known as Sifrei debe Rav or Sifrei Rabbah refers to either of two works of Midrash halakhah, based on the biblical books of Bemidbar (Numbers) and Devarim (Deuteronomy). The earliest Sifrei is found in Talmudic times and successively cited by Geonim and Rishonim. This early version is certainly not identical with the modern Sifrei. The modern Sifrei is not a uniform work, but one composed of two parts, one on Numbers and one on Deuteronomy that were joined together. The Sifrei to Numbers is evidently a midrash which originated in R. Ishmael's school, and which has all the peculiarities and characteristics of such a work though this does not exclude borrowing form Mekhilta de R. Shimon. The Sifrei to Deuteronomy is of an entirely different nature. The main portion (Nos. 53-303), halakic in character, is preceded and followed by haggadic parts, and it has all the characteristics of a midrash from the school of R. Akiba. Several anonymous passages may be cited to express the views of R. Simeon; this midrash may with a fair degree of certainty be ascribed to him. The editor certainly drew upon other midrashic works besides R. Simeon's midrash, especially upon that of R. Ishmael.		200		Talmudic Israel/Babylon	1546	Venice	Amoraim		ספרי במדבר		Midrash,Halachic Midrash

Beit Yosef	Joseph Karo	Beit Yosef is a book by Rabbi Joseph Caro. It is a long, detailed commentary on the Arba'ah Turim. ‎It ‎served as a precursor to the Shulhan Arukh, which Rabbi Caro wrote later in his life. Karo began ‎the ‎Beth Yosef in 1522 at Adrianople, finished it in 1542 at Safed in the Land of Israel; he published ‎it in ‎‎1550–59. This work analyzes the theories and conclusions of the Tur and opinions of authorities ‎not ‎mentioned by the latter. Karo evidences not only an astonishing range of reading, covering ‎almost ‎the entire rabbinic literature up to his time, but also remarkable powers of critical ‎investigation. He ‎evidences no inclination to simply accept the opinions of ancient authorities, ‎notwithstanding his ‎great respect for them.‎ Despite Caro's own preference for the Beit Yosef, it ‎was his shorter work Shulhan Arukh, which he wrote for students and ignorami that became ‎authoritative.‎				Adrianople/Safed	1550	Venice	Achronim

Alshich on Torah	Alshikh	Also known as "Torat Moshe"; this Torah commentary was authored by Rabbi Moshe Alshich, a prominent 16th-century rabbi, in Sefad, Ottoman Palestine. The Alshich was a popular preacher who gave lengthy lectures on the weekly Torah reading. These lectures were later published, in the form of a commentary, to insure that they were attributed to him and not to the people who repeated them. The Alshich’s commentary cites Talmud, Midrash and the Zohar, and contains ethical and moral teachings.
