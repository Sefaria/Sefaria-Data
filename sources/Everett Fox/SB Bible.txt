GENESIS 1:1	 @ At the beginning of God’s creating<br>	of the heavens and the earth,2 	when the earth was Confusion and Chaos,<br>	darkness over the face of Ocean,<br>	rushing-spirit of God hovering over the face of the waters—3 @ 	God said: Let there be light! And there was light.4 	God saw the light: that it was good.<br>	God separated the light from the darkness.5 	God called the light: Day, and the darkness he called: Night.<br>	There was setting, there was dawning: day one.6 @ 	God said:<br>	Let there be a dome amid the waters,<br>	and let it separate waters from waters!7 	God made the dome<br>	and separated the waters that were below the dome from the waters that were above the dome.<br>	It was so.8 	God called the dome: The Heavens.<br>	There was setting, there was dawning: second day.9 @ 	God said:<br>	Let the waters under the heavens be gathered to one place,<br>	and let the dry land be seen!<br>	It was so.10 	God called the dry land: Earth, and the gathering of the waters he called: Seas.<br>	And God saw that it was good.11 	God said:<br>	Let the earth sprout forth with sprouting-growth,<br>	plants seeding forth seeds, fruit trees yielding fruit, after their kind, in which is their seed, on the earth!<br>	It was so.12 	The earth brought forth sprouting-growth,<br>	plants seeding forth seeds, after their kind,<br>	trees yielding fruit, in which is their seed, after their kind.<br>	And God saw that it was good.13 	There was setting, there was dawning: third day.14 @ 	God said:<br>	Let there be lights in the dome of the heavens, to separate the day from the night,<br>	that they may be for signs—for set-times, for days and years,15 	and let them be for lights in the dome of the heavens, to provide light upon the earth!<br>	It was so.16 	God made the two great lights,<br>	the greater light for ruling the day and the smaller light for ruling the night,<br>	and the stars.17 	God placed them in the dome of the heavens18 	to provide light upon the earth, to rule the day and the night, to separate the light from the darkness.<br>	And God saw that it was good.19 	There was setting, there was dawning: fourth day.20 @ 	God said:<br>	Let the waters swarm with a swarm of living beings, and let flying-birds fly above the earth, across the dome of the heavens!21 	So God created the great sea-serpents<br>	and all living beings that crawl about, with which the waters swarmed, after their kind,<br>	and all winged birds after their kind.<br>	And God saw that it was good.22 	And God blessed them, saying:<br>	Bear fruit and be many and fill the waters in the seas,<br>	and let the birds be many on earth!23 	There was setting, there was dawning: fifth day.24 @ 	God said:<br>	Let the earth bring forth living beings after their kind,<br>	herd-animals, crawling things, and the wildlife of the earth after their kind!<br>	It was so.25 	God made the wildlife of the earth after their kind, and the herd-animals after their kind, and all crawling things of the soil after their kind.<br>	And God saw that it was good.26 	God said:<br>	Let us make humankind, in our image, according to our likeness!<br>	They shall have dominion over the fish of the sea, the birds of the heavens, animals, all the earth, and all crawling things that crawl about on the earth!27 		So God created humankind in his image,<br>		in the image of God did he create it,<br>		male and female he created them.28 	God blessed them,<br>	and God said to them:<br>	Bear fruit and be many and fill the earth<br>	and subdue it!<br>	Have dominion over the fish of the sea, the birds of the heavens, and all living things that crawl about on the earth!29 	And God said:<br>	Here, I give you<br>	all plants seeding forth seeds that are upon the face of all the earth,<br>	and all trees in which there is tree fruit seeding forth seeds;<br>	for you shall they be, for eating,30 	and also for all the living things of the earth, for all the birds of the heavens, for all crawling about on the earth in which there is living being—<br>	all green plants for eating.<br>	It was so.31 	Now God saw all that he had made,<br>	and here, it was exceedingly good!<br>	There was setting, there was dawning: the sixth day.2:1 @ 	Thus were finished the heavens and the earth, with all of their array.2 	God had finished, on the seventh day, his work that he had made,<br>	and then he ceased, on the seventh day, from all his work that he had made.3 	God gave the seventh day his blessing, and he hallowed it,<br>	for on it he ceased from all his work, that by creating, God had made.4 	These are the begettings of the heavens and the earth: their being created.<br> @ 	At the time of <sc>Yhwh</sc> God’s making of earth and heaven,5 	no bush of the field was yet on earth,<br>	no plant of the field had yet sprung up,<br>	for <sc>Yhwh</sc> God had not made it rain upon the earth,<br>	and there was no human/<i>adam</i> to work the ground/<i>adama</i>—6 	but a surge would well up from the earth and water all the face of the ground.7 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> God formed the human, of dust from the ground;<br>	he blew into his nostrils the breath of life<br>	and the human became a living being.8 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> God planted a garden in Eden/Land-of-Pleasure, in the east,<br>	and there he placed the human whom he had formed.9 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> God caused to spring up from the ground<br>	every type of tree, desirable to look at and good to eat,<br>	and the Tree of Life in the midst of the garden<br>	and the Tree of the Knowing of Good and Evil.10 @ 	Now a river goes out from Eden, to water the garden,<br>	and from there it divides and becomes four stream-heads.11 	The name of the first one is Pishon/Spreader—that is the one that goes around all the land of Havila, where gold is;12 	the gold of that land is good, there too are bdellium and the precious-stone carnelian.13 	The name of the second river is Gihon/Gusher—that is the one that goes around all the land of Cush.14 	The name of the third river is Hiddekel/Tigris—that is the one that goes to the east of Assyria.<br>	And the fourth river—that is Perat/Euphrates.15 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> God took the human and set him in the garden of Eden,<br>	to work it and to watch it.16 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> God commanded concerning the human, saying:<br>	From every [other] tree of the garden you may eat, yes, eat,17 	but from the Tree of the Knowing of Good and Evil—<br>	you are not to eat from it,<br>	for on the day that you eat from it, you must die, yes, die!18 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> God said:<br>	It is not good for the human to be alone;<br>	I will make him a helper corresponding to him.19 	So <sc>Yhwh</sc> God formed from the ground all the wildlife of the field and all the birds of the heavens<br>	and brought [each] to the human, to see what he would call it;<br>	and whatever the human called it as a living being, that became its name.20 	The human called out names for all the herd-animals and for the birds of the heavens and for all the wildlife of the field,<br>	but for the human, there could not be found a helper corresponding to him.21 	So <sc>Yhwh</sc> God caused a deep slumber to fall upon the human, so that he slept;<br>	then he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in its place.22 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> God built the rib that he had taken from the human into a woman<br>	and brought her to the human.23 	The human said:<br>		This-time, she-is-it!<br>		Bone from my bones<br>		and flesh from my flesh!<br>		She shall be called: Woman/<i>Isha,</i><br>		for from Man/<i>Ish</i> she was taken!24 	Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife,<br>	and they become one flesh.25 @ 	Now the two of them, the human and his wife, were nude, yet they were not ashamed.3:1 @ 	Now the snake was more shrewd than all the living-things of the field that <sc>Yhwh</sc> God had made.<br>	It said to the woman:<br>	Even though God said: You are not to eat from any of the trees in the garden . . . !2 	The woman said to the snake:<br>	From the fruit of the [other] trees in the garden we may eat,3 	but from the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden,<br>	God has said:<br>	You are not to eat from it and you are not to touch it,<br>	lest you die!4 	The snake said to the woman:<br>	Die, you will not die!5 	Rather, God knows<br>	that on the day that you eat from it, your eyes will be opened<br>	and you will become like gods, knowing good and evil.6 	The woman saw<br>	that the tree was good for eating<br>	and that it was a delight to the eyes,<br>	and the tree was desirable to contemplate.<br>	She took from its fruit and ate<br>	and gave also to her husband beside her,<br>	and he ate.7 	And the eyes of the two of them were opened<br>	and they knew [then]<br>	that they were nude.<br>	They sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths.8 @ 	They heard the sound of <sc>Yhwh</sc> God [who was] walking about in the garden at the breezy-time of the day.<br>	And the human and his wife hid themselves from the face of <sc>Yhwh</sc> God, amid the trees of the garden.9 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> God called to the human and said to him:<br>	Where are you?10 	He said:<br>	I heard the sound of you in the garden and I was afraid, because I am nude,<br>	and so I hid myself.11 	He said:<br>	Who told you that you are nude?<br>	From the tree about which I commanded you not to eat,<br>	have you eaten?12 	The human said:<br>	The woman whom you gave to be beside me, she gave me from the tree,<br>	and so I ate.13 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> God said to the woman:<br>	What, now, have you done?<br>	The woman said:<br>	The snake enticed me,<br>	and so I ate.14 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> God said to the snake:<br>	Because you have done this,<br>	cursed be you from all the animals and from all the wildlife of the field;<br>	on your belly shall you walk and dust shall you eat, all the days of your life.15 	Enmity will I put between you and the woman, between your seed and her seed:<br>	they will bruise you on the head, and you will bruise them in the heel!16 	To the woman he said:<br>	I will multiply, multiply your pain [from] your pregnancy;<br>	with pains shall you bear children.<br>	Toward your husband will be your lust, yet he will rule over you.17 	To Adam he said:<br>	Because you hearkened to the voice of your wife<br>	and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, saying:<br>	You are not to eat from it!<br>	Cursed be the ground on your account;<br>	with painstaking-labor shall you eat from it, all the days of your life.18 	Thorn and sting-shrub let it spring up for you,<br>	when you [wish to] eat the plants of the field!19 	By the sweat of your nostrils shall you eat bread,<br>	until you return to the ground,<br>	for from it you were taken.<br>	For you are dust, and to dust shall you return.20 @ 	The human called his wife’s name: Havva/Life-giver,<br>	for she became the mother of all the living.21 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> God made Adam and his wife coats of skins, and he clothed them.22 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> God said:<br>	Here, the human has become like one of us, in knowing good and evil.<br>	So now, lest he send forth his hand<br>	and take also from the Tree of Life<br>	and eat<br>	and live throughout the ages . . . !23 	So <sc>Yhwh</sc> God sent him away from the garden of Eden, to work the ground from which he had been taken.24 	He drove the human out<br>	and caused to dwell, east of the garden of Eden,<br>	the winged-sphinxes and the flashing, ever-turning sword<br>	to watch over the way to the Tree of Life.4:1 @ 	The human knew Havva his wife;<br>	she became pregnant and bore Kayin.<br>	She said:<br>	<i>Kaniti</i>/I-have-gotten<br>	a man, along with <sc>Yhwh</sc>!2 	And she continued bearing—his brother, Hevel.<br>	Now Hevel became a shepherd of flocks, and Kayin became a worker of the ground.3 @ 	It was, after the passing of days,<br>	that Kayin brought, from the fruit of the ground, a gift to <sc>Yhwh</sc>,4 	while as for Hevel, he too brought—from the firstborn of his flock, from their fat-parts.<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> had regard for Hevel and his gift,5 	but for Kayin and his gift he had no regard.<br>	Kayin became exceedingly upset and his face fell.6 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Kayin:<br>	Why are you upset? Why has your face fallen?7 	Is it not [thus]:<br>	if you intend good, bear-it-aloft,<br>	but if you do not intend good,<br>	at the entrance is sin, a crouching-demon,<br>	toward you his lust—<br>	but you can rule over him.8 @ 	Kayin said to Hevel his brother . . .<br>	But then it was, when they were out in the field<br>	that Kayin rose up against Hevel his brother<br>	and he killed him.9 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Kayin:<br>	Where is Hevel your brother?<br>	He said:<br>	I do not know. Am I the watcher of my brother?10 	Now he said:<br>	What have you done!<br>	A sound—your brother’s blood cries out to me from the ground!11 	And now,<br>	cursed be you from the ground,<br>	which opened up its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.12 	When you wish to work the ground<br>	it will not henceforth give its strength to you;<br>	wavering and wandering must you be on earth!13 	Kayin said to <sc>Yhwh</sc>:<br>	My iniquity is too great to be borne!14 	Here, you drive me away today from the face of the ground,<br>	and from your face I must conceal myself,<br>	I must be wavering and wandering on earth—<br>	now it will be:<br>	whoever comes upon me will kill me!15 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to him:<br>	No, therefore,<br>	whoever kills Kayin, sevenfold will it be avenged!<br>	So <sc>Yhwh</sc> set a sign for Kayin,<br>	so that whoever came upon him would not strike him down.16 	Kayin went out from the face of <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	and settled in the land of Nod/Wandering, east of Eden.17 @ 	Kayin knew his wife;<br>	she became pregnant and bore Hanokh.<br>	Now he became the builder of a city<br>	and called the city’s name according to his son’s name, Hanokh.18 	To Hanokh was born Irad;<br>	Irad begot Mehuyael,<br>	Mehuyael begot Metushael,<br>	Metushael begot Lemekh.19 @ 	Lemekh took himself two wives:<br>	the name of the [first] one was Ada, the name of the second was Tzilla.20 	Ada bore Yaval&mdash;<br>	he was the father of those who sit amid tent and herd.21 	His brother’s name was Yuval&mdash;<br>	he was the father of all those who play the lyre and the pipe.22 	And Tzilla bore as well—Tuval-Kayin,<br>	burnisher of every blade of bronze and iron.<br>	Tuval-Kayin’s sister was Naama.23 @ 	Lemekh said to his wives:<br>		Ada and Tzilla, hearken to my voice,<br>		wives of Lemekh, give ear to my saying:<br>		Aye—a man I kill for wounding me,<br>		a lad for [only] bruising me!24 		Aye—if sevenfold vengeance be for Kayin,<br>		then for Lemekh, seventy-sevenfold!25 	Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son.<br>	She called his name: Shet/Granted-One,<br>	meaning: God has granted me another seed in place of Hevel,<br>	for Kayin killed him.26 	To Shet as well a son was born;<br>	he called his name: Enosh/Mortal.<br> @ 		At that time they first called out the name of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.5:1 @	This is the record of the begettings of Adam/Humankind.<br>		At the time of God’s creating humankind,<br>		in the likeness of God did he [then] make it,2 		male and female he created them<br>		and gave blessing to them<br>		and called their name: Humankind<br>		on the day of their being created.3 	Adam lived thirty and a hundred years,<br>	and then he begot one in his likeness, according to his image,<br>	and called his name Shet.4 	And Adam’s days after he begot Shet were eight hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.5 	Now all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred years and thirty years;<br>	then he died.6 @ 	Shet lived five years and a hundred years, and then he begot Enosh.7 	And Shet lived after he begot Enosh seven years and eight hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.8 	Now all the days of Shet were twelve years and nine hundred years; then he died.9 @ 	Enosh lived ninety years, and then he begot Kenan.10 	And Enosh lived after he begot Kenan fifteen years and eight hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.11 	Now all the days of Enosh were five years and nine hundred years;<br>	then he died.12 @ 	Kenan lived seventy years, and then he begot Mehalalel.13 	And Kenan lived after he begot Mehalalel forty years and eight hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.14 	Now all the days of Kenan were ten years and nine hundred years;<br>	then he died.15 @ 	Mehalalel lived five years and sixty years, and then he begot Yered.16 	And Mehalalel lived after he begot Yered thirty years and eight hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.17 	Now all the days of Mehalalel were ninety-five years and eight hundred years;<br>	then he died.18 @ 	Yered lived sixty-two years and a hundred years, and then he begot Hanokh.19 	And Yered lived after he begot Hanokh eight hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.20 	Now all the days of Yered were sixty-two years and nine hundred years;<br>	then he died.21 @ 	Hanokh lived sixty-five years, and then he begot Metushelah.22 	And Hanokh walked in accord with God after he begot Metushelah three hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.23 	Now all the days of Hanokh were sixty-five years and three hundred years.24 	Hanokh walked in accord with God,<br>	and then he was no more,<br>	for God had taken him.25 @ 	Metushelah lived eighty-seven years and a hundred years, and then he begot Lemekh.26 	And Metushelah lived after he begot Lemekh eighty-two years and seven hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.27 	And all the days of Metushelah were sixty-nine years and nine hundred years;<br>	then he died.28 @ 	Lemekh lived eighty-two years and a hundred years, and then he begot a son.29 	He called his name: Noah,<br>	saying:<br>	<i>Zeh yenahamenu</i>/May this-one comfort-our-sorrow<br>	from our toil, from the pains of our hands<br>	coming from the ground, which <sc>Yhwh</sc> has cursed.30 @ 	And Lemekh lived after he begot Noah ninety-five years and five hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.31 	Now all the days of Lemekh were seventy-seven years and seven hundred years;<br>	then he died.32 @ 	Noah was five hundred years old,<br>	and then Noah begot Shem, Ham, and Yefet.6:1 @ 	Now it was when humans first became many on the face of the ground<br>	and women were born to them,2 	that the divine ones saw how fair the human women were,<br>	so they took themselves wives, whomever they chose.3 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said:<br>	My rushing-spirit shall not remain in humankind for ages, for they too are flesh;<br>	let their days be then a hundred and twenty years!4 	The giants were on earth in those days,<br>	and afterward as well,<br>	when the divine beings came in to the human women<br>	and they bore them [children]—<br>	they were the mighty-ones who were of ages [past], the men of name.5 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> saw<br>	that great was humankind’s evildoing on earth<br>	and every form of their heart’s planning was only evil all the day.6 	Then <sc>Yhwh</sc> was sorry<br>	that he had made humankind on earth,<br>	and it pained his heart.7 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said:<br>	I will blot out humankind, whom I created, from the face of the earth,<br>	from man to beast, to crawling thing and to the birds of the heavens,<br>	for I am sorry that I made them.8 	But Noah found favor in the eyes of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.9 @ 	These are the begettings of Noah.<br>	Noah was a righteous, wholehearted man in his generation;<br>	in accord with God did Noah walk.10 	And Noah begot three sons: Shem, Ham, and Yefet.11 @ 	Now the earth had gone to ruin before God, the earth was filled with wrongdoing.12 	God saw the earth, and here, it had gone to ruin,<br>	for all flesh had ruined its way upon the earth.13 @ 	God said to Noah:<br>	An end of all flesh has come before me,<br>	for the earth is filled with wrongdoing through them;<br>	here, I am about to bring ruin upon them, along with the earth.14 	Make yourself an ark of <i>gofer</i> wood;<br>	of reeds make the ark,<br>	and cover it within and without with a covering-of-pitch.15 	And this is how you are to make it:<br>	three hundred cubits the length of the ark, fifty cubits its breadth, and thirty cubits its height.16 	A skylight you are to make for the ark, and finish it to a cubit upward.<br>	The entrance of the ark you are to set in its side;<br>	with a lower, a second, and a third deck you are to make it.17 	As for me,<br>	here, I am about to bring on the Deluge, water upon the earth,<br>	to bring ruin upon all flesh that has rush of life in it, from under the heavens;<br>	all that is on earth will expire.18 	But I will establish my covenant with you:<br>	you are to come into the ark, you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you,19 	and from all living things, from all flesh, you are to bring two from all into the ark, to remain alive with you.<br>	They are to be a male and a female [each],20 	from birds after their kind, from herd-animals after their kind, from all crawling things of the ground after their kind,<br>	two from all are to come to you, to remain alive.21 	As for you,<br>	take for yourself from all edible-things that are eaten and gather it to you;<br>	it shall be for you and for them, for eating.22 	Noah did it,<br>	exactly as God commanded him, so he did.7:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Noah:<br>	Come, you and all your household, into the ark!<br>	For you I have seen as righteous before me in this generation.2 	From all [ritually] pure animals you are to take seven and seven [each], a male and his mate,<br>	and from all the animals that are not pure, two [each], a male and his mate,3 	and also from the birds of the heavens, seven and seven [each], male and female,<br>	to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.4 	For in another seven days<br>	I will make it rain upon the earth for forty days and forty nights<br>	and will blot out all existing-things that I have made, from the face of the earth.5 	Noah did it, exactly as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded him.6 @ 	Now Noah was six hundred years old when the Deluge occurred, water upon the earth;7 	and Noah came, his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives with him, into the ark before the waters of the Deluge.8 	From the pure animals and from the animals that are not pure and from the birds and all that crawls about on the ground—9 	two and two [each] came to Noah, into the ark, male and female,<br>	as God had commanded Noah.10 @ 	After the seven days it was<br>	that the waters of the Deluge were upon the earth.11 	In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month,<br>	on that day:<br>		then burst all the wellsprings of the great Ocean<br>		and the sluices of the heavens opened up.12 	The torrent was upon the earth for forty days and forty nights.13 @ 	On that very day came Noah, and Shem, Ham, and Yefet, Noah’s sons, and Noah’s wife and his three sons’ wives with them, into the ark,14 	they and all wildlife after their kind, all herd-animals after their kind, all crawling things that crawl on the earth after their kind, all birds after their kind: all chirping-things, all winged-things;15 	they came to Noah, into the ark, two and two [each] from all flesh in which there is the rush of life.16 	And those that came, male and female from all flesh they came,<br>	as God had commanded him.<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> closed [the door] upon him.17 @ 	Now the Deluge was forty days upon the earth.<br>	The waters increased and lifted the ark, so that it was raised above the earth;18 	the waters swelled and increased exceedingly upon the earth, so that the ark floated upon the face of the waters.19 	When the waters had swelled exceedingly, yes, exceedingly over the earth, all high mountains that were under all the heavens were covered.20 	Fifteen cubits upward swelled the waters; thus the mountains were covered.21 @ 	Then expired all flesh that crawls about upon the earth—birds, herd-animals, wildlife, and all swarming things that swarm on the earth,<br>	and all humans;22 	all that had the breath of the rush of life in their nostrils,<br>	all that were on dry-land, died.23 	He blotted out all existing-things that were on the face of the ground,<br>	from man to beast, to crawling thing and to birds of the heavens;<br>	they were blotted out from the earth.<br>	Noah alone remained, and those who were with him in the ark.24 	The waters swelled upon the earth for a hundred and fifty days.8:1 @ 	But God paid mind to Noah and all living-things, all the animals that were with him in the ark,<br>	and God brought a rushing-wind across the earth, so that the waters abated.2 	The wellsprings of Ocean and the sluices of the heavens were dammed up,<br>	and the torrent from the heavens was held back.3 	The waters returned from upon the earth, advancing and returning,<br>	and the waters diminished at the end of a hundred and fifty days.4 	The ark came to rest in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.5 	Now the waters advanced and diminished until the tenth month.<br>	In the tenth, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains could be seen.6 @ 	It was at the end of forty days: Noah opened the window of7 		the ark that he had made,/ and sent out a raven;<br>	 it went off, going off and returning, until the waters were dried up from upon the earth.8 	Then he sent out a dove from him, to see whether the waters had subsided from the face of the ground.9 	But the dove found no resting-place for the sole of her foot,<br>	so she returned to him into the ark,<br>	for there was water upon the face of all the earth.<br>	He sent forth his hand and took her, and brought her to him into the ark.10 	Then he waited yet another seven days<br>	and sent out the dove yet again from the ark.11 	The dove came back to him at eventime,<br>	and here, a freshly plucked olive leaf in her beak!<br>	So Noah knew<br>	that the waters had subsided from upon the earth.12 	Then he waited yet another seven days<br>	and sent out the dove,<br>	but she returned to him again no more.13 @ 	And so it was in the six hundred and first year, in the beginning-month, on the first day of the month,<br>	that the waters left dry-land upon the earth.<br>	Noah removed the covering of the ark and saw:<br>	here, the face of the ground had dried up.14 	Now in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.15 @ 	God spoke to Noah, saying:16 	Go out of the ark, you and your wife, your sons and your sons’ wives with you.17 	All living-things that are with you, all flesh—birds, animals, and all crawling things that crawl about on the earth,<br>	bring out with you,<br>	that they may swarm on earth, that they may bear fruit and become many on the earth.18 	So Noah went out, his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives with him,19 	all living-things—all crawling things, and all birds, all that crawl about on the earth,:br>	according to their clans they went out of the ark.20 @ 	Noah built a sacrificial-altar to <sc>Yhwh</sc>.<br>	He took from all pure animals and from all pure birds<br>	and offered up offerings on the altar.21 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> smelled the soothing savor<br>	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> said in his heart:<br>	I will never curse the ground again on humankind’s account, since what the human heart forms is evil from its youth;<br>	I will never again strike down all living-things, as I have done;22 	[never] again, all the days of the earth, shall<br>		sowing and harvest,<br>		cold and heat,<br>		summer and winter,<br>		day and night<br>		ever cease!9:1 @ 	God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them:<br>	Bear fruit and be many and fill the earth!2 	Fear-of-you, dread-of-you shall be upon all the wildlife of the earth and upon all the birds of the heavens,<br>	all that crawls on the ground and all the fish of the sea—<br>	into your hand they are given.3 	All things crawling about that live, for you shall they be, for eating;<br>	as with the green plants, I now give you all.4 	However: flesh with its life, its blood, you are not to eat!5 	However, too: for your blood, of your own lives, I will demand- satisfaction—<br>	from all wild-animals I will demand it,<br>	and from humankind, from each one [regarding] his brother,<br>	demand-satisfaction for human life.6 		Whoever [now] sheds human blood,<br>		for that human shall his blood be shed,<br>		for in God’s image he made humankind.7 	As for you—bear fruit and be many, swarm on earth and become many on it!8 	And God said to Noah and to his sons with him, saying:9 	As for me—here, I am about to establish my covenant with you and with your seed after you,10 	and with all living beings that are with you: birds, herd-animals, and all the wildlife of the earth with you,<br>	all those going out of the ark, of all the living-things of the earth.11 	I will establish my covenant with you:<br>		All flesh shall never be cut off again by waters of the Deluge; never again shall there be Deluge, to bring the earth to ruin!12 	And God said:<br>	This is the sign of the covenant which I set<br>	between me and you and all living beings that are with you, for ageless generations:13 	my bow I set in the clouds,<br>	that it may serve as a sign of the covenant between me and the earth.14 	It shall be:<br>	when I becloud the earth with clouds<br>	and in the clouds the bow is seen,15 	I will call to mind my covenant<br>	that is between me and you and all living beings—all flesh:<br>         never again shall the waters become a Deluge, to bring all flesh to ruin!16 	When the bow is in the clouds,<br>	I will look at it,<br>	to call to mind the age-old covenant<br>	between God and all living beings—<br>	all flesh that is upon the earth.17 	God said to Noah:<br>	This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.18 @ 	Noah’s sons who went out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Yefet;<br>	Now Ham is the father of Canaan.19 	These three were Noah’s sons, and from these were scattered abroad all the earth-folk.20 @ 	Noah was the first man of the soil; he planted a vineyard.21 	He drank from the wine and became drunk and exposed himself in the middle of his tent.22 	And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father’s nakedness and told his two brothers outside.23 	Then Shem and Yefet took a cloak, they put it on the shoulders of the two of them,<br>	and they walked backward, and covered their father’s nakedness.<br>	—Their faces were turned backward, so their father’s nakedness they did not see.24 @ 	Noah awoke from his wine, and it became known [to him] what his littlest son had done to him.25 	He said:<br>	Cursed be Canaan;<br>	servant of servants may he be to his brothers!26 	And he said:<br>	Blessed be <sc>Yhwh</sc>, God of Shem,<br>	but may Canaan be servant to them!27 	May God extend/<i>yaft</i><br>	Yefet;<br>	let him dwell in the tents of Shem,<br>	but may Canaan be servant to them!28 @ 	Noah lived after the Deluge three hundred years and fifty years.29 	Now all the days of Noah were nine hundred years and fifty years;<br>	then he died.10:1 @ 	Now these are the begettings of the sons of Noah,<br>	Shem, Ham, and Yefet.<br>	Sons were born to them after the Deluge.2 @ 	The Sons of Yefet are Gomer and Magog, Madai, Yavan and Tuval, Meshekh and Tiras.3 	The Sons of Gomer are Ashkenaz, Rifat, and Togarma.4 	The Sons of Yavan are Elisha and Tarshish, Cittites and Dodanites.5 	From these the seacoast nations were divided by their lands,<br>	each one according to its own tongue:<br>	according to their clans, by their nations.6 @ 	Now the Sons of Ham: Cush and Mitzrayim, Put and Canaan.7 	And the Sons of Cush: Seva and Havila, Savta, Ra’ma, and Savtekha;<br>	and the Sons of Ra’ma: Sheva and Dedan.8 	Now Cush begot Nimrod; he was the first mighty-one on earth.9 	He was a mighty hunter before <sc>Yhwh</sc>;<br>	therefore the saying is:<br>	Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before <sc>Yhwh</sc>.10 	His kingdom, at the beginning, was Bavel, and Erekh, Accad and11 		Calne, in the land of Shin’ar.<br>		From this land Ashur went forth and built Nineveh—along with12 		the city squares and Calah,/and Resen between Nineveh and Calah—that is the great city.13 	Mitzrayim begot the Ludites, the Anamites, the Lehavites,14 		the Naftuhites,/the Patrusites, and the Casluhites, from where the Philistines come, and the Caftorites.15 /16 		Canaan begot Tzidon his firstborn and Het,/along with the17 		Yevusite, the Amorite and the Girgashite,/ the Hivvite,18 		the Arkite and the Sinite,/the Arvadite, the Tzemarite and the Hamatite.<br>	Afterward the Canaanite clans were scattered abroad.19 	And the Canaanite territory went from Tzidon, then as you come toward Gerar, as far as Gaza, then as you come toward Sedom and Amora, Adma, and Tzevoyim, as far as Lasha.20 	These are the Sons of Ham according to their clans, according to their tongues, by their lands, by their nations.21 @ 	[Children] were also born to Shem,<br>	the father of all the Sons of Ever [and] Yefet’s older brother.22 	The Sons of Shem: Elam and Ashur, Arpakhshad, Lud, and Aram.23 		The Sons of Aram: Utz and Hul, Geter and Mash.24 	Arpakhshad begot Shelah, and Shelah begot Ever.25 	Two sons were born to Ever:<br>	the name of the first one was Peleg/Splitting, for in his days the earth-folk were split up,<br>	and his brother’s name was Yoktan.26 /27 		Now Yoktan begot Almodad and Shelef, Hatzarmavet and Yera,/28 /29 		Hadoram, Uzal and Dikla,/ Oval, Avimael and Sheva,/ Ofir, Havila, and Yovav—all these are the Sons of Yoktan.30 	Now their settlements went from Mesha, then as you come toward Sefar, to the highlands of the east.31 	These are the Sons of Shem according to their clans, according to their tongues, by their lands, according to their nations.32 @ 	These are the clan-groupings of the Sons of Noah, according to their begettings, by their nations.<br>	From these the nations were divided on earth after the Deluge.11:1 @ 	Now all the earth was of one language and one set-of-words.2 	And it was when they migrated to the east that they found a valley in the land of Shin’ar and settled there.3 	They said, each one to his neighbor:<br>	Come-now! Let us bake bricks and let us burn them well-burnt!<br>	&mdash;For them brick-stone was like building-stone, and raw-bitumen was for them like red-mortar.4 	And they said:<br>	Come-now! Let us build ourselves a city and a tower, its top in the heavens,<br>	and let us make ourselves a name,<br>	lest we be scattered over the face of all the earth!5 	But <sc>Yhwh</sc> came down to look over the city and the tower that the humans were building.6 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said:<br>	Here, [they are] one people with one language for them all, and this is [merely] the first of their doings—<br>	now there will be no barrier for them in all that they scheme to do!7 	Come-now! Let us go down and there let us baffle their language,<br>	so that no one will understand the language of his neighbor.8 	So <sc>Yhwh</sc> scattered them from there over the face of all the earth,<br>	and they had to stop building the city.9 	Therefore its name was called Bavel/Babble,<br>	for there <sc>Yhwh</sc> baffled the language of all the earth-folk,<br>	and from there, <sc>Yhwh</sc> scattered them over the face of all the earth.10 @ 	These are the begettings of Shem:<br>	Shem was a hundred years old, and then he begot Arpakhshad, two years after the Deluge.11 	And Shem lived after he begot Arpakhshad five hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.12 	Arpakhshad lived thirty-five years, and then he begot Shelah.13 	And Arpakhshad lived after he begot Shelah three years and four hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.14 	Shelah lived thirty years, and then he begot Ever.15 	And Shelah lived after he begot Ever three years and four hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.16 	Ever lived thirty-four years, and then he begot Peleg.17 	And Ever lived after he begot Peleg thirty years and four hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.18 	Peleg lived thirty years, and then he begot Re’u.19 	And Peleg lived after he begot Re’u nine years and two hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.20 	Re’u lived thirty-two years, and then he begot Serug.21 	And Re’u lived after he begot Serug seven years and two hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.22 	Serug lived thirty years, and then he begot Nahor.23 	And Serug lived after he begot Nahor two hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.24 	Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and then he begot Terah.25 	And Nahor lived after he begot Terah nineteen years and a hundred years, and he begot sons and daughters.26 	Terah lived seventy years, and then he begot Avram, Nahor, and Haran.27 @ 	Now these are the begettings of Terah:<br>	Terah begot Avram, Nahor, and Haran,<br>	and Haran begot Lot.28 	Haran died in the living-presence of Terah his father in the land of his kindred, in Ur of the Chaldeans.29 	Avram and Nahor took themselves wives;<br>	the name of Avram’s wife was Sarai,<br>	the name of Nahor’s wife was Milca—daughter of Haran, father of Milca and father of Yisca.30 	Now Sarai was barren, she had no child.31 	Terah took Avram his son and Lot son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, wife of Avram his son;<br>	they set out together from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go to the land of Canaan.<br>	But [when] they had come as far as Harran, they settled there.32 	And the days of Terah were five years and two hundred years;<br>	then Terah died,<br>	in Harran.12:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Avram:<br>	Go-you-forth<br>	from your land,<br>	from your kindred,<br>	from your father’s house,<br>	to the land that I will let you see.2 	I will make a great nation of you<br>	and will give-you-blessing<br>	and will make your name great.<br>	Be a blessing!3 	I will bless those blessing you,<br>	while those insulting you, I will curse.<br>	All the clans of the earth will find blessing through you!4 @ 	Avram went, as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had spoken to him, and Lot went with him.<br>	And Avram was five years and seventy years old when he went out of Harran.5 	Avram took Sarai his wife and Lot his brother’s son, all their property that they had gained, and the persons whom they had made-their-own in Harran,<br>	and they went out to go to the land of Canaan.<br>	They came to the land of Canaan;6 	and Avram passed through the land, as far as the Place of Shekhem, as far as the Oak of Moreh.<br>	Now the Canaanite was then in the land.7 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> was seen by Avram and said:<br>	I give this land to your seed!<br>	He built an altar there to <sc>Yhwh</sc> who had been seen by him.8 	He moved on from there to the highlands, east of Bet-El,<br>	and spread his tent, Bet-El toward the sea and Ai toward the east.<br>	There he built an altar to <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	and called out the name of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.9 	Then Avram journeyed on, continually journeying to the Negev.10 @ 	Now there was a famine in the land,<br>	and Avram went down to Egypt, to sojourn there,<br>	for the famine was heavy in the land.11 	It was when he came near to Egypt that he said to Sarai his wife:<br>	Now here, I know that you are a woman beautiful to look at.12 	It will be, when the Egyptians see you and say: She is his wife,<br>	that they will kill me, but you they will allow to live.13 	Pray say that you are my sister<br>	in order that it may go well with me on your account, and I myself may live thanks to you.14 	It was, when Avram came to Egypt, that the Egyptians saw how exceedingly beautiful the woman was;15 	Pharaoh’s courtiers saw her, and they praised her to Pharaoh,<br>	so the woman was taken away into Pharaoh’s house.16 	Now it went well with Avram on her account:<br>	sheep and oxen, donkeys, servants and maids, she-asses and camels, became his.17 	But <sc>Yhwh</sc> plagued Pharaoh with great plagues, and also his household, because of Sarai, Avram’s wife.18 	Pharaoh had Avram called, and said:<br>	What, now, have you have done to me?<br>	Why did you not tell me that she is your wife?19 	Why did you say: She is my sister?<br>	—So I took her for myself as a wife.<br>	But now, here is your wife, take her and go!20 	So Pharaoh put men in charge of him, who escorted him and his wife and all that was his.13:1 @ 	Avram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that was his, and Lot with him, to the Negev.2 	And Avram was exceedingly heavily-laden with livestock, with silver and with gold.3 	He went on his journeyings from the Negev as far as Bet-El, as far as the place where his tent had been at the first, between Bet-El and Ai,4 	to the place of the altar that he had made there at the beginning.<br>	There Avram called out the name of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.5 @ 	Now also Lot, who had gone with Avram, had sheep and oxen and tents.6 	And the land could not support them, to settle together,<br>	for their property was so great that they were not able to settle together.7 	So there was a quarrel between the herdsmen of Avram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock.<br>	Now the Canaanite and the Perizzite were then settled in the land.8 	Avram said to Lot:<br>	Pray let there be no quarreling between me and you, between my herdsmen and your herdsmen,<br>	for we are brother men!9 	Is not all the land before you?<br>	Pray part from me!<br>	If to the left, then I to the right,<br>	if to the right, then I to the left.10 	Lot lifted up his eyes and saw all the plain of the Jordan—<br>	how well-watered was it all, before <sc>Yhwh</sc> brought ruin upon Sedom and Amora,<br>	like <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> garden, like the land of Egypt, as you come toward Tzo’ar.11 	So Lot chose for himself all the plain of the Jordan.<br>	Lot moved on eastward, and they parted, each from the other:12 	Avram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled in the cities of the plain, and pitched-his-tent near Sedom.13 	Now the men of Sedom were exceedingly wicked and sinful before <sc>Yhwh</sc>.14 @    <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Avram, after Lot had parted from him:<br>	Pray lift up your eyes and see from the place where you are, to the north, to the Negev, to the east, to the Sea:15 	indeed, all the land that you see, I give it to you <br>	and to your seed, for the ages.16 	I will make your seed like the dust of the earth,<br>	so that if a man were able to measure the dust of the earth, so too could your seed be measured.17 	Arise, walk about through the land in its length and in its breadth,<br>	for I give it to you!18 	Avram moved-his-tent and came and settled by the oaks of Mamre, which are by Hevron.<br>	There he built an altar to <sc>Yhwh</sc>.14:1 @ 	Now it was in the days of Amrafel king of Shinar, Aryokh king of Ellasar, Kedorla’omer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goyim:2 	they prepared for battle against Bera king of Sedom, Birsha king of Amora, Shinav king of Adma, Shemever king of Tzevoyim, and the king of Bela—that is Tzo’ar.3 	All these joined together in the valley of Siddim/Limestone—that is the Sea of Salt.4 	For twelve years they had been subservient to Kedorla’omer,<br>	and in the thirteenth year they had revolted,5 	but in the fourteenth year came Kedorla’omer and the kings who were with him;<br>	they struck the Refa’ites in Ashterot-Karnayim, the Zuzites6 		in Ham, the Emites in Shaveh-Kiryatayim, /and the Horites in their highlands of Se’ir near El Paran, which is by the wilderness.7 	Then they returned and came to En Mishpat/Judgment Spring—that is Kadesh,<br>	and struck all the territory of the Amalekites and also the Amorites, who were settled in Hatzatzon-Tamar.8 	Then out marched the king of Sedom, the king of Amora, the king of Adma, the king of Tzevoyim, and the king of Bela—that is Tzo’ar;<br>	they set-their-ranks against them in war in the valley of Siddim,9 	against Kedorla’omer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goyim, Amrafel king of Shinar, and Aryokh king of Ellasar—<br>	four kings against the five.10 	Now the valley of Siddim is pit after pit of bitumen,<br>	and [when] the kings of Sedom and Amora fled, they flung themselves therein,<br>	while those who remained fled to the highlands.11 	And they took all the property of Sedom and Amora and all their food, and went off,12 	and they took Lot and all his property—the son of Avram’s brother—and went off,<br>	for he had settled in Sedom.13 	One who escaped came and told Avram the Hebrew—<br>	he was dwelling by the Oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner;<br>	they were Avram’s covenant-allies.14 	[When] Avram heard that his brother had been taken prisoner,<br>	he drew out his retainers, his house born slaves, eighteen and three hundred, and went in pursuit as far as Dan.15 	He split up [his men] against them in the night, he and his servants, and struck them and pursued them as far as Hova, which is to the north of Damascus.16 	But he returned all the property, and he also returned his brother Lot and his property, and also the women and the [other] people.17 	The king of Sedom went out to meet him upon his return from the strike against Kedorla’omer and against the kings that were with him, to the valley of Shaveh—that is the King’s Valley.18 @ 	Now Malki-Tzedek, king of Shalem, brought out bread and wine,<br>	for he was priest of God Most-High,19 	and blessed him and said:<br>	Blessed be Avram by God Most-High,<br>	Founder of Heaven and Earth!20 	And blessed be God Most-High,<br>	who has delivered your oppressors into your hand!<br>	And he gave him a tenth of everything.21 @ 	The king of Sedom said to Avram:<br>	Give me the persons, and the property take for yourself.22 	Avram said to the king of Sedom:<br>	I raise my hand in the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, God Most-High,<br>	Founder of Heaven and Earth,23 	if from a thread to a sandal-strap—if I should take from anything that is yours . . . !<br>	So that you should not say: I made Avram rich.24 	Nothing for me!<br>	Only what the lads have consumed,<br>	and the share of the men who went with me—Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre;<br>	let them take their share.15:1 @ 	After these events <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> word [came] to Avram in a vision,<br>	saying:<br>	Be not afraid, Avram,<br>	I am a delivering-shield to you;<br>	your reward is exceedingly great!2 	Avram said:<br>	My Lord, <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	what would you give me?<br>	For I am going [to die] accursed,<br>	and the Son Domestic of My House is Damascan Eliezer!3 	And Avram said:<br>	Here, to me you have not given seed,<br>	here, the Son of My House must be my heir!4 	But here, <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> word [came] to him, saying:<br>	This one shall not be heir to you;<br>	rather, the one that goes out from your body, <i>he</i> shall be heir to you.5 	He brought him outside and said:<br>	Pray look toward the heavens and count the stars;<br>	are you able to count them?<br>	And he said to him:<br>	So shall your seed be.6 	Now he trusted in <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	and he deemed it as righteous-merit on his part.7 @ 	He said to him:<br>	I am <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans<br>	to give you this land, to possess it.8 	But he said:<br>	My Lord <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	by what shall I know that I will possess it?9 	He said to him:<br>	Fetch me a calf of three, a she-goat of three, a ram of three, a turtle-dove, and a fledgling.10 	He fetched him all these,<br>	and he halved them down the middle and put each one’s half toward its neighbor,<br>	but the birds he did not halve.11 	Vultures descended upon the carcasses,<br>	but Avram drove them off.12 	Now it was, when the sun was coming in ,<br>	that deep slumber fell upon Avram,<br>	and here, a fright [and] great darkness falling upon him!13 	And he said to Avram:<br>	Know, yes, know<br>	that your seed will be sojourners in a land not theirs;<br>	they will put them in servitude and afflict them<br>	for four hundred years.14 	But the nation to which they are in servitude—I will bring judgment on them,<br>	and after that they will go out with great property.15 	As for you, you will go to your fathers in peace;<br>	you will be buried at a good ripe-age.16 	But in the fourth generation they will return here,<br>	for the iniquity of the Amorite has not reached full-measure heretofore.17 	Now it was, when the sun had come in,<br>	that there was night-blackness,<br>	and here, a smoking oven, a fiery torch<br>	that crossed between those pieces.18 @ 	On that day<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> cut a covenant with Avram,<br>	saying: I give this land to your seed,<br>	from the River of Egypt to the Great River, the river Euphrates,19 	the Kenite and the Kenizzite and the Kadmonite,20 	and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Refa’ites,21 	and the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Girgashite and the Yevusite.16:1 @ 	Now Sarai, Avram’s wife, had not borne him [children].<br>	She had an Egyptian maid—her name was Hagar.2 	Sarai said to Avram:<br>	Now here, <sc>Yhwh</sc> has obstructed me from bearing.<br>	Pray come in to my maid;<br>	perhaps I may be built-up-with-sons through her!<br>	Avram hearkened to Sarai’s voice:3 	Sarai, Avram’s wife, took Hagar the Egyptian-woman, her maid,<br>	at the end of ten years of Avram’s being settled in the land of Canaan,<br>	and gave her to her husband Avram as a wife for him.4 	He came in to Hagar, and she became pregnant.<br>	But [when] she saw that she was pregnant, her mistress became of light-worth in her eyes.5 	So Sarai said to Avram:<br>	The wrong done me is on you!<br>	I myself gave my maid into your bosom,<br>	but now that she sees that she is pregnant, I have become of light-worth in her eyes.<br>	May <sc>Yhwh</sc> see-justice-done between me and you!6 @ 	Avram said to Sarai:<br>	Here, your maid is in your hand, deal with her however seems good in your eyes.<br>	Sarai afflicted her, so that she had to run away from her.7 	But <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> messenger found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, by the spring on the way to Shur.8 	He said:<br>	Hagar, Sarai’s maid, whence do you come, whither are you going?<br>	She said:<br>	I am running away from Sarai my mistress.9 	<sc>Yhwh’s</sc> messenger said to her:<br>	Return to your mistress and let yourself be afflicted under her hand!10 	And <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> messenger said to her:<br>	I will make your seed many, yes, many, it will be too many to count!11 	And <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> messenger said to her:<br>	Here, you are pregnant,<br>	you will bear a son;<br>	you are to call his name: Yishmael/God Hearkens,<br>	for God has hearkened to your being afflicted.12 	He shall be a wild-ass of a man,<br>	his hand against all, hand of all against him,<br>	yet in the presence of all his brothers shall he dwell.13 	Now she called the name of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, the one who was speaking to her:<br>	You God of Seeing!<br>	For she said:<br>	Have I actually gone on seeing here<br>	after his seeing me?14 	Therefore the well was called:<br>	Well of the Living-One Seeing-Me.<br>	Here, it is between Kadesh and Bered.15 @ 	Hagar bore Avram a son,<br>	and Avram called the name of the son whom Hagar bore: Yishmael.16 	Avram was eighty years and six years old when Hagar bore Yishmael to Avram.17:1 @ 	Now when Avram was ninety years and nine years old<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> was seen by Avram and said to him:<br>	I am God Shaddai.<br>	Walk in my presence! And be wholehearted!2 	I set my covenant between me and you,<br>	I will make you exceedingly, exceedingly many.3 	Avram flung himself upon his face.<br>	And God spoke with him,<br>	saying:4 	As for me,<br>	here, my covenant is with you,<br>	so that you will become the father of a throng of nations.5 		No longer shall your name be called Avram,<br>		rather shall your name be Avraham,<br>		for I will make you <i>Av Hamon Goyyim</i>/Father of a Throng of 		Nations!6 	I will cause you to bear fruit exceedingly, exceedingly,<br>	I will make nations of you;<br>	kings will go out from you!7 	I establish my covenant between me and you and your seed after you, throughout their generations as a covenant for the ages,<br>	to be God to you and to your seed after you.8 	I will give to you and to your seed after you, the land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan, as a holding for the ages,<br>	and I will be God to them.9 	God said to Avraham:<br>	As for you,<br>	you are to keep my covenant, you and your seed after you, throughout their generations.10 	This is my covenant which you are to keep, between me and you and your seed after you:<br>	every male among you shall be circumcised.11 	You shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin,<br>	so that it may serve as a sign of the covenant between me and you.12 	At eight days old, every male among you shall be circumcised, throughout your generations,<br>	whether house-born or bought with silver from any foreigner, who is not your seed.13 	Circumcised, yes, circumcised shall be your house-born and your silver-bought [slaves],<br>	so that my covenant may be in your flesh as a covenant for the ages.14 	But a foreskinned male,<br>	who does not have the foreskin of his flesh circumcised,<br>	that person shall be cut off from his kinspeople—<br>	he has violated my covenant!15 	God said to Avraham:<br>	As for Sarai your wife—you shall not call her name Sarai,<br>	for Sara/Princess is her name!16 	I will bless her, and I will give you a son from her;<br>	I will bless her<br>	so that she becomes nations&mdash;<br>	kings of peoples shall come from her!17 	But Avraham flung himself on his face and laughed,<br>	and said in his heart:<br>		To a hundred-year-old man shall there be [children] born?<br> Or shall ninety-year-old Sara give birth?18 	Avraham said to God:<br>	If only Yishmael might live in your presence!19 	God said:<br>	Nevertheless,<br>	Sara your wife is to bear you a son,<br>	you shall call his name: Yitzhak/He Laughs.<br>	I will establish my covenant with him as a covenant for the ages, for his seed after him.20 	And as for Yishmael, I hearken to you:<br>	here, I will make him blessed, I will make him bear fruit, I will make him exceedingly, exceedingly many—<br>	he will beget twelve exalted-leaders, and I will make a great nation of him.21 	But my covenant I will establish with Yitzhak, whom Sara will bear to you at this set-time, in another year.22 	He finished speaking with Avraham,<br>	and God went up, from beside Avraham.23 @ 	Avraham took Yishmael his son and all those born in his house and all those bought with his silver,<br>	all the males among Avraham’s household people,<br>	and circumcised the flesh of their foreskins on that same day,<br>	as God had spoken to him.24 	Now Avraham was ninety-nine years old when he had the flesh of his foreskin circumcised,25 	and Yishmael his son was thirteen years old when he had the flesh of his foreskin circumcised.26 	On that same day<br>	were circumcised Avraham and Yishmael his son,27 	and all his household people, whether house-born or bought with silver from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.18:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> was seen by him by the oaks of Mamre<br>	as he was sitting at the entrance to his tent at the heat of the day.2 	He lifted up his eyes and saw:<br>	here, three men standing over against him.<br>	[When] he saw them, he ran to meet them from the entrance to his tent and bowed low to the earth3 	and said:<br>	My lords,<br>	pray if I have found favor in your eyes,<br>	pray do not pass by your servant!4 	Pray let a little water be fetched, then wash your feet and recline under the tree;5 	let me fetch a bit of bread, that you may refresh your hearts,<br>	then afterward you may pass on—<br>	for you have, after all, passed your servant’s way!<br>	They said:<br>	Do thus, as you have spoken.6 	Avraham hastened into his tent to Sara and said:<br>	Make haste! Three measures of choice flour! Knead it, make bread-cakes!7 	And Avraham ran to the oxen,<br>	fetched a young ox, tender and fine, and gave it to a serving-lad, that he might hasten to make it ready;8 	then he fetched cream and milk and the young ox that he had made ready, and placed it before them.<br>	Now he stood over against them under the tree while they ate.9 	They said to him:<br>	Where is Sara your wife?<br>	He said:<br>	Here in the tent.<br>	Now he said:10 	I will return, yes, return to you when time revives,<br>	and Sara your wife will have a son!<br>	Now Sara was listening at the entrance to the tent, which was behind him.11 	And Avraham and Sara were old, advanced in days;<br>	the path of women had ceased for Sara.12 	Sara laughed within herself, saying:<br>	After I have become worn, is there to be pleasure for me? And my lord is old!13 	But <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Avraham:<br>	Now why does Sara laugh and say: Shall I really give birth, now that I am old?14 	Is anything too wondrous for <sc>Yhwh</sc>?<br>	At that set-time I will return to you, when time revives, and Sara will have a son.15 	Sara pretended [otherwise], saying:<br>	No, I did not laugh.<br>	For she was afraid.<br>	But he said:<br>	No, indeed you laughed.16 @ 	The men arose from there, and looked down upon the face of Sedom,<br>	and Avraham went with them to escort them.17 	Now <sc>Yhwh</sc> had said [to himself]:<br>	Shall I cover up from Avraham what I am about to do?18 	For Avraham is to become, yes, become a nation great and mighty [in number],<br>		and all the nations of the earth will find blessing through him.19 	Indeed, I have known him,<br>	in order that he may charge his sons and his household after him:<br>	they shall keep the way of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	to do what is right and just,<br>	in order that <sc>Yhwh</sc> may bring upon Avraham what he spoke concerning him.20 	So <sc>Yhwh</sc> said:<br>	The outcry in Sedom and Amora—how great it is!<br>	And their sin—how exceedingly heavily it weighs!21 	Now let me go down and see:<br>	if they have done according to its cry that has come to me—<br>	destruction!<br>	And if not—<br>	I wish to know.22 	The men turned from there and went toward Sedom,<br>	but Avraham still stood in the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.23 	Avraham came close and said:<br>	Will you really sweep away the innocent along with the guilty?24 	Perhaps there are fifty innocent within the city;<br>	will you really sweep it away?<br>	Will you not bear with the place because of the fifty innocent that are in its midst?25 	[Heaven] forbid for you to do a thing like this,<br>	to deal death to the innocent along with the guilty,<br>	that it should come about: like the innocent, like the guilty,<br>	[Heaven] forbid for you!<br>	The judge of all the earth—will he not do what is just?26 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said:<br>	If I find in Sedom fifty innocent within the city,<br>	I will bear with the whole place for their sake.27 	Avraham spoke up, and said:<br>	Now pray, I have ventured to speak to my Lord,<br>	and I am but earth and ashes:28 	Perhaps of the fifty innocent, five will be lacking—<br>	will you bring ruin upon the whole city because of the five?<br>	He said:<br>	I will not bring ruin, if I find there forty-five.29 	But he continued to speak to him and said:<br>	Perhaps there will be found there only forty!<br>	He said:<br>	I will not do it, for the sake of the forty.30 	But he said:<br>	Pray let not my Lord be upset; I wish to speak:<br>	Perhaps there will be found there only thirty! <br>	He said:<br>	I will not do it, if I find there thirty.31 	But he said:<br>	Now pray, I have ventured to speak to my Lord:<br>	Perhaps there will be found there only twenty!<br>	He said:<br>	I will not bring ruin, for the sake of the twenty.32 	But he said:<br>	Pray let my Lord not be upset; I wish to speak just this one time:<br>	Perhaps there will be found there only ten!<br>	He said:<br>	I will not bring ruin, for the sake of the ten.33 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> went, as soon as he had finished speaking to Avraham, and Avraham returned to his place.19:1 @ 	The two messengers came to Sedom at sunset,<br>	as Lot was sitting at the gate of Sedom.<br>	Lot saw them, arose to meet them and bowed low, nostrils to the earth.2 	and said:<br>	Now pray, my lords,<br>	pray turn aside to your servant’s house,<br>	spend the night, wash your feet;<br>	[starting-early] you may go on your way.<br>	They said:<br>	No, rather we will spend the night in the square.3 	But he pressed them exceedingly hard,<br>	so they turned in to him and came into his house.<br>	He made them a drinkfest and baked flat-cakes, and they ate.4 	They had not yet lain down, when the men of the city, the men of Sedom, encircled the house,<br>	from young lad to old man, all the people [even] from the outskirts.5 	They called out to Lot and said to him:<br>	Where are the men who came to you tonight?<br>	Bring them out to us&mdash;we want to know them!6 	Lot went out to them, to the entrance, and the door he shut behind him7 	and said:<br>	Pray, brothers, do not be so wicked!8 	Now pray, I have two daughters who have never known a man,<br>	pray let me bring them out to you, and you may deal with them however seems good in your eyes;<br>	only to these men do nothing,<br>	for they have, after all, come under the shadow of my roof-beam!9 	But they said:<br>	Step aside!<br>	and said:<br>	This one came to sojourn and would judge, play-the-judge?!<br>	Now we will do more wickedly to you than [to] them!<br>	And they pressed exceedingly hard against the man, against Lot, and stepped closer to break down the door.10 	But the men put out their hand and brought Lot in to them, into the house, and shut the door,11 	while the men who were at the entrance to the house, they struck with dazzling-light—[all men] great and small,<br>	so that they were unable to find the entrance.12 	The men said to Lot:<br>	Whom else have you here—a son-in-law, sons, daughters?<br>	Bring anyone whom you have in the city out of the place!13 	For we are about to bring ruin on this place,<br>	for how great is their outcry before <sc>Yhwh</sc>!<br>	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> has sent us to bring it to ruin.14 	Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, those who had taken his daughters [in marriage], and said:<br>	Up, out of this place, for <sc>Yhwh</sc> is about to bring ruin on the city!<br>	But in the eyes of his sons-in-law, he was like one jesting.15 	Now when the dawn came up,<br>	the messengers pushed Lot on, saying:<br>	Up, take your wife and your two daughters who are here,<br>	lest you be swept away in the iniquity of the city!16 	But he lingered,<br>	so the men seized his hand, his wife’s hand, and the hand of his two daughters,<br>	since <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> pity was upon him,<br>	and brought him out and left him outside the city.17 	It was, when they had brought him outside, that [one of them] said:<br>	Escape for your life, do not gaze behind you, do not stand still anywhere in the plain:<br>	to the highlands escape, lest you be swept away!18 	Lot said to them:<br>	No, pray, my lord!19 	Now pray, your servant has found favor in your eyes,<br>	and you have shown great loyalty in how you have dealt with me, keeping me alive—<br>	but I, I am not able to escape to the highlands,<br>	lest the wickedness cling to me, and I die!20 	Now pray, that town is near enough to flee to, and it is so tiny;<br>	pray let me escape there—is it not tiny?—and stay alive!21 	He said to him:<br>	Here then, I lift up your face in this matter as well,<br>	by not overturning this town of which you speak.22 	Make haste, escape there,<br>	for I am not able to do anything until you come there.<br>	Therefore the name of the town was called: Tzo’ar/Tiny.23 	The sun was going out over the earth as Lot came to Tzo’ar.24 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> rained down brimstone and fire upon Sedom and Amora, coming from <sc>Yhwh</sc>, from the heavens;25 	he overturned those cities and all of the plain, all those settled in the cities and the vegetation of the ground.26 	But his wife gazed behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.27 @ 	Avraham started-early in the morning to the place where he had stood in <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> presence;28 	he looked down upon the face of Sedom and Amora and upon the whole face of the region of the plain<br>	and saw:<br>	here, the dense-smoke of the land went up like the dense-smoke of a furnace!29 @ 	Thus it was, when God brought ruin on the cities of the plain,<br>	that God kept Avraham in mind and sent out Lot from the overturning,<br>	when he overturned the cities where Lot had settled.30 @ 	Lot went up from Tzo’ar and settled in the highlands, his two daughters with him,<br>	for he was afraid to settle in Tzo’ar.<br>	So he settled in a cave, he and his two daughters.31 @ 	Now the firstborn said to the younger:<br>	Our father is old,<br>	and there is no man in the land to come in to us as befits the way of all the earth!32 	Come, let us have our father drink wine and lie with him<br>	so that we may keep seed alive by our father!33 	So they had their father drink wine that night;<br>	then the firstborn went in and lay with her father,<br>	but he knew nothing of her lying down or her arising.34 	It was on the morrow that the firstborn said to the younger:<br>	Here, yesternight I lay with Father.<br>	Let us have him drink wine tonight as well,<br>	then you go in and lie with him,<br>	so that we may keep seed alive by our father.35 	They had their father drink wine that night as well,<br>	and then the younger arose and lay with him,<br>	but he knew nothing of her lying down or her arising.36 	And Lot’s two daughters became pregnant by their father.37 	The firstborn bore a son and called his name: Moav/By Father,<br>	&mdash;he is the tribal-father of Moav of today.38 	The younger also bore a son, and called his name: Ben-Ammi/Son of My Kinspeople,<br>	&mdash;he is the tribal-father of the children of Ammon of today.20:1 @ 	Avraham traveled from there to the Negev; he settled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.2 	Avraham said of Sara his wife: She is my sister.<br>	So Avimelekh king of Gerar sent and had Sara taken.3 	But God came to Avimelekh in a dream of the night and said to him:<br>	Here, you must die because of the woman whom you have taken,<br>	for she is a wedded wife!4 	Avimelekh had not come near her. He said:<br>	My Lord,<br>	Would you kill a nation, though it be innocent?5 	Did he not say to me: She is my sister,<br>	and also she, she said: He is my brother!<br>	With a whole heart and with clean hands have I done this.6 	God said to him in the dream:<br>	I also know that it was with a whole heart that you did this,<br>	and so I also held you back from being at fault against me;<br>	therefore I did not let you touch her.7 	But now, return the man’s wife<br>	—indeed, he is a prophet, he can intercede for you—<br>	and live!<br>	But if you do not return her:<br>	know that you must die, yes, die, you and all that is yours!8 	Early in the morning Avimelekh called all his servants,<br>	he spoke all these words in their ears, and the men became exceedingly afraid.9 	Then Avimelekh had Avraham called and said to him:<br>	What have you done to us?<br>	In what did I fail you,<br>	that you have brought me and my kingdom into such great fault?<br>	Deeds which are not to be done, you have done to me!10 	And Avimelekh said to Avraham:<br>	What did you foresee, that you did this thing?11 	Avraham said:<br>	Indeed, I said to myself:<br>	Surely there is no awe of God in this place;<br>	they will kill me on account of my wife!12 	Then, too, she is truly my sister, my father’s daughter,<br>	however not my mother’s daughter—so she became my wife.13 	Now it was, when the power-of-God caused me to roam from my father’s house,<br>	that I said to her:<br>	Let this be the favor that you do me:<br>	in every place that we come, say of me: He is my brother.14 	Then Avimelekh took sheep and oxen, servants and maids, and gave them to Avraham,<br>	and returned Sara his wife to him.15 	Avimelekh said:<br>	Here, my land is before you,<br>	settle wherever seems good in your eyes.16 	And to Sara he said:<br>	Here, I have given a thousand pieces of silver to your brother;<br>	here, it shall serve you as a covering for the eyes for all who are with you<br>	and with everyone, that you have been decided for.17 	Avraham interceded with God<br>	and God healed Avimelekh: his wife and his slave-women, so that they gave birth.18 	For <sc>Yhwh</sc> had obstructed, obstructed every womb in Avimelekh’s household<br>	for the sake of Sara, the wife of Avraham.21:1 @ 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> took account of Sara as he had said,<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> dealt with Sara as he had spoken.2 	Sara became pregnant and bore Avraham a son in his old age,<br>	at the set-time of which God had spoken to him.3 	And Avraham called the name of his son, who was born to him, whom Sara bore to him:<br>	Yitzhak/He Laughs.4 	And Avraham circumcised Yitzhak his son at eight days old, as God had commanded him.5 	Now Avraham was a hundred years old when Yitzhak his son was born to him.6 	Now Sara said:<br>	God has made laughter for me,<br>	all who hear of it will laugh for me!7 	And she said:<br>	Who would have declared to Avraham:<br>	Sara will nurse sons?<br>	Well, I have borne him a son in his old age!8 	The child grew and was weaned,<br>	and Avraham made a great drinkfest on the day that Yitzhak was weaned.9 @ 	[Once] Sara saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian-woman, whom she had borne to Avraham, laughing. . . .10 	She said to Avraham:<br>	Drive out this maidservant and her son,<br>	for the son of this maidservant shall not share-inheritance with my son, with Yitzhak!11 	The matter was exceedingly bad in Avraham’s eyes because of his son.12 	But God said to Avraham:<br>	Do not let it be bad in your eyes concerning the lad and concerning your maidservant;<br>	in all that Sara says to you, hearken to her voice,<br>	for it is through Yitzhak that seed will be called by your [name].13 	But also the son of the maidservant—a nation will I make of him,<br>	for he is your seed.14 	Avraham started-early in the morning,<br>	he took some bread and a skin of water<br>	and gave them to Hagar—placing them upon her shoulder— together with the child and sent her away.<br>	She went off and roamed in the wilderness of Be’er-Sheva.15 	The water in the skin came to an end, so she threw the child under one of the bushes,16 	and went and sat by herself, at a distance, as far away as a bowshot,<br>	for she said [to herself]:<br>	Let me not see the child die!<br>	So she sat at a distance, and lifted up her voice and wept.17 	But God heard the voice of the lad;<br>	God’s messenger called to Hagar from heaven and said to her:<br>	What [ails] you, Hagar? Do not be afraid,<br>	for God has heard the voice of the lad there where he is.18 	Arise, lift up the lad and grasp him with your hand,<br>	for a great nation will I make of him!19 	God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water;<br>	she went, filled the skin with water, and gave the lad to drink.20 	And God was with the lad as he grew up;<br>	he settled in the wilderness, and became an archer, a bowman.21 	He settled in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took him a wife from the land of Egypt.22 @ 	It was at about that time that Avimelekh, together with Pikhol the commander of his army, said to Avraham, saying:<br>	God is with you in all that you do.23 	So now, swear to me here by God:<br>	If you should ever deal falsely with me, with my progeny and my posterity . . . !<br>	Rather, in loyalty, as I have dealt with you, deal with me, and with the land in which you have sojourned.24 	Avraham said:<br>	I so swear.25 	But Avraham rebuked Avimelekh<br>	because of a well of water that Avimelekh’s servants had seized.26 	Avimelekh said:<br>	I do not know who did this thing,<br>	nor have you ever told me, nor have I heard of it apart from today.27 	So Avraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Avimelekh,<br>	and the two of them cut a covenant.28 	Then Avraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock aside.29 	Avimelekh said to Avraham:<br>	What [mean] these seven ewe-lambs that you have set aside?30 	He said:<br>	Indeed, these seven ewe-lambs you should take from my hand,<br>	so that they may be a witness for me that I dug this well.31 	Therefore that place was called Be’er-Sheva/Well of the Seven-Swearing,<br>	for there the two of them swore [an oath].32 	Thus they cut a covenant in Be’er-Sheva.<br>	Then Avimelekh and Pikhol the commander of his army arose<br>	and returned to the land of the Philistines.33 	Now he planted a tamarisk in Be’er-Sheva<br>	and there he called out the name: <sc>Yhwh</sc> God of the Ages.34 	And Avraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines for many days.22:1 @ 	Now after these events it was<br>	that God tested Avraham<br>	and said to him:<br>	Avraham!<br>	He said:<br>	Here I am.2 	He said:<br>	Pray take your son,<br>	your only one,<br>	whom you love,<br>	Yitzhak,<br>	and go-you-forth to the land of Moriyya/Seeing,<br>	and offer him up there as an offering-up<br>	on one of the mountains<br>	that I will tell you of.3 	Avraham started-early in the morning;<br>	he saddled his donkey,<br>	he took his two serving-lads with him and Yitzhak his son,<br>	he split wood for the offering-up<br>	and arose and went to the place that God had told him of.4 	On the third day Avraham lifted up his eyes<br>	and saw the place from afar.5 	Avraham said to his lads:<br>	You stay here with the donkey,<br>	and I and the lad wish to go yonder;<br>	we wish to bow down and then return to you.6 	Avraham took the wood for the offering-up,<br>	and placed them upon Yitzhak his son,<br>	while in his hand he took the fire and the knife.<br>	Thus the two of them went together.7 	Yitzhak said to Avraham his father, he said:<br>	Father!<br>	He said:<br>	Here I am, my son.<br>	He said:<br>	Here are the fire and the wood,<br>	but where is the lamb for the offering-up?8 	Avraham said:<br>	God will see-for-himself to the lamb for the offering-up,<br>	my son.<br>	Thus the two of them went together.9 	They came to the place that God had told him of;<br>	there Avraham built the altar<br>	and arranged the wood<br>	and bound Yitzhak his son<br>	and placed him on the altar atop the wood.10 	And Avraham stretched out his hand,<br>	he took the knife to slaughter his son.11 	But <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> messenger called to him from heaven<br>	and said:<br>	Avraham! Avraham!<br>	He said:<br>	Here I am.12 	He said:<br>	Do not stretch out your hand against the lad,<br>	do not do anything to him!<br>	For now I know<br>	that you are in awe of God—<br>	you have not withheld your son, your only one, from me.13 	Avraham lifted up his eyes and saw:<br>	here, a ram caught behind in the thicket by its horns!<br>	Avraham went,<br>	he took the ram<br>	and offered it up as an offering-up in place of his son.14 	Avraham called the name of that place: <sc>Yhwh</sc> Sees.<br>	As the saying is today: On <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> mountain [it] is seen.15 	Now <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> messenger called to Avraham a second time from heaven16 	and said:<br>	By myself I swear<br>	—<sc>Yhwh’s</sc> utterance—<br>	indeed, because you have done this thing, have not withheld your son, your only one,17 	indeed, I will bless you, bless you,<br>	I will make your seed many, yes, many,<br>	like the stars of the heavens and like the sand that is on the shore of the sea;<br>	your seed shall possess the gate of their enemies,18 	and all the nations of the earth shall enjoy blessing through your seed,<br>	in consequence that you hearkened to my voice!19 	Avraham returned to his lads;<br>	they arose and went together to Be’er-Sheva.<br>	And Avraham stayed in Be’er-Sheva.20 @ 	Now after these events it was, that it was told to Avraham, saying:<br>	Here, Milca too has borne, sons to Nahor your brother:21 	Utz his firstborn and Buz his brother, Kemuel father of22 		Aram, /and Cesed, Hazo, Pildash, Yidlaf, and Betuel.23 	Now Betuel begot Rivka.—<br>	These eight Milca bore to Nahor, Avraham’s brother.24 	And his concubine—her name was Re’uma—bore too: Tevah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maakha.23:1 @ 	Now Sara’s life was one hundred years and twenty years and seven years, [thus] the years of Sara’s life.2 	Sara died in Arba-Town&mdash;that is Hevron, in the land of Canaan.<br>	Avraham set about to lament for Sara and to weep over her;3 	then Avraham arose from the presence of his dead<br>	and spoke to the Sons of Het, saying:4 	I am a sojourner settled among you;<br>	give me [title to] a burial holding among you,<br>	so that I may bury my dead from my presence.5 	The Sons of Het answered Avraham, saying to him:6 	Hear us, my lord!<br>	You are one exalted by God in our midst—<br>	in the choicest of our burial-sites you may bury your dead;<br>	no man among us will deny you his burial-site<br>	for burying your dead!7 	Avraham proceeded to bow low to the People of the Land, to the Sons of Het,8 	and spoke with them, saying:<br>	If it be then according to your wish<br>	that I bury my dead from my presence,<br>	hear me and interpose for me to Efron son of Tzohar,9 	that he may give me [title to] the cave of Makhpela, that is his, that is at the edge of his field;<br>	for the full silver-worth let him give me [title] in your midst for a burial holding.10 	Now Efron had a seat amidst the Sons of Het,<br>	and Efron the Hittite answered Avraham in the ears of the Sons of Het,<br>	of all who had entry to the council-gate of his city,<br>	saying:11 	Not so, my lord, hear me!<br>	The field I give to you,<br>	and the cave that is therein, to you I give it;<br>	before the eyes of the Sons of My People I give it to you—<br>	bury your dead!12 	Avraham bowed before the People of the Land13 	and spoke to Efron in the hearing of the People of the Land, saying:<br>	But if you yourself would only hear me out!<br>	I will give the silver-payment for the field;<br>	accept it from me,<br>	so that I may bury my dead there.14 	Efron answered Avraham, saying to him:15 	My lord—hear me!<br>	[A piece of] land worth four hundred silver weight,<br>	what is that between me and you!<br>	So your dead, bury!16 	Avraham hearkened to Efron:<br>	Avraham weighed out to Efron the silver-worth<br>	of which he had spoken in the hearing of the Sons of Het—<br>	four hundred silver weight at the going merchants’ rate.17 	Thus was established the field of Efron, that is in Makhpela, that faces Mamre,<br>	the field as well as the cave that is in it, and the trees that were in all the field, that were in all their territory round about,18 	for Avraham as an acquisition,<br>	before the eyes of the Sons of Het, of all who had entry to the council-gate of his city.19 	Afterward Avraham buried Sara his wife<br>	in the cave of the field of Makhpela, facing Mamre&mdash;that is Hevron, in the land of Canaan.20 	Thus was established the field as well as the cave that is in it for Avraham as a burial holding, from the Sons of Het.24:1 @ 	Now Avraham was old, advanced in days,<br>	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> had blessed Avraham in everything.2 	Avraham said to his servant, the elder of his household, who ruled over all that was his:<br>	Pray put your hand under my thigh!3 	I want you to swear by <sc>Yhwh</sc>, the God of Heaven and the God of Earth,<br>	that you will not take a wife for my son from the women of the Canaanites, among whom I am settled;4 	rather, you are to go to my land and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son, for Yitzhak.5 	The servant said to him:<br>	Perhaps the woman will not be willing to go after me to this land;<br>	may I then bring your son back there,<br>	back to the land from which you once went out?6 	Avraham said to him:<br>	Take you care that you do not ever bring my son back there!7 	<sc>Yhwh</sc>, the God of Heaven,<br>	who took me from my father’s house and from my kindred,<br>	who spoke to me,<br>	who swore to me, saying:<br>	I give this land to your seed—<br>	he himself will send his messenger on before you,<br>	so that you take a wife for my son from there.8 	Now if the woman is not willing to go after you,<br>	you will be clear from this sworn-oath of mine;<br>	only: You are not to bring my son back there!9 	The servant put his hand under the thigh of Avraham his lord,<br>	and swore to him [an oath] about this matter.10 @ 	The servant took ten camels from his lord’s camels and went, all kinds of good-things from his lord in his hand,<br>	and arose and went to Aram Of-Two-Rivers, to Nahor’s town.11 	He had the camels kneel outside the town at the water well<br>	at sunset, at the time when the water-drawers go out,12 	and said:<br>	O <sc>Yhwh</sc>, God of my lord Avraham,<br>	pray let it happen today for me, and deal in loyalty with my lord Avraham!13 	Here, I have stationed myself by the water spring as the women of the town go out to draw water.14 	May it be<br>	that the maiden to whom I say: Pray lower your pitcher that I may drink,<br>	and she says: Drink, and I will also give your camels to drink—<br>	let her be the one whom you have decided on for your servant, for Yitzhak,<br>	by means of her may I know that you have dealt in loyalty with my lord.15 	And it was: not yet had he finished speaking,<br>	when here, Rivka came out,<br>	who had been born to Betuel, son of Milca, wife of Nahor, brother of Avraham,<br>	her pitcher on her shoulder.16 	Now the maiden was exceedingly fair to look at,<br>	a nubile-girl—no man had known her.<br>	She went down to the spring, filled her pitcher and came up again.17 	And the servant ran to meet her and said:<br>	Pray let me sip a little water from your pitcher!18 	She said:<br>	Drink, my lord!<br>	And in haste she let down her pitcher on her arm and gave him to drink.19 	[When] she had finished giving him to drink, she said:<br>	I will also draw for your camels, until they have finished drinking.20 	And in haste she emptied her pitcher into the drinking-trough;<br>	then she ran to the well again to draw,<br>	and drew for all his camels.21 	The man kept staring at her,<br>	[waiting] silently to find out whether <sc>Yhwh</sc> had granted success to his journey or not.22 	It was, when the camels had finished drinking,<br>	that the man took a gold nose-ring, a half-coin in weight, and two bracelets for her wrists, ten gold-pieces in weight,23 	and said:<br>	Whose daughter are you? Pray tell me!<br>	And is there perhaps in your father’s house a place for us to spend the night?24 	She said to him:<br>	I am the daughter of Betuel, son of Milca, whom she bore to Nahor.25 	And she said to him:<br>	Yes, there is straw, yes, plenty of fodder with us, [and] yes, a place to spend the night!26 	The man did homage and bowed low before <sc>Yhwh</sc>27 	and said:<br>	Blessed be <sc>Yhwh</sc>, God of my lord Avraham,<br>	who has not relinquished his loyalty and his faithfulness from my lord!<br>	While as for me, <sc>Yhwh</sc> has led me on the journey to the house of my lord’s brothers!28 	The maiden ran and told her mother’s household according to these words.29 	Now Rivka had a brother, his name was Lavan.<br>	Lavan ran to the man, outside, to the spring,30 	and it was,<br>	as soon as he saw the nose-ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s wrists,<br>	and as soon as he heard Rivka his sister’s words, saying: Thus the man spoke to me,<br>	that he went out to the man—there, he was still standing by the camels, by the spring—31 	and said:<br>	Come, [you who are] blessed by <sc>Yhwh</sc>, why are you standing outside?<br>	I myself have cleared out the house and a place for the camels!32 	The man came into the house and unbridled the camels,<br>	and they gave straw and fodder to the camels<br>	and water for washing his feet and the feet of the men that were with him.33 	[Food] was put before him to eat, but he said:<br>	I will not eat until I have spoken my words.<br>	He said: Speak!34 	He said:<br>	I am Avraham’s servant.35 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> has blessed my lord exceedingly, so that he has become great:<br>	he has given him sheep and oxen, silver and gold, servants and maids, camels and donkeys.36 	Sara, my lord’s wife, bore my lord a son after she had grown old,<br>	and he has given him all that is his.37 	Now my lord had me swear, saying:<br>	You are not to take a wife for my son from the women of the Canaanites, in whose land I am settled!38 	No! To my father’s house you are to go, to my clan,<br>	and take a wife for my son.39 	I said to my lord:<br>	Perhaps the woman will not go after me!40 	He said to me:<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc>, in whose presence I have walked, will send his messenger with you;<br>	he will grant success to your journey,<br>	so that you take a wife for my son from my clan and from my father’s house.41 	Then will you be clear from my oath-curse:<br>	when you come to my clan,<br>	if they do not give her to you, you will be clear from my oath-curse.42 	So I came to the well today and said:<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc>, God of my lord Avraham,<br>	pray, if you wish to grant success to the journey on which I am going,43 	here, I have stationed myself by the water spring;<br>	may it be<br>	that the girl who comes out to draw,<br>	to whom I say: Pray give me a little water from your pitcher to drink,44 	and she says to me: You drink, and I will also draw for your camels—<br>	let her be the woman whom <sc>Yhwh</sc> has decided on for the son of my lord.45 	[And] I, even before I had finished speaking in my heart,<br>	here, Rivka came out, her pitcher on her shoulder,<br>	and she went down to the spring and drew.<br>	I said to her: Pray give me to drink!46 	And in haste she let down her pitcher from herself and said:<br>	Drink, and I will also give your camels to drink.<br>	I drank, and she also gave the camels to drink.47 	Then I asked her, I said: Whose daughter are you?<br>	She said: The daughter of Betuel, son of Nahor, whom Milca bore to him.<br>	So I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her wrists,48 	and I did homage and bowed low before <sc>Yhwh</sc>, and blessed <sc>Yhwh</sc>, God of my lord Avraham,<br>	who led me on the faithful journey to take the daughter of my lord’s brother for his son.49 	So now, if you wish to deal in loyalty and faithfulness with my lord, tell me,<br>	and if not, tell me,<br>	that I may turn right or left.50 	Lavan and Betuel answered, they said:<br>	The matter has gone out from <sc>Yhwh</sc>;<br>	we cannot speak anything to you, evil or good.51 	Here is Rivka before you;<br>	take her and go, that she may be a wife for the son of your lord,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> has spoken.52 	It was<br>	when Avraham’s servant heard their words, that he bowed low to the earth before <sc>Yhwh</sc>.53 	And the servant brought out objects of silver and objects of gold and garments, and gave them to Rivka,<br>	and he gave presents to her brother and to her mother.54 	They ate and drank, he and the men that were with him, and spent the night.<br>	They arose at daybreak, and he said:<br>	Send me off to my lord.55 	But her brother and her mother said:<br>	Let the girl stay with us a few days, perhaps ten; after that she may go.56 	He said to them:<br>	Do not delay me, for <sc>Yhwh</sc> has granted success to my journey;<br>	send me off, that I may go back to my lord.57 	They said:<br>	Let us call the girl and ask [for an answer from] her own mouth.58 	They called Rivka and said to her:<br>	Will you go with this man?<br>	She said:<br>	I will go.59 	So they sent off Rivka their sister with her nurse, and Avraham’s servant with his men,60 	and they gave Rivka farewell-blessing and said to her:<br>		Our sister, may you become thousandfold myriads!<br>		May your seed possess the gate of those who hate him!61 	Rivka and her maids arose, they mounted the camels and went after the man.<br>	And the servant took Rivka and went off.62 @ 	Now Yitzhak had gone out from where you come to the Well of the Living-One Seeing-Me, for he had settled in the Negev.63 	And Yitzhak went out to stroll in the field around the turning of sunset.<br>	He lifted up his eyes and saw: here, camels coming!64 	And Rivka lifted up her eyes and saw Yitzhak;65 	she got down from the camel and said to the servant:<br>	Who is the man over there that is walking in the field to meet us?<br>	The servant said:<br>	That is my lord.<br>	So she took a veil and covered herself.66 	And the servant recounted to Yitzhak all the things that he had done.67 	Yitzhak brought her into the tent of Sara his mother;<br>	he took Rivka and she became his wife, and he loved her.<br>	Thus was Yitzhak comforted after his mother.25:1 @ 	Now Avraham had taken another wife&mdash;her name was Ketura.2 	She bore him Zimran and Yokshan, Medan and Midyan, Yishbak and Shuah.3 	Yokshan begot Sheva and Dedan,<br>	Dedan’s sons: the Ashurites, the Letushites, and the Leummites.4 	Midyan’s sons: Efa, Efer, Hanokh, Avida, and Eldaa.<br>	All these, Ketura’s sons.5 	But Avraham gave over all that was his to Yitzhak.6 	And to the sons of the concubines that Avraham had, Avraham gave gifts, and he sent them away from Yitzhak his son while he was still alive, eastward, to the Eastland.7 @ 	Now these are the days [and] years of the life of Avraham, which he lived:8 	a hundred years and seventy years and five years; then he expired.<br>	Avraham died at a good ripe-age, old and satisfied [in days],<br>	and was gathered to his kinspeople.9 	Yitzhak and Yishmael his sons buried him, in the cave of Makhpela, in the field of Efron son of Tzohar the Hittite, that faces Mamre,10 	the field that Avraham had acquired from the Sons of Het.<br>	There were buried Avraham and Sara his wife.11 @ 	Now it was after Avraham’s death, that God blessed Yitzhak his son.<br>	And Yitzhak settled by the Well of the Living-One Seeing-Me.12 @ 	Now these are the begettings of Yishmael son of Avraham, whom Hagar the Egyptian-woman, Sara’s maid, bore to Avraham.13 	And these are the names of the sons of Yishmael, by their names after [the order of] their begettings:14 	Yishmael’s firstborn, Nevayot; and Kedar, Adbe’el, Mivsam, Mishma, Duma, Massa,15 	Hadad and Teima, Yetur, Nafish and Kedma.16 	These are the sons of Yishmael, these their names, in their farmsteads and in their corrals,<br>	twelve leaders for their tribes.17 	And these are the years of the life of Yishmael: a hundred years and thirty years and seven years; then he expired.<br>	He died and was gathered to his kinspeople.18 	Now they dwelt from Havila to Shur, which faces Egypt, back to where you come toward Assyria;<br>	in the presence of all his brothers did [his inheritance] fall.19 @ 	Now these are the begettings of Yitzhak, son of Avraham.<br>	Avraham begot Yitzhak.20 	Yitzhak was forty years old when he took Rivka daughter of Betuel the Aramean, from Paddan Aram, sister of Lavan the Aramean, for himself as a wife.21 		Yitzhak entreated <sc>Yhwh</sc> on behalf of his wife, for she was barren,<br>	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> granted-his-entreaty:<br>	Rivka his wife became pregnant.22 	But the children [almost] crushed one another inside her,<br>	so she said:<br>	If so,<br>	why do I exist?<br>	And she went to inquire of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.23 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to her:<br>		Two nations are in your belly,<br>		two tribes from your body shall be divided;<br>		tribe shall be mightier than tribe,<br>		elder shall be servant to younger!24 	Her days were fulfilled for bearing, and here, twins were in her body!25 	The first one came out ruddy, like a hairy mantle all over,<br>	so they called his name: Esav/Rough-One.26 	After that his brother came out, his hand grasping Esav’s heel,<br>	so they called his name: Yaakov/Heel-Holder.<br>	Now Yitzhak was sixty years old when she bore them.27 	The lads grew up:<br>	Esav became a man knowing the hunt, a man of the open-field,<br>	while Yaakov was a plain man, staying among the tents.28 	Yitzhak grew to love Esav, for [he brought] hunted-game for his mouth,<br>	but Rivka loved Yaakov.29 @ 	[Once] Yaakov was boiling boiled-stew,<br>	and Esav came in from the field, and he was weary.30 	Esav said to Yaakov:<br>	Pray give me a gulp of the red-stuff, that red-stuff,<br>	for I am so weary!<br>	Therefore they called his name: Edom/Red-One.31 	Yaakov said:<br>	Sell me your firstborn-right here-and-now.32 	Esav said:<br>	Here, I am on my way to dying, so what [good] to me now is a firstborn-right?33 	Yaakov said:<br>	Swear to me here-and-now.<br>	He swore to him and sold his firstborn-right to Yaakov.34 	Yaakov gave Esav bread and boiled lentils;<br>	he ate and drank and arose and went off.<br>	Thus did Esav despise the firstborn-right.26:1 @ 	Now there was a famine in the land, aside from the former famine which there had been in the days of Avraham,<br>	so Yitzhak went to Avimelekh, king of the Philistines, to Gerar.2 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> was seen by him and said:<br>	Do not go down to Egypt;<br>	[continue to] dwell in the land that I tell you of.3 	Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you and will give you blessing—<br>	for to you and to your seed I give all these lands<br>	and will fulfill the sworn-oath that I swore to Avraham your father:4 	I will make your seed many, like the stars of the heavens,<br>	and to your seed I will give all these lands;<br>	all the nations of the earth shall enjoy blessing through your seed—5 	in consequence that Avraham hearkened to my voice<br>	and kept my charge: my commandments, my laws, and my instructions.6 	So Yitzhak stayed in Gerar.7 @ 	The men of the place asked about his wife, and he said: She is my sister,<br>	for he was afraid to say: my wife—<br>	[thinking]: Otherwise the people of the place will kill me on account of Rivka, for she is fair to look at!8 	But it was, when he had been there a long time,<br>	that Avimelekh, king of the Philistines, looked out through a window<br>	and saw: there was Yitzhak laughing-and-loving with Rivka his wife!9 	Avimelekh had Yitzhak called and said:<br>	But here, she must be your wife!<br>	Now how could you say: She is my sister?<br>	Yitzhak said to him:<br>	Indeed, I said to myself: Otherwise I will die on account of her!10 	Avimelekh said:<br>	What is this that you have done to us!<br>	One of the people might well have lain with your wife,<br>	and then you would have brought guilt upon us!11 	And Avimelekh commanded the entire people, saying:<br>	Whoever touches this man or his wife must be put to death, yes, death!12 @ 	Yitzhak sowed in that land, and reaped in that year a hundred measures;<br>	thus did <sc>Yhwh</sc> bless him.13 	The man became great [in wealth], and went on, went on becoming greater, until he was exceedingly great:14 	he had herds of sheep and herds of oxen and a large retinue-of-servants,<br>	and the Philistines envied him.15 	And all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of Avraham his father, the Philistines stopped up and filled with earth.16 	Avimelekh said to Yitzhak:<br>	Go away from us, for you have become exceedingly mightier [in number] than we!17 	So Yitzhak went from there, he encamped in the wadi of Gerar<br>		and settled there.18 	Yitzhak again dug up the wells of water which had been dug in the days of Avraham his father, the Philistines having stopped them up after Avraham’s death,<br>	and he called them by the names, the same names, by which his father had called them.19 	Yitzhak’s servants also dug in the wadi, and found there a well of living water.20 	Now the shepherds of Gerar quarreled with the shepherds of Yitzhak, saying: The water is ours!<br>	So he called the name of the well: Esek/Bickering, because they had bickered with him.21 	They dug another well, and quarreled also over it,<br>	so he called its name: Sitna/Animosity.22 	He moved on from there and dug another well, but they did not quarrel over it,<br>	so he called its name: Rehovot/Space,<br>	and said: Indeed, now <sc>Yhwh</sc> has made space for us, so that we may bear fruit in the land!23 	He went up from there to Be’er-Sheva.24 @ 	Now <sc>Yhwh</sc> was seen by him on that night and said:<br>	I am the God of Avraham your father.<br>	Do not be afraid, for I am with you,<br>	I will bless you and will make your seed many, for the sake of Avraham my servant.25 	He built an altar there<br>	and called out the name of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.<br>	He spread his tent there, and Yitzhak’s servants excavated a well there.26 	Now Avimelekh went to him from Gerar, along with Ahuzzat his aide and Pikhol the commander of his armed-forces.27 	Yitzhak said to them:<br>	For-what-reason have you come to me?<br>	For you hate me and have sent me away from you!28 	They said:<br>	We have seen, yes, seen that <sc>Yhwh</sc> has been with you,<br>	so we say: Pray let there be an oath-curse between us, between us and you;<br>	we want to cut a covenant with you:29 	if ever you should deal badly with us . . . !<br>	Just as we have not harmed you and just as we have only dealt well with you and have sent you away in peace—<br>	you are now blessed by <sc>Yhwh</sc>!30 	He made them a drinkfest, and they ate and drank.31 	Early in the morning they swore [an oath] to one another;<br>	then Yitzhak sent them off, and they went from him in peace.32 	Now it was on that same day<br>	that Yitzhak’s servants came and told him about the well that they had been digging;<br>	they said to him: We have found water!33 	So he called it: Shiv’a/Swearing-Seven;<br>	therefore the name of the city is Be’er-Sheva until this day.34 @ 	[When] Esav was forty years old, he took to wife Yehudit daughter of B’eri the Hittite and Ba’semat daughter of Elon the Hittite.35 	And they were a bitterness of spirit to Yitzhak and Rivka.27:1 @ 	Now when Yitzhak was old and his eyes had become too dim for seeing,<br>	he called Esav, his elder son, and said to him:<br>	My son!<br>	He said to him:<br>	Here I am.2 	He said:<br>	Now here, I have grown old, and do not know the day of my death.3 	So-now, pray pick up your weapons—your hanging-quiver and your bow,<br>	go out into the field and hunt me down some hunted-game,4 	and make me a tasty-dish, such as I love;<br>	bring it to me, and I will eat it,<br>	that I may give you my own blessing before I die.5 	Now Rivka was listening as Yitzhak spoke to Esav his son,<br>	and Esav went off into the fields to hunt down hunted-game to bring [to him],6 	so Rivka said to Yaakov her son, saying:<br>	Here, I was listening as your father spoke to Esav your brother, saying:7 	Bring me some hunted-game and make me a tasty-dish, I will eat it<br>	and give you blessing before <sc>Yhwh</sc>, before my death.8 	So now, my son, listen to my voice, to what I command you:9 	pray go to the flock and take me two fine goats’ kids from there,<br>	I will make them into a tasty-dish for your father, such as he loves;10 	you bring it to your father, and he will eat,<br>	so that he may give you blessing before his death.11 	Yaakov said to Rivka his mother:<br>	Here, Esav my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man;12 	perhaps my father will feel me—then I will be like a trickster in his eyes,<br>	and I will bring a curse and not a blessing on myself!13 	His mother said to him:<br>	On me be your curse, my son!<br>	Only: listen to my voice and go, take them for me.14 	He went and took and brought them to his mother, and his mother made a tasty-dish, such as his father loved.15 	Rivka then took the garments of Esav, her elder son, the choicest ones that were with her in the house,16 	and clothed Yaakov, her younger son,<br>	and with the skins of the goats’ kids, she clothed his hands and the smooth-parts of his neck.17 	Then she placed the tasty-dish and the bread that she had made in the hand of Yaakov her son.18 	He came to his father and said:<br>	Father!<br>	He said:<br>	Here I am. Which one are you, my son?19 	Yaakov said to his father:<br>	I am Esav, your firstborn.<br>	I have done as you spoke to me;<br>	pray arise, sit and eat from my hunted-game,<br>	that you may give me your own blessing.20 	Yitzhak said to his son:<br>	How ever did you find it so hastily, my son?<br>	He said: Indeed, <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God made it happen for me!21 	Yitzhak said to Yaakov:<br>	Pray come closer, that I may feel you, my son,<br>	whether you are really my son Esav or not.22 	Yaakov moved closer to Yitzhak his father.<br>	He felt him and said:<br>	The voice is Yaakov’s voice, yet the hands are Esav’s hands—23 	but he did not recognize him, for his hands were like the hands of Esav his brother, hairy.<br>	Now he was about to bless him,24 	[when] he said:<br>	Are you he, my son Esav?<br>	He said:<br>	I am.25 	So he said: Bring it close to me, and I will eat from the hunted-game of my son,<br>	in order that I may give you my own blessing.<br>	He put it close to him and he ate;<br>	he brought him wine and he drank.26 	Then Yitzhak his father said to him:<br>	Pray come close and kiss me, my son!27 	He came close and kissed him.<br>	Now he smelled the smell of his garments<br>	and blessed him and said:<br>	See, the smell of my son<br>	is like the smell of a field<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> has blessed.28 		So may God give you<br>		from the dew of the heavens,<br>		from the fat of the earth,<br>		[along with] much grain and new-wine!29 		May peoples serve you,<br>		may tribes bow down to you;<br>		be master to your brothers,<br>		may your mother’s sons bow down to you!<br>		Those who damn you, damned!<br>		Those who bless you, blessed!30 	Now it was, when Yitzhak had finished blessing Yaakov,<br>	yes it was—Yaakov had just gone out, out from the presence of Yitzhak his father—<br>	that Esav his brother came back from his hunting.31 	He too made a tasty-dish and brought it to his father.<br>	He said to his father:<br>	Let my father arise and eat from the hunted-game of his son,<br>	that you may give me your own blessing.32 	Yitzhak his father said to him:<br>	Which one are you?<br>	He said:<br>	I am your son, your firstborn, Esav.33 	Yitzhak trembled with exceedingly great trembling<br>	and said:<br>	Who then was he<br>	that hunted down hunted-game and brought it to me—I ate it all before you came<br>	and I gave him my blessing!<br>	Now blessed he must remain!34 	When Esav heard the words of his father,<br>	he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry,<br>	and said to his father:<br>	Bless me, me also, Father!35 	He said:<br>	Your brother came with deceit and took away your blessing.36 	He said:<br>	Is that why his name was called Yaakov/Heel-Sneak? For he has now sneaked against me twice:<br>	my firstborn-right he took, and now he has taken my blessing!<br>	And he said:<br>	Haven’t you reserved a blessing for me?37 	Yitzhak answered, saying to Esav:<br>	Here, I have made him master to you,<br>	and all his brothers I have given him as servants,<br>	with grain and new-wine I have invested him—<br>	so for you, what then can I do, my son?38 	Esav said to his father:<br>	Have you [only] a single blessing, Father?<br>	Bless me, me also, Father!<br>	And Esav lifted up his voice and wept.39 	Then Yitzhak his father answered, saying to him:<br>		Here, from the fat of the earth<br>		must be your dwelling-place,<br>		from the dew of the heavens above.40 		You will live by your sword,<br>		you will serve your brother!<br>		But it will be<br>		that when you brandish it,<br>		you will tear his yoke from your neck.41 	Now Esav held a grudge against Yaakov because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him;<br>	Esav said in his heart:<br>	Let the days of mourning for my father draw near<br>	and [then] I will kill Yaakov my brother!42 	Rivka was told of the words of Esav, her elder son.<br>	So she sent and called for Yaakov, her younger son,<br>	and said to him:<br>	Here, Esav your brother is consoling himself about you, with [the thought of] killing you.43 	So now, my son, listen to my voice:<br>	arise and flee to Lavan my brother in Harran,44 	and stay with him for some time, until your brother’s fury has turned away,45 	until his anger turns away from you and he forgets what you did to him.<br>	Then I will send and have you taken from there—<br>	for should I be bereaved of you both in a single day?46 	So Rivka said to Yitzhak:<br>	I loathe my life because of those Hittite women;<br>	if Yaakov should take a wife from the Hittite women—like these, from the women of the land,<br>	why should I have life?28:1 	So Yitzhak called for Yaakov;<br>	he blessed him and charged him, saying to him:<br>	You are not to take a wife from the women of Canaan.2 	Arise, go to Paddan Aram, to the house of Betuel, your mother’s father,<br>	and take yourself a wife from there, from the daughters of Lavan, your mother’s brother.3 	May God Shaddai bless you,<br>	may he make you bear fruit and make you many,<br>	so that you become a host of peoples.4 	And may he give you the blessing of Avraham,<br>	to you and to your seed with you,<br>	for you to inherit the land of your sojournings,<br>	which God gave to Avraham.5 	So Yitzhak sent Yaakov off;<br>	he went to Paddan Aram, to Lavan son of Betuel the Aramean,<br>	the brother of Rivka, the mother of Yaakov and Esav.6 @ 	Now Esav saw<br>	that Yitzhak had given Yaakov farewell-blessing and had sent him off to Paddan Aram, to take himself a wife from there,<br>	[and that] when he had given him blessing, he had charged him, saying: You are not to take a wife from the women of Canaan!7 	And Yaakov had listened to his father and his mother and had gone to Paddan Aram.8 	And Esav saw<br>	that the women of Canaan were bad in the eyes of Yitzhak his father,9 	so Esav went to Yishmael and took Mahalat daughter of Yishmael son of Avraham, sister of Nevayot, in addition to his wives as a wife for him.10 @ 	Yaakov went out from Be’er-Sheva and went toward Harran,11 	and encountered a certain place.<br>	He had to spend the night there, for the sun had come in.<br>	He took one of the stones of the place<br>	and set it at his head<br>	and lay down in that place.12 	And he dreamt:<br>	here, a stairway was set up on the earth,<br>	its top reaching the heavens,<br>	and here, messengers of God were going up and down on it.13 	And here,<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> was standing over against him.<br>	He said:<br>	I am <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	the God of Avraham your father and the God of Yitzhak.<br>	The land on which you lie<br>	I give to you and to your seed.14 	Your seed will be like the dust of the earth;<br>	you will burst forth, to the Sea, to the east, to the north, to the Negev.<br>	All the clans of the soil will find blessing through you and through your seed!15 	Here, I am with you;<br>	I will watch over you wherever you go<br>	and will bring you back to this ground;<br>	indeed, I will not leave you<br>	until I have done what I have spoken to you.16 	Yaakov awoke from his sleep<br>	and said:<br>	Why,<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> is in this place,<br>	and I, I did not know it!17 	He was awestruck and said:<br>	How awe-inspiring is this place!<br>	This is none other than a house of God,<br>	and that is the gate of heaven!18 	Yaakov started-early in the morning,<br>	he took the stone that he had set at his head<br>	and set it up as a standing-pillar<br>	and poured oil on top of it.19 	And he called the name of the place: Bet-El/House of God—<br>	however, Luz was the name of the city in former times.20 	And Yaakov vowed a vow, saying:<br>	If God will be with me<br>	and will watch over me on this way that I go<br>	and will give me food to eat and a garment to wear,21 	and if I come back in peace to my father’s house—<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> shall be God to me,22 	and this stone that I have set up as a standing-pillar shall become a house of God,<br>	and everything that you give me<br>	I shall tithe, tithe it to you.29:1 	Yaakov lifted his feet and went to the land of the Easterners.2 	He looked around him, and there: a well in the field, and there were three herds of sheep crouching near it,<br>	for from that well they used to give the herds to drink.<br>	Now the stone on the mouth of the well was large,3 	so when all the herds were gathered there,<br>	they used to roll the stone from the mouth of the well, give the sheep to drink, and put the stone back on the mouth of the well in its place.4 	Now Yaakov said to them:<br>	Brothers, where are you from?<br>	They said:<br>	We are from Harran.5 	He said to them:<br>	Do you know Lavan, son of Nahor?<br>	They said:<br>	We know him.6 	He said to them:<br>	Is all well with him?<br>	They said:<br>	It is well—<br>	and here comes Rahel his daughter with the sheep!7 	He said:<br>	Indeed, it is still broad daylight,<br>	it is not time to gather in the livestock,<br>	so give the sheep to drink and go back, tend them.8 	But they said:<br>	We cannot, until all the herds have been gathered;<br>	only then do they roll the stone from the mouth of the well, and then we give the sheep to drink.9 	While he was still speaking with them,<br>	Rahel came with the sheep that were her father’s<br>	—for she was a shepherdess.10 	Now it was when Yaakov saw Rahel, the daughter of Lavan his mother’s brother,<br>	and the sheep of Lavan his mother’s brother,<br>	that Yaakov came close,<br>	he rolled the stone from the mouth of the well<br>	and gave drink to the sheep of Lavan his mother’s brother.11 	Then Yaakov kissed Rahel, and lifted up his voice and wept.12 	And Yaakov told Rahel<br>	that he was her father’s brother and that he was Rivka’s son.<br>	She ran and told her father.13 	Now it was, as soon as Lavan heard the tidings concerning Yaakov, his sister’s son,<br>	that he ran to meet him, embraced him and kissed him, and brought him into his house.<br>	And he recounted all these events to Lavan.14 	Lavan said to him:<br>	Without doubt you are my bone, my flesh!<br>	And he stayed with him the days of a month.15 @ 	Lavan said to Yaakov:<br>	Because you are my brother, should you serve me for nothing?<br>	Tell me, what shall your wages be?16 	Now Lavan had two daughters: the name of the elder was Le’a, the name of the younger was Rahel.17 	Le’a’s eyes were delicate, but Rahel was beautiful of form and beautiful of appearance.18 	And Yaakov fell in love with Rahel.<br>	He said:<br>	I will serve you seven years for Rahel, your younger daughter.19 	Lavan said:<br>	My giving her to you is better than my giving her to another man;<br>	stay with me.20 	So Yaakov served seven years for Rahel,<br>	yet they were in his eyes as but a few days, because of his love for her.21 	Then Yaakov said to Lavan:<br>	Come-now, [give me] my wife, for my days-of-labor have been fulfilled,<br>	so that I may come in to her.22 	Lavan gathered all the people of the place together and made a drinkfest.23 	Now in the evening<br>	he took Le’a his daughter and brought her to him,<br>	and he came in to her.24 	Lavan also gave her Zilpa his maid,<br>	for Le’a his daughter as a maid.25 	Now in the morning:<br>	here, she was Le’a!<br>	He said to Lavan:<br>	What, now, have you done to me?<br>	Was it not for Rahel that I served you?<br>	Why have you deceived me?26 	Lavan said:<br>	Such is not done in our place, giving away the younger before the firstborn;27 	fill out the bridal-week for this one, and we shall give you that one also,<br>	for the service which you will serve me for yet another seven years.28 	Yaakov did so—he fulfilled the bridal-week for this one,<br>	and he gave him Rahel his daughter as a wife.29 	And Lavan also gave Rahel his daughter Bilha his maid,<br>	for her as a maid.30 	So he came in to Rahel also,<br>	and he loved Rahel also,<br>	more than Le’a.<br>	Then he served him for yet another seven years.31 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> saw that Le’a was hated,<br>	so he opened her womb,<br>	while Rahel was barren.32 	And Le’a became pregnant and bore a son;<br>	she called his name: Re’uven/See, a Son!<br>	for she said:<br>	Indeed, <sc>Yhwh</sc> has seen my being afflicted,<br>	indeed, now my husband will love me!33 	She became pregnant again and bore a son,<br>	and said:<br>	Indeed, <sc>Yhwh</sc> has heard that I am hated,<br>	so he has given me this one as well!<br>	And she called his name: Shim’on/Hearing.34 	She became pregnant again and bore a son,<br>	and said:<br>	Now this time my husband will be joined to me,<br>	for I have borne him three sons!<br>	Therefore they called his name: Levi/Joining.35 	She became pregnant again and bore a son,<br>	and said:<br>	This time I will give thanks to <sc>Yhwh</sc>!<br>	Therefore she called his name: Yehuda/Giving-Thanks.<br>	Then she stopped giving birth.30:1 @ 	Rahel saw that she could not bear [children] to Yaakov,<br>	and Rahel envied her sister.<br>	She said to Yaakov:<br>	Come-now, [give] me children!<br>	If not, I will die!2 	Yaakov’s anger flared up against Rahel;<br>	he said:<br>	Am I in place of God,<br>	who has denied you fruit of the belly?3 	She said:<br>	Here is my slave-girl Bilha;<br>	come in to her,<br>	that she may give birth upon my knees, that I too may be built-up-with-sons through her.4 	She gave him Bilha her maid as a wife,<br>	and Yaakov came in to her.5 	And Bilha became pregnant and bore Yaakov a son.6 	Rahel said:<br>	God has done-me-justice; yes, he has heard my voice!<br>	He has given me a son!<br>	Therefore she called his name: Dan/He-Has-Done-Justice.7 	And Bilha, Rahel’s maid, became pregnant again and bore a second son to Yaakov.8 	Rahel said:<br>	A struggle of God have I struggled with my sister; yes, I have prevailed!<br>	So she called his name: Naftali/My Struggle.9 @ 	Le’a saw that she had stopped giving birth,<br>	so she took Zilpa her maid and gave her to Yaakov as a wife.10 	And Zilpa, Le’a’s maid, bore Yaakov a son.11 	Le’a said:<br>	What fortune!<br>	So she called his name: Gad/Fortune.12 	And Zilpa, Le’a’s maid, bore a second son to Yaakov.13 	Le’a said:<br>	What happiness!<br>	For women will deem me happy.<br>	So she called his name: Asher/Happiness.14 @ 	Re’uven went in the days of the wheat-harvest and found some love-apples in the field,<br>	and brought them to Le’a his mother.<br>	Rahel said to Le’a:<br>	Pray give me some of your son’s love-apples!15 	She said to her:<br>	Is your taking away my husband such a small thing<br>	that you would now take away my son’s love-apples?<br>	Rahel said:<br>	Very well, he may lie with you tonight in exchange for your son’s love-apples.16 	Yaakov came home from the field in the evening, and Le’a went out to meet him and said:<br>	You must come in to me,<br>	for I have hired, yes, hired you for my son’s love-apples.<br>	So he lay with her that night.17 	And God hearkened to Le’a,<br>	so that she became pregnant and bore Yaakov a fifth son.18 	Le’a said:<br>	God has given me my hired-wages,<br>	because I gave my maid to my husband!<br>	So she called his name: Yissakhar/There-Is-Hire.19 	Once again Le’a became pregnant, and she bore a sixth son to Yaakov.20 	Le’a said:<br>	God has presented me with a good present,<br>	this time my husband will prize me,<br>	for I have borne him six sons!<br>	So she called his name: Zevulun/Prince.21 	Afterward she bore a daughter, and called her name: Dina.22 @ 	But God kept Rahel in mind;<br>	God hearkened to her and opened her womb,23 	so that she became pregnant and bore a son.<br>	She said:<br>	God has removed/<i>asaf</i><br>	my reproach!24 	And she called his name: Yosef,<br>	saying:<br>	May <sc>Yhwh</sc> add/<i>yosef</i><br>	another son to me!25 	Now it was, once Rahel had borne Yosef, that Yaakov said to Lavan:<br>	Send me free, that I may go back to my place, to my land;26 	give over my wives and my children,<br>	for whom I have served you,<br>	for I [wish to] go.<br>	Indeed, you yourself know my service that I have served you!27 	Lavan said to him:<br>	Pray, if I have found favor in your eyes . . .<br>	I have become wealthy,<br>	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> has blessed me on account of you.28 	And he said: Specify the wages due you from me, and I will give [them] to you.29 	He said to him:<br>	You yourself know<br>	how I have served you,<br>	and how it has gone with your livestock in my keeping.30 	For you had but few before me,<br>	and they have since burst out into a multitude.<br>	Thus has <sc>Yhwh</sc> blessed you at my [every] step!<br>	But now, when may I too do something for my household?31 	He said:<br>	What shall I give you?<br>	Yaakov said: <br>	You are not to give me anything—<br>	only do this thing for me,<br>	then I will return, I will tend your flock, I will keep watch:32 	let me go over your whole flock today<br>	removing from there every speckled and dappled head,<br>	and every dark head among the lambs, and each dappled and speckled one among the goats—they shall be my wages.33 	And may my honesty plead for me on a future day:<br>	when you come-to-check my wages [that are] before you,<br>	whatever is not speckled or dappled among the goats, or dark among the lambs,<br>	[will be considered] as stolen by me.34 	Lavan said:<br>	Good, let it be according to your words.35 	And on that day he removed the streaked and dappled he-goats<br>	and every speckled and dappled she-goat, every one that had any white on it,<br>	and every dark one among the lambs,<br>	and handed them over to his sons.36 	Then he put a three-days’ journey between himself and Yaakov.<br>	Now Yaakov was tending Lavan’s remaining flock.37 	And Yaakov took himself rods from moist poplar, almond, and plane trees<br>	and peeled white peelings in them, exposing the white that was on the rods;38 	then he presented the rods that he had peeled in the gutters, in the water troughs where the flock would come to drink, in front of the flock.<br>	Now they would be in heat as they came to drink;39 	so the flock came to be in heat by the rods,<br>	and the flock bore streaked, speckled, and dappled [young].40 	But the sheep, Yaakov set apart,<br>	and gave position among the flock to [each] streaked one and every dark one among Lavan’s flocks;<br>	thus he made special herds for himself, but did not make them for Lavan’s flock.41 	So it was that whenever the robust flock-animals were in heat,<br>	Yaakov would put the rods in sight of the flock-animals, in the gutters, to make them be in heat next to the rods.42 	But when the flock-animals were feeble, he would not put them there.<br>	And so it was that the feeble ones became Lavan’s, and the robust ones, Yaakov’s.43 	The man burst forth [with wealth] exceedingly, yes, exceedingly&mdash;he came to have many flock-animals and maids and servants, and camels and donkeys.31:1 @ 	Now he heard the words of Lavan’s sons, [that they] said:<br>	Yaakov has taken away all that was our father’s,<br>	and from what was our father’s he has made all this weighty-wealth!2 	And Yaakov saw by Lavan’s face:<br>	here, he was no longer with him as yesterday [and the] day-before.3 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Yaakov:<br>	Return to the land of your fathers, to your kindred!<br>	I will be with you!4 	So Yaakov sent and had Rahel and Le’a called to the field, to his animals,5 	and said to them:<br>	I see by your father’s face<br>	that indeed, he is no longer toward me as yesterday [and] the day-before.<br>	But the God of my father has been with me!6 	You yourselves know that I have served your father with all my might,7 	but your father has duped me and changed my wages ten times over,<br>	yet God has not allowed him to do me ill.8 	If he said thus: The speckled ones shall be your wages,<br>	all the animals would bear speckled ones,<br>	and if he said thus: The streaked ones shall be your wages,<br>	all the animals would bear streaked ones.9 	So God has snatched away your father’s livestock and given them to me.10 	Now it was at the time of the animals’ being in heat<br>	that I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream:<br>	here, all the he-goats that mount the animals—streaked, speckled, and spotted!11 	And God’s messenger said to me in the dream: Yaakov!<br>	I said: Here I am.12 	He said:<br>	Pray lift up your eyes and see:<br>	all the he-goats that mount the animals—streaked, speckled, and spotted!<br>	For I have seen all that Lavan is doing to you.13 	I am the God of Bet-El,<br>	where you anointed the pillar,<br>	where you vowed a vow to me.<br>	So now, arise,<br>	get out of this land,<br>	return to the land of your kindred!14 	Rahel and Le’a answered him, they said to him:<br>	Do we still have a share, an inheritance in our father’s house?15 	Is it not as strangers that we are thought of by him?<br>	For he has sold us and eaten up, yes, eaten up our purchase-price!16 	Indeed, all the riches that God has snatched away from our father—<br>	they belong to us and to our children.<br>	So now, whatever God has said to you, do!17 	So Yaakov arose, he lifted his children and his wives onto the camels18 	and led away all his livestock, all his property that he had gained,<br>	the acquired-livestock of his own acquiring which he had gained in Paddan Aram,<br>	to come home to Yitzhak his father in the land of Canaan.19 	Now Lavan had gone to shear his flock;<br>	Rahel, meanwhile, stole the <i>terafim</i> that belonged to her father.20 	Now Yaakov stole the wits of Lavan the Aramean,<br>	by not telling him that he was about to flee.21 	And flee he did, he and all that was his;<br>	he arose and crossed the River, and set his face toward the highlands of Gil’ad.22 	Lavan was told on the third day that Yaakov had fled;23 	he took his tribal-brothers with him and pursued him, a seven-days’ journey,<br>	and caught up with him in the highlands of Gil’ad.24 	But God came to Lavan the Aramean in a dream of the night<br>	and said to him:<br>	Take you care,<br>	lest you speak to Yaakov, good or ill!25 	Lavan caught up with Yaakov,<br>	—Yaakov had pegged his tent in the highlands, and Lavan along with his brothers had pegged [his tent] in the highlands of Gil’ad—26 	and Lavan said to Yaakov:<br>	What did you mean to do<br>	by stealing my wits and leading my daughters away like captives of the sword?27 	Why did you secretly flee and steal away on me, without even telling me,<br>	—for I would have sent you off with joy and with song, with drum and with lyre—28 	and you did not even allow me to kiss my grandchildren and my daughters?<br>	Now you have done foolishly!29 	It lies in my hand’s power to do [all of] you ill!<br>	But yesterday night the God of your father said to me, saying:<br>	Take you care<br>	from speaking to Yaakov, good or ill!30 	Well now, you had to go, yes, go, since you longed, longed for your father’s house—<br>	why did you steal my gods?31 	Yaakov answered and said to Lavan:<br>	Indeed, I was afraid, for I said to myself: Perhaps you will even rob me of your daughters!32 	With whomever you find your gods, he shall not live;<br>	here in front of our brothers, [see if] you recognize anything of yours with me, and take it!<br>	Yaakov did not know that Rahel had stolen them.33 	Lavan came into Yaakov’s tent and into Le’a’s tent and into the tent of the two maids, but he did not find [them].<br>	Then he went out of Lea’s tent and came into Rahel’s tent.34 	Now Rahel had taken the <i>terafim</i> and had put them in the basket-saddle of the camels, and had sat down upon them.<br>	Lavan felt all around the tent, but he did not find [them].35 	She said to her father:<br>	Do not let upset be in my lord’s eyes that I am not able to rise in your presence,<br>	for the way of women is upon me!<br>	So he searched, but he did not find the <i>terafim.</i>36 	Now Yaakov became upset and took up quarrel with Lavan,<br>	Yaakov spoke up, saying to Lavan:<br>	What is my offense, what is my sin,<br>	that you have dashed hotly after me,37 	that you have felt all through my wares?<br>	What have you found from all your household wares?<br>	Set it here in front of your brothers and my brothers,<br>	that they may decide between us two!38 	It is twenty years now that I have been under you:<br>	your ewes and your she-goats have never miscarried,<br>	the rams from your flock I never have eaten,39 	none torn-by-beasts have I ever brought you—<br>	I would make good the loss,<br>	at my hand you would seek it,<br>	stolen by day or stolen by night.40 	[Thus] I was:<br>	by day, parching-heat consumed me, and cold by night,<br>	and my sleep eluded my eyes.41 	It is twenty years for me now in your house:<br>	I have served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your animals,<br>	yet you have changed my wages ten times over.42 	Had not the God of my father,<br>	the God of Avraham and the Terror of Yitzhak,<br>	been for me,<br>	indeed, you would have sent me off now empty-handed!<br>	But God has seen my being afflicted and the toil of my hands,<br>	and yesterday night he decided.43 	Lavan answered; he said to Yaakov:<br>	The daughters are my daughters,<br>	the children are my children,<br>	the animals are my animals—<br>	all that you see, it is mine!<br>	But to my daughters—what can I do to them today, or to their children whom they have borne?44 	So-now, come,<br>	let us cut a covenant, I and you,<br>	and let [something here] serve as a witness between me and you.45 	Yaakov took a stone and erected it as a standing-pillar.46 	And Yaakov said to his brothers:<br>	Collect stones!<br>	They fetched stones and made a mound.<br>	And they ate there by the mound.47 	Lavan called it: <i>Yegar Sahaduta,</i><br>	while Yaakov called it: Gal-Ed.48 	Lavan said:<br>	This mound is witness between me and you from today.<br>	Therefore they called its name: Gal-Ed/Mound-Witness,49 	and: Mitzpa/Guardpost,<br>	because he said:<br>	May <sc>Yhwh</sc> keep guard between me and you, when we are hidden from one another!50 	If you should ever afflict my daughters,<br>	if you should ever take wives besides my daughters . . . !<br>	No man is here with us,<br>	[but] see, God is witness between me and you!51 	And Lavan said to Yaakov:<br>	Here is this mound, here is the pillar that I have sunk between me and you:52 	witness is this mound, witness is the pillar<br>	that I will not cross over this mound to you<br>	and you will not cross over this mound and this pillar to me,<br>	for ill!53 	May the God of Avraham and the God of Nahor keep-justice between us—the God of their father.<br>	And Yaakov swore by the Terror of his father Yitzhak.54 	Then Yaakov slew a sacrificial-meal on the mountain<br>	and called his brothers to eat bread.<br>	They ate bread and spent the night on the mountain.32:1 	Lavan started-early in the morning and kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them;<br>	then Lavan went and returned to his place.2 @ 	As Yaakov went on his way,<br>	messengers of God encountered him.3 	Yaakov said when he saw them:<br>	This is a camp of God!<br>	And he called the name of that place: Mahanayim/Double-Camp.4 @ 	Now Yaakov sent messengers on ahead of him to Esav his brother in the land of Se’ir, in the territory of Edom,5 	and charged them, saying:<br>	Thus say to my lord, to Esav:<br>	Thus says your servant Yaakov:<br>	I have sojourned with Lavan and have tarried until now.6 	Ox and donkey, sheep and servant and maid have become mine.<br>	So I have sent to tell my lord, to find favor in your eyes.7 	The messengers returned to Yaakov, saying:<br>	We came to your brother, to Esav—<br>	but he is already coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him!8 	Yaakov became exceedingly afraid and was distressed.<br>	He divided the people that were with him and the sheep and the oxen and the camels into two camps;9 	he said [to himself]:<br>	Should Esav come against the one camp and strike it, the camp that is left will be a remnant-that-escapes.10 	Then Yaakov said:<br>	God of my father Avraham,<br>	God of my father Yitzhak,<br>	O <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	who said to me: Return to your land, to your kindred, and I will deal well with you!—11 	too small am I for all the loyalty and faithfulness that you have shown your servant.<br>	For with [only] my rod did I cross this Jordan, and now I have become two camps.12 	Pray save me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esav!<br>	For I am in fear of him,<br>	lest he come and strike me down, mothers and children alike!13 	But you, you have said:<br>	I will deal well, well with you,<br>	I will make your seed like the sand of the sea, which is too much to count!14 	He spent the night there that night,<br>	and took a gift from what was at hand, for Esav his brother:15 	she-goats, two hundred, and kids, twenty,<br>	ewes, two hundred, and rams, twenty,16 	nursing camels and their young, thirty,<br>	cows, forty, and bulls, ten,<br>	she-asses, twenty, and colts, ten;17 	he handed them over to his servants, herd by herd separately,<br>	and said to his servants:<br>	Cross on ahead of me, and leave room between herd and herd.18 	He charged the first group, saying:<br>	When Esav my brother meets you<br>	and asks you, saying: To whom do you belong, where are you going, and to whom do these ahead of you belong?19 	Then say:<br>	—to your servant, to Yaakov, it is a gift sent to my lord, to Esav,<br>	and here, he himself is also behind us.20 	Thus he charged the second, and thus the third, and thus all that were walking behind the herds, saying:<br>	According to this word shall you speak to Esav when you come upon him:21 	you shall say: Also—here, your servant Yaakov is behind us.<br>	For he said [to himself]:<br>	I will wipe [the anger from] his face<br>	with the gift that goes ahead of my face;<br>	afterward, when I see his face,<br>	perhaps he will lift up my face!22 	The gift crossed over ahead of his face,<br>	but he spent the night on that night in the camp.23 	He arose during that night<br>	and took his two wives, his two maids, and his eleven children<br>	to cross the Yabbok crossing.24 	He took them and brought them across the river; he brought across what belonged to him.25 	And Yaakov was left alone—<br>	and a man wrestled with him until the coming up of dawn.26 	He saw that he could not prevail against him,<br>	so he touched the socket of his thigh;<br>	and the socket of Yaakov’s thigh was dislocated as he wrestled with him.27 	Then he said:<br>	Let me go,<br>	for dawn has come up!<br>	But he said:<br>	I will not let you go<br>	unless you bless me.28 	He said to him:<br>	What is your name?<br>	And he said: Yaakov.29 	Then he said:<br>	Not as Yaakov/Heel-Sneak shall your name be henceforth uttered,<br>	but rather as Yisrael/God-Fighter,<br>	for you have fought with God and men<br>	and have prevailed.30 	Then Yaakov asked and said:<br>	Pray tell me your name!<br>	But he said:<br>	Why, now, do you ask about my name?<br>	And he gave him farewell-blessing there.31 	Yaakov called the name of the place: Peniel/Face of God,<br>	for: I have seen God,<br>	face to face,<br>	and my life has been saved!32 	The sun rose on him as he crossed by Penuel,<br>	and he was limping on his thigh.33 	—Therefore the Children of Israel do not eat the nerve sinew that is on the socket of the thigh until this day,<br>	for he had touched the socket of Yaakov’s thigh at the nerve sinew.33:1 @ 	Yaakov lifted up his eyes and saw:<br>	there was Esav coming, and with him, four hundred men!<br>	He divided the children among Le’a, Rahel, and the two maids:2 	he put the maids and their children first,<br>	Le’a and her children behind them,<br>	and Rahel and Yosef behind them,3 	while he himself advanced ahead of them.<br>	And he bowed low to the earth seven times, until he had come close to him, to his brother.4 	Esav ran to meet him;<br>	he embraced him, flung himself upon his neck, and kissed him.<br>	And they wept.5 	Then he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children, and said:<br>	What are these to you?<br>	He said:<br>	—the children with whom God has favored your servant.6 	Then the maids came close, they and their children, and bowed low.7 	Then Le’a and her children came close and bowed low.<br>	Afterward Yosef and Rahel came close and bowed low.8 	He said:<br>	What to you is all this camp that I have met?<br>	He said:<br>	—To find favor in my lord’s eyes.9 	Esav said:<br>	I have plenty, my brother, let what is yours remain yours.10 	Yaakov said:<br>	No, I pray!<br>	Pray, if I have found favor in your eyes,<br>	then take this gift from my hand.<br>	For I have, after all, seen your face, as one sees the face of God,<br>	and you have been gracious to me.11 	Pray take my token-of-blessing that is brought to you,<br>	for God has shown me favor—for I have everything.<br>	And he pressed him, so he took it.12 	Then he said:<br>	Let us move on and go, and I will go at your side.13 	But he said to him:<br>	My lord knows<br>	that the children are frail,<br>	and the sheep and the oxen are suckling in my care;<br>	if we were to push them for a single day, all the animals would die!14 	Pray let my lord cross on ahead of his servant,<br>	while as for me, I will travel slowly,<br>	at the pace of the gear ahead of me and at the pace of the children,<br>	until I come to my lord, at Se’ir.15 	Esav said:<br>	Pray let me leave with you some of the people who are mine.<br>	But he said:<br>	Why, now?<br>	May I only find favor in my lord’s eyes!16 	So Esav started back that same day on his journey to Se’ir,17 	while Yaakov traveled to Succot.<br>	He built himself a house there, and for his livestock he made sheds.<br>	Therefore they called the name of the place: Succot/Sheds.18 @ 	Yaakov came home in peace to the city of Shekhem, which is in the land of Canaan,<br>	on his homecoming from Paddan Aram,<br>	and he encamped facing the city.19 	And he acquired the piece of territory where he had spread out his tent, from the Sons of Hamor, Shekhem’s father, for a hundred <i>kesitas</i>.20 	There he set up an altar<br>	and called it:<br>	<i>El</i>/God, the God of Yisrael!34:1 @ 	Dina, Le’a’s daughter, whom she had borne to Yaakov, went out to see the women of the land.2 	And Shekhem son of Hamor the Hivvite, the prince of the land, saw her;<br>	he took her and lay with her: he forced her.3 	But his feelings clung to Dina, Yaakov’s daughter—he loved the girl,<br>	and he spoke to the heart of the girl.4 	So Shekhem said to Hamor his father, saying:<br>	Take me this girl as a wife!5 	Now Yaakov had heard that he had defiled Dina his daughter,<br>	but since his sons were with his livestock in the fields, Yaakov kept silent until they came home.6 	Hamor, Shekhem’s father, went out to Yaakov, to speak with him.7 	But Yaakov’s sons came back from the fields when they heard,<br>	and the men were pained, they were exceedingly upset,<br>	for he had done a disgrace in Israel by lying with Yaakov’s daughter,<br>	such [a thing] is not to be done!8 	Hamor spoke with them, saying:<br>	My son Shekhem—<br>	his feelings are so attached to your daughter,<br>	[so] pray give her to him as a wife!9 	And make marriage-alliances with us:<br>	give us your daughters, and our daughters take for yourselves,10 	and settle among us!<br>	The land shall be [open] before you:<br>	settle down, travel about it, obtain holdings in it!11 	And Shekhem said to her father and to her brothers:<br>	May I only find favor in your eyes!<br>	However much you say to me, I will give-in-payment;12 	to whatever extreme you multiply the bride-price and the marriage-gift,<br>	I will give however much you say to me—<br>	just give me the girl as a wife!13 	Yaakov’s sons answered Shekhem and Hamor his father with deceit;<br>	they spoke [thus] because he had defiled Dina their sister.14 	They said to them:<br>	We cannot do this thing,<br>	give our sister to a man who has a foreskin,<br>	for that would be a reproach for us!15 	Only on this [condition] will we comply with you:<br>	if you become like us, by having every male among you circumcised.16 	Then we will give you our daughters, and your daughters we will take for ourselves,<br>	and we will settle among you, so that we become a single people.17 	But if you do not hearken to us, to be circumcised,<br>	we will take our daughter and go.18 	Their words seemed good in the eyes of Hamor and in the eyes of Shekhem son of Hamor,19 	and the young man did not hesitate to do the thing,<br>	for he took delight in Yaakov’s daughter.<br>	Now he carried more weight than anyone in his father’s house.20 	Hamor and Shekhem his son came back to the gate of their city,<br>	and they spoke to the men of their city, saying:21 	These men are peaceably disposed toward us;<br>	let them settle in the land and travel about in it,<br>	for the land is certainly wide-reaching enough for them!<br>	Let us take their daughters as wives for ourselves, and let us give them our daughters.22 	But only on this [condition] will the men comply with us, to settle among us, to become a single people:<br>	that every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.23 	Their acquired-livestock, their acquired-property and all their animals—will they not then become ours?!<br>	Let us only comply with them, that they may settle among us!24 	So they hearkened to Hamor and to Shekhem his son, all who go out [to war] from the gate of his city:<br>	all the males were circumcised, all who go out [to war] from the gate of his city.25 	But on the third day it was, when they were still hurting,<br>	that two of Yaakov’s sons, Shim’on and Levi, Dina’s full-brothers, took each man his sword, <br>	they came upon the city [feeling] secure, and killed all the males,26 	and Hamor and Shekhem his son they killed by the sword.<br>	Then they took Dina from Shekhem’s house and went off.27 	Yaakov’s [other] sons came up upon the corpses and plundered the city,<br>	because they had defiled their sister.28 	Their sheep, their oxen, their donkeys—whatever was inside the city and out in the field, they took;29 	all their riches, all their little-ones and their wives they captured and plundered,<br>	as well as all that was in the houses.30 	But Yaakov said to Shim’on and to Levi:<br>	You have stirred-up-disaster for me,<br>	making me reek among the settled-folk of the land, the Canaanites and the Perizzites!<br>	For I am menfolk few in number;<br>	they will band together against me and strike me,<br>	and I will be wiped out, I and my household!31 	But they said:<br>	Should our sister then be treated like a whore?35:1 @ 	Now God said to Yaakov:<br>	Arise,<br>	go up to Bet-El and stay there,<br>	and construct an altar there<br>	to the God/<i>El</i> who was seen by you when you fled from Esav your brother.2 	Yaakov said to his household and to all who were with him:<br>	Put away the foreign gods that are in your midst!<br>	Purify yourselves! Change your garments!3 	Let us arise and go up to Bet-El;<br>	there I will construct an altar<br>	to the God who answered me on the day of my distress<br>	—he was with me on the way that I went!4 	So they gave Yaakov all the foreign gods that were in their hand, along with the sacred-rings that were in their ears,<br>	and Yaakov concealed them under the oak/<i>ela</i> that is near Shekhem.5 	Then they moved on.<br>	Now a dread from God lay upon the towns that were around them,<br>	so that they did not pursue Yaakov’s sons.6 	So Yaakov came back to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan&mdash;that is Bet-El, he and all the people that were with him.7 	There he built an altar<br>	and called the place:<br>	Godhead/<i>El</i> of Bet-El!<br>	For there had the power-of-God been revealed to him, when he fled from his brother.8 @ 	Devora, Rivka’s nurse, died.<br>	She was buried below Bet-El, beneath the oak,<br>	so they called its name: Allon Bakhut/Oak of Weeping.9 @ 	God was seen by Yaakov again, when he came back from Paddan Aram,<br>	and he gave him blessing:10 	God said to him:<br>		Yaakov is your name&mdash;<br>		Yaakov shall your name be called no more,<br>		for Yisrael shall be your name!<br>	And he called his name: Yisrael.11 	God said further to him:<br>	I am God Shaddai.<br>	Bear fruit and be many!<br>	Nation, yes, a host of nations shall come from you;<br>	kings shall go out from your loins!12 	And the land<br>	that I gave to Avraham and to Yitzhak,<br>	to you I give it,<br>	and to your seed after you I give the land.13 	God went up from beside him, at the place where he had spoken with him.14 	And Yaakov set up a standing-pillar at the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone;<br>	he poured out a poured-offering on it and cast oil upon it.15 	And Yaakov called the name of the place where God had spoken with him:<br>	Bet-El/House of God!16 	They moved on from Bet-El.<br>	But when there was still a stretch of land to come to Efrat,<br>	Rahel began to give birth,<br>	and she had a very hard birthing.17 	It was, when her birthing was at its hardest,<br>	that the midwife said to her:<br>	Do not be afraid,<br>	for this one too is a son for you!18 	It was, as her life was slipping away<br>	—for she was dying—<br>	that she called his name: Ben-Oni/Son-of-My-Woe.<br>	But his father called him: Binyamin/Son-of-the-Right-Hand.19 	So Rahel died;<br>	she was buried along the way to Efrat—that is Bet-Lehem.20 	Yaakov set up a standing-pillar over her burial-place;<br>	that is Rahel’s burial pillar of today.21 @ 	Yisrael moved on and spread his tent beyond Migdal-Eder/Herd-Tower.22 	And it was when Yisrael was dwelling in that land, that Re’uven went and lay with Bilha, his father’s concubine.<br>	And Yisrael heard—<br> @ 		Now the sons of Yaakov were twelve:23 	The sons of Le’a: Yaakov’s firstborn, Re’uven; Shim’on, Levi and Yehuda, Yissakhar and Zevulun.24 	The sons of Rahel: Yosef and Binyamin.25 	And the sons of Bilha, Rahel’s maid: Dan and Naftali.26 	And the sons of Zilpa, Lea’s maid: Gad and Asher.<br>	These [were] Yaakov’s sons, who were born to him in Paddan Aram.27 @ 	Yaakov came home to Yitzhak his father at Mamre, in the city of Arba—that is Hevron,<br>	where Avraham and Yitzhak had sojourned.28 	And the days of Yitzhak were a hundred years and eighty29 		years,/ then Yitzhak expired.<br>	He died and was gathered to his kinspeople, old and satisfied in days.<br>	Esav and Yaakov his sons buried him.36:1 @ 	And these are the begettings of Esav—that is Edom.2 	Esav took his wives from the women of Canaan:<br>	Ada, daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholivama, daughter3 		of Ana [and] granddaughter of Tziv’on the Hivvite,/ and Ba’semat, daughter of Yishmael and sister of Nevayot.4 	Ada bore Elifaz to Esav,<br>	Ba’semat bore Re’uel,5 	and Oholivama bore Ye’ush, Ya’lam, and Korah.<br>	These are Esav’s sons, who were born to him in the land of Canaan.6 	Esav took his wives, his sons and his daughters, and all the persons in his household,<br>	as well as his acquired-livestock, all his animals, and all his acquisitions that he had gained in the land of Canaan,<br>	and went to [another] land, away from Yaakov his brother,7 	for their property was too much for them to settle together;<br>	the land of their sojourning could not support them, on account of their acquired-livestock.8 	So Esav settled in the highlands of Se’ir—Esav, that is Edom.9 		And these are the begettings of Esav, the tribal-father of Edom, in the highlands of Se’ir:10 	these are the names of the sons of Esav:<br>	Elifaz son of Ada, Esav’s wife, Re’uel, son of Ba’semat, Esav’s wife.11 	The sons of Elifaz were Teiman, Omar, Tzefo, Ga’tam, and Kenaz.12 	Now Timna was concubine to Elifaz son of Esav, and she bore Amalek to Elifaz.<br>	These are the sons of Ada, Esav’s wife.13 	And these are the sons of Re’uel: Nahat and Zerah, Shamma and Mizza.<br>	These were the sons of Ba’semat, Esav’s wife.14 	And these were the sons of Oholivama, daughter of Ana [and] granddaughter of Tziv’on ]and] Esav’s wife:<br>	She bore Ye’ush and Ya’lam and Korah to Esav.15 	These are the families of Esav’s sons:<br>	From the sons of Elifaz, Esav’s firstborn, are: the Family Teiman, the Family Omar, the Family Tzefo, the Family16 		Kenaz,/ the Family Korah, the Family Ga’tam, the Family Amalek;<br>	these are the families from Elifaz in the land of Edom, these are the sons of Ada.17 	And these are the Children of Re’uel, Esav’s son: the Family Nahat, the Family Zerah, the Family Shamma, the Family Mizza;<br>	these are the families from Re’uel in the land of Edom, these the Children of Ba’semat, Esav’s wife.18 	And these are the Children of Oholivama, Esav’s wife: the Family Ye’ush, the Family Ya’lam, the Family Korah;<br>	these are the families from Oholivama, daughter of Ana, Esav’s wife.19 	These are the Children of Esav and these are their families.<br>	—That is Edom.20 @ 	These are the sons of Se’ir the Horite, the settled-folk of the land:21 	Lotan and Shoval and Tziv’on and Ana and Dishon and Etzer and Dishan.<br>	These are the Horite families, the Children of Se’ir in the land of Edom.22 	Now the sons of Lotan were Hori and Hemam, and Lotan’s sister was Timna.23 	And these are the sons of Shoval: Alvan and Manahat and Eval, Shefo and Onam.24 	And these are the sons of Tziv’on: Ayya and Ana.<br>	—That is the Ana who found the <i>yemim</i> in the wilderness,<br>		as he was tending the donkeys of Tziv’on his father.25 	And these are the sons of Ana: Dishon—and Oholivama was Ana’s daughter.26 	And these are the sons of Dishon: Hemdan and Eshban and Yitran and Ceran.27 	These are the sons of Etzer: Bilhan and Zaavan and Akan.28 	These are the sons of Dishan: Utz and Aran.29 	These are the Horite families: the Family Lotan, the Family30 		Shoval, the Family Tziv’on, the Family Ana,/ the Family Dishon, the Family Etzer, the Family Dishan.<br>	These are the families of the Horites, according to their families in the land of Se’ir.31 @ 	Now these are the kings who reigned as king in the land of Edom, before any king of the Children of Israel reigned as king:32 	In Edom, Bela son of Be’or was king; the name of his city was Dinhava.33 	And Bela died, and Yovav son of Zerah of Botzra became king in his stead.34 	And Yovav died, and Husham from the land of the Teimanites became king in his stead.35 	And Husham died, and Hadad son of Bedad became king in his stead—who struck Midyan in the territory of Mo’av, and the name of his city was Avit.36 	And Hadad died, and Samla of Masreka became king in his stead.37 	And Samla died, and Sha’ul of Rehovot-by-the-River became king in his stead.38 	And Sha’ul died, and Baal-Hanan son of Akhbor became king in his stead.39 	And Baal-Hanan son of Akhbor died, and Hadar became king in his stead; the name of his city was Pa’u, and the name of his wife, Mehetavel daughter of Matred, daughter of Mei-Zahav.40 @ 	Now these are the names of the families from Esav, according to their clans, according to their local-places, by their names:41 	The Family Timna, the Family Alva, the Family Yetet,/ the Family Oholivama, the Family Ela, the Family42 		Pinon,/ the Family Kenaz, the Family Teiman, the Family43 		Mivtzar,/ the Family Magdiel, the Family Iram.<br>	These are the families of Edom according to their settlements in the land of their holdings.<br> @ 		That is Esav, the tribal-father of Edom.37:1 @ 	Yaakov settled in the land of his father’s sojournings,<br>	in the land of Canaan.2 @ 	These are the begettings of Yaakov.<br> @ 	Yosef, seventeen years old, used to tend the sheep along with his brothers,<br>	for he was serving-lad with the sons of Bilha and the sons of Zilpa, his father’s wives.<br>	And Yosef brought a report of them, an ill one, to their father.3 	Now Yisrael loved Yosef above all his sons,<br>	for he was a son of old age to him,<br>	so he made him an ornamented tunic.4 	His brothers saw that it was he whom their father loved above all his brothers,<br>	so they hated him,<br>	and could not speak to him in peace.5 @ 	Yosef dreamt a dream, and told it to his brothers<br>	—from then on they hated him still more—;6 	he said to them:<br>	Pray hear this dream that I have dreamt:7 	Now here,<br>	we were binding sheaf-bundles out in the field,<br>	and here, my sheaf arose, and it was standing upright,<br>	and here, your sheaves were circling round and bowing down to my sheaf!8 	His brothers said to him:<br>	Would you be king, yes, king over us?<br>	Or would you really rule, yes, rule us?<br>	From then on they hated him still more—for his dreams, for his words.9 	But he dreamt still another dream, and recounted it to his brothers;<br>	he said:<br>	Here, I have dreamt still [another] dream:<br>	now here,<br>	the sun and the moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me!10 	[When] he recounted it to his father and his brothers,<br>	his father rebuked him and said to him:<br>	What kind of dream is this that you have dreamt!<br>	Shall we come, yes, come, I, your mother and your brothers,<br>	to bow down to you to the ground?11 	His brothers envied him,<br>	while his father kept the matter in mind.12 @ 	Now his brothers went to tend their father’s sheep in Shekhem.13 	Yisrael said to Yosef:<br>	Are not your brothers tending sheep in Shekhem?<br>	Come, I will send you to them!<br>	He said to him:<br>	Here I am.14 	And he said to him:<br>	Come, pray, look into the well-being of your brothers and into the well-being of the sheep,<br>	and bring me back word.<br>	So he sent him out from the valley of Hevron, and he came to Shekhem.15 	And a man came upon him—here, he was roaming in the field;<br>	the man asked him, saying:<br>	What do you seek?16 	He said:<br>	I seek my brothers,<br>	pray tell me where they are tending-sheep.17 	The man said:<br>	They have moved on from here;<br>	indeed, I heard them say: Let us go to Dotan.<br>	Yosef went after his brothers and came upon them in Dotan.18 	They saw him from afar,<br>	and before he had gotten near them, they plotted-cunningly against him to cause his death.19 	They said each man to his brother:<br>	Here comes that master of dreams!20 	So now, come, let us kill him and throw him into one of these pits<br>	and say: An ill-tempered beast devoured him!<br>	Then we will see what becomes of his dreams!21 	Re’uven heard it, and [tried to] rescue him from their hand; he said:<br>	Let us not take his life!22 	And Re’uven said to them:<br>	Do not shed blood!<br>	Throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness,<br>	but do not lay a hand upon him!<br>	—in order that he might save him from their hand, to return him to his father.23 @ 	So it was, when Yosef came to his brothers,<br>	that they stripped Yosef of his tunic,<br>	the ornamented tunic that he had on,24 	and took him and cast him into the pit.<br>	Now the pit was empty—no water in it.25 	And they sat down to eat bread.<br> @ 	They lifted up their eyes and saw:<br>	now here, a caravan of Yishmaelites coming from Gil’ad,<br>	their camels carrying balm, balsam, and ladanum,<br>	traveling to take them down to Egypt.26 	Now Yehuda said to his brothers:<br>	What gain is there<br>	if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?27 	Come, let us sell him to the Yishmaelites—<br>	but let not our hand be upon him,<br>	for he is our brother, our flesh!<br>	And his brothers listened to him.28 @ 	Meanwhile, some Midyanite men, merchants, passed by;<br>	they hauled up Yosef from the pit<br>	and sold Yosef to the Yishmaelites, for twenty pieces-of-silver.<br>	And they brought Yosef to Egypt.29 @ 	Re’uven returned to the pit,<br>	and here, Yosef was no longer in the pit!<br>	He rent his clothes30 	and returned to his brothers and said:<br>	The child is no more!<br>	And I—where am I to go?31 @ 	But they took Yosef’s tunic,<br>	they slaughtered a hairy goat<br>	and dipped the tunic in the blood.32 	Then they had the ornamented tunic sent out<br>	and had it brought to their father and said:<br>	We found this;<br>	pray recognize<br>	whether it is your son’s tunic or not!33 	He recognized it<br>	and said:<br>	My son’s tunic!<br>	An ill-tempered beast has devoured him!<br>	Yosef is ripped, ripped-to-pieces!34 	Yaakov tore his clothes;<br>	he put sackcloth on his loins<br>	and mourned his son for many days.35 	And all his sons and daughters arose to comfort him,<br>	but he refused to be comforted;<br>	he said:<br>	No, <br>	I will go down to my son<br>	in mourning, to Sheol!<br>	Thus his father wept for him.36 	Meanwhile, the Midyanites had sold him into Egypt<br>	to Potifar, Pharaoh’s court-official,<br>	the Chief of the [Palace] Guard.38:1 @ 	Now it was at about that time<br>	that Yehuda went down, away from his brothers<br>	and turned aside to an Adullamite man—his name was Hira.2 	There Yehuda saw the daughter of a Canaanite man—his name was Shua;<br>	he took her [as his wife] and came in to her.3 	She became pregnant and bore a son, and he called his name: Er.4 	She became pregnant again and bore a son, and she called his name: Onan.5 	Once again she bore a son, and she called his name: Shela.<br>	Now he was in Ceziv when she bore him.6 @ 	Yehuda took a wife for Er, his firstborn—her name was Tamar.7 	But Er, Yehuda’s firstborn, did ill in the eyes of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, <br>	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> caused him to die.8 	So Yehuda said to Onan:<br>	Come in to your brother’s wife, do a brother-in-law’s duty by her,<br>	and preserve seed for your brother!9 	But Onan knew that the seed would not be his,<br>	so it was, whenever he came in to his brother’s wife, he let it go to ruin on the earth,<br>	so as not to provide seed for his brother.10 	What he did was ill in the eyes of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	and he caused him to die as well.11 	So Yehuda said to Tamar his daughter-in-law:<br>	Sit as a widow in your father’s house<br>	until Shela my son has grown up.<br>	For he said [to himself]:<br>	Otherwise he will die as well, like his brothers!<br>	So Tamar went and stayed in her father’s house.12 	And many days passed.<br> @ 	Now Shua’s daughter, Yehuda’s wife, died.<br>	[When] Yehuda had been comforted,<br>	he went up to his sheep-shearers, he and his friend Hira the Adullamite, to Timna.13 	And Tamar was told, saying:<br>	Here, your father-in-law is going up to Timna to shear his sheep.14 	She removed her widow’s garments from her,<br>	covered herself with a veil and wrapped herself,<br>	and sat down by the entrance to Enayim/Two-Wells, which is on the way to Timna,<br>	for she saw that Shela had grown up, yet she had not been given to him as a wife.15 	Yehuda saw her, and he took her for a whore, for she had covered her face,16 	so he turned aside to her by the road and said:<br>	Come-now, pray let me come in to you—<br>	for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law.<br>	She said:<br>	What will you give me for coming in to me?17 	He said:<br>	I myself will send out a goats’ kid from the flock.<br>	She said:<br>	[Only] if you give me a pledge, until you send it.18 	He said:<br>	What is the pledge that I am to give you?<br>	She said:<br>	Your seal, your cord, and your staff that is in your hand.<br>	He gave them to her and then he came in to her, and she became pregnant by him.19 	She arose and went away;<br>	then she put off her veil from her and clothed herself in her widow’s garments.20 	Now Yehuda sent the goats’ kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to fetch the pledge from the woman’s hand,<br>	but he could not find her.21 	He asked the people of her place, saying:<br>	Where is that prostitute, the one in Two-Wells by the road?<br>	They said:<br>	There has been no prostitute here!22 	So he returned to Yehuda and said:<br>	I could not find her; moreover, the people of the place said: There has been no prostitute here!23 	Yehuda said:<br>	Let her keep them for herself, lest we become a laughing-stock.<br>	Here, I sent her this kid, but you, you could not find her.24 @ 	Now it was, after almost three months,<br>	that Yehuda was told, saying:<br>	Tamar your daughter-in-law has played-the-whore,<br>	in fact, she has become pregnant from whoring!<br>	Yehuda said:<br>	Bring her out and let her be burned!25 	[But as] she was being brought out,<br>	she sent a message to her father-in-law, saying:<br>	By the man to whom these belong I am pregnant.<br>	And she said:<br>	Pray recognize—<br>	whose seal and cords and staff are these?26 	Yehuda recognized them<br>	and said:<br>	She is in-the-right more than I!<br>	For after all, I did not give her to Shela my son!<br>	And he did not know her again.27 @ 	Now it was at the time of her birthing, that here, twins were in her belly!28 	And it was, as she was giving birth, that [one] put out a hand;<br>	the midwife took and tied a scarlet thread on his hand, saying:<br>	This one came out first.29 	But it was, as he pulled back his hand, here, his brother came out!<br>	So she said:<br>	What a breach you have breached for yourself!<br>	So they called his name: Peretz/Breach.30 	Afterward his brother came out, on whose hand was the scarlet thread.<br>	They called his name: Zerah.39:1 @ 	Now when Yosef was brought down to Egypt,<br>	Potifar, an official of Pharaoh, Chief of the Guard, an Egyptian man, acquired him from the hand of the Yishmaelites who brought him down there.2 	But <sc>Yhwh</sc> was with Yosef, so that he became a man of success:<br>	while he was in the house of his lord the Egyptian,3 	his lord saw that <sc>Yhwh</sc> was with him,<br>	so that whatever he did, <sc>Yhwh</sc> made succeed in his hands.4 	Yosef found favor in his eyes, and he waited upon him;<br>	he appointed him over his house, and everything belonging to him he placed in his hands.5 	And it was, from when he had appointed him over his house and over everything that belonged to him,<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> blessed the Egyptian’s house because of Yosef;<br>	<sc>Yhwh’s</sc> blessing was upon everything that belonged to him, in the house and in the fields.6 	So he left everything that was his in Yosef’s hands,<br>	and did not not concern himself about anything with him there except for the bread that he ate.<br>	Now Yosef was beautiful of form and beautiful of appearance.7 @ 	Now after these events it was<br>	that his lord’s wife fixed her eyes upon Yosef<br>	and said:<br>	Lie with me!8 	But he refused;<br>	he said to his lord’s wife:<br>	Here, my lord need not concern himself with me with aught in the house, <br>	and everything that belongs to him, he has put in my hands.9 	He is no greater in this house than I<br>	and has not withheld anything from me<br>	except for yourself,<br>	since you are his wife.<br>	So how could I do this great ill?<br>	I would be sinning against God!10 	Now it was, as she would speak to Yosef day after day, that he would not hearken to her, to lie beside her, to be with her—11 	and it was, on such a day,<br>	that he came into the house to do his work,<br>	and none of the house-people was there in the house—12 	that she grabbed him by his garment, saying:<br>	Lie with me!<br>	But he left his garment in her hand and fled, and escaped outside.13 	Now it was, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside,14 	that she called in her house-people and said to them, saying:<br>	See! He has brought to us<br>	a Hebrew man to play around with us!<br>	He came to me, to lie with me,<br>	but I called out with a loud voice,15 	and it was, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and called out<br>	that he left his garment beside me and fled, and escaped outside!16 	Now she kept his garment beside her, until his lord came back to the house.17 	Then she spoke to him according to these words, saying:<br>	There came to me the Hebrew servant whom you brought to us, to play around with me;18 	but it was, when I raised my voice and called out,<br>	that he left his garment beside me and fled outside!19 	Now it was, when his lord heard his wife’s words which she spoke to him,<br>	saying: According to these words, your servant did to me!—<br>	that his anger flared up;20 	Yosef’s lord took him and put him in the dungeon house,<br>	in the place where the king’s prisoners are imprisoned.<br>	But while he was there in the dungeon house,21 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> was with Yosef and extended kindness to him:<br>	he put his favor in the eyes of the dungeon warden.22 	And the dungeon warden put in Yosef’s hands all the prisoners who were in the dungeon house;<br>	whatever had to be done there, it was he that did it.23 	The dungeon warden did not need to see to anything at all in his hands,<br>	since <sc>Yhwh</sc> was with him,<br>	and whatever he did, <sc>Yhwh</sc> made succeed.40:1 @ 	Now after these events it was<br>	that the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt fell afoul of their lord, the king of Egypt.2 	Pharaoh became infuriated with his two officials, with the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,3 	and he placed them in custody in the house of the chief of the guard, in the dungeon house, the place where Yosef was imprisoned.4 	The chief of the guard appointed Yosef for them, that he should wait upon them.<br>	They were in custody for [many] days.5 	And then the two of them dreamt a dream, each man his own dream, in a single night,<br>	each man according to his dream’s interpretation,<br>	the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were imprisoned in the dungeon house.6 	Yosef came to them in the morning and saw them, and here, they were dejected!7 	So he asked Pharaoh’s officials who were with him in custody in the house of his lord, saying:<br>	Why are your faces in such ill-humor today?8 	They said to him:<br>	We have dreamt a dream, and there is no interpreter for it!<br>	Yosef said to them:<br>	Are not interpretations from God?<br>	Pray recount them to me!9 	The chief cupbearer recounted his dream to Yosef; he said to him:<br>	In my dream—<br>	now here, a vine was in front of me,10 	and on the vine, three winding-tendrils,<br>	and just as it was budding, the blossom came up,<br>	[and] its clusters ripened into grapes.11 	Now Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand;<br>	I picked the grapes<br>	and squeezed them into Pharaoh’s cup<br>	and put the cup in Pharaoh’s palm.12 	Yosef said to him:<br>	This is its interpretation:<br>	The three windings are three days—13 	in another three days<br>	Pharaoh will lift up your head<br>	and will restore you to your position<br>	so that you will put Pharaoh’s cup in his hand<br>	according to the former practice, when you were his cupbearer.14 	But keep me in mind with you, when it goes well for you;<br>	pray deal in loyalty with me and call me to mind to Pharaoh,<br>	so that you have me brought out of this house.15 	For I was stolen, yes, stolen from the land of the Hebrews,<br>	and here too I have done nothing<br>	that they should have put me in the pit.16 	The chief baker saw that he had interpreted for good,<br>	so he said to Yosef:<br>	I too, in my dream—<br>	now here, three baskets of white-bread were on my head,17 	and in the uppermost basket, all sorts of edibles for Pharaoh, baker’s work,<br>	and birds were eating them from the basket, from off my head.18 	Yosef gave answer, he said:<br>	This is its interpretation:<br>	the three baskets are three days—19 	in another three days<br>	Pharaoh will lift up your head<br>	from off you;<br>	he will hang you on a stake,<br>	and the birds will eat your flesh from off you.20 	And thus it was, on the third day,<br>	Pharaoh’s birthday,<br>	that he made a great drinkfest for all his servants,<br>	and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker amidst his servants:21 	he restored the chief cupbearer to his cupbearership,<br>	so that he put the cup in Pharaoh’s palm,22 	but the chief baker he hanged,<br>	just as Yosef had interpreted to them.23 	But the chief cupbearer did not keep Yosef in mind;<br>	he forgot him.41:1 @ 	Now at the end of two years’-time it was<br>	that Pharaoh dreamt:<br>	now here, he was standing by the Nile-Stream,2 	and here, out of the Nile, seven cows were coming up,<br>	beautiful of appearance and well-nourished of flesh,<br>	and they grazed in the reed-grass.3 	And here, seven other cows were coming up after them out of the Nile,<br>	ill of appearance and lean of flesh,<br>	and they stood beside the other cows on the bank of the Nile.4 	And the cows ill of appearance and lean of flesh ate up<br>	the seven cows beautiful in appearance, the well-nourished ones.<br>	Pharaoh awoke.5 	He fell asleep and dreamt a second time:<br>	now here, seven ears-of-grain were going up on a single stalk, fat and good,6 	and here, seven ears, lean and scorched by the east wind, were springing up after them.7 	And the lean ears swallowed up<br>	the seven well-nourished and full ears.<br>	Pharaoh awoke,<br>	and here, [it was] a dream!8 	But in the morning it was, that his spirit was stirred up,<br>	so he sent and had all of Egypt’s magicians and all of its wise-men called.<br>	Pharaoh recounted his dream to them,<br>	but no one could interpret them to Pharaoh.9 	Then the chief cupbearer spoke up to Pharaoh, saying:<br>	I must call my faults to mind today!10 	Pharaoh was [once] infuriated with his servants<br>	and placed me in custody, in the house of the chief of the guard,<br>	myself and the chief baker.11 	And we dreamt a dream in a single night, I and he;<br>	we dreamt each one according to the interpretation of his dream.12 	Now there was a Hebrew lad there with us, a servant of the chief of the guard.<br>	We recounted them to him, and he interpreted our dreams to us;<br>	for each-one according to his dream he interpreted.13 	And it was: as he interpreted to us, so it was—<br>	I was restored to my position, and he was hanged.14 	Pharaoh sent and had Yosef called.<br>	They quickly brought him out of the pit;<br>	he shaved, changed his clothes, and came before Pharaoh.15 	Pharaoh said to Yosef:<br>	I have dreamt a dream, and there is no interpreter for it!<br>	But I have heard it said of you<br>	that you [but] need to hear a dream in order to interpret it!16 	Yosef answered Pharaoh, saying:<br>	Not I!<br>	God will answer what is for Pharaoh’s welfare.17 	Pharaoh spoke to Yosef:<br>	In my dream—<br>	here, I was standing on the bank of the Nile,18 	and here, out of the Nile were coming up seven cows,<br>	well-nourished of flesh and beautiful of form,<br>	and they grazed in the reed-grass.19 	And here, seven other cows were coming up after them,<br>	wretched and exceedingly ill of form and lank of flesh,<br>	in all the land of Egypt I have never seen their like for ill-condition!20 	Then the seven lank and ill-looking cows ate up<br>	the first seven cows, the well-nourished ones.21 	They entered their innards, but you would not know that they had entered their innards, for they were as ill-looking as at the beginning!<br>	And I awoke.22 	Then I saw in my dream:<br>	now here, seven ears were going up on a single stalk, full and good,23 	and here, seven ears, hardened, lean, and scorched by the east wind, were springing up after them.24 	Then the lean ears swallowed up<br>	the seven good ears!<br>	Now I have spoken with the magicians, but there is no one that can tell me [the answer]!25 	Yosef said to Pharaoh:<br>	Pharaoh’s dream is one.<br>	What God is about to do, he has told Pharaoh.26 	The seven good cows<br>	are seven years,<br>	and the seven good ears<br>	are seven years;<br>	the dream is one.27 	And the seven lank and ill-looking cows that were coming up after them<br>	are seven years,<br>	and the seven ears, hollow and scorched by the east wind,<br>	will be seven years of famine!28 	That is the word that I spoke to Pharaoh:<br>	what God is about to do, he has let Pharaoh see.29 	Here,<br>	seven years are coming<br>	of great plenty in all the land of Egypt.30 	But seven years of famine will arise after them,<br>	when all the plenty in the land of Egypt will be forgotten.<br>	The famine will destroy the land,31 	and it will not be known, that plenty [that was] in the land,<br>	because of that famine afterward,<br>	for it will be exceedingly heavy.32 	Now as for the repetition of the dream to Pharaoh, twice over: [it means] that the matter is determined by God,<br>	and God is hastening to do it.33 	So-now, let Pharaoh select a discerning and wise man,<br>	and set him over the land of Egypt.34 	Let Pharaoh do [this]: let him appoint appointed-overseers for the land,<br>	and divide the land of Egypt into five parts during the seven years of plenty.35 	Let them collect all kinds of food from these good years that are coming,<br>	and let them pile up grain under Pharaoh’s hand as food- provisions in the cities, and keep it under guard.36 	So the provisions will be an appointed-reserve for the land<br>	for the seven years of famine that will occur in the land of Egypt,<br>	so that the land will not be cut off by the famine.37 	The words seemed good in Pharaoh’s eyes and in the eyes of all his servants,38 	and Pharaoh said to his servants:<br>	Could we find another like him, a man in whom is the spirit of a god?39 	Pharaoh said to Yosef:<br>	Since a god has made you know all this,<br>	there is none as wise and discerning as you;40 	you shall be [The One] Over My House!<br>	To your orders shall all my people submit;<br>	only by the throne will I be greater than you!41 	And Pharaoh said to Yosef:<br>	See, I place you over all the land of Egypt!42 	And Pharaoh removed his signet-ring from his hand and placed it on Yosef’s hand,<br>	and he had him clothed in linen garments and put the gold chain upon his neck;43 	he had him mount the chariot of his second-in-rank, and they called out before him: <i>Avrekh!</i>/Attention!<br>	Thus he placed him over all the land of Egypt.44 	Pharaoh said to Yosef:<br>	I am Pharaoh,<br>	but without you, no man shall raise hand or foot in all the land of Egypt!45 	And Pharaoh called Yosef’s name: <i>Tzafenat Pane’ah</i>/The God Speaks and He Lives,<br>	and he gave him Asenat, daughter of Poti Fera, priest of On, as a wife.<br>	And Yosef’s [influence] went out over the land of Egypt.46 	Now Yosef was thirty years old when he stood in the presence of Pharaoh, king of Egypt.<br>	And Yosef went out from Pharaoh’s presence and crossed through all the land of Egypt.47 @ 	In the seven years of plenty the land produced in handfuls.48 	And he collected all kinds of provisions from those seven years that occurred in the land of Egypt,<br>	and placed provisions in the towns.<br>	The provisions from the fields of a town, surrounding it, he placed in it [as well].49 	So Yosef piled up grain like the sand of the sea, exceedingly much, until they had to stop counting, for it was uncountable.50 @ 	Now two sons were born to Yosef, before the year of famine came,<br>	whom Asenat, daughter of Poti Fera, priest of On, bore to him.51 	Yosef called the name of the firstborn: Menashe/He-Who-Makes-Forget,<br>	meaning: God has made-me-forget all my hardships, all my father’s house.52 	And the name of the second he called: Efrayim/Double-Fruit,<br>	meaning: God has made me bear fruit in the land of my affliction.53 @ 	There came to an end the seven years of plenty that had occurred in the land of Egypt,54 	and there started to come the seven years of famine, as Yosef had said.<br>	Famine occurred in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.55 	Then all the land of Egypt felt the famine, and the people cried out to Pharaoh for bread,<br>	so Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians:<br>	Go to Yosef, whatever he says to you, do!56 	Now the famine was over all the surface of the earth.<br>	Yosef opened up all [storehouses] in which there was [grain], and gave-out-rations to the Egyptians,<br>	since the famine was becoming stronger in the land of Egypt.57 	And all lands came to Egypt to buy rations, to Yosef,<br>	for the famine was strong in all lands.42:1 @ 	Yaakov saw that there were rations in Egypt,<br>	so Yaakov said to his sons:<br>	Why do you keep looking at one another?2 	And he said:<br>	Here, I have heard that there are rations in Egypt;<br>	go down there and buy us rations from there,<br>	that we may live and not die.3 	So Yosef’s brothers went down, ten [of them],<br>	to buy some rationed grain from Egypt.4 	But Binyamin, Yosef’s brother, Yaakov would not send with his brothers,<br>	for he said: Lest harm befall him!5 	The sons of Yisrael came to buy-rations among those that came,<br>	for the famine was in the land of Canaan.6 	Now Yosef was the governor over the land; it was he who supplied rations to all the people of the land.<br>	And Yosef’s brothers came and bowed low to him, nostrils to the earth.7 	[When] Yosef saw his brothers, he recognized them,<br>	but he pretended-no-recognition of them and spoke roughly with them.<br>	He said to them:<br>	From where do you come?<br>	They said: From the land of Canaan, to buy food-rations.8 	Now Yosef recognized his brothers, but for their part, they did not recognize him.9 	And Yosef was reminded of the dreams that he had dreamt of them.<br>	He said to them:<br>	You are spies!<br>	[It is] to see the nakedness of the land that you have come!10 	They said to him: No, my lord!<br>	Rather, your servants have come to buy food-rations.11 	We are all of us the sons of one man,<br>	we are honest,<br>	your servants have never been spies!12 	But he said to them:<br>	No!<br>	For [it is] the nakedness of the land that you have come to see!13 	They said:<br>	Your servants are twelve,<br>	we are brothers,<br>	sons of one man in the land of Canaan:<br>	the youngest is with our father now,<br>	and one is no more.14 	Yosef said to them:<br>	It is just as I spoke to you, saying: You are spies!15 	Hereby shall you be tested:<br>	As Pharaoh lives!<br>	You shall not depart from this [place]<br>	unless your youngest brother comes here!16 	Send one of you to fetch your brother,<br>	while [the rest of] you remain as prisoners.<br>	Thus will your words be tested, whether there is truth in you or not—<br>	as Pharaoh lives, indeed, you are spies!17 	He removed them into custody for three days.18 	Yosef said to them on the third day:<br>	Do this, and stay alive,<br>	for I hold God in awe:19 	if you are honest,<br>	let one of your brothers be held prisoner in the house of your custody,<br>	and as for you, go, bring back rations for the famine-supply of your households.20 	Then bring your youngest brother back to me,<br>	so that your words will be proven truthful, and you will not die.<br>	They [prepared to] do so.21 	But they said, each one to his brother:<br>	Truly,<br>	we are guilty:<br>	concerning our brother!<br>	—that we saw his heart’s distress<br>	when he pleaded with us,<br>	and we did not listen.<br>	Therefore this distress has come upon us!22 	Re’uven answered them, saying:<br>	Did I not say to you, say: Do not sin against the child!<br>	But you would not listen,<br>	so for his blood—now, [satisfaction] is demanded!23 	Now they did not know that Yosef was listening, for a translator was between them.24 	But he turned away from them and wept.<br>	Then he returned to them; he spoke to them and had Shim’on taken away from them, and imprisoned him before their eyes.25 	And Yosef commanded that they fill their vessels with grain and return their silver-pieces into each man’s sack,<br>	and give them provisions for the journey.<br>	They did so for them.26 	Then they loaded their rations onto their donkeys and went from there.27 	But one opened his sack to give his donkey fodder at the night-camp,<br>	and he saw his silver—now here, it was in the mouth of his pack!28 	He said to his brothers:<br>	My silver has been returned—yes, here in my pack!<br>	Their hearts gave way, and they trembled to one another, saying:<br>	What, now, has God done to us?29 	They came home to Yaakov their father, in the land of Canaan,<br>	and told him all that had befallen them, saying:30 	The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us,<br>	he took us for those that spy on the land!31 	Now we said to him: We are honest, we have never been spies!32 	We are twelve, brothers all, sons of our father:<br>	one is no more, and the youngest is now with our father in the land of Canaan.33 	Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us:<br>	Hereby shall I know whether you are honest:<br>	leave one of your brothers with me,<br>	and as for the famine-supply of your households, take it and go.34 	But bring your youngest brother to me,<br>	so that I may know that you are not spies, that you are honest.<br>	[Then] I will give your brother back to you, and you may travel about the land.35 	But it was, when they emptied their sacks: there was each man’s silver pouch in his sack!<br>	They looked at their silver pouches, they and their father, and became frightened.36 	Yaakov their father said to them:<br>	<i>Me</i> you have bereaved!<br>	Yosef is no more,<br>	Shim’on is no more,<br>	and Binyamin you would take away—<br>	to me has all this happened!37 	Re’uven said to his father, saying:<br>	My two sons you may put to death<br>	if I do not bring him back to you!<br>	Place him in my hands, and I myself will return him to you.38 	But he said:<br>	My son is not to go down with you!<br>	For his brother is dead,<br>	and he alone is left!<br>	Should harm befall him on the journey on which you are going,<br>	you will bring down my gray hair in grief to Sheol!43:1 @ 	But the famine was heavy in the land.2 	And so it was, when they had finished eating the rations that they had brought from Egypt,<br>	that their father said to them:<br>	Return, buy us a little food.3 	But Yehuda said to him, saying:<br>	The man warned, yes, warned us,<br>	saying: You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.4 	If you wish to send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you some food.5 	But if you do not wish to send him, we will not go down,<br>	for the man said to us: You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.6 	Yisrael said:<br>	Why did you deal so ill with me, by telling the man that you have another brother?7 	They said:<br>	The man asked, he asked about us and about our kindred,<br>	saying: Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?<br>	So we told him, according to these words.<br>	Could we know, know that he would say: Bring your brother down?8 	Yehuda said to Yisrael his father:<br>	Send the lad with me,<br>	and we will arise and go,<br>	that we may live and not die,<br>	so we, so you, so our little-ones!9 	<i>I</i> will act as his pledge,<br>	at my hand you may seek him!<br>	If I do not bring him back to you<br>	and set him in your presence,<br>	I will be culpable-for-sin against you all the days [to come].10 	For had we not lingered, we would indeed have been back twice by now!11 	Yisrael their father said to them:<br>	If it must be so, then, do this:<br>	take some of the produce of the land in your vessels<br>	and bring them down to the man as a gift:<br>	a little balsam, a little honey, balm and ladanum, pistachio nuts and almonds.12 	And silver two times over take in your hand,<br>	and the silver that was returned in the mouth of your packs, return in your hand;<br>	perhaps it was an oversight.13 	And as for your brother, take [him]!<br>	Arise, return to the man,14 	and may God Shaddai give you mercy before the man,<br>	so that he releases your other brother to you, and Binyamin as well.<br>	And as for me—if I must be bereaved, I must be bereaved!15 	The men took this gift, and silver two times over they took in their hand<br>	and Binyamin as well.<br>	They arose and went down to Egypt<br>	and stood in Yosef’s presence.16 	[When] Yosef saw Binyamin with them,<br>	he said to [The One] Over his House:<br>	Bring the men into the house, slaughter some slaughter-animals and prepare them,<br>	for it is with me that these men shall eat at noon.17 	The man did as Yosef had said: the man brought the men into Yosef’s house.18 	But the men were frightened that they had been brought into Yosef’s house, and said:<br>	It is because of the silver that was returned in our packs before that we have been brought here,<br>	for [them to] roll upon us, and fall upon us,<br>	and take us into servitude, along with our donkeys!19 	They came close to the man, to [The One] Over Yosef’s House, and spoke to him at the entrance to the house,20 	they said: <br>	Please, my lord!<br>	We came down, came down previously to buy food-rations,21 	but it was, when we came to the night camp and opened our packs,<br>	there was each man’s silver in the mouth of his pack, our silver by its [exact] weight—<br>	but we have returned it in our hand!22 	And other silver as well we have brought down in our hand, to buy food.<br>	We do not know who put back our silver in our packs!23 	He said:<br>	It is well with you&mdash;do not be afraid!<br>	Your God, the God of your father, placed a treasure in your packs for you; your silver has come in to me.<br>	And he brought Shim’on out to them.24 	Then the man had the men come into Yosef’s house<br>	and gave them water so that they might wash their feet<br>	and gave them fodder for their donkeys.25 	They prepared the gift, until Yosef came back at noon,<br>	for they understood that they were to eat bread there.26 	Yosef came into the house, and they brought him the gift that was in their hand, into the house,<br>	and bowed low to him, to the earth.27 	He asked after their welfare and said:<br>	Is your old father well, of whom you spoke?<br>	Is he still alive?28 	They said:<br>	Your servant, our father, is well, he is still alive—<br>	and they did homage and bowed low.29 	He lifted up his eyes and saw Binyamin his brother, his mother’s son,<br>	and he said:<br>	Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?<br>	And he said:<br>	May God show you favor, my son!30 	And in haste—for his insides were so kindled toward his brother that he had to weep—<br>	Yosef entered an inner-room and wept there.31 	Then he washed his face and came out, restrained himself, and said:<br>	Serve bread!32 	They served him by himself and them by themselves and the Egyptians who were eating with him by themselves,<br>	for Egyptians will not eat bread with Hebrews—for that is an abomination for Egyptians.33 	But they were seated in his presence:<br>	the firstborn according to his rank-as-firstborn and the youngest according to his rank-as-youngest.<br>	And the men stared at each other in astonishment over it.34 	He had courses taken to them from his presence,<br>	and Binyamin’s course was five times greater than all their courses.<br>	And they drank and became drunk with him.44:1 	Then he commanded [The One} Over his House, saying:<br>	Fill the men’s packs with food, as much as they are able to carry,<br>	and put each man’s silver in the mouth of his pack.2 	And my goblet, the silver goblet, put in the mouth of the youngest’s pack, along with the silver for his rations.<br>	He did according to Yosef’s word which he had spoken.3 	At the light of daybreak, the men were sent off, they and their donkeys;4 	they were just outside the city—they had not yet gone far—when<br>	Yosef said to [The One] Over his House:<br>	Up, pursue the men, and when you have caught up with them, say to them:<br>	Why have you paid back ill for good?5 	Is not this [goblet] the one that my lord drinks with?<br>	And he also divines, yes, divines with it!<br>	You have wrought ill in what you have done!6 	He caught up with them, and spoke those words to them.7 	They said to him:<br>	Why does my lord speak such words as these?<br>	[Heaven] forbid for your servants to do such a thing!8 	Here, the silver that we found in the mouth of our packs, we returned to you from the land of Canaan,<br>	so how could we steal silver or gold from the house of your lord?9 	The one with whom it is found among your servants, he shall die,<br>	and we also will become my lord’s servants!10 	He said:<br>	Now as well, according to your words, so be it:<br>	the one with whom it is found shall become my servant, but <i>you</i> shall be clear.11 	With haste each one let down his pack to the ground, and each one opened his pack.12 	And then he searched: with the eldest he started and with the youngest he finished—<br>	and the goblet was found in Binyamin’s pack!13 	They rent their clothes,<br>	and each one loaded up his donkey, and they returned to the city.14 	Yehuda and his brothers came into Yosef’s house<br>	—he was still there—<br>	and flung themselves down before him to the earth.15 	Yosef said to them:<br>	What kind of deed is this that you have done!<br>	Do you not know that a man like me can divine, yes, divine?16 	Yehuda said:<br>	What can we say to my lord?<br>	What can we speak, by what can we show ourselves innocent?<br>	God has found out your servants’ crime!<br>	Here we are, servants to my lord, so we, so the one in whose hand the goblet was found.17 	But he said:<br>	[Heaven] forbid that I should do this!<br>	The man in whose hand the goblet was found—he shall become my servant,<br>	but you—go up in peace to your father!18 	Yehuda came closer to him and said:<br>	Please, my lord,<br>	pray let your servant speak a word in the ears of my lord,<br>	and do not let your anger flare up against your servant,<br>	for you are like Pharaoh!19 	My lord asked his servants, saying: Do you have a father or [another] brother?20 	And we said to my lord: We have an old father<br>	and a young child of his old age,<br>	whose brother is dead,<br>	so that he alone is left of his mother,<br>	and his father loves him.21 	And you said to your servants: Bring him down to me, I wish to set my eyes upon him.22 	But we said to my lord:<br>	The lad cannot leave his father;<br>	were he to leave his father, he would die!23 	But you said to your servants: If your youngest brother does not come down with you, you shall not see my face again.24 	Now it was, when we went up to your servant, my father, we told him my lord’s words,25 	and our father said: Return, buy us some food-rations.26 	But we said: We cannot go down;<br>	if our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down,<br>	for we cannot see the man’s face if our youngest brother is not with us.27 	Now your servant, my father, said to us:<br>	You yourselves know<br>	that my wife bore two to me.28 	One went away from me;<br>	I said: For sure he is torn, torn-to-pieces!<br>	And I have not seen him again thus far.29 	Now should you take away this one as well from before my face, should harm befall him, you will bring down my gray hair in ill-fortune to Sheol!30 	So now,<br>	when I come back to your servant, my father, and the lad is not with us,<br>	—with whose life his own life is bound up!—31 	it will be, that when he sees that the lad is no more, he will die,<br>	and your servant will have brought down the gray hair of your servant, our father, in grief to Sheol!32 	For your servant pledged himself for the lad to my father,<br>	saying: If I do not bring him back to you, I will be culpable-for-sin against my father all the days [to come].33 	So now,<br>	pray let your servant stay instead of the lad, as servant to my lord,<br>	but let the lad go up with his brothers!34 	For how can I go up to my father, when the lad is not with me?<br>	Then would I see the ill-fortune that would come upon my father!45:1 @ 	Yosef could no longer restrain himself in the presence of all who were stationed around him;<br>	he called out:<br>	Have everyone leave me!<br>	So no one stood [in attendance upon] him when Yosef made himself known to his brothers.2 	He put forth his voice in weeping:<br>	the Egyptians heard, and Pharaoh’s household heard.3 	Then Yosef said to his brothers:<br>	I am Yosef. Is my father still alive?<br>	But his brothers were not able to answer him,<br>	for they were terrified before him.4 	Yosef said to his brothers:<br>	Pray come close to me!<br>	They came close.<br>	He said:<br>	I am Yosef your brother, whom you sold into Egypt.5 	But now, do not be pained,<br>	and do not let upset be in your eyes that you sold me here!<br>	For it was to save life that God sent me on before you.6 	For it is two years now that the famine has been in the midst of the land,<br>	and there are still another five years in which there shall be no plowing or harvest.7 	So God sent me on ahead of you<br>	to make you a remnant on earth,<br>	to keep you alive as a great body-of-survivors.8 	So now,<br>	it was not you that sent me here, but God!<br>	He has made me Father to Pharaoh and lord of all his household and ruler over all the land of Egypt.9 	Make haste, go up to my father and say to him:<br>	Thus says your son, Yosef:<br>	God has made me lord of all Egypt;<br>	come down to me, do not remain!10 	You shall stay in the region of Goshen, you shall be near me,<br>	you and your sons and the sons of your sons,<br>	your sheep, your oxen, and all that is yours.11 	I will sustain you there,<br>	for there are still five years of famine left<br>	—lest you be as disinherited, you and your household and all that is yours.12 	Here, your eyes see, as well as my brother Binyamin’s eyes, that it is my mouth that speaks to you!13 	So tell my father of all the weight I carry in Egypt, and of all that you have seen,<br>	and make haste, bring my father down here!14 	He flung himself upon his brother Binyamin’s neck and wept,<br>	and Binyamin wept upon his neck.15 	Then he kissed all his brothers and wept upon them.<br>	After this his brothers spoke with him.16 @ 	The news was heard in Pharaoh’s household; they said:<br>	Yosef’s brothers have come!<br>	It was good in Pharaoh’s eyes and in the eyes of his servants.17 	And Pharaoh said to Yosef:<br>	Say to your brothers:<br>	Do this—<br>	load your animals and go,<br>	come back to the land of Canaan;18 	fetch your father and your households<br>	and come to me!<br>	I will give you the good-things of the land of Egypt,<br>	so that you will eat of the fat of the land!19 	And you, you have been commanded:<br>	Do this—<br>	take you wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and your wives,<br>	and carry your father down<br>	and come!20 	Let not your eyes look-with-regret on your household-wares,<br>	for the good-things of all the land of Egypt—they are yours!21 	The sons of Yisrael did so;<br>	Yosef gave them wagons in accordance with Pharaoh’s orders<br>	and gave them provisions for the journey.22 	To all of them, each man, he gave changes of clothes,<br>	but to Binyamin he gave three hundred pieces-of-silver and five changes of clothes,23 	and to his father he sent in like manner:<br>	ten donkeys, carrying the good-things of Egypt,<br>	and ten she-asses, carrying grain and bread,<br>	and food for his father, for the journey.24 	Then he sent off his brothers, and they went;<br>	he said to them:<br>	Do not be agitated on the journey!25 	They went up from Egypt and came to the land of Canaan, to <br>	Yaakov their father,26 	and they told him, saying:<br>	Yosef is still alive!<br>	Indeed, he is ruler of all the land of Egypt!<br>	His heart failed,<br>	for he did not believe them.27 	But they spoke to him all of Yosef’s words which he had spoken to them,<br>	and he saw the wagons that Yosef had sent to carry him down,<br>	and their father Yaakov’s spirit came back to life.28 	Yisrael said:<br>	Enough!<br>	Yosef my son is still alive;<br>	I must go and see him before I die!46:1 @ 	Yisrael traveled with all that was his<br>	and came to Be’er-Sheva,<br>	and he sacrificed sacrifices to the God of his father Yitzhak.2 	And God said to Yisrael in visions of the night,<br>	he said:<br>	Yaakov! Yaakov!<br>	He said:<br>	Here I am.3 	Now he said:<br>	I am <i>El</i>/God,<br>	the God of your father.<br>	Do not be afraid of going down to Egypt,<br>	for a great nation will I make of you there.4 	I myself<br>	will go down with you to Egypt,<br>	and I myself<br>	will bring you up, yes, up again.<br>	And Yosef will lay his hand on your eyes.5 @ 	Yaakov departed from Be’er-Sheva.<br>	Yisrael’s sons carried Yaakov their father, their little-ones and their wives in the wagons that Pharaoh had sent for carrying him,6 	and they took their acquired-livestock and their property that they had gained in the land of Canaan<br>	and came to Egypt,<br>	Yaakov and all his seed with him&mdash;7 	his sons and the sons of his sons with him, his daughters and the daughters of his sons;<br>	all his seed he brought with him to Egypt.8 @ 	Now these are the names of the Sons of Israel who came to Egypt:<br>	Yaakov and his sons:<br>	Yaakov’s firstborn was Re’uven.9 	Re’uven’s sons: Hanokh, Pallu, Hetzron, and Carmi.10 	And Shim’on’s sons: Yemuel, Yamin, Ohad, Yakhin, and Tzohar, and Sha’ul the son of the Canaanite-woman.11 	And Levi’s sons: Gershon, Kehat, and Merari.12 	And Yehuda’s sons: Er, Onan, Shela, Peretz, and Zerah,<br>	but Er and Onan had died in the land of Canaan.<br>	And Peretz’s sons were Hetzron and Hamul.13 	And Yissakhar’s sons: Tola, Puvva, Yov, and Shimron.14 	And Zevulun’s sons: Sered, Elon, and Yahl’el.15 	These are the sons of Le’a, whom she bore to Yaakov in Paddan Aram, and also Dina his daughter;<br>	all the persons among his sons and daughters: thirty-three.16 	And Gad’s sons: Tzifyon and Haggi, Shuni and Etzbon, Eri, Arodi, and Ar’eli.17 	And Asher’s sons: Yimna, Yishva, Yishvi, and Beri’a, and Serah their sister.<br>	And Beri’a’s sons: Hever and Malkiel.18 	These are the sons of Zilpa, whom Lavan had given to Le’a his daughter;<br>	she bore these to Yaakov: sixteen persons.19 	The sons of Rahel, Yaakov’s wife: Yosef and Binyamin.20 	To Yosef there were born in the land of Egypt—whom Asenat, daughter of Poti Fera, priest of On, bore to him: Menashe and Efrayim.21 	And Binyamin’s sons: Bela, Bekher and Ashbel, Gera and Naaman, Ahi and Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.22 	These are the sons of Rahel, who were born to Yaakov,<br>	all the persons: fourteen.23 	And Dan’s sons: Hushim.24 	And Naftali’s sons: Yahtze’el, Guni, Yetzer, and Shillem.25 	These are the sons of Bilha, whom Lavan had given to Rahel his daughter;<br>	she bore these to Yaakov: all the persons were seven.26 	All the persons who came with Yaakov to Egypt, those going out from his loins, aside from the wives of Yaakov’s sons:<br>	all the persons: sixty-six.27 	And Yosef’s sons, who had been born to him in Egypt: the persons, two.<br>	[Thus] all the persons of Yaakov’s household who came to Egypt: seventy.28 @ 	Now Yehuda he had sent on ahead of him, to Yosef,<br>	to give directions ahead of him to Goshen.<br>	And they came to the region of Goshen.29 	Yosef had his chariot harnessed and went up to meet Yisrael his father, to Goshen.<br>	[When] he caught sight of him,<br>	and he flung himself upon his neck<br>	and wept upon his neck continually.30 	Yisrael said to Yosef:<br>	Now I can die,<br>	since I have seen your face, that you are still alive!31 	Yosef said to his brothers and to his father’s household:<br>	I will go up, so that I may tell Pharaoh and say to him:<br>	My brothers and my father’s household, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me.32 	The men are shepherds of flocks;<br>	indeed, they have always been livestock men,<br>	and their sheep and their oxen, all that is theirs, they have brought along.33 	Now it will be, when Pharaoh has you called and says: What [is it] that you do?34 	Then say: Your servants have always been livestock men, from our youth until now, so we, so our fathers—<br>	in order that you may settle in the region of Goshen.<br>	For every shepherd of flocks is an abomination to the Egyptians.47:1 @ 	So Yosef came and told Pharaoh, he said:<br>	My father and my brothers, their sheep and their oxen and all that is theirs, have come from the land of Canaan,<br>	and here, they are in the region of Goshen!2 	Now from the circle of his brothers he had picked out five men and had set them in Pharaoh’s presence.3 	Pharaoh said to his brothers:<br>	What [is it] that you do?<br>	They said to Pharaoh:<br>	Your servants are shepherds of flocks, so we, so our fathers.4 	And they said to Pharaoh:<br>	We have come to sojourn in the land,<br>	for there is no grazing for the flocks that are your servants’,<br>	for the famine is heavy in the land of Canaan.<br>	So-now,<br>	pray let your servants settle in the region of Goshen!5 	Pharaoh said to Yosef, saying:<br>	Your father and your brothers have come to you.6 	The land of Egypt is before you;<br>	in the goodliest-part of the land, settle your father and your brothers;<br>	let them settle in the region of Goshen.<br>	And if you know that there are men of value among them,<br>	make them chiefs of livestock over what is mine.7 	Yosef brought Yaakov his father and had him stand in Pharaoh’s presence.<br>	And Yaakov gave Pharaoh a blessing-of-greeting.8 	Pharaoh said to Yaakov:<br>	How many are the days [and] years of your life?9 	Yaakov said to Pharaoh:<br>	The days [and] years of my sojourn are thirty and a hundred years.<br>	Few and ill-fated have been the days [and] years of my life;<br>	they have not attained the days [and] years of my fathers’ lives in the days of their sojourn.10 	Yaakov gave Pharaoh a blessing-of-farewell<br>	and went out from Pharaoh’s presence.11 	So Yosef settled his father and his brothers;<br>	he gave them holdings in the land of Egypt,<br>	in the goodliest-part of the land, in the region of Ra’meses, as Pharaoh had commanded.12 	And Yosef sustained his father, his brothers, and his father’s entire household with bread, in proportion to the little-ones.13 @ 	But bread there was none in all the land,<br>	for the famine was exceedingly heavy,<br>	and the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan were exhausted by the famine.14 	Yosef had collected all the silver that was to be found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, from the rations that they had bought,<br>	and Yosef had brought the silver into Pharaoh’s house.15 	But the silver in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan ran out,<br>	so all the Egyptians came to Yosef, saying:<br>	Come-now, [let us have] bread! <br>	Why should we die in front of you, because the silver is gone?16 	Yosef said:<br>	Come-now, [let me have] your livestock, and I will give you [bread] in exchange for your livestock, since the silver is gone.17 	So they brought their livestock to Yosef, and Yosef gave them bread in exchange for the horses, the sheep-livestock, the oxen-livestock, and the donkeys;<br>	he got-them-through with bread in exchange for all their livestock in that year.18 	But that year ran out, and they came back to him in the second year and said to him:<br>	We cannot hide from my lord<br>	that if the silver has run out and the animal-stocks are my lord’s,<br>	nothing remains for my lord except for our bodies and our land!19 	Why should we die before your eyes, so we, so our land?<br>	Acquire us and our land in exchange for bread,<br>	and we and our land will become servants to Pharaoh.<br>	Give [us] seed-for-sowing<br>	that we may live and not die,<br>	that the land may not become desolate!20 	So Yosef acquired all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh<br>	—for each of the Egyptians sold his field, for the famine was strong upon them—<br>	and the land went over to Pharaoh.21 	As for the people, he transferred them into the cities, from one edge of Egypt’s border to its other edge.22 	Only the land of the priests he did not acquire,<br>	for the priests had a prescribed-allocation from Pharaoh, and they ate from their allocation which Pharaoh had given them;<br>	therefore they did not sell their land.23 	Yosef said to the people:<br>	Now that I have acquired you and your land today for Pharaoh,<br>	here, you have seed, sow the land!24 	But it shall be at the ingatherings, that you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh,<br>	while the four other parts shall be for you<br>	as seed for the field and for your eating-needs, for those in your households, and for feeding your little-ones.25 	They said:<br>	You have saved our lives!<br>	May we find favor in my lord’s eyes: we will become servants to Pharaoh.26 	And Yosef made it a prescribed-law until this day, concerning the land of Egypt: For Pharaoh every fifth part!<br>	Only the land of the priests, that alone did not go over to Pharaoh.27 @ 	Yisrael stayed in the land of Egypt, in the region of Goshen;<br>	they obtained holdings in it, bore fruit, and became exceedingly many.28 	And Yaakov lived in the land of Egypt for seventeen years.<br>	And the days of Yaakov, the years of his life, were seven years and a hundred and forty years.29 	Yisrael’s days drew near to death,<br>	so he called his son Yosef and said to him:<br>	Pray, if I have found favor in your eyes,<br>	pray put your hand under my thigh—<br>	deal with me in loyalty and faithfulness:<br>	pray do not bury me in Egypt!30 	[When] I lie down with my fathers,<br>	carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burial-site!<br>	He said:<br>	I will do according to your words.31 	But he said:<br>	Swear to me!<br>	So he swore to him.<br>	Then Yisrael bowed, at the head of the bed.48:1 @ 	Now after these events it was<br>	that they said to Yosef:<br>	Here, your father has taken sick!<br>	So he took his two sons with him, Menashe and Efrayim. . . .2 	They told Yaakov, saying: Here, your son Yosef is coming to you,<br>	so Yisrael gathered his strength and sat up in the bed.3 	Yaakov said to Yosef:<br>	God Shaddai was seen by me<br>	in Luz, in the land of Canaan;<br>	he blessed me4 	and he said to me:<br>	Here, I will make you bear fruit and will make you many,<br>	and will make you into a host of peoples;<br>	I will give this land to your seed after you, as a holding for the ages!5 	So-now,<br>	your two sons who were born to you in the land of Egypt<br>	before I came to you in Egypt,<br>	they are mine;<br>	Efrayim and Menashe,<br>	like Re’uven and Shim’on, let them be mine!6 	But your begotten sons, whom you will beget after them,<br>	let them be yours;<br>	by their brothers’ names let them be called, regarding their hereditary-property.7 	While I—<br>	when I came back from Paddan,<br>	Rahel died on me,<br>	in the land of Canaan,<br>	on the way, with still a stretch of land left to come to Efrat.<br>	There I buried her, on the way to Efrat—that is now Bet-Lehem.8 	And Yisrael saw Yosef’s sons; he said:<br>	Who are these?9 	Yosef said to his father:<br>	They are my sons, whom God has given me here.<br>	He said:<br>	Pray take them over to me, that I may give-them-blessing.10 	Now Yisrael’s eyes were heavy with age, and he was not able to see.<br>	He brought them close to him,<br>	and he kissed them and embraced them.11 	Yisrael said to Yosef:<br>	I never thought to see your face [again],<br>	and here, God has let me see your seed as well!12 	Yosef took them from between his knees<br>	and they bowed low, their nostrils to the earth.13 	Yosef took the two of them,<br>	Efrayim with his right-hand, to Yisrael’s left,<br>	and Menashe with his left-hand, to Yisrael’s right,<br>	and brought them close to him.14 	But Yisrael stretched out his right-hand and put it on the head of Efrayim—yet he was the younger!—<br>	and his left-hand on the head of Menashe;<br>	he crossed his arms, although Menashe was the firstborn.15 	Then he blessed Yosef and said:<br>	The God<br>	in whose presence my fathers walked,<br>	Avraham and Yitzhak,<br>	the God<br>	who has tended me<br>	ever since I was [born], until this day—16 	the messenger<br>	who has redeemed me from all ill-fortune,<br>	may he bless the lads!<br>	May my name continue to be called through them<br>	and the name of my fathers, Avraham and Yitzhak!<br>	May they teem-like-fish to [become] many in the midst of the land!17 	Now Yosef saw that his father had put his right hand on Efrayim’s head,<br>	and it sat ill in his eyes,<br>	so he laid hold of his father’s hand, to turn it from Efrayim’s head to Menashe’s head.18 	Yosef said to his father:<br>	Not so, father, indeed, this one is the firstborn, place your hand on his head!19 	But his father refused and said:<br>	I know, my son, I know—<br>	he too will be a people, he too will be great,<br>	yet his younger brother will be greater than he, and his seed will become a full-measure of nations!20 	So he blessed them on that day,<br>	saying:<br>	By you shall Israel give-blessings, saying:<br>	God make you like Efrayim and Menashe!<br>	Thus he made Efrayim go before Menashe.21 	Then Yisrael said to Yosef:<br>	Here, I am dying,<br>	but God will be with you;<br>	he will have you return to the land of your fathers.22 	As for me, I give you<br>	one portion over and above your brothers,<br>	which I took away from the Amorite,<br>	with my sword, with my bow.49:1 @ 	Then Yaakov called his sons and said:<br>	Gather round, that I may tell you<br>	what will befall you in the aftertime of days.2 		Come together and hearken, sons of Yaakov,<br>		hearken to Yisrael your father.3 @ 		Re’uven,<br>		my firstborn, you,<br>		my might, first-fruit of my vigor!<br>		Surpassing in loftiness, surpassing in force!4 		Headlong like water—surpass no more!<br>		For when you mounted your father’s bed,<br>		then you profaned it—he mounted

colt to a crimson tendril;<br>		he washes his raiment in wine,<br>		his mantle in the blood of grapes;12 		his eyes, darker than wine,<br>		his teeth, whiter than milk.13 @ 		Zevulun,<br>		on the shore of the sea he dwells;<br>		he is a haven-shore for boats,<br>		his flank upon Tzidon.14 		Yissakhar,<br>		a bone-strong donkey,<br>		crouching among the fire-places.15 		He saw how good the resting-place was,<br>		and how pleasant was the land,<br>		so he bent his shoulder to bearing<br>		and became a laboring serf.16 @ 		Dan,<br>		his people will mete-out-judgment,<br>		[to all] of

divides up the spoil.28 @ 	All these are the tribes of Israel, twelve,<br>	and this is what their father spoke to them;<br>	he blessed them,<br>	according to what belonged to each as blessing, he blessed them.29 	And he charged them, saying to them:<br>	I am now about to be gathered to my kinspeople;<br>	bury me by my fathers,<br>	in the cave that is in the field of Efron the Hittite,30 	at the cave that is in the field of Makhpela, that faces Mamre, in the land of Canaan.<br>	—Avraham had acquired that field from Efron the Hittite, as a burial holding.31 	There they buried Avraham and Sara his wife,<br>	there they buried Yitzhak and Rivka his wife,<br>	there I buried Le’a—32 	an acquisition, the field and the cave that is in it, from the Sons of Het.33 @ 	Yaakov had finished charging his sons;<br>	then he gathered up his feet onto the bed and expired,<br>	and was gathered to his kinspeople.50:1 @ 	Yosef flung himself on his father’s face;<br>	he wept over him and kissed him.2 	Then Yosef charged his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father,<br>	and the physicians embalmed Yisrael.3 	A full forty days were required for him,<br>	for thus are fulfilled the days of embalming.<br>	And the Egyptians wept for him for seventy days.4 	[When] the days of weeping for him had passed,<br>	Yosef spoke to Pharaoh’s household, saying:<br>	Pray, if I have found favor in your eyes,<br>	pray speak in the hearing of Pharaoh, saying:5 	My father had me swear, saying:<br>	Here, I am dying—<br>	in my burial-site which I dug for myself in the land of Canaan,<br>	there you are to bury me!<br>	So now,<br>	pray let me go up, bury my father, and return.6 	Pharaoh said:<br>	Go up and bury your father, as he had you swear.7 	So Yosef went up to bury his father;<br>	and with him went up all of Pharaoh’s court-servants,<br>	the elders of his household and all the elders of the land of Egypt,8 	all of Yosef’s household,<br>	his brothers and his father’s household.<br>	Only their little-ones, their sheep, and their oxen did they leave behind in the region of Goshen.9 	And along with him went up chariots as well, and horsemen as well—<br>	the company was an exceedingly heavy one.10 	They came as far as Goren Ha-Atad/Bramble Threshing-Floor, which is in [the country] across the Jordan,<br>	and there they beat [the breast], an exceedingly great and heavy breast-beating,<br>	and he held mourning for his father, for seven days.11 	The settled-folk of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at Bramble Threshing-Floor,<br>	and they said:<br>	This is such a heavy mourning/<i>evel</i> for Egypt!<br>	Therefore its name was called: Meadow/<i>avel</i> of Egypt,<br>	which is in [the country] across the Jordan.12 	So his sons did thus for him, as he had charged them:13 	his sons carried him back to the land of Canaan<br>	and buried him in the cave in the field of Makhpela.<br>	—Avraham had acquired that field as a burial holding from Efron the Hittite, [the field] facing Mamre.14 	Then Yosef returned to Egypt,<br>	he and his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father,<br>	after he had buried his father.15 @ 	[When] Yosef’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said:<br>	What if Yosef holds-a-grudge against us<br>	and repays, yes, repays us for all the ill that we caused him!16 	So they charged Yosef, saying:<br>	Your father charged before his death, saying:17 	Say thus to Yosef:<br>	Ah, pray forgive your brothers’ offense and their sin, that they caused you ill!<br>	Now, pray forgive the offense of the servants of your father’s God!<br>	Yosef wept as they spoke to him.18 	And his brothers themselves came, they flung themselves down before him and said:<br>	Here we are, servants to you!19 	But Yosef said to them:<br>	Do not be afraid! For am I in place of God?20 	Now you, you planned ill against me,<br>	[but] God planned-it-over for good,<br>	in order to do as [is] this day—<br>	to keep many people alive.21 	So now, do not be afraid!<br>	I myself will sustain you and your little-ones!<br>	And he comforted them and spoke to their hearts.22 @ 	So Yosef stayed in Egypt, he and his father’s household.<br>	Yosef lived a hundred and ten years;23 	and Yosef saw from Efrayim sons of the third generation,<br>	and also the sons of Makhir son of Menashe were born on Yosef’s knees.24 	Yosef said to his brothers:<br>	I am dying,<br>	but God will take account, yes, account of you;<br>	he will bring you up from this land<br>	to the land about which he swore<br>	to Avraham, to Yitzhak, and to Yaakov.25 	And Yosef had the Sons of Israel swear, saying:<br>	God will take account, yes, account of you;<br>	bring my bones up from here!26 	And Yosef died, a hundred and ten years old.<br>	They embalmed him and they put him in a coffin<br>	in Egypt.EXODUS1:1 @ 	Now these are the names of the children of Israel who came to Egypt&mdash;<br>	with Yaakov, each-man and his household they came:2 	Re’uven, Shim’on, Levi and Yehuda,3 	Yissakhar, Zevulun and Binyamin,4 	Dan and Naftali, Gad and Asher.5 	So all the persons, those issuing from Yaakov’s loins, were seventy persons,<br>	—Yosef was [already] in Egypt.6 @ 	Now Yosef died, and all his brothers, and all that generation.7 	Yet the Children of Israel bore fruit, they swarmed, they became many, they grew mighty [in number]—exceedingly, yes, exceedingly;<br>	the land filled up with them.8 @ 	Now a new king arose over Egypt, who had not known Yosef.9 	He said to his people:<br>	Here, the people of the Children of Israel is many-more and mightier [in number] than we!10 	Come-now, let us use-our-wits against it,<br>	lest it become many-more,<br>	and then, if war should occur,<br>	it too be added to our enemies<br>	and make war upon us<br>	or go up away from the land!11 	So they set gang-captains over it, to afflict it with their burdens.<br>	It built storage-cities for Pharaoh—Pitom and Ra’amses.12 	But as they afflicted it, so did it become many, so did it burst forth.<br>	And they felt dread before the Children of Israel.13 	So they, Egypt, made the Children of Israel subservient with crushing-labor;14 	they embittered their lives with hard servitude in loam and in bricks and with all kinds of servitude in the field—<br>	all their service in which they made them subservient with crushing-labor.15 @ 	Now the king of Egypt said to the midwives of the Hebrews<br>	—of whom the name of the first one was Shifra, and the name of the second was Pu’a—16 	he said:<br>	When you help the Hebrew women give birth, keep sight of the supporting-stones:<br>	if he be a son, put him to death,<br>	but if she be a daughter, she may live.17 	But the midwives held God in awe,<br>	and they did not do as the king of Egypt had spoken to them;<br>	they let the [male] children live.18 	The king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them:<br>	For-what-reason have you done this thing, and let the children live?19 	The midwives said to Pharaoh:<br>	Indeed, not like the Egyptian-women are the Hebrew-women,<br>	indeed, they are lively:<br>	before the midwife comes to them, they have given birth!20 	God dealt well with the midwives.<br>	And the people became many and grew exceedingly mighty [in number].21 	It was, since the midwives held God in awe, that he made them households.22 	But Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying:<br>	Every son that is born, throw him into the Nile,<br>	but let every daughter live.2:1 @ 	A man from the house of Levi went and took [to wife] a daughter of Levi.2 	The woman became pregnant and bore a son.<br>	She saw him—that he was goodly, so she hid him, for three months.3 	And [when] she was no longer able to hide him,<br>	she took for him a little-ark of papyrus,<br>	she loamed it with loam and with pitch,<br>	and placed the child in it,<br>	and placed it in the reeds by the shore of the Nile.4 	And his sister stationed herself far off, to know what would be done to him.5 @ 	Pharaoh’s daughter went down to bathe at the Nile,<br>	and her girls were walking along the Nile.<br>	She saw the little-ark among the reeds<br>	and sent her maid, and she took it.6 	She opened [it] and saw him, the child—<br>	now here, a boy weeping!<br>	She pitied him, and she said:<br>	One of the Hebrews’ children is this!7 	His sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter:<br>	Shall I go and call a nursing woman from the Hebrews for you,<br>	that she may nurse the child for you?8 	Pharaoh’s daughter said to her:<br>	Go!<br>	So the girl went and called the child’s mother.9 	Pharaoh’s daughter said to her:<br>	Have this child go with you and nurse him for me,<br>	and I myself will give you your wages.<br>	So the woman took the child and she nursed him.10 	The child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter,<br>	and he became her son.<br>	She called his name: Moshe/He-Who-Pulls-Out;<br>	she said: For out of the water <i>meshitihu</i>/I-pulled-him.11 @ 	Now it was some years later, Moshe grew up;<br>	he went out to his brothers and saw their burdens.<br>	And he saw an Egyptian man striking a Hebrew man, [one] of his brothers.12 	He turned this-way and that-way, and saw that there was no man [there],<br>	so he struck down the Egyptian<br>	and buried him in the sand.13 	He went out again on the next day, and here: two Hebrew men scuffling!<br>	He said to the guilty one:<br>	Why do you strike your fellow?14 	He said:<br>	Who made you prince and judge over us?<br>	Do you mean to kill me<br>	as you killed the Egyptian?<br>	Moshe became afraid and said:<br>	Surely the matter is known!15 	Pharaoh heard of this matter and sought to kill Moshe.<br>	But Moshe fled from Pharaoh’s face and settled in the land of Midyan;<br>	he sat down by a well.16 @ 	Now the priest of Midyan had seven daughters;<br>	they came, they drew [water] and they filled the troughs,<br>	to give-drink to their father’s sheep.17 	Shepherds came and drove them away.<br>	But Moshe rose up, he delivered them and gave-drink to their sheep.18 	They came [home] to Re’uel their father, and he said:<br>	For-what-reason have you come [home] so quickly today?19 	They said:<br>	An Egyptian man rescued us from the hand of the shepherds,<br>	and also he drew, yes, drew for us and watered the sheep!20 	He said to his daughters:<br>	So-where-is-he?<br>	Why, then, have you left the man behind?<br>	Call him, that he may eat bread!21 @ 	Moshe agreed to settle down with the man,<br>	and he gave Tzippora his daughter to Moshe.22 	She gave birth to a son,<br>	and he called his name: Gershom/Sojourner There,<br>	for he said: A sojourner have I become in a foreign land.23 @ 	It was, many years later,<br>	that the king of Egypt died.<br>	But the Children of Israel groaned from the servitude,<br>	and they cried out;<br>	and their plea-for-help went up to God, from the servitude.24 	God hearkened to their moaning;<br>	God called-to-mind his covenant with Avraham, with Yitzhak, and with Yaakov;25 	God saw the Children of Israel;<br>	God knew.3:1 @ 	Now Moshe was shepherding the flock of Yitro his father- in-law, priest of Midyan.<br>	He led the flock behind the wilderness,<br>	and came to the mountain of God, to Horev.2 	And <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> messenger was seen by him<br>	as the flame of a fire out of the midst of a bush.<br>	He saw:<br>	now here, the bush is burning with fire,<br>	but the bush is not consumed!3 	Moshe said:<br>	Now let me turn aside<br>	that I may see this great sight—<br>	for-what-reason does the bush not burn up?4 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> saw that he turned aside to see,<br>	so God called to him out of the midst of the bush;<br>	he said:<br>	Moshe! Moshe!<br>	He said:<br>	Here I am.5 	He said:<br>	Do not come near to here;<br>	put off your sandal from your foot,<br>	for the place on which you stand—it is holy ground!6 	And he said:<br>	I am the God of your father,<br>	the God of Avraham,<br>	the God of Yitzhak,<br>	and the God of Yaakov.<br>	Moshe concealed his face,<br>	for he was afraid to gaze upon God.7 	Now <sc>Yhwh</sc> said:<br>	I have seen, yes, seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt,<br>	their cry I have heard in the face of their slave-drivers;<br>	indeed, I have known their sufferings!8 	So I have come down<br>	to rescue it from the hand of Egypt,<br>	to bring it up from that land<br>	to a land, goodly and spacious,<br>	to a land flowing with milk and honey,<br>	to the place of the Canaanite and the Hittite,<br>	of the Amorite and the Perizzite,<br>	of the Hivvite and the Yevusite.9 	So-now,<br>	here, the cry of the Children of Israel has come to me,<br>	and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.10 	So now, go,<br>	for I send you to Pharaoh—<br>	bring my people, the Children of Israel, out of Egypt!11 	Moshe said to God:<br>	Who am I<br>	that I should go to Pharaoh,<br>	that I should bring the Children of Israel out of Egypt?12 	He said:<br>	Indeed, I will be with you,<br>	and this is the sign for you that I myself have sent you:<br>	[when] you have brought the people out of Egypt,<br>	you will [all] serve God by this mountain.13 	Moshe said to God:<br>	Here, I will come to the Children of Israel<br>	and I will say to them:<br>	The God of your fathers has sent me to you,<br>	but they will say to me: What is his name?—<br>	what shall I say to them?14 	God said to Moshe:<br>	<sc>Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh</sc>/I will be however I will be.<br>	And he said:<br>	Thus shall you say to the Children of Israel:<br>	<sc>Ehyeh/I-Will-Be</sc> has sent me to you.15 	And God said further to Moshe:<br>	Thus shall you say to the Children of Israel:<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	the God of your fathers,<br>	the God of Avraham, the God of Yitzhak, and the God of Yaakov,<br>	has sent me to you.<br>	That is my name for the ages,<br>	that is my title [from] generation to generation.16 	Go,<br>	gather the elders of Israel<br>	and say to them:<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc>, the God of your fathers, has been seen by me,<br>	the God of Avraham, of Yitzhak, and of Yaakov,<br>	saying:<br>	I have taken account, yes, account of you and of what is being done to you in Egypt,17 	and I have declared:<br>	I will bring you up from the affliction of Egypt,<br>	to the land of the Canaanite and of the Hittite,<br>	of the Amorite and of the Perizzite,<br>	of the Hivvite and of the Yevusite,<br>	to a land flowing with milk and honey.18 	They will hearken to your voice,<br>	and you will come, you and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt<br>	and say to him:<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc>, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us—<br>	so now, pray let us go a three days’ journey into the wilderness<br>	and let us sacrifice to <sc>Yhwh</sc> our God!19 	But I, I know<br>	that the king of Egypt will not give you leave to go,<br>	not [even] under a strong hand.20 	So I will send forth my hand<br>	and I will strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in its midst—<br>	after that he will send you free!21 	And I will give this people favor in the eyes of Egypt;<br>	it will be that when you go, you shall not go empty-handed:22 	each woman shall ask of her neighbor and of the sojourner in her house<br>	objects of silver and objects of gold, and clothing;<br>	you shall put [them] on your sons and on your daughters—<br>	so shall you strip Egypt!4:1 @ 	Moshe spoke up, he said:<br>	But they will not trust me, and will not hearken to my voice,<br>	indeed, they will say: <sc>Yhwh</sc> has not been seen by you. . . !2 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to him:<br>	What is that in your hand?<br>	He said:<br>	A staff.3 	He said:<br>	Throw it to the earth!<br>	He threw it to the earth, and it became a snake,<br>	and Moshe fled from its face.4 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Send forth your hand! Seize it by its tail!<br>	—He sent forth his hand and took hold of it, and it became a staff in his fist—5 	so that they may trust that <sc>Yhwh</sc>, the God of their fathers,<br>	the God of Avraham, the God of Yitzhak, and the God of Yaakov, has been seen by you.6 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said further to him:<br>	Pray put your hand in your bosom!<br>	He put his hand in his bosom, and then he took it out,<br>	and here: his hand had <i>tzaraat,</i> like snow!7 	Now he said:<br>	Return your hand to your bosom!<br>	He returned his hand to his bosom; then he took it out of his bosom,<br>	and here, it had returned [to be] like his flesh.8 	So it shall be, if they do not trust you, and do not hearken to the voice of the former sign,<br>	that they will put their trust in the voice of the latter sign.9 	And it shall be, if they do not put their trust in even these two signs, and do not hearken to your voice,<br>	then take some of the water of the Nile<br>	and pour it out on the dry-land,<br>	and the water that you take from the Nile will become blood on the dry-land.10 	Moshe said to <sc>Yhwh</sc>:<br>	Please, my Lord,<br>	no man of words am I,<br>	not from yesterday, not from the day-before, not [even] since you have spoken to your servant,<br>	for heavy of mouth and heavy of tongue am I!11 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to him:<br>	Who placed a mouth in human beings<br>	or who [is it that] makes one mute or deaf<br>	or open-eyed or blind?<br>	Is it not I, <sc>Yhwh</sc>?12 	So now, go!<br>	I myself will be with your mouth<br>	and will instruct you as to what you are to speak.13 	But he said:<br>	Please, my Lord,<br>	pray send by whose hand you will send!14 	<sc>Yhwh’s</sc> anger flared up against Moshe;<br>	he said:<br>	Is there not Aharon your brother, the Levite—<br>	I know that <i>he</i> can speak, yes, speak,<br>	and here, he is even going out to meet you;<br>	when he sees you, he will rejoice in his heart.15 	You shall speak to him,<br>	you shall put the words in his mouth!<br>	I myself will be with your mouth and with his mouth,<br>	and will instruct you [both] as to what you shall do.16 	He shall speak for you to the people;<br>	he, he shall be a mouth for you, and you, you shall be a god for him.17 	And this staff, take in your hand,<br>	with which you shall do the signs.18 @ 	Moshe went and returned to Yitro his father-in-law<br>	and said to him:<br>	Now pray let me go and return to my brothers who are in Egypt,<br>	that I may see whether they are still alive.<br> 	Yitro said to Moshe:<br>	Go in peace!19 	Now <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe in Midyan:<br>	Go, return to Egypt,<br>	for all the men who were seeking your life have died.20 	So Moshe took his wife and his sons and mounted them upon a donkey, to return to the land of Egypt,<br>	and Moshe took the staff of God in his hand.21 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	When you go to return to Egypt,<br>	see:<br>	all the portents that I have put in your hand, you are to do before Pharaoh,<br>	but I will make his heart strong-willed, so that he will not send the people free.22 	Then you are to say to Pharaoh:<br>	Thus says <sc>Yhwh</sc>:<br>	My son, my firstborn, is Israel!23 	I said to you: Send free my son, that he may serve me,<br>	but you have refused to send him free,<br>	[so] here, I will kill your son, your firstborn!24 @ 	Now it was on the journey, at the night-camp,<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> encountered him and sought to make him die.25 	Tzippora took a flint and cut off her son’s foreskin;<br>	she touched it to his legs and said:<br>	Indeed, a bridegroom of blood are you to me!26 	And he released him.<br>	Then she said, “a bridegroom of blood” upon the circumcision-cuttings.27 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Aharon:<br>	Go to meet Moshe in the wilderness!<br>	He went, he encountered him at the mountain of God<br>	and he kissed him.28 	And Moshe told Aharon all <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> words with which he had sent him<br>	and all the signs with which he had charged him.29 	Moshe and Aharon went;<br>	they gathered all the elders of the Children of Israel,30 	and Aharon spoke all the words which <sc>Yhwh</sc> had spoken to Moshe,<br>	and did the signs before the people’s eyes.31 	The people trusted;<br>	they hearkened<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> had taken account of the Children of Israel,<br>	that he had seen their affliction.<br>	And they did homage and bowed low.5:1 @ 	Afterward Moshe and Aharon came and said to Pharaoh:<br>	Thus says <sc>Yhwh</sc>, the God of Israel:<br>	Send free my people, that they may hold-a-festival to me in the wilderness!2 	Pharaoh said:<br>	Who is <sc>Yhwh</sc>, that I should hearken to his voice to send Israel free?<br>	I do not know <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	moreover, Israel I will not send free!3 	They said:<br>	The God of the Hebrews has met with us;<br>	now let us go a three days’ journey into the wilderness,<br>	and let us sacrifice to <sc>Yhwh</sc> our God,<br>	lest he confront us with the pestilence or the sword!4 	The king of Egypt said to them:<br>	Why, Moshe and Aharon,<br>	would you let the people loose from their tasks?<br>	Go back to your burdens!5 	Pharaoh said:<br>	Here, too many now are the people of the land,<br>	and you would have them cease from their burdens!6 	So that day Pharaoh commanded the slave-drivers of the people and its officers, saying:7 	You are no longer to give straw to the people to make the bricks as yesterday [and the] day-before;<br>	let it be them that go and gather straw for themselves!8 	But the [same] measure of bricks that they have been making, yesterday [and the] day-before,<br>	you are to impose on them;<br>	you are not to subtract from it!<br>	For they are lax—<br>	therefore they cry out, saying: Let us go, let us sacrifice to our God!9 	Let the servitude weigh-heavily on the men!<br>	They shall have to do it, so that they pay no more regard to false words!10 	The slave-drivers of the people and its officers went out<br>	and said to the people, saying:<br>	Thus says Pharaoh:<br>	I will not give you straw:11 	<i>You<i> go, get yourselves straw, wherever you can find [it];<br>	indeed, not one [load] is to be subtracted from your servitude!12 	The people scattered throughout all the land of Egypt,<br>	gathering stubble-gatherings for straw.13 	But the slave-drivers pressed them hard, saying:<br>	Finish your tasks, each-day’s work-load in its day, as when there was straw!14 	And they were beaten, the officers of the Children of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s slave-drivers had set over them; <br>	they said [to them]:<br>	For-what-reason have you not finished baking your allocation as yesterday [and the] day-before,<br>	so yesterday, so today?15 	So the officers of the Children of Israel came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying:<br>	Why do you do thus to your servants?16 	No straw is being given to your servants, and as for bricks—they say to us, Make [them]!<br>	Here, your servants are being beaten, and the fault is your people’s!17 	But he said:<br>	Lax are you, lax,<br>	therefore you say: Let us go, let us sacrifice to <sc>Yhwh</sc>—18 	so-now, go, serve;<br>	no straw will be given to you,<br>	and the full-measure in bricks you must give back!19 	The officers of the Children of Israel saw that they were in an ill-plight,<br>	[having] to say: Do not subtract from your bricks each-day’s work-load in its day!20 	They confronted Moshe and Aharon, stationing themselves to meet them when they came out from Pharaoh;21 	they said to them:<br>	May <sc>Yhwh</sc> see you and judge,<br>	for having made our smell reek in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants,<br>	giving a sword into their hand, to kill us!22 	Moshe returned to <sc>Yhwh</sc> and said:<br>	My Lord,<br>	why have you dealt so ill with this people?<br>	Why have you sent me?23 	Since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has dealt only ill with this people,<br>	and rescued—you have not rescued your people!6:1 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh:<br>	for with a strong hand he will send them free,<br>	and with a strong hand he will drive them out of his land.2 @ 	God spoke to Moshe,<br>	he said to him:<br>	I am <sc>Yhwh</sc>.3 	I was seen by Avraham, by Yitzhak, and by Yaakov<br>	as God Shaddai,<br>	but [by] my name <sc>Yhwh</sc> I was not known to them.4 	I also established my covenant with them,<br>	to give them the land of Canaan,<br>	the land of their sojournings, where they had sojourned.5 	And I have also heard the moaning of the Children of Israel,<br>	whom Egypt is holding-in-servitude,<br>	and I have called-to-mind my covenant.6 	Therefore,<br>	say to the Children of Israel:<br>	I am <sc>Yhwh</sc>.<br>	I will bring you out<br>	from beneath the burdens of Egypt;<br>	I will rescue you<br>	from servitude to them;<br>	I will redeem you<br>	with an outstretched arm, with great acts-of-judgment;7 	I will take you<br>	for me as a people,<br>	and I will be for you<br>	as a God;<br>	and you shall know<br>	that I am <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	who brings you out<br>	from beneath the burdens of Egypt.8 	I will bring you<br>	into the land [over] which I lifted my hand [in an oath] to give to Avraham, to Yitzhak, and to Yaakov.<br>	I will give it to you as a possession,<br>	I, <sc>Yhwh</sc>.9 	Moshe spoke thus to the Children of Israel.<br>	But they did not hearken to Moshe,<br>	out of shortness of spirit and out of hard servitude.10 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:11 	Go in, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt,<br>	that he may send free the Children of Israel from his land.12 	Moshe spoke before <sc>Yhwh</sc>, saying:<br>	Here, [if] the Children of Israel do not hearken to me,<br>	how will Pharaoh hearken to me?<br>	And I am of foreskinned lips!13 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe and to Aharon,<br>	and charged them to the Children of Israel and to Pharaoh king of Egypt,<br>	to bring the Children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.14 @ 	These are the heads of their Fathers’ Houses:<br>	The sons of Re’uven, firstborn of Israel: Hanokh and Pallu, Hetzron and Karmi;<br>	these are the clans of Re’uven.15 	And the sons of Shim’on: Yemuel, Yamin, Ohad, Yakhin and Tzohar, and Sha’ul the son of the Canaanite-woman;<br>	these are the clans of Shim’on.16 	Now these are the names of the Sons of Levi according to their begettings:<br>	Gershon, Kehat and Merari.<br>	Now the years of Levi’s life were seven and thirty and a hundred years.17 	The sons of Gershon: Livni and Shim’i, according to their clans.18 	And the sons of Kehat: Amram, Yitzhar, Hevron and Uzziel.<br>	Now the years of Kehat’s life were three and thirty and a hundred years.19 	And the sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi.<br>	These are the Levite clans, according to their begettings.20 	Amram took himself Yokheved his aunt as a wife,<br>	and she bore him Aharon and Moshe.<br>	Now the years of Amram’s life were seven and thirty and a hundred years.21 	Now the sons of Yitzhar: Korah, Nefeg and Zikhri.22 	And the sons of Uzziel: Mishael, Eltzafan and Sitri.23 	Aharon took himself Elisheva daughter of Amminadav, Nahshon’s sister, as a wife.<br>	She bore him Nadav and Avihu, Elazar and Itamar.24 	Now the sons of Korah: Assir, Elkana and Aviasaf; these are the Korahite clans.25 	Elazar son of Aharon took himself one of Putiel’s daughters for himself as a wife,<br>	and she bore him Pin’has.<br>	These are the heads of the Levite father-groupings according to their clans.26 	That is [the] Aharon and Moshe to whom <sc>Yhwh</sc> said:<br>	Bring the Children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their forces;27 	[it was] they who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the Children of Israel out of Egypt,<br>	that Moshe and Aharon.28 @ 	So it was on the day that <sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe in the land of Egypt,29 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:<br>	I am <sc>Yhwh</sc>;<br>	speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak to you.30 	Moshe said before <sc>Yhwh</sc>:<br>	Here, I am of foreskinned lips,<br>	so how will Pharaoh hearken to me?7:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	See, I make you as a god for Pharaoh,<br>	and Aharon your brother will be your prophet.2 	You are to speak all that I command you,<br>	and Aharon your brother is to speak to Pharaoh<br>	so that he may send free the Children of Israel from his land.3 	But I,<br>	I will harden Pharaoh’s heart,<br>	I will make my signs and my portents many in the land of Egypt:4 	Pharaoh will not hearken to you,<br>	so I will set my hand against Egypt,<br>	and I will bring out my forces,<br>	my people, the Children of Israel,<br>	from the land of Egypt, with great acts-of-judgment.5 	Ansd the Egyptians will know that I am <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	when I stretch out my hand over Egypt and bring the Children of Israel out from their midst!6 	Moshe and Aharon did [it];<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded them, thus they did.7 	Now Moshe was eighty years old, and Aharon was eighty-three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.8 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe and to Aharon, saying:9 	When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying: Give, you, a portent,<br>	then say to Aharon:<br>	Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh&mdash;let it become a serpent!10 	Moshe and Aharon came to Pharaoh,<br>	and they did thus, as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded;<br>	Aharon threw down his staff before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent.11 	Pharaoh too called for the wise men and for the sorcerers,<br>	that they too, the magicians of Egypt, should do thus with their occult-arts,12 	and they threw down, each one, his staff, and these became serpents.<br>	But Aharon’s staff swallowed up their staffs.13 	Yet Pharaoh’s heart remained strong-willed, and he did not hearken to them,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had spoken.14 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Pharaoh’s heart is heavy-with-stubbornness—he refuses to send the people free.15 	Go to Pharaoh in the morning: here, he goes out to the Nile.<br>	Station yourself to meet him by the shore of the Nile,<br>	and the staff that changed into a snake, take in your hand,16 	and say to him:<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc>, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying:<br>	Send free my people, that they may serve me in the wilderness!<br>	But here, you have not hearkened thus far.17 	Thus says <sc>Yhwh</sc>:<br>	By this shall you know that I am <sc>Yhwh</sc>:<br>	here, I will strike—with the staff that is in my hand—upon the water that is in the Nile,<br>	and it will change into blood!18 	The fish that are in the Nile will die, and the Nile will reek,<br>	and the Egyptians will be unable to drink water from the Nile.19 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Say to Aharon:<br>	Take your staff<br>	and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their tributaries, over their Nile-canals, over their ponds and over all their bodies of water,<br>	and let them become blood!<br>	There will be blood throughout all the land of Egypt—in the wooden-containers, in the stoneware.20 	Moshe and Aharon did thus, as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded them.<br>	He raised the staff and struck the water in the Nile, before the eyes of Pharaoh and before the eyes of his servants,<br>	and all the water that was in the Nile changed into blood.21 	The fish that were in the Nile died, and the Nile reeked,<br>	and the Egyptians could not drink water from the Nile;<br>	the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt.22 	But the magicians of Egypt did thus with their occult-arts,<br>	and Pharaoh’s heart remained strong-willed, and he did not hearken to them,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had spoken.23 	So Pharaoh faced about and came into his house; neither did he pay any mind to this.24 	But all Egypt had to dig around the Nile to drink water,<br>	for they could not drink from the waters of the Nile.25 	Seven days were fulfilled, after <sc>Yhwh</sc> had struck the Nile.26 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Come to Pharaoh and say to him:<br>	Thus says <sc>Yhwh</sc>:<br>	Send free my people, that they may serve me!27 	Now if you refuse to send them free,<br>	here, I will smite your entire territory with frogs.28 	The Nile will swarm with frogs;<br>	they will ascend, they will come<br>	into your house, into your bedroom, upon your couch,<br>	into your servants’ houses, in among your people,<br>	into your ovens and into your dough-pans&mdash;29 	onto you, onto your people, onto all your servants will the frogs ascend!8:1 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Say to Aharon:<br>	Stretch out your hand with your staff, over the tributaries, over the Nile-canals, and over the ponds,<br>	and make the frogs ascend upon the land of Egypt!2 	Aharon stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt,<br>	the frog-horde ascended<br>	and covered the land of Egypt.3 	Now the magicians did thus with their occult-arts:<br>	they made frogs ascend upon the land of Egypt.4 	Pharaoh had Moshe and Aharon called<br>	and said:<br>	Plead with <sc>Yhwh</sc>, that he may remove the frogs from me and from my people,<br>	and I will send the people free, that they may sacrifice to <sc>Yhwh</sc>!5 	Moshe said to Pharaoh:<br>	Be praised over me:<br>	For when shall I plead for you, for your servants, for your people,<br>	to cut off the frogs from you and from your houses,<br>	[so that] only in the Nile will they remain?6 	He said:<br>	For the morrow.<br>	He said:<br>	According to your words, [then]!<br>	In order that you may know<br>	that there is none like <sc>Yhwh</sc> our God.7 	The frogs shall remove from you, from your houses, from your servants, from your people;<br>	only in the Nile shall they remain.8 	Moshe and Aharon went out from Pharaoh,<br>	and Moshe cried out to <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	on account of the frogs that he had imposed upon Pharaoh.9 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> did according to Moshe’s words:<br>	the frogs died away, from the houses, from the courtyards, and from the fields.10 	They piled them up, heaps upon heaps, and the land reeked.11 	But Pharaoh saw that there was breathing-room,<br>	so he made his heart heavy-with-stubbornness, and did not hearken to them,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had spoken.12 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Say to Aharon:<br>	Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the earth;<br>	it will become gnats throughout all the land of Egypt!13 	They did thus;<br>	Aharon stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the earth,<br>	and gnats were on man and on beast;<br>	all the dust of the earth became gnats throughout all the land of Egypt.14 	Now the magicians did thus with their occult-arts, to bring forth the gnats, but they could not,<br>	and the gnats were on man and on beast.15 	The magicians said to Pharaoh:<br>	This is the finger of a god!<br>	But Pharaoh’s heart remained strong-willed, and he did not hearken to them,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had spoken.16 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Start-early in the morning, station yourself before Pharaoh—here, he goes out to the water&mdash;<br>	and say to him:<br>	Thus says <sc>Yhwh</sc>:<br>	Send free my people, that they may serve me!17 	Indeed, if you do not send my people free,<br>	here, I will send upon you, upon your servants, upon your people, upon your houses—<br>	an insect-swarm,<br>	the houses of Egypt will be full of the insects,<br>	as well as the ground upon which they are!18 	But I will make distinct, on that day, the region of Goshen, where my people is situated,<br>	so that there will be no insects there,<br>	in order that you may know that I am <sc>Yhwh</sc> in the land.19 	And I will put a ransom between my people and your people—<br>	on the morrow will this sign occur.20 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> did thus:<br>	heavy insect-swarms came into Pharaoh’s house, into the houses of his servants, throughout all the land of Egypt;<br>	the land was in ruins in the face of the insects.21 	Pharaoh had Moshe and Aharon called<br>	and said:<br>	Go, sacrifice to your god in the land!22 	Moshe said:<br>	It would not be wise to do thuswise:<br>	for Egypt’s abomination is what we sacrifice to our God;<br>	if we were to sacrifice Egypt’s abomination before their eyes,<br>	would they not stone us?23 	Let us go a three days’ journey into the wilderness,<br>	and we shall sacrifice to <sc>Yhwh</sc> our God, as he has said to us.24 	Pharaoh said:<br>	I will send you free,<br>	that you may sacrifice to <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God in the wilderness;<br>	only: you are not to go far, too far!<br>	Plead for me!25 	Moshe said:<br>	Here, when I go out from you, I will plead with <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	and the insects will remove from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, on the morrow,<br>	only: let not Pharaoh continue to deal-wantonly [with us],<br>	by not sending the people free to sacrifice to <sc>Yhwh</sc>!26 	Moshe went out from before Pharaoh and pleaded with <sc>Yhwh</sc>.27 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> did according to Moshe’s words,<br>	he removed the insects from Pharaoh, from his servants and from his people&mdash;<br>	not one remained.28 	But Pharaoh made his heart heavy-with-stubbornness this time as well,<br>	and he did not send the people free.9:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Come to Pharaoh and speak to him:<br>	Thus says <sc>Yhwh</sc>, the God of the Hebrews:<br>	Send free my people, that they may serve me!2 	If you refuse to send [them] free, and continue to hold-on-strongly to them,3 	here, <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> hand will be on your livestock in the field,<br>	on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels, on the oxen, and on the sheep—<br>	an exceedingly heavy pestilence!4 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> will make-a-distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt:<br>	there will not die among all that belong to the Children of Israel a thing!5 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> set an appointed-time, saying:<br>	On the morrow, <sc>Yhwh</sc> will do this thing in the land.6 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> did that thing on the morrow—<br>	all the livestock of Egypt died,<br>	but of the livestock of the Children of Israel, there died not one.7 	Pharaoh sent [to inquire], and here: there had not died of the livestock of the Children of Israel even one.<br>	But Pharaoh’s heart remained heavy-with-stubbornness, and he did not send the people free.8 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe and to Aharon:<br>	Take yourselves fistfuls of soot from a furnace<br>	and let Moshe toss it heavenward before Pharaoh’s eyes;9 	it will become fine-dust on all the land of Egypt,<br>	and on man and on beast, it will become boils sprouting into blisters,<br>	throughout all the land of Egypt!10 	They took the soot from a furnace and stood before Pharaoh, and Moshe tossed it heavenward,<br>	and it became boil blisters, sprouting on man and on beast.11 	Now the magicians could not stand before Moshe because of the boils,<br>	for the boils were upon the magicians and upon all Egypt.12 	But <sc>Yhwh</sc> made Pharaoh’s heart strong-willed, and he did not hearken to them,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had said to Moshe.13 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Start-early in the morning, station yourself before Pharaoh and say to him:<br>	Thus says <sc>Yhwh</sc>, the God of the Hebrews:<br>	Send free my people, that they may serve me!14 	Indeed, this time I will send all my blows upon your heart, and against your servants, and against your people,<br>	so that you may know that there is none like me throughout all the land;15 	indeed, by now I could have sent out my hand and struck you and your people with the pestilence,<br>	and you would have been effaced from the land;16 	however, just on account of this I have allowed you to withstand,<br>	to make you see my power.<br>	and in order that they might recount my name throughout all the land.17 	[But] still you set yourself up over my people, by not sending them free—18 	here, around this time tomorrow I will cause to rain down an exceedingly heavy hail,<br>	the like of which has never been in Egypt from the days of its founding until now!19 	So-now:<br>	send [word]: give refuge to your livestock and to all that is yours in the field;<br>	all men and beasts who are found in the field and who have not been gathered into the house—<br>	the hail will come down upon them, and they will die!20 	Whoever had awe for the word of <sc>Yhwh</sc> among Pharaoh’s servants had his servants and his livestock flee into the houses,21 	but whoever did not pay any mind to the word of <sc>Yhwh</sc> left his servants and his livestock out in the field.22 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Stretch out your hand toward the heavens,<br>	and let there be hail throughout all the land of Egypt,<br>	on man and on beast and on all the plants of the field, throughout the land of Egypt!23 	Moshe stretched out his staff toward the heavens,<br>	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> gave forth thunder-sounds and hail, and fire went toward the earth,<br>	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> caused hail to rain down upon the land of Egypt.24 	There was hail and a fire taking-hold-of-itself amidst the hail, exceedingly heavy,<br>	the like of which had never been throughout all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation.25 	The hail struck, throughout all the land of Egypt, all that was in the field, from man to beast;<br>	all the plants of the field the hail struck, and all the trees of the field it broke down;26 	only in the region of Goshen, where the Children of Israel were, was there no hail.27 	Pharaoh sent and had Moshe and Aharon called<br>	and said to them:<br>	This-time I have sinned!<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> is the one-in-the-right, I and my people are the ones-in-the-wrong!28 	Plead with <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	for too much is the God-thunder and this hail!<br>	Let me send you free—do not continue staying here!29 	Moshe said to him:<br>	As soon as I have gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands to <sc>Yhwh</sc>;<br>	the thunder will stop and the hail will be no more—<br>	in order that you may know that the land belongs to <sc>Yhwh</sc>.30 	But as for you and your servants,<br>	I know well that you do not yet stand-in-fear<br>	before the face of <sc>Yhwh</sc> God!31 	—Now the flax and the barley were stricken, for the barley was in ears and the flax was in buds,32 	but the wheat and the spelt were not stricken, for they are late-ripening.—33 	Moshe went from Pharaoh, outside the city, and spread out his hands to <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	and the thunder and the hail stopped, and the rain no longer poured down to earth.34 	Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had stopped,<br>	so he continued to sin: he made his heart heavy-with-stubbornness, his and his servants’.35 	Pharaoh’s heart remained strong-willed, and he did not send the Children of Israel free,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had spoken through Moshe.10:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Come to Pharaoh!<br>	For I have made his heart and the heart of his servants heavy-with-stubbornness,<br>	in order that I may put these my signs among them2 	and in order that you may recount in the hearing of your child and of your child’s child<br>	how I have dealt-wantonly with Egypt,<br>	and my signs, which I have placed upon them—<br>	that you may know that I am <sc>Yhwh</sc>.3 	Moshe and Aharon came to Pharaoh, they said to him:<br>	Thus says <sc>Yhwh</sc>, the God of the Hebrews:<br>	Until when will you refuse to humble yourself before me?<br>	Send free my people, that they may serve me!4 	But if you refuse to send my people free,<br>	here, on the morrow I will bring the locust-horde into your territory!5 	They will cover the aspect of the earth, so that one will not be able to see the earth;<br>	they will consume what is left of what escaped, of what remains for you from the hail,<br>	and they will consume all the trees that spring up for you from the field.6 	They will fill your houses, the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all Egypt,<br>	as neither your fathers nor your fathers’ fathers have seen<br>	from the day of their being upon the soil until this day.<br>	He turned and went out from Pharaoh.7 	Pharaoh’s servants said to him:<br>	Until when will this one be a snare to us?<br>	Send the men free, that they may serve <sc>Yhwh</sc> their God!<br>	Do you not yet know that Egypt is lost?8 	Moshe and Aharon were returned to Pharaoh,<br>	and he said to them:<br>	Go, serve <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God!<br>	—Who is it, who is it that would go?9 	Moshe said:<br>	With our young ones, with our elders we will go,<br>	with our sons and with our daughters,<br>	with our sheep and with our oxen we will go—<br>	for it is <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> pilgrimage-festival for us.10 	He said to them:<br>	May <sc>Yhwh</sc> be thus with you, the same as I mean to send you free along with your little-ones!<br>	You see—yes, your faces are set toward ill!11 	Not thus—go now, O males, and serve <sc>Yhwh</sc>, for <i>that<i> is what you seek!<br>	And they were driven out from Pharaoh’s face.12 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locust-horde,<br>	and it will ascend over the land of Egypt and consume all the plants of the land, all that the hail allowed to remain.13 	Moshe stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt,<br>	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> led in an east wind against the land<br>	all that day and all night;<br>	when it was daybreak, the east wind had borne in the locust-horde.14 	The locust-horde ascended over all the land of Egypt,<br>	it came to rest upon all the territory of Egypt,<br>	exceedingly heavy;<br>	before it there was no such locust-horde as it, and after it there will be no such again.15 	It covered the aspect of all the earth, and the earth became dark;<br>	it consumed all the plants of the land, and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left;<br>	nothing at all green was left of the trees and of the plants of the field, throughout all the land of Egypt.16 	Quickly Pharaoh had Moshe and Aharon called<br>	and said:<br>	I have sinned against <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God and against you!17 	So now,<br>	pray bear my sin just this one time!<br>	And plead with <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	that he may only remove this death from me!18 	He went out from Pharaoh and pleaded with <sc>Yhwh</sc>,19 	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> reversed an exceedingly strong sea wind<br>	which bore the locusts away and dashed them into the Sea of Reeds;<br>	not one locust remained throughout all the territory of Egypt.20 	But <sc>Yhwh</sc> made Pharaoh’s heart strong-willed, and he did not send the Children of Israel free.21 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Stretch out your hand toward the heavens,<br>	and let there be darkness over the land of Egypt,<br>	so that one will feel darkness!22 	Moshe stretched out his hand toward the heavens,<br>	and there was gloomy darkness throughout all the land of Egypt, for three days;23 	no one could see his brother, and no one could arise from his spot, for three days.<br>	But for all the Children of Israel, there was light in their settlements.24 	Pharaoh had Moshe called and said:<br>	Go, serve <sc>Yhwh</sc>;<br>	only your sheep and your oxen shall be kept back&mdash;<br>	even your little-ones may go with you!25 	Moshe said:<br>	You must also give sacrifices and offerings-up into our hand, so that we may make [sacrifice] to <sc>Yhwh</sc> our God!26 	Even our livestock must go with us; not a hoof may remain behind,<br>	for some of them we must take to serve <sc>Yhwh</sc> our God;<br>	we—we do not know how we are to serve <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	until we come there.27 	But <sc>Yhwh</sc> made Pharaoh’s heart strong-willed, so that he would not consent to send them free.28 	Pharaoh said to him:<br>	Go from me!<br>	Take you care:<br>	You are not to see my face again,<br>	for on the day that you see my face, you shall die!29 	Moshe said:<br>	You have spoken well;<br>	I will not henceforth see your face again!11:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	I will cause one more blow<br>	to come upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt;<br>	afterward he will send you free from here.<br>	When he sends you free, it is finished—he will drive, yes, drive you out from here.2 	Pray speak in the hearing of the people:<br>	they shall ask, each man of his neighbor, each woman of her neighbor, objects of silver and objects of gold.3 	So <sc>Yhwh</sc> gave the people favor in the eyes of Egypt,<br>	while the man Moshe was [considered] exceedingly great in the land of Egypt,<br>	in the eyes of Pharaoh’s servants and in the eyes of the people.4 	Moshe said:<br>	Thus says <sc>Yhwh</sc>:<br>	In the middle of the night<br>	I will go forth throughout the midst of Egypt,5 	and every firstborn shall die throughout the land of Egypt,<br>	from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne<br>	to the firstborn of the maid who is behind the handmill,<br>	and every firstborn of beast.6 	Then shall there be a cry throughout all the land of Egypt,<br>	the like of which has never been, the like of which will never be again.7 	But against all the Children of Israel, not a dog shall wag its tongue, against either man or beast,<br>	in order that you may know that <sc>Yhwh</sc> makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.8 	Then all these your servants shall go down to me,<br>	they shall bow to me, saying:<br>	Go out, you and all the people who walk in your footsteps!<br>	And afterward I will go out.<br>	He went out from Pharaoh in flaming anger.9 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Pharaoh will not hearken to you,<br>	in order that my portents may be many in the land of Egypt.10 	Now Moshe and Aharon had done all the portents in Pharaoh’s presence,<br>	but <sc>Yhwh</sc> had made Pharaoh’s heart strong-willed, and he had not sent the Children of Israel free from his land.12:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe and to Aharon in the land of Egypt, saying:2 	Let this month be for you the beginning of months,<br>	the beginning-one let it be for you of the months of the year.3 	Speak to the entire community of Israel, saying:<br>	On the tenth day of this month<br>	they are to take them, each-man, a lamb, according to their Fathers’ House, a lamb per household.4 	Now if there be too few in the house for a lamb,<br>	he is to take [it], he and his neighbor who is near his house, by the computation according to the [number of] persons;<br>	each-man according to what he can eat you are to compute for the lamb.5 	A wholly-sound male, year-old lamb shall be yours; from the sheep and from the goats are you to take it.6 	It shall be for you in safekeeping, until the fourteenth day of this month,<br>	and they are to slaughter it—the entire assembly of the community of Israel—between the setting-times.7 	They are to take some of the blood and put it onto the two posts and onto the lintel,<br>	onto the houses in which they eat it.8 	And they are to eat the flesh on that night, roasted in fire,<br>	and <i>matzot;</i><br>	with bitter-herbs they are to eat it.9 	Do not eat any of it raw, or boiled, boiled in water,<br>	but rather roasted in fire, its head along with its legs, along with its innards.10 	You are not to leave any of it until morning;<br>	what is left of it until morning, with fire you are to burn.11 	And thus you are to eat it:<br>	your hips girded, your sandals on your feet, and your sticks in your hand.<br>	And you are to eat it in trepidation—<br>	it is a Passover-Meal to <sc>Yhwh</sc>.12 	I will proceed through the land of Egypt on this night<br>	and will strike down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from man to beast,<br>	while on all the gods of Egypt I will render judgment,<br>	I, <sc>Yhwh!</sc>.13 	Now the blood will be a sign for you upon the houses where you are:<br>	I will see the blood, and I will pass over you,<br>	so that the blow will not become a bringer-of-ruin to you, when I strike down the land of Egypt.14 	Now this day shall be a reminder for you;<br>	you are to celebrate it as a pilgrimage-celebration for <sc>Yhwh</sc>;<br>	throughout your generations, as a law for the ages you are to celebrate it!15 	For seven days, <i>matzot</i> you are to eat;<br>	already on the first day you are to get rid of leaven from your houses,<br>	for anyone who eats what is fermented—from the first day until the seventh day—: that person shall be cut off from Israel!16 	And on the first day, a proclamation of holiness,<br>	and on the seventh day, a proclamation of holiness shall there be for you&mdash;<br>	no kind of work is to be made on them;<br>	only what belongs to every person to eat, that alone may be made-ready by you.17 	And keep the [Festival of] <i>Matzot!</i><br>	For on this same day<br>	I have brought out your forces from the land of Egypt.<br>	Keep this day throughout your generations as a law for the ages.18 	In the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month, at sunset, you are to eat <i>matzot,</i><br>	until the twenty-first day of the month, at sunset.19 	For seven days, no leaven is to be found in your houses,<br>	for whoever eats what ferments, that person shall be cut off from the community of Israel,<br>	whether sojourner or native of the land.20 	Anything that ferments you are not to eat;<br>	in all your settlements, you are to eat <i>matzot.</i>21 	Moshe had all the elders of Israel called and said to them:<br>	Pick out, take yourselves a sheep for your clans, and slaughter the Passover-animal.22 	Then take a band of hyssop, dip [it] in the blood which is in the basin,<br>	and touch the lintel and the two posts with some of the blood which is in the basin.<br>	Now you—you are not to go out, any man from the entrance to his house, until daybreak.23 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> will proceed to deal-blows to Egypt,<br>	and [when] he sees the blood on the lintel and on the two posts, <br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> will pass over the entrance,<br>	and will not give the ruinbringer [leave] to come into your houses to deal-the-blow.24 	You are to keep this matter<br>	as a law for you and for your children, into the ages!25 	Now it will be,<br>	when you come to the land which <sc>Yhwh</sc> will give you, as he has promised,<br>	you are to keep this service!26 	And it will be,<br>	when your children say to you: What does this service [mean] to you?27 	then say:<br>	It is the sacrificial-meal of Passover to <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	who passed over the houses of the Children of Israel in Egypt,<br>	when he dealt-the-blow to Egypt and our houses he rescued.<br>	The people did homage and bowed low.28 	And the Children of Israel went and did [it];<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe and Aharon, thus they did.29 @ 	Now it was in the middle of the night:<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> struck down every firstborn in the land of Egypt,<br>	from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne<br>	to the firstborn of the captive in the dungeon,<br>	and every firstborn of beast.30 	Pharaoh arose at night,<br>	he and all his servants and all Egypt,<br>	and there was a great cry in Egypt,<br>	for there was not a house in which there was not one dead.31 	He had Moshe and Aharon called in the night<br>	and said:<br>	Arise, go out from amidst my people, even you, even the Children of Israel!<br>	Go, serve <sc>Yhwh</sc> according to your words:32 	even your sheep, even your oxen, take, as you have spoken, and go!<br>	And bring-a-blessing even on me!33 	Egypt pressed the people strongly, to send them out quickly from the land,<br>	for they said: We are all dead!34 	So the people loaded their dough before it had fermented, their kneading-troughs bound in their clothing, upon their shoulders.35 	Now the Children of Israel had done according to Moshe’s words:<br>	they had asked of the Egyptians objects of silver and objects of gold, and clothing;36 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> had given the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians,<br>	and they let themselves be asked of.<br>	So did they strip Egypt.37 @ 	The Children of Israel moved on from Ra’amses to Sukkot,<br>	about six hundred thousand on foot, menfolk apart from little-ones,38 	and also a mixed multitude went up with them,<br>	along with sheep and oxen, an exceedingly heavy [amount of] livestock.39 	Now they baked the dough which they had brought out of Egypt into <i>matzot</i> cakes, for it had not fermented,<br>	for they had been driven out of Egypt, and were not able to linger,<br>	and neither had they made provisions for themselves.40 @ 	Now the settlement of the Children of Israel which they had settled in Egypt was thirty years and four hundred years.41 	It was at the end of thirty years and four hundred years,<br>	it was on that same day:<br>	all of <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> forces went out from the land of Egypt.42 	It is a night of keeping-watch for <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	to bring them out of the land of Egypt;<br>	that is this night for <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	a keeping-watch of all the Children of Israel, throughout their generations.43 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe and Aharon:<br>	This is the law of the Passover-meal:<br>	Any foreign son is not to eat of it.44 	But any man’s serf who is acquired for silver—if you have circumcised him, then he may eat of it.45 	Settler and hired-hand are not to eat of it.46 	In one house it is to be eaten;<br>	you are not to bring out of the house any of the flesh, outside.<br>	And you are not to break a bone of it.47 	The entire community of Israel is to do it.48 	Now when a sojourner sojourns with you, and would make the Passover-meal to <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	every male with him must be circumcised, then he may come near to make it, and will be [regarded] as a native of the land.<br>	But any foreskinned-man is not to eat of it.49 	One Instruction shall there be for the native and for the sojourner who sojourns in your midst!50 	All the Children of Israel did [it];<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> commanded Moshe and Aharon, thus they did.51 @ 	It was on that same day:<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> brought the Children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their forces.1  @    <sc>YHWH<sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:2 	Hallow to me every firstborn,<br>	breacher of every womb among the Children of Israel, of man or of beast&mdash;<br>	it is mine.3 	Moshe said to the people:<br>	Keep this day in mind,<br>	on which you went out from Egypt, from a house of serfs,<br>	for by strength of hand <sc>Yhwh</sc> brought you out from here:<br>	no fermentation is to be eaten.4 	Today you are going out, in the month of Ripe-Grain.5 	And it shall be,<br>	when <sc>Yhwh</sc> brings you to the land of the Canaanite,<br>	of the Hittite, of the Amorite, of the Hivvite and of the Yevusite,<br>	which he swore to your fathers to give you,<br>	a land flowing with milk and honey,<br>	you are to serve this service, in this month:6 	for seven days you are to eat <i>matzot,</i><br>	and on the seventh day is a pilgrimage-festival to <sc>Yhwh</sc>.7 	<i>Matzot</i> are to be eaten for the seven days,<br>	nothing fermented is to be seen with you; no leaven is to be seen with you, throughout all your territory.8 	And you are to tell your child on that day, saying:<br>	It is because of what <sc>Yhwh</sc> did for me, when I went out of Egypt.9 	It shall be for you for a sign on your hand and for a reminder between your eyes,<br>	in order that <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> Instruction may be in your mouth,<br>	that by a strong hand did <sc>Yhwh</sc> bring you out of Egypt.10 	You are to keep this law at its appointed-time from year-day to year-day!11 	And it shall be,<br>	when <sc>Yhwh</sc> brings you to the land of the Canaanite, as he swore to you and to your fathers,<br>	and gives it to you,12 	you are to transfer every breacher of a womb to <sc>Yhwh</sc>, every breacher, offspring of a beast that belongs to you;<br>	the males are for <sc>Yhwh</sc>.13 	Every breacher of a donkey you are to redeem with a lamb;<br>	if you do not redeem [it], you are to break-its-neck.<br>	And every firstborn of men, among your sons, you are to redeem.14 	It shall be<br>	when your child asks you on the morrow, saying: What does this [mean]?<br>	you are to say to him:<br>	By strength of hand <sc>Yhwh</sc> brought us out of Egypt, out of a house of serfs.15 	And it was<br>	when Pharaoh hardened [his heart] against sending us free,<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> killed every firstborn throughout the land of Egypt,<br>	from the firstborn of man to the firstborn of beast.<br>	Therefore I myself sacrifice to <sc>Yhwh</sc> every breacher of a womb, the males,<br>	and every firstborn of my sons I redeem.16 	It shall be for a sign on your hand and for headbands between your eyes,<br>	for by strength of hand <sc>Yhwh</sc> brought us out of Egypt.17 @ 	Now it was, when Pharaoh had sent the people free,<br>	that God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines, though it is nearer,<br>	for God said [to himself]:<br>	Lest the people regret it, when they see war,<br>	and return to Egypt!18 	So God had the people swing about by way of the wilderness at the Sea of Reeds.<br>	And the Children of Israel went up armed from the land of Egypt.19 	Now Moshe had taken Yosef’s bones with him,<br>	for he had made the Children of Israel swear, yes, swear, saying:<br>	God will take account, yes, account of you—so bring my bones up from here with you!20 	They marched on from Sukkot and encamped in Etam at the edge of the wilderness.21 	Now <sc>Yhwh</sc> was going before them,<br>	by day as a column of cloud, to lead them the way,<br>	by night as a column of fire, to give light to them,<br>	to [be able to] go by day and by night.22 	There would not retire<br>	the column of cloud by day<br>	or the column of fire by night<br>	from before the people.14:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:2 	Speak to the Children of Israel,<br>	that they may turn back and encamp before Pi ha-Hirot, between Migdol and the sea;<br>	before Baal-Tzefon, opposite it, you are to encamp by the sea.3 	Now Pharaoh will say of the Children of Israel:<br>	They are confused in the land! The wilderness has closed them in!4 	And I will make Pharaoh’s heart strong-willed, so that he pursues them,<br>	and I will be glorified through Pharaoh and all his army,<br>	so that the Egyptians may know that I am <sc>Yhwh</sc>.<br>	They did thus.5 	The king of Egypt was told that the people fled,<br>	and Pharaoh’s heart and [that of] his servants changed regarding the people, they said:<br>	What, now, have we done, that we have sent free Israel from serving us?6 	He had his chariot harnessed,<br>	while his fighting-people he took with him,7 	and he took six hundred selected chariots and every [kind of] chariot of Egypt,<br>	teams-of-three upon them all.8 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> made the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt strong-willed, so that he pursued the Children of Israel,<br>	while the Children of Israel were going out with a high hand.9 	The Egyptians pursued them and overtook them encamped by the sea,<br>	all of Pharaoh’s chariot-horses, his riders, and his army,<br>	by Pi ha-Hirot, before Baal-Tzefon.10 	As Pharaoh drew near, the Children of Israel lifted up their eyes:<br>	now here, Egypt marching after them!<br>	They were exceedingly afraid.<br>	And the Children of Israel cried out to <sc>Yhwh</sc>,11 	they said to Moshe:<br>	Is it because there are no graves in Egypt<br>	that you have taken us out to die in the wilderness?<br>	What, now, have you done to us, bringing us out of Egypt?12 	Is this not the very word that we spoke to you in Egypt,<br>	saying: Let us alone, that we may serve Egypt!<br>	Indeed, better for us serving Egypt<br>	than our dying in the wilderness!13 	Moshe said to the people:<br>	Do not be afraid!<br>	Stand fast and see<br>	<sc>Yhwh’s</sc> deliverance which he will work for you today,<br>	for as you see Egypt today, you will never see it again for the ages!14 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> will do battle for you, and you—be still!15 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Why do you cry out to me?<br>	Speak to the Children of Israel, and let-them-march-forward!16 	And you—<br>	hold your staff high, stretch out your hand over the sea<br>	and split it,<br>	so that the Children of Israel may come through the midst of the sea upon the dry-land.17 	While I,<br>	here, I will make Egypt’s heart strong-willed,<br>	so that they come in after them,<br>	and I will be glorified through Pharaoh and all his army,<br>	his chariots and his riders;18 	and the Egyptians shall know that I am <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	when I am glorified through Pharaoh, his chariots and his riders.19 	The messenger of God that was going before the camp of Israel moved on and went behind them;<br>	the column of cloud moved ahead of them<br>	and stood behind them,20 	and came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel.<br>	Here were the cloud and the darkness,<br>	and it lit up the night;<br>	this one did not come near this one all night.21 	Moshe stretched out his hand over the sea,<br>	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> caused the sea to go back<br>	with a fierce east wind all night,<br>	and made the sea into firm-ground;<br>	thus the waters split.22 	The Children of Israel came through the midst of the sea upon the dry-land,<br>	the waters a wall for them on their right and on their left.23 	But the Egyptians pursued and came in after them,<br>	all of Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots and his riders,<br>	into the midst of the sea.24 	Now it was at the daybreak watch<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> looked out against the camp of Egypt in the column of fire and cloud,<br>	and he panicked the camp of Egypt;25 	he loosened the wheels of his chariots and made them to drive with heaviness.<br>	Egypt said:<br>	I must flee before Israel,<br>	for <sc>Yhwh</sc> does battle for them against Egypt!26 	Then <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Stretch out your hand over the sea,<br>	and the waters shall return<br>	upon Egypt—upon its chariots and upon its riders.27 	Moshe stretched out his hand over the sea,<br>	and the sea returned, at the face of daybreak, to its original-place,<br>	as the Egyptians were fleeing toward it.<br>	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> shook the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.28 	The waters returned;<br>	they covered the chariots and the riders of all of Pharaoh’s army that had come after them into the sea,<br>	not even one of them remained.29 	But the Children of Israel had gone upon dry-land, through the midst of the sea,<br>	the waters a wall for them on their right and on their left.30 	So <sc>Yhwh</sc> delivered Israel on that day from the hand of Egypt;<br>	Israel saw Egypt dead by the shore of the sea,31 	and Israel saw the great hand that <sc>Yhwh</sc> had wrought against Egypt.<br>	The people held <sc>Yhwh</sc> in awe;<br>	they trusted in <sc>Yhwh</sc> and in Moshe his servant.15:1 @ 	Then sang Moshe and the Children of Israel<br>	this song to <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	they said, saying:<br> @ 		I will sing to <sc>Yhwh</sc>, <br>		for he has triumphed, yes, triumphed, <br>		the horse and its charioteer he flung into the sea!2 @ 		My fierce-might and strength is <sc>Yah</sc>,<br>		he has become deliverance for me!<br> @ 			This is my God—I laud him, <br>			the God of my father—I exalt him!3 @ 		<sc>Yhwh</sc> is a man of war,<br>		<sc>Yhwh</sc> is his name!4 @ 		Pharaoh’s chariots and his army<br>		he hurled into the sea, <br>		his choicest teams-of-three<br>		sank in the Sea of Reeds.5 		Oceans covered them, <br>		they went down in the depths <br>		like a stone.6 @ 		Your right-hand, O <sc>Yhwh</sc>, <br>		majestic in power, <br>		your right-hand, O <sc>Yhwh</sc>, <br>		shattered the enemy.7 @ 		In your great triumph<br>		you smashed your foes, <br>		sent forth your flaming-anger, <br>		consumed them like chaff.8 @ 		By the breath of your nostrils <br>		the waters piled up,<br>		the gushing-streams stood up like a dam, <br>		the oceans congealed in the heart of the sea.9 @ 		Uttered the enemy: <br>		I will pursue, <br>		overtake, <br>		and apportion the spoils, <br>		my greed will be filled on them, <br>		my sword I will draw, <br>		my hand—dispossess them!10 		You blew with your breath, <br>		the sea covered them, <br>		they plunged down like lead <br>		in majestic waters.11 @ 		Who is like you among the gods, O <sc>Yhwh</sc>? <br>		Who is like you, majestic among the holy-ones, <br>		Feared-One of praises, Doer of Wonders?12 		You stretched out your right-hand, <br>		the Underworld swallowed them.13 @ 		You led in your faithfulness <br>		your people redeemed, <br>		guided [them] in your fierce-might <br>		to your holy pasture.14 @ 		The peoples heard,<br>		they shuddered; <br>		writhing seized <br>		Philistia’s inhabitants,15 		and then, terrified, <br>		Edom’s chieftains, <br>		Moav’s “rams”— <br>		trembling did seize them; <br>		then they quivered, <br>		all Canaan’s inhabitants.16 @ 		There fell upon them <br>		dread and anguish; <br>		before your arm’s great [power] <br>		they grew dumb like stone.17 @ 			Until they crossed—your people, O <sc>Yhwh</sc>, <br>			until they crossed—the people you fashioned. <br>			You brought them, you planted them <br>			on the mount of your heritage, <br>			foundation of your [royal] seat <br>			which you prepared, O <sc>Yhwh</sc>, <br>			the Holy-Shrine, O Lord, <br>			founded by your hands.18 			May <sc>Yhwh</sc> be king for the ages, eternity!19 @ 	For Pharaoh’s horses came with [their] chariots and riders into the sea,<br>	but <sc>Yhwh</sc> turned back the sea’s waters upon them,<br>	and the Children of Israel went upon the dry-land<br>	through the midst of the sea.20 @ 	Miryam the prophetess, Aharon’s sister, took a timbrel in her hand,<br>	and all the women went out after her, with timbrels and with dancing.21 	Miryam chanted to them: <br>		Sing to <sc>Yhwh</sc>, for he has triumphed, yes, triumphed, <br>		the horse and its charioteer he flung into the sea!22 @ 	Moshe had Israel march on from the Sea of Reeds,<br>	and they went out to the Wilderness of Shur.<br>	They traveled through the wilderness for three days, and found no water.23 	They came to Mara,<br>	but they could not drink water from Mara, because it was <i>mar</i>/bitter.<br>	Therefore they called its name Mara.24 	And the people grumbled against Moshe, saying:<br>	What are we to drink?25 	He cried out to <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> directed him [to some] wood;<br>	he threw [it] into the water, and the water became sweet.—<br>	There he imposed law and judgment for them, and there he tested them:26 	he said:<br>	If you will hearken, yes, hearken to the voice of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	and what is right in his eyes will do,<br>	and will give-ear to his commandments<br>	and keep all his laws,<br>	all the sicknesses which I have imposed upon Egypt, I will not impose upon you,<br>	for I am <sc>Yhwh</sc>, your healer!27 @ 	They came to Elim;<br>	there were twelve springs of water<br>	and seventy palms,<br>	and they camped there by the water.16:1 @ 	They marched on from Elim, and they came, the entire community of the Children of Israel, to the Wilderness of Syn, which is between Elim and Sinai,<br>	on the fifteenth day of the second month after their going-out from the land of Egypt.2 	And they grumbled, the entire community of the Children of Israel, against Moshe and against Aharon in the wilderness.3 	The Children of Israel said to them:<br>	Would that we had died by the hand of <sc>Yhwh</sc> in the land of Egypt,<br>	when we sat by the meat pots,<br>	when we ate bread till [we were] satisfied!<br>	For you have brought us into this wilderness<br>	to bring death to this whole assembly by starvation!4 		<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Here, I will make rain down upon you bread from the heavens;<br>	the people shall go out and glean, each day’s amount in its day,<br>	in order that I may test them, whether they will walk according to my Instruction or not.5 	But it shall be on the sixth day:<br>	[when] they prepare what they have brought in,<br>	it shall be a double-portion compared to what they glean day [after] day.6 	Moshe and Aharon said to all the Children of Israel:<br>	At sunset<br>	you will know that it is <sc>Yhwh</sc> who brought you out of the land of Egypt;7 	at daybreak<br>	you will see the Glory of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	when he hearkens to your grumblings against <sc>Yhwh</sc>—<br>	and what are we, that you grumble against us?8 	And Moshe said:<br>	When <sc>Yhwh</sc> gives you<br>	meat to eat at sunset,<br>	and at daybreak, bread to satisfy [yourselves];<br>	when <sc>Yhwh</sc> hearkens to your grumblings which you grumble against him&mdash;<br>	and what are we?<br>	Not against us are your grumblings, but against <sc>Yhwh</sc>!9 	Moshe said to Aharon:<br>	Say to the entire community of the Children of Israel:<br>	Come near, in the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	for he has hearkened to your grumblings!10 	Now it was, when Aharon spoke to the entire community of the Children of Israel,<br>	that they faced the wilderness,<br>	and here,<br>	the Glory of <sc>Yhwh</sc> could be seen in the cloud.11 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:12 	I have hearkened to the grumblings of the Children of Israel—<br>	speak to them, saying:<br>	Between the setting-times you shall eat meat,<br>	and at daybreak you shall be satisfied with bread,<br>	and you shall know<br>	that I am <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God.13 	Now it was at sunset<br>	a horde-of-quail came up and covered the camp.<br>	And at daybreak<br>	there was a layer of dew around the camp;14 	and [when] the layer of dew went up,<br>	now here, upon the surface of the wilderness,<br>	[something] fine, scaly,<br>	fine as hoar-frost upon the land.15 	The Children of Israel saw it<br>	and they said, each one to his brother:<br>	<i>Mahn hu</i>/What is it?<br>	For they did not know what it was.<br>	Moshe said to them:<br>	It is the bread that <sc>Yhwh</sc> has given you for eating.16 	This is the matter that <sc>Yhwh</sc> has commanded:<br>	Glean from it, each according to what he can eat,<br>	an <i>omer</i> per capita, according to the number of your persons;<br>	each one, for those in his tent, you are to take.17 	The Children of Israel did thus;<br>	they gleaned, the-one-more and the-one-less,18 	but when they measured by the <i>omer,</i><br>	no surplus had the-one-more, and the-one-less had no shortage;<br>	each had gleaned according to what he could eat.19 	Moshe said to them:<br>	No one shall leave any of it until daybreak!20 	But they did not hearken to Moshe,<br>	and [several] men left some of it until daybreak;<br>	it became wormy with maggots and reeked.<br>	And Moshe became furious with them.21 	They gleaned it at daybreak, [every] daybreak, each in accordance with what he could eat,<br>	but when the sun heated up, it melted.22 	Now it was on the sixth day<br>	that they gleaned a double-portion of bread, two <i>omers</i> for [each] one.<br>	All the exalted-leaders of the community came and told it to Moshe.23 	He said to them:<br>	It is what <sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke about:<br>	tomorrow is a Sabbath/Ceasing, a Sabbath of Holiness for <sc>Yhwh</sc>.<br>	Whatever you wish to bake—bake, and whatever you wish to boil—boil,<br>	while all the surplus, put aside for yourselves in safekeeping until morning.24 	They put it aside until morning, as Moshe had commanded,<br>	and it did not reek, neither were there any maggots in it.25 	Moshe said:<br>	Eat it today,<br>	for today is a Sabbath for <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	today you will not find it in the field.26 	For six days you are to glean,<br>	but on the seventh day is Sabbath, there will not be [any] on it.27 	But it was on the seventh day<br>	that some of the people went out to glean, and they did not find.28 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Until when will you refuse to keep my commandments and my instructions?29 	[You] see<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> has given you the Sabbath,<br>	therefore on the sixth day, he gives you bread for two days.<br>	Stay, each one, in his spot;<br>	no one is to go out from his place on the seventh day!30 	So the people ceased on the seventh day.31 	And the House of Israel called its name: <i>Mahn.</i><br>	—It is like coriander seed, whitish,<br>	and its taste is like [that of] a wafer with honey.—32 	Moshe said:<br>	This is the matter that <sc>Yhwh</sc> has commanded:<br>	an <i>omer</i>-ful of it for safekeeping throughout your generations,<br>	in order that they may see the bread that I had you eat in the wilderness<br>	when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.33 	And Moshe said to Aharon:<br>	Take a vat and put an <i>omer</i>-ful of <i>mahn</i> in it,<br>	and put it aside in the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, in safekeeping throughout your generations.34 	As <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe, Aharon put it aside before the Testimony, in safekeeping.35 	And the Children of Israel ate the <i>mahn</i> for forty years, until they came to settled land;<br>	the <i>mahn</i> they ate, until they came to the edge of the land of Canaan.36 	Now an <i>omer</i>—it is a tenth of an <i>efa</i>.17:1 @ 	They marched on, the whole community of the Children of Israel, from the Wilderness of Syn,<br>	by their marching-stages, at <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> bidding.<br>	They encamped at Refidim,<br>	but there was no water for the people to drink!2 	The people quarreled with Moshe, they said:<br>	Give us water, that we may drink!<br>	Moshe said to them:<br>	Why do you quarrel with me?<br>	Why do you test <sc>Yhwh</sc>?3 	The people thirsted for water there,<br> 	and the people grumbled against Moshe, and said:<br>	Why, now, did you bring us up from Egypt,<br>	to bring death to me, to my children and to my livestock by thirst?4 	Moshe cried out to <sc>Yhwh</sc>, saying:<br>	What shall I do with this people?<br>	A little more and they will stone me!5 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Proceed before the people;<br>	take some of the elders of Israel with you,<br>	and your staff with which you struck the Nile, take in your hand,<br>	and go!6 	Here, I stand before you there on the rock at Horev;<br>	you are to strike the rock, and water shall come out of it, and the people shall drink.<br>	Moshe did thus, before the eyes of the elders of Israel.7 	And he called the name of the place: <i>Massa</i>/Testing, and <i>Meriva</i>/Quarreling,<br>	because of the quarreling of the Children of Israel,<br>	and because of their testing of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, saying:<br>	Is <sc>Yhwh</sc> in our midst, or not?8 @ 	Now Amalek came and did battle with Israel in Refidim.9 	Moshe said to Yehoshua:<br>	Choose us men,<br>	and go out, wage battle against Amalek!<br>	On the morrow I will station myself on top of the hill, with the staff of God in my hand.10 	Yehoshua did as Moshe had said to him,<br>	to wage battle against Amalek.<br>	Now Moshe, Aharon and Hur went up to the top of the hill,11 	and it would be, whenever Moshe raised his hand, Israel prevailed, and whenever he set down his hand, Amalek prevailed.12 	Now Moshe’s hands were heavy,<br>	so they took a stone and placed it under him, and he sat down on it,<br>	while Aharon and Hur supported his hands, one on this-side and one on this-side.<br>	So his hands remained steadfast, until the sun came in.13 	And Yehoshua weakened Amalek and his people, with the edge of the sword.14 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Write this as a memorial in a record<br>	and put it in Yehoshua’s hearing:<br>	Yes, I will wipe out, wipe out the memory of Amalek from under the heavens!15 	Moshe built an altar<br>	and called its name: <sc>Yhwh</sc> My Banner.16 	He said:<br>	Yes,<br>	hand on <sc>Yah’s</sc> throne!<br>	Battle for <sc>Yhwh</sc> against Amalek<br>	generation after generation!18:1 @ 	Now Yitro, the priest of Midyan, Moshe’s father-in-law, heard<br>	about all that God had done for Moshe and for Israel his people,<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> had brought Israel out of Egypt.2 	Yitro, Moshe’s father-in-law,<br>	took Tzippora, Moshe’s wife—after she had been sent home—3 	and her two sons,<br>	of whom the first one’s name was Gershom/Sojourner There,<br>	 for he had said: I have become a sojourner in a foreign land,4 	and the other’s name was Eliezer/God’s-Help, for: the God of my father is my help, he rescued me from Pharaoh’s sword;5 	and Yitro, Moshe’s father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moshe, to the wilderness, where he was encamped,<br>	at the mountain of God.6 	He [had it] said to Moshe:<br>	I, your father-in-law Yitro, am coming to you, and your wife and her two sons with her.7 	Moshe went out to meet his father-in-law,<br>	he bowed low and kissed him, and each asked after the other’s welfare;<br>	then they came into the tent.8 	And Moshe related to his father-in-law<br>	all that <sc>Yhwh</sc> had done to Pharaoh and to Egypt on Israel’s account,<br>	all the hardships that had befallen them on the journey,<br>	and [how] <sc>Yhwh</sc> had rescued them.9 	And Yitro was jubilant because of all the good that <sc>Yhwh</sc> had done for Israel, that he had rescued him from the land of Egypt.10 	Yitro said:<br>	Blessed be <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	who has rescued you from the hand of Egypt and from the hand of Pharaoh,<br>	who has rescued the people from under the hand of Egypt!11 	[So] now I know:<br>	yes, <sc>Yhwh</sc> is greater than all gods—<br>	yes, in just that matter in which they were presumptuous against them!12 	And Yitro, Moshe’s father-in-law, took an offering-up and sacrifices for God,<br>	and Aharon and all the elders of Israel came to eat bread with Moshe’s father-in-law, before the presence of God.13 	Now it was on the morrow<br>	that Moshe sat to judge the people,<br>	and the people stood before Moshe from daybreak until sunset.14 	Moshe’s father-in-law saw all that he had to do for the people;<br>	he said:<br>	What kind of matter is this that you do for the people—<br>	why do you sit alone, while the entire people stations itself around you<br>	from daybreak until sunset?15 	Moshe said to his father-in-law:<br>	When the people comes to me to inquire of God,16 	—when it has some legal-matter, it comes to me—<br>	I judge between a man and his neighbor<br>	and make known God’s laws and his instructions.17 	Then Moshe’s father-in-law said to him:<br>	Not good is this matter, as you do it!18 	You will become worn out, yes, worn out, so you, so this people that are with you,<br>	for this matter is too heavy for you;<br>	you cannot do it alone.19 	So now, hearken to my voice:<br>	I will advise you, so that God may be with you:<br>	Be, yourself, for the people in relation to God.<br>	You yourself should have the matters come to God;20 	You should make clear to them the laws and the instructions,<br>	you should make known to them the way they should go, and the deeds that they should do;21 	but you—you are to have the vision [to select] from all the people men of value, holding God in awe,<br>	men of truth, hating gain;<br>	you should set [them] over them<br>	as chiefs of thousands, chiefs of hundreds, chiefs of fifties, and chiefs of tens,22 	so that they may render judgment for the people at all times.<br>	So shall it be:<br>	every great matter they shall bring before you,<br>	but every small matter they shall judge by themselves.<br>	Make [it] light upon you, and let them bear [it] with you.23 	If you do this matter,<br>	[when] God commands you [further], you will be able to stand,<br>	and also this people will come to its place in peace.24 	Moshe hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law;<br>	he did it all as he had said:25 	Moshe chose men of value from all Israel;<br>	he placed them as heads over the people,<br>	as chiefs of thousands, chiefs of hundreds, chiefs of fifties, and chiefs of tens.26 	They would render judgment for the people at all times:<br>	the difficult matters they would bring before Moshe,<br>	but every small matter they would judge by themselves.27 	Moshe sent his father-in-law off,<br>	and he went home to his land.19:1 @ 	In the third month after the going-out of the Children of Israel from the land of Egypt,<br>	on that day<br>	they came to the Wilderness of Sinai.2 	They moved on from Refidim and came to the Wilderness of Sinai,<br>	and encamped in the wilderness.<br>	There Israel encamped, opposite the mountain.3 	Now Moshe went up to God,<br>	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> called out to him from the mountain,<br>	saying:<br>	Say thus to the House of Yaakov,<br>	[yes,] tell the Children of Israel:4 	You yourselves have seen<br>	what I did to Egypt,<br>	how I bore you on eagles’ wings and brought you to me.5 	So now,<br>	if you will hearken, yes, hearken to my voice<br>	and keep my covenant,<br>	you shall be to me a special-treasure from among all peoples.<br>	Indeed, all the earth is mine,6 	but you, you shall be to me<br>	a kingdom of priests,<br>	a holy nation.<br>	These are the words that you are to speak to the Children of Israel.7 	Moshe came, and had the elders of the people called,<br>	and he set before them these words, with which <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded him.8 	And all the people answered together, they said:<br>	All that <sc>Yhwh</sc> has spoken, we will do.<br>	And Moshe reported the words of the people to <sc>Yhwh</sc>.9 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Here, I am coming to you in a thick cloud,<br>	so that the people may hear when I speak with you,<br>	and also that they may have trust in you for ever.<br>	And Moshe told the words of the people to <sc>Yhwh</sc>.10 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Go to the people,<br>	make them holy, today and tomorrow,<br>	let them scrub their clothes,11 	that they may be ready for the third day,<br>	for on the third day<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> will come down before the eyes of all the people, upon Mount Sinai.12 	Fix-boundaries for the people all around, saying:<br>	Take you care against going up the mountain or against touching its border!<br>	Whoever touches the mountain is to be put to death, yes, death;13 	no hand is to touch him,<br>	but he is to be stoned, yes, stoned, or shot, yes, shot&mdash;<br>	whether beast or man, he is not to live!<br>	When the [sound of the] ram’s-horn is drawn out, they may go up on the mountain.14 	Moshe went down from the mountain to the people;<br>	he made the people holy, and they scrubbed their clothes.15 	Then he said to the people:<br>	Be ready for three days; do not approach a woman!16 	Now it was on the third day, when it was daybreak:<br>	There were thunder-sounds, and lightning,<br>	a heavy cloud on the mountain<br>	and an exceedingly strong <i>shofar</i> sound.<br>	And all of the people that were in the camp trembled.17 	Moshe brought the people out toward God, from the camp,<br>	and they stationed themselves beneath the mountain.18 	Now Mount Sinai emitted-smoke all over,<br>	since <sc>Yhwh</sc> had come down upon it in fire;<br>	its smoke went up like the smoke of a furnace,<br>	and all of the mountain trembled exceedingly.19 	Now the <i>shofar</i> sound was growing exceedingly stronger<br>	—Moshe kept speaking,<br>	and God kept answering him in the sound [of a voice]—20 	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> came down upon Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain.<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> called Moshe to the top of the mountain,<br>	and Moshe went up.21 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Go down, warn the people,<br>	lest they break through to <sc>Yhwh</sc> to see, and many of them fall;22 	even the priests who approach <sc>Yhwh</sc> must make themselves holy,<br>	lest <sc>Yhwh</sc> burst out against them!23 	But Moshe said to <sc>Yhwh</sc>:<br>	The people are not able to go up to Mount Sinai,<br>	for you yourself warned us, saying: Fix boundaries for the mountain and make it holy.24 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to him:<br>	Go, get down,<br>	and then come up, you and Aharon with you,<br>	but the priests and the people must not break through to go up to <sc>Yhwh</sc>, lest he burst out against them!25 	Moshe went down to the people and said to them20:1 @ 	God spoke all these words,<br>	saying:2 	I am <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	who brought you out<br>	from the land of Egypt, from a house of serfs. @ 	You are not to have<br>	any other gods<br>	before my presence.3 	You are not to make yourself a carved-image<br>	or any figure<br>	that is in the heavens above, that is on the earth beneath, that is in the waters beneath the earth;4 	you are not to bow down to them<br>	and you are not to serve them,<br>	for I, <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	am a zealous God,<br>	calling-to-account the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons, to the third and the fourth [generation]<br>	of those hating me,5 	but showing loyalty to the thousandth<br>	of those loving me,<br>	of those keeping my commandments.6 @ 	You are not to take up<br>	the name of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God for emptiness,<br>	for <sc>Yhwh</sc> will not clear anyone<br>	who takes up his name for emptiness.7 @ 	Be mindful<br>	of the Sabbath day, to hallow it.8 	For six days, you are to serve, and are to make all your work,9 	but the seventh day<br>	is Sabbath for <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God:<br>	you are not to make any work,<br>	you, and your son, and your daughter,<br>	your servant, and your maid, and your beast,<br>	and your sojourner who is within your gates.10 	For in six days<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> made<br>	the heavens and the earth,<br>	the sea and all that is in it,<br>	and he rested on the seventh day;<br>	therefore <sc>Yhwh</sc> gave the Sabbath day his blessing, and he hallowed it.11 @ 	Honor<br>	your father and your mother,<br>	in order that your days may be prolonged<br>	on the land that <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God is giving you.12 @ 	You are not to murder!<br>	You are not to adulter!<br>	You are not to steal!<br>	You are not to testify<br>	against your neighbor as a false witness!13 @ 	You are not to desire<br>	the house of your neighbor,<br>	you are not to desire the wife of your neighbor,<br>	or his servant, or his maid, or his ox, or his donkey,<br>	or anything that is your neighbor’s!14 @ 	Now all of the people were seeing<br>	the thunder-sounds,<br>	the flashing-torches,<br>	the <i>shofar</i> sound,<br>	and the mountain emitting-smoke;<br>	the people saw,<br>	and they faltered<br>	and stood far off.15 	They said to Moshe:<br>	<i>You</i> speak with us, and we will hearken,<br>	but let not God speak with us, lest we die!16 	Moshe said to the people:<br>	Do not be afraid!<br>	For it is to test you that God has come,<br>	to have awe of him be upon you,<br>	so that you do not sin.17 	The people stood far off,<br>	while Moshe approached the fog where God was.18 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Say thus to the Children of Israel:<br>	You yourselves have seen<br>	that it was from the heavens that I spoke with you.19 	You are not to make beside me<br>	gods of silver, gods of gold you are not to make for yourselves!20 	An altar of earth you are to make for me;<br>	you are to sacrifice upon it<br>	your offerings-up, your <i>shalom</i>-offerings,<br>	your sheep and your oxen!<br>	At every place<br>	where I cause my name to be recalled<br>	I will come to you<br>	and bless you.21 	And if an altar of stones you make for me,<br>	you are not to build it smooth-hewn,<br>	for if you hold-high your iron-tool over it, you will have profaned it.22 	And you are not to ascend my altar by ascending-steps,<br>	that your nakedness not be laid-bare upon it.21:1 @ 	Now these are the regulations that you are to set before them:2 	When you acquire a Hebrew serf,<br>	for six years he is to serve,<br>	but in the seventh he is to go out at liberty, for nothing.3 	If he came by himself, he is to go out by himself;<br>	if he was the spouse of a wife, his wife is to go out with him.4 	If his lord gives him a wife, and she bore him sons or daughters,<br>	the wife and those she bore are to remain her lord’s, and he is to go out by himself.5 	But if the serf should say, yes, say:<br>	I love my lord, my wife and my children&mdash;I will not go out at liberty!,6 	his lord is to have him approach God’s-oracle,<br>	and he is to have him approach the door or the post;<br>	then his lord is to pierce his ear with a piercer,<br>	and he is to serve him forever.7 @ 	When a man sells his daughter as a handmaid,<br>	she is not to go out as serfs go out.8 	If she is displeasing in the eyes of her lord, who designated her for himself,<br>	he is to have her redeemed;<br>	to a foreign people he has not the power to sell her,<br>	since he has betrayed her.9 	But if it is for his son that he designates her,<br>	according to the just-rights of women he is to deal with her.10 	If another he takes for himself,<br>	[then] her board, her clothing, or her oil he is not to diminish.11 	If these three he does not do for her,<br>	she is to go out for nothing, with no silver.12 @ 	He that strikes a man, so that he dies,<br>	is to be put to death, yes, death.13 	Now should he not have lain in wait [for him], but should God have brought him opportunely into his hand,<br>	I will set aside for you a place where he may flee.14 	But when a man schemes against his neighbor, to kill him with cunning,<br>	from my [very] altar you are to take him away, to die!15 @ 	And he that strikes his father or his mother,<br>	is to be put to death, yes, death.16 @ 	And he that steals a man,<br>	whether he sells him or whether he is found in his hand,<br>	is to be put to death, yes, death.17 @ 	And he that insults his father or his mother,<br>	is to be put to death, yes, death.18 @ 	When men quarrel, and a man strikes his neighbor with a stone or with a fist, yet he does not die, but rather takes to his bed:19 	if he can rise and walk about outside upon his crutch,<br>	he that struck [him] is to go clear;<br>	only: he is to make good for his resting-time, and provide-that-he-be-healed, yes, healed.20 @ 	When a man strikes his serf or his handmaid with a rod, so that he dies under his hand,<br>	it is to be avenged, yes, avenged;21 	nonetheless, if for a day or two-days he endures,<br>	it is not to be avenged, for he is his own “silver.”22 @ 	When men scuffle and deal a blow to a pregnant woman, so that her children abort-forth, but [other] harm does not occur,<br>	he is to be fined, yes, fined, as the woman’s spouse imposes for him,<br>	but he is to give it [only] according to assessment.23 	But if harm should occur,<br>	then you are to give life in place of life—24 	eye in place of eye, tooth in place of tooth, hand in place of25 	hand, foot in place of foot,/burnt-scar in place of burnt-scar, wound in place of wound, bruise in place of bruise.26 @ 	When a man strikes the eye of his serf or the eye of his handmaid, and ruins it,<br>	he is to send him free at liberty [on account of] his eye;27 	if the tooth of his serf or the tooth of his handmaid he breaks off,<br>	he is to send him free at liberty [on account of] his tooth.28 @ 	When an ox gores a man or a woman, so that one dies,<br>	the ox is to be stoned, yes, stoned, and its flesh is not to be eaten,<br>	and the owner of the ox is to be clear.29 	But if the ox was a gorer from yesterday [and the] day-before, and it was so designated to its owner,<br>	and he did not guard it,<br>	and it causes the death of a man or of a woman,<br>	the ox is to be stoned, and its owner as well is to be put to death.30 	If a ransom is established for him,<br>	he is to give it as a redemption for his life, all that is imposed for him.31 	Whether it is a son it gores or a daughter it gores,<br>	according to this [same] judgment it is to be done to him.32 	If [it is] a serf the ox gores, or a handmaid,<br>	silver—thirty <i>shekels</i>—he is to give to his lord, and the ox is to be stoned.33 @ 	When a man opens up a pit, or when a man digs a pit, and does not cover it up, and an ox or a donkey falls into it,34 	the owner of the pit is to pay, the worth-in-silver he is to restore to its owner, and the dead-animal is to remain his.35 	When a man’s ox deals-a-blow to his neighbor’s ox, so that it dies,<br>	they are to sell the live ox and split its worth-in-silver, [and the] dead-animal they are also to split.36 	Yet if it was known that it was a goring ox from yesterday [and the] day-before, and its owner did not guard it,<br>	he is to pay, yes, pay, an ox in place of the ox, and the dead-animal is to remain his.37 @ 	When a man steals an ox or a lamb, and slaughters it or sells it,<br>	five cattle he is to pay in place of the ox, and four sheep in place of the lamb.22:1 	If in [the act of] digging through, the stealer is caught and is struck down, so that he dies,<br>	there is to be on his account no bloodguilt;2 	[but] if the sun rose upon him,<br>	bloodguilt there is on his account;<br>	he is to pay, yes, pay—if he has nothing, he is to be sold because of his stealing.3 	If what was stolen is found, yes, found in his hand, whether ox, or donkey, or lamb, alive,<br>	twofold he is to pay.4 @ 	When a man has a field or a vineyard grazed in,<br>	and sends his grazing-flock free, so that it grazes in another’s field,<br>	the best-part of his field, the best-part of his vineyard he is to pay.5 @ 	When fire breaks out and reaches thorn-hedges, and a sheaf-stack or the standing-grain or the [entire] field is consumed,<br>	he is to pay, yes, pay, he that caused the blaze to blaze up.6 @ 	When a man gives silver or goods to his fellow for safekeeping, and it is stolen from the man’s house:<br>	if the stealer is caught, he is to pay twofold;7 	if the stealer is not caught, the owner of the house is to come near God’s-oracle,<br>	[to inquire] if he did not stretch out his hand against his neighbor’s property.8 	Regarding every matter of transgression,<br>	regarding oxen, regarding donkeys, regarding sheep, regarding garments, regarding any kind of loss about which one can say: That is it!—<br>	before God’s-oracle is the matter of the two of them to come;<br>	whomever God’s-oracle declares guilty is to pay twofold to his neighbor.9 @	When a man gives his neighbor a donkey or an ox or a lamb, or any kind of beast, for safekeeping,<br>	and it dies, or is crippled or captured, no one seeing [it happen],10 	the oath of <sc>Yhwh</sc> is to be between the two of them,<br>	[to inquire] if he did not send out his hand against his neighbor’s property;<br>	the owner is to accept it, and he does not have to pay.11 	But if it was stolen, yes, stolen away from him,<br>	he is to pay it back to its owner.12 	If it was torn, torn-to-pieces,<br>	he is to bring it as evidence; what was torn, he does not have to pay back.13 	And when a man borrows it from his neighbor, and it is crippled or it dies:<br>	[if] its owner was not with it, he is to pay, yes, pay;14 	[if] its owner was with it, he does not have to pay.<br>	If it was hired, its hiring-price is [considered] received.15 @ 	Now when a man seduces a virgin who has not been spoken for and lies with her,<br>	[for] the marrying-price he is to marry her, as his wife.16 	If her father refuses, yes, refuses to give her to him,<br>	silver he is to weigh out, according to the marriage-price of virgins.17 @ 	A sorceress you are not to let live!18 @	Anyone who lies with a beast<br>	is to be put to death, yes, death!19 @ 	One who sacrifices to [other] gods is to be devoted-to-destruction.<br>	Only to <sc>Yhwh</sc> alone!20 @ 	Now a sojourner you are not to maltreat, you are not to oppress him,<br>	for sojourners were you in the land of Egypt.21 @ 	Any widow or orphan you are not to afflict.22 	Oh, if you afflict, afflict them . . . !<br>	For [then] they will cry, cry out to me,<br>	and I will hearken, hearken to their cry,23 	my anger will flare up<br>	and I will kill you with the sword,<br>	so that your wives become widows, and your children, orphans!24 @ 	If you lend money to my people, to the afflicted one [who lives]

Aharon, Nadav and Avihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel,<br>	and bow down from afar;2 	Moshe alone is to approach <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	but they, they are not to approach,<br>	and as for the people—they [too] are not to go up with him.3 @ 	So Moshe came<br>	and recounted to the people all the words of <sc>Yhwh</sc> and all the regulations.<br>	And all the people answered in one voice, and said:<br>	All the words that <sc>Yhwh</sc> has spoken, we will do.4 	Now Moshe wrote down all the words of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.<br>	He started-early in the morning<br>	and built an altar beneath the mountain<br>	and twelve standing-stones for the twelve tribes of Israel.5 	Then he sent the [serving-]lads of the Children of Israel,<br>	that they should offer-up offerings-up and sacrifice <i>shalom<i>-offerings for <sc>Yhwh</sc>—bulls.6 	Moshe took half of the blood and put it in craters,<br>	and half of the blood he tossed against the altar.7 	Then he took the record of the covenant<br>	and read it in the hearing of the people.<br>	They said:<br>	All that <sc>Yhwh</sc> has spoken, we will do and we will hearken!8 	Moshe took the blood, he tossed it on the people<br>	and said:<br>	Here is the blood of the covenant<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> has cut with you<br>	by means of all these words.9 @ 	Then went up<br>	Moshe and Aharon, Nadav and Avihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel;10 	and they saw<br>	the God of Israel: now beneath his feet,<br>	[something] like work of sapphire tiles,<br>	[something] like the substance of the heavens in purity.11 	Yet against the Pillars of the Children of Israel, he did not send forth his hand;<br>	they beheld Godhood<br>	and ate and drank.12 @ 	Now <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Go up to me on the mountain<br>	and remain there,<br>	that I may give you tablets of stone:<br>	the Instruction and the Command<br>	that I have written down, to instruct them.13 	Moshe arose, and Yehoshua his attendant,<br>	and Moshe went up to the mountain of God.14 	Now to the elders he said:<br>	Stay here for us, until we return to you;<br>	here, Aharon and Hur are with you—<br>	whoever has a legal-matter is to approach them.15 	So Moshe went up the mountain,<br>	and the cloud covered the mountain;16 	the Glory of <sc>Yhwh</sc> took up dwelling on Mount Sinai.<br>	The cloud covered it for six days,<br>	and he called to Moshe on the seventh day from amidst the cloud.17 	And the sight of the Glory of <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	was like a consuming fire<br>	on top of the mountain<br>	in the eyes of the Children of Israel.18 	Moshe came into the midst of the cloud<br>	and he went up the mountain.<br>	And Moshe was on the mountain<br>	for forty days and forty nights.25:1 @ 	Now <sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:2 	Speak to

faces, each-one toward the other;<br>	toward the purgation-cover are the sphinxes’ faces to be.21 	You are to put the purgation-cover on the Coffer, above it,<br>	and in the Coffer you are to put<br>	the Testimony that I give you.22 	I will appoint-meeting with you there<br>	and I will speak with you<br>	from above the purgation-cover,<br>	from between the sphinxes that are on the Coffer of Testimony—<br>	all that I command you<br>	concerning the Children of Israel.23 @ 	You are to make a table of acacia wood,<br>	two cubits its length,<br>	a cubit its width,<br>	and a cubit and a

knobs and its blossoms are to be from itself.32 	Six stems issue from its sides,<br>	three lamp-stems from the one side,<br>	and three lamp-stems from the second side:33 	three almond-shaped goblets on the one stem, with knobs and blossoms,<br>	and three almond-shaped goblets on the other stem, with knobs and blossoms—<br>	thus for the six stems that issue from the lampstand;34 	and on the lampstand [proper] four almond-shaped goblets, with their knobs and their blossoms,35 	a knob beneath two stems, from itself,<br>	a knob beneath two stems, from itself,<br>	and a knob beneath two

to tie the Breastpiece from its rings to the rings of the <i>efod</i><br>	with a thread of blue-violet,<br>	to be [fixed] on the designed-band of the <i>efod,</i><br>	so that the Breastpiece not slip from the <i>efod</i>.29 	So Aharon is to bear<br>	the names of the Children of Israel<br>	on the Breastpiece of Judgment<br>	over his heart,<br>	whenever he comes into the Holy-Shrine<br>	for reminder, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	regularly.30 	And you are to put<br>	in the Breastpiece of Judgment<br>	the <i>Urim</i> and the <i>Tummim,</i><br>	that they may be over Aharon’s heart,<br>	whenever he comes before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.<br>	So Aharon is to bear<br>	the Breastpiece of Judgment for the Children of Israel<br>	over his heart<br>	before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	regularly.31 @ 	You are to make the robe for the <i>efod</i><br>	completely of blue-violet.32 	Its head-opening is to be in its middle;<br>	there shall be a seam for its opening, all around, of weaver’s making,<br>	like the opening for armor is it to be for him; it is not to be split.33 	You are to make on its skirts<br>	pomegranates of blue-violet, purple, and worm scarlet,<br>	on its skirts, all around,<br>	and bells of gold amidst them, all around:34 	bell of gold and pomegranate,<br>	bell of gold and pomegranate,<br>	on the skirts of the robe, all around.35 	It is to be [put] on Aharon, for attending,<br>	that its sound may be heard<br>	whenever he comes into the Holy-Shrine before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, and whenever he goes out,<br>	so that he does not die.36 @ 	You are to make a plate of pure gold<br>	and are to engrave on it signet engravings:<br>	<i>Holiness for <sc>Yhwh</sc><i/>.37 	You are to place it on a thread of blue-violet,<br>	that it may be on the turban;<br>	on the forefront of the turban is it to be.38 	It is to be on Aharon’s brow.<br>	So Aharon is to bear<br>	the iniquity of the holy-offerings that the Children of Israel offer-as-holy,<br>	all their gifts of holiness;<br>	it is to be on his brow<br>	regularly,<br>	for [receiving] favor for them, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.39 @ 	You are to braid the tunic with byssus;<br>	you are to make a turban of byssus,<br>	and a sash you are to make, of embroiderer’s making.40 	And for the sons of Aharon, you are to make tunics;<br>	you are to make them sashes<br>	and caps you are to make for them,<br>	for glory and for splendor.41 	You are to clothe in them Aharon your brother, and his sons with him,<br>	you are to anoint them,<br>	you are to give-mandate to them,<br>	and you are to hallow them,<br>	that they may be-priests for me.42 	You are to make them breeches of linen<br>	to cover the flesh of nakedness;<br>	from the hips to the thighs are they to extend.43 	They are to be on Aharon and on his sons,<br>	whenever they come into the Tent of Appointment<br>	or whenever they approach the altar<br>	to attend at the Holy-Shrine,<br>	that they do not bear iniquity and die<br>	—a law for the ages, for him and for his seed after him.29:1 @ 	Now this is the ceremony<br>	that you are to make for them<br>	to hallow them, to be-priests for me:<br>	Take a bull, a young one of the herd, and rams, two, wholly-sound,2 	and bread of <i>matza</i> and flat cakes of <i>matza</i>, mixed with oil, and wafers of <i>matza,</i> dipped in oil;<br>	of wheat flour are you to make them.3 	You are to put them in one basket<br>	and are to bring them near in the basket,<br>	along with the bull and along with the two rams.4 	And Aharon and his two sons<br>	you are to bring near to the entrance of the Tent of Appointment<br>	and are to wash them with water.5 	Then you are to take the garments<br>	and are to clothe Aharon<br>	in the tunic, in the robe of the <i>efod,</i> in the <i>efod</i> and in the Breastpiece;<br>	you are to invest him in the designed-band of the <i>efod,</i>6 	you are to place the turban on his head,<br>	and are to put the sacred-diadem of holiness on the turban.7 	You are to take the oil for anointing<br>	and are to pour it on his head, and anoint him.8 	And his sons, you are to bring near<br>	and are to clothe them in coats;9 	you are to gird them with a sash, Aharon and his sons,<br>	and are to wind caps for them.<br>	It shall be for them as priestly-right,<br>	a law for the ages.<br>	So you are to give-mandate to Aharon and to his sons:10 	you are to bring near the bull, before the Tent of Appointment,<br>	and Aharon and his sons are to lean their hands on the head of the bull.11 	You are to slaughter the bull in the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	at the entrance of the Tent of Appointment,12 	and are to take some of the blood of the bull<br>	and are to put it on the horns of the altar with your finger,<br>	but all the [rest of the] blood, you are to pour out on the foundation of the altar.13 	You are to take all the fat that covers the innards,<br>	with the extension on the liver, the two kidneys and the fat that is on them,<br>	and turn-them-into-smoke upon the altar.14 	And the flesh of the bull, its skin and its dung,<br>	you are to burn with fire, outside the camp;<br>	it is a <i>hattat</i>/decontamination-offering.15 	And the first ram, you are to take,<br>	and Aharon and his sons are to lean their hands on the head of the ram.16 	You are to slaughter the ram,<br>	you are to take its blood<br>	and you are to toss it on the altar, all around.17 	And the ram you are to section into sections;<br>	you are to wash its innards and its legs<br>	and you are to put [them] on its sections and on its head18 	and are to turn-into-smoke the entire ram, upon the altar;<br>	it is an offering-up for <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	a soothing savor,<br>	it is a fire-offering for <sc>Yhwh</sc>.19 	And you are to take the second ram<br>	and Aharon and his sons are to lean their hands on the head of the ram.20 	You are to slaughter the ram,<br>	you are to take [some] of its blood<br>	and you are to put [it]<br>	on the ridge of Aharon’s ear and on the ridge of the right ear of Aharon’s sons,<br>	and on the thumb of their right hands and on the thumb-toe of their right feet,<br>	then you are to toss the blood on the altar, all around.21 	You are to take some of the blood that is on the altar, and some of the oil for anointing,<br>	and you are to sprinkle it on Aharon and on his garments, on his sons and on his sons’ garments with him,<br>	that he and his garments may be hallowed, and his sons and his sons’ garments with him.22 	You are to take the fat from the ram,<br>	the tail, the fat that covers the innards and the extension on the liver, the two kidneys and the fat that is on them,<br>	and the right thigh,<br>	for it is the ram for giving-mandate;23 	and one loaf of bread and one cake of oil-bread and one wafer from the basket of <i>matza</i> that is in the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>;24 	you are to place them all<br>	on the palms of Aharon and on the palms of his sons,<br>	and you are to elevate them as an elevation-offering, in the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.25 	You are to take them from their hand<br>	and you are to turn-them-into-smoke upon the altar, beside the offering-up,<br>	as a soothing savor in the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	it is a fire-offering for <sc>Yhwh</sc>.26 	You are to take the breast from the ram of giving-mandate that is Aharon’s,<br>	and you are to elevate it as an elevation-offering, in the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	that it may be an allotment for you.27 	So you are to hallow the breast for the elevation-offering, and the thigh of the raised-contribution,<br>	that is elevated, that is raised<br>	from the ram of giving-mandate,<br>	from what is Aharon’s and from what is his sons’.28 	It is to be Aharon’s and his sons’,<br>	a fixed-allocation for the ages, on the part of the Children of Israel,<br>	for it is a contribution,<br>	and a contribution is it to be on the part of the Children of Israel,<br>	from their sacrifices of <i>shalom,</i><br>	their raised-contribution for <sc>Yhwh</sc>.29 	Now the garments of holiness that are Aharon’s<br>	are to belong to his sons after him,<br>	to anoint them in them and to give-them-mandate in them.30 	For seven days is the one of his sons that acts-as-priest in his stead to be clothed in them,<br>	the one who comes into the Tent of Appointment to attend at the Holy-Shrine.31 	And the ram for giving-mandate you are to take<br>	and are to boil its flesh in the Holy-Shrine.32 	Aharon and his sons are to eat the flesh of the ram, along with the bread that is in the basket,<br>	at the entrance of the Tent of Appointment.33 	They are to eat them—those who are purged by them,<br>	to give-them-mandate, to hallow them;<br>	an outsider is not to eat [them], for they are holiness.34 	Now if there be anything left over of the flesh of giving-mandate or of the bread in the morning,<br>	you are to burn what is left by fire,<br>	it is not to be eaten, for it is holiness.35 	You are to make [thus] for Aharon and for his sons,<br>	exactly as I have commanded you;<br>	for seven days, you are to give-them-mandate.36 	A bull for the <i>hattat</i>-offering, you are to make-ready for each day, concerning the purging,<br>	that you may decontaminate the altar, by your purging it,<br>	and you are to anoint it, to hallow it.37 	For seven days you are to purge the altar, that you may hallow it.<br>	Thus the altar will become<br>	holiest holiness;<br>	whatever touches the altar shall become-holy.38 @ 	And this is what you are to make [as sacrifice] on the altar:<br>	year-old lambs, two for each day, regularly.39 	The first lamb you are to make [as sacrifice] at daybreak,<br>	and the second lamb you are to make between the setting-times.40 	A tenth-measure of fine-meal, mixed with beaten oil, a quarter of a <i>hin,</i><br>	and [as] poured-offering, a quarter of a <i>hin</i> of wine—for the first lamb.41 	And the second lamb you are to make [as sacrifice] between the setting-times,<br>	like the grain-gift of morning, and like its poured-offering, [that] you make for it,<br>	as a soothing savor,<br>	a fire-offering for <sc>Yhwh</sc>;42 	a regular offering-up, throughout your generations,<br>	at the entrance to the Tent of Appointment, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>;<br>	for I will appoint-meeting with you there,<br>	to speak to you there.43 	So I will appoint-meeting there<br>	with the Children of Israel,<br>	and it will be hallowed<br>	by my Glory.44 	I will hallow the Tent of Appointment and the altar,<br>	and Aharon and his sons I will hallow,<br>	to be-priests for me.45 	And I will dwell amidst the Children of Israel<br>	and I will be a God for them,46 	that they may know<br>	that I am <sc>Yhwh</sc> their God<br>	who brought them out of the land of Egypt<br>	to dwell, myself, in their midst,<br>	I am <sc>Yhwh</sc> their God.30:1 @ 	You are to make an altar, a smoking one for smoking-incense,<br>	of acacia wood are you to make it,2 	a cubit its length and a cubit its width;<br>	square is it to be, and two cubits its height,<br>	its horns from itself.3 	You are to overlay it with pure gold—<br>	its roof, its walls all around, and its horns,<br>	and you are to make a rim of gold all around.4 	And two rings of gold you are to make for it, beneath its rim,<br>	on its two flanks, you are to make [them] on its two sides,<br>	that they may be for holders for poles, to carry it by [means of] them.5 	You are to make the poles of acacia wood<br>	and you are to overlay them with gold.6 	And you are to put it in front of the curtain that is over the Coffer of the Testimony,<br>	in front of the purgation-cover that is over the Testimony,<br>	where I will appoint-meeting with you.7 	And Aharon is to send-up-in-smoke, fragrant smoking-incense on it,<br>	in the morning, [every] morning;<br>	when he polishes the lamps, he is to send-it-up-in-smoke.8 	And when Aharon draws up the lampwicks,<br>	between the setting-times,<br>	he is to send-it-up-in-smoke,<br>	a regular smoke-offering before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, throughout your generations.9 	You are not to offer-up on it any outsider’s smoking-incense,<br>	either as offering-up or as grain-gift,<br>	nor are you to pour out any poured-offering upon it.10 	Aharon is to do-the-purging upon its horns,<br>	once a year,<br>	with the decontaminating blood of purgation;<br>	once a year<br>	he is to do-the-purging on it,<br>	throughout your generations&mdash;<br>	holiest holiness it is for <sc>Yhwh</sc>.11 	Now <sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:12 	When you take up the head-count of the Children of Israel, in counting them,<br>	they are to give, each-man, a ransom for his life, for <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	when they count them,<br>	that there be no plague on them, when they count them.13 	This [is what] they are to give, everyone who goes through the counting:<br>	half a <i>shekel</i> of the Holy-Shrine <i>shekel</i>—twenty grains to the <i>shekel</i>—<br>	half a <i>shekel, </i>a contribution for <sc>Yhwh</sc>.14 	Everyone who goes through the counting, from the age of twenty years and upward,<br>	is to give the contribution of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.15 	The rich are not to pay-more and the poor are not to pay-less than half a <i>shekel</i><br>	when giving the contribution of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	to effect-ransom for your lives.16 	You are to take the silver for ransoming<br>	from the Children of Israel<br>	and are to give it over for the construction-service of the Tent of Appointment,<br>	that it may be for the Children of Israel<br>	as a reminder before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	to effect-ransom for your lives.17 @ 	Now <sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:18 	You are to make a basin of bronze,<br>	its pedestal of bronze,<br>	for washing,<br>	and you are to put it between the Tent of Appointment and the altar;<br>	you are to put water therein,19 	that Aharon and his sons may wash with it<br>	their hands and their feet.20 	When they come into the Tent of Appointment<br>	they are to wash with water<br>	so that they do not die,<br>	or when they approach the altar, to be-in-attendance,<br>	to send up fire-offerings in smoke for <sc>Yhwh</sc>,21 	they are to wash their hands and their feet,<br>	so that they do not die.<br>	It is to be for them a law for the ages,<br>	for him and for his sons, throughout their generations.22 @ 	Now <sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:23 	And as for you, take you fragrant-spices, essence,<br>	streaming myrrh, five hundred,<br>	cinnamon spice, half as much—fifty and two hundred,<br>	fragrant cane, fifty and two hundred,24 	and cassia, five hundred<br>	by the Holy-Shrine <i>shekel</i>,<br>	as well as olive oil, a <i>hin,</i>25 	and you are to make [from] it anointing oil of holiness,<br>	perfume from the perfume-mixture, of perfumer’s making;<br>	anointing oil of holiness is it to be.26 	You are to anoint with it<br>	the Tent of Appointment<br>	and the Coffer of the Testimony27 	and the table and all its implements,<br>	and the lampstand and all its implements<br>	and the altar for smoke-offerings28 	and the altar for offering-up and all its implements<br>	and the basin and its pedestal.29 	You are to hallow them<br>	that they may become holiest holiness&mdash;<br>	whatever touches them shall become-holy.30 	And Aharon and his sons you are to anoint,<br>	you are to hallow them to be-priests for me.31 	And to the Children of Israel you are to speak, saying:<br>	Anointing oil of holiness<br>	this is to be for me<br>	throughout your generations.32 	On any [other] human body it is not to be poured out;<br>	in its [exact] proportion, you are not to make any like it—<br>	holiness is it,<br>	holiness it shall remain for you.33 	Any man who mixes-perfumes like it<br>	or who puts any of it on an outsider<br>	is to be cut off from his kinspeople!34 @ 	Now <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Take you fragrant-spices,<br>	drop-gum, onycha, and galbanum,<br>	[these] fragrances and clear incense;<br>	part equaling part are they to be.35 	You are to make [with] it smoking-incense,<br>	perfume, of perfumer’s making,<br>	salted, pure—holy.36 	You are to beat some of it into fine-powder<br>	and are to put some of it<br>	in front of the Testimony<br>	in the Tent of Appointment,<br>	where I will appoint-meeting with you&mdash;<br>	holiest holiness it is to be for you.37 	As for the smoking-incense that you make,<br>	you are not to make any for yourselves in its [exact] proportion&mdash;<br>	holiness shall it be for you, for <sc>Yhwh</sc>.38 	Any man that makes any like it<br>	to savor it<br>	is to be cut off from his kinspeople!31:1 @ 	Now <sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:2 	See,<br>	I have called by name<br>	Betzalel son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Yehuda.3 	I have filled him with the spirit of God<br>	in practical-wisdom, discernment and knowledge<br>	in all kinds of workmanship,4 	to design designs,<br>	to make them in gold, in silver and in bronze,5 	in the cutting of stones for setting and in the cutting of wood,<br>	to make them through all kinds of workmanship.6 	And I, here I give [to be] with him<br>	Oholiav son of Ahisamakh, of the tribe of Dan;<br>	in the mind of all those wise of mind I place wisdom,<br>	that they may make all that I have commanded you:7 	the Tent of Appointment<br>	and the Coffer of the Testimony<br>	and the purgation-cover that is over it<br>	and all the implements of the Tent8 	and the table and all its implements<br>	and the pure lampstand and all its implements<br>	and the altar for smoke-offering9 	and the altar for offering-up and all its implements<br>	and the basin and its pedestal,10 	and the officiating garments<br>	and the garments of holiness for Aharon the priest and the garments of his sons for being-priests11 	and oil for anointing<br>	and fragrant smoke for the holy-offerings—<br>	exactly as I have commanded you, they are to make.12 @ 	Now <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:13 	And you, speak to the Children of Israel, saying:<br>	However: my Sabbaths you are to keep!<br>	For it is a sign<br>	between me and you, throughout your generations,<br>	to know that I, <sc>Yhwh</sc>, hallow you.14 	You are to keep the Sabbath,<br>	for it is holiness for you,<br>	whoever profanes it is to be put to death, yes, death!<br>	For whoever makes work on it—<br>	that person is to be cut off from among his kinspeople.15 	For six days is work to be made,<br>	but on the seventh day<br>	[is] Sabbath, Sabbath-Ceasing, holiness for <sc>Yhwh</sc>;<br>	whoever makes work on the Sabbath day is to be put to death, yes, death!16 	The Children of Israel are to keep the Sabbath,<br>	to make the Sabbath-observance throughout their generations<br>	as a covenant for the ages.17 	Between me and the Children of Israel<br>	it is a sign for the ages,<br>	for in six days<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> made the heavens and the earth,<br>	but on the seventh day<br>	he ceased and paused-for-breath.18 @ 	He gave to Moshe<br>	when he had finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai<br>	the two tablets of the Testimony,<br>	tablets of stone,<br>	written by the finger of God.32:1 @ 	Now the people saw that Moshe was shamefully-late in coming down from the mountain,<br>	so the people assembled against Aharon<br>	and said to him:<br>	Arise, make us a god who will go before us,<br>	for this Moshe, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt,<br>	we do not know what has become of him!2 	Aharon said to them:<br>	Break off the gold rings that are in the ears of your wives, your sons and your daughters,<br>	and bring [them] to me!3 	All the people broke off the gold rings that were in their ears,<br>	and brought [them] to Aharon.4 	He took from their hand,<br>	fashioned it with a graving-tool,<br>	and made it into a molten calf.<br>	Then they said:<br>	This is your God, O Israel,<br>	who brought you up from the land of Egypt!5 	[When] Aharon saw [this], he built an altar before it,<br>	and Aharon called out and said:<br>	Tomorrow is a festival to <sc>Yhwh</sc>!6 	They started-early on the morrow,<br>	offered offerings-up<br>	and brought <i>shalom</i>-offerings;<br>	the people sat down to eat and drink<br>	and proceeded to revel.7 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Go, get down!<br>	for your people<br>	whom you brought up from the land of Egypt<br>	has wrought ruin!8 	They have been quick to turn aside from the way that I commanded them:<br>	they have made themselves a molten calf,<br>	they have bowed to it, they have sacrificed to it,<br>	and they have said: This is your God, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt!9 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	I see this people—<br>	and here, it is a hard necked people!10 	So now,<br>	let me be, that my anger may flare up against them<br>	and I may destroy them—<br>	but you I will make into a great nation!11 	Moshe soothed the face of <sc>Yhwh</sc> his God;<br>	he said:<br>	Why,<br>	O <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	should your anger flare up against your people<br>	whom you brought out of the land of Egypt<br>	with great power,<br>	with a strong hand?12 	Why<br>	should the Egyptians [be able to] say, yes, say:<br>	With evil intent he brought them out,<br>	to kill them in the mountains,<br>	to destroy them from the face of the earth?<br>	Turn away from your flaming anger,<br>	repent of the evil [intended] against your people!13 	Recall Avraham, Yitzhak and Yisrael your servants,<br>	to whom you swore by yourself<br>	when you spoke to them:<br>	I will make your seed many<br>	as the stars of the heavens,<br>	and all this land which I have promised,<br>	I will give to your seed,<br>	that they may inherit [it] for the ages!14 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> repented of the evil<br>	that he had spoken of doing to his people.15 @ 	Moshe faced about to come down from the mountain,<br>	the two tablets of the Testimony in his hand,<br>	tablets written on both their sides:<br>	on this one and on this one they were written;16 	and the tablets were God’s making,<br>	and the writing was God’s writing,<br>	engraved upon the tablets.17 	Yehoshua heard the sound of the people as it shouted, so he said to Moshe:<br>	The sound of battle is in the camp!18 	But he said:<br>		Not the sound of the song of prevailing,<br>		not the sound of the song of failing,<br>		sound of choral-song is what I hear!19 	And it was,<br>	when he neared the camp<br>	and saw the calf and the dancing,<br>	that Moshe’s anger flared up;<br>	he threw the tablets from his hands<br>	and smashed them beneath the mountain.20 	He took the calf that they had made<br>	and burned it with fire<br>	and ground it up until it was thin-powder,<br>	and strewed it on the surface of the water<br>	and made the Children of Israel drink it.21 	Then Moshe said to Aharon:<br>	What did this people do to you<br>	that you have brought upon it [such] a great sin!22 	Aharon said:<br>	Let not my lord’s anger flare up!<br>	You yourself know this people, how set-on-evil it is.23 	They said to me: Make us a god who will go before us,<br>	for this Moshe, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt,<br>	we do not know what has become of him!24 	So I said to them: Who has gold?<br>	They broke it off and gave it to me;<br>	I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf.25 	Moshe saw the people: that it had gotten loose,<br>	for Aharon had let it loose for whispering among their foes,26 	so Moshe took-up-a-stand at the gate of the camp<br>	and said:<br>	Whoever is for <sc>Yhwh</sc>—to me!<br>	And there gathered to him all the Sons of Levi.27 	He said to them:<br>	Thus says <sc>Yhwh</sc>, the God of Israel:<br>	Put everyone his sword on his thigh,<br>	proceed and go back-and-forth from gate to gate in the camp,<br>	and kill<br>	everyone his brother, everyone his neighbor, everyone his relative!28 	The Sons of Levi did according to Moshe’s words.<br>	And there fell of the people on that day some three thousand men.29 	Moshe said:<br>	Be-mandated to <sc>Yhwh</sc> today,<br>	even though it be every-man at the cost of his son, at the cost of his brother,<br>	to bestow blessing upon you today!30 @ 	It was on the morrow<br>	that Moshe said to the people:<br>	You, you have sinned a great sin!<br>	So now, I will go up to <sc>Yhwh</sc>;<br>	perhaps I may be able to purge away your sin.31 	Moshe returned to <sc>Yhwh</sc> and said:<br>	Ah now,<br>	this people has sinned a great sin,<br>	they have made themselves gods of gold!32 	So now,<br>	if you would [only] bear away their sin—!<br>	But if not,<br>	pray blot me out of the record that you have written!33 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Whoever sins against me,<br>	I blot him [alone] out of my record.34 	So now,<br>	go,<br>	lead the people to where I have spoken to you.<br>	Here, my messenger will go before you,<br>	but on the day of my calling-to-account,<br>	I will call-them-to-account for their sin!35 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> plagued the people<br>	because they made the calf that Aharon made.33:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Go, up from here,<br>	you and the people that you brought up from the land of Egypt,<br>	to the land of which I swore to Avraham, to Yitzhak and to Yaakov, saying:<br>	I will give it to your seed.2 	I will send a messenger before you<br>	and will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite and the Hittite and the Perizzite, the Hivvite and the Yevusite—,3 	to a land flowing with milk and honey.<br>	But: I will not go up in your midst,<br>	for a hard necked people are you,<br>	lest I destroy you on the way!4 	[When] the people heard this evil word<br>	they mourned,<br>	and no man put on his ornaments [again].5 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Say to the Children of Israel:<br>	You are a hard necked people—<br>	if for one moment I were to go up in your midst,<br>	I would destroy you!<br>	So now, take down your ornaments from yourselves,<br>	that I may know what I am to do with you.6 	So the Children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from Mount Sinai on.7 @ 	Now Moshe would take the Tent<br>	and pitch it for himself outside the camp, going-far from the camp.<br>	He called it the Tent of Appointment.<br>	And it was,<br>	whoever besought <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	would go out to the Tent of Appointment that was outside the camp.8 	And it was:<br>	whenever Moshe would go out to the Tent,<br>	all the people would rise;<br>	they would station themselves, each at the entrance to his tent,<br>	and would gaze after Moshe<br>	until he had come into the Tent.9 	And it was:<br>	whenever Moshe would come into the Tent,<br>	the column of cloud would come down<br>	and stop at the entrance to the Tent,<br>	and he would speak with Moshe.10 	And all the people would see<br>	the column of cloud<br>	standing at the entrance to the Tent,<br>	and all the people would rise;<br>	they would bow down,<br>	each at the entrance to his tent.11 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> would speak to Moshe<br>	face to face,<br>	as one speaks to his neighbor.<br>	Now when he would return to the camp,<br>	his attendant, the lad Yehoshua,<br>	would not depart from within the Tent.12 @ 	Moshe said to <sc>Yhwh</sc>:<br>	See,<br>	you,<br>	you say to me:<br>	Bring this people up!<br>	But you,<br>	you have not let us know<br>	whom you will send with me!<br>	And you,<br>	you said:<br>	I have known you by name,<br>	and you have found favor in my eyes!13 	So now—<br>	if I have, pray, found favor in your eyes,<br>	pray let me know your ways,<br>	that I may [truly] know you,<br>	in order that I may find favor in your eyes:<br>	see,<br>	indeed, this nation is your people!14 	He said:<br>	If my presence were to go [with you], would I cause you to rest-easy?15 	He said to him:<br>	If your presence does not go,<br>	do not bring us up from here!16 	For wherein, after all, is it to be known<br>	that I have found favor in your eyes,<br>	I and your people?<br>	Is it not [precisely] in that you go with us,<br>	and that we are distinct,<br>	I and your people,<br>	from every people that is on the face of the earth?17 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Also this word that you have spoken, I will do,<br>	for you have found favor in my eyes,<br>	and I have known you by name.18 	Then he said:<br>	Pray let me see your Glory!19 	He said:<br>	I myself will cause all my Goodliness to pass<br>	in front of your face,<br>	and I will call out the name of <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	before your face:<br>	that I show-favor to whom I show-favor,<br>	that I show-mercy to whom I show-mercy.20 	But he said:<br>	You cannot see my face,<br>	for no human can see me and live!21 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said:<br>	Here is a place<br>	next to me;<br>	station yourself on the rock,22 	and it shall be:<br>	when my Glory passes by,<br>	I will place you in the cleft of the rock<br>	and screen you with my hand<br>	until I have passed by.23 	Then I will remove my hand;<br>	you shall see my back,<br>	but my face shall not be seen.34:1 	Then <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Carve yourself two tablets of stone<br>	like the first ones,<br>	and I will write on the tablets the words<br>	that were on the first tablets<br>	which you smashed.2 	And be ready by the morning:<br>	go up in the morning to Mount Sinai,<br>	and station yourself for me there, on top of the mountain.3 	No man is to go up with you,<br>	neither is any man to be seen on all the mountain,<br>	neither are sheep or oxen to graze in front of this mountain.4 	So he carved two tablets of stone like the first ones.<br>	Moshe started-early in the morning<br>	and went up to Mount Sinai,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded him,<br>	and he took in his hand the two tablets of stone.5 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> came down in the cloud;<br>	he stationed himself beside him there<br>	and called out the name of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.6 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> passed before his face<br>	and called out:<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	God,<br>	showing-mercy, showing-favor,<br>	long-suffering in anger,<br>	abundant in loyalty and faithfulness,7 	keeping loyalty to the thousandth [generation],<br>	bearing iniquity, rebellion and sin,<br>	yet not clearing, clearing [the guilty],<br>	calling-to-account the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons and upon sons’ sons, to the third and fourth [generation]!8 	Hastily Moshe did homage on the ground, and bowed low,9 	and said:<br>	Pray if I have found favor in your eyes,<br>	O my Lord,<br>	pray let my Lord go among us!<br>	Indeed, it is a hard necked people—<br>	so forgive our iniquity and our sin,<br>	and make-us-your-inheritance!10 	He said:<br>	Here,<br>	I cut a covenant:<br>	before all your people I will do wonders<br>	such as have not been created<br>	in all the earth, among all the nations.<br>	Then shall all the people among whom you are, see<br>	the work of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, how awe-inspiring it is,<br>	which I do with you.11 	Take care for yourself<br>	regarding what I command you today!<br>	Here, I am driving out before you<br>	the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivvite and the Yevusite,—12 	take you care,<br>	lest you cut a covenant<br>	with the settled-folk of the land against whom you are coming,<br>	lest they become a snare among you.13 	Rather:<br>	their altars you are to pull down,<br>	their standing-pillars you are to smash,<br>	their tree-poles you are to cut down.14 	For: You are not to bow down to any other god!<br>	For <sc>Yhwh</sc>—<br>	Zealous-One is his name,<br>	a zealous God is he!15 	—Lest you cut a covenant with the settled-folk of the land:<br>	[when] they go whoring after their gods<br>	and sacrifice to their gods,<br>	they will call to you to eat of their sacrifices;16 	should you take of their women [in marriage] for your sons,<br>	their women will go whoring after their gods,<br>	and they will cause your sons to go whoring after their gods.17 @ 	Molten gods you are not to make for yourselves!18 @ 	The Pilgrimage-Festival of <i>Matzot</i> you are to keep;<br>	for seven days you are to eat <i>matzot,</i> as I commanded you,<br>	at the appointed-time, in the month of Ripe-Grain,<br>	for in the month of Ripe-Grain you went out of Egypt.19 	Every breacher of a womb is mine,<br>	and every one that your herd drops-as-male, breacher among oxen and sheep;20 	the breacher among donkeys you are to redeem with a sheep,<br>	and if you do not redeem it, you are to break-its-neck.<br>	Every firstborn among your sons you are to redeem.<br>	No one is to be seen before my presence empty-handed.21 @ 	For six days you are to serve,<br>	but on the seventh day, you are to cease;<br>	at plowing, at grain-cutting, you are to cease.22 	The Pilgrimage-Festival of Weeks you are to make for yourselves,<br>	of the first-fruits of the wheat cutting,<br>	as well as the Pilgrimage-Festival of Ingathering<br>	at the turning of the year.23 	At three points in the year<br>	are all your male-folk to be seen<br>	before the presence of the Lord, <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	the God of Israel.24 	For I will dispossess nations before you, and widen your territory,<br>	so that no man will desire your land,<br>	when you go up to be seen before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	at three points in the year.25 @ 	You are not to slay my blood sacrifice with anything fermented.<br>		   @    You are not to leave-overnight, until morning, the pilgrimage sacrifice of Passover.26 @ 	The premier of the firstfruits of your soil you are to bring into the house of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God.<br>		   @    You are not to boil a kid in the milk of its mother.27 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Write you down these words,<br>	for in accordance with these words<br>	I cut with you a covenant, and with Israel.28 @ 	Now he was there beside <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	for forty days and forty nights;<br>	bread he did not eat<br>	and water he did not drink,<br>	but he wrote down on the tablets the words of the covenant,<br>	the Ten Words.29 @ 	Now it was<br>	when Moshe came down from Mount Sinai<br>	with the two tablets of Testimony in Moshe’s hand,<br>	when he came down from the mountain<br>	—now Moshe did not know that the skin of his face was radiating because of his having spoken with him,—30 	Aharon and all the Children of Israel saw Moshe:<br>	and here, the skin of his face was radiating!<br>	So they were afraid to approach him.31 	Moshe called to them,<br>	and then Aharon and all those exalted in the community came back to him,<br>	and Moshe spoke to them.32 	Afterward all the Children of Israel approached,<br>	and he commanded them<br>	all that <sc>Yhwh</sc> had spoken with him on Mount Sinai.33 	Now [when] Moshe had finished speaking with them,<br>	he put a veil upon his face.34 	And whenever Moshe would come before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, to speak with him,<br>	he would remove the veil, until he had gone out;<br>	and whenever he would come out and speak to the children of Israel that which he had been commanded,35 	the Children of Israel would see Moshe’s face,<br>	that the skin of Moshe’s face was radiating;<br>	but then Moshe would put back the veil on his face,<br>	until he came in to speak with him.35:1 @ 	Now Moshe assembled the entire community of the Children of Israel<br>	and said to them:<br>	These are the words that <sc>Yhwh</sc> has commanded, to do them:2 @ 	For six days is work to be made,<br>	but on the seventh day,<br>	there is to be holiness for you,<br>	Sabbath, Sabbath-Ceasing for <sc>Yhwh</sc>;<br>	whoever makes work on it is to be put to death!3 	You are not to let fire burn throughout all your settlements on the Sabbath day.4 @ 	Moshe spoke to the entire community of the Children of Israel,<br>	saying:<br>	This is the matter that <sc>Yhwh</sc> has commanded, saying:5 	Take, from yourselves, a raised-contribution for <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	whoever is of willing mind is to bring it,<br>	<sc>Yhwh’s</sc> contribution:<br>	gold, silver, and bronze,6 	blue-violet, purple, worm scarlet, byssus and goats’-hair,7 	rams’ skins dyed-red, tanned-leather skins,<br>	acacia wood,8 	oil for lighting,<br>	spices for oil of anointing and for fragrant smoking-incense,9 	onyx stones and stones for setting,<br>	for the <i>efod</i> and for the Breastpiece.10 	And everyone wise of mind among you<br>	is to come and is to make all that <sc>Yhwh</sc> has commanded:11 	the Dwelling, its tent and its cover,<br>	its clasps and its boards,<br>	its running bars, its columns and its sockets;12 	the Coffer and its poles,<br>	the purgation-cover and the curtain for the screen;13 	the table and its poles and all its implements,<br>	and the Bread of the Presence;14 	and the lampstand for lighting and its implements and its lamps,<br>	and the oil for lighting;15 	and the altar for smoke-offering and its poles, and the oil for anointing,<br>	and the fragrant smoking-incense;<br>	and the entrance screen for the entrance of the Dwelling;16 	the altar for offering-up and the bronze lattice that [belongs] to it, its poles and all its implements;<br>	the basin and its pedestal;17 	the hangings of the courtyard, its columns and its sockets, and the screen for the gate of the courtyard;18 	the pins of the Dwelling and the pins of the courtyard, and their cords,19 	the officiating garments for attending at the Holy-Shrine;<br>	the garments of holiness for Aharon the priest<br>	and the garments of his sons for acting-as-priest.20 @ 	So the entire community of the Children of Israel<br>	went out from Moshe’s presence,21 	and then they came, every man whose mind uplifted him,<br>	and everyone whose spirit made-him-willing brought <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> contribution<br>	for the skilled-work on the Tent of Appointment, for all its service [of construction], and for the garments of holiness.22 	Then came men and women alike, everyone of willing mind;<br>	they brought<br>	brooch and nose-ring and signet-ring and necklace, every kind of gold object,<br>	everyone who wished to elevate an elevation-offering of gold to <sc>Yhwh</sc>;23 	and everyone with whom could be found<br>	blue-violet, purple, worm scarlet, byssus and goats’-hair, rams’ skins dyed-red and tanned-leather skins,<br>	brought it.24 	Everyone raising a raised-contribution of silver and bronze<br>	brought <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> contribution,<br>	and everyone with whom could be found<br>	acacia wood for all the work of the service [of construction], brought it.25 	And every woman wise of mind,<br>	with their hands they spun<br>	and brought their spinning—<br>	the blue-violet, the purple, the worm scarlet and the byssus,26 	and every one of the women whose mind uplifted them in practical-wisdom<br>	spun the goats’-hair.27 	And the exalted-ones brought<br>	the onyx stones and the stones for setting,<br>	for the <i>efod</i> and for the Breastpiece,28 	and the fragrant-spice and the oil<br>	for lighting, for oil of anointing, for fragrant smoking-incense.29 	Every man and woman<br>	whose mind made-them-willing to bring [anything] for all the workmanship<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded to make through Moshe, the Children of Israel brought it,<br>	as a freewill-offering for <sc>Yhwh</sc>.30 @ 	Moshe said to the Children of Israel:<br>	See,<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> has called by name<br>	Betzalel son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Yehuda;31 	he has filled him with the spirit of God<br>	in practical-wisdom, in discernment and in knowledge,<br>	and in all kinds of workmanship32 	to design designs,<br>	to make [them] in gold, in silver and in bronze,33 	in the carving of stones for setting and in the carving of wood,<br>	to make all kinds of designed workmanship,34 	and [the ability] to instruct he has put in his mind,<br>	he and Oholiav son of Ahisamakh, of the tribe of Dan;35 	he has filled them with wisdom of mind<br>	to make all kinds of workmanship<br>	of the jewel-cutter, the designer and the embroiderer,<br>	in blue-violet, in purple, in worm scarlet and in byssus,<br>	and of the weaver—<br>	makers of all kinds of workmanship<br>	and designers of designs.36:1 	So are Betzalel and Oholiav to make,<br>	and every man wise of mind<br>	in whom <sc>Yhwh</sc> has put wisdom and discernment,<br>	to know [how] to make all the work for the service of [constructing] the Holy-Shrine<br>	for all that <sc>Yhwh</sc> has commanded.2 	So Moshe called<br>	for Betzalel, for Oholiav,<br>	and for all men wise of mind into whose mind <sc>Yhwh</sc> had put wisdom,<br>	all those whose mind uplifted them to come-near for the work,<br>	to make it.3 	And they took from Moshe all the contributions<br>	that the Children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of [constructing] the Holy-Shrine,<br>	to make it.<br>	Now they brought him further, freewill-offerings in the morning, [every] morning;4 	and came, all the wise-ones who were making all the skilled-work for the Holy-Shrine,<br>	person after person, from their skilled-work that they were making,5 	and said to Moshe, saying:<br>	The people are bringing much more<br>	than enough for the service of [doing] the work<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> has commanded, to make it!6 	So Moshe commanded and they had a call go throughout the camp, saying:<br>	Man and woman—let them not make-ready any further work-material for the contribution of the Holy-Shrine!<br>	So the people were stopped from bringing;7 	the work-material was enough for them, for all the work, to make it, and more.8 @ 	Then made all those wise of mind among the makers of the work,<br>	the dwelling, of ten tapestries<br>	of twisted byssus, blue-violet, purple and worm scarlet;<br>	with winged-sphinxes, of designer’s making, was it made.9 	The length of each one tapestry, twenty-eight by the cubit,<br>	and the width—four by the cubit,<br>	of each one tapestry,<br>	one measure for all of the tapestries.10 	Then were joined five of the tapestries, each one to each one,<br>	and five tapestries were joined, each one to each one.11 	Then were made loops of blue-violet<br>	on the edge of the one tapestry, at the end of the one joint;<br>	thus were made in the edge of the end tapestry at the second joint.12 	Fifty loops were made on the one tapestry,<br>	and fifty loops were made at the end of the tapestry that is at the second joint,<br>	opposite the loops, each one to each one.13 	Then were made fifty clasps of gold<br>	and then were joined the tapestries, this-one to that-one, with the clasps,<br>	so that the dwelling became one [piece].14 	Then were made the tapestries of goats’-hair for a tent over the dwelling,<br>	eleven tapestries were they made.15 	The length of each one tapestry: thirty by the cubit,<br>	and four cubits, the width of each one tapestry,<br>	one measure for the eleven tapestries.16 	Then were joined five of the tapestries separately<br>	and six of the tapestries separately.17 	Then were made loops, fifty, at the edge of the end tap estry, at the joint,<br>	and fifty loops were made at the edge of the second joining tapestry.18 	Then were made clasps of bronze, fifty,<br>	to join the tent together,<br>	to become one [piece].19 	Then was made a covering for the tent, of rams’ skins dyed-red,<br>	and a covering of tanned-leather skins, above it.20 	Then were made the boards for the Dwelling,<br>	of acacia wood, standing upright;21 	ten cubits the length of the board<br>	and a cubit and a half the width of each one board,22 	with two pegs for each one board, parallel one to one;<br>	thus were made for all the boards of the Dwelling.23 	And then were made the boards for the Dwelling:<br>	twenty as boardwork on the Negev border, southward,24 	and forty sockets of silver were made beneath twenty of the boards,<br>	two sockets beneath each one board for its two pegs<br>	and two sockets beneath each [other] board for its two pegs;25 	and for the second flank of the Dwelling, on the northern border, were made twenty as boardwork,26 	with their forty sockets of silver,<br>	two sockets beneath each one board<br>	and two sockets beneath each [other] board.27 	And for the rear of the Dwelling, toward the sea, were made six boards,28 	and two boards were made for the corners of the Dwelling, at the rear,29 	so that they were of twin-use, [seen] from the lower-end,<br>	and together formed a whole-piece, toward the top, toward the first ring;<br>	thus were made for the two of them, for the two corners.30 	So there were eight boards with their bases of silver, sixteen bases,<br>	two bases each, two bases beneath [each] one board.31 	Then were made running-bars of acacia wood,<br>	five bars for the boards of the Dwelling’s one flank32 	and five bars for the boards of the Dwelling’s second flank,<br>	and five bars for the boards of the Dwelling at the rear, toward the sea.33 	Then was made the middle running-bar, to run amidst the boards,<br>	from end to end.34 	And the boards were overlaid with gold,<br>	and their rings were made of gold, as holders for the bars,<br>	and the bars were overlaid with gold.35 	Then was made the curtain<br>	of blue-violet, purple, worm scarlet and twisted byssus;<br>	of designer’s making was it made, with winged-sphinxes.36 	Then were made for it four columns of acacia<br>	and were overlaid with gold, their hooks of gold,<br>	and four bases of silver were cast for them.37 	Then was made a screen for the entrance to the Tent<br>	of blue-violet, purple, worm scarlet and twisted byssus,<br>	of embroiderer’s making,38 	and their columns, five, and their hooks,<br>	and their tops and their binders were overlaid with gold—<br>	and their bases, five, of bronze.37:1 @ 	Then Betzalel made<br>	the Coffer, of acacia wood:<br>	two cubits and a half its length,<br>	a cubit and a half its width,<br>	and a cubit and a half its height.2 	He overlaid it with pure gold, inside and outside,<br>	and made for it a rim of gold all around.3 	He cast for it four rings of gold<br>	[to be] upon its four feet,<br>	with two rings on its one flank<br>	and two rings on its second flank.4 	He made poles of acacia wood<br>	and overlaid them with gold,5 	and brought the poles into the rings on the flanks of the Coffer, to carry the Coffer.6 	He made a purgation-cover of pure gold:<br>	two cubits and a half its length<br>	and a cubit and a half its width.7 	He made two winged-sphinxes of gold;<br>	of hammered-work did he make them,<br>	at the two ends of the purgation-cover.8 	One sphinx at the end here<br>	and one sphinx at the end here,<br>	from the purgation-cover did he make the sphinxes, at its two ends.9 	And the sphinxes were spreading [their] wings upward,<br>	with their wings sheltering the purgation-cover,<br>	their faces, each toward the other;<br>	toward the purgation-cover were the sphinxes’ faces.10 @ 	He made the table of acacia wood:<br>	two cubits its length,<br>	a cubit its width,<br>	and a cubit and a half its height.11 	He overlaid it with pure gold.<br>	And he made a rim of gold for it, all around,12 	and made a border for it, a handbreadth all around,<br>	thus he made a rim of gold for its border, all around.13 	He cast for it four rings of gold<br>	and put the rings at the four edges, where its four legs are.14 	Parallel to the border were the rings,<br>	holders for the poles, to carry the table.15 	He made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold,<br>	to carry the table.16 	He made the implements that are on the table:<br>	its dishes and its ladles,<br>	its jugs and jars, from which [offerings] are poured,<br>	of pure gold.17 @ 	He made the lampstand of pure gold;<br>	of hammered-work did he make the lampstand, its shaft and its stem,<br>	its goblets, its knobs and its blossoms were from itself;18 	six stems issuing from its sides,<br>	three lamp-stems on the one side,<br>	three lamp-stems on the second side:19 	three almond-shaped goblets on the one stem, with knobs and blossoms,<br>	and three almond-shaped goblets on the [other] one stem, with knobs and blossoms—<br>	thus for the six stems that were issuing from the lampstand.20 	And on the lampstand [itself] four almond-shaped goblets, with their knobs and their blossoms,21 	a knob beneath two stems, from itself,<br>	a knob beneath two stems, from itself,<br>	and a knob beneath two stems, from itself,<br>	for the six stems that were issuing from itself.22 	Their knobs and their stems were from itself,<br>	all of it one-piece of hammered-work, of pure gold.23 	He made its lamps, seven,<br>	and its tongs and its trays, of pure gold.24 	From an ingot of pure gold did he make it, with all its implements.25 @ 	He made the altar for smoking-incense, of acacia wood:<br>	a cubit its length and a cubit its width,<br>	squared, and two cubits its height;<br>	from itself were its two horns.26 	He overlaid it with pure gold—<br>	its roof, its walls all around, and its horns,<br>	and he made a rim of gold for it, all around.27 	Two rings of gold did he make for it, beneath its rim,<br>	on its two flanks, on its two sides,<br>	as holders for poles, to carry it by means of them.28 	He made the poles of acacia wood,<br>	and overlaid them with gold.29 @ 	And he made the anointing oil of holiness<br>	and the fragrant smoking-incense, pure, of perfumer’s making.38:1 @ 	Then he made the altar of offering-up, of acacia wood,<br>	five cubits its length, five cubits its width, square,<br>	and three cubits its height.2 	He made its horns on its four points;<br>	from itself were its horns.<br>	He overlaid it with bronze.3 	He made all the implements for the altar,<br>	the pails, the scrapers, the bowls, the flesh-hooks, and the pans;<br>	all its implements, he made of bronze.4 	He made for the altar a lattice, as a netting of bronze is made,<br>	beneath its ledge, below, [reaching] to its halfway-point.5 	He cast four rings on the four edges of the netting of bronze,<br>	as holders for the poles.6 	He made the poles of acacia wood<br>	and overlaid them with bronze.7 	He brought the poles through the rings on the flanks of the altar,<br>	to carry it by means of them;<br>	hollow, of planks, did he make it.8 @ 	He made the basin of bronze, its pedestal of bronze,<br>	with the mirrors of the women’s working-force that was doing-the-work at the entrance of the Tent of Appointment.9 @ 	And he made the courtyard:<br>	on the Negev border, southward,<br>	the hangings of the courtyard, of twisted byssus, a hundred by the cubit,10 	with their columns, twenty, their sockets, twenty, of bronze,<br>	the hooks of the columns and their binders, of silver.11 	And on the northern border, a hundred by the cubit,<br>	their columns, twenty, their sockets, twenty, of bronze,<br>	the hooks of the columns and their binders, of silver.12 	And on the sea border, hangings, fifty by the cubit,<br>	their columns, ten, their sockets, ten,<br>	the hooks of the columns and their binders, of silver.13 	And on the eastern border, toward sunrise, fifty by the cubit,14 	[namely:] hangings of fifteen cubits to the shoulder-piece,<br>	their columns, three, their sockets, three,15 	and for the second shoulder-piece—[over] here and [over] here for the gate of the courtyard—<br>	hangings of fifteen cubits,<br>	their columns, three, their sockets, three.16 	All the hangings of the courtyard all around, of twisted byssus,17 	and the sockets for the columns, of bronze,<br>	the hooks of the columns and their binders, of silver,<br>	and the overlay for their tops, of silver, they themselves bound with silver,<br>	all the columns of the courtyard.18 	The screen of the courtyard gate, of embroiderer’s making,<br>	of blue-violet, purple, worm scarlet and twisted byssus,<br>	twenty cubits in length,<br>	their height along the width, five cubits,<br>	corresponding to the hangings of the courtyard;19 	their columns, four, their sockets, four, of bronze,<br>	their hooks, of silver,<br>	and the overlay for their tops and their binders, of silver,20 	and all the pins for the Dwelling and for the courtyard all around, of bronze.21 @ 	These are the accountings of the Dwelling,<br>	the Dwelling of Testimony,<br>	that were accounted by Moshe<br>	for the service of the Levites,<br>	under Itamar, son of Aharon the priest:22 	So Betzalel son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Yehuda<br>	had made<br>	all that <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe,23 	and with him, Oholiav son of Ahisamakh, of the tribe of Dan,<br>	carver, designer, embroiderer in the blue-violet, purple and worm scarlet and byssus.24 	All the gold that was made-use-of in the work, in all the work of [building] the Holy-Shrine,<br>	all the gold from the elevation-offering was<br>	twenty-nine ingots and seven hundred thirty <i>shekels</i>, by the Holy-Shrine <i>shekel</i>.25 	And the silver accounted for by the community was a hundred ingots,<br>	and a thousand and seven hundred and seventy-five <i>shekels</i> by the Holy-Shrine <i>shekel,</i>26 	a <i>beka</i>/split-piece per capita, the half of a <i>shekel</i> by the Holy-Shrine <i>shekel,</i><br>	for every one who went through the counting,<br>	from the age of twenty years and upward,<br>	for the six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.27 	There were a hundred ingots of silver for the casting of the sockets of the Holy-Shrine and of the sockets of the curtain<br>	a hundred bases per hundred ingots, an ingot per socket.28 	And the thousand, seven hundred and seventy-five they made into hooks for the columns,<br>	and overlaid their tops and bound them.29 	And the bronze from the elevation-offering was seventy ingots,<br>	and two thousand and four hundred <i>shekels</i>.30 	They made with it the sockets for the entrance of the Tent of Appointment,<br>	the altar of bronze, the netting of bronze that belonged to it, all the implements of the altar,31 	the sockets of the courtyard all around and the sockets of the courtyard gate<br>	and all the pins of the Dwelling and the pins of the courtyard, all around.39:1 @ 	Now from the blue-violet and the purple and the worm scarlet<br>	they made the officiating garments for attending at the Holy-Shrine,<br>	and they made the garments of holiness that are for Aharon,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe.2 @ 	Then was made the <i>efod</i>,<br>	of gold, blue-violet, purple, worm scarlet and twisted byssus.3 	Then were beat out sheets of gold<br>	and they were split into threads,<br>	to make-use-of-them amid the blue-violet, amid the purple, amid the worm scarlet and amid the twisted byssus,<br>	[all] of designer’s making.4 	Shoulder-pieces they made for it, [to be] joined together,<br>	on its two ends joined.5 	The designed-band of its <i>efod</i> that was on it, was from itself, of like making,<br>	of gold, blue-violet, purple, worm scarlet and twisted byssus,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe.6 @ 	They made the onyx stones,<br>	surrounded by braids of gold,<br>	engraved with seal engravings, with the names of the Children of Israel.7 	They placed them on the shoulder-pieces of the <i>efod,</i><br>	as stones of reminder for the Children of Israel,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe.8 @ 	Then was made the Breastpiece<br>	of designer’s making, like the making of an <i>efod</i>,<br>	of gold, blue-violet, purple, worm scarlet and twisted byssus.9 	Square it was, doubled they made the Breastpiece,<br>	a span its length and a span its width, doubled.10 	They set-it-full with four rows of stones—<br>	a row of carnelian, topaz, and sparkling-emerald, the first row,11 	and the second row: ruby, sapphire and hard-onyx,12 	and the third row: jacinth, agate, and amethyst,13 	and the fourth row: beryl, onyx and jasper;<br>	surrounded, braided with gold in their settings.14 	And the stones were with the names of the Children of Israel,<br>	twelve with their names,<br>	signet engravings, each with its name,<br>	for the twelve tribes.15 	They made, on the Breastpiece, laced chains, of rope-making, of pure gold:16 	they made two braids of gold and two rings of gold,<br>	and put the two rings on the two ends of the Breastpiece,17 	and put the two ropes of gold on the two rings on the ends of the Breastpiece,18 	and the two ends of the two ropes they put on the two braids,<br>	and put them on the shoulder-pieces of the <i>efod,</i> on its forefront.19 	They made two rings of gold,<br>	and placed them on the two ends of the Breastpiece, on its edge that is across from the <i>efod,</i> inward,20 	and they made two rings of gold and put them on the two shoulder- pieces of the <i>efod,</i> below, facing frontward, parallel to its joint, above the designed-band of the <i>efod</i>.21 	They tied the Breastpiece from its rings to the rings of the <i>efod,</i> with a thread of blue-violet,<br>	to be [fixed] on the designed-band of the <i>efod;</i><br>	the Breastpiece was not to be dislodged from the <i>efod,</i><br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe.22 @ 	Then was made the robe of the <i>efod,</i><br>	of weaver’s making, all of blue-violet.23 	The head-opening of the robe in its middle, like the opening for armor,<br>	a seam-edge for its opening, all around—it was not to be split.24 	They made, on the skirts of the robe, pomegranates,<br>	of blue-violet, purple, worm-scarlet and twisted byssus.25 	They made bells of pure gold<br>	and they put the bells amidst the pomegranates<br>	on the skirts of the robe, all around,<br>	amidst the pomegranates:26 	bell and pomegranate, bell and pomegranate,<br>	on the skirts of the robe, all around,<br>	for attending,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe.27 @ 	They made the tunic of byssus, of weaver’s making,<br>	for Aharon and for his sons,28 	and the turban of byssus,<br>	the splendid caps of byssus,<br>	the breeches of linen, of twisted byssus,29 	and the sash of twisted byssus, blue-violet, purple, and worm scarlet, of embroiderer’s making,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe.30 @ 	They made the plate [for] the sacred-diadem of holiness, of pure gold,<br>	and wrote upon it writing of signet engravings:<br>	<i>Holiness for <sc>Yhwh</sc></i>.31 	They put on it a thread of blue-violet, to put on the turban from above,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe.32 @ 	Thus was finished all the service [of construction] for the Dwelling, the Tent of Appointment.<br>	The Children of Israel made [it];<br>	exactly as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe,<br>	thus they made.33 	And they brought the Dwelling to Moshe:<br>	the tent and all its implements,<br>	its clasps, its beams, its bars and its columns and its sockets,34 	the covering of rams’ skins dyed-red and the covering of tanned-leather skins,<br>	the curtain for the screen,35 	the Coffer of the Testimony and its poles<br>	and the purgation-cover,36 	the table, all its implements and the Bread of the Presence,37 	the pure lampstand, its lamps—lamps for arranging, and all its implements,<br>	and the oil for lighting,38 	the site of gold,<br>	and anointing oil and the fragant smoking-incense<br>	and the screen for the entrance of the Tent;39 	the altar of bronze and the netting of bronze that belongs to it, its poles and all its implements,<br>	the basin and its pedestal;40 	the hangings of the courtyard,<br>	its columns and its sockets,<br>	and the screen for the courtyard gate,<br>	its cords and its pegs<br>	and all the implements for the service [of constructing] the Dwelling, the Tent of Appointment;41 	the officiating garments for attending at the Holy-Shrine, the garments of holiness for Aharon the priest and the garments for his sons, to be-priests—42 	exactly as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe,<br>	thus had made the Children of Israel,<br>	all the service [of construction].43 	Now Moshe saw all the work, and here, they had made it<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded,<br>	thus had they made.<br>	Then Moshe blessed them.40:1 @ 	Now <sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:2 	On the first day of the month, on [day] one of the month,<br>	you are to erect the Dwelling, the Tent of Appointment.3 	You are to place there the Coffer of the Testimony<br>	and you are to screen the Coffer with the curtain.4 	You are to bring in the table and arrange its arrangement,<br>	you are to bring in the lampstand and are to draw up its lampwicks,5 	you are to put the site of gold [there], for smoking-incense, before the Coffer of the Testimony,<br>	and you are to place the screen of the entrance for the Dwelling;6 	you are to put the altar for offering-up before the entrance of the Dwelling, the Tent of Appointment,7 	you are to put the basin between the Tent of Appointment and the altar,<br>	and you are to put water therein.8 	You are to place the courtyard all around, and you are to put the screen for the gate of the courtyard [there].9 	Then you are to take the anointing oil<br>	and you are to anoint the Dwelling and all that is in it;<br>	you are [thus] to hallow it and all its implements, that they may become holiness;10 	you are to anoint the altar for offering-up and all its implements,<br>	you are [thus] to hallow the altar, that the altar may become holiest holiness;11 	you are to anoint the basin and its pedestal&mdash;<br>	you are [thus] to hallow it.12 	You are to bring near Aharon and his sons to the entrance of the Tent of Appointment,<br>	you are to wash them with water,13 	and you are to clothe Aharon in the garments of holiness;<br>	you are to anoint him,<br>	and you are [thus] to hallow him, to be-priest to me.14 	And his sons you are to bring near,<br>	you are to clothe them in coats,15 	and are to anoint them as you anointed their father, that they may be-priests for me;<br>	that shall become for them—their being-anointed—priesthood for the ages, throughout their generations.16 	Moshe made [it];<br>	exactly as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded him,<br>	thus he made.17 @ 	And so it was in the first month in the second year, on the first [day] of the month:<br>	the Dwelling was erected.18 	Moshe erected the Dwelling:<br>	he put up its sockets,<br>	he placed its boards,<br>	he put up its bars,<br>	he erected its columns,19 	he spread out the tent over the Dwelling,<br>	and he placed the cover of the tent over it, above,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe.20 @ 	He took and put the Testimony in the Coffer,<br>	he placed the poles of the Coffer,<br>	he put the purgation-cover of the Coffer, above,21 	he brought the Coffer into the Dwelling,<br>	and he placed [there] the curtain of the screen and screened the Coffer of the Testimony,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe.22 @ 	He put the table in the Tent of Appointment,<br>	on the flank of the Dwelling, northward, outside the curtain,23 	and arranged on it the arrangement of the Bread of the Presence, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe.24 @ 	He placed the lampstand in the Tent of Appointment,<br>	opposite the table, on the flank of the Dwelling, southward,25 	and set up the lamps before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe.26 @ 	He placed the altar of gold in the Tent of Appointment, before the curtain,27 	and sent-up-in-smoke on it fragrant smoking-incense,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe.28 @ 	He placed [there] the screen for the entrance of the Dwelling,29 	while the altar for offering-up he placed at the entrance of the Dwelling, of the Tent of Appointment,<br>	and offered-up on it the offerings-up and the grain-gifts,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe.30 @ 	He placed the basin between the Tent of Appointment and the altar,<br>	and put water therein, for washing,31 	that Moshe and Aharon and his sons might wash from it their hands and their feet,32 	[that] whenever they came into the Tent of Appointment and whenever they came near the altar, they might wash,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe.33 @ 	He erected the courtyard all around the Dwelling and the altar,<br>	and put up the screen for the courtyard gate.<br> @ 	So Moshe finished the work.34 	Now the cloud covered the Tent of Appointment,<br>	and the Glory of <sc>Yhwh</sc> filled the Dwelling.35 	Moshe was not able to come into the Tent of Appointment,<br>	for the cloud took-up-dwelling on it, and the Glory of <sc>Yhwh</sc> filled the Dwelling.36 	Whenever the cloud went up from the Dwelling,<br>	the Children of Israel would march on, upon all their marches;37 	if the cloud did not go up,<br>	they would not march on, until such time as it does go up.38 	For the cloud of <sc>Yhwh</sc> was over the Dwelling by day,<br>	and fire would be by night in it,<br>	before the eyes of all the House of Israel<br>	upon all their marches.LEVITICUS 1:1 @ 	And he called to Moshe—<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to him from the Tent of Appointment, saying:2 	Speak to the Children of Israel and say to them:<br>	Anyone—when [one] among you brings near a near-offering for <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	from domestic-animals: from the herd or from the flock you may bring near your near-offering.3 	If an offering-up is his near-offering, from the herd,<br>	male, wholly-sound, let him bring it near;<br>	to the entrance of the Tent of Appointment let him bring it near,<br>	as acceptance for him, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.4 	He is to lean his hand on the head of the offering-up,<br>	that there may be acceptance on his behalf, to effect-ransom for him.5 	He is to slaughter the herd-animal [for sacrifice] before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	and the Sons of Aharon, the priests, are to bring near the blood<br>	and are to dash the blood against the altar, all around,<br>	that is at the entrance of the Tent of Appointment.6 	Then he is to flay the offering-up, and is to section it into its sections.7 	Now the Sons of Aharon the priest are to put fire on the altar<br>	and are to arrange wood on the fire.8 	The Sons of Aharon, the priests, are to arrange the sections, the head and the suet,<br>	on the wood that is on the fire, that is on the altar,9 	while its innards and its shins he is to wash in water;<br>	and the priest is to turn all-of-it into smoke upon the altar,<br>	for an offering-up, a fire-offering of soothing savor for <sc>Yhwh</sc>.10 @ 	Now if from the flock is his near-offering,<br>	from the sheep or from the goats, for an offering-up,<br>	male, wholly-sound, let him bring it near.11 	He is to slaughter it on the flank of the altar, northward, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	and the Sons of Aharon, the priests, are to dash its blood against the altar, all around.12 	Then he is to section it into its sections, with its head and with its suet,<br>	and the priest is to arrange them on the wood that is on the fire, that is on the altar,13 	while the innards and the shins he is to wash in water;<br>	and the priest is to bring all-of-it near and turn it into smoke upon the altar:<br>	it is an offering-up,<br>	a fire-offering of soothing savor for <sc>Yhwh</sc>.14 	Now if from birds is his offered-up near-offering for <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	he is to bring near from turtledoves or from young pigeons as his near-offering.15 	The priest is to bring it near on the altar<br>	and pinch off its head;<br>	he is to turn it into smoke on the altar,<br>	and its blood is to be drained out against the side-wall of the altar.16 	He is to remove its crissum by means of its plumage<br>	and is to fling it next to the altar, eastward,<br>	into the place of the ashes.17 	He is to tear it open by its wings—he is not to divide [it]!—<br>	and the priest is to turn it into smoke upon the altar, on the wood that is on the fire:<br>	it is an offering-up,<br>	a fire-offering of soothing savor for <sc>Yhwh</sc>.2:1 @ 	Now a person—when he brings near a near-offering of a grain-gift for <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	of [proper] flour shall his near-offering be.<br>	He is to pour oil on it and is to put frankincense on it;2 	then he is to bring it to the Sons of Aharon, the priests.<br>	He is to scoop from there a scoopful from its flour and from its oil, along with all its frankincense;<br>	the priest is to turn its reminder-portion into smoke upon the altar,<br>	a fire-offering of soothing savor for <sc>Yhwh</sc>.3 	Now what is left of the grain-gift is Aharon’s and his sons’,<br>	a holiest holy-portion from the fire-offerings of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.4 @ 	When you bring near a near-offering of a grain-gift baked in an oven,<br>	[it is to be] of flour: <i>matza</i>/unleavened cakes mixed with oil, <i>matza</i> wafers spread with oil.5 	And if a grain-gift on a griddle is your near-offering,<br>	flour mixed with oil—unleavened shall it be.6 	Crumble it into crumbled-bits, and pour oil on it;<br>	it is a grain-gift.7 	And if a grain-gift in a frying-pan is your near-offering,<br>	of flour in oil shall it be made.8 	Should you bring a grain-gift that is made in [any of] these ways to <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	it is to be brought near to the priest, and he is to bring-it-close to the altar.9 	The priest is to set-aside its remindee-portion from the grain-gift<br>	and is to turn it into smoke on the altar;<br>	a fire-offering of soothing savor for <sc>Yhwh</sc>.10 	And what is left of the grain-gift is Aharon’s and his sons’,<br>	a holiest holy-portion from the fire-offerings of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.11 	Every grain-gift that you bring near to <sc>Yhwh</sc>&mdash;it is not to be made leavened,<br>	for any fermentation and any date-honey—you may not turn [any] of it into smoke as a fire-offering to <sc>Yhwh</sc>;12 	as a near-offering of premier-fruits you may bring them near to <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	but on the altar they are not to offer them up as a soothing savor.13 	All your near-offerings of a grain-gift you are to salt with salt;<br>	you are not to omit the salt of your God’s covenant from atop your grain-gift&mdash;<br>	atop all your near-offerings you are to bring near salt.14 @ 	Now if you bring near a grain-gift of firstfruits to <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	budding-grain, parched with fire, grits of fresh-grain you are to bring near as your grain-gift of firstfruits.15 	You are to put oil on it,<br>	you are to place frankincense on it:<br>	it is a grain-gift.16 	The priest is to turn the reminder-portion into smoke, from its grits and from its oil, along with all its frankincense,<br>	as a fire-offering for <sc>Yhwh</sc>.3:1 @ 	Now if a sacrifice of <i>shalom</i> is his near-offering:<br>	if it is from the herd that he brings it near,<br>	whether male or whether female, wholly-sound he is to bring it near, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.2 	He is to lean his hand on the head of his near-offering,<br>	and he is to slaughter it at the entrance of the Tent of Appointment,<br>	and the Sons of Aharon, the priests, are to dash the blood against the altar, all around.3 	Then he is to bring near from the sacrifice of <i>shalom,</i> a fire-offering to <sc>Yhwh</sc>:<br>	the fat that covers the innards and all the fat that is about the innards,4 	the two kidneys and the fat that is about them, that is on the tendons,<br>	and the extension on the liver—along with the kidneys he is to remove it.5 	And the Sons of Aharon are to turn it [all] into smoke upon the altar,<br>	along with the offering-up that is on the wood, that is on the fire,<br>	—a fire-offering of soothing savor for <sc>Yhwh</sc>.6 @ 	Now if from the flock is his near-offering,<br>	as a sacrifice of <i>shalom</i> for <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	male or female, wholly-sound he is to bring it near.7 	If it is a sheep that he brings near as a near-offering,<br>	he is to bring it near before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.8 	He is to lean his hand on the head of his near-offering,<br>	and he is to slaughter it in front of the Tent of Appointment,<br>	and the Sons of Aharon are to dash its blood against the altar, all around.9 	Then he is to bring near, from the sacrifice of <i>shalom</i>—as a fire-offering for <sc>Yhwh</sc>—<br>	its fat:<br>	the whole thick tail, close to the backbone he is to remove it,<br>	the fat that covers the innards and all the fat that is about the innards,10 	the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, that is on the tendons,<br>	and the extension on the liver—along with the kidneys he is to remove it.11 	Then the priest is to turn it into smoke upon the altar<br>	as food, a fire-offering for <sc>Yhwh</sc>.12 @ 	Now if it is a goat that is his near-offering:<br>	he is to bring it near, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.13 	He is to lean his hand on its head<br>	and he is to slaughter it in front of the Tent of Appointment;<br>	and the Sons of Aharon are to dash its blood against the altar, all around.14 	Then he is to bring-near from it his near-offering—a fire-offering for <sc>Yhwh</sc>:<br>	the fat that covers the innards and all the fat that is about the innards,15 	the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, that is on the tendons,<br>	and the extension on the liver—along with the kidneys he is to remove it.16 	The priest is to turn them into smoke upon the altar<br>	as food, a fire-offering of soothing savor,<br>	—all the fat is for <sc>Yhwh</sc>,17 	a law for the ages, into your generations, throughout all your settlements:<br>	any fat and any blood you are not to eat!4:1 @ 	Now <sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:2 	Speak to the Children of Israel, saying:<br>	[Any] person—when one sins in error<br>	regarding any of <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> commandments that should not be done,<br>	by doing any one of them:3 	if the Anointed Priest should sin, to the guilt of the people,<br>	he is to bring near, for the sin that he has sinned,<br>	a bull, a young of the herd, wholly-sound, for <sc>Yhwh</sc> as a <i>hattat</i>/decontamination-offering.4 	He is to bring the bull to the entrance of the Tent of Appointment, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	he is to lean his hand on the head of the bull<br>	and he is to slaughter the bull before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.5 	Then the Anointed Priest is to take some of the blood of the bull<br>	and is to bring it into the Tent of Appointment,6 	the priest is to dip his finger in the blood<br>	and is to sprinkle some of the blood seven times, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	in front of the curtain of the Holy-Shrine.7 	Then the priest is to put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant smoking-incense, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	that is in the Tent of Appointment;<br>	as for all the [rest of the] blood of the bull, he is to pour it out at the foundation of the altar of offering-up<br>	that is at the entrance of the Tent of Appointment.8 	As for all of the fat of the bull of the <i>hattat</i>-offering, he is to set it [all] aside from it:<br>	the fat that covers the innards and all the fat that is about the innards,9 	the two kidneys and the fat that is about them, that is on the tendons,<br>	and the extension on the liver—along with the kidneys he is to remove it10 	just as it is set-aside from the ox of the sacrifice of <i>shalom</i>.<br>	And the priest is to turn them into smoke on the altar of offering-up.11 	As for the skin of the bull, and all its flesh,<br>	along with its head, along with its shins, and its innards and its dung:12 	he is to take out all [the rest of] the bull, outside the camp,<br>	to a [ritually] pure place, to the ash dump,<br>	and he is to burn it on pieces-of-wood, in fire;<br>	on the ash dump it is to be burned.13 @ 	Now if the entire community of Israel errs,<br>	and the matter is hidden from the eyes of the assembly<br>	so that they do one of any of the things [regarding] <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> commandments that should not be done,<br>	and so incur-guilt:14 	when it becomes-known, the sin that they sinned,<br>	the assembly are to bring near a bull, a young of the herd, as a <i>hattat</i>-offering;<br>	they are to bring it before the Tent of Appointment.15 	The elders of the community are to lean their hands on the head of the bull, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	and the bull is to be slaughtered before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.16 	Then the Anointed Priest is to bring some of the blood of the bull into the Tent of Appointment;17 	the priest is to dip his finger in some of the blood<br>	and is to sprinkle [it] seven times before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	in front of the curtain.18 	And some of the blood he is to put on the horns of the altar that is before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	that is in the Tent of Appointment;<br>	as for all the [rest of the] blood, he is to pour it out at the foundation of the altar of offering-up<br>	that is at the entrance of the Tent of Appointment.19 	As for all its fat, he is to set it [all] aside from it<br>	and turn it into smoke on the altar.20 	He is to do with the bull just as he did with the bull of the <i>hattat-</i>offering, thus is he to do with it;<br>	the priest shall effect-purgation on their behalf, and they shall be granted-pardon.21 	He is to take the bull outside the camp,<br>	and he is to burn it just as one burned the first bull;<br>	it is a <i>hattat-</i>offering for the assembly!22 @ 	Where a leader sins,<br>	by doing any one of [the things] regarding the commandments of <sc>Yhwh</sc> his God that should not be done, in error,<br>	and so incurs-guilt,23 	or it is made known to him his sin that he has sinned:<br>	he is to bring as his near-offering: a hairy-one of goats, male, wholly-sound.24 	He is to lean his hand on the head of the hairy-one<br>	and it is to be slaughtered at the place where the offering-up is slaughtered, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>;<br>	it is a <i>hattat-</i>offering.25 	The priest is to take some of the blood of the <i>hattat</i> with his finger<br>	and is to put [it] on the horns of the altar of offering-up;<br>	its blood he is to pour out at the foundation of the altar of offering-up.26 	All its fat he is to turn into smoke upon the altar,<br>	like the fat of the sacrifice of <i>shalom;</i><br>	thus the priest is to effect-purgation for him from his sin,<br>	and he shall be granted-pardon.27 @ 	Now if any person sins in error, from among the people of the land,<br>	by doing one [thing] regarding the commandments of <sc>Yhwh</sc> that should not be done,<br>	and so incurs-guilt,28 	or it is made known to him the sin that he sinned:<br>	he is to bring as his near-offering a hairy-one of goats, wholly-sound, female, for the sin whereby he sinned.29 	He is to lean his hand on the head of the <i>hattat-</i>offering<br>	and is to slaughter the <i>hattat-</i>offering<i>,</i> at the place of the offering-up.30 	The priest is to take some of the blood of the <i>hattat-</i>offering with his finger<br>	and is to put [it] on the horns of the altar of offering-up;<br>	all [the rest of] its blood he is to pour out at the foundation of the altar of offering-up.31 	All of its fat, he is to remove, as the fat was removed from upon the sacrifice of <i>shalom,</i><br>	and the priest is to turn it into smoke upon the altar,<br>	as a soothing savor for <sc>Yhwh</sc>;<br>	thus the priest is to effect-purgation for him,<br>	and he shall be granted-pardon.32 	If [it is] a sheep he brings as his near-offering for a <i>hattat-</i>offering,<br>	a female, wholly-sound, he is to bring.33 	He is to lean his hand on the head of the <i>hattat-</i>offering<i>,</i><br>	and it is to be slaughtered as a <i>hattat-</i>offering in the place where the offering-up is slaughtered.34 	The priest is to take some of the blood of the <i>hattat-</i>offering with his finger<br>	and is to put [it] on the horns of the altar of offering-up;<br>	all [the rest] of its blood he is to pour out at the foundation of the altar of offering-up.35 	All of its fat he is to remove, as the fat of the sheep was removed from the sacrifice of <i>shalom,</i><br>	and the priest is to turn them into smoke upon the altar, along with the fire-offerings of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.<br>	Thus the priest is to effect-purgation for him for his sin whereby he sinned,<br>	and he shall be granted-pardon.5:1 @ 	Now a person—when he sins:<br>	should he hear the public-voice [carrying] a threat<br>	and though he was a witness, either seeing or knowing,<br>	he does not tell,<br>	he is to bear his iniquity;2 	or a person that touches anything <i>tamei,</i><br>	either the carcass of a <i>tamei</i> wild-animal or the carcass of a <i>tamei</i> domestic-animal or the carcass of a <i>tamei</i> swarming-creature,<br>	and though [the fact] is hidden from him,<br>	he has become-<i>tamei,</i> and so has incurred-guilt;3 	or when he touches human <i>tum’a</i>, including any <i>tum’a</i> whereby one can become-<i>tamei</i>—<br>	and though [the fact] is hidden from him,<br>	he [later] comes-to-know that he incurred-guilt;4 	or a person—when he swears rashly with his lips, to-do-ill or to-do-good, including whatever a human might say-rashly in swearing—<br>	and though [the fact] is hidden from him,<br>	he comes-to-know that he incurred-guilt in [any] one of these matters:5 	it shall be, when he realizes-guilt in [any] one of these,<br>	and confesses how he has sinned thereby,6 	that he is to bring his <i>asham</i>/guilt-offering to <sc>Yhwh</sc>, for the sin whereby he has sinned:<br>	a female from the flock, a she-lamb or a hairy she-goat, as a <i>hattat-</i>offering<i>,</i><br>	and the priest is to effect-purgation for him from his sin.7 	Now if his hand cannot reach enough [means] for a sheep,<br>	he is to bring as his <i>asham</i>-offering [for] what he sinned:<br>	two turtledoves or two young pigeons, to <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	one for a <i>hattat</i>-offering and one for an offering-up;8 	he is to bring them to the priest,<br>	and he is to bring-near the one for the <i>hattat</i>-offering first,<br>	and pinch off its head opposite the back-of-the-neck—he is not to divide [it]!9 	He is to sprinkle some of the blood of the <i>hattat</i>-offering against the side-wall of the altar;<br>	what remains of the blood is to be drained out at the foundation of the altar,<br>	it is a <i>hattat</i>-offering<i>.</i>10 	And the second one he is to make as an offering-up, according to regulation;<br>	the priest is to effect-purgation on his behalf from the sin whereby he sinned,<br>	and he shall be granted-pardon.11 	Now if his hand cannot reach [means for] two turtledoves or two young pigeons,<br>	he is to bring as his near-offering [for] what he sinned<br>	a tenth of an <i>efa</i> of flour, for a <i>hattat</i>-offering;<br>	he is not to put oil on it, and he is not to place frankincense on it,<br>	for it is a <i>hattat</i>-offering.12 	He is to bring it to the priest,<br>	the priest is to scoop out with his fist a fistful of some of it, as a reminder-portion,<br>	and is to turn it into smoke on the altar, along with the fire-offerings of <sc>Yhwh</sc>:<br>	it is a <i>hattat</i>-offering<i>.</i>13 	So the priest is to effect-purgation for him for his sin whereby he sinned, in [any] one of these,<br>	and he shall be granted-pardon.<br>	And it shall be for the priest, like the grain-gift.14 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:15 	A person—when he breaks-faith, yes, faith, and sins in error regarding any of the holy-things of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	he is to bring as his <i>asham</i>/penalty to <sc>Yhwh</sc>: a ram, wholly-sound, from the flock,<br>	by your assessment in silver <i>shekels</i> by the Holy-Shrine <i>shekel,</i> as an <i>asham</i>.16 	For that whereby he sinned regarding the holy-things, he is to pay, and its fifth he is to add to it, and give it to the priest;<br>	then the priest is to effect-purgation on his behalf with the ram of <i>asham,</i><br>	and he shall be granted-pardon.17 @ 	But if a person—when he sins,<br>	by doing any one of the commandments of <sc>Yhwh</sc> that are not to be done,<br>	[even] if he did not know that he incurred-guilt,<br>	he must bear his iniquity:18 	he is to bring a ram, wholly-sound, from the flock,<br>	by your assessment, as an <i>asham</i>-offering, to the priest;<br>	the priest is to effect-purgation on his behalf for the error whereby he erred, [even] if he did not know,<br>	and he shall be granted-pardon.19 	It is an <i>asham</i>/guilt-offering—he incurred-guilt, yes, guilt before <sc>Yhwh</sc>.20 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:21 	A person—when one sins and breaks-faith, yes, faith against <sc>Yhwh</sc>:<br>	he denies his fellow’s [charges] regarding a deposit, or what is placed in one’s hand [for safekeeping], or robbery,<br>	or withholds [property] from his fellow;22 	or finds a lost-object and denies it,<br>	or swears falsely regarding one of anything that a human may do, to sin by the aforementioned—23 	it shall be, when he has sinned and realized-his-guilt,<br>	he is to return the robbed-object that he robbed<br>	or the withheld [property] that he withheld<br>	or the deposit that was deposited with him<br>	or the lost-object that he found,24 	or anything [else] about which he swore falsely;<br>	he is to repay it in its capital-amount, and its fifth he is to add to it.<br>	To the one whose it is, he is to give it at the time of his being-proven-guilty.25 	And as his <i>asham</i>-offering he is to bring to <sc>Yhwh</sc>:<br>	a ram, wholly-sound, from the flock, by your assessment, for an <i>asham</i>-offering, to the priest;26 	the priest is to effect-purgation for him, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	and he shall be granted-pardon,<br>	for [whichever] one of all [the things] that he may have done to incur-guilt thereby.6:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:2 	Command Aharon and his sons, saying:<br>	This is the Instruction [regarding] the offering-up—<br>	that is what goes-up on the blazing-hearth on the altar all night, until daybreak,<br>	while the fire of the altar is kept blazing on it:3 	the priest is to clothe himself in his wide-raiment of linen,<br>	with breeches of linen he is to clothe himself, over his “flesh”;<br>	he is to set-aside the ashes from which the fire has consumed the offering-up on the altar,<br>	and is to put them beside the altar.4 	Then he is to strip off his garments and clothe himself in other garments,<br>	and he is to bring the ashes outside the camp, to a ritually-pure place.5 	Now the fire on the altar is to be kept-blazing upon it—it must not go out!—<br>	and the priest is to stoke on it [pieces-of-]wood, in the morning, [every] morning,<br>	and he is to arrange on it the offering-up,<br>	and is to turn into smoke on it the fat-parts of the <i>shalom</i>-offerings.6 	A regular fire is to be kept-blazing on the altar—it is not to go out!7 @ 	Now this is the Instruction [regarding] the grain-gift:<br>	Aharon’s sons must bring it near, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	in front of the altar.8 	There shall be set-aside from it, by the handful, some of the flour of the grain-gift and some of its oil, with all the frankincense that is on the grain-gift,<br>	and it is to be turned into smoke on the altar, as a soothing savor, as its reminder-portion to <sc>Yhwh</sc>.9 	What is left of it, Aharon and his sons are to eat;<br>	unleavened it is to be eaten, in a holy place,<br>	in the courtyard of the Tent of Appointment they are to eat it.10 	It is not to be baked with leaven;<br>	as their portion I have given it from my fire-offerings<br>	—it is a holiest holy-portion, like the <i>hattat</i>-offering and like the <i>asham</i>-offering.11 	Any male among the Children of Aharon may eat it,<br>	[as] an allotment for the ages, throughout your generations, from the fire-offerings of <sc>Yhwh</sc>;<br>	whatever touches it becomes holy [property].12 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:13 	This is the near-offering of Aharon and his sons that they are to bring near to <sc>Yhwh</sc> at the time of his being anointed:<br>	a tenth-measure of an <i>efa</i> of flour as a regular grain-gift, half of it at daybreak and half of it at sunset.14 	On a griddle, with oil, it is to be made,<br>	well-stirred are you to bring it,<br>	as baked crumbled-bits of grain you are to bring-it-near,<br>	a soothing savor for <sc>Yhwh</sc>.15 	Thus shall the priest anointed in his stead, from [among] his sons, make it,<br>	a law for the ages, for <sc>Yhwh</sc>:<br>	completely it is to be turned into smoke.16 	And every grain-gift of a priest, completely-offered shall it be;<br>	it is not to be eaten.17 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:18 	Speak to Aharon and to his sons, saying:<br>	This is the Instruction [regarding] the <i>hattat</i>-offering<i>:</i><br>	in the place where the offering-up is slaughtered, the <i>hattat</i> is to be slaughtered,<br>	before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>&mdash;<br>	it is a holiest holy-portion.19 	The priest who sacrifices-the-<i>hattat</i>-offering is to eat of it;<br>	in a holy place it is to be eaten, in the courtyard of the Tent of Appointment.20 	Whatever touches its flesh becomes holy [property].<br>	And if some of its blood is spattered on a garment,<br>	[the spot] on which it is spattered is to be scrubbed in a holy place.21 	Now a vessel of earthenware in which it was boiled is to be broken;<br>	if [it was] in a copper vessel that it was boiled, it is to be scoured and rinsed with water.22 	Any male among the priests may eat it&mdash;<br>	it is a holiest holy-portion.23 	But any <i>hattat</i>-offering from whose blood is brought to the Tent of Appointment, to effect-purgation in the Holy-Shrine, shall not be eaten;<br>	in fire it is to be burned.7:1 @ 	Now this is the Instruction [regarding] the <i>asham</i>-offering:<br>	it is a holiest holy-portion.2 	In the place where they slaughter the offering-up, they are to slaughter the <i>asham</i>-offering,<br>	and its blood is to be dashed against the altar, all around.3 	Now from all its fat is to be brought near:<br>	the thick tail and the fat that covers the innards,4 	the two kidneys and the fat that is about them [and] that is on the tendons,<br>	and the extension on the liver, along with the kidneys is to be removed.5 	The priest is to turn them into smoke upon the altar, a fire-offering to <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	it is an <i>asham</i>-offering.6 	Any male among the priests may eat it,<br>	in a holy place it is to be eaten&mdash;<br>	it is a holiest holy-portion!7 	Like the <i>hattat</i>-offering, so the <i>asham</i>-offering—<br>	one Instruction for them;<br>	the priest who effects-purgation through it, his shall it be.8 	And the priest who brings-near the offering-up of a [lay]man,<br>	the skin of the offering-up that he brings-near is for the priest—his shall it be.9 	And any grain-gift that is baked in an oven, and any that is prepared in a frying pan or on a griddle,<br>	for the priest that brings-it-near—his shall it be.10 	But any grain-gift mixed with oil, or dry,<br>	for any of the Sons of Aharon shall it be, each one like his brother.11 @ 	Now this is the Instruction [regarding] the sacrifice of <i>shalom</i> that is brought-near for <sc>Yhwh</sc>:12 	if [it is] on account of thanksgiving that he brings-it-near,<br>	he is to bring-near along with the sacrifice of thanksgiving:<br>	<i>matza</i> cakes, mixed with oil, <i>matza</i> wafers smeared with oil,<br>	and flour well-stirred into cakes, mixed with oil.13 	Along with cakes of leavened bread he is to bring-near his near-offering,<br>	along with his thanksgiving sacrifice of <i>shalom</i>.14 	He is to bring near from it one of each [kind of] near-offering as a contribution for <sc>Yhwh</sc>;<br>	[it is] for the priest who dashes the blood of the <i>shalom</i>-offering—his shall it be.15 	As for the flesh of his thanksgiving sacrifice of <i>shalom,<br>	at the time of his bringing it near it is to be eaten,<br>	he may not leave [any] of it until morning.16 @ 	Now if a vow-offering or a freewill-offering is his sacrificed near-offering,<br>	at the time of his bringing near his sacrifice it is to be eaten;<br>	on the morrow, what is left of it may be eaten.17 	And what is left of the flesh of the sacrifice—<br>	on the third day, in fire it is to be burned.18 	Now should there be eaten, yes, eaten any of the flesh of his sacrifice of <i>shalom</i> on the third day, it is not acceptable [for] him that brings it near, it will not be reckoned to him.<br>	Tainted-meat shall it be [considered],<br>	and the person who eats of it—his iniquity he shall bear!19 	Flesh that touches anything <i>tamei</i> is not to be eaten, in fire it is to be burned.<br>	As for [other] flesh: anyone ritually-pure may eat the flesh.20 	But the person who eats flesh from the sacrifice of <i>shalom</i> that is <sc>Yhwh’s</sc><br>	while his <i>tum’a</i> is upon him,<br>	cut-off shall that person be from his kinspeople!21 	And a person—when he touches anything <i>tamei,</i> human <i>tum’a</i> or a <i>tamei</i> animal or any <i>tamei</i> detestable-creature,<br>	and eats from the flesh of the sacrifice of <i>shalom</i> that is <sc>Yhwh’s</sc>,<br>	cut off shall that person be from his kinspeople!22 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:23 	Speak to the Children of Israel, saying:<br>	Any fat of an ox or a lamb or a goat, you are not to eat.24 	Now fat from a carcass, fat from a torn-animal may be used for any work-purpose,<br>	but eating—you are not to eat it!25 	For whoever eats fat from an animal from which a fire-offering may be brought-near for <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	cut-off shall the person be that eats [thus], from his kinspeople!26 	And any blood you are not to eat throughout all your settlements, [either] of a bird or of a domestic-animal.27 	Any person that eats any blood—<br>	cut-off shall that person be from his kinspeople!28 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:29 	Speak to the Children of Israel, saying:<br>	He who brings near his sacrifice of <i>shalom</i> for <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	is to bring his near-offering [himself] to <sc>Yhwh</sc>, from his sacrifice of <i>shalom;</i>30 	his [own] hands are to bring the fire-offerings for <sc>Yhwh</sc>.<br>	The fat—along with the breast he is to bring it,<br>	the breast for elevating it as an elevation-offering, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.31 	And the priest is to turn the fat into smoke upon the altar.<br>	And the breast is to be Aharon’s and his sons’.32 	Now the right thigh you are to give as a contribution to the priest, from your sacrifices of <i>shalom</i>.33 	He who brings near the blood of the <i>shalom</i>-offerings and the fat, from among the Sons of Aharon—his shall it be,<br>	the right thigh as a portion.34 	For the breast of the elevation-offering and the thigh of the contribution, I take from the Children of Israel, from their sacrifices of <i>shalom,</i><br>	and I give them to Aharon the priest and to his sons, as an allotment for the ages, from the Children of Israel.35 @ 	This is the anointed-share of Aharon and the anointed-share of his sons from the fire-offerings of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	from the time he brought them near to be-priests for <sc>Yhwh</sc>,36 	which <sc>Yhwh</sc> commanded to be given them from the time of his anointing them, from the Children of Israel—<br>	as a law for the ages, throughout their generations.37 @ 	This is the Instruction<br>	concerning the offering-up, concerning the grain-gift,<br>	concerning the <i>hattat</i>-offering and concerning the <i>asham</i>-offering,<br>	concerning the mandate-offering and concerning the sacrifice of <i>shalom</i>38 	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> commanded Moshe at Mount Sinai<br>	at the time of his commanding the Children of Israel to bring near their near-offerings to <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	in the wilderness of Sinai.8:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:2 	Take Aharon and his sons with him,<br>	the garments and the oil for anointing,<br>	the bull for the <i>hattat</i>-offering, the two rams and the basket of <i>matzot</i>;3 	and the entire community, assemble at the entrance to the Tent of Appointment.4 	Moshe did as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded him;<br>	the community assembled at the entrance to the Tent of Appointment.5 	Then Moshe said to the community:<br>	This is the thing that God has commanded to be done.6 	Moshe brought near Aharon and his sons<br>	and washed them with water;7 	he put on him the robe,<br>	he girded him with the sash,<br>	he clothed him in the tunic,<br>	he put on him the <i>efod</i>-vest,<br>	he girded him with the designed-band of the <i>efod,</i> and invested him in it,8 	he placed on him the breastpiece,<br>	he put into the breastpiece the <i>Urim</i> and the <i>Tummim,</i>9 	he placed the turban on his head,<br>	he placed on the turban, in front of his face, the plate of gold, the sacred-diadem of holiness,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe.10 	Then Moshe took the oil for anointing and anointed the dwelling and all that was in it,<br>	making-them-holy.11 	He sprinkled some of it on the altar, seven times,<br>	and anointed the altar, all its vessels, the basin and its pedestal,<br>	to make-them-holy.12 	He poured some of the oil for anointing on the head of Aharon, anointing him,<br>	to make-him-holy.13 	Then Moshe brought near the sons of Aharon,<br>	he clothed them in tunics,<br>	he girded them with sash[es],<br>	and wound them caps,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe.14 	He brought forward the bull of the <i>hattat</i>-offering,<br>	and Aharon and his sons leaned their hands upon the head of the bull of the <i>hattat</i>-offering,15 	and it was slaughtered.<br>	Moshe took the blood<br>	and put it on the horns of the altar, all around, with his finger, and [thus] decontaminated the altar;<br>	while the blood he poured out at the foundation of the altar.<br>	So he made-it-holy, for effecting-purgation upon it.16 	Then he took all the fat that is about the innards,<br>	the extension of the liver, the two kidneys and their fat,<br>	and Moshe turned [them] into smoke upon the altar.17 	The [rest of the] bull, its skin, its flesh and its dung,<br>	he burned in fire, outside the camp,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe.18 	Then he broughtnear the ram for the offering-up;<br>	Aharon and his sons leaned their hands upon the head of the ram,19 	and it was slaughtered.<br>	Moshe dashed the blood against the altar, all around.20 	Then the ram he sectioned into its sections,<br>	and Moshe turned into smoke the head, the sections and the suet.21 	Now the innards and the shins he washed in water,<br>	and Moshe turned the entire ram into smoke upon the altar.<br>	It [was] an offering-up, for a soothing savor,<br>	it [was] a fire-offering for <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe.22 	Then he brought near the second ram, the ram for giving-mandate.<br>	Aharon and his sons leaned their hands on the head of the ram.23 	and it was slaughtered.<br>	And Moshe took some of its blood and put it on the ridge of the right ear of Aharon, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the thumb-toe of his right foot.24 	Then he brought near the sons of Aharon,<br>	and Moshe put some of the blood on the ridge of their right ear, on the thumb of their right hand, and on the thumb-toe of their right foot;<br>	then Moshe dashed the blood on the altar, all around.25 	He took the fat—the broad-tail and all the fat that is about the innards,<br>	the extension of the liver, the two kidneys and their fat, and the right thigh;26 	and from the basket of <i>matzot</i> that was before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	he took one cake of <i>matza</i> and one cake of oil bread, and one wafer<br>	and put [them] on the fat-parts and on the right thigh.27 	He placed all [of them] on the palms of Aharon and on the palms of his sons,<br>	and they elevated them as an elevation-offering, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.28 	Then Moshe took them from their palms<br>	and turned them into smoke upon the altar, along with the offering-up.<br>	They are mandate-offerings, for a soothing savor&mdash;<br>	it is a fire-offering for <sc>Yhwh</sc>.29 	Then Moshe took the breast and elevated it as an elevation-offering, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	from the ram of mandating—for Moshe it was a portion,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe.30 @ 	Now Moshe took some of the oil for anointing and some of the blood that was on the altar<br>	and sprinkled [it] on Aharon, on his garments, on his sons and on the garments of his sons with him;<br>	[thus] he made-holy Aharon, his garments, his sons and the garments of his sons with him.31 	Moshe said to Aharon and to his sons:<br>	Boil the flesh at the entrance to the Tent of Appointment;<br>	there you are to eat it, along with the bread that is in the basket of mandating,<br>	as I have commanded, saying: Aharon and his sons are to eat it!32 	What is left of the flesh and of the bread, in fire you are to burn [it].33 	Now from the entrance to the Tent of Appointment you are not to go out, for seven days,<br>	until the time of fulfilling the days of full-mandating.<br>	For seven days [it takes] to fill your hands [in mandating].34 	As has been done this day, <sc>Yhwh</sc> commanded to be done, to effect-purgation for you.35 	At the entrance to the Tent of Appointment you are to stay, day and night, for seven days;<br>	you are to keep the charge of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, so that you do not die,<br>	for thus I have been commanded.36 	And Aharon and his sons did all the things that <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded by the hand of Moshe.9:1 @ 	Now it was on the eighth day:<br>	Moshe called Aharon and his sons and the elders of Israel,2 	and he said to Aharon:<br>	Take yourself a calf, a young of the herd, as a <i>hattat</i>-offerings, and a ram as an offering-up, wholly-sound,<br>	and bring-them-near, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.3 	And to the Children of Israel you are to speak, saying:<br>	Take a hairy-one of goats as a <i>hattat</i>-offering<br>	and a calf and a lamb, year-old ones, wholly-sound, as an offering-up,4 	and an ox and a ram as a <i>shalom</i>-offering,<br>	to sacrifice before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	and a grain-gift mixed with oil;<br>	for today, <sc>Yhwh</sc> will make-himself-seen by you!5 	So they took what Moshe had commanded, to the front of the Tent of Appointment,<br>	and the entire community came near and stood before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.6 	And Moshe said:<br>	This is the word that <sc>Yhwh</sc> has commanded [that] you do,<br>	that the Glory of <sc>Yhwh</sc> may be seen by you!7 	And Moshe said to Aharon:<br>	Come-near to the altar and make your <i>hattat</i>-offering and your offering-up,<br>	effecting-atonement on behalf of yourself and on behalf of the people,<br>	and make the near-offering of the people, effecting-atonement on their behalf,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> has commanded.8 	So Aharon came-near to the altar<br>	and slaughtered the calf for the <i>hattat</i>-offering that was his.9 	Then the sons of Aharon brought-near the blood to him,<br>	he dipped his finger in the blood and placed [it] on the horns of the altar.<br>	The [remaining] blood he poured out at the foundation of the altar.10 	Now the fat and the kidneys and the extension from the liver, from the <i>hattat</i>-offering,<br>	he turned into smoke upon the altar,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe;11 	the flesh and the skin he burned in fire, outside the camp.12 	Then he slaughtered the offering-up,<br>	and the sons of Aharon handed the blood to him, and he dashed it against the altar, all around.13 	The offering-up they handed to him in its sections, as well as the head,<br>	and he turned [them] into smoke on the altar.14 	He washed the innards and the shins,<br>	and turned [them] into smoke, along with the offering-up, upon the altar.15 	Then he brought near the near-offering of the people.<br>	He took the hairy-goat for the <i>hattat</i>-offering that was the people’s;<br>	he slaughtered it, and performed-the-<i>hattat</i>-offering, like the first-one.16 	Then he brought near the offering-up, and made it according to regulation.17 	Then he brought near the grain-gift, and filled his palm with some of it;<br>	and he turned it into smoke upon the altar—aside from the morning offering-up.18 	Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram of the sacrifice of <i>shalom</i> that was the people’s;<br>	the sons of Aharon handed the blood to him,<br>	and he dashed it against the altar, all around,19 	along with the fat-parts of the ox and of the ram:<br>	the broad-tail and what covers the kidneys, and the extension of the liver.20 	They put the fat-parts over the breasts<br>	and he turned the fat-parts into smoke upon the altar;21 	the breasts and the right thigh, Aharon elevated as an elevation-offering, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	as he had commanded Moshe.22 	And Aharon lifted his hands toward the people, and he blessed them;<br>	then he came down from making the <i>hattat</i>-offering, the offering-up and the <i>shalom</i>-offering.23 	Now Moshe and Aharon had entered the Tent of Appointment;<br>	they came out and they blessed the people,<br>	and the Glory of <sc>Yhwh</sc> was seen by the entire people.24 	And fire went out from the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	and consumed, on the altar, the offering-up and the fat-parts;<br>	all the people saw, and they shouted and flung themselves on their faces.10:1 @ 	Aharon’s sons, Nadav and Avihu, took each one his pan,<br>	placed fire in them, put smoking-incense on it,<br>	and brought near, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, outside fire,<br>	such as he had not commanded them.2 	And fire went out from the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	and consumed them, so that they died, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.3 	Moshe said to Aharon:<br>	It is what <sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke [about], saying:<br>	Through those permitted-near to me, I will be-proven-holy,<br>	before all the people, I will be-accorded-honor!<br>	Aharon was silent.4 @ 	Now Moshe called Mishael and Eltzafan, the sons of Uzziel uncle of Aharon,<br>	and said to them:<br>	Come near, carry your brothers from in front of the Holy-Shrine to beyond the camp.5 	They came near and carried them, by their tunics, beyond the camp,<br>	as Moshe had spoken.6 	Now Moshe said to Aharon and to Elazar and Itamar his sons:<br>	Your heads, do not bare,<br>	your garments, you are not to tear,<br>	so that you do not die<br>	and he be furious with the entire community!<br>	Your brothers, the entire House of Israel, are to weep over the burning that <sc>Yhwh</sc> caused-to-burn.7 	And from the entrance to the Tent of Appointment, do not go out, lest you die,<br>	for the oil of anointing of <sc>Yhwh</sc> is upon you!<br>	They did according to the word of Moshe.8 	Now <sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Aharon, saying:9 	Wine and beer, do not drink, you and your sons with you,<br>	when you enter the Tent of Appointment,<br>	so that you do not die—<br>	a law for the ages, throughout your generations:10 	and so that there be-separation between the holy and the profane, between the <i>tamei</i> and the pure,11 	and so that [you] might instruct the Children of Israel in all the laws that <sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to them through the hand of Moshe.12 @ 	Moshe spoke to Aharon and to Elazar and to Itamar, his sons that were left:<br>	Take the grain-gift that is left of the fire-offerings of <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	and eat it unleavened next to the altar,<br>	for it is a holiest holy-portion.13 	You are to eat it in a holy place,<br>	for it is for your allotment and your sons’ allotment, from the fire-offerings of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	for thus have I been commanded.14 	But the breast of the elevation-offering and the thigh of the contribution, you may eat in [any] pure place, you and your sons and your daughters with you,<br>	for as your allotment and your children’s allotment they have been given [you], from the sacrifices of <i>shalom</i> of the Children of Israel.15 	The thigh of the contribution and the breast of the elevation-offering, along with the gifts of the fat-parts, they are to bring to elevate as an elevation-offering before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>;<br>	it is to be for you and for your sons with you as an allotment for the ages,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> has commanded.16 @ 	Now about the hairy-goat of <i>hattat</i> Moshe inquired, yes, inquired, and here: it had been burned!<br>	And he became furious at Elazar and Itamar, the sons of Aharon that were left, saying:17 	For-what-reason did you not eat the <i>hattat</i>-offering in the place of the Holy-Shrine?<br>	For it is a holiest holy-portion,<br>	and he has given it to you to bear the iniquity of the community, to effect-purgation for them, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.18 	Here, its blood was not brought into the Holy-Shrine, inside;<br>	you should have eaten, yes, eaten it in the Holy-Shrine, as I commanded!19 	But Aharon said to Moshe:<br>	Here, today they brought-near their <i>hattat</i>-offering and their offering-up, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	and such [things] as these have happened to me!<br>	Had I eaten the <i>hattat</i>-offering today, would it have been good in the eyes of <sc>Yhwh</sc>?20 	Moshe hearkened, and it was good in his eyes.11:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe and to Aharon, saying to them:2 	Speak to the Children of Israel, saying:<br>	These are the living-creatures that you may eat, from all the domestic-animals that are upon the earth:3 	any one having a hoof, cleaving a cleft in [its] hooves,<br>	bringing up the cud, among the animals—<br>	that-one you may eat.4 	However, these you are not to eat<br>	from those bringing up the cud, or from those having a hoof:<br>	the camel, for it brings up the cud, but a hoof it does not have,<br>	it is <i>tamei</i> for you;5 	the hyrax, for it brings up the cud, but a hoof it does not have,<br>	it is <i>tamei</i> for you;6 	the hare, for it brings up the cud, but a hoof it does not have,<br>	it is <i>tamei</i> for you;7 	the pig, for it has a hoof and cleaves a cleft in the hoof, but [as for] it—the cud it does not chew up,<br>	it is <i>tamei</i> for you.8 	From their flesh you are not to eat, their carcasses you are not to touch,<br>	they are <i>tamei</i> for you!9 @ 	These you may eat from all that are in the water:<br>	any one that has fins and scales in the water, [whether] in the seas or in the streams,<br>	them you may eat.10 	But any one that does not have fins and scales,<br>	[whether] in the seas or in the streams,<br>	from all swarming-things in the water, from all living beings that are in the water—<br>	they are detestable-things for you!11 	And they shall remain detestable-things for you:<br>	from their flesh you are not to eat, their carcasses you are to detest.12 	Any one that does not have fins and scales in the water—<br>	it is a detestable-thing for you!13 @ 	Now these you are to hold-detestable from birds<br>	—they are not to be eaten, they are detestable-things:<br>	the eagle, the bearded-vulture and the black-vulture,14 	the kite and the falcon after its kind,15 	every [sort of] raven after its kind;16 	the desert owl, the screech owl and the sea gull,<br>	and the falcon after its kind;17 	the little-owl, the cormorant, and the great owl;18 	the barn-owl, the pelican, and the Egyptian-vulture;19 	the stork, the heron after to its kind,<br>	the hoopoe and the bat.20 	Any flying swarming-creature that goes about on all fours—<br>	it is a detestable-thing for you!21 	However, these you may eat from any flying swarming-creature that goes about on all fours:<br>	[those] that have jointed-legs above their feet, with which to leap on the earth;22 	as for these, from them you may eat:<br>	the locust afterits kind, the bald-locust after its kind;<br>	the cricket after its kind, the grasshopper after its kind.23 	But every [other] flying swarming-creature that has four legs,<br>	it is a detestable-thing for you!24 @ 	Now from these you can become <i>tamei</i><br>	—whoever touches their carcass shall be <i>tamei</i> until sunset,25 	whoever carries [any part] of their carcass is to

monitor and the lizard,<br>	the sand-lizard and the chameleon.31 	These are the ones <i>tamei</i> for you among all the swarming-creatures;<br>	whoever touches them when they are dead shall be <i>tamei</i> until sunset,32 	anything upon which one of them should fall when they are dead shall be <i>tamei</i>,<br>	whether any vessel of wood or cloth or skin or sackcloth<br>	—any vessel that can be used in work—<br>	it is to be put through water;<br>	it remains-<i>tamei</i> until sunset,<br>	and then it is pure.33 	And [regarding] any earthen vessel into which one of them falls, within it,<br>	everything within it shall be <i>tamei,</i><br>	and it—you are to break [it]!34 	As for any food that might be eaten,<br>	should water come in [contact with] it, it shall be

touches their carcass shall be <i>tamei</i>.37 	Now if [part] of their carcass falls upon any sowing seed that is to be sown,<br>	it remains-pure.38 	But if water is put on the seed and [part] of their carcass falls on it,<br>	it is <i>tamei</i> for you.39 	If there should die one of the animals that are [permitted] to you for eating,<br>	one who touches its carcass shall remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset.40 	And one who eats from its carcass is to scrub his garments, and remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset,<br>	and one who carries its carcass is to scrub his garments, and remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset.41 @ 	Any swarming-creature that swarms upon the earth:<br>	it is a detestable-thing, it is not to be eaten.42 	Anything going about on its belly, anything going about on all fours, up to anything with many legs, among all swarming-creatures that swarm upon the earth:<br>	you are not to eat them,<br>	for they are detestable-things!43 	Do not make yourselves detestable through any swarming-thing that swarms;<br>	you are not to make yourselves <i>tamei</i> through them, and so become <i>tamei</i> through them!44 	For I am <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God:<br>	you

you are not to eat.12:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:2 	Speak to the Children of Israel, saying:<br>	A woman—when she produces-seed and bears a male,<br>	she remains-<i>tamei</i> for seven days;<br>	like the days of her infirmity of discharge she shall remain-<i>tamei;</i>3 	and on the eighth day, the flesh of his foreskin is to be circumcised.4 	For thirty days and three days she is to stay in her period of blood purification;<br>	any holy-thing she is not to touch, the Holy-Area she is not to enter,<br>	until the fulfilling of the days of her purification.5 	Now if [it is] a female [that] she bears,<br>	she remains-<i>tamei</i> for two-weeks, like her [time of] discharge;<br>	and for sixty days and six days she is to stay for [a period of] blood purification.6 	And at the fulfilling of the days of her purification, for a son or for a daughter,<br>	she is to bring a lamb, in its [first] year, as an offering-up,<br>	and a young pigeon or a turtledove, as a <i>hattat</i>-offering,<br>	to the entrance of the Tent of Appointment, to the priest.7 	He is to bring it near, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, and is to effect-purgation for her,<br>	and she will be purified from her source of blood.<br>	This is the Instruction [regarding] one giving-birth, [whether] to a male or to a female.8 	But if her hand does not find enough [means] for a sheep,<br>	she is to take two turtledoves or two young pigeons,<br>	one for an offering-up and one for a <i>hattat</i>-offering;<br>	when the priest effects-purgation for her,<br>	then she is pure.13:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe and to Aharon, saying:2 	[Any] person—when there is on the skin of his body a swelling or a scab or a shiny-spot<br>	and it becomes on the skin of his body an affliction of <i>tzaraat,</i><br>	he is to be brought to Aharon the priest or to one of his sons the priests.3 	The priest is to look at the affliction on the skin of the flesh;<br>	should hair in the afflicted-area have turned white, and the look of the affliction is deeper than the skin of his flesh,<br>	it is an affliction of <i>tzaraat;</i><br>	the priest is to look at it, and is to declare-him-<i>tamei</i>.4 	Now if it is a white spot on the skin of his flesh, and deeper its look is not than the skin,<br>	and the hair has not turned white,<br>	the priest is to shut up the afflicted-one for seven days.5 	The priest is to look at him on the seventh day,<br>	and here, should the affliction be at a standstill in his eyes,<br>	—the affliction not spread on the skin—<br>	the priest is to shut him up for seven days a second time.6 	The priest is to look at him on the seventh day a second time,<br>	and here, should the affliction have faded, and the affliction has not spread on the skin,<br>	the priest is to declare-him-pure<br>	—it is [only] a scab—<br>	when he scrubs his garments, he is pure.7 	But if the scab has spread, yes, spread on the skin<br>	after he has had the priest look at him, for declaring-him-pure,<br>	he is to have the priest look at him a second time.8 	The priest is to look, and here, should the scab have spread on the skin,<br>	the priest is to declare-him-<i>tamei&mdash;</i><br>	it is <i>tzaraat!</i>9 @ 	An affliction of <i>tzaraat</i>—when it shows on a human-being, and he is brought to the priest,10 	and the priest looks, and here, a white swelling is on the skin, and it has turned into white hair,<br>	with a live-patch of “live” flesh in the swelling:11 	it is mature <i>tzaraat</i> in the skin of his body,<br>	and the priest is to declare-him-<i>tamei;</i><br>	he is not to shut him up, for he is <i>tamei</i>.12 	Now if the <i>tzaraat</i> sprouts, yes, sprouts on the skin<br>	so that the <i>tzaraat</i> covers all the skin of the afflicted-one, from his head to his feet,<br>	wherever the priest’s eyes look:13 	the priest is to look, and here, should the <i>tzaraat</i> have covered all his flesh,<br>	he is to declare the afflicted-one pure<br>	—all of it has turned white,<br>	and he is pure!14 	But at the time of there reappearing on him live flesh, he is to be considered-<i>tamei</i>.15 	When the priest looks at the live flesh, he is to declare-him-<i>tamei;</i><br>	the live flesh—it is <i>tamei</i>, it is <i>tzaraat</i>.16 	Or when the live flesh recurs and turns back to white,<br>	he is to come to the priest;17 	the priest is to look at it, and here, should the affliction have turned back to white,<br>	the priest is to declare the afflicted one pure&mdash;<br>	he is pure.18 @ 	Now flesh—when there is in its skin a boil, and it heals,19 	but there is in place of the boil a white swelling or a white [and] reddish shiny-spot:<br>	he is to have the priest look at him.20 	The priest is to look, and here, should its look be lower than the skin,<br>	and its hair has turned white,<br>	the priest is to declare-him-<i>tamei;</i><br>	it is an affliction of <i>tzaraat</i>, in the boil it has sprouted.21 	But if the priest looks at it, and here, there is not in it any white hair,<br>	and it is not lower than the skin, but it has faded,<br>	the priest is to shut him up for seven days.22 	Now if it should spread, yes, spread on the skin,<br>	the priest is to declare-him-<i>tamei</i>—<br>	it is an affliction.23 	But if, under it, the affliction is at-a-standstill, not having spread,<br>	it is the inflammation of the boil;<br>	the priest is to declare-him-pure.24 @ 	Or flesh—when there is on the skin a burn by fire<br>	and on the live-patch of the burn is a shiny-spot, white [and] reddish, or white,25 	and the priest looks at it, and here, hair has turned white in the shiny-spot,<br>	and its look is deeper than the skin,<br>	it is <i>tzaraat</i>, in the burn it has sprouted;<br>	the priest is to declare-him-<i>tamei</i>—<br>	it is an affliction of <i>tzaraat!</i>26 	But if the priest looks at it, and here, there is not in the bright-spot any white hair, and lower it is not than the skin, and it has faded,<br>	the priest is to shut him up for seven days.27 	Then the priest is to look at him on the seventh day:<br>	if it has spread, yes, spread on the skin, the priest is to declare-him-<i>tamei</i>—<br>	it is an affliction of <i>tzaraat</i>.28 	But if, under it, the shiny-spot is at-a-standstill&mdash;it has not spread on the skin, and it has faded&mdash;<br>	it is a swelling from the burn;<br>	the priest is to declare-him-pure,<br>	for it is an inflammation from the burn.29 @ 	Now a man or a woman—when they have an affliction on the head or on the [site of the] beard:30 	and the priest looks at the affliction, and here, its look is deeper than the skin,<br>	and in it there is thin yellow hair,<br>	the priest is to declare-him-<i>tamei</i>—<br>	it is a scall, it is <i>tzaraat</i> of the head or of the beard.31 	But when the priest looks at the affliction of the scall, and here, its look is not deeper than the skin,<br>	and black hair there is none on it,<br>	the priest is to shut up the one afflicted with the scall for seven days.32 	Then the priest is to look at the affliction on the seventh day, and here, should the scall not have spread, and there is not in it [any] yellow hair,<br>	and the look of the scall is not deeper than the skin,33 	he is to shave himself,<br>	but the scall he is not to shave,<br>	and the priest is to shut up the scall-bearer for seven days a second time.34 	Then the priest is to look at the scall on the seventh day, and here, should the scall not have spread on the skin,<br>	and its look is not deeper than the skin,<br>	the priest is to declare-him-pure;<br>	he is to scrub his garments, and then he is pure.35 	But if the scall has spread, yes, spread on the skin, after his being-purified,36 	and the priest looks at him, and here, the scall has spread on the skin,<br>	the priest need not examine [him] for the yellow hair;<br>	he is <i>tamei</i>.37 	Now if in his eyes the scall is at-a-standstill, and black hair has sprouted in it,<br>	the scall has healed,<br>	he is pure,<br>	and the priest is to declare-him-pure.38 @ 	Now a man or a woman—<br>	when there is in the skin of their flesh shiny-spots, white shiny-spots,39 	and the priest looks, and here, in the skin of their flesh [are] shiny-spots, faded [or] white,<br>	it is a rash, it has sprouted on the skin,<br>	he is pure.40 @ 	Now a man—when his head becomes smooth, he is bald,<br>	he is pure.41 	And if on the edge of his face his head becomes smooth, he is forehead-bald;<br>	he is [still] pure.42 	But when there is on the bald spot or on the forehead an affliction, white [and] reddish,<br>	it is sprouting <i>tzaraat</i>, on his bald spot or on his forehead.43 	The priest is to look at him, and here, [if] the swelling of the affliction is white [and] reddish, on his bald spot or on his forehead,<br>	like the look of <i>tzaraat</i> on the skin of flesh:44 	he is a man with <i>tzaraat</i>, he is <i>tamei</i>;<br>	[yes], <i>tamei</i>, <i>tamei</i> shall the priest [declare] him, on his head is his affliction.45 	Now the one with <i>tzaraat</i> that has the affliction,<br>	his garments are to be torn,<br>	his head is to be made-bare,<br>	and his upper-lip is to be covered;<br>	<i>Tamei! Tamei!</i> he is to cry out.46 	All the days that the affliction is on him, he shall remain-<i>tamei;</i><br>	<i>tamei</i> is he,<br>	alone shall he stay, outside of the camp is his staying-place.47 @ 	Now a cloth:<br>	when there is on it an affliction of <i>tzaraat,</i><br>	on a cloth of wool or a cloth of linen,48 	or in the woof or in the warp of the linen or of the wool,<br>	or in an animal-skin or in anything worked of skin:49 	if the affliction is greenish or reddish on the cloth or the skin, or on the woof or on the warp, or in any vessel of skin,<br>	it is an affliction of <i>tzaraat,</i><br>	and he is to have the priest look at it.50 	[When] the priest looks at the affliction,<br>	he is to shut up the afflicted-item for seven days;51 	he is to look at the affliction on the seventh day;<br>	if the affliction has spread on the cloth or on the woof or on the warp or on the skin,<br>	for whatever might be done with the skin for work:<br>	the affliction is acute <i>tzaraat,</i><br>	it is <i>tamei</i>.52 	It is to be burned, the cloth, or the woof or the warp in the wool or in the linen, or in any vessel of skin that has in it any affliction,<br>	for it is acute <i>tzaraat,</i> in fire it is to be burned.53 	But if the priest looks, and here, the affliction has not spread in the cloth<br>	—whether in the woof or in the warp, or in any vessel of skin—54 	the priest is to command that they scrub that which contains the affliction,<br>	and he is to shut it up for seven days a second time.55 	The priest is to look, after the afflicted-thing has been scrubbed, and here,<br>	should the affliction not have changed its aspect, the affliction not have spread—<br>	it is <i>tamei,</i> in fire you are to burn it;<br>	it is decay, on its “bald-spot” or on its “forehead.”56 	But if the priest looks, and here, the affliction has faded, after it has been scrubbed,<br>	he is to tear it from the cloth or from the skin or from the woof or from the warp,57 	and if it is seen again on the cloth—whether in the woof or in the warp, or in any vessel of skin,<br>	it is a sprouting-thing, in fire you are to burn it, anything in which there is the affliction.58 	But the cloth or the woof or the warp or any vessel of skin that you have scrubbed, so that the affliction disappears from them,<br>	when it is scrubbed a second time,<br>	then it is pure.59 @ 	This is the Instruction [regarding] the affliction of <i>tzaraat</i> in cloth of wool or linen, or the warp or the woof, or any vessel of skin,<br>	for declaring-it-purified or for declaring-it-<i>tamei</i>.14:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:2 	This is to be the Instruction [regarding] the one-with-<i>tzaraat,</i> at the time of his being purified:<br>	he is to be brought to the priest.3 	The priest is to go outside the camp;<br>	the priest is to look, and here, should the affliction of <i>tzaraat</i> have healed on the one-with-<i>tzaraat,</i>4 	the priest is to command that they take for the one-to-be-purified two birds, live, pure,<br>	and wood of cedar and scarlet of the worm and hyssop.5 	Then the priest is to command that they slaughter the one bird<br>	in an earthen vessel, [held] above living water,6 	and the live bird—he is to take it, and the cedar wood, the scarlet of the worm and the hyssop,<br>	and is to dip them and the live bird in the blood of the slaughtered bird, [held] above living water.7 	Then he is to sprinkle [it] over the one-to-be-purified of <i>tzaraat</i> seven times, and declare-him-pure,<br>	and is to send out the live bird into the open field.8 	The one-being-purified is to scrub his garments, shave his entire [head of] hair and wash in water,<br>	then he is pure;<br>	afterward he may enter the camp,<br>	and stay outside his tent for seven days.9 	And it shall be on the seventh day: he is to shave all his hair—his head, his beard and his eyebrows,<br>	all his body-hair he is to shave—<br>	and scrub his garments and wash his flesh in water,<br>	then he is pure.10 	On the eighth day he is to take two lambs, wholly-sound, and one lamb in its [first] year, wholly-sound,<br>	and three tenth-measures of flour as a grain-gift, mixed with oil, and one <i>log</i> of oil.11 	The priest making-purification is to stand the man to-be-purified and them<br>	before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, at the entrance to the Tent of Appointment;12 	the priest is to take the one lamb and is to bring it near as an <i>asham</i>-offering, with the <i>log</i> of oil,<br>	and is to elevate them as an elevation-offering, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.13 	Then he is to slaughter the lamb in the place where one slaughters the <i>hattat</i>-offering and the offering-up,<br>	in a holy place,<br>	for like the <i>hattat</i>-offering, the <i>asham</i>-offering is the priest’s,<br>	it is a holiest holy-portion.14 	Then the priest is to take some of the blood of the <i>asham</i><br>	and the priest is to place it on the ridge of the right ear of the one-being-purified, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the thumb-toe of his right foot.15 	And the priest is to take some of the <i>log</i> of oil and is to pour it on the left palm of the priest.16 	Then the priest is to dip his right finger in some of the oil that is on his left palm<br>	and is to sprinkle some of the oil with his finger, seven times, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.17 	From the remainder of oil that is on his palm, the priest is to place some on the ridge of the right ear of the one-being-purified, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the thumb-toe of his right foot,<br>	on top of the blood of the <i>asham</i>-offering.18 	And what remains of the oil that is on the palm of the priest<br>	he is to place upon the head of the one-being-purified;<br>	then the priest is to effect-purgation for him, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.19 	Then the priest is to make the <i>hattat</i>-offering and is to effect-purgation for the one-being-purified from his <i>tum’a</i>,<br>	and afterward he is to slaughter the offering-up.20 	And the priest is to offer-up the offering-up and the grain-gift upon the altar,<br>	and the priest is to effect-purgation for him;<br>	then he is pure.21 	But if he is poor and his hand does not reach [far],<br>	he is to take one lamb as an <i>asham,</i> for elevating, for effecting-purgation for him,<br>	and one tenth-measure of flour, mixed with oil, as a grain-gift, and a <i>log</i> of oil,22 	and two turtledoves or two young pigeons, [as far as] his hand can reach,<br>	the one shall be the <i>hattat</i>-offering and the other, the offering-up.23 	He is to bring them on the eighth day of his being-purified, to the priest,<br>	to the entrance of the Tent of Appointment, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.24 	Then the priest is to take the lamb of <i>asham</i>-offering and the <i>log</i> of oil,<br>	and the priest is to elevate them as an elevation-offering, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>;25 	he is to slaughter the lamb of <i>asham</i>-offering,<br>	then the priest is to take some of the blood of the <i>asham</i>-offering<br>	and is to place [it] on the ridge of the right ear of the one-being-purified, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the thumb-toe of his right foot,26 	and some of the oil the priest is to pour out on the left palm of the priest;27 	the priest is to sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is on his left palm, seven times, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.28 	Then the priest is to place some of the oil that is on his palm<br>	on the ridge of the right ear of the one-being-purified, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the thumb-toe of his right foot,<br>	on the place of the blood of the <i>asham</i>-offering;29 	what-is-left of the oil that is on the palm of the priest he is to place on the head of the-one-being-purified,<br>	to effect-purgation for him, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.30 	Then he is to make [as sacrifice] one of the turtledoves or the young pigeons, from [within] what his hand can reach31 	—whatever his hand can reach—<br>	the one as a <i>hattat</i>-offering and the other as an offering-up, along with a grain-gift,<br>	and the priest is to effect-purgation for the one-being-purified, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.32 	This is the Instruction [regarding] the one who has an affliction of <i>tzaraat,</i><br>	whose hand cannot reach [means] for his purification.33 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe and to Aharon, saying:34 	When you enter the land of Canaan, that I am giving you as a holding,<br>	and I place an affliction of <i>tzaraat</i> on a house in the land of your holding,35 	there shall come the one whose house it is<br>	and report to the priest, saying:<br>	[Something] like an affliction has been seen by me on the house!36 	Then the priest is to command that the house be cleaned before the priest enters to look at the affliction,<br>	so that nothing that is in the house becomes-<i>tamei;</i><br>	after that the priest may enter to look at the house.37 	He is to look at the affliction, and here, should the affliction be on the walls of the house [as] greenish or reddish eruptions,<br>	with their look lower than the wall,38 	the priest is to go out of the house, to the entrance of the house,<br>	and is to have the house shut up for seven days.39 	The priest is to return on the seventh day,<br>	and is to look, and here, should the affliction have spread on the walls of the house,40 	the priest is to command that they pull out the stones on which the affliction is<br>	and throw them outside the city, into a <i>tamei</i> place;41 	the house someone shall scrape inside, all around,<br>	and they are to pour the dried-mud that was scraped off outside the city, into a <i>tamei</i> place.42 	Then they are to take other stones and bring them in place of the [original] stones,<br>	other dried-mud they are to take, and are to replaster the house.43 	Now if the affliction returns and sprouts in the house<br>	after one has pulled out the stones,<br>	and after the house’s being-scraped, and after its having-been-plastered,44 	the priest is to enter,<br>	and look, and here, should the affliction have spread in the house,<br>	it is acute <i>tzaraat</i> in the house, it is <i>tamei</i>.45 	Then one is to demolish the house—its stones, its wood and all the dried-mud on the house,<br>	and one is to take [it] outside the town, to a <i>tamei</i> place.46 	One who enters the house [during] all the days of its being shut up<br>	is to remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset;47 	one lying in the house is to scrub his garments;<br>	one eating in the house is to scrub his garments.48 	Now if the priest should enter, yes, enter<br>	and look, and here, the affliction has not spread through the house<br>	after the replastering of the house,<br>	the priest is to declare the house pure, since the affliction has healed.49 	He is to take, to decontaminate the house, two birds,<br>	and cedar wood, scarlet of the worm, and hyssop,50 	and he is to slaughter the one bird in an earthen vessel, over living water;51 	then he is to take the cedar wood and the hyssop and the scarlet of the worm, and the live bird,<br>	and is to dip them in the blood of the slaughtered bird, and in the living water,<br>	and is to sprinkle [it] on the house seven times.52 	So he is to decontaminate the house with the blood of the bird and with the living water,<br>	with the live bird, with the cedar wood, with the hyssop and with the scarlet of the worm;53 	then he is to send-free the live bird, outside the town, toward the open field.<br>	When he effects-purgation for the house,<br>	then it is pure.54 @ 	This is the Instruction [regarding] any affliction of <i>tzaraat,</i> for scalls,55 	for <i>tzaraat</i> of cloth or of a house,56 	for swelling, for scabs or for shiny-spots,57 	to provide-instruction, at the time of the <i>tamei</i> and at the time of the pure.<br>	This is the Instruction [regarding] <i>tzaraat</i>.15:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe and to Aharon, saying:2 	Speak to the Children of Israel and say to them:<br>	Any-man, any-man, when he becomes one-with-a-flow from his “flesh,”<br>	his flow—it is <i>tamei</i>.3 	And this is his <i>tum’a</i> during his flow,<br>	[whether] his “flesh” oozes with his flow or his “flesh” is sealed up by his flow,<br>	it is his <i>tum’a:</i>4 	any place-of-lying that the one-with-a-flow lies on becomes <i>tamei</i>,<br>	and any vessel that he sits on becomes <i>tamei</i>.5 	A man that touches his place-of-lying is to scrub his garments and wash in water,<br>	and will remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset.6 	One who sits on the vessel on which the one-with-the-flow sits<br>	is to scrub his garments and wash in water,<br>	and will remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset.7 	One who touches the flesh of the one-with-the-flow<br>	is to scrub his garments and wash in water,<br>	and will remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset.8 	Now if one-with-a-flow spits on one [who is] pure,<br>	[that one] is to scrub his garments and wash in water,<br>	and will remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset.9 	Any saddle-mounting that one-with-a-flow mounts, becomes-<i>tamei</i>.10 	Anyone who touches anything that is under him<br>	will remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset,<br>	one-who-carries them is to scrub his garments and wash in water,<br>	and will remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset.11 	Anyone whom the one-with-the-flow touches, and he did not rinse his hands in water,<br>	is to scrub his garments and wash in water,<br>	and will remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset.12 	And an earthen vessel that the one-with-a-flow touches is to be broken,<br>	and any wooden vessel is to be rinsed in water.13 	Now when the one-with-a-flow is purified from his flow,<br>	he is to number himself seven days of being pure;<br>	when he scrubs his garments and washes his flesh in living water,<br>	then he is pure.14 	On the eighth day he is to take himself two turtledoves or two young pigeons<br>	and is to come before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, at the entrance to the Tent of Appointment,<br>	and is to give them to the priest.15 	The priest is to make them [as sacrifice], the one as a <i>hattat</i>-offering and the other as an offering-up;<br>	thus will the priest effect-purgation for him before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, from his flow.16 @ 	Now a man, when there goes out from him an emission of seed,<br>	he is to wash in water all of his flesh,<br>	and will remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset.17 	Any garment or any animal-skin on which there is an emission of seed<br>	is to be scrubbed in water,<br>	and will remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset.18 	And [also] a woman with whom a man lies, [with] an emission of seed:<br>	they are to wash in water,<br>	and will remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset.19 @ 	A woman—when she is one-with-a-flow, her flow being of blood from her “flesh,”<br>	seven days shall she remain in her [state of] discharge.<br>	Anyone who touches her is to remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset.20 	Anything that she lies upon in her [state of] discharge becomes <i>tamei,</i><br>	anything that she sits upon becomes <i>tamei</i>.21 	Anyone who touches her lying-place is to scrub his garments and wash in water,<br>	and will remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset.22 	Anyone who touches any vessel that she sat upon is to scrub his garments and wash in water,<br>	and will remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset.23 	Whether it is upon the lying-place or upon the vessel that she has sat upon,<br>	on touching it he will remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset.24 	And if a man lies, yes, lies with her, so that her [state of] discharge is upon him,<br>	he will remain-<i>tamei</i> for seven days;<br>	any place-of-lying upon which he lies becomes <i>tamei</i>.25 @ 	Now a woman—when the flow of her blood flows for many days, when it is not the time of her discharge,<br>	or when it flows out over-and-above her discharge,<br>	all the days of her <i>tamei</i> flow she shall be like [during] the days of her discharge;<br>	she is <i>tamei</i>.26 	Any lying-place upon which she lies, all the days of her flow, shall be for her like the lying-place [during] her discharge,<br>	and any vessel that she sits upon shall be <i>tamei,</i> like the <i>tum’a</i> of her discharge.27 	Whoever touches them becomes <i>tamei</i>;<br>	he is to scrub his garments and wash in water,<br>	and will remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset.28 @ 	Now when she is purified from her flow,<br>	she is to number seven days,<br>	and afterward, she becomes pure.29 	And on the eighth day she is to take herself two turtledoves or two young pigeons<br>	and is to bring them to the priest, to the entrance of the Tent of Appointment.30 	The priest is to make the one as a <i>hattat</i>-offering and the other as an offering-up;<br>	thus the priest is to effect-purgation for her before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, from her <i>tamei</i> flow.31 @ 	You are to have the Children of Israel avoid their <i>tum’a,</i><br>	that they not die from their <i>tum’a</i><br>	when they make my Dwelling <i>tamei</i> that is in their midst.32 @ 	This is the Instruction [regarding] the one-with-a-flow<br>	and for [one] from whom goes out an emission of seed, becoming <i>tamei</i> thereby,33 	and for one infirm in her [state of] discharge, for one who has-a-flow with one’s flow, male or female,<br>	and for a man that lies with a <i>tamei</i>-woman.16:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe<br>	after the death of the two sons of Aharon,<br>	when they came-near before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc> and died;2 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Speak to Aharon your brother,<br>	[so] that he [does] not enter, at [just] any time, the Holy-Shrine, inside the curtain, facing the Purgation-Cover that is on top of the Coffer,<br>	that he [does] not die;<br>	for in a cloud I make-myself seen, over the Purgation-Cover.3 	In this [manner] is Aharon to enter the Holy-Shrine:<br>	with a bull, a young-one of the herd, for a <i>hattat</i>-offering, and a ram for an offering-up.4 	In a holy tunic of linen he is to dress,<br>	linen breeches are to be upon his [naked] body,<br>	with a sash of linen he is to gird himself,<br>	with a turban of linen he is to turban himself;<br>	they are garments for the Holy-Shrine.<br>	He is to wash his body in water, and dress in them.5 	From the community of the Children of Israel he is to take two hairy goats for a <i>hattat</i>-offering, and one ram for an offering-up.6 	And Aharon is to bring near the bull for the <i>hattat</i>-offering that is his,<br>	so that he may effect-atonement on behalf of himself and on behalf of his household.7 	He is to take the two hairy [goats] and is to stand them before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	at the entrance to the Tent of Appointment.8 	Aharon is to place upon the two hairy [goats] lots,<br>	one lot for <sc>Yhwh</sc> and one lot for Azazel.9 	Then Aharon is to bring near the hairy one for which the lot for <sc>Yhwh</sc> came up,<br>	and is to designate it as a <i>hattat</i>-offering,10 	and the hairy-one for which the lot of Azazel came up is to be left standing-alive, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	to effect-atonement upon it,<br>	to send it away to Azazel into the wilderness.11 	Then Aharon is to bring near the bull of the <i>hattat</i>-offering that is his,<br>	and effect-atonement on behalf of himself and on behalf of his household;<br>	he is to slaughter the bull of the <i>hattat</i>-offering that is his,12 	and is to take a panful of fiery coals from atop the altar, from before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	and [two] fistfuls of fragrant-incense, finely-ground,<br>	and is to bring [it] inside the curtain.13 	Then he is to place the incense on the fire, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	so that the cloud [from] the incense covers the Purgation-Cover that is over the Testimony,<br>	so that he does not die.14 	Then he is to take [some] of the blood of the bull<br>	and sprinkle [it] with his finger on the front of the Purgation-Cover<i>,</i> eastward,<br>	and before the Purgation-Cover he is to sprinkle, seven times, some of the blood with his finger.15 	Then he is to slaughter the hairy-goat of the <i>hattat</i>-offering that is the people’s,<br>	and bring its blood inside the curtain,<br>	doing with its blood as he did with the blood of the bull:<br>	he is to sprinkle it on the Purgation-Cover<i>,</i> and before the Purgation-Cover.16 	So he is to effect-purgation for the Holy-Shrine<br>	from the <i>tum’ot</i> of the Children of Israel, from their transgressions, for all of their sins,<br>	and thus he is to do with the Tent of Appointment, which dwells with them in the midst of their <i>tum’ot</i>.17 	No human is to be in the Tent of Appointment when he enters it to effect-atonement in the Holy-Shrine, until he goes out.<br>	He is to effect-atonement on behalf of himself and on behalf of his household, and on behalf of the entire assembly of Israel.18 	Then he is to go out to the altar that is before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, and effect-purgation on it,<br>	he is to take some of the blood of the bull and some of the blood of the hairy-goat<br>	and is to place [it] on the horns of the altar, all around;19 	he is to sprinkle on it from [the rest of] the blood with his finger seven times;<br>	he is to purify it and he is to hallow it<br>	from the <i>tum’ot</i> of the Children of Israel.20 	[When] he has finished purging the Holy-Shrine and the Tent of Appointment and the altar,<br>	he is to bring near the live hairy [goat],21 	Aharon is to lean his two hands on the head of the live hairy [goat]<br>	and is to confess over it<br>	all the iniquities of the Children of Israel, all their transgressions, for all of their sins;<br>	then he is to place them upon the head of the hairy [goat]<br>	and is to send it free by the hand of a man for the occasion, into the wilderness.22 	The hairy [goat] is to bear upon itself all their iniquities, to a land cut off;<br>	he is to send free the hairy [goat] in the wilderness.23 	Then Aharon is to enter the Tent of Appointment and is to strip off his linen garments in which he dressed when he entered the Holy-Shrine,<br>	and is to leave them there;24 	then he is to wash his flesh in water, in a holy place, and is to dress in his garments,<br>	he is to go out and make his offering-up and the offering-up of the people;<br>	so shall he effect-atonement on behalf of himself and on behalf of the people.25 	And the fat of the <i>hattat</i>-offering he is to turn-into-smoke upon the altar.26 	Now the one who sent free the hairy [goat] for Azazel is to scrub his garments and wash his flesh in water;<br>	after that he may reenter the camp.27 	And the bull of <i>hattat</i> and the hairy [goat] of <i>hattat</i> whose blood was brought in to effect-purgation in the Holy-Shrine are to be taken outside the camp,<br>	and in fire are to be burned their skins, their flesh, and their dung.28 	And [each] one who burns them is to scrub his garments and wash his flesh in water;<br>	after that he may reenter the camp.29 	And it shall be for you a law for the ages:<br>	in the seventh month, on the tenth of the month,<br>	you are to afflict your selves;<br>	any-kind of work you are not to do—<br>	[both] the native and the sojourner that sojourns in your midst.30 	For on this day atonement is to be effected for you,<br>	to purify you from all your sins;<br>	before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, you will become-pure.31 	It is a Sabbath of Sabbath-Ceasing for you;<br>	you are to afflict your selves,<br>	a law for the ages.32 	The priest shall effect-purgation who has been anointed and whose hand has been filled to act-as-priest in place of his father.<br>	He is to dress in garments of linen, garments of the Holy-Area;33 	he is to effect-purgation for the Holiest of Holy-Shrines,<br>	for the Tent of Appointment and the altar he is to effect-purgation,<br>	and for the priests and for all the people of the assembly he is to effect-atonement.34 	This shall be for you a law for the ages,<br>	to effect-atonement for the Children of Israel from all their sins,<br>	once a year.<br>	And he did as <sc>Yhwh</sc> commanded Moshe.17:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:2 	Speak to Aharon and to his sons and to all the Children of Israel,<br>	and say to them:<br>	This is the word that <sc>Yhwh</sc> has commanded, saying:3 	Any-man, any-man of the House of Israel who slaughters an ox or a sheep or a goat in the camp<br>	or who slaughters [it] outside the camp,4 	and to the entrance of the Tent of Appointment does not bring it,<br>	to bring it near as a near-offering to <sc>Yhwh</sc> before the Dwelling of <sc>Yhwh</sc>:<br>	blood is to be reckoned to that man, blood has he shed;<br>	that man is to be cut off from amid his kinspeople—5 	in order that the Children of Israel may bring their sacrifices that they are sacrificing in the open field,<br>	that they may bring them to <sc>Yhwh</sc>, to the entrance of the Tent of Appointment, to the priest,<br>	and sacrifice them as sacrifices of <i>shalom</i> to <sc>Yhwh</sc>.6 	The priest is to dash their blood against the altar of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, at the entrance of the Tent of Appointment,<br>	and is to turn the fat into smoke as a soothing savor to <sc>Yhwh</sc>—7 	that they may no longer sacrifice their sacrifices<br>	to the hairy [goat-demons] after whom they go whoring.<br>	A law for the ages shall this be for them, throughout their generations.8 	And to them you are [also] to say:<br>	Any-man, any-man of the House of Israel or of the sojourners who sojourn in their midst<br>	who offers-up an offering-up or a sacrifice9 	and to the Tent of Appointment does not bring it, to make [as sacrifice] to <sc>Yhwh</sc>:<br>	cut off shall that man be from his kinspeople!10 	And any-man, any-man of the House of Israel or of the sojourners who sojourn in their midst<br>	who eats any blood:<br>	I set my face against the person who eats the blood;<br>	I will cut him off from amid his kinspeople!11 	For the life of the flesh—it is in the blood;<br>	I [myself] have given it to you upon the altar, to effect-ransom for your lives,<br>	for the blood—it effects-ransom for life!12 	Therefore I say to the Children of Israel:<br>	Every person among you is not to eat blood,<br>	and the sojourner who sojourns in your midst is not to eat blood.13 	And any-man, any-man of the Children of Israel or of the sojourner who sojourns in your midst<br>	who hunts any hunted wild-animal or a bird that may be eaten<br>	is to pour out its blood and cover it with the dust.14 	For the life of all flesh—its blood is its life!<br>	So I say to the Children of Israel:<br>	The blood of all flesh you are not to eat,<br>	for the life of all flesh—it is its blood;<br>	everyone eating it shall be cut off!15 	And any person that eats a carcass, or an animal-torn-to-pieces,<br>	among the native-born or among the sojourners,<br>	when he scrubs his garments and washes in water,<br>	and remains-<i>tamei</i> until sunset—<br>	then he is pure.16 	But if he does not scrub [them], and his flesh he does not wash,<br>	he continues-to-bear his iniquity!18:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:2 	Speak to the Children of Israel and say to them:<br>	I am <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God!3 	What is done in the land of Egypt, wherein you were settled, you are not to do;<br>	what is done in the land of Canaan, to which I am bringing you, you are

proclamation of holiness shall there be for you.<br>	You are to afflict your selves,<br>	and you are to bring-near a fire-offering to <sc>Yhwh</sc>;28 	any-kind of work you are not to do on that same day,<br>	for it is the Day of Atonement, to effect-atonement for you before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God.29 	Indeed, if any person does not afflict-himself on that same day,<br>	he is to be cut-off from his kinspeople,30 	and if any person does any-kind of work on that same day—<br>	I will cause that person to perish from amid his kinspeople!31 	Any-kind of work you are not to do—<br>	a law for the ages, into your generations, throughout all your settlements.32 	It is Sabbath, a Sabbath-ceasing for you,<br>	you are to afflict your selves;<br>	on the ninth of the month, at sunset,<br>	from sunset to sunset, you are to make-a-ceasing of your ceasing!33 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:34 	Speak to the Children of Israel, saying:<br>	On the fifteenth day of this seventh month:<br>	the pilgrimage-festival of Huts, for seven days, to <sc>Yhwh</sc>.35 	On the first day [is] a proclamation of holiness:<br>	any-kind of servile work you are not to do.36 	For seven days you are to bring near a fire-offering to <sc>Yhwh</sc>;<br>	on the eighth day, a proclamation of holiness shall there be for you;<br>	you are to bring near a fire-offering to <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	—it is [a day of] Restraint:<br>	any-kind of servile work you are not to do.37 @ 	These are the appointed-times of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, which you are to proclaim as proclamations of holiness,<br>	to bring near fire-offerings to <sc>Yhwh</sc>—offering-up, grain-gift, sacrifice and pour-offerings,<br>	each-day’s protocol in its day,38 	aside from the Sabbaths of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, aside from your presents,<br>	aside from all your vow-offerings and aside from all your freewill-offerings that you give to <sc>Yhwh</sc>.39 @ 	Mark, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month,<br>	when you have gathered in the produce of the land,<br>	you are to celebrate-as-pilgrimage the pilgrimage-festival of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, for seven days:<br>	on the first day [is] a Sabbath-ceasing and on the eighth day [is] a Sabbath-ceasing.40 	You are to take yourselves, on the first day, the fruit of beautiful trees, branches of palms,<br>	and boughs of thick tree-foliage, and willows of the brook.<br>	And you are to rejoice before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God for seven days;41 	you are to celebrate-it-as pilgrimage, a pilgrimage-festival to <sc>Yhwh</sc>, for seven days a year—<br>	a law for the ages, throughout your generations:<br>	in the seventh month you are to celebrate-it-as-pilgrimage42 	—in huts you are to stay for seven days,<br>	every native in Israel is to stay in huts—43 	in order that your generations may know that in huts I had the Children of Israel stay<br>	when I brought them out of the land of Egypt;<br>	I am <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God!44 @ 	So Moshe declared the appointed-times of <sc>Yhwh</sc> to the Children of Israel.24:1 @	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:2 	Command the Children of Israel,<br>	that they take you oil of olives, clear, beaten, for lighting,<br>	to draw up lampwicks, regularly.3 	Outside the Curtain of the Testimony, in the Tent of Appointment, Aharon is to arrange it,<br>	from sunset to daybreak, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, regularly—<br>	a law for the ages, throughout your generations.4 	On the pure lampstand he is to arrange the lampwicks, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, regularly.5 @ 	You are to take flour and are to bake it [into] twelve loaves;<br>	two tenth-measures shall be the one loaf.6 	You are to put them [into] two arranged-rows, six per row,<br>	on the pure table, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.7 	And you are to place on [each] row clear frankincense;<br>	it shall be for the bread as a reminder-portion, a fire-offering to <sc>Yhwh</sc>.8 	Sabbath day [by] Sabbath day he is to arrange it before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, regularly,<br>	from the Children of Israel as a covenant for the ages.9 	They are to be Aharon’s and his sons’;<br>	they are to eat them in a holy place,<br>	for they are a holiest holy-portion for him, from the fire-offerings of <sc>Yhwh</sc>—an allotment for the ages.10 @ 	Now the son of an Israelite woman went out<br>	—he was [also] the son of an Egyptian man—<br>	amid the Children of Israel;<br>	and they scuffled in the camp,<br>	the son of the Israelite-woman and a [fully] Israelite man.11 	Now the son of the Israelite woman reviled the Name, and insulted [it],<br>	so they brought him to Moshe<br>	—now the name of his mother [was] Shelomit daughter of Divri, of the tribe of Dan—12 	and they put him under guard, to clarify it for them by order of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.13 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:14 	Take out the insulter, outside the camp,<br>	let all those who heard [the curse] lean their hands on his head<br>	and let the entire community pelt him!15 	And to the Children of Israel you are to speak, saying:<br>	Anyone, anyone who insults his god—<br>	he shall bear his sin!16 	But whoever blasphemes the name of <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	is to be put to death, yes, death,<br>	the entire community is to pelt, yes, pelt him;<br>	as the sojourner, so the native,<br>	when he reviles the Name, he is to be put to death!17 	Now a man—when he strikes down any human life,<br>	he is to be put to death, yes, death!18 	One who strikes the life of an animal is to pay for it, life in place of life.19 	And a man—when he causes a defect in his fellow:<br>	as he has done, thus is to be done to him—20 	break in place of break, eye in place of eye, tooth in place of tooth;<br>	as he has caused a defect in [another] human, thus is to be caused in him.21 	Whoever strikes down an animal is to pay for it,<br>	but one who strikes down a human is to be put to death.22 	One standard-of-judgment shall there be for you;<br>	as the sojourner, so shall the native be,<br>	for I am <sc>Yhwh</sc>  your God!23 	Thus spoke Moshe to the Children of Israel.<br>	They took out the insulter, outside the camp<br>	and they pelted him with stones;<br>	so the Children of Israel did as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe.25:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe at Mount Sinai, saying:2 	Speak to the Children of Israel, and say to them:<br>	When you enter the land that I am giving you,<br>	the land is to cease, a Sabbath-ceasing to <sc>Yhwh</sc>.3 	For six years you are to sow your field,<br>	for six years you are to prune your vineyard,<br>	then you are to gather in its produce,4 	but in the seventh year<br>	there shall be a Sabbath of Sabbath-ceasing for the land,<br>	a Sabbath to <sc>Yhwh</sc>:<br>	your field you are not to sow,<br>	your vineyard you are not to prune,5 	the aftergrowth of your harvest you are not to harvest,<br>	the grapes of your consecrated-vines you are not to amass;<br>	a year of Sabbath-ceasing shall there be for the land!6 	Now the Sabbath-yield of the land is for you, for eating,<br>	for you, for your servant and for your handmaid,<br>	for your hired-hand and for your resident-settler who sojourn with you;7 	and for your domestic-animal and the wild-beast that are in your land<br>	shall be all its produce, to eat.8 	Now you are to number yourselves seven Sabbath-cycles of years<br>	—seven years, seven times—<br>	so the time of the seven Sabbath-cycles of years will be for you [a total of] nine and forty years.9 	Then you are to give-forth a blast [on the] <i>shofar</i>;<br>	in the seventh month, on the tenth of the month, on the Day of Atonement,<br>	you are to give[-blast on the] <i>shofar</i> throughout all your land.10 	You are to hallow the year, the fiftieth year,<br>	and proclaim freedom throughout the land and to all its inhabitants;<br>	it shall be Homebringing for you:<br>	you are to return, each-man to his holding,<br>	each-man to his clan you are to return.11 	It is Homebringing, the fiftieth year—it shall be [thus] for you:<br>	you are not to sow,<br>	you are not to harvest its aftergrowth,<br>	you are not to gather its consecrated-grapes,12 	for it is Homebringing, holy shall it be for you,&mdash;<br>	[only] from the field may you eat its produce;13 	in this Year of Homebringing you are to return, each-man to his holding.14 @ 	Now when you sell property-for-sale to your fellow<br>	or purchase [it] from the hand of your fellow,<br>	do not maltreat, any-man, his brother!15 	By the number of years after the Homebringing<br>	you are to purchase [it] from your fellow,<br>	by the number of years of produce [left] he is to sell it to you:16 	according to the many years [left], you may charge-him-much for his purchase,<br>	according to the few years [left], you may charge-him-little for his purchase,<br>	since a [certain] number of harvests is what he is selling to you.17 	So you are not to maltreat any-man his fellow,<br>	rather, you are to hold your God in awe,<br>	for I am <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God!18 	You are to observe my laws,<br>	my regulations you are to keep, and observe them,<br>	that you may be settled on the land in security,19 	that the land may give forth its fruit<br>	and that you may eat to being-satisfied,<br>	and be settled in security upon it.20 	Now if you should say [to yourselves]:<br>	What are we to eat in the seventh year?<br>	—[for] here, we may not sow, we may not gather our produce!21 	Then I will dispatch my blessing for you during the sixth year<br>	so that it yields produce for three years;22 	you may sow the eighth year[’s yield], but you must eat of the old produce until the ninth year;<br>	until its produce comes in, you must eat what-is-old.23 	But the land is not to be sold in-harness, for the land is mine&mdash;<br>	for you are sojourners and resident-settlers with me;24 	throughout all the land of your holdings, you are to allow for redemption of the land.25 @ 	When your brother sinks down [in poverty] and has to sell some of his holding,<br>	his redeemer nearest-in-kin to him is to come<br>	and redeem the sold-property of his brother.26 	Now a man—if he has no redeemer,<br>	but his hand reaches [means] and finds enough to redeem with,27 	he is to reckon the years since its sale,<br>	and return the surplus to the man to whom he sold it,<br>	and it is to return to his holding.28 	But if his hand does not find enough [means] for returning it,<br>	what he sold is to remain in the hand of the one purchasing it, until the Year of Homebringing;<br>	it is to go-free in the Homebringing-Year, and it is to return to his holding.29 	A man—if he sells a residential house in a walled town,<br>	its redemption-period until the end of the year of its sale;<br>	a year-of-days shall be its redemption-period.30 	If it is not redeemed before a whole year of it has been fulfilled,<br>	the house that is in the town that has a wall shall be established, in-harness, for him who purchases it, throughout his generations;<br>	it is not to go-free in the Homebringing-Year.31 	But houses in villages that do not have a wall around them,<br>	as open-fields of the land are they to be reckoned;<br>	there may be redemption for them,<br>	and in the Homebringing-Year they may go free.32 	Now [as for] the towns of the Levites, the houses in the towns of their holding—<br>	redemption-right for the ages is to belong to the Levites.33 	[That] which is redeemed from the Levites:<br>	it is to go free, the house sold in the town of their holding, in the Homebringing-Year,<br>	for houses of Levitical towns, they are their holding amid the Children of Israel.34 	But pasture-land of the field [near] their towns is not to be sold,<br>	for it is a holding for the ages for them.35 @ 	Now when your brother sinks down [in poverty]<br>	and his hand falters beside you,<br>	then shall you hold him<br>	as [though] a sojourner and resident-settler,<br>	and he is to live beside you.36 	Do not take from him biting-interest or profit,<br>	but hold your God in awe,<br>	that your brother may live beside you!37 	Your silver you are not to give him at interest,<br>	for profit you are not to give [him] your food;38 	I <sc>Yhwh</sc> am your God<br>	who brought you out of the land of Egypt<br>	to give you the land of Canaan,<br>	to be a God for you!39 @ 	And when your brother sinks down [in poverty] beside you, and sells himself to you,<br>	you are not to make him serve the servitude of a serf&mdash;40 	as a hired-hand, as a resident-settler is he to be beside you;<br>	[only] until the Year of Homebringing is he to serve beside you.41 	Then he is to go-free from beside you,<br>	he and his children beside him;<br>	he may return to his clan,<br>	and to the holding of his fathers he may return.42 	For my servants are they<br>	whom I brought out of the land of Egypt;<br>	they are not to be sold as the sale of serfs.43 	You are not to dominate him with crushing-labor;<br>	rather, you are to hold your God in awe!44 @ 	Your servant and your maid that belong to you from the nations surrounding you, from them you may purchase serf and maid;45 	also from the sons of the residents who sojourn beside you, from them you may purchase [slaves],<br>	or from their clans that are beside you, that they beget in your land,<br>	and they shall become your holdings.46 	You may keep-them-as-an-inheritance for your children after you,<br>	for [them to] possess as holdings;<br>	for the ages you may make them serve you.<br>	But among your brothers, the Children of Israel, each one toward his brother,<br>	you are not to dominate him with crushing-labor!47 @ 	Now if the hand of a resident sojourner reaches [means] beside you,<br>	and your brother sinks down [in poverty] beside him,<br>	so that he sells himself to the resident sojourner beside you, or to an offshoot of the sojourner’s clan,48 	[even] after he has sold himself, redemption may be his;<br>	one of his brothers may redeem him,49 	or his uncle or the son of his uncle may redeem him,<br>	or a blood-relation of his flesh, from his clan, may redeem him,<br>	or, should his hand reach [means], he may redeem-himself.50 	He is to reckon with his purchaser from the year that he was sold to him until the Year of Homebringing;<br>	the silver from his sale shall be by the number of years—<br>	like the time-period of a hired-hand is he to be beside him.51 	If there are still many years [left],<br>	according to them he is to return-payment for his redemption from the silver of his purchase;52 	and if few remain in years until the Year of Homebringing,<br>	he is to reckon it to him&mdash;<br>	according to its years he is to return-payment for his redemption.53 	As a hired-hand, year by year, he is to be beside him;<br>	he is not to dominate him with crushing-labor before your eyes.54 	And if he has not been redeemed in [any of] these [ways],<br>	he is to go free in the Year of Homebringing, he and his children beside him.55 	For it is to me that the Children of Israel are servants&mdash;<br>	my servants are they,<br>	whom I brought out of the land of Egypt,<br>	I am <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God!26:1 @ 	You are not to make for yourselves no-gods,<br>	a carved-image or a standing-pillar you are not to establish for yourselves,<br>	a decorated stone you are not to place in your land, to bow down to it,<br>	for I <sc>Yhwh</sc> am your God!2 	My Sabbaths you are to keep, my Holy-Shrine you are to hold-in-awe;<br>	I am <sc>Yhwh</sc>!3 @ 	If by my laws you walk, and my commands you keep, and observe them,4 	then I will give-forth your rains in their set-time,<br>	so that the earth gives-forth its yield<br>	and the trees of the field give-forth their fruit.5 	Threshing will overtake vintage for you, and vintage will overtake sowing;<br>	you shall eat your food to being-satisfied, and be settled in security in your land.6 	I will give peace throughout the land, so that you will lie down with none to make you tremble,<br>	I will cause-to-cease wild beasts from the land, and a sword shall not cross through your land.7 	You shall pursue your enemies, and they will fall before you to the sword;8 	five of you will pursue a hundred, and a hundred of you, a myriad pursue,<br>	and your enemies will fall before you to the sword.9 	I will turn-my-face toward you, make-you-fruitful and make-you-many,<br>	and I will establish my covenant with you.10 	You will eat old-grain, the oldest-stored,<br>	and the old for the new you will have to clear out.11 	I will place my Dwelling in your midst,<br>	and I will not repel you.12 	I will walk about in your midst,<br>	and I will be a God for you, and you yourselves will be a people for me.13 	I <sc>Yhwh</sc> am your God<br>	who brought you out of the land of Egypt,<br>	from your being serfs to them;<br>	I broke the bars of your yoke, enabling you to walk upright!14 @ 	But if you do not hearken to me, and do not observe all these commandments,15 	if my laws you spurn, and if my regulations you repel<br>	by not observing all my commandments, by your violating my covenant,16 	I in turn will do this to you:<br>	I will mete out shock to you,<br>	and consumption, and fever,<br>	wearing out the eyes and exhausting the breath;<br>	and you will sow your seed for naught, for your enemies will eat it.17 	And I will set my face against you, you will be hit-by-plague in the face of your enemies;<br>	those who hate you will dominate you,<br>	you will flee, with no one pursuing you!18 @ 	Now if, after all that, you do not hearken to me,<br>	I will continue to discipline you, sevenfold, for your sins—19 	I will break your fierce pride!<br>	I will give your heavens to be like iron, and your earth like bronze,20 	so that your power will be spent for naught;<br>	your land will not give forth its yield,<br>	the trees of the land will not give forth their fruit.21 @ 	Now if you walk with me [in] opposition, and do not consent to hearken to me,<br>	I will continue against you blows, sevenfold, according to your sins—22 	I will send loose against you the wild-beasts of the field,<br>	so that they bereave you,<br>	so that they [utterly] cut off your animals,<br>	so that they make you few, and your roads become desolate.23 @ 	Now if, after these-things, you do not accept-discipline from me,<br>	but [continue to] walk with me [in] opposition,24 	I will walk with you, I myself, with opposition;<br>	I will strike you, yes, I myself, sevenfold for your sins:25 	I will bring against you an avenging sword, taking-vengeance for the covenant.<br>	Should you gather yourselves into your cities,<br>	I will send-free pestilence in your midst,<br>	and you will be given into the hand of your enemies.26 	When I break the “staff of bread” for you, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven;<br>	they will return your bread by weight,<br>	and you will eat, but you will not be satisfied.27 @ 	And if after this you will not hearken to me,<br>	but [still] walk with me with opposition,28 	I will walk with you in the heat of opposition;<br>	I will discipline you, even I myself, sevenfold for your sins!29 	You will eat the flesh of your sons,<br>	and the flesh of your daughters, you will eat!30 	I will wipe out your sanctuaries and and cut down your cult-stands,<br>	I will place your corpses atop the corpses of your Illicit-Things<br>	and I will repel you.31 	I will make your cities a wasteland,<br>	I will make-desolate your holy-shrines,<br>	and I will not savor your soothing savors!32 	And I, I myself, will make the land desolate,<br>	so that your enemies that settle in it will be appalled-at-the-desolation in it.33 	And you I will scatter among the nations;<br>	I will unsheath the sword against you,<br>	so that your land becomes a desolation and your cities become a wasteland.34 	Then the land will find-acceptance regarding its Sabbaths,<br>	all the days of desolation—when you are in the land of your enemies—<br>	then the land will enjoy-cessation, and find-acceptance regarding its Sabbaths.35 	All the days of desolation it will enjoy-cessation,<br>	since it did not enjoy-cessation during its Sabbaths when you were settled on it.36 	Now those that remain among you—I will bring faintness into their hearts, in the lands of their enemies,<br>	they will be set-in-pursuit by the sound of a leaf blown about,<br>	they will flee as if in flight from a sword and will fall, though there is no pursuer!37 	They will stumble, each-man over his brother, as before the sword, though pursuer there is none.<br>	And you will not be able to stand-your-ground before your enemies;38 	rather, you will perish among the nations—<br>	it will devour you, the land of your enemies.39 	Those that remain among you will rot away in their iniquity, in the lands of their enemies;<br>	yes, because of the iniquities of their fathers, with them they shall rot away.40 	Now should they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers, in their breaking-faith by which they broke-faith with me<br>	—yes, since they have walked with me in opposition,41 	yes, I myself will walk with them in opposition,<br>	and will bring them into the land of their enemies—<br>	if then their foreskinned heart should humble itself,<br>	if then they should find-acceptance regarding their iniquity,42 	I will bear-in-mind my Yaakov covenant,<br>	and yes, my Yitzhak covenant, and yes, my Avraham covenant I will bear-in-mind, and the land I will bear-in-mind.43 	—The land will have to be left behind by them, attaining-acceptance through its Sabbaths by being-desolate-of them,<br>	and they will have to find-acceptance regarding their iniquity,<br>	because, because my regulations they spurned, and my laws they repelled.—44 	And yes, even then, when they are in the land of their enemies, <br>	I will not spurn them, I will not repel them, to finish them off, to abrogate my covenant with them,<br>	for I <sc>Yhwh</sc> am their God!45 	I will bear-in-mind to their [benefit] the covenant of the former-ones<br>	whom I brought out of the land of Egypt, before the eyes of the nations,<br>	to be a God for them;<br>	I am <sc>Yhwh</sc>!46 @ 	These are the laws, the regulations, and the instructions<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> gave between himself and the Children of Israel at Mount Sinai, by the hand of Moshe.27:1 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:2 	Speak to the Children of Israel and say to them:<br>	Anyone—when one would make a vow-offering<br>	in your assessed-equivalent of persons to <sc>Yhwh</sc>,3 	your assessment shall be:<br>	[if] a male, from the age of twenty years up to the age of sixty years,<br>	your assessment shall be fifty silver <i>shekels</i> by the Holy-Shrine <i>shekel.</i>4 	And if it is a female, your assessment shall be thirty <i>shekels.</i>5 	If the age [is] from five years up to the age of twenty years,<br>	your assessment for a male is twenty <i>shekels</i>, and for a female, ten <i>shekels.</i>6 	If from the age of a month up to the age of five years,<br>	your assessment is for a male, five silver <i>shekels,</i> and for a female, your assessment, three silver <i>shekels.</i>7 	If from the age of sixty years and upward,<br>	if a male, your assessment shall be fifteen <i>shekels,</i> and for a female, ten <i>shekels.</i>8 	If he sinks down [in poverty], lower than the assessment,<br>	he is to be stood before the priest,<br>	and the priest is to assess [the amount] for him;<br>	according to what the hand of the one-making-the-vow can reach, the priest is to assess him.9 	If [it concerns] an animal from which they bring near a near-offering for <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	all of what he gives from it to <sc>Yhwh</sc> is to be a holy-portion.10 	He is not to substitute for it and he is not to exchange it, good for ill or ill for good;<br>	if they exchange, yes, exchange animal for animal,<br>	it will be that it and its exchanged-one will be a holy-portion.11 	If it [concerns] any <i>tamei</i> animal from which there may not be brought near a near-offering for <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	the animal is to be stood before the priest,12 	and the priest is to make-assessment for it, between good and ill,<br>	according to your assessment by the priest, thus shall it be.13 	And if he [wants to] redeem, yes, redeem it,<br>	he is to add its fifth-part to your assessment.14 @ 	Now a man—when he hallows his house as holy-property to <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	the priest is to assess it, between good and ill;<br>	as the priest assesses it, thus shall [its cost] be-established.15 	And if the one-who-hallows-it would redeem his house,<br>	he is to add a fifth-part [to the] silver of your assessment,<br>	and it shall remain his.16 	If from the field of his holding any-man hallows [part] to <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	your assessment shall be according to its seed-requirement:<br>	the seed-requirement of a <i>homer</i> of barley, fifty silver <i>shekels.</i>17 	If as of the year of Homebringing he hallows his field, as your assessment [its cost] will be-established.18 	but if it is after the Homebringing that he hallows his field,<br>	the priest is to reckon for him the silver according to the years left until the Year of Homebringing,<br>	and it is to be subtracted from your [first] assessment.19 	If he wants to redeem, yes, redeem the field, the one hallowing it,<br>	he is to add a fifth-part of the silver of your assessment of it, and [its cost] is to be-established for him.20 	But if he does not want to redeem the field,<br>	or if he has sold the land to another man,<br>	it cannot be redeemed again—21 	the field shall be, when it goes-free in the Homebringing, a holy-portion for <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	like a field specially-devoted;<br>	for the priest it shall be, as his holding.22 @ 	And if his purchased field that is not a field of his holding [is what] he hallows to <sc>Yhwh</sc>,23 	the priest is to reckon for him the value of your assessment, until the Year of Homebringing,<br>	he is to give your assessment [in

of Israel,<br>	by their clans, by their Fathers’ Houses,<br>	according to the number of names, <br>	every male per capita;3 	from the age of twenty years and upward,<br>	everyone going out to the armed-forces in Israel:<br>	you are to count them [for battle] according to their forces,<br>	you and Aharon.4 	And with you let there be<br>	a man, a man per tribe [each],<br>	each head of his Fathers’ House he is [to be].5 	Now these are the names of the men who are to stand with you:<br>	for Re’uven: Elitzur son of Shedei’ur;6 	for Shim’on: Shelumi’el son of Tzurishaddai;7 	for Yehuda:

accountings of the Children of Israel by their Fathers’ Houses,<br>	all the accountings of the camps, by their forces:<br>	six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.33 	But the Levites were not counted [for battle] in the midst of the Children of Israel,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe.34 	And the Children of Israel did<br>	exactly as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe: <br>	thus they encamped, by their contingents,<br>	and thus they marched, each-man by his clans, alongside his Fathers’ House.3:1 @ 	Now these are the begettings of Aharon and

the sons of Aharon, the anointed priests,<br>	whom he had mandated to act-as-priests.4 	Now Nadav and Avihu died before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	when they brought near outside fire before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	in the Wilderness of Sinai;<br>	sons they did not have,<br>	so El’azar and Itamar were made-priest in the living-presence of Aharon their father.5 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc>

from the Children of Israel;<br>	they are to be mine, the Levites.13 	For mine is every firstborn;<br>	at the time that I struck-down every firstborn in the land of Egypt,<br>	I hallowed to me every firstborn in Israel,<br>	from man to beast.<br>	Mine are they to be;<br>	I am <sc>Yhwh</sc>!14 @ 	Now <sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe in the Wilderness of Sinai, saying:15 	Count the Sons of Levi, by their Fathers’ House, by their clans;<br>	every male from the age of a month and upward, you are to count them.16 	So Moshe counted them by order of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, as he was commanded.17 	Now these were the Sons of Levi according to their names:<br>	Gershon, Kehat and Merari.18 	And these the names of the sons of Gershon, by their clans:<br>	Livni and Shim’i.19 	And the sons of Kehat, by their clans:<br>	Amram and Yitzhar, Hevron and Uzziel.20 	And the sons of Merari, by their clans:<br>	Mahli and Mushi.<br>	These are they, the Levite clans, by their Fathers’ House.21 	For Gershon, the Livnite clan and the Shim’ite clan,<br>	these are they, the Gershonite clans:22 	those counted of them, according to the number of every male from the age of a month and upward,<br>	those counted of them: seven thousand and five hundred.23 	The Gershonite clans—behind the Dwelling they are to camp, seaward.24 	Now the leader of the Father’s House for the Gershonites: Elyasaf son of Lael.25 	The charge of the Sons of Gershon at the Tent of Appointment [was]<br>	the Dwelling and the Tent, <br>	its covering, the screen of the entrance to the Tent of Appointment,26 	the hangings of the courtyard,<br>	the screen of the entrance to the courtyard which is about the Dwelling<br>	and about the altar, all around,<br>	and its cords—including all their serving tasks.27 @ 	To Kehat, the Amramite clan, the Yitzharite clan, the Hevronite clan, and the Uzzi’elite clan,<br>	these are they, the Kehatite clans,28 	numbering every male, from the age of a month and upward:<br>	eight thousand and six hundred,<br>	keepers of the charge of the holy-things.29 	The clans of the Sons of Kehat are to encamp along the flank of the Dwelling, southward.30 	Now the leader of the Father’s House for the Kehatite clans: Elitzafan son of Uzziel.31 	Their charge: the Coffer, the table, the lampstand and the altars,<br>	and the implements of holiness that are used in conjunction with them,<br>	and the screen—and all their serving-tasks.32 @ 	Now the leader of the Levite leaders: El’azar son of Aharon the priest,<br>	accountable for the keepers of the charge of the holy-things.33 	To Merari—the Mahlite clan and the Mushite clan,<br>	these, the Merarite clans.34 	Now those counted of them, numbering every male from the age of a month and upward:<br>	six thousand and two hundred.35 	And the leader of the Father’s House of the Merarite clans: Tzuriel son of Avihayil.<br>	On the flank of the Dwelling they are to camp, northward.36 	Accountable for the [following] charge are the Sons of Merari:<br>	the boards of the Dwelling and its bars,<br>	its columns, its sockets, and all its implements,<br>	with all its service [of packing];37 	the columns of the courtyard, all around, and their bases,<br>	their posts and their cords.38 @ 	Now those encamping in front of the Dwelling, eastward, in front of the Tent of Appointment, toward sunrise:<br>	Moshe and Aharon and his sons,<br>	keepers of the charge of the Holy-Area,<br>	for the charge of the Children of Israel;<br>	the outsider who comes-near is to be put to death!39 	All those counted of the Levites, whom Moshe and Aharon counted by order of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, by their clans,<br>	every male, from the age of a month and upward:<br>	two and twenty thousand.40 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Count every firstborn male of the Children of Israel,<br>	from the age of a month and upward,<br>	take up the enumeration of their names.41 	Take the Levites aside for me <br>	—I am <sc>Yhwh</sc>!—<br>	in place of every firstborn among the Children of Israel;<br>	along with the animals of the Levites,<br>	in place of every firstborn animal among the Children of Israel.42 	Moshe made an accounting, as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded him,<br>	of every firstborn among the Children of Israel.43 	And it was, every firstborn male by the number of names,<br>	from the age of a month and upward, by their count:<br>	two and twenty thousand, three and seventy and two hundred.44 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:45 	Take aside the Levites,<br>	in place of every firstborn among the Children of Israel,<br>	along with the animals of the Levites, in place of their animals;<br>	the Levites are to be mine;<br>	I am <sc>Yhwh</sc>!46 	And as the redemption-price for the three and seventy and two hundred,<br>	those-in-excess beyond the Levites from the firstborn of the Children of Israel,47 	you are to take five—five <i>shekels</i> per capita;<br>	by the Holy-Shrine <i>shekel</i> you are to take,<br>	twenty grains to the <i>shekel.</i>48 	You are to give the silver to Aharon and to his sons,<br>	as a redemption-price for those-in-excess among them.49 	So Moshe took the silver for redemption from those-in-excess beyond those redeemed by the Levites,50 	from the firstborn of the Children of Israel he took the silver:<br>	five and sixty and three hundred and a thousand, by the Holy-Shrine <i>shekel;</i>51 	Moshe gave the silver for redemption to Aharon and to his sons, by order of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe.4:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe and to Aharon, saying:2 	Take up the head-count of the Sons of Kehat from the midst of the Sons of Levi,<br>	by their clans, by their Fathers’ House,3 	from the age of thirty years and upward, until the age of fifty years,<br>	all who enter the working-force<br>	to do skilled-work in the Tent of Appointment.4 	This is the serving-task of the Sons of Kehat in the Tent of Appointment: the holiest holy-things.5 	Aharon and his sons are to come, when the camp marches forward,<br>	and are to take down the curtain of the screen,<br>	and are to cover with it the Coffer of the Testimony.6 	They are to put over it a covering of tanned-leather skin,<br>	and are to spread a cloth entirely of blue-violet on top,<br>	putting its poles [in place].7 	On the Table of the Presence they are to spread a cloth of blue-violet,<br>	and are to place on it the bowls, the ladles, the jars and the jugs for pouring [offerings],<br>	and the regular bread is to remain on it.8 	They are to spread over these a cloth of worm-scarlet,<br>	and are to cover it with a covering of tanned-leather skin,<br>	and put its poles [in place].9 	They are to take a cloth of blue-violet<br>	and are to cover the lampstand for the lighting,<br>	its lamps, its tongs and its fire-pans,<br>	and all the implements for its oil which they use in conjunction with them.10 	They are to place it and all its implements in a covering of tanned-leather skin,<br>	and place [them] on a frame.11 	Over the altar of gold they are to spread a cloth of blue-violet,<br>	and are to cover it with a covering of tanned-leather skin,<br>	putting its poles [in place].12 	They are to take all the implements of attending with which they tend in the Holy-Shrine<br>	and are to put them into a cloth of blue-violet,<br>	and are to cover them with a covering of tanned-leather skin,<br>	placing [them] on a frame.13 	They are to de-ash the altar,<br>	and are to spread on it a cloth of purple;14 	they are to place on it all its implements that they use in conjunction with them:<br>	the fire-pans, the flesh-hooks, the scrapers and the bowls,<br>	all the implements of the altar,<br>	and they are to spread over it a covering of tanned-leather skin,<br>	and put its poles [in place].15 	[Once] Aharon and his sons have finished covering the holy-things and all the holy implements, when the camp marches on,<br>	[only] after that may the Sons of Kehat enter, to carry,<br>	so that they do not touch the holy-things and die.<br>	These are the carrying-chores of the Sons of Kehat in the Tent of Appointment.16 	Accountable is El’azar son of Aharon the priest for:<br>	the oil for the light, the fragrant smoking-incense, the regular grain-gift, and the oil for anointing—<br>	accountable for all the Dwelling and all that is in it,<br>	whether the holy-things or its implements.17 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe and to Aharon, saying:18 	Do not cut off the tribe of the clans of Kehat from the midst of the Levites;19 	do this with them,<br>	that they may live and not die<br>	when they encroach upon the holiest holy-things:<br>	Aharon and his sons are to enter and assign them,<br>	each one, each one to his service, his carrying-chores.20 	But they are not to enter and see [even] for-a-moment [the dismantling of] the Holy-Shrine, lest they die.21 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:22 	Take up the head-count of the Sons of Gershon, they too,<br>	by their Fathers’ House, by their clans,23 	from the age of thirty years and upward;<br>	to the age of fifty years you are to count them,<br>	all who enter to join-forces with the working-force, to serve the serving-tasks in the Tent of Appointment.24 	This is the serving-task of the Gershonite clans, for the service [of packing] and for carrying:25 	they are to carry <br>	the curtains of the Dwelling, and the Tent of Appointment,<br>	its covering, the covering of tanned-leather that is over it, on top,<br>	and the screen for the entrance of the Tent of Appointment,26 	the hangings of the courtyard <br>	and the screen for the entrance to the gate of the courtyard that is over the Dwelling and over the altar, all around,<br>	as well as their cords,<br>	and all their serving implements;<br>	whatever is to be done with regard to them, they are to do-the-serving-task.27 	By order of Aharon and his sons shall it be [done]:<br>	all the serving-tasks of the Sons of the Gershonites,<br>	including all their carrying-chores, including all their service.<br>	You are to make them accountable for discharging all their carrying-chores.28 	This is the serving-task of the clans of the Sons of the Gershonites at the Tent of Appointment<br>	and their charge under the hand of Itamar son of Aharon the priest.29 @ 	The Sons of Merari: by their clans, by their Fathers’ House you are to count them,30 	from the age of thirty years and upward until the age of fifty years you are to count them,<br>	every one that may enter the working-force,<br>	to serve the serving-tasks of the Tent of Appointment.31 	This is their charge of carrying, including all their service [of packing] in

all their implements, including all their serving-tasks;<br>	by name you are to account for the implements of their carrying duties.33 	That is the service [of packing] of the clans of the Sons of Merari,<br>	including all their serving-tasks in the Tent of Appointment under the hand of Itamar son of Aharon the priest.34 @ 	So Moshe, Aharon and the leaders of the community counted all the Sons of Kehat,<br>	by their clans, by their Fathers’ House,35 	from the age of thirty years and upward until the age of fifty years,<br>	everyone that entered the working-force, for the serving-tasks in the Tent of Appointment.36 	Now those counted of them were, by their clans: two thousand seven hundred and fifty.37 	These are the accountings of the Kehatite clans, <br>	everyone that was serving

thirty years and upward until the age of fifty years,<br>	everyone who entered the working-force, for serving-tasks in the Tent of Appointment:44 	those counted of them were, by their clans, by their Fathers’ House:<br>	three thousand and two hundred.45 	These are the accountings of the clans of the Sons of Merari,<br>	whom Moshe and Aharon counted by order of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, by the hand of Moshe.46 @ 	All those counted, whom Moshe and Aharon and all the leaders of Israel counted, the Levites,<br>	by their clans, by their Fathers’ House,47 	from the age of thirty years and upward until the age of fifty years,<br>	everyone that entered to serve the serving-tasks of the service [of packing] and the serving-tasks of carrying, in the Tent of Appointment,48 	those of them counted were: eight thousand five hundred and eighty.49 	By order of <sc>Yhwh</sc> they were counted, by the hand of Moshe,<br>	each one, each one according to his service [of packing] and to his carrying-tasks, [with] his accountability,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe.5:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:2 	Command the Children of Israel,<br>	that they may send away from the camp<br>	anyone  <i>tzaraat,</i> anyone with a flow, and anyone <i>tamei</i> by a [dead] person.3 	Male and female, you are to send them away,<br>	outside the camp you are to send them away,<br>	so that they do not make their camp <i>tamei</i><br>	where I dwell in their midst.4 	Thus did the Children of Israel: they sent them away outside the camp,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had spoken to Moshe;<br>	thus did the Children of Israel.5 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:6 	Speak to the Children of Israel:<br>	A man or a woman—when they do any sin [committed by] humans<br>	by breaking-faith, yes, faith with <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	and that person realizes his guilt:7 	they are to confess their sin that they have done,<br>	and [each one] is to make-restitution for one’s guilt in its capital-amount,<br>	adding its fifth to it,<br>	and is to give it to the one toward whom one incurred-guilt.8 	Now if the one has no redeemer, to make-restitution of guilt-payment to him,<br>	the guilt-payment is to be restored to <sc>Yhwh</sc>, as the priest’s,<br>	besides the ram of purgation with which purgation is effected for him.9 	And any contribution, including any of the holy-offerings of the Children of Israel that they bring-near for the priest,<br>	shall be his.10 	So each one&mdash;his holy-offerings shall be his;<br>	for each one, what he gives to the priest, shall be his.11 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:12 	Speak to the Children of Israel and say to them:<br>	Any man, any man whose wife strays<br>	and breaks-faith, yes, faith with him,13 	in that a man lay with her, [with] an emission of seed,<br>	and it was hidden from the eyes of her husband,<br>	—she concealed herself, since she had made-herself-<i>tamei</i>—<br>	and since there was no witness against her, she was not apprehended—14 	and a rush of zealous-rage comes over him,<br>	and he feels rage toward his wife, she having made-herself-<i>tamei;</i><br>	or rush of zealous-rage comes over him15 	and he feels rage toward his wife, though she did not make-herself-<i>tamei</i>—<br>	the man is to bring his wife to the priest.<br>	He is to bring a near-offering for her: <br>	a tenth of an <i>efa</i> of barley meal;<br>	there is not to be poured on it any oil, there is not to be put on it any frankincense,<br>	for it is a grain-gift of rage,<br>	grain-gift of reminding that reminds of iniquity.16 	The priest is to bring her near<br>	and have her stand before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>;17 	then the priest is to take holy water in an earthenware vessel,<br>	and from the dirt that will be on the floor of the Dwelling<br>	the priest is to take and place [it] in the water.18 	When the priest has had the woman stand before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	he is to loosen [the hair of] the woman’s head<br>	and is to place on her palms the grain-gift of reminding <br>	—it is a grain-gift of rage!—<br>	and in the hand of the priest is to be the Water of Bitterness Bringing the Bane.19 	The priest is to have her swear and is to say to the woman:<br>	If a man did not lie with you,<br>	and if you did not stray to make-yourself-<i>tamei</i> under your husband[’s authority],<br>	be clear from this Water of Bitterness Bringing the Bane!20 	But you, if you strayed under your husband[’s authority],<br>	if you made-yourself-<i>tamei,</i><br>	and a man gave you his emission, other than your husband:21 	then the priest is to have the woman swear the oath-curse,<br>	and the priest is to say to the woman:<br>	May <sc>Yhwh</sc> make you a curse and a cause-for-oath amid your kinspeople,<br>	when <sc>Yhwh</sc> makes your thigh fall and your belly swell;22 	may this Water of Bitterness enter your innards,<br>	to cause the belly to swell and the thigh to fall!<br>	And the woman is to say: Amen! Amen!23 	Then the priest is to write these curses in a record<br>	and is to blot [them] into the Water of Bitterness;24 	he is to make the woman drink the Water of Bitterness Bringing the Bane,<br>	so that the Water Bringing the Bane may enter her, for “bitterness.”25 	Then the priest is to take from the hand of the woman the grain-gift of rage,<br>	he is to elevate the grain-gift before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, <br>	and is to bring it near, to the altar.26 	The priest is to scoop out of the grain-gift its reminder-portion,<br>	and is to turn it into smoke upon the altar;<br>	after that he is to make the woman drink the water.27 	When he has had her drink the water, it shall be:<br>	if she made-herself-<i>tamei</i><br>	and broke-faith, yes, faith with her husband,<br>	the Water Bringing the Bane shall enter her, for “bitterness,”<br>	her belly shall swell and her thigh shall fall,<br>	and the woman shall become an object-of-curse among her kinsfolk.28 	But if the woman did not make-herself-<i>tamei</i><br>	and she is pure,<br>	she is to be cleared and she may-bear-seed, yes, seed.29 	This is the Instruction [regarding] cases-of-zealous-rage,<br>	when a woman strays under her husband[’s authority]<br>	and makes-herself-<i>tamei,</i>30 	or when there comes over a man a rush of zealous-rage, so that he feels rage toward his wife:<br>	he is to have the woman stand before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	and the priest is to perform regarding her [according to] all this Instruction.31 	The man shall be clear of iniquity,<br>	but that woman shall bear her iniquity.6:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:2 	Speak to the Children of Israel and say to them:<br>	A man or a woman—when one sets oneself apart, by vowing the vow of a Nazirite/Consecrated-One, to consecrate-oneself for <sc>Yhwh</sc>:3 	from wine and from beer one is to consecrate oneself;<br>	fermentation of wine and fermentation of beer one is not to drink,<br>	any liquid of grapes one is not to drink,<br>	and grapes, moist or dried, one is not to eat.4 	All the days of one’s being consecrated,<br>	anything that is made from the vine of wine, from seeds to skin, one is not to eat.5 	All the days of one’s vow of being consecrated<br>	a razor is not to go-across one’s head;<br>	until the fulfilling of days that one is consecrated for <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	holy shall one remain;<br>	one is to grow loose the hair on one’s head.6 	All the days that one consecrates-oneself for <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	near a dead person one is not to come—7 	[even] for one’s father or one’s mother, one’s brother or one’s sister;<br>	one is not to make-oneself-<i>tamei</i> by them when they die,<br>	for [hair] consecrated for one’s God is upon one’s head.8 	All the days of one’s being-consecrated,<br>	one is holy to <sc>Yhwh</sc>.9 	Now if a dead [person] has died near one<br>	suddenly, all-of-a-sudden,<br>	so that one makes-<i>tamei</i> the consecrated [hair of one’s] head,<br>	one is to shave one’s head on the day of one’s becoming-pure;<br>	on the seventh day one is to shave it.10 	Now on the eighth day<br>	one is to bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest,<br>	to the entrance of the Tent of Appointment.11 	The priest is to make one as a <i>hattat</i>/decontamination-offering, and one as an offering-up;<br>	he is to effect-purgation for one,<br>	in that one became-contaminated by the [dead] person.<br>	One is to make one’s head holy [again] on that day,12 	and is to reconsecrate to <sc>Yhwh</sc> the days of one’s being consecrated, bringing a lamb in its [first] year as an <i>asham/compensation-offering.<br>	The former days are to be [considered] fallen-away,<br>	since one’s state-of-consecration became <i>tamei</i>.13 @ 	Now this is the Instruction [regarding] the Consecrated One:<br>	On the day that one’s days of being consecrated are fulfilled,<br>	one is to be brought to the entrance of the Tent of Appointment;14 	one is to bring near as one’s near-offering to <sc>Yhwh</sc>:<br>	a lamb in its [first] year, wholly-sound, one, as an offering-up,<br>	and one ewe-lamb in its [first] year, wholly-sound, as a <i>hattat-</i>offering, and one ram, wholly-sound, as a <i>shalom</i>-offering,15 	and a basket of <i>matzot</i> of flour, round-loaves mixed with oil,<br>	and wafers of <i>matzot</i> spread with oil,<br>	[as well as] their grain-gift and their poured-offerings.16 	The priest is to come near before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	and is to sacrifice his <i>hattat-</i>offering and his offering-up,17 	and the ram he is to make as a sacrifice of <i>shalom</i> to <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	together with the basket of <i>matzot;</i><br>	then the priest is to make his grain-gift and his poured-offering.18 	The Consecrated One is then to shave, at the entrance of the Tent of Appointment, one’s consecrated head,<br>	and is to take the hair of one’s consecrated head <br>	and put [it] on the fire that is under the sacrifice of <i>shalom.</i>19 	The priest is to take the shoulder of the ram, boiled,<br>	and one loaf of <i>matza</i> from the basket,<br>	and one wafer of <i>matza,</i><br>	and is to put [them] on the palms of the Consecrated One, after one’s shaving of one’s consecrated [hair].20 	The priest is to elevate them as an elevation-offering, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>—<br>	it is a holy-offering for the priest—<br>	on top of the breast of the elevation-offering and on top of the thigh of the contribution,<br>	and after [that] the Consecrated One may drink wine.21 	This is the Instruction [regarding] the Consecrated One<br>	who vows a near-offering to <sc>Yhwh</sc> in addition to one’s [requirement of] consecration,<br>	aside from what one’s hand can reach:<br>	according to the vow that one has vowed, thus is one to make, in addition to the instructed-requirements of one’s consecration.22 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:23 	Speak to Aharon and to his sons, saying:<br>	Thus are you to bless the Children of Israel;<br>	say to them:<br>24 @ 		May <sc>Yhwh</sc> bless you and watch over you!25 		May <sc>Yhwh</sc> shine his face toward you and favor you!26 		May <sc>Yhwh</sc> lift up his face toward you and grant you <i>shalom</i>!27 @ 	So are they to put my name upon the Children of Israel,<br>	that I myself may bless them.7:1 @ 	Now it was, at the time that Moshe finished setting up the Dwelling,<br>	he anointed it and hallowed it, with all its implements, <br>	and the altar, with all its implements;<br>	he anointed them and he hallowed them.2 	Then brought-near the exalted-leaders of Israel, the heads of their Fathers’ House—3 	they are the leaders of the tribes, they are those who stand over the counting—<br>	they brought their near-offering before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>:<br>	six litter wagons and twelve cattle,<br>	a wagon for [every] two leaders and an ox for [each] one.<br>	And they brought them near to the Dwelling.4 	Then <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe, saying:5 	Take [these] from them,<br>	that they may serve for the service [of transport] of the Tent of Appointment,<br>	and give them to the Levites, each one according to his serving-tasks.6 	Moshe took the wagons and the cattle<br>	and gave them to the Levites.7 	Two wagons and four cattle he gave to the Sons of Gershon, according to their serving-orders,8 	and four wagons and eight cattle he gave to the Sons of Merari, according to their serving-orders,<br>	under the hand of Itamar son of Aharon the priest,9 	but to the Sons of Kehat he did not give [any],<br>	for the service [of transport] of the holy-things is theirs, <br>	by shoulder they are to carry [them].10 	The leaders brought near the initiation-offering of the altar,<br>	at the time of its being anointed.<br>	And [when] the leaders brought near their near-offering before the altar,11 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	One leader per day, one leader per day, let them bring near their near-offering, <br>	for the initiation of the altar.12 	So he who brought near his near-offering on the first day was:<br>	Nahshon son of Amminadav, of the tribe of Yehuda.13 	His near-offering:<br>	one dish of silver, thirty and a hundred its <i>shekel</i>-weight,<br>	one bowl

Levites.11 	Aharon is to elevate the Levites as an elevation-offering, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	on behalf of the Children of Israel,<br>	that they may serve the serving-tasks of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.12 	Then the Levites are to lean their hands<br>	on the head of the bulls;<br>	they are to assign the one as a <i>hattat-</i>offering and the other as an offering-up, to <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	to effect-ransom for the Levites.13 	And you are to have the Levites stand before Aharon and before his sons<br>	and are to elevate them as an elevation-offering to <sc>Yhwh</sc>.14 	Now you are to separate the Levites from the midst of the Children of Israel;<br>	mine are the Levites to be!15 	After that the Levites may enter into the service of the Tent of Appointment,<br>	when you have purified them and elevated them as an elevation-offering.16 	For given over, given over are they to me from the midst of the Children of Israel,<br>	in place of the breacher of every womb, the firstborn of every one of the Children of Israel;<br>	I have taken them for myself.17 	For mine is every firstborn among the Children of Israel,<br>	of man and of beast;<br>	at the time that I struck down every firstborn in the land of Egypt,<br>	I declared-them-holy for myself.18 	Now I take the Levites <br>	in place of every firstborn from the Children of Israel,19 	and I give over the Levites, [to be] given over to Aharon and to his sons<br>	from the midst of the Children of Israel,<br>	to serve the serving-tasks of the Children of Israel in the Tent of Appointment,<br>	and to effect-ransom for the Children of Israel,<br>	that there not be among the Children of Israel any plague<br>	when the Children of Israel encroach on the holy-things.20 	Moshe, Aharon, and the entire community of Israel did regarding the Levites<br>	exactly as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe regarding the Levites,<br>	thus they did regarding them, the Children of Israel.21 	The Levites decontaminated-themselves and scrubbed their garments;<br>	Aharon elevated them as an elevation-offering before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	and Aharon effected-purgation for them, to purify them.22 	After that the Levites entered to serve their serving-tasks in the Tent of Appointment,<br>	in the presence of Aharon and in the presence of his sons:<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe regarding the Levites, thus they did regarding them.23 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:24 	This is what [is to be done] regarding the Levites:<br>	from the age of five and twenty years and upward,<br>	they are to enter the working-force, to join-the-force in the serving-tasks of the Tent of Appointment;25 	and from the age of fifty years, <br>	they are to retire from the force for the serving-tasks,<br>	and shall not serve anymore.26 	They may attend upon their brothers in the Tent of Appointment,<br>	to keep the maintenance-duty,<br>	but serving-tasks they are not to serve.<br>	Thus are you to do regarding the Levites in reference to their duties.9:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe in the Wilderness of Sinai,<br>	in the second year of their going out from the land of Egypt,<br>	in the first month,<br>	saying:2 	The Children of Israel are to make the Passover-offering at its appointed-time:3 	on the fourteenth day of this month,<br>	between the setting-times,<br>	you are to make it at its appointed-time;<br>	according to all its laws, according to all its regulations, you are to make it.4 	So Moshe spoke [instructions] to the Children of Israel, to make the Passover-offering.5 	And they made the Passover-offering<br>	in the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month,<br>	between the setting-times,<br>	in the Wilderness of Sinai.<br>	Exactly as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe,<br>	thus the Children of Israel did.6 	But there were some men who were <i>tamei</i> by reason of a [dead] human person,<br>	and so were not able to make the Passover-offering on that day;<br>	 they came near before Moshe and before Aharon on that day,7 	and those men said to him:<br>	We are <i>tamei</i> by reason of a [dead] human person;<br>	[but] why should we be restrained<br>	by not [being allowed] to bring near the near-offering of <sc>Yhwh</sc> in its appointed-time in the midst of the Children of Israel?8 	Moshe said to them:<br>	Stand by, and let me hear <br>	what <sc>Yhwh</sc> shall command regarding you.9 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:10 	Speak to the Children of Israel, saying:<br>	A man, [any] man when he is <i>tamei</i> by reason of a [dead] person<br>	or is on a long journey, <br>	among you or among your generations,<br>	and makes a Passover-offering to <sc>Yhwh</sc>:11 	in the second month, on the fourteenth day, between the setting-times,<br>	he is to make it;<br>	together with<i> matza</i> and bitter-herbs they are to eat it.12 	They are not to leave any of it until morning,<br>	a bone is not to be broken from it,<br>	according to all the law of the Passover-offering they are to make it.13 	But a man who is [ritually] pure, or who has not been on a journey,<br>	and holds back from making the Passover-offering:<br>	cut off will that person be from his kinspeople,<br>	for the near-offering of Passover for <sc>Yhwh</sc> he has not brought near at its appointed-time;<br>	his sin he is to bear, that man!14 	Now when a sojourner sojourns with you<br>	and makes a Passover-offering to <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	according to the law of the Passover-offering and according to its regulation,<br>	thus he is to make [it].<br>	One law is there to be for you, for the sojourner and for the native of the land.15 @ 	Now at the time that the Dwelling was set up,<br>	the cloud covered the Dwelling over the Tent of the Testimony,<br>	and after sunset it remained over the Dwelling,<br>	as the appearance of fire, until daybreak.16 	Thus it was regularly:<br>	the cloud would cover it,<br>	an appearance of fire at night.17 	According as the cloud was lifted up from the tent,<br>	after that the Children of Israel would march on,<br>	and in the place that the cloud would take-up-dwelling,<br>	there the Children of Israel would encamp.18 	By order of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, the Children of Israel would march on,<br>	and by order of <sc>Yhwh</sc> they would encamp;<br>	all the days that the cloud dwelt above the Dwelling they would remain-in-camp.19 	Now when the cloud lingered over the Dwelling for many days,<br>	the Children of Israel would keep the charge of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	and would not march on.20 	At such [times] as the cloud remained for a number of days over the Dwelling,<br>	by order of <sc>Yhwh</sc> they would remain-in-camp,<br>	and by order of <sc>Yhwh</sc> they would march on.21 	At such [times] as the cloud remained from sunset until daybreak,<br>	when the cloud lifted at daybreak, they would march on.<br>	Whether by day or by night,<br>	when the cloud lifted, they would march on.22 	Whether two days or a month or a year-of-days,<br>	when the cloud lingered over the Dwelling, dwelling over it,<br>	the Children of Israel would remain-in-camp, and would not march on;<br>	at its lifting up, they would march on.23 	By order of <sc>Yhwh</sc> they would encamp,<br>	and by order of <sc>Yhwh</sc> they would march on;<br>	the charge of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, they would keep,<br>	by order of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, through the hand of Moshe.10:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:2 	Make yourself two trumpets of silver,<br>	of hammered-work you are to make them;<br>	they are to be for you for calling together the community<br>	and for [signaling] the marching of the camps.3 	When you sound-a-blast on them,<br>	there shall come together before you the entire community,<br>	at the entrance of the Tent of Appointment.4 	Now if [only] one [blast] is sounded,<br>	there shall come-together before you the leaders, the heads of the divisions of Israel;5 	but if you sound a trilling blast,<br>	then shall march forward the camps encamped on the east.6 	If you sound a second trilling blast,<br>	then shall march forward the camps encamped on the south.<br>	Trilling blasts are to be sounded for their marching forward,7 	but to assemble the assembly, you are to sound [short blasts], you are not to [blow] trills.8 	So the Sons of Aharon, the priests, are [the ones] to sound [blasts] on the trumpets;<br>	they shall be for you as a law for the ages, throughout your generations.9 	And when you enter into battle in your land against an attacker who attacks you,<br>	blow trilling [blasts] on the trumpets,<br>	so that you may be brought-to-mind before <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God<br>	and delivered from your enemies.10 	And on the day[s] of your rejoicing, your appointed-times, and the heads of your months,<br>	you are to sound [blasts] on the trumpets<br>	together with your offerings-up and together with your sacrifices of <i>shalom;</i><br>	they shall be of you a reminder, before your God—<br>	I am <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God!11 @ 	Now it was, in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth of the month,<br>	that the cloud went up from above the Dwelling of the Testimony,12 	and the Children of Israel marched forth on their marches, from the Wilderness of Sinai.<br>	The cloud came-to-dwell in the Wilderness of Paran.13 	They marched first, by order of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, through the hand of Moshe:14 		the contingent of the camp of Yehuda marched forward first, by their forces; over its forces: Nahshon son of Amminadav.15 	And over the forces of the tribe of the Sons of Yissakhar: Netan’el son of Tzu’ar.16 	And over the forces of the tribe of the Sons of Zevulun: Eliav son of Heilon.17 	Once the Dwelling was taken down,<br>	there would march the Sons of Gershon and the Sons of Merari,<br>	carriers of the Dwelling.18 	There would march the contingent of the camp of Re’uven, by their forces;<br>	over its forces: Elitzur son of Shedei’ur.19 	And over the forces of the tribe of the Sons of Shim’on: Shelumiel son of Tzurishaddai.20 	And over the forces of the tribe of the Sons of Gad: Elyasaf son of De’uel.21 	There would march the Kehatites, carriers of the holy-things;<br>	they set up the Dwelling by [the time] they came.22 	There would march the contingent of the camp of the Sons of Efrayim, by their forces;<br>	over its forces: Elishama son of Ammihud.23 	And over the forces of the tribe of the Sons of Menashe: Gamliel son of Pedahtzur.24 	And over the forces of the tribe of the Sons of Binyamin: Avidan son of Gid’oni.25 	There would march the contingent of the camp of the Sons of Dan,<br>	rear-guard of all the camps, by their forces;<br>	over their forces: Ahi’ezer son of Ammishaddai.26 	And over the forces of the tribe of the Sons of Asher: Pag’iel son of Okhran.27 	And over the forces of the tribe of the Sons of Naftali: Ahira’ son of Einan.28 @ 	These were the marching-groups of the Children of Israel by their deployed-forces;<br>	thus did they march.29 @ 	Now Moshe said to Hovav son of Re’uel the Midyanite, Moshe’s father-in-law:<br>	We are marching to the place about which <sc>Yhwh</sc> promised:<br>	that-one I will give to you;<br>	go with us and we will do-good for you,<br>	for <sc>Yhwh</sc> has promised good-things for Israel.30 	He said to him:<br>	I will not go,<br>	but rather to my land and to my kindred I will go.31 	He said:<br>	Pray do not leave us, <br>	for after all, you know our [best place to] encamp in the wilderness,<br>	you shall be as eyes for us!32 	So it will be, if you go with us,<br>	so it will be: <br>	[from] that goodness with which <sc>Yhwh</sc> will do-good for us, we will do-good for you!33 @ 	They marched from the mountain of <sc>Yhwh</sc> a journey of three days,<br>	[with] he Coffer of <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> covenant marching before them,<br>	a journey of three days,<br>	to scout out a resting-place for them.34 	Now the cloud of <sc>Yhwh</sc> is over them by day,<br>	as they march from the camp.35 	And it was, whenever the Coffer was to march on, that Moshe would say:<br> @ 		Arise [for battle], O <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>		that your enemies may scatter,<br>		that those who hate you may flee before you!36 @ 	And when it would rest, he would say:<br> @ 		Return, O <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>		[you of] the myriad divisions of Israel!11:1 @ 	Now the people were like those-who-grieve over ill-fortune, in the hearing of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.<br>	When <sc>Yhwh</sc> heard, his anger flared up,<br>	and there blazed against them a fire of <sc>Yhwh</sc> <br>	and ate up the edge of the camp.2 	The people cried out to Moshe<br>	and Moshe interceded to <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	and the fire abated.3 	So they called the name of that place: Tav’era/Blaze,<br>	for [there] had blazed against them fire of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.4 	Now the gathered-riffraff that were among them<br>	had a craving, a hunger-craving,<br>	and moreover the Children of Israel wept again and said:<br>	Who will give us meat to eat?5 	We recall the fish that we used to eat in Egypt for free,<br>	the cucumbers, the watermelons,<br>	the green-leeks, the onions, and the garlic!6 	But now, our throats are dry;<br>	there is nothing at all<br>	except for the <i>mahn</i> before our eyes!7 	—Now the <i>mahn</i> is like seed of coriander,<br>	its aspect like the aspect of bdellium.8 	The people would roam around and collect it, <br>	grind it in millstones or crush it in a crusher,<br>	boil it in a pot, and make it into cakes,<br>	so that its taste was like the taste of [something] rich [made with] oil.9 	And when the dew came down on the camp at night,<br>	the <i>mahn</i> would come down on top of it.—10 	Moshe heard the people weeping by their clans,<br>	each one at the entrance to his tent.<br>	Now <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> anger flared up exceedingly,<br>	and in the eyes of Moshe [it was] ill.11 	Moshe said to <sc>Yhwh</sc>:<br>	Why have you dealt-ill with your servant?<br>	Why have I not found favor in your eyes,<br>	[that you] have placed the burden of this entire people on me?12 	Did I myself conceive this entire people,<br>	or did I myself give birth to it,<br>	that you should say to me,<br>	Carry it in your bosom<br>	as a nursing-parent carries a suckling-child,<br>	to the soil about which you swore to their fathers?13 	From where should I [get] meat to give to this entire people,<br>	when they weep on me, saying:<br>	Give us meat so that we may eat!14 	I am not able, I alone, to carry this entire people,<br>	for it is too heavy for me!15 	If thus you deal with me,<br>	pray kill me, yes, kill me,<br>	if I have found favor in your eyes,<br>	so that I do not have to see my ill-fortune!16 	Then <sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe:<br>	Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel,<br>	of whom you know that they are elders of the people and its officers;<br>	and take them to the Tent of Appointment<br>	and station them there with you.17 	I will come down and speak with you there,<br>	and I will extend from the rushing-spirit that is upon you<br>	and place it upon them;<br>	then they will carry along with you the burden of the people,<br>	so that you will not [have to] carry it, you alone.18 	Now to the people you are to say:<br>	Hallow yourselves for the morrow<br>	that you may eat meat,<br>	for you have wept in the ears of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, saying:<br>	Who will give us meat to eat?<br>	For it was better for us in Egypt!<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> will give you meat, and you shall eat it:19 	not for [only] one day shall you eat it, and not for two days,<br>	not for five days or for ten days or [even] for twenty days—20 	[but] for a monthful of days,<br>	until it comes out of your nostrils<br>	and becomes for you something-disgusting,<br>	because you have spurned <sc>Yhwh</sc> who is among you,<br>	by weeping before him, saying:<br>	Why, now, did we leave Egypt?21 	Moshe said:<br>	Six hundred thousand on foot<br>	are the fighting-people among whom I am,<br>	yet you, you say:<br>	Meat I will give them,<br>	and they are to eat [it] for a monthful of days?!22 	Are there flocks and herds that may be slaughtered for them,<br>	that they would find-them-sufficient?<br>	Or are there all the fish of the sea to be caught for them,<br>	that they would find-them-sufficient?23 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Is the arm of <sc>Yhwh</sc> too short? <br>	Now you shall see whether my word happens for you or not.24 	Moshe went out and spoke to the people the words of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.<br>	He gathered seventy men from the elders of the people<br>	and had-them-stand around the tent.25 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> came down in a cloud<br>	and spoke to him,<br>	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> extended some of the rushing-spirit that was upon him<br>	and put it upon the seventy men, the elders;<br>	and it was, <br>	when the spirit rested upon them,<br>	that they ranted-like-prophets, but did not continue.26 	Now two men remained in the camp:<br>	the name of the one was Eldad,<br>	the name of the second, Medad,<br>	and the spirit rested upon them <br>	—they were among those recorded,<br>	but they had not gone out to the Tent—<br>	and they ranted-like-prophets in the camp.27 	A [certain] lad ran<br>	and told Moshe, he said:<br>	Eldad and Meidad are ranting-like-prophets in the camp!28 	Then Yehoshua son of Nun, Moshe’s attendant from his youth, spoke up;<br>	he said:<br>	My lord Moshe, contain them!29 	But Moshe said to him:<br>	Are you zealous for me?<br>	O who would give that all the people of <sc>Yhwh</sc> were prophets,<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> would put the rush-of-his spirit upon them!30 	Moshe took himself back to the camp,<br>	he and the elders of Israel;31 	and a rush-of-wind moved from <sc>Yhwh</sc> <br>	and swept in quails from the sea,<br>	they spread out over the camp <br>	as far as a day’s journey here and a day’s journey there, <br>	all around the camp,<br>	and about two cubits [deep] on the face of the ground.32 	The people arose all that day and all night, and all the morrow day<br>	and gathered the quail;<br>	the least gathered ten <i>homers.</i><br>	They spread them, spread them out, all around the camp.33 	The meat was still between their teeth,<br>	[with the supply] not yet exhausted,<br>	when the anger of <sc>Yhwh</sc> flared up among the people,<br>	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> struck down among the people an exceedingly great striking.34 	So they called the name of that place: Kivrot Ha-Taava/Burial-Places of the Craving,<br>	for there they buried the people who had-the-craving.35 	From Kivrot Ha-Taava the people marched to Hatzeirot,<br>	and they remained in Hatzeirot.12:1 @ 	Now Miryam spoke, and Aharon, against Moshe<br>	on account of the Cushite wife that he had taken [in marriage],<br>	for a Cushite wife had he taken.2 	They said:<br>	Is it only, solely through Moshe that <sc>Yhwh</sc> speaks?<br>	Isn’t it also through us that he speaks?<br>	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> heard.3 	Now the man Moshe was exceedingly humble,<br>	more than any human who was on the face of the earth.4 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> said suddenly to Moshe, to Aharon and to Miryam:<br>	Go out, the three of you, to the Tent of Appointment!<br>	So the three of them went out.5 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> descended in a column of cloud<br>	and stood at the entrance to the Tent;<br>	he called out: Aharon and Miryam!<br>	And the two of them went out.6 	He said:<br>	Pray hear my words:<br>	If there should be among-you-a-prophet of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	in a vision to him I make-myself-known,<br>	in a dream I speak with him.7 	Not so my servant Moshe:<br>	in all my house, he is trusted;8 	mouth to mouth I speak with him,<br>	in-plain-sight, not in riddles,<br>	and the form of <sc>Yhwh</sc> he beholds.<br>	So why were you not too awestruck<br>	to speak against my servant, against Moshe?9 	And the anger of <sc>Yhwh</sc> flared up against them,<br>	and he went off.10 	When the cloud turned away from above the Tent,<br>	here, Miryam had <i>tzaraat</i> like snow!<br>	Aharon faced Miryam,<br>	and here, she had <i>tzaraat</i>!11 	Aharon said to Moshe:<br>	Please, my lord,<br>	do not, pray, impose on us guilt-for-a-sin<br>	by which we were foolish, by which we sinned!12 	Do not, pray, let her be like a dead-child<br>	who, when it comes out of its mother’s womb,<br>	is eaten up in half its flesh!13 	Moshe cried out to <sc>Yhwh</sc>, saying:<br>	O God, pray, heal her, pray!14 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	If her father spat, yes, spat in her face,<br>	would she not be put-to-shame for seven days?<br>	Let her be shut up for seven days outside the camp,<br>	and afterward she may be gathered back.15 	So Miryam was shut up outside the camp for seven days,<br>	and the people did not march on until Miryam had been gathered back.16 	[Only] afterward did the people march on from Hatzeirot;<br>	they encamped in the Wilderness of Paran.13:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:2 	Send for yourself men,<br>	that they may scout out the land of Canaan<br>	that I am giving to the Children of Israel.<br>	One man, one man per tribe of their fathers, you are to send,<br>	each one a leader among them.3 	So Moshe sent them from the Wilderness of Paran, by order of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	all of them men[of standing]—<br>	heads of the Children of Israel were they.4 	And these were their names:<br>	for the tribe of Re’uven: Shammu’a son of Zakkur;5 	for the tribe of Shim’on: Shafat son of Hori;6 	for the tribe of Yehuda: Calev son of Yefunne;7 	for the tribe of Yissakhar: Yig’al son of Yosef;8 	for the tribe of Efrayim: Hoshe’a son of Nun;9 	for the tribe of Binyamin: Palti son of Rafu;10 	for the tribe of Zevulun: Gaddiel son of Sodi;11 	for the tribe of Yosef, for the tribe of Menashe: Gaddi son of Susi;12 	for the tribe of Dan: Ammiel son of Gemalli;13 	for the tribe of Asher: Setur son of Mikhael;14 	for the tribe of Naftali: Nahbi son of Vofsi;15 	for the tribe of Gad: Ge’uel son of Makhi.16 	These the names of the men<br>	whom Moshe sent to scout out the land<br>	—now Moshe called Hoshe’a son of Nun: Yehoshua.17 	Moshe sent them to scout out the land of Canaan;<br>	he said to them:<br>	Go up this way through the Negev/Parched-Land,<br>	and [then] you are to go up into the highlands.18 	And see the land—what it is [like],<br>	and the population that is settled in it:<br>	whether they are strong or weak,<br>	whether they are few or many;19 	and what the land is [like], where they are settled:<br>	whether it is good or ill;<br>	and what the towns are [like], where they are settled therein:<br>	whether encampments or fortified-places;20 	and what the land is [like]:<br>	whether it is fat or lean,<br>	whether there are trees in it or not.<br>	Exert yourselves,<br>	and take some of the fruit of the land<br>	—now these days were the days of the first ripe-grapes.21 	So they went up and scouted out the land,<br>	from the Wilderness of Tzyn as far as Rehov, coming toward Hamat.22 	They went up through the Negev<br>	and came as far as Hevron:<br>	there were Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai,<br>	the descendants of the Anakites.<br>	Now Hevron had been built seven years before Tzo’an of Egypt.23 	They came to the Wadi of Eshkol/Clusters<br>	and cut down from there a branch and one cluster of grapes<br>	—they had to carry it on a bar [held] by two—<br>	and some pomegranates and some figs.24 	That place they called: the Wadi of Clusters,<br>	on account of the cluster that the Children of Israel had cut down there.25 	They returned from scouting out the land<br>	at the end of forty days.26 	Then they went and came before Moshe, before Aharon, and before the entire community of the Children of Israel<br>	in the Wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh;<br>	they returned word to them and to the entire community,<br>	and let them see the fruit of the land.27 	Now they recounted to him, they said: <br>	We came to the land to which you sent us,<br>	and yes, it is flowing with milk and honey,<br>	and this is its fruit—28 	except that powerful are the people that are settled in the land,<br>	the cities are fortified, exceedingly large,<br>	and also the descendants of Anak did we see there!29 	Amalek is settled in the Negev land,<br>	and the Hittite and the Yevusite and the Amorite are settled in the highlands,<br>	and the Canaanite is settled by the Sea and hard by the Jordan!30 	Now Calev hushed the people before Moshe<br>	and said:<br>	Let us go up, yes, up, and possess it,<br>	for we can prevail, yes, prevail against it!31 	But the men who went up with him said:<br>	We are not able to go up against the population,<br>	for it is stronger than we!32 	So they gave out a [false] report of the land<br>	that they had scouted out<br>	to the Children of Israel, saying:<br>	The land that we crossed through to scout it out:<br>	it is a land that devours its inhabitants;<br>	all the people that we saw in its midst are men of [great] stature,33 	[for] there we saw the giants—the Children of Anak [come] from the giants—<br>	we were in our eyes like grasshoppers,<br>	and thus were we in their eyes!14:1 @ 	The entire community lifted up and let out their voice,<br>	and the people wept on that night.2 	And they grumbled against Moshe and against Aharon, all the Children of Israel;<br>	they said to them, the entire community:<br>	Would that we had died in the land of Egypt,<br>	or in this wilderness, would that we had died!3 	Now why is <sc>Yhwh</sc> bringing us to this land, to fall by the sword?<br>	Our wives and our little-ones will become plunder!<br>	Would it not be better for us to return to Egypt?4 	So they said, each one to his brother:<br>	Let us head back and return to Egypt!5 	Moshe and Aharon flung themselves on their faces<br>	before the entire assembled community of the Children of Israel.6 	Now Yehoshua son of Nun and Calev son of Yefunne,<br>	[alone] from among those who scouted out the land,<br>	tore their garments;7 	they said to the entire community of the Children of Israel, saying:<br>	The land that we crossed through, to scout it out—<br>	good is that land, exceedingly, exceedingly!8 	If <sc>Yhwh</sc> is pleased with us,<br>	he will bring us to this land and give it to us,<br>	a land that is flowing with milk and honey.9 	But: against <sc>Yhwh</sc>, do not rebel,<br>	and you—<br>	do not be afraid of the people of the land,<br>	for food-for-us are they!<br>	Their protector has turned away from them,<br>	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> is with us.<br>	Do not be afraid of them!10 	But the entire community of Israel intended to pelt them with stones.<br>	Now the Glory of <sc>Yhwh</sc> was seen at the Tent of Appointment<br>	by all the Children of Israel,11 	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Until when will this people scorn me?<br>	Until when will they not trust in me,<br>	despite all the signs that I have done among them?12 	Let me strike it down with pestilence and dispossess it,<br>	and I will make of you a nation greater and mightier [in number] than it!13 	But Moshe said to <sc>Yhwh</sc>:<br>	When they hear, the Egyptians,<br>	that you brought up this people with your power from its midst,14 	they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land.<br>	They have heard that you are <sc>Yhwh</sc> in the midst of this people,<br>	that eye to eye you were seen, O <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	with your cloud standing over them,<br>	in a column of cloud going before them by day,<br>	and in a column of fire by night.15 	But should you put this people to death as one man,<br>	then will say the nations that have heard of your fame, saying:16 	[It was] from want of <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> ability<br>	to bring this people into the land about which he swore to them,<br>	and so he slaughtered them in the wilderness!17 	So-now,<br>	pray let the power of my Lord [to forbear] be great,<br>	as you have promised, saying:18 	<sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	long-suffering and of much loyalty,<br>	bearing away iniquity and transgression,<br>	yet clearing, not clearing [the guilty],<br>	calling-to-account the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons<br>	to the third and to the fourth [generation]—19 	pray grant-pardon for the iniquity of this people, as your loyalty is great,<br>	just as you have been bearing [it] for this people<br>	from Egypt until now!20 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said:<br>	I grant-pardon, according to your words;21 	however, as I live,<br>	and as the Glory of <sc>Yhwh</sc> fills all the earth:22 	indeed, all the men who have seen my Glory and my signs<br>	that I did in Egypt and in the wilderness,<br>	and have tested me these ten times,<br>	and have not hearkened to my voice:23 	if they should see the land<br>	about which I swore to their fathers . . . !<br>	All who have scorned me will not see it!24 	But as for my servant, Calev,<br>	because there was another spirit in him, and he followed-me-fully,<br>	I will bring him into the land that he is about to enter,<br>	and his seed will possess it.25 	Now the Amalekite and the Canaanite are settled in the Lowlands; <br>	on the morrow, face about and march into the wilderness,<br>	by the Reed Sea Road.26 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe and Aharon, saying:27 	Until when for this evil community,<br>	that they stir-up-grumbling against me?<br>	The grumblings of the Children of Israel that they grumble against me, <br>	I have heard!28 	So say to them:<br>	As I live—the Utterance of <sc>Yhwh</sc>—<br>	if not as you have spoken in my ears,<br>	thus I do to you . . . !29 	In this wilderness your corpses shall fall,<br>	all of you counted [for battle], including all your number,<br>	from the age of twenty and upward,<br>	who have grumbled against me!30 	If [any of] you should enter the land over which I lifted my hand [in an oath]<br>	to have you dwell in it,<br>	except for Calev son of Yefunne and Yehoshua son of Nun . . . !31 	Your little-ones, whom you said would become plunder—<br>	I will let them enter,<br>	and they shall come to know the land that you have spurned.32 	But your corpses, yours,<br>	shall fall in this wilderness,33 	and your children shall graze in the wilderness for forty years;<br>	thus shall they bear your whoring,<br>	until your corpses come-to-an-end in the wilderness.34 	According to the number of days that you scouted out the land,<br>	forty days,<br>	[for each] day a year, [for each] day a year,<br>	you are to bear your iniquities,<br>	forty years;<br>	thus will you know my hostility!35 	I am <sc>Yhwh</sc>, I have spoken:<br>	If I do not do this to this whole evil community<br>	that has come-together against me . . . !<br>	In this wilderness they will come-to-an-end,<br>	there they will die.36 	So the men whom Moshe had sent to scout out the land<br>	returned and caused the entire community to grumble against him<br>	by bringing a [false] report about the land;37 	the men died,<br>	those bringing a report of the land, an ill one,<br>	in a plague, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.38 	But Yehoshua son of Nun and Calev son of Yefunne<br>	remained-alive from those men<br>	who had gone to scout out the land.39 	Moshe spoke all these words to the Children of Israel,<br>	and the people mourned, exceedingly.40 	They started-early in the morning<br>	and went up to the top of the highlands, saying:<br>	Here we are,<br>	let us go up to [attack] the place that <sc>Yhwh</sc> promised,<br>	for we have sinned!41 	But Moshe said:<br>	Why now do you cross the order of <sc>Yhwh</sc>?<br>	It will not succeed!42 	Do not go up, for <sc>Yhwh</sc> is not in your midst—<br>	that you not be defeated by your foes!43 	For the Amalekite and the Canaanite are there to face you,<br>	and you will fall by the sword, <br>	for since you have turned from [following] after <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> will not be with you!44 	But they went up recklessly to the top of the highlands, <br>	while the Coffer of the Covenant of <sc>Yhwh</sc> and Moshe did not move from amid the camp.45 	And the Amalekite and the Canaanite who were settled in those highlands came down,<br>	they struck them and crushed them, near Horma.15:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:2 	Speak to the Children of Israel <br>	and say to them:<br>	When you enter the land of your settling that I am giving you,3 	and make a fire-offering to <sc>Yhwh</sc>:<br>	an offering-up or a sacrifice,<br>	to make a vow-offering, or in free-will, or at your appointed-times,<br>	to make a soothing savor for <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	from the herd or from the flock,4 	the one bringing near his near-offering is to bring near to <sc>Yhwh</sc> as grain-gift:<br>	flour, a tenth-measure,<br>	mixed with a fourth of a <i>hin</i> of oil,5 	and wine for a poured-offering: a fourth of a <i>hin;</i><br>	you are to make it with the offering-up or the sacrifice,<br>	for [each] one sheep,6 	or for the ram, you are to make as a grain-gift:<br>	flour, two tenth-measures,<br>	mixed with oil, a third of a <i>hin,</i>7 	and wine for a poured-offering, a third of a <i>hin;</i><br>	you are to bring near a soothing savor for <sc>Yhwh</sc>.8 	And when you make the young of the herd as an offering-up or as a sacrifice,<br>	to make a vow-offering or a <i>shalom</i>-offering to <sc>Yhwh</sc>:9 	it is to be brought near with the young of the herd as a grain-gift: <br>	flour, three tenth-measures,<br>	mixed with oil, half a <i>hin,</i>10 	and wine you are to bring near as a poured-offering, half a <i>hin,</i><br>	as a fire-offering of soothing savor for <sc>Yhwh</sc>.11 	Thus is to be made with [each] one ox or with [each] one ram<br>	or with [any] lamb among the sheep or among the goats,12 	according to the number that you make [as sacrifice];<br>	thus are you to make for [each] one, according to their number.13 	Every native is to make these thus,<br>	to bring near a fire-offering of soothing savor for <sc>Yhwh</sc>.14 	Now when there sojourns a sojourner with you,<br>	or [one] who has been in your midst, throughout your generations,<br>	and he makes a fire-offering of soothing savor for <sc>Yhwh;</sc>;<br>	as you make [it], thus is he to make.15 	Assembly!<br>	One law for you and for the sojourner who takes-up-sojourn,<br>	a law for the ages, throughout your generations:<br>	as [it is for] you, so will it be [for] the sojourner before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.16 	One instruction, one regulation shall there be for you<br>	and for the sojourner who takes-up-sojourn with you!17 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:18 	Speak to the Children of Israel<br>	and say to them:<br>	When you enter the land that I am bringing you to,19 	it shall be<br>	that when you eat of the bread of the land,<br>	you are to set aside a contribution to <sc>Yhwh</sc>:20 	the premier-product of your kneading-troughs,<br>	round-loaves you are to set aside as a contribution;<br>	like the contribution of the threshing-floor,<br>	so you are to set it aside.21 	From the premier-product of your kneading-troughs<br>	you are to give to <sc>Yhwh</sc> a contribution,<br>	 throughout your generations.22 @ 	Now if you should err,<br>	not doing any of these commandments<br>	about which <sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe,23 	anything that <sc>Yhwh</sc> has commanded you, through the hand of Moshe,<br>	from the day that <sc>Yhwh</sc> commanded and forward, throughout your generations,24 	it shall be:<br>	if [away] from the eyes of the community it was done, by error,<br>	the entire community is to make [as sacrifice]<br>	one bull, a young of the herd, as an offering-up, as a soothing savor for <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	with its grain-gift and its poured-offering, according to regulation,<br>	and one hairy goat, as a <i>hattat-</i>offering.25 	The priest is to effect-purgation for the entire community of the Children of Israel,<br>	that there may be granting-of-pardon for them,<br>	for it was an error,<br>	but they have brought their near-offering,<br>	a fire-offering of soothing savor for <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	and their <i>hattat-</i>offering before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, on account of their error.26 	So there shall be granting-of-pardon for the entire community of the Children of Israel,<br>	and for the sojourner who sojourns in their midst,<br>	for [it was done] by the entire people in error.27 	Now if one person sins, in error,<br>	they are to bring near a she-goat, in its [first] year, as a <i>hattat</i>- offering.28 	The priest is to effect-purgation for the person that errs,<br>	in sinning, in erring, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	to effect-purgation for him, that he may be granted-pardon.29 	The native among the Children of Israel,<br>	and for the sojourner who sojourns in your midst:<br>	one instruction shall there be for you,<br>	for him that does [anything] in error.30 	But the person who does [anything] with a high hand<br>	among the native-born or among the sojourners,<br>	it is <sc>Yhwh</sc> whom they have blasphemed;<br>	cut off shall that person be from among his kinspeople,31 	for the word of <sc>Yhwh</sc> they have despised, and his commandment they have violated;<br>	cut off, cut off shall that person be—<br>	their iniquity is on them!32 @ 	Now when the Children of Israel were in the wilderness,<br>	they found a man picking wood on the Sabbath day.33 	They brought him near, those who found him picking wood,<br>	to Moshe and to Aharon, and to the entire community;34 	they put him under guard,<br>	for it had not been clarified what should be done to him.35 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	The man is to be put to death, yes, death;<br>	pelt him with stones, the entire community, outside the camp!36 	So they brought him, the entire community, outside the camp,<br>	and they pelted him with stones, so that he died,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe.37 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe, saying:38 	Speak to the Children of Israel and say to them<br>	that they are to make themselves tassels<br>	on the corners of their garments, throughout their generations,<br>	and are to put on the corner tassel a thread of blue-violet.39 	It shall be a tassel for you,<br>	that you may look at it<br>	and keep-in-mind all the commandments of <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	and observe them,<br>	that you not go scouting-around after your heart, after your eyes<br>	which you go whoring after;40 	in order that you may keep-in-mind<br>	and observe all my commandments,<br>	and [so] be holy to your God!41 	I am <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	who took you out of the land of Egypt, to be a God to you;<br>	I am <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God!16:1 @ 	Now there betook himself Korah son of Yitzhar son of Kehat son of Levi,<br>	and Datan and Aviram the sons of Eliav and On son of Pelet, the sons of Re’uven;2 	they rose up before Moshe<br>	with men-of-stature from the Children of Israel, fifty and two hundred,<br>	leaders of the community, those Called in the Appointed-Council, men of name.3 	They assembled against Moshe and against Aharon<br>	and said to them:<br>	Too much is yours!<br>	For the entire community, the entirety-of-them, are holy,<br>	and in their midst is <sc>Yhwh</sc>!<br>	Why then do you exalt yourselves over the assembly of <sc>Yhwh</sc>?4 	[When] Moshe heard, he flung himself on his face.5 	Then he spoke to Korah and to his entire community, saying:<br>	At daybreak<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> will make known who is his and who is holy<br>	and he will declare-him-near to him;<br>	the one that he chooses, he will declare-near to him.6 	This, do:<br>	take yourselves fire-pans,<br>	Korah and his entire community,7 	and place fire in them,<br>	and put incense on them, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, tomorrow.<br>	And it shall be:<br>	the man whom <sc>Yhwh</sc> chooses, <i>he</i> is the holy-one.<br>	Too much is yours, Sons of Levi!8 	And Moshe said to Korah:<br>	Now hearken, Sons of Levi:9 	Is it too little for you<br>	that the God of Israel has separated you from the community of Israel<br>	to bring you near to him,<br>	to serve the serving-tasks of the Dwelling of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	to stand before the community, to attend on them?10 	He has brought near you and all your brothers, the Sons of Levi, with you—<br>	would you seek the priesthood as well?11 	Truly,<br>	it is you and your entire community<br>	who come together against <sc>Yhwh</sc>—<br>	as for Aharon, what is [wrong] with him that you should grumble against him!12 	Moshe sent to call Datan and Aviram, the sons of Eliav,<br>	but they said: We will not go up!13 	Is it too little<br>	that you have brought us up from a land flowing with milk and honey<br>	to cause our death in the wilderness?<br>	that you should play-the-prince over us, even the prince?14 	Then too, not to a land flowing with milk and honey have you brought us,<br>	[nor] have you given us an inheritance of field and vineyard.<br>	The eyes of these men, would you gouge out?<br>	We will not go up!15 	Then Moshe became exceedingly upset; <br>	he said to <sc>Yhwh</sc>:<br>	Do not turn your face toward their grain-gift—<br>	not one donkey of theirs have I carried off;<br>	I have not done ill to one of them!16 	Moshe said to Korah:<br>	You and your entire community,<br>	be [there] before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	you and they and Aharon, tomorrow.17 	And take, each-man, his pan,<br>	place on them smoking-incense,<br>	and bring it near, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	each-man his pan,<br>	fifty and two hundred pans,<br>	and [also] you and Aharon, each-man his pan.18 	So they took each-man his pan,<br>	and placed on them fire,<br>	and put on them smoking-incense,<br>	and stood at the entrance to the Tent of Appointment, <br>	as [did] Moshe and Aharon.19 	And Korah and his entire community assembled against them,<br>	at the entrance to the Tent of Appointment.<br>	Now the Glory of <sc>Yhwh</sc> was seen by the entire community;20 	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe and to Aharon, saying:21 	Separate yourselves from the midst of this community,<br>	that I may finish them off in an instant!22 	They flung themselves on their faces and said:<br>	O God, God of the spirits of all flesh,<br>	when one man sins,<br>	at the entire community will you be furious?23 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:24 	Speak to the community, saying:<br>	Go up from around the dwelling-place of Korah, Datan and Aviram!25 	Moshe arose and went to Datan and Aviram,<br>	and there went after him the elders of Israel.26 	And he spoke to the community, saying:<br>	Pray turn away from the tents of these wicked men;<br>	do not touch anything that is theirs,<br>	lest you be swept away in all their sins!27 	They went up from the dwellings of Korah, Datan, and Aviram, all around.<br>	Now Datan and Aviram had come out, stationed at the entrance to their tents,<br>	with their wives, their children, and their little-ones.28 	Moshe said:<br>	By this you shall know<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> sent me to do all these deeds,<br>	that it was not from my [own] heart:29 	if like the death of all humans these [men] die,<br>	and the calling-to-account of all humans is accounted upon them,<br>	it is not <sc>Yhwh</sc> [who] has sent me.30 	But if <sc>Yhwh</sc> creates a new-creation,<br>	and the ground opens its mouth, and swallows up them and all that is theirs,<br>	and they go down alive into Sheol,<br>	then you will know<br>	that these men have scorned <sc>Yhwh</sc>.31 	Now it was, just as he finished speaking all these words,<br>	that the ground that was beneath them split;32 	the earth opened its mouth<br>	and swallowed up them and their households,<br>	all the human beings who belonged to Korah<br>	and all the property.33 	So they went down, they and all theirs,<br>	alive, to Sheol;<br>	the earth covered them,<br>	and they vanished from the midst of the assembly.34 	Now all Israel that were around them<br>	fled at [the sound of] their voice,<br>	for they said:<br>	Lest the earth swallow us up!35 	And fire went out from before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	and consumed the fifty and two hundred men,<br>	those bringing near the incense.17:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:2 	Speak to El’azar son of Aharon the priest,<br>	that he may set aside the pans from the burned-remains,<br>	and the fire-coals, scatter yonder,<br>	for they have become holy;3 	[as for] the pans of those-who-sinned, [at the cost of] their lives,<br>	make of them beaten plates, overlaid for the altar,<br>	for they were brought near before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	and have become-holy.<br>	Let them be a sign for the Children of Israel!4 	So El’azar the priest took<br>	the bronze pans that the burned-men had brought near,<br>	and he beat them as overlay for the altar,5 	as a reminder for the Children of Israel,<br>	in order that no outside man might come near<br>	who is not of the seed of Aharon<br>	to turn smoking-incense into smoke before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	and so that he not become like Korah and like his community,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke through the hand of Moshe to him.6 @ 	But all the Children of Israel grumbled on the morrow<br>	against Moshe and against Aharon, saying:<br>	It is you [who] caused the death of <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> people!7 	Now it was, when the community assembled against Moshe and against Aharon,<br>	that they turned toward the Tent of Appointment,<br>	and here, the cloud had covered it,<br>	and the Glory of <sc>Yhwh</sc> could be seen!8 	Then Moshe and Aharon came to the front of the Tent of Appointment.9 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:10 	Move aside from the midst of this community,<br>	that I may finish them off in an instant!<br>	They flung themselves upon their faces.11 	Moshe said to Aharon:<br>	Take [your] pan<br>	and place upon it fire from the altar, and put smoking-incense [there];<br>	go quickly to the community and effect-appeasement for them,<br>	for the fury is [still] going-out from the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>&mdash;<br>	the plague has begun!12 	Aharon took [it], as Moshe had spoken,<br>	and ran to the midst of the assembly:<br>	and here, the plague had begun among the people!<br>	So he put the smoking-incense [in it], and effected-appeasement for the people:13 	now he stood between the dead and the living,<br>	and the plague was held back.14 	Now those that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred,<br>	aside from those that died in the matter of Korah.15 	Aharon returned to Moshe, to the entrance of the Tent of Appointment,<br>	since the plague was held back.16 @ 	Now <sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:17 	Speak to the Children of Israel,<br>	take from them a staff, a staff [each] per Fathers’ House<br>	from all their leaders, for their Father’s House:<br>	twelve staffs,<br>	each-man—his name you are to write upon the staffs.18 	And the name of Aharon you are to write upon the staff of Levi,<br>	indeed, one staff for [each] head of their Fathers’ House.19 	You are to put them in the Tent of Appointment, before the Testimony,<br>	where I appoint-meeting with you.20 	Now it shall be:<br>	the man whom I choose, his staff will sprout;<br>	thus will I still from upon me<br>	the grumblings of the Children of Israel that they set grumbling against you [both].21 	Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel,<br>	and they gave him, all the leaders,<br>	a staff per [each] one leader, a staff per [each] one leader,<br>	for their Fathers’ House,<br>	twelve staffs,<br>	with the staff of Aharon in the midst of their staffs.22 	Moshe laid out the staffs before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	in the Tent of the Testimony.23 	Now it was on the morrow:<br>	when Moshe entered the Tent of the Testimony, <br>	here, it had sprouted, the staff of Aharon, of the House of Levi;<br>	it had put forth a sprouting-flower, it had blossomed a blossom, and it had ripened almonds!24 	Moshe brought out all the staffs from before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	to all the Children of Israel;<br>	they saw [them], and each-man took his staff.25 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Return the staff of Aharon before the Testimony<br>	to be safeguarded as a sign for the rebellious-folk, <br>	that their grumblings may be finished from me,<br>	so that they do not die!26 	Moshe did it;<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> commanded him, so he did.27 @ 	But the Children of Israel said to Moshe, saying:<br>	Here, we perish, we are lost, all of us lost!28 	Anyone who comes near, near [at all] to the Dwelling of <sc>Yhwh</sc> will die; <br>		will there be an end to our perishing?18:1 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Aharon:<br>	You and your sons and your father’s house along with you<br>	are to bear any iniquity [pertaining to] the Holy-Area;<br>	you and your sons after you<br>	are to bear any iniquity [pertaining to] your priesthood.2 	And also your brothers, the stock of Levi, the tribe of your father, bring near with you;<br>	they are to be joined to you and are to act-as-attendants for you,<br>	you and your sons along with you<br>	in front of the Tent of the Testimony.3 	They are to keep your charge and the charge of the entire Tent,<br>	but: to the implements of holiness and to the altar, they are not to come near,<br>	so that they do not die—so they, so you!4 	They are to be joined to you,<br>	that they may keep the charge of the Tent of Appointment,<br>	including all the serving-tasks of the Tent;<br>	an outsider is not to come near with you,5 	but you are to keep the charge of the Holy-Shrine and the charge of the altar,<br>	that there be no further fury against the Children of Israel.6 	Now I, I hereby take your brothers, the Levites,<br>	from the midst of the Children of Israel,<br>	for you [they are] a gift, given over for <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	for serving the serving-tasks of the Tent of Appointment.7 	And you and your sons with you<br>	are to be in charge of your priesthood,<br>	in every matter [pertaining to] the altar and [what is] inside the Curtain,<br>	and you are to do service;<br>	serving-tasks of special-grant I give your priesthood—<br>	any outsider who comes near will be put to death!8 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Aharon:<br>	Now I, I hereby give over to you the charge of my contributions,<br>	including all the holy-donations of the Children of Israel,<br>	to you I give them, as an anointed-share,<br>	and to your sons, as an allotment for the ages.9 	This shall be yours from the holiest holy-offerings, from the fire:<br>	including their every near-offering, including their every grain-gift, including their every <i>hattat-</i>offering<br>	and including their every <i>asham-</i>offering that they remit to me,<br>	it is a holiest holy-portion, for you and for your sons.10 	In the holiest state-of-holiness you are to eat it,<br>	every male may eat it,<br>	holy shall it be for you.11 	And this [too is] for you: their contributed gift<br>	including all the elevation-offerings of the Children of Israel,<br>	to you I give it over,<br>	and to your sons and to your daughters along with you,<br>	as an allotment for the ages;<br>	everyone ritually-pure in your house may eat it.12 	All your choicest shining-oil, all your choicest new-wine and grain,<br>	the premier-part that they give to <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	to you I give it.13 	The first-fruits of everything that is in their land, that they bring to <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	it is for you,<br>	everyone pure in your house may eat it.14 	Everything specially-devoted in Israel—<br>	it is for you.15 	Every breacher of a womb of all flesh<br>	that you bring near for <sc>Yhwh</sc>, of man and of beast,<br>	for you it shall be.<br>	However, you are to redeem, yes, redeem the firstborn of humans,<br>	and the firstborn of <i>tamei</i> animals you are to redeem.16 	And its redemption-price, from the age of a month you are to redeem,<br>	in your assessment: silver, five <i>shekels</i> by the<i> </i>Holy-Shrine <i>shekel</i>,<br>	—it is twenty grains.17 	However, the firstborn of oxen, the firstborn of sheep, or the firstborn of goats<br>	you are not to redeem,<br>	[already] holy are they,<br>	their blood you are to dash against the altar,<br>	and their fat you are to turn-into-smoke,<br>	a fire-offering, a soothing savor for <sc>Yhwh</sc>,18 	and their meat is to be for you;<br>	like the breast of the elevation-offering and like the right thigh<br>	shall it be for you.19 	All the contributions of the holy-things that the Children of Israel set aside for <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	I give to you and to your sons and to your daughters along with you<br>	as an allotment for the ages:<br>	it is a “covenant of salt” for the ages, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	for you and for your seed after you.20 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Aharon:<br>	In their land you are not to receive-inheritance,<br>	no portion-of-land shall be yours in their midst:<br>	I am your portion and your inheritance<br>	in the midst of the Children of Israel.21 	And to the Sons of Levi,<br>	here, I give over every tithe in Israel, as an inheritance,<br>	in exchange for their serving-tasks that they serve,<br>	the serving-tasks of the Tent of Appointment.22 	The Children of Israel are no longer to come near the Tent of Appointment,<br>	to bear sin, to die.23 	The Levite, <i>he</i> is to serve the serving-tasks of the Tent of Appointment,<br>	<i>they</i> will bear their iniquity&mdash;<br>	a law for the ages, throughout their generations:<br>	but in the midst of the Children of Israel they are not to inherit a [land-]inheritance.24 	For the tithing of the Children of Israel that they set aside for <sc>Yhwh</sc> as a contribution,<br>	I give over to the Levites as an inheritance;<br>	therefore I have said to them:<br>	in the midst of the Children of Israel they are not to inherit a [land-]inheritance.25 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:26 	To the Levites you are to speak, saying to them:<br>	When you take from the Children of Israel the tithe that I am giving you from them, as your inherited-share,<br>	you are to set aside from it as a contribution for <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	a tenth from the tithe;27 	it will be reckoned to you as your contribution,<br>	like grain from the threshing-floor,<br>	like fully-fermented [grapes] from the vat.28 	Thus you are to set aside, on your part, the contribution of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, <br>	from all your tithes that you take from the Children of Israel,<br>	and are to give from them the contribution of <sc>Yhwh</sc> to Aharon the priest.29 	From all your gifts<br>	you are to set aside all contributions forf <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	from all its choice-parts, <br>	its holy-part from it.30 	And you are to say to them:<br>	When you set aside the choice-part from it,<br>	it is to be reckoned for the Levites<br>	like the produce of the threshing-floor, like the produce of the vat.31 	You may eat it in any place, you and your household,<br>	for it is a wage for you,<br>	in exchange for your serving-tasks in the Tent of Appointment.32 	You will not bear on account of it [any] sin<br>	once you set aside its choice-part from it,<br>	that you not profane the holy-donations of the Children of Israel,<br>	and you do not die.19:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe and to Aharon, saying:2 	This is the law of the instructed-ritual<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> has commanded, saying:<br>	Speak to the Children of Israel,<br>	that they may take you a red cow, wholly-sound,<br>	that has in it no defect,<br>	that has not yet yielded to a yoke;3 	you are to give it to El’azar the priest,<br>	and it is to be brought forth, outside the camp,<br>	and is to be slaughtered in his presence.4 	El’azar the priest is to take some of its blood with his finger<br>	and is to sprinkle toward the face of the Tent of Appointment, some of its blood,<br>	seven times.5 	Then the cow is to be burned before his eyes;<br>	its hide, its flesh, and its blood<br>	along with its dung, are to be burned.6 	The priest is to take wood of cedar, and hyssop, and scarlet of worm,<br>	and is to throw [them] into the midst of the cow burning.7 	He is to scrub his garments, the priest, and is to wash his body in water,<br>	and afterward he may enter the camp,<br>	but the priest will remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset.8 	And he who burned it<br>	is to scrub his garments in water and is to wash his body in water,<br>	and remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset.9 	And a [ritually] pure man shall collect the ashes of the cow,<br>	and deposit them outside the camp<br>	in a pure place.<br>	It shall be for the community of the Children of Israel in safekeeping,<br>	as Waters of Undefilement;<br>	it is [for] decontamination.10 	The collector of the cow’s ashes is to scrub his garments<br>	and remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset.<br>	It shall be for the Children of Israel and for the sojourner who sojourns in their midst <br>	as a law for the ages:11 	he who touches a dead-body of any human person<br>	[shall be deemed] <i>tamei</i> for seven days.12 	Should he decontaminate himself with it on the third day and on the seventh day, then he is pure;<br>	if he does not decontaminate himself on the third day and on the seventh day, then he is not pure.13 	Anyone who touches a dead-body of any human person who has died,<br>	and does not decontaminate himself—<br>	the Dwelling of <sc>Yhwh</sc> has he made-<i>tamei,</i><br>	cut off shall that person be from Israel,<br>	since the Waters of Undefilement were not dashed on him;<br>	<i>tamei</i> shall he be, his <i>tum’a</i> [stays] within him!14 	This is the Instruction:<br>	A human who dies in a tent—<br>	anyone who enters the tent, and anyone who is in the tent,<br>	shall be <i>tamei</i> for seven days.15 	And any open vessel that has no cover tied down on it,<br>	it is <i>tamei</i>!16 	And anyone who touches, on the [open] field,<br>	one slain by the sword or a dead-body,<br>	or human bones or a burial-place,<br>	shall be <i>tamei</i> for seven days.17 	They are to take for the <i>tamei</i> one some dust of the burned <i>hattat-</i>offering,<br>	and they are to add to it living water, in a vessel.18 	He is to take hyssop and dip it into the water, the [ritually] pure one,<br>	he is to sprinkle [it] on the Tent and on all the implements<br>	and on the persons that were there,<br>	and on the one who touched the bones or the slain one or the dead-body or the burial-place.19 	Then the pure one is to sprinkle [it] on the <i>tamei</i> one on the third day and on the seventh day,<br>	thus decontaminating him on the seventh day;<br>	then he is to scrub his garments and wash with water,<br>	and be purified after sunset.20 	Now a man who becomes-<i>tamei</i> and does not decontaminate himself—<br>	cut off shall that person be from the midst of the assembly,<br>	for the Holy-Area of <sc>Yhwh</sc> has he made <i>tamei;</i><br>	Waters of Undefilement have not been dashed upon him;<br>	he is <i>tamei!</i>21 	It shall be for you as a law for the ages:<br>	the one-who-does-the-sprinkling from the Waters of Undefilement is to scrub his garments,<br>	and the one-who-touches the Waters of Undefilement shall remain <i>tamei</i> until sunset.22 	And anything that the <i>tamei</i> one touches becomes-<i>tamei</i>—<br>	the person who touches [it] shall remain-<i>tamei</i> until sunset.20:1 @ 	They came, the Children of Israel, the entire community,<br>	[to the] Wilderness of Tzyn,<br>	in the first month.<br>	The people stayed in Kadesh.<br>	Miryam died there,<br>	and she was buried there.2 	Now there was no water for the community,<br>	so they assembled against Moshe and against Aharon;3 	the people quarreled with Moshe,<br>	they said, saying:<br>	Now would that we had expired<br>	when our brothers expired before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>!4 	Now why did you bring the assembly of <sc>Yhwh</sc> into this wilderness,<br>	to die there,<br>	we and our cattle?5 	Now why did you make us go up from Egypt<br>	to bring us to this evil place,<br>	not a place of seeds and figs, vines and pomegranates<br>	—and water [there is] none to drink!6 	Moshe and Aharon came away from the presence of the assembly<br>	to the entrance to the Tent of Appointment,<br>	and flung themselves on their faces.<br>	The Glory of <sc>Yhwh</sc> was seen by them,7 	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:8 	Take the staff<br>	and assemble the community, you and Aharon your brother;<br>	you are to speak to the boulder before their eyes<br>	so that it gives forth its water.<br>	Thus you are to bring them out water from the boulder,<br>	that you may give-drink to the assembly and to their cattle.9 	So Moshe took the staff from before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	as he had commanded him.10 	And Moshe and Aharon assembled the assembly facing the boulder.<br>	He said to them:<br>	Now hear, [you] rebels,<br>	from this boulder must we bring you out water?11 	And Moshe raised his hand<br>	and struck the boulder with his staff, twice,<br>	so that abundant water came out,<br>	and the community and their cattle drank.12 	Now <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe and to Aharon:<br>	Because you did not have trust in me<br>	to treat-me-as-holy before the eyes of the Children of Israel,<br>	therefore:<br>	you [two] shall not bring this assembly into the land that I am giving them!13 	Those were the Waters of Meriva/Quarreling,<br>	where the Children of Israel quarreled with <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	and he was made holy through them.14 @ 	Moshe sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom:<br>	Thus says your brother Israel:<br>	You know [about] all the hardships that have found us:15 	our fathers went down to Egypt<br>	and we stayed in Egypt for many years,<br>	and Egypt ill-treated us and our fathers.16 	Now we cried out to <sc>Yhwh</sc>, and he hearkened to our voice,<br>	and he sent a messenger and brought us out of Egypt.<br>	So here we are at Kadesh, [the] town at the edge of your territory.17 	Pray let us cross through your land;<br>	we will not cross through field or through orchard, <br>	we will not drink water from wells;<br>	[on] the King’s Road we will march&mdash;;<br>	we will not turn aside right or left,<br>	until we have crossed through your territory.18 	But Edom said to him:<br>	You shall not cross through me,<br>	lest with the sword I come out to meet you!19 	The Children of Israel said to him:<br>	On the byway we will go up;<br>	if we drink your water, I and my livestock,<br>	I will give its selling-price—<br>	only [let it] not be a matter-of-dispute;<br>	on foot let me cross!20 	But he said:<br>	You shall not cross!<br>	And Edom went out to meet him<br>	with a heavy [host of] fighting-people and with a strong hand.21 	So Edom refused to give Israel [leave] to cross through his territory,<br>	and Israel turned away from him.22 @ 	They marched on from Kadesh,<br>	and they came, the Children of Israel, the entire community, to Hill’s Hill.23 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe and to Aharon at Hill’s Hill,<br>	by the border of the land of Edom,<br>	saying:24 	Let Aharon be gathered to his kinspeople,<br>	for he is not to enter the land that I am giving to the Children of Israel—<br>	since you [both] rebelled against my orders at the Waters of Meriva.25 	Take Aharon and El’azar his son<br>	and bring them up on Hill’s Hill;26 	strip Aharon of his garments and clothe El’azar his son in them.<br>	Aharon will be gathered and will die there.27 	So Moshe did as <sc>Yhwh</sc> commanded him:<br>	they went up Hill’s Hill before the eyes of the entire community;28 	and Moshe stripped Aharon of his garments and clothed El’azar his son in them.<br>	So Aharon died there on top of the hill.<br>	Moshe and El’azar came down from the hill,29 	and the entire community saw that Aharon had expired,<br>	so they wept for Aharon thirty days,<br>	the whole House of Israel.21:1 @ 	Now the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who sat [as ruler] in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming by the Atarim Road,<br>	so they waged battle against Israel and captured from them war-captives.2 	And Israel vowed a vow to <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	and said:<br>	If you will give, yes, give this people into my hand,<br>	I will devote their towns [to destruction].3 	Now <sc>Yhwh</sc> hearkened to the voice of Israel, and he gave [them] the Canaanites,<br>	and they devoted-them-to-destruction along with their cities;<br>	so they called the name of the place Horma/Destruction.4 @ 	They marched from Hill’s Hill by the Reed Sea Road,<br>	to go around the land of Edom,<br>	and the people’s temper became short on the way.5 	The people spoke against God and against Moshe:<br>	Why did you bring us up from Egypt to die in the wilderness?<br>	For there is no food and no water,<br>	and our throats loathe the wretched food!6 	So <sc>Yhwh</sc> sent upon the people vipers, burning-snakes;<br>	they bit the people,<br>	and many people of Israel died.7 	The people came to Moshe<br>	and said:<br>	We have sinned!<br>	For we have spoken against <sc>Yhwh</sc> and against you.<br>	Intercede to God, so that he may remove from us the vipers!<br>	So Moshe interceded on behalf of the people.8 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Make yourself a burning-snake and put it on a banner-pole;<br>	it shall be:<br>	whoever has been bitten and then sees it will live.9 	So Moshe made a viper of copper, and he put it on a banner-pole,<br>	and it was:<br>	if a viper bit someone<br>	and he looked upon the viper of copper, he would live.10 @ 	The Children of Israel marched on and encamped at Ovot.11 	They marched on from Ovot and encamped at Iyyei Ha-Avarim,<br>	in the wilderness that faces Moav,<br>	toward the rising of the sun.12 	From there they marched on and encamped at Wadi Zered.13 	From there they marched on and encamped across the Arnon that is in the wilderness,<br>	that goes out from the Amorite territory;<br>	for the Arnon is the border of Moav<br>	between Moav and the Amorites.14 	Therefore it is said in the Record of the Wars of <sc>Yhwh</sc>:<br> @ 		. . . Vahev in Sufa,<br>		the wadis, Arnon,15 		along with its canyon wadis<br>		that stretches along the settled-country of Ar,<br>		and leans on the territory of Moav.16 @ 	From there to Be’er/The Well;<br>	that is the well of which <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Gather the people, and I will give them water.17 @ 	Then Israel sang this song:<br> @ 		Spring up, O well, sing-in-chorus to it18 		—the well that was dug out by princes!<br>		—that was excavated by people’s nobles!<br>		—with scepter!<br>		—with their rods!<br> @ 	Now from the wilderness—to Mattana;19 	and from Mattana—to Nahaliel;<br>	and from Nahaliel—to Bamot/The Heights;20 	and from Bamot—to the valley that is at the Open-Country of Moav,<br>	the top of Pisga/the Summit,<br>	overlooking the face of the wasteland.21 @ 	Now Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying:22 	Let me cross through your land!<br>	We will not turn aside into field or vineyard,<br>	we will not drink well water;<br>	on the King’s Road we will march,<br>	until we have crossed your territory.23 	But Sihon would not give Israel [leave] to cross through his territory.<br>	Sihon gathered all his fighting-people<br>	and went out to meet Israel in the wilderness;<br>	he came to Yahatz and waged battle against Israel.24 	But Israel struck him with the mouth of the sword<br>	and took possession of his land,<br>	from the Arnon as far as the Yabbok, as far as the Children of Ammon,<br>	for strong is the territory of the Children of Ammon.25 	Israel took all these towns<br>	and Israel settled in all the Amorite towns—<br>	in Heshbon and in all her daughter-villages,26 	for Heshbon—it was the town of Sihon king of the Amorites.<br>	He had waged battle against a former king of Moav<br>	and had taken all his land from his hand, as far as the Arnon.27 	Therefore the bards say:<br> @ 		Come to Heshbon! Be built up; <br>		be established, Sihon’s town!28 		For fire went forth from Heshbon,<br>		flame from the city of Sihon,<br>		devouring Ar of Moav,<br>		the inhabitants of the heights of Arnon.29 		Woe to you, Moav!<br>		You have perished, people of Kemosh!<br>		His sons [become] fugitives,<br>		his daughters, captives<br>		of the king of the Amorites, Sihon.30 		We shot them&mdash;<br>		Heshbon perished as far as Divon,<br>		we desolated [them] as far as Nofah,<br>		fire as far as Medeva!31 @ 	Israel settled in the land of the Amorites.32 	And Moshe sent [men] to scout Ya’zer;<br>	they captured its daughter-villages<br>	and dispossessed the Amorites who were there.33 	Then they faced-about and went up the Bashan Road.<br>	Og king of Bashan went out to meet them,<br>	he and all his fighting-people in war, at Edre’i.34 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Do not be afraid of him,<br>	for into your hand I give him and all his people, and his land;<br>	you will do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites who sat [as ruler] in Heshbon.35 	So they struck him and his sons and all his people<br>	until not a survivor was left to him,<br>	and they took possession of his land.22:1 @ 	And the Children of Israel marched on and encamped in the Plains of Moav,<br>	across from Jordan-Jericho.2 @ 	Balak son of Tzippor saw<br>	all that Israel had done to the Amorites,3 	and Moav was in exceeding fear before the people, since they were so many;<br>	they felt dread before the Children of Israel.4 	Moav said to the elders of Midyan:<br>	Look now, this assembly will lick up everything around us like an ox licks up the green-things of the field!<br>	Now Balak son of Tzippor was king of Moav at that time.5 	He sent messengers to Bil’am son of Be’or, to Petor, which is beside the River [in] the land of the sons of his kinspeople,<br>	to call him, saying:<br>	Here, a people has come up out of Egypt;<br>	here, it covers the aspect of the land,<br>	and it has settled hard upon me!6 	So-now, pray go, curse this people for me,<br>	for it is too mighty [in number] for me!<br>	Perhaps I will prevail: we will strike it, so that I drive it from the land.<br>	For I know<br>	that whomever you bless is blessed,<br>	whomever you curse is cursed!7 	The elders of Moav and the elders of Midyan went,<br>	tokens-of-augury in their hand;<br>	they came to Bil’am and spoke Balak’s words to him.8 	He said to them:<br>	Spend the night here tonight,<br>	then I will bring back to you whatever word <sc>Yhwh</sc> speaks to me.<br>	The nobles of Moav stayed with Bil’am.9 	Now God came to Bil’am and said:<br>	Who are these men with you?10 	Bil’am said to God:<br>	Balak son of Tzippor, king of Moav, has sent to me:11 	Here, the people that came out of Egypt, it covers the aspect of the land!<br>	So-now, pray go, hex it for me&mdash;<br>	perhaps I will be able to wage battle against it and drive it away!12 	God said to Bil’am:<br>	You are not to go with them,<br>	you are not to curse the people,<br>	for it is blessed!13 	Bil’am arose at daybreak and said to Balak’s nobles:<br>	Go to your land,<br>	for <sc>Yhwh</sc> refuses to give-me-leave to go with you.14 	The nobles from Moav arose, they came to Balak and said:<br>	Bil’am refuses to go with us!15 	So Balak once again sent nobles,<br>	greater and more honored than those;16 	they came to Bil’am<br>	and said to him:<br>	Thus says Balak son of Tzippor:<br>	Pray do not hold back from going to me;17 	indeed, I will honor, yes, honor you exceedingly—<br>	anything that you say to me, I will do.<br>	Only: pray go, revile this people for me!18 	Bil’am answered, <br>	he said to the servants of Balak:<br>	If Balak were to give me his house’s fill of silver and gold<br>	I would not be able to cross the order of <sc>Yhwh</sc> my God<br>	to do [anything] small or great!19 	So now,<br>	pray stay here, you as well, tonight,<br>	that I may know<br>	what <sc>Yhwh</sc> will once again speak with me.20 	And God came to Bil’am at night,<br>	he said to him:<br>	Since it is to call you that the men have come,<br>	arise, go with them;<br>	but: only the word that I speak to you,<br>	that [alone] you may do.21 	Bil’am arose at daybreak,<br>	he saddled his she-ass<br>	and went with the nobles of Moav.22 	But <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> anger flared up because he was going,<br>	so <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> messenger stationed himself in the way as an adversary to him.<br>	Now he was riding on his she-ass, his two serving-lads with him.23 	And the she-ass saw <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> messenger<br>	stationed in the way,<br>	his sword drawn in his hand,<br>	so the she-ass turned aside from the way and went into the field.<br>	And Bil’am struck the she-ass<br>	to turn her back onto the way.24 	But <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> messenger stood in the furrow of the vineyards,<br>	a fence on this-side and a fence on this-side.25 	And the she-ass saw <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> messenger,<br>	so she pressed herself against the wall;<br>	she pressed Bil’am’s foot against the wall,<br>	and once again he struck her.26 	But <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> messenger once again crossed over,<br>	standing in a narrow place <br>	where there was no pathway to turn, right or left.27 	And the she-ass saw <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> messenger,<br>	so she crouched down beneath Bil’am.<br>	Bil’am’s anger flared up,<br>	and he struck the she-ass with his staff.28 	Then <sc>Yhwh</sc> opened the mouth of the she-ass<br>	and she said to Bil’am:<br>	What have I done to you<br>	that you have struck me [on] these three occasions?29 	Bil’am said:<br>	Because you have dealt-wantonly with me!<br>	If a sword had been in my hand,<br>	by now I would have killed you!30 	The she-ass said to Bil’am:<br>	Am I not your she-ass<br>	upon whom you have ridden from your past until this day?<br>	Have I ever been accustomed, accustomed to do thus to you?<br>	He said:<br>	No.31 	Then <sc>Yhwh</sc> uncovered Bil’am’s eyes<br>	and he saw <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> messenger stationed in the way,<br>	his sword drawn in his hand;<br>	he did homage and bowed low, to his nostrils.32 	<sc>Yhwh’s</sc> messenger said to him:<br>	For what [cause] did you strike your she-ass [on] these three occasions?<br>	Here, I came out as an adversary,<br>	for the way was rushed out against me.33 	The she-ass saw me,<br>	so she turned aside before me these three occasions.<br>	Had she not turned aside from me,<br>	by now, [it is] you I would have killed,<br>	and her I would have left-alive!34 	Bil’am said to <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> messenger:<br>	I have sinned,<br>	for I did not know that you were stationed to meet me in the way.<br>	But now, if it is evil in your eyes,<br>	I will head back.35 	<sc>Yhwh’s</sc> messenger said to Bil’am:<br>	Go with the men,<br>	but only the word that I speak to you,<br>	that [alone] you may speak! <br>	And so Bil’am went with Balak’s nobles.36 	And Balak heard that Bil’am was coming,<br>	so he went out to meet him,<br>	to Ir/Town of Moav that is by the Arnon border,<br>	that is at the far-edge of the border.37 	And Balak said to Bil’am:<br>	Did I not send, yes, send to you, to call you!<br>	Why did you not go to me?<br>	Am I truly not able to honor you?38 	Bil’am said to Balak:<br>	Here, I have come to you;<br>	but now,<br>	am I able, able to speak anything [myself]?<br>	The word that God puts in my mouth,<br>	that [alone] may I speak.39 	Now Bil’am went with Balak;<br>	they came to the village of Hutzot/Streets.40 	Balak slew oxen and sheep,<br>	and sent them out to Bil’am and to the nobles that were with him.41 	Now it was at daybreak:<br>	Balak took Bil’am and had him go up on the Heights of Baal,<br>	so that he could see from there the edge of the people.23:1 	Bil’am said to Balak:<br>	Build me here seven altars,<br>	and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.2 	Balak did as Bil’am had spoken to him;<br>	then Bil’am and Balak offered up a bull and a ram on [each] altar.3 	Bil’am said to Balak:<br>	Station yourself beside your offering-up, and I will go:<br>	perhaps <sc>Yhwh</sc> will encounter me in an encounter,<br>	the word of whatever he lets me see, I will report to you.<br>	So he went off by himself.4 	And God encountered Bil’am;<br>	he said to him:<br>	The seven altars I have arranged,<br>	and I have offered-up a bull and a ram on [each] altar.5 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> put words in Bil’am’s mouth<br>	and said:<br>	Return to Balak, and thus shall you speak.6 	So he returned to him,<br>	and here: he was standing alongside his offering-up,<br>	he and all the nobles of Moav.7 	He took up his discourse and said:<br>		From Aram, Balak led me,<br>		Moav’s king from the highlands of Kedem:<br>		Go, curse Yaakov for me,<br>		go, revile Israel!8 		How shall I revile [him]<br>		whom God has not reviled?<br>		How shall I denounce [him] <br>		whom <sc>Yhwh</sc> has not denounced?9 		Indeed, from the top of crags I see him:<br>		from hills I behold him:<br>		here, a people, alone-in-security it dwells,<br>		among the nations it does not need to come-to-reckoning.10 		Who can measure the dust of Yaakov,<br>		or [find a] number [for] the dust-clouds of Israel?<br>		May I die the death of the upright,<br>		may my future be like his!11 	Balak said to Bil’am:<br>	What have you done to me?<br>	To revile my foes I took you on,<br>	and here, you have blessed, yes, blessed [them]!12 	He answered and said:<br>	Is it not whatever <sc>Yhwh</sc> puts in my mouth,<br>	that [alone] I must take care to speak?13 	Balak said to him:<br>	Pray go with me to another place from where you can see them:<br>	only their edge will you see,<br>	all of them you will not see<br>	—hex them for me from there!14 	So he took him to the Field of Watchmen, to the top of the summit.<br>	He built seven altars<br>	and offered-up a bull and a ram on [each] altar.15 	Then he said to Balak:<br>	Station yourself here, alongside your offering-up;<br>	as for me, I will seek-an-encounter there.16 	<sc>And Yhwh</sc> encountered Bil’am<br>	and put words in his mouth;<br>	he said:<br>	Return to Balak, and thus shall you speak.17 	He came to him:<br>	here, he was standing alongside his offering-up,<br>	the nobles of Moav with him.<br>	Balak said to him:<br>	What did <sc>Yhwh</sc> speak?18 	He took up his discourse and said: <br> @ 		Arise, Balak, and hearken,<br>		turn-ear toward me, O son of Tzippor:19 		No man is God, that he should lie,<br>		or a human being, that he should retract.<br>		He, should he say and not do,<br>		speak and not fulfill?20 		Here, to bless I was taken on,<br>		when he blesses, I cannot reverse it.21 		He spies no evil in Yaakov,<br>		he sees no trouble in Israel,<br>		<sc>Yhwh</sc> their God is with them,<br>		fanfare for the king, among them!22 		The God who brought them out of Egypt<br>		like the horns of the wild-ox for him.23 		For there is no divination in Yaakov,<br>		and no augury in Israel;<br>		at once it is declared to Yaakov,<br>		to Israel, what God intends.24 		Here, a people arises like a king-of-beasts,<br>		like a lion it lifts itself up:<br>		it does not lie down till it eats [its] prey,<br>		and the blood of the slain it drinks.25 @ 	Balak said to Bil’am:<br>	If you just cannot revile, revile them,<br>	just do not bless, bless them!26 	Bil’am spoke up and said to Balak:<br>	Didn’t I speak to you [before], saying: <br>	All that God speaks—<br>	that [alone] I may do?!27 	Balak said to Bil’am:<br>	Pray go, I will take you to another place;<br>	perhaps it will be right in God’s eyes that you will revile them for me from there.28 	So Balak took Bil’am to the top of Pe’or that overlooks the face of the wasteland.29 	Bil’am said to Balak:<br>	Build me here seven altars<br>	and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.30 	So Balak did as Bil’am had said;<br>	and he offered-up a bull and a ram on [each] altar.24:1 @ 	And Bil’am saw<br>	that it was good in the eyes of <sc>Yhwh</sc> to bless Israel,<br>	and so he did not go forth as time and time [before] to encounter divination-meetings,<br>	but he set his face toward the wilderness.2 	And Bil’am lifted up his eyes<br>	and saw Israel, dwelling by their tribes,<br>	and there [came] upon him the spirit of God.3 	He took up his discourse and said:<br> @ 		Utters Bil’am the son of Be’or,<br>		utters the man of the open eye,4 		utters the hearer of Godly sayings<br>		who envisages a vision of Shaddai,<br>		fallen, but with eyes uncovered:5 		How goodly are your tents, O Yaakov,<br>		your dwellings, O Israel,6 		like groves stretched out,<br>		like gardens beside a river,<br>		like aloes planted by <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>		like cedars beside the water;7 		dripping water from their boughs,<br>		their seed in many waters!<br>		Their king will rise above Agag,<br>		their kingdom be exalted.8 		The God who brought them out of Egypt<br>		like the horns of the wild-ox for him!<br>		They will consume nations, their foes,<br>		their bones they will crush;<br>		their arrows they will smash!9 		They crouch, they lie down like a lion,<br>		like the king-of-beasts: who will [dare] rouse him?<br>		Those who bless you—-blessed,<br>		those who curse you—cursed!10 @ 	Balak’s anger flared up against Bil’am,<br>	and he smacked his hands [together].<br>	Balak said to Bil’am:<br>	To revile my enemies I had you called,<br>	and here, you have blessed, yes, blessed them,<br>	these three times!11 	So now, hasten back to your [own] place!<br>	I had said: I will honor, yes, honor you;<br>	but here, <sc>Yhwh</sc> has denied you honor!12 	Bil’am said to Balak:<br>	Didn’t I speak also to the messengers whom you sent to me, saying:13 	If Balak were to give me his house’s fill of silver and gold,<br>	I would not be able to cross the order of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	to do good or ill from my [own] heart?<br>	What <sc>Yhwh</sc> speaks,<br>	that [alone] I may speak!14 	So now,<br>	here, I am going [back] to my people;<br>	come, I will advise you<br>	as to what this people will do to your people in future days.15 	And he took up his discourse and said:<br> @ 		Utters Bil’am the son of Be’or,<br>		utters the man of open eye,16 		utters the hearer of Godly sayings,<br>		who knows the knowledge of the Most-High,<br>		envisaging a vision of Shaddai,<br>		fallen, but with eyes uncovered:17 		I see it, but not now,<br>		I behold it, but not soon:<br>		there goes forth a star from Yaakov,<br>		there arises a meteor from Israel,<br>		it smashes the pate of Moav,<br>		the crown of all the Children of Shet.18 		Edom becomes a possession,<br>		a possession becomes Se’ir of its enemies,<br>		but Israel does valiantly.19 		There rules [one] from Yaakov,<br>		he causes the remnant of Ir to perish.20 @ 	He saw Amalek,<br>	and he took up his discourse and said:<br> @ 		Premier of nations, Amalek,<br>		but its future: near to oblivion!21 @ 	He saw the Kenites,<br>	and he took up his discourse, and said:<br> @ 		Secure is your settlement,<br>		set in the clefts is your nest,22 		but ablaze will be Kayin <br>		when Ashur takes you captive.23 @ 	And he took up his discourse and said:<br> @ 		Alas, who can remain-alive whom God has condemned!24 		Ships [come] from Kittite shore,<br>		they afflict Ashur, they afflict Ever,<br>		but they too: near to oblivion!25 @ 	Then Bil’am arose and went, returning to his place;<br>	and also Balak went on his way.25:1 @ 	Israel stayed in Shittim/Acacias,<br>	and the people began to whore with the women of Moav.2 	They called the people for sacrifices to their gods;<br>	the people ate <br>	and bowed down to their gods.3 	And Israel yoked themselves to the Baal of Pe’or,<br>	so the anger of <sc>Yhwh</sc> flared up against Israel,4 	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Take all the heads of the people and impale them to <sc>Yhwh</sc>, facing the sun,<br>	so that the flaming anger of <sc>Yhwh</sc> may turn from Israel.5 	Moshe said to the officials of Israel:<br>	Let each-man kill [those of] his men who yoked themselves to the Baal of Pe’or!6 	Now here, a man of the Children of Israel had come<br>	and had brought near to his brothers a [certain] Midyanitess,<br>	before the eyes of Moshe and before the eyes of the entire community of the Children of Israel<br>	while they were weeping at the entrance to the Tent of Appointment.7 	Pin’has son of El’azar son of Aharon the priest saw [it],<br>	so he arose from the midst of the community,<br>	and took a spear in his hand;8 	he came after the man of Israel into the private-chamber,<br>	and he thrust through the two of them,<br>	the man of Israel and the woman, in her private-parts,<br>	and the plague was held back from the Children of Israel.9 	And those who died of the plague were four and twenty thousand.10 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:11 	Pin’has son of El’azar son of Aharon the priest<br>	has turned my venomous-anger from the Children of Israel<br>	in his being zealous with my zealous-rage in their midst,<br>	so that I did not destroy the Children of Israel in my zealous-rage.12 	Therefore say:<br>	Here, I give him my covenant of <i>shalom;</i>13 	it shall be for him and for his seed after him<br>	a covenant of everlasting priesthood,<br>	because that he was zealous for his God<br>	and effected-appeasement for the Children of Israel.14 	Now the name of the man of Israel, the one struck down,<br>	the one struck down with the Midyanitess [was]:<br>	Zimri son of Salu,<br>	leader of a Fathers’ House of the Shim’onites.15 	And the name of the woman who was struck down, the Midyanitess:<br>	Kozbi daughter of Tzur;<br>	tribal head of the Fathers’ House of Midyan was he.16 @ 	Now <sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:17 	Harrass the Midyanites and strike them,18 	for they were harrassing you with their craftiness, with which they were crafty with you in the matter of Pe’or,<br>	in the matter of Kozbi daughter of the leader of Midyan, their sister,<br>	the one struck-dead at the time of the plague in the matter of Pe’or.26:1 @ 	Now it was after the plague2 	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe and to El’azar son of Aharon the priest, saying:<br>	Take up the head-count of the entire community of the Children of Israel,<br>	from the age of twenty years and upward, according to their Fathers’ House,<br>	everyone going out to the armed-forces in Israel.3 	Moshe spoke, and El’azar the priest, to them in the Plains of Moav,<br>	by Jordan-Jericho, saying:4 	From the age of twenty years and upward . . . !<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> commanded Moshe and the Children of Israel,<br>	those going out of the land of Egypt:5 	Re’uven, the firstborn of Israel:<br>	the Sons of Re’uven: [of] Hanokh, the Hanokhite clan,<br>	of Pallu, the Pallite clan,6 	of Hetzron, the Hetzronite clan,<br>	of Karmi, the Karmite clan.7 	These are the Re’uvenite clans;<br>	and their count was: three and forty thousand, and seven hundred and thirty.8 	The sons of Pallu: Eliav;9 	the sons of Eliav: Nemuel, Datan and Aviram<br>	—that is the Datan and Aviram, those Called by the Community,<br>	who struggled against Moshe and against Aharon, among the community of Korah<br>	when they struggled against <sc>Yhwh</sc>,10 	and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them and Korah,<br>	at the death of the community,<br>	at the consuming by fire of the fifty and two hundred men;<br>	they became a signal-of-warning,11 	but the sons of Korah did not die.12 @ 	The Sons of Shim’on according to their clans:<br>	of Nemuel, the Nemuelite clan,<br>	of Yamin, the Yaminite clan,<br>	of Yakhin, the Yakhinite clan,13 	of Zerah, the Zarhite clan,<br>	of Sha’ul, the Sha’ulite clan.14 	These are the Shim’onite clans,<br>	two and twenty thousand and two hundred.15

you are to give-little as their inheritance,<br>	each one according to its count is to be given its inheritance.55 	However, by lot the land is to be apportioned,<br>	by the listed-names of their

of Israel,<br>	for they were not given an inheritance in the midst of the Children of Israel.63 @ 	These are those-counted by Moshe and El’azar the priest<br>	who counted the Children of Israel <br>	in the Plains of Moav, by Jordan-Jericho.64 	Among these there was not a man of those counted by Moshe and Aharon the priest<br>	when they counted the Children of Israel in the Wilderness of Sinai.65 	For <sc>Yhwh</sc> had said to them:<br>	They are to die, yes, die in the wilderness;<br>	there will not be one left of them<br>	except for Calev son of Yefunne and Yehoshua son of Nun.27:1 @ 	There came near the daughters of Tzelofhad<br>	son of Heyfer son of Gil’ad son of Makhir son of Menashe,<br>	of the clan of Menashe son of Yosef;<br>	and these are the names of his daughters:<br>	Mahla, No’a, Hogla, Milka and Tirtza.2 	They stood before Moshe and before El’azar the priest<br>	and before the leaders and the entire community,<br>	at the entrance to the Tent of Appointment, saying:3 	Our father died in the wilderness.<br>	He was not in the midst of the community that came together against <sc>Yhwh</sc>, in the community of Korah;<br>	rather, for his own sin he died,<br>	and sons he did not have.4 	Why should the name of our father be taken-away from the midst of his clan,<br>	[just] because he has no son?<br>	Give us a holding in the midst of our father’s brothers!5 	Moshe brought near their case, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.6 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe, saying:7 	Rightfully speak the daughters of Tzelofhad!<br>	You are to give, yes, give them a hereditary holding in the midst of their father’s brothers;<br>	you are to transfer the inheritance of their father to them.8 	And to the Children of Israel you are to speak, saying:<br>	Any-man, when he dies and a son he does not have,<br>	you are to transfer his inheritance to his daughter.9 	And if he has no daughter,<br>	you are to give his inheritance to his brothers.10 	And if he has no brothers,<br>	you are to give his inheritance to his father’s brothers.11 	And if no brothers has his father,<br>	you are to give his inheritance to his blood-relation that is nearest to him from his clan,<br>	and he is to take-possession of it;<br>	it shall be for the Children of Israel as a law of procedure,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> commanded Moshe.12 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Go up to these Mountains of Avarim/The-Region-Across<br>	and see the land that I am giving to the Children of Israel.13 	[When] you have seen it,<br>	you will be gathered to your kinspeople, even you,<br>	as Aharon your brother was gathered,14 	since you rebelled against my order in the Wilderness of Tzyn<br>	—when the community quarreled—<br>	to treat-me-as-holy through water before their eyes;<br>	they are the waters of Merivat Kadesh/Quarreling at Kadesh, in the Wilderness of Tzyn.15 	Then Moshe spoke to <sc>Yhwh</sc>, saying:16 	Let <sc>Yhwh</sc>, the God of the spirits of all flesh, make accountable a man over the community17 	who will go out before them, who will come back before them,<br>	who will lead them out, who will bring them back,<br>	so that the community of <sc>Yhwh</sc> will not be like a flock that has no shepherd.18 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Take yourself Yehoshua son of Nun,<br>	a man in whom the spirit is,<br>	and lean your hand upon him.19 	You are to have him stand before El’azar the priest and before the entire community,<br>	and you are to commission him before their eyes.20 	You are to put some of your majesty upon him,<br>	in order that they may hearken, the entire community of the Children of Israel.21 	Before El’azar the priest he is to stand;<br>	he will seek judgment for him of the <i>Urim,</i> before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.<br>	By his order he will go out and by his order he will come back,<br>	he and all the Children of Israel with him, and the entire community.22 	Moshe did as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded him;<br>	he took Yehoshua<br>	and had him stand before El’azar the priest, and before the entire community.23 	And he leaned his hands upon him and commisioned him,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had spoken by the hand of Moshe.28:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:2 	Command the Children of Israel and say to them:<br>	Concerning my near-offering, my food, as my fire-offerings, my soothing savor,<br>	you are to take care,<br>	bringing them near to me at their appointed-time.3 	And you are to say to them:<br>	This is the

lamb;<br>	in the Holy-Shrine you are to pour it out as a poured-offering of beer for <sc>Yhwh</sc>.8 	And the second lamb you are to make [as sacrifice] between the setting-times;<br>	like the grain-gift of daybreak and like its poured-offering you are to make it,<br>	a fire-offering of soothing savor for <sc>Yhwh</sc>.9 @ 	And on the day of the Sabbath:<br>	two lambs a year in age,

tenth, a tenth [apiece] of flour, as a grain-gift, mixed with oil, for [each] one lamb,<br>	as an offering-up, a soothing savor, fire-offering for <sc>Yhwh</sc>,14 	with their poured-offerings:<br>	half a <i>hin</i> shall be for the bull and a third of a <i>hin</i> for the ram, and a fourth of a <i>hin</i> for the lamb,<br>	of wine.<br>	That is the monthly offering-up at its New-Moon<br>	for the New-Moons of the year.15 	And one hairy goat as a <i>hattat-</i>offering for <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	as well as the regular offering-up is to be made,<br>	and its

to the heads of the tribes of the Children of Israel, saying:<br>	This is the word that <sc>Yhwh</sc> has commanded:3 	[Any] man who vows a vow to <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	or swears a sworn-oath, to bind himself by a binding-obligation:<br>	he is not to desecrate his word;<br>	exactly as what goes out of his mouth, he is to do.4 	And any woman, when she vows a vow to <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	or binds herself by a binding-obligation in her father’s house, in her youth,5 	and her father hears her vow, or her binding-obligation by which she has bound herself,<br>	and her father is silent to her:<br>	all her vows, they shall be upheld,<br>	and all her binding-obligations by which she has bound herself shall be upheld.6 	Now if her father constrains her at the time that he hears it,<br>	all her vows and her binding-obligations by which she binds herself shall not be upheld,<br>	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> will grant-her-pardon,<br>	for her father has constrained her.7 	But if she becomes married, married to a man<br>	while her vows are upon her,<br>	or the rash-statement of her lips by which she has bound herself,8 	and her husband hears,<br>	[and] at the time that he hears, he is silent to her,<br>	her vows shall be upheld;<br>	all her binding-obligations by which she has bound herself shall be upheld.9 	Now if at the time that her husband hears, he constrains her,<br>	he annulls her vow that is upon her<br>	as well as the rash-statement of her lips by which she has bound herself,<br>	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> will grant-her-pardon.10 	Now the vow of a widow or a divorcée,<br>	anything by which she has bound herself,<br>	shall be upheld regarding her.11 	If in the house of her husband she made-a-vow<br>	or bound, bound herself by a sworn-oath,12 	and her husband heard, and was silent to her,<br>	not constraining her,<br>	all her vows shall be upheld,<br>	and all the binding-obligations by which she bound herself shall be upheld.13 	But if her husband annulled, yes, annulled them at the time of his hearing it,<br>	all that went out of her lips as her vows, as her binding of herself&mdash;<br>	shall not be upheld,<br>	her husband has annulled them,<br>	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> will grant-her-pardon.14 	Every vow and every sworn binding, for afflicting her self:<br>	her husband may uphold, her husband may annul it.15 	But if her husband is silent, yes, silent to her, from [one] day to the [next] day,<br>	[then] he has upheld all her vows and all her binding-obligations that are upon her,<br>	he has upheld them, since he was silent to her at the time of his hearing it.16 	Now if he annuls, yes, annuls it after his hearing it,<br>	he is to bear her iniquity.17 @ 	These are the laws that <sc>Yhwh</sc> commanded Moshe<br>	between a man and his wife,<br>	between a father and his daughter<br>	in her youth, [in] the house of her father.31:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:2 	Seek-vengeance, the vengeance of the Children of Israel from the Midyanites;<br>	afterward you will be gathered to your kinspeople.3 	Moshe spoke to the people, saying:<br>	Draft from among you men for the attack-force,<br>	that they may be against Midyan,<br>	to exact the vengeance of <sc>Yhwh</sc> upon Midyan.4 	A thousand per tribe, a thousand per tribe for each of the tribes of Israel,<br>	you are to send out to the attack-force.5 	There were mustered, from the divisions of Israel, a thousand per tribe,<br>	twelve thousand [men] drafted for the attack-force.6 	Moshe sent them out, a thousand per tribe, to the attack-force,<br>	them and Pin’has son of El’azar, priest to the armed-forces,<br>	the holy implements and the trumpets for [sounding] trilling-blasts in his hand.7 	They arrayed-their-forces against Midyan,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe,<br>	and they killed every male,8 	and the kings of Midyan they killed, along with the [other] slain:<br>	Evi and Rekem, Tzur, Hur and Reva,<br>	the five kings of Midyan;<br>	and Bil’am son of Be’or they killed with the sword.9 	Now the Children of Israel captured the women of Midyan, and their little-ones,<br>	and all their animals and all their acquired-wealth,<br>	and all their goods they took-as-plunder.10 	And all their towns, among their settlements, and all their tent-villages, they burned with fire.11 	They took all the spoils and all those taken, among man and among beast.12 	And they brought to Moshe and to El’azar the priest, and to the community of the Children of Israel<br>	the captives and those taken and the spoils, to the camp,<br>	to the Plains of Moav, that are by Jordan-Jericho.13 	Now Moshe and El’azar the priest and all the leaders of the community, came out to meet them,<br>	outside the camp.14 	And Moshe was furious with the commanders of the military,<br>	the officers of thousands and the officers of hundreds,<br>	who had come back from the armed-force in battle;15 	Moshe said to them:<br>	You have left alive all the females!16 	Here, they were [the cause] for the Children of Israel following the word of Bil’am,<br>	of breaking-faith with <sc>Yhwh</sc>, in the matter of Pe’or,<br>	so that a plague came against the community of <sc>Yhwh</sc>!17 	So now,<br>	kill every male among the little-ones,<br>	and every woman who has known a man by lying with a male, kill [as well]!18 	But all the younger ones among the women who have not known lying with a male—<br>	you may keep them alive for yourselves.19 	As for you: pitch camp outside the camp, for seven days;<br>	everyone who killed a person or everyone who touched a corpse—<br>	decontaminate yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day,<br>	you and your captives.20 	And every garment and every vessel of animal-skin and everything made of goats’-hair and every wooden vessel,<br>	you are to decontaminate.21 	El’azar the priest said to the men of the armed-force who came back from the battle:<br>	This is the legal instruction that <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe:22 	However, gold and silver,<br>	bronze, iron, tin and lead23 	—anything that can come through fire—<br>	you are to have cross through fire, and it will be pure;<br>	however, in Waters of Undefilement it is to be decontaminated.<br>	And everything that cannot come through fire, you are to have cross through water.24 	You are to scrub your garments on the seventh day, then you will be purified;<br>	afterward you may come back into the camp.25 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe, saying:26 	Take up the head-count of those taken captive,<br>	among man and among beast,<br>	you and El’azar the priest and the heads of the fathers of the community.27 	You are to halve [equally] the taken-loot<br>	between those wielding [swords skillfully] in battle, those going-out to the armed-forces,<br>	and the entire community.28 	And you are to raise a levy for <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	from the men of battle, those going out to the armed-forces,<br>	one life out of five hundred,<br>	from humans and from cattle, from donkeys and from sheep.29 	From their half-share you are to take<br>	and give to El’azar the priest a contribution to <sc>Yhwh</sc>.30 	And from the half-share of the Children of Israel you are to take one, withheld from the fifty,<br>	from humans and from cattle, from donkeys and from sheep,<br>	from all domestic-animals,<br>	and you are to give them to the Levites,<br>	those charged with the charge of <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> Dwelling.31 	Moshe and El’azar the priest did<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe.32 	Now what was taken, over-and-above the plunder that the people from the armed-forces plundered,<br>	were sheep, six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand,33 	and cattle, two and seventy thousand,34 	and donkeys, one and sixty thousand;35 	and human persons,<br>	of women who had not known lying with a male,<br>	all the persons: two and thirty thousand.36 	And the half-share, the portion of those going-out to the armed-forces,<br>	the number of sheep: three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred.37 	And the levy for <sc>Yhwh</sc> from the sheep was<br>	six hundred and five and seventy,38 	and the cattle, six and thirty thousand,<br>	and their levy for <sc>Yhwh</sc>, two and seventy,39 	and the donkeys, thirty thousand and five hundred,<br>	and their levy for <sc>Yhwh</sc>, one and sixty;40 	and human persons, sixteen thousand,<br>	and their levy for <sc>Yhwh</sc>, two and thirty persons.41 	Moshe gave the levy of the contribution of <sc>Yhwh</sc> to El’azar the priest,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe.42 @ 	Now from the half-share of the Children of Israel<br>	that Moshe had halved, from the men who served-as-armed-forces,43 	the half-share for the community, from the sheep was:<br>	three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred;44 	and cattle, six and thirty thousand;45 	and donkeys, thirty thousand and five hundred;46 	and human persons, sixteen thousand.47 	Moshe took from the half-share of the Children of Israel, one withheld out of fifty,<br>	among man and among beast,<br>	and gave them to the Levites, those charged with the duties of the Dwelling of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe.48 @ 	Now there came near to Moshe the commanders that belonged to the divisions of the armed-forces, <br>	officers of thousands and officers of hundreds;49 	they said to Moshe:<br>	Your servants have taken up the head-count of the men of war that are under our hand:<br>	there has not gone uncounted of us a [single] man!50 	And we have brought near a near-offering for <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	[from] any man who found an article of gold, armlets or bracelets,<br>	rings, earrings, or ornaments,<br>	to effect-ransom for our lives, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.51 	So Moshe and El’azar the priest took the gold from them,<br>	all kinds of implements of [fine] workmanship.52 	Now all the gold of the contribution that they set aside for <sc>Yhwh</sc>:<br>	sixteen thousand and seven hundred and fifty <i>shekels</i>,<br>	from the officers of thousands and from the officers of hundreds.53 	The men of the armed-forces kept-as-plunder, each-man [what] was his.54 	And Moshe and El’azar the priest took the gold<br>	from the officers of thousands and the officers of hundreds,<br>	and brought it to the Tent of Appointment,<br>	as a reminder for the Children of Israel, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.32:1 @ 	Now many livestock had the Sons of Re’uven and the Sons of Gad,<br>	an exceedingly mighty [amount];<br>	and they saw the land of Ya’zer in the land of Gil’ad:<br>	here, the place was a place [fit] for livestock.2 	So the Sons of Re’uven and the Sons of Gad came<br>	and said to Moshe, to El’azar the priest and to the leaders of the community, saying:3 	Atarot and Divon, Ya’zer and Nimra,<br>	Heshbon and El’aleh,<br>	Sevam, Nevo and Be’on,4 	the land that <sc>Yhwh</sc> has struck before the community of Israel—<br>	it is a land for livestock,<br>	and your servants have livestock.5 	And they said:<br>	If we have found favor in your eyes,<br>	let this land be given to your servants as a holding;<br>	do not make us cross the Jordan!6 	Moshe said to the Sons of Gad and to the Sons of Re’uven:<br>	Should your brothers go out to battle,<br>	and you, you stay here?7 	Why would you constrain the will of the Children of Israel<br>	from crossing into the land that <sc>Yhwh</sc> has given them?8 	Thus your fathers did, when I sent them out of Kadesh Barne’a to see the land:9 	they went up as far as Wadi Eshkol and saw the land,<br>	and then they constrained the will of the Children of Israel<br>	so they did not come into the land that <sc>Yhwh</sc> had given them.10 	And the anger of <sc>Yhwh</sc> flared up on that day,<br>	and he swore, saying:11 	If they should see, the men who went up from Egypt,<br>	—from the age of twenty and upward—<br>	the ground about which I swore to Avraham, to Yitzhak and to Yaakov . . . !<br>	For they did not follow-fully after me,12 	excepting Calev son of Yefunne, the Kenizzite, and Yehoshua son of Nun,<br>	for they followed-fully after <sc>Yhwh</sc>.13 	And the anger of <sc>Yhwh</sc> flared up against Israel,<br>	and he had them wander in the wilderness, for forty years,<br>	until it came-to-an-end, that whole generation that was doing what was ill in the eyes of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.14 	Now here, you have arisen in place of your fathers,<br>	a brood of sinning men,<br>	to add further to the flaming anger of <sc>Yhwh</sc> against Israel.15 	If you turn away from him,<br>	he will add further to leave them in the wilderness,<br>	and you will bring-ruin-on this entire people!16 	They came close to him and said:<br>	Sheep fences we will build, for our livestock here,<br>	and towns for our little-ones;17 	while as for us, we shall be drafted hastily before the Children of Israel,<br>	until we have brought them to their place.<br>	But our little-ones will stay in towns fortified against the inhabitants of the land.18 	We will not return to our houses<br>	until the Children of Israel have inherited each one his inheritance.19 	For we will not take-inheritance with them across the Jordan and further [on],<br>	for our inheritance has come to us<br>	across the Jordan, toward sunrise.20 	Moshe said to them:<br>	If you do this thing,<br>	if you are drafted before <sc>Yhwh</sc> for battle,21 	and you cross the Jordan, every hand-picked man, before <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	until he has dispossessed his enemies from before him,22 	and the land is subdued before <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	afterward you may return,<br>	and [then] you will be clear [of obligation] before <sc>Yhwh</sc> and before Israel;<br>	this land will be for you as a holding before <sc>Yhwh</sc>.23 	But if you do not do thus,<br>	here, you will have sinned against <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	and know your sin—that [it] will overtake you!24 	Build yourselves towns for your little-ones and fences for your flocks,<br>	and what has gone out of your mouths, do!25 	Then said the Sons of Gad and the Sons of Re’uven to Moshe, saying:<br>	Your servants will do as my lord commands:26 	our little-ones, our wives, our livestock and all our animals<br>	will stay there in the towns of Gil’ad;27 	your servants will cross over, every drafted [member] of the armed-forces, before <sc>Yhwh</sc>, in battle,<br>	as my lord has spoken.28 	So Moshe commanded El’azar the priest concerning them<br>	and Yehoshua son of Nun<br>	and the heads of the Fathers of the tribes of the Children of Israel,29 	and Moshe said to them:<br>	If the Sons of Gad and the Sons of Re’uven cross over the Jordan with you,<br>	everyone drafted for battle, before <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	and the land is conquered before you,<br>	you may give them the land of Gil’ad as an inheritance.30 	But if the drafted [warriors] do not cross over with you,<br>	they will receive-holdings with you in the land of Canaan.31 	The Sons of Gad and the Sons of Re’uven answered, saying:<br>	What <sc>Yhwh</sc> has spoken to your servants, thus will we do:32 	we ourselves will cross over, as drafted men, before <sc>Yhwh</sc>, into the land of Canaan;<br>	[remaining] with us [will be] our inherited holding, across the Jordan.33 	So Moshe gave to them, to the Sons of Gad, the Sons of Re’uven, and half the tribe of Menashe son of Yosef,<br>	the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites,<br>	and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan,<br>	the land as regards its towns in the territories, the towns of the land all around.34 	And the Sons of Gad rebuilt Divon, Atarot, and Aro’er,35 	Aterot Shofan, and Ya’zer and Yogbeha,36 	and Bet Nimra and Bet Haran,<br>	as fortified cities and as fences for flocks.37 	And the Sons of Re’uven rebuilt Heshbon and El’alei<br>	and Kiryatayim,38 	and Nevo and Baal Me’on—of changed name—<br>	and Sivma;<br>	and they called them by [other] names,<br>	the names of the towns that they built.39 	Then went out the Sons of Makhir son of Menashe, to Gil’ad,<br>	they captured it <br>	and dispossessed the Amorites that were in it.40 	And Moshe gave Gil’ad to Makhir son of Menashe,<br>	and he settled there.41 	And Ya’ir son of Menashe marched out<br>	and captured their villages,<br>	he called them Havvot-Ya’ir/Fortified-Villages of Ya’ir.42 	And Novah went out<br>	and captured Kenat and its daughter-towns,<br>	and he called it Novah, after his [own] name.33:1 @ 	These are the marching-stages of the Children of Israel that they went on<br>	from the land of Egypt, by their forces,<br>	through the hand of Moshe and Aharon.2 	Moshe wrote down their departures, by their marching-stages, by order of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.<br>	Now these are their marching-stages, by their departures:3 	they marched from Ra’mses, in the first month,<br>	on the fifteenth day of the first month;<br>	on the morrow of the Passover-meal<br>	the Children of Israel departed with a high hand, before the eyes of all Egypt,4 	while Egypt was burying those whom <sc>Yhwh</sc> had struck down among them, all the firstborn,<br>	and on their gods, <sc>Yhwh</sc> had rendered judgment.5 	And the Children of Israel marched on from Ra’mses, and encamped at Sukkot;6 	they marched on from Sukkot, and encamped at Eitam, which is at the edge of the wilderness.7 	And they marched on from Eitam and turned toward Pi-Ha-Hirot, that [runs] along the face of Baal Tzefon,<br>	and encamped before Migdol.8 	They marched on from Penei Ha-Hirot and crossed in the midst of the Sea into the wilderness;<br>	then they marched a journey of three days into the Wilderness of Eitam,<br>	and encamped at Mara.9 	They marched on from Mara and came to Eilim;<br>	now in Eilim [were] twelve springs of water and seventy palms,<br>	and they encamped there.10 	They marched on from Eilim, and encamped by the Sea of Reeds.11 	They marched on from the Sea of Reeds, and encamped in the Wilderness of Syn.12 	They marched on from the Wilderness of Syn, and encamped at Dofka.13 	They marched on from Dofka, and encamped at Alush.14 	They marched on from Alush, and encamped at Refidim,<br>	but there was no water there for the people to drink.15 	They marched on from Refidim, and encamped in the Wilderness of Sinai.16 	They marched on from the Wilderness of Sinai and encamped at Kivrot Ha-Taava.17 	They marched on from Kivrot Ha-Taava, and encamped at Hatzerot.18 	They marched on from Hatzerot, and encamped at Ritma.19 	They marched on from Ritma, and encamped at Rimmon

the priest went up on Hill’s Hill, by order of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	and died there,<br>	in the fortieth year after the going out of the Children of Israel from the land of Egypt,<br>	in the fifth month, on the first of the month.39 	Aharon was three and twenty and a hundred years old<br>	when he died at Hill’s Hill.40 @ 	Now the Canaanite, the king of Arad <br>	—he sat [as ruler] in the Negev, in the land of Canaan—heard of the coming of the Children of Israel.41 	They marched on from Hill’s Hill, and encamped at Tzalmona.42 	They marched on from Tzalmona, and encamped at Punon.43 	They

Meadow,<br>	in the Plains of Moav.50 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe in the Plains of Moav,<br>	by Jordan-Jericho, saying:51 	Speak to the Children of Israel, and say to them:<br>	When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,52 	you are to dispossess all the settled-folk of the land from before you.<br>	You are to destroy all their figured-objects,<br>	all their molten images you are to destroy,<br>	all their sanctuaries you are to wipe out,53 	that you may take possession of the land and settle in it,<br>	for to you I have given the land, to possess it.54 	You shall arrange-inheritance of the land by lots, according to your clans: <br>	for the many, you are to make-much their inheritance,<br>	for the few, you are to make-little their inheritance&mdash;<br>	wherever the lot comes out for them there, [so] shall theirs be;<br>	by the tribes of your fathers you are to receive-inheritance.55 	But if you do not dispossess the settled-folk of the land from before you,<br>	those who are left of them shall be<br>	as barbs in your eyes, and as spines in your sides;<br>	they will harrass you on the land that you are settling in,56 	and it shall be:<br>	as I intended to do to them, so I will do to you!34:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:2 	Command the Children of Israel and say to them:<br>	When you enter the land, Canaan,<br>	this is the land that will fall to you as an inheritance,<br>	the land of Canaan by its borders:3 	the Negev limit will be for you from the Wilderness of Tzyn alongside Edom;<br>	the Negev border will be for you from the edge of the Sea of Salt, on the east;4 	the border will then turn for you from the Negev-side of Scorpions’ Pass, crossing on to Tzyn;<br>	its outer-reaches will be from the Negev-side of Kadesh Barne’a,<br>	[then] going out to Hatzar Addar and crossing on to Atzmon.5 	The border will then turn from Atzmon toward the Wadi of Egypt,<br>	its outer-reaches will be at the Sea.6 	As the seaward border will be for you the Great Sea and [its own] border;<br>	this will be for you the seaward border.7 	And this will be for you the northern border:<br>	from the Great Sea you are to mark yourselves [a line] to Hill’s Hill.8 	From Hill’s Hill you are to mark going to Hamat,<br>	and the outer-reaches of the border shall be at Tzedad.9 	Then the border will go out to Zifron,<br>	and its outer-reaches will be Hatzar Einan;<br>	this will be for you the northern border.10 	And you are to mark for yourselves, for the border eastward:<br>	from Hatzar Einan to Shefam.11 	And the border will go down from Shefam to Rivla, on the east of Ayin/The Spring,<br>	then the border will go down and brush the shoulder of the Sea of Kinneret, eastward,12 	then the border will go down along the Jordan,<br>	and its outer-reaches will be the Sea of Salt.<br>	This will be the land for you, in its borders all around!13 	So Moshe commanded the Children of Israel, saying:<br>	This is the land for which you are to arrange-inheritance by lot,<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> commanded to be given to the nine tribes and the half tribe.14 	For the tribe of the Sons of the Re’uvenites, according to their Fathers’ House,<br>	and the tribe of the Sons of the Gadites, according to their Fathers’ House,<br>	and half of the tribe of Menashe<br>	have [already] taken their inheritance;15 	two tribes and the half tribe<br>	have taken their inheritance across from Jordan-Jericho,<br>	eastward, toward sunrise.16 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:17 	These are the names of the men that will arrange-for-your-inheritance of the land:<br>	El’azar the priest and Yehoshua son of Nun,18 	and one leader, one leader per tribe you are to take for arranging-inheritance of the land.19 	And these are the names of the men:<br>	of the tribe of Yehuda: Calev son of Yefunne20 	Of the tribe of the Sons of Shim’on: Shemuel son of Ammihud.21 	Of the tribe of Binyamin: Elidad son of Kislon.22 	Of the tribe of the Sons of Dan, leader: Bukki son of Yogli.23 	Of the Sons of Yosef:<br>	of the tribe of the Sons of Menashe, leader: Hanniel son of Efod,24 	of the tribe of the Sons of Efrayim, leader: Kemiel son of Shiftan.25 	Of the tribe of the Sons of Zevulun, leader: Elitzafan son of Parnakh.26 	Of the tribe of the Sons of Yissakhar, leader: Paltiel son of Azzan.27 	Of the tribe of the Sons of Asher, leader: Ahihud son of Shelomi.28 	Of the tribe of the Sons of Naftali, leader: Pedah’el son of Ammihud.29 	These [are they] whom <sc>Yhwh</sc> commanded to parcel-out-inheritance for the Children of Israel, in the land of Canaan.35:1 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, in the Plains of Moav,<br>	by Jordan-Jericho, saying:2 	Command the Children of Israel,<br>	that they may give over to the Levites, from their inherited holdings, towns to settle in,<br>	and pasture-land for the towns around them, give to the Levites.3 	The towns shall be for them to settle in,<br>	and their pasture-lands shall be for their cattle, their property and for all their animals.4 	And the pasture-lands of the towns that you give to the Levites [shall be]<br>	from the wall of the town and outward, a thousand cubits all around;5 	you are to measure outside the city, the eastern limit: two thousand by the cubit,<br>	and the Negev limit, two thousand by the cubit,<br>	and the seaward limit, two thousand by the cubit,<br>	and the northern limit, two thousand by the cubit,<br>	with the town in the middle.<br>	This shall be for them the pasture-lands of the towns.  	And with the towns that you give to the Levites,<br>	with the six towns of asylum that you give for fleeing-to for the [accidental] murderer—<br>	along with them you are to give forty-two towns.7 	All the towns that you are to give the Levites:<br>	forty-eight towns,<br>	them and their pasture-lands.8 	And the towns that you give [them] from the holdings of the Children of Israel—<br>	from those that have-many you are to take-many, from those that have-few you are to take-few;<br>	each one according to his inheritance that they receive-as-inheritance<br>	is to give of its towns for the Levites.9 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe, saying:10 	Speak to the Children of Israel and say to them:<br>	When you cross over the Jordan, into the land of Canaan:11 	You are to select for yourselves [certain] towns&mdash;<br>	towns of asylum shall they be for you,<br>	for fleeing-to for the [accidental] murderer, one who strikes down a life in error.12 	The towns shall be for you for asylum from the [blood] redeemer,<br>	that the murderer not die<br>	until he can come before the community for judgment.13 	And the towns that you provide—<br>	six towns of asylum shall there be for you.14 	Three of the towns you are to provide across the Jordan,<br>	and three of the towns you are to provide in the land of Canaan<br>	&mdash;towns of asylum they are to be&mdash;15 	for the Children of Israel, for the sojourner and for the temporary-settler among them,<br>	these six towns are to be for asylum,<br>	for fleeing to for anyone who strikes down a person in error.16 	But if with an iron instrument he struck him down, so that he died,<br>	he is a murderer:<br>	put to death, put to death must the murderer be!17 	And if with a stone in hand through which one can die he struck him down, so that he died,<br>	he is a murderer: <br>	put to death, put to death must the murderer be!18 	Or with a wooden tool in hand through which one can die he struck him down, <br>	so that he died,<br>	he is a murderer:<br>	put to death, put to death must the murderer be!19 	As for the blood redeemer—<br>	he may put to death the murderer,<br>	upon meeting him, he may put him to death.20 	Now if in hatred he pushed him,<br>	or threw [something] at him lying-in-wait, so that he died,21 	or in enmity struck him with his hand, so that he died,<br>	put to death, put to death must the striker be&mdash;<br>	he is a murderer:<br>	the blood redeemer may put the murderer to death, upon meeting him.22 	But if with suddenness, with no [previous] enmity, he pushed him,<br>	or threw at him any tool, without lying-in-wait,23 	or with any stone tool through which one can die, without seeing [him],<br>	he dropped it on him, so that he died<br>	—now he was not his enemy, not one seeking his ill—24 	the community is to judge between the striker and the blood redeemer,<br>	according to these regulations;25 	the community is to rescue the murderer from the hand of the blood redeemer,<br>	and the community is to return him to his town of asylum, to which he fled;<br>	he is to stay in it until the death of the Great Priest<br>	who was anointed with the oil of holiness.26 	But if the murderer goes out, yes, goes out<br>	from the border of his town of asylum, whence he fled,27 	and the blood redeemer finds him, outside the border of his town of asylum,<br>	the blood redeemer may murder the murderer;<br>	he has no bloodguilt.28 	For in his town of asylum he must stay, until the death of the Great Priest;<br>	after the death of the Great Priest<br>	the murderer may return to the land of his holding.29 	These shall be for you<br>	as a law of procedure into your generations, throughout all your settlements:30 	whoever strikes down a life,<br>	at the mouth of witnesses [only] may a murderer be murdered;<br>	one witness [alone] may not testify against the person, to have-him-put-to-death.31 	You are not to accept a ransom for the life of a murderer,<br>	since he is culpable, [deserving] the death-penalty;<br>	indeed, he is to be put to death, put to death!32 	And you are not to accept a ransom<br>	for fleeing to his town of asylum,<br>	for returning to settle in the land,<br>	until the death of the Great Priest.33 	You are not to corrupt the land that you are in,<br>	for the blood—it will corrupt the land,<br>	and the land will not be purged of the blood that has been shed upon it<br>	except through the blood of him who shed it.34 	You are not to make-<i>tamei</i> the land in which you are settling,<br>	in whose midst I dwell,<br>	for I am <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	Dweller in the midst of Israel!36:1 @ 	There came near the heads of the Fathers’ [Houses] of a clan of the Sons of Gil’ad son of Makhir son of Menashe, of the clans of the Sons of Yosef;<br>	they spoke before Moshe and before the leaders,<br>	the heads of the Father[s’ Houses] of the Children of Israel,2 	they said:<br>	It is my lord that <sc>Yhwh</sc> has commanded to give out the land as inheritance, by lot, to the Children of Israel,<br>	and my lord was commanded by <sc>Yhwh</sc> to give out the inheritance of Tzelofhad our brother, to his daughters.3 	Now should they be for one of the members of [another] tribe of the Children of Israel as wives,<br>	their inheritance will be diminished from the inheritance of their fathers<br>	and be added to the inheritance of the tribe for whom they become [wives];<br>	from our allotted inheritance it will be diminished!4 	And when there is a Homebringing for the Children of Israel<br>	and their inheritance is added to the inheritance of the tribe for which they are [wives]<br>	from the inheritance of our fathers’ tribe,<br>	their inheritance will be diminished!5 	So Moshe commanded the Children of Israel by order of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, saying:<br>	Rightfully has the tribe of the Sons of Yosef spoken!6 	This is the word that <sc>Yhwh</sc> commands concerning the daughters of Tzelofhad, saying:<br>	For those good in their eyes, they may become wives;<br>	however, [only] for a clan from the tribe of their father, may they become wives.7 	The inheritance of the Children of Israel is not to go round from tribe to tribe;<br>	indeed, each one to the inheritance of his father’s tribe is to cleave, [among] the Children of Israel.8 	And every daughter who comes-into-possession of inheritance from the tribes of the Children of Israel—<br>	for someone from the clan of her father’s tribe she must become a wife,<br>	in order that the Children of Israel may remain-in-possession, each one, of the inheritance of his fathers.9 	There shall not go round the inheritance of a tribe to another tribe;<br>	indeed, each to his inheritance is to cleave, [among] the tribes of the Children of Israel.10 	As <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe,<br>	thus the daughters of Tzelofhad did.11 	They became&mdash; Mahla, Tirtza, Hogla, Milka and No’a, the daughters of Tzelofhad&mdash;wives for the sons of their uncles,12 	in the clans of the Sons of Menashe son of Yosef they became wives,<br>	so that their inheritance went along with the tribe of the clan of their father.13 @ 	These are the commandments and the regulations <br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> commanded by the hand of Moshe to the Children of Israel, <br>	in the Plains of Moav, by Jordan-Jericho.DEUTERONOMY 1:1 @ 	These are the words that Moshe spoke to all Israel<br>	in [the country] across the Jordan<br>	in the wilderness, in the plains near Suf,<br>	between Paran and Tofel, Lavan, Hatzerot, and Di-Zahav—2 	eleven days [it is] from Horev, by the route of Mount Se’ir, [going] by Kadesh-Barne’a.3 	And it was in the fortieth year,<br>	in the eleventh month, on [day] one of the month:<br>	Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel<br>	exactly as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded him concerning them,4 	after he had struck<br>	Sihon king of the Amorite, who sat [as ruler] in Heshbon,<br>	and Og king of Bashan, who sat [as ruler] in Ashtarot, in Edre’i.5 	In [the country] across the Jordan, in the land of Moav,<br>	Moshe set about to explain this Instruction, saying:6 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> our God spoke to us at Horev, saying:<br>	Enough for you, staying at this mountain!7 	Face about, march on<br>	and come to the Amorite highlands and to all its dwellers<br>	in the Plains, the Highlands and the Lowlands, the Negev/Parched-Land and the shore of the Sea,<br>	the land of the Canaanite and the Lebanon,<br>	as far as the Great River, the river Euphrates.8 	See,<br>	I give the land before you;<br>	enter, take possession of the land<br>	about which <sc>Yhwh</sc> swore to your fathers, to Avraham, to Yitzhak, and to Yaakov,<br>	to give to them and to their seed after them.9 	And I said to you at that time, saying:<br>	I am not able, I alone, to carry you;10 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> your God has made-you-many—<br>	and here you are today, like the stars in the heavens in abundance!11 	<sc>Yhwh</sc>, the God of your fathers, may he add to you as you are a thousand times,<br>	and bless you, as he promised to you!12 	How can I carry, I alone, your load, your burden, your quarreling?13 	Provide yourselves men, wise, understanding and knowledgeable, for your tribes,<br>	and I will set them as heads-over-you.14 	And you answered me, you said:<br>	Good is the word that you have proposed to do!15 	So I took heads of your tribes, men wise and knowledgeable,<br>	and I placed them as heads over you,<br>	as rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens, and as officials for your tribes.16 	And I commanded your judges at that time, saying:<br>	hear-out [what is] between your brothers;<br>	judge with equity between each-man and his brother or a sojourner.17 	You are not to [specially-]recognize a face in judgment,<br>	as the small, so the great, you are to hear-them-out;<br>	you are not to be in fear of any-man,<br>	for judgment—it is God’s!<br>	And [any] legal-matter too hard for you, bring near to me,<br>	and I will hear-it-out.18 	So I commanded you at that time concerning all the matters that you should do.19 @ 	We marched on from Horev<br>	and traveled through the whole wilderness, that great and awe-inspiring one that you saw,<br>	by the Amorite highland route,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> our God commanded us,<br>	and we came as far as Kadesh-Barne’a.20 	And I said to you:<br>	You have come to the Amorite highlands that <sc>Yhwh</sc> our God is giving us.21 	See,<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> your God has given this land before you;<br>	go up, take possession [of it],<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> the God of your fathers promised you.<br>	Do not be afraid, do not be dismayed!22 	Then you came near to me, all of you, and said:<br>	Let us send men before us<br>	that they may explore the land for us<br>	and return us word<br>	about the route that we should [use to] go up against it<br>	and about the towns that we will come to.23 	The matter was good in my eyes,<br>	and so I took from among you twelve men, one man per tribe.24 	They faced about and went up into the hills, and came as far as the Wadi of Clusters<br>	and spied it out.25 	They took in their hand some of the fruit of the land and brought [it] down to us<br>	and returned us word; they said:<br>	Good is the land that <sc>Yhwh</sc> our God is giving us!26 	Yet you were not willing to go up;<br>	you rebelled against the order of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God.27 	You muttered in your tents; you said:<br>	Because of <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> hatred for us he took us out of the land of Egypt,<br>	to give us into the hand of the Amorites, to wipe us out!28 	To where are we going up?<br>	Our brothers have made our hearts melt, saying:<br>	A people greater and taller than we,<br>	towns great and fortified to heaven,<br>	and even Children of the Anakites we saw there!29 	But I said to you:<br>	Do not shake-in-fear, do not be afraid of them!30 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> your God, who goes before you,<br>	he will do battle for you,<br>	exactly as he did with you in Egypt, before your eyes,31 	and in the wilderness, where you saw<br>	how <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God carried you<br>	as a man carries his child,<br>	on all the way that you went upon,<br>	until your coming to this place.32 	Yet in this matter<br>	you have not been evincing trust in <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,33 	who goes before you on the way<br>	to scout out for you a place to pitch-your-camp,<br>	in fire by night, to show you the way on which you should go,<br>	and in a cloud by day!34 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> heard the voice of your words,<br>	and he became furious and swore [an oath], saying:35 	If they should get-to-see—a [single] man of all of these men, of this evil generation—<br>	the good land that I swore to give to their fathers . . . !36 	Only Calev son of Yefunne, <i>he</i> will get-to-see it,<br>	to him I will give the land that he has tread upon, and to his children,<br>	in consequence that he fully-followed after <sc>Yhwh</sc>.37 	At me also <sc>Yhwh</sc> was incensed for your sakes, saying:<br>	You also will not enter there!38 	Yehoshua son of Nun, who stands before you, <i>he</i> will enter there;<br>	him [you are to] strengthen,<br>	for he will allot-it-as inheritance to Israel.39 	Now your little-ones, of whom you said: For plunder will they be,<br>	and your children who as of today do not [yet] know good or ill,<br>	<i>they</i> shall enter there,<br>	to them I will give it, and they will take possession of it!40 	As for you, face about, march into the wilderness, by the Reed Sea route.41 	But you spoke up; you said to me:<br>	We have sinned against <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	we will go up and do battle,<br>	exactly as <sc>Yhwh</sc> our God commanded us!<br>	So each-man girded on his implements of battle<br>	and you made bold to go up to the highlands.42 	But <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to me:<br>	Say to them:<br>	You are not to go up, you are not to do battle,<br>	for I am not in your midst—<br>	so that you not be defeated before your enemies!43 	So I spoke to you,<br>	but you did not hearken;<br>	you rebelled against the order of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	you brazenly went up to the highlands.44 	And the Amorites came out, those who were settled in those highlands, to meet you,<br>	they pursued you—as bees do!—<br>	and they crushed you at Se’ir, as far as Horma.45 	You returned, and you wept before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	but <sc>Yhwh</sc> did not hearken to your voice,<br>	he did not give-ear to you.46 	So you stayed in Kadesh for many days, like the days you had stayed [there before],2:1 @ 	and we faced about and marched into the wilderness, by the Reed Sea route,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had spoken to me;<br>	we circled around the highlands of Se’ir for many days-and-years.2 @ 	Then <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to me, saying:3 	Enough for you, circling around these highlands!<br>	Face about, northward!4 	And as for the people, command [them], saying:<br>	You are about to cross the territory of your brothers, the Children of Esav, who are settled in Se’ir.<br>	Though they are afraid of you,<br>	take exceeding care!5 	Do not stir yourselves up against them,<br>	for I will not give you of their land so much as the sole of a foot can tread on,<br>	for as a possession to Esav I gave the highlands of Se’ir.6 	Food you may market from them for silver, that you may eat;<br>	and also water you may purchase from them for silver, that you may drink.7 	For <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God has blessed you in all the works of your hands—<br>	he has known your travels in this great wilderness!<br>	These forty years <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God is with you;<br>	you have not lacked a thing!8 	So we crossed on by, away from our brothers, the Children of Esav, who are settled in Se’ir,<br>	[away] from the route of the Plain, from Eilat and from Etzion Gever,<br>	and we faced about and crossed the route of the Wilderness of Moav.9 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to me:<br>	Do not harass Moav,<br>	do not stir yourself up against them in battle,<br>	for I will not give you [any] of their land as a possession,<br>	for to the Children of Lot I have given Ar as a possession.10 	—The Emites/Frightful-Ones were formerly settled there,<br>	a people great and many, and tall like the Anakites.11 	[As] Refa’ites/Shades are they considered, like the Anakites [are],<br>	but the Moavites call them Emites.12 	Now in Se’ir the Horites were formerly settled;<br>	but the Children of Esav dispossessed them and wiped them out from before them and settled in their place,<br>	[just] as Israel did to the land of their possession,<br>	which <sc>Yhwh</sc> gave to them.—13 	Now, arise, cross you the Wadi Zered!<br>	So we crossed the Wadi Zered.14 	And the days that we traveled from Kadesh Barne’a until we crossed the Wadi Zered [were]:<br>	thirty-eight years,<br>	until all that generation came to an end, the men of battle, from amid the camp,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had sworn to them.15 	Yes, the hand of <sc>Yhwh</sc> was against them, to panic them from amid the camp,<br>	until they met their end.16 	Now it was, when all the men of battle had ended [their] dying from amid the people,17 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to me, saying:18 	You are crossing today the territory of Moav, Ar.19 	[When] you come near, opposite the Children of Ammon,<br>	do not harass them, do not stir yourself up against them,<br>	for I will not give any of the land of the Children of Ammon to you as a possession,<br>	for to the Children of Lot I have given it as a possession.20 	It, too, is considered the land of the Refa’ites&mdash;<br>	Refa’ites were settled in it in former-times,<br>	but the Ammonites call them Zamzummites/Barbarians,21 	a people great and many, tall like the Anakites,<br>	and yet <sc>Yhwh</sc> wiped them out from before them, and they dispossessed them,<br>	and settled in their place,22 	as he did to the Children of Esav who are settled in Se’ir,<br>	that he wiped out the Horites from before them, and they dispossessed them<br>	and settled in their place,<br>	until this day.23 	As for the Avvites who were settled in villages as far as Gaza,<br>	Kaftorites who came from Kaftor wiped them out and settled in their place.24 @ 	Arise, march on and cross the Wadi Arnon!<br>	See, I have given into your hand Sihon king of Heshbon, the Amorite, and his land;<br>	Start! Take-possession!<br>	And stir yourself up against him in battle!25 	This day<br>	I will start to put the terror of you and the awe of you<br>	upon the peoples [that are] under all the heavens,<br>	so that when they hear heard-rumors of you,<br>	they will shudder and writhe before you.26 	Now I sent messengers from the Wilderness of Kedemot to Sihon, king of Heshbon,<br>	words of peace, saying:27 	Let me cross through your land;<br>	on the main-route, on the main-route I will go&mdash;<br>	I will not turn aside right or left.28 	As for food, for silver you may market [it] to me, that I may eat,<br>	as for water, for silver you may give [it] to me, that I may drink;<br>	only: let me cross on foot—29 	as the Children of Esav, who are settled in Se’ir, did for me,<br>	and the Moavites, who are settled in Ar,<br>	until I have crossed the Jordan<br>	into the land that <sc>Yhwh</sc> our God is giving us.30 	But Sihon king of Heshbon was not willing to let us cross through him,<br>	for <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God hardened his spirit and stiffened his heart,<br>	in order to give him into your hand, as [is] this day.31 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to me:<br>	See, I have started to give before you Sihon and his land;<br>	start, take possession, to possess his land!32 	And Sihon went out to meet us, he and all his people in battle, at Yahatz,33 	but <sc>Yhwh</sc> our God gave him before us,<br>	and we struck him and his sons and all his people.34 	We captured all his towns at that time,<br>	and devoted-to-destruction every town: menfolk, women, and little-ones;<br>	we left no remnant.35 	Only the animals did we plunder for ourselves,<br>	and the spoils of the towns that we captured.36 	From Aro’er, that is on the bank of the Wadi Arnon,<br>	and the town that is in the Wadi, as far as Gil’ad,<br>	there was not a city that was too lofty for us&mdash;<br>	all [of them] <sc>Yhwh</sc> our God gave before us.37 	Only the land of the Children of Ammon you did not come near,<br>	all the environs of the Wadi Yabbok, and the towns in the highlands,<br>	and all about which <sc>Yhwh</sc> our God commanded us.3:1 @ 	We faced about and went up the route to Bashan,<br>	and Og king of Bashan came out to meet us,<br>	he and all his fighting-people in battle, at Edre’i.2 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to me:<br>	Do not be afraid of him,<br>	for into your hand I give him and all his fighting-people, and his land,<br>	you will do to him<br>	as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who sat [as ruler] in Heshbon.3 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> our God gave into our hand<br>	Og king of Bashan as well, and all his fighting-people;<br>	we struck him until there was not left him a survivor.4 	We conquered all his towns at that time,<br>	there was no city that we did not take from them,<br>	sixty towns, all the region of Argov,<br>	the kingdom of Og at Bashan.5 	All these were fortified towns [with] a high wall, double-doored with a bar,<br>	aside from the towns of the open-country-dwellers, exceedingly many.6 	We devoted them to destruction,<br>	as we had done to Sihon king of Heshbon,<br>	devoting-to-destruction every town:<br>	menfolk, women and little-ones,7 	while every [head of] cattle, and the spoils of the towns, we took-as-plunder for ourselves.8 	And we took at that time the land<br>	from the hand of the two kings of the Amorites that were in [the country] across the Jordan,<br>	from Wadi Arnon to Mount Hermon;9 	—Sidonians call Hermon Siryon,<br>	but the Amorites call it Senir—10 	all the towns of the plateau and all of Gil’ad, and all of Bashan,<br>	as far as Salkha and Edre’i,<br>	towns of the kingdom of Og at Bashan.11 	For only Og king of Bashan was left of the rest of the Refa’ites<br>	—here, his couch was a couch of iron;<br>	is it not in Rabba of the Children of Ammon,<br>	nine cubits its length, four cubits its width, by the cubit of a man?—12 	Now this land we possessed at that time,<br>	from Aro’er which is by the Wadi Arnon;<br>	half of the highlands of Gil’ad and its towns I gave to the Re’uvenites and to the Gadites.13 	And the rest of Gil’ad and all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og,<br>	I gave to half of the tribe of Menashe, all the region of Argov, including all of Bashan<br>	—it is called the Land of the Refa’ites.14 	Ya’ir son of Menashe took all of the region of Argov<br>	as far as the territory of the Geshurites and the Maakathites,<br>	and called them by his name, [the] Bashan [towns]:<br>	Havvot Ya’ir/Tent-Villages of Ya’ir,<br>	until this day.15 	Now to Makhir I gave Gil’ad,16 	and to the Re’uvenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gil’ad, as far as Wadi Arnon, the middle of the Wadi as the boundary,<br>	as far as Yabbok the Wadi,<br>	the boundary of the Children of Ammon;17 	and the Plain and Jordan as [its] boundary<br>	from the Kinneret as far as the Sea of the Plain, the Sea of Salt,<br>	beneath the slopes of the Pisga [Range], toward sunrise.18 	And I commanded you at that time, saying:<br>		<sc>Yhwh</sc> your God has given you this land to possess;<br>	[you] specially-drafted [men] are to cross over before their brothers, the Children of Israel, all valiant ones.19 	Only your wives, your little-ones, and your livestock<br>	—I know that you have many [head of] livestock—<br>	are to settle in your towns that I am giving you,20 	until <sc>Yhwh</sc> gives-rest to your brothers as yourselves,<br>	and they take possession, they as well, of the land that <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God is giving you, in [the country] across the Jordan.<br>	Then shall each-man return to his possession that I give you.21 	Now Yehoshua I commanded at that time, saying:<br>	Your eyes [it was] that have seen all that <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God did to these two kings;<br>	thus will <sc>Yhwh</sc> do to all the kingdoms into which you are crossing!22 	You are not to be afraid of them,<br>	for <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	he is the one who does battle for you!23 	And I pleaded with <sc>Yhwh</sc> at that time, saying:24 	My Lord <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	you yourself have started to let your servant see<br>	your greatness and your strong hand,<br>	that who is a god in heaven and on earth<br>	that can do according to your deeds and according to your power!25 	Pray let me cross over<br>	that I may see the good land<br>	that is in [the country] across the Jordan,<br>	these good highlands, and the Lebanon!26 	But <sc>Yhwh</sc> was cross with me on your account,<br>	and he would not hearken to me;<br>		<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to me:<br>	Enough for you!<br>	Do not speak to me any more again about this matter!27 	Go up to the top of the Pisga [Range]<br>	and lift up your eyes—toward the sea, toward the north, toward the south, and toward sunrise;<br>	see [it] with your eyes,<br>	for you will not cross this Jordan!28 	But command Yehoshua;<br>	make-him-strong, make-him-courageous,<br>	for he will cross over before this people<br>	and he will cause them to inherit the land that you see.29 	And we stayed in the valley,<br>	opposite Bet Pe’or.4:1 @ 	And now, O Israel, hearken to the laws and to the regulations<br>	that I am teaching you to observe,<br>	in order that you may live<br>	and enter and take possession of the land that <sc>Yhwh</sc>, the God of your fathers, is giving to you.2 	You are not to add to the word that I am commanding you,<br>	and you are not to subtract from it,<br>	in keeping the commandments of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God that I am commanding you.3 	Your eyes [it is] that have seen what <sc>Yhwh</sc> did at Baal Pe’or:<br>	indeed, every man that walked after Baal Pe’or—<br>		<sc>Yhwh</sc> your God wiped him out from among you!4 	But you, the ones clinging to <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	are alive, all of you, today!5 	See,<br>	I am teaching you laws and regulations<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> my God has commanded me, to do thus,<br>	amid the land that you are entering to possess.6 	You are to keep [them], you are to observe [them],<br>	for that [will be] wisdom-for-you and understanding-for-you in the eyes of the peoples<br>	who, when they hear all these laws, will say:<br>	Only a wise and understanding people is this great nation!7 	For who [else] is [such] a great nation<br>	that has gods so near to it<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> our God<br>	in all our calling on him?8 	And who [else] is [such] a great nation<br>	that has laws and regulations so equitable<br>	as all this Instruction<br>	that I put before you today?9 	Only: take you care, take exceeding care for your self,<br>	lest you forget the things that your eyes saw,<br>	lest you turn aside in your heart<br>	all the days of your life;<br>	make them known to your children, and to your children’s children:10 	the day that you stood before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God at Horev,<br>	when <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to me:<br>	Assemble the people to me,<br>	that I may have them hear my words,<br>	that they may learn to hold me in awe<br>	all the days that they are alive on the land,<br>	—and their children, they are to teach!—11 	you came near and you stood beneath the mountain:<br>	now the mountain was burning with fire,<br>	up to the [very] heart of the heavens,<br>	[in] darkness, cloud and fog.12 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to you from the midst of the fire:<br>	a voice of words you heard,<br>	but a form you did not see&mdash;<br>	only a voice!13 	He announced to you his covenant<br>	which he commanded you to observe,<br>	the Ten Words,<br>	and he wrote them down on two tablets of stone.14 	And me, <sc>Yhwh</sc> commanded at that time<br>	to teach you laws and regulations<br>	for you to observe them<br>	in the land that you are crossing into to possess.15 	So you are to take exceeding care for your selves—<br>	for you did not see any form<br>	on the day that <sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to you at Horev from the midst of the fire—16 	lest you wreak-ruin<br>	and make yourselves a carved form of any figure,17 	[in the] pattern of male or female,<br>	the pattern of any animal that is on earth,<br>	the pattern of any winged bird that flies in the heavens,18 	the pattern of any crawling-thing on the ground,<br>	the pattern of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth—19 	or lest you lift up your eyes toward the heavens<br>	and see the sun and the moon and the stars, all the forces of the heavens,<br>	and be lured away to bow down to them<br>	and serve them,<br>	whom <sc>Yhwh</sc> has apportioned for all the [other] peoples beneath all the heavens.20 	But you, <sc>Yhwh</sc> took<br>	and brought you out of the Iron Furnace, out of Egypt,<br>	to be for him a people of inheritance,<br>	as [is] this day.21 	Now <sc>Yhwh</sc> was incensed with me because of your words<br>	and he swore not to let me cross the Jordan,<br>	not to enter the good land that <sc>Yhwh</sc> is giving you as an inheritance.22 	For I am going to die in this land&mdash;<br>	I will not cross the Jordan!<br>	But <i>you</i> are crossing over and will take possession of this good land.23 	Take you care,<br>	lest you forget the covenant of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God which he cut with you,<br>	and you make yourselves a carved-image, the form of anything<br>	about which <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God commanded you!24 	For <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God—he is a consuming fire,<br>	a zealous God!25 @ 	When you beget children and children’s children<br>	and you grow old in the land:<br>	should you wreak ruin and make a carved-image in the form of anything,<br>	and do what is ill in the eyes of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God, provoking him:26 	I call-as-witness against you today the heavens and the earth,<br>	that you will perish, yes, perish quickly<br>	from off the land that you are crossing the Jordan thither to possess;<br>	you will not prolong days upon it,<br>	but you will be wiped out, yes, wiped out!27 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> will scatter you among the peoples,<br>	and you will be left as menfolk few-in-number<br>	among the nations whither <sc>Yhwh</sc> will lead you.28 	You will serve there gods made by human hands, of wood and of stone,<br>	which cannot see and cannot hear, and cannot eat and cannot smell.29 	But when you seek <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God from there<br>	you will find [him],<br>	if you search for him with all your heart and with all your being.30 	When you are in distress<br>	because there befall you all these things, in future days,<br>	you shall return to <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God and hearken to his voice.31 	For a compassionate God is <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God;<br>	he will not weaken you, he will not bring-ruin on you,<br>	he will not forget the covenant [with] your fathers which he swore to them.32 	For inquire, pray, of past days, which were before you:<br>	from the day that God created humankind on the earth, and from one edge of the heavens to the [other] edge of the heavens:<br>	has there ever been such a great thing,<br>	or anything heard like it?33 	Has a people ever heard the voice of a god speaking from the midst of the fire<br>	as you have heard, yourself,<br>	and remained-alive?34 	Or has a god ever essayed to come and take himself a nation from within a nation,<br>	with trials, signs, portents and deeds-of-war,<br>	with a strong hand and an outstretched arm<br>	and with great awe-inspiring [acts],<br>	exactly as <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God did in Egypt before your eyes?35 	You yourself have been made to see, to know<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc>—he is God,<br>	there is none else beside him!36 	From the heavens he had you hear his voice, to discipline you;<br>	on earth he had you see his great fire,<br>	and his words you heard from the midst of the fire.37 	Now since he loved your fathers,<br>	he chose their seed after them<br>	and brought you out with his presence with great power from Egypt,38 	to dispossess nations greater and mightier than you from before you,<br>	by bringing you out, by giving you their land as an inheritance, as is this day;39 	know today and lay it up in your heart,<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc>—he is God<br>	in the heavens above and on the earth beneath,<br>	[there is] none else!40 	You are to keep his laws and his commandments that I command you today,<br>	that it may go-well with you and with your children after you,<br>	in order that you may prolong days on the land<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God is giving you,<br>	all the days [to come].41 @ 	Then Moshe set apart three towns in [the country] across the Jordan, toward the rising of the sun,42 	for fleeing to [for] the murderer who murders his neighbor with no forethought,<br>	where he did not bear-hatred toward him from yesterday [and the] day-before,<br>	and so can flee to one of these towns and stay-alive:43 	Betzer in the wilderness of the plateau land, belonging to the Re’uvenites,<br>	Ra’mot in Gil’ad, belonging to the Gadites,<br>	and Golan in Bashan, belonging to the Menashites.44 	This is the Instruction that Moshe set before the Children of Israel;45 	these are the precepts and the laws and the regulations that Moshe declared to the Children of Israel when they went out from Egypt,46 	in [the country] across the Jordan, in the valley opposite Bet Pe’or,<br>	in the land of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who sat [as ruler] in Heshbon,<br>	whom Moshe and the Children of Israel struck, when they went out from Egypt;47 	they took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan—<br>	the two kings of the Amorites who [were] in [the country] across the Jordan, [toward] the rising of the sun,48 	from Aro’er that is on the bank of the Wadi Arnon, as far as Mount Si’on/Peak—that is Hermon,49 	and all the Plain across the Jordan, toward sunrise, as far as the Sea of the Plain, beneath the slopes of the Pisga [Range].5:1 @ 	Moshe called all Israel [together] and said to them:<br>	Hearken, O Israel,<br>	to the laws and the regulations<br>	that I am speaking in your ears today!<br>	You are to learn them,<br>	you are to take care to observe them!2 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> our God cut with us a covenant at Horev.3 	Not with our fathers did <sc>Yhwh</sc> cut this covenant,<br>	but with us, yes, us, those here today,<br>	all of us [who are] alive!4 	Face to face did <sc>Yhwh</sc> speak with you on the mountain,<br>	from the midst of the fire5 	—I myself was standing between <sc>Yhwh</sc> and you at that time,<br>	to report to you the word of <sc>Yhwh</sc>;<br>	for you were afraid of the fire,<br>	and would not go up on the mountain—<br>	saying:6 @ 	I am <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God<br>	who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of a house of serfs.   	<br>  You are not to have other gods beside my presence.7 	You are not to make yourself a carved-image of any form<br>	that is in the heavens above, that is on the earth beneath, that is in the waters beneath the earth.8 	You are not to bow down to them, you are not to serve them,<br>	for I, <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God, am a zealous God,<br>	calling-to-account the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons to the third and to the fourth [generation] of those that hate me,9 	but showing loyalty to thousands<br>	of those that love me, of those that keep my commandments.10 @ 	You are not to take up the name of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God for emptiness,<br>	for <sc>Yhwh</sc> will not clear him that takes up his name for emptiness!11 	Keep the day of Sabbath, by hallowing it,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God has commanded you.12 	For six days you are to serve and to make all your work;13 	but the seventh day<br>	is Sabbath for <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God—<br>	you are not to make any work:<br>	you, and your son, and your daughter,<br>	and your servant, and your maid,<br>	and your ox, and your donkey, and any of your beasts,<br>	and your sojourner who is in your gates—<br>	in order that your servant and your maid may rest as one-like-yourself.14	You are to bear-in-mind that serf were you in the land of Egypt,<br>	but <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God took you out from there with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm;<br>	therefore <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God commands you to observe the day of the Sabbath.15 @ 	Honor your father and your mother,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God has commanded you,<br>	in order that your days may be prolonged,<br>	and in order that it may go-well with you on the land that <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God is giving you.16 @    You are not to murder!<br>	And you are not to adulter!<br>	And you are not to steal!<br>	And you are not to testify against your neighbor as a lying witness!17 	And you are not to desire the wife of your neighbor;<br>	you are not to crave the house of your neighbor,<br>	his field, or his servant, or his maid, his ox or his donkey,<br>	or anything that belongs to your neighbor!18 @ 	These words <sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to your entire assembly at the mountain<br>	from the midst of the fire, the cloud, and the fog,<br>	[with] a great voice, and did not add [to them];<br>	and he wrote them on the two tablets of stone<br>	and gave them to me.19 	And it was, when you heard the voice from the midst of the darkness,<br>	while the mountain was burning with fire,<br>	that you came near to me, all the heads of your tribes and your elders,20 	and you said:<br>	Here, <sc>Yhwh</sc> our God has let us see all his Glory and his greatness,<br>	and his voice we have heard from the midst of the fire.<br>	This day we have seen that God can speak to humans and they can remain-alive!21 	But now, why should we die?<br>	For it will consume us, this great fire;<br>	if we continue to hear the voice of <sc>Yhwh</sc> our God anymore,<br>	we will die!22 	For who is there of all flesh<br>	that has [ever] heard the voice of the living God speaking from the midst of the fire, as we have,<br>	and remained-alive?23 	<i>You</i> go near and hear all that <sc>Yhwh</sc> our God says;<br>	and <i>you</i> speak to us all that <sc>Yhwh</sc> our God speaks to you&mdash;<br>	we will hearken and we will do [it]!24 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> hearkened to the voice of your words when you spoke to me;<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to me:<br>	I have heard the voice of this people’s words that they have spoken to you;<br>	it is well, all that they have spoken!25 	Who would give that this heart of theirs would [always] belong to them, to hold me in awe and keep all my commandments, all the days [to come],<br>	in order that it might go well with them and with their children, for the ages!26 	Go, say to them:<br>	Return you to your tents!27 	As for you, remain-standing here beside me,<br>	that I may speak to you all the commandment, the laws and the regulations that you are to teach them,<br>	that they may observe [them] in the land that I am giving them to possess.28 	You are to take care to observe as <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God has commanded you;<br>	you are not to turn aside to the right or to the left.29 	In all the way that <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God has commanded you, you are to walk,<br>  in order that you may remain-alive, and it may be-well with you,<br>	and you may prolong days in the land that you are possessing.6:1 @ 	Now this is the commandment, the laws and the regulations<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God has commanded [me] to teach you<br>	to observe in the land that you are crossing into to possess,2 	in order that you may hold <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God in awe,<br>	by keeping all his laws and his commandments that I command you,<br>	you, and your child, and your child’s child,<br>	all the days of your life,<br>	and in order that your days may be prolonged.3 	You are to hearken, O Israel,<br>	and are to take care to observe [them],<br>	that it may go-well with you,<br>	that you may become exceedingly many,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc>, the God of your fathers promised to you—<br>	[in] a land flowing with milk and honey.4 @ 	Hearken O Israel:<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> our God, <sc>Yhwh</sc> is One!5 	So you are to love <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God<br>	with all your heart, with all your being, with all your substance!6 	And these words, which I myself command you today, are to be upon your heart.7 	You are to repeat them with your children<br>	and are to speak of them<br>	in your sitting in your house and in your walking in the way,<br>	in your lying down and in your rising up.8 	You are to tie them as a sign upon your hand,<br>	and they are to be for bands between your eyes.9 	And you are to write them upon the doorposts of your house and on your gates.10 @ 	Now it shall be<br>	when <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God brings you to the land that he swore to your fathers, to Avraham, to Yitzhak, and to Yaakov, to give you<br>	&mdash;towns great and good that you did not build,11 	houses full of every good-thing that you did not fill,<br>	cisterns hewn out that you did not hew,<br>	vineyards and olive-groves that you did not plant&mdash;<br>	and you eat and you are satisfied,12 	take you care,<br>	lest you forget <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of a house of serfs.13 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> your God you are to hold-in-awe,<br>	him you are to serve,<br>	by his name you are to swear!14 	You are not to walk after other gods<br>	from the gods of the peoples that are around you,15 	for a jealous God is <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God in your midst—<br>	lest the anger of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God flare up against you<br>	and he wipe you out from off the face of the earth.16 	You are not to test <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God<br>	as you tested him at Massa/Testing!17 	Keep, yes, keep the commandment of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	and his precepts and his laws that he commanded you.18 	You are to do what is right and what is good in the eyes of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	in order that it may go-well with you,<br>	so that you may come and take possession of the good land that <sc>Yhwh</sc> swore to your fathers,19 	to push out all your enemies before you,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> has promised.20 @ 	When your child asks you on the morrow, saying:<br>	What [mean] the precepts, the laws, and the regulations that <sc>Yhwh</sc> our God has commanded you?21 	Then you are to say to your child:<br>	Serfs were we to Pharaoh in Egypt,<br>	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> took us out of Egypt with a strong hand;22 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> placed signs and portents, great and evil-ones, on Egypt, on Pharaoh and all his house, before our eyes.23 	And us he took out of there<br>	in order to bring us, to give us the land that he swore to our fathers;24 	so <sc>Yhwh</sc> has commanded us to observe all these laws,<br>	to hold <sc>Yhwh</sc> our God in awe,<br>	to have it be-well with us all the days [to come],<br>	to keep-us-alive, as [is] this day.25 	And righteous-merit will it be for us<br>	when we take care to observe all this commandment<br>	before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc> our God,<br>	as he commanded us.7:1 @ 	When <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God brings you to the land that you are entering to possess,<br>	and dislodges great nations before you<br>	—the Hittite, the Girgashite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perrizite, the Hivvite, and the Yevusite—<br>	seven nations more numerous and mightier [in number] than you,2 	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God gives them before you and you strike them down:<br>	you are to devote-them-to-destruction, yes, destruction;<br>	you are not to cut with them a covenant, you are not to show-them-mercy!3 	And you are not to marry them:<br>	your daughter you are not to give to their son, their daughter you are not to take for your son—4 	for they would turn aside your son from [following] after me<br>	and they would serve other gods,<br>	and the anger of <sc>Yhwh</sc> would flare up against you, and he would quickly wipe you out.5 	Rather, thus are you to do to them:<br>	their altars you are to wreck,<br>	their standing-pillars you are to smash,<br>	their sacred-trees you are to cut-to-shreds,<br>	and their carved-images you are to burn with fire!6 	For you are a people holy to <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God;<br>	[it is] you [whom] <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God chose for him as a treasured people<br>	from among all peoples that are on the face of the ground.7 	Not because of your being many-more than all the peoples<br>	has <sc>Yhwh</sc> attached himself to you and chosen you,<br>	for you are the least-numerous of all peoples!8 	Rather, because of <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> love for you<br>	and because of his keeping the sworn-oath that he swore to your fathers<br>	did <sc>Yhwh</sc> take you out, with a strong hand,<br>	and redeem you from a house of serfs,<br>	from the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt.9 	Know<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God, he is God,<br>	the trustworthy God,<br>	keeping the covenant of loyalty with those who love him and with those who keep his commandments,<br>	to the thousandth generation,10 	and paying back those who hate him to his face, by causing them to perish—<br>	he does not delay [punishment] to those who hate him to his face; he pays them back!11 	So you are to keep the command: the laws and the regulations that I command you today, by observing them.12 	Now it shall be:<br>	because of your hearkening to these regulations, by keeping and observing [them],<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> will keep for you the covenant of loyalty that he swore to your fathers;13 	he will love you, he will bless you, and he will make-you-many;<br>	he will bless the fruit of your belly and the fruit of your land,<br>	your grain, your new-wine, and your shining-oil,<br>	the offspring of your cattle and the fecundity of your sheep,<br>	on the land that he swore to your fathers, to give you.14 	Blessed shall you be above all peoples:<br>	there shall not be among you a barren-male or barren-female, nor among your animals.15 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> will remove from you all sickness,<br>	and all evil illnesses from Egypt that you know, he will not put [any of] them upon you,<br>	but will place them upon all those who hate you.16 	You shall devour all the peoples that <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God gives to you;<br>	your eye is not to pity them,<br>	you are not to serve their gods,<br>	for that is a snare to you!17 	If you should say in your heart:<br>	More numerous are these nations than I;<br>	how will I be able to dispossess them?18 	Do not be afraid of them;<br>	bear-in-mind, yes, in mind, what <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt—19 	the great trials that your eyes saw,<br>	the signs and the portents, the strong hand and the outstretched arm<br>	by which <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God took you out—<br>	thus will <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.20 	And also the hornet, <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God will send-loose upon them,<br>	until they perish, those left and those hidden from you.21 	Do not be terrified before them,<br>	for <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God is among you,<br>	a God great and awe-inspiring.22 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> your God will dislodge these nations before you, little by little;<br>	you may not finish them off quickly, lest the wildlife of the field become too-many for you.23 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> your God will give them before you;<br>	he will panic them with a great panic<br>	until they are wiped out.24 	He will give their kings into your hand,<br>	so that you cause their name to perish from under the heavens;<br>	no man will be able to stand up against you<br>	until you have wiped them out.25 	The carved-images of their gods, you are to burn with fire,<br>	you are not to come-to-yearn for [the] silver and gold on account of them, <br>	and so take it for yourself,<br>	lest you be ensnared by it—<br>	for it is an abomination to <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God!26 	You are not to bring an abomination into your house<br>	—you would become devoted-for-destruction like it!—<br>	you are to hold-it-in-disgust, yes, disgust,<br>	you are to consider-it-abominable, yes, abominable,<br>	for it is [something] devoted-for-destruction!8:1 @ 	All the commandment that I command you today,<br>	you are to take care to observe,<br>	in order that you may live and become-many and enter and possess the land<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> swore to your fathers.2 	You are to bear-in-mind the whole route that <sc>Yhwh</sc> had you go<br>	these forty years in the wilderness,<br>	in order to afflict you, by testing you,<br>	to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments, or not.3 	So he afflicted you and made you hungry,<br>	and had you eat the <i>mahn</i><br>	which you had not known and which your fathers had not known,<br>	in order to make you know<br>	that not by bread alone do humans stay alive,<br>	but rather by all that issues from <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> mouth do humans stay alive.4 	Your garment did not wear out from upon you,<br>	your foot did not swell up,<br>	these forty years.5 	You are to know in your heart<br>	that just as a man disciplines his child,<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> your God disciplines you.6 	So you are to keep the commandment of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	to walk in his ways and to hold him in awe!7 	When <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God brings you into a good land,<br>	a land of streams of water, springs and Ocean-flows,<br>	issuing from valleys and hills,8 	a land of wheat and barley, vine, fig, and pomegranate,<br>    a land of olives, oil and honey,9 	&mdash;a land in which you will never eat bread in poverty;<br>	     you will not lack for anything in it&mdash;<br>	a land whose stones are iron,<br>	and from whose hills you may hew copper,10 	and you eat and are satisfied,<br>	you are to bless<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> your God<br>	for the good land that he has given you.11 	Take you care,<br>	lest you forget <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	by not keeping his commandments, his regulations, and his laws that I command you today,12 	lest [when] you eat and are satisfied,<br>	and build goodly houses and settle [there],13 	and your herds and your flocks become-many<br>	and silver and gold become-much for you,<br>	with all that belongs to you becoming-much—14 	that your heart become haughty<br>	and you forget <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	the one who brought you out from the land of Egypt, from a house of serfs,15 	the one who had you travel in the wilderness, great and awe-inspiring,<br>	[of] burning snakes and scorpions,<br>	and thirsty-soil where there is no water;<br>	the one who brought forth water for you, from the flinty rock,16 	the one who had you eat <i>mahn</i> in the wilderness,<br>	which your fathers had not known,<br>	in order to afflict you and in order to test you,<br>	for it to go-well with you, in your future.17 	And should you say in your heart:<br>	My power and the might of my hand have produced all this wealth for me,18 	then you must bear-in-mind <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	that he was the one who gave you the power to produce wealth,<br>	in order to establish his covenant that he swore to your fathers, as [is] this day.19 	Now it shall be<br>	if you forget, yes, forget <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God<br>	and walk after other gods,<br>	and serve them and bow down to them,<br>	I call-witness against you today<br>	that perish, you will perish;20 	like the nations that <sc>Yhwh</sc> is causing to perish before you,<br>	so shall you perish,<br>	because you did not hearken to the voice of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God!9:1 @ 	Hearken, O Israel:<br>	You are today crossing the Jordan<br>	to enter to dispossess nations greater and mightier [in number] than you:<br>	towns great and fortified up to heaven;2 	a people great and tall, the Children of the Anakites,<br>	of whom you yourself know, of whom you have heard [it said]:<br>	Who can stand up before the Children of Anak?—3 	You are to know today<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	<i>he</i> is the one who is crossing over before you,<br>	a consuming fire;<br>	he will wipe them out, he will subjugate them before you,<br>	so that you dispossess them, so that you cause them to perish quickly,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> promised you.4 	Do not say in your heart<br>	when <sc>Yhwh</sc> has pushed them out before you,<br>	saying:<br>	Because of my righteous-merit did <sc>Yhwh</sc> bring me in to possess this land,<br>	and because of the wickedness of these nations is <sc>Yhwh</sc> dispossessing them from before you!5 	Not because of your righteous-merit, or because of the uprightness of your heart, are you entering to possess their land,<br>	but rather because of the wickedness of these nations<br>	is <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God dispossessing them from before you,<br>	and in order that he might uphold the word that <sc>Yhwh</sc> swore to your fathers, to Avraham, to Yitzhak, and to Yaakov.6 	You are to know<br>	that not because of your righteous-merit is <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God giving you this good land to possess,<br>	for a people hard of neck are you!7 	Bear-in-mind, do not forget<br>	how you infuriated <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God in the wilderness;<br>	from the time that he took you out of Egypt until your coming to this place,<br>	you have been rebellious against <sc>Yhwh</sc>!8 	And at Horev you infuriated <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	so that <sc>Yhwh</sc> was incensed [enough] with you to wipe you out!9 	When I went up the mountain<br>	to receive the tablets of stone,<br>	the tablets of the covenant that <sc>Yhwh</sc> had cut with you,<br>	I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights:<br>	food I did not eat, and water I did not drink;10 	but <sc>Yhwh</sc> gave to me the two tablets of stone, written on by the finger of God,<br>	and upon them, corresponding to all the words that <sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke with you on the mountain, from the midst of the fire,<br>	on the day of the Assembly.11 	Now it was,<br>	at the end of forty days and forty nights,<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> gave to me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant.12 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to me:<br>	Arise, go down quickly from here,<br>	for they have wrought-ruin, your people, whom you took out of Egypt,<br>	they have quickly turned aside from the path that I commanded them:<br>	they have made themselves something-molten!13 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to me, saying:<br>	I see this people, and here, it is a hard necked people!14 	Let me be, that I may wipe them out;<br>	I will blot out their name from beneath the heavens,<br>	and I will make of you a nation mightier [in number] and many-more than they!15 	And I faced about and went down from the mountain<br>	—now the mountain was burning with fire—<br>	with the two tablets of the covenant in my two arms,16 	and I saw:<br>	here, you were sinning against <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God&mdash;you had made yourselves a molten calf;<br>	you had turned aside quickly from the way that <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded you!17 	And I grasped the two tablets<br>	and threw them from my two arms<br>	and smashed them before your eyes.18 	I lay-fallen before <sc>Yhwh</sc> as at the beginning [of the] forty days and forty nights;<br>	food I did not eat, and water I did not drink,<br>	because of all your sins that you sinned, by doing what was evil in the eyes of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, to provoke him.19 	For I was in dread of the anger and the venom with which <sc>Yhwh</sc> was furious with you, to destroy you;<br>	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> hearkened to me, also on that occasion.20 	But with Aharon, <sc>Yhwh</sc> was exceedingly incensed, [enough] to destroy him,<br>	but I interceded also on behalf of Aharon at that time.21 	Now as for your sinful-thing that you had made, the calf:<br>	I took [it] and burned it with fire,<br>	I beat it, well ground up, until it was crushed [into] fine dust,<br>	and I threw its dust into the stream that comes down the mountain.22 	And at Tav’era/Blazing and at Massa/Testing, and at Kivrot ha-Taava/Burial-Sites of Craving,<br>	you were infuriating <sc>Yhwh</sc>,23 	and [also] when <sc>Yhwh</sc> sent you on from Kadesh Barne’a, saying:<br>	Go up, possess the land that I am giving to you,<br>	you rebelled against the order of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God, and did not trust him and did not hearken to his voice.24 	Rebellious have you been against <sc>Yhwh</sc> from the [first] day that I knew you!25 	Now I lay-fallen before <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	for the forty days and the forty nights that I was fallen,<br>	when <sc>Yhwh</sc> said he would wipe you out,26 	and I interceded to <sc>Yhwh</sc> and said:<br>	My Lord <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	do not bring-ruin on your people, your inheritance<br>	whom you redeemed in your greatness,<br>	whom you took out of Egypt with a strong hand!27 	Bear-in-mind your servants, Avraham, Yitzhak, and Yaakov;<br>	do not face toward the hard-heartedness of this people or toward their wickedness or toward their sin,28 	lest the [people of the] land out of which you took them say:<br>	Because of <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> inability to bring them to the land which he had promised to them<br>	and because of his hatred for them<br>	did he take them out, to cause their death in the wilderness!29 	—And they are your people, your inheritance<br>	whom you took out in your great power and with your outstretched arm!10:1 	At that time <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to me:<br>	Carve yourself two tablets of stone, like the first ones,<br>	and come up to me, on the mountain,<br>	and make yourself a Coffer of wood.2 	I will write on the tablets the words that were on the tablets, the first-ones, that you smashed,<br>	and you are to put them in the Coffer.3 	So I made a Coffer of acacia wood,<br>	I carved out two tablets of stone, like the first ones,<br>	and I went up, on the mountain, with the two tablets in my arms.4 	And he wrote on the tablets according to the first writing,<br>	the Ten Words<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to you on the mountain, from the midst of the fire,<br>	on the day of the Assembly,<br>	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> gave them to me.5 	Then I faced about and came down the mountain,<br>	and I put the tablets in the Coffer that I had made,<br>	and they have remained there,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded me.6 @ 	The Children of Israel marched from the Wells of the Children of Ya’akan to Mosera;<br>	there Aharon died, and he was buried there,<br>	and El’azar his son served-as-priest in his stead.7 	From there they marched to Gudgoda,<br>	and from Gudgoda to Yotvata, a land of streams of water.8 	At that time <sc>Yhwh</sc> separated the tribe of Levi<br>	to carry the Coffer of <sc>Yhwh’s</sc> covenant, to stand before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc>, to attend on him and to give-blessing in his name,<br>	until this day.9 	Therefore Levi did not have an inheritable portion along with his brothers;<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> is his inheritance,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God promised him.10 	As for me, I stood on the mountain<br>	like the days, the first ones, forty days and forty nights,<br>	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> hearkened to me also on that occasion—<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> did not consent to bring-ruin upon you.11 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to me:<br>	Arise, go on the march before the people,<br>	so that they may enter and take possession of the land<br>	which I swore to their fathers, to give them.12 @ 	And now, O Israel,<br>	what does <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God ask of you<br>	except to hold <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God in awe,<br>	to walk in all his ways<br>	and to love him<br>	and to serve <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God with all your heart and with all your being,13 	to keep the commandments of <sc>Yhwh</sc> and his laws which I command you today,<br>	to have it go-well for you?14 	Here, <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God’s are<br>	the heavens and the heaven of heavens,<br>	the earth and all that is on it!15 	Only to your fathers was <sc>Yhwh</sc> attached, to love them, so he chose their seed after them,<br>	you, above all peoples,<br>	as [is] this day.16 	So circumcise the foreskin of your heart,<br>	your neck you are not to keep-hard anymore;17 	for <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	he is the God of gods and the Lord of lords,<br>	the God great, powerful, and awe-inspiring,<br>	he who lifts up no face [in favor] and takes no bribe,18 	provides justice [for] orphan and widow,<br>	and loves the sojourner, by giving him food and clothing.19 	So you are to love the sojourner,<br>	for sojourners were you in the land of Egypt!20 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> your God you are to hold-in-awe,<br>	him you are to serve,<br>	to him you are to cling,<br>	by his name you are to swear!21 	He is your praise, he is your God,<br>	who did for you these great and awe-inspiring [acts] that your eyes saw.22 	As seventy persons your fathers went down to Egypt,<br>	but now <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God has made you like the stars of the heavens in abundance!11:1 @ 	So you are to love <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	you are to keep his charge, and his laws, his regulations and his commandments,<br>	all the days [to come].2 	You are to know today<br>	that it is not with your children<br>	who did not know, who did not see<br>	the discipline of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	his greatness: his strong hand and his outstretched arm,3 	his portents and his deeds that he did in the midst of Egypt<br>	to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to all his land,4 	what he did to the army of Egypt, to its horses and its charioteers,<br>	how he caused the waters of the Red Sea to flow over their faces when they pursued you,<br>	so that <sc>Yhwh</sc> caused them to perish, until this day;5 	and what he did concerning you in the wilderness<br>	until your arrival, until this place;6 	and what he did concerning Datan and Aviram, the sons of Eliav, son of Re’uven,<br>	how the earth opened up its mouth and swallowed them and their households and their tents<br>	and all existing-things that were under their feet<br>	in the midst of all Israel;7 	indeed, [it is] your eyes that were seeing<br>	all the great deeds of <sc>Yhwh</sc> that he did.8 	So you are to keep all the commandment that I command you today,<br>	in order that you may have the strength to enter and to take possession of the land that you are crossing into to possess,9 	and in order that you may prolong days on the land that <sc>Yhwh</sc> swore to your fathers to give them and their seed,<br>	a land flowing with milk and honey.10 	For the land that you are entering to possess:<br>	it is not like the land of Egypt, from which you went out,<br>	where you sow your seed<br>	and water it with your foot like a garden of greens;11 	but the land that you are crossing into to possess is a land of highlands and cleft-valleys;<br>	from the rain of the heavens it drinks water&mdash;12 	a land whose [welfare] <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God seeks:<br>	regularly are the eyes of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God upon it,<br>	from the beginning of the year until the afterpart of the year.13 @ 	Now it shall be:<br>	if you hearken, yes, hearken to my commandments that I command you today,<br>	to love <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God and to serve him with all your heart and with all your being:14 	I will give forth the rain of your land in its due-time, shooting-rain and later-rain;<br>	you shall gather in your grain, your new-wine and your shining-oil;15 	I will give forth herbage in your field, for your animals,<br>	and you will eat and you will be satisfied.16 	Take you care,<br>	lest your heart be seduced,<br>	so that you turn aside and serve other gods and bow down to them,17 	and the anger of <sc>Yhwh</sc> flare up against you<br>	so that he shuts up the heavens, and there is no rain,<br>	and the earth does not give forth its yield,<br>	and you perish quickly from off the good land that <sc>Yhwh</sc> is giving you!18 	You are to place these my words upon your heart and upon your being;<br>	you are to tie them as a sign on your hand,<br>	and let them be as bands between your eyes;19 	you are to teach them to your children, by speaking of them<br>	in your sitting in your house, in your walking on the way,<br>	in your lying down, in your rising up;20 	you are to write them upon the doorposts of your house, and on your gates,21 	in order that your days may be many, along with the days of your children<br>	on the land that <sc>Yhwh</sc> swore to your fathers, to give them<br>	[as long] as the days of the heavens over the earth.22 @ 	Indeed, if you will keep, yes, keep all this commandment that I command you to observe,<br>	to love <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God, to walk in his ways and to cling to him,23 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> will dispossess all these nations from before you,<br>	and you will dispossess nations greater and mightier [in number] than you.24 	Every place that the sole of your foot treads, yours shall it be:<br>	from the wilderness and the Lebanon,<br>	from the River, the river Euphrates, as far as the Hindward Sea<br>	shall be your territory.25 	No man will be able to stand up against you;<br>	terror of you and awe of you, <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God will place upon all the land upon which you tread,<br>	as he promised to you.26 	See,<br>	I place before you today a blessing and a curse:27 	the blessing,<br>	[provided] that you hearken to the commandments of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God that I command you today,28 	and the curse,<br>	if you do not hearken to the commandments of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	and turn aside from the way that I command you today,<br>	walking after other gods whom you have not known.29 	Now it shall be<br>	when <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God brings you into the land that you are entering to possess,<br>	you are to give the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Eval30 	—are they not in [the country] across the Jordan, along the path of the coming in of the sun,<br>	in the land of the Canaanites, who are settled in the Plain, opposite the Gilgal/Stone-Circle, near the Oaks of Moreh?31 	For you are crossing the Jordan to enter to take possession of the land that <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God is giving you;<br>	[when] you take possession of it and settle in it,32 	you are to take care to observe all the laws and the regulations that I place before you today.12:1 @ 	These are the laws and the regulations that you are to take care to observe<br>	in the land that <sc>Yhwh</sc> the God of your fathers has given you to possess,<br>	all the days that you live on the land:2 	you are to demolish, yes, demolish, all the [sacred] places<br>	where the nations that you are dispossessing served their gods,<br>	on the high hills and on the mountains<br>	and beneath every luxuriant tree;3 	you are to wreck their altars,<br>	you are to smash their standing-pillars,<br>	their Asherot/Sacred-Poles you are to burn with fire,<br>	and the carved-images of their gods, you are to cut-to-shreds—<br>	so that you cause their name to perish from that place!4 	You are not to do thus with <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God;5 	rather, to the place that <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God chooses from among all your tribes<br>	to put his name there, to have it dwell,<br>	you are to inquire and are to come there,6 	you are to bring there your offerings-up and your sacrifices,<br>	your tithings and the contributions of your hands,<br>	your vow-offerings and your freewill-offerings,<br>	the firstborn of your herds and of your flocks.7 	And you are to eat there, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	and you are to rejoice in all the enterprises of your hand,<br>	you and your households,<br>	with which <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God has blessed you.8 	You are not to do—exactly as we are doing here today—<br>	each one, whatever is right in his [own] eyes,9 	for until now you have not come<br>	to the resting-place, to the inheritance that <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God is giving you.10 	[When] you cross the Jordan<br>	and settle in the land that <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God is causing you to inherit,<br>	and he gives-rest to you from all your enemies round about,<br>	and you settle [in it] in security:11 	it shall be, in the place<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God chooses to have his name dwell,<br>	there you are to bring all that I command you:<br>	your offerings-up and your sacrifices,<br>	your tithings and the contribution of your hands,<br>	and all your choicest vow-offerings that you vow to <sc>Yhwh</sc>.12 	And you are to rejoice before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	you, your sons and your daughters,<br>	your servants and your maids,<br>	and the Levite who is within your gates,<br>	for he has no portion or inheritance with you.13 	Take you care,<br>	lest you offer-up your offerings-up<br>	in any place you might see.14 	Rather, in the place that <sc>Yhwh</sc> chooses in one of your tribal-districts,<br>	there you are to offer-up your offerings-up,<br>	there you are to observe all that I command you.15 	Only: in all your appetite’s craving you may slay [animals]<br>	and may eat meat according to the blessing of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God<br>	that he has given you within all your gates;<br>	the <i>tamei</i> and the pure [alike] may eat it,<br>	as [of] the deer, so [of] the gazelle.16 	Only: the blood you are not to eat;<br>	on the earth you are to pour it out, like water.17 	You may not

[grapes in] your vineyard, you are not to glean after you;<br>	for the sojourner, for the orphan and for the widow it shall be.22 	You are to bear-in-mind that serf were you in the land of Egypt;<br>	therefore I command you to do this thing!25:1 @ 	When there is a legal-quarrel between men,<br>	they are to approach the court-of-justice, and they are to render-justice to them:<br>	they are to declare-innocent the innocent one, and to declare-guilty the guilty one.2 	And it shall be:<br>	if deserving of strokes is the guilty-one,<br>	the judge is to have him lie-fallen and is to have him struck, in his presence,<br>	according to his guilt, by number.3 	Forty [times] he is to be struck; you are not to add [any],<br>	lest you add, by striking him, [too] many strokes to these,<br>	and your brother be worthy-of-insult in your eyes.4 @ 	You are not to muzzle an ox while it is threshing [grain].5 @	When brothers dwell together<br>	and one of them dies, and has no son,<br>	the wife of the dead-man is not to go outside [in marriage], to a strange man:<br>	her brother-in-law is to come to her and take her for himself as a wife, doing-the-brother-in-law’s-duty by her.6 	Now it shall be that the firstborn that she bears will be established under the name of his dead brother,<br>	so that his name not be blotted out from Israel.7 	But if the man does not wish to take his sister-in-law [in marriage],<br>	his sister-in-law is to go up to the gate, to the elders, and say:<br>	My brother-in-law refuses to establish for his brother a name in Israel;<br>	he will not consent to do-a-brother-in-law’s-duty by me!8 	Then the elders of his town are to call for him and are to speak to him,<br>	and if he stands fast and says: I do not wish to take her,9 	his sister-in-law is to approach him before the eyes of the elders,<br>	she is to draw off his sandal from his foot<br>	and is to spit in his face;<br>	then she is to speak up and say:<br>	Thus shall be done to the man that does not build up the house of his brother!10 	His name is to be called in Israel: The House of the [One with the] Drawn-Off Sandal.11 @ 	When men scuffle together, a man and his brother,<br>	and the wife of one of them comes near to rescue her husband from the hand of him that is striking him,<br>	and she stretches out her hand and seizes [him] by his genitals:12 	you are to chop off her hand&mdash;your eye is not to have pity!13 @ 	You are not to have in your purse stone-weight and stone-weight, [both] large and small.14 	You are not to have in your house <i>efa</i> and <i>efa,</i> [both] large and small.15 	A stone-weight perfect and equal shall you have, an <i>efa</i> perfect and equal shall you have,<br>	in order that your days may be prolonged on the land that <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God is giving you.16 	For an abomination to <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God is everyone doing these,<br>	everyone committing corruption!17 @ 	Bear-in-mind what Amalek did to you<br>	on the way, at your going out from Egypt,18 	how he encountered you on the way<br>	and attacked-your-tail—all the beaten-down ones at your rear—<br>	while you [were] weary and faint,<br>	and [thus] he did not stand-in-awe of God.19 	So it shall be:<br>	when <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God gives-you-rest from all your enemies round about<br>	in the land that <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God is giving you as an inheritance, to possess it,<br>	you are to blot out the name of Amalek from under the heavens;<br>	you are not to forget!26:1 @ 	Now it shall be:<br>	when you enter the land<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God is giving you as an inheritance,<br>	and you possess it and settle in it,2 	you are to take from the premier-part of all the fruit of the ground<br>	that you produce from your land that <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God is giving you;<br>	you are to put it in a basket<br>	and are to go to the place<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God chooses to have his name dwell.3 	And you are to come to the priest who is [there] in those days,<br>	and you are to say to him:<br>	“I announce today to <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God<br>	that I have entered the land that <sc>Yhwh</sc> swore to our fathers, to give us.”4 	Then the priest is to take the basket from your hand<br>	and is to deposit it before the altar of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God.5 	And you are to speak up and say, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God:<br>	“An Aramean Astray my Ancestor;<br>	he went down to Egypt and sojourned there, as menfolk few-in-number,<br>	but he became there a nation, great, mighty [in number] and many.6 	Now the Egyptians dealt-ill with us and afflicted us,<br>	and placed upon us hard servitude.7 	So we cried out to <sc>Yhwh</sc>, the God of our fathers,<br>	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> hearkened to our voice:<br>	he saw our affliction, and our strain, and our oppression,8 	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> took us out from Egypt,<br>	with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm,<br>	with great awe-inspiring [acts]<br>	and with signs and portents,9 	and he brought us to this place<br>	and gave us this land,<br>	a land flowing with milk and honey.10 	So now—<br>	here, I have brought the premier-part of the fruits of the ground<br>	that you have given me, O <sc>Yhwh</sc>!”<br>	Then you are to deposit it before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God<br>	and are to bow down before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God;11 	and you are to rejoice in all the good-things that <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God has given you and your household,<br>	you and the Levite and the sojourner who is in your midst.12 @ 	When you finish tithing all the tithe of your produce<br>	in the third year, the year of the tithe,<br>	you are to give [it] to the Levite, to the sojourner, to the orphan and to the widow;<br>	that they may eat [it] within your gates, and be satisfied.13 	And you are to say, before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God:<br>	“I have removed the holy-part from the house,<br>	and I have also given [it] to the Levite, to the sojourner, to the orphan and to the widow,<br>	exactly as your command that you have commanded me;<br>	I have not crossed-over away from your commandments, I have not forgotten:14 	I have not eaten of it while in sorrow,<br>	I have not removed any of it [while] <i>tamei,</i><br>	I have not given any of it to the dead!<br>	I have hearkened to the voice of <sc>Yhwh</sc> my God,<br>	I have done exactly as you have commanded me!15 	Look down from your holy abode, from heaven,<br>	and bless your people, Israel,<br>	and the ground that you have given us,<br>	as you swore to our fathers,<br>	a land flowing with milk and honey.”16 @ 	This day<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> your God commands you to observe these laws and the regulations;<br>	you are to take care and observe them<br>	with all your heart and with all your being.17 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> you have declared today, to be for you a god,<br>	to walk in his ways and to keep his laws, his commandments and his regulations,<br>	and to hearken to his voice.18 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> has declared you today, to be for him a specially-treasured people,<br>	as he promised you,<br>	to be careful [regarding] all his commandments,19 	and to set you most-high above all the nations that he has made,<br>	for praise, for fame, and for honor,<br>	for you to be a people holy to <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	as he promised.27:1 @ 	Now Moshe and the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying:<br>	Keep all this commandment that I command you today!2 	And it shall be:<br>	at the time that you cross the Jordan<br>	into the land that <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God is giving you,<br>	you are to set up for yourself great stones<br>	and are to plaster them with plaster;3 	you are to write on them all the words of this Instruction, when you cross over,<br>	in order that you may enter the land that <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God is giving you,<br>	a land flowing with milk and honey,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc>, the God of your fathers, promised you.4 	Now it shall be, on your crossing the Jordan:<br>	set up these stones<br>	about which I command you today, on Mount Eval,<br>	and plaster them with plaster.5 	You are to build there an altar to <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	an altar of stones;<br>	you are not to swing against them [any] iron.6 	Of complete stones you are to build the altar of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God;<br>	you are to offer-up on it offerings-up to <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God.7 	[When] you sacrifice <i>shalom</i>-offerings, you may eat [them] there,<br>	and you are to rejoice<br>	before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God.8 	And you are to write on the stones<br>	all the words of this Instruction,<br>	explained well.9 @ 	Now Moshe and the Levitical priests spoke<br>	to all Israel, saying:<br>	Be silent and hearken, O Israel:<br>	this day you are becoming a people to <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God.10 	You are to hearken to the voice of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	you are to observe his commandments and his laws that I command you today!11 	And Moshe commanded the people at that time, saying:12 	These you are to stand to bless the people, on Mount Gerizim,<br>	when you have crossed the Jordan:<br>	Shim’on, Levi, and Yehuda,<br>	Yissakhar, Yosef, and Binyamin.13 	And these you are to stand for the curse, on Mount Eval:<br>	Re’uven, Gad, and Asher,<br>	Zevulun, Dan, and Naftali.14 	And all the Levites are to speak up and say to every man of Israel,<br>	[with] voice raised:15 @ 	Damned be the one<br>	who makes a carved-image or molten-thing, an abomination to

blessings, and overtake you,<br>	since you have hearkened to the voice of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God:3 	blessed be you, in the town,<br>	blessed be you, in the [open] field;4 	blessed be the fruit of your womb, the fruit of your land, and the fruit of your animals,<br>	the offspring of your cattle and the fecundity of your sheep.5 	Blessed be your basket and your kneading-bowl.6 	Blessed be you, in your coming in,<br>	blessed be you, in your going out.7 	May <sc>Yhwh</sc> make your enemies, those that rise against you,<br>	be defeated before you;<br>	by one road they will go out against

God<br>	and walk in his ways.10 	And all the peoples of the earth will see<br>	that the name of <sc>Yhwh</sc> is proclaimed over you,<br>	and they will hold you in awe.11 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> will leave-excess for you of good-things,<br>	in the fruit of your womb, the fruit of your animals, and the fruit of your land,<br>	on the land that <sc>Yhwh</sc> swore to your fathers, to give them.12 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> will open for you his goodly treasuries, the heavens,<br>	by giving the rain of your land in its set-time,<br>	and by blessing all the doings of your hand;<br>	you will lend to many nations,<br>	but you yourself will not have to take-a-loan.13 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> will make you the head and not the tail,<br>	you will only be up, you will not be down,<br>	—if you hearken to the commandments of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God<br>	which I command you today, by taking care and by observing [them],14 	that you not turn aside from all the words that I command you today,<br>	to the right or to the left,<br>	by walking after other gods, by serving them.15 @ 	But it shall be:<br>	If you do not hearken to the voice of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	by taking care and by observing all his commandments and his laws<br>	that I command you today,<br>	then there will come upon you all these curses, and overtake you:16 	cursed be you in the town,<br>	damned be you in the open-field;17 	cursed be your basket and your kneading-bowl,18 	cursed be the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your land,<br>	the offspring of your cattle and the fecundity of your sheep;19 	cursed be you in your coming in,<br>	and damned be you in your going out.20 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> will send forth against you<br>	Curse, Bewilderment and Reproach,<br>	against all the enterprises of your hand that you do,<br>	until you are wiped out, until you perish quickly<br>	because of the evil of your deeds by which you have abandoned me.21 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> will make the pestilence cling to you,<br>	until it has finished you off from the land that you are entering to possess.22 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> will strike you<br>	with consumption, with fever and with inflammation,<br>	with violent-fever and with dehydration,<br>	with blight and with jaundice;<br>	they will pursue you until you perish.23 	The heavens that are above your head will become bronze,<br>	and the earth that is beneath you, iron.24 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> will make the rain of your land powder and dust;<br>	from the heavens it will come-down upon you<br>	until you are wiped out.25 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> will cause you to be defeated before your enemies:<br>	by one road you will go out against them,<br>	but by seven roads you will flee before them—<br>	you will become an object-of-fright to all the kingdoms of the earth.26 	Your corpse will be for eating<br>	for all the birds of the heavens and for the beasts of the earth,<br>	with none to make [them] tremble.27 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> will strike you<br>	with boils of Egypt<br>	and with tumors, with scabs, and with itching,<br>	from which you cannot be healed;28 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> will strike you<br>	with madness, with blindness, and with confusion of heart.29 	You will feel about at noon<br>	like a blind-person feels about in deep-darkness,<br>	you will not make your way succeed;<br>	you will be oh so withheld from and robbed all the days,<br>	with no deliverer.30 	A woman you will betroth, but another man will lie with her,<br>	a house you will build, but you will not dwell in it,<br>	a vineyard you will plant, but you will not put-it-to-use,31 	your ox [will be] slaughtered before your eyes, but you will not eat of it,<br>	your donkey will be robbed [from you] in front of you, but it will not return to you,<br>	your sheep will be given to your enemies,<br>	with no deliverer for you.32 	Your sons and your daughters will be given to another people,<br>	while your eyes look on and languish for them all the day,<br>	with no God-power to your hand.33 	The fruit of your land and all that-you-toil-for<br>	will be consumed by a people that you have not known,<br>	you will be only withheld from and downtrodden all the days,34 	and you will go mad from the sight of your eyes that you see!35 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> will strike you<br>	with evil boils upon the knees and upon the thighs,<br>	from which you cannot be healed,<br>	from the sole of your foot up to your crown.36 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> will drive you and your king whom you have raised over you<br>	to a nation that you have not known, you and your fathers,<br>	and you shall serve there other gods, of wood and of stone.37 	You will become an [example of] desolation, a proverb and a byword<br>	among all the peoples to which <sc>Yhwh</sc> drives you.38 	Much seed will you take out to the field, but little will you gather in,<br>	for locusts will ravage them.39 	Vineyards you will plant and till, but their wine you will not drink, nor will you store [it],<br>	for the worm will devour them.40 	Olive trees you will have throughout all your territory, but oil you will not [get to] pour-for-anointing,<br>	for your olives will drop off.41 	Sons and daughters you will beget, but they will not be yours,<br>	for they will go into captivity.42 	All the trees and the fruit of your soil, the buzzing-cricket will possess.43 	The sojourner who is in your midst<br>	will rise-high above you, higher [and] higher,<br>	while you descend lower and lower;44 	he will lend to you, but you will not lend to him;<br>	he will become the head, but you will become the tail.45 @ 	Now when there come upon you all these curses,<br>	and pursue you and overtake you,<br>	until you have been wiped out,<br>	since you did not hearken to the voice of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	to keep his commandments and his regulations that I commanded you,46 	they will be for you a sign and a portent,<br>	and for your seed, for the ages—47 	because you did not serve <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God in joy and in good-feeling of heart out of the abundance of everything.48 	So you will have to serve your enemies, whom <sc>Yhwh</sc> will send forth against you,<br>	in famine and in thirst, in nakedness and in lack of everything;<br>	he will put a yoke of iron upon your neck,<br>	until his wiping you out.49 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> will raise up against you<br>	a nation from afar, from the edge of the earth,<br>	like an eagle swooping down,<br>	a nation whose language you do not understand,50 	a nation fierce of countenance<br>	that does not lift up the countenance of the elderly<br>	and [to] youths shows-no-mercy.51 	It will devour the fruit of your animals and the fruit of your land,<br>	until you have been wiped out;<br>	it will not leave for you grain, new-wine, or shining-oil,<br>	the offspring of your cattle or the fecundity of your sheep,<br>	until it has caused-you-to-perish.52 	It will besiege you within all your gates,<br>	until the collapse of your walls, high and fortified,<br>	in which you were feeling-secure throughout all your land,<br>	and will besiege you within all your gates, throughout all your land<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God has given you.53 	You will consume the fruit of your womb,<br>	the flesh of your sons and of your daughters<br>	that he has given you, <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	in the siege and in the straits with which your enemy puts-you-in-straits.54 	The softest man among you, the one exceedingly daintiest—<br>	his eye shall be too set-on-evil toward his brother, toward the wife of his bosom,<br>	and toward the rest of his children that he has spared55 	to give to [even] one of them some of the flesh of his children that he eats,<br>	because he has nothing left of anything<br>	in the siege and in the straits with which your enemy puts-you-in-straits, within all your gates.56 	[She] softest among you, the daintiest one,<br>	whose sole of foot has not essayed to be placed upon the earth<br>	out of daintiness and out of being soft—<br>	her eye shall be set-on-evil against the husband of her bosom,<br>	against her son and against her daughter,57 	against her afterbirth that goes out from between her legs<br>	and against her children that she bears;<br>	indeed, she shall eat them, out of lack of everything, in secret,<br>	in the siege and in the straits with which your enemy puts-you-in-straits, within your gates.58 	If you do not carefully observe all the words of this Instruction,<br>	those written in this record,<br>	to hold-in-awe the Name, this honored and awe-inspiring one,<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,59 	then <sc>Yhwh</sc> will make-extraordinary the blows [against] you<br>	and the blows [against] your seed,<br>	blows great and lasting,<br>	sicknesses evil and lasting;60 	he will return upon you every illness of Egypt<br>	from which you shrank-in-fear,<br>	so that they cling to you;61 	also every sickness and every blow that is not written in this Record of Instruction<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> will bring up against you,<br>	until you have been wiped out;62 	you will be left menfolk few-in-number,<br>	in place of your having-been like the stars of the heavens in abundance,<br>	since you did not hearken to the voice of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God.63 	And it shall be:<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> once delighted in you<br>	by doing good for you and by making-you-many,<br>	thus will <sc>Yhwh</sc> delight in you<br>	by causing you to perish and by wiping you out,<br>	and you shall be pulled up from the land that you are entering to possess.64 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> will scatter you among all the peoples,<br>	from the edge of the earth to the [other] edge of the earth;<br>	you will serve there other gods, whom you have not known, you and your fathers,<br>	of wood and of stone.65 	Yet among those nations you shall not find-repose,<br>	nor shall there be rest for the sole of your foot:<br>	<sc>Yhwh</sc> will give you there a shuddering heart, failing eyes and languishing breath.66 	Your life will hang-by-a-thread before you,<br>	you will be terrified night and day,<br>	and you will not trust in [the security of] your life.67 	At daybreak you will say: Who would make it sunset!<br>	And at sunset you will say: Who would make it daybreak!<br>	—out of the terror of your heart that you feel-in-terror,<br>	out of the sight of your eyes that you see.68 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> will return you to Egypt in ships,<br>	by the route of which I had said to you:<br>	You shall not see it again any more!<br>	You will put yourselves up for sale there to your enemies as servants and as maids,<br>	with none to buy [you].69 @ 	These are the words of the covenant<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> commanded Moshe to cut with the Children of Israel<br>	in the land of Moav,<br>	aside from the covenant that he cut with them at Horev.29:1 @ 	Moshe called all Israel [together] and said to them:<br>	You yourselves have seen<br>	all that <sc>Yhwh</sc> did before your eyes in the land of Egypt,<br>	to Pharaoh, to all his servants and to all his land:2 	the great trials that your eyes saw,<br>	those great signs and portents.3 	But <sc>Yhwh</sc> has not given you a mind to know or eyes to see or ears to hear,<br>	until this day.4 	I had you travel for forty years in the wilderness;<br>	there did not wear out your garments from upon you,<br>	your sandal did not wear out from upon your foot,5 	bread you did not eat,<br>	wine and beer you did not drink,<br>	in order that you might know<br>	that I am <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God.6 	[When] you came to this place,<br>	Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out to meet you in battle,<br>	but we struck them down,7 	we took away their land and gave it as an inheritance<br>	to the Re’uvenites and to the Gadites, and to half the Menashite tribe.8 	So you are to take care regarding the words of this covenant,<br>	and are to observe them,<br>	in order that you may act-wisely in all that you do.9 @ 	You are stationed today, all of you,<br>	before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God:<br>	your heads, your tribes, your elders and your officials,<br>	all the men of Israel,10 	your little-ones, your wives, your sojourner who is amid your encampments,<br>	from your woodchopper to your waterhauler,11 	for you to cross over into the covenant of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God, and into his oath-of-fealty<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God is cutting with you today—12 	in order that he may establish you today for him as a people,<br>	with him being for you as a god,<br>	as he promised you<br>	and as he swore to your fathers, to Avraham, to Yitzhak, and to Yaakov.13 	Not with you, you-alone<br>	do I cut this covenant and this oath,14 	but with the one who is here, standing with us today<br>	before the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc> our God,<br>	and with the one who is not here with us today.15 	Indeed, you yourselves know<br>	how we were settled in the land of Egypt,<br>	and how we crossed amid the nations that you crossed;16 	you saw their Detestable Things and their Illicit Things,<br>	of wood and stone, of silver and of gold, that were with them—17 	[beware] lest there be among you a man or a woman, a clan or a tribe<br>	whose heart faces away today from <sc>Yhwh</sc> our God<br>	by going to serve the gods of those nations,<br>	lest there be among you a root bearing-fruit of wormwood and poison-herb;18 	for it shall be<br>	when he hears the words of this oath<br>	and blesses himself in his heart, saying:<br>	I will have <i>shalom,</i><br>	though in the stubbornness of my heart I will walk—<br>	with the result of “sweeping away the watered and the parched [alike],”19 	[that] <sc>Yhwh</sc> will not consent to grant-him-pardon;<br>	rather, then the anger of <sc>Yhwh</sc> will smoke, along with his zealous-rage, against that man,<br>	and there will crouch upon him all the oath-curse<br>	that is written in this Record,<br>	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> will blot-out his name from under the heavens!20 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> will set him apart for ill from all the tribes of Israel,<br>	according to all the oath-curses of the covenant<br>	that are written in this Record of Instruction.21 	Then shall say a later generation,<br>	your children who arise after you<br>	and the foreigner that comes from a land far off,<br>	when they see the blows [dealt] this land<br>	and its sicknesses with which <sc>Yhwh</sc> has made-it-sick:22 	by brimstone and salt is all its land burnt;<br>	it cannot be sown, it cannot sprout [anything],<br>	there cannot spring up in it any herbage—<br>	like the overturning of Sedom and Amora, Adma and Tzvoyim<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> overturned in his anger, in his venemous-wrath.23 	Then all the nations shall say:<br>	For what did <sc>Yhwh</sc> do thus to this land,<br>	[for] what was this great flaming anger?24 	And they shall say [in reply]:<br>	Because they abandoned the covenant of <sc>Yhwh</sc> the God of their fathers<br>	that he cut with them when he took them out of the land of Egypt:25 	they went and served other gods and bowed down to them,<br>	gods they had not known and that he had not apportioned to them.26 	So the anger of <sc>Yhwh</sc> flared up against that land,<br>	to bring upon it all the curse that is written in this Record.27 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> uprooted them from their land<br>	in anger, wrath, and great fury,<br>	and he cast them into another land, as [is] this day.28 	The hidden things are for <sc>Yhwh</sc> our God,<br>	but the revealed things are for us and for our children, for the ages,<br>	to observe all the words of this Instruction.30:1 @ 	Now it shall be:<br>	when there come upon you all these things,<br>	the blessing and the curse that I have set before you,<br>	and you take them to your heart<br>	among all the nations where <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God has led you away,2 	and you return to <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God and hearken to his voice,<br>	exactly as I command you today,<br>	you and your children,<br>	with all your heart and with all your being,3 	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God will restore your fortunes, and have compassion on you:<br>	he will return to collect you from all the peoples<br>	wherein <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God has scattered you.4 	If you be led away to the ends of the heavens,<br>	from there <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God will collect you, from there he will take you,5 	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God will bring you<br>	to the land that your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it,<br>	he will do-well by you and make you many-more than your fathers.6 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your seed,<br>	to love <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God with all your heart and with all your being,<br>	in order that you may live.7 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> your God will place all those threats upon your enemies and on those hatingyou, those pursuing you;8 	while you will return and hearken to the voice of <sc>Yhwh</sc><br>	and observe all his commandments that I command you today:9 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> your God will make you excel in all the doings of your hands,<br>	in the fruit of your womb and in the fruit of your animals, and in the fruit of your land, to good-measure,<br>	indeed, <sc>Yhwh</sc> will return to delighting in you, to [your] good,<br>	as he delighted in your fathers—10 	if you hearken to the voice of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	by keeping his commandments and his laws—what is written in this Record of Instruction—<br>	if you return to <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God with all your heart and with all your being.11 	For the commandment that I command you today:<br>	it is not too extraordinary for you,<br>	it is not too far away!12 	It is not in the heavens,<br>	[for you] to say:<br>	Who will go up for us to the heavens and get it for us<br>	and have us hear it, that we may observe it?13 	And it is not across the sea,<br>	[for you] to say:<br>	Who will cross for us, across the sea, and get it for us<br>	and have us hear it, that we may observe it?14 	Rather, near to you is the word, exceedingly,<br>	in your mouth and in your heart, to observe it!15 	See, I set before you today<br>	life and good, and death and evil:16 	in that I command you today<br>	to love <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	to walk in his ways<br>	and to keep his commandments, his laws and his regulations,<br>	that you may stay-alive and become-many<br>	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God may bless you<br>	in the land that you are entering to possess.17 	Now if your heart should face about, and you do not hearken,<br>	and you be led and bow down to other gods, and serve them,18 	I declare to you today<br>	that you will perish, yes, prish;<br>	you will not prolong days on the land that you are crossing the Jordan to enter, to possess.19 	I call-as-witness against you today the heavens and the earth:<br>	life and death I place before you, blessing and curse;<br>	so choose life, in order that you may stay alive, you and your seed,20 	by loving <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	by hearkening to his voice and by cleaving to him,<br>	for he is your life and the length of your days,<br>	to be settled on the land<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> swore to your fathers, to Avraham, to Yitzhak and to Yaakov,<br>	to give them!31:1 @ 	Now Moshe went<br>	and spoke these words to all Israel;2 	he said to them:<br>	A hundred and twenty years old am I today;<br>	I am no longer able to go out and to come in,<br>	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> has said to me:<br>	you are not to cross over this Jordan!3 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> your God, <i>he</i> will cross over before you;<br>	he will wipe out those nations from before you, so that you may dispossess them.<br>	Yehoshua, he will cross over before you,<br>	as <sc>Yhwh</sc> has promised.4 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> will do to them<br>	as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land,<br>	that he wiped them out.5 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> will give them before you<br>	and you will do to them<br>	exactly as the command that I have commanded you.6 	Be strong and be courageous;<br>	do not be afraid, do not be terrified before them,<br>	for <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God, he is the one who goes with you;<br>	he will not desert you, he will not abandon you!7 	Then Moshe called Yehoshua<br>	and said to him, before the eyes of all Israel:<br>	Be strong and courageous,<br>	for you yourself will enter with this people<br>	the land about which <sc>Yhwh</sc> swore to your fathers, to give them;<br>	you yourself will allot-it-as-inheritance to them.8 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc>, he is the one who goes before you&mdash;<br>	he will be with you;<br>	he will not desert you, he will not abandon you;<br>	you are not to be afraid, you are not to be shattered!9 	Moshe wrote down this Instruction<br>	and gave it to the priests, the Sons of Levi,<br>	those carrying the Coffer of the Covenant of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	and to all the elders of Israel.10 	And Moshe commanded them, saying:<br>	At the end of seven years,<br>	at the appointed-time of the Year of Release, on the pilgrimage-festival of Sukkot,11 	when all Israel comes<br>	to be seen at the presence of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	at the place that he chooses,<br>	you are to proclaim this Instruction<br>	in front of all Israel, in their hearing.12 	Assemble the people,<br>	the men, the women, and the little-ones,<br>	and your sojourner who is within your gates,<br>	in order that they may hearken, in order that they may learn<br>	and have-awe-for <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	and take care to observe all the words of this Instruction;13 	and [that] their children, who do not know,<br>	may hearken and learn<br>	to have awe for <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God,<br>	all the days that you remain alive on the land<br>	that you are crossing over the Jordan to possess.14 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Here, your days are drawing-near to die.<br>	Call Yehoshua and station yourselves at the Tent of Appointment,<br>	that I may command him.<br>	So Moshe went, along with Yehoshua,<br>	they stationed themselves at the Tent of Appointment.15 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> was seen at the Tent of Appointment, in a column of cloud,<br>	and the column of cloud stood over the entrance to the Tent of Appointment.16 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> said to Moshe:<br>	Here, you are about to lie beside your fathers;<br>	now this people will proceed<br>	to go whoring after the gods of the foreigner of the land<br>	that they are entering in his midst;<br>	they will abandon me<br>	and violate my covenant that I have cut with them.17 	And my anger will flare up against them on that day.<br>	I will abandon them and I will conceal my face from them;<br>	[they] will be [ripe] for devouring,<br>	and there will befall them many and troubling evils.<br>	And they will say on that day:<br>	Was it not because God was not in my midst<br>	[that] there have befallen me these evils?18 	But I, I will conceal, yes, conceal my face on that day,<br>	because of all the evil that they have done,<br>	for they faced about to other gods!19 	But now, write yourselves down this song;<br>	teach it to the Children of Israel, put it in their mouths,<br>	in order that this song may be for you as a witness against the Children of Israel.20 	When I bring them to the land about which I swore to their fathers,<br>	flowing with milk and honey,<br>	and they eat, and are satisfied, and grow fat,<br>	and they face about to other gods, and serve them,<br>	and spurn me and violate my covenant:21 	it will be,<br>	when there befall them many and troubling evils,<br>	that this song will speak up before their presence as a witness,<br>	for it will not be forgotten from the mouths of their seed.<br>	Indeed, I know the plans that they are making today,<br>	[even] before I bring them into the land about which I swore!22 @ 	So Moshe wrote down this song on that day,<br>	and he taught it to the Children of Israel.23 	Now he commanded Yehoshua son of Nun<br>	and said:<br>	Be strong and courageous,<br>	for you will bring the Children of Israel<br>	to the land about which I swore to them;<br>	and I myself will be with you.24 	And it was, when Moshe had finished writing down the words of this Instruction in a record, until they were ended,25 	that Moshe commanded the Levites,<br>	those carrying the Coffer of the Covenant of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	saying:26 	Take this Record of the Instruction<br>	and place it beside the Coffer of the Covenant of <sc>Yhwh</sc> your God;<br>	let it be there among you as a witness.27 	For I myself know your rebelliousness,<br>	and your hard neck;<br>	here, while I am yet alive with you today,<br>	you have been rebellious against <sc>Yhwh</sc>—<br>	more so after my death!28 	Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officials,<br>	that I may speak these words in their hearing,<br>	that I may call-to-witness against them the heavens and the earth.29 	For I know:<br>	after my death, indeed, you will wreak ruin, yes, ruin;<br>	you will turn aside from the way that I have commanded you,<br>	and call down upon yourselves evil in future days,<br>	for you will do what is evil in the eyes of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	provoking him through the doings of your hands!30 	So Moshe spoke in the ears of the entire assembly of Israel<br>	the words of this song, until they were ended:32:1 @ 		Give ear, O heavens, that I may speak,<br>		hear, O earth, the utterance of my mouth.2 		Let my teaching drip like rain,<br>		let my words flow like dew,<br>		like droplets on new-growth,<br>		like showers on grass.3 		For the name of <sc>Yhwh</sc> I proclaim,<br>		give greatness to our God!4 		The Rock, whole-and-perfect are his deeds,<br>		for all his ways are just.<br>		A God steadfast, [with] no corruption,<br>		equitable and upright is he.5 		His children have wrought-ruin toward him—a defect in them,<br>		a generation crooked and twisted!6 		[Is it] <sc>Yhwh</sc> whom you [thus] pay back,<br>		O people foolish and not wise?<br>		Is he not your father, your creator,<br>		he [who] made you and established you?7 		Regard the days of ages-past,<br>		understand the years of generation and generation [ago];<br>		ask your father, he will tell you,<br>		your elders, they will declare it to you:8 		when the Most-High gave nations [their] inheritances,<br>		at his dividing the human-race,<br>		he stationed boundaries for peoples<br>		by the number of the gods.9 		Indeed, the portion of <sc>Yhwh</sc> became his people,<br>		Yaakov, the lot of his inheritance.10 		He found him in a wilderness land,<br>		in chaos, a howling desert.<br>		He surrounded him, he paid-him-attention,<br>		he guarded him like the pupil of his eye;11 		like an eagle protecting its nest,<br>		over its young-birds hovering,<br>		he spread out his wings, he took him,<br>		and bore him on his pinions.12 		<sc>Yhwh</sc> alone did lead them,<br>		not with him any foreign god!13 		He had them mount on the high-places of the land,<br>		he fed them the crops of the field;<br>		he suckled them with honey from a boulder,<br>		with oil from a flinty rock;14 		on curds of cattle and milk of sheep,<br>		along with the milk of lambs and rams,<br>		of the young of Bashan and he-goats,<br>		along with the kidney fat of wheat,<br>		and blood of the grapes, you drank fermented [wine].15 		But Yeshurun grew fat and kicked,<br>		you were fat, you were gross, you were gorged,<br>		he forsook the God that made him,<br>		and treated-like-a-fool the Rock of his deliverance.16 		They enraged him with alien [gods],<br>		with abominations they provoked him.17 		They sacrificed to demons, no-gods,<br>		gods they had not known;<br>		new-ones from nearby came,<br>		of whom your fathers had no idea.18 		The Rock that birthed you, you neglected,<br>		you forgot the God that produced-you-in-labor.19 		<sc>Yhwh</sc> saw, and he spurned [you],<br>		out of the provocation of his sons and daughters.20 		He said: I will conceal my face from them,<br>		I will see what is their future.<br>		Indeed, a generation of overturning are they,<br>		children in whom one cannot trust.21 		They aroused my zealous-rage with a no-god,<br>		provoked me with their nothingnesses;<br>		so I will arouse their rage with a no-people,<br>		with a nation of fools I will provoke them!22 		For fire is kindled in my nostrils,<br>		it burns [down] to Sheol, below,<br>		it devours the earth and its yield,<br>		and sets-ablaze the hills’ foundations.23 		I will sweep them away with evils,<br>		my arrows I will spend against them.24 		Drained by famine,<br>		deprived-of-food by fiery-plague and bitter pestilence;<br>		the teeth of beasts I will send out against them,<br>		along with the hot-venom of crawlers in the dust.25 		Outside, the sword bereaves,<br>		in rooms-within, Terror!<br>		[Destroying] young-man and virgin alike,<br>		the nurseling along with the gray-haired man.26 		I would have said: I will cleave-them-in-pieces,<br>		I will make their memory cease from mortals,27 		—except that I feared the provocation from the enemy,<br>		lest their foes misconstrue,<br>		lest they say: Our hand is raised high&mdash;<br>		not <sc>Yhwh</sc> wrought all this!28 		For a nation straying from counsel are they,<br>		in them there is no understanding.29 		If [only] they were wise, they would contemplate this,<br>		they would understand their future!30 		How can one pursue a thousand,<br>		two put a myriad to flight,<br>		unless their Rock had sold them out,<br>		<sc>Yhwh</sc> had handed them over?31 		For not like their rock is our Rock,<br>		though our enemies [so] assess it;<br>		indeed, from the vine of Sedom is their vine,32 		from the fields of Amora,<br>		their grapes are grapes of poison,<br>		clusters bitter for them,33 		the hot-venom of serpents their wine,<br>		the cruel poison of vipers.34 		Is this not laid up in store with me,<br>		sealed up in my treasuries:35 		mine are vengeance and payback,<br>		at the time when their foot slips,<br>		for near is the day of their calamity,<br>		making haste, the things impending for them.36 		But <sc>Yhwh</sc> will judge [in favor of] his people,<br>		regarding his servants he will repent,<br>		when he sees that strength-of-hand is gone,<br>		naught [left] of [even] fettered and forsaken.37 		He will say: Where are its gods,<br>		the rock in whom it sought-refuge,38 		that devoured the fat of their sacrifices,<br>		drank the wine of their poured-offerings?<br>		Let them rise up and help you,<br>		let them be over you a shelter!39 		See now that I, I am he,<br>		there is no god beside me;<br>		I myself bring-death, bestow-life,<br>		I wound and I myself heal,<br>		and there is from my hand no rescuing!40 		For I lift up my hand to the heavens,<br>		and say: As I live, for the ages—41 		when I sharpen my lightning sword,<br>		my hand seizes judgment,<br>		I will return vengeance on my foes,<br>		and those who hate me, I will pay back.42 		I will make my arrows drunk with blood,<br>		my sword devour flesh,<br>		with the blood of the slain and the captives,<br>		from the head thick-with-locks of the enemy.43 		Give a ringing-cry, O nations, [over] his people,<br>		for the blood of his servants he will avenge.<br>		Vengeance he will return upon his foes,<br>		effecting-atonement for the land of his people!44 @ 	Moshe came<br>	and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people,<br>	he and Hoshe’a son of Nun.45 	[When] Moshe had finished speaking all these words to all Israel,46 	he said to them:<br>	Set your hearts toward all these words which I call-as-witness among you today,<br>	that you may command your children<br>	to take care to observe all the words of this Instruction.47 	Indeed, no empty word is it for you,<br>	indeed, it is your [very] life;<br>	through this word you shall prolong [your] days upon the land<br>	that you are crossing over the Jordan to possess.48 @ 	<sc>Yhwh</sc> spoke to Moshe on that same day, saying:49 	Go up these heights of Avarim/The-Region-Across, Mount Nevo<br>	that is in the land of Moav,<br>	that faces Jericho,<br>	and see the land of Canaan<br>	that I am giving to the Children of Israel for a holding.50 	You are to die on the mountain that you are going up,<br>	and are to be gathered to your kinspeople,<br>	as Aharon your brother died on Hill’s Hill<br>	and was gathered to his kinspeople51 	—because you [both] broke-faith with me<br>	in the midst of the Children of Israel<br>	at the waters of Merivat Kadesh, in the Wilderness of Tzyn,<br>	because you did not treat-me-as-holy<br>	in the midst of the Children of Israel.52 	Indeed, at a distance you shall see the land,<br>	but there you shall not enter,<br>	the land that I am giving to the Children of Israel.33:1 @ 	Now this is the blessing<br>	with which Moshe the man of God blessed the Children of Israel<br>	before his death.2 	He said:<br> @ 		<sc>Yhwh</sc> from Sinai came,<br>		he shone forth from Se’ir for them,<br>		radiating from Mount Paran,<br>		approaching from Rivevot Kodesh,<br>		at his right-hand, a fiery stream for them.3 		Though he has affection for the peoples,<br>		all his holy-ones are in your hand,<br>		they place themselves at your feet,<br>		bearing your words.4 		Instruction did Moshe command us,<br>		a possession the assembly of Yaakov.5 		Now he became king in Yeshurun<br>		when the heads of the people gathered,<br>		together, the tribes of Israel!6 @ 		May Re’uven live and not die,<br>		but let his menfolk be few-in-number.7 @ 	And this to Yehuda, he said:<br> @ 		Hearken, O <sc>Yhwh</sc>, to the voice of Yehuda,<br>		to his kinspeople bring him,<br>		his hands’-strength great for him.<br>		A help against his foes may you be!8 @ 	And to Levi he said:<br> @ 		Your <i>Tummim</i> and your <i>Urim</i> for your loyal man,<br>		whom you tested at Massa/Testing,<br>		you quarreled with him by the waters of Meriva/Quarreling.9 		Who says of his father and of his mother: I have not seen them,<br>		his brother he does not recognize,<br>		and his children he does not acknowledge—<br>		for they have guarded your sayings,<br>		your covenant they have watched over.10 		Let them instruct your regulations to Yaakov,<br>		your Instruction to Israel,<br>		putting smoking-incense in your nostrils,<br>		and complete-offerings on your altar.11 		Bless, O <sc>Yhwh</sc>, his wherewithal,<br>		and the works of his hands, accept-with-favor;<br>		smash the loins of those rising up against him,<br>		those hating him, from rising up!12 @ 	To Binyamin he said<br> @ 		The beloved of <sc>Yhwh</sc>! He dwells securely upon him,<br>		he surrounds him every day,<br>		as between his shoulders he dwells.13 @ 	And to Yosef he said<br> @ 		Blessed by <sc>Yhwh</sc> be his land,<br>		<br>		from the excellence of the heavens, from dew,<br>		from Ocean crouching below,14 		from excellence of the sun’s produce,<br>		from excellence of the moon’s crop.15 		And from the tops of the ancient mountains,<br>		from the excellence of the age-old hills,16 		from the excellence of the land and its fullness,<br>		the favor of the <i>Seneh</i>-bush Dweller;<br>		may it come on the head of Yosef,<br>		on the brow of the consecrated one among his brothers.17 		His firstling bull—it has splendor,<br>		the horns of the wild-ox, his horns;<br>		with them he shall gore the peoples together, the ends of the earth.<br>		They are the myriads of Efrayim,<br>		they are the thousands of Menashe.18 @ 	And to Zevulun he said<br> @ 		Rejoice, O Zevulun, in your going-out,<br>		and Yissakhar, in your tents.19 		Peoples they will call to the hills,<br>		there they will sacrifice sacrifices of victory,<br>		for the abundance of the seas they will suck,<br>		the hidden treasures of the sand.20 @ 	And to Gad he said<br> @ 		Blessed be he that expands Gad,<br>		like a king-of-beasts he dwells,<br>		tearing arm, yes, [and] brow.21 		He selected a premier-part for himself,<br>		for there a portion for a ruler was reserved;<br>		he approached [with] the heads of the people,<br>		the justice of <sc>Yhwh</sc> did he do,<br>		his regulations along with Israel.22 @ 	And to Dan he said:<br> @ 		Dan is a whelp of lions<br>		leaping forth from Bashan.23 @ 	And to Naftali he said:<br> @ 		Naftali is sated with favor,<br>		full with the blessing of <sc>Yhwh</sc>;<br>		[of] sea and southland taking-possession!24 @ 	And to Asher he said:<br> @ 		Most blessed of sons, Asher!<br>		May he be the favored-one of his brothers,<br>		dipping his foot in oil.25 		Iron and bronze your bolts,<br>		and as your days, your strength.26 		There is none like God, O Yeshurun,<br>		riding through the heavens to your help,<br>		in his majesty in the skies.27 		A shelter is the Ancient God,<br>		beneath, the arms of the Ageless-One.<br>		He drove out from before you the enemy,<br>		saying, “Wipe [him] out!”28 		So Israel will dwell in security,<br>		alone, the fountain of Yaakov,<br>		in a land of grain and new-wine;<br>		yes, his heavens drop down dew.29 		O your happiness, Israel;<br>		who is like you,<br>		a people delivered by <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>		your helping shield,<br>		who is your majestic sword!<br>		Your enemies shall come-cringing to you,<br>		and you—on their backs you will tread!34:1 @ 	Moshe went up from the Plains of Moav<br>	to Mount Nevo, at the top of the Pisga [Range]<br>	that faces Jericho;<br>	and <sc>Yhwh</sc> let him see all the land:<br>	Gil’ad as far as Dan,2 	and all Naftali, and the land of Efrayim and Menashe,<br>	and all the land of Yehuda,<br>	as far as the Hindmost Sea,3 	and the Negev<br>	and the round-plain, the cleft of Jericho, the town of palms, as far as Tzo’ar.4 	And <sc>Yhwh</sc> said to him:<br>	This is the land<br>	that I swore to Avraham, to Yitzhak, and to Yaakov, saying:<br>	To your seed I give it!<br>	I have let you see it with your eyes,<br>	but there you shall not cross!5 @ 	So there died there Moshe, the servant of <sc>Yhwh</sc>,<br>	in the land of Moav,<br>	at the order of <sc>Yhwh</sc>.6 	He buried him<br>	in a valley in the land of Moav,<br>	opposite Bet Pe’or,<br>	and no man has knowledge of his burial-place until this day.7 	Now Moshe was a hundred and twenty years old at his death;<br>	his eye had not grown-dim,<br>	his vigor had not fled.8 	And the Children of Israel wept for Moshe in the Plains of Moav for thirty days;<br>	then the days of weeping in mourning for Moshe were ended.9 @ 	Now Yehoshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom,<br>	for Moshe had leaned his hands upon him,<br>	and the Children of Israel hearkened to him<br>	and did as <sc>Yhwh</sc> had commanded Moshe.10 	But there arose no further prophet in Israel like Moshe,<br>	whom <sc>Yhwh</sc> knew face to face,11 	in all the signs and portents<br>	that <sc>Yhwh</sc> sent him to do in the land of Egypt,<br>	to Pharaoh and to all his servants, and to all his land;12 	and in all the strong hand<br>	and in all the great, awe-inspiring [acts]<br>	that Moshe did before the eyes of all Israel.
