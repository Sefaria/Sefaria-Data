<h0><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b>To Aid the Reader of Leviticus–Numbers–Deuteronomy<style><align=0><font12><content><p.small>In the Preface, I pointed out that much has changed in biblical scholarship </p.small>since the inception of Buber and Rosenzweig’s work. Nowhere is this as true as in reference to the last three books of the Torah. In the case of Leviticus, although the Israelite cult was of intense interest to nineteenth-century Protestant scholars such as Wellhausen, and Jewish scholars such as David Hoffmann, there has been a flowering of new work on this book in the last few decades. The opening up of ancient Near Eastern material on sacrifice and ritual, made possible by the scholarship of philologists, archaeologists, and comparativists in this century, and recent insights of anthropology, now bring to Leviticus a new level of comprehension and appreciation.	Most outstanding in this regard is the work of Milgrom and Levine, who have also greatly advanced the understanding of the book of Numbers. The contributions of these scholars properly constitute in each case a lifework, and one cannot study Leviticus or Numbers without a close reading of what they have done. If as translator I have accepted only a percentage of what they have suggested, that is due to the constraints imposed by my method, and also to the unenviable task of deciding between them in areas where they disagree. Any reader serious about studying the Torah must consult their work. In line with these developments, I should note that I have relied less on B-R in translating the last three books than I did with the first two.	A similar situation obtains in the case of Deuteronomy, with the many years of research done by Weinfeld. But the work of the three scholars mentioned here should not exclude the many fine commentaries that have appeared since the turn of the century, whether in such series as the International Critical Commentary or in individual volumes or studies of Israelite cult and law, by Jews and Christians alike. Then, too, the reader may turn to the <i>Anchor Bible Dictionary,<style> or the shorter <i>Harper’s Bible Dictionary,<style> for instance, for an in-depth look at many issues. Finally, I would like to single out the helpful introductions by Hallo in the Plaut commentary; these are now reprinted with additional material in Hallo 1991.	I have therefore approached the last three books of the Torah with some trepidation and caution, knowing that to present them for the general reader in translation, and through brief notes and commentary, is an undertaking full of potential pitfalls. But these books, no less than the more famous and accessible first two, constitute the “instruction” or “teaching” found in the Five Books of Moses, and are well worth the effort required to experience them. The reader is directed to the works mentioned in “Suggestions for Further Reading” for the opportunity to digest the great wealth of material now available.	For the sake of simplification, in the Commentary and Notes to these books, citations from the major commentaries of Levine, Milgrom, Weinfeld, and now Tigay (appearing variously in <i>The Anchor Bible<style> and <i>The New JPS Commentary<style>) are not followed by their publication dates; these appear in the “Suggestions” section just mentioned. The same holds for the Leviticus commentaries of Bamberger (in Plaut) and Wenham.<p=art><align=1><content><font64><lang=heb>wyqra<h0><align=1><title><font24><lang=en><b>Leviticus<br><br><br>Now He Called<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b>On Translating Leviticus<style><align=0><font12><content><p.small>The book of Leviticus, along with other parts of the Torah that deal with </p.small>cultic and legal matters, presents particular problems for a translator who chooses to work in the Buber-Rosenzweig mode. There are a number of technical terms which, in addition to their constant repetition in the text, inviting overemphasis on strangeness, are difficult to render accurately into English. For their part, Buber and Rosenzweig translated what they understood as the meaning of these terms, even if it meant creating new words in German that made little sense to someone not familiar with the Hebrew concepts. Some examples are found below.	My initial inclination was to leave the names of sacrifices, etc., in Hebrew transcription, but I have come to feel that this places an undue burden on the English reader. With some reservations I have therefore opted for a mix of transcription and translation.	Buber saw the names of several sacrifices as suggesting movement between the human and the divine. Thus the names of the two most common sacrifices, <i>korban<style> and <i>ola,<style> were rendered “Nearbringing” and “Highbringing” in B-R. I have utilized “near-offering” and “offering-up”; in the case of the former, the intent of the text may simply have been to indicate what the worshiper “brings-near” to the altar, although the effect was certainly understood to bring humans closer to God. A third type of sacrifice, the <i>minha,<style> which B-R rendered as “leading-gift,” always indicates a “grain-gift” in cultic texts. My German predecessors would undoubtedly not have approved of my less radical approach to these terms; I have, however, followed them in retaining “bringing-near” as a verb, denoting variously “to bring,” “to sacrifice,” and “to officiate” (in the sanctuary), which I have indicated in the Notes.	As for <i>hattat<style> and <i>asham,<style> these two key sacrifices have a number of meanings in the text. I have chosen to retain them in transcription, providing occasional translations on location or explanations in the notes.	A most important term in the priestly material is the adjective <i>tamei<style> (along with its noun, <i>tum’a<style>). The word refers to a ritual state, the existence of which was understood in ancient Israel as a grave danger to the “purity” of the sanctuary. It is not, however, “uncleanness” in the physical sense, but a state akin perhaps to radioactivity: in this case, it drives away the divine presence from Israel (cf. Greenstein 1984a for another analogy). B-R used “stained/tainted” in their translation; most recent scholars use “polluted” and “pollution” to describe the phenomenon. I have accepted the latter in my discussions below but have chosen to stay with Hebrew transcription in the text itself, allowing for a wider and less overtly negative form of the term. Were I in a flippant mood brought on by political correctness, I might suggest “ritually challenged” for <i>tamei.<style>	One more problem in translating Leviticus is worthy of mention. A Buber-Rosenzweig type of rendition is fairly adaptable for narrative and even poetry; but in legal and cultic passages, such as we find in abundance in Leviticus, it imposes huge constraints on the translator. Recent English translations such as JPS and the New Revised Standard Version have conveyed the basic meaning of these passages in reasonably clear language. I, on the other hand, have not found it possible to avoid awkward English in this material. I hope nevertheless that, despite the difficulties involved for the reader, the rhetoric and structure—and sometimes the obscurity—of the Hebrew, which left the text open to later disagreement and interpretation, will still be visible and instructive.	A final note on translation practices. Buber and Rosenzweig did not always hold to the principle of one Hebrew root, one corresponding German root, if this was unimportant or simply an impossibility. I have similarly on occasion deviated from full consistency in translating certain words. So, for instance, I found that the many different uses of Heb. <i>shamor<style>—“guard,” “keep,” “take-care”—simply could not be standardized in translation. In the main, when I have found it possible to connect passages via their standardized language in the Hebrew, I have done so in English.<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b>On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure<style><align=0><font12><content><p.small>For most lay readers, the third of the Five Books of Moses presents</p.small> formidable obstacles. Many people find it difficult to relate to the description of ritual slaughter of animals and the disposal of their blood and flesh in the opening section of the book, or to the detailed prescriptions regarding bodily functions, skin disease, and mold in Chapters 12–15. Others experience Leviticus as obscure: Why exactly do Aaron’s sons die in Chapter 10? How can one explain the ritual of the scapegoat in Chapter 16? A frequently encountered reaction to the book is the desire to get on to the book of Numbers—which at least has some intriguing narratives such as Moses’ sin and punishment, the faint-heartedness of the spies, and Balaam’s reversed prophecies.	Yet Leviticus, as it has been placed in the Torah, signals that something of singular importance is at work. The book, after all, occurs at the center of the overall five-book structure. Unlike the other four, it is set entirely around Mount Sinai, and so it forms, geographically as well as structurally, the heart of the Torah document. In addition, the priestly interests so clearly presented in Leviticus appear throughout the Torah: as genealogical lists (Genesis, Exodus, Numbers), descriptions of rituals (Exodus, Numbers, Deuteronomy), and details about the building of the desert “Dwelling” of God (Exodus). Indeed, the opening chapter of it all, <scrip2>Gen. 1</scrip> (the Creation story), has strong links in both its themes and terminology with the priestly law.	Leviticus in fact presents a significant strain, conventionally termed the “priestly” view, in biblical thought. Anthropologically considered, it sheds important light on the outlook of some of those who compiled and read the Hebrew Bible. And the process did not stop there. Many of the categories found in Leviticus were continued and expanded by later Judaism: regulations concerning sexuality and diet, concepts of separation and holiness, and how to deal with one’s fellow human beings in a variety of economic and social settings. These found expression in different but still recognizable form simultaneously in the development of Christianity.	In late antiquity Leviticus was known as <i>Torat Kohanim,<style> the Priestly Instruction (or simultaneously understood, as Levine suggests, as the Instruction of the Priests). Given both the concerns of the priestly writers and the wording they use to express those concerns, I see Leviticus as the Book of Separations, the book in which are set forth distinctions between a whole range of aspects of ancient Israelite experience and practice: holy and profane; ritual purity and pollution; permitted and forbidden in sexuality and diet; Israelites and others; and priests, Levites, and common folk among the Israelites. This near-obsession with drawing lines (or, as Douglas has presented it, concentric circles) may in some sense reflect the position of Israel in the ancient Near East as a small, beleaguered newcomer in a region of hoary empires, situated on land that was constantly invaded by both great powers and local foes. It may also be an echo of the larger Bronze Age and Iron Age process of change from the former, well-nigh universal worship of the Mother Goddess, to the later patriarchal societies with which the Western world still deals through its three monotheistic religions and their cultural outgrowths.	Overarching the theme of separations or distinctions, through much of the book, is the polarity of order/disorder, represented best in Leviticus by the problem of life and death. As many scholars have noted, regulations regarding sacrifice here connect up with symbolically offering up human life—through the substitution of an animal—to the deity; blood is avoided at all costs, due to its connoting life. Animals that may be used for food (as well as for sacrifice) are in the main those which do not consume other living creatures. Pollutants which endanger the purity of the sanctuary (“Dwelling”) include bodily emissions which the Israelites connected with death (e.g., menstrual blood and “wasted” semen). Finally, the complex system of purification from some kind of skin disease may well originate in the similarity between disease and death. In sum, then, it is no surprise that, two books later, the Deuteronomic Moses implores the people to “choose life” rather than the “death” engendered by improper behavior by both priests and commoners.	Interestingly, the strong urge to make order (ritual laws) out of disorder (the chaotic processes of human life, from killing animals for food to sexual relations) is reflected in other aspects of the Torah—most notably in the narrative portrayal of the descent lines from father Abraham. Here, the discontinuity represented by sibling rivalries and other threats to survival is countered by God’s establishing a kind of continuity through the choosing of younger brothers. In this case, the strong hand of ritual control is replaced by the somewhat hazardous element of surprise and close calls. But it does manage to provide for family continuity and, ultimately, the survival of the people. Whether this points to early or later experiences historically is the subject of ongoing and unresolved debate among biblical scholars. A widely accepted possibility is that the Torah as we have it was edited by priestly editors living in or shortly after the Babylonian Exile (sixth–fifth centuries <p.small>b.c.e.</p.small>), and that those editors took earlier material (which itself was already multilayered) and adapted it into an overall scheme expressing promise, disobedience, destruction, and survival/hope (cf. Fox 1993).	In point of fact, Leviticus is best viewed as only a part, albeit the major one as a bloc, of a major thrust of the Torah. According to most biblical scholars, the “priestly” worldview, and the texts that may be attributed to it, makes its appearance with the very chapter with which the entire Torah begins, <scrip2>Gen. 1</scrip>. Here distinctions and ordering are at the very heart of the text. God, immediately after his first creation-by-word (light), “separates” between light and darkness, then goes on to perform the same operation between heavenly waters (the storehouses of rain) and earthly ones. His remaining acts of creation involve putting heavenly bodies, vegetation, and animal life in order—each “according to its kind,” on specific days of creation. Animals are distinguished from plants through their receiving vocal divine blessing; humans from animals through the addition to the blessing of the phrase “have dominion over” the rest of living things. At the same time, humans are told that they may eat only what grows from the ground, implying that to do otherwise would be a violation of the order of things. Crowning the whole account is the poem (<scrip2>Gen. 2:1–4</scrip>a) about God’s “finishing” of the “work” of creation, symbolized by his “hallowing” (making holy or separate-for-God) the seventh day. In <scrip2>Gen. 1</scrip>, then, we are presented with a brief but complete vision of the cosmos as ordered in space, time, and life-forms, under the aegis of a metasexual, nonviolent, and benevolent deity.	As Genesis unfolds under priestly influence, humans are presented with basic rules and warned of the consequences if those rules are broken. The paradisical situation of Adam and Eve (no labor, vegetarianism, no danger from animals, and sexual innocence) is disrupted by human disobedience, resulting in banishment from Eden—a shattering of the previous wholeness and order. Cain’s murder of his brother leads to the same punishment: uprootedness and hard labor. The mixing of divine and human beings in <scrip2>Gen. 6:1–2</scrip> results in a clear distinction being established by God, that humans will henceforth be limited in age. Finally, the account of the universal flood in Chapters 6–9 presents a picture that uses a number of Leviticus motifs. The earth is to be destroyed because human wrongdoing has “ruined” it (or, in Levitical language, “polluted” it). Animal life is rescued by means of taking pairs of animals aboard the ark—with Leviticus’s distinctions of “pure” and impure dutifully mentioned. Noah’s three sons, who also come onto the ark, later become the forefathers of three great divisions of humanity, as laid out in detail in the genealogical lists of Chapters 10–11. Finally, the new beginning of the cosmos, with Noah as a second Adam (cf. the latter’s blessing in <scrip>(Leviticus)1:28</scrip> with that of the former in <scrip>(Leviticus)9:1–2</scrip>), is accompanied by both animal sacrifices and dietary restrictions (the introduction of meat is new, accompanied by the caveat—as in <scrip2>Lev. 17</scrip>—that blood is not to be consumed).	A major part of the priestly scheme emerges with the detailed instructions concerning the construction of the Tabernacle (God’s place of “Dwelling” on earth) and the priestly vestments that are to be worn there, in <scrip2>Ex. 25–31</scrip> (with much of this material repeated in narrative form in Chapters 35–40). The details make sense as part of a larger picture, in which the closer one gets to the “Holiest Holy-Shrine” where God takes up dwelling, the more central the measurements of space and the more precious the materials used. This concentric sense of order is reflected also in the layout of the wilderness camp of the Israelites in <scrip2>Num. 2</scrip>. Thus the Tabernacle functions as a minicosmos, a visible and ritual representation of the creation itself. Through the layout of curtains within and tribal encampments without, space is ordered; through the festivals (enumerated in Leviticus and Deuteronomy, with some mention in Exodus as well), time is ordered. And, thanks to the provisions laid out in Leviticus, through priest/lay hierarchy, dietary rules, and sacrificial regulations, life-forms are ordered. The result is an almost utopian scheme. It is a world in which everything and everyone are to take their place under the perfect worship of a perfect God, banishing or avoiding death, defect, and disorder. In the priestly view, the world is to be an echo of the divine order that is portrayed in the Creation story.	Viewed in the perspective of priestly concerns (only part of which we have just outlined), Leviticus is largely concerned with the potential disruption of this utopia. If Genesis chronicles threats to the fulfillment of God’s promises to Abraham, if Numbers recounts threats to his descendants’ survival on their march through the wilderness, then Leviticus concentrates on threats to Israel’s life with God. It presents a whole system of rules designed, first, to provide for purification and reconciliation with God through the sacrificial cult; second, to protect sanctuary, priests, land, and people from estrangement from God (via “pollution” of various kinds); and, finally, to establish a code of behavior that will ensure the perpetual enjoyment of God’s blessings on the land promised to Israel’s ancestors. From this it can readily be seen how Leviticus, far from being of interest to specialists and historians only, is in fact a crucial part of the Torah—perhaps its most crucial part, in that it supplies the ideological center of gravity for the whole. Once Leviticus is added to the narratives, poems, laws, and lists that comprise the rest of the Torah, a picture emerges that is more than literature and more than history. The five books become the multilayered and multifaceted monument that has been studied, puzzled over, and built upon for over two millennia.	In sum, the world of the priestly strain in the Torah is a realm of desired order and perfection, a realm in which wholeness is to reign, in which anomaly and undesired mixture are not permitted, and in which boundaries are zealously guarded. The human body becomes symbolic of the cosmos: its life/death boundary is marked, and troublesome flows from it are carefully regulated. The land of Israel becomes symbolic of the cosmos: too much evildoing pollutes it, to the point where it can do naught else but “vomit out” its settlers (as it vomited out the previous ones). The animal kingdom, from which humans are allowed to take life under carefully prescribed circumstances, becomes symbolic of cosmic values, through heightening awareness of predator and victim, and careful avoidance of blood, the symbol of life. Indeed, in the system of Leviticus, it is no wonder that death is the major pollutant, and that blood of acceptable animal sacrifice is the agent through which human beings find atonement for minor pollutants. The book as it is presently laid out falls into three major sections, with a number of chapters that function either as connectors or appendices to various sections. Linkages and connecting theme words will be spelled out in more detail in the commentary; for the moment, the following outline may suffice:<align=30>	I The Sacrificial Cult<align=60>	1–7 Sacrificial Offerings: Their Ritual and Disposal<align=60>	8–9 The Installation of the Priests<align=60>	10 Systems Failure<align=30>	II Ritual Pollution and Purification<align=60>	11 Forbidden and Permitted Foods: Transition<align=60>	12–15 Pollution from Bodily Fluids and Skin Disease<align=60>	16 Purifying the Sanctuary and the High Priest<align=60>	Appendix: 17 On the Shedding of Animal Blood<align=30>	III Holiness<align=60>	18 Pollution from Forbidden Unions: Transition<align=60>	19:3–4 Frame at Beginning<align=60>	19–20 Holiness in Public/Private Behavior<align=60>	21–22 Holiness in Priestly Behavior<align=60>	23 Holiness in the Calendar<align=60>	24 Miscellaneous<align=60>	25 Regulations Concerning Land and Slaves<align=60>	26:1–2 Frame at End<align=60>	26:3–46 Holiness Confirmed or Denied: The Blessing and theCurse<align=60>	Appendix: 27 Assessments for the Priests<align=0><font12><content>Other commentators have of course seen it differently. Most follow the traditional scholarly approach of starting the “Holiness Code” with Chapter 17; Levine rightly parallels it to the beginnings of other law collections in the Torah (<scrip2>Ex. 20:19–23</scrip> and <scrip2>Deut. 12</scrip>; the ending here in Chapter 26 also parallels the endings in the other two codes). Hallo understands the structure as 1–11: Rites of Consumption; 12–16: Rites of Purification; and 17–26: Holiness.	Overshadowing the clear three-part structure, however one wants to divide it up, is the complex issue of two apparent documents or schools of thought. Biblical scholarship terms these P (“Priestly”) and H (“Holiness”), and roughly attributes the first part of the book (through Chap. <scrip>(Leviticus)16</scrip>) to P, with the rest to H. There has been detailed, ongoing debate about the approaches and dating of these sources. As of this writing, it is generally accepted that H is later than P, but there seem to be numerous interpolations of one source into the other, and it is difficult to place them historically with certainty. Here, as elsewhere in biblical literature, we have a layering effect rather than a clear-cut delineation of “authors.” As usual, that appears to have been intentional. A word should be said about the relationship between law and narrative in the Torah. As Damrosch has noted, the legal and cultic texts in the five books might be seen by modern readers as intrusive. On the surface, they certainly seem to interrupt a good story. Genesis is largely unencumbered by nonaction (except for the genealogical lists—attributed to P!), but the gripping account of the redemption from Egypt in Exodus, and the drama of revelation on and apostasy beneath Mount Sinai, give way to the sober architectural details of the Tabernacle’s construction. Similarly, the narratives of the book of Numbers, which are among the most striking in the literature, are set off against a background of censuses, laws about suspected adultery and the taking of vows, Levitical duties in the Dwelling, and an enumeration of sacrificial gifts brought by the tribes, among other things.	The bulk of material in Leviticus, and its placement in the Torah, make it clear that the five books that we have convey their point precisely through the medium of narrative <i>plus<style> cult/law. In the Israelite worldview, these two rather distinct forms, which intermingle past, present, and future (Damrosch), fruitfully enrich and explain one another. It is as if a history of the American Revolution contained all of the debates on and drafts of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, as well as accounts of battles and biographies of key personalities. That such an approach parallels neither Homeric epic nor ritual texts in their purity of form is exactly the point: we have here a new genre of great complexity and richness, in which narratives exemplify laws and laws follow narratives. The result is truly a <i>torah</i>, a “teaching” or “instruction.”	Also important is the issue of priests and laypeople. Scholars have often seen Leviticus as originating as a manual for priests. What is most fascinating, and perhaps most important (for later history), about this book is the way in which it takes priestly rules and transmutes at least some of them for use in the general populace of ancient Israel. This can be seen most dramatically in the dietary laws, which in other cultures often serve exclusively for priests, and in the area of sexual taboos, which do likewise. In postbiblical Judaism this shift becomes particularly evident: the Jew’s dinner table is termed a “sanctuary in miniature” (complete with loaves of bread and the use of salt—two elements found in the ancient sacrificial cult); dietary laws are expanded for the general population to provide for separation of milk and meat; and separation of husband and wife during menstruation, among traditional Jews, leaves the context of Sanctuary pollution and finds a home in the context of a philosophy of marriage. Many other examples could be brought of the widening of priestly laws to an entire people. Perhaps most dramatic—and most significant—is the eventual shift of the learning and interpretation of sacred texts away from the priests, who in most cultures served as the guardians of the text (and often the culture’s only literate body; cf. medieval Christian Europe). In Judaism of late antiquity, this monopoly was decisively broken; first the scribe and then the rabbi (“master”) took over, with learning extended at last to all those who might make the effort to acquire it. The great exception, at least in antiquity, was women—who, it will be noted, were also excluded from priestly functions in the Bible. Three relatively recent developments make it possible to approach Leviticus as a significant, powerful, and interesting biblical text. The first is the explosion of both full-length and shorter studies of the book and its concerns that have appeared in recent years. The work of Milgrom (1991), Levine (1989), Wenham (1979), Eilberg-Schwartz (1990), and Bamberger (1981), to cite just a few of the English-language studies on aspects of Leviticus, now makes it possible to have a serious entry into the book based largely on advances in understanding the cultures of the ancient Near East. It also, admittedly, puts the translator and commentator in a bind: is it possible to add anything new, or will it suffice simply to summarize? My approach in this volume has been largely the latter, along with suggesting to the reader some fruitful directions for further study.	The second development helpful for approaching Leviticus, which also informs many of the studies just mentioned, is the using of anthropological insights to understand concepts and rituals found in the book. Such an approach places Leviticus in a broader human context, indicating what it does and does not share with other cultural and religious systems. For Leviticus is concerned with the same issues that plague all human societies: how to deal with the boundaries of life and death, how to comprehend and approach the transcendent in life, how to understand one’s (or one’s nation’s) place in the cosmic order, how to make for a just society. Viewed in this light, the book is a “Small Code” (cf. Northrop Frye’s designation of the Bible as “the Great Code”). That is, Leviticus need not remain a total mystery to us, to be unraveled only through detailed analysis and even change (Judaism) or substitution (Christianity), but can be understood on its own terms, if approached with care and in the spirit of seeking the larger picture in the details.	Finally, we should mention the aesthetic dimension. Like the other books of the Torah, Leviticus uses its own rhetoric to convey its message. Far from employing flat “priestly” style (whatever that may be), it uses formulas, refrains, and other rhythmical forms to impress its teaching (Heb. <i>tora<style>) upon its hearers. This aspect of the book has been the subject of recent study (cf. Paran), but was already echoed in the Buber-Rosenzweig translation. It is my hope that the present volume will contribute to an appreciation of the style of Leviticus.<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b_caps>PART I<br><br>The Cult and the Priesthood<br><br><style>(<scrip1>(Leviticus)1–10<content>)<align=0><font12><content><p.small>The second half of the book of Exodus concerned itself with setting up the</p.small> sacrificial cult of Israel. It therefore set forth the prescriptions for and construction of a sanctuary and the priestly garments, and laid out a ceremony for the investiture of priests. But the description of how sacrifices were to be offered, and for what purpose, is not part of the book, which as edited seems more interested in contrasting the building of a sanctuary with building cities for the Pharaohs, as part of its portrayal of the victory of the biblical God over the gods of Egypt. Although at the end of the book the “Dwelling” is completed, we do not get to see the various sacral rites performed there.	Leviticus also delays the ordination of the priests, until Chapter 8, preferring instead to begin with a kind of manual on the offering and disposal of sacrifices. It then moves us from the details of sacrifice into the narrative of the sanctuary’s dedication and opening rites, providing a natural bridge for Part II, in which ritual pollution and purity, the province of priests, is dealt with.	The function of the sacrificial cult in ancient Israel will be discussed in “On Animal Sacrifice” below. In general it should be noted that the existence of a class or profession whose job it is to mediate between the divine and human realms is widespread in most older cultures, and the Israelite priesthood, whatever its origins and development, was but one of many such groups in the ancient Near East. It existed, to use the language of Exodus, to “serve” God, maintaining his holiness through ritual and helping to maintain the order of sacred culture which was supposed to mirror God’s ordering of the cosmos. Accordingly, as we will learn later in Leviticus, priests were to be set apart from the general population in a number of areas. There were strict rules about whom they could and could not marry, and they were barred from coming into any contact with the dead, for instance. Their functions extended beyond sacrifice; they could provide oracular advice in times of need, and taught the people “instructions” (Heb. <i>torot<style>) regarding various ritual matters.	As part of an overall scheme, there was a conscious parallel between priests as part of a select circle and sacrificial animals—as well as the people of Israel. That is, all three stood at the center of concentric circles dedicated to God; and as one moved out (toward Levite and commoner, animals permitted for eating and those forbidden, and neighbors and foreigners), one got further and further away from the divine. The hierarchy regarding the cult thus reinforced the theme of separation which we have noted above.	In the view of Milgrom, Israel’s cult was distinguished from those of its neighbors by its purposefully ignoring the complex web of rituals regarding demons. The sanctuary was to be purged of ritual pollution, not only by semimagical means (the sprinkling of sacrificial blood) but also and primarily by the confession of wrongdoing and the sincere desire to repent. Then, too, the sanctuary, while in most respects resembling shrines elsewhere in the ancient Near East, omitted certain crucial items, most notably statuary representing the gods and a bed for them to rest on. Finally, certain religious rituals were forbidden, such as mutilation of the priests’ bodies. In all these cases, Israel introduced something new into the area of worship.	For many decades there has been major and heated debate by scholars in favor of one or the other scheme for following the history of the priesthood and the cult. There are those who view these institutions as stretching back to Israel’s earliest history, while others see strong evidence of a late, possibly even exilic, reworking of the priestly material. Similar arguments dot the landscape of literary criticism of the Torah, in which scholars have tried to divine at what point priestly editors might have put their distinctive stamp on the literature. From Wellhausen in the nineteenth century to Knohl, Milgrom, and Levine in the late twentieth, there has been no lack of theorizing on these issues—and no definitive answers. For the moment we are left to read Leviticus as it is placed in the Torah, with an awareness that a variety of historical and ideological influences are imbedded, if not hidden, in our text.<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b>On Animal Sacrifice<style><align=0><font12><content><p.small>Although it appears earlier in the Torah, animal sacrifice receives its</p.small> fullest treatment in Leviticus. Besides the opening seven chapters, which are devoted to a relatively brief description of how sacrifices are to be offered and disposed of, many other chapters in the book talk about sacrificial rituals: the installation of the priests (8–9), rules about disposing of the <i>hattat<style> sacrifice (10), purification offerings brought in the event of such “polluting” states as childbirth and skin diseases (12–15), and finally the “scapegoat” ceremony of Chapter 16. They appear in most of the later chapters as well.	What function did sacrifice, particularly of animals, play in the religion of ancient Israel? How could a God who proscribed the murder of human beings (<scrip2>Ex. 20:13</scrip>, <scrip2>21:12</scrip>) countenance the taking of animal life for ritual purposes? To answer these questions, we must turn briefly to some of the commonly proposed theories surrounding sacrifice.	The idea of offering up living creatures to the gods is one of hoary antiquity. Walter Burkert, on the basis of the study of Greek religion, suggests that sacrifice is a means of dealing with guilt over the taking of life. That is, the switch from gathering to hunting society, made possible by technology (the invention of tools), while it raised human accomplishment and consciousness to a new level, also brought with it the acute sense of having violated something essential in the cosmic order. Such guilt is not mitigated by the fact that early people hunted for food and not for pleasure. The way of dealing with the guilt, giving life back to the gods, is in a true sense restoration; life is given back for life taken, so that it may ultimately be renewed (contrast this to the profoundly unecological use of living and inorganic resources over the past “civilized” centuries). And it must be done via ritual. In Burkert’s view, ritual deals with human anxiety by “raising the ante”—by means of increasing anxiety, it is controlled. So guilt over life-taking is assuaged by making a ritual out of the killing, and the shared experience of trauma helps to create solidarity within the group. Despite the subsequent rise of agriculture, says Burkert, the hunting ritual played out in sacrifice could not be done away with, so ingrained had it become, and the rationale behind sacrifices was therefore transformed. Now domesticated animals could be used, giving greater control over the process.	In another approach, De Vaux (1965) postulates three motives for sacrifice. In the first model, that of “gift,” the worshiper brings something of value to the deity. The animal is killed, setting it apart for sacred use; it is burned, turning it into an invisible substance which can rise to the gods. The gift may be for thanksgiving or, more likely, may be to assuage the demonic powers that many societies (especially Mesopotamia, Abraham’s homeland) felt controlled everyday life. Giving establishes reciprocal movement; altruism has no place here (Burkert). One is reminded of the elaborate giving ceremonies among many peoples on occasions such as weddings; giving establishes relationship and maintains the social order.	In addition to gifts, another mode of sacrifice involves communion, as nineteenth-century scholars such as Robertson Smith observed. Here the model of the meal is crucial: humans and gods share a great repast, thereby cementing kinship as surely as the closing of business deals is celebrated by drinks and dinner. Passover, both in the Bible and subsequently (even when the sacrifice per se was no longer involved), may serve as a striking example of the effectiveness of such a paradigm.	A final type or function of sacrifice is atonement or expiation. Here a sin, communal or individual, is purged away by the act of sacrifice; the gods receive life as a substitute for the sinner’s own, which is symbolized by the victim’s blood. The fact that the animals permitted in the Bible for sacrifice are pastoral and hence frequently used metaphorically for the Israelites themselves, is significant in this regard. This approach is further illustrated in the Bible by the end of the Flood story, where God accepts Noah’s sacrifice, implying that he accepts animal life (which now, simultaneous with properly offered sacrifice, is permissible for food) in place of that of humans (Eilberg-Schwartz). It should be noted that, in the Bible, sacrifice for the sake of atonement is almost always in reference to unintentional sins, whereas deliberate wrongdoing may not be atoned for through this system.	Which of these rationales is truly at work in Levitical sacrifice? Actually, at various times one can find all of them—the texts present a variety of motives and occasions for sacrifice in biblical Israel, from thanksgiving to purification and reparation. But in general one may say of Israelite sacrifice, as one may say of much of the ritual in Leviticus, that it is designed primarily to maintain or repair the relationship between God and Israel. Such an understanding helps to explain the unity of the book, as we will see in our discussion of pollution: sacrifice was a crucial element in keeping the covenant, and hence God’s beneficent presence among the Israelites, intact.	The fact that this reconciliation, as it were, takes place against a background of slaughter should not be as upsetting to moderns as it is usually felt to be. In ironic contrast to our mechanized and mass-produced society, where the killing of animals for food takes place at a remove from our consciousness and from our direct participation, the sacrificial system in fact involved worshiper and priest alike, and the symbolic value of the operation, whatever it may have been in specific cases, lay in its directness, in its consciousness of the taking of life. Some would even maintain that in societies where the practice and rationale for sacrifice has broken down, there is inevitably an increase in intrahuman violence (Girard).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Varied Sacrificial Offerings I<content><style> (<scrip1>(Leviticus)1<content>): The first chapter begins with a description of the <i>ola,<style> the “offering-up,” which appears throughout the Bible as a standard sacrifice, frequently preceding others. It is characterized by being totally burned on the altar, and functions essentially to bring human beings to the attention of God and to win his acceptance. So the offering-up does not deal with sin, as later sacrifices do (Wenham).	This opening chapter of the book sets the standard pattern for the first seven chapters concerned with sacrifices. It lays out general rules about the preparation and presentation of the offerings; from <scrip>(Leviticus)7:38<content> on and throughout the rest of the Torah, specific applications and how they work will be explained (Anderson). Enumerated are the kind of animal to be sacrificed (in order of value, and hence indicating that rich and poor alike have access to the system); the personal participation of the worshiper; and the tasks of the priests. Many of the phrases recur throughout the opening chapters of the book, but the main refrain is the concluding “fire-offering of soothing savor for <p.small>Yhwh</p.small>.” Three kinds of animals appear here; they are, again, all domesticated.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Varied Sacrificial Offerings II<content><style> (<scrip1>(Leviticus)2<content>): The <i>minha,<style> understood earlier in the Bible as simply “tribute” or “gift” (cf. <scrip2>Gen. 4:3<content> and <scrip>(Leviticus)32:14<content>), comes in the priestly texts to indicate specifically an offering of grain. Using a three-part structure of grain cooked in an oven/griddle/pan, paralleling Chap. <scrip>(Leviticus)1<content>’s cattle/sheep/birds, the description of the <i>minha<style> focuses on the type of grain offered, what is added to it, the strictures against fermenting, and the “covenant of salt.” The chapter ends with the usual refrain, “a fire-offering for <p.small>Yhwh</p.small>.”<i>Varied Sacrificial Offerings III<style> (3): The purpose of the so-called <i>shalom<style> sacrifice has been debated. Levine, for one, sees it as a “sacred gift of greeting,” intended to address God in the fellowship of other laypeople and priests at a sacred meal. This communal, lay aspect of the sacrifice is significant. Some scholars have understood animal sacrifice to be essentially humanity’s way of bonding with the gods (as well as with dead ancestors), and would thus see in the present form, with its emphasis on the meat, an example of this idea.	Unlike the obligatory sacrifices, the shalom sacrifice accepts a variety of animals, and the rules regarding them are not as stringent. Some theorize that originally all meat-eating in ancient Israel was of this type.	Once again, we have the division into larger and smaller domestic animals. Notable is the descriptive refrain regarding the disposal of the animals’ innards.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Obligatory Sacrificial Offerings I<content><style> (<scrip1>(Leviticus)4<content>): The first of these, the <i>hattat<style>, is the subject of voluminous recent debate among scholars. Formerly translated as “sin-offering,” it is now (thanks to Milgrom) understood more accurately as a purification offering in a variety of settings. The <i>hattat<style> decontaminates the sanctuary, and apparently individuals as well, and so is extraordinarily important in Israelite cultic thinking and practice. B-R rendered it (as have others) as a “de-sin offering,” which, while inelegant, preserves the biblical connection between sin (moral pollution) and ritual pollution. Again the sacrifice involves a multiple structure, dealing with the different components of the community: priests, community as a whole, leaders, and individuals. The High Priest’s ritual is more elaborate than those that follow, as befits the representative of the community. Once his ritual is complete, we encounter for the other parties the refrain “and he/they shall be granted-pardon.”	Central to the <i>hattat<style>-offering is the use of its blood as a detergent to absorb and purify the pollution that has accrued in the sanctuary. As a prime signifier of life, it will have this function a number of times in the Torah.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Obligatory Sacrificial Offerings II<content><style> (<scrip1>(Leviticus)5<content>): The last sacrifice described in these opening chapters is the <i>asham,<style> variously translated as “guilt-offering” and (more recently) “reparation-offering.” Its use varies, but can involve financial restitution for wrongdoing. There is disagreement about whether the verb means “to feel guilt” (Milgrom) or “to realize guilt”; in any event, the sacrifice deals with the realm of blame/liability, especially in cases of unintentional wrongdoing. Notable in this chapter are several refrains: “and the priest is to effect-purgation for him from his sin,” “it is a <i>hattat-<style>offering” (which returns here), and “he shall be granted-pardon.”<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Instructions on Disposal of Sacrifices I<content><style> (<scrip1>(Leviticus)6<content>): What happened to the sacrifices after their being offered belongs to the category of what Hallo calls “consumption”—that is, a complex system of either nonuse (burning), “payment” for the priests (eating), or permission for the worshiper to eat. Here again we encounter a threefold structure corresponding to groups of three sacrifices. This time, however, the order adopted depends on the frequency of the sacrifice, from daily to voluntary (Wenham). The chapter also introduces the important word <i>tora<style> (conventionally spelled <i>Torah<style>), “instruction,” which will recur at key points throughout the first half of Leviticus. It apparently originally meant “[priestly] rules/instructions,” but later came to connote portions of Moses’ teachings (especially Deuteronomy) and eventually the Five Books of Moses as a whole.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Instructions on Disposal of Sacrifices II<content><style> (<scrip1>(Leviticus)7<content>): The first part of the chapter concerns the eating of three more categories of sacrifice. Vv.16–27 demonstrate the extreme caution regarding lay consumption. The ending (vv.37–38) provides a summary (which mentions a “mandate-offering” not described in this chapter!) and phraseology that usually occurs at the end of a book or major section in the Torah: “that <p.small>Yhwh</p.small> commanded Moshe at Mount Sinai . . . in the wilderness of Sinai.” <i>Installing the Priests<style> (8): This chapter and the next, which might easily have followed the instructions for it in <scrip2>Ex. 29<content>, has instead been placed here, perhaps as the logical conclusion to material about offering sacrifices. (Placing it at the end of Exodus might also have detracted from the impressive scene with which that book ends. For a discussion of the complex relationship between the Exodus and Leviticus texts, see Milgrom.) We now shift from a prescriptive mode to a descriptive, narrative one, which will prepare us for the brief but disastrous story of Aharon’s sons in Chap. <scrip>(Leviticus)10<content>.	A refrain here is various forms of “as <p.small>Yhwh</p.small> had commanded Moshe,” also a key phrase in the Exodus texts. In addition, one hears the constant use of the verb “make-holy,” appropriate in this context. Finally, one might point to the balance between Moshe’s sequence of action in Chap. <scrip>(Leviticus)8<content> and Aharon’s parallel actions in Chap. <scrip>(Leviticus)9<content>.	There is much in this chapter that is rhythmic. The description of Aharon’s being clothed in the holy vestments in vv.7–9 has the ring of ritual to it, as conveyed through its steady alternation of verb and garment.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Installation Continued: The System in Operation<content><style> (<scrip1>(Leviticus)9<content>): Until now, the description of sacrifices has been largely from the viewpoint of the worshiper. Now the perspective changes to narrative, and is from the viewpoint of the priests—with the recognition at the same time that it is a public ceremony. Again, as Milgrom has noted, there is no verbal component to the ceremony (although some have argued that it is inconceivable that sacrifices could have been offered in silence). The sacrifice of the <i>hattat<style>-offering, along with other types of offerings, once again suggests the importance of a purified, perfect system in the worship of God.	The refrain in vv.4 and 6 concerns God’s “being-seen” by the Israelites; what is in fact seen is his “Glory” or “aura,” reminiscent of Mount Sinai and the completion of the Dwelling in the book of Exodus. The ending of the chapter also recalls the ending of Exodus, with the leaders blessing the people and fire proceeding from God. <i>Systems Failure<style> (10): As so often in the Torah, a brief narrative breaks in at this point, apparently to illustrate the dangers associated with the priests’ tasks that we have just celebrated in the previous chapter. Just as the sin of the Golden Calf followed scenes of revelation at Sinai, so here too we are taken from the pomp of the priests’ installation and set face to face with human failure. Alternatively, the story could be explained as a lead-in to the laws on priestly behavior in vv.9–11, just as the Golden Calf story precedes a remade covenant in <scrip2>Ex. 34<content>.	What exactly was Nadav and Avihu’s capital crime? Commentators over the ages have argued back and forth. Some see it as accidental: Nadav and Avihu somehow misconstrued what they were supposed to do—but divine service can brook no errors on the part of the people’s representatives. Other interpreters, taking their clue from v.9, feel that Nadav and Avihu were drunk and so not in full control of their ritual duties. Milgrom’s suggestion, that the story serves to warn the Israelite audience to stay away from offering their own incense (which often was connected to idolatry), makes historical sense; but the context of the tale here, after what has gone before, makes the specific crime less important than the idea that the priests must in general “get it right.”	The chapter has a three-part structure: crime/ punishment/mourning; laws on drunkenness of priests and the proper disposal of the sacrifices; and a confrontation between Moshe and Aharon over ritual procedure, which is resolved, not by death but by reasoned discussion.<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b>Notes<content><style><h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>1:1<exerpt><b>	Now he called . . . <p.small>Yhwh<p.small> spoke:<content></p.small> The unusual syntax here links the opening of Leviticus with the revelation at Mount Sinai in <scrip2>Ex. 24:16</scrip>, the only other passage in the Torah where God “called to Moshe” (in these exact words).

Greenstein 1985a). Once the book of Exodus ends, with the erection of the Tabernacle—a symbolic reflection of the cosmos in which God “takes up dwelling” among the Israelites—we are left with a structure that must be carefully guarded and its ritual purity maintained. To this end, Leviticus now turns to the issue of pollutants, largely of the body, that arise from what we might call territorial problems: the border of what goes into the body, expressed through animals permitted and forbidden for food; the border between life and death, as expressed through sexual functions and discharges; and the border of outer surfaces, as expressed through skin disease (<i>tzaraat<style>), mildew on clothing, and mold on houses. The system of avoidance and purification that is presented in Chapters 11–15 ensures that the “Holy-Area” will either not become polluted or, should that prove to be unavoidable, will be properly decontaminated, for such contamination has the potential of leading to God’s withdrawal from dwelling “in the midst” of the people of Israel.	The pollutants discussed in these chapters do not by and large carry with them punishments per se; that is, they are not regarded as violations of the moral order (although <i>tzaraat<style> in biblical stories often did carry the implication that the victim had in fact done something to deserve his or her condition). Nor do they pose an actual danger to the person—unless he or she comes in contact with holy objects, people, or space. Then it becomes clear that biblical pollution was considered contagious; hence the need for rituals. What was generally required was that the polluted person observe a period of separation from the sanctuary (or, in more extreme cases, from the camp), to be reintegrated after either time alone or with the addition of laundering their clothes and/or washing themselves. In the latter cases, water was seen as acting as a purifying agent, not as cleanser in the detergent sense (and so the word “unclean,” so often used in translating Heb. <i>tamei<style>, is misleading). As before, these processes applied to priests (cf. Chap. <scrip>(Leviticus)22</scrip>) and to laypeople alike (Chaps. <scrip>(Leviticus)12–15</scrip>). The major pollutant, death, was seen as so virulent that it received treatment in a separate setting, <scrip2>Num. 19</scrip>.	A different category of pollution existed alongside the one we have just mentioned. It included human wrongdoing, which we might call immoral or unjust actions (e.g., incest, oppression of the poor), and also transgression of boundaries (e.g., between holy and profane, or breaching the fairly rigid system of classification in nature among animals, textiles, etc.). These types of pollution, then, involved behavior which can be seen to be disruptive or worse to the established social order. As a rule they could not be atoned for through sacrifice or other ritual forms, but lead to exile or death. They are dealt with mainly in the final section of Leviticus, Chapters 18–26.	For a full discussion of the issue of pollution in biblical Israel, see Frymer-Kensky (1983) and Greenstein (1984a).<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b>On the Dietary Rules<style><align=0><font12><content><p.small>The subject of countless interpretations over the ages, the system of</p.small> dietary laws laid down in <scrip2>Lev. 11</scrip> is best understood in the broader context of both the structure of the book and of the Levitical worldview. For the former, see the commentary to Chapter 11; for the latter, the following may be helpful.	It has long been recognized that seeing the dietary laws as resulting from consciousness of hygiene is a deeply inadequate way of understanding them. Nor can some of the later explanations adduced by Jewish tradition, however noble (for instance, that adhering to such a system teaches self-discipline), provide a satisfactory explanation for the rules in the context of Leviticus. What is more to the point is that the priestly worldview stressed boundaries and order. A hierarchy reigns in virtually every aspect of Israelite life as conceived in the Torah: people, land, animals, eligibility for the priesthood, the Tabernacle, and the calendar. There is a complex system of “graded holiness” (Jenson) informing Israelite life, with two basic messages: (1) God is to be approached in stages, and (2) the world is set up in a tight, ordered structure which reflects the distinctions between God and humans, Israel and the other peoples.	It is especially the latter that is at work in the dietary laws. The animals are discussed in categories that are reminiscent of the (priestly) creation story of <scrip2>Gen. 1</scrip>; note the refrain in both passages of (each animal) “according to its kind.” <scrip2>Lev. 11</scrip> makes distinctions, and scholars have sought to understand them according to a number of possible criteria: ease/clarity of classification (anomalies, especially as regards locomotion, tend to be prohibited), whether or not the animal is carnivorous (those that are, are prohibited), and the wild or domestic status of the animal (the former are frequently prohibited). The message that emerges from the scheme is multifaceted. It would appear to hold that:	1. Human activity is to reflect the inherent orderliness of creation, a kind of imitation of God (namely, as he kept things clear at the beginning, you should do the same with what enters your body).	2. The ideal state, already portrayed in the Garden of Eden story, is vegetarianism—where no animal life need be taken by humans (this despite God’s command to Adam to “dominate [the earth]” in <scrip2>Gen. 1:28</scrip>).	3. Animals permitted for consumption, among them those fit for sacrifice, are by and large those which are familiar to the Israelites in daily life through domestication. They tend to be animals often used by the Bible to symbolize humans. Eilberg-Schwartz calls this phenomenon “Israel in the mirror of nature,” and gives numerous examples extending throughout Israelite culture. He concludes that “the dietary restrictions carve up the animal world along the same lines as Israelite thought . . . [they] specify what kinds of animals are ‘food for thought.’”<align=0><font12><content>It should be mentioned that Mary Douglas, who pioneered an anthropological approach to these laws three decades ago, has recently given them another go (1993b). In earlier studies, Douglas (1966) saw the system in <scrip2>Lev. 11</scrip> as we have indicated above—as a “cognitive ordering of the universe”; she also spoke of it as symbolizing the protection of boundaries in Israelite society. Her latest understanding focuses on the animals as reflective of the idea that (Israelite) culture is aimed at demonstrating God’s righteousness/ justice in all areas of life, through laws regarding the body. Thus, priests, sacrificial animals, and food animals may not have any “blemish” (below, “defect”) in them; and animals prohibited for eating are either the perpetrators or victims of predation (symbolizing the human perpetrators or victims of injustice).	A final point relates to a major theme in Leviticus and indeed in many of the priestly texts of the Torah: separateness. We have seen how a major function in God’s creation of the world—with which the Bible opens!—is “separating” aspects of the natural world. A parallel verb was used in the plague narratives of Exodus, “making a distinction” (between Israelites and Egyptians). With the dietary regulations, “separating” returns. Given these thematics, one can say that Chapter 11 is a linchpin of priestly thinking. Like sexual relations, the other area of intimacy in human affairs, eating in the Bible goes far beyond the confines of one’s home and comes to symbolize an entire approach to life.<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b>On the Ritual Pollution of the Body<style><align=0><font12><content><p.small>Of special concern to the compilers of Leviticus was ritual pollution</p.small> arising from certain physical conditions. To many people, this section is even less interesting than the opening chapters of the book, and seems impossibly bogged down in primitive conceptions of disease and hygiene. But despite the fact that they undoubtedly reflect some ancient conceptions in these areas, these conditions and the role of the priest in making rulings on them have less to do with hygiene and medicine than they do with maintaining the borders between life and death, and symbolically affirming life.	It seems that the polluting discharges are primarily sexual in nature, and this is probably not accidental. The biblical priests, in their extreme concern with both procreation/genealogy (especially of men, since the priesthood was male-hereditary) and purity (in approaching the sanctuary), were presented with a major problem. God, who was to be served in purity, was also the One in whose image human beings were made (<scrip2>Gen. 1:26</scrip>), yet as a being beyond sexuality, who had neither relationships with other deities nor even a body. He left it ambiguous as to just how humans were to work out their sexual relations. The answer to the dilemma is at least partly solved by the Torah’s regulations regarding pollution and purity, incest and marriage. It is here that the issue of control is most significant. Eilberg-Schwartz points out that control and boundaries apply not only to Israel and the nations, but also and especially to male and female. As a male hierarchy, the priests viewed women, with their closer connections to the life process (and maybe also to previous forms of paganism in the form of goddess worship), as potentially dangerous, or at least problematic, to their system of purity. The seeming “disorder” of women’s discharges (perhaps representing “nature”) threatened the imposition of order (“culture”) that is so central to priestly thinking. But as a group concerned with the perpetuation of both the priestly class and the people of Israel, the priestly class could not do without women altogether, and the inescapable conclusion was strict regulation (cf. also Wegner 1992). Such regulation—labeling certain states or acts “polluting”—had the added benefit of controlling private morality in a way that could not be done otherwise (Douglas 1966).	It is important to note that in classical Judaism after the year 70 (the date of the destruction of the Second Temple), the “purity” laws, while still assiduously studied, by and large ceased to operate except within the sphere of marriage. Thus, to this day, religious Jewish couples temporarily separate sexually during the wife’s period, but this by itself does not legally affect her participation in traditional ritual. The disease here termed <i>tzaraat,<style> translated for millennia as “leprosy,” is now recognized to be something different, perhaps several forms of skin disease involving scaling or flaking. These have nowhere near the frightening and fatal implications of classic leprosy (Hansen’s Disease). Leviticus nevertheless treats <i>tzaraat<style> at great length and in close detail. Here, perhaps more than anywhere else in the book, it is clear that at least parts of Leviticus were originally intended as manuals for priestly “instruction” (note, by the way, the sevenfold occurrence of the term in the pollution chapters, 11–15). It has been theorized that <i>tzaraat<style> is of such concern here because it was felt to resemble death/decay in a clear, outward fashion, and hence fits into these chapters, which deal so much with boundaries.	An unexpected addition, from a contemporary point of view, to the <i>tzaraat<style> of the body is that which appears on textiles and on house walls (a fungus or mold or “dry rot”). The fact that the same word is used to apply to all these situations indicates that a wide concept is being applied here: how visible imperfection damages the utopia of the sacred society.	Finally, the role of the priest in these chapters should be noted. He does not function to remove demons or perform magical rites, but rather to examine the one suspected of having the disease (note the repetition of “look” in the chapter). He is more teacher and guardian of purity than healer or intermediary.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Dietary Rules<content><style> (<scrip1>(Leviticus)11</scrip>): After ten chapters devoted mainly to cultic rules, we move from the priestly altar to everyone’s table—a fine example of the dual concerns of Leviticus (later Judaism was in fact to dub the table an “altar in miniature,” taking literally the injunction in Exodus for Israel to become a “kingdom of priests”). The chapter, as mentioned in “On the Book of Leviticus and Its Structure,” functions as a bridge between the first two parts of the book. As Hallo notes, it rounds out the question of consuming food, a major issue in sacrifices; it also introduces the motif of pollution in a systematic way (there were references to it in regard to sacrifices, but not in as full a manner). The use of “Instruction” in v.46 echoes the summaries of sacrifices in Chap. <scrip>(Leviticus)7</scrip>, while “you are to separate” in v.47 links the chapter with the previous one. Looking forward, “Instruction” is also used in the pollution chapters that follow, and the fivefold repetition of “hallow/holy” in vv.44–45 even points us toward the major section on Holiness in the third part of the book.	It should be noted that, from vv.24–40, eating is not the issue, but rather coming into contact with the carcass of a <i>tamei<style> animal. The two areas are joined with the introduction of “swarming” creatures in vv.41–44, and the whole chapter concludes with a call to “separation.”	Refrains are many, giving the chapter a more poetic structure than one would expect from such a list: “it is <i>tamei<style> for you,” “it is a detestable-thing for you,” “it is an abominable-thing,” “according to its kind,” “<i>tamei<style> until sunset.” The overwhelmingly negative character of the refrains serves to drum in caution and promote avoidance.	Many of the animals on the lists of <scrip2>Lev. 11</scrip> are familiar, but it must be stressed that, as with plant and place-names in the Bible, a number of the precise identifications have been lost to us, and educated guesses are in order.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Pollution from Childbirth<content><style> (<scrip1>(Leviticus)12</scrip>): This chapter, which is in chiastic relation to Chap. <scrip>(Leviticus)15</scrip>, designates a new mother as <i>tamei,<style> most likely due to her intimate contact with the life/death boundary during childbirth. Her separation from and reintegration into the community echo similar customs in many societies (see Bamberger); as often happens with life-cycle events, ritual here reflects what is happening psychologically. The doubling of the separation period when it is a girl that is born is best explained by the concept that a girl potentially doubles the “life-leak” that has taken place (Greenstein 1984a), since she will one day be a childbearing woman who will herself confront the life-death continuum.	While men obviously do not contract ritual pollution through childbirth, the concept of pollution from bodily discharges applies to them as well, as in the case of an involuntary emission of semen (cf. Chap. <scrip>(Leviticus)15</scrip>).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Pollution from<content><style> Tzaraat (13): Notable in this chapter is the role of the priest, who functions neither as medicine man nor as doctor, but simply as a religious official whose duty it is to check the afflicted person for signs of what is considered ritually polluting, and to act accordingly.	Like other sections of Leviticus, this chapter and the next show signs of editing (for instance, the material in <scrip>(Leviticus)13:47–59</scrip>). Nevertheless, there is a clear structural pattern characterized by variations of “when . . . if . . . if” (Wenham).	The chapter’s character as “instruction manual” is brought out, according to Fishbane (1974), by its chiastic structure. It is built on three word-groups: (1) “swelling,” (2) “scab/spread,” (3) “shiny-spot” that recur in vv.4–38 (in the form: 3,2,1; 1,2,3; 3,2,1; 2,3). This “unexpected structure” (especially in a nonliterary text), he maintains, may have had the function of easing memorization for the priests, who needed to know this material for their “fieldwork.”<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Purification from<content><style> Tzaraat (14): In <scrip>(Leviticus)13:44–45</scrip> we were informed about the diseased person’s isolation from the camp. We now turn to the ceremony attending his purification and, from v.33 on, that of a house. In a complex ritual that foreshadows the great Purgation ceremony of Chap. <scrip>(Leviticus)16</scrip> (with some connections to the ritual of purging the impurity of death in <scrip2>Num. 19</scrip>), <i>tzaraat<style> is removed from its dangerous position in the camp. Many aspects seem to be archaic and even tinged with magic; in Milgrom’s view, these characteristics survive only symbolically, and ancient Israel has rid itself of dependence on magic—in his words, it has “eviscerated” demonism.	The substances used for purification—cedar, scarlet, hyssop—seem to connote life (and hence remove the death symbolism of <i>tzaraat<style>): they all bear the red color of blood, which itself was the great biblical indicator of life (cf. <scrip>(Leviticus)17:11</scrip> below). Notable is the adjective “living,” applied to both the birds and the water utilized in the ceremony.	The purification ritual itself, interestingly, parallels the consecration of the priests in Chap. <scrip>(Leviticus)8</scrip>. This is particularly evident in the fourfold dabbing of blood on the right extremities of the diseased person (cf. <scrip>(Leviticus)8:23</scrip>, <scrip2>24</scrip> for the corresponding action). In Chap. <scrip>(Leviticus)8</scrip>, movement took place from the everyday sphere into that of the holy; here, the person with <i>tzaraat<style> moves from isolation to eventual reintegration into society (i.e., the camp).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Polluting Discharges<content><style> (<scrip1>(Leviticus)15</scrip>): This chapter concerns genital discharges—both those that arise from disease and those that are normal but involuntary. As Levine notes, sexual purity was crucial for approaching the Israelite sanctuary, as opposed to ancient Near Eastern rituals in general, where sexuality was frequently part and parcel of the worship of the gods.	Such pollution was considered much more contagious than that we have encountered previously, which is not surprising, given the area in which it falls. Wenham has noted the chiastic structure here, with male and female interchanging with short-term and long-term events. The core (vv.16–24)—the normal flows of seminal emissions for men and menstrual discharge from women—contrasts with discharges resulting from disease (vv.2–12, 25–27). The former merely pollute until sunset (except for the case of a couple having intercourse during the wife’s period), and thus demonstrate the modesty and restraint in matters of divine worship more than pointing to some kind of stigma per se.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Day of Purgation/Atonement<content><style> (<scrip1>(Leviticus)16</scrip>): This chapter forms the climax of the section that began in Chap. <scrip>(Leviticus)11</scrip>. It is, along with <scrip2>Num. 19</scrip>, the purification ritual par excellence, and has received much attention throughout the ages. As modern commentators have pointed out, two things are happening here: first, the sanctuary is being purged of the ritual pollution that has accumulated from both priests and laypeople; and second, the accumulated sins of the community are receiving atonement. It is not surprising, therefore, that the chapter is built on different uses of the verb <i>kipper,<style> which can denote covering, purging, atonement (expiation), or ransom; here the two meanings “purging” and “atoning” seem to fit the double context best. Probably the “purging” part is the earlier one, as many ancient Near Eastern cults utilized purification ceremonies for their sanctuaries.	Appropriately, the ritual includes two processes, outlined by Levine: riddance, which involves transferring sin to a living creature and driving it outside the community into the uninhabited wilderness, and purification, which utilizes the blood of a sacrifice (rather like the <i>hattat<style> encountered previously in the book). Both rituals are conducted largely by Aharon, who as High Priest acts on behalf of the entire community.	Later Judaism was fascinated by these rites; a detailed account of how they were to be conducted in postbiblical times has survived in the Mishnah (ed. c. 200), and a narrative version is still verbally reenacted by traditional Jews once a year on the Day of Atonement.	The chapter opens with direct mention of the deaths of Nadav and Avihu (Chap. <scrip>(Leviticus)10</scrip>). This serves at least two purposes: first, it creates a bracket into which the Leviticus texts on pollution occur; and second, it reminds the audience of the pressing need to purify the sanctuary, whose very first recorded defilement came about as a result of the illegitimate act of Aharon’s sons.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>On the Shedding of Animal Blood<content><style> (<scrip1>(Leviticus)17</scrip>): This chapter appears to be either an appendix to the first two parts of the book (sacrifices and purity) or a transition between them and the chapters on “holiness.” It must be said, however, that it does not use the standard wording of the holiness chapters. The text deals with the Israelites’ slaughtering of animals for food outside the sanctuary (“Dwelling”), insisting instead that such killing take place “at the entrance to the Tent of Appointment.” In contrast, <scrip2>Deut. 12:20</scrip>ff. permits the slaughtering of animals for meat without bringing them to the sanctuary—provided that their blood is poured out (since the consumption of blood is universally prohibited in the Torah). Scholars disagree about which practice came first; some (e.g., Wenham) argue for a wilderness setting here, while others see the chapter as reflecting the antipagan feelings of postexilic Israel (Bamberger; cf. v.7). Whatever the provenance, our chapter is clear about the extraordinary power of blood in Israelite thinking. As the life, which belongs to God, it must be returned to him, either actually, at the altar, or symbolically, on the ground (Greenstein 1984a). Here it is seen as effecting ransom; the life of the sacrificial animal substitutes for that of the sacrificer (cf. “On Sacrifice,” above). The upshot is that the taking of animal life is done with extreme awareness and care.	The chapter is built at least partially on repeating sound patterns. A threefold refrain is “that man is to be cut off from his kinspeople,” stressing the seriousness of the prohibition. Four times we hear “any-man, any-man” (Heb. <i>ish ish<style>), reinforcing the unusually broad scope of the command indicated by the beginning of the chapter (“to Aharon and to his sons and to all the Children of Israel”). Finally, in v.10 through 15, the word <i>nefesh<style> occurs nine times, with the alternating meanings of “person” and “life” (the pattern is 1–3–1–3–1 in these meanings).<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b>Notes<content><style><h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>11:2<exerpt><b>	domestic-animals:<content><style> Heb. <i>behema,<style> as distinct from <i>hayya,<style> wild animals.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>3<exerpt><b>	cleaving:<content><style> Creating the effect of a two-part foot, to make clear that the animal does not walk on its “hands” (which would be unnatural, in the biblical view) (Levine). <exerpt><b>bringing-up:<content><style> Descriptive of the digestive process of these animals: they have multiple stomachs, and so after food is first chewed and swallowed, it is brought up, rechewed, and reswallowed.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>5<exerpt><b>	hyrax:<content><style> A brown rodentlike mammal with short ears which is actually not part of the rodent family (also called the coney or rock-rabbit).<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>7<exerpt><b>	pig:<content><style> Still avoided by many Jews and Moslems today, it was also used in cults worshiping gods of the underworld.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>11<exerpt><b>	detestable-things:<content><style> They are not merely prohibited, but are labeled as abhorrent.

In this book we have already encountered the “Holy-Shrine,” “holy-things,” “holy donations,” and the like; we have seen that Israel is to be “separate” from the nations around it in a variety of life areas. But now we move toward expansion of what was called for at the first moments at Sinai: for Israel to be a “[kingdom of priests and a] holy nation” (<scrip2>Ex. 19:6</scrip>).	While the exact structure and setting of the Holiness Code, as these chapters were designated a century ago, are subject to scholarly debate, its thrust seems clear enough. Beginning with sexual relations, Israel is to be “holy,” “separate” from other nations. Holiness here has a connotation of wholeness and perfection; Wright (1992) has defined it as “that which is consistent with God and his character.”	<i>Imitatio dei,<style> the human urge to be godlike, is an ancient, undoubtedly prehistoric one. We long to be linked with the primal powers of existence, whose rush we feel at heightened moments of <i>perception,<style> but whose perfection is always out of reach in the flesh and blood world of human beings. The Torah, in contrast, presents the longing for perfection and wholeness as properly expressed through a discipline of <i>behavior<style> in all areas of life, personal and communal. The central lines “Holy are you to be, / for holy am I, <sc>YHWH</sc> your God” (<scrip>(Leviticus)19:2</scrip>) are followed by line after line calling for holiness in worship, agriculture, interpersonal relations, business, the treatment of the disabled and the elderly, court procedure, and sexuality, to list some of the areas covered.	Many communities of the “elect,” from Qumran at the Dead Sea to medieval monasteries, and many individuals, from biblical Nazirites (<scrip2>Num. 6</scrip>) to Sufi mystics and St. Francis, have sought to create lives suffused with holiness; one could easily maintain that many of the mainstream forms and ideas in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have remained wedded to this approach. They all owe a debt, one way or the other, to <scrip2>Lev. 18–26</scrip>, especially in the communal sphere. Rarely has the drive toward holiness found as full expression in a vision of “real life” society, grounded in the everyday world of people and institutions, as it does in the texts to be found in the following chapters.	For many decades, debate has raged within the scholarly community as to the date and setting of H, the putative stratum of literature to which these chapters belong. As of this writing there is still not full agreement on (a) whether H was indeed a separate document or school, and (b) whether its origin and influence can be easily traced (cf., for instance, Knohl, and Milgrom 1993). These disagreements, however, should not and must not detract from the importance of what we have in these chapters: a significant statement of the ethical code of ancient Israel which continues to speak to contemporary problems.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Pollution from Forbidden Unions<content><style> (<scrip1>(Leviticus)18</scrip>): Now begin, thematically and stylistically, the chapters on holiness. Like much of this final section of the book, Chap. <scrip>(Leviticus)18</scrip> is distinguished by its powerful use of rhetoric (cf. vv.3–5, similar in tone to much of Deuteronomy). Separation returns as a major theme, this time stressing the divide between Israel and the nations around (vv.3 and 27–30). The emphasis on sexuality mirrors that on food in Chap. <scrip>(Leviticus)11</scrip>; the two often reflect each other in culture, both in practice and in imagery. Thus the wording here (“it is insidiousness,” “it is perversion”) parallels the rhetoric of Chap. <scrip>(Leviticus)11</scrip> (“it is abomination,” “it is a detestable-thing”). Structurally, just as the laws on pollution began with categories of and distinctions between animals for the purpose of eating, so the holiness laws begin with categories of and distinctions between partners for the purposes of sexual relations (Eilberg-Schwartz, Goodman). The confusing of boundaries again becomes a grave matter.	In Schwartz’s (1987) view, the list of forbidden women goes through a sequence from close relatives, to indirect ones, to women related to each other, and finally to other cases of “abomination.” In general, the list deals with women whose sexuality and reproductivity are controlled by males (Wegner 1992)—in other words, it reflects a highly patriarchal society.	An odd omission of sexual prohibitions is the one between a man and his daughter; perhaps it was universally understood as the primary one, and hence did not require mentioning.	Refrains in the chapter, which create its backbone, include “I am Y<p.small>hwh</p.small> your God” and the constant “the nakedness of X you are not to expose.” Late in the chapter, the words “abomination” and “<i>tum’a<style>” frequently recur.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>General Regulations on Holiness I<content><style> (<scrip1>(Leviticus)19</scrip>): As the key chapter of this part of Leviticus, Chap. <scrip>(Leviticus)19</scrip> is wide-ranging and rhetorically powerful. It extends holiness to virtually all areas of life—family, calendar, cult, business, civil and criminal law, social relations, and sexuality. Most (but not all) of the laws deal with what we would term ethics, that is, relations between people (Wenham notes the alternation of the terms “fellow [citizen],” “kinsman,” and “neighbor”). As such, they have become an exemplar and a cornerstone, at least in idealized form, in Western thinking about these issues.	Structurally speaking, the chapter is not systematic. As Schwartz (1987)has noted, this is probably intentional, reflecting the desire to avoid categorization or compartmentalization of life before God. He lays out the structure of the core part of the chapter, vv.3–32, as discrete subsections, each ending with “I am Y<p.small>hwh </p.small> [your God],” with vv.33–36 as two appendices, and a summary in v.37.	The opening (v.2) is crucial, even though the word-root “holy” does not recur in the chapter (it does, however, reverberate within the next four chapters). The style is predominantly apodictic—“You are not to . . . ,” as was Chap. <scrip>(Leviticus)18</scrip>, and concentrates mostly on the negating of certain kinds of behavior. At the same time, the chapter makes a moving positive plea for proper treatment of the elderly, the poor, and, in general, one’s “neighbor” (which is extended to the foreigner [“sojourner”] in vv.33–34).	Modern commentators have noted the similarity between certain passages in the chapter and the Ten Commandments, but do not see our chapter as directly derivative. Similar parallels may also be found in the Naboth story from the Elijah cycle (I Kings 21).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>General Regulations on Holiness II<content><style> (<scrip1>(Leviticus)20</scrip>): We move now into laws dealing with some of the more serious offenses against God in the biblical view: idolatry (including worship of the “Molekh” and consulting spirits), insulting parents, adultery, and sexual crimes. These are distinguished from the previous chapter by the inclusion of punishments; their seriousness is indicated by their capital nature. The reiteration of sexual laws forms a bracket with Chap. <scrip>(Leviticus)18</scrip>, thus highlighting the central position and rhetoric of 19. Another bracket, this time within the chapter, involves the chiasm of necromancy and the exhortation to be holy (vv.6–7 and 26–27). Finally, while the motifs of the Israelites avoiding pagan practices, and the land “vomiting out” its wrongdoers, return from Chap. <scrip>(Leviticus)18</scrip>, there is a further throwback (vv.24–26): to Chap. <scrip>(Leviticus)11</scrip>, where “separation” from the nations was a major issue in terms of diet.<i>Regulations Concerning Holiness: Priests I<style> (21): This chapter, and the one that follows, relate holiness to the suitability of priests to serve in the sanctuary. The laws are in the main negative ones, that is, they outline ways in which a priest may be disqualified. The first part of the chapter concentrates on how contact with death disqualifies a priest; in Levine’s view, this avoidance of the dead reflects the Bible’s abhorrence of pagan cults centered around death. The laws concerning soundness of body and sexuality confirm earlier passages on holiness as wholeness.	The central word-root is again “holy”; six times in Chaps. <scrip>(Leviticus)21–22</scrip> we hear the refrain “I am Y<p.small>hwh</p.small> the one-who-hallows you/them.”<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Regulations Concerning Holiness: Priests II<content><style> (<scrip1>(Leviticus)22</scrip>): The priestly rules on holiness continue, with special attention given to the priest’s proper state when he eats of the “holy donations.” The second part of the chapter, from v.17 on, turns to the state of the sacrificial animals. They are to be without blemish, just as the priests must be (cf. Chap. <scrip>(Leviticus)21</scrip>). This correspondence between human and animal has been noted before; it is part of Leviticus’s general scheme of a perfect God requiring perfection in worship. <i>Holy Days<style> (23): Having dealt with holiness in such areas as worship, family life, ethics, priestly qualifications and behavior, and sacrificial animals and objects, the text now turns to holiness in time: the sacred calendar. While all ancient societies marked sacred time, in Judaism as it evolved out of the Bible the calendar took on particular significance, especially in the situation of exile. The centrality of time in Judaism has been articulately portrayed by Heschel; here we will limit discussion to the fullest of the biblical sacred calendars (others occur in <scrip2>Ex. 23</scrip> and <scrip2>34</scrip>, and <scrip2>Deut. 16</scrip>), the one set forth in the present chapter.	The scheme is characteristically Levitical—it focuses on order and perfection, expressing these qualities by the use of the number 7, which was used thus in a number of ancient Near Eastern cultures. A partial list in this regard would include: 7 days from sabbath to sabbath; 7 days of two major festivals, spring and fall; 7 weeks between the two pilgrimage festivals in the spring; and all the holy days falling within the first 7 months of the year, with a major cluster occurring in the seventh month. To this could be added material from other passages in the Torah: 7 years to every sabbatical year (<scrip2>Ex. 23:10–11</scrip>, <scrip2>Lev. 25:2–7</scrip>, <scrip2>Deut. 15:1–3</scrip>); and 7-times-7 years (plus one) till each Jubilee year (<scrip2>Lev. 25:8–17</scrip>). One could go further (cf. the discussion and lists in Jenson), but the thrust should be clear: time, as well as space and behavior, is to be ordered in a way that again reflects divine perfection. One might also mention the continuation of this kind of thinking in both later Judaism and Christianity, which looked upon history itself in a schematic way.	As laid out in Leviticus, the sacred days of the seventh month follow a conventional ancient pattern described by Gaster (1961): the dying of the old year (“mortification” and “purgation,” as expressed in Rosh Ha-Shanah and Yom Kippur), followed by the birth of the new year (“invigoration” and “jubilation,” as expressed in Sukkot). The biblical calendar, then, evolved along dual tracks—lunar-solar (lunar months of 29 or 30 days, with an extra month added in late winter, 7 times every 19 years); and spring/fall new year (Passover falls in the “first month,” but the full new year pattern, as we have mentioned, is played out in the fall).	A final indication of a late provenance for Chap. <scrip>(Leviticus)23</scrip>’s calendar lies in the long treatment (vv.9–22, a third of the chapter) of Shavuot, the “Feast of Weeks.” The emphasis seems to be on land here, suggesting a resettlement motif that would be particularly appropriate after the exile in Babylonia.	Theme words in the chapter include: “appointed-times,” “proclamation of holiness,” “throughout all your settlements,” “a fire-offering to Yhwh,” and “any-kind of servile work you are not to do.” V.39–43, on the practice of and rationale behind Sukkot, seem to be another addition to the text, as they disrupt its natural flow.<i><h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Miscellany<content><style> (<scrip1>(Leviticus)24</scrip>): Two issues, unrelated to what has gone before, are treated here: certain ritual objects in the Dwelling (oil/lamps and “showbread”), and the story of a man who insulted God and therefore had to be executed (along with further rules about capital crimes). The function of this chapter is not clear; perhaps it serves as a breather between the important sections on sacred days (23) and land tenure (25). It is also possible (as Levine notes) that chapters such as this one and <scrip2>Num. 15</scrip> serve as a repository for various cultic laws that needed a location. There are two other places in the Torah where a brief passage on the lights in the sanctuary may originally have served to separate sections: the end of <scrip2>Ex. 27</scrip> and the beginning of <scrip2>Num. 8</scrip>. If so, that function no longer is as major as it once might have been.	The first two parts (2–4 and 5–9) are linked by their common vocabulary: “take,” “arrange,” “regularly,” and “before the presence of Y<p.small>hwh</p.small>” (Wenham). The second section (vv.10–23) is united by its chiastic structure (cf. Wenham here as well). It has points of contact with material in the Exodus laws, but here with the characteristic addition (v.22) of “I, Y<p.small>hwh,</p.small> am your God.”<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Regulations Concerning Land and Slavery<content><style> (<scrip1>(Leviticus)25</scrip>): A final area of holiness that Leviticus discusses is that of ownership. The rules set forth in this chapter are based on the assumption that land, a most precious commodity in the ancient (and modern) Near East, and human beings, equally precious in the Bible, are not in fact the property of other human beings. The phrases “the land is not to be sold inharness, / for the land is mine” (v.23) and “For my servants are they . . . they are not to be sold as the sale of serfs” (v.42) express the main corollary: God is the sole owner of land and people. The chapter, then, sets out regulations that make perpetual human ownership of these impossible. In the case of land, not only is the soil to rest every seven years, but every fifty years (7 x 7 + 1), the land is to be “released” back to its original owner (who “redeems” it). Similarly, indentured servants—those who are forced into working for someone because of debts—are redeemable, if not by kin then by the occurrence of the Jubilee year.	Several things about the chapter suggest a late date to Levine. Redemption focuses on the individual rather than on the clan; “at Mount Sinai” might indicate an editorial hand; and the passages here, unlike their counterparts in <scrip2>Ex. 21</scrip> and <scrip2>Deut. 15</scrip>, concentrate less on eradicating poverty than on ensuring that property stays in the family over generations. Indeed, some of the conditions presupposed by the chapter suggest the situation portrayed in <scrip2>Neh. 5</scrip>, after the Babylonian Exile.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Conclusion: Blessings and Curses<content><style> (<scrip1>(Leviticus)26:3–45</scrip>): The initial ending of Leviticus (Chap. <scrip>(Leviticus)27</scrip> was added later) follows a pattern common to treaties in the ancient Near East: it provides blessings for remaining loyal to God (the suzerain) and curses for spurning him. A similar pattern, with greater rhetoric and emotional force, occurs in <scrip2>Deut. 28–30</scrip>, with briefer examples in <scrip2>Ex. 23:25</scrip>ff. and <scrip2>Josh. 24:20</scrip>. The blessings center around peace and its attendant benefit, agricultural abundance; the curses detail, in increasing force, the calamities brought on by war: famine, defeat, and ultimately exile. That the curses take up much more room than the blessings is not surprising, given the didactic nature of the chapter; this is also characteristic of ancient Near Eastern suzerain-vassal treaty literature, where the major emphasis is placed on what will happen if the pact is violated. Later Jewish tradition dealt with the devastating tone and content of the curses by prescribing that, when read publicly as part of the weekly Torah cycle, they be chanted in an undertone.	The structure of the chapter gives strong indication that there has been considerable editorial work here, and that may explain some of the difficulties in the later parts of the chapter. The confusion may well reflect the passage of time during and after the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians in 587 <p.small>b.c.e.</p.small>, and thus an evolving response to the catastrophe. The pattern (suggested by H. L. Ginsberg, who is quoted by Levine) moves from doom to hope, and then to an explanation of why restoration has been delayed. In any event, it should be noted (as Levine does) that the curses are not all doom; they do, at various points, leave the door open for Israel’s “turning,” a point much emphasized by the Prophets.	<scrip2>Lev. 26</scrip> is the first great monotheistic response to catastrophe, built on the idea that human beings have the capacity to influence their own fate by obeying or disobeying God. In Judaism, which was to experience numerous such catastrophes over the course of its history, literary response became an important mode of coping. Christianity took its own characteristic path in answering some of the same issues on a personal level.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Appendix: Support for the Sanctuary<content><style> (<scrip1>(Leviticus)27</scrip>): Clearly a later addition to Leviticus, Chap. <scrip>(Leviticus)27</scrip> provides for the upkeep of the sanctuary through a variety of means: donations of silver; pledging animals or property which is later redeemed for silver; confiscated property; and tithes. The nature of the text as appendix is obvious, given the finality of tone in the previous chapter, but it could also be said that 27 provides an appropriate ending to Leviticus, since it talks about dedication of property to God, as the book does in regard to all areas of life.<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b>Notes<content><style><h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>18:4<exerpt><b>	do:<content><style> Elsewhere (especially in Deuteronomy) I translate Heb. <i>‘-s-h<style> as “observe”; here, I have retained “do” as a theme word in v. 3–5.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>6<exerpt><b>	blood-relation:<content><style> Heb. <i>she’er,<style> “flesh, meat,” synonymous with <i>basar,<style> which, however, does not bear the additional meaning of “kin.” Note again the connection between food and sexuality. <exerpt><b>exposing their “nakedness”<content><style>: To have sexual contact with them; “nakedness” is probably a euphemism for “genitals.”<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>7<exerpt><b>	The nakedness of your father, and the nakedness of your mother:<content><style> Perhaps better understood as “the nakedness (reserved for) your father, the nakedness of your mother” (Levine).
