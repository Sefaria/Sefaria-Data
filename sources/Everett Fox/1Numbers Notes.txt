But the book in its present form is a great deal more than that. To be sure, it contains stories of the long trek from Egypt to Canaan, with moments of triumph and difficulty, obedience and rebellion. Some of the great narratives of the Pentateuch are here, from the account of Korah’s revolt (Chap. <scrip>(Numbers)16</scrip>) to Moshe’s sin (20) to Bil’am’s recalcitrant donkey (22). But the book also features census and sacrificial donation lists; details of the setup of Israel’s camp; the duties of the Levites in the traveling sanctuary; laws regarding wives suspected of adultery and those who take on extraordinary vows; a complicated and mysterious ritual for removing the extreme ritual pollution carried by death; a doubled tale about daughters inheriting land; and a host of other rules and regulations.	It is this composite character and apparent lack of easily definable structure that imbue the book with fascination for scholars and with frustration for lay readers. While the four other books of the Torah also mix narrative, law, poetry, and cultic regulations, none of them has combined and alternated these genres with such abandon. There are a number of possible explanations for this. First, it is conceivable that Numbers as we have it reflects the desire to preserve as many traditions about the wilderness wanderings as possible; as Greenberg (1972) has demonstrated with the traditions about the revelation on Mount Sinai, it may have been more important to collect everything relevant than to create a smooth or seamless text. Second, here as elsewhere in the Torah, narrative may serve to introduce law or to provide the preceding background for it. Third, there is an aesthetic consideration: the great rebellion stories in the center of the book, to give an example, are separated from one another by prescriptive legal passages. Earlier books in the Torah similarly utilize breaks of varying lengths (e.g., the genealogical lists in Genesis, the Tabernacle texts of Exodus). The result is to highlight both narrative and law, and also to provide a large-scale rhythm to the book (Milgrom comments on the consistent alternating pattern).	The kind of literary mixture that we find in Numbers goes beyond that rabbinic dictum that “the Torah speaks in human language.” It suggests that, far from betraying human frailties in the composition or transmission of the traditions presented in Numbers, a purposeful and powerful hand has been at work. More than any other book in the Torah, this one gives evidence of an editorial process. While the finished product may not be able to help us unravel the detailed history of that process, we may at least observe that much has been added to the wilderness narratives, in a way that transforms them into a patterned view of Israel’s early history.	Recent commentaries see a two- or three-part structure to Numbers, based either on geography—the Sinai Wilderness, Kadesh, the plains of Moab—or chronology. Since the book as we have it is not entirely clear about either area—there seems to be internal disagreement about where the spies (Chap. <scrip>(Numbers)13</scrip>) left from and went, and also about when the forty-year punishment began—I am in general agreement with Olson’s scheme of seeing the book as “The Death of the Old and the Birth of the New,” that is, the slave generation and that of their children, which are set apart by the two census lists in Chapters 1 and 26. But the differences between Chapters 1–10 and 11–25 must also be taken into account. I propose the following theoretical structure:<align=30>	I In the Wilderness of Sinai: The Camp<align=90>	1 The Census (Musterings) of the Israelites; the Duties of the Levites<align=90>	2 The Ordering of the Camp<align=90>	3 The Census of the Levites According to Their Duties<align=90>	4 The Tasks of the Levites<align=90>	5 Threats to the Ritual Integrity of the Camp<align=90>	6 Procedure Regarding a Nazirite; the Priestly Blessing<align=90>	7 Gifts of the Tribes to the Tabernacle<align=90>	8 The Tabernacle Lamps; Purification of the Levites<align=90>	9 Passover in the Wilderness; God’s Presence with the Tabernacle<align=90>	10 The Journey to Canaan Commences II<align=30>	II The Rebellious Folk: Narratives of Challenge<align=60>	A Sealing the Fate of the First Generation<align=90>	11 First Rebellion: Food<align=90>	12 Second Rebellion: Siblings<align=90>	13 The Spies’ Mission<align=90>	14 Third Rebellion: Panic<align=30>	Interlude:<align=90>	15 Rules on Sacrifices, Sabbath, and Tassels<align=60>	B The Crisis of Leadership<align=90>	16 Fourth Rebellion: Korah and the Levites<align=90>	17 Fifth Rebellion: After the Purge<align=90>	18 The Levites as Guardians<align=90>	19 Pollution by Death and Its Removal<align=90>	20 Sixth Rebellion: The Sin of Moshe and Aharon<align=60>	C Encountering the Other<align=90>	21 Encounters with Various Neighbors; Seventh Rebellion: Food and Water<align=90>	22–24 The Bil’am Cycle<align=90>	25 Final Rebellion: Apostasy<align=30>	III In the Plains of Moab: Preparations for the Conquest of Canaan<align=90>	26 The Second Census<align=90>	27 Inheritance: the Daughters of Tzelofhad I<align=90>	28–29 Sacrifices for Holy Days<align=90>	30 Rules Concerning Vows<align=90>	31 First Battle and Aftermath<align=90>	32 Two and a Half Tribes and the Future Conquest<align=90>	33 Wilderness Itinerary and Warning<align=90>	34 Future Borders<align=90>	35 The Levites’ Towns of Asylum<align=90>	36 Inheritance: the Daughters of Tzelofhad II<align=0><font12><content>	In this scheme, not only does the otherwise haphazard subject matter of the book fit roughly into the three divisions, but the divisions themselves seem to correspond to narrative mood swings. This might be characterized as a movement from order to chaos, and back to order again. The wilderness camp is still connected to the ordering—nation-founding—experience of Sinai; God speaks to Moshe from the Tabernacle, both here and in Leviticus, and the structure serves as a surrogate Mount Sinai. The concerns of Part I, therefore, are expressed in lists, and the section is filled with them.	With the rebellion narratives of Part II, which not coincidentally take place as soon as Israel sets out on its journey through the wilderness, the idealistic order of Sinai is broken, and the people (and Moshe) must deal with the harsh reality of life in the desert. It becomes clear that nation-founding involves not only the giving of laws and the arranging of societal roles, but also the developing of the ability to cope with physical and spiritual challenges to survival.	The slave generation is unable to successfully meet the challenge, and Part II chronicles their failures and their punishment. They had been born into the rigidly ordered situation of slavery—an order with underlying spiritual chaos—and only their children, born into the chaotic but free air of the wilderness, can be readied for the orderly transition into conquest and societal life on their own soil. This readying process is portrayed in Part III, through a series of lists once again: another military census, clear inheritance laws, a sacred calendar tied to the growing cycles of the land, a tracing of the Israelites’ travels through the wilderness, and a laying out of future borders. By the end of the book, Israel is fully prepared to enter the land, with a new generation, new leadership in the wings, a full set of societal rules, an operative cult, and, above all, a collective memory of experiences that serve to instruct and warn future generations. These issues will be fully and memorably summarized in the great final speeches of Moshe that comprise the last book of the Torah, Deuteronomy. Of special note in the book of Numbers is the emphasis on the Levites and their tasks. The text introduces this group, which may have originated as a guild rather than as a tribe, already in Chapter 1 (v.47). Thereafter, they play a major role in the book—the portrayal of their purification for service (Chap. <scrip>(Numbers)8</scrip>), the great rebellion fomented by some of them (16), their important function as guardians against encroachment on the sanctuary (18), and their distribution in certain towns that serve also as places of refuge for accidental manslayers (35) is spread throughout the book, as if to form a distinctive thread amid the other themes of wandering, rebellion, and preparation for conquest. This interest in the Levites, in the eyes of some scholars, signals a particularly late development in the history of Israelite religion, and perhaps a late editing for our book as well. It also indicates how thoroughly the wilderness traditions have been reworked, to establish a hoary history for the central Israelite institutions connected with divine worship. While it is next to impossible to trace the internal struggles of the Israelite priesthood over the centuries with historical precision, it seems clear that such strife was part of history, and may be reflected in the portrayals of Aharon, Korah, and Pin’has, to mention just a few of the priestly/Levitical figures that populate the wilderness stories. At any rate, the combining of clearly priestly material into the varied narrative and poetic stuff of Numbers has created a book different than what might have been, had the editors sought a story and only a story. The same, of course, might be said for the entire five books of which Numbers is a part.<align=0><font12><content>	As I noted in the introduction to Volume II of this work, <i>Now These Are the Names<style> (Exodus), the hero’s journey through the unknown is, of course, a central theme in Western literature. From Homer’s <i>Odyssey<style> to Sinbad’s journeys in <i>A Thousand and One Nights<style> to the many twentieth-century works on the theme, the protagonist’s unfamiliar terrain has become the familiar metaphor for our own inner journeys. Such accounts normally concentrate on obstacles in the way: opponents divine and human, harsh landscapes, wild beasts, lack of water, lack of people and succor. Heroes are left to their own devices, and if they are successful in completing their journey, the audience experiences the vicarious triumph of conquering the impossible. Indeed, the operating principle seems to be: the greater the obstacles, the more stunning the triumph.	The wilderness trek recounted in the heart of the book of Numbers has a wholly different feel. To be sure, there are obstacles, some of them standard, such as the dearth of food and water and the opposition of hostile nations along the way. But the main emphasis in these texts is on internal obstacles—the people’s lack of trust, faith, and courage. And as so often happens in the Torah, physical background, as important as it obviously is in Numbers, what with a myriad of geographical locations noted, is overshadowed by the dominant issue of the relationship between Israel and God. The God of the wilderness journey is initially a provider and protector (cf. <scrip2>Ex. 15–18</scrip>); when he turns lawgiver, Israel’s situation seems secure despite the harsh ecological setting. But Numbers has chosen to remember the people’s moments of doubt and rebellion above all, and so the orderly leaving of Sinai which closes the first part of the book, along withthe orderly preparations for conquest that mark its third part, fade in the reader’s consciousness before the memorable narratives in Chapters 11–25.	It has been pointed out (Tunyogi) that these stories serve as “foundation accounts,” as stories that tell about “the archetypes to be repeated in all coming generations.” As such, they are significant in later Israel’s understanding of itself. Through the book of Numbers, later generations were warned not to repeat the sins of the wilderness; and Moshe himself came to be looked upon as the quintessential prophet. For the era of the literary prophets (ninth-sixth centuries <p.small>b.c.e.</p.small>), concerned as they were with Israel’s forgetfulness and backsliding, and the era of Babylonian Exile (sixth century <p.small>b.c.e.</p.small>), in which the exiles also found themselves outside the Promised Land, there could have been no stronger warning or cause for hope than the stories and laws set down in the Torah, and especially the traditions recorded in the book of Numbers.<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b_caps>PART I<br><br>The Wilderness Camp<br><br><style>(<scrip1>(Numbers)1–10<content>)<align=0><font12><content><p.small>To list is to demonstrate a sense of order and control. The book of </p.small>Numbers commences with several lists that serve to arrange and catalog the Israelite camp in the wilderness: first, the “accountings” of the Israelites fit for battle; then, the symmetrical arrangement of the camp itself, around the Tabernacle; and finally, the special listing of the Levite population, accompanied by an enumeration of its special tasks in the camp. The first part of Numbers thus takes place as it were in the shadow of Mount Sinai—that is, under the aegis of the priestly school of thinking, in which order is everything.	There is a strong military bent to the arrangement. The census of Chapter 1 is not a head count of the entire Israelite population, but rather of those “twenty years of age and upward,” those eligible to serve in the army. The setup of the camp resembles that in ancient Egypt, with the sanctuary and ark (here “Dwelling” and “coffer”) in the center (in the Egypt of Raamses II—thought by some to have been the Pharaoh of the Exodus—it was the king’s throne). The Levites, whom we have not encountered previously as a group with tasks distinct from those of the priests, emerge in this part of the book as caretakers and perhaps guardians of the sanctuary, in addition to their tasks of dismantling and transport of the “Holy-Shrine.” This military aspect reflects an ancient concept of Israel as the “forces of <p.small>Yhwh</p.small>,” surely a conquest image, which later becomes standardized in language in the phrase usually rendered “the <p.small>Lord</p.small> of Hosts.”	Some of the material in this section might well have been put elsewhere. Chapters 5–7 would have fit nicely in Leviticus; Chapter 7, the listing of the tribal gifts brought to the sanctuary upon its dedication, could even have followed <scrip2>Ex. 40</scrip>, where Moshe completes the erection of the structure. That these chapters are here therefore must be the result of a conscious decision, either to include material that did not find its way into the other books, or out of a feeling that they were appropriately placed in the book about Israel’s wanderings in the wilderness.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Mustering of Israel<content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)1</scrip>): For the opening of the book about the Israelites’ wanderings in the wilderness, the editor has chosen a logical point of departure: a tally of males prepared for war, listed by tribe. It is in fact a double list—first, the names of the tribal representatives who are to assist Moshe, and second, the count itself. The chapter is the epitome of orderliness, proceeding from the date of the census to who is to be counted, on to the counters and the census itself, and finally a treatment of the special case of the Levites (who, as noncombatants, are not mustered). It utilizes a number of repeating phrases, especially in the central census section. In this sense, the opening chapters of the book are a fitting companion to Leviticus—which likewise opens with God speaking from the Tent of Appointment, still in the Wilderness of Sinai.	The large numbers that appear here have been a major source of debate in modern as well as earlier interpretation. After all, extrapolating from 600,000 adult males (excluding the elderly), one certainly winds up with a population in the millions—a theoretically possible but extremely unlikely scenario. Some alternatives are: (a) to understand Hebrew <i>elef<style> as not “thousand,” but rather as “unit” or “division,” which would especially make sense in a military setting; and (b) to regard the numbers as simply exaggerated. One might also, following Olson, see the statistics here as an attempt to impress the audience with the size of Israel, and/or to demonstrate how God has blessed them (as in the promises to Avraham in Genesis and the account in <scrip2>Ex. 1</scrip>). There may, finally, be a “numbers game” occurring here, that is, some kind of symbolism of figures that eludes us (cf. Sarna 1986). <i><h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Layout of the Camp<content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)2</scrip>): Chap. <scrip>(Numbers)2</scrip> lays out a schematic diagram of the Israelite camp prepared for the desert march. The “Dwelling” naturally stands at the center, with four groups of three tribes each surrounding the structure on the outside, and three groupings of Levite clans guarding the inside of the rectangular sanctuary. Geographical pride of place, the eastern side, goes to the tribe of Yehuda (Judah) and two other tribes tracing their ancestry to sons of Le'a (outside track), while Moshe and Aharon and their sons occupy the inside track. <i>Levites I<style> (3): Already introduced in <scrip>(Numbers)1:47–53</scrip>, the issue of the Levites’ status and their tasks is an important subtheme in Numbers, and makes its central appearance in Chaps. <scrip>(Numbers)3</scrip> and <scrip2>4</scrip>. The present chapter opens with the genealogy of Moshe and Aharon (similarly, Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)6</scrip> of Exodus, which is a prologue to the Plague cycle, contains a genealogy of the two leaders).	Notable is the concept that the Levites symbolically replace all the firstborn sons among the Israelites. In a more manageable way, then, the entire community participates in the sacred task of ministering in the sanctuary.	Theme words in the chapter, not surprisingly, are “charge,” “count/accountable,” and “serve/serving-tasks.” Milgrom has also noted the sevenfold “by order of Y<p.small>hwh</p.small>” that permeates this chapter and the next.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Levites II<content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)4</scrip>): Here the tasks of the Levites are presented in great detail and listed according to clan. The jobs involve the guarding, dismantling, and transport of the “sancta” (holy objects). We are subsequently given a census of the Levites from ages thirty to fifty, which fits here better than in Chap. <scrip>(Numbers)1</scrip>. This age of service implies, perhaps, the physical strain associated with Levite tasks. <i>Priestly Matters; The Wife Under Suspicion<style> (5): Chaps. <scrip>(Numbers)5</scrip> and <scrip2>6</scrip> are texts that seem most appropriate in a priestly setting. In both cases, the priest plays a central role in the ceremony described, administering the test and oath to the suspected adulteress and purifying the Nazirite (Milgrom).	Here, as in several other cases in the book of Numbers, texts that one might have expected to find in Leviticus seem to have been deferred. The reasons are not difficult to fathom. Leviticus as it has been edited deals with three broad areas: the sacrificial cult, ritual pollution and purification, and holiness in communal and priestly behavior. Chaps. <scrip>(Numbers)5</scrip> and <scrip2>6</scrip> of Numbers do not easily fit into these categories, although some connections can be found. These chapters are also long, detailed cases, and it is possible that they might have deflected the central thrust of Leviticus.	Having said this, Chap. <scrip>(Numbers)5</scrip> opens, appropriately, with concern for the purity of the sacred camp that has just been described in Chap. <scrip>(Numbers)2</scrip>. It continues with an innovation (vv.5–10): some sins that were intentional can now apparently be expiated via confession and an <i>asham<style>-offering (cf. <scrip2>Lev. 5</scrip>)—unlike the situation that obtains in <scrip2>Lev. 4–5</scrip>, where it is only sins committed “in error” that are forgivable by means of the sacrificial system (with the addition of confession and restitution). This little section has been placed here perhaps because of its verbal link with the next, larger section—which addresses the issue of “breaking faith” (vv.6 and 12).	Beginning with v.11, we encounter a strange ceremony such as is found nowhere else in the Torah. Its odd aspects are not surprising, though, given the gravity of the accusation. Adultery in ancient Israel was a capital crime, while in the rest of the ancient Near East (Mesopotamia, for instance) it could sometimes be expiated through payment to the wronged husband. And significantly, it is the husband who is in total control here, and the mere “breath of suspicion” (a possible rendering of the text’s “rush of jealousy” in v.14) on his part results in a grave psychological ordeal for his wife. This is consistent with the male control over the sexuality of wives (and daughters) often observed in biblical texts (cf. Wegner 1988); there was of course no such procedure in regard to husbands. The last verse is telling; it presumes guilt on the part of the wife.	Frymer-Kensky (1984) sees the chapter as a manual for priests, and as a ritual that addresses “a crisis in the legal system”—for the crime is not provable by human agency (Milgrom points out that the word for “adultery” does not appear at all). She views the structure of the central parts of the ritual as revolving around pairs of verbs: the priest is to have the woman “stand before the presence of Y<p.small>hwh</p.small>” (vv.16–18); “swear” (vv.19, 21); and “drink” (vv.24, 27). The combination of drink, oath-taking, and declaration of innocence is found elsewhere in the ancient Near East (Fishbane 1974).	Fishbane (1980) notes how the chapter ends with two summaries (vv.29 and 30) relating back to the descriptions in vv.12–14. The phrase found at the end of the chapter, “This is the Instruction,” often concludes ritual sections in the Torah (cf. <scrip2>Lev. 11–15</scrip>), and indeed is found in <scrip>(Numbers)6:21</scrip> below; it may indicate the former existence of these laws in separate scrolls.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Nazirite <content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)6:1–21</scrip>): A “consecrated” or “separate” person, traditionally transcribed as “Nazirite” after the Hebrew <i>nazir,<style> was one who took upon himself or herself a special vow, exceeding the normal demands of the religious life. The urge to such behavior appears throughout the ages in many religious traditions, and doubtless reflects a deep-seated human desire. The motivation may stem from a joyous or tragic event, or simply from the need to serve God in what is felt to be a fuller way.	Three prohibitions characterize the Nazirite: no drinking anything made from grapes (note the Bible’s early sense that cultivation of the vine is problematic—the story of Noah’s drunkenness in <scrip2>Gen. 9:20</scrip>ff.); no shaving the hair (hair was understood by the ancients as possessing almost magical characteristics); and no contact with the dead (including relatives; death was considered the major pollutant in Israelite thinking). Given that the Nazirite’s vow has a finite period, Milgrom theorizes that our chapter represents a priestly attempt to control ascetic urges.	The ritual (vv.12ff.) that ends the Nazirite’s “state-of-consecration” involves a variety of sacrifices, most notably a <i>hattat-<style>offering (cf. <scrip2>Lev. 4</scrip>). This purification offering suggested to later interpreters that the Nazirite vow was to be viewed in at least a somewhat negative light. Certainly by Rabbinic times, formative Judaism came to look askance at undue asceticism; on the other hand, religious vows and abstentions were to survive and even flourish in medieval and later Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.	In light of the fact that a Nazirite could be either a man or a woman, the translation of this chapter uses “one” regularly instead of the text’s “he”—which in any event indicates both genders in this chapter.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Priestly Blessing<content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)6:22–27</scrip>) with which the chapter ends is striking and sufficiently beloved by Jews to have survived to this day in the synagogue liturgy. But why is it here? Perhaps the blessing of the people is yet another example of a priestly function that has not been preserved in Leviticus, since it relates neither to sacrifice nor to purification (although it should be pointed out that Moshe and Aharon give an unquoted blessing to the people in <scrip2>Lev. 9:23</scrip>).	The blessing itself makes wonderful use of ancient Hebrew rhythm, with a threefold structure of progressively longer lines that is reminiscent of a magical formula. The varied verbs give comfort and reassurance, as does the last word of the blessing: <i>shalom<style> (“well-being”). The benevolent “lifting” of God’s face is a known image in the ancient Near East (cf. the references in Fishbane 1988). Its devastating opposite, the “hiding” of his face, is found in the Psalms, and also in <scrip2>Deut. 31</scrip>.	That this section was popular already in biblical times is indicated by its occurrence in a two-part version in <scrip2>Ps. 67:2</scrip>, as well as its appearance, in various forms, on ancient Israelite amulets.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Gifts to the Sanctuary<content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)7</scrip>): Chaps. <scrip>(Numbers)7–9</scrip> constitute a threefold conclusion to the Tabernacle texts that began in <scrip2>Ex. 25</scrip>. The contribution of each chapter will be explained in sequence.	The longest chapter in the Torah in number of verses, and another one of the many lists in the book, Chap. <scrip>(Numbers)7</scrip> parallels what Levine calls “temple accounts” in the ancient Near East. These are inventory lists that were frequently written in columns. At the same time, it is a ritual text that focuses on description and not prescription, which is more usual. The chapter ends in v.89 with the first of our Tabernacle endings: a description of precisely where God would communicate with Moshe within the “Holiest Holy-Shrine.” The implication is that with the dedication of the structure, its purpose can now be fulfilled.	The length of the chapter reinforces the importance and grandeur of the ceremony, and makes of the “Dwelling” an institution in which all participate, not only priests and Levites (Levine).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Purifying the Levites<content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)8</scrip>): A parallel to <scrip2>Lev. 8–9</scrip>, where the dedication of the priests is the last act before the cult goes into operation, this chapter concludes the Levitical portions of Part I of Numbers—a distinctive contribution, as we have noted. Many scholars see the Levitical sections as reflections of later power struggles within the Israelite priesthood. In Levine’s view, this evolution (perhaps from family-based guilds into a full-fledged tribe) is an indication of a relatively late provenance for our text here.	Milgrom rightly makes the distinction between the “purification” of the Levites and the higher-level “hallowing” (i.e., sanctification) of the priests. It is also interesting to note the cultic rites used here: the offering of a <i>hattat<style> (the standard purificatory sacrifice), and mention of the Levites themselves being considered an “elevation-offering” (v.11).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Second Passover; Cloud and Dwelling<content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)9</scrip>): It has been noted by Milgrom that, a number of times in the Bible, ceremonies dedicating a House of God are followed by the observance of one of the three pilgrimage festivals: Passover, Shavuot (Weeks), and Sukkot (Huts). Under Solomon, Hezekiah, Josiah, and Ezra/Nehemiah, respectively, we find a major celebration of Sukkot, Passover, Passover, and Sukkot. This linking of sacred space with sacred time is only natural. The account here echoes the first Passover as well, which similarly inaugurated a wilderness march (Milgrom). In contrast to the Exodus account, however, something new has been added with the inauguration of the Tabernacle/ Dwelling. In Exodus (<scrip>(Numbers)12:43–49</scrip>), the major laws concerning Passover had to do with excluding non-Israelites and not breaking the bones of the sacrificial lamb; here, the bone motif returns, but the existence of the sanctuary raises the issue of ritual pollution.	The second part of the chapter (vv.15–23) parallels the ending of the book of Exodus (<scrip>(Exodus)40:36–38</scrip>), where, once the Tabernacle has been dedicated, the “Cloud” takes up residence there, to guide Israel “upon all their marches.” Our passage here is longer and rather redundant, perhaps in order to set the chronological framework of the narrative straight.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Setting Out<content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)10</scrip>): Once trumpets for signaling the march have been made, the Israelites at last begin their trek from Sinai to Canaan—nineteen days after the opening events and commandments of the book. True to the orderly character of Part I, which here draws to a close, the exact progression of the march is laid out, tribe by tribe and Levite subgroup by subgroup.	A few other brief traditions have been included here: first, a renewed mention of Moshe’s father-in-law (cf. <scrip2>Ex. 18</scrip>), who is exhorted to accompany the Israelites to Canaan. This text most likely continues the tradition recorded in the Bible of friendship between Israelites and Kenites, Hovav’s group.	The departure sequence ends, as sections in the Bible sometimes do, with a poem—in this case, the battle cry (similar to the one in <scrip2>Ps. 68:2</scrip>) associated with the coffer (vv. <scrip2>(Numbers 10:35-36)35–36</scrip>). These verses, now completely stripped of their military connotations, are universally used by Jews when Torah scrolls are taken out and put back in the synagogue ark on Sabbaths and holidays.<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b>Notes<content><style><h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>1:1<exerpt><b>	the Wilderness of Sinai:<content><style> Until the departure of the Israelites in Chap. <scrip>(Numbers)10</scrip>, they are still in the vicinity of Mount Sinai, the setting of revelation. <exerpt><b>in the second year:<content><style> Since the exodus from Egypt (<scrip2>Ex. 12</scrip>), only thirteen months have passed!

This pattern was already seen in the book of Exodus, where, despite the climactic miracle of deliverance at the Sea of Reeds, the Israelites “grumbled against Moshe” at Mara because of lack of drinkable water. Although a strain in later biblical thinking remembered the wilderness period as a kind of honeymoon (cf. <scrip2>Jer. 2:2</scrip>), the Torah itself chose to remember it as a severe time of testing which the ex-slaves ultimately failed to pass.	The second part of Numbers is a remarkable collection of rebellion narratives that simultaneously display striking similarities and great and colorful differences. The section details six rebellions of the people, and two of the leaders themselves. They are united by a consistent vocabulary: verbs such as “grumble” and “assemble/gather/speak against” depict complaints against Moshe and Aharon and against God. These stories also display the recurring themes of dearth of food and water, and God’s anger at the rebellions, usually expressed in some form of plague (or, additionally, fire).	Rather than unfold in simple chronological order, one following another, these pieces of the text have been intensified by priestly editing, which has interspersed the stories with a number of cultic and legal passages (Chaps. <scrip>(Numbers)15</scrip>, <scrip2>18</scrip>, <scrip2>19</scrip>, all of which bear the theme word “law” [Heb. <i>hok<style> or <i>hukka<style>]), and which are somehow related to previous or succeeding narratives. The interruptions also allow each of the memorable rebellion narratives to “breathe,” giving the audience time to digest the images and the drama presented therein. The stories possess both in abundant measure; one thinks, for instance, of the “meat . . . between the teeth” (<scrip>(Numbers)11:33</scrip>), of the grape clusters borne on a pole by two men (<scrip>(Numbers)13:23</scrip>); and of the great confrontation with Korah in Chapter 16 (not to mention its resolution), as well as Moshe’s dramatic failure in Chapter 20.	As in any great literature, repetition of story type or type scene is here accomplished via variation of the most telling kind. In this case we observe once again an alternating pattern to the rebellions, a pattern which reveals not one theme but several:	The people, over lack of food (chapter 11)		Moshe’s siblings, over prophetic primacy (12)	The people, over the spies’ false report (14)		Levites, over Moshe and Aharon’s prerogatives (16)	The people, over the rebellious Levites’ sinister fate (17)		Moshe himself, over the burden of leading the people (20)	The people, over the lack of food and water (21) The pattern observable here is broken, in true biblical rhetorical style (where the last in a sequence often serves by its oddness to reinforce the whole), in a final rebellion (Chap. <scrip>(Numbers)25</scrip>), where the people’s actions involve neither the “complaining” vocabulary nor a revolt against human leadership, but rather comprise the greatest biblical crime of them all: worship of other gods. Viewed in this patterned fashion, the rebellion narratives emerge with a kind of crescendo effect.	It is also possible, as I have done in “On the Book of Numbers and Its Structure,” above, to follow the scheme put forth by Mann—a three-part structure to the section, each with its internal logic and conclusions. These are treated below; for the moment, it will suffice to see in the first subsection (Chaps. <scrip>(Numbers)11–14</scrip>) the inevitable result of wilderness rebellions: the divine decree that the slave generation must die out before entering the Promised Land; the second subsection (16–20) deals with the challenges to the leadership of Moshe and Aharon, and results in a similar decree, that they will die outside the land; and the third subsection (20–25) chronicles the encounter of the Israelites with neighboring nations, which initially goes in their favor but ends with the disastrous incident at Baal Pe’or (25).	The primary issue in these stories, to the biblical writer, is lack of trust in God. Each of the three sections mentions or implies that problem; <scrip>(Numbers)14:11</scrip> and <scrip>(Numbers)20:12</scrip> use the verb itself, and the narrative of Chapter 25 suggests it. The bottom line is that the Israelites could not keep faith with God—even after both staggering acts of divine intervention (i.e., rescue) and demonstrations of the force of divine wrath—and this lack of faith led ultimately to their dying out in the wilderness outside the Promised Land, in punishment. The stories clearly were meant to be understood as an unfortunate example for later generations, and were taken as such already in the biblical period (see, for example, the treatment in <scrip2>(Ps. 78:1-72)Psalm 78</scrip>).	Read on another level, the rebellion narratives are largely concerned with the issue of human leadership, its qualifications, manifestations, and limitations (and even failures). Has there ever been a leader as beleaguered as Moshe? From the beginning of his career on the sands of Egypt, where he assumes the mantle of leadership in the matter of retaliating against the sadistic Egyptian taskmaster (<scrip2>Ex. 2:11–12</scrip>), to its end at the plains of Moab, in stern address to the people he has struggled to lead (this is the setting of the entire next book, Deuteronomy), he must evoke trust in God, lead the people through an uncharted wilderness, and inspire confidence in his own leadership. His success is muted by the passing of the generation he initially leads, before it can enter Canaan; like them, he too must pass on—with merely a look beyond the Jordan, but no more. Later generations of Jewish readers wept on confronting Moshe’s seemingly premature death, and created heroic tales of his pleading before God to be let into the land he had so long sought to reach. In Numbers he fully deserves this stature, alternately interceding with and cajoling God, standing up for and then almost giving up on this people with whom his life has become so enmeshed. Our stories stress his gifts of prophecy and his pathos as a deeply human leader.	A final, troubling issue is the character of God in this part of the book. It is a measure of the Bible’s artistry that the rebellion accounts are so varied in content and style; but the variations in punishment—from undetailed death to skin disease to stoning and the earth opening up, just to mention a few examples—create an impression, not of artistic richness but of unremitting severity. The Bible does not seem to have a problem with this kind of divine behavior, and other ancient cultures would have felt at home here, but already in late antiquity, and continuing down to our own day, Jews and Christians most often have preferred, and prayed to, a more forgiving, nurturing, and compassionate God. Dealing with these texts, in the end, raises the question of whether to understand them as the result of “historical necessity” or “literary conceit” (that is, the old generation simply had to die out) or as they stand in the text: a harsh portrayal of what happened when the covenant people violated the covenant.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>First Rebellion<content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)11<content>): The mood of the book, which up until now has been orderly and celebratory, abruptly shifts. We move from a God who commands, leaders who lead, and a people that obeys, to a bitter triangle of constant complaining, questioning of leadership, and divine punishment.	The chapter that introduces the rebellion narratives is long and complex. Although it resembles <scrip2>Ex. 16</scrip> (the manna chapter) in some general respects, it has its own distinct vocabulary and concerns. It is stylistically held together by the repeating roots “eat,” “gather,” and “weep”; the “grumbling” of the Exodus story does not yet appear. The chapter combines the people’s complaints about the manna (and a concomitant craving for meat) with Moshe’s complaints about how difficult it is to lead this people; both receive answer from God, the people in the form of quails and Moshe through the dissemination of prophetic gifts to others in the camp.	It is in this chapter that Moshe—the dramatic and at times tragic Moshe of the Golden Calf story in Exodus—reappears as a character with deep emotions. Although his fate as a leader destined never to enter the Promised Land is not sealed until Chap. <scrip>(Numbers)20</scrip>, one has the sense already here that the strain of his mission is beginning to tell. The vividness of the portrayal of Moshe is matched by that of the Children of Israel, whose words, usually complaints, include the picturesque description of Egyptian cuisine in v.5.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Sibling Rebellion<content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)12<content>): A challenge to Moshe’s leadership, which we had encountered both in Exodus and in the previous chapter, now comes from an unexpected source—Aharon and Miryam. Their complaint begins with some kind of objection to Moshe’s wife, but its core is quickly revealed in v.2: Does not God speak through them as well as through their stuttering brother? Milgrom speculates that it is the spreading of prophetic gifts in the previous chapter that gives them the idea. God’s response is to clarify Moshe’s uniqueness, and to punish Miryam—yet Aharon gets off easily here, possibly owing to a later editor who was highly sympathetic to the priesthood descended from Aharon, or because the latter, as High Priest, could not be tainted by <i>tzaraat<style> without damaging his priesthood, as <scrip2>Lev. 22:4</scrip>ff. suggests (Sakenfeld).	Chap. <scrip>(Numbers)12</scrip> is linked to the previous chapter by use of the words “eat” and “gather.” As its own unit, it is built on the ironic use of Heb. <i>dabber be-,<style> which can mean either “speak through” or “speak against.”<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Spies in Canaan and Back<content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)13<content>): Here, as at the beginning of the book, we begin with a list—this time, of the men Moshe sends out to reconnoiter the land of Canaan. Order may also be perceived in the phraseology of Moshe’s questions to them (vv.18–20), and the mission goes well (witness the giant grape cluster in v.23). But everything falls apart in the middle of the report (vv.28ff.), and the ending of the chapter, in which the spies compare themselves (and, by extension, all the Israelites) to grasshoppers vis-à-vis the Canaanite natives of the land, is telling. It is a classic case of failure of nerve.	Scholars have detected a number of creative hands in this and the next chapter, based on the text’s alternating use of Calev and Calev/Yehoshua as the faithful spies, as well as other factors. The final result is a tug of war between sets of spies, the people, Moshe, and God. True to the new human tone of the narrative, so mundane a form as a reconnaissance mission has been here suffused with emotion, a trend that will continue throughout this part of the book.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Rebellion and Evil Decree<content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)14<content>): Another long and dramatic account, this chapter contains echoes of previous narratives. The “grumbling” of <scrip2>Ex. 16</scrip> finally returns, and God and Moshe talk to one another in a manner that recalls the Golden Calf incident of <scrip2>Ex. 32–34</scrip>. God wishes to destroy the people and start all over again with Moshe; the prophet, for his part, reminds God of his essentially merciful nature, and basically blackmails him by pointing out what will happen to his reputation among the nations should he destroy the Israelites. Unlike the resolution in Exodus, this time the people—at least the older generation—are doomed to die out. After two years of both miraculous rescues and despair, it has become clear that the former slaves will not be able to accomplish the work of conquest—even with divine help. That is to be left to their children, whom Moshe will address in Deuteronomy.	V.26 begins a section that seems to double the earlier part of the chapter. Perhaps it stems from a separate tradition concerning the incident. It leads to the people’s disastrous attempt to force the issue by invading Canaan without the Coffer and Moshe (hence, without God). Thus the spy story of 13–14, which began in orderly fashion, ends in disarray, with a crushing defeat.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Interlude<content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)15<content>): Chap. <scrip>(Numbers)15<content>, which gives respite from the striking rebellion narratives of 11–14, and a breather before the Korah story in 16–17 (although Wenham notes verbal ties to 13–14, and Buber 1988 to 16–18), brings together five rather disparate pieces of material that seem wrenched out of other contexts. We can, however, make some sense of them. Vv.1–16 (on various sacrifices) and 17–21 (about a “contribution” for God) are commanded for the time “when you enter the land of your settling / that I am giving you” or “when you enter the land / that I am bringing you to,” connecting them to the potential entry into Canaan of the two previous chapters and thus providing a setting that is missing in most of Leviticus. Further, vv.1–16 and 22–31, which, like <scrip2>Lev. 4</scrip>, deal with the unintentional sins of the Israelites, both make pointed reference to the “sojourner,” the resident alien who is to be treated in respect of the laws involved here exactly like a native. The final section, on the tassels (Heb. <i>tzitzit<style>), is interestingly connected to the spy narrative via the term “scout around” in v.39 (Milgrom); “scout” had occurred seven times in the earlier story. “Bear in mind” also recalls the many instances of “reminders” in the Torah—objects such as a portion of manna—that serve as a visual warning or memorial for the Israelites of later generations. This is especially important after the Israelites’ losing heart in Chaps. <scrip>(Numbers)13–14</scrip>. Stylistically, the four sections just mentioned are drawn together by the use of the phrase “throughout your generations” (vv.15, 21, 23, 38).	This leaves the incident of the Sabbath violator in vv.32–36. It has clearly been placed in Numbers because it takes place “in the wilderness” (v.32); it has found its way into this specific chapter perhaps because it is, in its own way, a miniature rebellion story. Since it is so brief, it may well have been felt that it needed to be placed in a chapter already composed of short pieces. Stylistically it might have better appeared at the end of the chapter, but that position has been reserved for the rhetorically more dramatic section on the tassels.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Great Revolt<content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)16<content>): In the two collections of wilderness rebellion traditions we have encountered thus far in the Torah, <scrip2>Ex. 15:22–17:7</scrip> and <scrip2>Num. 11–14</scrip>, the rebels are a faceless “the people” or “the entire community.” An exception was <scrip2>Num. 12</scrip>, where Aharon and Miryam complained against their brother; their personal example is now taken up by another relative, in a memorable narrative. The story of the revolt of Korah the Levite and Datan and Aviram the Reubenites, which may have stemmed from two different accounts, holds the common thread of the rebels’ feeling left out—Korah, as Moshe’s and Aharon’s first cousin, might well have headed the priestly line (his father was older than theirs), whereas Datan and Aviram’s tribe of Re’uven had lost some of its firstborn primacy, and was not even camped on the choice east side of the Dwelling. Moshe clearly sees the political motivation behind the revolt, and is indignant that anyone would impute greed (cf. v.15) or lust for power to him.	As Buber (1988) points out, however, more is at stake here. The rebels’ contention that “the entire community, the entirety of them, are holy,” though it sounds at first blush like the ideal expressed in <scrip2>Ex. 19:6</scrip> (God’s offer to make of the Israelites “a kingdom of priests, / a holy nation”), is in reality a most dangerous claim. Holiness in the Bible is a trait that can be acquired, even transmitted to an extent, but it is not absolutely innate, except in the case of God; and the Torah sees as one of its major goals developing the means whereby people can, with holy intent and preparation, properly serve the Holy. The fate of the rebels therefore bespeaks the seriousness of the threat they pose, and is unique in the Bible.	The narrative hinges on a number of expressions. The conflict between Moshe and the rebels is nicely encapsulated by two pairs of identical charges and countercharges—“Too much [is] yours” (vv.3 and 7) and “Is it too little” (vv.9 and 13). The terms “community” and “assembly” are played upon, designating alternately the body of the people and the minicommunity of the rebels. More significantly, this chapter and those around it—15, 17, and 18—are meaningfully linked together by variations on the Hebrew root <i>k-r-b<style> (Buber 1994). The thread of meaning runs from “bringing near-offerings near,” to God “declaring [Moshe and Ahron] near” to him, to the fact that he has “brought near” the Levites in terms of their duties, to Korah and his band being asked to “bring near” the incense, whose fire-pans later become holy because they were “brought near,” and finally, to the repeated warning to outsiders not to “come near” the sancta. At issue is what Buber calls “authorized” and “unauthorized nearing,” which is mentioned frequently in Leviticus but is used in the present text with the full artistic resources at the narrator’s command. Viewed in this light, order is restored to the blurring of lines threatened by Korah.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Aftermath<content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)17<content>): The revolt of Korah, with its macabre ending, has made it clear that Levites must not “come-near” the priestly domains, physically or professionally. Accordingly, the incense pans of the dead rebels become plating for the altar, as a warning for the future. The “fire-pan” becomes instrumental immediately thereafter, as Aharon must obtain forgiveness for the people, who understand the deaths of Korah and his followers as a political purge by the two brothers. Aharon’s action, it should be noted, cannot prevent the initial round of deaths by divine plague.	Upon hearing the “grumbling” of the Israelites (a word that did not, interestingly, appear in the Korah story), God now deems it necessary to provide another sign: proof that it is the Sons of Aharon that he has chosen (cf. <scrip>(Numbers)16:5</scrip>)—as if the earth opening up were not enough! This is Aharon’s flowering rod, a stick that, though long-severed from its original tree, still manages to produce flowers and fruit. The motif is noted in many other cultures (cf. Gaster 1969 for references); Wagner made use of it to provide the climactic moment in his opera <i>Tannhäuser.<style><h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Levite Rules<content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)18<content>): In order to more strictly enforce the separate roles of priest and Levite, necessitated by the rebellion of Korah, the text turns to clarification of the Levites’ duties and regulations concerning them. They are to act as a buffer between the sancta and the people, but may not come into contact with the holy-things themselves; the priests, of course, may and must. The priests’ reward— actually, their means of support—consists of firstborn animals and firstfruits; the Levites’, of tithes.	The chief refrain in the chapter is variations on “so that they may not die”; this has occurred already in <scrip>(Numbers)17:25</scrip>, thus linking Chaps. <scrip>(Numbers)17</scrip> and <scrip2>18</scrip> nicely.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Death and the Red Cow<content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)19<content>): Apparently to close out the Korah story, the text turns to a mysterious and powerful ritual, one designed to remove the contaminating pollution of death. It is important to note that the revolt in Chap. <scrip>(Numbers)16</scrip> led, not only to the deaths of the rebels and their households, but also to the perishing of 14,700 people in the subsequent plague (<scrip>(Numbers)17:12–14</scrip>). So despite the fact that priests and Levites now have their tasks straight, thanks to Chap. <scrip>(Numbers)18</scrip>, there remains the serious matter of purification.	Levine notes the typical priestly pattern at work: first the remedy is prescribed, and then the actual circumstances that call for it are enumerated. He also sees the chapter as essentially a protest against the widespread cult of the dead in the ancient Near East, from which the Israelites notably separated themselves.	Milgrom has illuminated a number of aspects of the Red Cow ritual, notably by characterizing it as a sort of <i>hattat<style> ceremony. That ritual, it may be recalled, enabled the priests to decontaminate the sanctuary of ritual pollution, chiefly through the sprinkling of blood against the altar. Milgrom points to the unusual nature of the ritual here, in that the purifying agent (in this case, water that has been mixed with the special cow’s ashes, which came partly from burned blood) is sprinkled on persons, not objects.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Rebellion and the Failure of Leadership; The Edomites<content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)20<content>): The first part of this chapter contains a story that has deeply troubled readers for over two millennia. Its length belies its weight; in only thirteen verses, Moshe and Aharon have lost their most cherished dream—the privilege of entering the Promised Land.	The brevity here may result from the fact that, for the narrator, this story was a variant of, or constructed from, a similar one in <scrip2>Ex. 17</scrip>, to explain more fully why the leaders shared the fate of their generation. In other words, their deaths may affect us more than the text meant it to. Nonetheless, the question of why exactly Moshe and Aharon received such a terrible punishment for a moment of indiscretion will not go away. Can it really be that the towering figure of Moshe, liberator and lawgiver, parent and prophet, is to be done away with in the blink of an eye, over a fit of justifiable temper? But it is a public moment, and there the answer may lie. The Bible consistently takes a stringent view of leadership: that leaders must be above reproach, and that they must not lose sight of the fact that it is God whom they represent. A similar impulse led to the strict standards to which the writer of Samuel-Kings, the so-called Deuteronomistic historian, held such revered personalities as David and Solomon.	From v.14 to v.21, the text gives us a moment to digest what has just happened, at the same time managing to introduce the major theme of the next several chapters: encountering other peoples and tribes as the Israelites near Canaan. First is Edom, in the territory to the east roughly between Eilat and the Dead Sea. The sequence begins tentatively, not with an Israelite victory, but not with a defeat either: they are forced to reroute their approach.	So as to keep the memory of Merivat-Kadesh close, the chapter ends with the death of Aharon, “before the eyes of the entire community” (v.27). For the first time in all the rebellion texts, the word “rebel” itself is used (v.24). On a positive note, leadership is seamlessly passed to the next generation; when Moshe returns from witnessing Aharon’s death, he is accompanied by the latter’s son El’azar, who is tellingly dressed in Aharon’s garments.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>First Victory: Rebellion Again; Traveling; Sihon and Og<content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)21<content>): A miscellany of wilderness traditions, Chap. <scrip>(Numbers)21</scrip> begins with a military victory—perhaps a sign that Israel’s terrible trials are coming to an end. Not insignificantly, the victory comes after the Israelites have properly vowed to allot booty to God (v.2), a far cry from their willful attempt at conquest at the end of Chap. <scrip>(Numbers)14</scrip>. This brief account may in fact be a reworking or different account of the Horma incident in that passage.	The strange events surrounding the “viper of copper” that follow provide a reminder, even amid the progress of the march and military successes, of the Israelites’ usual waywardness. As usual, the problem is food; several things, however, make this brief story unusual amid the rebellion narratives. For one, the punishment is unique; for another, the people call upon Moshe to remove the plague—in a manner that is more reminiscent of Pharaoh of Egypt, with the Plagues, than of previous Israelite behavior. Finally, there is the Bible’s record of what happened to the copper object: it was preserved in the cult and worshiped by the people, until it was smashed during the large-scale religious reform under King Hezekiah of Judah (late eighth century <p.small>b.c.e.</p.small>). One might note that the divine punishment for sin, once accomplished, clears the way for the Israelite victories that follow immediately.	Of additional interest in this chapter is the inclusion of three ancient poems (vv. 14-15, 17-18, and 27-30), whose origins and language are both obscure. Preceded by a brief itinerary of the Israelites’ travels up to Moabite territory, soon to be the scene of the Bil’am narratives (Chaps. <scrip>(Numbers)22–24</scrip>), the chapter ends with two successful clashes against local kings, Sihon and Og. While the accounts here are brief, postbiblical Jewish tradition took delight in spinning fantastic tales about these two kings (cf. Ginzberg).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Hiring of Bil’am<content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)22<content>): Faced with overwhelming evidence of Israelite superiority, especially as evinced in the previous chapter, the Moabite king Balak tries to vanquish the invaders via a means more powerful than force of arms: a sorcerer’s curse. The first part of the story is memorable in its vivid characterization, use of theme words, and comic thrust. The central personalities have suggestive names: Balak sounds like a verb that means “to destroy,” Bil’am suggests “swallower” (hence destroyer), and Be’or, present only as the name of the sorcerer’s father, also connotes “destroying.” The text uses two different words for “curse,” soon to be joined by a third. The chapter introduces key themes of the story: “honor,” which Bil’am will refuse in the overwhelming face of God’s truth; “once again,” through which it becomes clear that, for God, “once [refusal of permission for Bil’am to go] is once-and-for-all,” and God’s blessing, once given, will not be rescinded (Rosenzweig 1994); and the emphatic refrain that, as noted above, in one form or another will echo throughout the story, “whatever God tells me, that (alone) must I speak/do.” Most memorable, of course, is the sequence about the talking donkey, which must have been more than a little amusing to ancient audiences. For here we have a dumb animal who sees divine messengers and possesses the divine gift of speech, contrasting with a prophet—who in Israelite thinking was supposed to be distinguished by his abilities as “seer” and mouthpiece of God—who sees nothing and raises his voice only to complain. <i>Bil’am’s First Visions<style> (23): Having been granted permission to hire himself out to Balak, but with the caveat that he may speak only God’s word, Bil’am prepares to curse Israel. But his “encounters” with God leave not the slightest doubt of the outcome; curse is turned to blessing, despite all the correct ritual preparations and previous promises of payment for services rendered. One almost has the impression of a seance gone wrong. And, professionally speaking, hired prophets are supposed to tell kings what they want to hear.	The poetry in this chapter is powerful and striking. We move from the hopeful king’s lofty “mountains of Kedem,” whence Bil’am was hired, to the disturbing image of the king of beasts feasting on his prey. What began as an attack from above has ended in a blood-feast by the enemy.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Bil’am the Prophet<content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)24<content>): Few moments in the Torah, to my thinking, can compare with what now happens in this story. The description of Bil’am’s transformation in the opening verses is matched and even surpassed by what happens to the poetry of this section. From v.3 on, we are treated to an elevation and intensification of poetic language, beginning with the rhythmic opening lines and continuing through the pregnant Middle Eastern imagery of trees and water.	With the suggestion of the blessing given to Avraham in v.9, and with Bil’am’s vision of the future political triumphs of Israel vis-à-vis the surrounding nations, all that Balak can do is to go “on his way” (v.25). The king who is used to paying for what he wants, and to having enemies cursed, has no recourse left to him.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Final Rebellion: Apostasy<content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)25<content>): A tale ostensibly meant to establish the permanent status of the Aaronide priesthood, this chapter has another important structural function. As the last section of Part II (at least as I have laid out the book’s structure), it prevents the wilderness traditions from ending on an up note. The Bil’am cycle with its exalted poetry would have made a positive conclusion, but the editor does not wish us to forget the basic facts of Israel’s wilderness experience:dissatisfaction, complaint, and rebellion. Here we end with the ultimate rebellion, the moment of serious unfaithfulness in the “marriage” between God and Israel.	Like his grandfather Aharon in Chap. <scrip>(Numbers)17</scrip>, Pin’has is able to stay the plague from God, albeit not through peaceful means. His action here recalls the killing spree of the Levites at the Golden Calf incident, another major apostasy (Wenham). The text goes out of its way to name also specific offenders; the Moabite woman who is remembered for evil is, in fact, the daughter of a chieftain.	The horrifying details of Pin’has’s act remind the reader once again that, for the biblical writers, idolatry was the worst of all crimes. The books to follow, starting with Deuteronomy, will make this abundantly clear.<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b>Notes<content><style><h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>11:4<exerpt><b>	gathered-riffraff:<content><style> Heb. <i>asafsuf,<style> from the verb that means “to gather.” Perhaps parallel to the ragtag “mixed multitude” (<i>erev rav<style>) of <scrip2>Ex. 12:38</scrip>.

It is concerned, then, with the transfer of leadership from Moshe to Yehoshua (Joshua); with provisions for two and a half tribes to remain on the east bank of the Jordan River, as long as they take part in the impending invasion; with listing the entire route of the Israelites, from Egypt to the plains of Moab; and with the borders of the land to be conquered.	As has been the case earlier in the book, however, other material intervenes: a theme and variation doublet on the inheritance of land in a case where a man leaves daughters, not sons; two chapters on what sacrifices are to be brought on holy days; a section on vows taken by women; war with Midyan and the precise apportioning of spoils, both to warriors and to the sanctuary; and the law regarding accidental homicide, in which family vengeance is circumvented by the existence of “safe” Levite towns to which the manslayer may flee.	The inconsistent thematics may again be explained by the intrusion of an editorial hand, again by priestly interests. In Levine’s view, most of Chapters 25–36 function to establish matters of importance in the priestly view, just as in Chapters 1–10. Here law takes precedence over narrative.	Despite the varied subject matter of this section, it holds together structurally, via the common biblical technique of word (sound) repetition. The rather common verb <i>tzivvah,<style> “command,” weaves through every one of Chapters 26–36, except for 33. Sometimes it introduces what God wants the Israelites to do; sometimes it leads to the formula of fulfillment, “as YHWH commanded the Children of Israel, so they did”; still other times it refers to a command given by Moshe himself. The entire section begins with the verb (<scrip>(Numbers)26:4</scrip>), and ends with it as well (<scrip>(Numbers)36:13</scrip>). In addition, the chapters most far afield, 28–29 (taken as a unit) and 30, begin and end with it. Whether this was a conscious technique by redactors is hard to say, but its existence is striking.	Another structural device, that of framing, also occurs in this part of the book: after the introductory census (Chap. <scrip>(Numbers)26</scrip>), the rest is built between two brackets, each involving the daughters of Tzelofhad, and each opening with the verb “to come near” (<scrip>(Numbers)27:1</scrip> and <scrip>(Numbers)36:1</scrip>). So despite the wide-ranging material, some sense of unity has been imposed upon it.	Finally, there is the key occurrence, for the book of Numbers, of more lists, from census to holiday sacrifices, from stops along the journey to the precise borders of the Promised Land. We are in the presence of order once again.	What remains lacking at the end of the book is exactly what Deuteronomy supplies: a final exhortation from Moshe, which includes reiteration and further clarification of the laws, a public covenant ceremony, Moshe’s long blessing of the people, and the account of his death and burial. If added here, these topics might have tipped the scales of Numbers, which has given us almost too much to digest as it is; as the Torah has come down to us, they are more appropriately treated in the expansive and majestic rhetorical setting of Deuteronomy.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>New Census<content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)26</scrip>): Out of the chaos of the wilderness, the element of order is reintroduced as we meet the new generation—which will conquer at least part of the land of Canaan. These children of slaves are now mustered, in the same tribal order as the census in Chap. <scrip>(Numbers)1</scrip>. The purpose of the counting is set forth in vv.52–56: so that the Promised Land may be properly divided up, according to population. True to the scheme of Chap. <scrip>(Numbers)1</scrip>, the Levites go through their own census (vv.57–62)—since they receive designated towns but not a large mass of land. The ending verses assure us that the census in this chapter does not include anyone of the Exodus generation, excluding Calev and Yehoshua. Thus we are on new ground. <i>A Case of Inheritance: Daughters of Tzelofhad I; The Passing of Leadership<style> (27): If the land is to be apportioned by tribe, the question of inheritance becomes a major one for the future. In that vein, the text, in almost Talmudic fashion, brings a case with some difficulties: What if a father dies without sons but does leave daughters—may they inherit the ancestral land, given the context of a patriarchal society? Moshe is unable to solve the problem, but must leave it up to God, who rules that not only daughters but other relations as well may serve to keep the land in the family (an attendant question, how to keep land within a tribe’s territory, will be answered in Chap. <scrip>(Numbers)36</scrip>). This section of the chapter is a good example of a law embedded in a narrative, or a narrative created for the sake of a law. It also has the effect of showing that the divine promise of land is about to be fulfilled, that all tribes must be included in the process, and that the growing biblical tradition allows for reinterpretation (Olson).	From v.12 on, we are reminded that Moshe is about to die. In an expansive speech (vv.18–21), God designates Yehoshua as Moshe’s successor, and publicly the aging leader transfers authority to him. Given the structure of Part III of the book, which is bracketed by daughters of Tzelofhad sections, we might expect Moshe’s death to parallel the passage here, and thus come at the end of Chap. <scrip>(Numbers)36</scrip>. But that will not be the case; his death is left for the end of the entire Torah, in Deuteronomy.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Festival Offerings<content><style> (28–29): With Chaps. <scrip>(Numbers)28–30</scrip> we return to a recurring phenomenon in the book of Numbers: the intrusion of priestly material. We would expect 28 and 29, which form a logical unit and enumerate the sacrifices brought on holy days, to be properly placed in Leviticus. In fact, <scrip2>Lev. 23</scrip> does set out a sacred calendar. The purpose of that passage, however, was to indicate the overlay of the holy on the cycle of the year; the material here neither creates the calendar itself nor has anything to do with either voluntary offerings or those brought for expiation of sin. It may have been inserted at this point, in this book, because in its drawn-out, formulaic rhetoric, it has the character of a list such as we often find in Numbers. Part III of the book is a logical setting for it, given that it concentrates on the “pilgrimage-festivals” that fit a settled, agricultural context, and these chapters deal with various issues arising from Israel’s imminent possession of the land.	Interesting is the addition of the New Moon festival (vv.11ff.), not mentioned in <scrip2>Lev. 23</scrip>. It was apparently a serious holy day, although the Bible does not forbid work on it. The New Moon fits in the general layout of the chapter, which is, first, according to frequency of sacrifice and then to calendar (Milgrom).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Vows and Women<content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)30</scrip>): Taking its verbal cue from <scrip>(Numbers)29:39</scrip>, this chapter focuses on the binding nature of vows, especially as regards women, whose legal status was typically bound up with that of their fathers or husbands (unless they were widows or otherwise adult and single; cf. Wegner 1988). In this respect it continues the priestly concern with women, who do not always fit the priestly categories as neatly as that class might have wished. The length of the chapter signals the importance, or rather the sacredness, of an oath in ancient Israel; it stood as uttered unless an annulment procedure was followed. Human words, and not only divine ones, were seen as having effects in the real world.	The chapter is built around repeating words, such as “vow,” “bind,” “establish,” “annul,” and “silent.”<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>War against Midyan<content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)31</scrip>): We return to preconquest war traditions, such as we encountered in Chap. <scrip>(Numbers)21</scrip>. It is as if God permits Moshe a taste of conquest before he is to be “gathered to [his] kinspeople” (v.2). And it is unfinished business that he takes up here, since the Midyanites had been identified as the ones who lured the Israelites to sin at Baal Pe’or (<scrip>(Numbers)25:16–18</scrip>). Also notable in this long chapter is the detailed account of dividing the spoils (vv.25–54); this is both characteristic of Numbers, as a list, and an indication of an important issue that will need attention once the conquest proper proceeds. It also may be an indication of a later tradition; Levine sees in the allotment of spoils for sanctuary income a characteristic royal policy.	The cruel aspect of this war, while not unusual by ancient standards, feels jarring to modern Jewish and Christian readers, who perhaps expect the Bible to be more peace-oriented. It is not, although it often “seeks peace,” and there are passages (e.g., <scrip2>Deut. 20</scrip> and <scrip>(Numbers)21:10–14</scrip>) where an attempt is made to mute some of the harsh realities of ancient warfare.	Niditch has pointed out that this chapter presents an ideology of war slightly different from some other biblical accounts. The term “devote [to destruction]” is not used; virgin girls, who are not yet of the status of “the enemy,” are spared; and war is seen as a ritually defiling activity, i.e., contact with death. In other words, the text exhibits some ambiguity about war, which must then be dealt with via purifying rituals.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Two and a Half Tribes<content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)32</scrip>): Although most biblical traditions place the Promised Land west of the Jordan River, Numbers includes an unusual request by the tribes of Reu’ven, Gad, and half of the tribe of Menashe: Since they are shepherds, and have heard of the fertile grazing area east of the river, they wish to remain on the east bank. Moshe accedes to their wish, provided that they assist their fellow Israelites in conquering Canaan proper. The historical result of this settlement—which gives us a taste of settlement before the larger conquest in the book of Joshua—seems to have been a checkered one, with Moabites and Ammonites reclaiming land at various subsequent periods.	Milgrom has demonstrated how the chapter is built by a select vocabulary of words repeated seven times; the whole may be summarized by the composite statement “If Gad and Reuben cross over as vanguard [Heb. <i>h-l-tz;<style> see below) before Y<p.small>hwh</p.small>, they will receive the land holdings (they desire).” The sevenfold “before Y<p.small>hwh</p.small>” of the chapter drums in the participation of the divine in the conquest (Milgrom also brings up the possibility that it suggests the Coffer’s presence at the battle).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Wilderness Marches<content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)33</scrip>): Another list in the book of Numbers traces the full journey of the Israelites from Egypt—as the Egyptians are still burying their firstborn dead!—to a spot opposite Jericho by the Jordan. It would of course be ideal if we could map out the route, but the location of most of the places mentioned in the chapter has been lost over time. We are left with the rhythm of the place-names rather than a viable historical record.	Vv.50ff. introduce a new note, appropriate in view of the preconquest situation. Before Moshe lays out the future borders of Israelite Canaan in the next chapter, he must warn his charges about the dangers of leaving the conquered peoples (and their religious culture) settled in the land. This concern is typical of Deuteronomy, and figures in later history (cf. <scrip2>Judg. 1</scrip>), where the apparent failure to do what is demanded here is understood as having led to idol-worship in Israel.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Parceling Out the Land<content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)34</scrip>): Again appropriate in the context, the postconquest borders of the Promised Land are laid out here. Milgrom, following Mazar, characterizes these boundaries as matching no historically verifiable Israelite territories, but rather the map of Canaan as an Egyptian province before the conquest. Be that as it may, the chapter ends with a list of representatives who will parcel out the land—another one of Numbers’s leadership lists.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Levitical Towns of Asylum<content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)35</scrip>): As a kind of appendix to the previous chapter, and for a last mention of the Levites in Numbers, we are given what the Torah regards as an important innovation: the institution of the Towns of Asylum (or Refuge), whereby an accidental manslayer could avoid the expected blood vengeance of the dead person’s family. Greenberg (1959) has claimed that the specified towns probably were a substitute for what in other ancient Near Eastern societies was banishment; in his view, the idea of internal banishment presented here affirms the high and nonnegotiable value put on human life in the Bible—even when it is ended by accident. Be that as it may, the law in this chapter puts a brake on a reality of ancient life.	It is likely that the towns in question were previously sacred Canaanite towns, and Frick has raised the interesting possibility that from that special character or status may have evolved the concept of citywide asylum (and not just at the altar, a temporary measure).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>A Case of Inheritance: Daughters of Tzelofhad II<content><style> (<scrip1>(Numbers)36</scrip>): To round out both Part III and the entire book, the text returns to issues of inheritance, brought up first in Chap. <scrip>(Numbers)27</scrip>. The decision rendered here (that the daughters of Tzelofhad may inherit their father’s holdings, but that they must agree to marry within their tribe) ties the final loose end relating to the land, and so we are able to leave the wilderness narratives and laws with a sense that the future in the Promised Land is both assured and orderly. All that remains is for Moshe to die—but first he has a series of speeches to deliver to his charges of half a lifetime. These will be introduced by the opening verse of the next book, “These are the words/speeches . . . .”	Fishbane (1988) terms this chapter a “responsum,” that is, an authoritative answer to a legal question, and notes how the original intent of the law in Chap. <scrip>(Numbers)27</scrip>—to allow women to inherit property in certain circumstances—has been “subverted” by the ruling here. That is, male relatives ultimately inherit the land, as though there were no daughters! Thus the process of “inner-biblical interpretation,” whereby already in the Bible itself passages are subject to later scrutiny and recasting, makes its appearance; it will be exemplified by much of the material in the next book, Deuteronomy.<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b>Notes<content><style><h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>26:3<exerpt><b>	spoke:<content><style> Or “gave instructions” (JPS, following Ehrlich).<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>9<exerpt><b>	struggled:<content><style> A rather physical verb, especially as applied to God on the next line!<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>11<exerpt><b>	the sons of Korah did not die:<content><style> This despite the statement in <scrip>(Numbers)16:32</scrip> that the earth swallowed up Korah “and all his household.” The “Sons of Korah” were later renowned for their prowess as Temple singers, and fully eleven Psalms bear a superscription with their name.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>17<exerpt><b>	Arod:<content><style> Ancient versions, following <scrip2>Gen. 46:16</scrip>, read “Arodi.”<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>19<exerpt><b>	Er and Onan died:<content><style> Because they did not carry on their late brother’s line by fathering a son with his widow; cf. <scrip2>Gen. 38:6–10</scrip>.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>54<exerpt><b>	many . . . give-much . . . few . . . give-little:<content><style> That is, apportioned by population.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>55<exerpt><b>	However, by lot:<content><style> To determine each holding’s location (Milgrom, following Abravanel).<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>59<exerpt><b>	who bore her:<content><style> The Hebrew is awkward, because the mother’s name apparently has been omitted.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>27:1<exerpt><b>	came near:<content><style> Here with the connotation of “came before the authorities.” <exerpt><b>Mahla . . .:<content><style> Several of these names are the names of known towns.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>3<exerpt><b>	for his own sin:<content><style> As distinct from the sin of taking part in the Korah rebellion.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>4<exerpt><b>	holding:<content><style> An ancestral plot of land.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>12<exerpt><b>	Avarim/The-Region-Across:<content><style> The mountains beyond the Jordan to the east.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>15<exerpt><b>	Then Moshe spoke to <p.small>Yhwh<p.small>, saying:<content></p.small> A reversal of the usual formula in which, typically, God commands Moshe to proclaim a new law.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>17<exerpt><b>	go out . . . come back:<content><style> These verbs are often used to indicate military leadership. <exerpt><b>shepherd:<content><style> A central ancient Near Eastern metaphor for leadership, alternatively applied to Moshe, David, and later to Jesus.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>19<exerpt><b>	commission:<content><style> The same verb normally rendered “command.”<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>20<exerpt><b>	majesty:<content><style> JPS “authority.” <exerpt><b>hearken:<content><style> That is, obey.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>21<exerpt><bi>	Urim:<content><style> Some kind of oracular object (usually called <i>Urim<style> and <i>Tummim<style>) used to predict the future.
