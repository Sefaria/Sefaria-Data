Up to this point, through the first four books, we have encountered a powerful mixture of literary genres; indeed, the books owe their characteristic stamp to the way in which they incorporate these genres. Genesis is predominantly narrative, punctuated by genealogies; Exodus begins with narrative and later proceeds with covenant-making and law, and then with the precise details of sanctuary building; Leviticus is composed almost entirely of cultic and then ethical and social law; and finally, Numbers alternates narrative and varied laws, under the structure of preparations for wilderness march, first encounters with the Promised Land, and preparations for entry. Except for Leviticus, the books also exhibit, at strategic points, striking examples of biblical poetry.	An ancient name for Deuteronomy, <i>mishne tora<style>—which means “copy of the Torah,” but which was erroneously understood as “second Torah”—would seem to indicate more of the same combining of genres, and a not-too-close reading would support the idea of a rehashing of narrative, covenant-making, law, and poetry. But the reader who takes the time to weigh what stands before him or her will find much more. In its structure, style, content, and intent, Deuteronomy goes beyond what has preceded it. The image of Moshe addressing the assembled people on the Plains of Moab—the central setting of the book—provides the occasion for not merely a retelling, but a recasting of Israel’s mission and destiny. No book of the Torah is truer to the idea of “instruction” (Deuteronomy uses the term numerous times), including an emphasis on teaching and learning, with assembled and yet-to-be-born children as much the audience as “elders.”	From the book’s opening phrase, “Now these are the words [or even “speeches”] that Moshe spoke to the Children of Israel / in [the country] across the Jordan,” the basic premise of Deuteronomy is that the aged Moshe, personally and indeed in the first person, speaks for the last time to the assembled Israelites, before their triumphant entry into the land of Canaan. The setting affects the entire content of the book; no longer is the narrator in the background, as in most of the Torah, but instead he is presented as directly addressing a living audience, an audience composed not only of the ancient hearers portrayed in the text but also of contemporary listeners.	The image of a leader delivering a long public address on an auspicious occasion is well known from the ancient world, most familiarly from Greek historians (cf. Van Seters) but also abundantly in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld). The historian seeks to paint a vivid picture of the personality of his speaker and the high drama of the moment, and may go on at great length. While admitting to not having had the benefit of eyewitness sources, such chroniclers are nevertheless sincere in their desire to present what undoubtedly would have been said on such an occasion.	Deuteronomy, whenever it was composed and placed in the Torah, takes this approach a step further. It is a fantastic conceit, really: as Rosenberg (1975) notes, Moshe, the man who was “not a man of words” (<scrip2>Ex. 4:10</scrip>), all of a sudden finds his voice. And as Polzin (1980) has shown in his forceful analysis, in Deuteronomy Moshe’s voice functions fairly indistinguishably from God’s own—and then closes off the text by stipulating that nothing in the future is to be added or subtracted to it. So we are dealing with a text of directly authoritative character, a series of speeches that in their own self-understanding already bore the status of “Torah.” Hence Deuteronomy introduces into the Bible for the first time the concept of canon—a bounded, accepted body of authoritative literature.	Moshe’s addresses, which include a historical review, repeated appeals to observe God’s laws and dire warnings against their violation, a reworking of previous laws and the addition of new ones, and a poem designed to keep the appeals and warnings in popular memory, have about them a deep rhetorical urgency. As such they are stylistically quite different from most of what is found in the first four books of the Bible. To be sure, there are many moments of high rhetoric in the previous narratives, and the laws—including cultic ones—are also not lacking appeals to the emotions (cf., for instance, the repeated injunctions to not oppress the sojourner, “for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). But as an extended piece of argumentation and pleading, Deuteronomy holds pride of place in the Torah, with its specialized vocabulary (described in the notes and commentary below), its alternately pleading and warning tone, and its long, elegant phrases (as Gottwald notes, these phrases are most often cast in the form of subordinate clauses, not the typical syntactical form found in the previous books).	But not only does Deuteronomy provide an emotional capstone to the four books that precede it. It functions to link up with both the landed history of Israel in the narrative books to follow (Joshua through Kings) and the prophets’ emotional speeches to the people and their leaders. In the words of G. Ernest Wright, the central purpose of Deuteronomy is to furnish Israel with a complete order of faith and life which is the prerequisite for a prosperous and secure existence on the God-given land. The historian [of the succeeding books] shows how Israel failed to keep it and what the consequences were.<align=0><font12><content>It is in fact the monarchic setting that is commonly held to be the historical background to the compilation of Deuteronomy. While Moshe’s last days and the people’s being poised on the steppes opposite Jericho would certainly be a dramatic enough moment for our book’s speeches to occur, its language, style, and many of its concerns point to a later time in the history of Israel as a likely venue for at least a good part of its emotional appeal.	That time, in the opinion of most biblical scholars over the past two centuries, was the middle of the reign of King Josiah (ruled 640–608 <p.small>b.c.e.</p.small>) of Judah, the southern kingdom (Israel, the north, had been overrun by Assyria a century previously). The Assyrian Empire, dominant in the region for three hundred years, was on the wane, and Josiah took advantage of this decline of power to expand his kingdom northward. He also—at about the time of the death of Ashurbanipal, the last powerful king of Assyria—began a wide-ranging reform that consisted largely of destroying the local “high places” of pagan worship that had figured so prominently in the reign of his grandfather, the notorious Manasseh (ruled 687–642). II Kings 23 describes the purge in great detail, noting both places and priests that were now rendered inoperative in favor of the centralization of the cult in Jerusalem.	It is within this setting that Chapter 22 reports the dramatic discovery of a scroll “of the Torah.” The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the book of the law in the house of the <p.small>Lord</p.small>.” . . . Shaphan then read it aloud to the king. When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes. Then the king commanded . . . saying: “Go, inquire of the <p.small>Lord</p.small> for me, for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found, for great is the wrath of the <p.small>Lord</p.small> . . . because our ancestors did not obey the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.” (<scrip>(Deuteronomy)22:8</scrip>, <scrip2>10–13</scrip>, New Revised Standard Version)<align=0><font12><content>What precisely were the contents of the “book” we do not know; but it is usually taken to have been some form of Deuteronomy. The rhetorical force of the newly discovered text must have been considerable, for its reported result was that the king directed that all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem should be gathered to him. . . . he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the house of the <p.small>Lord</p.small>. The king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the <p.small>Lord</p.small>, to follow the <p.small>Lord</p.small>, keeping his commandments, his decrees, and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. All the people joined in the covenant. (<scrip>(Deuteronomy)23:1–3</scrip>)<align=0><font12><content>The connections between these passages and the style of Deuteronomy will be obvious to anyone who reads the book, and it seems clear that Josiah’s reforms are closely related to concerns expressed in Deuteronomy.	The Bible’s portrayal of this background does not necessarily mean that Deuteronomy was composed for the occasion, or even that it originated in Judah. Several scholars (notably Ginsberg) have remarked on connections to the northern kingdom of Israel (e.g., affinities to the prophet Hosea), and so it is possible that at least some of our book was a series of traditions brought south by refugees fleeing the Assyrian onslaught. In any event, the text of Deuteronomy addresses its audience with such emotional immediacy that it may safely be presumed that a crisis of major proportions loomed, and the opportunity presented itself for a large-scale revival—or redefinition—of Israel’s self-understanding. Similar crises later in Jewish history may have led to the editing and writing down (but not necessarily the composition) of other central texts, the Mishnah (c. 200) and the Babylonian Talmud (c. 450). Like these documents, and like the first four books of the Torah, Deuteronomy is written in such a way that it is difficult to pin down its precise background, which through additions and circumspection has been substantially obliterated. What is left to us are the many repetitions of “today” or “this day,” which signal the desire to make the “Instruction” contemporary for the audience, whoever and whenever that may be.	The net effect of this process of creation and development was to establish the Torah’s character as a text that shows signs of new life and new thinking within itself. Deuteronomy, by its inclusion as the final book of the five, officially began the practice of “explaining” (<scrip>(Deuteronomy)1:5</scrip>) the traditions of Israel, and thus paved the way for the classic form of Jewish religious and intellectual activity: the interpretation of Scripture (cf. Fishbane 1988 for a definitive study on “inner-biblical exegesis,” interpretation that appears within the Bible itself and hence becomes a legitimate part of its traditions). This activity strongly influenced Christianity and Islam as well, and is still a part of religious discourse and development in the Western world.<align=0><font12><content>In its overall structure, Deuteronomy breaks down fairly easily; but it is perhaps best understood in the light of comparative ancient Near Eastern material. Weinfeld’s lifetime of research has demonstrated the strong parallels between our book and certain Assyrian treaty texts (earlier Hittite texts have also been shown to be helpful in this regard; cf. Levenson 1985b for a useful summary). It is striking indeed that the Esarhaddon Treaty texts from the seventh century <p.small>b.c.e.,</p.small> which also produced the final form of Deuteronomy, seem to prefigure the basic structure of what Moshe lays out in the book: a historical overview, an exhortation to keep the covenant, the laws—particulars of the covenant, a series of blessings and curses following upon observance or nonobservance of the covenant, and a ceremony ratifying it. A similar pattern, in abbreviated form, may be observed in the Sinai covenant in <scrip2>Ex. 19–24</scrip>.	Weinfeld points out that such covenants or treaties were two-sided, with the suzerain granting his vassals certain favors in return for “love” (= loyalty), and threatening dire consequences if that loyalty were to become suspect. What is fascinating about the parallels is not so much that they exist, but that here, apparently, a political model from a hated enemy has been assimilated and transformed into a positive religious-national one. Such transformative power seems to be characteristic of biblical culture, which probably reworked known stories and poems, among other genres, into genuine Israelite creations (the Flood narratives of Genesis and <scrip2>Psalm 29</scrip> are two fruitful examples of the process).	Deuteronomy, then, focuses mainly on the relationship between God and Israel, a relationship that has been spelled out before (as in Exodus) but that forms in this book the very soul of the text. Every act that Israel performs as a community, and every one done by individuals, is to be seen in that light. As elsewhere in the Bible, breaking one of God’s rules means not merely a violation of a statute but an affront to the suzerain, the sovereign Lord, and thus a grave risk to society’s well-being and even to its very existence. And there is a unity of purpose and concept here: Gottwald summarizes the message of the book as “the indivisible unity of <i>one God<style> for <i>one people<style> in <i>one land<style> observing <i>one cult”<style> (italics his).	Given the treaty pattern that we have just referred to, an outline of the book might proceed along the following lines:<align=30>	I Historical Overview (Moshe as Narrator; <scrip>(Deuteronomy)1–4:43</scrip>)<align=60>	A Narrative of the Wilderness Journey (<scrip>(Deuteronomy)1–3</scrip>)<align=60>	B Transition: Beginning of the Exhortation (<scrip>(Deuteronomy)4:1–40</scrip>) and<align=60>	Addendum on Towns of Asylum (<scrip>(Deuteronomy)4:41–43</scrip>)<align=30>	II Opening Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; <scrip>(Deuteronomy)4:44–11:36</scrip>)<align=30>	Looking Back to the Revelation at Sinai<align=30>	III The Terms of the Covenant (Moshe as Lawgiver; <scrip>(Deuteronomy)12–28</scrip>)<align=60>	A The Laws (<scrip>(Deuteronomy)12–26</scrip>)<align=60>	B Covenant Ceremony; Blessings and Curses (<scrip>(Deuteronomy)27–28</scrip>)<align=30>	IV Concluding Exhortation (Moshe as Pleader; <scrip>(Deuteronomy)29–30</scrip>)<align=30>	Looking Ahead to Exile and Return<align=30>	V Final Matters (<scrip>(Deuteronomy)31–34</scrip>)<align=60>	A Passing the Mantle (<scrip>(Deuteronomy)31</scrip>)<align=60>	B Moshe’s Admonitory Poem (<scrip>(Deuteronomy)32</scrip>)<align=60>	C Moshe’s Blessing to the Tribes (<scrip>(Deuteronomy)33</scrip>)<align=60>	D The End (<scrip>(Deuteronomy)34</scrip>)<align=0><font12><content>A few simple structural observations, based on a closer look at the text itself, may be made here. Parts I and V stress the role of Yehoshua (Joshua) in the future. Then, too, Parts II and IV use similar rhetorical formulas toward the end of each (“See, I set before you this day . . . ,” <scrip>(Deuteronomy)11:26</scrip> and <scrip>(Deuteronomy)30:15</scrip>). Such a symmetry would suggest that Part III is the crucial one, and that is of course the case. Everything in Deuteronomy radiates out from the laws: a new humanism, a rethinking of tradition, and above all, a heartfelt appeal to “choose life” (<scrip>(Deuteronomy)30:19</scrip>), a good life on the land under the blessing of God.	It is only when that appeal has been fully made, and when all of Deuteronomy’s new material has been added (with no more to come, as the text sees it!), that Moshe can finally die, and the people of Israel can proceed into the Promised Land. The book of Numbers proved to be a false ending, and indeed the report of Moshe’s death was postponed from the end of that book to this, so that the biblical tradition could transform itself into a truly multifaceted and rich one. The Torah, which began in the nameless, unknowable past, ends in the limitless present and future, with a potential life ahead for the Israelite people as bountiful and as beautiful as the “good land” that Moshe is allowed to see from the summit of Pisga.<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b_caps>PART I<br><br>Historical Overview<br><br><style>(<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)1–4:43<content>)<align=0><font12><content><p.small>In this introductory section, which some scholars have viewed as a later addition to the core of the book,</p.small> Moshe reviews the journey of the Israelites from Mount Sinai (“Horev”) into the Negev, and from there up east of the Dead Sea to a spot opposite Jericho. Two things make this more than a mere itinerary: First, Moshe confines himself to the most important moments—the choosing of leaders, the sending of the spies (with all its disastrous consequences), the encounters with various nations, and the provisions made for the soon-to-occur conquest. Second, the text characterizes itself, not as a narrative per se, but as an “explanation” (<scrip>(Deuteronomy)1:5</scrip>) of the “Instruction.” In other words, history is made to function as lesson here. That the account ends with Bet (Baal) Pe’or in <scrip>(Deuteronomy)3:29</scrip> is surely not accidental; as <scrip>(Deuteronomy)4:3</scrip> reminds us, this was the site of Israel’s great apostasy, the final negative act by a wayward generation that was not to live to enter the land of Israel. By means of this introduction, the new generation is warned about the failings of the old, and begins to be prepared for “entering and taking-possession of the land” promised to their ancestors (<scrip>(Deuteronomy)4:1</scrip>).	The first four chapters of the book establish its character as a link: by recounting key events in Israel’s wanderings, they summarize the narratives of Exodus and Numbers; by demonstrating that disaster resulted from the people’s rebellions, they set the ideology that will permeate the so-called Deuteronomistic History, namely the books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings (Nelson).	It should be realized that these chapters are not merely previous narratives repeated verbatim. They are in fact reworkings of earlier material, often with changes. Thus, to use Brettler’s example, 1:9-18 retells <scrip2>Ex. 18:13-26</scrip>, with the change that this time, as Moshe appoints lower-level leadership for the people, he does so without his father-in-law Yitro (who had helped in the Exodus version), and chooses them on the basis of their capabilities (“wisdom”), not their piety. Brettler also points to the frequent use of the phrase “at that time” as an indicator of later additions to the text. For a comprehensive discussion of how these opening chapters differ from earlier accounts, see Tigay.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Setting Out<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)1</scrip>): After the narrator’s brief introduction, which places the Israelites at the very borders of the Promised Land, Moshe’s words bring the Israelites from Sinai to Kadesh, in the southern part of the land. He begins with his own problem, the burden of leadership; but the bulk of the chapter functions to explain why the Israelites that came out of Egypt were not privileged to enter the land itself. Stylistically interesting is Moshe’s constant use of quotations—he cites God, himself, and the Israelites. The effect is to make the narrative vivid and also authoritative in tone (cf. Polzin 1980).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Encountering the Nations<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)2</scrip>, <scrip2>3:1–22</scrip>): Moshe’s narrative moves the people toward their present location, east of Jericho, detailing their disappointments and triumphs in meetings with the indigenous peoples of the area. The account begins tentatively, with Israel warned not to antagonize their “cousins,” the Children of Esav, but ends with a foreshadowing of the conquest of Canaan—the successful war-making of the two and a half tribes (cf. <scrip2>Num. 32</scrip>) that received land east of the Jordan.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Moshe’s Personal Plea<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)3:23–29</scrip>): Before Moshe begins his appeal to the people of Israel to keep the covenant, he recalls his fervent prayer to God to be allowed into the land himself, a prayer that is, of course, answered in the negative. This recollection raises the emotional stakes of what is to come; the bulk of the book is now established as Moshe’s last words. <i><h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Transition<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)4:1–40</scrip>): Moshe, having narrated Israel’s wilderness travels up to the spot where they are standing, now launches into the main set of speeches that characterize Deuteronomy’s style, a series of exhortations to the people to follow God’s laws. This section is connected to the previous material by its evocation of past events (the sin at Baal Pe’or and the revelation at Sinai/Horev), but it also points to the future, by means of its vision of exile and return. Not surprisingly, the words “hear/hearken,” “see,” “laws [and regulations],” and “command” are all key expressions; these become increasingly important in the chapters to follow.	Ironic is the repeated warning, which appears here for the first time, not to add anything to the Instruction. Yet Deuteronomy itself does just that. But, as we have noted above, by closing the Torah after the end of the book, Deuteronomy is able to introduce innovations with the force of tradition, and seemingly guard against further overt revision.	Levenson (1975) sees this section, along with material in chapters 28–32, as providing a framework for the book for the Israelite community in exile, suggesting that return to God is still possible through keeping the commandments laid out within the framework.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Towns of Asylum<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)4:41–43</scrip>): In a brief passage that seems utterly out of place amid the deep rhetoric of this section, Moshe carries out a command he had received in <scrip2>Num. 35:9–34</scrip> to make sure that an accidental manslayer has a special place(s) to flee to from an avenging family. Perhaps this has been placed here because it is one of the few “laws and regulations” in the Torah whose observance is mandated on the east bank of the Jordan River—and hence is one of the few that Moshe personally gets to carry out.<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b>Notes<content><style><h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>1:1<exerpt><b>	words:<content><style> Or “speeches.”<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>2<exerpt><b>	Horev:<content><style> Another biblical name for Mount Sinai. <exerpt><b>Kadesh-Barne’a:<content><style> The “base camp” for Israel’s wanderings after <scrip2>Num. 14</scrip>, at the southern border of biblical Israel in the Negev.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>3<exerpt><b>	fortieth year:<content><style> Since the departure from Egypt.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>4<exerpt><b>	Sihon . . .

It is in this section that Moshe appears in his most classic Deuteronomistic mode, urging the people on to follow God’s rules and warning them against violating the<style> covenant.	Recurring phrases in the section include “Hearken O Israel,” “And now, O Israel,” “When I bring you into the land . . . ,” and “take-care.” In addition, the word “love,” which as noted above carries the connotation of “loyalty,” is important in these speeches.	After a brief geographical introduction in vv.44–49, which parallels the opening of the book and which, in the eyes of many, once served as the book’s actual beginning, the section presents a version of the so-called Ten Commandments, and a short recapitulation of the circumstances surrounding their being given on Sinai. In that sense, Chapter 5 is a continuation of the historical overview of the beginning of the book.	Another famous passage here is in Chapter 6, where Israel is enjoined to “love” God, warned about what will happen if they abandon him, and given a kind of script as answer to their children’s future question, “What [mean] the precepts, the laws and the regulations that <p.small>Yhwh</p.small> our God has commanded you?” (v.20).	Other important themes appear in these speeches. Israel is defined as a people that is not to intermarry with the indigenous peoples of Canaan; as a people chosen, not for its military power or large population, but because God “loved” them, and because he could not abide the Canaanites’ behavior. To prove his point that Israel possesses no inherent superiority, Moshe turns again to history, and retells the story of the Molten Calf (<scrip2>Ex. 32–34</scrip>).	He ends (in Chap. <scrip>(Deuteronomy)11</scrip>) by reiterating the motif of God’s power and hence his ability to reward faithfulness with the gift of the good land. Israel is promised blessing and not curse, provided that they “take-care to observe” the laws which are now to be set before them.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Basic Rules<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)4:44–5:30</scrip>): After a brief introduction, the text appears to begin the sequence of “laws and regulations” with the Ten Commandments. The latter, however, are quoted from Sinai (albeit in slightly altered form), and we are justified in viewing them, just as their counterpart in <scrip2>Ex. 20</scrip>, as a kind of preamble to the laws themselves. They may even function as a narrated piece amid the pleas of Moshe. At any event, Chap. <scrip>(Deuteronomy)5</scrip> uses key words we have previously encountered—“speak,” “command,” “hear”—but puts major emphasis on variations of the root “live.” The message would seem to be that those who heard God speaking at Sinai miraculously survived, and now will survive into the long term if they keep God’s covenant which he presented at the mountain.	The Ten Commandments, of course, form a cornerstone of Western civilization—although a glance at them will reveal that they have not been very well followed over the past two millennia. But their language and their message remain an ideal. They served for a time as part of Jewish liturgy, but were ultimately removed from the Prayer Book out of fear that it would be thought that ten rules were the limit of one’s obligations to God.	As in Chap. <scrip>(Deuteronomy)4</scrip>, where the audience is warned not to add anything to the revealed Instruction, Chap. <scrip>(Deuteronomy)5</scrip> also reminds them that nothing was added at Sinai.<i><h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Centrality of Education<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)6</scrip>): Deuteronomy places particular emphasis on transmitting the meaning and practice of the laws. Crucial here is the concept that constant recital of key ideas and experiences, and making sure to pass them on to new generations, will insure the observance of the commandments and hence Israel’s good life on the promised soil. “Command” is the frequently used key word; the central passage is the so-called <i>Shema<style> (“Hearken [O Israel]”), already used in ancient times as both the core prayer in daily Jewish liturgy and the cry of martyrs (it is used as well as a prayer for retiring at night and as the core of the deathbed confession). Here memory is the key: the experience of slavery in Egypt, Israel’s trying behavior in the wilderness, and, above all, the constant rescuing grace of God. The idea that there should be constant reminders of the covenant became a staple of Jewish ritual practice, from the early education of children in the biblical text, to the <i>tefillin<style> (see below) worn in daily prayer, to the <i>mezuza<style> (a small box containing passages from Deuteronomy) on the doorpost. All three are mentioned in vv.7–9.	Vv. 5–9 have an oral, liturgical ring to them, with the tenfold repetition of the sound <i>ekha<style> (“your”). A good many sections of Deuteronomy in fact utilize this style, providing the book, despite its emphasis on the phenomenon of writing, with a distinctive sound.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Israel and the Canaanites<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)7</scrip>): An important part of Israel’s self-understanding in Deuteronomy, as elsewhere in the Torah, is separation from other peoples—particularly from the inhabitants of the land they are to conquer. This chapter emphasizes the absolute avoidance of the Canaanites which the Israelites are to practice (it begins and ends with “devotion-to-destruction,” a kind of ritual ban or confiscation). The violence on the part of Israel spoken of in the opening verses, and the destruction wrought by God in the closing lines, frame a middle section that speaks of God’s “love” and “loyalty” toward Israel—again, in the mode of an ancient Near Eastern overlord. The emotional tone of the chapter strongly suggests a period of intense nationalism. <i>The Land<style> (8): Moshe now recounts the past—God’s care of Israel in the wilderness (the opening chapters stressed other aspects), in order to set up expectations for the future life of the people in the Promised Land. The reference to the past is to insure that Israel not attribute its success and happiness in the land to their own prowess; otherwise they will disappear like the peoples they are replacing.	Appearing here, as it does frequently elsewhere in the Bible, is the idea of the “merit of the Fathers”—the concept that God is beneficent and forgiving toward the Israelites chiefly owing to the deeds of their ancestors. It survived as a key idea in classical Judaism. <i>The Calf Incident<style> (9–10:11): Continuing the argument of the last chapter—that Israel should take great care to remember who it was that led them—Moshe makes pointed reference to the great rebellion that took place at the foot of Sinai itself: the incident of the Golden (“Molten”) Calf in <scrip2>Ex. 32–34</scrip>. In this he is recapitulating the rhetoric of the opening chapters of the book, as well as of the great poem in Chap. <scrip>(Deuteronomy)32</scrip>, which utilize the past to inform the future. The calf incident, in fact, paves the way for the passages that immediately follow.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Concluding Exhortation<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)10:12–11:32</scrip>): To conclude his long introduction to the laws, Moshe returns to the theme of <p.small>Yhwh</p.small>’s love for Israel, expanding it to include Israel’s duty to love the stranger and also to love God. Once again the past is invoked, especially those parts of it that focus on God’s might. The intimate connection between people and land is stressed through Moshe’s wonderful description of Canaan (vv.11–12), and the polarity of blessing and curse rounds out his plea—just as a long blessing/curse cycle will round out the whole book in Chaps. <scrip>(Deuteronomy)29</scrip> and <scrip2>30</scrip>. In fact, Chap. <scrip>(Deuteronomy)11</scrip>, both in its beginning (“you are to keep his charge, his laws, his regulations and his commandments”) and its ending (“you are to take-care to observe all the laws and the regulations that I place before you today”), form a fitting lead-in to the long sequence of laws that is about to commence.<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b>Notes<content><style><h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>5:3<exerpt><b>	but with us . . . here today:<content><style> The extreme irony of this statement, if taken at face value, is apparent.

Israel is to demonstrate its love or loyalty to God by “taking-care to observe” the laws, and binds itself in a ceremony, at least in descriptive form, at the end of the section.	The subject matter of this long collection forms an interesting contrast to both the Covenant Code of Exodus (in the chapters just referred to) and other law collections in the ancient Near East. The Exodus material contains much that deals with property and damages, whereas Deuteronomy appears to focus more heavily on criminal and moral issues. Although neighboring civilizations had legal literature that parallels many of the cases before us (cf. Hallo for a discussion), Deuteronomy’s particular emphases suggest a shift away from personal property as the central area of society’s concern (Greenberg 1970). In addition, the biblical text here (as previously in the book) is generally cast in the second person singular, giving it a highly personal edge, and there is a higher percentage of “motive clauses”—explanations or justifications for the laws—than in other Near Eastern law codes. Sonsino has noted a strong similarity between the language of these chapters and the thrust of biblical “wisdom literature” such as the book of Proverbs; thus a major function of the material may well be didactic and not legal per se. This, interestingly, puts Deuteronomy more squarely within its Near Eastern setting; Fishbane (1988) characterizes both sets of systems as “stylized collections of typical cases.”	Yet he also argues that whatever the original purpose of the laws in Chapters 12–26, they came already within the biblical period itself to be seen as actual “legislative texts,” and as such, subject to later interpretation much as any law code might spawn (this multiple function of the laws was noted by Weinfeld 1972a). In this connection it is clear that new attitudes have been adopted and changes made in specific cases. It is usually accepted that Deuteronomy has introduced a markedly humanistic tone into Israel’s legal system; in Weinfeld’s words (1993): . . . the author’s purpose was not to produce a civil-law book like the book of the covenant, treating of pecuniary matters, but to set forth a code of laws securing the protection of the individual and particularly of those persons in need of protection.<align=0><font12><content>Some of the changes from earlier laws are noted in the Commentary and Notes below.	Nelson has divided the laws into the following sections: Purity in Worship (<scrip>(Deuteronomy)12:1–14:21</scrip>); Life in the New Land (<scrip>(Deuteronomy)14:22–16:17</scrip>); The Structures of Society (<scrip>(Deuteronomy)16:18–20:20</scrip>); and Interpreting Traditional Laws (<scrip>(Deuteronomy)21:1–26:19</scrip>). In his view, the changes introduced into Israel’s legal culture are responses to changes in Israelite society, whether economic, political, or religious—changes that may well reflect the monarchic period. The attempt to find a logical pattern to the structure of the laws, however, does not always succeed. Levinson has shown how a better understanding of the sequencing of the laws may be found in the principle of response to the centralization of worship, the event that historically may have accompanied Deuteronomy’s promulgation. In this scheme, <scrip>(Deuteronomy)12:1–16:17</scrip> is above all a response to how centralization affected the cultic (sacrifical worship) sphere, and <scrip>(Deuteronomy)16:18–17:13</scrip> to how judicial process was similarly affected. At the same time, these changes appear to be woven into older material.	The phrase “And <p.small>Yhwh</p.small> spoke to Moshe, saying: / Speak to the Children of Israel and say to them: . . . ,” so common in the legal and cultic sections of Leviticus and Numbers, does not appear here. Neither does it appear in the Covenant Code; but in the context of Deuteronomy, the absence of the phrase supports the emphasis on Moshe as the central figure (in Exodus the legal portions are followed by the Tabernacle instructions, which indeed use the quoted formula).	Chapter 12 begins with “These are the laws and the regulations that you are to take-care to observe”; Chapter 28 ends with “These are the words of the covenant. . . .” As in Exodus, the laws are the terms of the covenant, not merely a set of rules to be followed. This is further supported by the framework into which these chapters have been placed. The first two parts of the book serve as a classic ancient Near Eastern introduction to a treaty, with their historical look back. In addition, the section ends with both a covenant ceremony (Chap. <scrip>(Deuteronomy)27</scrip>) and a series of blessings and curses (28), also typical in this genre. So far from being merely a dry list of laws, the core of Deuteronomy, with its reasoned tone and wide-ranging scope, serves both as a summing-up and as a basis for Israel’s life on the land. No wonder, then, that the exiles returning from Babylonia under Persian rule in the sixth century <p.small>b.c.e.</p.small> and later came to view the Torah as a real constitution.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>On Worship and Meat-Eating<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)12:2–31</scrip>): The extended section on laws begins with what sounds like a reference to Josiah’s reform—the smashing of idols, the abolition of the “high-places” (the pagan shrines which dotted the ancient landscape of Canaan), and the centralization of the cult in the place that “God chooses to have his name dwell.” Since this emphasis is central to the program of Deuteronomy in its final form, it is not surprising that it appears first in the legal section of the book—rather like the opening of the laws in <scrip2>Exodus 21-23</scrip>, which centers around the situation of one of its central concerns and images, the slave (Levinson). A logical result of the centralization of the cult is the need to permit the eating of meat in local sites; previously it had been permitted only at the Dwelling (cf. <scrip2>Lev. 17</scrip>), the portable sanctuary. But the old prohibition against eating blood, as symbolic of the life, is upheld.	Vv.29-31, which mark a transition to the next chapter, round out Chap. <scrip>(Deuteronomy)12</scrip>’s stern proscription of improper worship—“indeed, even their sons and daughters they burn with fire to their gods!” (31).	Christensen (1986) notes a stylistic peculiarity of this chapter which is typical of Deuteronomy: a shift between second person plural and singular. While others have tried to use this phenomenon to point to evidence of editing, he sees it as a stylistic way of marking metrical sections of the chapter.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Leading the People Astray<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)13</scrip>): The subject is various scenarios under which Israelites might be lured to worship other gods; it has first been broached in <scrip2>Ex. 22:19</scrip>, and will return in <scrip2>Deut. 17:2–7</scrip>. Vv.2–6 deal with a religious visionary, 7–12 with a relative (both of whom seek to turn the Israelites to idols), and 13–19 with a whole town that has abandoned the covenant in favor of other gods. In all three cases, the penalty is death, with the chapter building up the sentences into a crescendo of destruction in vv.16–19. The opening verse of the chapter forms a fitting superscript for the bulk of the laws, and hints that Deuteronomy is a kind of final, closed, “canonical” dispensation. <i>Holiness<style> (14): Chap. <scrip>(Deuteronomy)14</scrip> looks back to a major priestly concern. Indeed, the word “holy” appears in v.2, just as it did in conjunction with Israel the “special treasure” (mentioned here as well) in <scrip2>Ex. 19:5–6</scrip>. Holiness includes banning Canaanite practices regarding the dead, distinguishing between pure and impure animals, avoiding carcasses as a major source of ritual pollution, and following the rules concerning tithes. In regard to the latter, what seems to matter most in the text is not precisely what is due God—a narrowly religious concern—but rather the care one must take that the powerless members of society (sojourner, widow, orphan) are provided for—a much broader one.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Number Seven and the Matter of Debt<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)15:1–18</scrip>): In <scrip2>Lev. 25</scrip>, the Sabbatical year was explained in great detail, principally in regard to letting the land lie fallow. Similarly, the cycle of seven-times-seven years (plus one), the Jubilee (“Homebringing”) Year, was characterized as a time of land returning to its original owners. While the Leviticus text talks a good deal about poverty from v.35 on, most of it is about land and money. In Deuteronomy, on the other hand, the issue of the needy jumps to the fore from the beginning of the chapter, and remains central throughout. The result of such care is “blessing” from God, a theme word in the chapter.	Vv.12–18 parallel <scrip2>Ex. 21:2–6</scrip>, but utilize a more rational argument. They also include the freeing of female slaves, in effect recognizing their personhood in a way the Exodus passage does not (Weinfeld 1992).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Firstling<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)15:19–23</scrip>): Linking up with the Passover passage that follows, this law combines the idea of the consecrated firstborn of animals with Deuteronomy’s new rules about eating sacrificial meat at home.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Pilgrimage Festivals<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)16:1–17</scrip>): To the other sacred calendars in <scrip2>Ex. 23:14–17</scrip>, <scrip2>Ex. 34:18</scrip>, <scrip2>22–24</scrip>, and <scrip2>Lev. 23</scrip>, our passage adds the stipulation that the three harvest/pilgrimage festivals be observed exclusively “in the place that <p.small>Yhwh</p.small> chooses / to have his name dwell” (v.2). “Blessing” and the individual’s capacity for giving are other important points.	Vv. 1-7, which deal with Passover, make clear how Deuteronomy reinterprets tradition in the light of its new program of centralization. As Levinson points out, this holiday, whose origin is clearly in the setting of the clan, is here broadened away from exclusive home observance and toward the sanctuary. To that end, animals other than lambs are now allowed to be sacrificed, and they may be boiled, not just roasted. In addition, the protective aspect of the animal’s blood, which was so central to the Exodus account, is de-emphasized.	<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Justice<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)16:18–20</scrip>): This aspect of communal life has been treated before (e.g., <scrip2>Ex. 23:2–3</scrip>, <scrip2>6–9</scrip>), but not with quite the impassioned edge found in v.20.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Against Canaanite Cult Objects<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)16:21–22</scrip>): The destruction of pagan shrines is once again demanded. Both the <i>Ashera<style> and the “standing-stone” were connected to the theme of fertility, which in Canaanite worship was related to the gods’ generative power. Israelite thought, on the other hand, attributed fertility to a non- or metasexual God.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Improper Sacrifice<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)17:1</scrip>): Related to <scrip>(Deuteronomy)15:21</scrip>, the text reiterates that <p.small>Yhwh</p.small> must be worshiped only in perfection—meaning that a sacrificial animal must be free of defects.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Process of Judgment<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)17:2–13</scrip>): Ancient Israel’s judicial process involved, not judge and jury, but elders or priests. In this setting, proper “inquiry” was crucial; the testimony of eyewitnesses was required in multiple; and priests provided a sort of appeals court, with their “instruction” serving as the final word on the case—on pain of death.	As part of the Deuteronomic program of centralizing authority, it should be noted that elders are replaced here by state officials in various matters of judgment (vv.8-11; see also <scrip>(Deuteronomy)16:18</scrip>) (Levinson).	<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Laws of Kingship<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)17:14–20</scrip>): Deuteronomy here introduces a new note into the Torah, one which becomes familiar from I and II Samuel on. Ancient Israel had an interesting and at times ambivalent attitude toward monarchy: on the one hand, it viewed God as the sole king (cf. <scrip2>Judg. 8:22–23</scrip>), and could roundly condemn monarchy’s excesses (cf. <scrip2>I Sam. 8:10–18</scrip>). On the other hand, popular support for this common human institution was widespread in the face of the constant military threat, especially from the coast-dwelling and technologically superior Philistines. Once established, the monarchy was permanent.	Our passage clearly demonstrates the controls on the institution desired by the biblical writers: limits on wealth and the stipulation that the king study God’s Instruction. The latter expectation, in varying forms, is found all over the ancient Near East (Weinfeld).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Levites’ Share<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)18:1–8</scrip>): Their role established fully in the book of Numbers, the Levites functioned as assistants to their kinsmen, the priests, in a variety of capacities. In Deuteronomy, however, the Levite-priest distinction is not sharply drawn. As elsewhere, the Levites owned no land, and hence were supported by portions of various sacrifices and tithes. Sorcery and False Prophecy (<scrip>(Deuteronomy)18:9–22</scrip>): Picking up the theme of avoiding the magical practices of the Canaanites (cf. the briefer <scrip2>Ex. 22:17</scrip>), the text continues into the topic of prophecy, which is viewed as the proper way to know the will of God. The safeguard against false prophecy, though—noting the nonfulfillment of the “prophet’s” word—was too shaky a basis for a stable system. Deuteronomy as a whole has a better overall answer than the one it gives here: it establishes the text as the authority, a process that the book appears to have inaugurated and that became central to the three Western religions.	The passage on sorcery (vv.9–12) repeats “abomination” three times, to emphasize the Bible’s abhorrence of the practices enumerated here. This is not to imply that the Israelites did not believe in the efficacy of such phenomena; they simply viewed them as an unacceptable way of learning the divine will.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Towns of Asylum<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)19:1–13</scrip>): <scrip2>Num. 35</scrip> dealt at length with the same problem, the fate of the accidental murderer. There, however, the manslayer was confined to particular locations until the death of the High Priest, as a kind of atonement for the polluting of the land through bloodshed, whereas here it is primarily to escape family vengeance.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Moving of Borders<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)19:14</scrip>): A society that put great store by land, as many still in the region today, ancient Israel saw family holdings and borders as basically sacred (in this text as in others, the “inheritance” comes from God).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Witnesses<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)19:15–21</scrip>): The need for multiple witnesses and proper inquiry establishes the seriousness of what is at stake in the justice system. In keeping with the biblical idea of “equity” (Heb. <i>tzedek<style>), that is, fairness and balance in judgment, a false witness suffers the same punishment as would have befallen the innocent person whom he accused. The “eye for an eye” punishment is thus to serve as a deterrent for a most abhorrent crime.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Laws of War<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)20</scrip>): As an example of Deuteronomy’s thinking and often humane approach, the rules of war have a reasoned tone compared even to the contemporary world. Many of them occur elsewhere in the ancient Near East. The first four verses stress the frequently appearing idea that God fights on the Israelites’ behalf. From there vv.5–7 help to maintain the values of an agricultural society by keeping new builders, new planters, and newlyweds at home for a while. Added to this are considerations of troop morale (vv.8–9), offers of peaceful surrender terms (10–11), and the end results of siege as commonly portrayed in the ancient world (12–14). A different outcome is to be striven for in the case of the native Canaanites, who are to be wiped out, that Israel not be led astray into their “abominable” practices (16–18). The latter passage, especially since it is followed by an ecologically compassionate one about fruit trees, seems genocidal and hence morally unacceptable today. Clearly it stems from a zealous time and strong feelings; whether it was carried out as described we do not know. Medieval Jews solved the problem of moral sensibilities for themselves by defining the Canaanites as long dead with no contemporary successors. But the troubling nature of the text remains.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Unsolved Murder<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)21:1–9</scrip>): Another memorable addition to Israel’s law corpus, the case described here stands in stark contrast to the way things are done in contemporary society. For us, an unsolved murder is a matter of intellectual curiosity, a puzzle to be unraveled on a television screen; in biblical Israel, innocent blood had to be atoned for by the entire group when the perpetrator went unfound. In the biblical view (as in that of other ancient societies), crime or wrongdoing was seen as completely disruptive, a threat to the well-being of the very cosmos. Here atonement is made via a public confession and the death of an animal—not with the usual “decontaminating” use of sacrificial blood but with a death that symbolically atones for the death of the murder victim.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Fair Captive<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)21:10–14</scrip>): The situation of the female captive recalls the opening chapters of the <i>Iliad,<style> where it forms a key motif. Here, though, rather than the pride and anger of great warriors being at stake, it is the woman’s humanity that is central. She is allowed to mourn her family, and retains her dignity to the extent that she cannot be sold as a slave if her husband eventually rejects her.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Wives and Sons<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)21:15–17</scrip>): A tension that is played out in the Jacob and Joseph stories in Genesis, the conflict between two wives and their sons must have been a troubling reality in the polygamous ancient Near East. This could be conventionally solved by a father’s selection of the “firstborn,” but note the brake put on the father’s absolute control (Frymer-Kensky 1992a).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Rebellious Son<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)21:18–21</scrip>): Part of creating any ordered society involves continuity between the generations. Even so, this law seems to us to be “cruel and unusual punishment.” It becomes more understandable in the context of Deuteronomy’s transfer of power from parents (who have a choice here to report their son) to elders, that is, to society at large (see Marcus). The behavior of this son is regarded as a threat, not only to his family, but to the entire community (Frymer-Kensky 1992a). The law may also be, in its intensity, a reflection of the God-Israel relationship (see <scrip2>(Ps. 78:1-72)Psalms 78:8</scrip>, <scrip2>Jer. 5:23</scrip>) (Greenstein, personal communication).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Dignity of the Corpse<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)21:22–23</scrip>): Not burying the corpse of an executed criminal results in the pollution of the land and eventual expulsion, as set forth graphically in <scrip2>Lev. 18:24–30</scrip>.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Wandering Animal<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)22:1–4</scrip>): <scrip2>Ex. 23:4–5</scrip> exhorted people to attend to their enemy’s lost or overburdened animal. Here the law is expanded (and applied to one’s neighbor’s animal) to include taking care of the animal, and indeed of any lost object, until the owner makes inquiry. At issue is loss of work for the owner.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Mixed Clothing<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)22:5</scrip>): This prohibition touches on a frequent theme in Leviticus: the improper mixing of categories.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Mother Bird and Child Bird<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)22:6–7</scrip>): Another indicator of the humane concerns of Deuteronomy. There is an obvious parallel between the language here and that of the Fifth Commandment (honoring parents): “prolonging days” and “going-well” as a result of following these laws.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Safe Roof<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)22:8</scrip>): Deuteronomy, with its concern for human life, prevents the shedding of innocent blood once again.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>More Forbidden Mixtures<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)22:9–11</scrip>): As Greenstein (1984a) explains, hybrids in various areas were understood as appropriate only for God (or, in the case of clothing, the priests).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Fringes<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)22:12</scrip>): Paralleling <scrip2>Num. 15:37–41</scrip>—but this time with no rationale. In Numbers, the “tassels” were to serve as a constant reminder of the divine commandments.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The “Damaged” Wife<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)22:13–21</scrip>): A law that alternately upholds a woman’s dignity (making her husband pay if he has baselessly accused her) and may lead to taking her life (if the accusation is true). In the former case, they must remain married, and the husband has no possibility of divorcing her.	Virginity for women at marriage was an important value in ancient Israel as elsewhere. Frymer-Kensky (1992a) notes that this case parallels the one of the rebellious son above: the parents’ status and welfare is jeopardized; the parents can bring about the child’s death; and the elders have the authority to make a ruling, while the public has the power to put the offender to death.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Adultery<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)22:22</scrip>): The definition used here is the classic biblical one: a married woman and a man, married or not. In Mesopotamia it was possible to pay off the aggrieved husband, but not in ancient Israel, where adultery was seen as attacking the moral foundations of society and perhaps also the symbolism of the close relationship between God and Israel.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Rape—or Not<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)22:23–27</scrip>): In this case a woman is all but married, yet a distinction is made between an urban and a rural setting in terms of her fate. Note that her consent is not an issue here; as a betrothed woman, she had no right to give it (Frymer-Kensky 1992a).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Rape of an Unattached Woman<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)22:28–29</scrip>): The difference here, of course, is that the woman does not “belong” to a man. The rape must result in marriage, but since no husband’s privilege has been violated, the crime is neither a capital one nor even a criminal one. It is, however, seen as a “disgrace” (see <scrip2>Gen. 34:7</scrip>).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>An Improper Union<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)23:1</scrip>): Instead of the long lists in <scrip2>Lev. 18</scrip> and <scrip2>20</scrip>, we are given only what is a paradigmatic case of people who must not have sexual relations.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Those Disqualified from the Community<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)23:2–9</scrip>): A curious list of those not counted as part of the “holy people”: one who cannot reproduce, one born of a forbidden union, and a descendant of two of Israel’s traditional enemies to the east. In contrast, the Edomites, Israel’s “cousins,” are permitted into the community after a waiting period. While scholars have tried to date these passages on the basis of specific historical events, such attempts are probably fruitless.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Purity of the Camp<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)23:10–15</scrip>): The matter of bodily wastes, interestingly, did not enter the list of ritually “polluting” emissions enumerated in <scrip2>Lev. 12</scrip> and <scrip2>15</scrip>. Unlike blood and semen, they did not carry the connotation of life-death boundaries. At the same time, it is recognized here that a lapse in personal cleanliness on the part ot the Israelites will violate the purity of the camp, in which God “dwells.”<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Fugitive Slave<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)23:16–17</scrip>): Despite the accepted existence of slavery in Israelite society, Deuteronomy deemed it cruel to return fugitive slaves. This contrasts not only with ancient Near Eastern practice but also with some cases in the Bible (e.g., <scrip2>I Sam. 30:15</scrip>, I Kings <scrip>(Deuteronomy)2:39–40</scrip>) (Greenstein 1985a).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Pagan “Clergy”<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)23:18–19</scrip>): The use of pointed slurs (the key term “abomination” appears again) makes it clear how such people were regarded in the biblical estimation. In Frymer-Kensky’s view (1992b), these people were not “holy prostitutes,” but the Bible regards their deeds as horrifying. Likewise, Tigay rejects the idea that sexuality figured as an official part of ancient Near Eastern religion.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Charging Interest<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)23:20–24</scrip>): The law prohibits taking interest within the community as a damaging practice. The society in question, of course, was not predominantly a commercial one, and hence later interpretations, such as that of medieval Christians and Jews, were to attempt to read other things into it.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Making Vows<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)23:22–24</scrip>): The issue of taking vows is treated extensively in the book of Numbers (cf. Chaps. <scrip>(Deuteronomy)6</scrip> and <scrip2>30</scrip>), and was of major concern in the religious life of ancient Israel as an opportunity to make a more personal contribution to religious practice. The law also demonstrates the significance of the spoken word (through the use of “lips” and “mouth”), common to ancient societies and to many later one as well.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Reasonable Use<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)23:25–26</scrip>): Establishing a boundary for farms and their produce, the law steers a path between a human need (food) and theft.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Laws of Remarriage<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)24:1–4</scrip>): Continuing the concern for holiness in the area of sexuality, Deuteronomy prohibits what occasionally happens in Western society—a woman remarries her first husband after her divorce from another man. Such behavior was considered ritually polluting in ancient Israel. It may also have been connected to the fact that the first husband, if the woman remarried him, would thus be receiving property from another man’s wealth (the second husband’s).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The New Wife<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)24:5</scrip>): This humane military rule may stem from a tradition separate from the one in <scrip>(Deuteronomy)20:7</scrip>. In any event, it appears to acknowledge sexuality as a part of marriage separate from procreation.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Pledge I<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)24:6</scrip>): Even debt is a situation that must be handled sensitively; unfair collateral is not to be taken.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Kidnapping<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)24:7</scrip>): The capital crime here would appear to be the sale of specifically an Israelite as a slave.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>A Reminder about Skin Disease<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)24:8–9</scrip>): As detailed in <scrip2>Lev. 13–15</scrip>, <i>tzaraat<style> was some kind of skin condition that rendered a person temporarily unfit to be in the sacred camp. It was formerly identified with, and translated as, leprosy, but that is now felt to be incorrect by virtually all scholars. The law recurs here, among examples of injustice, because the disease was often viewed as the result of a person’s wrongful behaviors.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Pledge II<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)24:10–13</scrip>): A parallel to <scrip2>Ex. 22:24–26</scrip>, which, in contrast to other cases of comparison between the two legal collections, has the more emotional tone. On the other hand, our passage emphasizes the dignity due even a debtor.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Timely Payment<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)24:14–15</scrip>): “Oppression” here consists of delaying the payment of a worker’s wages. The “calling out” to <p.small>Yhwh</p.small> recalls a similar cry of the oppressed in <scrip2>Ex. 22:22</scrip>, <scrip2>26</scrip>. Overall, the rhetoric of the passage far exceeds that found in a parallel text in the Holiness Code (<scrip2>Lev. 19:13</scrip>).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Fathers and Children<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)24:16</scrip>): An issue of deep concern to the exiles in Babylonia, this questioning of free will is raised a number of times in the Bible. In <scrip2>Ex. 22:23</scrip>, God was to punish oppressors “so that their wives become widows, and [their] children orphans”; Deuteronomy has toned this down by punishing the evildoer and not his or her children. Cf. Fishbane (1988) for discussion.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Oppressed Again<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)24:17–22</scrip>): The three classic powerless groups in Israel and elsewhere have been mentioned before, but now receive help based on a particularly Israelite rationale: the people’s historical experience of having been oppressed in Egypt. For a parallel passage, cf. <scrip2>Ex. 22:23–24</scrip>.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Corporal Punishment<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)25:1–3</scrip>): Despite the predominance of “guilt” and “stroke/strike” in this passage, what is stressed in the end is more humanity than punishment.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Laboring Ox<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)25:4</scrip>): Parallel to the respect due human beings is that due a working animal. This may also reflect the Israelites’ identification with certain animals in symbolic settings (cf. Eilberg-Schwartz).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Keeping a Man’s Name Alive<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)25:5–10</scrip>): A number of stories and laws in the Bible clarify how important the continuity of the generations, as represented by carrying on a man’s name, was considered in ancient Israel. Here the law provides for the widow of a man who dies without heirs to provide one, through the institution of “levirate marriage”—whereby the man’s brother marries her, and the subsequent offspring bears the deceased brother’s name. This institution, applied to a more distant relative, vividly appears in the book of Ruth, which in fact contains a ceremony scene (<scrip>(Deuteronomy)4:1–11</scrip>) of the kind set forth here.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Improper Intervention in a Struggle<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)25:11–12</scrip>): In a law literally protecting maleness, a wife loses her hand over an act understood by a patriarchal society to be completely intolerable. Not even the close ties of a woman to the males of her family may overrule this (Frymer-Kensky 1992a). But also at issue may be the idea that the convenant is passed on biologically, and hence damaging the genitals damages the covenant (Greenstein, personal communication).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>True Weights<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)25:13–16</scrip>): Not only violating “purity” in diet and worship are adjudged “abominations,” but also the practice of falsifying weights and measures. Ethics in business is thus an aspect of serving God properly (as it is in other ancient Near Eastern cultures).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Amalek<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)25:17–19</scrip>): Hearkening back to <scrip2>Ex. 17:8–16</scrip>, this passage clarifies the crime of the Amalekites against the newly freed Israelites. The attack on the rear was remembered bitterly in the Bible; cf. I Sam. 15 and the book of Esther, where the villain, Haman, is portrayed as a descendant of the Amalekite king Agag.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Declaration of the Farmer<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)26:1–15</scrip>): In a climactic set of ceremonies, those who work the land are to acknowledge God’s ownership of the soil. Through the offering of firstfruits, the memory of the Exodus and the gift of the land are kept immediate—“I have entered the land” (v.3). The descendants’ rootedness in “a land flowing with milk and honey” (9) is made to contrast with the ancestors’ wandering. This characterization of the land, and thanksgiving for its produce, is reiterated in the brief section about tithes (12–15). Thus the land is not taken for granted, and Israel celebrates, not the sexuality of the gods as the source of the soil’s fertility, but rather the gift of a God who has intervened in human history.	This chapter is a fitting end to the sequence of laws in Deuteronomy; emphasizing the gift of the land (as Buber 1982 points out, “give” in various permutations occurs seven times) suggests that the gift may be revoked if the society does not uphold the covenant. Also notable is the sixfold use of the Hebrew root b-w-’ (<i>bo<style> ’), appearing here variously as “enter,” “produce,” “bring.”<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Summary<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)26:16–19</scrip>): The chapter, and the laws proper, end with the general observation that a two-way covenant has been made, as in <scrip2>Ex. 19:5–6</scrip>. The result takes a high nationalistic turn in v.19, which once again seems to fit primarily an age of monarchy.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Covenant Ceremony<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)27</scrip>): As if to dramatize what has just concluded, the text at this point interpolates a ceremony that in location (Shechem) and theme anticipates what we find at the end of the book of Joshua (Chap. <scrip>(Deuteronomy)24</scrip>). It also encourages viewing Deuteronomy as a Northern document. Here the core is the series of curses uttered on Mount Eval in vv.15–26 (the blessings, curiously, do not appear). The curses, which do not introduce any new material as such, reflect the community’s fear that someone will sin in secret and not be found out, and the entire community will suffer as a result (Bellefontaine). The public pronouncement of threats was not unusual at the sealing of an agreement in the ancient Near East. As in previous legal sections, we are presented with a mixture of areas—criminal, sexual, and ritual—ending with the general provision that the “words of this Instruction” are to be carefully observed.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Consequences<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)28</scrip>): Following the dramatic ceremony of Chap. <scrip>(Deuteronomy)27</scrip>, which, as an event placed in the future, feels somewhat artificial, is the more conventional listing of blessings and curses, parallel to <scrip2>Lev. 26</scrip>. The latter functionally ends the book of Leviticus (Chap. <scrip>(Deuteronomy)27</scrip> is obviously a kind of appendix), and our chapter here ends the long legal portion of Deuteronomy. A further parallel is the summary verses in each; <scrip2>Lev. 26</scrip> ends with “These are the laws, the regulations, and the instructions that <p.small>Yhwh</p.small> gave / between himself and the Children of Israel at Mount Sinai, by the hand of Moshe,” while v.69 of our chapter is “These are the words of the covenant / that <p.small>Yhwh</p.small> commanded Moshe to cut with the Children of Israel / in the land of Moav, / aside from the covenant that he cut with them at Horev.”	As is typical of this kind of literature, the curses seem to outweigh the blessings, not only in verse count (55 to 14) but in color of description as well. While later generations of Jews, horrified by the warnings of disaster, stipulated that this chapter be read in an undertone when it is a weekly public synagogue reading, it is fairly standard stuff in the context of ancient Near Eastern treaties.<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b>Notes<content><style><h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>12:2<exerpt><b>	demolish . . .:<content><style> Like several other lists of laws in the Torah (e.g., <scrip2>Ex. 21–23</scrip>), this one begins with the topic of proper worship of God.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>4<exerpt><b>	do...with:<content><style> Or “act...toward” (Tigay).<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>7<exerpt><b>	enterprises:<content><style> Lit. “putting-forth.”<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>8<exerpt><b>	whatever is right in his [own] eyes:<content><style> A theme in Deuteronomistic literature, usually denoting chaos.

The fourth part of the book, except for a few references to the wilderness experience, primarily places the future before the audience. Israel is warned, one last time, of the dire consequences of disregarding God’s laws. At the same time, it is presented with a happy ending: even if they should go into exile for their disobedience, God is confident of their “turning” back to him, and in consequence will eventually “return” them to their land and prosperity.	This section appears to be extraneous in the context of Deuteronomy’s basic structure. Perhaps it is a later addition, meant to address particular historical circumstances that presented a crisis situation.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Renewed Exhortation<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)29</scrip>): Having concluded the covenant, Moshe now takes up his plea again, beginning the same way that God did when the people arrived at Mount Sinai (<scrip2>Ex. 19:4–6</scrip>). Here, without the impressive backdrop of Sinai, Moshe goes on at some length, reviewing the past and then addressing both the “assembly” in front of him and those to come.	Much of the latter part of the chapter sounds like a reference to the fate of the Northern kingdom, Israel, which was overrun by Assyria a century before Josiah’s discovery of the “record.” Such may be the reason for the reference to “hidden” and “revealed” things in v.28—for the reason for the fall of the idolatrous North is certainly no mystery to the reader of Deuteronomy.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Exile and Return<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)30</scrip>): A chapter that is usually taken to be a late addition, 30 envisions a time after the curses have fallen upon the people of Israel and they finally return to God. This restorative vision is followed by Moshe’s turning to his audience and finishing his exhortations with a rhetorically moving appeal (vv.11–20). In this section the key root is “life,” occurring six times. It is a fitting ending to Moshe’s regular speeches.

Leadership must be passed on, so Moshe appears with his successor at the holiest spot in the encampment—the Tent of Appointment. It must be assured that the “Instruction” will be recited periodically in public, and that it be kept in safekeeping.	There are literary considerations as well. A number of biblical books or large units end with poetry (Genesis, the Deliverance Narratives of Exodus, the biography of King David in Samuel-Kings) and the editors of Deuteronomy have made use of the same device. As if to emphasize the majestic nature of the five books, not one but two poems make their appearance: the Song of Moshe, which serves as a final, memorable warning to the Israelites (and which, along with the laws, they are also supposed to remember), and his blessing, which makes use of the form that Yaakov used at the end of Genesis.	This business having been concluded, the Torah may finally draw to a close with the long-expected death of Moshe, who for his lifelong pains is literarily rewarded with praise at the ending of the five books. But amid the reader’s feelings about Moshe, the backdrop should not be forgotten: Israel has not—yet—entered the land. By ending “across” the Jordan (on the east bank), the Torah leaves the future open-ended, not filled with mourning for the past but rather full of hope for what is to come. This situation, not surprisingly, parallels the ending of the entire Hebrew Bible, which for the Jews of antiquity was located in <scrip2>II Chron. 36</scrip>: Thus speaks Cyrus king of Persia: <p.small>Yhwh</p.small>, the God of Heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; he has commanded me to build him a House in Jerusalem, in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be withhim! Let him go up!<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Preparing for the Future<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)31</scrip>): Having finished the bulk of his address to the people, Moshe now turns to his successor, Yehoshua—or rather, an anonymous narrator finally returns to have him do so. Yet Moshe takes care not only of the immediate future but also of the distant one, setting up the institutions of family teaching and reading the Instruction publicly every seven years (cf. Tigay for discussion). Depressingly, God couples his announcement of Moshe’s impending death with a picture of the idolatry the people will commit thereafter. As a bulwark against this possibility, the text provides a “song,” a long poetic chapter (32) that is to serve as a “witness” against aberrant behavior.	It should not be overlooked that Moshe writes down the “Instruction” and deposits it in the coffer (ark). Not only was this standard practice in the ancient Near East (Weinfeld), but in a narrative context it enables Israel to enter a new stage in its history, accompanied by strong words and symbols from the past.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Song of Moshe<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)32:1–43</scrip>): Especially in the ancient and medieval world, the death accounts of heroes tend to end with inspired visions. The inclusion of an ancient poem here is made to fit further into the context of Moshe’s exhortations in Deuteronomy—as a final warning to and witness against the people whom he has led. The “song” emphasizes the power and caring nature of God, which is contrasted with Israel’s pathetic response of unfaithfulness. God is likened to a nurturing parent and a protecting eagle; when Israel responds with idolatry, he turns into a destroyer. Much of this poem reminds one of other biblical literature, such as <scrip2>(Ps. 78:1-72)Psalm 78</scrip>—also a reprise of Israel’s history. That poem is recited as a proof of God’s choosing the (southern) House of David; the political motivation behind <scrip2>Deut. 32</scrip>, if there was one, is no longer clear to us.	Skehan notes that the number of verses in the song, 69, equals the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet (23) times three. Similar or related schemes appear elsewhere in the Bible, often in the form of acrostics (cf. Lamentations).	The song, which may predate Deuteronomy, may have been placed here as a traditional poem that meaningfully deals with catastrophe (Tigay). Despite the obscurity of some of its phrases, it stands as a witness to Israel’s self-understanding, albeit a negative one.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Some Final Words<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)32:44–52</scrip>): Moshe’s last regular words to the people reiterate the theme of “life” noted earlier. On the other hand, God, at the end of Moshe’s life, cannot refrain from reminding him (and us) of the reason that the great leader may not enter the Promised Land (v.51).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Blessing of Moshe<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)33</scrip>): As if to balance Yaakov’s deathbed blessing of his sons at the end (Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)49</scrip>) of Genesis, Moshe doubles his poetic vision and blesses Israel, tribe by tribe. The weighting of tribes is very different here from what it was in Genesis: Levi is quite strong, Shim’on has disappeared, and Yehuda, the tribe of David’s royal lineage, has a reduced role. Some scholars are therefore inclined to see a background of Northern ascendancy behind this poem, perhaps the days of Jeroboam II (early eighth century <p.small>b.c.e.</p.small>).	For a useful comparison of this chapter with other tribal blessings in the Bible, see Plaut; for discussion of textual problems, Tigay is clear and helpful.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The End<content><style> (<scrip1>(Deuteronomy)34</scrip>): Genesis concluded with the death of Yosef; Joshua will end with the death of the victorious general. Moshe’s passing provides the natural ending for the Torah; like that other great work of the first millennium <p.small>b.c.e.</p.small>, the <i>Iliad,<style> a funeral marks the end of the old generation and old circumstances. Israel, the narrated audience of the book of Deuteronomy, is now armed for what lies ahead, thanks to the leader’s orations that have comprised an entire book. The rhetorical force of Deuteronomy thus caps the stories, poems, and laws of Genesis through Numbers, and makes of the five books truly a “teaching” or Instruction.<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b>Notes<content><style><h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>31:1<exerpt><b>	went and spoke:<content><style> Ancient versions read “(When) Moshe finished speaking” (<i>vykl<style> instead of <i>vylk<style>).<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>2<exerpt><b>	A hundred and twenty:<content><style> In the 60-based Mesopotamian number system, this number indicates the maximal duration of life (Tigay).<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>14<exerpt><b>	days . . . drawing near . . . die: <content><style>Despite the English, the Hebrew here is not alliterative.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>17<exerpt><b>	conceal my face:<content><style> An oft-used biblical metaphor for God’s abandoning Israel.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>19<exerpt><b>	this song:<content><style> Which follows in 32:1–43.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>21<exerpt><b>	plans:<content><style> Suggesting evil ones; cf. <scrip2>Gen. 8:21</scrip>.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>32:2<exerpt><b>	teaching:<content><style> Lit. “what is received.”<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>3<exerpt><b>	give:<content><style> Or “ascribe.”<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>4<exerpt><b>	The Rock<content><style> etc.: This verse forms the beginning of the traditional Jewish burial service.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>5<exerpt><b>	His children have wrought-ruin . . .:<content><style> An extremely difficult verse that has been much debated.

Much of this material is now available in English translation, whether of Midrashim, some of the medievals, the Church Fathers, or Luther. As far as modern commentaries go, here too the amount of material is vast. New works appear constantly (Tigay’s JPS <i>Commentary on Deuteronomy,<style> for instance, will be appearing in 1996), and a full listing of appropriate works would take up several volumes on its own. The reader is therefore advised to consult the solid and extensive bibliographies found in the major commentaries such as Speiser (1964), Childs (1974), Sarna (1986), Milgrom (1991), Levine (1993), Weinfeld (1991), and Tigay (1996). As mentioned below, there is also a wealth of material to be gleaned from the numerous recent reference works, such as the <i>Anchor Bible Dictionary<style>.	The list below, which cites mainly English-language works, is intended to supplement <i>The Five Books of Moses<style> in terms of interpreting the text, providing ancient Near Eastern background, biblical history, and a literary approach to the Bible. It makes no pretense at being comprehensive, but is selective, including both those works which I found stimulating and those which are referred to in the Commentary and Notes (cited there by author and, if there is more than one work by the author, by date). The abbreviation “JPS,” which appears numerous times in the notes, refers to the New Jewish Publication Society translation, listed as <i>The Torah<style> below.<h2><p=art><align=1><title><font12><b_caps>Medieval Hebrew Commentaries<align=120><biblio><style>Abravanel	Isaac Abravanel, fifteenth-century Spain/Italy<align=120>Bekhor Shor	Joseph ben Isaac Bekhor Shor, twelfth-century France<align=120>Ibn Ezra	Abraham ibn Ezra, twelfth-century Spain<align=120>Redak (Kimhi)	David Kimhi, twelfth- to thirteenth-century France<align=120>Ramban	Moses ben Nahman, thirteenth-century Spain<align=120>Rashi	Solomon ben Isaac, eleventh-century France<content><align=0>A well-produced and useful Hebrew edition of most of the above commentaries is <i>Torat Hayyim<style> (Jerusalem, 1986–1993).<h2><p=art><align=1><title><font12><b_caps>Modern Works<align=40><biblio><style>Aberbach, A. and Smolar, Levy. “Aaron, Jeroboam and the Golden Calves.” <i>Journal of Biblical Literature<style> 86 (1967).<align=40>Abrahams, Israel. “Numbers, Typical and Important.” <i>Encyclopedia Judaica<style>, vol. 12.
