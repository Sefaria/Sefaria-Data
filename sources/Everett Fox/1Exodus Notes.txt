Genesis had concerned </p.small>itself with the beginnings of the world, of human beings and their institutions, and of the people of Israel as a tribal family. Exodus continues this thrust as it recounts the origin of the people on a religious and political level (here inseparable as concepts). A number of biblical ideas receive their fullest early treatment in this book: God’s acting directly in history; making himself “known” to both Israelites and foreigners; covenant as a reciprocal agreement between God and humans; law as an expression of total worldview; and the use of sacred structure (Tabernacle or “Dwelling”) as a vehicle for and expression of perceived truths about the world. In addition, several biblical institutions make their first appearance in Exodus: Passover, Sabbath, rudimentary leadership/government, and cult/priesthood. All this is presented in a general narrative framework, raising the question as to whether what we have here is story or history. Is Exodus a fanciful reconstruction of what happened to Moshe (Moses) and his generation, riddled with anachronisms? Or is it a faithful and reliable handing-down of eyewitness data which only the cynical or irreligious would doubt?	For the first position there are several supports. We possess virtually no extrabiblical references to the events recorded in our book, either in Egypt or elsewhere. Then, too, there seem to be inconsistencies of time within the story (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)16</scrip> and <scrip2>18</scrip> appear to presuppose laws which were given later), and patterns within the telling of the tale that are too symmetrical (the Plagues) or too stereotyped (the constant use of stylized language) to be simple reporting of fact. Finally, Exodus is lacking in the citation of personal and geographical names, especially as compared to the books that precede and follow (Genesis and Numbers).	For the second position, that of Exodus as a reliable historical record, there exist no methods of proof other than evaluation of literary form—that is, accepting that oral literature is able to preserve facts without later coloration. But even if it could be shown that Exodus is oral literature—an evaluation which is too sweeping, given the present form of the book—modern scholarship has come to cast doubt on the absolute historical reliability of oral tradition (see Vansina).	Despite these observations, there is still something unsettling about writing Exodus off as a work of fiction, however pious that fiction may have been. For the rest of the Hebrew Bible abounds in emotional references to the experience of the exodus. At every stage of biblical literature, that experience is invoked for the purpose of directing behavior (see especially <scrip2>Judg. 2</scrip>, <scrip2>(1Sam. 8)I Sam. 8</scrip>, <scrip2>(2Sam. 7)II Sam. 7</scrip>, <scrip2>(2Kings 17)II Kings 17</scrip>, <scrip2>(Neh. 9:1-38)Neh. 9</scrip>, and <scrip2>(Ps. 78:1-72)Ps. 78</scrip>; and most of Deuteronomy is rhetorically grounded in it). The entire structure and emotional force of biblical law rest upon such exhortations as “A sojourner you are not to oppress:/you yourselves know [well] the feelings of the sojourner,/for sojourners were you in the land of Egypt” (<scrip2>Ex. 23:9</scrip>) and such situations as that of the Hebrew serf (<scrip2>Ex. 21:2</scrip>ff.). Apparently the experience of the exodus period was crucial in forming the group consciousness of the Israelites, and ever since it has provided a model from which both later Judaism and Christianity were to draw frequently and profoundly.	A hypothetical analogy, based on American history, may help to shed light on the historicity of Exodus. Imagine a book based on the following outline: first, a section on the American Revolution, with some biographical material on a few of the Founding Fathers, focusing mostly on the outbreak of the war and key battles; second, a description of the Constitutional Convention, including some of the more important speeches and discussions; third, the text of the Constitution itself; and finally, L’Enfant’s original blueprints for the building of the new capital, Washington, D.C., interspersed with accounts of the first few presidents’ inaugural addresses. What would be the underlying message of such a book? We are certainly dealing here with more than a straight journalistic description of the events, more than a legalistic discussion of constitutional law, and more than a technical presentation for architects. Such a book would actually be presenting the ideals of America’s self-image: a nation founded on the willingness to fight for particular rights against Old World tyranny, established under democratic laws based on reason and providing governmental checks and balances, and whose ideals would be embodied in the construction of a brand-new, centrally located capital city that used classically grounded forms of architecture to express grace and reason as the basis for the new society.	Now this portrayal is very simplistic, but it gets its point across (and I would be willing to wager that, somewhere in this country, there exists a school textbook written along these lines). In a similar manner, although with much more weight given to God’s role in the process, the book of Exodus unfolds. The dramatic story of Israel’s deliverance from bondage, coupled with Moshe’s own early development, is only the first part of the book, and accounts for less than half of it. It is followed by several stories of desert wanderings, and then by a presentation of the covenant made between God and Israel at Sinai, against a stunning natural backdrop. The second half of the book enumerates a series of laws which constitute the covenant, and the details of construction of a portable sanctuary designed both to symbolize and actually to accommodate God’s presence among the Israelites (with the interruption of a major rebellion). So, like our theoretical American model, Exodus conveys far more than information about events. It is, rather, the narration of a worldview, a laying out of different types of texts bearing the <i>meaning <style>of Israel’s historical experience.	I stress the word “experience” because that is what is at stake here. Human memory is always selective. We remember what we wish to remember, giving weight to particular emotions, sometimes over and above the facts (or, as the poet Maya Angelou puts it autobiographically, “The facts sometimes obscure the truth”). The same thing appears to be true of group memory. What a people remembers of substance is not nearly as important as how they process their experience.	In our Exodus text one can perceive a characteristically Israelite process at work. The book emerges as a mix of historical recollection, mythical processing, and didactic retelling, what Buber and others have called a “saga.” What is preserved in the book of Exodus, therefore, is a Teaching (Heb. <i>Tora<style>) based on a set of experiences, which became history for ancient Israel. Hence, to understand better the workings of the book, we need to turn to its themes and its structure. This will be more fruitful than trying to find the exact location of the Sea of Reeds or Mount Sinai, or the “Lost Ark,” or Moshe’s burial site— of whose location “no man has knowledge until this day” (<scrip2>Deut. 34:6</scrip>). These have all receded into archeological oblivion. What has survived of ancient Israel is its approach to history and to life, and its literature. In that sense, the book of Exodus is an attempt to distill history and to learn from it, using echoes from the past to shape the present and the future.	When we turn to a closer consideration of the structure of Exodus, we must proceed on the assumption that a work of art stems from both artful and unconscious design. Therefore, any structuring of such a book can only be hypothetical and must not limit itself to ironclad categories.	With that said, a number of potential divisions of our book present themselves. The first emerges from a close look at the subject matter of the text. Strikingly, Exodus appears to be arranged in groups of a few chapters each (bearing in mind that the chapter divisions are historically late), resulting in the following scheme:<align=40>	1. Prologue in Egypt (Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)1</scrip>)<align=40>	2. Moshe’s Early Life and Call (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)2–4</scrip>)<align=40>	3. Moshe’s Mission in Egypt (<scrip>(Exodus)5:1–7:13</scrip>)<align=40>	4. The First Nine Plagues (<scrip>(Exodus)7:14–10:29</scrip>)<align=40>	5. The Tenth Plague and the Exodus (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)11–13</scrip>)<align=40>	6. In the Wilderness I: The Deliverance at the Sea (<scrip>(Exodus)14:1–15:21</scrip>)<align=40>	7. In the Wilderness II: Early Experiences (<scrip>(Exodus)15:22–18:27</scrip>)<align=40>	8. Covenant at Sinai (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)19–20</scrip>)<align=40>	9. The Terms (Laws) and Conclusion of the Covenant (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)21–24</scrip>) 10.<align=60>	Details of the Tabernacle (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)25–27</scrip>)<align=40>	11. Details of the Cult (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)28–31</scrip>)<align=40>	12. Rebellion and Reconciliation (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)32–34</scrip>)<align=40>	13. The Building of the Tabernacle, Priestly Vestments (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)35–39</scrip>)<align=40>	14. Conclusion (Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)40</scrip>)<align=0><font12><content>Such a measured shifting of focus helps to maintain the flow of the text and our interest in it.	A glance through this list will also lead to the positing of larger structures. The traditions collected in Exodus fall naturally into both geographical and thematic divisions. The first part of the book takes place in Egypt (<scrip>(Exodus)1:1–15:21</scrip>), the second in the wilderness (<scrip>(Exodus)15:22–40:38</scrip>); this could alternatively be viewed as the events preceding Mount Sinai (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)1–17</scrip>/18) and those that take place there (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)18</scrip>/19–40). One could also combine the geographical and thematic aspects, resulting in the structure (1) Israel in Egypt (<scrip>(Exodus)1:1–15:21</scrip>), (2) Israel in the Wilderness (<scrip>(Exodus)15:22–24:18</scrip>), and (3) Tabernacle and Calf (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)25–40</scrip>).	My own preference for structuring Exodus also combines these aspects, as follows:	<align=30>	I. The Deliverance Narrative (<scrip>(Exodus)1:1–15:21</scrip> )	<align=30>	II. In the Wilderness (<scrip>(Exodus)15:22–18:27</scrip>)	<align=30>	III. Covenant and Law (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)19–24</scrip>)	<align=30>	IV. The Blueprints for the Tabernacle and Its Service (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)25–31</scrip>)	<align=30>	V. Infidelity and Reconciliation (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)32–34</scrip>)	<align=30>	VI. The Building of the Tabernacle (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)35–40</scrip>)<align=0><font12><content>These divisions exhibit a great deal of overlapping. In Part I, Israel’s life in Egypt (Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)1</scrip>) paves the way for Moshe’s early years (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)2–4</scrip>), then the account of his mission before Pharaoh and the Plagues (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)5–13</scrip>), and the final victory (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)14–15</scrip>); Part II is anticipated by some of what happens after the exodus itself (Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)14</scrip>), and leads to Sinai (Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)19</scrip>); the covenant and laws of Part III naturally lead to other prescriptions, this time the building instructions for the Tabernacle (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)25–31</scrip>); planning the sacred structure in Part IV is followed by the making of a forbidden construction, the Golden Calf (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)32–33</scrip>); and the reconciliation between God and Israel (Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)34</scrip>) restores Israel’s capacity to return to the actual building of the Tabernacle, and to complete it (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)35–40</scrip>). So despite the presence of what must have been several very diverse traditions behind the final text of Exodus, it has been skillfully woven together to form a coherent whole. In addition to the above structures, it can be said that the book of Exodus rests on several textual backbones, inner structures and recurring themes and motifs that help to create a unified work. These may be listed by category:		1. There are various climaxes which serve to highlight the action—the Encounter at the Bush (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)3–4</scrip>), the Tenth Plague and Exodus (<scrip>(Exodus)12:29–42</scrip>), the Deliverance at the Sea (14–15:21), the Revelation at Sinai (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)19–20</scrip>), the Calf Episode (Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)32</scrip>), and Completion of the Tabernacle (Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)40</scrip>). Anchoring these dramatic scenes, at the center of the book, is the Sinai Revelation. The Binding of Yitzhak (Isaac) in Chapter 22 of Genesis serves much the same focusing function.		2. There exist three strategically placed accounts of God’s Presence accompanying the Israelites (<scrip>(Exodus)13:21–22</scrip>, <scrip>(Exodus)24:15–18</scrip>, <scrip>(Exodus)40:34–38</scrip>) which share a common vocabulary. Key words in these passages are “day/night,” “cloud,” “fire,” “dwell,” “Glory,” “cover,” “go up,” and “in the eyes of the Children of Israel/before the people” (it should be noted that not every passage uses all of these terms). These words chart God’s movement: first, following the Exodus; second, following the concluding of the covenant; and third, following the erection of the Tabernacle, at the end of the book. A variation of these Presence accounts occurs in Numbers <scrip>(Exodus)9:15–23</scrip>, where it rounds out the picture—for it is at this point that the Israelites finally depart from Sinai (having spent about a year there), on their journey toward the Promised Land.		3. Several leading words recur throughout the book and give it a sense of unity: <i>	serve<style>— The Israelites pass from “servitude” to Pharaoh into the “service” of God; laws are given that warn against “serving” other gods, that specify how a “serf” is to be treated, and that detail the “service” (i.e., construction and dismantling) of a sanctuary where God is to be properly “served.” <i>	Glory<style>—Liberated from Pharaoh’s “stubbornness” (Heb. <i>koved lev<style>), the Israelites experience God’s “Glory” (Heb. <i>kavod<style>) at the Sea of Reeds, and encounter it again at Sinai (Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)24</scrip>) and when the Tabernacle is completed (Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)40</scrip>). When Israel falters in Chapter 32, Moses begs to see God’s “Glory” as a sign of reassurance. This is one of the central issues of the book, receiving its clearest formulation in Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)17:7</scrip>—“Is <p.small>Yhwh</p.small> in our midst, or not?” Without the accompanying Presence, the Israelites can survive neither in Egypt nor in the wilderness. That the book ends with the “Glory” taking up residence in the Tabernacle is a sign that all is well in this regard. <i>	know<style>—The Plagues and the liberation take place so that Egyptian and Israelite alike will acknowledge God as the true ruler (who “knows” the slaves’ sufferings). The book as a whole portrays a God who is “known” by his compassion toward the oppressed. <i>	see<style>—God “sees” and rescues the people early in the book (Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)3</scrip>); they “see” his deliverance at the sea (Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)14</scrip>) and the awesome display at Sinai (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)19–20</scrip>); the Tabernacle blueprint is given to Moshe to “see” (Chaps 25ff.).		4. Aside from theme words, there are also several thematic threads that run through the book. These may be listed as well: <i>	distinction<style>—The Israelites learn what it is to be separated out, first for oppression and later for God’s service. This process occurs during the Plagues and throughout the legal sections, which are often based on the making of distinctions (the Hebrew word for “holy,” <i>kadosh,<style> may originally have had this connotation). In general, Exodus is a book that abounds in polarities and distinctions: between God and Pharaoh, life and death, slavery and freedom, Egyptianness and Israeliteness, city and wilderness, visible gods/magic and an invisible God who is not conjurable, doubt and trust. <i>	construction<style>—The Israelites are enslaved as builders of Egyptian cities; they go on to build a society, a calf-god, and a Tabernacle. <i>	rebellion<style>—From the beginning, God and Moshe are often unheeded, as the Israelites seek to maintain or return to their status as dependent slaves in Egypt (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)2</scrip>, <scrip2>5</scrip>, <scrip2>14</scrip>, <scrip2>15–17</scrip>, <scrip2>32</scrip>). <i>	Sabbath<style>—As a newly freed people, Israel is to adapt to a rhythm of work and sacred cessation, which celebrates both creation and freedom. The Sabbath is at issue immediately after liberation (Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)16</scrip>) and is commanded three times (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)20</scrip>, <scrip2>31</scrip>, <scrip2>35</scrip>); and the account of the Tabernacle’s completion echoes the vocabulary of God’s completed creation in <scrip2>Genesis 2</scrip>, a passage which serves as one justification for observing the Sabbath (see <scrip2>Ex. 20:11</scrip>). <i>	origins<style>—We are told of the beginnings of the new covenant (distinct from that concluded with Abraham), the law system, the cult/priesthood, and the sacred calendar, but with the significant omission of the monarchy. <i>	covenant<style>—God establishes a relationship with the people of Israel: if they will obey him and observe his laws, he will protect them and treat them as his “firstborn son.” This form of covenant is different from the ones in Genesis, and plays a significant role in subsequent books of the Bible. <i>	God in History<style>—The God of Exodus actively intervenes to rescue a people, defeating their oppressors in battle; he leads them through the wilderness, meets them, and makes a covenant with them.		5. The above themes are specifically Israelite themes. There are, however, motifs in Exodus that have a more universal ring. One could term these anthropological, since they employ standard aspects of human experience to convey the overall messages of the book.	<i>Fire<style> is used frequently and in varied contexts (at the Burning Bush and later back at Mount Sinai, in the desert trek, in the Tabernacle service, and at the Calf incident), usually to make a statement about God. In contrast to conventional fire gods (e.g., the Norse trickster Loki), the God of Exodus is most often associated with the more positive aspects of fire: constancy, purity, and transformation. The fire at Sinai does not destroy Moshe and the people, but rather turns them into something new. At the same time it should not be forgotten that fire is used regularly to connote anger in the Bible, especially God’s, and especially in the later wilderness narratives.	<i>Water<style> appears throughout Exodus, not as a backdrop but as an active medium which most often signifies life and death simultaneously. The Nile, into which the enslaved Hebrews’ babies are thrown, gently bears the infant Moshe to safety: the Nile, the giver of life in Egypt, is changed into blood, itself a major signifier of life in the Bible but useless here because it is undrinkable; the Sea of Reeds acts as a passageway of birth for the Israelites but as a graveyard for their Egyptian pursuers. The availability of water becomes a central issue in the wilderness, as an instrument for survival and for the testing of the Israelites’ faith. Finally, water creates the ritual purity necessary for the people at Sinai and their priests in the Tabernacle to approach God.	<i>Desert/Wilderness<style> is the scene of the crucial second part of the book. Only in the desert, away from the massive influence of age-old Egyptian culture, can the new Israelite society be forged. Moshe, like many other real-life and fictional heroes, demonstrates this in his own early life. The desert acts as a purifying agent for him, changing the Egyptian prince into a member of his own true people. Similarly, the Israelites begin the process of transformation from bondage to self-rule, a process which is taught in the harsh reality of desert life and which will take an entire generation to complete.	In point of fact, all these media—fire, water, and desert—suggest change as a major concern of the book of Exodus. Our text chronicles the start of Israel’s journey as a nation, a transformative journey which takes vastly changed circumstances, a whole generation in time, and indeed several books of recounting to complete. Exodus is very concerned with topography—not for the purposes of historical recollection (as Genesis was, apparently) but as an account of an inner journey. Thus the people travel to the boundary between Egypt and the desert, through the sea, to the great fiery mountain; and we know that they cannot but be on their way to a final goal. That goal, the Promised Land, will not be realized in Exodus, because in this book we stand only at the beginning of the journey. Change does not occur quickly, and the true molding of a people, like that of an individual, requires formative experiences over time. In Exodus, then, the People of Israel begins in adolescence, as it were. It has survived infancy in Genesis, a period marked by constant threats of physical extinction, and must now begin the tortuous process of learning to cope with adulthood—that is to say, peoplehood—in a hostile world.<align=0><font12><content>	That process will take us past the present text. Exodus stands at the beginning of a trilogy in the middle of the Torah. It takes us from slavery up to Sinai, inaugurating the law-giving process. Leviticus will concentrate almost exclusively on laws (of “holiness”), never budging geographically, while Numbers will see the conclusion of the Sinai experience and the traveling toward (and actually reaching) the land of Israel. Exodus is thus of great importance in the overall five-book pattern, introducing key elements of the wilderness books: law, institutions, rebellion, and—Moshe himself. It serves as a bridge between the great narratives of Genesis and the priestly code of Leviticus and the wanderings of Numbers (Greenberg 1972 notes how the opening of Exodus points back, to <scrip2>Gen. 46</scrip>; and the closing points forward, to <scrip2>Num. 9</scrip>). It in fact contains elements of all three books.	Exodus is the basis not only of what follows in the Torah, but also sets the stage for the rest of the Hebrew Bible. What Israel understood of its God, and what that God expects of them, are set forth most directly and unforgettably in the memories enshrined in the book of Exodus.<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b_caps>PART I<br><br>The Deliverance Narrative<style><br><br><style>(<scrip1>(Exodus)1–15:21<content>)<align=0><font12><content><p.small>The first part of the book of Exodus is presented as a continuation of the </p.small>Genesis narratives, by abbreviating the genealogy of the immigrant Yaakov from <scrip2>Gen. 46:8–25</scrip>. We find here the same centrality of God, the same kind of sparse but powerful biographical sketch of the human hero, and a narrative style similar to that of the previous book.	And yet Exodus introduces a new and decisive element into the Hebrew Bible, which becomes paradigmatic for future generations of biblical writers. The book speaks of a God who acts directly in history, blow by blow—a God who promises, liberates, guides, and gives laws to a people. This is, to be sure, an outgrowth of a God who brings the Flood and disperses the Babel generation, but it is also a decisive step forward from a God who works his will in the background, through intrafamily conflicts (which comprise most of Genesis). This deity frees his people, not by subterfuge, but by directly taking on Egypt and its gods. Pharaoh and the Nile, both of which were considered divine in Egypt, are in the end forced to yield to superior power. Surely it is no accident that the ending of Part I—the Song of Moshe at the Sea—hails <p.small>Yhwh</p.small> as Israel’s true king, a king whose acts of “leading,” “redeeming,” and “planting” his people are exultingly affirmed in the body of the Song.	Part I receives its structural coherence in a number of ways. For one, it encompasses a straight chronological narrative, moving from Israel’s enslavement to its liberation and triumph over its oppressors. The ending, Chapter 15, is rhetorically and stylistically fitting (see Gaster 1969), celebrating as it does the mighty deeds of God. For another, Part I carefully paces its climaxes, building up from the Burning Bush to various stages of Plagues, to the Tenth Plague/exodus and finally the great scene at the sea. There are also a number of key words that help to tie together various sections of the narratives: “know,” “serve,” and “see.” All of these go through interesting changes in meaning, through which one can trace the movement of central ideas (see the Commentary).	In the area of vocabulary, David Daube (1963) has made the interesting observation that the Deliverance Narrative uses a number of verbs that occur regularly in biblical law regarding the formal release of a slave: “send free” (Heb. <i>shale’ah<style>), “drive out” (<i>garesh<style>), and “go out” (<i>yatzo’<style>). In addition, the motif of the Israelites’ “stripping” the Egyptians (<scrip>(Exodus)3:22</scrip>, <scrip>(Exodus)12:36</scrip>) links up with the regulation of release in <scrip2>Deut. 15:13</scrip>. “. . . you are not to send him free empty-handed.” Daube sees our text as bearing the stamp of Israelite social custom: Pharaoh is made to flout “established social regulations.”	Finally, several scholars (Kikawada, Ackerman 1974, Fishbane 1979, and Isbell) have pointed out that the vocabulary of the first few chapters of the book foreshadows the whole of Part I. This use of sound and idea helps to create unity in these narratives (despite their possibly diverse origins), and is also of importance in viewing the biographical material in the first four chapters.<h2><p=art><align=1><title><font12><b_caps>The Early Life of Moshe and Religious Biography<style><align=0><font12><content>Dominating the early chapters of Exodus, more than the description of bondage itself, is the figure of the reluctant liberator, Moshe. The portrayal of his beginnings contrasts strongly with the classic hero stories of the ancient world.	This is not immediately apparent. Moshe’s birth narrative parallels that of King Sargon of Akkad; his flight from Egypt and return as leader are reminiscent of Jephthah and David in the Bible, and of the Syrian king Idrimi (as recounted in Akkadian texts) as well. In addition, half a century ago Lord Raglan attempted to demonstrate common elements in hero biographies by compiling a list of up to thirty key motifs. Those relevant to Moshe include: the father a relative of the mother, an attempt made to kill him at birth, his escape through the action of others, being raised by foster parents, little information about his childhood, his traveling to his “future kingdom” upon reaching adulthood, promulgating laws, losing favor with the deity, dying on the top of a hill, not being succeeded by his children, and a hazy death/burial. Moshe therefore shares with Oedipus, Hercules, Siegfried, and Robin Hood, among others, a host of common elements; his point total according to Raglan’s scheme puts him toward the top of the list as an archetypal traditional hero. It must be concluded that, far from being a factual account, his biography is composed largely of literary constructs.	When one looks closer at the biblical portrayal of Moshe, however, the purpose and particularly Israelite thrust of these constructs becomes clear. Almost every key element in Moshe’s early life—e.g., rescue from death by royal decree, rescue from death by water, flight into the desert, meeting with God on the sacred mountain—foreshadows Israel’s experience in the book of Exodus. The key theme of the distinction between Israel and Egypt, so central to the Plague Narrative and to Israelite religion as a whole, is brought out beautifully in the depiction of Moshe’s development from Egyptian prince to would-be liberator to shepherd in the wilderness, the latter an ancestral calling (cf. Nohrnberg, who also discusses Yosef as developing in exactly the opposite direction—from Israelite shepherd boy to Egyptian viceroy, complete with Egyptian appearance, wife, and name). What is important in these early chapters of Exodus, then, is not the customary focus on the young hero’s deeds (e.g., Hercules strangling serpents in the cradle) or his fatal flaw (although there is a hint of this too!), but on what he shares with his people, or, more precisely, how he prefigures them.	Another aspect of these stories removes them from the usual realm of heroic biography. Elsewhere in the Bible, individual hero types are at least partially overshadowed by the true central “character”: God. This appears to be true in Exodus as well. Moshe develops only so far; he recedes as a full-blown personality during the Plague Narrative, to emerge sporadically in later encounters with the people (e.g., Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)16</scrip> and <scrip2>32</scrip>–33; the portrait expands in the narratives of the book of Numbers). No wonder that later Jewish legend (and further, Christian and Muslim stories as well) found it necessary to fill in the tantalizing hints left by the biblical biographer, with sometimes fantastic tales. But in the Exodus text, it is God who holds sway. In this context, one is reminded that Israelite thinking had room neither for worship of human heroes nor interest in the biography of God (i.e., divine birth and marriage) on the model of surrounding cultures. The biblical portrayal of both God and Moshe has been reduced in our book to only such facts as will illuminate the relationship between Israel and its God. Thus we learn from the Moshe of Exodus much about the people themselves, and about prophecy (cf. Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)3–4</scrip>); from the God of Exodus, how he acts in history and what he demands of the people. More than that is not easily forthcoming from our text (interestingly, the Passover Haggadah picked up on the Bible’s direction and all but omitted Moshe’s name in the celebration of the holiday).	As we have suggested, later Jewish legend—some of which may actually be of great antiquity—sought to fill in various aspects of Moshe’s life that are missing from the Exodus text. A perusal of Ginzberg will uncover rich legendary material, dealing with Moshe’s childhood, family identity, experience in Midyan and elsewhere as a hero. While this material does not always illuminate the biblical story, it does demonstrate how folk belief includes a need for heroes in the classic Raglan mold; the Midrashic portrait of Moshe corresponds nicely to what we find in other cultures.	Turning to stylistic characteristics of these early chapters, we may note that a good deal of repetition occurs, as if further to highlight the themes. Baby Moshe is saved from death twice; three times he attempts acts of opposing oppression; twice (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)2</scrip> and <scrip2>5</scrip>) he fails in his attempts to help his enslaved brothers; and twice (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)3</scrip> and <scrip2>6</scrip>) God reassures him with long speeches that center around the Divine Name. This kind of continuity is artfully literary, but it is also an echo of real life, where people often live out certain themes in patterns.	Finally there is the matter of recurring words. Most important is the telling use of “see,” from the loving gaze of Moshe’s mother (<scrip>(Exodus)2:2</scrip>), through to the auspicious glance of Pharaoh’s daughter (<scrip>(Exodus)2:6</scrip>), then to Moshe’s sympathetic observing of his brothers’ plight (<scrip>(Exodus)2:11</scrip>); all this seems to be linked to the episode at the Burning Bush, where God “is seen” by the future leader (<scrip>(Exodus)3:2</scrip>), and where the climax of this whole development takes place: God affirms that he has “seen, yes, seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt. . . . and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them” (<scrip>(Exodus)3:7</scrip>, <scrip2>9</scrip>). Thus Moshe’s biography leads to, and is an outgrowth of, the people’s own situation.	In sum, Moshe’s early biography leads us to ponder the “growing up” process through which the people of Israel must pass on their way out of Egypt. The narratives that deal with his leadership of the people in the wilderness period, from <scrip2>Ex. 16</scrip> on, will help to round out our picture of him as a real personality, with the tragedies and triumphs that are a part of human life but magnified in the case of great individuals.<h2><p=art><align=1><title><font12><b_caps>On the Journey Motif<style><align=0><font12><content>World literature is dominated by stories involving a journey. More often than not, these tales are framed as quests for holy or magical objects (e.g., the Holy Grail), or for eternal youth/immortality (Gilgamesh). The classic pattern, as Joseph Campbell has described it, calls for the hero to make a kind of round trip, crossing dangerous thresholds (monsters, giants, unfriendly supernatural beings) both on the way toward the goal and on the way home. Either at the middle or at the end of the journey stands the goal, which often entails meeting with the divine and/or obtaining a magical or life-giving object (e.g., the Golden Fleece).	Such stories mirror our own longings for accomplishment and acceptance, as well as our universal desire to overcome the ultimate enemy, Death. In the hero’s triumphs, we triumph; his vanquishing of death cathartically becomes our own.	This mythic substructure has penetrated the biblical tales, but it has been toned down for human protagonists, to suppress the idea of the mortal hero in favor of the divine one. Thus all the Patriarchs except Yitzhak (Isaac) go on fateful long journeys (his is reserved for the three-day trip to Moriah in <scrip2>Gen. 22</scrip>), yet there is none of the color and adventure that we find, for example, in Greek mythology. Outside of Yaakov’s encounter with the mysterious wrestler in <scrip2>Gen. 32</scrip>, there is little in Genesis to suggest hero tales on the classic mold. In Exodus, too, Moshe makes a significant journey—to Midyan—one might say, within himself, to find his true identity and calling, but it is highly muted, containing virtually no details. The round trip contains two thresholds of death, with Moshe first threatened by Pharaoh’s justice (<scrip>(Exodus)2:15</scrip>) and, on the way back to Egypt, by God himself (<scrip>(Exodus)4:24–26</scrip>). The initial goal is attained at the “mountain of God” “behind the wilderness,” where, meeting with divinity amid fire, he is finally able to integrate his own past, present, and future (as he will return to this mountain with the entire people in Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)19</scrip>ff). At the Burning Bush, the Egyptian prince, the Israelite shepherd, and the Hebrew liberator coalesce, investing Moshe with unique qualifications for his task.	But it is to a larger journey framework that we must look to understand the “hero” content of Exodus, and with it, that of the Torah as a whole. The major journey undertaken is, of course, that of the people of Israel, from slavery to Promised Land. It is also a journey from death to life, from servitude to god-king to the service of God as king; along the way, death serves to purify an entire generation. And yet even this most obvious of journey stories differs markedly from those of gods and heroes so familiar in Western culture. The people of Israel function as a collective antihero, an example of precisely how <i>not<style> to behave. They play no active role whatsoever in their own liberation, use neither brawn nor wits to survive in the wilderness, constantly grumble about wanting to return to Egypt, and at both Sinai and the threshold of the Promised Land (in the book of Numbers), their chief form of behavior is first fear and later rebellion.	Moshe’s own journeys parallel those of the entire people later on. Like them, he flees from Pharaoh into the wilderness, meets God at flaming Sinai, and has trouble accepting his task but must in the end. Here is where Moshe shines as the true leader: he epitomizes his people’s experience and focuses and forges it into something new.<h2><p=art><align=1><title><font12><b_caps>Moshe Before Pharaoh: The Plague Narrative<style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)5–11<content>)<align=0><font12><content>The heart of the Exodus story sets out the confrontation between the visible god-king, Pharaoh, who embodies the monumental culture of Egypt, and the invisible God of Israel who fights for his ragtag people. The drama is conveyed by means of alternating conversations/confrontations and events. The narrator has built his account, bracketed by the early approach of Moshe and Aharon (Aaron) to Pharaoh, which fails (Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)5</scrip>), and the extended construct of the Tenth Plague (11–13); in between fall the schematically arranged first nine plagues.	Three overall stages characterize this latter section. The first is indicated by the oft-repeated demand, “Send free my people, that they may serve me!”; the second is the “hardening” of Pharaoh’s heart; and the third, the unleashing of each plague. Further, it can be shown that the plagues are presented via a variety of structures and substructures (see Greenberg 1969 and the chart in Sarna 1986). Some commentators divide them into five thematic groups of two apiece—1 and 2, the Nile; 3 and 4, insects; 5 and 6, disease; 7 and 8, airborne disaster; and 9 and 10, darkness/death (Plaut). Also fruitful is the following threefold division: 1, 4, and 7, God’s command to confront Pharaoh in the morning; 2, 5, and 8, God says, “Come to Pharaoh”; 3, 6, and 9, no warning is given to Pharaoh. Yet another grouping of themes is possible (Bar Efrat): 1–3, God vs. the magicians of Egypt; 4–6, stress on the distinction between Israel and Egypt; 7–9, the most powerful plagues.	This utilization of order, symbolized by “perfect” numbers such as 3 and 10, finds a parallel in the creation story of <scrip2>Genesis 1</scrip> (where the key number, of course, is 7, 3 + 3 + 1, whereas here we have 3 + 3 + 3 + 1). Both texts display a desire to depict God as one who endows nature and history with meaning. The poetic tradition about the plagues, as represented, for instance, by <scrip2>(Ps. 78:1-72)Psalm 78</scrip>, was content to describe the plagues in brief, within the setting of a single poem. The narrator of the Pentateuchal traditions, however, has a different point to make, and structured exposition is the best way to do it.	There is another structural tendency that one may observe in the Plague Narrative. Repeating words and motifs comprise over twenty shared and discrete elements in the story. Since the vast majority of these occur by the end of the fourth plague, this leaves the narrator free to develop plagues 7 and 8 with particular intensity, using a full palette of descriptions, with the addition of the theme that these were the worst of their kind ever to take place in Egypt. It will be useful here to list a few of the key words and phrases, and motifs, that can be found in the Plague Narrative:	<i>Words/phrases:<style> Go to Pharaoh; send . . . free; know; throughout the land of Egypt; plead; distinguish; tomorrow; man and beast; not one remained; heavy [i.e., severe] as <p.small>Yhwh</p.small> had said.	<i>Motifs:<style> Moshe’s staff; Aharon as agent; magicians; death.	It is important to note here that the structuring of the plagues is not a perfectly balanced one. The narrative varies between exact repetition of elements and phrases and nonrepetition (Licht). By thus using sounds and ideas in variation, the narrator is able to weave a tale whose message constantly reinforces itself, and which holds the audience’s attention without getting tedious.	I have deliberately omitted the question of Pharaoh’s heart above, as a separate issue. A host of expressions is used in the text to describe Pharaoh’s stubbornness: “harden” (Heb. <i>hiksha<style>), “make heavy-with-stubbornness” (<i>hakhbed<style>), and “strengthen” (<i>hehezik/hazzek<style>), with the resultant “refused” and “did not hearken.” This motif is the only one that occurs in all nine plagues, and therefore stands at the very heart of our narrative. When one notes the pattern within—that Pharaoh does the hardening at the beginning, God at the end—the intent begins to become clear. The Plague Narrative is a recounting of God’s power, and Pharaoh’s stubbornness, which starts out as a matter of will, eventually becomes impossible to revoke. The model is psychologically compelling: Pharaoh becomes trapped by his own refusal to accept the obvious (in biblical parlance, to “know”). Despite the prophetic idea that human beings can be forgiven, we find here another one—that evil leads to more evil, and can become petrified and unmovable.	A final note about the backdrop of these stories. Cecil B. DeMille did it differently, and in the difference lies the gap between Western culture and biblical culture. In the movie <i>The Ten Commandments<style> (a strange title, given the actual content of the film!), DeMille’s own 1956 remake of his earlier silent film, great stress is put on the physical, visual trappings of Pharoah’s court. Apparently no expense was spared to bring in costumes, sets, and extras, and the result causes the audience to focus on the splendor of Egyptian culture, despite the fact that it is peopled by the villains of the story. In contrast, the Bible says practically nothing about the visual backdrop of the Plague Narrative. Just as Genesis made reference to the mighty culture of Babylonia by parodying it (for instance, in the Babel story of Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)11</scrip>), Exodus strips down Egyptian culture by making it disappear, and by ridiculing its gods. The book saves descriptive minutiae for the Tabernacle (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)25</scrip>ff.), preferring to stress the positive and simply to omit what it found as negative. This profoundly “anticultural” stance (see the intriguing analysis by Schneidau) was characteristic of Israel’s worldview and was a mystery to the Greeks and Romans who centuries later conquered the land; it was to stand the people of Israel in good stead in their wanderings through the centuries.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Prologue in Egypt<content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)1<content>): Rather than being presented as a totally separate story, the book of Exodus opens as a continuation of the Genesis saga. This is true both specifically and generally: the first five verses echo and compress the information about the descent of Yaakov’s family into Egypt that was given in <scrip2>Gen. 46:8–27</scrip>, while “Now these are the names” (v.1) recalls the oft-repeated formula “Now these are the begettings,” which forms the structural background of Genesis. At the same time one might note that the main subject matter of our chapter, life and death (or, threatened continuity), is central to the thematic content of Genesis (see my <i>At the Beginning, <style>“On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure”).	Kikawada and Ackerman (1974) have shown that the opening chapters of Exodus reflect other Genesis material as well. For instance, the five verbs in v.7 mirror the language of creation (<scrip2>Gen. 1:28</scrip> and <scrip>(Exodus)9:1–2</scrip>), where a similar vocabulary of fecundity signals the divine desire to “fill the earth.” It is as if Israel’s “becoming many” in Exodus fulfills the plan of history inaugurated at creation, at the same time reminding us of God’s promise to Avraham, to make his descendants as numerous “as the stars of the heavens and [as] the sand that is on the shore of the sea” (<scrip2>Gen. 22:17</scrip>).	This leads to the predominant issue of Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)1</scrip>: Pharaoh’s paranoid fears about Israel’s growth. What for God was a sign of blessing (cf. the “swarming” of creatures in <scrip2>Gen. 1:20</scrip>f.) is for Pharaoh a sign of disaster, a feeling of being overwhelmed by what is alien. The birth of the Israelite nation is thus placed in a vivid context, completely physical in its description. And because birth, and not the economic aspects of slavery, is central, the actual description of the oppression of the Hebrews has been reduced to a bare minimum here. Contrary to DeMille’s spectacular and stereotyped portrayal of the Israelites’ sufferings, the Bible limits itself to a few brief verses in the early chapters of the book. The same holds true for parallel depictions of bondage in biblical literature, such as <scrip2>(Ps. 78:1-72)Psalms 78</scrip> and <scrip2>(Ps. 105:1-45)105</scrip>. It is the experience of being a stranger in Egypt that the Bible has chosen to focus on, rather than on the horrors of slave labor.	In Exodus, the Egyptians cannot stand having aliens among them (this theme has already appeared in Genesis regarding their eating habits—see <scrip2>Gen. 43:32</scrip>); they dread their presence and fear their increase. A natural plan of attack, to stem the human tide, is genocide. Ironically, because of his fear of war Pharaoh concentrates his worries around the males, ignoring the true source of fecundity. And it is the women in these chapters, as many commentators have pointed out (see Exum), who play the major role in beginning the liberation process. The midwives accomplish a successful coverup; Moshe’s mother and sister, and Pharaoh’s daughter, save the future liberator’s life. “If she be a daughter, she may live” (v.16), along with four other occurrences of “live” in vv.17–22, underscore the irony and the certainty of Israelite survival. The use of women—a group that was often powerless in ancient societies—in these stories makes the eventual victory of the Israelites all the more striking from a traditional patriarchal point of view (see Ackerman 1982); the motif returns a number of times in Israelite literature, as with Jael and Judith.	Failing in his commissioning of special agents (midwives) to carry out his genocidal plan, Pharaoh finally must enlist “all his people” (v.22), and shift the scene to a cosmic setting, the Nile. The stage is thus set for the birth, endangering, and rescue of Moshe.	The historically minded reader may ask: Why would the ruler of a society that is (literally) built on slavery destroy his own workforce? Two answers are possible. First, the story is tied to Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)2</scrip>, the survival of Moshe, and thus must be told to that end (a threat to males). Second, the story does not describe a rational fear, but paranoia—paralleling the situation in Nazi Germany of the 1930s and 1940s, where Jews were blamed for various economic and political catastrophes not of their own making and were eliminated from a society that could have used their resources and manpower.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Moshe’s Birth and Early Life <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)2:1–22<content>): Picking up from the last phrase of Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)1</scrip>, “let every daughter live,” Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)2</scrip> opens as a story of three daughters (the word occurs six times here), Moshe’s real and foster mothers, and his sister.	It has long been maintained that the story of Moshe’s birth is a classic “birth of the hero” tale, sharing many features with other heroes of antiquity. (See p. 250.) The parallel most often drawn is that of Sargon of Akkad, whose birth story is set in an era before Moshe but was written down later; similar elements include being separated from the real parents through a death threat, and being set adrift on the river. Hallo cites other parallels in Hittite and Egyptian literature, noting at the same time that “none of them includes all of the elements of the Moses birth legend.”	If, as I maintained in the introduction (“On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure”), most of this material has been collected for didactic and not for historical purposes, we are entitled to ask what this story was intended to teach. It cannot simply be written off as an attempt to explain away Moshe’s name and origins. Two elements seem crucial. First, the text as we have it centers around the activity of women—giving birth, hiding, watching and adopting Moshe. The female principle of life-giving triumphs over the male prerogatives of threatening and death-dealing; the Nile, source of all life in Egypt, births another child. Second, the story and its continuation to the end of the chapter set up Moshe as a man of two sides: Hebrew and Egyptian. He is at once archetypal victim (of Pharaoh’s death decree) and archetypal collaborator, growing up, as he apparently does, in Pharaoh’s palace. What are we to make of this two-sided fate and personality? It may well have been intended as a reflex of the people of Israel itself. Often in the Hebrew Bible the hero’s life mirrors that of Israel (see Greenstein 1981), and the case of Moshe is a good example. Moshe develops into a Hebrew—that is, he eventually recovers his full identity. This is accomplished, first, through his empathy with and actions on behalf of “his brothers” (vv.11, 12), then through his exile from Egypt, and finally through the purifying life in the wilderness as a shepherd. Thus Moshe’s personality changes are wrought by means of separations, and the same process will characterize the coming Plague Narrative (with its emphasis on “distinction” between Egypt and Israel) and the entire Israelite legal and ritual system, which stresses holiness and separation.	The first section of the chapter (vv.1–10) uses a number of repeating words: “take” appears four times, indicative of divine protection; “child,” seven times (Greenberg 1969); and “see,” which as I have mentioned, will recur meaningfully in Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)3</scrip>. There is also a threefold motif of death threat in the chapter: at birth, on the Nile, and at the hand of the avenging Pharaoh. Isbell notes several items of vocabulary (e.g., “deliver,” “feared,” “amid the reeds”) that return in the victory account at the Sea of Reeds (Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)14</scrip>).	From the other two accounts here (vv.11–14 and 15–22), we learn all we need to know about Moshe’s early personality: he is Hebrew-identifying but Egyptian-looking; concerned with justice, but impetuous and violent in pursuit of that goal. It is also ominous that his first contacts with the Israelites end in rejection, since that will so often be his experience with them later on. The doubly unsatisfactory situation of confused identity and impetuous means must be rectified, and it is exile that accomplishes it. The Midyanite wilderness transforms Moshe into shepherd, foreigner, father, and seer—in short, into a son of the Patriarchs (see also “On the Journey Motif,” above).	Incredibly, the man whose activity is to span four whole books has, it seems, half his life (or, according to the chronology of <scrip>(Exodus)7:7</scrip>, two-thirds of his life!) described in a single chapter. Typical of biblical storytelling, much has been compressed and left out, but enough is told to establish the person who is to come.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>God Takes Notice <content><style>(<scrip1>(Exodus)2:23–25<content>): Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)2</scrip> ends on a note that looks forward and backward simultaneously. The fourfold “God” plus verb (vv.24–25) echo the same structure at Creation’s first day (<scrip2>Gen. 1:3–5</scrip>), and suggest that he puts his concern for the people of Israel on a par with his concern for creation of light (connoting “good” in folklore). In addition, the four verbs used here play a prominent role in the entire Deliverance Narrative, as Isbell has shown.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>At the Bush: The Call <content><style>(<scrip1>(Exodus)3:1–4:17</scrip>): The great revelation scene in these two chapters, so much a classic in the literature of the West, comes as somewhat of a surprise in the close context of our story. Nothing in Exodus so far has prepared us for such a religious, inward vision on the part of Moshe; and indeed, Genesis itself contains no meeting between God and a human being of such a dramatic character. Adam and Avraham converse with God; Yaakov experiences him, to be sure, in dreams and in the guise of a wrestler; but nowhere thus far does one find a biblical hero encountering God with such intensity and purity of vision.	The shepherd, now in the service of his father-in-law, the “priest,” comes upon the “mountain of God,” “behind the wilderness.” The results are those of an unintended or half-intended journey. Moshe, who had fled previously, finds himself at the utmost reaches of the wilderness, almost like Jonah in the bowels of the boat or of the great fish. The sight that Moshe is granted is of unclear nature, but it involves fire, with all its pregnant associations: passion, purity, light, mystery (Greenberg 1969), and here, inextinguishability.	God’s initial speech (vv.6–10) contains all the elements basic to the Deliverance Narrative: it identifies him as the ancestral deity, establishes his compassion for the oppressed people, demonstrates his resolve to rescue them, and ends with the commissioning of Moshe to be his emissary. Central here is the verb <i>see, <style>whose threefold occurrence (vv.7 and 9) ties together the threads of the previous parts of Moshe’s story (see above).	The entire scene is the model for the “call” of the biblical prophet, with its emphasis on God’s speaking to the fledgling prophet amid a vision and the motif of refusal; of the call scenes in the Bible, this is the longest and most memorable in its starkness. A man is called by God to return to society and serve as God’s spokesperson—despite any opposition he may encounter and despite his per-sonal shortcomings. Moshe’s reluctance, indeed his almost obsessive need to turn down the commission, is as much indicative of the general nature of prophecy (cf. Elijah and Jeremiah) as it is of Moshe’s own personality. The prophet must be prepared “to uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and plant” (<scrip2>Jer. 1:10</scrip>), and to stand tall against kings if necessary (<scrip2>Jer. 1:13</scrip>). So it comes as no surprise that the call is met with less than enthusiasm. And this refusal also teaches something about Israel’s political conceptions. With such a response as this, there can be no question of personal ambition or inner lust for power. The prophet does what he does out of compulsion: he is driven by forces that he perceives as external to him.	In our text, Moshe refuses the commission five times, and five times God counters. In four of these cases the assurance is given that God will be (or “be-there”) with him (<scrip>(Exodus)3:12</scrip>, <scrip2>14</scrip>; <scrip>(Exodus)4:12</scrip>, <scrip2>15</scrip>), and the use of that verb carries in its essence one of the most significant motifs of the Bush Narrative: the interpretation of God’s name.	When Moshe asks God for his name in <scrip>(Exodus)3:13</scrip>, he asks for more than a title (Buber and Rosenzweig 1994). In the context of Egyptian magic, knowing the true name of a person or a god meant that one could coerce him, or at the very least understand his true essence. Moshe foresees that the slaves will want to be able to call on this power that has promised to deliver them.	God’s answer is one of the most enigmatic and widely debated statements in the Hebrew Bible (the reader will want to consult Childs for a full bibliography). What does <i>ehyeh asher ehyeh <style>mean? One’s suspicions are aroused from the outset, for the answer is alliterative and hence already not easy to pin down; the poetics of the phrase indicate both importance and vagueness or mystery. There is some scholarly consensus that the name may mean “He who causes (things) to be” or perhaps “He who is.” Buber and Rosenzweig, taking an entirely different tack (of which one occasionally finds echoes in the scholarly literature), interpret the verb <i>hayoh <style>as signifying presence, “being-<i>there,”<style> and hence see God’s words as a real answer to the Israelites’ imagined question—an assurance of his presence. In the first edition of this book, I retained the B-R interpretation, out of a desire to follow them on at least this significant point of theology, but I have since come to feel that it goes beyond what the Hebrew suggests. In anuy event, of the several times that Moshe tries to wriggle out of his mission, God answers him all but once with the same verb, in the same meaning: “I will be with you” (note the parallel between Moshe and the people again).	It is, however, also possible that <i>ehyeh asher ehyeh<style> is a deliberately vague phrase, whose purpose is antimagical and an attempt to evade the question (Rosenzweig speaks of this as well), as if to suggest that possession of the true name cannot be used to coerce this God. In this interpretation, it would follow that, just as God is magicless (see v. 20), he is nameless, at least in the conven-tional sense of religion. On the other hand, the name Y<p.small>hwh</p.small>, however it may have been vocalized throughout the history of the text, did function as a name in ancient Israel (and possibly outside of Israel as well). It was used in oaths (e.g., <scrip2>Gen. 22:16</scrip>, <scrip2>(2Sam. 12:5)II Sam. 12:5</scrip>), and later, in the Second Temple period, limited in public pronunciation to the high priest on the Day of Atonement. As happens frequently in the history of religion, if we follow a concept long enough it transforms back to the beginning, often in an opposite meaning, and so when the use of <p.small>Yhwh</p.small> is traced through the Middle Ages one finds it turned into a magical name at the hands of Jewish mystics.	To return to the Bush Narrative as a whole: these chapters introduce a num-ber of important words that will recur throughout the enire Liberation Nar-rative. These include “trust,” “hearken to (my) voice,” “staff,” “heavy,” “go out,” “strong,” “send,” and “blood” (see Isbell). It should also be mentioned that several key words occur in multiples of 7 from <scrip>(Exodus)2:23</scrip> to <scrip>(Exodus)4:31</scrip> (Cassuto): “see” (7), “send” (7), “go” (14), “mouth” (7), “speak/word” (Heb. <i>dabber/davar;<style> 7). This vocabulary in particular focuses the story around major aspects of prophecy.	In the end, what does Moshe have with which to return from the mount of vision? In the DeMille film version his face and personality clearly change; in the biblical text, however, he comes back with a word—the divine promise—and a staff, “with which you shall do the signs” (<scrip>(Exodus)4:17</scrip>). He had previously been a man whose lack of tolerance for injustice produced violence; now he is armed with words and a wonder-working object—not a sword or a helmet, but a shepherd’s staff.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Journey Back<content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)4:18–31<content>): It is clear that something has been inserted into the normal course of our narrative. What follows v.20 should be v.27; Moshe, ready to go back to Egypt, is met by Aharon in the wilderness, and they subsequently announce their mission to the Children of Israel. However, the editor has prefaced the brothers’ meeting, first with a warning to Moshe that his mission will be strongly resisted by Pharaoh, and a warning that Moshe is to deliver to Pharaoh. Then follows a bizarre episode, which, like the Name passage discussed above, has provoked centuries of comment and attempts to explain it. What are we to make of the circumcision story here, especially the last scene, which is unclear not only in import but in details such as pronouns as well?	Buber (1988) explains it as an event that sometimes occurs in hero stories: the deity appears as “divine demon” and threatens the hero’s life. Perhaps this underlines the dangerous side of contact between the human and the divine. But there seem to be other reasons for the passage’s inclusion at this point in the text. First, it serves as an end bracket to Moshe’s sojourn in Midyan. As mentioned earlier, Moshe flees Egypt under pain of death (<scrip>(Exodus)2:15</scrip>); here, on his return, he is in mortal danger once more. Second, our passage seems to be an <i>inclusio <style>or bracketing passage for the entire Plague Narrative (Kosmala and others). This is confirmed by the use of vv.21–23 as an introduction. God, designating Israel his firstborn and alluding to the future killing of Pharaoh’s/Egypt’s firstborn sons, demonstrates his power as life-taker, to be pacified or turned away only by a ceremonial blood-smearing—parallel to the Israelites’ smearing of blood on their doorposts when their own firstborn are threatened by the Tenth Plague (<scrip>(Exodus)12:12–13</scrip>).	Two final points should be noted here. First, it is with the act of his son’s circumcision that Moshe finally becomes a true Israelite (that, after all, was the major term of God’s covenant with Abraham in <scrip2>Gen. 17</scrip>). Similarly, Yehoshua (Joshua), Moshe’s successor, will circumcise the next generation of Israelites in the process of conquering the Promised Land (<scrip2>Josh. 5:2</scrip>). And second, it is telling, again, that the person who saves Moshe’s life in adulthood is a woman. In a sense, Moshe’s early life is now over, having come full circle.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Before Pharaoh <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)5:1–6:1<content>): Moshe and Aharon’s initial efforts to free the people—even temporarily for an act of worship—are unsuccessful, as foretold in the previous chapter. But even though God had predicted failure, we are still left with a portrait of clashing human wills: the liberators’, the king’s, and the reluctant people’s. The narrative appears to be a set-up for the second major revelation of God to Moshe (Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)6</scrip>), which, preceded by expressions of doubt on both Moshe’s part and that of the people, harks back to the concerns voiced at the Burning Bush. There is also a forward-looking figure, Pharaoh, who is a prototype for other foreign rulers and enemies in the Bible who challenge God (Greenberg 1969).	Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)5</scrip> contains the Bible’s most extended description of the conditions of Egyptian bondage. Not surprisingly, the root “serve” occurs seven times in vv.9 to 21 (Greenberg 1969), and sound variations on the Hebrew <i>ra’ <style>(“ill/evil”) three times (vv.19–23).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Promise Renewed <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)6:2–13<content>): Greenberg (1969) and others have noted how this section in many respects recapitulates God’s speeches at the Bush. Once again God assures Moshe that he has “heard” and “recalled” the Israelites and their old covenant; once again he promises to act (“bring out” resounds four times); once again the promise is linked to an interpretation of God’s name; and once again Moshe expresses doubt as to whether he will be believed or listened to (v.12).	Why the repetition? Perhaps here, as elsewhere, to double is to emphasize. Also, just as Moshe initially failed as a self-appointed liberator in Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)2</scrip>, only to be sought out by God in the wilderness, he fails as a leader here as well, followed by God’s reassuring speech. There can be no question from whence the liberation comes.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Genealogy of Moshe and Aharon <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)6:14–27<content>): At this tension-filled moment in the narrative, in the face of Moshe’s self-doubt and the possible collapse of his mission, there is an unlikely break, at least by Western storytelling standards. Apparently the genealogy has been inserted to buttress Moshe and Aharon’s claim to represent the people before the Egyptian crown, and to stress their Levite ancestry (which solidly establishes them within the priestly class in Israel). Significantly, the genealogy of Yaakov’s sons ends with the third, Levi, and the rest of the list enumerates the Levite clans. More significantly, the ages mentioned are composed of patterned numbers such as 3, 7, 30, and 100. As in Genesis, this betokens a concept of order and meaning in history.	Thus legitimated, Moshe and Aharon can return to the task at hand. It would seem, then, that the passage is speaking to the Israelites, both in Egypt and in the audience of later generations.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Mission Renewed <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)6:28–7:13<content>): As preparation for the next meeting with Pharaoh, Moshe is once more reminded that the king will not listen to him. Taking a page from his speech at the Bush, God instructs Moshe and Aharon to use the “sign” that had previously served to convince the people: snake magic. Yet despite Aharon’s one-upping the Egyptian magicians in the warm-up for the plagues, Pharaoh remains unconvinced. This episode helps to prepare for what follows, and indeed contains a virtual glossary of Exodus words. Some of these are: “speak,” “send,” “harden,” “heart,” “sign/portent,” “hand,” “bring out,” “know,” “staff,” “hearken,” “midst.” <i>First Blow <style>(<scrip>(Exodus)7:14–25</scrip>): The first plague uses elements and words common to many subsequent plagues; in addition to those just mentioned, it introduces “refuse” and “reek” and “throughout all the land of Egypt.” More important is the choice of site and object for the curse: the Nile (a god in Egypt), water (source of life for the Egyptians but earlier source of death for the Hebrew babies), and blood (sign of life and death). No more effective choice could have been made for this first demonstration of the far-reaching power of the Israelite God.	As with the first six plagues, the threat is long and the actual carrying-out brief. Note the relationship, at the end of the episode, between the uncaring Pharaoh and his own people, who have to scratch for water.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Second Blow <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)7:26–8:11<content>): The second plague is linked to the first by a number of elements: the Nile, the magicians, and of course, Pharaoh’s disregard of the threats after it is all over. It is also a full narrative, containing most of the formal aspects of the plagues within itself (see “The Plague Narrative,” above).	The threat of this plague breaks into poetry in a striking passage (v.28) which uses repeating prepositions. The frogs are literally everywhere. Also, for the first time Pharaoh asks that God be entreated—that is, he finally acknowledges his existence (as against which, see <scrip>(Exodus)5:2</scrip>).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Third Blow <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)8:12–15<content>): With the third plague, the curse becomes more intimate, affecting the bodies of all living creatures in Egypt (cf. the refrain in vv.13–14, “on man and on beast”). The narrative uses the briefest plague formula here, without introduction or warning to Pharaoh. Yet it results in an Egyptian effort to end the siege, as the magicians term the plague “the finger of a god” (v.15). <i>Fourth Blow <style>(<scrip>(Exodus)8:16–28</scrip>): Despite its similarity to the previous plague (insects), number four introduces a new and important element into the tale: the idea that God makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel. It also involves protracted bargaining between Moshe and Pharaoh over the issue of allowing the Israelites to worship God. <i>Fifth Blow <style>(<scrip>(Exodus)9:1–7</scrip>): Although this plague spares humans, it is nevertheless described as “heavy” (v.3). The narrative uses a play-on-words as well: the Hebrew for pestilence (<i>dever<style>) echoes that for thing (<i>davar<style>). <i>Sixth Blow <style>(<scrip>(Exodus)9:8–12</scrip>): Just as in the previous “short” plague, number 3, the magicians come to the fore. No longer do they cry to Pharaoh; they cannot even take the stage! <i>Seventh Blow <style>(<scrip>(Exodus)9:13–35</scrip>): Long like its corresponding predecessors (numbers 1 and 4), the seventh plague prefaces its occurrence with an emphatic introduction by God, and its warning gives God-fearing Egyptians a chance to save themselves (vv.19–21), something new. The description of the plague itself is fraught with spectacle, presaging Sinai with its use of thunder and fire. There is also the ominous note, twice in the text (vv.18, 24), that such a plague was unique in Egyptian annals. The plagues, at least for the Egyptians, now transcend the realms of normal, explainable experience, as well as of historical recollection. <i>Eighth Blow <style>(<scrip>(Exodus)10:1–20</scrip>): Anticipating Pharaoh’s eventual capitulation, the Egyptians now urge their king to release the Israelites, before Egypt is truly “lost” (vv.7). The request occurs before the plague does. This longest plague is in many ways the most devastating of all, affecting as it does the very soil itself. Here the last two plagues are anticipated (vv.15, “the earth became dark”; and v.17, “this death”), and the previous one is echoed (vv.6, 14, with the reference to past history). Also foreshadowed, in the locusts’ removal, is the final victory at the Sea of Reeds (Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)14</scrip>), through the mention of the location and the use of a powerful wind. <i>Ninth Blow <style>(<scrip>(Exodus)10:21–29</scrip>): Little is new here; darkness foreshadows the final plague, death. Yet at the end of the brief episode, as well as in <scrip>(Exodus)11:8</scrip>, we are given a glimpse into the human element, as Moshe and Pharaoh rage in anger against each other. <i>The Final Warning <style>(<scrip>(Exodus)11:1–10</scrip>): What seems to be the introduction to the last plague is made up of motifs common to several of the previous ones. It also reintroduces the idea of despoiling the Egyptians, which had been mentioned in Moshe’s original commission (<scrip>(Exodus)3:21–22</scrip>)—so we know that redemption is at hand. Artfully, the specification of what “one more blow” is, is delayed until v.5. In addition, there is the motif of Moshe’s greatness/fame among the Egyptians, which would appear to be a suppressed remnant of the story (in the face of the desire to glorify God as the hero). The section ends (vv.9–10) with a summary of the entire Plague Narrative—or at least of what is to be learned from it. <i>The Tenth Blow in Its Context: <style>With Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)12</scrip> the narrative leaves the realm of story telling and enters that of ritual. What has so far been recounted as a story now takes on the aspect of commemorative ceremony. Instead of proceeding from warning (<scrip>(Exodus)11:1</scrip>, <scrip2>4–8</scrip>) to plague (<scrip>(Exodus)12:29–30</scrip>), the tenth plague account has been embedded in a setting of the lengthy description of a festival, thus shifting the time sense of the narrative. The enactment of the ceremony is important both for the characters in the story and for the participants in the audience of later generations. Likewise, the description of the actual leaving of Egypt is followed, not by a detailing of the route or what happened next, but by a series of regulations concerning who may eat the Passover meal (<scrip>(Exodus)12:43–51</scrip>) and by rules concerning the dedication of the firstborn (<scrip>(Exodus)13:1–16</scrip>).	By means of such editing, the final text was obviously meant to move the Exodus story, with all its historical aspects, into what historians of religion call “mythical time.” In our text, history becomes present event; the hearer is no longer “in the audience” but actually acts out the story. That immediacy is meant is demonstrated by the threefold occurrence of the phrase “on this/that same day” (12:17, 41, 51), which also serves to unite the various parts of the text around the tenth plague and the exodus.	The mixture of law and narrative that we find in Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)12</scrip> and <scrip2>13</scrip> sets the stage for the Sinai scenes that will take place later in the book (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)19</scrip>ff.), and indeed for the rest of the Pentateuch.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Passover Ritual <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)12:1–28<content>): The festival depicted in this chapter is, in the opinion of many scholars, a combination of two ancient holy days: a shepherds’ festival, in which each spring a lamb was sacrificed to the deity in gratitude and for protection of the flock, and a celebration of the barley harvest, at which time all leaven/fermentation products were avoided (although see Ginsberg, who theorizes a shepherds’ festival with <i>matza<style>). Each has numerous parallels in other cultures (see Gaster 1949). What has apparently happened here is that the two days have been fused together and imbued with historical meaning. In addition, rites that were originally protective in function have been reinterpreted in the light of the Exodus story. But whatever its origin, Passover as described in our text bespeaks a strong sense of Israelite tribal community and of distinctiveness. And it is distinctiveness, which played such an important role in Israelite religion, that is singled out here, with the striking penalty for transgressing the boundaries of the festival—being “cut off” (probably death). One also notes the repetition of the phrase “a law for the ages” (vv.14, 17, 24). Passover, then, is central both to the Exodus story and to Israelite ideas as a whole (see Sarna 1986 for a detailed discussion). <i>Tenth Blow and Exodus <style>(<scrip>(Exodus)12:29–42</scrip>): The final blow falls. This most horrifying of all the plagues, and the reaction to it, are described in only two verses, whereas the rest of the narrative concerns itself with preparations for and actual description of the exodus. Note how, as above, the narrative is surrounded by ritual concerns—trying to explain the subsequent reason for eating unleavened bread (which had not been done in v.15f., above). There also returns the important motif of despoiling (“stripping”) Egypt.	The section ends (vv.40–42) with a dramatic summary of Israel’s sojourn in Egypt and the importance of the Passover festival, built on repetition (“thirty years and four hundred years,” “a night . . . for <p.small>Yhwh</p.small>,” “keeping-watch”). Again, a past event is made immediate for the audience. The powerful religious tones of story and ceremony are established by the threefold reference to night as the setting for both (vv.29–31).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Who May Make Passover <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)12:43–50<content>): Continuing the immediacy of ritual, the narrative pauses where one would expect it to talk about the Israelites’ route, to specify carefully that partaking of the Passover meal, and indeed being a part of the community in general, requires circumcision on the part of the participant. In essence, it creates the new Israelite nation, on the heels of common participation in a historical event. This small passage has been inserted between two occurrences of the same phrase (“that same day”), an editorial device often used in biblical literature. <i>Passover and the Firstborn <style>(<scrip>(Exodus)12:51–13:16</scrip>): To close out the text’s celebration of the exodus event, the editor includes a peroration on the firstborn. This too is a reinterpretation of earlier religious practices. Many ancient cultures selected the firstborn as an object for sacrifice to the gods—whether firstborn of fruit, of animals, or of human beings—the grounds for this being that the firstborn represents the best that nature has to offer (see <scrip2>Gen. 49:3</scrip>, where Jacob’s firstborn is “my might, first-fruit of my vigor”). The idea of strength is played upon in the reinterpretation of sacrifice: four times, including at the end of the passage, we are told that the firstborn is to be consecrated, “for by strength of hand <p.small>Yhwh</p.small> brought you out of Egypt” (vv.3, 9, 14, 16).	The chapter has a few notable characteristics. For one, the eating of <i>matzot <style>has been integrated into the firstborn material; for another, the language is unmistakably reminiscent of Deuteronomy (vv.5 and 11, “it shall be [a refrain here]/when <p.small>Yhwh</p.small> brings you to the land of the Canaanite . . .”; see <scrip2>Deut. 6:10</scrip>, <scrip>(Exodus)7:1</scrip>, etc.). This has led some scholars to point to a relatively late date for the material, supporting the idea that Israel in its sixth-century <p.small>b.c.e.</p.small> exile in Babylonia looked back to recast the past in its own image. At any rate, memory is clearly important here, with two passages stressing the continuity of commemoration through the following generations (vv.8–10 and 14–16).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Route and the Escort<content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)13:17–22<content>): The initial exit from Egypt highlights an ominous fact about the Israelites: God is well aware of their weaknesses and leads them by a detour, lest they “see war” and seek to recover the familiar security of being serfs. The section also explains what they are doing out of the way of the logical route to Canaan (the place names are difficult to identify, but the general stress is clear), and sets up the great final victory of the next chapter.	Two other elements of weight enter in this brief passage. One concerns Yosef’s bones, which leave Egypt with his descendants. The body of Yosef seems to anchor early Israelite history: its mummification brings the Genesis stories to a close, its journey here links up Israel’s patriarchal past with the radically new deliverance from bondage, and its final interment in the land of Israel formally closes out the conquest of the land under Yehoshua (Joshua) (<scrip2>Josh. 24:32</scrip>).	Another unifying motif is that of God’s accompanying the journeying Israelites in the form of cloud and fire. This passage is the first of what I have called the “Presence Accounts” described in “On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure,” above.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>At the Sea of Reeds <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)14<content>): The liberation account ends with two literary masterpieces: the semipoetic story of Israel’s miraculous passage through the Sea of Reeds along with God’s smashing of the Egyptian war machine, and the song of triumph that follows in Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)15</scrip>. Taken together, they form a natural conclusion to what has gone before and a bridge to what follows. Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)14</scrip> marks the Israelites’ last contact with the Egyptians, and the beginning of their desert journey.	As if the actual exodus were not dramatic enough, the narrator or editor has included a battle scene at this point in the text. As before, the principal combatants are God and Pharaoh, and as before, we begin with God’s hardening the monarch’s heart (vv.4) to teach him a final lesson (“I will be glorified”). In that vein, some of the plague motifs are repeated, making Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)14</scrip> a fitting conclusion to the Deliverance account stylistically and thematically (see also Isbell). At the same time the story includes a foreshadowing of Israel’s behavior in the wilderness for the next two years, with a detailed account of their complaints against Moshe (and God’s miraculous response).	God appears in this story in his most warlike garb, and temporarily resembles many of the gods of antiquity (Cross uses the term “the divine warrior,” relating it to Northwest Semitic imagery). This is not unusual for the Bible, and seems appropriate here, given the climactic nature of the events and the general context of the Deliverance Narrative. Otherwise, the Hebrew God was conceived of as the originator of all things, good and evil, and was of course not compartmentalized into limited tasks as were other gods of neighboring cultures.	From a formal point of view, the sea narrative is among the most formulaic in the Hebrew Bible. That is, it is built entirely upon several phrases that repeat throughout the text, stressing its major themes. These include: God’s “making Pharaoh’s heart strong-willed” (vv.4, 8, 17); God’s “being glorified” through what he does to the Egyptians (vv.4, 17, 18); Israel’s going “upon dry-land” (vv.16, 22, 29); the waters’ “returning” (vv.26, 27, 28); Israel’s marching “through/into the midst of the sea” (vv.16, 22, 23, 27, 29); Pharaoh’s “chariots and riders” (vv.17, 18, 23, 26, 28); and a description of the standing waters, “the waters a wall for them to their right and to their left” (vv.22, 29); see also the refrain, “before Pi ha-Hirot . . . before Baal-Tzefon” (vv.4) and “by Pi ha-Hirot, before Baal-Tzefon” (vv.9). The text is thus much more than a journalistic account of what happened: it is a rhythmic retelling of an experience, strongly conditioned by traditional (probably oral) Israelite forms of storytelling.	The ending (vv.29–31) betrays the influence of Deuteronomy. Using language that mirrors the end of the entire Torah (<scrip2>Deut. 34</scrip>), the text speaks of seeing, fearing, hand, eyes, and the unique-to-Deuteronomy phrase “Moshe his servant” (see <scrip2>Deut. 34:5</scrip>). Significantly, then, the final narrative of Israel’s relationship to Egypt is cast as a classic ending in general.	What exactly happened at the sea? As I indicated in “On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure,” above, such a point is unanswerable, and may not have a great bearing on the meaning of our text. Scholars have scrambled their brains for decades, trying either to reconstruct precisely what “natural” event this “really” was (e.g., tides, tidal wave), or to identify the exact location of the “Sea of Reeds.” While such matters are important to the historian, the Bible itself concentrates on the theme of the story. The narrator was concerned to demonstrate God’s final victory and to portray Israel’s escape in terms of a birthing (through a path, out of water), and these themes had the most influence both on later biblical tradition and on the generations of inspired Jews and Christians that heeded them.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Song of God as Triumphant King <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)15:1–21<content>): Moshe’s famous Song at the Sea provides a natural boundary in the book of Exodus. It sets off the Egypt traditions from those of Sinai and the wilderness, and brings to a spectacular close the saga of liberation. This is borne out even in scribal tradition, still observed in the writing of Torah scrolls today, where the Song is written out with different spacing from the preceding and following narrative portions.	A poem is necessary at this point in the story, to provide emotional exultation and a needed break before the next phase of Israel’s journey in the book. The Song manages to focus the Israelites’ (the audience’s?) intense feelings in a way that neither the ritual of Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)12–13</scrip> nor even the semipoetic description of God’s miraculous intervention in Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)14</scrip> can do. Only poetry is capable of expressing the full range of the people’s emotions about what has happened. This is similar to the effect of the great poems that occur toward the end of Genesis (Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)49</scrip>, the Blessing of Yaakov) and Deuteronomy (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)32–33</scrip>, the Song and Blessing of Moshe).	A major concern of the poet is God’s kingship, with which he ends the poem (a one-liner—“May <p.small>Yhwh</p.small> be king for the ages, eternity!”—contrasting with the doublets and triplets in the body of the poem). This is no accident, nor is it inappropriate; since Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)4</scrip> and <scrip2>5</scrip> the story of Exodus has revolved around just who shall be king (God or Pharaoh) and just who shall be served. By the end of Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)14</scrip> this is no longer an issue. The victorious <p.small>Yhwh</p.small> can now be acclaimed as king, while we hear nothing further of Pharaoh. (Has he drowned or merely been written out of the story? Later generations of Jews enjoyed giving him a role in the world to come: he stands at the gate of Hell, admonishing evildoers as they enter; see Ginzberg.)	The attempts to recover what happened at the sea through the poem are doomed to failure, considering that the piece is constructed out of two traditional stories, the victory at the sea and the later conquest of Canaan (vv .1–12, 13–17). Further, it is set in cosmic terms. The words “Oceans” (Heb. <i>tehomot;<style> vv.5, 8) and “breath” <i>(ru’ah; <style>v .8) recall the primeval chaos at the beginning of Creation itself (<scrip2>Gen. 1:2</scrip>). This technique is characteristic of much of ancient/religious literature: a great event is told in a way that reflects the beginnings of the gods and the world (this may include statements about the end of the world as well).	It should be noted that some scholars point out the close resemblance between God’s victory here and scenes in other ancient Near Eastern literatures that portray the triumph of a storm god over a sea god. So however historical the events in Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)14–15</scrip> may have been, in their biblical retelling they have been patterned after antecedents in myth.	Much has been written concerning the structure of the Song (see, e.g., Cassuto, Cross, and Lichtenstein). I will mention only a few points here. The vocabulary of the poem is extremely concentrated. Major ideas are expressed by clusters of key verbs. Note, for instance, the grouping of “flung,” “hurled,” “plunged,” “shattered,” “smashed,” “consumed”—a veritable lexicon of military victory. A number of verbs describe divine leadership (“led,” “guided,” “brought”), and God’s establishment of the Israelites in Canaan (“planted,” “founded”). The fear of the Canaanites (of Israel and its God) is graphically expanded to “shuddered,” “seized with writhing,” “terrified,” “seized with trembling,” “quivered,” “. . . dread and anguish,” and “grew dumb.” Finally, there are a number of nouns that express weight (cf. Heb. <i>kaved, <style>previously discussed): “stone,” “dam,” and “lead.”	The overall effect of the poem is of fierce pride at God’s victory, and exultant description of the destruction and discomfort of enemies, whether Egyptian or Canaanite. This general tone parallels many ancient war poems; what is characteristically Israelite about it is God’s choosing and leading a people. Therefore the last verse goes far beyond the celebration of a single military victory. The Song constitutes the founding of a theocratic people.	Scholars have long noted the archaic style of the Song, which uses forms characteristic of early biblical Hebrew. Its tone is for this reason even more exalted than is usual in biblical poetry. An imaginative reflection of the effect can be found in Daiches, who paraphrases the Song in the style of early English epic poetry.	Two sections have been appended to the end of the poem. First there is the poetically remarkable summary of the narrative in v.19, notable for the fact that it is composed wholly from phrases used in Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)14</scrip>. There follows a women’s repetition/performance of at least part of the Song complete with dance. Some scholars see this as the “original” form of the poem. Of equal interest is the characterization of Miryam as a “prophetess.” But there may be a structural reason for her appearance as well: the enterprise of deliverance from Egypt began with a little girl at the Nile, watching through the reeds to make sure her baby brother would survive; it ends with the same person, now an adult, a “prophetess” celebrating the final victory at the Sea of Reeds.<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b>Notes<content><style><h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>1:1<exerpt><b>	children of Israel: <content><style>Or “sons,” though it should be noted that the Hebrew <i>b’nei <style>can denote members of a group in general, not just family.

The wilderness stories embody a key process for the Torah story: Israel’s passage from enslaved childhood to troubled adolescence, with a hopeful glance toward adulthood (the Promised Land). This process starts immediately after liberation; indeed, it is its direct result. Further, the three “desert themes” prominent in Chapters 15–18—“grumbling” against God and Moshe, hostile neighbors, and early self-government—are appropriate to include before the meeting at Sinai, in that they demonstrate dramatically the people’s need for reassurance, protection, group solidarity, and institutions (whereby they can live harmoniously). These narratives, therefore, lay out Israel’s precarious position and create the hope for a cure. It is only later on in the Torah, in the book of Numbers, that we will discover that the growing-up process in the wilderness could not be accomplished in a single generation.	The portrait of a people (or of an individual, as is often the case in religious literature) undergoing transformation in a place outside of normal geographic/cultural boundaries is a well-known phenomenon in traditional stories. Anthropologist Victor Turner speaks of the “liminal” experience, where the protagonist or initiant is separated spiritually and geographically from his origins in order to be changed into something new (see Fredman and Cohn). This is paralleled by the process of pilgrimage in the world of ritual, as can still be observed among many communities of the world to this day. The desert is the site of liminality par excellence: it is a harsh place that contains none of the succoring elements of human civilization, yet at the same time it leads the wanderer into truer communication with nature and the divine, metacultural forces of the universe. It is a place of betwixt and between, which mirrors the experiencer’s psychological state. In the case of Israel, later biblical sources speak of the wilderness period with striking force, either as an example of the people’s long-standing and deeply ingrained rebelliousness (e.g., <scrip2>Psalm 95</scrip>), or fondly, as a kind of honeymoon period between God and Israel (e.g., <scrip2>Jer. 2:2</scrip>). In both cases what is evoked is only a stage on the way, and not the final goal (see Talmon).	Transformation always involves both life and death, and so it is not surprising that a characteristic theme of the stories before us is lack of food and/or water. The opening episodes of the section (<scrip>(Exodus)15:22–17:7</scrip>) comprise three scenes of “grumbling” about the difficulties of survival (with the structure: water–food–water), with a unique biblical twist: God and the people “testing” each other. And so the transformation depends very much on God’s action on the people’s behalf (twice he has to “instruct” them—the very verb from which the term “Torah” is derived). The suspension of the life process, or at least its imperiling, is notable also in the fact that, in contrast to the fertility of the Israelites in Egypt, “the trek narrative does not relate a single birth” (Cohn). This is especially striking given the strong birth image of Israel at the Sea of Reeds, which is still in the reader’s mind as the section opens.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Grumbling I <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)15:22–27</scrip>): The first of the wilderness narratives is linked to what has gone before via the theme of water. Fresh from their rescue from death at the sea, the Israelites look for water in the desert and find the discovery of unpotable water intolerable. The key word, especially for the many later wilderness traditions such as we find in Numbers, is “grumbled” (Heb. <i>lyn<style>), which leads to God’s nurturing of the people. Strangely, the theme of undrinkable water recalls the beginning of the plague sequence in Egypt (<scrip>(Exodus)7:20–21</scrip>).	Right away in this first desert episode we are told the purpose of Israel’s journey: God is testing them, to see if they will “hearken” to what he bids them to do. The language is in the style of Deuteronomy. One should also mention the idea of “law and judgment,” indicating another crucial desert theme: Israel’s ability or inability to govern itself.	The account ends with an abundance of water in v.27.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Grumbling II <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)16</scrip>): Moving now halfway (in terms of time) to their Sinai destination, the people encounter a new lack: food. This reintroduces the “testing” motif (vv.4), with its built-in answer: God provides quails and <i>mahn <style>(trad. English “manna”). The story is full-blown, and its repeating vocabulary sets forth the issues clearly: “grumble” occurs seven times, and “command/commandments” four times, linked to the idea of testing. Indeed, this long story poses the question central to all the wilderness narratives: “. . . whether they will walk according to my Instruction or not” (vv.4).	The manna was important in early Israelite tradition as a witness to God’s nurturing, as attested by the end of the chapter with its ritual prescriptions regarding it (vv.32–34; note the threefold repetition of “safekeeping”). But it also sets up an emphasis on a more permanent institution in Israelite culture: the Sabbath. One notion that this passage may convey is the antiquity and importance of the Sabbath, preceding the laws of Sinai as it does here. Also at issue is whether the Israelites can follow simple rules laid down by God.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Grumbling III<content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)17:1–7</scrip>): With the third wilderness story we return to the water theme. This time the element of “quarreling” with Moshe is added, in addition to the portrayal of Moshe’s eroding patience (vv.4). Otherwise it is a variation on the basic theme (notice, for instance, the similarities between <scrip>(Exodus)16:3</scrip> and <scrip>(Exodus)17:3</scrip>). The ending is ominous, reversing the previously held idea of God’s testing Israel. <i>War with Amalek <style>(<scrip>(Exodus)17:8–16</scrip>): In addition to testing/grumbling, conflict with foreigners is a significant wilderness theme (see <scrip2>Num. 20–24</scrip>). It is perhaps for this reason that it has been included in the pre-Sinai traditions. Its placement here may depend on its use of Moshe’s staff; the previous narrative ended with the use of that object, and such linkage was a known form of composition in ancient literature.	The tradition about Israel’s relationship with Amalek, however brief, persists as an important one in the Bible. Saul, Israel’s first king, is commanded by God to wipe out the Amalekites, as punishment for their opposition of Israel in our passage (<scrip2>(1Sam. 15)I Sam. 15</scrip>), and centuries later, Haman, the evil Persian councillor who proposes to exterminate the Jews of his country, is portrayed as a descendant of the Amalekite king (<scrip2>Esther 3:1</scrip>).	Our story, however, is no mere military report, but also a tradition about the power of the “staff of God.” In another culture, indeed in later Midrashic literature, such a theme would receive Excalibur-like treatment, but the Bible suppresses the magical side and simply uses it as a tool, expressing God’s continuing deliverance of Israel.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The New Society: Yitro’s Visit <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)18</scrip>): Israel finally reaches the “mountain of God,” but this, remarkably, is subordinated to the fact that Moshe and the people meet up with Yitro, whom we recall from Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)2–4</scrip>. The designation “father-in-law” recurs throughout this chapter (thirteen times), perhaps playing up the importance of the relationship in Israelite society. The real concern of the story, however, is Moshe’s early attempt to set up a functioning judicial system in Israel (hence the key word <i>davar, <style>ten times, translated here as “matter” in the sense of “legal matter”). The chapter thus serves as a good prelude to Sinai, which will include far-ranging legal material (despite the fact that some scholars see it as an insertion from a later period—cf. v.16, “God’s laws and his instructions”).	It has been noted (Cohn) that the “trek narratives” in Exodus and Numbers have been laid out evenly, with six “stations” between Egypt and Sinai and another six between Sinai and the land of Israel. Thus here, Israel has come to the midpoint of its journey. In another perspective, Moshe himself has come full circle, returning to both the spot and the man in whose presence the mature adult phase of his life had begun.<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b>Notes<content><style><h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>22<exerpt><b>	Shur:<content><style> Some translate as “Wall” (of Egypt)—the outer fortified boundary of the country, and hence the edge of civilization.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>24<exerpt><b>	grumbled: <content><style>Others, “murmured,” which is, however, more alliterative than the Hebrew itself <i>(va-yilonu<style>).<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>25<exerpt><b>	There he imposed law and judgment: <content><style>Others, “There he made for them statute and ordinance,” etc. The force is not clear, but the phrase seems to fit in with the overall section, which, as I have noted, concerns itself with the Israelites’ early government.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>26<exerpt><b>	sicknesses . . . upon Egypt: <content><style>A recurring theme in the Torah; see the curse in <scrip2>Deut. 28:60</scrip>.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>27<exerpt><b>	Elim:<content><style> Lit. “terebinths” (great trees already mentioned in <scrip2>Gen. 12:6</scrip> and <scrip>(Exodus)18:1</scrip>). <exerpt><b>twelve springs . . . seventy palms: <content><style>Once again the numbers are obviously typological.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>16:1<exerpt><b>	entire community: <content><style>See the note to <scrip>(Exodus)12:3</scrip>. <exerpt><b>Syn:<content><style> Pronounced “seen.” The present spelling has been adopted to avoid the unfortunate associations of the sound “sin” in English.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>3<exerpt><b>	Egypt . . . meat pots . . . :<content><style> Notice the endings of each line, which can be grouped into two clusters: “Egypt . . . meat pots . . . satisfied” versus “wilderness . . . starvation.”<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>4<exerpt><b>	<p.small>Yhwh<pb> said: <content></p.small>Notice how God’s answer is totally devoid of anger, for the dissatisfaction of the people is to provide them with a “test.” <exerpt><b>them . . . they:<content><style> The pronouns are collective singular in Hebrew.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>5<exerpt><b>	a double-portion: <content><style>For the Sabbath, when no gleaning is permitted.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>7<exerpt><b>	what are we: <content><style>The issue is not between Israel and its human leaders, but really between them and God.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>8<exerpt><b>	bread: <content><style>See the note to <scrip>(Exodus)2:20</scrip>.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>9<exerpt><b>	Come near: <content><style>See the note to <scrip>(Exodus)12:48</scrip>.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>14<exerpt><b>	[something] fine: <content><style>The <i>mahn <style>(trad.

At Sinai it had been foretold that </p.small>when Pharaoh “sends you free, you will serve God on this mountain,” and it is at Sinai that Moshe and the people now arrive. The fateful public meeting between the deity and the amassed human community will betoken the formal change of masters: the people, no longer enslaved by the Egyptian crown, now swear fealty to their divine Lord, who imposes rules of conduct upon them in return for his protection and their well-being.	The settings for these events of covenant-making and law-giving are appropriately impressive. The mountain naturally functions as a bridge between heaven and earth (with only Moshe allowed to ascend!), but it is additionally accompanied on this occasion by the powerful manifestations of smoke, fire, cloud, thunder, lightning, and trumpet blasts. To try and pin down exactly to what natural phenomena the story alludes, be they volcano, earthquake, or the like, is somewhat beside the point; what speaks through the text is the voice of an overwhelming experience. Indeed, as Greenberg (1972) points out, the account in Chapter 19 may have been deliberately left ambiguous and contradictory, showing that the editor wished to include all the received traditions about the event.	At the same time, it should be noted that the Sinai revelation resembles the appearance of the storm-god Baal in Canaanite texts, especially in the combining of thunder/lightning and earthquake. <scrip2>Psalm 18:8</scrip> portrays a similar scene. So as varied as the phenomena accompanying God’s appearance here are, they conform to a known literary pattern (Greenstein 1984c).	As mentioned previously, Sinai stands geographically at the center of the Israelite wanderings. As the textual center of the book of Exodus as well, it anchors the people of Israel on their journey toward the fulfillment of their destiny. But that function is purely a mythic one. Sinai never became an important biblical cult site, and the only later story to take place there, that of Elijah in I Kings 19, clearly stems from the desire to draw a parallel between Elijah and Moshe. The Hebrews apparently could not conceive of God’s abiding place’s being located outside the land of Israel. On the other hand, it was necessary to demonstrate that Israel’s laws and institutions arose, not out of normal settled political and economic circumstances, but rather as the direct gift and stipulation of God himself (see Cohn), and hence the choice of a site wholly removed from the great culture centers of the ancient Near East: the monolithic culture of Egypt, the ancestral heritage of Mesopotamia, and the fertility-based society the people were to encounter in Canaan. Sinai, the originating point of Israel as a selfdefined community, had to start everything anew, on a stage in which all other considerations had been stripped away.	Early in the history of biblical exegesis (the Midrash) it was noted that the events on Sinai resemble the conclusion of a marriage ceremony. Such an idea may even have been in the minds of the transmitters of the Exodus traditions. Indeed, the entire book is remarkably reminiscent of a pattern of rescue—courting—wedding with stipulations—home planning—infidelity—reconciliation—and final “moving in” (these stages fit into the general Part divisions I have used throughout the book). Lest this appear to be too Western a model, let it be noted that such analogies occur in the writings of the prophets, where the relationship between God and Israel is likened to that between husband and wife. This constitutes Israel’s version of what Joseph Campbell has termed “sacred marriage” in hero stories—not, as classically, the hero’s successful wooing of a goddess or semidivine creature, but an intimate relationship established between God and his people. As such, it is unique in the ancient world.<h2><p=art><align=1><title><font12><b_caps>On Covenant<style><align=0><font12><content>Marriage may be one imaginative model for the Sinai experience, but it was covenant that the writers wished to stress above all in these chapters. Here we observe a fascinating phenomenon that occurs again and again in biblical religion: an institution well known in the secular world is given a religious emphasis in the Bible. For covenant (others, “pact”) was a widespread form of political bonding in the ancient Near East. Kings and vassals, from Anatolia to Assyria, regularly aligned themselves in treaties involving either freewill granting of privileges or an agreement of mutual obligations between parties. A number of texts laying out the stipulations and ceremonies particular to covenant-making in the ancient Near East have been recovered, and study of them is helpful for an understanding of what we have in <scrip2>Ex. 19–24</scrip>. Three things are clear. First, the stylistic pattern in our chapters resembles what is found in Hittite treaty texts (Mendenhall 1954); second, the Exodus passages use narrative to express these events, not merely a list of conditions; third, and most important, no other ancient society, so far as we know, conceived of the possibility that a <i>god <style>could “cut a covenant” with a people. This last fact leads to the observation that, for Israel, the true king was not earthly but divine—despite the later establishment of a monarchy (Weinfeld 1972b). Hence the narrator’s concentration on these chapters, especially considering the dramatic nature of what had gone before (Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)1–15</scrip>).	The covenant found in Exodus and subsequently in the Torah differs substantively from the two described in Genesis. Noah (<scrip2>Gen. 9</scrip>) and all living creatures had been promised no further universal destruction, with the stipulation that human beings were not to eat meat with blood or commit willful murder. Avraham, too (<scrip2>Gen. 15</scrip>, <scrip2>17</scrip>), was the recipient of a covenant: God would give him land and descendants, and Avraham was to attend to the circumcision of all his males (yet this is more sign than stipulation). What these early events have in common is the aspect of bestowal—God acts and promises, and human beings are the passive recipients. Exodus introduces the notes of mutuality and conditionality. Both parties are now to have a stake in the agreement, and it can be broken by either (as in Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)32</scrip>; contrast this with the promise to Noah in <scrip2>Gen. 8:21–22</scrip>, “I will never curse the ground again . . . [never] shall [natural processes] cease,” and <scrip2>Gen. 9:11</scrip>, “Never again shall there be Deluge. . . .”). From the Creator God we have moved to the God of History, who enters into a fateful relationship with the people of Israel (for more on this, see Sarna 1986).<h2><p=art><align=1><title><font12><b_caps>On Biblical Law<style><align=0><font12><content>A century of modern Bible scholarship has led to far-reaching changes in the perceptions of biblical law. Initial archeological findings, which often included legal documents, had led comparativists to see in the biblical material a pale reflection of its Mesopotamian antecedents. The Code of Hammurabi, for instance, was deemed the source of some of the Exodus material. These early judgments have given way to a view that places more emphasis on what is distinctive about the biblical laws.	For our purposes here, several brief points should be made, drawn from recent research; the reader may find them explored at greater depth in the essays by Greenberg (1970), Greenstein (1984), Paul, and Sarna (1986), and the work of Sonsino. Expressions of law in the ancient Near East, especially in documents from Mesopotamia, reveal a strong economic underpinning, tied to class structure. They also have at times a personal or political function. Hammurabi, for instance, presents his code with the express purpose that the gods and men may see what a just king he is. The laws are listed by category, with religion occupying its own sphere. Finally, the king acts as the enforcer of the laws, having received them from a god—who is nevertheless not their ultimate source. Law exists in the Mesopotamian texts as an abstract value, designed for the smooth functioning of society.	By way of contrast, Hebrew law, as typified by our chapters, displays very different concepts and concerns. Class is hardly alluded to, reflecting a totally different kind of society economically but also expressing an ideal that began in the Genesis creation story with the common ancestor of the human race. The laws are presented as the terms of the covenant (our section is often termed the “Book of the Covenant”), and the motivation behind them is portrayed as historical/psychological (“. . . for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt”). Strikingly, the biblical regulations, not only here but in the other major collections as well (in Leviticus and Deuteronomy), blur the distinctions between religious and secular, and treat all law as a matter directly related to God. He is perceived as the source of laws; they are the expression of his will; and breaking them is a direct affront to and act of rebellion against him (contrast, for example, the modern American view).	The key concept behind much of biblical law seems to be that of <scrip2>Ex. 19:6</scrip>, to make of the people of Israel “a holy nation.” This expression, which appears nowhere else in the Bible, combines a secular notion (the Hebrew <i>goy,<style> meaning a political body, a state) with a sacral one: this people is to transform all of its life into service of God. There is, therefore, no subject in the code before us—slavery, social relations, torts, cult, or diet—that is not of immediate concern to the biblical God. The first part of <scrip>(Exodus)19:6</scrip>, “a kingdom of priests” (Buber: “a king’s-retinue of priests”), would seem to suggest that despite the clear existence of a priestly group in ancient Israel, the ideal approached a more democratic form of religious expression.	This leads us to posit a final question: Are the materials in <scrip2>Ex. 21–24</scrip> (and other texts in the Torah that enumerate laws) to be taken as actual regulations or cases, or as something else, rather more didactic? We have little evidence for the former view, and in fact other ancient Near Eastern legal documents such as the Hammurabi Code seem to point in the other (didactic) direction. Given the nature of Torah literature, where narrative has a teaching function rather than a purely historical one, it seems plausible that the legal texts as well were intended to elucidate principles of Israelite belief—to present, as it were, a worldview. The other possibility, more in keeping with the history of law, is Daube’s (1947) view that “many ancient codes regulate only matters as to which the law is dubious or in need of reform or both.” In other words, law in day-to-day Israel was regulated by established precedents, and certainly not by <scrip2>Ex. 21–23</scrip>, in the main. But in this case, too, our text would be instructive of the biblical mentality. For a fuller treatment of biblical law and its context in the ancient Near East, see Sarna (1986).	Any attempt to describe this section structurally is bound to run into a roadblock; perhaps precisely because of the Bible’s desire <i>not<style> to distinguish between various categories of life, we do not have a watertight structure. Suffice it to say that, overall, most sections in these chapters begin with the general proposition “When . . .” (Heb. <i>ki<style>), and break down the issue under discussion into subsections beginning with “If . . .” (Heb. <i>’im<style>), a pattern found commonly in other legal systems as well. Beyond this, and the observation that there are some general categories and logical connections (for which, see the Commentary), one striking stylistic device in the Hebrew should be pointed out. From <scrip>(Exodus)21:5</scrip> through <scrip>(Exodus)23:24</scrip> a double verb form appears (the infinitive absolute followed by the imperfect) fully twenty-seven times. The effect of this device, which is rhetorically emphatic, is to give a sense of coherence to what are otherwise quite diverse laws.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Meeting and the Covenant <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)19</scrip>): The account of God’s revelation at Sinai, like the narrative of the tenth plague and exodus, is embedded in a wider setting. After the covenant has been elucidated, the people assent; preparations are made to meet God; and the brief initial meeting is followed by more preparations, including stern warnings against trespassing on the mountain’s sanctity. When one takes Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)20</scrip> into account, the effect of all this is anything but smooth, from a narrator’s point of view, and I would agree with Greenberg (1969) that this may be deliberate—stemming from a desire either to include every tradition about this key event that was available to the editor(s), or else to suggest that such things are impossible to describe in normal language and logical sequence (Buber [1981], in another context, once referred to the Creation story of <scrip2>Gen. 1</scrip> as a “stammering account”). In any event, the entire description of the fateful meeting between God and the Israelites at Sinai is confined to a mere four verses (<scrip>(Exodus)19:16–19</scrip>). This stands in blatant contrast to other ancient Near Eastern traditions, which would have treated such an event with epic length and poetic diction (see, for instance, <scrip2>Deut. 32</scrip>, or <scrip2>(Ps. 78:1-72)Psalm 78</scrip>). So here, as in the opening chapter of Genesis, all has been stripped down, focusing attention on the covenant rather than on the mysterious nature of God.	In that vein, it must be observed that the narrative centers around speaking, words, and sounds, keeping the visual to a minimum (in line with the warning in <scrip2>Deut. 4:12</scrip>: “a voice of words you heard/a form you did not see;/only a voice”). It also abounds in terms connoting warning and boundaries/separateness—the text contains three sets of warnings: vv.10–13, 21–22 (introducing the phrase “burst out,” which refers to God’s potential destructiveness if the boundaries are violated), and 24. This recalls Moshe’s own experience at Sinai earlier (cf. <scrip>(Exodus)3:5</scrip>). And the number 3 gives the story the same touch of meaning provided by the numbers in Genesis; Israel arrives at the mountain three months after the exodus and meets God on the third day after their preparations.	As Cassuto points out, the chapter does not begin with “Now it was. . .” (Heb. <i>vayhi<style>), a normal marker for continuing a previous narrative. The Sinai material thus presents itself in utter newness. To use the previously cited wedding analogy: this text betokens a new relationship between God and Israel, however well they have known one another previously.	Also notable in Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)19</scrip> is the emphasis on movement: going up (Heb. <i>’aloh<style>) and down <i>(yarod) <style>(see also <scrip>(Exodus)24:15–18</scrip>). This movement serves to bridge the gap, usually great, between heaven and earth; but note that it is Moshe, and not the people, who does the ascending and descending.	Structurally, vv.20–25 appear to have been added, to emphasize the warning theme. They also delay the pronouncement of the “Ten Commandments,” creating thereby a more dramatic effect with the appearance of the latter. But it seems clear that considerable editing has taken place.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Ten Words (The Decalogue) <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)20:1–14</scrip>): This section, among the most famous and important in all of religious literature, is set in dramatic tone. Its rhetoric could hardly be more striking. In a form relatively rare in ancient Near Eastern legal documents, a god sets forth demands, with no punishments listed. This “apodictic” form seems to indicate that the Ten Words function as a preamble to the actual laws of Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)21–23</scrip>, by laying forth the major principles on which Israel’s relationship to God is to be based (as is to be expected, the secondary literature on Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)20</scrip> is enormous; see Childs for a bibliography).	The numbering of the ten differs slightly in the Jewish and Christian traditions, with the main divergences coming in the split of vv.2–3; see Cassuto. The numbering of verses from 12 on also varies in different traditions. And there are different opinions on the overall structure of the “Commandments.” Jewish tradition separates out those that treat the relationship between God and human beings (vv.2–11, numbers 1–5) and those that involve human society alone (vv.12–13, numbers 6–10), although it should be kept in mind that all offenses in ancient Israel were seen as affronts to God. This division might be borne out by stylistic considerations, for the last five, of course, begin “You are not to . . .” and numbers 2–4 all use the Hebrew word <i>ki<style> (“for”) to express reasons or results of the initial stipulations (vv.4, 6, 10, with the substitution of “in order that” in verse 11).	Other notable stylistic aspects here include the fact that “you” is always singular, and that numbers 2–4 and 6–10 are all put in the negative.	Several other features of the “Decalogue” are unique: the prohibition against worshiping images, which would have had a strange ring in the ancient world; the Sabbath as a holy day on which not even servants, farm animals, or noncitizens are to work, equally unprecedented in its time and place; and, strangest of all, the final prohibition against desiring (another person’s property).	The language and the content of the Decalogue, then, cooperate to create a lofty and challenging ethical code, which both the people of Israel and the Western world in general have struggled with ever since. The reader may wish to consult Buber’s stimulating essays (1982, 1963) “The Words on the Tablets” and “What Are We to Do about the Ten Commandments?”, as well as the essays in Segal.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Aftermath <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)20:15–23</scrip>): The verses that follow the Decalogue highlight an important aspect of the Sinai tradition: its occurrence in a public setting. Vv.15–18 could fit nicely after <scrip>(Exodus)19:20</scrip>a; the Decalogue would then follow <scrip>(Exodus)20:18</scrip>. Yet it seems to have been important for the narrator to stress (vv.19) that God spoke to the people as a whole, not merely secretly in a revelation to a visionary or priest. To emphasize this point, the verb <i>ra’oh, <style>“see/perceive,” occurs seven times in vv.15–19. v.19 also serves as a framework for the entire Revelation episode, recalling as it does the language of <scrip>(Exodus)19:4</scrip>. Israel now has two reasons for obeying God: he brought them out of Egyptian bondage and he talked to them “from the heavens” (v.18).	The rest of the chapter functions as an introduction to the general body of the legislation that begins in the next chapter. Like Israel’s other law collections in Leviticus and Deuteronomy, it starts with rules pertaining to worship.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>On the Laws: <content><style>The reader should bear in mind again that the section headings used in the Commentary are for reference only. This is especially true for Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)21–24</scrip>, where the final form of the Hebrew text discourages distinguishing between different types of offenses (see p. 361, “On Biblical Law”). <i>Laws Regarding Israelite Serfdom <style>(<scrip>(Exodus)21:1–11</scrip>): Given the importance of the root “serve” in the book of Exodus, it is fitting that the Covenant Code open with this theme. In vv.1–6 the text considers the case of the native serf, a status rather like that of the indentured servant in early American history. Immediately, the act of releasing such an individual— providing for his “going out”—is stipulated. “For my servants are they, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt” (<scrip2>Lev. 25:42</scrip>). While the institution of serfdom existed of necessity in ancient Israel, it could not be tolerated as a permanent and fully dehumanizing one (on the other hand, these regulations deal with natives, not with foreigners). Note the use of seven here, as the number of perfection and limit—the servant goes free after seven years, just as the land rests every seven years (<scrip>(Exodus)23:10–11</scrip>).	The second case (vv.7–11) deals with a woman whose poverty-stricken father sells her as a servant. Here, too, there is an attempt to soften the conditions and to humanize what appears as essentially a property situation in the ancient world.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Capital Crimes of Violence <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)21:12–17</scrip>): Four situations involving grave crimes are cited in this section, each ending with the pronouncement of the death penalty in rhetorical form (Heb. <i>mot yumat, <style>“He is to be put-to-death, yes, death”): murder, striking one’s parents, kidnapping, and denigrating one’s parents. Our society has in general supported the first and third of these; but the regulations concerning father and mother do not accord with twentieth-century Western practice, and point up well the enormous importance of the parent–child relationship in ancient Israel (already suggested by “Honor your father and your mother” in the Ten Words). That relationship was often used to describe the one between God and Israel, and thus obedience is an important theme in the covenant as a whole. <i>Injuries <style>(<scrip>(Exodus)21:18–32</scrip>): The vocabulary of verbs in these verses outlines the subject at hand: “quarrel,” “strike,” “contend,” “harm,” “strike,” “break-off,” “give.” The text treats a number of extenuating circumstances, imposing penalties of varying degrees. The case of an accidentally caused abortion is especially highlighted (vv.22–25), and in a famous verse (23), the lawgiver breaks into rhetoric in order to stress that punishments be scrupulously fair. Also notable is the regulation concerning the goring ox (vv.<style>28–32), where an <i>animal<style> is made to pay the death penalty, since it has destroyed the most sacred thing of all—life itself. Both of the latter cases have received exhaustive treatment in the scholarly literature (see Sarna 1986). <i>Property <style>(<scrip>(Exodus)21:33–22:14</scrip>): These regulations cover various damages to property, commonly through negligence. The key word here is “pay” (Heb. <i>shallem, <style>denoting restitution); also repeated are “fellow” and “God’s-oracle.” <i>Laws Concerning Social Relations and Religious Matters <style>(<scrip>(Exodus)22:15–23:19</scrip>): A great variety of offenses is covered in this section: rape, oppression, talebearing, unjust sentencing, and bribery, among others. Yet the category is not so neatly drawn; interspersed with these are laws concerning what we would consider religious affairs: sorcery, idolatry, blasphemy, and the sacred calendar. Once again the implication seems to be that all of these areas are of immediate concern to God, regardless of how they are labeled or pigeonholed.	Stylistically there is also great variety, as categorical prohibitions (<scrip>(Exodus)22:18</scrip>) alternate with pleas (<scrip>(Exodus)23:5–6</scrip>) and positive commands (<scrip>(Exodus)23:10–12</scrip>). A number of times the justification for the law is given in the text itself (e.g. <scrip>(Exodus)22:20</scrip>, <scrip2>26</scrip>; <scrip>(Exodus)23:7</scrip>, <scrip2>8</scrip>, <scrip2>9</scrip>, <scrip2>11</scrip>, <scrip2>12</scrip>), with the operative word being “for.” (Such a verse is called a “motive clause,” and is characteristically although not exclusively biblical; see Sonsino.)	Most notable about this section is the full use that it makes of rhetoric. Several key laws are accompanied by an emotional appeal—e.g., “Oh, if you afflict, afflict them . . . !” (<scrip>(Exodus)22:22</scrip>); “for it is his only clothing . . . in what [else] shall he lie down?” (v.26); “for a Compassionate One am I” (v.26); and “you yourselves know the sojourner's feelings” (<scrip>(Exodus)23:9</scrip>).	No passage in these chapters, and indeed throughout the entire Torah, can easily surpass vv.21–23 (as I have mentioned above), with their appeal to language and emotions alike. So at the core of the legal concerns here is the protection of the powerless.	Toward the end (<scrip>(Exodus)23:10–19</scrip>), emphasis shifts to the festivals of Israel, with a special focus on the agricultural setting. As a result the general scholarly consensus is that these laws could not be wilderness regulations, but refer instead to life after the conquest of Canaan. Be that as it may, the fact that this section ends with ritual concerns provides a rounding-out of the entire body of Exodus legislation, which, as I noted above, began with worship as its subject (<scrip>(Exodus)20:20</scrip>ff.).	Finally, this ending passage is notable for its numerical layout—two sets of seven (years and days) and one of three (times a year).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Epilogue. The Future Conquest <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)23:20–33</scrip>): It would not be suitable, given the grave nature of the covenant, to end the legal passages merely with a particular law, and so our narrator appends a long speech, in the style of Deuteronomy, warning the Israelites, first, to follow God’s messenger, and second, not to assimilate with the nations they are about to conquer. The Deuteronomic themes are classic: “taking care,” smashing Canaanite idols, God’s removing disease from the faithful Israelites, and the spelling-out of Israel’s future borders.	Also to be remarked are the sevenfold repetition of “before you” as a stylistic unifying device, and the ending theme of serving [sc>YHWH</sc> as opposed to “their gods.”<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Sealing the Covenant <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)24:1–11</scrip>): To close out the account of covenant-making which began back in Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)19</scrip>, the text recounts a formalized ceremony which has many points of contact with what was generally done throughout the ancient Near East when a covenant was “cut.” Twice Moshe reads God’s words to the people, and twice (vv.3, 7) they give their assent. This is no imposing of laws by a dictator, but a freely accepted, “signed, sealed, and delivered” agreement cemented by blood, the signifier of life itself.	As representatives of the people, Moshe, Aharon, Aharon’s sons, and seventy elders ascend Mount Sinai, and, most remarkably, “see” God in some sort of vision—without, as one might expect, their being destroyed. They also eat and drink, as was customary in the sealing of the agreement (and often done in business to this day; see <scrip2>Gen. 31:44–54</scrip>).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Moshe Ascends Alone <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)24:12–18</scrip>): Finally, Moshe leaves the people, in order to receive the laws in permanent (stone) form. He “goes up” the mountain four times (or, most likely, is on his way up). In order to give his absence the weight it needs—so that the people will grow restless, setting up the situation that produces the Golden Calf in Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)32</scrip>—the text will now turn to a completely different matter for fully seven chapters.	The ending of this section anticipates the ending of the book of Exodus, with its mention of God’s “glory,” “dwelling,” “fire,” and “day/night.”<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b>Notes<content><style><h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>19:1<exerpt><b>	In the third: <content><style>The Hebrew omits the usual connecting <i>vav <style>(“now,” “and,” or “but”), and thus signals the start of a new narrative.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>2<exerpt><b>	There Israel encamped: <content><style>The repetition, as in <scrip>(Exodus)14:2</scrip>, suggests poetry, perhaps a remnant of what Cassuto terms an epic literature here.

It may seem puzzling to modern readers that a book that purports to be about a people’s origins should choose to fill a third of its pages with a detailed description of a sanctuary, down to the last piece of tapestry and the last ritual vessel. Yet it is an indication of the “Tabernacle’s” centrality in Israel’s idea system that the story of its construction dominates the last half of Exodus.	Several factors may help to explain. First, the system of animal and grain sacrifices, or cult, was as important in ancient Israel as it was elsewhere in antiquity, as the chief means of formally expressing religious feeling. Indeed, the Bible traces this institution back to the beginning of human history, to Cain and Abel (<scrip2>Gen. 4:3–4</scrip>). The cult’s centrality survived the railings of the Prophets and the destruction of Solomon’s Temple, and was still strong enough in late antiquity to provoke a severe crisis when its chief site, the Second Temple, fell to the Romans in the year 70 <p.small>c.e.</p.small> The latter event was a crux upon which the creation of classical Judaism took place, and the process was a painful one. So the opinion that many moderns have, that animal sacrifice was a barbaric custom, is quite beside the point as far as ancient Israel was concerned.	Second, there is the great theme of the book of Exodus, “Is Y<p.small>hwh</p.small> in our midst or not?” (<scrip>(Exodus)17:7</scrip>), to which our account gives a resounding positive answer. The book of Exodus traces not only the journey of the people of Israel from Egypt to Sinai, but also the journey of God to rescue the people and to dwell (“tabernacle”) among them (Greenberg 1972). A detailed presentation of God’s “residence,” as it were, is meant to convey the assurance that the people are led by God himself. This further supports the biblical image of the divine king, who dwells among his subjects and “goes before” them.	Third, the Israelites shared with their neighbors the idea that a victorious God, following his triumph, was to be honored by his enthronement in a human-built structure (see Hallo). Thus the last half of Exodus, far from trailing off into obscure priestly details, fits a well-known mold in its contemporary environment.	A final explanation of the prominence of the Tabernacle sections may be found in their intimate connection with the idea of the Sabbath. The “blueprint” chapters, 25–31, end with an extended passage on observing the Sabbath; the construction chapters, 35–40, begin with a brief passage on the prohibition of work on the holy day. These structural aspects suggest (as the ancient rabbis also saw) that cessation from work here means precisely from the tasks of construction, and that once a week human beings must step back from their own creating to acknowledge the true “work” of creation. Chapters 25–40, including the Golden Calf narrative, bring out these ideas through their use of refrainlike phrases, especially the repetition of one key word: “make” (Heb. <i>’asoh<style>). The entire section is an object lesson in what the Bible deems it proper for human beings to make, and is a vehicle of contrast between God’s creation and human attempts to reach the divine. Israel is engaged in the making of the Tabernacle (notice how “build,” which would make more sense, is not used); when the time comes for the work to be put aside temporarily, they are to “make” the Sabbath. To these observations may be added the long-observed fact that the vocabulary of the Tabernacle’s completion (“finished,” “work,” “blessed”) recalls the completion of Creation in <scrip2>Gen. 2:1–4</scrip>. Thus we are taught that Israel, through its religious life as typified by Sabbath and cult, becomes a partner in the process of Creation, either by imitating the divine act or by celebrating it.	Other peoples, to be sure, recall the beginning of the world in ritual and story, so it is important to make an anthropological observation. The purpose of all sanctuaries is to build a bridge to the divine, to link up with the forces that transcend human beings. It is perceived that certain places are particularly appropriate for this (folklore terms such places “the navel of the earth”), and, by extension, sanctuaries firmly anchor that inherent holiness. What the Tabernacle account initially accomplishes, most notably in its closing chapter (40), is to transfer a topographic “bridge” to a human-made and portable one. With the completion of this Dwelling, we find God resident neither on Sinai nor in the later Jerusalem, but rather accompanying the people “upon all their marches” (<scrip>(Exodus)40:38</scrip>). The sacred center here thus moves; it is a portable anchor that establishes stability wherever it goes. The vitality that surrounded this idea is still to be seen in the successors of the Hebrew Bible, classical Judaism and Christianity, for whom, respectively, Torah and Cross provide a center that is at once movable and stabilizing.	But the sacred center, for biblical religion, finds equal expression in <i>time.<style> While the Dwelling account seems obsessed with matters of space, its setting among the Sabbath passages stresses more the concept of time. Such an aspect already begins to make itself felt in <scrip>(Exodus)24:16</scrip>, where Moshe, on Sinai to receive the laws, waits for six days while the “cloud” covers the mountain, and is able to ascend only on the seventh day, at God’s summons. We are thus left, paradoxically, with a structure (Dwelling) which at first glance uses many well-known art forms and religious motifs common to the ancient Near East, but which is a total departure from them via its connection with the Sabbath—an institution with no known equivalent in the ancient world. The Dwelling account presents us with a people for whom sacred time takes precedence over sacred space (for more on these themes, see Sarna 1986).	There have been many attempts, textually and artistically, to reconstruct the Tabernacle on the basis of our text here, the rationale being that surely so much detail as we find here will serve as the guidelines for an actual structure. Rabbinic and medieval Jewish commentators, as well as modern scholars, have expended considerable energy to that end. But in fact none of the reconstructions has succeeded, for, as with narrative, the text is as much message as description. The text’s main concern, it seems, is for the Dwelling to reflect holiness, in its choice of measurements and materials (see Haran 1985). The layout of the Dwelling expresses aesthetic ideas of perfection, through various symmetrical proportions (see Appendix); the materials are graded such that the closer one gets to God (in the “Holiest Holy-Shrine”), the more precious the metal. In addition, both the colors used and the types of workmanship employed are similarly graded. In a general way, the intent of the narrator seems to have been close to the intent of the great cathedral builders of the Middle Ages: to reflect divine perfection and order in the perfection and order of a sacred structure.	The Dwelling, as described in Exodus, resembles other ancient Near Eastern sanctuaries in many particulars (for which, see the Commentary below), as well as strongly reflecting aspects of the later Temple of Solomon (I Kings 6–7). Some scholars have also likened it to a Bedouin tent (Heb. <i>shakhen<style> seems to be an archaic verb for “to tent”), appropriate to desert conditions. It is perhaps all three, a coalescing of Israel’s ideas of the cult from a variety of historical and religious settings. That the Dwelling was viewed as historical is clear from biblical tradition itself (see <scrip2>(2Sam. 7:6)II Sam. 7:6</scrip>, for instance). But one should keep in mind that it is also a paradigmatic model, that helps to round out the overall scheme of Exodus. The book traces the progress of the people of Israel from servitude (to Pharaoh) to service (of God), and uses the human activity of building to do so. Thus, as Exodus opens, the Israelites are forcibly made to build royal storage cities; as the book ends, the people complete a structure through which they may serve the divine king.	Finally, there is the sequence of description in these chapters: the text begins with the blueprint for the holiest object, the “coffer” (ark), and proceeds through the structure in descending order of holiness. After the building instructions themselves are given, a number of related matters are treated, chief among them the attire of the priests and the ceremony consecrating the priests. The establishment of the cult, like that of the system of justice, is thus viewed as the command of God rather than the result of the need or request of human beings (contrast this with the “requested” monarchy in <scrip2>(1Sam. 8)I Sam. 8</scrip>).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The “Contribution” <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)25:1–9</scrip>): In the first seven verses of this opening section dealing with the Dwelling, the Israelites’ contribution toward the structure is described in detail; but only in v.8 is the purpose of this activity made clear. Despite the concreteness of the description, however, the actual blueprints, as it were, are shown to Moshe by God, and are not recorded in the text. Architects in the creative sense are superfluous here.	Moderns want to know where the Israelites procured such materials as gold and silver in quantity (see Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)38</scrip>), or how they acquired the skills necessary for the fine artisanry involved (e.g., weaving, dyeing, manufacture of incense, and the setting of jewels). These questions, while logical in a historical setting, do not take the Bible on its own terms. The text appears to present the awed report of the Dwelling and its construction without leaving room for totally practical issues (just as <scrip2>Gen. 4</scrip> deals with Cain and his descendants without being concerned with the origins of Cain’s wife).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Coffer <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)25:10–16</scrip>): The coffer or ark was a cult object of major importance in premonarchic and early monarchic Israel. In our text it contains the “Testimony” (i.e., the tablets with the Ten Words); in <scrip2>Josh. 3:14–15</scrip> it precedes the people into the Promised Land; in <scrip2>I Sam. 4:11-5:12</scrip> it is captured in battle but mysteriously wreaks havoc among the enemy (hence its cinematic offspring <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark<style>). Finally, David’s transporting of it to Jerusalem (<scrip2>(2Sam. 6)II Sam. 6</scrip>) marks the formal establishment of that city as a holy one and as the capital of Israel.	In Exodus the coffer literally plays a central role. It stands in the innermost recesses of the Tabernacle, at the sacred center. Considering what the coffer contained—tablets with God’s words on them rather than statues of gods—it addresses the primacy of divine word over divine representation in ancient Israelite thought.<i><h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Purgation–Cover <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)25:17–22</scrip>): <i>Kapporet <style>here could indicate simply “cover,” yet its function goes beyond mere protection. The name of this central part of the above-cited central cult object may be a play on words. The Hebrew verb <i>kapper, <style>which occurs again later in these texts (see <scrip>(Exodus)29:33–37</scrip>), often means “purge” or “purify”; earlier translators rendered it as “expiate” or even “propitiate,” and the <i>kapporet <style>as “mercy-seat” or “propitiatory.” The <i>kapporet <style>was apparently the holiest spot in the Israelite cult system, and it was there that God was said to speak his will to the people. This idea represents a remarkable shrinking and intimatizing process: the God who spoke to the assembled people, amid thunder, fire, and trembling earth at Sinai, now communicates with them from an area roughly the size of a small desk or table. In addition, there is a shift from a one-time event (Sinai) to the permanent fact of a sanctuary—a development which will later be repeated in Solomon’s Temple.<i>The Table <style>(<scrip>(Exodus)25:23–30</scrip>): The table and its implements, like some of the other features of the Tabernacle, are holdovers from a more blatantly pagan model, where the gods were seen to be in need of nourishment. By thus using conventions of worship common throughout the ancient Near East, Israel expressed its desire to serve God, even while it was aware that he was not the sort of deity who requires food and drink. It might also be mentioned that another common object found in ancient sanctuaries, a bed, has intentionally been omitted from our structure. <i>The Lampstand <style>(<scrip>(Exodus)25:31–40</scrip>): Despite the wealth of detail lavished on this striking symbol, its exact construction, like that of the Dwelling in general, remains unclear. The vocabulary used for its constituent parts comes from the realm of plants: shaft, stems, blossoms, almond shapes, etc. Indeed, the major latent symbol behind the lampstand is the tree—which appears in many forms and in almost all religions (Meyers). The tree as a symbol is to be found throughout human culture, in such diverse settings as Native American stories and Norse myths; in the ancient Near East it specifically connoted permanence, growth, and majesty—in other words, a reflection of the divine. If one adds to this range of meanings the function of the lampstand—illumination (which often implies not only the giving of physical light but also, as the English phrase has it, enlightenment)—the lampstand will be seen to emerge as an object with considerable evocative power. All these meanings may not have been immediately obvious and conscious to the ancient pilgrim or worshiper, but they periodically surfaced; the lampstand was ancient Judaism’s symbol of preference (judging from synagogue ruins) and not the “Star of David,” which, as Gershom Scholem has shown, was a medieval mystical addition.	The importance of the lampstand in our text is indicated by v.40, where the motif of God’s revealing the structure of a sacred object on the mountain is resumed. Its significance is also attested by its major material of construction: pure gold.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Dwelling Proper <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)26:1–14</scrip>): The text describes the network of tapestries or curtains that comprise the structure itself, in two layers (vv.1–6 and 7–12), with two additional layers mentioned (vv.14). The outer layers function to protect the inner ones from the elements, while the inner ones, true to the gradations of holiness previously mentioned, are more elaborate. <i>The Framework <style>(<scrip>(Exodus)26:15–30</scrip>): The rigid part of the Tabernacle structure, while described in some detail, leaves room for many questions about specifics (e.g., how exactly did the boards fit together? was there one corner board or two? is the text perhaps describing planks or frames?). What is most important, as mentioned above, is the sense of proportion and approach to the divine implied by symmetrical numbers. <i>The Curtain and the Screen <style>(<scrip>(Exodus)26:31–37</scrip>): Two hangings separate different parts of the Tabernacle: the curtain, which closes off the inner sanctum; and the screen, which separates tent and courtyard. <i>The Altar <style>(<scrip>(Exodus)27:1–8</scrip>): As Cassuto points out, Israelite worship, like that in surrounding cultures, would have been unthinkable without an altar for animal sacrifices. The one described here is a compromise between permanence and portability: it was hollow for transporting, to be filled in with earth at each encampment.	As with the lampstand, the exact construction of the object is to proceed along lines given to Moshe by God at Sinai.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Courtyard <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)27:9–19</scrip>): Returning to the Tabernacle structure, the outer courtyard is laid out, composed of hangings and columns. Again, the numbers fit meaningfully together. Since we are dealing with the extremity of the Dwelling, the material used is the least precious: bronze. <i>The Oil <style>(<scrip>(Exodus)27:20–21</scrip>): The transition from structure to human institution (the priesthood) is accomplished by both the opening formula here, “Now you . . . ,” and by the oil itself, which is here used for light but which will soon be spoken of (Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)29</scrip>) as a major agent in the anointing of the priests. <i>The Priestly Garments <style>(<scrip>(Exodus)28:1–5</scrip>): As in the opening section on the Tabernacle itself (<scrip>(Exodus)25:1–9</scrip>), we are now given a listing of what is to come, the clothing in which the priests will perform their sacred functions. The purpose of the objects is mentioned again, this time at both the beginning and the end of the section.	In virtually all traditional religions such garments are of great importance, often signaling the status of the wearer as representative of the community (hence Aharon’s breastpiece in this chapter). An additional function, stressed in our account, is that the garments somehow reflect God himself, through the use of certain colors and/or materials. That the term “glory” is used to indicate their function—a key term in the book, and always applied to God, never to Moshe, for instance—signals what is at stake.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Efod <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)28:6–12</scrip>, <scrip2>13</scrip>–14): This garment, which here seems to be a kind of apron worn only by the high priest, is mentioned elsewhere in the Bible in connection with worship (e.g., <scrip2>Judg. 8:27</scrip>), but with unclear meaning. Even here, the exact nature of the <i>efod<style> is not entirely certain; but what is cited is its function as the setting for the stones that symbolize the twelve tribes of Israel in God’s presence. This is followed by a description of chains, whose use is mentioned immediately thereafter. <i>The Breastpiece <style>(<scrip>(Exodus)28:15–30</scrip>): The central garment in this section is the breastpiece, which seems to be some sort of woven pouch or bag. On the outside it displays precious stones, each one engraved with the name of an Israelite tribe; inside, it holds the oracular objects known as <i>Urim <style>and <i>Tummin <style>(see the note to v.30, below). In this passage, which is cast in poetic form, the narrator appears to be drawing our attention to the specific function of the garments. Vv.29 and 30 repeat the phrase “over his/Aharon’s heart” (three times), “before the presence of Y<p.small>hwh</p.small>” (three times), and “regularly” (twice) to make clear their importance: Aharon represents the people whenever he officiates in the sanctuary, and bears the emblem of this office upon his very heart. <i>The Tunic <style>(<scrip>(Exodus)28:31–35</scrip>): Aharon’s tunic or shirt is notable for its design of bells and pomegranates, but even more for its protective function, supplied by actual bells, of maintaining the proper distance between Aharon and God in the sanctuary. <i>The Head-Plate <style>(<scrip>(Exodus)28:36–38</scrip>): Foremost among the symbols on Aharon’s garments is what he bears on his brow: a band with the words “Holiness for Y<p.small>hwh</p.small>.” It serves as a symbol of his efforts to obtain forgiveness on behalf of the Israelite people, one of his primary functions as priest. This function extends to cover even unintentional transgressions, such as accidents in the handling of sacred cultic objects. <i>Other Priestly Garments <style>(<scrip>(Exodus)28:39–43</scrip>): These include remaining vestments for Aharon and his sons, to the end that “they do not bear iniquity and die” (vv.43)—a major concern of the priesthood, which viewed all impurities as ritually dangerous before God. Note the solemn ending of this passage: “—a law for the ages, for him and for his seed after him.”<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Investiture Ceremony<content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)29:1–46</scrip>): Although the text still has a number of Tabernacle items to discuss, viz., the incense and its altar, other objects, and the commissioning of the artisans for the construction work, it naturally moves from describing the priestly garb to the ritual through which the priests are installed in their sacred office. First, sacrificial animals and bread are brought and prepared; then the priests are systematically clothed in their sacred vestments. After the first animal is slaughtered, its blood is dashed against the altar and the innards are burned as an offering; then the second ram is slain, and its blood is placed on the priests’ extremities, to purify them. Blood is sprinkled on the priests’ garments; then they hold up the fat-parts and breast of the ram, and follow by offering it up. Then the priests eat the cooked flesh of a special ram, the remains of which are to be burnt. Finally, the altar is purified.	After the regular sacrifice is specified (vv.38–41), the section ends with a powerful meditation on the purpose of the Tabernacle: “hallow” occurs three times, and “dwell” twice. In a word: by “meeting” with the Children of Israel at the Tent, God’s glory makes tent, altar, priests, and most important, the people of Israel, holy. Indeed, the root <i>kaddesh, <style>“holy,” occurs numerous times in the chapter, presaging its multiple use in the next book, Leviticus.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Incense Altar <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)30:1–10</scrip>): This altar, which is not mentioned again, is seen by some as a later interpolation (DeVaux 1965): here it links up with what has gone before through the theme of purging (purification), in v. 10. For more on the incense itself, see vv. 22ff., below. Census and Ransom (<scrip>(Exodus)30:11–16</scrip>): Continuing the theme of purgation, divine command provides for a ransom to be given to the priests, in order to remove (“purge away”) sin incurred by census-taking.	The idea that numbering the people could bring down the wrath of God is portrayed in most striking fashion in <scrip2>(2Sam 24:1–9)II Sam. 24:1–9</scrip>, where David usurps God’s prerogative in numbering the men for military purposes, leading to a plague among the people. It seems that a census was viewed as a dangerous undertaking, perhaps analogous to the taking of photographs among certain peoples (which is felt to be threatening to one’s essence). One who can number, can control (Gaster 1969).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Basin<content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)30:17–21</scrip>): Returning to the familiar stylistic pattern of the Tabernacle account, “You are to make . . . ,” we are told of the basin in which the priests washed. Yet this brief aside links up with the motif of protection from death that was encountered earlier (see <scrip>(Exodus)28:35</scrip>).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Anointing Oil<content><style> (<scrip>(Exodus)30:22–33</scrip>): “Holy” is once again heard as a key word, both in the sense of making something sacred and in the sense of being reserved for special use only. Oil was used in many ancient cultures for positive purposes; elsewhere in the Bible, of course, it played its role in the anointing of kings and prophets, as well as the courteous treatment of guests and after bathing. Oil, then, carried with it connotations of brightness (see <scrip2>Ps. 104:15</scrip>) and life itself.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Incense<content><style> (<scrip>(Exodus)30:34–38</scrip>): This particular incense, warns the text, was to be used only for the sanctuary and not for everyday purposes.	The offering-up of incense was a feature common to worship all over the ancient Near East. At least two reasons have been advanced for its use: purification, and a fragrance pleasing to the deity. It is also curious how our text speaks of God’s being with the Israelites as a column of cloud and of fire; the incense smoke might also then be reminiscent of this divine manifestation.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Craftsmen<content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)31:1–11</scrip>): As the Tabernacle account opened with a summary description of what was to be constructed, so it ends, with some names added. The craftsmen for the task, Betzalel and Oholiav, are depicted as “wise” (Heb. <i>hakham<style>), that is, skilled; they will make what Moshe has been given to see.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Sabbath<content><style> (<scrip>(Exodus)31:12–17</scrip>): <i>The Tablets <style>(<scrip>(Exodus)31:18</scrip>): As a reminder of the Sabbath’s importance amid all the anticipated construction activity, the Israelites are now commanded to observe the holy day. The section is also a prelude to the Golden Calf story, which will be concerned with improper “making”; and “make” appears in a variety of different contexts.	A second prelude draws the initial Tabernacle section to a close. Moshe receives God’s word engraved in stone, by God himself; this will presumably be deposited in the “coffer” of which the text spoke in its opening chapter (25). But the section is forward-looking as well, in that the tablets will play a dramatic role in the story immediately following this passage.<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b>Notes<content><style><h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>25:2<exerpt><b>	raised-contribution:<content><style> A collective noun (Plaut).

Thanks to the inclusion of the Golden Calf episode, we recognize the people of Israel so familiar from the bulk of the wilderness narrative—stubborn, untrusting, and utterly unable to comprehend what has just occurred at Sinai (note the parallel between this section and <scrip>(Exodus)15:22</scrip>ff.: after witnessing the awesome displays of God, the people fall prey to typical human anxieties about their own survival). We are also given a classic biblical description of God in this story—that he is demanding but also compassionate.	There is no doubt that the narrative wishes to portray the breaking of the recently made covenant, and also to focus once again on the anxiety about God’s presence that pervades the whole book. Some see it as a political polemic, given that a similar story is found in I Kings <scrip>(Exodus)12:28</scrip>ff., about Jeroboam’s split from the Solomonic monarchy; according to this theory, the Exodus account is a projection backward of the sin of the Northern Kingdom. Jeroboam, leading a secessionist movement, intended to set up a sanctuary to rival Jerusalem. At the same time, the Exodus story does appear first, and thereby helps to explain why Jeroboam’s deed was considered so terrible by later generations.	But surely the Golden Calf story plays such an important role in the present book of Exodus as to sidestep the question of which version came first. It puts into sharp relief the nature of the people, its leader, and its God, and provides some insights into the complex relationships between these parties; it focuses particular aspects of the Tabernacle idea (see above); and it makes clear the difficulties of the emerging faith community.	The story also contributes some welcome dramatic scenes at this point. It is as if the reader has awakened from a dream: major characters, including God himself, reemerge as real personalities, while secondary characters (Aharon and Yehoshua) are fleshed out. Everywhere there are fierce emotions: doubt, anger, panic, pleading for mercy, courage, fear. And, indeed, the entire enterprise of Exodus hangs in the balance, as God wishes only to destroy the faithless people (a rough parallel exists in <scrip2>Gen. 22</scrip>, where all that has previously been promised to Avraham is threatened). Only after the stark emotions just mentioned have been cathartically absorbed, and the covenant restored, can there be a return to the task at hand—the building of an abode for the divine amid the very human community of Israel. As to the stylistic aspects of the story, we should note the repeated use of the verbs “see” and “know,” among others. Their transformation at different points of the story signals a return to these earlier Exodus themes, this time with a new urgency and a new enterprise at stake: the continuity of the fledgling people.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Sin of the Molten Calf <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)32:1–6</scrip>): We have spent twelve chapters—a major portion of the book of Exodus—dwelling on the heights of Sinai; we have witnessed revelation, law-giving, the command to build a shelter for the presence of God, and the establishment of a priestly cult. But now, as Moshe prepares to descend from the mountain, we are reminded of the other side of the coin: the real world of human frailty. This has occurred before, at the very same site: in Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)19</scrip> and <scrip2>20</scrip> we observed a fearfulness on the part of the people toward getting too close to the divine, as a power too awesome to deal with. Now the fear goes the other way, and, with the disappearance of Moshe, the intermediary, turns to despair. The very thing that had been warned against in the Decalogue (and hence, the first of the terms of the covenant)—the making of a “carved-image/or any figure/that is . . . on the earth beneath” (<scrip>(Exodus)20:4</scrip>), and bowing down to it (<scrip>(Exodus)20:5</scrip>)—takes place here, requested by the people in their hour of need. It is abetted by, of all people, their divine spokesman and priest, Aharon.	Some scholars have sought to soften the sin of the calf by claiming that the Israelites did not view it as an idol but rather merely as a representation of the divine. This does not seem to be borne out by the text, either in the Decalogue or later in the Jeroboam incident, which is often equated with the most heinous crimes (see I Kings <scrip>(Exodus)16:26</scrip>).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Response: God’s Anger <content><style>(<scrip1>(Exodus)32:7–14</scrip>): Now that the people have committed what amounts to a capital crime, the issue at stake is what the punishment shall be. After informing the unsuspecting Moshe of what has taken place down below, with the words <i>“your <style>people [italics mine] . . . has wrought ruin” (vv.7), God indicates his intent to destroy Israel, and to found a new nation beginning with Moshe. However, early Jewish tradition already sensed that something deeper might be happening here. The phrase “let me be” (Heb. <i>hanniha li), <style>it has been observed, suggests that God actually wishes Moshe to argue with him, and this is supported by his acquiescence in record time (vv.14). Indeed, the text never says “God’s anger flared up,” reserving that key verb for Moshe (vv.19). What we learn from this section is not only God’s forgiving nature but something significant about Moshe: faced with a dictator’s dream—the cloning of an entire nation from himself—he opts for staunchly defending the very people who have already caused him grief through their rebelling, and who will continually do so in the ensuing wanderings. And he does not even eschew blackmail to attain his goal. His argument in v.12, that the Egyptians will jeer at this God who liberated a people only to kill them in the wilderness, rings truer in a pagan context than in the Bible. But the next verse reveals Moshe’s vision: he knows that his task is to continue the foundation established by the Patriarchs and to assure the continuity that has been imperiled so many times before.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Response: Moshe’s Anger <content><style>(<scrip1>(Exodus)32:15–29</scrip>): In a sense, the text backtracks chronologically here, to focus solely on Moshe. The first four verses are prefatory but important. Possibly to set the drama of the scene to follow, Moshe is described as carrying the “tablets of the Testimony,” which are dubbed the work of God. Yet another point is being made: the work of God is contrasted with the imperfect work of human beings, the law with its hope versus the idol with its underlying despair.	Sounds of revelry, implied as being worse than sounds of war, reach Moshe, and upon his descent into the Israelite camp he loses control. But smashing the tablets has implications beyond the emotional: it is a legal voiding of the covenant (as in the English “breaking an agreement”). Moshe deals with all concerned in swift succession: the calf is destroyed, Aharon is confronted, and the people are brutally purged.	It is possible that there are historical considerations behind this section. Some see the portrayal of Aharon, who certainly comes across as weak, as part of a strain in the political thinking of a later period. According to this view, the later decline of Aharon’s priestly line is reflected in his behavior here. Others see the “mandating” of the Levites (vv.29) as a reflection of a later power struggle among the priestly classes in Israel. Childs finds Aharon’s role in the story to be a literary one: he is a foil for Moshe. Aharon is willing to capitulate to the people, seeing them (perhaps realistically) as “set-on-evil” (vv.22). Moshe holds fast to his dream of a “kingdom of priests” (<scrip>(Exodus)19:6</scrip>) and thus demands of himself a type of leadership that cannot compromise. The Calf story, then, focuses not only on the great crime of idolatry but also on the nature of Moshe as leader. It is the resumption of the biblical portrait of Moshe, which will return again with greatest force throughout the book of Numbers.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>After the Purge <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)32:30–33:6</scrip>): Although blood has been spilled to punish the guilty, Moshe must still expiate Israel’s sin. In this vein, he offers to be erased from God’s “record” if the people are not forgiven. Then commences God’s reply, couched in terms of who will lead the people to the Promised Land. He will not do it himself, as previously (see the glorious image of <scrip>(Exodus)13:21–22</scrip>), but through the agency of a “messenger.” He will fulfill his promise to the Patriarchs, but not himself among his “hard-necked” people. Their “sin” (the word occurs eight times in vv.30–34) has destroyed that possibility.	An interesting chord is struck at the end. Israel must strip themselves of their ornaments, the spoils of battle, as it were, from the Egyptians. Those ornaments had been used to build the Calf. The final note is ominous: God is yet to decide “what to do with you,” reminiscent perhaps of another scene with identical wording—<scrip>(Exodus)2:4</scrip>, where Moshe’s sister had followed the little-ark downstream, “to know what would be done to him.” In both cases, the people of Israel stand on the brink of disaster, saved only by divine intervention.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Moshe at the Tent<content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)33:7–11</scrip>): This brief digression seems to function as support for Moshe’s role, so important in the book as a whole and in this story in particular. Only one who is accustomed to speaking to God face to face can effect forgiveness for Israel’s crime.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Moshe’s Plea and God’s Answer<content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)33:12–34:3</scrip>): Continuing the dialogue with God from <scrip>(Exodus)32:34</scrip>f., Moshe now pleads that what is necessary is nothing less than the personal assurance that God will lead the people. Six times the verb “know” echoes, along with repetitions of “pray” and “favor”—and so the issue at hand is intimacy and the bonded relationship of covenant. Significantly, also, Moshe refers to Israel three times as “your people,” trying to force God to acknowledge them as his own once more. Answering Moshe’s request for intimacy, God agrees to let him get close, but with limits, and we are reminded of Sinai once more (see the boundary-setting in <scrip>(Exodus)19:12–13</scrip>, <scrip2>21</scrip>ff.). The earlier revelation scene is about to be replayed, in altered form—most notably, without the people themselves present.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>God Reveals Himself<content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)34:4–9</scrip>): This passage is another one of the climaxes of the book, of which I spoke in “On the Book of Exodus and Its Structure,” above. In contrast to the scenes given in other ancient literatures, where, for instance, the texts speak of a physical brightness too great to bear, or of epic descriptions of the gods, our passage is remarkably brief and devoid of physical description. All that is ventured here is a statement of God’s essence, or, more precisely, of his essence for human beings: merciful but just. This image, which had such a great influence on the development of Christianity and Islam as well as Judaism, is of the highest importance in the understanding of the biblical God; it is almost as if the text is saying “This is all that can be known, intimately, of this God, and this is all one needs to know.” There is no shape, no natural manifestation (in contrast to the thunder and lightning approach at Sinai—but one should bear in mind what has just happened with the Calf): only words, which describe God’s relationship to human beings.	Moshe hastens, at the climactic moment, to plead on behalf of the people. Most curious is the fact that God does not seem to agree to “go in their midst,” nor does he ever give in and reinstate Israel with the term “my people” (see v.10). Nevertheless, it appears that the rift between deity and people has been satisfactorily repaired, given what comes next.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The New Covenant <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)34:10–28</scrip>): A preamble (vv.10–16) promises God’s continued “wonders” and warns emphatically against Israel’s mixing with the Canaanites upon its future possession of the land. Once the actual legislative content of the passage begins in v.17, one notes the continuation of the stylistic pattern which began with v.10: Deuteronomic language. The laws bespeak an agricultural society, not a nomadic one, and suggest that the warning against blending with Canaanite society may be from the perspective of a later period—an Israel long settled in the land. Although some scholars see Egypt as the origin of the Calf symbol, it also has a well-known existence in Canaanite mythology, as a symbol of Baal, god of fertility. Therefore the connection between our text and that of Kings may be close indeed, and the Calf story may have had a very contemporary ring to later audiences.	As is typical of the Calf narrative, our passage concludes, not only with wider issues—the formal writing-down of the covenant—but also with Moshe: that he neither ate nor drank during the encounter with God. We see the story both from its inception and its end concerned with the man whose task it must be to bring the divine word to the Israelite people.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Moshe Radiant <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)34:29–35</scrip>): As if to underscore the point just made, and like the Tent section in Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)33</scrip>, the Calf account ends with a focus on Moshe’s leadership. Gone is any reference to the molten image; the central concern is the effect of God’s communication upon Moshe. Indeed, “speak” occurs seven times here, and the formula “the skin of Moshe’s face was radiating” three times. Putting this section at the end of the narrative leaves the reader with the sense that Moshe’s prayer for God’s closeness in Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)33</scrip> has at last been answered, and that his very body now bears the sign of divine favor (note the use of the rich symbol of light). Communication between God and Moshe, with Israel witnessing and therefore involved again (in contrast to its removal from this activity at the beginning of Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)32</scrip>), may now proceed again without interruption, and it will now be possible and appropriate to resume construction of the structure whose purpose it is to embody God’s presence in the world of human beings.<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b>Notes<content><style><h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>32:1<exerpt><b>	saw:<content><style> Ironically, after all the “seeing” of revelation in Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)19–24</scrip>, what now impresses the people most is Moshe’s absence, leading to a need to make a god that can be “seen.” <exerpt><b>was shamefully-late: <content><style>Others, “delayed,” but the Hebrew verb <i>(boshesh) <style>carries the connotation of “causing-shame/embarrassment.” <exerpt><b>a god:<content><style> Others, “gods”; but there is one calf and one god that it represents. <exerpt><b>go before us: <content><style>As in <scrip>(Exodus)23:23</scrip> the meaning is to lead, especially in battle.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>2<exerpt><b>	Break off: <content><style>Or simply “remove.”<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>4<exerpt><b>	fashioned it with a graving-tool: <content><style>Others, “cast it in a mold” or even “tied it in a bag” (see Plaut). <exerpt><b>calf: <content><style>Or young bull, symbol of fertility in Canaan. <exerpt><b>This is your God<content><style> <exerpt><b>. . . :<content><style> Cf. <scrip>(Exodus)20:2</scrip> above, “I am Yhwh your God, who brought you out . . . .”<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>5<exerpt><b>	called out: <content><style>Or “proclaimed.”<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>6<exerpt><b>	proceeded: <content><style>Or the Hebrew <i>kum <style>can be understood as “arose,” as opposed to “sat down” in the phrase to follow. <exerpt><b>revel: <content><style>There seems to be a sexual connotation here (as in <scrip2>Gen. 26:8</scrip>; <scrip>(Exodus)39:14</scrip>, <scrip2>17</scrip>) which would support the use of the calf as the divine symbol.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>7<exerpt><b>	your people:<content><style> God not so subtly renounces his kingship of Israel. <exerpt><b>wrought ruin: <content><style>The verb <i>shahet<style> is often used to describe moral decay (see <scrip2>Gen. 6:11–12</scrip>).<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>8<exerpt><b>	turn aside from the way: <content><style>In the Bible, as in many religious systems, the correct mode of behavior is often called “the way” or “path.” Here it is probably elliptical for “the way of God.” Postbiblical Judaism calls its system of laws <i>Halakhah, <style>from the Hebrew <i>halokh,<style> “to go/walk.”<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>9<exerpt><b>	hard necked: <content><style>Others, “stiff-necked.” The usage of “hard” ironically recalls the earlier hard-hearted character, Pharaoh.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>11<exerpt><b>	soothed: <content><style>Lit. “softened.”<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>12<exerpt><b>	repent of: <content><style>Others, “change your mind.” <exerpt><b>the evil: <content><style>Destruction.

This time, as was noted by the sages of the Talmud, the order follows the natural logic of construction (i.e., dwelling, tapestries, covering, boards, sockets, bars, etc., and then the ritual objects), rather than the earlier one of sanctity (i.e., coffer, purgation-cover, table, lampstand, etc., and then the structure itself). The most notable omission is the carrying out of priestly ordination; that is reserved for <scrip2>Lev. 8</scrip>, perhaps so as not to interfere with the narrative momentum of the construction process, or else to focus more on the Dwelling itself and its divine resident. The only major interruption in this part is <scrip>(Exodus)38:21–31</scrip>, which fits in with one of the important themes of these chapters: the extent of the Israelites’ contribution to the sanctuary.	As there is no need to repeat what was said about each part of the Tabernacle in the commentary to Chaps. <scrip>(Exodus)25–31</scrip>, the commentary here will be limited to brief remarks on the differences between the two long Tabernacle sections (Parts IV and VI); here Cassuto has provided most of the necessary material.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Sabbath Restated <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)35:1–3</scrip>)<i>:<style> Bracketing the Calf Narrative, we return to the regulations concerning the Sabbath, which receive here a different explanation from what was given in <scrip>(Exodus)31:12–17</scrip>.

This factor, with the addition of a refrainlike pattern of key words (e.g., “mind,” “willing,” “service,” “work,” “wise,” “design,” “brought”), strongly portrays the people’s enthusiasm for and participation in the sacred task. Note also the fourteenfold occurrence of “every/all/entire” (Heb. <i>kol<style>) in vv.20–29.

There is a brief allusion in this verse about the “mirrors” which were the raw material for the basin; Cassuto (1967) sees this as a contemporary citing of what must have been a well-known tradition about the special contribution of the Israelite women, above and beyond the official contributions listed in Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)35</scrip>.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Courtyard II <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)38:9–20</scrip>): Corresponding to <scrip>(Exodus)27:9–19</scrip>, there are a number of wording divergencies from the earlier passage, but none of these is particularly significant.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Accountings <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)38:21–31</scrip>): A new section enters here, continuing to achieve the effect of impressing the audience. Previously the reader was to be struck by the Israelites’ zeal in piling up contributions for the new sanctuary (<scrip>(Exodus)36:3–7</scrip>); now, toward the end of the actual construction work, there is a full accounting of the considerable material that went into it. The list follows the standard order of value: gold, silver, and bronze.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Garments II <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)39:1</scrip>): Although in scribal tradition this verse is connected to the previous section, it makes sense as the start of a new one, as it concludes with what will now be in one form or another the refrain to the end of the book: “as YHWH had commanded Moshe” (see also vv.5, 21, 26, 29, 31, 32, 42, 43; then <scrip>(Exodus)40:16</scrip>, <scrip2>19</scrip>, <scrip2>21</scrip>, <scrip2>23</scrip>, <scrip2>25</scrip>, <scrip2>27</scrip>, <scrip2>29</scrip>, <scrip2>32</scrip>).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Efod and Breastpiece II <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)39:2–21</scrip>): Corresponding to <scrip>(Exodus)28:6–30</scrip>, the account of how these garments were constructed conforms to the previous pattern: their function “for remembrance” and more, so movingly laid out in Chap. <scrip>(Exodus)28</scrip>, is not mentioned.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Tunic II <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)39:22–26</scrip>): Parallel to <scrip>(Exodus)28:31–35</scrip>, this account leaves out the protective function of the tunic cited in <scrip>(Exodus)28:35</scrip>.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Other Priestly Garments II <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)39:27–29</scrip>): The parallel text is <scrip>(Exodus)28:39–43</scrip>. This passage should come after the section on the head-plate, as was the case in the earlier passages; Cassuto (1967) explains the inversion as characteristic of the construction texts—all the weaving is to take place together.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Head-Plate II <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)39:30–31</scrip>): Characteristically, the function of the plate is omitted (cf. <scrip>(Exodus)28:36–38</scrip>).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Completion of the Parts: Bringing Them to Moshe <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)39:32–43</scrip>): The listing of all the elements of the Dwelling fittingly closes the account of their construction, with a certain grandeur, and, because of the pace, even a certain excitement. The key term “service (of construction)” occurs three times.	More significant is what has long been noted: the literal parallels between our section and the initial creation story in Genesis (see, for instance, Leibowitz and Sarna 1986). The phrases “Thus was finished . . .” (vv.32), “And Moshe saw all the work: and here, they had made it” (vv.43), and “Then Moshe blessed them” (vv.43), echo “Thus were finished . . .” (<scrip2>Gen. 2:1</scrip>), “Now God saw all that he had made,/and here: it was exceedingly good” (<scrip2>Gen. 1:31</scrip>), and “God gave the seventh day his blessing” (<scrip2>Gen. 2:3</scrip>). At the end of the passage describing the erection of the Tabernacle, there is an additional parallel: “So Moshe finished the work” (<scrip>(Exodus)40:33</scrip>); cf. <scrip2>Gen. 2:2</scrip>: “God had finished . . . his work.” The close parallels suggest what we find in the case of many cultures: human building, especially (but not exclusively) of sanctuaries, is to be viewed as an act of imitating God. The Israelites, at the close of the book chronicling their founding as a people, link up with God’s scheme in creating the world. The Dwelling is therefore a reflection of the perfection of the world and the divine hand that oversees it. Yet neither the people nor Moshe pronounces the Genesis words “it was (exceedingly) good” over the sanctuary; that would be human <i>hubris.<style><h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Final Instructions: Setting Up <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)40:1–16</scrip>): Most prominent in God’s commands to erect the Tabernacle are two related verbs: “hallow” and “anoint,” each of which occurs in one form or another eight times here. So the major theme here is not the actual building, but dedication for a purpose. Included in this section, as it was in Part IV, is the appointment of Aharon and his sons to “be-priests.”	The completion of the sanctuary takes place, appropriately, on the first day of what was the month of the exodus a year earlier; it is also ten months after the people reached Sinai. The dedication thus combines the ideas of sacred space and sacred time.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Implementation <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)40:17–33</scrip>): Meaningfully, the formula “as <p.small>Yhwh</p.small> had commanded Moshe” ends each of the seven paragraphs that describe the erection of the Dwelling.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The End: God’s Glory <content><style> (<scrip1>(Exodus)40:34–38</scrip>): The book ends, not with a paean to the completed structure or its builders, but with a description of how its purpose was fulfilled. Central is the “cloud,” basically synonymous with God’s “Glory,” which now dwells among the people of Israel. At the end of the book of Exodus, which began with a people in servitude to an earthly god-king, we find a people that has completed one aspect of service to a divine king, ready to set forth on their journey to a Promised Land in the company of the king’s inextinguishable presence.<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b>Notes<content><style><h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>35:3<exerpt><b>	You are not to let fire burn: <content><style>This prohibition perhaps reflects the anthropological use of fire as a transforming force in culture (see Fredman).
