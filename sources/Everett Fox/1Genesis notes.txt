While this sounds simple enough, it is not usually possible in translation. Indeed, the premise of almost all Bible translations, past and present, is that the “meaning” of the text should be conveyed in as clear and comfortable a manner as possible in one’s own language. Yet the truth is that the Bible was not written in English in the twentieth or even the seventeenth century; it is ancient, sometimes obscure, and speaks in a way quite different from ours. Accordingly, I have sought here primarily to echo the style of the original, believing that the Bible is best approached, at least at the beginning, on its own terms. So I have presented the text in English dress but with a Hebraic voice.	The result looks and sounds very different from what we are accustomed to encountering as the Bible, whether in the much-loved grandeur of the King James Version or the clarity and easy fluency of the many recent attempts. There are no old friends here; Eve will not, as in old paintings, give Adam an apple (nor will she be called “Eve”), nor will Moses speak of himself as “a stranger in a strange land,” as beautiful as that sounds. Instead, the reader will encounter a text which challenges him or her to rethink what these ancient books are and what they mean, and will hopefully be encouraged to become an active listener rather than a passive receiver.<align=0><font12><content>This translation is guided by the principle that the Hebrew Bible, like much of the literature of antiquity, was meant to be read aloud, and that consequently it must be translated with careful attention to rhythm and sound. The translation therefore tries to mimic the particular rhetoric of the Hebrew whenever possible, preserving such devices as repetition, allusion, alliteration, and wordplay. It is intended to echo the Hebrew, and to lead the reader back to the sound structure and form of the original.	Such an approach was first espoused by Martin Buber and Franz Rosenzweig in their monumental German translation of the Bible (1925–1962) and in subsequent interpretive essays. <i>The Five Books of Moses<style> is in many respects an offshoot of the Buber-Rosenzweig translation (hereafter abbreviated as B-R). I began with their principles: that translations of individual words should reflect “primal” root meanings, that translations of phrases, lines, and whole verses should mimic the syntax of the Hebrew, and that the vast web of allusions and wordplays present in the text should be somehow perceivable in the target language (for a full exposition in English, see now Buber and Rosenzweig 1994). In all these areas I have taken a more moderate view than my German mentors, partly because I think there are limitations to these principles and partly because recent scholarship points in broader directions. As a result, my translation is on the whole less radical and less strange in English than B-R was in German. This, however, does not mean that it is less different from conventional translations, or that I have abandoned the good fight for a fresh look at the Bible’s verbal power.	Buber and Rosenzweig based their approach on the Romantic nineteenthcentury notion that the Bible was essentially oral literature written down. In the present century there have been Bible scholars who have found this view attractive; on the other hand, there has been little agreement on how oral roots manifest themselves in the text. One cannot suggest that the Bible is a classic work of oral literature in the same sense as the <i>Iliad<style> or <i>Beowulf.<style> It does not employ regular meter or rhyme, even in sections that are clearly formal poetry. The text of the Bible that we possess is most likely a mixture of oral and written materials from a variety of periods and sources, and recovering anything resembling original oral forms would seem to be impossible. This is particularly true given the considerable chronological and cultural distance at which we stand from the text, which does not permit us to know how it was performed in ancient times.	A more fruitful approach, less dependent upon theories whose historical accuracy is unprovable, might be to focus on the way in which the biblical text, <i>once completed,<style> was copied and read. Recent research reveals that virtually all literature in Greek and Roman times—the period when the Hebrew Bible was put into more or less the form in which it has come down to us (but not the period of its composition)—was read aloud. This holds for the process of copying or writing, and also, surprisingly, for solitary reading. As late as the last decade of the fourth century, Saint Augustine expressed surprise at finding a sage who read silently. Such practices and attitudes seem strange to us, for whom the very definition of a library, for instance, is a place where people have to keep quiet. But it was a routine in the world of antiquity, as many sources attest.	So the Bible, if not an oral document, is certainly an aural one; it would have been read aloud as a matter of course. But the implications of this for understanding the text are considerable. The rhetoric of the text is such that many passages and sections are understandable in depth only when they are analyzed <i>as they are heard.<style> Using echoes, allusions, and powerful inner structures of sound, the text is often able to convey ideas in a manner that vocabulary alone cannot do. A few illustrations may suffice to introduce this phenomenon to the reader; it will be encountered constantly throughout this volume.	Sound plays a crucial role in one of the climactic sequences in Genesis, Chapters <scrip>(Genesis)32–33</scrip>. Jacob, the protagonist, has not seen his brother Esau for twenty years. Now a rich and successful adult, he is on his way back to Canaan after a long exile. He sends messengers to forestall Esau’s vengeance—for twenty years earlier, Jacob had stolen the birthright and the blessing which Esau felt were rightly his own. When Jacob finds out that his brother “is already coming . . . and four hundred men are with him” (<scrip>(Genesis)32:7</scrip>), he goes even further, preparing an elaborate gift for Esau in the hopes of appeasing his anger. The text in vv.21–22 presents Jacob’s thoughts and actions (the translation is taken from the New English Bible):<align=40><font12><content><style>	for he thought, “I will appease him with the present that I have sent on ahead, and afterwards, when I come into his presence, he will perhaps receive me kindly.” So Jacob’s present went on ahead of him. . . .<align=0><font12><content>This is an accurate and highly idiomatic translation of the Hebrew, and the reader will notice nothing unusual about the passage as it reads in English. The sound of the Hebrew text, on the other hand, gives one pause. It is built on variations of the word <i>panim,<style> whose basic meaning is “face,” although the Hebrew uses it idiomatically to encompass various ideas. (Note: in Hebrew, the sound <i>p<style> is pronounced as <i>ph<style> under certain circumstances.) If the text is translated with attention to sound, its quite striking oral character emerges (italics mine):<align=40><font12><content><style>	For he said to himself:<align=40>	I will wipe (the anger from) his <i>face (phanav)<style><align=40>	with the gift that goes ahead of my <i>face; (le-phanai)<style><align=40>	afterward, when I see his <i>face, (phanav)<style><align=40>	perhaps he will lift up my <i>face! (phanai)<style><align=40>	The gift crossed over ahead of his <i>face. . . . (al panav)<style><align=0><font12><content>Comparison of these two English versions is instructive. In the New English Bible, as in most other contemporary versions, the translators are apparently concerned with presenting the text in clear, modern, idiomatic English. For example, they render the Hebrew <i>yissa phanai<style> as “receive me kindly.” The N.E.B. translates the <i>idea<style> of the text; at the same time it translates <i>out<style> the sound by not picking up on the repetition of <i>panim<style> words.	What does the reader gain by hearing the literalness of the Hebrew? And what is lost by the use of its idiomatic meaning? As mirrored in the second translation, it is clear that our text is signaling something of significance. The motif of “face” (which might be interpreted as “facing” or “confrontation”) occurs at crucial points in the story. The night before his fateful meeting with Esau, as he is left to ponder the next day’s events, Jacob wrestles with a mysterious stranger—a divine being. After Jacob’s victory, the text reports (<scrip>(Genesis)32:31</scrip>):<align=40><font12><content><style>	Yaakov called the name of the place: Peniel/<i>Face of God,<style><align=40>	for: I have seen God,<align=40>	<i>face to face,<style><align=40>	and my life has been saved.<align=0><font12><content>The repetition suggests a thematic link with what has gone before. One could interpret that once the hero has met and actually bested this divine being, his coming human confrontation is assured of success. Thus upon meeting Esau at last, Jacob says to him (<scrip>(Genesis)33:10</scrip>):<align=40>	For I have, after all, seen your <i>face,<style> as one sees the <i>face<style> of God,<align=40>	and you have been gracious to me.<align=0><font12><content>It could be said that in a psychological sense the meetings with divine and human adversaries are a unity, the representation of one human process in two narrative episodes. This is accomplished by the repetition of the word <i>panim<style> in the text.	The above interpretation depends entirely on sound. Once that focus is dropped, either through the silent reading of the text or a standard translation, the inner connections are simply lost and the reader is robbed of the opportunity to make these connections for himself. Clearly there is a difference between translating what the text means and translating what it says.	While the Jacob passages use the sound of a specific word to indicate an important motif in the narrative, there are other cases where sound brings out structure, and the structure itself conveys the principal idea of the passage. A striking example of this is found at the beginning of Genesis. God’s first acts of creation in <scrip>(Genesis)1:3–5</scrip> are portrayed in a highly ordered fashion, suggesting that creation itself is orderly, and this idea is the thematic backbone of the whole chapter. We are meant to experience the orderliness of God’s activity through the sensuality of the language and through the particular way in which the text speaks. A translation keyed to the sound of the Hebrew reads:<align=40>	God said: Let there be light! And there was light.<align=40>	God saw the light: that it was good.<align=40>	God separated the light from the darkness.<align=40>	God called the light: Day! and the darkness he called: Night!<align=0><font12><content>The four occurrences of “God” plus verb accomplish the narrator’s goal, and give a tone to the creation account that makes it akin to poetry. In contrast, virtually all modern translations treat the passage as prose, rendering it into clear written English but simultaneously removing its inner structure. What remains is a statement of what is taking place in the narrative, but without its underlying thrust. Again the New English Bible:<align=40>	God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light; and God saw that the light was good, and he separated light from darkness. He called the light day, and the darkness night.<align=0><font12><content>This translation is cast in good English style. For just that reason two occurrences of “God” have been omitted, and the passage consequently reads smoothly—so smoothly that one glides past it as if creation were the same as any other narrated action. But what has been lost is the characteristic oral ring of the text, and simultaneously its intent to say something beyond the content of words alone.	Another example of translating with an ear to the sound and structure of the original, this time from the book of Exodus, comes from the dramatic story of the Sea of Reeds (<scrip>(Exodus)14:11–12</scrip>). The newly freed Israelites find themselves pursued by their former masters, the Pharaoh and his army; with their backs to the Sea, they panic, and bitterly harangue their would-be deliverer, Moses. The present translation, attempting to reflect the repetition and structure of the original, yields the following:<align=40>	they said to Moshe:<align=40>	Is it because there are no graves in Egypt<align=40>	that you have taken us out to die in the wilderness?<align=40>	What is this that you have done to us, bringing us out of Egypt?<align=40>	Is this not the very word that we spoke to you in Egypt,<align=40>	saying: Let us alone, that we may serve Egypt!<align=40>	Indeed, better for us serving Egypt<align=40>	than our dying in the wilderness!<align=0><font12><content>This passage demonstrates several aspects of a rhetorical translation method, if we may so term it: the laying out of the text in “cola” or lines meant to facilitate reading aloud (more on this below); the repetition of words—“Egypt” five times and “wilderness” twice—to stress the irony of the Israelites’ predicament (as they see it, Egypt means life, and the wilderness, certain death); and the double use of “serve,” the very word that Moses constantly drummed into Pharaoh’s ears in the early part of the book to denote the Israelites’ desire to go and worship their God (“Send free my people, that they may serve me”). If we juxtapose the above translation with that found in, say, the New International Version, the importance of this approach to the text becomes clear:<align=40>	They said to Moses, “Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us to the desert to die? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt? Didn’t we say to you in Egypt, ‘Leave us alone; let us serve the Egyptians’? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!”<align=0><font12><content>Here the rhetorical force of the Hebrew has been ignored. The Hebrew text does not transpose “desert to die” to “die in the desert” at the end of the passage (the word order repeats in the original, for emphasis); it does not distinguish in sound between “Egypt” and “Egyptians”; and it certainly does not read like standard colloquial prose. Indeed, all of Chapter 14 of Exodus demonstrates the Bible’s use of an intermediate form between poetry and prose, a form designed to instruct as well as to inspire.	But it is not only in narrative that the rhetoric of biblical language makes itself felt. Fully half of the book of Exodus is law or instruction, and one can find there further examples of the importance of sound structure in the Bible. Take, for instance, the law concerning the protection of widows and orphans (<scrip>(Exodus)22:23–24</scrip>). This time I shall present the text first through the eyes of the Jerusalem Bible:<align=40>	You must not be harsh with the widow, or with the orphan; if you are harsh with them, they will surely cry out to me, and be sure that I shall hear their cry; my anger will flare and I shall kill you with the sword, your own wives will be widows, your own children orphans.<align=0><font12><content>This is powerful language, especially in a law code. But the Hebrew text goes much farther, utilizing as it does a double form of the verb rarely found in multiple sequence:<align=40>	Any widow or orphan you are not to afflict.<align=40>	Oh, if you afflict, afflict them . . . !<align=40>	For (then) they will cry, cry out to me,<align=40>	and I will hearken, hearken to their cry,<align=40>	my anger will flare up<align=40>	and I will kill you with the sword,<align=40>	so that your wives become widows, and your children, orphans!<align=0><font12><content>Here the text is in effect slowed down by the division into lines, and the verb forms are isolated to underscore their unique rhetoric. The effect of the whole is to focus attention on this particular law among a host of others.<align=1><font12><b>2<align=0><font12><content><style>Once the spokenness of the Bible is understood as a critical factor in the translation process, a number of practical steps become necessary which constitute radical changes from past translation practices. Buber and Rosenzweig introduced three such major innovations into their work: the form in which the text is laid out, the reproduction of biblical names and their meanings, and the “leading-word” technique by means of which important repetitions in the Hebrew are retained in translation.	First, as is obvious from the excerpts quoted above, the translated text is printed in lines resembling blank verse. These “cola” are based primarily on spoken phrasing. In Buber’s view, each unit represents simultaneously a unit of breathing and of meaning, thus illustrating the deep connection between form and content in the Hebrew Bible. While current scholars, myself included, would not agree with Buber that the text’s rhetoric necessarily corresponds to “breathing,” cola divisions do facilitate reading aloud and make it possible for the listener to sense the text’s inner rhythm—and only at that point can the text begin to deliver its message with full force.	Cola do not correspond to the traditional verse divisions found in printed Bibles. Those divisions are of late origin (perhaps from the ninth century, in written form), and were adopted for the sake of reference. Jews and Christians have used them in roughly the same form since the middle ages. Cola, on the other hand, arise from the experience of reading the Hebrew text aloud and of feeling its spoken rhythms. The specific divisions used in this volume are somewhat arbitrary; each reader will hear the text differently. My line divisions are sometimes identical to B-R, but often are not; they sometimes correspond to the punctuation laid down by Jewish tradition (the Masoretic accents or <i>trop<style>), but not always. What is most important, however, is that the practice of dividing the text into lines points away from the apprehension of the Bible as a written book and restores the sense of it as spoken performance.	Second, personal and place names generally appear in Hebrew forms throughout this translation. Thus, for example, the Hebrew <i>Moshe<style> is retained instead of Moses, <i>Kayin<style> instead of Cain, <i>Rivka<style> instead of Rebecca, and <i>Bil’am<style> instead of Balaam. This practice stems from the central role that names play in biblical stories (as often in literature). In biblical Israel as throughout the ancient world, names are often meant to give clues about their bearer’s personality or fate. The meaning of a name is often explained outright in the text itself. In <i>The Five Books of Moses<style> this is represented by a slash in the text, as in the following example (<scrip2>Gen. 30:23–24</scrip>):<align=40>	She said:<align=40>	God has removed/<i>asaf<style><align=40>	my reproach.<align=40>	And she called his name: Yosef,<align=40>	saying:<align=40>	May <p.small>Yhwh </p.small> add/<i>yosef<style><align=40>	another son to me.<align=0><font12><content>The name here is a play on words, hinting at Joseph’s eventual fate (he will be a son “removed” and “added,” that is, lost and found by his family). By retaining the Hebrew sounds in translation, a meaningful portion of the narrative is thus moved from footnotes, where it appears in most modern translations, back to the body of the text. That this is important is demonstrated by the fact that virtually every major (usually male) character in Genesis has his name explained in this manner.	It should be noted that such interpretations of names in the Bible are not based on philological derivations, that is, on scientific etymology. The name Jacob/Yaakov, for instance, which is understood in <scrip2>Gen. 25</scrip> as “Heel-Holder” and in Chapter 27 as “Heel-Sneak,” probably held the original meaning of “may (God) protect.” But the biblical writers were not so much concerned with what a name originally meant as they were with its sound, and with the associations inherent in that sound. Therefore what is important in our example is that “Yaakov” recalls <i>ekev,<style> “heel.” This kind of interpretation is known as “folk etymology” or “popular etymology.” A similar phenomenon appears in the naming of Moses (<scrip2>Ex. 2:10</scrip>).	A third important technique with which biblical literature often conveys its message, and which must influence the translation of the text, is what Buber called the “leading-word” (<i>Leitwort<style>) principle. Key (“leading”) words are repeated within a text to signify major themes and concerns, like recurring themes in a piece of music (hence the similarity of Buber’s term to composer Richard Wagner’s word <i>Leitmotif<style>). A leading-word operates on the basis of sound: the repetition of a word or word root encourages the listener to make connections between diverse parts of a story (or even of a book), and to trace a particular theme throughout. This is not to be seen, however, as a static process. A leading-word may appear in different forms and contexts, with changed meaning, thus lending a sense of movement and development to the text and its characters. One example may be cited here; others appear throughout this book.	Buber’s essay, “Abraham the Seer,” traces the biblical tradition’s portrayal of Abraham through the use of key words and phrases in the text. Chief among these is the verb “to see” (Hebrew <i>ra’o<style>), which appears constantly in the Abraham narratives and which tells us something significant about both the man himself and how he is meant to be remembered. At the outset of Abraham’s journey to Canaan, which signals his entry into biblical tradition as an independent personality, God sends him off to a land that he will “let him see” (<scrip>(Genesis)12:1</scrip>). Arriving in the land, Abraham is granted a communication from God, expressed by the phrase “<p.small>Yhwh</p.small> was seen by Avram . . .” (<scrip>(Genesis)12:7</scrip>). God subsequently promises the land to him and his descendants (“see from the place that you are . . . for all the land that you see, to you I give it and to your seed, for the ages” [<scrip>(Exodus)13:15</scrip>]). “Seeing” comes to the fore in the story of Abraham’s concubine Hagar; her encounter with God’s messenger ends with her addressing a “God of Seeing” (<scrip>(Genesis)16:13</scrip>). Further meetings between Abraham and God (<scrip>(Genesis)17:1</scrip>, <scrip2>18:1</scrip>) likewise express themselves visually, with the latter scene, where God announces Isaac’s impending birth at Abraham’s tent, almost unique in the Bible for its bold picture of God appearing directly to human beings. Finally, with the great test of Abraham in Chapter 22, the “Binding of Isaac,” the theme of seeing is brought to a climax. Buber describes the use of the leading-word in that passage, summarizing how it rounds out the entire Abraham cycle:<align=40>	It appears here more often than in any previous passage. Abraham sees the place where the act must be accomplished, at a distance. To the question of his son, he replies that God will provide (“see to”) the lamb for the burnt offering. In the saving moment he lifts up his eyes and sees the ram. And now he proclaims over the altar the name that makes known the imperishable essence of this place, Mount Moriah: <p.small>Yhwh</p.small> Will See. . . . God sees man, and man sees God. God sees Abraham, and tests him by seeing him as the righteous and “whole” man who walks before his God (<scrip>(Genesis)17:1</scrip>), and now, at the end of his road, he conquers even this final place, the holy temple mountain, by acting on God’s behalf. Abraham sees God with the eye of his action and so recognizes Him, just as Moses, seeing God’s glory “from behind,” will recognize Him as Gracious and Merciful.<content><font10><sup><link></scrip></scrip><font12><rev><align=0><font12><content>Buber goes one step further in his analysis of the leading-word <i>see:<style> he views it as a clue to the biblical concept of Abraham’s role in history. Taking the hint from <scrip2>(1Sam 9:9)I Sam. 9:9</scrip> (“the prophet of our day was formerly called a seer”), he posits that the Bible wants us to understand Abraham as the spiritual father of the later prophets. Abraham, then, is preeminent as the first man in the Bible of whom it is reported that God “was seen by him.”	Such an understanding of the role of leading-words as crucial to biblical style rarely makes itself felt in translation. Bible translators are reluctant to reproduce repetitions of Hebrew words in the text because they are generally fearful of creating a tedious English style. However, once one abandons the idea of the Bible as primarily a written work, the repetitiveness of leading-words becomes a signal rather than a stumbling block, freeing the reader to experience the dynamic manner in which the Bible expresses itself. That this sometimes entails a loss of nuance in the translation (where “see” in Hebrew may signify “perceive” or “understand” in a particular passage, for instance) is a price that must be paid; yet such a translation may in fact retain more of the breadth of the Hebrew than is immediately apparent.	A final word needs to be said about the leading-word technique. It may serve a purpose in the text beyond conveying meaning: it may play a structural role, unifying sections that have been culled from different sources within biblical Israel to form a composite account. The ancient redactors of the Bible apparently crafted the material they received into an organic whole. Using such means as leading-word repetition, they in effect created a new literature in which deep relationships exist between the parts of the whole.	The above three translation techniques—setting out the text in cola, transliterating and explaining Hebrew names, and reproducing leading-words—form the crux of an approach to the Bible’s spokenness, but there are other methods used by the text to the same end. Three are particularly worthy of mention: wordplay, allusion, and what I have termed small-scale repetition.	The Bible uses wordplay to make a point forcefully, especially in prophetic passages or those with a prophetic flavor. In <scrip2>Gen. 40:13</scrip> and <scrip2>19</scrip>, for instance, Joseph predicts that the king of Egypt will end the imprisonment of two of his courtiers. When the cupbearer is to be restored to his former position, Joseph says,<align=40>	in another three days<align=40>	Pharaoh will lift up your head. . . .<align=0><font12><content>In contrast, when Joseph predicts that the chief baker will be executed, the text reads:<align=40>	in another three days Pharaoh will lift up your head<align=40>	from off you. . . .<align=0><font12><content>By beginning both statements with the same phrasing, the narrator is able to heighten the impact of “from off you” on both audience and victim.	A powerful example of the second device, allusion, occurs near the beginning of Exodus. Baby Moses, floating precariously yet fetus-like on the Nile, is one of the enduring images in the book, as children have long attested. Modern English readers, however, are seldom aware that the Hebrew word for Moses’s floating cradle—rendered by virtually all standard translations as “basket”—is the same as the one used in <scrip2>Gen. 6:14</scrip>ff. to describe Noah’s famous vessel (<i>teiva<style>). Preserving the connection between the two, as I have tried to do in the Exodus passage with “little-ark” (and which, incidentally, the authors of the King James Version did with “ark”), is to keep open the play of profound meaning that exists between the two stories.	Finally, we may give an example of small-scale repetition. Unlike the leading-word technique, this is limited to a brief report and is used to express one specific idea. In <scrip2>Gen. 6:11–13</scrip>, for instance, it illustrates an important biblical concept: just punishment. Three times in the passage we hear the word “ruin,” indicating what human evil has done to the world; the fourth time (v.13) it appears in a causative form, to show that God retaliates in exactly the same terms, measure for measure.<align=40>	Now the earth had gone to <i>ruin<style> before God; the earth was filled withwrongdoing.<align=40>	God saw the earth, and here: it had gone to <i>ruin,<style><align=40>	for all flesh had <i>ruined<style> its way upon the earth.<align=40>	God said to Noah:<align=40>	An end of all flesh has come before me,<align=40>	for the earth is filled with wrongdoing through them;<align=40>	here, I will bring <i>ruin<style> upon them, along with the earth.<align=0><font12><content>The Bible is fond of this technique, which it uses in a number of narratives that deal with human misbehavior (e.g., the Tower of Babel story in <scrip2>Gen. 11</scrip>). It is another example of how the form in which the text is cast goes a long way toward expressing its intent.	 From the above examples it may appear that it is not difficult to carry out the Buber-Rosenzweig principles in a translation. In practice, however, the translator who wishes to bring the language spoken by his audience into consonance with the style of the Hebrew text runs the risk of doing violence to that language, forced as he or she is into “hebraizing” the language. There will of necessity be a certain strangeness and some awkward moments in such a translation. Buber and Rosenzweig themselves came under fire for creating a strange new kind of German in their work; one critic in 1933 accused them of “unusual affectations.” My renditions of the Torah books, while limited in what they wreak with the English language both by my cautiousness and by the less pliable nature of English (than German), have been liable to similar characterization, especially in the legal sections.	 This problem, however, is inherent in this kind of undertaking, and I have accepted its risks willingly. In the last generation there have been any number of clear, smooth-reading translations of the Bible, all aimed at making the text readily accessible to the reader. I have taken a different road, arguing (along with Buber and Rosenzweig) that the reader must be prepared to meet the Bible at least halfway and must become an active participant in the process of the text, rather than a passive listener. To this end, there is no alternative but to force the language of the translation to become the instrument through which the Hebraic voice of the text speaks.	 I have taken pains to illustrate some of the rhetorical devices that emerge from an oral reading of the text in order to indicate the direction taken in <i>The Five Books of Moses.<style> A concluding observation must be made. Every critic knows, or should know, that art defies categorization and exact description. We try to understand what makes a masterpiece tick, whether it be a painting, a piece of music, or a work of literature, yet in the end our analyses fall silent before the greatness and subtlety of the work itself. The techniques that I have described above must remain suggestive rather than definitive; they point out a direction rather than speak directly. Biblical narratives do not end with the phrase “The moral of the story is . . . ,” any more than biblical laws overtly spell out their assumptions. Translating with attention to sound therefore may help to preserve not only the message of the text but also its ambiguity and open-endedness. In that persona the Bible has been familiar to Jewish and Christian interpreters, who for centuries have sought to fill in the gaps and resolve the difficulties in the text by means of their own ingenuity. This volume is aimed at helping present-day readers to share in that experience.<align=1><font14><b>3<align=0><font12><content><style>Reading the Bible in the literary, rhetorical manner I have just explicated is grounded in certain assumptions about the text. <i>The Five Books of Moses<style> stays close to the basic “masoretic” text-type of the Torah, that is, the vocalized text that has been with us for certain for about a millennium. Deviations from that form, in the interest of solving textual problems, are duly mentioned in the Notes. In following the traditional Hebrew text, I am presenting to the English reader an unreconstructed book, but one whose form is at least verifiable in a long-standing tradition. This translation, therefore, is not a translation of some imagined “original” text, or of the Torah of Moses’ or Solomon’s or even Jeremiah’s time. These documents, could they be shown to have existed for certain or in recognizable form, have not been found, and give little promise of ever being found. <i>The Five Books of Moses<style> is, rather, a translation of the biblical text as it might have been known in the formative, postbiblical period of Judaism and early Christianity (the Roman era). As far as the prehistory of the text is concerned, readers who have some familiarity with biblical criticism will note that in my Commentary I have made scant reference to the by-now classic dissection of the Torah into clear-cut prior “sources” (designated J, E, P, and D by the Bible scholars of the past century). Such analysis has been dealt with comprehensively by others (cf., for instance, Levine on the book of Numbers). In addition, it remains a theoretical construct, and the nature of biblical texts militates against recovering the exact process by which the Bible came into being. In any event, virtually all the standard introductions to the Bible deal with this topic; beyond these, readers may find Friedman (1989) of particular clarity and usefulness.	Given the text that I am using, what has interested me here is chiefly the final form of the Torah books, how they fit together as artistic entities, and how they have combined traditions to present a coherent religious message. This was surely the goal of the final “redactor(s),” but it was not until recently a major goal of biblical scholars. While, therefore, I am not committed to refuting the tenets of source criticism in the strident manner of Benno Jacob and Umberto Cassuto, I have concentrated in this volume on the “wholeness” of biblical texts, rather than on their growth out of fragments. My Commentary is aimed at helping the reader to search for unities and thematic development.	 At the same time, in recent years I have found it increasingly fascinating to encounter the text’s complex layering. It appears that every time a biblical story or law was put in a new setting or redaction, its meaning, and the meaning of the whole, must have been somewhat altered. A chorus of different periods and concerns is often discernible, however faintly. Sometimes these function to “deconstruct” each other, and sometimes they actually create a new text. In offering a rendition that does not try to gloss over stylistic differences, I hope that this book will make it possible for an inquisitive reader to sense that process at work. As far as analysis of the text in this manner is concerned, I would recommend to the reader the brilliant work of Greenstein (1985a) and Damrosch (1987).<align=1><font14><b>4<align=0><font12><content><style>Some readers may wonder whether <i>The Five Books of Moses<style> is merely an English translation of B-R. It is not. Although B-R served as the theoretical basis for my work, I have found it necessary to modify their approach in the present setting. There are a number of reasons for this.	 For one, Bible scholarship has made notable advances since Buber’s heyday (Rosenzweig had already died in 1929). Although he completed the German translation in 1961, and kept abreast of work in the field, it must be said that Buber did not greatly modify the text of the Pentateuch translation, philologically speaking, between 1930 when the second edition appeared and the revised printings of the mid-1950s. It seemed imperative to me to bring the work of postwar biblical philology to bear on the English translation, rather than relying solely on Buber’s etymologies. Some of the changes in this area have been cited in the Notes to the text (as “B-R uses . . .”).	Second, in the attempt to make the German translation mirror the Hebrew original Rosenzweig did not hesitate to either create new German words or reach back into the German literature of past ages to find forms suitable for rendering certain Hebrew expressions. To perform a corresponding feat in English would simply not work; the language is not flexible, and usages change so quickly that an artful appeal to the past seems futile except for the benefit of linguistic historians. While I have endeavored to produce an English text that reflects the style of biblical Hebrew, I have in the main shied away from pushing the language beyond reasonable and comprehensible limits.	There are other significant deviations from B-R here. I have used a different rendering of the name of God, which had been a distinctive B-R trademark (for an explanation, see “On the Name of God and Its Translation”). I have sometimes opted for different line divisions, based on my own hearing of the Hebrew; indented purely poetic passages, a practice not followed by B-R in narrative texts; read a large number of clauses differently from a grammatical or syntactical point of view; and loosened the practice, sometimes overdone in B-R, of reproducing a Hebrew root by a single English one wherever it occurs.	It will be noted that I have included here one element that many readers felt was sorely lacking in B-R: notes and commentary. Every translation of the Bible implies a commentary, but few have included one with the text. <i>The Five Books of Moses<style> especially requires such an apparatus, both to explain its translation technique and to show how it may be used fruitfully in interpreting the Bible. Read in conjunction with the text, the explanatory material presents a methodology for studying and teaching the Bible.	Finally, there is the personal aspect of this work. It was conceived as an act of homage to the B-R translation; at the beginning, I desired solely (and rashly) to bring their accomplishment over into English. It was therefore a labor of love, and despite the amount of work involved, a relatively safe one; I did not, at least initially, have to make my own decisions about the biblical text. I should certainly never have undertaken my own translation at that stage.	But working on a project of this nature inevitably leads to things that are not predictable at the outset. It happened exactly as Rosenzweig wrote about his own involvement: like a seduction. It soon became apparent that, not only could I not in good conscience do to English what especially Rosenzweig had done to German, but I was also beginning to find my own voice as creator and scholar in the translation. Thus—although this was not my original intention—I am quite aware that in this book I am presenting a piece of myself as well as an approach to the Bible for English readers.	This having been said, <i>The Five Books of Moses<style> is still very much in the B-R tradition. It retains the general approach of its predecessor, exclusive of those principles that are dependent on the form and character of the German language. It is therefore the child of B-R, with all the links and independent features that a parent-child relationship implies. It may also be seen as an attempt to bring the work of B-R into a new era of Bible scholarship, and as an artistic endeavor in its own right.<align=1><font14><b>5<align=0><font12><content><pi>The Five Books of Moses<style> is heavily indebted to B-R, but one may also view it in a more contemporary context. Over the past two decades, there has been an explosion of “literary” study of the Bible. Numerous scholars have turned their attention to the form and rhetoric of the biblical text, concentrating on its finished form rather than on trying to reconstruct history or the development of the text. Such an approach is hardly new. Already in late antiquity, Jewish interpretation of the Bible often centered around the style and precise wording of the text, especially as heard when read aloud. Similarly, the medieval Jewish commentators of Spain and France showed great sensitivity to the linguistic aspects of the Bible. In both cases, however, no systematic approach was developed; literary interpretation remained interwoven with very different concerns such as homiletics, mysticism, and philosophy.	It has remained for twentieth-century scholars, reacting partly against what they perceived to be the excessive historicizing of German Bible scholarship, to press for a literary reading of the Bible. Early pioneers in this regard include Umberto Cassuto, Buber and (later) Meir Weiss in Israel, and Benno Jacob (who was consulted frequently during the writing of B-R) in Germany. More recently we might mention James Muilenberg (who labeled his holistic approach “Rhetorical Criticism”), Edwin Good, James Ackerman, and Robert Alter in the U.S.; and J. P. Fokkelman in Holland. These names are now the tip of the iceberg, and one can speak of a whole school of interpreters in a literary or rhetorical vein. The reader will find a number of stimulating studies listed in “Suggestions for Further Reading.”	<i>The Five Books of Moses<style> is akin to many of these efforts, and has benefited directly from them. Although I began my work independently of the literary movement, I have come to feel a kinship with it, and regard my text as one that may be used to study the Bible in a manner consistent with its findings. At the same time, I am not committed to throwing out historical scholarship wholesale. It would be a mistake to set up the two disciplines in an adversarial relationship, as has often been done. The Hebrew Bible is by nature a complex and multi-faceted literature, in both its origins and the history of its use and interpretation. No one “school” can hope to illuminate more than part of the whole picture, and even then, one’s efforts are bound to be fragmentary. Probably, only a synthesis of all fruitful approaches available into a fully interdisciplinary methodology will provide a satisfactory overview of the biblical text (see Greenstein 1989). In this respect, approaching the Bible is analogous to dealing with the arts in general, where a multitude of disciplines from aesthetics to the social and natural sciences is needed to flesh out the whole. I hope that <i>The Five Books of Moses<style> will make a contribution toward this process, by providing an English text, and an underlying reading of the Hebrew, that balances what has appeared previously.	There is another more recent movement in biblical studies which deserves both mention and study. As of this writing, feminist Bible criticism has come into its own. A substantial number of thoughtful and thought-provoking studies have appeared in recent years that examine the portrayal and position of women in biblical texts. One of the glaring gaps in previous Bible scholarship—and one of the difficult issues for contemporary readers of the Bible—lies in coming to terms with the social/sexual milieu assumed by the text. Wrestling with this issue is an appropriate complement to the other types of text-wrestling that have taken place throughout the ages. I have tried to present some of the findings of feminist criticism on the text, and I have listed some appropriate recent works in “Suggestions for Further Reading.”<align=1><font14><b>6<align=0><font12><content><style>To what extent can any translation of the Bible be said to be more “authentic” than another? Because of lack of information about the various original audiences of our text, the translator can only try to be as faithful as the information will allow. This is particularly true where a work as universally known as the Bible is concerned. Even if the precise circumstances surrounding its writing and editing were known, the text would still be affected by the interpretations of the centuries. It is as if a Beethoven symphony were to be performed on period instruments, using nineteenth-century performance techniques: would it still sound as fresh and radical to us as it did in Beethoven’s own day? Thus I would suggest that it is almost impossible to reproduce the Bible’s impact on its contemporaries; all that the translator can do is to perform the task with as much honesty as possible, with a belief in one’s artistic intuition and a consciousness of one’s limitations.	Yet how are we to distinguish the point where explication ends and personal interpretation begins? From the very moment of the Bible’s editing and promulgation, there began the historical process of interpretation, a process which has at times led to violent disagreement between individuals and even nations. Everyone who has ever taken the Bible seriously has staked so much on a particular interpretation of the text that altering it has become close to a matter of life and death. Nothing can be done about this situation, unfortunately, and once again the translator must do the best he or she can. Art, by its very nature, gives rise to interpretation—else it is not great art. The complexity and ambiguity of great literature invites interpretation, just as the complexities and ambiguities of its interpreters encourage a wide range of perspectives. The Hebrew Bible, in which very diverse material has been juxtaposed in a far-ranging collection spanning centuries, rightly or wrongly pushes the commentator and reader to make inner connections and draw overarching conclusions. My interpretations in this book stem from this state of affairs. I have tried to do my work as carefully and as conscientiously as I can, recognizing the problems inherent in this kind of enterprise. I hope the result is not too far from what the biblical editors had intended.	My ultimate goal in this volume has been to show that reading the Hebrew Bible is a process, in the same sense that performing a piece of music is a process. Rather than carrying across (“translating”) the content of the text from one linguistic realm to another, I have tried to involve the reader in the experience of giving it back (“rendering”), of returning to the source and recreating some of its richness. My task has been to present the raw material of the text as best I can in English, and to point out some of the method that may be fruitfully employed in wrestling with it.<align=0><font12><content>Buber and Rosenzweig translated the Bible out of the deep conviction that language has the power to bridge worlds and to redeem human beings. They both, separately and together, fought to restore the power of ancient words and to speak modern ones with wholeness and genuineness. Despite the barriers in their own lives—Buber’s early disappointments, Rosenzweig’s struggle with German idealism and later with a terrible paralysis that left him unable to speak—they each came to see dialogue as a central fact of interhuman and human-divine relations.	The era in which we live, seventy years after the first appearance of the Buber-Rosenzweig <i>Im Anfang<style> (Genesis), is, however, heir to many decades of a very different experience. Since 1933, but beginning certainly well before, the Western world has experienced the debasement and trivialization of human language, and thus of divine language as well. From Stalin’s and Hitler’s speeches, to Orwell’s visions, to the reality of Vietnam War jargon and on to the babble of television and advertising, words seem to have lost their elemental meaningfulness in a way that the optimistic nineteenth century into which Buber and Rosenzweig were born could not have dared to believe. In this situation, can a translation of ancient books, even though they are from the Bible, have anything to say, or are they merely a “message from a dead man,” to use Kafka’s poignant expression?	Yet Buber and Rosenzweig knew that language lives only in the mouths of speakers, human beings who face each other and who at every moment of conversation and contact literally translate for one another. The reading of the Bible is hopefully a cultural means for reawakening that conversation, for in the struggle to understand and apply these texts, one may come to perceive the importance of real words. A Bible translation should be the occasion for reaffirming the human desire to speak and be heard, for encouraging people to view their lives as a series of statements and responses—conversations, really. In sending the reader back to the text, the Buber-Rosenzweig Bible sought to counter the deadness of contemporary language and contemporary living which were all too apparent at the turn of the century, even before war and genocide began to take their toll. As we approach the end of that century, the same problems remain, altered further by the present revolution in communications. Amid the overcrowded air of cyberspace, the Hebrew Bible may still come to tell us that we do not live by bread alone, and that careful and loving attention to ancient words may help us to form the modern ones that we need.<align=right>Everett Fox<align=right><i>Clark University<align=right>Worcester, Massachusetts<align=right>January 1995<align=right>Shevat 5755<align=0><style>	I have mentioned that this book should be understood as a performance. Nevertheless, at the present time I have made only a few changes, preferring to leave a more substantial revision—and citation of some excellent articles and books that have appeared in the meantime—for the future. At the same time, I wish to acknowledge the helpful suggestions of a number of scholars: Bernard Levinson (in “Recovering the Lost Original Meaning of <i>ve-lo’ tekhasseh ‘alav<style> [<scrip2>Deuteronomy 13:9</scrip>],” <i>Journal of Biblical Literature<style> 115:4, Winter 1996); Judith Romney Wegner (<scrip2>Deut. 6:7</scrip>); Marc Brettler (<scrip2>Gen. 22</scrip>); and Robert Alter, in <i>Genesis: Translation and Commentary<style> (New York: W.

Greenstein of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, who since before the onset of the Schocken project has given me encouragement, used my material in teaching, and been overly generous with his time and expert advice, particularly philological. He has articulated the rationale for this translation in his writings, and has been a solid support and appropriately meticulous critic in many conversations over the years. Beginning with the book of Exodus, he has also served as painstaking chief reader of my manuscript; I have adopted numerous suggestions of his in both the text and the accompanying material. Our discussions on many words (such as <i>nidda<style> in <scrip2>Lev. 12:2</scrip> and <i>yovel<style> in <scrip2>Lev. 25:10</scrip>) proved decisive for me. That said, all responsibility for what appears in these pages is mine alone.	Bonny Fetterman at Schocken Books has supplied endless patience, good cheer, and creative solutions to nasty logistical problems of production. Her counsel and support go back many years, and were crucial in getting me through the long haul. Arthur Samuelson, who originally signed me for this project, has returned to Schocken exactly in time to handle the final product’s entry into the world. I am glad to have his energy and expertise on board.	Professor Steven Hall, as a graduate student at Brandeis University, was of considerable help to me in procuring secondary materials, particularly on Leviticus and Numbers.	Being on sabbatical in 1993–94 in Israel afforded me the opportunity for a final push on the last three books. I wish to thank the staff at Hebrew Union College in Jerusalem for their kindness in providing me with a well-supplied and quiet library in which to work near my home; the Hebrew University Library was of course also quite helpful. I am also grateful to Avivah Zornberg for the opportunity to attend weekly study sessions with her; her mastery of midrashic and medieval material and their profundities helped to stimulate my rather “plain meaning”-oriented brain in ways which may not be apparent in my text but which are there nevertheless. Lastly, I have the sad task of expressing gratitude too late in print to Joy Ungerleider Mayerson, who died in 1994. As head of the Dorot Foundation, she was kind enough to supply me with a grant for the year to finish this work. As a patroness of many important cultural and religious activities and institutions, she will be profoundly missed.	I am deeply grateful to all those who over the years have written me or communicated verbally about their experiences using my texts in various settings. This concentrated use of the material—whether in college classes on the humanities, religious schools, synagogue or church services, or private or family study groups—has been a prime influence on my desire and ability to forge ahead with this work.	Several colleagues deserve mention here for stimulating my thinking and for sharing in the spirit of the project. I should like to thank Professor Lawrence Rosenwald for the wonderful experience of collaborating on the translation and presentation of <i>Scripture and Translation,<style> Buber and Rosenzweig’s collected essays on the Bible and its rendering into German. I am also grateful to Professors Susan Handelman and Lewis Glinert for their insights over the past year, and to Drs. F. J. Hoogewoud and Martin Kessler for introducing me to the work of Dutch scholars, kindred spirits in their approach to the biblical text.	Two scholars were particularly gracious as this project came to a close: Professor Marc Brettler, who shared with me the galleys of his fine study, <i>The Creation of History in Ancient Israel<style>, and suggested various materials relating to the book of Deuteronomy; and Professor Jeffrey Tigay, who permitted me to see a draft version of his major new commentary on Deuteronomy (to appear as the final volume of the <i>JPS Torah Commentary <style> series). In connection with the latter, I wish also to thank Dr. Ellen Frankel of the Jewish Publication Society for her quick and helpful response.	I continue to benefit greatly from my colleagues in the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures at Clark University; their warmth and collegiality around issues of language, identity, and culture are a source of nourishment to me. I wish also to thank the university administration for faculty development funds that they provided me early in the process of translating the final three books.	I am grateful to many friends who over the years have followed my work with interest and encouragement. Chief among these is William Novak, whose meaningful support and advice have stretched from 1971 to the present.	I would like to thank my children, Akiva, Leora, and Ezra, who have had to put up with a father whose brain may often have seemed to be in another millennium. Most of all, I would like to acknowledge the help of my wife, Cherie Koller-Fox, who has seen this project through since 1971, and has had to live with my none-too-easy journey through this work. Our conversations on the text and categories of Leviticus in particular have helped immeasurably to clarify my thinking on biblical issues. <i>Now He Called<style> is for her, with love. Most recent thanks go to Rabbi Israel C. Stein, who has alerted me to citation mistakes in the notes and a number of other errors. I am deeply grateful to him for his close reading, and for the opportunity to make needed corrections.	Finally, praise to the One who has helped me survive, and sustained me, and brought me to this moment.<h0><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b>On the Name of God and Its Translation<style><align=0><font12><content><p.small>The reader will immediately notice that the personal name of the biblical God</p.small> appears in this volume as “<p.small>Yhwh</p.small>.” That is pretty standard scholarly practice, but it does not indicate how the name should be pronounced. I would recommend the use of traditional “the Lord” in reading aloud, but others may wish to follow their own custom. While the visual effect of “<p.small>Yhwh</p.small>” may be jarring at first, it has the merit of approximating the situation of the Hebrew text as we now have it, and of leaving open the unsolved question of the pronunciation and meaning of God’s name. Some explanation is in order.	The name of God has undergone numerous changes in both its writing and translation throughout the history of the Bible. At an early period the correct pronunciation of the name was either lost or deliberately avoided out of a sense of religious awe. Jewish tradition came to vocalize and pronounce the name as “Adonai,” that is, “the/my Lord,” a usage that has remained in practice since late antiquity. Another euphemism, regularly used among Orthodox Jews today, is “Ha-Shem,” literally, “The Name.”	Historically, Jewish and Christian translations of the Bible into English have tended to use “Lord,” with some exceptions (notably, Moffatt’s “The Eternal”). Both old and new attempts to recover the “correct” pronunciation of the Hebrew name have not succeeded; neither the sometimes-heard “Jehovah” nor the standard scholarly “Yahweh” can be conclusively proven.	For their part, Buber and Rosenzweig sought to restore some of what they felt was the name’s ancient power; early drafts of their Genesis translation reveal a good deal of experimentation in this regard. They finally settled on a radical solution: representing the name by means of capitalized personal pronouns. The use of You, He, Him, etc., stemmed from their conviction that God’s name is not a proper name in the conventional sense, but rather one which evokes his immediate presence. Buber and Rosenzweig—both of whom wrote a great deal about their interpretation (see Buber and Rosenzweig 1994) based it on their reading of <scrip2>Ex. 3:14</scrip>, a text in which another verbal form of <p.small>Yhwh</p.small> appears, and which they translated as “I will be-there howsoever I will be-there” (i.e., my name is not a magical handle through which I can be conjured up; I am ever-present). For more on this passage, and the name, see the Commentary and Notes in the text below.	The B-R rendering has its attractiveness in reading aloud, as is demonstrated by recordings of Buber reading his text, but it is on doubtful grounds etymologically. It also introduces an overly male emphasis through its constant use of “He,” an emphasis which is not quite so pronounced in the Hebrew. For these reasons, and out of a desire to reflect the experience of the Hebrew reader, I have followed the practice of transcribing the name as <p.small>Yhwh</p.small>.	Readers who are uncomfortable with the maleness of God in these texts may wish to substitute “God” for “he” in appropriate passages. While, as a translator, I am committed to reproducing the text as faithfully as I can, it is also true that the ancient Hebrews viewed God as a divinity beyond sexuality, and modern readers as well may see fit to acknowledge this.<h0><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b>Guide to the Pronunciation of Hebrew Names<align=0><font12><content><style>The precise pronunciation of biblical Hebrew cannot be determined with certainty.

For this reason, I also do not distinguish here between the Hebrew letters <i>alef<style> and <i>ayin<style> in transcription, even though technically their pronunciations differ. I have, however, added an apostrophe when the lack of one might lead the reader to mispronounce the word (e.g., Se’ir, Be’er).	Some well-known names in the text have been transcribed in their traditional English spelling. These include Canaan (Heb. <i>Kenaan<style>), Egypt (<i>Mitzrayim<style>), Israel (<i>Yisrael<style>), Jordan (<i>Yarden<style>), Pharaoh (<i>Par’o<style>), and Sinai (<i>Seenai<style>). Otherwise, I have indicated the familiar English forms of the names in the Notes, under the rubric “Trad.

Rather, I have sought to suggest some fruitful avenues for thought and discussion in the Commentary, and to provide such information in the Notes as will be helpful to the nonspecialist. Naturally, the selection of material for these purposes is entirely mine; others might single out different details and different aspects of the text.	Since I have espoused a “rhetorical” approach to biblical texts in my work, I have decided to limit myself largely to literary remarks in the Commentary: indicating themes and motifs as they appear and are developed in these books and elsewhere in the Bible; pointing out structural aspects of the text; and treating issues of character development in the narrative. I have by and large eschewed historical issues, and those pertaining to the origins and textual history of Genesis and Exodus. These matters, which are highly theoretical and subject to detailed and often heated scholarly discussion, are treated comprehensively in standard works such as Speiser (1964) for Genesis and Childs (1974) for Exodus (see also the volumes of the Jewish Publication Society’s <i>The Torah Commentary,<style> currently appearing). More detailed information on the ancient Near Eastern background and parallels to Genesis and Exodus can be found in Cassuto (1967, 1972/1974) and Sarna (1966, 1986). Readers whose interest is primarily archaeological will seek works such as Mazar (1990).<p=art><align=1><content><font64><lang=heb>bravyt<h0><align=1><title><font24><lang=en><b>Genesis<br><br><br>At the Beginning<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b_caps>On the Book of Genesis and Its Structure<style><align=0><font12><content><p.small>The text of Genesis seems to speak with many voices. For a book whose basic </p.small>arrangement is chronological, tracing the history of a single family, it exhibits a good deal of discontinuity on the surface. Here time flows uniformly, there it takes startling jumps; fragments are followed by more or less full-blown tales; genres alternate, from mythic to genealogical to folkloristic. In addition, scholars often portray Genesis as a collection of historically diverse materials that were compiled by scribes for whom deviating from received tradition was anathema. Hence the repetitions, the inconsistencies, and the irregular pacing.	Is Genesis then, at best, a collection of stories related to the origins of Israel, with most of its seams still showing? Such an assessment does not do justice to what must have been a complex process of addition and growth or to the final product. An overview of the book does produce a certain scheme; at some point in the text’s history a coherent picture must have begun to emerge from the disparate materials handed down. For the modern reader, utilizing the Buber-Rosenzweig method of focusing on repeating words and key themes as the text presents them may make it possible to generalize about the organization of the book and also to speculate on its overall intent in the form in which it has come down to us.	On its most obvious level Genesis is a book about origins. It seeks to link the origin of the people of Israel with that of the world, relating in the process how various human characteristics and institutions arose.	On the surface this parallels much of ancient literature and folklore. All peoples are interested in their own beginnings, picturing them in a way which validates their present existence. Genesis, however, is different in that, like the rest of the Torah, it downplays the heroic element of the people’s origins and in its place stresses God’s role in them. Moreover the one great omission—the origin of God—establishes from the beginning a unique basis for a tribal chronicle. From Genesis and subsequent books we learn primarily about God’s relationship to the people and what he expects of them; almost everything else is subordinated to this purpose.	Preliminarily one can speak of at least seven major themes whose recurrence establishes their importance in the book:<align=40>	1. <i>Origins:<style> Of the world, of humanity, and of the people of Israel.<align=40>	2. <i>Order/Meaning in History:<style> By means of stylized or patterned chronology—reliance on certain round numbers such as 3, 7, and 40—it is suggested that human events are not random but somehow planned.<align=40>	3. <i>Blessing:<style> From creation onward God bestows blessings on his creatures in general and on the fathers and mothers of Israel in particular.<align=40>	4. <i>Covenant:<style> God concludes agreements with human beings.<align=40>	5. <i>God Punishes Evildoing:<style> God is provoked to anger not by his capriciousness but by human failure to uphold justice and morality.<align=40>	6. <i>Sibling Conflict, with the Younger Usually Emerging the Victor:<style> The order of nature (primacy of the firstborn) is overturned, demonstrating that God, not nature, is the ruling principle in human affairs.<align=40>	7. <i>Testing:<style> God tests those who are to carry forth his mission; the result is the development of moral character.<align=0><font12><content>	Superseding these important themes, which occur throughout the Bible in various forms, is the dominant one of <i>continuity,<style> represented by the unifying word in Genesis <i>toledot<style> (“begettings”). The word appears eleven times, often accompanied by long genealogical lists. The names may deflect attention from what is central to Genesis. The major thrust of the book would seem to be toward human fecundity, following the early divine command to “bear fruit and be many” (<scrip>(Genesis)1:28</scrip>), and pointing toward the eventual fecundity of the people of Israel (which will only be realized in the book of Exodus). Such an emphasis seems appropriate in a book about origins.	Ironically, however, the undercurrent in Genesis points not to life and its continuation, but rather to its threatened extinction. In story after story the protagonist, his people, and occasionally the entire world are threatened. In at least one case (Avraham) a perfectly legal and natural solution is found—the birth of Yishmael as his heir—only to be rejected by God in favor of a more difficult one: a son born to an elderly woman.	It is clear that the stress on continuity and discontinuity has one purpose: to make clear that God is in control of history. Human fertility and continuity in history come not from magical rites or from the arbitrary decisions of the gods, but from a God who bases his rule on justice. Nature disappears as a ruling factor in human affairs, replaced by a principle of morality which is unshakable precisely because it comes from a God who is beyond the rules of nature.	But the result is a book which abounds in tension. From the beginnings of human history (Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)4</scrip>) we encounter contradictions and opposites, whether on a small scale (fertility and barrenness) or a large one (promise and delayed fulfillment). Nowhere is this so clear as in the dramatic high point of the book, Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)22</scrip>. As Avraham stands with knife upraised, the entire enterprise of Genesis hangs in the balance. But the entire book is replete with such tensions and continuity-threatening situations. There are barren wives, brothers vowing to kill brothers, cities and even a world being destroyed by an angry God. The main characters of Genesis thus emerge as survivors, above all else. Noah sets the pattern, but he is merely the first, and too passive an example. The Patriarchs must brave hostile foreigners, bitter intrafamily struggles, and long wanderings before they can find peace.	While by the end of the book many of the tensions have been resolved, one conspicuously has not: God’s promise of the land of Canaan. As the book ends, “in Egypt,” we are left to ponder how this God, who keeps his promises to “those who love him” (<scrip2>Ex. 20:6</scrip>), will bring the people back to their land—a land inhabited by someone else and in which the Children of Israel own only a burial site. Yet despite the tension, we may assume from the experiences of the Patriarchs that God will indeed “take account of” the Israelites (<scrip>(Genesis)50:24</scrip>), that he will take whatever ill has been planned against them and “plan-it-over for good” (<scrip>(Genesis)50:20</scrip>).	A word should also be said here about hero traditions. In the great epics of the ancient world the hero often stands as a lonely figure. He must overcome obstacles, fight monsters, acquire helpers (whether women, “sidekicks,” or magic objects); and his triumph in the end signals man’s triumph over his archenemy, Death. Every battle won, every obstacle hurdled, is psychologically a victory for us, the audience, a cathartic release from our own frustrating battle against death.	The Bible sees things rather differently. Death is also overcome, but not only by the individual’s struggle. It is rather through the covenant community, bound together by God’s laws and his promises, that the heroic vision is lived out. Despite the triumphs of the characters in Genesis, it is really in the book of Exodus that the great battle scenes (the plagues in Egypt, the Red Sea) and meetings with the divine (Mount Sinai) take place. And it is therefore God himself who is most properly the “hero” of these stories. No major character in Genesis achieves success without depending fully on God, and the standards that are held up to them are ultimately seen as God’s own, to be imitated by imperfect humankind.	The book of Genesis falls naturally into four large sections. The first, usually termed the “Primeval History” (Chaps. <scrip>(Genesis)1–11</scrip>), begins with creation and progresses through the early generations of humanity, ending in Mesopotamia. The second (Chaps. <scrip>(Genesis)12</scrip> through <scrip>(Genesis)25:18</scrip>) is the cycle of stories concerning Avraham, the father of the people of Israel. Part III (<scrip2>Gen. 25:19</scrip> through Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)36</scrip>) deals in the main with stories about his grandson Yaakov. The final section (Chaps. <scrip>(Genesis)37–50</scrip>) is the tale of Yosef and of how the Children of Israel came to live in Egypt (thus paving the way for the book of Exodus).	The following skeletal outline will lay out some of the interesting structural features of the book. There is an elemental symmetry that emerges from the four sections; further comments, especially about how the sections cohere, will be found in the explanatory material accompanying the text in this volume.<align=30>	I.

Yet the patterning observed above gives the book a general coherence, above and beyond differences. It also demonstrates a conscious hand at work, one concerned about the texture of the book as a whole and able, despite the possible rigidity of what had been handed down, to shape the received material into a plastic and breathing unity.	Two general observations about Genesis will round out the picture here. First, as the book progresses there is a tendency for the style of the literature to become smoother. The abrupt changes and sometimes fragmentary nature of the material in Part I, and the vignettes built around Avraham’s life in Part II, give way to a greater coherence and concentration in Part III, and finally to a relatively flowing and psychologically complete narrative in Part IV. Along with this, the characters in the latter half of the book seem to be more changeable and human, in contrast to Noah and Avraham, who often appear almost perfect models of piety.	Second, contact with God becomes less and less direct as Genesis moves on. Avraham’s dreams and visions seem a far cry from Adam’s conversations with God in the garden (although see Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)18</scrip>); Yaakov’s encounters with God are less frequent than Avraham’s; and finally, Yosef never has a conversation with God, although he receives dream interpretations from him. This process of distancing may reflect an often-observed tendency in religions to think of primeval times as a “golden age” of closeness between gods and men, as contrasted to today (whenever one is writing), when humankind finds itself tragically distant from the divine and in need of communication.<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b_caps>PART I<br><br>The Primeval History<br><br>(<scrip1>(Genesis)1–11<content>)<style><align=0><font12><content><p.small>The collection of stories which forms part i of Genesis has been assembled </p.small>for a number of purposes:	1. History is traced from the creation of the world, in a direct line, down to Avraham, father of the People of Israel. Through use of the leading-word <i>toledot,<style> “begettings,” we are meant to view him as the logical end point in God’s preliminary plan in history.	2. The nature of God, as he will appear throughout the Hebrew Bible, is firmly established. He is seen as a Creator who is beyond fate, nature, and sexuality; as an all-powerful orderer and giver of meaning to history; as a bestower of blessing to living creatures; as a giver of choice to human beings; as a just punisher of evil and, simultaneously, a merciful ruler; and as a maker of covenants. The one quality of God which does not unfold until the Patriarchal stories (Parts II-IV) is his shaping of human destiny through focusing on the People of Israel. It is portrayed as the logical outcome of the characteristics just mentioned.	3. It appears that the Mesopotamian origins of Israel are reflected in such narratives as the Creation, the Flood, and the Tower of Babel, and are transformed or repudiated in the biblical versions. What in the older culture appears arbitrary and chaotic has been changed in the Bible into stories that stress morality and order. Further, human beings in Genesis Chapters 1–11, despite their failure to live up to God’s expectations, are nevertheless considered capable of doing so, in contrast to the Mesopotamian view that humankind was created merely to be slaves to the gods.	4. Like virtually all other creation stories, Part I is concerned with the origin of the world and its institutions. Chapter 1 expounds on the origins of earth, sky, vegetation, animals, and human beings (as well as the Sabbath); Chapter 2, of sexuality, death, pain in childbirth, and work; Chapter 4, of sin, hatred, and murder, as well as of cities and crafts; Chapter 6, of giants; and Chapter 10, of nations (including the low status of the Canaanites) and languages.	In sum, Part I serves as a fitting Prologue, not only to Genesis but to the entire Bible. The reader’s chief task in interpreting it is to be able to determine the reason for the inclusion of any one section into the whole.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>God as Creator<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)1:1–2:4</scrip>a): Three principal themes emerge from the great creation account with which Genesis opens. The first is the total and uncompromised power of God as creator; the second, the intrinsic order and balance of the created world; and the third, humankind’s key position in the scheme of creation. These themes are brought home as much by the form in which they are presented as by their actual mention.	God (Heb. <i>elohim,<style> a generic term) is introduced into the narrative without any description of origins, sex, or limitations of power. As the only functioning character of the chapter, he occupies center stage. There is no opposition, no resistance to his acts of creation, which occur in perfect harmony with his express word.	As a sign of both God’s total control and his intent, the world unfolds in symmetrical order. The division of God’s labor into six days, plus a seventh for rest, itself indicates a powerful meaningfulness at work, as well as providing the external structure for the narrative. Interpreters have tended to divide these into either three groups of two days or two groups of three, with always the same results: a balanced and harmonious whole. In addition, the number seven is significant (as it will be elsewhere in the Bible) as a symbol of perfection, not only in Israel but in the ancient world in general.	The narrative uses several repeating words and phrases to both unify the story and underscore the theme of order. These include “God said,” “Let there be. . . ,” “God saw that it was good,” “It was so,” and “There was setting, there was dawning. . . .”	The text is so formed as to highlight the creation of humankind. Although in each previous day “God said” is the keynote, suggesting forethought as well as action, here (v.26) God fully spells out his intentions, as it were, thinking out loud. Humanity, created in the divine “image,” is to hold sway over the rest of creation. Only with the addition of humankind is God able to survey his newly formed world and to pronounce it “exceedingly good” (v.31).	At least two motifs appear in this chapter which will become important later in Genesis. The three occurrences of “blessing” (<scrip>(Genesis)1:22</scrip>, <scrip2>1:28</scrip>, <scrip2>2:3</scrip>) point to a central idea in the Patriarchal stories. In addition the concept of order and its logical conclusion—that history makes sense—figures prominently in the familial histories of the book. This is accomplished largely by the meaningful use of numbers, as above.	The entire account concludes (<scrip>(Genesis)2:1–3</scrip>) with a tightly structured poem. “God,” “the seventh day,” “work,” and “made” are mentioned three times, “finished,” “ceased,” and “all” twice; and “created” returns, echoing <scrip>(Genesis)1:1</scrip>, to round out the whole creation narrative.	The postscript (<scrip>(Genesis)2:4</scrip>a; some scholars align it with what follows in Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)2</scrip> instead) introduces the key structural phrase of Genesis, “These are the begettings. . . .” It may also indicate the polemical intent of the creation story. Rosenzweig understood the verse to contrast “begetting,” i.e., sexual creation as it occurs in non-Israelite myths, with the “true” creation.	In that vein, a final word needs to be said about extrabiblical evidence. As has often been pointed out, Gen. I is unmistakably reacting against prevailing Near Eastern cosmogonies of the time. Most of the cultures surrounding ancient Israel had elaborate creation stories, highlighting the birth, sexuality, and violent uprisings of the gods. As we indicated at the outset, the concept of God presented here militates against such ideas, arguing chiefly out of omission and silence. (It should also be noted that in poetic books such as Isaiah, Job, and Psalms, a tradition about violent conflict at creation has been preserved.) The Genesis narrative has taken such old mythological motifs as battles with the primeval (female) waters or with sea monsters and eliminated or neutralized them. What remains is both utterly simple and radical in its time.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Garden and Expulsion<content><style> (<scrip3>(Genesis 2:4-3:24)2:4b-3:24</scrip>): From the perspective of God in Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)1</scrip>, we now switch to that of humankind (note how the opening phrase in <scrip>(Genesis)2:4</scrip>b, “earth and heaven,” reverses the order found in <scrip>(Genesis)1:1</scrip>). This most famous of all Genesis stories contains an assortment of mythic elements and images which are common to human views of prehistory: the lush garden, four central rivers located (at least partially) in fabled lands, the mysterious trees anchoring the garden (and the world?), a primeval man and woman living in unashamed nakedness, an animal that talks, and a God who converses regularly and intimately with his creatures. The narrative presents itself, at least on the surface, as a story of origins. We are to learn the roots of human sexual feelings, of pain in childbirth, and how the anomalous snake (a land creature with no legs) came to assume its present form. Most strikingly, of course, the story seeks to explain the origin of the event most central to human consciousness: death.	The narrative unfolds through a series of contrasts: good and evil, life and death, heaven and earth, give and take, knowledge and ignorance, humans and animals, hiding and revealing. Some of these concepts appear literally as key words in the text. The characters also appear through contrasts: man as God’s image and as dust, woman as helper and hinderer, the snake as shrewd and (after the curse) lowly.	A further focus is provided by the echoing of the word “eat,” whose connotation changes from sustenance/bounty (<scrip>(Genesis)2:9</scrip>, <scrip2>16</scrip>) to prohibition (<scrip>(Genesis)2:17</scrip>) to misunderstanding (<scrip>(Genesis)3:1–5</scrip>) and disobedience (<scrip>(Genesis)3:6</scrip>, <scrip2>11–13</scrip>), and finally to curse (<scrip>(Genesis)3:14</scrip>, <scrip2>17</scrip>, <scrip2>19</scrip>). Such a flexible use of words sets up a rhythmic drama which, as much of Genesis, bears resemblance to poetry rather than to prose.	Part I of the story (Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)2</scrip>) sets the stage in the garden, focusing on <i>Adam,<style> “Everyman” (see <i>Cambridge Bible Commentary,<style> Gen. I–II). God is here regularly called “<p.small>Yhwh</p.small>, God,” a rare designation which may suggest a preexpulsion view of the wholeness of God as well as of humankind. Man continues his status as “God’s image” (<scrip>(Genesis)1:26–27</scrip>), imitating the divine act of giving names (<scrip>(Genesis)1:5</scrip>, <scrip2>8</scrip>, <scrip2>10</scrip>). He is also nevertheless a creature of the dust, both at the beginning (<scrip>(Genesis)2:7</scrip>) and end (<scrip>(Genesis)3:19</scrip>) of the story.	The bridge to Part II (Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)3</scrip>) is deftly accomplished by linking two identical-sounding words in the Hebrew, <i>arum<style> (here, “nude” and “shrewd”). The choice of the snake as the third character is typically ancient Near Eastern (it is so used in other stories about death and immortality, such as the <i>Gilgamesh Epic<style> from Mesopotamia). Some interpreters have seen sexual overtones in this choice as well. Yet a plain reading of the text need not overemphasize the snake, who disappears as a personality once the fatal fruit has been eaten.	The ending of the story has also raised questions of interpretation. Buber was among those who see in the act of expulsion from the garden a deed of mercy rather than one of fear or jealousy. Certainly a creature whose first act upon acquiring new “knowledge” is to cover himself up poses no threat to the Creator. The text, like its late successor, the book of Job, may be suggesting that in the human sphere, unlike the divine, knowledge and mortality are inextricably linked. This is a tragic realization, but it is also the world as human beings know it.	Although the specifics of this story are never again referred to in the Hebrew Bible, and are certainly not crucial for the rest of Genesis, one general theme <i>is <style>central to the Bible’s worldview. This is that rebellion against or disobedience toward God and his laws results in banishment/estrangement and, literally or figuratively, death. Thus from the beginning the element of <i>choice,<style> so much stressed by the Prophets later on, is seen as the major element in human existence.	All this said, it should be recognized that the garden story, like many biblical texts, has been the subject of endless interpretation. One line of thought takes the psychological point of view. The story resembles a vision of childhood and of the transition to the contradictions and pain of adolescence and adulthood. In every way—moral, sexual, and intellectual—Adam and Havva are like children, and their actions after partaking of the fruit seem like the actions of those who are unable to cope with newfound powers. The resolution of the story, banishment from the garden, suggests the tragic realization that human beings must make their way through the world with the knowledge of death and with great physical difficulty. At the same time the archetypal man and woman do not make the journey alone. They are provided with protection (clothing), given to them by the same God who punished them for their disobedience. We thus symbolically enter adulthood with the realization that being turned out of Paradise does not mean eternal rejection or hopelessness.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The First Brothers<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)4:1–16</scrip>): With the story of Kayin and Hevel the narrative points both forward and backward. For the first time the major Genesis themes of struggle and sibling hatred, and discontinuity between the generations, make their appearance. In addition the concept of <i>sin<style> is introduced (Rosenzweig), having not appeared by name previously.	One may observe significant links to the garden story. Once again human beings are given a choice; once again disregarding the warning leads to death and estrangement from God; and once again the primal bond between humanity and the soil is ruptured. Chapter 3 is directly recalled by the use of specific wording: God echoes the curse he had put on the woman (<scrip>(Genesis)3:16</scrip>) in his warning to Kayin (<scrip>(Genesis)4:7</scrip>), and “Where is Hevel your brother?” (<scrip>(Genesis)4:9</scrip>) brings to mind “Where are you?” (<scrip>(Genesis)3:9</scrip>), which had been addressed to Kayin’s father.	The text is punctuated by the use of “brother,” a meaningful seven times, as well as by changing connotations of the word “face” (Kayin, unable to bring about a lifting of his own face, becomes estranged from God’s). Repetition also helps to convey the harshness of Kayin’s punishment: he is exiled to the “land of Nod/Wandering” (v.16), for which we have been prepared by the “wavering and wandering” of verses 12 and 14.	Although this story may well have originated as a tale of enmity between two ways of life (farmer and shepherd), or in another context, it has obviously been transformed into something far more disturbing and universal.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Line of Kayin<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)4:17–26</scrip>): From whole stories the text turns to several brief accounts, some of which are clearly fragments. The first of these deals with origins: of cities, of certain crafts, and of worship. The former two are associated (perhaps negatively) with Kayin’s line. The only personality in these texts about whom we learn anything is Lemekh—and his “saying” (vv.23–24) seems hopelessly obscure. Some interpreters have understood it as a challenge to God, and thus believe that it has been included here as an example of the wickedness typical of the generations that preceded the Flood.	The names of Adam and Havva’s son and grandson (vv.25–26) are sad reminders of Hevel’s death—a personal touch in an otherwise prosaic section of narrative.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>From Adam to Noah<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)5</scrip>): The extraordinary numbers in this section are significant, not so much for their length as for their message. Cassuto has tried to fit them into a defined scheme, showing that the purpose, and achieved effect, of our text is to convey that human history follows a meaningful pattern. Pride of place on the list is occupied by the seventh member, Hanokh, who is portrayed as the first man of God. He serves as a preparation for Noah, who also “walks in accord with God” (<scrip>(Genesis)6:9</scrip>). Hanokh’s life span, 365 years, exemplifies the number scheme of Genesis: as an expression of numerical perfection (the number of days in a year), it symbolizes moral perfection.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Antiquity and the Preparation for the Flood<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)6:1–8</scrip>): The final pre-Flood section of the text includes a theme common to other ancient tales: the biological mixing of gods and men in dim antiquity. Perhaps this fragment, which initially seems difficult to reconcile with biblical ideas about God, has been retained here to round out a picture familiar to ancient readers, and to recall the early closeness of the divine and the human which, according to many cultures, later dissolved. It is also possible that the episode serves as another example of a world that has become disordered, thus providing further justification for a divinely ordered destruction.	The stage is set for the Flood by means of a powerful sound reference. In <scrip>(Genesis)5:29</scrip> Noah was named, ostensibly to comfort his elders’ “sorrow” over human “pains” in tilling the soil. Here (<scrip>(Genesis)6:6</scrip>), however, the meaning of the name has been ironically reversed. The one who was supposed to bring comfort only heralds God’s own being “sorry” and “pained” (vv. 6–7). A similar ironic wordplay, where the audience knows what the name-bestower does not, occurs in <scrip2>Ex. 2:3</scrip>; curiously, the hero of that passage, the baby Moses, is also connected with an “ark”—the term for the little basket in which he is set adrift.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Deluge<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)6:9–8:19</scrip>): The biblical account of the Flood is replete with echoes and allusions which point to three clear motifs: God’s justice, the totality of punishment, and a new beginning patterned after Gen. I.	The first of these is brought out in <scrip>(Genesis)6:11–13</scrip>: the repetition of the word “ruin” indicates not only the sorry state of society but also the principle of just retaliation, for God is to “bring ruin” upon the earth (v.13).	The totality of the disaster is conveyed by the repeated use of the word “all” in <scrip>(Genesis)7:21–23</scrip>, as well as by the completeness of the list of those destroyed (<scrip>(Genesis)7:21–23</scrip>). Humans, as befits their place in the order of creation, appear last, but actually it is they who drag virtually all of creation down with them. This reflects a deeply held biblical idea that human action directly affects the orderly and otherwise neutral functioning of nature.	There are striking parallels between the Flood narrative and the creation account of Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)1</scrip>. Just as the animals were created, each “according to its kind,” their rescue, both in boarding and leaving the Ark, is similarly worded. “Ocean” and the great “rushing-wind” which existed at creation (<scrip>(Genesis)1:2</scrip>) return here, the former to signify a lapse into chaos and the latter, the restoration of order and peace (<scrip>(Genesis)7:11</scrip>, <scrip2>8:1</scrip>). Finally, after the Flood (<scrip>(Genesis)9:1–3</scrip>) Noah is blessed in wording that recalls Adam’s blessing in 1:28–30. The world thus begins anew, with the implication of some hope for the future.	Repetition emphasizes other aspects of the story’s message. In general the word-stem “live” occurs constantly throughout the text, highlighting the rescue and renewal of life as well as its destruction. Noah’s obedience, another major theme, is indicated by variations on the phrase “according to all that God commanded him, so he did” (<scrip>(Genesis)6:22</scrip>). Of rhythmical, almost ritual-sounding import is the phrase “you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives.”	Our story has often been compared, with much justification, to the several Mesopotamian Flood accounts (e.g., in the <i>Gilgamesh<style> and <i>Atrahasis<style> epics), with which it shares a great deal of detail. At one time scholars were quick to concentrate on the parallels, but the differences are now recognized as being much more significant. In general one may say that in contrast to the earlier (Mesopotamian) versions the biblical one is unambiguous in both tone and intent. It has been placed in Genesis to exemplify a God who judges the world according to human behavior, punishes evil and rescues the righteous. This is a far cry from the earlier accounts, where the gods plan the destruction of the world for reasons that are unclear (or in one version, because humankind’s noise is disturbing the sleep of the gods), and where the protagonist, Utnapishtim, is saved as the result of a god’s favoritism without any moral judgments being passed.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Aftermath<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)8:20–9:19</scrip>): The passages immediately following the Flood narrative speak of a God who is remarkably receptive to a human kind of change. From having been “sorry” that he created humankind (<scrip>(Genesis)6:6</scrip>), he now evinces a change of heart about the entire issue of evil, conceding human imperfections (<scrip>(Genesis)8:21</scrip>). In a wonderfully structured declaration, where “never again” moves in position from the middle to the beginning of the phrase (<scrip>(Genesis)8:21–22</scrip>), God as it were chooses to restrain his own ability to radically disturb the processes of nature. Where later on in Genesis the human characters exhibit the capacity to change, here it is God himself.	The blessing in <scrip>(Genesis)9:1–3</scrip> establishes Noah as a kind of second Adam (and it might be noted that chronologically Noah is the first man born after Adam dies). It repeats the basic formulation of the blessing in <scrip>(Genesis)1:28–30</scrip>, with an important exception: meat-eating is now to be allowed, as part of God’s concession to human nature. Previously only the plant world had been accessible to humankind for food. However—and this very word punctuates the text twice in <scrip>(Genesis)9:4–5</scrip>—there is to be an accounting for willful bloodshed, as if to suggest that the eating of meat is being permitted only under strict conditions. To underscore the importance of this concept, the section about bloodshed uses the vocabulary of creation: human beings are made “in the image of God.”	With vv.8 and 9 the key concept of “covenant” is established in fact for the first time in the Bible. It is accompanied, as is usual in the Bible, by a symbol or “sign” (in this case, the rainbow). We are led back to the creation story again, as other biblical texts speak of the Sabbath as a “sign of the covenant” between God and Israel (e.g., <scrip2>Ex. 31:12–17</scrip>).	The sixfold repetition of the phrase “never again” provides a thematic unity in these passages.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Drunkenness and Nakedness<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)9:20–29</scrip>): From the lofty poetry of God’s blessings and promises, we encounter an all-too-brief description of a bizarre event. The soil, which evidently has not entirely shaken off its primeval curse, proves once again to be a source of trouble. The nature of the crime mentioned here (“seeing the father’s nakedness”) has been variously interpreted; Buber and others see in it a reference to the sexual “immorality” of the Canaanites, which the Israelites found particularly abhorrent. This would explain the emphasis on the <i>son<style> of the culprit in the story, rather than on the perpetrator.	A similar undistinguished ancestry is traced in Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)19</scrip>, referring to the incestuous origins of Israel’s neighbors and frequent enemies, the Moabites and Ammonites.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Table of the Nations<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)10</scrip>): Genesis, with its typically ancient Near Eastern emphasis on “begettings,” now traces the development of humanity from the sons of Noah. The key formula throughout is “their lands, their nations.” Commentators have noted numerical unity in the list, citing a total of seventy nations (once repetitions are omitted) laid out in multiples of seven. That number, as we have indicated, represents the concept of totality and perfection in the Bible. Thus the stage is set for the Babel story of the next chapter, with its condemnation of humanity’s attempt to forestall the divinely willed “scattering” into a well-ordered world.	Many of the names in this chapter have been identified (see Speiser), but some are still not known with certainty. Israel is conspicuous in its absence; despite the biblical narrative’s ability to trace Israel’s origins, those origins are meant to be seen not solely in biological terms but rather in terms of God’s choice. Similarly, Israel arises from women who begin as barren—thus pointing to divine intervention in history, rather than the perfectly normal account that we have here.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Unfinished Citadel<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)11:1–9</scrip>): At its most obvious, in an isolated context, this famous story is about the overweening pride of man, as represented by his technology. God’s actions here recall the ending of the garden story, where humanity was also within reach of the divine.	Yet more is involved than a threat. Buber felt that this episode has been inserted at this point to show that humanity has failed again, as at the time of the Flood. It has not spread out and divided into nations, as in Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)10</scrip>. The failure paves the way for a new divine plan, which is to be realized through one man (Avraham) and his descendants.	Structurally, the story is a tiny literary masterpiece. It utilizes numerous plays on sound which make meaningful and often ironic linkages between sections and ideas in the text. Most significant is how the general message—that God’s response occurs in exactly the same terms as the human challenge (i.e., divine justice)—is transmitted by means of form. Fokkelman has provided a detailed study; it will suffice here to indicate only the outline. The divine “Come-now!” of v.7 clearly stands as an answer to humankind’s identical cry in vv.3 and 4. In addition humans, who congregated in order to establish a “name” and to avoid being “scattered over the face of all the earth” (v.4), are contravened by the action of God, resulting in the ironic name “Babble” and a subsequent “scattering” of humanity (v.9). The text is thus another brilliant example of biblical justice, a statement about a worldview in which the laws of justice and morality are as neatly balanced as we like to think the laws of nature are.	There is an important cultural background to the story. “Shinar” refers to Mesopotamia, and the “tower,” undoubtedly, to the ubiquitous <i>ziggurratu<style> (now unearthed by archeologists) which served as man-made sacred mountains (i.e., temples). By portraying an unfinished tower, by dispersing the builders, and by in essence making fun of the mighty name of Babylon, the text functions effectively to repudiate the culture from which the people of Israel sprang (Avram’s “Ur” of <scrip>(Genesis)11:28</scrip> was probably the great Mesopotamian metropolis). From Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)12</scrip> on, a new worldview is created.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Noah to Avram<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)11:10–32</scrip>): Here are enumerated another ten generations, making the orderly connection between the origins of the world (Noah was viewed as a second Adam) and the origins of the people of Israel. The life spans are considerably shorter than those of Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)5</scrip>, yet some sort of careful number scheme seems evident here as well (see Cassuto 1972).	Beginning with v.26 we are introduced to Avram, with little hint of what is to come in his momentous life. For the moment he is only a son, a brother, and a husband, and a man whose early life is marked principally by the death of the old world (Haran and Terah), with little hope for the new (his wife is barren).<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b>Notes<content><style><h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>1:1<exerpt><b>	At the beginning…<content><style>:This phrase, which has long been the focus of debate among grammarians, is traditionally read: “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” B-R agrees, I have followed several medieval commentators, and most moderns, in my rendition. <exerpt><b>creating<content><style>: Indicative of God’s power and not used in reference to humans, although later in the chapter such words as “make” and “form” do appear. <exerpt><b>the heavens and the earth: <content><style>Probably a merism—an inclusive idiom meaning “everything” or “everywhere”—such as in Hamlet’s “There are more things in heaven and earth.…”<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>2<exerpt><b>	when the earth<b> <content><style>. . . : <scrip2>Gen. 1</scrip> describes God’s bringing order out of chaos, not creation from nothingness. <exerpt><b>Confusion and Chaos:<content><style> Heb. <i>tohu va-vohu.<style> <exerpt><b>Ocean:<content><style> The primeval waters, a common (and usually divine) image in ancient Near Eastern mythology. <exerpt><b>rushing-spirit:<content><style> Others, “wind.” The Hebrew word <i>ruah<style> can mean both “spirit” and “wind.” See <scrip2>Ps. 33:6</scrip>. <exerpt><b>hovering:<content><style> Or “flitting.” The image suggested by the word (see <scrip2>Deut. 32:11</scrip>) is that of an eagle protecting its young.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>3–5<exerpt><b>	God said . . .

Life experiences are repeated and common themes recur; yet at the same time there is a remarkable variety of personalities.	Two prominent themes throughout are God’s promises (of land and descendants) and his blessing. The texts revolve around the question of whether and how God will fulfill his promises, and how people will effect the transfer of the blessing. Each generation portrayed in the narratives must deal with the inherent tensions raised by these questions, since their resolution does not occur easily.	The stories are also marked by each figure’s struggle to develop a concept of the religious life, of “walking in accord with God.” Each one carves out his own distinct path, to arrive at a mature understanding of what it means to be a father of the people of Israel. In order to bring about such an understanding, God apparently “tests” them in both obvious and more oblique ways, often against a backdrop of bitter sibling rivalry. One also observes a physical unsettledness about the Patriarchs’ quest; only Yitzhak is spared the wanderings that occur so regularly in the stories.	Rather interestingly, although the texts purport to be about “fathers,” it is God himself who most consistently fits that role for the characters. God acts <i>in loco parentis<style> for each of the Patriarchs, always, significantly, after the loss of the human father. He first appears to Avraham after the death of Terah; to Yitzhak after that of Avraham; to Yaakov after he leaves home (and a seemingly dying father); and he helps Yosef directly, after he has left his father’s home.	Numbers play an important role in the Patriarchal stories, as they did in Part I. It has been pointed out (see Sarna 1966 ) that the life spans of the Patriarchs fit into a highly ordered pattern. Avraham lives for 175 years, equaling 7 x 5<sup1>2<style>; Yitzhak, for 180 years, equaling 5 x 6<sup1>2<style>; and Yaakov, for 147 years, or 3 x 7<sup1>2<style>. This is unmistakably a purposeful scheme, meant to convey that human history is orderly and meaningful. Similarly an examination of the stories reveals that Avraham lives for 75 years in the lifetime of his father and 75 years in the lifetime of his son, while Yaakov spends 20 years away from his father, with Yosef roughly following suit in the next generation.	Last, it should be noted that the Patriarchal stories in various details anticipate the later Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt. The specific references will be mentioned in the Notes.<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b_caps>PART II<br><br>Avraham<br><br>(<scrip1>(Genesis)12–25:18<content>)<style><align=0><font12><content><p.small>Although Avraham is the biological father of Israel, the diverse traditions</p.small> about him which have been collected and connected to form a cycle of stories give evidence of much more. The cycle portrays an active <i>Homo religiosis<style> who converses with God, sometimes with an air of doubt and questioning, who proclaims God’s name at various sacred sites, who is concerned about justice and the treatment of the oppressed, and who makes dramatic life decisions without flinching. The stories thus reveal struggle, despite the fact that Avraham often appears to be the “perfect” man, always obeying God’s bidding and prospering.	Buber (1982), noting the unifying effect of the verb “see” throughout the cycle, understood Avraham as the father of the Prophets of Israel (formerly called “seers”). He also viewed the cycle as based around the series of tests that Avraham must undergo, tests quite different, we might add, from the labors of Hercules and other such ancient challenges.	Other than “see,” a number of leading-words launch the major concerns of the Patriarchs: “bless,” “seed,” and “land.” At the same time the cycle contains previously encountered motifs, albeit with interesting refinements: punishment for sin (this time, with human questioning), intimacy with God (here through visions), and sibling rivalry (with more complex results than murder). Above all we note the singling out of one man to perform the will of God, a man very different from the rather passive Noah.	Avraham stands at the core of the entire book of Genesis, as his experiences will in many ways be reflected in those who follow him. At the core of both the book and the cycle looms the disturbing Chapter 22, which brings together and resolves, for the moment, the major themes encountered so far.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Call and the Journey<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)12:1–9</scrip>): The Avraham cycle begins decisively, with a command from God to leave the past behind and go to an unnamed land. Prominent in this speech, clearly, is the concept of blessing, which will be realized by the gifts of land (Canaan) and seed (Yitzhak, the son).	The classic mythological motif of the journey, where the hero meets such dangers as monsters and giants, has here been avoided. All that the text wishes us to know about is God’s speech and Avram’s immediate obedience; as in Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)22</scrip>, all other details of the actual trip have been omitted.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Wife—I<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)12:10–20</scrip>): Almost immediately upon his arrival in the promised land Avram is forced to leave it. It will be his son Yitzhak’s task to remain there on a more permanent basis.	This is the first of three such stories which are practically identical (see Chaps. <scrip>(Genesis)20</scrip> and <scrip2>26</scrip>). All pose a challenge for the interpreter. An honored man of God seeks to save his own skin by passing his wife off as his sister; in each case the Patriarch emerges safely and with increased wealth.	Speiser has tried to use the analogy of Hurrian (i.e., from Harran) law in which a wife can be elevated to the status of “sister” as one element in the expansion of her status. The legal background, however, is unclear and may not be decisive here. Coming as it does after God’s promise to biologically found “a great nation” (v.2) through Avram, the story in its first version is probably best understood as an example of God’s protection not only of the key male figure, but of the Matriarch as well. Harming Sarai, or even the threat of violating her sexuality, brings with it divine punishment. In addition the story also enables Avram to expand his wealth—itself a sign of God’s favor and the Patriarch’s importance or “weightiness” (see Polzin 1975). <h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Lot; The Land<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)13</scrip>): We return to the theme of the land. Not for the last time, Avram’s nephew Lot is used as a foil. Their “parting” shows how Lot makes a bad choice—the “wicked and sinful” area of Sedom and Amora—while Avram settles “in the land of Canaan,” which had been promised to him. From here (vv.14ff.), Avram is given God’s twofold promise again, with that of descendants being spelled out more vividly this time.	This section is linked to the previous one by the repetition of the phrase “he and his wife and all that was his.”<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>War and Rescue<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)14</scrip>): Abruptly Avram is presented in a new light: that of successful warrior (see Muffs). Consistent with his character as we will come to know it, he stands by his kinsman, acts intrepidly, and refuses the spoils of war. Equally important, he is respected by foreigners, a theme that will return both in Genesis and later. Perhaps this very different story has been included here as part of the early sections of the cycle in order to establish Avram’s status and stature. He is no longer merely a wanderer but well on the road to becoming a powerful local figure.	Whether the events described in this chapter are historical or part of an elaborate symbolic or mythical scheme has been the subject of debate among biblical scholars. The issue, barring unexpected archeological finds, is likely to remain unsolved.	The story is constructed around a geographical framework, using the formula “—that is now <i>x<style>—” to identify older sites for a contemporary audience. The one place which is <i>not<style> identified, the “Shalem” of verse 18, may well be Jerusalem. If so, this would substantiate the city’s claim to holiness. Historically it was not conquered until King David’s reign in the tenth century <p.small>b.c.e.</p.small><h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Covenant between the Pieces<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)15</scrip>): Amid scenes of great drama and almost mystery, a number of significant motifs are presented: (1) Avram’s expressions of doubt that God will keep his promise about descendants (thus heightening the tension and final miracle of Yitzhak’s birth); (2) the linking of the Patriarch to the event of the Exodus centuries later; and (3) the “cutting” of a covenant, in a manner well known in the ancient world. This last motif, especially with its setting of “great darkness” and “night-blackness,” takes Avram far beyond the earlier figure of Noah into a special and fateful relationship with God.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Firstborn Son<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)16</scrip>): In the face of Sarai’s inability to bear children, Avram is given the legitimate option of producing an heir through her maid, Hagar. Somewhat embarrassing to later interpreters, this practice was nevertheless common in the ancient Near East (see also <scrip>(Genesis)30:3</scrip>ff., <scrip>(Genesis)30:9</scrip>ff.). Hagar abuses her temporarily exalted position (as her son Yishmael apparently does in a parallel story, in Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)21</scrip>), but is saved by God’s intervention. The motif of “affliction” is continued from Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)15</scrip> (here, in vv. <scrip2>(Gen. 15:6)6</scrip>, <scrip2>9</scrip>, and <scrip2>11</scrip>); also mentioned three times is God’s “hearkening” (hence the name Yishmael/God Hearkens). Buber understood this vocabulary to allude to the Exodus story, which in its early chapters uses the same terms.	Although Yishmael is not ultimately the chosen heir, he is nonetheless protected by God (see <scrip>(Genesis)21:20</scrip>) and is eventually made into “a great nation” (<scrip>(Genesis)17:20</scrip>), as befits a child of Avram.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Covenant of Circumcision<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)17</scrip>): As Plaut notes, up to this point the covenant between God and Avram has been rather one-sided. In this chapter Avram is given a command to perform—not only of circumcision, but to be moral and upright (v.1, expanded in <scrip>(Genesis)18:19</scrip>). Circumcision is but the symbol of the ongoing imperative to do “what is just.”	In many societies circumcision has been connected directly to puberty and marriage, usually taking place (as it does here to Yishmael) at around the age of thirteen. Our passage’s moving back of the rite essentially to birth is a daring reinterpretation, at once defusing the act of exclusively sexual content while at the same time suggesting that the covenant, a lifelong commitment, is nevertheless passed down biologically through the generations. The males of the tribe are not simply made holy for marriage. They bear the mark upon their bodies as a sacred reminder of their mission.	The chapter echoes with repetition: “exceedingly, exceedingly” (vv.6 and 20, referring to the fruitfulness of Avram’s descendants), “you and your seed after you” (vv.7, 10; see also v.19), “for the ages” (covenant and land, vv.7, 8, 13, 19), and “into your generations” (vv.7, 9, 12).	Preparatory to Avram’s assumption of fatherhood—of an individual and of a people—his name is changed (v.5), as is that of Sarai (v.15). This act is of the utmost significance in the biblical world. Since a person’s name was indicative of personality and fate, the receiving of a new one signified a new life or a new stage in life. Similarly, Yaakov (and in a sort of coronation, Yosef) will undergo a change of name. Such a practice still survives among kings and popes.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Visit and Promise<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)18:1–15</scrip>): The announcement of Sara’s impending child is set in the familiar ancient garb of a tale about divine travelers who visit an old couple. Central, as is usual in folklore, is the idea of hospitality, emphasized in the text by the threefold use of “pray” (please) (vv.3–4), “pass on/by” (vv.3–5), and by Avraham’s flurry of activity (he himself “runs” twice, “hastens” three times, and “fetches” four times in serving his guests).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Great Intercession<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)18:16–33</scrip>): With v.17 the narrative is interrupted, and there begins a remarkable scene in which man confronts God. As if to emphasize the importance of this encounter, the text presents God as thinking out loud, and using the intimate term “know” (see <scrip>(Genesis)4:1</scrip>) to describe his relationship to Avraham. And Avraham, the man through whom the nations “will find blessing” (v.18; see <scrip>(Genesis)12:3</scrip>), the progenitor of “a great . . . nation” (v.18; see <scrip>(Genesis)12:2</scrip>) that will see in justice its great goal, is now confronted with an urgent question of justice. While Avraham seems to be testing God in this story, it may in fact be precisely the reverse that is intended. Perhaps here more than anywhere else in the entire cycle (with the possible exception of Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)22</scrip>), Avraham appears as the worthy father of his people, the one who will “charge his sons and his household . . . to do what is right and just” (v.19). Without this story Avraham would be a man of faith but not a man of compassion and moral outrage, a model consistent with Moses and the Prophets of Israel.	The tightly structured, almost formal dialogue allows us to focus totally on the issue at hand. Predominating as refrains are the words “innocent” and “guilty,” along with the expected versions of “just/justice” that pervade Avraham’s remarks.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The End of Sedom and Amora<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)19</scrip>): The detailed and colorful story of Lot in Sedom and in flight from it adds a great deal to the Avraham cycle. On the one hand there is the portrayal of Lot’s continuing his uncle’s tradition of hospitality (vv.1–3), even to the extent of being willing to sacrifice his own daughters’ virginity. On the other hand Lot comes across as timid (vv.7–8) and fearful (vv.18–20). In fact the word “pray” (which we noted in Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)18</scrip> as a “hospitality term,” and which serves that function in verse 2 here as well) is used later in this chapter in a way that almost suggests whining. He thus once again brings Avraham’s personality into sharper focus.	The crimes of Sedom and Amora are at last indicated more openly: abuse of the sacred duty of hospitality, and sexual immorality (v.5). The latter theme returns at the end of the story, with the incestuous incident that takes place at the instigation of Lot’s daughters.	The story uses some stylized vocabulary. In v.13, the messengers talk of “bringing ruin,” just as we encountered in the Flood narrative (<scrip>(Genesis)6:13</scrip>). The narrative also gives negative twists to words which were positive in the previous chapter: “know” and “just” are changed to indicate illicit sex (v.5) and a condemnation of the alien Lot (v.9, “act-the-judge and adjudicate”). Here too, “door/entrance” is transformed from a place of contact with God to one of confrontation with men.	The account of the destruction itself is terse and mysterious, but it also reveals the predicament of an all-too-human man, Lot.	The final section of the Sedom and Amora story recounts the origins of two of Israel’s neighbors, the Moabites and Ammonites. As traditional enemies, they are not treated very kindly, any more than was the ancestor of the Canaanites in 9:20–27.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Wife—II<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)20</scrip>): The second occurrence of “The Matriarch Protected” comes immediately before the story of Yitzhak’s birth, as if to emphasize God’s hand in the process one more time. In this long variation on the theme, God is most active and Avraham most revealing of his past. He emerges from danger as a man who clearly enjoys God’s full protection and bounty.	The story almost draws a web of magic around Sara. Avimelekh is nearly killed by God, and Sara’s childlessness is inflicted upon all the women in the king’s household—even though there is not the slightest doubt of his innocence (he “had not come near her”).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Yitzhak Born<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)21:1–8</scrip>): Two principal ideas punctuate this climax for which we have waited since Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)12</scrip>: God keeps his promises (hence the poem in v.1), and the key word in the stories about Yitzhak: “laughter” (here the result of the actual birth). <i>Yishmael Banished<style> (<scrip>(Genesis)21:9–21</scrip>): Once Yitzhak has been born, separation must be made between heir and firstborn. Despite Avraham’s obvious love for him, Yishmael must leave; his mother must repeat her ordeal of Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)16</scrip> as well. Nonetheless the text emphasizes that God is there “with the lad” (v.20); twice the Yishmael motif of “God hearkening” resounds (v.17); and God promises that the boy will eventually attain the same exalted status as his brother (vv.13, 18).	Structurally, this brief tale foreshadows the next chapter, the ordeal of Yitzhak. It speaks of a journey into the unknown, a child at the point of death, the intervention of God’s “messenger,” the parent’s sighting of the way out, and the promise of future blessing. Of course the differences between the two stories are equally important.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Treaty<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)21:22–34</scrip>): This interlude, which usefully separates the life threats to Avraham’s two sons (for a similar example, see <scrip2>(1Sam. 25)I Sam. 25</scrip>), is one of many scenes demonstrating Avraham’s relationship with local princes.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Great Test<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)22</scrip>): This story is certainly one of the masterpieces of biblical literature. In a famous article by Erich Auerbach it is remarked how biblical style as exemplified here, in contradistinction to that of Homer and other epic bards, eschews physical and psychological details in favor of one central preoccupation: a man’s decision in relation to God. The result of this style is a terrible intensity, a story which is so stark as to be almost unbearable.	Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)22</scrip> is a tale of God’s seeming retraction of his promise (of “seed”) to Avraham. The fact that other issues may be involved here (i.e., Israel’s rejection of local and widely practiced ideas of child sacrifice) may be quite beside the point. Coming just one chapter after the birth of the long-awaited son, the story completely turns around the tension of the whole cycle and creates a new, frightening tension of its own. The real horror of the story lies in this threatened contradiction to what has gone before.	Most noticeable in the narrative is Avraham’s silence, his mute acceptance of, and acting on, God’s command. We are told of no sleepless night, nor does he ever say a word to God. Instead he is described with a series of verbs: starting-early, saddling, taking, splitting, arising, going (v.3; similarly in vv.6 and 9–10). Avraham the bargainer, so willing to enter into negotiations with relations (Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)13</scrip>), allies (Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)14</scrip>), local princes (Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)20</scrip>), and even God himself (Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)18</scrip>), here falls completely silent.	The chapter serves an important structural function in the Avraham cycle, framing it in conjunction with Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)12</scrip>. The triplet in v.2 (“Pray take your son,/ your only-one,/ whom you love”) recalls “from your land/ from your kindred/ from your father’s house” in <scrip>(Genesis)12:1</scrip>; “go-you-forth” and “the land that I will tell you of” (v.2; the latter, three times in the story) similarly point back to Avraham’s call (<scrip>(Genesis)12:1</scrip>, “Go-you-forth . . . to the land that I will let you see”). There he had been asked to give up the past (his father); here, the future (his son). Between the two events lies Avraham’s active life as man of God, ancestor, and intercessor. After this God will never speak with him again.	In many ways this story is the midpoint of Genesis. It brings the central theme of continuity and discontinuity to a head in the strongest possible way. After Moriyya, we can breathe easier, knowing that God will come to the rescue of his chosen ones in the direst of circumstances. At the same time we are left to ponder the difficulties of being a chosen one, subject to such an incredible test.	The story is also the paradigmatic narrative of the entire book. The Patriarch passes the test, and we know that the fulfillment of the divine promise is assured. Yet there is an ominous note: love, which occurs here by name for the first time, leads almost to heartbreak. So it will be for the rest of Genesis.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Purchase and Burial<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)23</scrip>): Even though he is now secure in God’s covenant, Avraham must still live and function in the human world. His purchase of a burial plot for Sara shows us once more his dealings with his neighbors, here as their equal, and also establishes at last his legal foothold in Canaan, albeit with a small piece of land. The long conversations and considerable formality of the chapter, which are not unusual in an ancient Near Eastern context, contrast with the extreme brevity of the previous chapter.	The narrative strikes a curious balance between the emotional reality of the situation (e.g., the repetition of “dead,” “presence,” and “bury”) and the requirements of legal procedure (“Hear me,” “give title,” and “holding”).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Betrothal Journey<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)24</scrip>): The last full episode of the Avraham cycle is the longest in the book. Its leisurely pace, attention to detail, and concentration on speeches as well as action belie the importance of what is being recounted: the finding of a wife for Yitzhak, who is biologically to continue the line. Yet after all that has happened in the previous chapters, we know that this will be taken care of by God. That is implied in Avraham’s assured “he himself [God] will send his messenger on before you” (v.7).	Many meeting/betrothal scenes in the Bible take place at a well (e.g., Yaakov, Moshe); this was probably a literary convention (see Culley 1976b and Alter 1981 for a discussion of the significance of such a phenomenon). Like other crucial moments in Avraham’s life the chapter involves a journey, albeit one made by his emissary. It is therefore natural that the key words of the chapter are “go,” “journey,” and “grant success.” “Take” also appears frequently, as the biblical term often used for “marry.”<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Avraham’s Descendants and Death<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)25:1–18</scrip>): Avraham’s death is bracketed by two passages dealing with his offspring: first, through Ketura (a concubine), and then through Hagar (Yishmael’s line). God’s promise is on the way to fulfillment, although Yitzhak is as yet childless and only a small portion of the land has been permanently acquired.<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b>Notes<content><style><h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>12:1<exerpt><b>	kindred:<content><style> Others use “birthplace.”<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>3<exerpt><b>	find blessing:<content><style> Or “seek to be blessed (as you).”<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>5<exerpt><b>	property . . . gained:<content><style> Heb. <i>rekhusham . . . rakhashu.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>6<exerpt><b>	Place:<content><style> Possibly with the implication of “sacred place.” <exerpt><b>Oak:<content><style> Some read “valley.” <exerpt><b>Moreh:<content><style> Some, like Buber, interpret this as “sage.” <exerpt><b>the Canaanite:<content><style> The peoples inhabiting the land at the time of the Israelite conquest under Joshua; see also <scrip>(Genesis)13:7</scrip>.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>7<exerpt><b>	seen:<content><style> Others use “appeared to,” which is more comfortable in English. “See” has been kept here as a leading word in the Avraham cycle.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>8<exerpt><b>	toward the sea:<content><style> West.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>9<exerpt><b>	the Negev:<content><style> The “dry,” southern portion of the land of Israel.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>10<exerpt><b>	sojourn:<content><style> To reside temporarily, as an alien. <exerpt><b>heavy:<content><style> Severe.<h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>15<exerpt><b>	Pharaoh:<content><style> Heb.

There hardly exists a story about him in which he is anything but a son and heir, a husband, or a father. His main task in life seems to be to take roots in the land of Canaan, an admittedly important task in the larger context of God’s promises in Genesis. What this means, unfortunately, is that he has almost no personality of his own. By Chapter 27, a scant two chapters after his father dies, he appears as (prematurely?) old, blind in both a literal and figurative sense, and as we will see, he fades out of the text entirely, only to die several chapters, and many years, later.	The true dynamic figure of the second generation here is Rivka. It is she to whom God reveals his plan, and she who puts into motion the mechanism for seeing that it is properly carried out. She is ultimately the one responsible for bridging the gap between the dream, as typified by Avraham, and the hard-won reality, as realized by Yaakov.<align=0><font12><content>	Avraham is a towering figure, almost unapproachable as a model in his intimacy with God and his ability to hurdle nearly every obstacle. Adding to this the fact that Yitzhak is practically a noncharacter, and that Yosef, once his rise begins, also lacks dimension as a personality, it becomes increasingly clear that it is Yaakov who emerges as the most dynamic and most human personality in the book. The stories about him cover fully half of Genesis, and reveal a man who is both troubled and triumphant. Most interestingly, he, and not Avraham, gives his name to the people of Israel.	Distinctive themes of the cycle include physical struggle, deception, and confrontation. These are expressed through the key words of Yaakov’s name (“Heel-Holder” and “Heel-Sneak,” then Yisrael, “God-Fighter”), “deceive” and similar words, and “face.” Also recurring are the terms “love,” “bless,” “firstborn-right,” and “wages/hire” (one word in Hebrew). The cycle is structured partly around etiologies (folk explanations of place-names and personal names) and also around Yaakov’s use of stones in several of the stories.	Continuing from the Avraham cycle are such earlier themes as wandering, sibling rivalry, the barren wife, wives in conflict, the renaming of the protagonist, God perceived in dreams and visions; and particular geographical locations such as Bet-El, Shekhem, and the Negev (Cassuto 1974).	Finally, it should be mentioned that the Yaakov stories are notable in the manner in which they portray the two levels of biblical reality: divine and human. Throughout the stories human beings act according to normal (though often strong) emotions, which God then uses to carry out his master plan. In this cycle one comes to feel the interpretive force of the biblical mind at work, understanding human events in the context of what God wills. It is a fascinating play between the ideas of fate and free will, destiny and choice—a paradox which nevertheless lies at the heart of the biblical conception of God and humankind.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Rivka’s Children<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)25:19–34</scrip>): Two stories of sibling confrontation begin the Yaakov cycle. From the first, vv. 19–28, all the necessary conditions are introduced for what is to come: struggle in the womb (foreshadowing Yaakov’s wrestling match in Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)32</scrip>, the structural resolution of this earlier one), God’s plan for the younger son to outdo the older one, the importance of names as clues to personalities, and parental preference. This last point seals the fate of the two boys.	The second story (vv.29–34) is Yaakov’s first act of stealth, and sets the pattern for his whole life. Note at the same time the text’s emphasis on Esav’s role (v.34), “Thus did Esav despise the firstborn-right.”	As before, these episodes point in two temporal directions. Esav resembles Yishmael, the man of the bow; and parental preference will launch the initially tragic action in the Yosef story (Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)37</scrip>).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>In the Land<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)26:1–6</scrip>): As we have suggested, there is no true collection of stories about Yitzhak. That is, virtually nowhere does Yitzhak appear in a tale where, as a distinct individual, he is a central character. And unlike Yaakov and Yosef, Yitzhak never directly receives his father’s blessing. This is bestowed by God, and one gets the impression that even Avraham does not deal with his son as an individual. This is not surprising, given Yitzhak’s function in his father’s life.	For the narrative, his main purpose, as we have stressed above, is simply to remain in the land (note the repetition of the word “land” in this section). It is almost as if Avraham, the man who lives in the shadow of sacred trees, plants one in the person of his son. In this chapter Yitzhak is forbidden to go beyond the borders of Canaan. Even his death, so seemingly out of place in Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)35</scrip>, occurs after Yaakov has returned home from his wanderings: only when it is assured that there will be continuity in the land is he allowed to die—despite the fact that as a result the text must leave him blind and dying for twenty years.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Wife—III<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)26:7–11</scrip>): Here is the final “Yitzhak version” of the tale, constructed around the same king whom Avraham had encountered in Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)20</scrip>. Its individual coloring is supplied by the “laughing-and-loving” of v.8, playing on Yitzhak’s name. Otherwise, just as in the following episode, he is merely repeating his father’s experience. <i>Blessing<style> (<scrip>(Genesis)26:12–33</scrip>): Confirmation of Yitzhak’s status as heir comes in vv.12–14, in the form of material blessings (already referred to immediately after Avraham’s death, <scrip>(Genesis)25:11</scrip>). It will be Yaakov’s task to reclaim and continue the spiritual side of the tradition.	The first episode is centered around not Yitzhak but Avraham. The phrase “his father” reverberates; and Avimelekh returns. In the second episode, Avraham’s treaty with that king (Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)21</scrip>) is replayed, with the same result as before: an explanation of the name Be’er-Sheva.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Deceit and Blessing<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)26:34</scrip>–<scrip>(Genesis)28:9</scrip>): Of all the stories of Genesis, this is perhaps the most brilliantly staged. Nowhere is the narrative so vivid as here, and nowhere, even including Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)22</scrip>, is the tension so masterfully drawn out.	Despite the fact that the story line is a simple one, involving deception and the “taking” of the blessing, the text is imbued with great subtlety. Most striking is the sensuality it invokes: seven times we hear of “game,” six of the “delicacy” (or “tasty-dish”), and three times Yitzhak “feels” Yaakov (who “comes close” four times). In fact the story makes use of all five of the senses. One sense—that of sight—is defective, and on that deficiency will turn the action of the story. Yet another level of meaning is apparent: “to see” in ancient Israel, as in many cultures, was a term connected to prophetic powers, as we observed regarding Avraham. So here, ironically, Yitzhak’s blindness leads to both deception and to the proper transferral of the blessing.	Structurally the story is framed by two references to Esav and his wives: <scrip>(Genesis)26:34–35</scrip> prepares the way for his loss of the blessing, by showing that he has alienated himself from his parents (and broken Avraham’s charge regarding Yitzhak in <scrip>(Genesis)24:3</scrip>), and <scrip>(Genesis)28:6–9</scrip> finds Esav obeying his father and making a rather pathetic attempt to reassure himself of his love.	Some of the story’s motifs will return later. The threefold “as he loves” looks to the crucial role that the theme of “love” will play later on in Genesis (as well as being a key to the story itself). The general theme of nonrecognition will return with an interesting twist in the Yosef novella (especially in Chaps. <scrip>(Genesis)42–44</scrip>).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Yaakov Sets Out<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)28:10–22</scrip>): Yaakov’s journey takes him not only to a foreign land, but to the portals of adulthood. It begins fittingly with a dream vision, so that we will know from the start that God is with him. In fact Yaakov always encounters God at crucial life junctures, at the point of journeys (<scrip>(Genesis)31:3</scrip>—leaving Aram; <scrip>(Genesis)32:25</scrip>ff.—meeting Esav; <scrip>(Genesis)35:1</scrip>— returning to Bet-El; <scrip>(Genesis)35:9</scrip>ff.—the homecoming; and <scrip>(Genesis)46:2</scrip>ff.—on the way to Egypt).	The setting for this particular encounter is highly unusual, especially when compared to the generally nongeographical nature of the revelations to Avraham. The idea of a sacred site (“place,” a biblical word with these connotations, occurs three times) is strongly suggested. The notion of a ladder or ramp (or “gateway,” v.17) between the divine and human worlds is well known in ancient stories. A variation of the theme occurs in <scrip>(Genesis)32:2–3</scrip>, where Yaakov sees “messengers” again in an “encounter”; these two stories frame the middle of the entire cycle.	As Yaakov enters his adult life, he resembles both his grandfather Avraham, the visionary, and his son Yosef, the dreamer.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Arrival in Aram<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)29:1–14</scrip>): As one might expect from the usual biblical pattern, Yaakov meets his bride-to-be at a well. As in other ancient stories (see also <scrip2>Ex. 2:15–17</scrip>) the hero performs a feat of physical strength, this time with a large stone—continuing the use of stones as a motif in the Yaakov stories.	Lavan is once again the chief representative of the family, as he was in the betrothal account of Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)24</scrip>.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Deception Repaid<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)29:15–30</scrip>): The language of the text here, as well as the tenor of the situation, suggest that the Bible has set up Yaakov’s punishment for having stolen Yitzhak’s blessing from his brother. “Deceived” (v.25) and “younger . . . firstborn” (v.26) echo the Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)27</scrip> narrative, and provide another example of biblical justice. <i>Love, Jealousy, and Children<style> (<scrip>(Genesis)29:31–30:24</scrip>): The narrative now demonstrates (1) how Yaakov prospers in exile, increasing both in wealth and in progeny, and thus (2) how God fulfills his promise to the Patriarchs to “make them many.” Characteristically for the Bible, this takes place as a result of human emotions: the jealousy of two sisters who are married to the same man. The emotions, interestingly, are portrayed largely through the names given to Yaakov’s sons. In the end Lea seems to be the victor, at least in the terms of a culture that prizes the production of male children; she becomes the mother of fully half of the sons of Israel (Redak). <i>Yaakov in Exile: Stealth and Prosperity<style> (<scrip>(Genesis)30:25–32:1</scrip>): The long account of how Yaakov outwits Lavan rounds out the portrait of his personality: he is a man at once clever, successful, and harassed. The text goes to great lengths to describe both men in behavior and thought, and we are given enough dialogue to be able to understand their motivations. The repeating words point to major themes: “serve,” “wages,” “face” (which will become central to the whole cycle by Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)32</scrip>), and a whole vocabulary of trickery: “steal” (with the variations “be stealthy” and “steal the wits”), “take away” (see Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)27</scrip>), “snatch,” and “rob.” <i>Preparations for Esav<style> (<scrip>(Genesis)32:2–24</scrip>): As if to portend something momentous, Yaakov’s first act upon setting out for home is an encounter with “messengers of God.” From this starting point everything is subsequently a matter of “two camps” (v.8) or two levels: the divine and the human. This is the key to understanding the meeting between Yaakov and his brother in its entirety: Yaakov will have to deal with God before he can resolve his problem with Esav.	With an obsequiousness whose language reflects both the culture and the emotional setting, Yaakov prepares a gift for Esav, but finds to his dismay that his brother is “coming to meet him,” with seemingly hostile intent. Once again stealth (or at least extreme caution) is the rule, with Yaakov taking elaborate precautions.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Mysterious Stranger: Struggle at the Yabbok<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)32:25–33</scrip>): Unexpectedly there is a break in the narrative. The stage has been set for something mysterious to happen with a nighttime backdrop and accented references to “crossing” (vv.23–24), which clearly refers to more than just the river.	The great wrestling scene at the Yabbok both symbolizes and resolves beforehand Yaakov’s meeting with Esav, much as Shakespeare’s prebattle dream scenes (e.g., <i>Julius Caesar, Richard III, Macbeth<style>) will do with his characters. Struggle, the motif already introduced in the mother’s womb (Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)25</scrip>), returns here, but that is not the only consideration. At issue is Yaakov’s whole life and personality, which despite his recent material successes are still under the pall of Esav’s curse (<scrip>(Genesis)27:36</scrip>). Central, then, is the change of name in v.29, which suggests both a victorious struggle and the emergence of a new power. This is further supported by the Hebrew plays on sound: <i>Y’KB<style> (Yaakov), <i>YBK<style> (Yabbok), and <i>Y’BK<style> (wrestling).	The story may have originated as the well-known tale of a hero fighting a river divinity, but it clearly has been transformed into something much broader by its position and vocabulary.	On the mysterious aspects of both the story and the name Israel, see Geller. <i><h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Resolution<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)33:1–17</scrip>): Once the Yabbok crisis is past, there is hope for reconciliation of the brothers. Even so, Yaakov exercises caution, behaving like a man who is presenting tribute to a king. The narrative is brought full circle in vv.10 and 11, where “face” is once again highlighted and where Yaakov’s gift is termed a “token-of-blessing.” At last the tension of Yaakov’s early life seems resolved. <i>Home: Peace and Violence<style> (<scrip>(Genesis)33:18–34:31</scrip>): “Yaakov came home in peace to the city of Shekhem” (<scrip>(Genesis)33:18</scrip>) continues the theme of resolution. Not only has Esav accepted his gift, but Yaakov has arrived home safely, in fulfillment of his prayer in 28:21. Like Avraham he purchases land; again like him he builds an altar.	Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)34</scrip>, however, shatters the newly created atmosphere of security and peace (“peaceably disposed” in v.21 is a bitter twist). Whereas Avraham and Yitzhak had been able to conclude treaties with the inhabitants of Canaan, Yaakov winds up in the opposite position. The text implies, as usual, that Canaanite sexual behavior is odious (v.7, “such [a thing] is not to be done!”), and this provides the spring for the action. Interestingly, Yaakov’s sons act somewhat like their father had, “with deceit” (v.13); and love once again leads to an unfortunate end.	The vengefulness and brutality of Yaakov’s sons in this story anticipates their later behavior in the Yosef story (Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)37</scrip>); surprisingly, it is for the present crime and not the sale of Yosef that their father condemns them on his deathbed (<scrip>(Genesis)49:5–7</scrip>).	The chapter is notable for the latitude it allows its characters to express their thoughts and emotions: Shekhem’s desire and love, the sons’ anger and cunning, the Hivvites’ gullibility and greed, and Yaakov’s fear. Like other stories in the Yaakov cycle, it presents us with a somewhat ambiguous situation, where right and wrong are not always simple and the putative heroes are not always heroic.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Home: Blessing and Death<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)35</scrip>): Several brief notices round out Yaakov’s return to Canaan. First (vv.1–7) there is the return to Bet-El, where he builds an altar and has the “foreign” gods of his household people put away—thus fulfilling his promise in Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)28</scrip>. This passage is built upon the Hebrew word <i>El,<style> God (related actually to an earlier Northwest Semitic name for a god).	Apparently a second version of Yaakov’s name change is recorded in vv.9–15. As in the case of Avraham, seed and land are promised by God. The land can be given to him and “to your seed after you” only upon his return.	Finally, spread out through the chapter are the accounts of three deaths: Devora, Rivka’s nurse (v.8—a veiled reference to Rivka’s own death?), Rahel (vv.16–20), and finally Yitzhak (vv.28–29). Yaakov’s youth is over, with the dramatic break with those close to him in that period.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Re’uven<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)35:21–22</scrip>): The following tiny fragment, concerning Re’uven’s usurping his father’s concubine, serves to presage his fall as firstborn later on. Such an act had symbolic value in biblical society; Avshalom (Absalom) sleeps with David’s concubines as a sign of rebellion and a desire to attain the crown (<scrip2>(2Sam. 16:21–22)II Sam. 16:21–22</scrip>). <i>Esav’s Descendants<style> (36): The complicated genealogies and dynasties of this chapter close out the first part of the Yaakov cycle, strictly speaking. Fitting in the context of a society which lay great store by kinship and thus by careful remembering of family names, it may also indicate the greatness of Yitzhak’s line, as Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)25</scrip> had earlier done for Avraham. Certainly the lists give evidence of a time when the Edomites were more than merely Israel’s neighbors, assuming great importance in historical recollection (Speiser).<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b>Notes<content><style><h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>25:20<exerpt><b>	forty years old:<content><style> Another schematic number.

All the major characters are painfully expressive of their feelings, from the doting father to the spoiled son, from the malicious brothers to the lustful wife of Potifar, from the nostalgic adult Yosef to the grief-stricken old Yaakov. It is only through the subconscious medium of dreams, in three sets, that we are made to realize that a higher plan is at work which will supersede the destructive force of these emotions.	For this is a story of how “ill”—with all its connotations of fate, evil, and disaster—is changed to good. Despite the constant threat of death to Yosef, to the Egyptians, and to Binyamin, the hidden, optimistic thrust of the story is “life,” a word that appears in various guises throughout. Even “face,” the key word of the Yaakov cycle which often meant something negative, is here given a kinder meaning, as the resolution to Yaakov’s life.	A major subtheme of the plot is the struggle for power between Re’uven and Yehuda. Its resolution has implications that are as much tribal as personal, for the tribe of Yehuda later became the historical force in ancient Israel as the seat of the monarchy.	Although many details of the narrative confirm Egyptian practices, those practices actually reflect an Egypt considerably later than the period of the Patriarchs (Redford). Of interest also is the prominence of the number five in the story, a detail that is unexplained but that gives some unity to the various sections of text.	In many ways the Yosef material repeats elements in the Yaakov traditions. A long list could be compiled, but let us at least mention here sibling hatred, exile of the hero, foreign names, love and hate, dreams, and deception—even so detailed as to duplicate the use of a goats'-kid. But its focusing on a classic rags-to-riches plot, with the addition of a moralistic theme, make the Yosef story a distinctive and always popular tale, accessible in a way that the more difficult stories of the first three parts of Genesis are not.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Young Yosef: Love and Hate<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)37</scrip>): As has been the pattern with the Avraham and Yaakov cycles, the opening chapter here introduces the key themes of the entire story. These include the father’s love, the power of words, dreams, “ill” as a key word (here denoting evil intent but eventually encompassing misfortune, among other concepts), and of course, the brothers’ hatred, which at first glance is the motivating force behind the action.	But the initial blame for what happens clearly lies with the father (vv.3–4), and is made unbearable by Yosef’s own behavior. In point of fact he is largely responsible for his own downfall, bearing tales about his brothers (v.2) even before Yaakov’s preference for him is noted. His insistence on telling his dreams to his brothers must be galling, particularly the second time (v.9), coming as it does after the report that “they hated him still more for his dreams” (v.8).	The key word of the chapter, not surprisingly, is “brother,” culminating in Yehuda’s ironic words (v.27): “let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother. . . .” Shortly afterward Yosef, their “(own) flesh,” is sold into slavery and probable death.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Yehuda and Tamar<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)38</scrip>): Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)38</scrip> has been the subject of many discussions, for it seems to be out of place. It interrupts the story of Yosef at a crucial dramatic spot, and is not chronologically fully consistent with it (Yehuda ages considerably; then we return to Yosef as a seventeen-year-old). Some feel that the suspension in the drama helps to raise tension; others argue that this is the only possible place to put an important tradition about the important brother. While these and other arguments may have their merit, one may discern some significant thematic connections as well, both within the context of the Yosef story and of Genesis as a whole.	The episode first of all demonstrates the growth of Yehuda as a character who is central to the Yosef novella. Already in Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)37</scrip> he had demonstrated active leadership, albeit in a questionable cause. There he actually saved Yosef’s life, in contrast to Re’uven’s unsuccessful and ultimately self-centered rescue attempt. As the one who basically assumes responsibility, he will be made to undergo an inner development in the narrative, and again becomes the one to take charge of the youngest son (Binyamin, in Chaps. <scrip>(Genesis)43</scrip> and <scrip2>44</scrip>). The missing piece that begins to explain his nobility in this regard (Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)44</scrip>) is the present chapter. Yehuda here learns what it is to lose sons, and to want desperately to protect his youngest. Although his failure to marry off Tamar to the youngest son leads to public humiliation (twice, actually), his response shows that he immediately accepts blame: “She is in-the-right more than I!” (v.26). Such an interpretation is further confirmed by the restriction of the word “pledge” to here and 43:9. Yehuda has learned what it means to stake oneself for a principle.	Only after we have been informed of Yehuda’s change can the narrative resume with Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)39</scrip>. True to biblical thinking, redemption may start only after the crime has been punished (e.g., the Samson story, where the hero’s hair begins to grow immediately after his imprisonment).	Actually the chronology works out quite well. We are told via <scrip>(Genesis)41:46</scrip>, <scrip2>53–54</scrip>, that about twenty years elapse between the sale of Yosef and his meetings with the brothers in Egypt; this often signifies a period in biblical parlance and could encompass a generation or a bit less. Since Yehuda was quite possibly a father already in Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)37</scrip>, the present story could well end just before the events reported in Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)43</scrip>—in other words, Yehuda reaches full inner maturity just in time.	The other function of this story seems to be to carry out the major theme of Genesis as we have presented it: continuity and discontinuity between the generations. What is at stake here is not merely the line of one of the brothers, but the line which (as the biblical audience must have been fully aware) will lead to royalty—King David was a descendant of Peretz of v.29. This should not be surprising in a book of origins; we noted the possible mention of Jerusalem in 14:18. Apparently a popular early theme, connected as we have noted to the power of God in history, continuity/discontinuity is repeated in somewhat similar circumstances in the book of Ruth (which contains the only other mention of “begettings” outside of Genesis and <scrip2>Num. 3:1</scrip>).	The narrator has woven Chaps. <scrip>(Genesis)38</scrip> and <scrip2>37</scrip> together with great skill. Again a man is asked to “recognize” objects, again the use of a kid, and again a brother (this time a dead one) is betrayed.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Yosef: Rise and Fall<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)39</scrip>): This chapter prefigures Yosef’s eventual rise to power and simultaneously chronicles his lowest point, literally and figuratively. The two strands of the plot are woven together into a pattern of success/authority —> imprisonment —> success/authority. This also mirrors the larger story, which progresses from favorite son —> slavery —> viceroy of Egypt. The integration takes place partly through the medium of a key word, “hand”—which also occurred four times at the end of Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)38</scrip> and thus acts as a further textual connector. Yosef’s success is tied six times to the phrase “in his hands” (vv.3, 4, 6, 8, 22, 23); he is thrown into prison because of the garments that he left in his mistress’s “hands” (vv.12, 13). Similarly, the movement of the chapter is mirrored in the word “eyes,” which is linked first to the theme of authority (v.4), then to the attempted seduction (v.7), and finally to authority again (v.21) (Alter).	The chapter also repeats the phrase “And it was” (in one form or another) some twelve times, as a distinct stylistic pattern.	Yosef’s temporary downfall occurs here for reasons beyond literary balance or suspense. It is in a very real sense the punishment for the bratty behavior of his adolescence. Once again words (this time not his own) get him into trouble (vv.17, 19), as they did in 37:8. And once again a garment is displayed as proof of a fabricated crime.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The Rise to Power: Dreams<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)40:1–41:52</scrip>): Continued are the themes of Yosef’s success in adversity and skill in interpreting dreams (yet his father and brother, and not he, had done the interpreting in Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)37</scrip>!). In Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)37</scrip> dreams had brought about his downfall; here (Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)40</scrip>) they will help the cupbearer and in Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)41</scrip> ultimately save a country, his family, and himself. Yosef’s self-assurance and reliance on God, already evident in <scrip>(Genesis)39:9</scrip>, here mean that it will not be long before he stands at the pinnacle.	Yosef’s dramatic rise to power is an old and favorite motif in folklore. The text colorfully presents Pharaoh’s dreams, in great detail, especially in his emotional retelling. All the more striking then is Yosef’s simple interpretation (<scrip>(Genesis)41:23–27</scrip>).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Famine: The Brothers Come<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)41:53–42:38</scrip>): Worldwide famine creates the backdrop for the family drama that is about to unfold. The ancients understood famine as sent by the gods, often as punishment; and the events of our text suggest that God is indeed the prime mover here. We are again presented with the characters of Chap. <scrip>(Genesis)37</scrip>, all of whom have somehow changed. Yaakov emerges as more pitiful than ever (a shadow of the wrestler at the Yabbok), Yosef as powerful governor, not only of all Egypt but of his family’s destiny as well, and the brothers, remarkably, are repentant (<scrip>(Genesis)42:21–22</scrip>). We also see Yosef’s emotional side for the first time. He weeps in <scrip>(Genesis)42:24</scrip>, as he will do three times again (<scrip>(Genesis)43:30</scrip>; <scrip2>45:2</scrip>, <scrip2>14–15</scrip>). <i>The Test<style> (43–44): Yosef’s testing of his brothers is masterful, not only because of the plan itself, but also because of the depth of emotion that the text evokes in its characterizations. It demonstrates how well the whole story has been integrated into the Yaakov material, for here as well as there long conversations are used to reveal complex passions.	Some have questioned the morality of Yosef’s actions, seeing that the aged Yaakov might well have died while the test was progressing, without ever finding out that Yosef had survived. But that is not the point of the story. What it <i>is<style> trying to teach (among other things) is a lesson about crime and repentance. Only by recreating something of the original situation—the brothers are again in control of the life and death of a son of Rahel—can Yosef be sure that they have changed. Once the brothers pass the test, life and covenant can then continue.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Reconciliation<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)45</scrip>): In revealing his true identity at last, Yosef makes two points: first, that it was all part of God’s plan; and second, that the family must immediately prepare for migration to Egypt. Thus the personal story is intertwined with the national one, and the text therefore gives limited time and space to psychological details. The motif of God’s plan is stressed by the repetition of “God sent me” (vv.5, 7, 8), while the anticipated bounties of settling in Egypt are brought out by the threefold “good-things of Egypt” (vv.18, 20, 23) and by the repeated exhortation to “come” (vv.18, 19). <i>Migration to Egypt<style> (<scrip>(Genesis)45:16–47:12</scrip>): Yaakov’s descent to Egypt involves three meetings: with God, with Yosef, and with Pharaoh. The first is God’s final revelation to Yaakov. God had previously forbidden Yitzhak to go to Egypt during a famine (<scrip>(Genesis)26:1–2</scrip>), but his son may now go as part of the divine plan, his people’s destiny. The blessing given to Avraham’s children (particularly to Yishmael) is repeated in <scrip>(Genesis)46:3</scrip>, and God will be “with” Yaakov (<scrip>(Genesis)46:4</scrip>) on this journey as he has been on others.	The meeting between father and long-lost son is brief but powerful, returning as it does to the “face” motif (<scrip>(Genesis)46:30</scrip>). Immediately afterward Yosef gives the family advice on how to demonstrate their usefulness to the Egyptians, and one is struck by the precariousness of their situation in even this best of circumstances.	Yaakov’s brief audience with Pharaoh is both moving and pathetic. The Patriarch sums up his life in depressing terms, and it becomes clear that long life (he believes his own to be short), in addition to wealth and fertility, is considered a sign of divine favor.	The actual migration is sketched in a few brief strokes. The list of names in <scrip>(Genesis)46:8–27</scrip> has been constructed on patterned numbers, with a total of seventy.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Yosef the Life-Giver<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)47:13–26</scrip>): The events of this section are not attested historically in Egyptian records. Perhaps they have been included here to confirm Yosef’s stature as Rescuer, not only of his family but of all Egypt as well (see note to <scrip4>(Genesis)<scrip5>42:2</scrip>). The description of Yosef’s power is now complete: just as the brothers were ready to “become my lord’s servants” (<scrip>(Genesis)44:9</scrip>), so now are the Egyptians (<scrip>(Genesis)47:25</scrip>).	Some have seen the episode as an ironic reversal of what is to come in Exodus, with the Egyptians’ enslavement of the Israelites; if so, this interlude may have been an amusing one to ancient Israelite audiences.	The text uses the repetition of the phrase “to/for Pharaoh” to effectively paint the legal transaction regarding Egyptian "land" (repeated twelve times in vv. 18-26).<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Yosef’s Sons Blessed<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)48</scrip>): Yaakov, near to death, blesses his grandsons (Rahel’s!) in moving terms, bringing full circle many of the motifs of his life. Elder and younger sons are switched by the blind Patriarch, who this time, though, is one who is fully aware of their identities. As in both literature and life, a dying man sees both past (here) and future (the next chapter) with great clarity, as in a vision. <i>Yaakov’s Testament and Death<style> (49): In this ancient piece of poetry, Yaakov addresses his sons, not as they are, but as they will be. There is little resemblance, for instance, between the Binyamin as the beloved and protected youngest son of the Yosef story and the preying wolf of v.27, but the Benjaminites were later to be known for their military skills. Scholars have therefore seen the entire poem as a retrojection of Israel as it came to be on the days of the Patriarchs.	As in the fuller Yosef narrative, the first three sons are quickly disqualified from active leadership, paving the way for the rise of Yehuda (the tribe from which sprang David and the royal house of Israel). Despite this, Yosef still receives the richest blessing.	The chapter is textually among the most difficult in the Torah. Many passages are simply obscure, leaving the translator to make at best educated guesses.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>Yaakov’s Burial<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)50:1–14</scrip>): The funeral of Yaakov seems to presage the Exodus from Egypt—here with Pharaoh’s permission and a large royal escort (including “chariots and horsemen,” who in several generations will pursue Yaakov’s descendants into the sea).	Interestingly, the <i>Iliad<style> also ends with an elaborate burial scene. The contrast is instructive: the Homeric epic celebrates the deeds and mourns the lost youth of a hero (Hector); Genesis reflects Yosef’s standing at court and the desire to bury Yaakov in the land of Canaan, in the family plot. Note too that Genesis has two more scenes, tending to lessen the impact of this impressive funeral sequence.<h2><p=art><align=0><title><font12><i>The End of the Matter<content><style> (<scrip1>(Genesis)50:15–26</scrip>): Drawing out the tension inherent in the Patriarchs’ family relationships to the very end, the text repeats an earlier situation in Yaakov’s life—his brother’s feelings of “grudge” and threats to kill him—in the guise of his sons’ fears toward Yosef. Here, however, there can be no question of personal vengeance, since Yosef sees the brothers’ betrayal of him as but part of a larger purpose. In his words of v.20, “God planned-it-over for good . . . to keep many people alive,” the text resolves two of the great hanging issues that have persisted throughout Genesis: sibling hatred and the threat to generational continuity.	Left hanging, of course, is the issue of the promised land, since the narrative concludes “in Egypt,” but these final chapters lead to the assurance that God will “take account” (vv.24–25) of the Sons of Israel, as they are soon to be termed.<h1><p=art><align=1><title><font14><b>Notes<content><style><h2><p=art><align=40><scrip3><font12><style>37:2<exerpt><b>	begettings:<content><style> In the sense of “family history.” As noted above, the Yosef story is a continuation of the Yaakov saga. <exerpt><b>seventeen:<content><style> Together with <scrip>(Genesis)47:28</scrip>, this provides another example of numerical balance in these stories (see the Commentary on “The Patriarchal Narratives,” p. 51).
