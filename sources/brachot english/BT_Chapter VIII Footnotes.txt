4 If there were no wine or bread for Grace before meals, the Kiddush would be omitted.

6 And proclaimed that when Bet Shammai and Bet Hillel differ, the Halakah is in agreement with the latter. See Erubin 13 b. 

7 Consequently it was necessary to make the above statement. 

8 When it interferes with a discussion of Halakah; see Bab. Mesia' 59 b.

1 By giving it precedence over the benediction over wine. 

2 I.e. after the meal, over the cup of wine he says Grace, the benediction over the wine, light, spices and Habdalah, the last-named corresponding to "the benediction of the day." Consequently "the benediction of the day" comes last and not first as was stated above. 

3 On the next folio, p. 337, it is stated that according to R. Meir, the point at issue is not the order of light and spices, but the benediction over the food ; consequently the quoted Baraita could be Bet Hillel's teaching. 

4 To connect the Baraita with our Mishnah. 

5 The Mishnah places the benediction over food, according to both Schools, in the middle, whereas the Baraita allows it to come first. We have, therefore, to depend upon the difference of the two Schools in the version of R. Judah, viz. the order of light and spices, according to which the Baraita agrees with Bet Shammai. 

6 According to the Mishnah, Bet Shammai require the benediction over the day before that over the wine ; but according to the Baraita (which it is concluded emanates from Bet Shammai) the benediction over the wine precedes the Habdalah. 

=====================================================

Page: 334
----------
1 The advent is marked by the benediction over the day, therefore it should come first, and it is to that the Mishnah refers. 

2 The conclusion is marked by the Habdalah and should come last. Since the baraita refers to the conclusion of the holy day, it does not conflict with the Mishnah. 

3 The Barita stated : "Should he have only one cup of wine, he leaves it until after the meal and combines all [the benedictions] afterwards," i.e. wine is required for Grace. But according to the Mishnah, if wine is brought to the man after he has eaten, so that he has not yet said a benediction over wine, he does so over this cup, drinks it and then says Grace; therefore wine is not essential for the Grace. 

4 I.e. dips his finger in the wine, which he then puts to his mouth. 

5 According to the Tanna of the Mishnah, i.e. R. Judah, Bet Shammai require wine for Grace ; but R. Hiyya understands them as not requiring it. 

6 Liquid is the conductor of defilement for food ; cf. Lev. xi. 34. 

7 Without the medium of a liquid; so why this fear?

1 Contracting defilement from something else. 

2 Even if the hands are not moist. 

3 Unless it be unclean in the first degree. 

4 From the interior of the cup on to the exterior and thereby increase the possibility of the hand contracting defilement. 

5 And the hands are then clean for the meal. 

6 Should he wipe his hands during the meal.

3 Which belongs to the class of holy things and can be defiled by a table unclean in the second degree. 

4 To protect themselves against defilement. 

5 Bet Hillel's reason was the desire to protect the food from defilement. 

6 And Bet Shammai are concerned to protect the hands from defilement. 

7 The water may splash on to it, and it is forbidden to spoil food ; cf. fol. 50b, p. 324. 

8 Which may be spoiled by being splashed upon. The words in brackets are omitted by M. and are probably an interpolation. 

==========================================

1 Consequently there is no need to fear that bread will be spoilt by the water, since the crumbs do not count. 

2 Therefore the attendant will know that the larger pieces have to be removed, and the washing of the hands can safely be done before the table is cleared. 

3 This, not Jose as in edd., is probably the correct reading. Cf. D. S. ad loc. 

4 M. omits : b. Judah. 

5 M.: Rab. 

6 Why, then, did Raba say the benediction over spices before over the light? 

7 I.e. continned the teaching of the Mishnah which must be supplemented as follows. 

8 Hence Raba acted aright in saying the benediction over the spices first. 

==========================================

1 The word used by Bet Hillel. It ia the participle of the verb. 

2 Or, he continues to create. 

3 To Bet Shammai that bore' can mean "he will create." In all the following passages the participle refers to the past. 

4 Rashi explains: coloured lights, as red, white, green. "[Bet] Hillel considered the different colours of bodies to be due to different sorts of light : whilst [Bet] Shammai attributed colour to the object coloured, and not to the light by means of which we see it" (S. Brodetsky iu J. R. ii. p. 66). 

5 I.e. by its light forbidden work has been done on the Sabbath. 

6 Throughout this passage some edd. read "Samaritans," for fear of the Censor. 

7 Therefore the objection to "the spices of the gentiles" cannot be on the ground of idolatry. 

8 M.: Rab Ashe. On Sura, see p. 74 n. 1. 

==========================================

1 E.g. attending to a sick person. 

2 M. omits : b. Isaac. 

3 Provided it was lit before the advent of the Sabbath ; but if kindled on the Sabbath, one may not use it for the benediction. 

4 I.e. the flame is not to be considered as continuous and the same, but as consisting of a succession of flashes, each distinct. Consequently it may be thought that the prohibited light ceases with the termination of the Sabbath, and the flame then becomes permissible for the purpose of the benediction. 

5 The circumstance referred to here is : A man puts oil in a vessel and places it in the public way, and by means of a torch which he holds while in the private domain, sets light to it. 

6 The flame of the burning oil is distinct from the torch which ignited it; and the law only considers an infraction of the Sabbath the carrying of the same thing from the private to the public way or vice versa. Since then, in that circumstance, the man is deemed guilty of an infraction of the law, the ignited oil must be considered identical with the torch. 

7 Viz. the original torch of the gentile which may have been used for work on the Sabbath. 

8 The light kindled by the Israelite. 


==========================================

1 Who may have kindled his light on the Sabbath, which is forbidden. 

2 Which may have been ignited on the Sabbath. If, however, the light of the gentile had not been kindled on the Sabbath, it would be allowed. 

3 This clause is only inserted for completeness and is not to be pressed for any deductions.  

4 M. : Rab said. 

5 I.e. very soon after sunset. 

6 Because a Jew would not be found holding a torch then, since it is a forbidden act on the Sabbath. 

7 It is then worthy of being considered an illumination. 

8 When it is in full blaze and gives forth illumination. 

==========================================

--------
1 In whose honour the light had been kindled; and since it is not an ordinary illumination it cannot be used for the benediction. 

2 Who may be having his meal there, and consequently the light is for illumination and the benediction may be said. 

3 By whose light the beadle could have his meal ; therefore the illumination is in honour of a distinguished visitor and cannot be used for the benediction. 

4 I.e. the religious devotion of a Congregation is better than that of an individual. 

5 All those studying would have to stop to listen, perhaps in the middle of a difficult passage; whereas each could say the benediction when most convenient for him. 

6 An exclamation meaning "healing," when somebody sneezed. J. T. Chap, vi, has the Greek word *** in place of the Hebrew marpe'. See J. E. II. p. 255. In Tosifta Shab. viii. 5, it is denounced as a superstitious custom. On the Eastern etiquette in the event of one sneezing, see Lane, p. 210.

1 And not as illumination. 

2 And not for smelling. 

3 M.: Rab said. 

4 I.e. at the burial of an eminent person to pay him honour. This was the Roman custom; cf. D. C. A. p. 103. 

5 If the funeral takes place at the conclusion of the Sabbath. 

6 Because it is used as illumination. 

7 Because it is used as a disinfectant and not for smelling. 

8 On the hands after a meal, the oil being mixed with spices. In the case of the oil, it means that the benediction is not "Who createst fragrant wood" but "Who createst fragrant oil"; see fol. 43 a, p. 280. 

9 I.e. the perfume is not there for one to smell but to be sold. 

10 In 'Erubin 64 b, the Rabbis deplore that the Jewish women are addicted to sorcery. Hillel declared : "The more women, the more witchcraft"; Abot ii. 8 ; Singer, p. 188. Roman writers also refer to this fact ; cf. Radin, Jews among the Greeks atid Romans, p. 325. For the Talmudic references, see Blau, Das altjudische Zauberwesen, pp. 28 ff.

2 Sepphoris is identified by the Talmud (Megillah 6a) with Kitron (Judges i. 30); but it is improbable. Josephnu (Vita, § 67) places it in Galilee. It is now identified with the village of Sefuriyeh, five miles N.W. of Nazareth. 

3 M.: Assi. 

4 Which give out no light. 

5 There is a difference in the initial letter. 

6 M.: Isaac. 

7 Hence the correct spelling is 'omemot. 

8 Before pronouncing the benediction. 

9 M. omits: 'Ulla said.

1 Roman coins, the as being half the value of the other. 

2 Melozma, according to Jastrow (so also Krauss) a corruption of ***. Rashi gives it the meaning "a weight."  

3 Which was at some distance from Rab Judah's house. This was in conformity with his view in the last paragraph but one. 

4 M.: Rabbah; but the reading of edd. is preferable, because it follows on Raba's statement in this paragraph. 

5 M.: Goda. His house was near Raba's, so that the latter could use the light. 

6 M.: Habo. 

7 So as to say the benediction. 

8 We have here reflected a state of poverty where artificial light was rare in a house. See fol. 2b, p. 3 n. 6. 

9 M.: Judah b. Abin, and omits : another version, etc. According to D. S. the correct reading is Rab Iddi b. Abin. 

10 I.e. the two Schools differ. 

11 That according to Bet Hillel also, he must return to his place if he omitted Grace deliberately. 

==========================================

1 Lit. honour. 

2 I.e. although he omitted the Grace by accident, he acted according to the stricter view of Bet Shammai and was rewarded. 

3 He left his table previous to Grace deliberately having to go somewhere else, with the intention of saying it there. 

4 In the opinion of Rashi, this means a walk of four Mil for a heavy meal; but Tosafot explain four Mil for a light meal. 

5 This is meant of one who was among the diners. He must hear the Grace said in order to comply with the requirements of the law. 

6 M.: Hiyya b. Shela. 

==========================================

1 He entered the room while Grace was being said. 

2 M. omits : Rab Nahman in the name of. 

3 M.: Raba. 

4 He meant, be eager to have the privilege of saying Grace for the whole company. 

5 M. omits : Rabbah. 

6 Otherwise why did Rab and Rab Huna give such advice to their sons? 

7 M. omits the name, thus making R. Judah the Prince the author. 

8 The "common soldier" is here the one who starts the Grace, the "veteran" he who rounds it up with the responses. M. omits the second "go down." The translation would then be : The common soldiers go down to do the fighting and the officers claim the victory. 

9 In Nehem. ix. 5 which refers to those who "stand up and bless" and those who respond "Blessed be Thy glorious name." According to the Rabbis, this latter phrase was used in the Temple as the equivalent of "Amen"; cf. fol. 63 a, p. 416. 

10 Who are learning the benedictions. 

11 I.e. removing the food-stains from the hand by means of oil is an essential preliminary to the Grace. 

12 M. inserts here : R. Meir, which yields no sense. According to D. S. the probable reading is : R. Ziwai, the son-in-law of R. Meir says.

1 Lit. "the first water" — "the latter water." 

2 The Hebrew text omits "the Lord your God." There is some confusion between Lev. xi. 44 and ibid. xx. 7.
