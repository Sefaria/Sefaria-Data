2 Who bad become ritually unclean and, after bathing, waited until the evening before they could eat "of the holy things" (cf. Lev. xxii. 4-7). 

3 Whether the night is divisible into three or four watches will be discussed in the Gemara below : see pp. 6, 9 f. 

4 The majority of the Rabbis. 

5 According to Maimonides, in his Commentary on the Mishnah, this refers to the first light which becomes visible in the East, about 1 1/5 hours before actual sunrise. Cf. Pesah. 93 b. 

6 Cf. Leviticus vi. and vii. 

7 Cf. ibid. vii. 15 ff. 

8 Lit. Where does the Tanna stand that he teaches, From what time ?

1 Two deductions are drawn from the verse : (1) The law of reading the Shema' since the Israelite is commanded "to talk of them" (viz. "these words which I command thee this day") on lying down and rising up ; (2) The right order is "lying down" and "rising up," i.e. evening and morning. 

2 Hence the Jews reckon the day as commencing with the evening that precedes. See T. A. II. p. 418. 

3 See below, p. 70. 

4 In Mishnah II of this chapter, p. 55. 

5 By defining the time for reading the evening Shema' as the time when the priests partake of their Terumah, the Mishnah wishes it to be understood that the priests who have been unclean regain their privilege at sunset (when the Shema' is read) whether they bring their sin-offering or not. 

6 The Gemara requires the translation "it (the day) is clean," i.e. ended, and not "he (the man) shall be clean" from his impurity. 

7 Meaning, the fact that the sun had not set. 

===========================================================

1 I.e. the appearance of the stars. 

2 I.e. the disappearance of the sun below the horizon, but not the appearance of the stars. So Tosafot ; Rashi, less probably, refers Lev, xxii. 7 to the dawn of the eighth day. 

3 I.e. "then he shall be clean," whereas wetaher means "it (or he) is clean." 

4 The Palestinian Schools, from the geographical standpoint of Babylon. 

5 When the priests may partake of the Terumah. 

6 On account of his poverty, he cannot afford artificial light ; therefore he takes his evening meal while there is yet sufiScient light. See fol. 3 a (p. 7) for a reference to sleeping in a dark room ; and on fol. 5 b (p. 24) it is mentioned that R. Eleazar, who was very poor, was lying in a dark room. According to Lane, p. 145, Orientals have their supper "shortly after sunset." In J. T. it is mentioned that the inhabitants of villages leave the fields before nightfall for fear of wild beasts. 

7 The terminus ad quern does not agree with any of the views stated in the Mishnah.

1 The meal would be earlier on the Sabbath-eve, everything having been prepared before the advent of the Sabbath. 

2 See p. 1 n. 2. 

3 Viz. that the day ends with the appearance of the stars. 

4 M. reads : but on account of the building of the Temple they started early and worked late. 

5 "Come and hear" introduces a quotation or illustration, often with the object of refuting an argument. Its use in the present instance is as follows : According to Neh. iv. 15, the day-shift of workers laboured from "the rising of the morning" (i.e. dawn) until "the stars appeared." These two points of time may be regarded as defining the beginning and end of a day. But should it be objected that no such inference can be drawn, inasmuch as the workmen in their enthusiasm may have exceeded the normal hours of the day, the objection is met by v. 16, where it is explicitly stated "and may labour in the day." The conclusion, therefore, is that a normal day is intended in V. 15. 

6 I.e. the poor man (mentioned in the first Baraita) who has his evening meal early through lack of artificial light, and people generally (mentioned in the second) on the Sabbath-eve who have their supper early. 

7 The reasoning may be simplified by calling the meal-time of the poor man A, that of people on the Sabbath-eve B, and that of the priest for partaking of the Terumah C. In this paragraph A is assumed to equal B. If, then, A is said to equal C, then B = C. But R. Meir, who adopts B, is contrasted with the Sages who adopt C, so these cannot be identical. 

===========================================================

1 And it is agreed by all that the evening Shema' must not be read in the daytime. This question is dealt with below. 

2 R. Hannina adopts A and R. Joshua adopts C. According to the hypothesis A = C; but that cannot be, since these two Rabbis hold divergent views. 

3 The time-standards of the poor man and the priest. 

4 M. inserts: Rab Nahman b. Isaac said. 

5 There is not sufficient data in the Gemara to account for this conclusion. Tosafot note the difficulty. 

6 In Shab. 34 b R. Judah defines "twilight" thus: From the time the sun sets and so long as the sky in the East is coloured red. When the lower horizon is pale but not the upper horizon, it is still twilight; but when the upper horizon is pale like the lower, it is night. Cf. Lane, p. 74 n. 2. 

7 Should, therefore, the priest bathe about the time of twilight (according to B. Jose's view), although it is still day, it is legitimate to read the Shema' then, since it is practically night. 

===========================================================
Page: 6
---------

1 In the first Baraita quoted, R. Meir's view is that the Shema' may be read from the time people go home for their meal on the Sabbath-eve (i.e. after twilight) ; but in the second Baraita his view is from the time the priest bathes (i.e. before twilight). 

2 R. Meir's teaching is reported by two later Rabbis ; hence the discrepancy. 

3 In the Mishnah, R. Eliezer's time-standard is when the priests enter to eat the Terumah (i.e. the appearance of the stars) ; in the Baraita, it is when the Sabbath is hallowed (i.e. sunset). 

4 According to this explanation, only "until the end of the first watch" in the Mishnah are the words of R. Eliezer. 

5 The division of the day was reckoned as follows : From sunrise to sunset consisted of twelve "hours," which would be longer in Summer and shorter in Winter. The sixth hour ended at noon ; hence it is convenient to speak of the day as commencing at 6 a.m., and the night (which was similarly divided into twelve hours) at 6 p.m. "Until the end of the fourth hour" would accordingly be 10 p.m. 

6 The Romans divided the night into four vigiliae. So also Matt. xiv. 25, Mark vi. 48. 

7 The ministering angels are formed into three bands, each doing duty a part of the night. 

8 See Glossary, s.v. Baraita. 

9 "Mightily roar" is literally in the Hebrew "roaring He doth roar." Hence the word "roar" occurs three times in the verse, and is referred to the three night-watches.

2 M. : Rab Isaac b. R. Samuel b. Marta. 

3 It will be noted that the Talmud is careful to trace a teaching to its source; hence the frequent occurrence of the phrase "in the name of." Cf. Abot vi. 6 : "Whoever reports a thing in the name of him that said it brings deliverance into the world; as it is said, 'And Esther told the king in the name of Mordecai' (Esth. ii. 22)" (Singer, p. 207).

5 Elijah is frequently represented in Rabbinic Literature as appearing on earth. See A. T. II. p. 163 n. 1, and the article in J. E. v. pp. 122 ff. 

6 By "prayer" is usually, as here, meant the Eighteen Benedictions (see Glossary, s.v. Tefillah). This prayer must be said with the feet in a fixed position (see fol. 10 b, p. 65 n. 6) and without interruption.

2 For the bearing of this passage on Matt. iii. 16, see Abrahams, Studies in Pharisaism (First Series), p. 47. 

3 The original reading was probably, "Woe to Me that I have destroyed," etc. See D. S. ad loc. The alteration was made for the purpose of euphemism. 

4 This is the response in the important feature of the Synagogue Service, known as the Kaddish. Cf., e.g., Singer, p. 37, and p. 86 for the form used in the House of Study. On the Kaddish, see J. E. VII. pp. 401 ff.

3 In J. T., R. Nathan is answered: There are four watches, but the first is not counted because people are generally still awake. 

4 M. : R. Simeon b. Lakish. Bacher adopts this as correct ; see A. P. A. I. p. 131 n. 5. 

5 If by rising "at midnight" David forestalled "night-watches" (the plural signifying two), there must be four watches in the night.

1 If the day of royal personages commences with the beginning of the third hour (i.e. 8 a.m.), by rising at midnight David forestalled them by eight hours. Therefore a "watch" consists of four hours and there are three in the night. 

2 This is an alternative answer to uphold R. Nathan's view. By "watches" is not necessarily to be understood two complete periods of time. 

3 M.: R. Simeon b. Lakish. Bacher adopts this as correct; see A. P. A. I. p. 131 n. 5. 

4 To be an auditor of a discussion on Torah and not take part in it was a mark of ignorance and one incurred shame thereby. The dead, being unable to participate, although for other reasons, would thus be disgraced. The idea will not seem so fantastic in view of the belief that the corpse was conscious of what transpired in its presence. Cf. the discussion on pp. 120 ff. 

5 R.V. "at dawn"; but the Talmud wishes to give it the meaning of "evening." See the discussion in this and the following paragraphs. 

6 In place of "in the name of R. Aha," M. reads: Another version: R. Eleazar said in the name of R. Osha'ya. 

7 This is taken to be the meaning of Ps. cxix. 62, and therefore David rose before midnight. 

8 The horse was known to be a light sleeper. According to Sukkah 26 b its sleep consisted of only 60 respirations. 

9 Cf. Abot V. 23: "Judah b. Tema said : Be strong as a leopard, light as an eagle, fleet as a hart, and strong as a lion, to do the will of thy Father Who is in heaven" (Singer, p. 203).

5 Let the rich help the poor. 

6 The poor cannot remain satisfied with charitable doles, any more than a handful will satisfy a hungry lion. Moreover a nation needs external sources of supply. It cannot live on itself, just as the soil taken out of a pit will not completely fill the cavity. Others render the proverb: "A grasshopper cannot satisfy a lion ; nor can a cistern be filled by rain-water [but must also depend upon drawn water]"; cf. T. A. I. p. 419 n. 17.

1 Objects connected with the High Priest's breastplate, used as a divine oracle by means of which questions were answered. See J. E. xii. p. 384. 

2 This reading of edd. "Benaiah the son of Jehoiada" agrees with II Sam. XX. 23. The Hebrew text of Chronicles reads "Jehoiada the son of Benaiah" which is also the reading of M. here. 

3 He being the High Priest. 

4 The text of M. has been followed, which is supported by the Tosafist, Rabbenu Tam. Edd. insert "Abiathar denotes the Urim and Tummim" after the word "Sanhedrin"; and accordingly the explanation of the Kereti and Peleti is referred to the Urim and Tummim. 

5 M. adds : Why are they called Urim and Tummim ? They are called Urim because they give their answers clearly, and Tummim because they fulfil their words ; i.e. what they foretell comes to pass. This explanation is given in Joma 73 b.

4 So M. Edd. read "stained with [menstrual] blood, with foetus and placenta." In certain cases an abortive embryo would not make a woman liable to the restrictions of Lev. xii. 2 ff., and David is represented as deciding such a question as this instead of feasting. 

5 Cf. II Sam. ix. 13 where it is stated, "But Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem ; for he did eat continually at the king's table." This is the only reference to intimate relations existing between them.

1 See I Chron. iii. 1, as compared with II Sam. iii. 3. In a very interesting article in R. E. J. XXVIII. pp. 60 ff., Buchler suggests that under the guise of Biblical names (of. Dryden's Absalom and Achitophel) we have an echo of the quarrel between the Patriarch, Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel and R. Nathan and R. Meir. These two Rabbis (i.e. Mephibosheth) attempted to belittle the Halakic knowledge of Rabban Simeon (i.e. David) ; but his adversaries found more than their match in R. Judah his son (i.e. Chileab). On the quarrel, see Weiss, Dor (ed. 1904), II. p. 157. 

2 The name is explained as maklim "putting to shame" ab "a father," i.e. a teacher, Mephibosheth.

5 Therefore David was doubtful whether he deserved to be included with the righteous, so how could he describe himself as "godly "? 

6 The answer is he felt himself to be "godly," but feared that the sins he had committed would more than counterbalance the general righteousness of his life.

1 Their return depended upon the permission of Cyrus and not divine intervention. 

2 R. Eliezer's view "Until the end of the first watch" is based upon the following interpretation of "when thou liest down," viz. the Shema' is to be read about the time a person thinks of retiring to bed. Rabban Gamaliel's view, "Until the rise of dawn" follows from a different interpretation, viz. the Shema' may be read any time during the period given over to sleep. Which interpretation is adopted by the Sages ? Their view "Until midnight" seems to follow neither. It must be remembered that in the Orient, people retire to rest at a rather early hour. Lane says, "The Egyptian is a very early riser, and he retires to sleep at an early hour" (p. 137), and this may be taken to be typical of Orientals. 

3 Cf. Abot i. 1 : Make a fence round the Torah (Singer, p. 184), i.e. "impose additional restrictions so as to keep at a safe distance from forbidden ground" (Taylor, Sayings of the Fathers, in loc.). 

4 The antiquity of many a Baraita may be seen from the fact that by a labourer is usually intended an agricultural workman. Cf. also fol. 17 a, p. 111. 

5 Fortified by the thought that the Shema' may be read any time before dawn, he will put it off and in this way come to omit it altogether. 

6 The Torah as expounded in the Schools. 

===========================================================

1 Therefore the Sages deemed it necessary to emphasise the warning, because his transgression might otherwise be involuntary. 

2 This question is referred to below, fol. 27 b, p. 180. 

3 That is to say, the benediction "Blessed... Who hast redeemed Israel" (Singer, p. 99) should be immediately followed by the Eighteen Benedictions (ibid. pp. 44-54). This order is supported by the quotation "Then let him read the Shema' and say the Tefillah," as against R. Joshua b. Levi's opinion that in the evening the Shema' should follow the Tefillah. On the idea of joining the Ge'ullah and the Tefillah, see below fol. 9 b, p. 66 n. 7. 

4 I.e. between the morning and evening recital of the Shema' ; hence in the evening, the Tefillah would come first. 

5 Therefore we should have the prayers referring to the deliverance (Singer, pp. 98 f.) and then the benedictions. But R. Joshua b. Levi only regards the deliverance as having taken place after midnight; consequently R. Johanan's reason does not apply. 

===========================================================

1 The order being : leaving the bed, Shema', Tefillah; so at night the order must be reversed: Tefillah, Shema', retiring to bed. 

2 See below, p. 70. 

3 Singer, p. 99. This prayer interrupts the connection of "Who hast redeemed Israel" and the Eighteen Benedictions. The prayer, "Blessed be the Lord for evermore" (ibid. p. 100) is a later addition to the Service. See Elbogen, Der judische Gottesdienst, pp. 102 f. 

4 Lit. a long Ge'ullah. 

5 Singer, p. 44. These words might be regarded as constituting an interruption. 

6 So M. Edd. : R. Eleazar said in the name of R. Abina. 

7 Twice in the morning service and once in the afternoon. See Abrahams, p. xxxvi.

4 Lit. "being caused to fly in a flight," the word for "flying" occurring twice. This is interpreted that he covered the distance in two flights, resting in between ; whereas the verse in Isaiah speaks only of one flight. 

5 This argument is known as Gezerah Shawah, "analogy of expression." See Mielziner, pp. 142 ff., especially pp. 148 ff. where the safeguards against the exorbitant use of the argument are explained.

3 Of the Torah it is said, "And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart" (Deut. vi. 6). 

4 The Shema' was to be read "when thou liest down" (Deut. vi. 7).

===========================================================

---------
1 "Sons of Reshef" in the English version is "sparks." The ancient Jewish Aramaic version, the Targum, renders it "the sons of evil spirits." 

2 The root of this word is 'uf, "to fly." The verse is appHed to Torah: "Wilt thou cause thine eyes to fly upon it [i.e. neglect it]? It is gone [from thy mind]." 

3 The Targum here renders Reshef by "birds"; so LXX in Job v. 7. But "bitter destruction " is rendered by "attacked by evil spirits." According to a statement in Pesahim 111 b, Kefeb meriri "bitter destruction" is the name of an evil spirit which is active about the time of noon. It is probably heat personified ; cf. T. A . III. p. 346 n. 131. 

4 The teaching is explicitly inculcated in the Torah in a passage known to school-children. Why, then, derive it from obscure verses? 

5 This is what R. Simeon meant to teach, and it cannot be deduced from Exod. xv. 26. 

6 M. adds: Another version in the West: in the name of R. Abba b. Mari. This is probably an error for Raba b. Mari; cf. D.S. ad loc.

2 He rejoiced inasmuch as He "gave" it, willingly and without price. 

3 Instead of "another version : Rab Hisda," M. reads: in the name of R. Sahorah, in the name of Rab Huna. 

4 On the Rabbinic doctrine of Retribution, see Schechter, Studies in Judaism (First Series), pp. 259 ff. 

5 The work for "restitution" is asham which also means "trespass-offering." Before the asham was offered, confession had to be made (Lev. V. 5), and therefore the sacrifice was a voluntary act. Hence the inference is drawn that the sufferings are voluntarily endured. 

===========================================================

1 The preceding verses (cf. vv. 10-12) speak of sufferings. 

2 The Rabbis frequently suggest an alteration of the Scriptural text for homiletic purposes. In the present instance, a slight change in the vowels is required. See Introduction, § v. 

3 The argument here used is called Kol wahomer, lit. "light and heavy," i.e. a fortiori or a majore ad minorem. See Mielziner, pp. 130 ff. 

4 See Exod. xxi. 26 f. 

5 If God ordained that a slave should be set free whose eye or tooth had been damaged, will He not show His mercy to His creatures who suffer more than that! 

6 The verse occurs at the end of the chapter containing the penalties threatened to Israel if disobedient to the word of God.

1 The word for "instruction," musur, comes from the same root as jisur "suffering." "The way of life" is referred to the life eternal. 

2 M.: A certain Elder of the school of R. Simeon b. Johai taught. 

3 On this mode of reasoning, see p. 18 n. 5. The early death of children is declared to be due to the wrongdoing of the parents, and the pain of their bereavement brings expiation. 

4 Enumerated in Mishnah Nega'Im i. 1. 

5 A medium of expiation. 

6 Declining to draw the fine distinction between "an altar of atonement" and "chastenings of love," an alternative answer is suggested, viz. "our," i.e. the teaching of the Babylonian Schools regards plagues as "chastenings of love," because a more lenient view was taken of them than by the Palestinian Schools, to which R. Johanan belonged. In Palestine, a plague-infected person had to be isolated outside the city (cf. Lev. xiii. 46), and therefore the consequences were too severe for the plague to be regarded as "chastenings of love." 

===========================================================
Page: 24
---------

1 When the plague affects a part of the body which is normally covered by clothing, it may be regarded as "an altar of atonement"; but when in addition to discomfort there is disfigurement visible to all, the teaching of R. Johanan applies. 

2 By "bone" the commentators understand a tooth. Ten children of R. Johanan died, and he preserved a tooth of the last to show to people who had suffered bereavement, for the purpose of inducing them to evidence the same spirit of resignation as himself. Consequently it would seem that R Johanan regarded the loss of children, but not sterility, as "chastenings of love." 

3 Cured him of his ailment by the healing touch. Cf. T. A. i. p. 267.

5 R. Johanan was famed for the beauty of his person. Cf . Baba Mesia' 84 a.

1 It Abba Benjamin prayed "before his bed" in this sense, he acted contrary to the quoted teaching. The reason why it is recommended to face the wall with nothing intervening is to avoid distraction. 

2 He used the word "before" in the sense of time, not place. Immediately on rising, he offered his prayers. 

3 To avoid facing East, the direction of the Temple and of prayer. 

4 Instead of "in the name of," M. reads: Another version. 

5 It is well known that, in the Orient, males are more valued than females. Lane, p. 58, mentions that Muhammadan women often dress their boys as girls when taking them into the street so that envious glances be not cast upon them and to avert the Evil Eye. See also Frazer, Folklore of the Old Testament, I. p. 550 and T. A. II. p. 434 n. 89. 

6 The word for "treasure" is safun, and by the change of a vowel, safon, we get the meaning "North." Cf. also fol. 61 b, where it is forbidden to perform the functions of nature towards East or West, to prevent the exposure of the body in the direction of the Temple. 

7 "A Synagogue" does not occur in edd., but is added by M. 

8 "Soul" is here used in the sense of the outpouring of the soul, prayer. The commentators compare I Sam. i. 15. 

9 Synagogues in Babylon were usually situated in a field, near a river, at some distance from the town. See J. E. xi. p. 623, Schurer, II. ii. p. 69. It was because of the danger of being attacked by footpads if alone that this regulation was made.

4 On the Sabbath, expositions of Torah were given in the Synagogues and Houses of Study. The name given to such an assembly is Kallah "the bride," because "court was paid to the Torah, and fresh declarations of love and devotion and loyalty were made to her" (Schechter, Seminary Addresses, p. 54). Wunsche (p. 12 n. 2) considers that the name is connected with the Sabbath, the day on which the gathering was held, the Sabbath being frequently referred to as a bride (cf. Singer, p. Ill bot.). The word has also been connected with *** (Page:27), schola, with elision of the first letter. Other suggested explanations are given by Abrahams, p. clix. For a description of the Kallah, see J. E. I. pp. 146 f. Although the hall was not overcrowded, yet the audience would feel crushed. This was due to the evil spirits who wished to make them uncomfortable and induce people to stay away. 

5 So M. Edd. : Who wishes to know them. 

6 Orientals regard the cock as a power of darkness, possibly because it crows in the dark. Cf. Sanh. 63b where "Succoth Benoth" (II Kings xvii. 30) is identified with the hen, and "Nergal" (ibid.) with the cock. Note also the reference to the cock's comb on fol. 7 a, p. 37.

1 The prayer referred to here is not private devotion, but the statutory service which is congregational in character, Cf. fol. 7b - 8a, pp. 43 f. 

2 That "congregation" signifies at least ten is derived from Num. xiv. 27 where the word is applied to ten of the spies. A minimum of ten adult male is required to constitute a quorum for the Service in Synagogue. See Oesterley and Box, p. 340. 

3 Elohim means "God or gods" but also "judges." See Exod. xxi. 6, R.V. marg. According to Jewish law, a case was tried by at least three judges.

2 Wiesner, p. 18, finds here an attack on sun-worshippers (cf. fol. 7a, p. 37). Rab Huna, being a Babylonian, the Ark in his Synagogue would be in the West (see fol. 30 a, p. 197); therefore to pray with the back to the Synagogue would be praying towards the rising sun. Cf. Ezek. viii. 16. 

3 In place of "Elijah... Arab," M. reads: An Arab saw him. On Elijah, see p. 7 n. 5. 

4 The text has *** which Rashi explains to mean "as if there were two divine Powers." M. has *** which yields no sense. Jastrow, p. 139, rightly reads as one word *** (Page: 32).

2 "The Holy of Holies" added by M. According to the Jewish sources, he was one of the last of the High Priests and suffered martyrdom (see fol. 57 b) with Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel the Elder. He is accordingly identified by some with Ishmael b. Phabi who held the Office about 60 c.e. This identification, however, is very uncertain, and there are scholars who doubt whether there was a High Priest of that name. They think that the person referred to here is the Tanna Ishmael, who was the son of a High Priest, and that the theosophical passages where he is mentioned (see fol. 51 a) are later legendary additions to the Talmud. See A. T. i. pp. 259-263.

1 "The mighty" means the many assembled for prayer.

Consequently the privies were to be found outside the city, often at a considerable distance, which was not only a great inconvenience but a danger to health. This fact had its effect on the Halakah; and we shall find many references to it, meaningless under modern conditions, but a serious matter in ancient times.

8 In addition to hearing the recital of the weekly lection from the Pentateuch in the Synagogue, it was a pious act to read through the Parashah at home, twice in the original and once in the Aramaic translation, the Targum.

1 The continuation of the Mishnah is "but wherever the Sages use the expression 'Until midniglit,' the obligation continues until the rise of dawn." Since Rabban Gamaliel holds that the obligation continues until the rise of dawn, it might be supposed that he also teaches "until midnight." 

2 To which the same law applies. 

3 I.e. until the time of hastening out of Egypt, viz. dawn; cf. "And none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning" (Exod. xii. 22). Therefore R. 'Akiba rejects the other's argument which makes "in that night" mean "until midnight."

4 See Mishnah Zebahim, v. 8 (Singer, p. 13), and for the peace offering, ibid. § 7. 

5 How does he know that the Paschal offering may not be eaten two nights and a day? He cannot derive it from "in that night," since he has used the phrase for the purpose of drawing the analogy.

8 The point of variance between R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah and B. 'Akiba also divides R. Eliezer and R. Joshua.

7 Therefore R. Johanan's teaching cannot apply to the evening Tefilluh, because "O Lord, open Thou my lips" would constitute an interruption. The importance which this Rabbi attached to uniting the two prayers in the evening is accounted for by Elbogen (J. Q. R. xix. pp. 711 ff.) on the theory that it was intended to abolish the custom of introducing prayers of a personal nature after the Shema' which was likely to destroy the congregational character of the Service. Cf. fol. 31a, p. 206.

1 This is a reference to II Ghron. xxx. 2 where it is mentioned that he observed the Passover in the second month. According to the Talmud, he had made a mistake in intercalation. The Hebrew month is lunar and lasts 29 or 30 days. Whether the 30th day was to be regarded as the last day of the month or the first of the new month depended upon observation of the New Moon (cf. Lane, p. 478). For the purpose of periodically adjusting the lunar and solar year (so that, e.g., the Passover which must be observed in the Spring should not occur in the Summer), an extra month was intercalated between Adar and Nisan seven times in nineteen years. On the Jewish Calendar, see J. E. III. p. 498, Oesterley and Box, pp. 346 ff. 

2 I.e. the month having once been proclaimed Nisan, it cannot be intercalated. 

3 By "Samuel" is meant the Amora of that name. He taught that if the year is to be intercalated, it must be announced before the 30th of Addr, since witnesses might come to testify that the New Moon had been observed on that day, and it would accordingly be reckoned as the 1st of Nisan. Hezekiah, however, thought that the 30th of Adar could never be reckoned as the 1st of Nisan. He therefore intercalated the year on that day, which afterwards proved to be the New Moon, with the consequence that he observed the Passover in the second month instead of in the first.

1 E.g. two blessings have to precede the recital of the Shema'. If the first were said but the second omitted, then the omission of the second does not invalidate the first. All that R. Zerika said was that the practice of the priests in the Temple illustrated this principle ; and from this statement the conclusion was drawn that the benediction recited was "Who formest light." 

2 This Service in the Temple was before daybreak. 

3 Why was Rab Isaac b. Joseph so careful to mention that R. Zerika's opinion depended only on an inference and not explicit teaching? 

4 Not the omission of a benediction; i.e. the principle "The benedictions do not invalidate one another" might have been taken to mean that the saying of "With abounding love" first (for the reason that it was not yet daybreak) followed by "Who formest light" was not invalidated because of the inverse order. But this inference would be incorrect.

5 Instead of concluding "Blessed... Creator of the luminaries" (Singer, p. 39) he wrongly says the formula of the evening prayer (ibid. p. 96). 

6 He wrongly commenced with the evening prayer, and when about to conclude it notices the error and ends it with the correct formula. 

7 The benediction is correct but the conclusion wrong. 

===========================================================
Page: 75
---------
1 The benediction is wrong but the conclusion correct. 

2 Are we, by analogy, to apply this rule to the instance of wine and beer? 

3 The addition of "Blessed art Thou, O Lord" constitutes what follows a complete benediction in itself, quite irrespective of what precedes. For that reason, although the main theme was wrong, so long as the concluding benediction is correct, the requirement of the law has been fulfilled. The instance of wine and beer is different, because he began the benediction for wine and in the middle noticed the error, but the words which followed did not constitute a complete benediction. 

4 The formula "Blessed... Creator of the luminaries" contains the divine Name and is, according to Rab, a complete benediction. But according to R. Johanan who requires the inclusion of the words "King of the universe," how can it be considered a complete benediction ? 

5 See fol. 11b, p. 70. 

6 The morning prayer opens "Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, Who formest light and createst darkness" (Singer, p. 37); the evening prayer "Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe... Thou rollest away the light from before the darkness" (ibid. p. 96). In either case his benediction refers to the Kingship and can apply to either "light" or "darkness," since both are mentioned. Therefore the objection raised on the score of R. Johanan's requirement is not valid. 

7 The instance of wine and beer. 

===========================================================

1 The instance quoted is parallel to that of wine and beer; and if the "general rule" includes the former, why not the latter? 

2 The benediction after eating bread contains "Since Thou nourishest and sustainest all beings... Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who givest food unto all" (Singer, p. 280) ; this would appropriately apply also to dates. 

3 M. : Raba b. Hannina ; another variant is : Rabbah b. Hannina. See D. S. ad loc. 

4 Singer, pp. 42, 98. 

5 The morning prayer refers to God's lovingkindness, the evening prayer to His faithfulness in fulfilling His promises. 

6 The regulation is to bow four times : at the beginning and end of the first benediction (Singer, p. 44), "We give thanks unto Thee" (p. 51), "Blessed... Whose name is all-good" (p. 53). 

7 Therefore one should stand erect on mentioning His name. 

8 Therefore he should still be bent on mentioning His name. 

9 I.e. When the Name is mentioned, one should be bowed? 

10 With one sharp bend of the body, but he raised himself gradually and painfully.

3 In I Sam. xxviii. 6 it is stated, "The Lord answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets." Saul omitted to mention the Urim because the oracle was worked through the priests, and he had smitten their city (ibid. xxii. 19). This is evidence of shame for his crime. 

4 These words do not occur in the Bible text and are omitted in M. 

5 I.e. my division in Heaven — evidence of Saul's sins having been forgiven. 

6 These words were spoken by the Gibeonites who wished to vent their hatred on Saul's house ; they would accordingly not have referred to Saul as "the chosen of the Lord." The Rabbis therefore explain that these words were uttered by a Bat Kol; and if he was proclaimed "the chosen of the Lord," that is evidence that he had received forgiveness.

1 That would seem to be implied in the statement "if he directed his heart"; but elsewhere in the Talmud it is stated that Kawwanah is not required. See Rosh Hash. 28 a. 

2 How can it be maintained that "if he directed his heart" means to study and not to prayer, since the Mishnah opens with the statement that he was studying?

1 If Rabbi were of opinion that the Torah can only be read in Hebrew, it would necessarily apply to the Shema'. Why, then, should he draw a conclusion from "And these words shall be"? His opinion must therefore be that the Torah can be read in any language ; and he draws the conclusion from "And these words shall be" that the Shema' must be read in Hebrew to oppose the inference which the Sages drew from "Hear, O Israel."

8 A voluntary fast is here meant. On a statutory fast there is no question that tasting (e.g. food that is being cooked) is forbidden. 

9 According to one interpretation, the Tefillah is here intended; otherwise it is contradicted by the passage quoted by Rab Sheshet from the Mishnah, which permits one to offer greeting between the sections of the Shema' — which is recited before the Tefillah. But R. Abba interprets the phrase "before he prays" quite generally. 

10 On the Bamah was offered what should have been brought to the Temple. Similarly to greet a man before praying is to give him what is due to God. 

11 To pay him honour instead of God.

5 To greet him, intentionally paying him the first honour. Should he meet him casually, he may salute him prior to praying. 

6 Exception was taken to the exaggeration in applying the word Bamah to such a case. The reply is that to attend to one's personal affairs before offering prayer in the morning is as prohibited as the erection of a Bamah. 

7 The verse is made to refer to man, not God. "Righteousness" is understood as the morning devotions. 

8 To be vouchsafed a dream was considered evidence of spiritual grace (cf. Joel iii. 1), and to be without a dream was accordingly deemed to be the consequence of gross, materialistic living. 

9 Translating thus : He who abides seven [nights] without being visited [by a dream] is evil. 

10 So M. correctly. Edd.: Aha.

1 Between the end of the third paragraph of the Shema' and the beginning of the benediction which follows; Singer, p. 42. 

2 It is customary to conclude the Shema', not with the word "God," but with "true" borrowed from the next paragraph. Has the word "true" to be repeated when continuing the prayer ? 

3 M.: "Raba," and so to the end of the paragraph. 

4 "To descend" (or "to pass" so. before the Ark) means to act as Precentor. On "descending," see p. 65 n. 5. 

5 I.e. they say the opening and closing words of the third paragraph of the Shema', leaving out all in between, because it refers to the law of "Fringes" which does not apply at night. 

6 Since nothing has been mentioned about the "Fringes" — the theme of the paragraph — one cannot be regarded as having commenced it.

1 To read the Shema' before patting on the Tefillin. From the following discussion it will be seen that this was not Rab's regular practice, but he did so on one occasion. 

2 Edd. add *** "in a grave," which is probably a gloss. M. reads *** "in a wall" i.e. of a cave or vault, where graves were often excavated. See J.E. III. p. 437, T.A. II. pp. 72 ff.

4 Engaged in digging; in which case one continues the work, while the other offers his prayers. 

5 This Rabbi's statement in the Mishnah is interpreted to mean that first the Shema' must be read and then the Tefillin laid. 

6 M. adds : "to study the Chapters of the Sifra debe Rab" as on fol. 11b, p. 71. 

7 Prior to studying Torah. 

====================================================
Page 94
--------
1 Rab Hiyya b. Ashe's statement has no bearing on the question under discussion. It was quoted to prove that Rab uttered a benediction before lecturing on Mishnah. In fact, this Rabbi's statement quoted in fol. 11 b, does not mention "laid Tefillin and after that read the Shema'." 

2 He delayed in bringing the Tefillin for which he had been sent. Rab, fearing that the correct time for reading the Shema' would pass before he arrived, on that occasion read it and afterwards laid the Tefillin. 

3 An euphemism for "against God." He declares the Unity of God (by reading the Shema') without adducing the evidence as proclaimed by the Tefillin. Rev. A. Newman writes : "Against himself" may be taken literally. The Shema' which he is reading enjoins the wearing of Tefillin ; therefore the recital without the phylacteries involves an inconsistency. His acts belie bis words. 

4 M. : Rabbah b. Bar Hannah said in the name of R. Johanan. 

5 "The cleansing here has nothing to do with priestly ablution; it means simply to prepare oneself in such a way as to be able to concentrate all one's mind during the prayer without any disturbance"; Schechter, Aspect of Rabbinic Theology, p. 66 n. 1. On the practice of the Essenes, see Schurer, n. ii. p. 199. 

6 So M. correctly; edd. Raba. Cf. Hyman, II. p. 437 a.

8 Implying that he is totally clean.

2 There is a similar law among the Muhammadans : "But if... ye find no water, take fine clean sand and rub your faces and your hands therewith"; Koran iv. 46, v. 9; Lane, p. 72. 

3 M.: "At the time of the reading of the Shema'." He feared that the right time would pass during the search for water. 

4 The time for Tefillah is not so strictly defined. 

5 Some authorities insert here : "These are the words of R. Judah." 

6 Who allows it to be read inaudibly, how does he explain "Hear"? See fol 13 a, p. 83. 

====================================================
Page 96
--------

1 Because the act was accompanied by the saying of a benediction which the deaf man would not be able to hear. 

2 In Rabbinic law a distinction is often drawn between the validity of an act which one contemplates doing and its validity after it has been performed; and it is sometimes decided that though the former (*** "as at the beginning," ab initio) is illegitimate, nevertheless the accomplished fact *** = *** "that which has been done," post factum) may be considered as complying with the requirements of the law. See Mielziner, p. 197 ; Bacher, Terminologie, ii. p. 232. 

3 Omitted by M. in conformity with the wording of the Mishnah. 

4 R. Jose's objection to inaudibility does not apply to the benediction of Terumah, because it is not so essential a feature of the act, that without it the whole would be illegitimate. 

5 This is the equivalent of "who has read"; therefore the first Tanna (i.e. R. Judah) agrees with the Mishnah about Terumah, not R. Jose. 

====================================================
Page 97
--------
1 Because the Grace after meals is a Pentateuchal ordinance (see fol. 21a, p. 135), and therefore parallel to the case of the Shema' where R. Jose does not admit as valid even the post factum reading, if inaudible. 

2 No contradiction in R. Judah agreeing with R. Judah the son of R. Simeon b. Pazzi, although in the matter of the inaudible Grace after meals it was concluded that he allows it only post factum. 

3 That even ab initio it is permissible for a deaf man to separate Terumah. 

4 That only post factum is the inaudible Grace after meals valid. 

5 So M.; not "there is a Mishnaic teaching" as in edd. 

6 Not on their audibility. 

7 As to introduce R. Meir's teaching into the discussion. 

8 The teaching of R. Judah the son of R. Simeon b. Pazzi, viz. the deaf person may separate the Terumah ab initio, is in agreement with R. Meir's view that the Shema' may be read inaudibly ab initio. 

9 R. Judah's view that the act of the deaf person is only allowed post factum agrees with the statement of his teacher, R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah, that post factum only is the inaudible reading of the Shema' permissible.

5 Referring to the Sadducees ; cf . Schurer, II. ii. p. 38.

1 With these alterations the verse reads, "When one utters the name of the Almighty distinctly in the prayer where the King [majestic plural] is [i.e. which contains a reference to the Kingdom of Heaven, viz. the Shema'], it snoweth in the shadow of death." The words melakim bah "kings therein" have been connected, with more ingenuity than probability, by Schorr (quoted in Goldschmidt) with *** and ***, making the first clause mean: When one utters the name of the Almighty distinctly, reading the words of similar sound plainly. 

2 The word *** may be pointed to mean "aloes" (so R.V. here) or "tents." In the preceding verse, "thy tents" has the same letters ; they are consequently given the same meaning here. By "tents" the Rabbis frequently understand "houses of study"; e.g. "And Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents" (Gen. xxv. 27) is explained (cf. the Targum): attending schools of learning.

3 A Kohen (see Glossary, s.v.) has the privilege to "raise his hands" in the course of the Service to pronounce the priestly benediction (Num. vi. 24-26) ; but if a labourer, he must not do so.

Rashi renders; "They administered them to one who was like themselves," i.e. despising Shemayah and Abtalion on the ground that they were not of pure Jewish stock. According to Gittin 57b they were descendants of Sennacherib, king of Assyria.

appealed in time of drought to pray for rain. He thereupon drew a circle and declared he would not step outside it until God had sent rain. See Ta'anit 23 a. It has been suggested that the original meaning of Honi's name is not "circle-drawer" (which later legend gave it) but "roof-tiler," his occupation. Cf. T. A. I. p. 325 n. 381. The name Honi is more familiar in its Greek form "Onias."

3 According to M. the subject is "the Sages." Some edd. make the subject Simeon b. Shetah : but this would be an anachronism. See A.T. ii. p. 561 n. 1. 

4 Here, then, is another instance of arrogance against the Most High, 
since Theodosius altered the law. 

5 A portable earthenware oven is like an earthenware vessel and can contract defilement. In the latter instance, the vessel cannot be purified and must be broken to pieces. In the opinion of the Sages, the same rule applies to the oven. R. Eliezer allows the oven to be cut horizontally into layers and sand placed in between and cemented over. 

6 Krauss, p. 251, thinks that the word translated "serpent" is really a proper name, 'E ***, after whom that sort of oven was called. See his discussion in Part I of Lehnworter, pp. 295 f.

5 Hence out of deference for a human being, they disregard an ordinance of the Torah. 

6 A Bet Peras is a field, half a furrow in length and breadth, on to which crushed bones may have been carried by a plough which had passed over a grave. Contact with even a fragment of a bone would cause defilement. Peras is of doubtful etymology. It is explained by some to mean "half"; cf. Dan. v. 28. Wiesner, p. 49, connects it with ***, because the corpse was usually first burnt. See also T. A.II. p. 490 n. 550. 

7 Therefore the deference they show to the mourner does not involve disregard of the Torah.

2 M.: Rabbah. 

3 They misunderstood him. He meant the only prohibition of the Torah set aside is that implied in the verse quoted, which teaches that the ordinances of the religious leaders of the age must be adhered to. Consequently, in actual practice, it is only Rabbinical injunctions which are set aside by the honouring of one's fellow-creatures. 

4 They allow their authority, though it is based on the Torah, to be set aside for this purpose. 

5 In the Hebrew, the negative "not" is attached to the verb "see" and has to be understood with "and bide thyself." According to the Rabbinic interpretation, since there is no negative qualifying "and hide thyself," it is to be deduced that there are times when one may not restore a straying animal. 

==================================================

1 Who is forbidden contact with the dead. 

2 I.e. his loss in restoring the animal would be greater than the owner's if it were not restored. M. reads "his loss" instead of "his work." 

3 Why should the Elder consider his dignity before the performance of a duty? 

4 The Torah expressly makes such an allowance. 

5 By analogy that one need not take off a garment in the street if diverse kinds are foand in it out of self-respect (seeing that the Elder is permitted to consider his dignity), but wait until be reaches his home. 

6 The matter of the straying animal involves nothing more than the owner's loss; it is consequently of less seriousness than a matter involving a principle. 

7 A Nazirite may not make himself ritually unclean by contact with the dead. The list of relations is: father, mother, brother, sister; and the Halakic commentary on Numbers and Deuteronomy, the Sifre, discusses the reason why each is mentioned : He may not defile himself for his father, but he must for a Met Miswah (see Glossary, s.v.); nor for his mother, but even if he be a Kohen as well as a Nazirite (i.e. doubly prohibited against such contact), he must defile himself for a Met Miswah ; nor for his brother, but even if he be the High Priest as well as a Nazirite, he must defile himself for a Met Miswah. The explanation of "his sister" is given in the Gemara.

1 The duty of burial is to show respect to the body; why should respect for a person set aside the Pentateuchal prohibition against defilement? 

2 And (according to the Rabbinic deduction above) the Torah gives him permission. 

3 No analogy can be drawn between the wearing of mixed stuff and the burial of a Met Miswah, because they fall into different categories. The former is a prohibition as an act — one has to "arise and do" [*** ***] it (by putting on the garment), to commit the transgression. With the Met Miswah, on the other hand, it is the omission to bury which constitutes the transgression. To "sit and do nothing " [*** *** ***] is what is forbidden.

1 There is a double play of words. Matun means "deliberate"; hence if he had not been hasty, it would have saved him 400 Zuz. Matun also resembles the word for "two hundred," which being repeated, totals 400.

3 The law of Tefillin (Deut. vi. 8) is immediately followed by the law of Mezuzah (ibid. v. 9) ; the inference might therefore be drawn that they are identical in scope of obligation.

5 Therefore being able to say it individually, Rab Huna allows him up to "We give thanks unto Thee" in which to say the Tefillah.

1 Why is it specially mentioned of them that they shall be stoned? Cf. Lev. XX. 27. 

2 This is an illustration of the eighth of R. Ishmael's exegetical principles by which the Torah is expounded : If anything is included in a general proposition [diviners are in the category of sorcerers] and is then made the subject of a special statement [as in Lev. xx. 27], that which is predicated of it [viz. death by stoning] is not to be understood as limited to itself alone, but is to be applied to the whole of the general proposition ; Singer, pp. 13 f. It is hereby shown that R. Judah rejected the inference from juxtaposition and based his conclusion upon this rule. 

3 M. more accurately : For there is a Mishnaic teaching. What follows is from Mishnah Jebamot xi. 1. 

4 Why, then, does not R. Judah accept the deduction from Deut. iv. 9 f . above that a Ba'al Keri is forbidden to study Torah?

3 The fear lest they will fall might disturb his ability to concentrate his mind on his prayer. Blau, Das altjudische Zauberwesen, p. 150 n. 7, suggests a different reason for the origin of this law. It is an allusion to a superstitious practice whereby these sacred objects were held in the hand as amulets while reciting incantations. Similarly, passages from the New Testament were used as charms by Christians ; see Grenfell and Hunt, Oxyrhyncus Papyri, Part viii.

6 See above, fol. 23a, p. 150. 

7 Since it is solely for the purpose of urinating, it is assumed that the Baraita refers to an occasional privy. 

8 These words are added by M. and are quoted in the Gemara below.

5 For a man to uncover in front and a woman behind, and there is no argument a fortiori here at all. Consequently we cannot find anything to which the quoted statement "What I have permitted thee" etc. can be made to refer except the Tefillin. 

6 Bet Hillel permit the former (see fol. 23a, p. 150), but according to the result of the reasoning in the former paragraph, they forbid the latter !

1 As follows: An occasional privy is not to be treated as strictly as a regular one; if then we are permitted to hold the Tefillin in the latter, how much more so in the former! This is irrefutable as an argument, but it nevertheless leads to a wrong conclusion. We have consequently to base our position on the practical consideration of the possibility of soiling the hand.

8 Throughout this discussion it must be remembered that in the Orient it was the general custom in the Summer to sleep quite naked; cf. Lane, p. 158. Even in the Winter people often slept naked because of lack of clothing. See p. 157 n. 1. 

==================================================
Page 156
----------

1 By using the word "even," Samuel implied that the more lenient view is to be taken when he is with somebody else. Rab Joseph retorts that the more lenient view is to be taken when his wife is with him, because she is to be considered part of himself. 

2 Since he holds that his wife is part of himself, he does not require a sheet between them, but with others he does. 

3 For he said "Even if his wife is with him." If, therefore, he does not require a sheet with her, he cannot require one with somebody else. 

4 According to Rashi, "members of his household" must here be understood to include his wife. Later commentators (see Tosafot) reject this, and correct the text to read "with his wife, he may not turn away and read the Shema' unless there is a garment separating between them." 

5 I.e. the dispute between Samuel and Rab Joseph goes back to the days of the Tannaim, and there are Baraitot (irreconcilable with each other) to be quoted in support of both opinions. 

6 Although the posterior parts are exposed; thus supporting Rab Huna's view.

1 So that even the posteriors are covered; consequently the Mishnah offers no support to Rab Huna. Buchler, Der galilaische 'Am ha'ares, p. 252 n. 1, points out that the circumstance here debated is not far-fetched and imaginary ; but the extreme poverty into which a section of the people had sunk, so that some of them had actually no clothing, made it a question of practical importance. See also T. A. I. pp. 134 ff. 

2 M. : Rafram b. Pappa said in the name of Rab Hisda.

His conclusion is, "The Doreshe Hamurot were, therefore, those allegoristic interpreters of the law whose method and tendency were to find the importance and significance of the law, its real meaning and purpose, since it is this, the real meaning and purpose, that gave the law weight and importance ; and they considered the importance and significance of the law, its homer, to lie, not in the plain meaning of the letter of the law, but in the spirit of the law and its allegorical meaning, which they would read into it"; ibid. p. 509.

2 The cases are not analogous ; he must remove himself from the odour before reading the Shema'. 

3 E.g. a leper. 

4 According to Abbai, this is analogous to the quoted Baraita ; so if the passing leper does not cause defilement, the passing manure should not interfere with the reading of the Shema'. 

5 Cf. Lev. xiv. 37 ff. If the stone is carried past a man, he is not infected ; if it is set down where he is, he does contract defilement. 

6 What reply can he make to the reasoning upon which Abbai bases his view? 

7 The analogy is false, because the quoted Mishnah only means to teach that the leper defiles any place where he stands for a while, which thus becomes temporarily his "dwelling."

8 That R. Jose b. R. Hannina agrees that a basis was subsequently found in the sacrifices. 

9 Does it mean until the beginning of, or the end of, the fourth hour? 

10 The Rabbis permit the afternoon Tefillah to be read until the evening ; R. Judah until the middle of the afternoon. But if "until" here means "until the end of," his terminus ad quem would be identical with that of the Rabbis 

==================================================
Page 176
----------
1 It is a principle of the Jewish ritual that what is constant takes precedence of what is not. The afternoon Tefillah is to be said daily, whereas the additional only on special occasions. 

2 Assuming that "until" means excluding, then according to R. Judah the additional Tefillah may be said until noon. But that of the afternoon only commences at 12.30 p.m. ; how, then, could the two Tefillot clash? 

3 This conclusion contradicts that arrived at in the preceding paragraph. 

4 See p. 175 n. 10. 

5 I.e. when R. Judah declares the afternoon Tefillah maybe read until the middle of the afternoon, be gives "until" the inclusive meaning; but be refers to the first half, which is 4.45. Up to that time he permits it, whereas the Rabbis allow it to be read the whole afternoon. Hence it is shown that although "until" means including, the opinions of R. Judah and the Rabbis differ. 

6 M. adds : b. Isaac. 

7 That "until" means including.

3 The wine of the drink-offering must be at least forty days old, otherwise it is not called "strong drink" as required by Num. xxviii. 7. 

4 This is in agreement with R. Judah's view that tbe morning Tefillah may be said until the fourth hour. 

5 Lit. "selected" — the name given to the Tractate 'Eduyyot in the fourth Order of the Mishnah, containing a collection of legal decisions and opinions of ancient Tannaim. 

6 A distinction is drawn between tbe phrases "heat of the day" and "heat of the sun." The latter means the places in the sun are hot but those shaded cool; whereas "heat of the day" means that the heat is general, as at noon. "Heat of the sun" refers to the fourth hour, because before 10 a.m. even the sunny places are not excessively hot. 

7 But although tbe Israelites were commanded to gather the manna "morning by morning," which according to R. Judah means up to 10 a.m., by that time it had already melted. The gathering had therefore to be done in the third hour. 

8 They understood "morning by morning" to mean half the morning was for gathering the manna ; and since they consider the morning to be from 6 a.m. to noon, this would mean in the first three hours and the other half would be for melting.

9 There is confusion between Johanan, i.e. John Hyrcanus, and Jannaeus (=Jonathan, see Derenbourg, op. cit. p. 95 n.), i.e. Alexander Jannaeus. The former was at first favourably disposed towards the Pharisees, but in the latter part of his life opposed them (Schurer, i.i. pp. 288f.) ; but the latter was throughout his reign hostile to them and massacred numbers of them ; ibid. pp. 300 ff.

==================================================

1 I.e. he said the morning Tefillah twice, and not the additional. 

2 R. Johanan was a very eminent Rabbi, and he clearly intended to imply that R. Jannai did say the additional Tefillah. 

3 See p. 46. 

4 I.e. they read the additional Tefillah privately although there were several local Congregations. 

5 Rashi comments : i.e. Rab. Although Rab is usually referred to in this way, here Rabbi must be intended ; cf. Hyman, ii. p. 785. 

6 It does not refer here to the additional. 

7 See Singer, p. 50. 

8 If he omitted the reference when praying with the Congregation, he does not repeat the Tefillah because he will hear it said by the Precentor. Some explain that it refers to the Precentor himself, who does not repeat the Tefillah if he omitted tbe reference, so as not to trouble the Congregation. In view of this teaching, R. Hiyya b. Abba, since he was not praying with a Congregation, was right in repeating the Tefillah. 

9 If he has to say two.

1 The month is "full" when it has 30 days, "defective" when it has 29. When the moon is "full," two days (the concluding day of the old and the first of the new) are observed, and the extra prayer said on both. Therefore if he omitted it one evening, he can say it the next.

1 I have adopted the reading of M. *** (page:209) "dark," i.e. ugly, which offers the contrast to "ruddy," i.e. handsome. Edd. read *** (page:209) which means "a mute." Rashi explains it as "corpulent," but the word never seems to have that meaning. Some edd. add after it : nor blind. 

2 The ground for this inference is not clear. The explanation offered by the commentators (see Tosafot) is as follows: The word "by thee" *** (page:209) is spelt with a redundant letter *** (page:209) which has the numerical value of five. Hence it is taken to mean "I was within five [cubits] of thee," because one is not allowed to sit within four cubits of one who prays.

2 Seventy years is the normal span of human life (Ps. xc. 10) and this will be shortened if one spoils "the day of delight" by fasting. Rashi explains differently in a favourable sense : If one adds to the severity of his fast by choosing the Sabbath day, then should there be a divine decree to his detriment, though it be incurred in extreme youth (seventy years ago), it will be annulled.

2 R.V. "Yet will I not forget thee," but the word "I" is emphasized in the Hebrew. Hence it is taken to refer to the incident at Sinai when God declared "I am the Lord thy God" (Exod. xx. 2). That will not be forgotten by Him.

10 According to J. T. R. Hannina was saying the Tefillah when the lizard bit him. His disciples asked him whether he had been injured, but he replied that he had felt nothing. They found the lizard dead ; and the Rabbi's escape was accounted for by the assertion that when a lizard bites a man, if the man reaches water first, the lizard dies ; but if the lizard gets there first, the man dies. In Hannina's case, a spring of water miraculously opened at his feet, which sealed the fate of the lizard.

CHAPTER VI 

MISHNAH I 
[[fol. 86 a.]]

Page : 233
----------

1 That a benediction is necessary. 

2 The word is in the plural, and being unspecified is considered to mean two. There must accordingly be two praises (i.e. benedictions), one before and one after. 

3 The fruit grown in the fourth year, of which Lev. xix. 24 speaks. That fruit is declared to be "holy" and may not be eaten, unless previously redeemed. 

4 This will be explained as referring only to the fruit of the vineyard. Since these two teachings are drawn from the use of the plural hillullm, it cannot mean that a benediction is necessary before and after partaking of fruits. 

===================================================

Page : 234
----------
1 Only when a drink-offering was brought did the choir of the Levites sing in the Temple ; and in this way the wine "cheered" God. 

2 That hillulim refers to the benediction before and after fruits. 

3 That Lev. xix. 24 refers to all fruit of the fourth year and not to the vine only; consequently the second deduction from hillulim need not be used to prove that only the vine requires redemption, but can be used to show that a benediction is required when partaking of fruits. 

4 Since the second deduction from hillulim is required to prove that only the vine required redemption, how does he show that a benediction is required when partaking of fruits? 

5 That the second hillul can also show that the benediction is required over fruits. 

6 See p. 18 n. 5. 

7 Cf. Deut. viii. 10. 

8 And he is about to satisfy his hunger. 

9 The reasoning in the preceding paragraph is based on the assumption that Lev. xix. 24 refers to a vineyard. 

===================================================

Page : 235
----------

1 Cf. Lev. xix. 10. Since the gleanings have to be left behind, he must say a benediction over what he enjoys of the vineyard ; but the law of gleanings does not apply to other fruits, therefore the inference just drawn is not valid. 

2 The law of gleanings does not apply to corn ; and yet a benediction is necessary over bread. 

3 It is not, because Hallah does not apply to the vineyard, and yet the latter requires a benediction. 

4 The objections having been disposed of. 

5 Viz. gleanings and Hallah. 

6 That they are both enjoyed. 

7 In the drink-offering and meal-offering ; hence other fruits do not come in the same category for the purpose of the benediction. 

8 Lit. "vineyard of olives." Since the olive is included because kerem is mentioned in connection therewith, the objection that the common factor is the altar lapses. 

9 Cf. Deut. viii. 8. 

===================================================

Page : 236
----------

1 From the common use of "land" in Deut. viii. 8 and ibid: xxvi. 2 it is deduced that the law of first-fruit applies only to the "seven species" (see Menahot 84 b). Therefore the necessity for a benediction with things outside this category has still to be proved. 

2 This statement not only answers the question about things which are not planted, but also the question about the factor of "first-fruit" in connection with the seven species. 

3 The word used here, ma'al, refers to the offence of utilising property belonging to the Temple by a non-priest. The Universe is regarded as the Divine Temple; but by virtue of the benediction, one becomes consecrated and permitted to partake of its produce. 

===================================================

Page : 237
----------

1 By omitting to pay to Ood the benediction due to Him, he withholds the divine blessing from Israel and the fields will not be fruitful. 

2 I.e. taken literally, and consequently no time be devoted to earning a livelihood. 

3 And in addition find leisure for Torah.

1 Viz. they combined Torah with work. Cf. Abot ii. 2 ; Singer, p. 187. 

2 The first and seventh months of the year, corresponding with March — April and September — October, the time of the ripening of corn and the pressing of grapes. By devoting these two months to work, the remainder of the year could safely be given to Torah. Raba accordingly agreed with R. Ishmael. 

3 M. omits: in the name of, etc. 

4 See Krauss, p. 271, on the word. The meaning is : They bring it straight into the house.

----------
1 There is no special name in Hebrew for the olive-tree as there is for the vine. 

2 This point remaining unanswered, the Gemara proceeds to discover other reasons why wine should have a special benediction. 

3 Viz. wheat, barley, rye, oats and spelt. Rab and Samuel would restrict the term "food," without further qualification, only to these and not, e.g., to oil. 

4 The word "food" in the quoted Mishnah is not used in the technical sense Rab and Samuel would give it, but means anything that nourishes. Since water and salt are alone excluded from this category, oil must be included. 

5 After wine as after bread, i.e. the full Grace after meals; see fol. 37a, p. 250. 

6 Therefore, it cannot be regarded as food, and only one benediction is necessary. 

7 M. omits: b. Isaac. 

8 Would three benedictions be necessary? 

9 Who will solve all problems left in doubt. 

10 Viz. to fix a meal on account of wine. 

===================================================

Page : 240
----------
1 I.e. how is it necessary to have a benediction for oil? 

2 In which case no benediction is required. 

3 See Lev. xxii. 14 according to which the man pays the additional fifth "if he eat of the holy thing," i.e. is nourished thereby. But oil has no beneficial effect on the body, therefore he pays only the value. 

4 Enigaron, a corruption of ***, a sauce of oil and garum. See Krauss, p. 72. 

5 M. : Rab Judah said in the name of Samuel. The words in round brackets are a gloss to explain the Greek terms. 

6 When it is said oil requires a benediction. 

7 And uses oil as a remedy. 

8 That one may swallow oil added to an elaiogaron on the Sabbath ; so why is it mentioned ? 

9 The fact that it is permitted on the Sabbath proves that legally it is something to be enjoyed, the healing property being only incidental. And further, since the mixture is taken because of the oil, this is the principal 

===================================================

Page : 241
----------
1 The point at issue is whether the grinding of the corn into flour alters its nature for the purpose of the benediction. Rab Judah maintains it does not. 

2 By being pressed from the olive. 

3 And there is no change in the benediction. 

4 And the benediction should be "...Who createst the fruit of the ground." 

5 If not, why is barley-flour specified? 

6 Which is inferior to wheaten-flour. 

7 That one could imagine barley-flour requires no benediction, whereas salt or brine does ! 

8 Edd. read incorrectly: A Mishnaic teaching. The quotation is a Baraita; cf. fol. 40 b, p. 268. 

9 To specify barley-flour above, despite this objection.

1 "A white, meaty, sweet and tasty substance" in the young palm ; Low, Aramaische Pflanzennamen, p. 116. 

2 If not extracted while the palm is young, it become part of the tree. 

3 Bacher, A.B. A., p. 51 n. 27 declares that the rendering "Thou keen-witted one" is not beyond dispute, and the expression may refer to his iron endurance in study. 

4 There can be no comparison of the two. 

5 When the heart is extracted, the palm withers; therefore it does not bear the same relation to its tree as other fruit does. 

6 M. adds: " ...Who createst the fruit of the ground." 

7 So Low, op. cit. p. 264. Jastrow translates "caper-flowers." Rashi explains "husks." 

8 From this it is seen that "Who createst the fruit of the ground" is said over the leaves and shoots although the caper is not grown to obtain these; why, then, should that formula not be used for the palm-heart although the palm is not planted for the sake of the heart ?

1 And for that reason may not be eaten when in a state of 'Orlah. 

2 Hence the buds are regarded as fruit. 

3 I.e. Rab, whose name M. includes in the text. 

4 M.: Eleazar, incorrectly. 

5 And the buds are not fruit.
 
6 If R. 'Akiba's view is the correct one. 

7 As R. 'Akiba does. 

8 That one may eat the buds oatside the Land even when in a state of 'Orlah. 

9 I.e. in a state of 'Orlah. 

10 That the tithe is only to be given of the caper-berries, and not the bads.

1 If it were a fruit, it would not constitute Kila'im. 

2 Because vegetables are not subject to 'Orlah. 

3 As to the category of the caper-bush. 

4 And declare it Kila'im in a vineyard and subject to 'Orlah. 

5 Here Rabina's question to Mar. b. Rab Ashe is resumed. 

6 Because Lev. xix. 23 applies the law only to "the land." 

7 He is then in doubt whether the tree is in its fruit three years. Hence, Rabina declares, Mar would be right in eating the berries as well as the buds. 

8 Consequently only the berries are to be regarded as fruit, and not the buds; and Mar acted accordingly. 

9 I.e. it has no authority. Hence there is no doubt that the caper-bush is subject to 'Orlah. 

10 That even the bud is subject to 'Orlah. 

11 This is the literal rendering of the Hebrew, the grammatical construction of which is peculiar. 

12 The rind, shell, etc. 

13 The caper-bud falls from the bush when ripe; hence it cannot be regarded as a protection so that it should be subject to 'Orlah. 

14 With the fruit to make up the minimum bulk which can contract impurity.

1 And the blossom bears the same relationship to the pomegranate that the caper-bud does to the berry. 

2 If, then, the pomegranate-blossom is subject to 'Orlah, so shoald the caper-bud be.

4 That the protection must be attached to the ripened fruit. 

5 I e. is subject to 'Orlah. 

6 The Halakah is in agreement with the Rabbis; and since the caper-bad corresponds to the grape-bud, it too should not be subject to 'Orlah.

1 The name of Rabban Gamaliel. 

2 M. adds : which is an abstract of three. 

3 In the Baraita above, it is stated "if a kind of corn it has not been made into bread" as, e.g., pounded grain. 

4 Since they were originally bread. 

5 According to them pounded grain only requires one benediction, and similarly boiled bread which is no longer in pieces. 

6 The Rabbis declare above that after "for instance, bread of rice or millet" no benediction is necessary, and here they are made to hold the opinion that one benediction, the abstract of three, is required. 

7 I.e. in the quoted Baraita, the reading should be "no benediction is required" not "one benediction which is an abstract of three." 

8 A dish resembling the Habis, consisting of honey, flour and oil. See T. A.J. p. 107.

1 That pieces of bread, the size of an olive, require the benediction "...Who bringest forth bread from the earth." 

2 A non-priest. 

3 The priest. 

4 Cf. Lev. ii. 6. 

5 Since there are no pieces the size of an olive. 

6 I.e. the benediction is unnecessary. 

7 According to Rashi this refers to the cmmbs of the meal-offering. But Tosafot object that this cannot be, because it continaes "should it be leaven"; and the meal-offering must be unleaven. Consequently it is taken to refer to crumbs of different species, each in itself not the size of an olive. 

8 By eating them on Passover. 

9 When it is his duty to eat unleaven. Consequently these crumbs are together considered to be equivalent to a piece of the size of an olive, otherwise he would not be violating the Passover if they were leaven, or fulfil the law of the Passover if unleaven. 

===================================================

Page : 252
----------
1 Therefore we cannot argue from this Baraita to the case under consideration. 

2 I.e. a piece of bread the size of four eggs. The meaning is, he must not spread the eating of the crumbs over a long space of time ; the maximum being the time required to eat half a roll. 

3 Lit. large; i.e. a loaf which has not been entirely reduced to crumbs, but only a part of it. If, then, he eats of these crumbs and they are not the size of an olive, he is not required to say the benediction "...Who bringest forth bread from the earth."

5 Respecting the correct benediction for the Shattit. 

6 Even if eaten as food. 

7 I.e. with the definite article omitted. It is noteworthy that in the other benedictions there is no article. A difference in tense-meaning is here associated with its inclusion or omission.

4 No benediction is required unless the amount of food eaten is the size of an olive. If, therefore, one eats only an olive, he has not partaken of the minimum, since the stone has to be removed. 

5 Jastrow adopts the Talmudic derivation which makes this a Hebrew word from the root agr "to store," hence "fit for storage, of good quality." It might, however, be the name of a place; see Neubauer, p. 387, who identifies it with Egra in the interior of Babylon. J. Perles, Zur rabbinischen Sprachund Sagenkunde, p. 34, suggests ***.

7 The reference in v. 9 is to "bread," and according to Rabban Gamaliel, it is inserted lest without it, connecting v. 10 with v. 8, it be thought that even if one chewed wheat in its raw state, he must say the three benedictions. Hence v. 9 is inserted to show that the wheat must be made into "bread" before the benedictions are necessary.

3 The Levite had to give a tenth of his tithe to the priest, known as the Terumah of the tithe ; cf. Num. xviii. 26. 

4 Cf. Deut. xiv. 22 ff. This was a tithe of the produce after the Levite had received his tithe, and had to be eaten in Jerusalem or redeemed by its equivalent in money being spent there.

2 In that there is no obligation for Zimmun, but it is purely voluntary. 

3 This speaks as though it were obligatory for women ; and if a hundred women are equal to two men in this respect, then it should be obligatory for two men ! 

4 There are at least three women so that the number required by Pb. xxziv. 4 is forthcoming, which is not the case with two men. 

5 I.e. two.

According to Rashi, the text should be rendered : The Grace after meals consists of two [benedictions, viz. when two eat together and there is no Zimmun] or of three [benedictions, viz. when three eat together. This is on the supposition that the Zimmun formula extends to the end of the first benediction] ; and there is another teaching : It consists of three [benedictions, viz. when two eat together] or four [benedictions, viz. when the Zimmun formula is added]. Apart from the objection mentioned in the preceding note, Tusafot point out that the numerals "two, three, four" are grammatically to be connected with a masculine noun (viz. men) and not a feminine word (viz. benedictions). 


1 I.e. the fourth benediction in Singer, p. 283, which is not to be considered in this connection. 

2 They compress the second and third benedictions into one ; thus, when two labourers say Grace, they say two benedictions, and when three, they say three. 

3 This fourth benediction is accordingly an essential part of the Grace, and gives something to a fourth man to say, even though the Zimmun formula includes the first benediction.

1 According to Rashi, the question refers to the man who stopped his meal in order to be included for Zimmun with two others. Since, in Rab Sheshet's view, be joins with them up to the end of the first benediction, where should be resume his Grace? According to Tosafot, it refers to the man who is leading the Grace with Zimmun. After the others have responded "Blessed be He of Whose bounty we have partaken, and through Whose goodness we live," where does he go on ? 

2 On Rashi's interpretation, to the beginning of the first benediction ; but on that of Tosafot, he repeats his own formula with an addition, viz. "We will bless Him of Whose bounty we have partaken and through Whose goodness we live." 

3 According to Rashi, he starts the second benediction ; according to Tosafot, he resumes the response of the others : "Blessed be He of Whose bounty" etc. Cf. Singer, p. 280, line 2 of Hebrew. 

4 Rashi omits the word "old."

8 Since the first tithe from which Terumah has been taken is allowable, it is obvious that one who has eaten it may be included for Zimmun. Why does the Mishnah mention it? 

9 This great Terumah was due to the priest ; cf. Num. xviii. 8 ff., and should be separated from the produce before the tithe is taken. If, however, the order had been reversed, it would not invalidate a man from being included for Zimmun.

4 From the common use of the verb "to give," a Gezerah Shawah (see p. 18 n. 5) is drawn — if a benediction is required for the land (cf. the second paragraph of the Grace) given by God, likewise is a benediction required for the Torah given by Him. 

5 Cf . fol. 54 a, p. 348.

7 See the discussion on fol. 46 a, pp. 297 f. If it is held that this benediction is Rabbinic, then it is distinct from what precedes (which is from the Torah), and being a separate benediction requires the reference to the Kingship, because without it a benediction is not complete. Cf. above, fol. 40 b, p. 267.

1 Because "from" implies only part of the Divine goodness, as though we were not entirely dependent upon His goodness. 

2 We must be humble in asking for the Divine blessing and not, as it were, demand the whole of it ; therefore the use of "from" is justifiable. But in the Grace we make a declaration, and so "from" is out of place. 

3 In asking for the Divine blessing, i.e. ask for much and there is no need to be humble in petitioning God. 

4 This request is for spiritual things, not material good. 

5 According to Neubauer, p. 395, it is a contraction of Nahr Bull, a Babylonian town on the river Divalah. Wiesner, p. 109, identifies it with Nahr Obolla, a tributary of the Euphrates near ancient Basra.

10 By specifying "food," it might be thought that he is referring to the host ; but we have to thank God for much else beside food.

6 So that ten or ten myriads have the same formula. 

7 The assembly being very large and the meal prolonged, when three who sit together finish, they say Grace quietly between themselves. 

8 So as to add "our God" to the formula. 

9 If they had said Grace in parties of ten, it would have been more conspicuous and a louder tone of voice would have been required. The Exilarch might then have noticed what they were doing and regard it as a slight that they had not waited for him to say Grace.

5 I.e. each party started to say Grace and after the Zimmun formula had been said, one man left. Should three of these come together, they cannot finish their Grace with Zimmun.

Brecher, Das Transcendentale...im Talmud, p. 181 n. 127, connects the word with the Latin purgans and renders "Purgiertrank" ; but this is improbable.

1 By giving it precedence over the benediction over wine. 

2 I.e. after the meal, over the cup of wine he says Grace, the benediction over the wine, light, spices and Habdalah, the last-named corresponding to "the benediction of the day." Consequently "the benediction of the day" comes last and not first as was stated above. 

3 On the next folio, p. 337, it is stated that according to R. Meir, the point at issue is not the order of light and spices, but the benediction over the food ; consequently the quoted Baraita could be Bet Hillel's teaching. 

4 To connect the Baraita with our Mishnah. 

5 The Mishnah places the benediction over food, according to both Schools, in the middle, whereas the Baraita allows it to come first. We have, therefore, to depend upon the difference of the two Schools in the version of R. Judah, viz. the order of light and spices, according to which the Baraita agrees with Bet Shammai. 

6 According to the Mishnah, Bet Shammai require the benediction over the day before that over the wine ; but according to the Baraita (which it is concluded emanates from Bet Shammai) the benediction over the wine precedes the Habdalah. 

=====================================================

Page: 334
----------
1 The advent is marked by the benediction over the day, therefore it should come first, and it is to that the Mishnah refers. 

2 The conclusion is marked by the Habdalah and should come last. Since the baraita refers to the conclusion of the holy day, it does not conflict with the Mishnah. 

3 The Barita stated : "Should he have only one cup of wine, he leaves it until after the meal and combines all [the benedictions] afterwards," i.e. wine is required for Grace. But according to the Mishnah, if wine is brought to the man after he has eaten, so that he has not yet said a benediction over wine, he does so over this cup, drinks it and then says Grace; therefore wine is not essential for the Grace. 

4 I.e. dips his finger in the wine, which he then puts to his mouth. 

5 According to the Tanna of the Mishnah, i.e. R. Judah, Bet Shammai require wine for Grace ; but R. Hiyya understands them as not requiring it. 

6 Liquid is the conductor of defilement for food ; cf. Lev. xi. 34. 

7 Without the medium of a liquid; so why this fear?

3 Which belongs to the class of holy things and can be defiled by a table unclean in the second degree. 

4 To protect themselves against defilement. 

5 Bet Hillel's reason was the desire to protect the food from defilement. 

6 And Bet Shammai are concerned to protect the hands from defilement. 

7 The water may splash on to it, and it is forbidden to spoil food ; cf. fol. 50b, p. 324. 

8 Which may be spoiled by being splashed upon. The words in brackets are omitted by M. and are probably an interpolation.

1 Consequently there is no need to fear that bread will be spoilt by the water, since the crumbs do not count. 

2 Therefore the attendant will know that the larger pieces have to be removed, and the washing of the hands can safely be done before the table is cleared. 

3 This, not Jose as in edd., is probably the correct reading. Cf. D. S. ad loc. 

4 M. omits : b. Judah. 

5 M.: Rab. 

6 Why, then, did Raba say the benediction over spices before over the light? 

7 I.e. continned the teaching of the Mishnah which must be supplemented as follows. 

8 Hence Raba acted aright in saying the benediction over the spices first.

1 The word used by Bet Hillel. It ia the participle of the verb. 

2 Or, he continues to create. 

3 To Bet Shammai that bore' can mean "he will create." In all the following passages the participle refers to the past. 

4 Rashi explains: coloured lights, as red, white, green. "[Bet] Hillel considered the different colours of bodies to be due to different sorts of light : whilst [Bet] Shammai attributed colour to the object coloured, and not to the light by means of which we see it" (S. Brodetsky iu J. R. ii. p. 66). 

5 I.e. by its light forbidden work has been done on the Sabbath. 

6 Throughout this passage some edd. read "Samaritans," for fear of the Censor. 

7 Therefore the objection to "the spices of the gentiles" cannot be on the ground of idolatry.

2 M. omits : b. Isaac. 

3 Provided it was lit before the advent of the Sabbath ; but if kindled on the Sabbath, one may not use it for the benediction. 

4 I.e. the flame is not to be considered as continuous and the same, but as consisting of a succession of flashes, each distinct. Consequently it may be thought that the prohibited light ceases with the termination of the Sabbath, and the flame then becomes permissible for the purpose of the benediction. 

5 The circumstance referred to here is : A man puts oil in a vessel and places it in the public way, and by means of a torch which he holds while in the private domain, sets light to it. 

6 The flame of the burning oil is distinct from the torch which ignited it; and the law only considers an infraction of the Sabbath the carrying of the same thing from the private to the public way or vice versa. Since then, in that circumstance, the man is deemed guilty of an infraction of the law, the ignited oil must be considered identical with the torch.

8 The light kindled by the Israelite.

1 In whose honour the light had been kindled; and since it is not an ordinary illumination it cannot be used for the benediction. 

2 Who may be having his meal there, and consequently the light is for illumination and the benediction may be said. 

3 By whose light the beadle could have his meal ; therefore the illumination is in honour of a distinguished visitor and cannot be used for the benediction. 

4 I.e. the religious devotion of a Congregation is better than that of an individual. 

5 All those studying would have to stop to listen, perhaps in the middle of a difficult passage; whereas each could say the benediction when most convenient for him. 

6 An exclamation meaning "healing," when somebody sneezed. J. T. Chap, vi, has the Greek word *** in place of the Hebrew marpe'. See J. E. II. p. 255. In Tosifta Shab. viii. 5, it is denounced as a superstitious custom. On the Eastern etiquette in the event of one sneezing, see Lane, p. 210.

9 I.e. the perfume is not there for one to smell but to be sold. 

10 In 'Erubin 64 b, the Rabbis deplore that the Jewish women are addicted to sorcery. Hillel declared : "The more women, the more witchcraft"; Abot ii. 8 ; Singer, p. 188.

4 In the opinion of Rashi, this means a walk of four Mil for a heavy meal; but Tosafot explain four Mil for a light meal.

6 M. and some edd. insert here : "Neither shall any plagae come nigh thy tent" (ibid.)— i.e. thou shalt not find thy wife in doubt whether she be menstrual when thou returnest from a journey. The words disturb the connection. 

7 The parallel passage (fol. 14a, p. 90) reads: R. Jonah in the name of R. Zera. M.: R. Zera in the name of R. Jannai. The correct reading is probably R. Jannai [II] said in the name of R. Zera. Cf. D. S. ad loc. and Hyman, II. p. 765 a. 

8 See p. 90 n. 9.

6 Rashi explains that while the egg-shell remains unbroken, one is doubtful of its contents. Pinner suggests that the interpretation may be due to resemblance between the Aramaic words for "egg" and "petition"; and as when the egg is broken it is finished with, that suggests a petition granted. The Rev. A. Newman writes, "A spherical body, like an egg, cannot stand firm. Hence, as the egg is unstable, so is the fulfilment of the petition uncertain."

Therefore naked in Babylon means without the sins one would expect there; and naked in Palestine means without having fulfilled the commandments which distinguish Jewish life there from that elsewhere.

6 "Before" can also mean "first," i.e. the first to be punished, before the animals.

8 If the father is away, the son should not wait for his return, but sell his father's goods. Hence the teaching of the proverb is also : Do not procrastinate. 

9 He cleared his throat as a signal, to find out whether anybody was there. 

10 One should not speak in a privy, and by so doing Rab Safra exposed himself to the attack of the demon (lit. goat) ; see the preceding fol., p. 410.

5 This is capable of two interpretations: (1) If there is a series of benedictions, one response after the last, and not after each, is sufficient. So Rashi. (2) That one and the same formula of praise is to be used after all benedictions, and not a wording distinctive for each.

7 Why does the Mishnah (see p. 349) add the quotation from Judges vi. 12 after that from Ruth ii. 11?

1 I.e. the quotation is not a greeting but the message which the angel was commanded to communicate ; therefore this verse cannot be used to support the teaching that the Divine Name must be mentioned in a salutation. 

2 By "thy mother" is here meant the great men of the past. Follow in their ways ; so that even if Boaz used the Name of his own accord, act likewise. 

3 I.e. when people are eager to study Torah, impart thy knowledge to them; but when they are indifferent, do thou continue to study. On the wording of this saying, cf. A. T. I. p. 6 n. 2.

1 I.e. even if engaged upon something forbidden, think of Him, then "He will direct (lit. straighten) thy paths." There are some who explain that the transgression refers only to the violation of a religious rite, as, e.g., the desecration of the Sabbath for the purpose of saving life. Some MSS (cf. D. S. ad loc.) insert here the proverb: The thief on the point of breaking into [a house] calls on God [for help].
