2 Just after daybreak ; and not until midday, as the Mishnah declares. 

3 See p. 55 n. 6. 

4 The day was considered to commence at dusk. If, therefore, the afternoon Tefillah were omitted, it could not be compensated for the same day. 

==================================================

1 See the discussion in the next folio, p. 174. 

2 If a sacrifice is not brought on its appointed day, it lapses. Is it the same with the Tefillah ? 

3 M. : For Rab Judah said in the name of Rab. 

4 Cannot repair his omission. This contradicts all that has preceded. 

5 The reading of the Shema' and the Tefillah with the Congregation. 

6 When it is said that the omitted prayer cannot be replaced. 

7 That the inference from Eccles. i. 15 applies only to one who intentionally omitted the prayer. 

8 See Singer, p. 46. 

9 Because it is said only to compensate for the omission. 

10 This Baraita confirms the opinion of Rab Huna b. Judah in the preceding paragraph, that the omitted afternoon Tefillah can be compensated for in the evening.

5 Of the burnt-offerings.

1 Of other sacrifices where the blood had to be sprinkled before sunset. 

2 The additional offerings were brought on the Sabbath, New Moon, Festivals, New Year and Day of Atonement. Corresponding to them are the additional Tefillot ; see Singer, pp. 159 ff. , 225 f ., 233 ff., 245 ff., 264 ff. 

3 See p. 6 n. 5. The greater afternoon would consequently be from 12.30 p.m. until 6 p.m. 

4 From 3.30p.m. until 6 p.m. 

5 In this statement in the Mishnah. 

6 4.45 p.m., i.e. midway between 3.30 and 6 p.m. 

7 Who held that the Patriarchs instituted the Tefillot, whereas throughout the discussion the time of the prayers is determined by the time of the sacrifices. 

8 That R. Jose b. R. Hannina agrees that a basis was subsequently found in the sacrifices. 

9 Does it mean until the beginning of, or the end of, the fourth hour? 

10 The Rabbis permit the afternoon Tefillah to be read until the evening ; R. Judah until the middle of the afternoon. But if "until" here means "until the end of," his terminus ad quem would be identical with that of the Rabbis 

==================================================
Page 176
----------
1 It is a principle of the Jewish ritual that what is constant takes precedence of what is not. The afternoon Tefillah is to be said daily, whereas the additional only on special occasions. 

2 Assuming that "until" means excluding, then according to R. Judah the additional Tefillah may be said until noon. But that of the afternoon only commences at 12.30 p.m. ; how, then, could the two Tefillot clash? 

3 This conclusion contradicts that arrived at in the preceding paragraph. 

4 See p. 175 n. 10. 

5 I.e. when R. Judah declares the afternoon Tefillah maybe read until the middle of the afternoon, be gives "until" the inclusive meaning; but be refers to the first half, which is 4.45. Up to that time he permits it, whereas the Rabbis allow it to be read the whole afternoon. Hence it is shown that although "until" means including, the opinions of R. Judah and the Rabbis differ. 

6 M. adds : b. Isaac. 

7 That "until" means including. 

8 Special circumstances of a rather complicated nature are implied here ; see Rashi. 

==================================================
Page 177
----------
1 To prove her husband's death in a foreign country. For all other matters two witnesses are required. 

2 I.e. the law of the goring ox (Exod. xxi. 29) was extended to all animals. 

3 The wine of the drink-offering must be at least forty days old, otherwise it is not called "strong drink" as required by Num. xxviii. 7. 

4 This is in agreement with R. Judah's view that tbe morning Tefillah may be said until the fourth hour. 

5 Lit. "selected" — the name given to the Tractate 'Eduyyot in the fourth Order of the Mishnah, containing a collection of legal decisions and opinions of ancient Tannaim. 

6 A distinction is drawn between tbe phrases "heat of the day" and "heat of the sun." The latter means the places in the sun are hot but those shaded cool; whereas "heat of the day" means that the heat is general, as at noon. "Heat of the sun" refers to the fourth hour, because before 10 a.m. even the sunny places are not excessively hot. 

7 But although tbe Israelites were commanded to gather the manna "morning by morning," which according to R. Judah means up to 10 a.m., by that time it had already melted. The gathering had therefore to be done in the third hour. 

8 They understood "morning by morning" to mean half the morning was for gathering the manna ; and since they consider the morning to be from 6 a.m. to noon, this would mean in the first three hours and the other half would be for melting. 

==================================================
Page 178
----------

1 They gathered the manna within the four hours, but they anticipated the commencement by one hour, thus finishing in the third hour of the day. 

2 M. : Rab Nahman b. Isaac. 

3 With reference to the morning Tefillah. 

4 With reference to the afternoon Tefillah. 

5 Because he taught that the afternoon Tefillah may be said until the middle of the afternoon, after which time the evening prayers may be recited. 

6 By passing in front of him to resume his seat. 

7 Although it is not yet dusk. 

8 In praying behind his teacher. 

==================================================
Page 179
----------

1 M. adds : b. Hisma ; but the correct form of the name is Eliezer Hisma. D. S. thinks that R. Eleazar is here intended. 

2 M. adds : or in front of his master. 

3 Without giving him his title of respect. 

4 Between the week-days and the Sabbath by laying aside all work, since he had said the Sabbath-Tefillah so early. 

5 M. : Abdan. 

6 M. omits : b. Liwai. 

7 On the Sabbath-eve, after saying the Sabbath-Tefillah. 

8 M.: Abdan. 

9 Hence in the case of an individual, the Tefillah would have to be repeated. 

10 So M. correctly. Edd. : Hiyya b. Abin. 

11 I.e. before dusk. 

12 See Singer, p. 124. 

13 M. : Judah. 

==================================================
Page 180
----------

1 M. : Ammi. 

2 M. omits : in the name of Rab. D. S. gives Rabbi as a variant for Rab ; but the reading of edd. is preferred by Hyman, i. p. 20 b. 

3 Some edd. and M. omit : Abbai said. 

4 M. and some edd. : Rab. 

5 A name given to the Rabbis who were skilled in dialectical contests. 

==================================================
Page 181
----------
1 He probably suspected Rabban Gamaliel of seeking another opportunity to humiliate him. See below. 

2 The witness against him. 

3 Waiting for Rabban Gamaliel's permission to sit. 

4 I.e. the Amora; see Glossary, s.v. 

5 These two Rabbis differed on which day the New Year was to commence, and Rabban Gamaliel compelled R. Joshua to visit him with his stick and money (as though it were not a holy day) on the Day of Atonement according to the latter's calculation. See Rosh Hash. 25 a. 

6 See Bekorot 36 a. A scene similar to that described here occurred over the question whether a distinction is to be drawn between a priest who was a Haber and one who was an 'Am ha'ares (see Glossary, s.v.) in the matter of judging the blemish of an animal destined as a sacrifice. 

7 From his Office as President. 

8 He was descended from Gentiles. 

9 Some commentators suppose this to refer to Rabban Gamaliel. 

10 Lit. "to work for the palace." The meaning of the phrase is not certain. Krauss, T. A. ii. p. 543 n. 100, (since the root means "to till") suggests "to provide the palace with agricultural supplies." 

==================================================
Page 182
----------
1 M. and some edd. here insert : "We have the tradition, 'We may raise to a higher degree of sanctity but not degrade to a lower degree'." "But perhaps Rabban Gamaliel will plague thee !" He answered.... Rashi rejects this reading; and the quotation "We may raise to a higher degree" etc. seems out of place, inasmuch as the Rabbis had just degraded Rabban Gamaliel. The passage occurs further on, whence it probably was wrongly copied here. 

2 Or "precious cup." Rashi gives it the meaning "crystal goblet." 

3 One occupying so exalted a position as President should possess the dignity which grey hair brings. The same idea seems to underlie the wearing of a wig by judge and counsel. 

4 J. T. reads sixteen. 

5 Referring to his beard. 

6 See fol. 12 b, p. 79. 

7 I.e. sincere and of a high moral standard. 

8 To accommodate the crowds that sought admission. 

9 This is the correct form of the name. Edd. : Joseph. 

10 I.e. the new disciples were beautiful outwardly but not inwardly, and he had not prevented any worthy students from studying. 

11 The new disciples were in reality worthy men. 

==================================================
Page 183
----------
1 It is doubtful whether this is to be identified with the Tractate 'Eduyyot in the fourth Order of the Mishnah. It more probably refers to a collection of legal decisions which has not been preserved. 

2 Some edd. add : for a single hour. 

3 I.e. the real Ammonites form only a minority of the inhabitants of the land of Ammon ; it is consequently presumed that the would-be proselyte belonged to the majority who were not Ammonites. 

4 According to J. T. he went to conciliate all the members of the Sanhedrin. 

5 Or, a smith. In the version of J. T. he was making needles. 

==================================================
Page 184
----------
1 Lit. "I am humbled to thee." The words ooold also mean, "I agree with thee," i.e. "Thou art quite right" ; of. A. T. i. p. 161 n. 2. 

2 Or, a washer ; followers of this occupation are often mentioned in the Talmud and seem to have been rather despised. 

3 He meant that Rabban Gamaliel had a hereditary claim to the Office of President which should be respected. 

4 He was evidently against re-installing Rabban Gamaliel. J. T. mentions that he was grieved at not being appointed to the Office. 

5 To R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah and induce him to stand aside in favour of Rabban Gamaliel. 

6 By "sprinkler" is meant the priest who had the duty of purifying one defiled by contact with the dead, by sprinkling him with the ashes of the "red heifer" mingled with running water; cf. Num. xix. For the sense of the enigmatic message, see note 3 above. 

7 I.e. ordinary well-water and common ashes, not the running water and ashes of the red heifer, as required by the Torah. 

8 To convey to him the invitation to resume Office. 

==================================================
Page 185
----------
1 In Hagigah 3 a this question is asked by R. Joshua. 

2 Who asked, "Is the evening Tefillah voluntary or obligatory?" and caused the scene. The tradition is faulty ; R. Simeon b. Jobai could not chronologically have taken part in this affair. Cf. A. T. ii. p. 70. 

3 See above, fol. 27 a, p. 176. 

4 See p. 176 n. 1. 

5 M. : Ze'ira, 

6 Of honouring the Sages. 

7 What follows is uncertain, and there are many variants. D. S. prefers the reading of the Soncino edition : "Who stated the Halakah in the House of Study?" He replied, "R. Johanan." He asked him, "What was it?" He replied, "One says the afternoon Tefillah and afterwards the additional." R. Zera asked him. 

8 I.e. that R. Johanan was the authority for this teaching. 

9 R.V. "Them that sorrow for." R.V. marg. "Them that are removed from."

2 Rab Joseph was the Principal of the Seminary at Pombedita, and used to deliver a discourse every Sabbath morning before the additional Tefillah. 

3 Who resented Rab Iwya's absence. 

4 M. : Raba. 

5 I.e. a man may say the Tefillah at home before the Congregation says it in the Synagogue.

1 As a teacher of Torah. 

2 Either idlers or stall-holders. Wiesner, p. 64, suggests that the word keronut is connected with the Latin corona and means "a company," sc. of musicians. J. T. reads : with those who frequent theatres and circuses. 

3 Jastrow, p. 331 a, explains : i.e. parading a superficial knowledge of the Bible by verbal memorising. Goldschmidt suggests that the word higgayon (lit. meditation), which in medieval Hebrew is used in the sense of "logic," may here mean "philosophical speculation." It has also been explained as referring to the reading of apocryphal literature as against the canonical Scriptures ; cf. A. T. i. p. 97 n. 5.

3 For this benediction, see Singer, p. 48 — "And for slanderers," etc. "It was directed against antinomians — those who rejected or neglected the Law — and also against sectarians within the Synagogue. The statement which originated with Justin Martyr that the paragraph is an imprecation against Christians in general has no foundation whatever" (Abrahams, p. Ixlv). See also Herford, Christianity in Midrash and Talmud, pp. 125 ff.

2 "The Lord is one," which is taken as an attribute of the Deity. 

3 On the word ha-Pakoli see T. A. i. p. 540 n. 138, ii. p. 623 n. 39. 

4 Derenbourg, Essai sur l'histoire, p. 345 n., explains the statement "in the following year he had forgotten it" by conjecturing that the benediction relating to the Minim was originally said not daily as now, but on a special annual occasion. 

5 Trying to recall the words. 

6 From his office as Precentor. 

7 Before becoming righteous. It is possible for such an one to lapse into evil ways. 

8 Abot ii. 5 ; Singer, p. 187. 

9 There is confusion between Johanan, i.e. John Hyrcanus, and Jannaeus (=Jonathan, see Derenbourg, op. cit. p. 95 n.), i.e. Alexander Jannaeus. The former was at first favourably disposed towards the Pharisees, but in the latter part of his life opposed them (Schurer, i.i. pp. 288f.) ; but the latter was throughout his reign hostile to them and massacred numbers of them ; ibid. pp. 300 ff. 

==================================================
Page 191
----------

1 In holding that Johanan and Jannaeus were identical, he assumes that he had been originally wicked and that accounts for his later lapse. 

2 If Johanan was originally righteous, how could he have become a Sadducee ? 

3 The benediction relating to Minim. He broke down in the middle ; consequently there was no suspicion that his heretical views made him hesitate to pronounce the words. 

4 About discharging the Precentor. 

5 See Singer, pp. 136-142. 

6 Ibid. pp. 239-242. 

7 M.: Raba. 

8 Either Carthage or Carthagene in Spain, where there was a Jewish Community in the 2nd cent. See Neubauer, p. 411. Krauss, p. 572, identifies it with Carthage. Bacher, A. P. A. II. p. 218 n. 6, p. 225 n. 1, denies the existence of an Amora of this name and suggests as the true reading : R. Abba of Carthage said in the name of R. Isaac. 

9 The additional six benedictions to the eighteen are enumerated in Mishnah Ta'anit ii. 3 f. The only addition now made to the Tefillah on a fast day is the paragraph in Singer, p. 50, which is quoted from J. T. 

10 Words for prayer and supplication. 

11 Since it was on no special day of the Calendar that this happened.

2 M. omits : in the name of R. Assi. 

3 See Singer, p. 50. 

4 On concluding the Tefillah one steps back three paces, as though retiring from the divine Throne before which the prayer was offered. 

5 M. adds : Rab from R. Hiyya and R. Hiyya from Rabbi. 

6 Cf. the examples quoted fol. 16 b, 17 a, pp. 107 ff. 

7 I.e. he performs his devotions in a perfunctory manner.

----------
1 I.e. he makes his prayers stereotyped. 

2 Dimdume hammah has been explained in two ways : (1) "The reddening of the sun," connecting the word with adom, "red"; (2) "The stillness of the sun" (from the root damam), i.e. the time in the morning and evening when the sun appears to stand still or be silent ; so Jastrow. 

3 I.e. as the sun rises and before the moon appears. 

4 Palestine. 

5 This refers only to the afternoon prayers. If he waited for sunset to say the afternoon Tefillah, something might detain him and the night come on.

3 In his prayer, i.e. using the plural and not the singular. 

4 The question is capable of two interpretations : (1) Up to what distance may a man go without saying the prayer, and if he exceed it, bis prayer becomes invalid ? (2) What is the minimum distance which constitutes a journey necessitating the prayer? 

5 Who was blind.

7 On this Sabbath they, as Principals of the Seminaries, delivered a public discourse. 

8 I.e. on the Sabbath before the Festival. He gave his Amora the gist of the discourse, and while the latter was expounding it, Rab Ashe said his prayers sitting to avoid giving the assembly the trouble of standing up, as they would have to do out of respect for him, if he stood to say the Tefillah. 

9 Who gathered a quorum at their house. 

10 Who said the Tefillah before the Shema'. 

==================================================

1 The name of R. Eleazar b. 'Azariah. 

2 If he prays alone. 

3 Because there are not ten adult males to constitute a quorum. 

4 M. : Rab Abba b. R. Hannina, which is probably correct. 

5 M.: R. Hiyya in the name of Rab. 

6 See p. 74 n. 2. 

7 A reference probably to the Roman-Pereian Wars. 

8 The meaning is, I do not recognise you as an authority on the Halakah.
 
9 They must accordingly have been the morning and additional Tefillot, and thereby he acted contrary to the view as stated in the Mishnah. 

==================================================
Page 200
----------

1 I.e. he said the morning Tefillah twice, and not the additional. 

2 R. Johanan was a very eminent Rabbi, and he clearly intended to imply that R. Jannai did say the additional Tefillah. 

3 See p. 46. 

4 I.e. they read the additional Tefillah privately although there were several local Congregations. 

5 Rashi comments : i.e. Rab. Although Rab is usually referred to in this way, here Rabbi must be intended ; cf. Hyman, ii. p. 785. 

6 It does not refer here to the additional. 

7 See Singer, p. 50. 

8 If he omitted the reference when praying with the Congregation, he does not repeat the Tefillah because he will hear it said by the Precentor. Some explain that it refers to the Precentor himself, who does not repeat the Tefillah if he omitted tbe reference, so as not to trouble the Congregation. In view of this teaching, R. Hiyya b. Abba, since he was not praying with a Congregation, was right in repeating the Tefillah. 

9 If he has to say two. 

==================================================

----------
1 The month is "full" when it has 30 days, "defective" when it has 29. When the moon is "full," two days (the concluding day of the old and the first of the new) are observed, and the extra prayer said on both. Therefore if he omitted it one evening, he can say it the next. 

2 Viz. the Bet Din consecrate the new month only by day.
