The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> answers that those halachot describe a situation where the person has no desire to eat the secondary food in its own right and eats it only because of the primary food. In this halachah, the Rambam is speaking about an instance in which one desires to eat the other foods; nevertheless, they are included in the blessing recited over bread because bread includes all other foods.<br>The <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> offers a different interpretation, which appears more appropriate to the context in which the laws are discussed.

When the passage from the Babylonian Talmud is studied in the light of the passage from the Jerusalem Talmud, the Rambam's ruling is no longer difficult.<br>This relates to a concept frequently discussed by students of the Rambam: Does the Rambam accept the principle that when there is a difference of opinion between the Babylonian Talmud and the Jerusalem Talmud, the Halachah follows the Babylonian Talmud, or not?</i> food, however, does not include cooked grains.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]"

Thus, a person's decision not to continue eating is not considered final, since it is quite possible that he will change his mind and decide to eat again. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 179:1).<br>Based on these principles, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 179:1) rules that, although once a person has decided to cease eating or drinking a new blessing is generally required, when partaking of a meal it is not sufficient to make a mental decision, and a person must wash before grace to be considered to have ceased eating.</i> If he did not decide [to cease] eating or drinking and had in mind to continue - even if he <sup class=""footnote-marker"">4</sup><i class=""footnote"">remained in the place in which he ate originally, and</i> made an interruption for the entire day <sup class=""footnote-marker"">6</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Rambam's terminology appears to be a stylistic exaggeration.

In contrast, the blood of the <i>Chaggigah</i> should be sprinkled on the two opposite corners of the altar.<br>Rabbi Yishmael maintains that בדיעבד (after the fact), were a person to pour the blood of the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering on the base of the altar, he would be considered to have fulfilled his obligation. Hence, the blessing for the Pesach offering can apply to the <i>Chaggigah</i> as well.<br>In contrast, Rabbi Akiva maintains that even ""after the fact,"" the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering is not acceptable if its blood is not sprinkled on the altar as prescribed. Accordingly, the blessing for the Pesach offering has no connection to the <i>Chaggigah</i> at all.<br>The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> questions the Rambam's decision. In <i>Hilchot P'sulei HaMukdashim</i> 2:2, the Rambam writes: ""Whenever [blood] is prescribed to be presented [on the altar] by sprinkling, and it was presented by pouring, one has fulfilled his obligation,"" accepting the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael. If so, his acceptance of Rabbi Akiva's opinion here appears to present a contradiction.<br>Rav Yechezkel Landau (<i>Tz'lach, Pesachim</i> ibid.) attempts to resolve the issue, explaining that the Rambam follows the interpretation of Rav Chayim HaCohen (<i>Tosefot, Pesachim</i> ibid.), who favored a different text of the Talmud and, accordingly, an alternate interpretation of the difference in opinion between the two Sages.<br>Rav Chayim maintains that Rabbi Yishmael considers the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering as secondary to the Paschal sacrifice. (See also Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Pesachim</i> 10:7.) Hence, reciting a blessing over the Paschal sacrifice, the essential element (עיקר) of the evening, also fulfills the requirement for the secondary element (טפל), the <i>Chaggigah</i>. Indeed, regarding the blessings recited over food, the Rambam writes (<i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 3:5) that whenever there are two foods, one essential and one secondary, it is only necessary to recite a blessing over the essential food. A blessing is not required for the secondary item.<br>This interpretation itself presents a question: Since the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering was instituted only for the sake of the Paschal sacrifice and is not an obligation in its own right, it can be considered as ""secondary"" to the Pesach sacrifice. If so, what is the rationale for Rabbi Akiva's opinion?<br>It can be explained that Rabbi Akiva never considers one mitzvah as secondary to another. We may use the labels ""primary"" and ""secondary"" in regard to matters dependent on our will, but not in regard to mitzvot which we fulfill in obedience to God's desires. Therefore, though the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering was instituted because of the Paschal sacrifice, once it has been instituted, it must be considered as a mitzvah in its own right, with its own importance.

A fifth cup is mixed and placed on the table, and the ""great Hallel"" is recited over it. However, that cup should not be drunk. Thus, the fifth cup is not included as one of the four. Rather, it is a separate and independent obligation.<br>The Vilna Gaon (see <i>Ta'amei HaMinhagim</i> 551) associates the fifth cup with the cup of Elijah. The Talmud concludes the discussion of many unresolved questions with the statement: תיקו. Literally, the term is a shortened form of the word תיקום, ""let it remain"". However, it is also interpreted as an acrostic for the expression תשבי יתרץ קושיות ואביעות - ""The Tishbite (Elijah) will answer all questions and difficulties.""<br>Since the requirement of the fifth cup remains an unresolved question, the fifth cup is left for Elijah in the hope that he will come soon and resolve this question as well.<br>The homiletic aspects of this comment notwithstanding, from a halachic perspective a differentiation must be made between the two. The fifth cup is of Talmudic origin and may be poured for each individual. In contrast, Elijah's cup is an Ashkenazic custom of later origin, and a single cup is used for the whole family.

Though in <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> (The Guide to the Perplexed) 2:40 the Rambam himself elaborates upon that idea, it can be said that here his intent is different. He is emphasizing the degree to which each individual's personality is a combination of different traits, which may be unrelated and even distant from each other.

The stingy man, unlike the miser, may spend money for his own needs, but is tightfisted when others are concerned. By the same token, a freehanded man need not necessarily indulge himself, though he is generous when giving charity.

Each point along this imaginary line stands apart - ""is distant"" - from the others on that line. In a diagram, this idea might be depicted as follows:X-----*-------*------*-------*----------*---------*XStingy intermediate points freehanded.<br>However, it is highly unlikely that all the Rambam wishes to teach us is that there are many intermediate points of temperament between the extremes. After all, that is self-evident. Furthermore, in each set of associated temperaments - for example, stinginess and freehandedness - only three points on the line are of importance to the Rambam in clarifying his view of personality development: the two extremes and the midpoint. Why should he mention all the other intermediate possibilities?<br>Thus, it appears that the Rambam is telling us that there is a midpoint temperament between each pair of contrasting extremes. Given the entire range of human temperaments, there are a number of midpoints which are not necessarily related to each other. For example, the midpoint for generosity may be very different from the midpoint for humility.

We might expect the intermediate point between gluttony and its opposite extreme to be eating to one's satisfaction. However, here we are told that we should desire only what is sufficient in order to exist.<br>However, the Rambam is not telling us to deny ourselves satisfaction. Deuteronomy 8:10 teaches: ""You shall eat and be satisfied, and bless God, your Lord."" Based on that verse, <i>Berachot</i> 48b explains that we are obligated to recite grace only when we feel physically satisfied. (The Rambam quotes this concept in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 1:1.) In Chapter 3, Halachah 1, and in <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, he elaborates on the negative aspects of asceticism.<br>Thus, his intent cannot be that we deny our desires, but rather that we school ourselves to desire and feel satisfied with what we need, without excess.

Conversely, it is the gluttony of the wicked which actually causes their want.<br>Note also the Midrashic interpretations of this verse:<br>""The righteous..."" This refers to Eliezer, who said to Rebecca: ""Let me sip a little water"" (Genesis 24:17  - a single sip.""And the belly of the wicked will want.""

The verse also clarifies that the Rambam is not denigrating the idea of work, but excessive preoccupation with one's profession as a means of acquiring possessions.<br>It is highly unlikely that the Rambam would criticize work per se. Note Proverbs 6:6: ""Sluggard, go to the ant, see its ways and become wise;"" and <i>Berachot</i> 8a:<br>He who enjoys the toil of his hands is greater than one who fears God..., as it is stated: ""If you eat of the work of you hands, you are fortunate and will possess the good"" (Psalms 128:2 .""You are fortunate"" - in this life, and ""will possess the good"" - in the world to come.<br>The Rambam, himself, quotes the latter passage in <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 3:11.

Thus, the contrasting extreme would be freehandedness. <i>Yikabetz</i>, like <i>vikubatz</i> in Halachah 1, reflects miserly behavior, the opposite of which is being a spendthrift.

Pride represents one extreme, its converse being absolute lack of concern for self to the extent that one walks around in rags. Between these extremes are a number of intermediate points: modesty - which might normally be considered as the intermediate level; humility - which the Rambam considers as the true middle path; and extreme humility - which is pious behavior (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>). See also the commentary on the halachah cited above.<br>Possibly, it is the exaggerated contrasts in this set of traits that make it the most fitting example to demonstrate the principle of the middle path that the Rambam espouses. These gross differences allow for the possibility of clear distinctions.</i> One who shuns pride and <sup class=""footnote-marker"">6</sup><i class=""footnote"">The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> emphasizes that one need not actually adopt the other extreme, but rather, he should tend his behavior in that direction.</i> turns to the other extreme and carries himself lowly is called pious. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">7</sup><i class=""footnote"">which represents a deviation from the mean.</i> This is the quality of piety.

He is able to appreciate the mean of each trait and express it within the context of his daily life. The pious man also possesses this quality, but due to his desire for ultimate self-refinement, he is willing to sacrifice himself and tend slightly to the extreme in certain instances.<br>Although in this halachah, the Rambam differentiates between the middle path - the path of the wise - and ""beyond the measure of the law"" - the path of the pious, in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 5:11 he describes how, ""according to the greatness of the Sage, should be the care he takes to go beyond the measure of the law.""

Rabbi Yishmael was a distinguished scholar, and, therefore, this base task would have been demeaning for him. Nevertheless, rather than refuse the porter entirely, Rabbi Yishmael purchased his entire load from him. This was considered as behavior beyond the measure of the law.<br>See also <i>Berachot</i> 7a and 45b, <i>Bava Kama</i> 100a, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 24b.

The <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Ki Tetze</i>, p. 270) also makes a similar statement. However, neither source elaborates.<br>Among the <i>Geonim</i>, the <i>Ba'al Halachot Gedolot</i> does list it as a commandment. Rav Sa'adiah Gaon does not include it as a specific commandment.<br><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive mitzvah 8) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 610) include this as one of the Torah's 613 mitzvot. However, the Rambam's inclusion of this commandment as one of the 613 mitzvot is somewhat problematic. In <i>Shoresh</i> 4 of his introduction to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, he states that he does not include any ""general mitzvah"" which does not involve a specific activity in his reckoning of the 613 mitzvot. For this reason, ""Observe My statutes"" (Leviticus 19:19  or ""Be holy"" (Leviticus 19:2  are not included in the 613 mitzvot. On the surface, the command the Rambam mentions here also seems to be an all encompassing charge to develop ourselves spiritually without any specific activity.<br>Rav Avraham, the Rambam's son, was asked this question, and he explained that here the specific activity implied by this commandment is the development of our emotions and character traits. A somewhat deeper perspective can be gained from the Rambam's own description of the mitzvah. When listing the mitzvot at the beginning of these halachot, he states that the mitzvah is ""to imitate God's ways"" and in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, he defines the mitzvah as ""to imitate Him, blessed be He, according to our potential.""<br>The implication of these statements is that man has a constant obligation to carry out all of his deeds and guide the progress of his emotional development with the intent of imitating God. (See <i>Likkutei Sichot, Tavo</i> 5748, and note the commentary on the following halachah.)</i> This is referred to as <sup class=""footnote-marker"">16</sup><i class=""footnote"">Despite the Rambam's praise of piety, his very description of it as ""beyond the measure of the law"" implies that, though it is desirable, it cannot be considered as obligatory.<br><b>and they are good and straight paths - as [Deuteronomy 28:9] states: ""And you shall walk in His ways."" -</b> The Rambam describes this mitzvah in the following halachah. Indeed, the authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> include the paragraph we have just explained as the beginning of Halachah 6.As emphasized in the introduction to this text, the Rambam has structured the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> with the intent of ""revealing all the laws to the great and to the small with regard to each and every mitzvah."" He does not mention philosophical and ethical concepts unless they are halachot - i.e., practical directives for our behavior.<br>In this context, we can understand the structure of this chapter. The Rambam set out to describe the mitzvah of following God's ways. As stated in this halachah, he perceives this to mean developing our personalities by emulating the qualities which the Creator reveals. As he states in the following halachah, those qualities are identical with the middle path of human behavior. Therefore, in the initial halachot of this chapter, the Rambam sets out to describe the nature of human personality and the ideal temperaments - the middle path - that man should seek to achieve. Having laid down this foundation, he is able to define that mitzvah in this halachah and begin offering directives for its fulfillment in Halachah 7.<br><b>[Our Sages] taught [the following] explanation of this mitzvah -</b> The Rambam appears to be referring to the <i>Sifre, Ekev</i> 11:22, which he quotes in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (ibid.). That explanation is also paralleled in the <i>Mechiltah</i> (Exodus 14:2  and <i>Shabbat</i> 133b.<br>It must be noted that other Talmudic and Midrashic sources interpret the commandment to imitate God in a different light. Note <i>Sotah</i> 14a:<br>[Deuteronomy 13:5 states]: ""You shall walk after God, your Lord."" Is it possible for man to walk after the Divine Presence? Has it not been stated: ""Behold, God, your Lord, is a consuming fire"" (Deuteronomy 4:24 ?Rather, [it means] one should follow the qualities of God.Just as He dresses the naked..., you, too, should dress the naked;God visited the sick...; you, too, should visit the sick;God comforted the bereaved...;you, too, should comfort the bereaved;God buried the dead...; you, too, should bury the dead.<br>In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam mentions emulating both God's deeds and His qualities. Similarly, <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, in its description of this mitzvah, and the <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> in his commentary - both here in <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> and also in <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> - mention both deeds and qualities.<br>There is not necessarily a contradiction between these two emphases. As mentioned above, our actions reflect our personalities. Therefore, it follows that developing our characters in the manner outlined by the Rambam in this halachah will ultimately produce the good deeds mentioned by our Sages in the passage from <i>Sotah</i>.<br>Nevertheless, deed is often not a reflection of character. A person with many severe character faults may still do good deeds. Hence, for the ""resemblance of God"" to be complete, it is not sufficient merely to perform positive deeds. Rather, a person must undergo internal change by developing his character. Therefore, the Rambam focuses more on this aspect of the commandment.<br><b>Just as He is called ""Gracious,"" you shall be gracious; Just as He is called ""Merciful,"" you shall be merciful; Just as He is called ""Holy,"" you shall be holy; -</b> Neither the <i>Sifre</i> nor the other sources quoted above mention the trait of holiness. Rather, the third trait mentioned is ""piety."" Perhaps, since the Rambam gave a specific definition for piety in the previous halachah within his conception of personality development, he does not mention it in the present context to prevent any possible confusion.<br><b>In a similar manner, the prophets -</b> The Rambam's choice of words is somewhat surprising since many of these expressions are also found in the Torah as well as in the prophetic works. However, in the Torah these titles are mentioned by Moses or the other prophets. Perhaps this is the Rambam's intent.<br><b>called God by other titles: ""Slow to anger,"" ""Abundant in kindness,"" ""Righteous,"" ""Just,"" ""Perfect,"" ""Almighty,"" ""Powerful,"" and the like. -</b> In <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:11-12 and in detail in <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> (Guide to the Perplexed), Vol. I, Chapters 53 and 54, the Rambam explains that these names are not descriptions of God, who cannot be defined by any specific quality. To do so would limit Him and detract from His infinite and transcendent state of being.<br>Rather, the use of these titles must be understood as follows: God brings about activities, which, had they been carried out by man, would have been motivated by these emotional states. For example, instead of utterly destroying the Jews after the sin of the Golden Calf, God allowed our people to continue. Were such a deed to have been performed by a human ruler, we would describe him as ""slow to anger."" Though that term cannot serve as a description for God - for He cannot be described - the Torah and the prophets referred to Him by such terms with the following intent.<br><b>[They did so] to inform us that these are good and just paths. -</b> i.e., God acted in ways which we identify with these qualities - and the Torah and the prophets mention these actions - because these are attributes which man should strive to achieve.<br><b>A person is obligated to accustom himself to these paths and [to try to] resemble Him - <i>Likkutei Sichot</i> (ibid.) states that with the latter phrase, the Rambam is adding a new thought.

The Rambam cannot accept this interpretation, because in <i>Hilchot Yesodei Torah</i> 5:4, he states that a person who is forced to serve false gods is not held liable for his deeds (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>The fact that a person is not held liable for such service does not at all minimize the seriousness of the prohibition involved. In no way is one allowed to serve false gods for such reasons. Even with regard to the Ra'avad's interpretation ""out of fear"" - i.e., out of fear of a person - the Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 150:3) prohibits performing any act that might be interpreted as idol worship - e.g., bowing to a ruler who is wearing an image.</i> [mentioned above], he is not held liable.<br>One who embraces a false deity, kisses it, sweeps before it, mops before it, washes it, anoints it, dresses it, places shoes upon it, or performs any similar act of deference violates a negative commandment, as <sup class=""footnote-marker"">9</sup><i class=""footnote"">This commandment is described in Halachot 2 and 3.</i> [implied by Exodus 20:5]: ""Do not serve them.""

It prohibits the worship of a false deity through its accepted modes of service, as stated in Halachah 2. This is a sin punishable by death. The same prohibition also forbids these expressions of affection or reverence. These deeds are not, however, punishable by death because they are not acts of worship.<br>Since violation of this prohibition incurs a penalty of execution, it is not associated with the punishment of lashes.

Thus, it appears that once a person performs a service which is the accepted mode of worship, his intent is no longer significant.<br>The <i>Pri Chadash</i> resolves this difficulty, explaining that the extent of liability is different.

Were these images forbidden, it would be unlikely that Moshe would have told the tribe to depict them. Even if the decree was instituted in the later generations, it is not probable that the Rabbis would forbid images that had previously been used for a Torah purpose.<br>The Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 141:3) quotes the Rambam's opinion. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 141:13 and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 141:8, however, note that the Rambam's statements which were quoted above (and the Ramah's statements) refer to a question whether one is allowed to keep images of the sun or moon that he finds. Here, the question is whether one is allowed to make such images oneself. From the discussion of the question in <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 43b, where the Sages question how Rabban Gamliel possessed forms of the moon, it would appear that there is a prohibition against making images of the sun and the moon themselves.<br>This interpretation, however, is also somewhat problematic, because the Rambam writes that there is no prohibition against making images of animals, and some of the constellations of the Zodiac are represented and referred to as animals. For example, one of the Zodiac constellations is a fish and <i>Gittin</i> 36a describes Rav as making a drawing of a fish. Another is a lion, which is one of the most popular images found in Jewish art.</i> or the angels, <sup class=""footnote-marker"">7</sup><i class=""footnote"">As the Rambam writes in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 2:3-5, the angels have no body or form.

It would appear, however, from the fact that making such images is not punishable by lashes, that the prohibition is only Rabbinic in nature. The reference to the verse must be understood as an <i>asmachta</i> (use of the Biblical verse as a support for a Rabbinic decree).</i> - i.e., do not make images of <sup class=""footnote-marker"">9</sup><i class=""footnote"">those who are ""with Me"" - i.e.,</i> My servants, those who serve before Me on high. This [prohibition] <sup class=""footnote-marker"">11</sup><i class=""footnote"">is more severe than the prohibition against making human images, and</i> applies even [to pictures] on tablets.<br>The <sup class=""footnote-marker"">12</sup><i class=""footnote"">According to the Rambam's statements in his Commentary on the Mishnah, the difference between the prohibition against making these images and those of humans can be explained as follows: The prohibition against making human statues is Biblical in origin and is defined by the Torah itself. In contrast, the prohibition of making images of the celestial beings was a safeguard instituted by the Rabbis against Greek and Roman culture. It, therefore, applies to all images, whether pictures or statues, because both could influence people to stray from the Torah's ways.<br>According to the simple interpretation of the terms ""sun"" and ""moon,"" the difference can be explained as follows: The sun and the moon, as we perceive them, appear against the background of the sky. Therefore, for a representation of them to be forbidden, it also need not protrude (<i>Tosafot, 14Avodah Zarah</i>, ibid.).</i> images of animals and other living beings <sup class=""footnote-marker"">13</sup><i class=""footnote"">with the exception of men - <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 42b also mentions a prohibition against making the image of a <i>d'rakon</i> which Rashi and others interpret as an animal similar to a serpent.</i> - with the exception of men - and similarly, the images of trees, grasses, and the like may be fashioned. This <sup class=""footnote-marker"">15</sup><i class=""footnote"">leniency</i> applies even to images which protrude. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">16</sup><i class=""footnote"">From these two halachot, particularly according to the Rambam's understanding as reflected in his Commentary on the Mishnah, we see that there is no conflict between Torah law and aesthetics. There are only two restrictions: realistic human statues (and according to some authorities, these must be complete, full-bodied statues) and depictions of pagan gods. Even according to the other opinions which forbid depictions of the sun, the moon, and the like, there is no prohibition against abstract portrayals of these entities. No other restrictions apply at all.<br>There is definitely a divergence between the approach to life that spawned much of the art forms of Western culture and a Torah lifestyle. Perhaps for that reason, many religious Jews have traditionally shunned participation in and patronage of the arts. In the present generation, however, a number of our Torah leaders have urged religious artists to dedicate themselves to expressing Torah ideas and values in a variety of art forms, explaining that:a) Through these media, it is possible to reach many Jews who might never enter a synagogue or Torah center;b) Everything in the world was created to be used by the Jews for a Torah purpose (Rashi, Genesis 1:1 . This also applies to art. Using these art forms for Torah purposes expresses the true intent for their creation and endows them with a depth of meaning and inspiration - and in its deepest sense, a new wellspring of creativity.<br>According to Kabbalah, God's presence is more manifest in the <i>sefirah</i> of <i>Tiferet</i> (""Beauty"") than in any other <i>sefirah</i>.

It is kosher.<br>All the above definitions were explained according to the oral tradition <sup class=""footnote-marker"">6</sup><i class=""footnote"">Indeed, in his introduction to his Commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam uses the definitions of the four species as examples of how the oral tradition is explained in the Talmud:The explanations which we have received from Moses are not contested at all.

Nor have we heard of a dispute that the ""covered tree"" refers to the myrtle...<br>Concerning these and the like, it has been said: ""The entire Torah, [both the mitzvot] in general, and all their particulars were given to Moses on Mount Sinai."" Though the tradition was received and there is no dispute about it, one can also derive these definitions through the accepted processes of exegesis.<br>Thus, when the Talmud debates and discusses a concept and offers a suggestion...that perhaps, ""the fruit of the beautiful tree"" is a pomegranate...[and does not resolve the matter] until they bring proof from the exegesis of the verse..., one should not conclude that the matter was left in doubt until this point of exegesis was discovered.<br>Rather, from the time of Joshua onward, we saw that the etrog was the species taken with the lulav and there is no debate about that.

If their desire for uniformity of observance was so great, why did they not establish a single practice in this regard as well?<br>He explains that the Sages were more reluctant to exercise their authority when they had to establish a new practice (קום ועשה) - celebrating an additional day as a festival - than when all that was necessary was to have the people refrain from the performance of a mitzvah (שב ועל תעשה), as in the case of the lulav.<br>Another concept can be derived from this halachah. The Hebrew word translated as Temple - מקדש - is used by the Rambam to refer to the entire city of Jerusalem. Thus, we can infer from the statement ""there is no longer a מקדש"" that this distinction is conferred on the holy city only while the Temple is standing.</i> as a point of distinction.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]"

Indeed, precisely because the source for the mitzvah is the oral tradition alone, the Sages made a point of allowing it to be observed on the Sabbath at least under such circumstances (Rabbenu Manoach).<br>The actual performance of the mitzvah on the Sabbath is described in the following halachah.</i> fact that [taking] them is a mitzvah.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]"

However, the <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> explains that, in comparison to containers made of other metals, golden ones are more beneficial in preserving the willows' freshness.</i> On the following morning, they would be placed next to the altar and the people would take them in the same manner as they did <sup class=""footnote-marker"">2</sup><i class=""footnote"">Note the commentary on the previous halachah.</i> each day.<br>Since the willow is not explicitly mentioned in <sup class=""footnote-marker"">3</sup><i class=""footnote"">The <i>Maggid Mishneh's</i> text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> reads: ""it is not explicitly [an obligation] from the Torah."" Accordingly, he and the other commentators debated whether the Rambam considers a halachah conveyed by Moses from Mt. Sinai as a Torah obligation or not. In <i>Hilchot Tum'at Meit</i> 2:10, the Rambam specifically states that a halachah conveyed by tradition has the power of Torah law.</i> the Torah, it is not taken on each of the seven days of the festival as a remembrance <sup class=""footnote-marker"">4</sup><i class=""footnote"">as is the lulav (Halachah 15).</i> of the Temple.

However, those who follow the first opinion (the Ra'avad, the Ramban, Rabbenu Asher) forbid the use of stolen species on the later days as well. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid.) quotes the Rambam, while the Ramah follows the other view.<br>[Though the above explanation is frequently used, it is difficult to accept.

The phrase ""for yourself"" implies that a person must own the species he uses for the mitzvah (<i>Sukkah</i> 41b).<br>As mentioned in Chapter 5, Halachah 25, a borrowed sukkah may be used on the holiday.

From the Rambam's phraseology, it appears that he includes all minors in this category. However, Rabbenu Nissim writes that a child of six or seven can transfer property and, hence, his return of the lulav is valid.<br>Support for Rabbenu Nissim's position is brought from the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:10), which relates that Rav Nachman bar Ya'akov gave his etrog as a present to his son and told him: ""When you take possession of it and fulfill the mitzvah, return it to me."" Nevertheless, the passage does not serve as conclusive proof, because the possibility exists that his son had already reached majority. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid. 6) follows the Rambam's view.</i> since, according to Torah law, a minor can acquire articles <sup class=""footnote-marker"">11</sup><i class=""footnote"">which are given to him by others who consciously desire that the minor acquire the property, in contrast to ownerless articles, which he cannot acquire according to Torah law (<i>Maggid Mishneh, Hilchot Zechiyah Umatanah</i> 4:7).</i> but cannot transfer them to others. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">12</sup><i class=""footnote"">The transfer of the ownership of an article requires a conscious decision.

Thus, the Rambam's statements seem to imply that any of the four species that are acquired only according to Rabbinic law may not be used for this mitzvah.<br>A very practical point can be derived from this concept. According to Torah law, property that is purchased changes ownership only after it has been paid for. The completion of a transaction when the property are taken by the purchaser (<i>meshichah</i>) is a Rabbinic institution. Accordingly, if a person purchased a lulav and etrog on the condition that he pay for it after the holiday - even though the seller willingly consented - the purchaser has only acquired the lulav and etrog according to Rabbinic law. Thus, based on this halachah, he would not be able to use it for the mitzvah.</i> above applies to the lulav and to each of the other species of the four taken with it. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">14</sup><i class=""footnote"">The verse quoted above includes all the four species, and not only the lulav.

Indeed, the Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 50b; see also the Rambam's commentary on the above-mentioned Mishnah) emphasizes that connection, quoting Isaiah 12:3: ""And you shall draw water with happiness."" However, here, the Rambam makes no mention of that water at all!<br>We are forced to say that the Rambam views the verse from Isaiah as a mere <i>asmachtah</i> (an allusion from the Bible with which our Sages connected a verse to an independent concept) and that the celebration came about because of the unique nature of the Sukkot festival. Though this celebration was associated with the water libation, the latter is not the source for the practice. Indeed, the choice of the name <i>Simchat Beit HaSho'evah</i> (the celebration of the house of drawing the water), and not <i>Simchat Hasho'evah</i> (the celebration of the drawing of the water) allows for such an interpretation. (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XVII).</i> as [Leviticus 23:40] commands: ""And you shall rejoice before God, your Lord, <sup class=""footnote-marker"">4</sup><i class=""footnote"">i.e., in the Temple</i> for seven <sup class=""footnote-marker"">5</sup><i class=""footnote"">Although this verse is used to derive the requirement of taking the lulav in Jerusalem for each of the seven days of the festival (Chapter 7, Halachah 13), its simple meaning remains.<br>Nevertheless, this charge is not considered to be an independent commandment, but rather an extension (and an intensification) of the mitzvah of celebrating on the festivals. Thus, in <i>Sefer Hamitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 54), the Rambam describes that mitzvah and explains that it includes ""to celebrate with musical instruments and to dance in the Temple....This is <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i>.""<br>This explanation resolves another question: <i>Mo'ed Kattan</i> 8b teaches that one celebration should not be interposed upon another. For this reason, weddings are not held during the festivals so that the wedding celebrations should not clash with those of the festival.<br>Thus, were one to consider the celebration of <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i> as associated with the water offering, one might ask why the Sages instituted such a celebration which might appear to overshadow the celebration of the festival itself.

Rabbi Akiva arose and constructed a sukkah on the ship's deck. The next morning, the wind came and blew it over. Rabban Gamliel asked Rabbi Akiva: ""Akiva, where is your Sukkah?""As apparent from the narrative, such a sukkah need not be strong enough to withstand sea winds.

He accepts Rabbi Yehudah's motivating principle, but explains that in the case at hand, there is no inherent difficulty with using such a sukkah throughout the holiday.

Therefore, it is permitted to use such a sukkah. His opinion is quoted by <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 628:7, and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 628:17, with one qualification. At the outset, it is desirable not to use an article as support for <i>s'chach</i> unless it is, itself, fit to be used as <i>s'chach</i>. Hence, since the trees themselves are not fit to be used as <i>s'chach</i>, they should not be used as its supports.</i> it on the festival, because climbing on a tree or animal <sup class=""footnote-marker"">6</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Beitzah</i> 5:2 relates:All the [prohibitions] which we are obligated [to observe as] <i>sh'vut</i>...on the Sabbath, we are obligated [to observe] on a festival.

Thus, were he allowed to leave chametz within his property, he might accidentally forget about the prohibition and eat it on Pesach (<i>Tosefot, Pesachim</i> 2a).<br>In addition to the restriction against possessing chametz, the Sages further expanded the scope of</i> [the <sup class=""footnote-marker"">2</sup><i class=""footnote"">to destroy chametz so that it</i> mitzvah involves] searching <sup class=""footnote-marker"">3</sup><i class=""footnote"">It must be emphasized that the obligation to search for chametz is Rabbinic in nature only when a person nullifies his chametz when required.

The Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 2:8) compares the matter to a servant who came to serve his master drink and the latter poured the pitcher in his face.<br><i>Tzafenat Paneach</i> explains that there is a fundamental difference between this law and the case of a person who is uncomfortable while in the sukkah. In the latter instance, in essence, the person is obligated to fulfill the mitzvah. However, because of his discomfort, his obligation is temporarily waived. In contrast, when rain descends it is impossible to fulfill the mitzvah at all, because the sukkah is not fit to dwell in. Hence, there is no obligation whatsoever.<br>There is a practical difference between these two abstract positions regarding the question whether a person is obligated to eat in the sukkah on the first night of the holiday even when it rains. (See the commentary on Halachah 7.) According to the <i>Tzafenat Paneach</i>, under these circumstances there is no mitzvah which one is required to fulfill. Thus, one may eat at home. In contrast, most authorities do not differentiate between rain and other uncomfortable situations. Thus, since eating in the sukkah on that night is a binding obligation, they require a person to fulfill the mitzvah.<br>There is a further aspect to this concept. The Maharil explains that a person who eats in a sukkah when he is not obligated to do so is a simple person and receives no reward for his ""piety."" On this basis, in many communities, people make no effort to stay in the sukkah when it rains. In contrast, there are some communities where people will continue to eat in the sukkah despite pouring rain.<br>What is the difference between these two approaches? The first approach follows the perspective that, during the rain, there is no mitzvah to dwell in the sukkah whatsoever. Hence, there is no need to strain oneself to remain there. In contrast, the second perspective does not differentiate between rain and any other uncomfortable circumstances, but maintains that, in essence, dwelling in the sukkah is a mitzvah even under such circumstances.

Since he explicitly states that the sukkah must be constructed for the purpose of shade, one might infer that the expression ""according to law"" is intended to include other concepts. Thus, it can be a reference to the requirements for a sukkah's size and the nature of the materials used for the <i>s'chach</i>, as mentioned in this and the previous chapter.</i> - even if it was not made for the purpose of [fulfilling] the mitzvah - if it was made according to law, it is kosher. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">2</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 1:1, states:An old sukkah: The School of Shammai deems it unacceptable, while the School of Hillel rules it kosher.The commentaries explain that the term ""an old sukkah"" refers to any sukkah that was constructed for purposes other than the fulfillment of the mitzvah.<br>In its discussion of this law, the Jerusalem Talmud requires that one must make an addition or change to the <i>s'chach</i>. Though that decision is not quoted by the Rambam, Rabbenu Asher mentions it and it is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 636:1).

Similarly, when a person hollows out a place in a heap of produce and thus makes a sukkah, it is not considered to be a sukkah, <sup class=""footnote-marker"">7</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Sukkot</i> 12a explains that there is an added factor involved in this example. Deuteronomy 16:13 states: ""Make a [celebration of] the Sukkot holiday for seven days."" This refers to the construction of the sukkah and teaches that we must ""make"" a sukkah and not use what was already made. Therefore, despite the fact that the person hollowed out the space for the purpose of shade, the sukkah is not acceptable, because the produce was not originally placed there for that purpose.<br>We find a similar principle concerning <i>tzitzit</i>. Deuteronomy 22:12 states: ""Make yourself tassels on the four corners of your garments."" On the basis of this command, <i>Menachot</i> 40b teaches that it is unacceptable to tie <i>tzitzit</i> to a three-cornered garment and then cut a fourth corner, since we are required to make <i>tzitzit</i>, and not use what is already made.</i> because the produce was not piled there for this purpose. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">8</sup><i class=""footnote"">The <i>Ba'al Hamaor</i> writes that if, originally, a person were to pile produce with the intention that later he would hollow out a sukkah, the sukkah would be acceptable.

<i>s'chach</i>, because elements that are bound naturally are not considered to be bundles. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">4</sup><i class=""footnote"">The <i>Ba'al Hamaor</i> questions whether this principle applies only with regard to <i>s'chach</i>, where it is logical to assume that a more lenient position would be taken, since the entire question revolves around a Rabbinic decree, or whether it also applies in all cases where Torah law itself requires a bundle.</i> Furthermore, even if one tied the tops of the branches from one side, and they thus appear to be a single bundle with one of its two ends bound naturally and the other bound as a result of human activity, it may be used as <i>s'chach</i>. A single tree which is bound up is not considered to be a bundle, but rather a single piece of wood, since [the branches] are bound together <sup class=""footnote-marker"">5</sup><i class=""footnote"">However, if one were to add even one branch and then tie them together, it would be considered to be a bundle (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 629:15).</i> naturally.<br>Similarly, any knot which is not strong enough to hold when carried is not considered a knot [and the resulting bundle may be used as <i>s'chach</i>]. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">6</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Sukkah</i> 13b mentions this principle when explaining why bundles of willows whose upper tie was loosened could be used as <i>s'chach</i>.</i>","[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.12","A person who constructs his sukkah under a tree is considered as though he built it within his <sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">and the sukkah is unacceptable. This applies only when the shade the tree produces exceeds the open area. However, if there is more open space under the tree than shade, the sukkah may be kosher.<br>The determination of whether such a sukkah is kosher depends on a number of principles, based on the interpretation of <i>Sukkah</i> 9b and 11a. The Rambam's interpretation of that passage, and thus the ground rules he establishes, differ from those accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 626:1-2).<br>In the following halachah, the Rambam deals with the resolution of the question when no effort has been made to correct the problem of the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i>. As will be explained, there his interpretation is contested by other authorities. In this halachah, the Rambam describes the rulings which govern the situation when an effort has been made to rectify the situation by detaching the branches from their source of nurture. These are based on the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 11a, and are also accepted by other Rabbinic authorities. (See the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 626:2.)</i> home.<br>If one draped the leaves and branches of trees [over the sukkah], and then placed <i>s'chach</i> over them, and only afterwards detached them, <sup class=""footnote-marker"">2</sup><i class=""footnote"">As mentioned in Halachot 1 and 2, branches are fit to be used for <i>s'chach</i> only after they have been detached from their source of nurture.</i> [the following rules apply:]<br>If the amount of [kosher] <i>s'chach</i> exceeded [the branches], it is kosher. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">4</sup><i class=""footnote"">Though at present, the branches would be acceptable as <i>s'chach</i>, as explained in the commentary on Halachah 9, the Torah requires that when <i>s'chach</i> is originally put in place, it must be kosher. Otherwise, it is unacceptable even though steps were taken to correct the disqualifying factors. This is based on the principle that one must make a sukkah and not use one which is already made.<br>Nevertheless, since the prohibition against using these branches as <i>s'chach</i> does not relate to their essential nature, their presence may be nullified when there is a majority of kosher <i>s'chach</i>. This conforms to the principle of ביטול ברב.</i> If the amount of <i>s'chach</i> which originally was kosher did not exceed [the branches], <sup class=""footnote-marker"">5</sup><i class=""footnote"">the presence of the branches remains halachically significant.

Furthermore, even the blessing <i>borey pri ha'adamah</i> is not recited, because generally people do not eat flour (Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi, See also <i>Berachot</i> 36a).1. I.e., it resembles a porridge.2. Because of the importance of the five species of grain, the Sages ordained the recitation of a special blessing before and after partaking of them. Since this mixture is considered a food and not a beverage, it warrants the recitation of these blessings.3. Since this mixture is considered a beverage and not a food, it does not warrant the recitation of these blessings. 4. <i>Berachot</i> 37b relates that any food that is made from the five species of grain but is not considered bread requires the blessing <i>al hamichyah</i>. Since these foods are cooked in a pot, they are not considered bread. See also note 6.5. Since the grain kernels have been processed slightly, they are considered worthy of the special blessings ordained for foods from the five species. As mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 2, the later authorities suggest that the grains be cooked to the point that they stick together as a single mass before these blessings should be recited. If, however, both the shell of the kernel has been removed and they have been crushed, the blessing <i>al hamichyah</i> may be recited even when the kernels do not stick together (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 208:15).6. As mentioned in Halachah 6, as long as the grain is included to add flavor, it is considered the primary element in the mixture, and the blessing <i>al hamichyah</i> should be recited, even though quantitatively, the dish contains a majority of other substances. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 208:2.) 7. The definition of foods as primary and secondary depends on the person's intention and not the quantity of the foods included in the mixture.8. This principle is quoted from the Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 6:7.9. Thus producing a single food, as exemplified in Halachah 6.10. In this instance, the two foods remain separate, yet the secondary food is included in the blessing recited over the primary one, as exemplified in Halachah 7. 11. The Rambam is quoting <i>Berachot</i> 39a, which states that this law applies even to turnips that require a large amount of flour.12. <i>Beitzah</i> 38a states, ""Anything added for flavor is never considered negligible.""<br>The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 204:25 and the <i>Chacham Tzvi</i> (Responsum 129) explain that the Rambam's (and the Talmud's) statements apply only to products from the five species of grain. Whenever they are added to flavor foods, they are considered of primary importance even when, quantitatively, they are less than the other ingredients of a particular dish. In contrast, when two or more types of foods other than grain products are mixed together in a single dish and both are intended to add flavor and/or satiate the person eating, the food which is greater in quantity is considered as the primary ingredient.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> adds that if the starch was added for flavor, the mixture would require the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i>. He continues, explaining that when other foods - e.g., fruits which are not usually eaten raw, are cooked in sugar to produce jam, the fruits are considered of primary importance. Hence, the blessing <i>borey pri ha'etz</i> should be recited. See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 204:11. 14. By adding the clause, ""so that the heavy brine...,"" the Rambam explains the source for this ruling, <i>Berachot</i> 6:7, and clarifies a problem posed by the commentaries.<br>Although the Mishnah mentions the example of bread serving as a secondary food when it accompanies salted foods, the Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 44a) protests, and explains that in almost all situations bread would be considered the primary food. The Mishnah is describing a specific instance: people who eat fruit that originates in the area around Lake Kineret.<br>In his Commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam explains that this refers to people who work as watchmen in orchards. They eat large quantities of fruit. Hence, in order to help their digestion, they also must partake of brine. Since the brine itself could be harmful, they eat bread with it.<br>Here, also, the Rambam is referring to a case where the person has no desire to eat bread and does so only to protect his throat. If, however, a person wanted to eat salted fish on bread and desired both the bread and the fish, he must recite the blessing <i>hamotzi</i> and recite grace. (See <i>Turei Zahav</i> 212:1-2.)<br><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 212:2 gives another example: A person who eats bread to weaken the taste of an alcoholic beverage. 16. A <i>k'zayit</i>. In contemporary measure, it is equivalent to 28.8 cc according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i> and 33 cc according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>.17. Out of faithfulness to the Rambam's text, we have translated his words literally, although they have caused the commentaries great difficulty. On the surface, there is an open contradiction between the first clause and the second clause. From the first clause, it appears that a piece of bread less than the size of an olive which resembles bread warrants the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>. In contrast, the latter clause appears to indicate that the bread must both be the size of an olive and have the appearance of bread to warrant the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>.<br>Because of this difficulty, the Radbaz (Vol. V, Responsum 1393) and <i>Sefer HaBatim</i> have suggested amending the text and rendering the latter clause, ""If they are not the size of an olive and no longer resemble bread because of the cooking process."" Furthermore, even without amending the text, this interpretation can be accepted, since, as the Rambam's own descendant, Rabbi Yehoshua, explains, there are times when the Hebrew או can be rendered as ""if."" Thus, the passage would read, ""If they are not the size of an olive, if....""<br>Rav Yosef Karo was aware of the text's difficulty and the suggestions to amend it. Nevertheless, both in his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 168:10), he seeks to justify the Rambam's choice of phraseology, explaining his statements as follows:<br>When one cooked pieces of bread or mixed them into soup, if they are the size of an olive, one should recite the blessing <i>hamotzi</i> although they no longer resemble bread. If they are less than the size of an olive but resemble bread, one should recite this blessing when they have been mixed into soup. If, however, they have been cooked, and although it is obvious that these pieces came from a loaf of bread, they no longer have the appearance of bread, only the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> should be recited.<br>To summarize: when one breaks bread into pieces and puts them into soup, since the pieces still resemble bread they may not be eaten unless one recites the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>. If the pieces of bread were cooked completely to prepare a different food and less than a <i>k'zayit</i> remains whole, the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> should be recited. According to most authorities, if one cooks with bread crumbs or matzah meal, the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i>, should be recited on the foods produced.</i> should recite the blessing <i>borey nefashot rabbot</i>.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]"

Fasts 1.1,"It is a positive Torah commandment <sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">See <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 59), which mentions this in the reckoning of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.<br>Significantly, however, the Rambam's appreciation of this mitzvah differs in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> from that in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>. To explain: Following the verse quoted here by the Rambam as a proof-text, the Torah continues [Numbers 10:10]: ""On the days of your rejoicing, on your festivals, and on your new moon [celebrations], you shall sound the trumpets for your burnt offerings and for your peace offerings.""<br>In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam writes:We are commanded to sound the trumpets in the Temple when offering sacrifices that are offered only at appointed times.... [Also,] we are commanded to sound the trumpets at a time of distress and difficulty when we pray to Him.In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (and similarly in <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, Mitzvah 384), the emphasis of the mitzvah is clearly on the sounding of the trumpets during the sacrifices. In the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, when listing the 613 mitzvot at the beginning of the text, the Rambam mentions the sounding of the trumpets both for the sacrifices and in times of distress. Nevertheless, further on in the beginning of the text, when delineating the mitzvot according to subjects, he places the emphasis on crying out to God at a time of distress (seemingly, including crying out verbally and crying out with the trumpets in the same mitzvah). Significantly, in <i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i>, Chapter 3, where the Rambam mentions the practice of sounding the trumpets in connection with the offering of the sacrifices, he does not mention it as a component of this or any other specific mitzvah.<br>(Note also the commentary of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, which questions why these two different rites were included as a single mitzvah at the outset. Even in the Torah, they are included in two separate verses.)</i> to cry <sup class=""footnote-marker"">2</sup><i class=""footnote"">in prayer.

It is questionable whether it was necessary for them to be silver outside the Temple as well.<br>See also the Ramban (<i>Drashot l'Rosh HaShanah</i>), who mentions an opinion that the shofar, and not a trumpet, should be sounded in time of communal distress. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> also notes this opinion and states that either instrument, a shofar or a trumpet, is acceptable, but that - outside of the Temple premises - only one of the two should be used in time of distress. Some support for this position can be drawn from Halachah 6.</i> to sound trumpets in the event of any difficulty that arises which affects the community, as [Numbers 10:9] states: ""[When you go out to war... against] an enemy who attacks you and <sup class=""footnote-marker"">5</sup><i class=""footnote"">As obvious from Halachah 4, this practice was observed throughout <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, and not only in the Temple. Nor is its observance dependent on the existence of the Temple, nor does the Rambam specify that it must be fulfilled only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. (In this regard, there are differing opinions; see <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 576:1) Accordingly, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 576:1 questions: Why is the rite of sounding the trumpets (or shofarot) not observed at present?<br>The resolution of this question lies in the Rambam's words, ""any difficulty that arises which affects the community."" This rite should not be observed when an individual, or even a group of individuals, are in distress, but only when a ""community"" is affected.<br><i>Pesachim</i> 54b explains that communal fasts are possible only within <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. There is no concept of taking such a unified communal act of this nature in the diaspora. Therefore, this mitzvah was not relevant in all the generations of our people's existence in the diaspora. (See also the <i>Drashot l'Rosh HaShanah</i> of the Ramban.)<br>A question arises, however, with regard to the situation at present, with the renewal of the Jewish settlement in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. As explained in the commentary on Chapter 3, Halachah 11, there are opinions (see the gloss of the <i>Birkei Yosef</i> to the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 575) that maintain that at present, the concept of community also applies in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<br>According to this view, without entering into the discussion regarding the halachic status of the present government, it would appear that it would be proper for this mitzvah to be observed, since its observance is not dependent on the Temple.</i> you sound the trumpets....""<br>[This commandment is not restricted <sup class=""footnote-marker"">6</sup><i class=""footnote"">i.e., it does not apply to war alone, as might be understood from the verse.</i> to such a limited scope; rather] the intent is: <sup class=""footnote-marker"">7</sup><i class=""footnote"">e.g., famine, plague - Note <i>Ta'anit</i> 22b, which states that the trumpets should not be sounded in the case of a plague even during the week. Since a plague is a very severe matter, were the trumpets to be sounded during the week, they might also be sounded when a plague took place on the Sabbath, and thus a prohibition would be violated. The Rambam discusses this question in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Ta'anit</i> 3:3). Similarly, in Chapter 2, Halachah 1, the Rambam rules that the trumpets are sounded when a plague occurs.</i> Whenever you are distressed by difficulties - <sup class=""footnote-marker"">8</sup><i class=""footnote"">i.e., circumstances that cause distress to the community as a whole.</i> e.g., famine, plague, locusts, or the like - cry out [to <sup class=""footnote-marker"">9</sup><i class=""footnote"">See <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 2:6, where the Rambam gives the assurance that if the Jews cry out to God as a community, He will surely heed their prayers.</i> God] because of them and sound the trumpets.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]"

The intent is a single request that Israel be granted the ultimate comfort, the rebuilding of Jerusalem.4. Rashi, <i>Berachot</i> 48b, mentions another reason for the mention of the House of David. It was David who conquered Jerusalem and established the holiness of the city. 5. Since an integral element of our celebration of the Sabbath and festivals is eating festive meals, the sacred element of the day should be mentioned in the grace recited after partaking of those meals. Nevertheless, the uniqueness of the day does not require a blessing in its own right, nor is it made the essential element of the third blessing. Therefore, one begins and concludes that blessing in the same manner as is done during the week (Rashi, <i>Tosafot, Berachot</i> 48b).6. The order in which these alternatives are mentioned in this halachah is the reverse of that mentioned in the previous halachah. It can be explained that in the previous halachah, the Rambam mentioned the text he considered most appropriate first. The order he mentions in this halachah, however, is closer to the expression used by our Sages in <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the source for this halachah.7. Pesach, Shavuot, and Sukkot. With regard to Rosh HaShanah, see the commentary on Halachah 13.8. <i>Shabbat</i> 24a explains that since an additional sacrifice (<i>korban musaf</i>) is offered on these days, they possess an element of sanctity that is worthy of mention. As obvious from the contrast of Halachah 12 to Halachah 13, however, there is a difference between the obligation to mention these days and the obligation to mention Sabbaths and festivals. 9. Since Chanukah and Purim are Rabbinic holidays which are not associated with an additional sacrificial offering, they are not mentioned in the third blessing. The second blessing is more appropriate for the mention of the miracles of these holidays, since it is an expression of thanks to God (<i>Shabbat</i> 24a).<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> note that from <i>Shabbat</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), it would appear that while permission is granted to mention Chanukah and Purim in the second blessing, it is not an obligation to do so. In contrast, the Rambam requires that they be mentioned. They explain that since the Sages of the Talmud were wont to mention these holidays in grace, and the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 7:6) considers their mention a binding obligation, the Rambam established their mention as a requirement. See also Halachah 13 and commentary.10. Precedence is given to the Sabbath because it occurs more frequently than the festivals and is on a higher spiritual level (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). 11. ""Blessed are You, God, our Lord, 16King13 of the Universe, the God, who is our Father and our 16King13... the 16King13 who is good."" The reason for this stress on God's sovereignty in this blessing is that the blessing recited previously mentions the sovereignty of the House of David, and the Sages wanted to emphasize how all earthly kings are subordinate to a higher authority (<i>Berachot</i> 49a).12. The blessing mentioned is quoted from <i>Berachot</i> 46a. That source also contains additions to the blessing that Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi would recite. 13. The Rambam's words are quoted from <i>Berachot</i> 46b, which relates that Mar Zutra recited this blessing.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 379:14) relates that this blessing should be recited throughout the seven days of mourning by the mourners and by all who recite grace together with him when there is a <i>zimun</i>. Other opinions (based on <i>Ketubot</i> 8a) state that this blessing should be recited only when ten people recite grace together. The <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 207:7 writes that it is Ashkenazic custom to rely on this opinion, and hence, this blessing is generally not recited.14. <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) relates several additions Mar Zutra made on the above occasion.15. In ""The Order of Prayers for the Entire Year,"" the Rambam includes several requests beginning with the word <i>Harachaman</i> (May the Merciful One...) in his text of grace. These requests were additions to the grace made by the Geonim, who lived in the era subsequent to the Talmud. 16. This refers to the final blessing quoted in Halachah 11.17. <i>Nisu'in</i> (marriage) is marked by the entry of a bride and groom into a private chamber together. This ceremony is referred to as <i>chuppah</i> and is accompanied by a celebration. See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i>, Chapter 10, and commentaries.<br>As mentioned at the conclusion of the following halachah, according to the Rambam this blessing is recited only when ten adult males are present. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 62:4) differs and maintains that it should be recited even when fewer than ten people are present. Note the Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 62:7) who states that today this blessing is never recited alone. If ""new faces"" - people who had not attended the wedding celebrations previously - are present, all seven blessings are recited. If no ""new faces"" are present (although ten males are), the meal is considered like a meal eaten by the bridegroom alone, and the blessing is not recited.18. The same laws applying to a widow or widower apply to a person who has been divorced. Significantly, in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 10:12, the Rambam states that even if a woman has been married before, her husband should celebrate with her for three days.19. Surely, this also applies when neither the bride nor groom have been married before. <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states: ""The Sages ordained that everyone who marries a maiden should celebrate with her for seven days.""<br>The differences between the time limits mentioned in this halachah and those mentioned in Chapter 5, Halachah 5, are worthy of comparison. See the commentary on that halachah.20. <i>Ketubot</i> 8a states that after the first day of the wedding celebrations, Rav Ashi would recite the wedding blessings only when ""new faces"" were present. In his responsa, the Rambam's son states that his father required only two ""new faces."" Note the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 64:7 who requires only one ""new face."" The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> write that on the Sabbath the presence of new guests is not necessary, since the Sabbath itself is considered as ""guests.""21. <i>Ketubot</i> 7b derives this rule from the account of the wedding between Ruth and Boaz. Ruth 4:2 relates that Boaz invited ten men to witness the marriage. 22. Only six blessings are mentioned below; the seventh blessing is the blessing over the wine. (See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 10:4.)23. Rashi (<i>Ketubot</i> 7b) explains that this blessing is in praise of the creation of Adam, the first man.<br>In <i>Hilchot Ishut</i>, where the text of the wedding blessings is repeated, this blessing follows the blessing ""who has created all things for His glory."" This order is the sequence in which these blessings are recited today. It appears more appropriate, particularly according to Rashi's commentary (<i>loc. cit.</i>), which explains that the blessing ""who has created all things..."" is not directly connected to the wedding itself, but rather is recited in appreciation of the guests who have come to celebrate together with the new couple.<br>[The repetition of the text of the blessings in two separate halachot, something very out of character for the Rambam in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, has aroused the attention of the commentaries. Some have gone so far as to suggest that the text of the blessings here was added by the printers, and not by the Rambam himself.]24. Despite the fact that this blessing follows two (or three) blessings which begin with ""Blessed...,"" it also begins with ""Blessed...."" Among the explanations offered is that the first blessings are short, and if the line ""Blessed..."" were not mentioned, they would appear as a single blessing (<i>Tosafot, Ketubot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>).25. Rashi (<i>loc. cit.</i>) interprets this as a reference to the creation of woman, who was created from man (""his own self""), and gives him the potential for reproduction (""a structure that will last for all time"").26. ""The barren one"" refers to Jerusalem. Psalms 137:6 states: ""Let my tongue cleave to my palate if I do not place Jerusalem above my highest joy."" Thus, at the height of the wedding celebration, we recall the holy city and pray that it be rebuilt. 27. This is a prayer that the bride and groom enjoy the happiness experienced by Adam in Eve before the first sin.<br>Several manuscripts and early printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> mention a different conclusion for this blessing, ""Blessed are You, God, who brings joy to His people, Israel, and rebuilds Jerusalem."" (In this context, note the commentary of the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>.)28. The blessing joins our wishes for the happiness of the particular couple with our hope for the Messianic redemption and the rebuilding of Jerusalem. The ultimate marriage relationship is the bond between God and the Jewish people, which will be realized in the Messianic age. Thus, the two themes, marriage and redemption, share an intrinsic link.29. Rashi, <i>Ketubot</i> 8a, explains the difference between the last two blessings. The fifth of the blessings concludes with a request that the bride and groom enjoy a lifetime of happiness and success together. The sixth and final blessing concludes with a request that they find happiness in each other, that their wedding joy be extended throughout their lives. Alternatively, the final blessing is a blessing for the Jewish people as a whole who find fulfillment in married life.</i> states: ""You are standing... to establish a covenant.""","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]"

The rabbis did not want to translate the Torah into the languages which the people did understand, because of the possibility of error and misinterpretation. Such fears had not existed in regard to the Aramaic translation, since it had been composed with <i>Ruach Hakodesh</i> (Divine inspiration).<br>[The <i>Tur</i>, however, also mentions the opinion of Rav Natrunai Gaon, who maintains that the translation should be done freely, so that the people can understand, without referring to the traditional text.]<br>The <i>Tur</i>'s opinion is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 145:3) and in nearly all contemporary Jewish communities, the custom of using a translator during the Torah reading is no longer practiced.

Rabbenu Nissim maintains that this prohibition only applied before Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi permitted the oral tradition to be recorded. Afterwards, it was permitted for the translator to use a written text. Rabbenu Nissim's position is somewhat difficult to accept, since the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Megillah</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>), the source for this law, was written several hundred years after Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi granted this leniency. Nevertheless, Rabbenu Nissim's view was widely accepted.4. The <i>Tosefta, Megillah</i> 3:21, cites the example of Aharon, who served as a spokesman for Moses. See also <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>.5.

The Ra'avad maintains that, generally, the fact that a borrower does not specify that the security would retroactively become the lender's property implies that he never really intended to sell it to him and always considers it as his own. Thus, were such a transaction to be carried out between Jews, the Ra'avad maintains that the security would never become the lender's property. However, he explains that this law applies only regarding business dealings carried out between Jews, and not to those involving gentiles. Therefore, in this instance, the chametz given as security becomes the gentile's property.<br>In contrast, the Rambam does not consider such an agreement an <i>Asmachtah</i>.

However, if he fails to so, they allow people to rely on the Ra'avad's opinion and benefit from the chametz.<br>Different laws apply to chametz given to a Jew as security by a gentile or by another Jew. In the former instance, a Jew is considered the owner of the chametz if the agreement included the clause specifying retroactive ownership, even though the time for payment is not fixed until after Pesach. If the agreement lacked that clause, and the Jew is not held responsible for the chametz (see Halachah 3 above), the Jew is not liable for that chametz (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>).

These views are quoted as halachah by the <i>Turei Zahav</i> and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> in their glosses on the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 110:8).<br>Among the suggestions made by the commentaries to resolve the difference between the Rambam's statements here and those in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> are the following:a) Most people are careful regarding the prohibition against benefiting from any object connected with idol worship. Therefore, there is no need to reinforce the prohibition. In contrast, the prohibition against benefiting from a דבר חשוב is far less known. Hence, the Rabbis added severe safeguards to make sure that it be observed (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).b) Here, the Rambam is speaking about a prohibition against benefiting from a forbidden object (איסור הנאה). In contrast, <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> is concerned with partaking of forbidden foods, where the prohibition is more severe (<i>Siftei Cohen</i>, <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 110:52).<br>Even the authorities who permit the second mixture to be used do not allow a single individual to partake of the entire mixture at one time. In such an instance, there would be only a single doubt whether he used the forbidden object or not.<br>The Rabbis (<i>Zevachim</i>, 74b) mentioned another example of a mixture which is permitted because of circumstances which create a doubt whether our original suspicion continues to apply:<br><b>Should a ring [used to adorn] an idol become mixed together with one hundred other rings, and -</b> they would thus all be forbidden according to the above principles.

The prohibition does not continue to apply, because<br><b>We presume that the [forbidden] ring was among the two -</b> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that when stating a similar law in <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 15:2, the Rambam required only a single barrel of wine to be lost.

In contrast, barrels of wine are large, and the loss of even one will attract attention.<br>[which fell]. - The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 140) limits this leniency, stating that it is forbidden to use a single ring alone, nor may one person benefit from the entire group of rings at once.<br>The Rabbis (<i>Zevachim</i>, ibid.) mentioned a third example of a mixture which is permitted because of circumstances which create a doubt whether our original suspicion continues to apply:<br><b>Should [a forbidden ring] become mixed together with a hundred others and -</b> they would thus be forbidden according to the above principles.

He explains that this is because this blessing is also often recited in isolation, before the reading of the Torah in the synagogue.<br>The recitation of the blessings of the Torah is very important. <i>Bava Metzia</i> 85a states that Eretz Yisrael was destroyed because the Jews forsook the Torah.

In the previous clause, he stated that one must recite three verses - one from the Torah, one from the prophets, and one from the writings - to fulfill one's obligation, while this clause implies that the recitation of one is sufficient.<br>The source for the difficulty is the following quotes: The Mishnah, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 32a, states:One should not recite fewer than ten verses for <i>Malchuyot</i>, ten for <i>Zichronot</i>, and ten for <i>Shofarot</i>. Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri says: ""If one recites three - three of each - one fulfills his obligation.""<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 35a quotes Rav Chanan'el as saying in the name of Rav:Even if he states: ""In Your Torah, it is written..."" [and recites one verse], nothing further is necessary.From the Talmud, it appears that both these statements are accepted as halachah. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam interprets Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri's requirement of three verses as the total for all three blessings. Thus, for each blessing, one must state ""In Your Torah, it is written..."" and recite a single appropriate verse. [This surely differs from the Rambam's statements in his commentary on the Mishnah.]<br>The Ramban, Rabbenu Nissim, and others explain that Rav Chanan'el agrees with Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri and thus, in addition to ""In Your Torah, it is written...,"" he also requires one to say: ""In Your holy writings, it is recorded...,"" and: ""by your prophets, it was proclaimed...,"" mentioning an appropriate verse in each instance. (This opinion is quoted by <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 586:8 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 591:11.)<br>Alternatively, one may explain the Rambam's position as follows: Ideally, one should recite ten verses for each blessing; after the fact, three are sufficient, as stated by Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri. When does this apply? Once one has recited at least one verse from the Torah. However, if one has not recited any verses, it is sufficient to say ""In Your Torah, it is written..."" and recite a single verse from the Torah, as Rav Chanan'el said in the name of Rav.<br>The flexibility regarding the number of quotes in each blessing was only granted in the previous generations.

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> (<i>Hilchot Edut</i>) differentiates between eating in a crowded place - which is forbidden for everyone - and eating in a quiet corner - which is deemed improper only for a Sage. The <i>Bach</i> (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 34) explains that a common person is censored only for eating while walking through the market place, while the wise man should not eat in public even while standing in one place.<br>Nevertheless, it must be noted that in this halachah, the Rambam uses the expression <i>chacham</i> (a wise man), his ideal for a person with a developed personality, and not <i>talmid chacham</i> (a Torah Sage).

Modesty is not simply a matter of dress, (this is discussed in halachah 9), but rather, an awareness of God which causes a person to cover head and body out of respect for the Divine Presence. The Rambam expands upon this concept in the <i>Guide for the Perplexed</i> (Vol. III, Chapter 52):<br>He is constantly with us, observing us, as [Jeremiah 23:24] proclaims: 'Can a man hide himself in the secret places and I not see him,' says God.""

The ordinary man experiences such awareness while at prayer when ""he is as if standing before the Divine Presence"" (<i>Hilchot Tefilah</i> 4:16) and then he is required not to bare his head (ibid. 5:5) or various parts of his body; e.g., his chest (ibid. 4:7) and his feet (ibid. 5:5).

Shearing involves removing hair or wool from an animal, whether dead or alive. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 7.)<br><b>whitening -</b> After the wool is removed from the animal, it is washed to remove dirt. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 10.)<br><b>beating -</b> Unlike Rashi and others who interpret as combing the wool, in the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah he translates the word into an Arabic term meaning ""beat it with a stick."" This activity is necessary as a preliminary stage of the preparation of flax to be spun into linen. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 12.)<br><b>dyeing -</b> for most of the fabrics used in the curtains and roof-coverings of the Sanctuary were dyed. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 13.)<br><b>spinning -</b> intertwining the fibers to make thread. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 15.)<br><b>making heddles -</b> The Hebrew, literally means ""house of string."" In the weaving process, it refers to the following practice: Weaving involves passing the threads of the woof over and under each of the consecutive threads of the warp. In order to facilitate this process, two frames are made, each possessing many threads with a loop (referred to as a ""heddle"") in the middle of these threads. The threads of the warp are passed through these loops, one from one frame, and the next from the other, consecutively. When this is completed, the weaver lifts the two frames alternately. As he raises one up, he passes the woof through. In this manner, he is able to thread the woof through the entire warp at one time. (See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Shabbat</i> 7:2; <i>Keilim</i> 21:1.)<br><b>mounting the warp -</b> See Chapter 9, Halachah 17-18, where the Rambam describes how a loom is set up. First, the threads of the warp are extended to the desired length and width. They are then attached to a rod on either side, and held taut. This is the activity referred to by this term.<br><b>weaving -</b> passing the threads of the woof between the threads of the warp. (See Chapter 9, <i>loc. cit.</i>)<br><b>undoing woven fabric -</b> See Chapter 9, Halachah 20.<br><b>tying -</b> This refers to a permanent knot whose tying requires professional expertise. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 1.) In the construction of the Sanctuary, the <i>chilazon</i> which were used for dye were caught with nets that had to be tied (<i>Shabbat</i> 74b).<br><b>untying -</b> This also includes untying only such knots. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 7.)<br><b>sewing -</b> at least two stitches. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 9.)<br><b>tearing -</b> in order to sew. Otherwise, one is not liable. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 10.) If a hole was found in one of the curtains of the Sanctuary, it was cut open and sewn close (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 302:4).<br><b>building -</b> any structure; similarly, leveling the ground is included in this category. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 12.) The <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> gives as an example, the placement of the boards of the Sanctuary in their sockets.<br><b>demolishing -</b> Here also the intent must be a constructive one: demolishing in order to rebuild. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 15.)<br><b>beating with a hammer -</b> The <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> points to the fashioning of the <i>menorah</i> in the Sanctuary.<br>A craftsman finishing the fashioning of a utensil concludes his work by giving several taps with a hammer to smooth the utensil's surface. Thus, this labor also includes all activities performed to apply the finishing touch to an object - e.g., polishing and shining. (See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>loc. cit.,</i> and Chapter 10, Halachah 16.)<br><b>trapping -</b> The Mishnah mentions the following seven categories as activities necessary to write a scroll. Leather hides were used to cover the roof of the Sanctuary. (See also Chapter 10, Halachah 19.)<br><b>slaughtering -</b> Although this term is usually used to refer to ritual slaughter, the intent here is taking a life through any means. (See Chapter 11, Halachah 1.)<br><b>skinning -</b> the hide of an animal to use for leather. (See Chapter 11, Halachah 5.)<br><b>processing [hides] -</b> into leather. (See Chapter 11, <i>loc. cit.</i>) Significantly, the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 7:2) also includes salting the hides as a separate category of labor. <i>Shabbat</i> 75b, however, includes this activity in the category of processing hides and includes ruling parchment as the thirty-ninth category of labor.<br><b>removing hair -</b> For leather or parchment, smooth skin is required. (See also Chapter 11, Halachah 5, 6.)<br><b>cutting [leather] -</b> This refers to making an exact cut, so that the leather can be used for a purpose. Cutting indiscriminately is a destructive activity. Hence, one is not held liable. (See Chapter 11, Halachah 7.)<br><b>writing -</b> two letters. This activity was necessary in the Sanctuary, for a mark was made on the boards so that the same boards could be matched to each other each time they were attached together. (See Chapter 11, Halachah 9.)<br><b>erasing -</b> For if the builders of the Sanctuary erred in making a sign, they would erase it and write another in its place. In this instance as well, one is held liable only when one erases with the intent of writing two letters in this place. (See Chapter 11, <i>loc. cit.</i>)<br><b>ruling lines -</b> For proper writing is possible only on ruled lines. (See Chapter 11, Halachah 17.) In the Sanctuary, this labor was performed to prepare the hides to be cut.<br><b>kindling a flame -</b> This was necessary to cook the dyes. As the Rambam explains in Chapter 12, Halachah 1, one is liable for kindling a flame only when when desires to cook with it, use it for light, or desires ash. Otherwise, it is considered a destructive activity.<br><b>extinguishing a flame -</b> Here also, one's intent must be constructive - e.g., to use the charcoal produced. In the Sanctuary, this was necessary to produce an even flame for the fashioning of the metal utensils (See Chapter 12, Halachah 2.)<br><b>transferring from one domain to another. -</b> All the materials necessary for the construction of the Sanctuary were brought from the private domain to the public domain (<i>Shabbat</i> 96b).

In response to receiving anew his soul from Heaven, one is obligated to praise and thank God. In that context, the Sages also instituted the requirement that he sanctify himself for his day's worship, just as the priests in the Temple did - i.e., by washing his hands with water from a vessel.

Nevertheless, in practice, it is agreed that women should mention both these mitzvot, because the ultimate fulfillment of the creation of both men and women is when they marry. Therefore, a man and his wife are considered a single unit (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 187:7).</i> There is a doubt whether their obligation stems from the Torah, since [this is a positive mitzvah] that is not linked to a specific time, <sup class=""footnote-marker"">3</sup><i class=""footnote"">Women are not obligated to fulfill such mitzvot.

In contrast, since each person may fulfill his obligation to recite grace without a <i>zimmun</i>, leniencies were granted in counting the people included.<br>Rabbenu Asher and the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 199:10) do not accept this distinction, and rule that a child may not be counted in a <i>zimun</i> until he is thirteen years of age and has exhibited signs of physical maturity.</i> A gentile may not be included in a <i>zimmun</i>. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">16</sup><i class=""footnote"">even when we are certain that he will bless God.<br>In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 7:1, based on <i>Berachot</i> 47b), the Rambam states that this refers to a gentile who has already made a decision to convert and has been circumcised for that reason. Nevertheless, if he has not immersed himself in the mikveh, he is not considered a Jew, and may not be included in a <i>zimmun</i>.14. This ruling is not accepted by many other authorities, including Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi and Rabbenu Asher. Because of the difference of opinion, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 197:3) rules that, at the outset, an attempt should be made to follow the Rambam's decision. If, however, the third person does not desire to eat bread, he may be included in the <i>zimmun</i> as long as he partook of a<i>k'zayit</i> of other foods.15. The commentaries note that the Rambam does not quote <i>Berachot</i> 48a (the source for this halachah) exactly. The Talmud states ""dipped his food in brine with them."" The Rambam's choice of phraseology is particularly difficult since, as the Rambam himself writes in <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i> 2:5, brine is generally not eaten alone as a food.16. The commentaries have noted the apparent redundancy in the Rambam's expressions. The <i>Kol ben Levi</i> offers a possible resolution, explaining that, in the opening clause, the Rambam states that these people are not required to make a <i>zimmun</i>. In the final clause, he states that they are not allowed to do so. 17. <i>Tosafot, Berachot</i> 47a, writes that if they have already decided to recite grace, the third person may not be included in a<i>zimmun</i> with them. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 197:1) accepts this ruling.18. According to the Rambam's opinion mentioned in the previous halachah, the third person must partake of bread. According to the other opinions mentioned above, if the third person partakes of other foods, the first two may include him in a <i>zimmun</i>.19. <i>Berachot</i> 47a relates that Rav Simai bar Chiyya joined Rav and Shemuel in a meal after the latter had completed eating. They ate another side dish together with him, and then recited the <i>zimmun</i>.20. Note the <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 197, which states that they are obligated to recite the <i>zimmun</i>.21. He may, however, convey this privilege on another person if he desires (<i>Tosafot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>; <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 201:1).<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions that if a guest is present, he should be given the privilege of reciting the<i>zimmun</i>, so that he will be able to recite a blessing for the host, as mentioned in Chapter 2, Halachah 7.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:2) also mentions that a priest who is a Torah sage should be given the privilege of reciting the <i>zimmun</i>. (See <i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i> 4:2 and <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 12:18.)<br>22. Although a sufficient number of people to recite grace with a<i>zimmun</i> will remain, each individual is personally obligated to participate in the <i>zimmun</i> and may not recite grace alone.23. Enough people remain in each group to allow them both to recite grace with a <i>zimmun</i>. There is, however, no obligation to separate. If the people desire, they may recite grace in a single group (Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 193:1).24. Until there are twenty people, separation will prevent - at the very least - the people who separate from reciting grace with God's name.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 193:1, based on<i>Berachot</i> 50a) states that, at a meal attended by many people, if there is a difficulty or inconvenience preventing an individual from participating in the <i>zimmun</i> in which God's name is mentioned, he may recite grace with a <i>zimmun</i> of three.</i>","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"

(See the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 7:5; and <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 195:2).<br>In contrast, in a restaurant, although many people eat in the same room, since they did not come with the intention of eating together, they are considered as a single group. 26. The Rambam is quoting the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 7:5). Rabbenu Asher and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 195:1) state that the same principles apply if the feast is held in two separate rooms (or houses), as long as they are not separated by a street.27. Similarly, if a single group is large enough to prevent the words of the blessings from being heard, people should recite the <i>zimmun</i> in smaller groups (<i>Kessef Mishneh; Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 193:1). 28.

Rav Nachman and Rabbi Yochanan hold that since <i>Musaf</i> is simply one of the prayers of the day, and על הנסים is recited on this day, its inclusion in <i>Musaf</i> is in place.<br>The Talmud ultimately decides in favor of the position of Rav Nachman and Rabbi Yochanan.

This is in line with <i>Shabbat</i> 24a which states: ""On fast days...in the Evening, Morning, and <i>Minchah</i> Prayers, one adds a mention of the particular day in 'the One who hears prayer.' However, the <i>Tur</i> quotes the Geonim that one should recite עננו only in the <i>Minchah</i> Prayer. Since one could be overcome by terrible hunger and break the fast, if one recited עננו earlier he would have spoken falsely when he mentioned the fast day. Therefore, according to this position, this prayer should be mentioned only in the <i>Minchah</i> service at the end of the fast days.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 565:3) quotes the <i>Tur's</i> position, but distinguishes between the four public fast days that occur every year (i.e., those mentioned above in our commentary) and other public fast days.

Since the Sages declared it a public fast, even were he to eat later on, he would not have spoken falsely in his prayer.<br>The Ramah ( <i>ibid.</i>), however, mentions that it is customary to recite עננו in <i>Minchah</i> only. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> explains that even one reciting <i>Minchah</i> in the early afternoon should add עננו, because even if he eats later on, at least he fasted until midday. (See Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 562:1.)

Therefore, he recites 20 blessings, as explained by the Rambam: 19 blessings as on any day, and one extra that is particular to the fast day.<br>There is no disagreement regarding the obligation of the שליח ציבור to recite עננו in the Morning Prayer. He is praying on behalf of the entire community. Therefore, we need not worry about the possibility of the fast being broken, since it is not possible that a number from among the congregants will not fast the whole day (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 565:3).

The source for this addition is the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Ta'anit</i> 2:2). That passage questions whether the addition should be made in the עבודה (the first of the last three blessings in the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>) or the הודאה (the second of the last three blessings). It explains that as a general rule commemorative prayers are mentioned in הודאה, while prayers regarding the future are placed in עבודה.<br>Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi quotes this passage, but adds that the custom is to recite the addition in בונה ירושלים (the blessing of Jerusalem). He explains that this decision is based on <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 8a which states that even though normally, we add special requests in the blessing of שומע תפילה (the One who hears prayer), one is able to make a request relevant to one of the blessings of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, in that blessing itself. Therefore, our prayers and supplications regarding the rebuilding of Jerusalem may rightfully be placed in the blessing of בונה ירושלים.

This version is found in most siddurim, although the version of Yemenite Jewry is רחם, as in the Rambam.<br>There is also a question regarding when this prayer is recited. The Rambam seems to indicate that רחם (or נחם) is to be recited in every prayer on the ninth of Av. However, the Ramah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 557:1) states that it should only be recited in <i>Minchah</i>, just like עננו on fast days.<br>The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 557) quotes the custom of saying רחם in the Evening and Morning Prayers, and נחם during <i>Minchah</i>. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 557:1) rules that נחם should be recited in all three prayers of the day. This is the custom of Sephardim, though Ashkenazim follow the ruling of the Ramah mentioned above. (See the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 557:1.)<br>The Ramah explains that the rationale behind his decision is that the fire which destroyed the Temple broke out on the afternoon of the ninth of Av. Hence, we ask for comfort at that time specifically. Alternatively, the Ritba explains that only in the afternoon are we able to be comforted.

According to Rabbenu Yonah, who understands גמילות חסד (acts of lovingkindness) to be Torah commandments, this is easily comprehended.

Since ultimately this shofar must be burnt, even before it is actually destroyed it is no longer considered to be an existent entity. Thus, we may not use it on Rosh HaShanah, because a shofar used for the mitzvah must be of a specific size - slightly larger than one's hand, as mentioned in Halachah 5 - and a nonexistent entity has no size at all.<br>A shofar of idol worship must also be destroyed. However, should the gentile negate its connection to idol worship before it is acquired by a Jew, it need not be destroyed, as stated in <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 8:8. Since there is a possibility that it will not have to be destroyed, it is considered to be an existent entity and may be used for the mitzvah.<br>This principle applies only to aspects of idol worship belonging to a gentile. It is impossible to negate the connection between an idol worshiped by a Jew and its forbidden nature. (See <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 8:9.) Hence, a Jew's shofar of idol worship may not be used. Similarly, if a Jew has acquired a shofar of idol worship that belonged to a gentile before the latter negated its connection to idol worship, the Jew is no longer capable of negating this connection. Therefore, such a shofar may not be used on Rosh HaShanah.<br>Also, once an animal has been sacrificed to an idol, there is no possibility of negating its connection to idol worship. Hence, its horn may not be used as a shofar.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 586:3-4) quotes all the above laws as halachah.

Quite the contrary; indeed, the Rambam concludes these halachot (Chapter 8, Halachah 15) with a description of the importance of happiness in the service of God. However, the intent is that the happiness should be a byproduct and not the goal of the service. We should be totally committed to fulfilling God's will, and the expression of that commitment should generate satisfaction and joy.<br><b>Based on this concept -</b> that mitzvot were not given for our benefit;<br><b>a person who vows not to derive benefit from a shofar may use it to blow the teki'ot required to fulfill the mitzvah. -</b> Doing so is not considered a violation of his vow.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 586:5) advises that the person who took the vow should not blow the shofar himself [because many consider that to be a pleasurable experience (<i>Taz</i>)].

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 159:14) accepts this view, although the Ramah favors the Rambam's position.<br>8. The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, and maintains that one may immerse one's hands in water poured into a pool in the ground. He supports his position by referring to the immersion of a <i>ba'al keri</i> (see <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 4:4-5), which is acceptable even in such pool. (See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Mikveot</i> 8:1.) Nevertheless, most authorities accept the Rambam's decision. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 159:23; <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 159.) 9. See Halachot 7-9.10. See Halachot 4 and 10.11. See Halachot 11-12. The Rashba quotes the <i>Halachot Gedolot</i> as explaining that it is necessary to wash with a vessel, because the washing of hands is derived from the sanctification of the priest's hands in the Temple.12. See Halachot 13-14.13. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160) states that this concept is derived from the laws of the <i>ki'or</i> (the basin in the Temple from which the priests washed their hands). If its water changed color, it could no longer be used.14. E.g., ink or another coloring fell into it.15. It became rusty from a metal container. Note, however, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 160:1 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 160:22, which state that water that has become murky from mud or dirt is acceptable, because even this is often the color of natural stream water.<br>If after water was disqualified because of an abnormal color, its color reverts to the norm, it can be used to wash one's hands (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 160:1; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 160:5).<br>16. See <i>Hilchot Rotzeach USh'mirat HaNefesh</i> 11:6-16, which discusseshe prohibition of water left uncovered. This prohibition was enacted out of fear of the possibility that a poisonous snake or the like released venom into the water.17. <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 30b states that washing with such water could be dangerous lest the venom seep into cuts or sores or even through the body's pores. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160) notes that since the presence of poisonous snakes and the like is no longer widespread, the prohibition against drinking - and hence, washing with - such water need not be observed at present. This ruling is accepted by the later authorities.18. The Rambam is implying that the water in a <i>mikveh</i> or in a natural stream remains acceptable for washing although it was used for other tasks (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).19. If, however, the bread fell into the water accidentally, the water is not disqualified (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 160:2; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 160:8).20. The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160:2) states that even if the baker washed his hands in the water, the water does not become unacceptable. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> (160:3) refutes this ruling. His opinion is accepted by the later authorities. 21. Slightly murky water is acceptable, as mentioned above. The determining factor is whether or not a dog will drink from the water.22. Since a <i>mikveh</i> containing such water is acceptable for the immersion of one's entire body, it is surely acceptable for the immersion of hands, which is only a Rabbinic commandment.23. These hot springs have a high mineral content and are very bitter.24. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> interprets this as referring to a stream that was diverted into a trench that does not contain forty <i>se'ah</i>. Although logically, this would be acceptable for the immersion of hands, the Sages forbade using such water, lest one also immerse one's hands in a container of water. Significantly, in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160:7), Rav Yosef Karo adds a further point, that the water was cut off from its source.25. I.e., the washing before partaking of bread.26. I.e., the washing after the meal (see Halachah 17); alternatively, the second pouring of water over one's hands, as mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 4. Note the explanation of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>. 27. In both instances, one must pour at least a <i>revi'it</i> of water over one's hands in a single pouring. In the first instance, while the water is being poured one gradually moves one's hands under the water, while in the second instance, one pours hurriedly, but forcefully, over the entire hand at once.28. I.e., several people stand with their hands outstretched, and a person passes in front of them pouring water over their hands.29. Although the water first passes over the hands of one person, it is still acceptable for the person whose hands are held below, because as long as it contains the required quantity and comes in one continuous stream, it does not become impure.<br>Nevertheless, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 160:16 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 160:68,72 state that the two people must originally have the intention to wash their hands as one, and must hold their hands close together. Otherwise, it is considered as if the second person washed with the water that was rendered impure by the first person's washing.<br>30.

However, based on the above verse, <i>Beit Shammai</i> obligates one to recline while reciting <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night, and to stand while reciting it in the morning. <i>Beit Hillel</i> holds that the verse simply establishes the general times at which the <i>Shema</i> is recited, as stated by the Rambam in this halachah; i.e., at the time that people sleep and at the time that they are accustomed to wake up.</i> <sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">as [Deuteronomy 6:7] states: ""...when you lie down and when you rise"" - In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 10), the Rambam mentions the beginning of this verse, ודברת בם...

Here, the Rambam is not interested in the actual source for the mitzvah itself (which is the case in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>), but in stating our obligation to recite the <i>Shema</i> twice daily, once at night and once in the daytime.

He was worried that perhaps his sudden lack of understanding was due to the imperfect state of his children and therefore, felt compelled to ask them about their faith in the One God.<br>The Rambam omits all these particulars, since they are not relevant to the matter at hand - namely, the source of the custom of saying ""Blessed be the name..."" after ""<i>Shema Yisrael</i>...""</i> This is comparable to the manner in which Moses, our teacher, said to us: ""Lest there be among you a man or woman [whose heart turns this day from God...]"" <sup class=""footnote-marker"">6</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Rambam adds this in order to teach us the nature of Jacob's doubts. He was not casting aspersions on the behavior of his sons, since he knew that their deeds were righteous. He was, however, worried that perhaps one of them had a mistaken understanding regarding the unity of God. This is in line with the verse the Rambam quotes.

Reading the Shema 1.9,"When is the [proper] time for the recitation of Shema at night? The commandment [starts] from the time of the appearance of the stars...<br>A <sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 2a) states that the time for the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> begins at the hour when a priest who has become ritually impure may immerse in a <i>mikveh</i> and resume eating <i>terumah</i>. The Talmud explains that this is the time when the stars appear.<br><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 2a) holds that the <i>Shema</i> may be recited earlier, during the last hour before sunset. This is based on the understanding that Rabbi Yehudah, who disagrees with the majority opinion regarding the proper time for the afternoon prayer, also disagrees about the proper time for the evening prayer and <i>Kri'at Shema</i> contained therein. (See <i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 235.) This will be discussed at length in <i>Hilchot Tefilah</i> 3:6.<br>There are several different positions regarding the precise definition of צאת הכוכבים (the appearance of the stars). It generally refers to the appearance of three medium-sized stars. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 235:1 requires the sighting of three small stars before reciting <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> explains that the basic halachah is indeed that three medium sized stars constitute the time of צאת הכוכבים, but that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> obligated one to wait for smaller stars in order to diminish the possibility of error regarding the recitation of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night.<br>There are three basic positions regarding the actual time of צאת הכוכבים (the appearance of the stars). <i>Shabbat</i> 34b determines that it refers to the time that it takes one to walk 3/4 of a <i>mil</i> after sunset.<br>The other two positions are found in <i>Pesachim</i> 94a: one defines צאת הכוכבים as the amount of time needed to walk four <i>mil</i> after sunset, and the other, as the time necessary to walk five <i>mil</i>.<br>There are two different methods of determining the time it takes to walk a <i>mil</i>. The Rambam, Commentary to the mishnah, <i>Pesachim</i> 3:2, maintains that it takes 24 minutes to walk a <i>mil</i>. However, the most widely held opinion - and the opinion accepted regarding <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i> - is that the measure of time is 18 minutes.<br>Therefore, according to <i>Shabbat</i> 34b, the appearance of the stars is 13 1/2 (3/4 x 18) minutes after sunset. Both the Vilna Gaon and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> maintain that צאת הכוכבים is determined in this fashion. Thus, the proper local time may be calculated by extrapolation based on the amount of light visible 13 1/2 minutes after sunset in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> on the day of the Equinox. Generally, people wait up to 36 minutes after sunset in order to be certain.<br>According to <i>Pesachim</i> 94a, the appearance of the stars will be either 72 (4 x 18) minutes or 90 (5 x 18) minutes after sunset. <i>Rabbenu Tam</i> strongly suggests adhering to the position that צאת הכוכבים takes place 72 minutes after sunset. Though some authorities support the 90-minute position, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein (<i>Iggerot Moshe, Orach Chayim</i>, Vol. 1, Siman 24), mentions only the position of the <i>Vilna Gaon</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>, on the one hand, and <i>Rabbenu Tam</i> on the other.</i> person who transgresses and delays fulfills his obligation if he recites [the Shema] before dawn. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">3</sup><i class=""footnote"">In his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 1:1), the Rambam defines dawn (עלות השחר) as the light that radiates from the east before sunrise.<br>There are three major positions regarding this time. All are based on <i>Pesachim</i> 94a which defines the time from dawn until sunrise as that in which a person can walk either 4 <i>mil</i> (according to one opinion) or 5 <i>mil</i> (according to the other).<br>As mentioned above, there are two opinions regarding the measure of time it takes to walk a <i>mil</i>: 18 minutes or 24 minutes.

In Halachah 3, the Rambam also mentions covering chametz with a utensil. However, in that instance, the person had already nullified his possession of the chametz, and thus his possession of chametz violated only a Rabbinic prohibition.<br>In contrast, this instance describes chametz that has not been nullified, and thus the violation of a Torah prohibition is involved. Nevertheless, the Rambam considers the Rabbinic prohibition against <i>mukzteh</i> as important enough to override the fulfillment of a Torah commandment. Furthermore, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that since the person himself desires to destroy the chametz, and the only reason he fails to do so is the Rabbinic commandment, he is not considered to have violated the Torah's prohibitions against possessing chametz.<br>This view is not accepted by all authorities. Many explain that since three Torah mitzvot (the two prohibitions against possessing chametz and the positive commandment to destroy chametz) are involved, their observance overrides the prohibitions of <i>muktzeh</i>. Others maintain that even if the prohibition against <i>muktzeh</i> must be observed, the chametz can be destroyed by burning it in the place where it is located.<br>Nevertheless, in practice, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 446:2), the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>, and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> do not accept the latter view, and advise waiting to destroy the chametz until after the holiday. They explain that a person is allowed to light a fire on a festival only if doing so increases his festive joy. Hence, they prohibit burning the chametz in that manner. However, they mention that, if it is possible, a gentile may be asked to destroy the chametz. Furthermore, in the diaspora, a Jew is also allowed to destroy chametz he finds on the second day of a festival.</i> [If the chametz] was consecrated property, <sup class=""footnote-marker"">8</sup><i class=""footnote"">consecrated for use in the Temple;</i> there is no need to cover it with a utensil, for regardless, everyone shies away from its use. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">9</sup><i class=""footnote"">Property consecrated for use in the Temple may never be used for mundane purposes.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 8.4,"What is implied by [the term,] communal prayer? One [person] prays aloud and all [the others] listen. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">With this statement, the Rambam touches on a point debated both by the Sages of the Talmud and the later Rabbis. The mishnah, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 33b, states:<br>Just as the leader of the congregation is obligated [to pray], each individual is obligated. Rabban Gamliel states: ""The leader of the congregation fulfills the obligation on behalf of the community.""<br>The Talmud (34b) elaborates on the difference of opinion:<br>They asked Rabban Gamliel: ""According to your opinion, why does the community pray?""He replied: ""In order to allow the leader of the community to prepare his prayers.""Rabban Gamliel asked them: ""According to your opinion, why does the leader of the congregation pray aloud?""They replied: ""In order to allow those who are not knowledgeable to fulfill their obligation.""He told them: ""Just as he fulfills the obligation on behalf of those who are not knowledgeable, he fulfills it on behalf of those who are knowledgeable.""<br>The Sages of the Talmud continued to debate the issue. The ultimate decision accepted by Rav Yitzchok Alfasi, the Rambam (See Halachah 9), and Rabbenu Asher, is that during the entire year, the Sages' opinion is accepted. However, on Rosh HaShanah, because of the complexity of the blessings (See Halachah 10), Rabban Gamliel's opinion prevails.<br>Both Rabban Gamliel and the Sages agree that the practice of communal prayer involves two elements:a) the silent prayers of many individuals; andb) the <i>chazan's</i> repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>.They differ, however, as to which of these elements is considered of primary importance. According to the Sages, the essential element of communal prayer is that ten or more people recite the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> at the same time. According to Rabban Gamliel, the essential element of communal prayer is, as the Rambam states in this halachah, the prayer of the leader of the congregation.<br>[Note <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 24, which explains that their difference of opinion revolves around a more general issue: Which is of higher priority, quantity (the prayers of the many) or quality (the prayers of the leader of the congregation)?]<br>The Rambam's statement here is difficult to place in perspective. Though in Halachah 9, he accepts the Sages' view (See also Chapter 9, Halachot 2-3) in this halachah, his opinion follows that of Rabban Gamliel. In one of his responsa, the Rambam explains that after the Sages instituted the silent <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> to allow the leader of the congregation to prepare his prayers, even Rabban Gamliel would agree that all the individuals praying in a <i>minyan</i> also fulfill their obligation to pray by reciting their own prayers. Still it is difficult to understand why the Rambam would have the individuals forfeit the higher quality of communal prayer in order to pray individually.<br>In his notes to <i>Rosh HaShanah</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, Rav Chayim Soloveichik writes that to take into consideration the Rambam's statements in this halachah, after concluding his individual prayers, each person should stand and listen to the prayer of the leader of the congregation and thus, fulfill the mitzvah of communal prayer. Note <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, which compares answering to the <i>chazan's</i> prayer to reciting a voluntary prayer (See Chapter 1, Halachah 9). By doing so, one will have both the advantages of individual and communal prayer.</i> This should not be done with fewer than <sup class=""footnote-marker"">2</sup><i class=""footnote"">See Halachot 4 and 5.</i> <sup class=""footnote-marker"">3</sup><i class=""footnote"">Males who have reached the age of thirteen years and a day and manifested signs of physical maturity.

See also <i>Bereishit Rabbah</i> 91:3.<br>Many Halachic authorities do not accept this conclusion. In his siddur, Rav Sa'adia Gaon rules that a child may be counted as the tenth in a <i>minyan</i>. Similarly, the <i>Ba'al HaMe'or</i> holds that even up to four minors may be counted in a <i>minyan</i> for prayer.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chayim</i> 55:4), rules that a minor may not be included in a <i>minyan</i> for prayer. The <i>Ramah</i> adds that under extraordinary circumstances, a minor may be counted.

Rabbenu Nissim, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, and Rabbenu Manoach follow a different line of reasoning. They differentiate between eating matzah and hearing a shofar. In the former case, a person's body benefits from the activity regardless of his intention. To support this thesis, they draw a parallel to the following passage.<br>Generally, the Torah frees a person from liability if he commits a transgression while being only מתעסק (performing a deed without any thought). However, a person who eats forbidden foods or engages in forbidden sexual relations in this manner is liable, because he derived pleasure from his activities (<i>Keritot</i> 19b).<br>Similarly, since the person derived physical satisfaction from eating the matzah, even though he was forced to do so, the action is attributed to him.

(See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 588:4.)</i> as <i>sh'vut</i>.<br>It would be appropriate for [the shofar] to be sounded, for a positive commandment of the Torah should supersede <i>sh'vut</i> instituted <sup class=""footnote-marker"">4</sup><i class=""footnote"">A question can be raised, based on the Rambam's statements in Chapter 1, Halachah 4:Regarding a shofar to be used on Rosh Hashanah: It is forbidden to violate the festival's laws to obtain it. This applies even when the forbidden practice is in the category of <i>sh'vut</i>.The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> offers a number of resolutions to this difficulty. Among them:<br>a) Had the proper attention been paid to the matter before Rosh Hashanah, the <i>sh'vut</i> mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 4 with regard to obtaining the shofar would not exist. In contrast, the <i>sh'vut</i> involved in blowing the shofar cannot be avoided.<br>b) The <i>sh'vut</i> mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 4 must be violated before the mitzvah is performed. Hence, there is no way the prohibition can be relaxed in the mere expectation that a mitzvah will be performed. In contrast, in this instance, the performance of the mitzvah and the <i>sh'vut</i> occur concurrently.<br>However, the order of the halachot here suggests a different explanation. As the Rambam states in the following halachah, certain leniencies are taken regarding the <i>sh'vut</i> of sounding the shofar on Rosh Hashanah (since, as mentioned above, it is forbidden only because it is a ""weekday act""). In contrast, the activities mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 4 are of a more severe nature, and hence no leniency may be taken in their regard.</i> by the Sages.

It must be noted that while the Temple was standing, a similar decree was not enacted on the first day of Sukkot which fell on the Sabbath, even though it is possible that a person would carry his lulav in a forbidden manner. Note our commentary on Chapter 7, Halachot 13 and 14, which explains the difference between the two festivals.<br>The fact that a Rabbinic decree can cause a mitzvah to be nullified - particularly as significant a mitzvah as the blowing of the shofar - has been the subject of much discussion by the Rabbis. In his commentary on the tractate of <i>Sukkah</i>, Rabbenu Nissim states that this decree was instituted only because in most Jewish communities, the people were not aware of the date the Rabbis had established for Rosh Hashanah. Hence, since the people could not be sure that they were in fact performing a mitzvah, the Rabbinic decree had the power to negate its performance. Even in the places where they were conscious of the proper date, they would not blow the shofar in such a year, so that great divisions in Torah practice would not be created among the Jewish people.<br>In <i>Likkutei Torah</i>, Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi explains the matter from a mystical perspective. He writes that the Sabbath itself generates spiritual influences which resemble those produced by the blowing of the shofar. Thus, there is no necessity to blow the shofar, and the Sages were therefore willing to allow such a decree to negate its observance.</i> but not all are skilled in it.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]"

Thus, this law applied only in Yavneh and in the few other cities where the Sanhedrin subsequently held its session.<br>Rav Yitzchak Alfasi (the Rif) quotes this law in his <i>Halachot</i> even though he quotes only those laws which are applicable in his age.
