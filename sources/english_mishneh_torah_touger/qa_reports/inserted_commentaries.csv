Several commentaries have raised the question that from <i>Berachot</i> 42b, it appears that the Rambam's decision follows the School of Shammai and not the School of Hillel. The clearest resolution of the difficulty is offered by the <i>Rishon LeTzion</i>, who explains that the Rambam's decision is based on the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 6:5). When the passage from the Babylonian Talmud is studied in the light of the passage from the Jerusalem Talmud, the Rambam's ruling is no longer difficult.
This relates to a concept frequently discussed by students of the Rambam: Does the Rambam accept the principle that when there is a difference of opinion between the Babylonian Talmud and the Jerusalem Talmud, the Halachah follows the Babylonian Talmud, or not?

Blessings 4.7,"A person who decides not to continue eating or drinking<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cites <i>Pesachim</i> 103b, which states that once a person diverts his attention from drinking wine, he must recite another blessing when he begins drinking again.
The Ra'avad notes that the passage from <i>Pesachim</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions only drinking and does not discuss eating, and on that basis protests against the Rambam's equation of the two. From <i>Berachot</i> 42a, however, it appears that similar principles apply with regard to eating.
</i>, and afterwards changes his mind and [desires to] eat or drink, must recite another blessing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> before partaking of the food or drink. He is not, however, required to recite a blessing after the first food or drink. Rather, he is required to recite only a single blessing after he completes eating.
</i> although he has not changed his place<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned in Halachot 3-5, a person who changes his place while eating must recite both a blessing after the food he has eaten previously and a blessing over the food he plans to eat in his new place.
Many authorities do not accept the Rambam's decision with regard to a meal that includes bread. When a person sits down to such a meal, he is considered to have fixed his attention on eating. People frequently become drawn into eating more than they originally intended at such meals. Thus, a person's decision not to continue eating is not considered final, since it is quite possible that he will change his mind and decide to eat again. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 179:1).
Based on these principles, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 179:1) rules that, although once a person has decided to cease eating or drinking a new blessing is generally required, when partaking of a meal it is not sufficient to make a mental decision, and a person must wash before grace to be considered to have ceased eating.
</i>. If he<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> remained in the place in which he ate originally, and
</i> did not decide [to cease] eating or drinking and had in mind to continue<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> eating at a later time
</i> - even if he made an interruption for the entire day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's terminology appears to be a stylistic exaggeration. If a person waits long enough for the food he has eaten to digest, it would appear that he is required to recite another blessing before beginning to eat again (<i>Kin’at Eliyahu</i>).
</i> - he is not required to recite a second blessing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> before partaking of more food or drink.

Blessings 4.8,"When people who are sitting together<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> after having completed a meal

From sunset onward, it is forbidden to continue eating until one recites <i>kiddush</i>. It is, however, possible to recite <i>kiddush</i> early (see <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 29:11). Once the people agree to recite <i>kiddush</i>, they may no longer continue their meal (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 179:2 states that, according to the authorities who differ with the Rambam on the previous halachah, if one's desire to drink stems from having eaten, one may continue to drink at this point.
</i>hould they desire to drink more - although they are<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> considered to have diverted their attention from drinking, as mentioned in the previous halachah. Hence, they are
</i> not permitted to do so - before reciting grace or <i>kiddush</i>, they are required to recite the blessing <i>borey pri hagafen</i> before drinking. I<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The difference between <i>kiddush</i> and <i>havdalah</i> is that <i>kiddush</i> initiates the Sabbath. Accordingly, the respect due to the Sabbath adds importance to the diversion of our attention from drinking implied by the statement, ""Let us recite <i>kiddush</i>."" In contrast, <i>havdalah</i> marks the beginning of the week, which we are not required to treat with such distinction. Thus, as <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 29:12 states, a person is not required to interrupt his meal at nightfall on Saturday, but may continue and recite <i>havdalah</i> when he concludes eating (Radbaz).
24. <i>Berachot</i> 59b emphasizes that this blessing is recited only when one drinks in a company. When one drinks alone, this blessing should not be recited, because it praises God for ""being good"" - i.e., to me - and ""doing good"" - for others (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 175:4).<br>
25. <i>Tosafot, Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) notes that the Sages instituted this blessing only for different types of wine and not for different types of bread or meat, since wine has two positive qualities: It satisfies a person's appetite and lifts his spirits.<br>
26. Rashi, <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), states that this blessing should be recited only when the second type of wine is better than the first. If the first type of wine is better, no blessing should be recited. The commentaries maintain that the Rambam differs and maintains that the blessing should be recited whenever one changes types of wine. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 175:2-3) rules that if one knows that the second type of wine is of a lesser quality than the first, the blessing should not be recited.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> because, as mentioned in the previous halachah, the blessing they recited originally does not cover any drink consumed after they concluded drinking.

Blessings 4.10,"A person should not recite a blessing over any food or drink until it is brought before him<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 206:4) states that a person should hold the food in his right hand before reciting the blessing for it.
</i>. If he<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> ignored the above directive and

</i>.<br>When a person took food in his hand and recited a blessing, but [before he could eat it] it fell from his hand and was burned or washed away by a river<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> or in any other way became inedible

</i>. [This applies] even when the food is of the same species<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 206:6) adds, ""and even if the other fruit was before him when he recited the blessing originally."" The Ramah (based on the <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i>) differs, and maintains that if he originally intended to partake of the other fruit as well, it is included in the first blessing and he should eat it without hesitation so that the blessing will not have to be repeated.
</i>. He should also say, ""Blessed be the Name of Him whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever"" for the first blessing, so that he will not be considered to have recited a blessing in vain<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Chapter 1, Halachah 15, which discusses the seriousness of reciting a blessing in vain. See also <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 12:9-11, where the Rambam discusses related concepts, concluding:
The Torah has adjured us ""to fear [His] glorious and awesome name."" Included in this fear is that it should not be mentioned in vain. If, because of a slip of the tongue, one mentioned God's name in vain, one should immediately praise and laud... it.

</i>. Although the water that was before him at the time he recited the blessing is not the water he drinks, this was his original intention<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> He knew that the water would continue to flow. When he recited the blessing on the water, his intent was on water from the stream and not on the particular water before him at the time he recited the blessing.

Blessings 4.11,"Foods that are eaten within the meal, because of the meal<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's statements are quoted, with slight changes, from <i>Berachot</i> 41b. In his commentary on this passage, Rashi defines this first category of foods as relishes eaten with bread. He explains that other foods - e.g., cereals or vegetables - although they are eaten as part of a meal, require an independent blessing.
<i>Tosafot</i> differs, and maintains that any food that is eaten as part of a meal - e.g., the foods mentioned by Rashi, meat or fish - is included in this category. Even if they are not eaten with bread, merely at the same meal, they
</i>, do not require a blessing beforehand or afterward<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The commentaries question whether the Rambam's position follows that of Rashi or <i>Tosafot</i>. The following sentence (which is the Rambam's addition to <i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) sheds light on the question.
</i>. Rather, the blessing <i>hamotzi</i> that is recited in the beginning and the grace recited afterward include everything, because everything is secondary to the meal.<br>F<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This refers to fruits and the like, which are not satisfying food and are eaten throughout the day, frequently outside the context of a meal, but at times within the context of a meal. This indicates that they are not necessarily connected with the meal and, therefore, are not included in the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>. Accordingly, they
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This sentence explains the rationale for this ruling. These foods are not eaten casually during the day, but rather are eaten only as part of a meal, with the intent of satiating one's appetite. Accordingly, they are considered as secondary to bread, which is the primary element of the meal (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 177:1). Accordingly, we follow the ruling mentioned in Chapter 3, Halachah 5, that the blessing on primary foods includes secondary foods.
This explanation appears to indicate that the Rambam follows<i>Tosafot's</i> interpretation. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 171:1) also rules accordingly. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 177:1, however, postulates that it is logical to assume that this ruling applies only when bread is eaten throughout the meal. If only a small amount of bread is eaten at the beginning of a meal, and no bread is eaten while the main course is being eaten, it is questionable whether the blessing over the bread covers these foods.
</i>oods that are eaten within the meal, but do not come because of the meal, require a blessing before partaking of them, but do not require a blessing afterward<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since they are eaten within the meal, they also satisfy a person's appetite. Accordingly, they are included in the blessing that is required by the commandment, ""When you have eaten and are satiated, you shall bless....""
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:1,3, based on Rabbenu Asher's commentary on <i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions two instances when fruit is included in the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>:
a) When the fruits are eaten on bread itself,<br>
b) When one eats a meal of fruit - i.e., the fruit is served to satiate one's appetite.
</i>.<br>Foods that are eaten after the meal, whether because of the meal<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., foods served to satiate one's appetite
</i> or independent of the meal<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">fruits, desserts, or drinks
</i>, require a blessing beforehand and afterward<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) states that this law does not apply at present. Our eating habits have changed, and bread is constantly before us during a meal, and it is customary to partake of it at all times.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:2) accepts <i>Tosafot's</i> position. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 177:7 adds that even at large feasts, when it is customary to eat desert without eating bread, a new blessing is not required because, in Talmudic times, bread and the main course were served on a small table, which was then removed, and dessert was served on a new table. Thus, the dessert appeared as a separate meal and required separate blessings. In contrast, at present, desert is served on the same table on which the bread was served. Hence, it is still considered a continuation of the same meal and does not require a separate blessing.

It is forbidden to designate an animal as a sacrifice at present. Hence, since many of the common people might think that the shank-bone was actually a Paschal sacrifice, many authorities suggested using a bone from a chicken, a species which was never offered as a sacrifice. Similarly, we are warned not to eat the shank-bone.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 473:6, states that less than a כזית should be eaten, in order that no question arise as to whether or not one is obligated to recite a blessing afterwards.

It must be noted that the commonly accepted text of the Haggadah follows a different order, quoting that mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud, <i>Pesachim</i> 116a. The order mentioned by the Rambam is found in the Jerusalem Talmud and the codifications of Rabbenu Asher and Rav Yitzchak Alfasi.
Perhaps, the reason for this order is that the first three questions follow the pattern the child sees at the Seder: first we dip (<i>karpas</i>,) then we eat matzah, and then we eat maror.
It must be noted that the expression ""twice"" represents somewhat of a question to the Rambam, who also requires the matzah and the sandwich to be dipped in <i>charoset</i>.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Some versions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> omit the latter phrase, which implies that the questions are not asked by the children. Others interpret the passage as follows: the children ask without necessarily phrasing the questions precisely, and then the leader recites the standard text. Perhaps this is the source for the custom followed by many, where, after the child recites the four questions, the leader of the Seder, and, at times, each of the assembled, also recites the questions.

In general, the Sages postulate הידים עסקניות, ""a person's hands are constantly busy,"" and imply that a person is not necessarily conscious of what he touches.

There is an advantage to our practice; <i>Pesachim</i> 115b plays on the relationship between the words ענה (poverty) and עונה (answer), and describes matzah as the bread on which many answers are given. To emphasize this point, the broken matzah is exposed throughout most of the Seder.

Hence, the matzah and the bitter herbs are eaten together, as implied by Exodus 12:8: ""eat it (the Paschal sacrifice) together with matzot and bitter herbs.""
The above follows the opinion of the Sage, Hillel. <i>Pesachim</i> 115a mentions other opinions which did not require the matzah and maror to be wrapped together, but merely to be eaten at the same sitting. However, since the latter opinion also accepts Hillel's practice, when partaking of the Paschal sacrifice, it is preferable to eat them wrapped together.

However, as mentioned in Halachot 7:11 and 8:8, the Rambam considers the <i>charoset</i> a mitzvah in its own right; and, therefore, requires that it be included when the Paschal sacrifice or other foods associated with the mitzvot of the night are eaten.

The blessing for the Paschal sacrifice does not free one of [the obligation of the blessing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The commentaries question the need for this halachah, because the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering is eaten before the Paschal sacrifice. The <i>Emek HaSh'eylah</i> explains that if one forgot to recite a blessing over the <i>Chaggigah</i>, one might think that the blessing recited over the Paschal sacrifice would suffice for the previous mitzvah as well. Hence, this opinion must be negated.
</i> for] the [<i>Chaggigah</i>] offering. [C<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Both Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yishmael agree with this decision.
This law can also be explained within the context of the discussion of ""primary"" and ""secondary"" mentioned above. Since the Paschal sacrifice follows the <i>Chagigah</i> offering, for the Paschal sacrifice should be eaten when satisfied, one might presume that it is considered as ""secondary"" to the <i>Chagigah</i>. Hence, the Sages must negate this presumption.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This follows the opinion of Rabbi Akiva. Nevertheless, <i>Pesachim</i> 121a quotes Rabbi Yishmael, who offers an alternate opinion.
<i>Pesachim</i> (ibid.) explains these Sages' difference of opinion as follows: The blood of the Paschal sacrifice is to be poured out against the base of the Temple altar. In contrast, the blood of the <i>Chaggigah</i> should be sprinkled on the two opposite corners of the altar.
Rabbi Yishmael maintains that בדיעבד (after the fact), were a person to pour the blood of the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering on the base of the altar, he would be considered to have fulfilled his obligation. Hence, the blessing for the Pesach offering can apply to the <i>Chaggigah</i> as well.
In contrast, Rabbi Akiva maintains that even ""after the fact,"" the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering is not acceptable if its blood is not sprinkled on the altar as prescribed. Accordingly, the blessing for the Pesach offering has no connection to the <i>Chaggigah</i> at all.
The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> questions the Rambam's decision. In <i>Hilchot P'sulei HaMukdashim</i> 2:2, the Rambam writes: ""Whenever [blood] is prescribed to be presented [on the altar] by sprinkling, and it was presented by pouring, one has fulfilled his obligation,"" accepting the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael. If so, his acceptance of Rabbi Akiva's opinion here appears to present a contradiction.
Rav Yechezkel Landau (<i>Tz'lach, Pesachim</i> ibid.) attempts to resolve the issue, explaining that the Rambam follows the interpretation of Rav Chayim HaCohen (<i>Tosefot, Pesachim</i> ibid.), who favored a different text of the Talmud and, accordingly, an alternate interpretation of the difference in opinion between the two Sages.
Rav Chayim maintains that Rabbi Yishmael considers the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering as secondary to the Paschal sacrifice. (See also Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Pesachim</i> 10:7.) Hence, reciting a blessing over the Paschal sacrifice, the essential element (עיקר) of the evening, also fulfills the requirement for the secondary element (טפל), the <i>Chaggigah</i>. Indeed, regarding the blessings recited over food, the Rambam writes (<i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 3:5) that whenever there are two foods, one essential and one secondary, it is only necessary to recite a blessing over the essential food. A blessing is not required for the secondary item.
This interpretation itself presents a question: Since the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering was instituted only for the sake of the Paschal sacrifice and is not an obligation in its own right, it can be considered as ""secondary"" to the Pesach sacrifice. If so, what is the rationale for Rabbi Akiva's opinion?
It can be explained that Rabbi Akiva never considers one mitzvah as secondary to another. We may use the labels ""primary"" and ""secondary"" in regard to matters dependent on our will, but not in regard to mitzvot which we fulfill in obedience to God's desires. Therefore, though the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering was instituted because of the Paschal sacrifice, once it has been instituted, it must be considered as a mitzvah in its own right, with its own importance. Hence, it requires a unique blessing of its own (R. Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitch Haggadah).
</i>onversely, the blessing for the <i>Chaggigah</i>] offering does not free one of [the obligation of the blessing for] the Paschal sacrifice."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.8,"At present, when there is no [Paschal] sacrifice<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note the opinions mentioned on p. 34 of the Moznaim edition of <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i>, which question whether the Paschal sacrifice can be offered on the Temple Mount even before the Temple is rebuilt.

Though the Ra'avad curtly dismisses these words as ""emptiness,"" the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> quote previous authorities, Rav Amram Gaon and Rav Yitzchak ibn Giat, who also require dipping the matzah in <i>charoset</i>.
The <i>Tzafnat Paneach</i> explains the difference between the Rambam and the Ra'avad as follows: As mentioned in Halachah 7:11, <i>charoset</i> is a mitzvah commemorating the mortar used by our ancestors. Hence, the Rambam maintains that it should be eaten together with both the matzah and the maror.
The Ra'avad maintains that matzah commemorates two different qualities: the ""bread of poverty"" eaten in Egypt and the matzot our ancestors carried out from Egypt after being redeemed. In contrast, maror and <i>charoset</i> are both symbols of slavery.
While the Temple was standing, the Ra'avad did not object to the matzah being dipped in <i>charoset</i>, because, as above, it also commemorates our ancestors' slavery. However, after the Temple's destruction and the negation of the mitzvah of maror, we may assume that the other symbols of the enslavement are also negated. Hence, the only mitzvah is the commemoration of the redemption associated with the matzah. Accordingly, it should not be mixed with charoset, which recalls the slavery.

While the Temple was standing, they could be eaten together - since they were both mitzvot, partaking of one mitzvah could not negate another.

""the blessing of song"" - this is ""<i>Nishmat kol chay</i>"" until its conclusion. ""May all Your works praise You, God..."" until its conclusion is also called the blessing of song. If one joins the two together, it is praiseworthy.

This cup is not an obligation like the other cups<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rabbenu Nissim writes that drinking a fifth cup fulfills the mitzvah in the most complete manner. However, the <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> quotes the Rambam's son, Rav Avraham, as relating that his father would always recite Psalm 136 after the Hallel prayers, and then conclude with the blessing without drinking a fifth cup. Accordingly, the <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> concludes that although it is permissible to drink a fifth cup, it is not proper to do so.
<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XXVII, suggests a different interpretation of this halachah, noting that the Rambam does not mention that the fifth cup is drunk. A fifth cup is mixed and placed on the table, and the ""great Hallel"" is recited over it. However, that cup should not be drunk. Thus, the fifth cup is not included as one of the four. Rather, it is a separate and independent obligation.
The Vilna Gaon (see <i>Ta'amei HaMinhagim</i> 551) associates the fifth cup with the cup of Elijah. The Talmud concludes the discussion of many unresolved questions with the statement: תיקו. Literally, the term is a shortened form of the word תיקום, ""let it remain"". However, it is also interpreted as an acrostic for the expression תשבי יתרץ קושיות ואביעות - ""The Tishbite (Elijah) will answer all questions and difficulties.""
Since the requirement of the fifth cup remains an unresolved question, the fifth cup is left for Elijah in the hope that he will come soon and resolve this question as well.
The homiletic aspects of this comment notwithstanding, from a halachic perspective a differentiation must be made between the two. The fifth cup is of Talmudic origin and may be poured for each individual. In contrast, Elijah's cup is an Ashkenazic custom of later origin, and a single cup is used for the whole family. Indeed, they are mentioned by halachists in different chapters of the Shulchan Aruch: the fifth cup by the Ramah in Chapter 481 and Elijah's cup by the <i>Chok Ya'akov</i> in Chapter 480.

However, once grace is concluded, no such problems exist.
The Ra'avad does not accept this opinion and maintains that all four cups should be drunk in the same place. Hence, he does not allow a person to leave the home in which he begins the Seder until its conclusion. Nevertheless, the Ramah quotes the Rambam's view as halachah in <i>Orach Chayim</i> 481:1.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 8.14,"A person<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> holding a Seder alone

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This law is derived as follows: The Paschal sacrifice must be eaten together with a company of people (חבורה), organized before the sacrifice was slaughtered. It is forbidden to take the meat outside of this company. A person who eats the Paschal sacrifice alone is considered as the sole member of his company. Should he fall asleep in the midst of eating, it is considered as if he has changed from one company to another and he is forbidden to eat again.
Since the afikoman was instituted as a commemoration of the Paschal sacrifice, similar laws apply to it. Accordingly, <i>Pesachim</i> 120b records a discussion between Abaye and Rabbah concerning this law.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 478:2 quotes the Rambam's statements verbatim. The Ramah states that since the law is derived from the laws of the Paschal sacrifice, it applies only with regard to the consumption of the afikoman. However, if a person fell asleep in the midst of the meal beforehand, he may resume eating. This opinion is accepted by the later Ashkenazic authorities.

Blessings 1.1,"It is a positive mitzvah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 19) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 430) include this as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.

Significantly, the <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> and the <i>Noda BiYhudah</i> maintain that with this expression, the Rambam is implying that the blessing <i>al hamichyah</i>, which is recited over other foods made from these species, also has its source in the Torah itself (See also <i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 209).
</i>, as [Deuteronomy 8:10] states: ""When you have eaten and are satiated, you shall bless God, your Lord.""<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
</i><br>The Torah itself requires a person to recite grace only when he eats to the point of satiation<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rabbis do not specify a standard quantity or measure of food that a person must eat to have reached this state. Rather, they leave the matter up to the person's own feelings.
</i>, as implied by the above verse, ""When you have eaten and <i>are satiated,</i> you shall bless...."" T<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 20b relates:
The angels complained to the Holy One, blessed be He: ""...In Your Torah, it is written [that You] 'will not show favor, nor take bribes,' and yet You show favor to the Jews....""<br>
God replied: ""Are the Jews not worthy that I show them favor? In My Torah, I have written, ‘When you have eaten and are satiated, you shall bless,’ and they have nevertheless adopted the stringency of reciting grace after eating an amount equivalent to an olive.""
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The proof-text clearly indicates that the obligation to ""bless"" applies only when one is ""satiated.""
</i>he Sages, however, ordained that one should recite grace after eating [an amount of bread equal] to the size of an olive<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> a <i>k'zayit</i>. This is the measurement generally intended by the Torah for the mitzvot and prohibitions concerned with eating. In contemporary measure, it is equivalent to 28.8 cc according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, and 33 cc according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>.
Note the commentary on Chapter 5, Halachah 16, which discusses the Ra'avad's opinion that anyone who eats a <i>k'zayit</i> of bread is required by the Torah to recite grace.

Blessings 1.2,"Similarly, the Rabbis ordained<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The definition of this obligation as Rabbinical in nature has aroused questions. <i>Berachot</i> 35a states that this concept can be derived through one of the thirteen principles of Biblical interpretation. Thus, it has all the authority of a Torah law. Though the Rambam (see the Introduction to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, General Principle 2) refers to laws derived in this manner as מדברי סופרים - literally, ""from the words of our Sages,"" the same term used here - his intent is not to imply that the law did not originate in the Torah itself.
<i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot,</i> loc. cit.), however, explain that the Talmud ultimately does not accept the interpretation that the obligation is derived from the Torah, and maintain that the obligation to recite blessings is Rabbinic in origin. Even according to these opinions, it appears that the Sages ordained the recitation of blessings rather early in our national history. Midrashim referring to the age of King David explicitly mention the recitation of blessings, and there are intimations of this obligation in references to earlier periods. See also the commentary on Halachah 5.
</i> that we recite blessings before partaking of any food<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>, states: ""It is forbidden to benefit from this world without reciting a blessing."" Therefore,
</i>. Even when one wants to eat the slightest amount of food or drink<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., less than a <i>k'zayit</i> or a <i>revi'it</i>
</i>, one should recite a blessing, and then derive benefit from it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In this instance, however, a blessing need not be recited after eating or drinking.
</i>.<br>Similarly, when smelling a pleasant fragrance, one should recite a blessing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Chapter 9 with regard to the particular blessings required.
</i> and then smell<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 43b quotes Psalms 150:6: ""All souls shall praise God,"" and asks: ""From what does a soul benefit? Fragrance.""
</i>. Anyone who derives benefit [from this world] without reciting a blessing is considered as if he misappropriated a sacred article<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 35a explains that the entire world belongs to God, as Psalms 24:1 declares: ""The earth and its fullness are God's."" Although God allows man to benefit from this world, that license is granted only when man acknowledges God's control by reciting a blessing.
</i>.<br>The Rabbis also ordained that one should recite a blessing after eating or drinking, provided one drinks a <i>revi'it</i> a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Anything less is not considered significant enough to require a blessing afterwards. A blessing beforehand must nevertheless be recited, because ""it is forbidden to benefit from this world without a blessing.""
There is, however, a law which appears to be an exception to this principle:
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The word <i>revi'it</i> means ""a fourth."" It is one fourth of a larger measure, known as a <i>log</i>. In contemporary measure, a <i>revi'it</i> is equivalent to 86.6 cc according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, and 150 cc according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>.
</i>nd eats a <i>k'zayit</i>. A person who [merely] tastes food is not required to recite a blessing before partaking of it or afterwards unless he partakes of a <i>revi'it</i>.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rav David Arameah explains that this law applies only when one spits out the food one tastes. If one swallows it, a blessing is required. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> differs, and maintains that even when a person swallows the food, since his intent is not to benefit from it - but merely to taste it - and he partakes of only a very small amount, a blessing is not required.
</i>"
Blessings 1.3,"Just as we recite blessings for benefit which we derive from the world<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as explained above,
</i>, we should also recite blessings for each mitzvah before we fulfill it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The laws governing the blessings recited over the performance of mitzvot are discussed in Chapter 11.
</i>.<br>Similarly, the Sages instituted many blessings as expressions of praise and thanks to God and as a means of petition<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Chapter 10.
</i>, so that we will always remember the Creator, even though we have not received any benefit or performed a mitzvah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> By reciting blessings over the special events which occur to us, we become conscious of God's control of all aspects of our daily existence. We learn to appreciate Him, not only as the Creator who brought the world into being, but as the One who directs the functioning of our lives and the world around us.

Blessings 1.5,"The text of all the blessings was ordained by Ezra and his court<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 33a explains that when the Men of the Great Assembly established the text of the prayer service (see <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 1:4), they also established the text for the various blessings and for <i>kiddush</i> and <i>havdalah</i>.
This, however, does not mean that the blessings were not recited beforehand. Rather, just as explained with regard to prayer, before Ezra's time each person would recite the blessings according to his own inspiration and ability to express himself. In Ezra's time, many people had difficulty expressing themselves eloquently and, therefore, Ezra and his court established a standard text.
</i>. It is not fit to alter it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> to substitute different words
</i>, to add to it, or to detract from it. Whoever alters the text of a blessing from that ordained by the Sages is making an error<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Radbaz (Vol. 5, Responsum 1424) states that as long as the person mentions God's name, His sovereignty over the world, and the subject of the blessing, he fulfills his obligation even if he does not use the text ordained by the Sages. (This interpretation is borne out by the next halachah.)
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam's phraseology alludes to two types of changes:<br>
a) Changes which do not substantially alter the blessing from the text ordained by the Sages. With regard to such changes, the Rambam uses the expression ""it is not fit,"" which implies that although the person's deed is not desirable, he fulfills his obligation.<br>
b) A change of an innovative nature which alters the text of the blessing entirely. These changes the Rambam considers as ""errors"" which prevent a person from fulfilling his obligation. See also Halachah 13, <i>Berachot</i> 40b, and <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 1:7.
</i>.<br>A blessing that does not include the mention of God's name<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., the phrase י-ה-ו-ה א-להנו (God, our Lord),

</i> is not considered a blessing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and the person reciting it does not fulfill his obligation. See <i>Berachot</i> 40b.

Since the blessings are recited in one continuum, one's original statement is applied to the subsequent blessings as well.

Blessings 1.6,"All the blessings may be recited in any language<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Although the text ordained by Ezra and his court was in Hebrew, there is no absolute requirement to use that language
</i>, provided one recites [a translation of] the text ordained by the Sages<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 185:1-2, which quotes an opinion that maintains that a person who recites a blessing does not fulfill his obligation unless he understands what he is saying, even when he recites the blessing in Hebrew. Although there are other opinions that maintain that as long as the blessing is recited in Hebrew, one fulfills his obligation, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> concludes that it is preferable for a person who does not understand Hebrew to recite the blessings - in particular, the grace - in a language he understands.
</i>. [A person who] changes that text<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">I.e., a language other than “the Holy Tongue,” Hebrew. See <i>Berachot</i> 40b, which states that a person who recites the phrase ""Blessed be God, Master of this bread"" in Aramaic fulfills his obligation for the first blessing of grace. Note the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 167:10) which requires that God's sovereignty over the world also be mentioned.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> reciting a different blessing from that ordained by the Sages
</i> fulfills his obligation nonetheless - since he mentioned God's name, His sovereignty, and the subject of the blessing - although he did so in a ordinary language."
Blessings 1.7,"A person should recite all the blessings loud enough for him to hear what he is saying. Nevertheless, a person who does not recite a blessing out loud fulfills his obligation, whether he verbalizes the blessing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> pronouncing the words with his lips
</i> or merely recites it in his heart<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's statements are based on <i>Berachot</i> 15a-b, which states:
A person who reads the <i>Shema</i> in a tone too low to hear fulfills his obligation. Rabbi Yosse states: ""He does not fulfill his obligation.""...<br>
The difference of opinion applies with regard to the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> because it states, ""Hear, Israel."" With regard to other mitzvot (blessings, Rashi), everyone agrees that one fulfills one's obligation.
The Rambam's decision that, after the fact, one fulfills his obligation by reciting grace or other blessings in thought alone is not accepted by other authorities. Rashi, Rabbenu Asher, the <i>Tur</i>, and the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 185:2 maintain that though one need not recite the blessings out loud, it is necessary to subvocalize them, pronouncing them with one's lips.

Blessings 1.8,"Whenever one recites a blessing, one should not make an interruption between the blessing and the subject for which the blessing is recited<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This applies with regard to both blessings recited before food and blessings recited before performing a mitzvah.
</i>. If one makes an interruption with other matters, one must recite the blessing again<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is a literal translation of the Rambam's words. Note <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 206:3 which states that even remaining silent for the time it takes to say, <i>Shalom alecha, Rebbe</i> constitutes an interruption.
</i>.<br>If, however, one makes an interruption which relates to the subject of the blessing, one does not have to repeat the blessing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See <i>Berachot</i> 40a and commentaries, which explain why each of these statements is connected with the meal.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's phraseology appears to indicate that, at the outset, one should not make any interruption. If, however, the situation demands that an interruption be made or if one inadvertently does so, the blessing need not be repeated when it is of the following nature.
</i>. What is implied? When a person recites a blessing over bread and before eating says, ""Bring salt,"" ""Bring food,"" ""Give so-and-so to eat,"" ""Bring food for the animal,"" or the like, he need not repeat the blessing.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">

Blessings 1.9,"A person who is ritually impure is permitted to recite all the blessings<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 4:8, the Rambam states:
The words of Torah never contract impurity. Rather, they remain pure forever, as [Jeremiah 23:29] states: ""Are not My words as fire...."" Just as fire can never contract impurity, the words of Torah never contract impurity.
In <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 4:4, the Rambam applies these same principles to the words of prayer.
</i>. This applies regardless of whether the impurity is of a type from which one can purify oneself on the same day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> e.g., the impurity which comes as a result of contact with the carcass of an animal. In this case, to regain ritual purity, one must immerse oneself in a <i>mikveh</i> and wait until nightfall.

The same principles apply with regard to the recitation of blessings.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 206:3) adds that a person may not recite any blessings unless there is a separation between his heart and his genitals and his head is covered.

Blessings 1.10,"[The following principle applies to] all blessings: Although a person has already recited them and fulfilled his own obligation<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In one of his responsa, the Rambam explains that the same principle applies when the person reciting the blessing has not fulfilled his obligation, but does not desire to do so at the present time.

Note the <i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 273, which states that, at the outset, a person who has already recited <i>kiddush</i> should not recite <i>kiddush</i> for others, unless they are incapable of doing so themselves.
</i> who have not fulfilled their obligation<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rashi, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 29a, explains this principle on the basis of the concept of ערבות (mutual responsibility) that exists among the Jewish people. Each Jew shares a responsibility for his colleague's observance. Therefore, although he personally has already recited the blessing, he has not discharged his obligation entirely until each of his fellow Jews fulfills the requirements incumbent upon him.
</i>, so that they can fulfill their obligation<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam describes the manner in which the listener fulfills his obligation in the next halachah.
For the above principle to apply, however, the listener must be obligated to fulfill the mitzvah. When the listener is not obligated - e.g., a woman for shofar blowing - a person should not recite a blessing unless he is obligated himself (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 589:6).
</i>.<br>There is, however, one exception: blessings over benefit which is not associated with a mitzvah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> e.g., the blessings recited over food in an ordinary meal.
</i>. In this instance, one may not recite a blessing for others unless one enjoys benefit together with them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In this instance, there is no obligation for a person to partake of this food. Hence, the principle of ערבות does not apply (Rashi, <i>loc. cit.</i>) unless the person reciting the blessing also desires to partake of the food. Should he desire to do so, the blessing he recites may include others as well. (Note an alternate explanation in the commentary on Chapter 5, Halachah 16.)
</i>. Nevertheless, one may recite blessings for benefit which is associated with a mitzvah - e.g., eating matzah on Pesach and reciting <i>kiddush</i> [on Sabbaths and festivals] - f<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., not only the blessing <i>al achilat matzah</i>, which mentions the mitzvah of eating <i>matzah</i>, but also the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>, which is recited for eating bread; not only the blessing of <i>kiddush</i>, but also the blessing <i>borey pri hagafen</i>, on the wine.
</i>or others. They may then eat or drink, even though the one [who recites the blessing] does not eat or drink with them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note <i>Sefer HaKovetz</i>, which states that a person is not allowed to recite<i>hamotzi</i> to enable a colleague to partake of the Sabbath meal when he does not join them. There is reason to assume that, since partaking of such a meal is a mitzvah, one would be allowed to recite a blessing, and thus enable a colleague to do so. Nevertheless, following the reasoning mentioned in <i>Sefer HaKovetz</i>, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 167:20) and commentaries mention only the examples cited by the Rambam.
</i>."
Blessings 1.11,"Whenever a person listens to the entire recitation of a blessing with the intention of fulfilling his obligation<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 213:3) rules that the person reciting the blessing also must intend that the listener fulfill his obligation by hearing the blessing.
The <i>Beit Yosef</i> and the <i>Bayit Chadash</i> 213 explain that this ruling points to a question of a larger scope: Do mitzvot of the Rabbis require intention, or is it possible to fulfill one's obligation by performing the required act without any intent.
According to the latter view, although the person reciting the blessing does not have the intention of fulfilling the obligation of the listener, since ""one who listens is considered as though he responded,"" the listener is considered to have recited the blessing, and thus to have fulfilled his obligation.
In contrast, the former view requires that one have a conscious desire to fulfill one's obligation when fulfilling a Rabbinic obligation. Since the person reciting the blessing did not have such an intention on behalf of the listener, the listener cannot fulfill his obligation.
</i>, he is considered to have fulfilled his obligation although he does not answer <i>Amen</i>. W<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 53b mentions two opinions, one which equates the person answering<i>Amen</i> with the person actually reciting the blessing (the opinion cited by the Rambam), and one which considers the person answering to be on an even higher level.
Thus, with this statement, the Rambam is explaining that, although a person can fulfill his obligation by listening without answering <i>Amen</i>, when he answers he is considered as if he actually recited the blessing himself (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> According to the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 167:13, 213:1), this applies to all blessings. The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 213:1) differs, however, and explains that with regard to blessings for mitzvot, the principle stated by the Rambam is acceptable. With regard to blessings for deriving benefit, however, different rules apply, and a person can fulfill his obligation to recite a blessing by listening to someone else's blessing only when they intentionally sit down to break bread or drink wine together. See the commentary on the following halachah.
<i>Sukkah</i> 38b states:
What is the source which teaches that a person who listens is considered as if he responded?<br>
[II Kings 22:16] mentions: ""all the words of the scroll read by the king."" Did Josaiah [the king] read them? Shafan read them.... Thus, this teaches that a person who listens is considered as if he responded.
</i>hoever answers <i>Amen</i> to a blessing recited by another person is considered as if he recited the blessing himself, provided the person who recites the blessing is obligated to recite that blessing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This excludes a blessing recited by a mentally incapable individual, a deaf-mute, or a child, who are not obligated to fulfill mitzvot (<i>Berachot</i> 20a, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 29a).
In Chapter 5, Halachot 15-16, the Rambam mentions that an adult who did not eat a full meal and is obligated to recite grace only by Rabbinic decree can fulfill his obligation by listening to the blessings recited by a child. This, however, is a unique instance and does not apply to blessings recited in the prayer service or over the fulfillment of other mitzvot. With regard to grace, the child's recitation of the blessings comes as a result of a single Rabbinic obligation. Hence, he can fulfill the mitzvah on behalf of an individual whose obligation is also Rabbinic in origin.
In contrast, with regard to other blessings, the blessings themselves are Rabbinic in origin, and the child's obligation to recite them constitutes a second Rabbinic obligation. Accordingly, he cannot fulfill the mitzvah for someone whose obligation stems from a single Rabbinic decree (<i>Tosafot,</i> Megillah 19b).
</i>.<br>If the person who recites the blessing is obligated only because of a Rabbinic ordinance<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> e.g., an adult male who has not eaten to the point of satiation

It does, however, appear slightly forced. Nevertheless, it is the most appropriate way to interpret the Rambam's words according to the halachah which states that, only with regard to grace, may an adult fulfill his obligation to recite a blessing by answering <i>Amen</i> to a child's blessing.
Rav Kapach presents a unique thesis, maintaining that in this halachah the Rambam is teaching us that an adult can fulfill his obligation to recite any blessing by responding <i>Amen</i> to a blessing recited by a child. His interpretation, though contrary to the accepted halachah, allows for a more direct translation of the Rambam's words.

Blessings 1.12,"When many people gather together to eat [a meal with] bread or to drink wine, and one recites the blessing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Our translation follows the standard text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. According to the source for this law, <i>Berachot</i> 6:6, and the manner it is quoted in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 167:11), it should read, ""one person should recite the blessing."" This is the preferred manner for the group to bless their food, because ""within the multitude of people is the glory of the king"" (Proverbs 14:28 .
<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 167:18 relates that today, even when eating a meal as a group, it is customary for each person to recite the blessing over bread himself, so that an interruption is not made between the recitation of the blessing and partaking of the food.

This reflects the position of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 167:13). The <i>Magen Avraham</i>, however, differs, and maintains that one cannot fulfill his obligation to recite blessings that involve benefit unless one had the intention of eating together with the other person and responding to his blessings. This view takes a more lenient position regarding blessings over mitzvot, which we are obligated to fulfill, than regarding the blessings over food, which we are not obligated to eat.

With regard to bread and wine. With regard to other foods, however, which do not require [premeditated intent] to be eaten together as a group<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Our interpretation of הסבה is based on the Rambam's Commentary on the <i>Mishnah</i>, <i>Berachot</i> 6:6.

(Significantly, on this issue there is a responsum which is attributed to the Rambam. However, it has raised difficulties among the commentaries and its authenticity has been challenged.)
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 213:1) accepts the Rambam's opinion, but states that this applies only when people sit around a single table as a group. Eating in a single room is not sufficient. The Ramah, however, quotes the Ra'avad's view.

In that passage, our Sages declare that, ""the Gates of <i>Gan Eden</i> will be opened for a person who answers <i>Amen</i> with all his strength.""
The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 124) explains that <i>Amen</i> implies an acknowledgement of the truth of a statement. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 124:9 adds that when answered in response to a request, it also has the implication that one prays that the request be fulfilled speedily.

The reason we do not respond to a gentile's blessing is that we assume that although he mentions God's name, his blessing is directed toward the alien deity in which he believes.
Rabbenu Asher maintains that a person should respond <i>Amen</i> to a gentile's blessing when he hear the blessing recited in its entirety and he supports his statements with a quote from the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 8:8. The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 215:2) quotes this opinion. There is not necessarily a contradiction between the latter ruling and the Rambam's. The Rambam's statements can be interpreted as applying to gentiles in general, while those of the Jerusalem Talmud, as applying to those gentiles - e.g., Moslems - who are known not to worship any idols or alien gods.

He explains that after Sancheriv exiled the ten tribes, he settled several gentile tribes in their land. These tribes adopted certain aspects of Jewish practice. Hence, with regard to certain laws, the Sages considered them as converts. Afterward, however, the Sages discovered that they were idolaters. From that time onward, they were considered as other gentiles.

There, the Talmud relates that the synagogue in Alexandria was so large that flags would be waved as a signal that the <i>chazan</i> had finished a blessing, and then everyone would recite <i>Amen</i>, even though they had not heard the blessing themselves.
[Rashi (<i>loc. cit.</i>) interprets ""an orphaned <i>Amen</i>"" as reciting <i>Amen</i> although one does not know which blessing was recited. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) accepts the stringencies that result from both opinions.

The Ra'avad and Rabbenu Asher differ with the Rambam's decision and maintain that the fact that a person violates a commandment against eating forbidden food should not cause him to violate another commandment and benefit from the world without praising God. The<i>Turei Zahav</i> 196:1 attempts to resolve the two views and offers a compromise: A person who intentionally violates a prohibition should not recite a blessing. If, however, a person eats a forbidden food inadvertently, he should recite a blessing afterwards.
Significantly, the <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 196) explains that even the Rambam would agree that a sick person who is required to eat a forbidden food for medicinal purposes should recite a blessing. There are, however, authorities who differ with this ruling as well.

Human Dispositions 1.1,"Each and every man possesses many character traits. Each trait is very different and distant from the others<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Many commentaries assume that the Rambam is stating simply that there are many personality types, which he proceeds to describe: e.g., the angry man, the calm man, etc. They quote various sources in support of this viewpoint, among them <i>Berachot</i> 58a: ""Whoever sees a multitude of Jews recites the blessing: 'Blessed is...the wise who knows the hidden secrets,' because just as their natures are not similar, neither are their faces.""
However, by stating that the many character traits are possessed by ""each and every man,"" it is possible that Rambam is implying more than that there are people with different traits. Though in <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> (The Guide to the Perplexed) 2:40 the Rambam himself elaborates upon that idea, it can be said that here his intent is different. He is emphasizing the degree to which each individual's personality is a combination of different traits, which may be unrelated and even distant from each other. Anger, generosity, and modesty, for example, can be found together in the same person, much in the same way that tenants of all sorts - unrelated to each other - can be housed in a common building.
To illustrate these traits, the Rambam employs concrete examples of extreme personalities, so that the contrasts can be appreciated more easily.
</i>.<br>One type of man is wrathful; he is constantly angry. [In contrast,] there is the calm individual who is never moved to anger<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Obviously, anger or passivity are not these individuals' only traits. Surely, they share the full spectrum of human emotions. However, in these individuals, these traits are most prominent.

</i>. There is the man ruled by his appetites - he will never be satisfied from pursuing his desires, and [conversely,] the very pure of heart, who does not desire even the little that the body needs<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This pair of contrasting personality types deal with a person's appetites which can be satisfied by sensual experience. For example, gluttony is stimulated and satisfied by taste. In contrast, the traits mentioned below - the desire for money or the lack of desire for it - do not involve the senses.
</i>.<br>There is the greedy man, who cannot be satisfied<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Literally, ""whose soul is not satisfied."" Perhaps the Rambam uses ""soul,"" both here and with regard to the man ruled by his sensual appetites, because it is the desire that characterizes the man, not the performance of an action as such. A man may never indulge his passion for food, or actually amass money and yet, be gluttonous or greedy. Though, in practice, his ability to gratify his ambitions may be limited by external factors, the desires of his soul are, nonetheless, unlimited.
</i> with all the money in the world, as [Ecclesiastes 5:9] states: ""A lover of money never has his fill of money<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Here, the Rambam describes an example where the desire for money becomes a goal in itself. In contrast, a man who gathers money so that he can buy things or achieve power is not interested in money per se. Although he may be faulted for different reasons, he is not greedy for money. On the other hand, for the ""lover of money,"" money itself becomes his raison d'etre.
</i>."" [In contrast,] there is the man who puts a check on himself;<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> literally, he ""cuts himself short."" II Kings 19:26 employs a similar usage of the root <i>ketzar</i>: ""And the inhabitants are broken, with shortened (i.e., weakened or useless) arms.""

In Chapter 2, Halachah 7, this type is described clearly as: ""lazy and an idler."" This is the description, too, in the Rambam's Introduction to <i>Avot - Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4.
</i>.<br>There is [the miser,]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">

who torments himself with hunger, gathering [his possessions] close to himself. - The terminology the Rambam uses emphasizes the miser's need to be close to his money and possessions. Similar, but not exactly correspondent, expressions are found in the Bible (Proverbs 13:11  and the Talmud (<i>Bava Kama</i> 80a).
</i> who torments himself with hunger, gathering [his possessions] close to himself. Whenever he spends a penny of his own, he does so with great pain. [Conversely,] there is [the spendthrift,] who consciously wastes his entire fortune.<br>All other traits follow the same pattern [of contrast]. For example: the overly elated and the depressed;<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam is not referring to an average optimist and a pessimist. Rather, he describes personalities who do not have a grip on reality. <i>onain</i> is the term used for the bereaved who has not yet buried his dead. <i>mehulal</i>, the other extreme, is used by Jeremiah 51:7 to refer to a state of intoxication and delirious drunkenness.
</i> the stingy and the freehanded<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Our translation of <i>shua</i> is clearly evident from <i>Hilchot Matnot Ani'im</i> 7:11. It follows that <i>chili</i> represents the opposite extreme. (See also Ibn Ezra, Isaiah 32:5.)
The difference between this pair of traits and the miser-spendthrift pair mentioned above is that the latter refers to a person's conduct toward himself, while the former refers to his conduct with regard to others. The stingy man, unlike the miser, may spend money for his own needs, but is tightfisted when others are concerned. By the same token, a freehanded man need not necessarily indulge himself, though he is generous when giving charity. Though this may sound praiseworthy, when taken to extremes it can also prove dangerous, because a person may hurt himself in the process of giving excessively to another. (See <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>.)
</i>; the cruel and the softhearted; the coward and the rash. and the like.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> We find a longer treatment of personal characteristics in the Rambam's <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4.
</i>"
Human Dispositions 1.2,"Between each trait and the [contrasting] trait at the other extreme, there are intermediate points, each distant from the other<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> understands this as follows: Let us imagine a line drawn from one extreme to another - between the stingy and the freehanded, for example. All who are neither stingy nor freehanded stand between them. They are all intermediate, whether they tend towards stinginess or freehandedness. Each point along this imaginary line stands apart - ""is distant"" - from the others on that line. In a diagram, this idea might be depicted as follows:<br>
X-----*-------*------*-------*----------*---------*X<br>
Stingy intermediate points freehanded.
However, it is highly unlikely that all the Rambam wishes to teach us is that there are many intermediate points of temperament between the extremes. After all, that is self-evident. Furthermore, in each set of associated temperaments - for example, stinginess and freehandedness - only three points on the line are of importance to the Rambam in clarifying his view of personality development: the two extremes and the midpoint. Why should he mention all the other intermediate possibilities?
Thus, it appears that the Rambam is telling us that there is a midpoint temperament between each pair of contrasting extremes. Given the entire range of human temperaments, there are a number of midpoints which are not necessarily related to each other. For example, the midpoint for generosity may be very different from the midpoint for humility. Thus, in Halachah 1, the Rambam stated that our personality traits are ""different and distant;"" in this halachah, he makes a parallel statement about the midpoints.
</i>.<br>With regard to all the traits: a man has some from the beginning of his conception<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., the Rambam distinguishes between genetic traits and those that are acquired.
</i>, in accordance with his bodily nature<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., these traits are not transferred genetically. However, a person is born with a tendency towards them.
In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam elaborates on this issue at length. He explains that some people are born with a brain whose internal chemistry is prone to intellectual achievement. However, if this person does not develop this tendency, he will not automatically become a thinker.
Similarly, others have leanings towards courage or cowardice. Nevertheless, these are merely tendencies, and they will not manifest themselves unless consciously developed. Also, these tendencies are, at all times, subject to man's control. We are granted free will, and choose our course of behavior.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Here, we see an interrelation between body and soul. Certain temperaments are produced by or relate to particular physical characteristics.
[In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam states: ""From the outset of a person's [life], he has neither virtues nor vices...."" However, there is not necessarily a contradiction between <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> and this halachah. The possession of certain character traits does not determine whether one will use them for a vice or a virtue.]

In these few words, the Rambam includes all the people who might influence a person's character development: his parents, siblings, teachers, peers, and others. Also, note Chapter 6, Halachah 1.

The nature of ""the straight path"" is explained in detail in the following halachah.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., the path that good men follow. This translation is based on the fact that the word ""path"" is in the singular, while the modifier ""good"" is in the plural.
</i>. This is the straight path."
Human Dispositions 1.4,"The straight path<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This expression is also used in <i>Avot</i> 2:1. In his commentary on that Mishnah, the Rambam cites his explanation of the middle path in the fourth chapter of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>.
</i>: This [involves discovering] the midpoint temperament of each and every trait that man possesses [within his personality.]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., a path develops out of a series of midpoints.
</i> This refers to the trait which is equidistant from either of the extremes, without being close to either of them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> These statements echo the opening remarks of the fourth chapter of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>:
The good acts are those balanced ones midway between two extremes. Both of the extremes are bad - one reflects excess and the other, want. The virtues [good traits] are temperaments and habits which are midway between these two bad tendencies.<br>
These actions [good actions] are produced as a result of these [the good] traits.
Despite the similarity between the Rambam's statements here and those quoted, there is a slight difference. Here, the Rambam focuses on good traits, while in <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, he emphasizes good actions.
</i>.<br>Therefore, the early Sages instructed a man to evaluate his traits<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam appears to be referring to <i>Sotah</i> 5b: ""Whoever evaluates his paths in this world will merit and witness God's salvation.""
</i>, to calculate them and to direct them along the middle path<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> At the conclusion of Chapter 4 of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, the Rambam writes:
When a man weighs his actions constantly and directs them towards their midpoints, he will be on the most elevated human plane possible. He will thereby approach God and grasp His will. This is the most perfect path in the service of God.
Constant introspection is a necessary element in any program of personal and spiritual growth. Even when a person has the highest goals, unless he frequently looks himself squarely in the mirror and examines his behavior, he may make gross errors.
</i>, so that he will be sound {of body}<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> We have enclosed the words ""of body"" with brackets because they are not found in authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> and are problematic. Though a properly balanced temperament may also lead to physical health, this does not appear to be the Rambam's intent.
If the Hebrew <i>bigufo</i> is omitted as suggested, the meaning of <i>shaleim</i> would be altered from ""sound"" to ""complete"" or ""perfect.""
</i>.<br>For example: he should not be wrathful, easily angered; nor be like the dead, without feeling, rather he should [adopt] an intermediate course; i.e., he should display anger<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Our translation is based on Chapter 2, Halachah 3. (Note also the commentary of the <i>Knesset HaGedolah</i>.)
</i> only when the matter is serious enough to warrant it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam appears to be referring to matters which evoke personal feelings. Nevertheless, the <i>Misrat Moshe</i> interprets this passage as referring to an instance in which Torah law would require a display of anger - e.g., a colleague's transgression of Torah law.
</i>, in order to prevent the matter from recurring. S<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This refers to physical desire.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
</i>imilarly, he should not desire anything other than that which the body needs and cannot exist without, as [Proverbs 13:25] states<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam quotes supporting verses for only two of the ""intermediate traits;"" perhaps, because his description of the middle-of-the-road position for these traits might appear to veer toward one extreme. We might expect the intermediate point between gluttony and its opposite extreme to be eating to one's satisfaction. However, here we are told that we should desire only what is sufficient in order to exist.
However, the Rambam is not telling us to deny ourselves satisfaction. Deuteronomy 8:10 teaches: ""You shall eat and be satisfied, and bless God, your Lord."" Based on that verse, <i>Berachot</i> 48b explains that we are obligated to recite grace only when we feel physically satisfied. (The Rambam quotes this concept in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 1:1.) In Chapter 3, Halachah 1, and in <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, he elaborates on the negative aspects of asceticism.
Thus, his intent cannot be that we deny our desires, but rather that we school ourselves to desire and feel satisfied with what we need, without excess. This is a dominant theme in the sections on diet in Chapter 4, and those describing the conduct of a Torah sage in Chapter 5.
</i>: ""The righteous man eats to satisfy his soul<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The verse continues: ""But the belly of the wicked will want."" The commentaries note that the contrast between the two does not center on the quantity of food they eat, but on the attitude with which they eat it. Because the righteous are not given over to pursuit of gratification, they can be satisfied. Conversely, it is the gluttony of the wicked which actually causes their want.
Note also the Midrashic interpretations of this verse:
""The righteous..."" This refers to Eliezer, who said to Rebecca: ""Let me sip a little water"" (Genesis 24:17  - a single sip.<br>
""And the belly of the wicked will want."" This refers to Esau, who said to Jacob: ""Stuff me..."" (Genesis 25:30 . Rabbi Yitzchak ben Zeira said: he opened his mouth agape like a camel and said: ""I will open my mouth and you put it in"" (<i>Tanchumah; Pinchas</i> 13; <i>BaMidbar Rabbah</i> 21:18).
</i>.""<br>Also, he shall not labor in his business except to gain what he needs for immediate use, as [Psalms 37:16] states:<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Here again, the Rambam quotes a Biblical verse, because his definition of an intermediate path may seem extreme. The verse also clarifies that the Rambam is not denigrating the idea of work, but excessive preoccupation with one's profession as a means of acquiring possessions.
It is highly unlikely that the Rambam would criticize work per se. Note Proverbs 6:6: ""Sluggard, go to the ant, see its ways and become wise;"" and <i>Berachot</i> 8a:
He who enjoys the toil of his hands is greater than one who fears God..., as it is stated: ""If you eat of the work of you hands, you are fortunate and will possess the good"" (Psalms 128:2 .<br>
""You are fortunate"" - in this life, and ""will possess the good"" - in the world to come.
The Rambam, himself, quotes the latter passage in <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 3:11. Thus, the Rambam is not criticizing a person for working hard, but rather teaching us that work and its profits should not be our greatest priorities.
</i> ""A little is good for the righteous man<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The verse in its entirety expresses a contrast: ""A little is better for the righteous man than the great wealth that many [of the] wicked possess."" Note the commentary of ibn Ezra: ""The righteous man will be happier with his small lot than the wicked with their great wealth.""
</i>.""<br>He should not be overly stingy<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The printed editions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> have <i>yikfotz</i> (close his hand). However, most manuscripts use the term: <i>yikabetz</i> (gather).
<i>Yikfotz</i> recalls Deuteronomy 15:7: ""Do not close your hand from your needy brother."" Thus, the contrasting extreme would be freehandedness. <i>Yikabetz</i>, like <i>vikubatz</i> in Halachah 1, reflects miserly behavior, the opposite of which is being a spendthrift. The variant texts might reflect a difference of opinion as to which opposing extremes the Rambam had in mind.

<b>He should not be overly elated and laugh [excessively] -</b> Such expressive ""happiness"" is often a sign of inner discontent and suffering.
<b>nor be sad and depressed in spirit. Rather, he should be quietly happy at all times -</b> his joy should be a composed sense of satisfaction.
[In this context, see the Ramah's conclusion of his notes to <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> (697:1) in which he quotes Proverbs 15:15: ""A good-hearted person is always celebrating.""]
<b>with a friendly countenance. -</b> In his commentary on <i>Avot</i> 1:14, the Rambam defines ""a friendly countenance"" as ""a spirit of will and gentility.""

<b>This path is the path of the wise. -</b> i.e., those whose behavior is controlled by their intellect
<b>Every man whose traits are intermediate and equally balanced can be called a ""wise man."" -</b> Note the contrast to the ""pious"" of the following halachah. Though the published editions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> include this line as the final concept in our halachah, many of the authoritative manuscripts place it as the beginning of Halachah 5.

Human Dispositions 1.5,"A person who carefully [examines] his [behavior]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in an effort to achieve the desired intermediate path
</i>, and therefore deviates slightly from the mean t<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam explains that one can refine and correct his behavior by balancing a tendency for excess in one direction by intentionally forcing oneself to adopt the opposite extreme. (See Chapter 2, Halachah 2.) He continues:
Therefore, the pious did not allow themselves to fix their traits at the midpoint, but would bend slightly to the side of excess or want as a hedge and a guard.
He goes on to explain that, even for the pious, these extremes are not ends in themselves, but means to help them overcome natural tendencies. Thus, both the pious and a person of underdeveloped character may act in an extreme manner. However, the difference between them is that the behavior of the pious is carefully calculated with the intent of refining his personality, while the underdeveloped person does so without thought, as a natural response to his whims and fancies.

</i> One who shuns pride<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> At first glance, the choice of pride as an example is rather problematic, because in Chapter 2, Halachah 3, the Rambam states:
There are traits for which it is forbidden for a person to follow an intermediate path.... Such a trait is pride...<br>
The proper path is not that a person should merely be humble, but rather hold himself very lowly...<br>
Therefore, our Sages commanded: ""Be very, very humble of spirit.""
It is possible to explain that because of the negative aspects of the quality of pride, the middle path that one should follow in regard to it does not resemble the middle paths of the other traits and may appear as an extreme. Pride represents one extreme, its converse being absolute lack of concern for self to the extent that one walks around in rags. Between these extremes are a number of intermediate points: modesty - which might normally be considered as the intermediate level; humility - which the Rambam considers as the true middle path; and extreme humility - which is pious behavior (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>). See also the commentary on the halachah cited above.
Possibly, it is the exaggerated contrasts in this set of traits that make it the most fitting example to demonstrate the principle of the middle path that the Rambam espouses. These gross differences allow for the possibility of clear distinctions.
</i> and turns to the other extreme<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> emphasizes that one need not actually adopt the other extreme, but rather, he should tend his behavior in that direction.
</i> and carries himself lowly is called pious. This is the quality of piety<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> which represents a deviation from the mean.
</i>. However, if he separates himself [from pride] only to the extent that he reaches the mean and displays humility, he is called wise. This is the quality of wisdom<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his commentary on <i>Avot</i> 5:6, the Rambam contrasts the wise and the pious:
A boor is one who lacks both intellectual and ethical development...<br>
A wise man possesses both these qualities in a complete way, as is fitting.<br>
<i>A pious man is a wise man</i> who increases his piety - i.e., his emotional development - until he tends toward one extreme, as explained in Chapter 4 [of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>], and his deeds exceed his wisdom.
Thus, the wise man is one whose ethical behavior has been developed to the point at which it reflects his intellectual sophistication. He is able to appreciate the mean of each trait and express it within the context of his daily life. The pious man also possesses this quality, but due to his desire for ultimate self-refinement, he is willing to sacrifice himself and tend slightly to the extreme in certain instances.
Although in this halachah, the Rambam differentiates between the middle path - the path of the wise - and ""beyond the measure of the law"" - the path of the pious, in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 5:11 he describes how, ""according to the greatness of the Sage, should be the care he takes to go beyond the measure of the law."" Thus, it appears that a truly wise man will ultimately seek pious ways.

</i>or others, towards the first extreme. This is referred to<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> by our Sages...
</i> as [behavior] beyond the measure of the law<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> We find this expression used in a number of Talmudic passages. For example, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 30b relates that Rabbi Yishmael, Rabbi Yossi's son, was on a journey. A porter traveling the same road asked him to help lift a load of wood. Rabbi Yishmael was a distinguished scholar, and, therefore, this base task would have been demeaning for him. Nevertheless, rather than refuse the porter entirely, Rabbi Yishmael purchased his entire load from him. This was considered as behavior beyond the measure of the law.
See also <i>Berachot</i> 7a and 45b, <i>Bava Kama</i> 100a, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 24b. However, in these and other Talmudic passages where the term is used, the emphasis appears to be on the ethical or legal imperative involved, without stressing the aspect of character development. [Note <i>Hilchot Aveidah</i> 11:7, the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat</i> 259:3 and 263:3, and <i>Sefer Mitzvot Katan</i> (Positive Commandment 49), which mention our obligation to go beyond the measure of the law.]
Thus, the Rambam appears merely to be borrowing the term used by the Sages without referring to any specific instance. The path of behavior prescribed by one's intellect corresponds to law, and an intentional deviation from that course for the sake of piety is ""beyond the measure of the law.""
</i>.<br>We are commanded<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Sifre</i> (on Deuteronomy 13:5  states: 'You shall walk after God, your Lord' - this is a positive commandment."" The <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Ki Tetze</i>, p. 270) also makes a similar statement. However, neither source elaborates.
Among the <i>Geonim</i>, the <i>Ba'al Halachot Gedolot</i> does list it as a commandment. Rav Sa'adiah Gaon does not include it as a specific commandment.
<i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive mitzvah 8) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 610) include this as one of the Torah's 613 mitzvot. However, the Rambam's inclusion of this commandment as one of the 613 mitzvot is somewhat problematic. In <i>Shoresh</i> 4 of his introduction to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, he states that he does not include any ""general mitzvah"" which does not involve a specific activity in his reckoning of the 613 mitzvot. For this reason, ""Observe My statutes"" (Leviticus 19:19  or ""Be holy"" (Leviticus 19:2  are not included in the 613 mitzvot. On the surface, the command the Rambam mentions here also seems to be an all encompassing charge to develop ourselves spiritually without any specific activity.
Rav Avraham, the Rambam's son, was asked this question, and he explained that here the specific activity implied by this commandment is the development of our emotions and character traits. A somewhat deeper perspective can be gained from the Rambam's own description of the mitzvah. When listing the mitzvot at the beginning of these halachot, he states that the mitzvah is ""to imitate God's ways"" and in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, he defines the mitzvah as ""to imitate Him, blessed be He, according to our potential.""
The implication of these statements is that man has a constant obligation to carry out all of his deeds and guide the progress of his emotional development with the intent of imitating God. (See <i>Likkutei Sichot, Tavo</i> 5748, and note the commentary on the following halachah.)
</i> to walk in these intermediate paths<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Despite the Rambam's praise of piety, his very description of it as ""beyond the measure of the law"" implies that, though it is desirable, it cannot be considered as obligatory.
<b>and they are good and straight paths - as [Deuteronomy 28:9] states: ""And you shall walk in His ways."" -</b> The Rambam describes this mitzvah in the following halachah. Indeed, the authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> include the paragraph we have just explained as the beginning of Halachah 6.

As emphasized in the introduction to this text, the Rambam has structured the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> with the intent of ""revealing all the laws to the great and to the small with regard to each and every mitzvah."" He does not mention philosophical and ethical concepts unless they are halachot - i.e., practical directives for our behavior.
In this context, we can understand the structure of this chapter. The Rambam set out to describe the mitzvah of following God's ways. As stated in this halachah, he perceives this to mean developing our personalities by emulating the qualities which the Creator reveals. As he states in the following halachah, those qualities are identical with the middle path of human behavior. Therefore, in the initial halachot of this chapter, the Rambam sets out to describe the nature of human personality and the ideal temperaments - the middle path - that man should seek to achieve. Having laid down this foundation, he is able to define that mitzvah in this halachah and begin offering directives for its fulfillment in Halachah 7.
<b>[Our Sages] taught [the following] explanation of this mitzvah -</b> The Rambam appears to be referring to the <i>Sifre, Ekev</i> 11:22, which he quotes in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (ibid.). That explanation is also paralleled in the <i>Mechiltah</i> (Exodus 14:2  and <i>Shabbat</i> 133b.
It must be noted that other Talmudic and Midrashic sources interpret the commandment to imitate God in a different light. Note <i>Sotah</i> 14a:
[Deuteronomy 13:5 states]: ""You shall walk after God, your Lord."" Is it possible for man to walk after the Divine Presence? Has it not been stated: ""Behold, God, your Lord, is a consuming fire"" (Deuteronomy 4:24 ?<br>
Rather, [it means] one should follow the qualities of God.<br>
Just as He dresses the naked..., you, too, should dress the naked;<br>
God visited the sick...; you, too, should visit the sick;<br>
God comforted the bereaved...;you, too, should comfort the bereaved;<br>
God buried the dead...; you, too, should bury the dead.
In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam mentions emulating both God's deeds and His qualities. Similarly, <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, in its description of this mitzvah, and the <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> in his commentary - both here in <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> and also in <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> - mention both deeds and qualities.
There is not necessarily a contradiction between these two emphases. As mentioned above, our actions reflect our personalities. Therefore, it follows that developing our characters in the manner outlined by the Rambam in this halachah will ultimately produce the good deeds mentioned by our Sages in the passage from <i>Sotah</i>.
Nevertheless, deed is often not a reflection of character. A person with many severe character faults may still do good deeds. Hence, for the ""resemblance of God"" to be complete, it is not sufficient merely to perform positive deeds. Rather, a person must undergo internal change by developing his character. Therefore, the Rambam focuses more on this aspect of the commandment.
<b>Just as He is called ""Gracious,"" you shall be gracious; Just as He is called ""Merciful,"" you shall be merciful; Just as He is called ""Holy,"" you shall be holy; -</b> Neither the <i>Sifre</i> nor the other sources quoted above mention the trait of holiness. Rather, the third trait mentioned is ""piety."" Perhaps, since the Rambam gave a specific definition for piety in the previous halachah within his conception of personality development, he does not mention it in the present context to prevent any possible confusion.
<b>In a similar manner, the prophets -</b> The Rambam's choice of words is somewhat surprising since many of these expressions are also found in the Torah as well as in the prophetic works. However, in the Torah these titles are mentioned by Moses or the other prophets. Perhaps this is the Rambam's intent.
<b>called God by other titles: ""Slow to anger,"" ""Abundant in kindness,"" ""Righteous,"" ""Just,"" ""Perfect,"" ""Almighty,"" ""Powerful,"" and the like. -</b> In <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:11-12 and in detail in <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> (Guide to the Perplexed), Vol. I, Chapters 53 and 54, the Rambam explains that these names are not descriptions of God, who cannot be defined by any specific quality. To do so would limit Him and detract from His infinite and transcendent state of being.
Rather, the use of these titles must be understood as follows: God brings about activities, which, had they been carried out by man, would have been motivated by these emotional states. For example, instead of utterly destroying the Jews after the sin of the Golden Calf, God allowed our people to continue. Were such a deed to have been performed by a human ruler, we would describe him as ""slow to anger."" Though that term cannot serve as a description for God - for He cannot be described - the Torah and the prophets referred to Him by such terms with the following intent.
<b>[They did so] to inform us that these are good and just paths. -</b> i.e., God acted in ways which we identify with these qualities - and the Torah and the prophets mention these actions - because these are attributes which man should strive to achieve.
<b>A person is obligated to accustom himself to these paths and [to try to] resemble Him - <i>Likkutei Sichot</i> (ibid.) states that with the latter phrase, the Rambam is adding a new thought. As explained above, God cannot be described by any particular quality. If He manifests a quality, it is for a specific intent.<br></b>
<b>In <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> (ibid., Chapter 54), the Rambam mentions that the leader of a country should act in a similar manner.<br></b>
<b>Sometimes he will be merciful and generous to some people - not because of his feelings and natural compassion, but because they are deserving of such treatment.<br>
Sometimes he will bear a grudge, seek revenge, and rage against certain people - not out of feelings of anger... - but in order to produce positive results....<br>
The ultimate ideal man can achieve is to imitate God according to his potential... i.e., to have our deeds resemble His deeds.<br></b>
For this reason, human behavior should not be motivated by the spontaneous expression of emotion. Rather, man's emotions should arise as the result of a deliberate process of thought.
This reflects themes brought out in the previous halachot of this chapter: that a person must constantly evaluate and review his emotions (Halachah 4); that it is a wise man who is able to appreciate the middle path (Halachah 5).
This is what is meant by the imitation of God: that a person not be controlled by the unchecked expression of his emotions. Rather, he should control his feelings and, motivated by his desire to resemble God, search to find the correct and proper quality, the middle path, appropriate to the situation at hand.
to the extent of his ability. - for man is ultimately finite in nature, and no true resemblance to God is possible.

That explanation is also paralleled in the <i>Mechiltah</i> (Exodus 14:2  and <i>Shabbat</i> 133b.
It must be noted that other Talmudic and Midrashic sources interpret the commandment to imitate God in a different light. Note <i>Sotah</i> 14a:
[Deuteronomy 13:5 states]: ""You shall walk after God, your Lord."" Is it possible for man to walk after the Divine Presence? Has it not been stated: ""Behold, God, your Lord, is a consuming fire"" (Deuteronomy 4:24 ?<br>
Rather, [it means] one should follow the qualities of God.<br>
Just as He dresses the naked..., you, too, should dress the naked;<br>
God visited the sick...; you, too, should visit the sick;<br>
God comforted the bereaved...;you, too, should comfort the bereaved;<br>
God buried the dead...; you, too, should bury the dead.
In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam mentions emulating both God's deeds and His qualities. Similarly, <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, in its description of this mitzvah, and the <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> in his commentary - both here in <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> and also in <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> - mention both deeds and qualities.
There is not necessarily a contradiction between these two emphases. As mentioned above, our actions reflect our personalities. Therefore, it follows that developing our characters in the manner outlined by the Rambam in this halachah will ultimately produce the good deeds mentioned by our Sages in the passage from <i>Sotah</i>.
Nevertheless, deed is often not a reflection of character. A person with many severe character faults may still do good deeds. Hence, for the ""resemblance of God"" to be complete, it is not sufficient merely to perform positive deeds. Rather, a person must undergo internal change by developing his character. Therefore, the Rambam focuses more on this aspect of the commandment.
</i>:<br>
Just as He is called ""Gracious,"" you shall be gracious;<br>
Just as He is called ""Merciful,"" you shall be merciful;<br>
Just as He is called ""Holy,"" you shall be holy;<br>I<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's choice of words is somewhat surprising since many of these expressions are also found in the Torah as well as in the prophetic works. However, in the Torah these titles are mentioned by Moses or the other prophets. Perhaps this is the Rambam's intent.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Neither the <i>Sifre</i> nor the other sources quoted above mention the trait of holiness. Rather, the third trait mentioned is ""piety."" Perhaps, since the Rambam gave a specific definition for piety in the previous halachah within his conception of personality development, he does not mention it in the present context to prevent any possible confusion.
</i>n a similar manner, the prophets called God by other titles: ""Slow to anger,"" ""Abundant in kindness,"" ""Righteous,"" ""Just,"" ""Perfect,"" ""Almighty,"" ""Powerful,"" and the like<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:11-12 and in detail in <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> (Guide to the Perplexed), Vol. I, Chapters 53 and 54, the Rambam explains that these names are not descriptions of God, who cannot be defined by any specific quality. To do so would limit Him and detract from His infinite and transcendent state of being.
Rather, the use of these titles must be understood as follows: God brings about activities, which, had they been carried out by man, would have been motivated by these emotional states. For example, instead of utterly destroying the Jews after the sin of the Golden Calf, God allowed our people to continue. Were such a deed to have been performed by a human ruler, we would describe him as ""slow to anger."" Though that term cannot serve as a description for God - for He cannot be described - the Torah and the prophets referred to Him by such terms with the following intent.
</i>. [They did so] to inform us that these are good and just paths<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
For this reason, human behavior should not be motivated by the spontaneous expression of emotion. Rather, man's emotions should arise as the result of a deliberate process of thought.
This reflects themes brought out in the previous halachot of this chapter: that a person must constantly evaluate and review his emotions (Halachah 4); that it is a wise man who is able to appreciate the middle path (Halachah 5).
This is what is meant by the imitation of God: that a person not be controlled by the unchecked expression of his emotions. Rather, he should control his feelings and, motivated by his desire to resemble God, search to find the correct and proper quality, the middle path, appropriate to the situation at hand.

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., God acted in ways which we identify with these qualities - and the Torah and the prophets mention these actions - because these are attributes which man should strive to achieve.
</i>. A person is obligated to accustom himself to these paths and [to try to] resemble Him to the extent of his ability."
Human Dispositions 1.7,"How can one train himself to follow these temperaments to the extent that they become a permanent fixture of his [personality]?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Having established personality development as a mitzvah in the previous halachah, the Rambam begins his explanation of how this mitzvah is fulfilled.
</i><br>He should perform - repeat - and perform a third time<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Thus, a person's deeds will shape his character traits.
In this process of personal change, the stress is on the repetition of an act, and not on its quantity or intensity. In his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Avot</i> 3:15, the Rambam writes that giving a thousand coins to one person at one time is not as effective in stimulating feelings of generosity as giving a single coin one thousand times.
As mentioned in Halachah 4, though the Rambam's explanations in this chapter parallel those of the fourth chapter of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, the texts differ in stressing actions (as the opening lines of that chapter imply), or on character development, which is the theme of our text.
For this reason, the two texts also perceive the process of causation differently. In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, the Rambam states: ""These actions [good actions] are produced as a result of these [the good] traits,"" while here he sees the traits being produced by the actions.
Nevertheless, the two texts do not actually contradict each other. Both statements are true. Our deeds reflect our personalities, and they also help shape those personalities. Generally, this means that a person's behavior will reinforce and strengthen the character traits that motivated those very deeds. However, this chapter - and more particularly, this halachah - deals with a person who has made a commitment to change and refine his character. Therefore - based on his intellect and the directives of the Torah, rather than his spontaneous feelings - he chooses to perform deeds that will bring about this process of inner change.

He should do this constantly, until these acts are easy for him and do not present any difficulty<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> A trait possessed by a person produces activities naturally and spontaneously. However, if one has not acquired a trait as yet, certain actions will be foreign to his nature, and one must trouble himself to perform them.
For example, a liberal man gives charity naturally; the miser must force himself to give. The action for each is the same, but not the inner feelings.

The Rambam describes God as the Creator with reference to the Divine qualities he describes in these halachot. Before the existence of the world and man, there would be no purpose for God to reveal these qualities, for until man's creation, no one could learn from or emulate them.

In this manner, our behavior bears a resemblance to God's transcendence of worldly matters.

The <i>Tanya</i> (<i>Iggeret HaTeshuvah</i>, Chapter 1) explains the rationale for this principle. Man's purpose in this world is to spread Godly light through the observance of mitzvot. Accordingly, the observance of these mitzvot is always given preference when there is such a conflict.

First, that not only a garment which is generally worn at night, but even one which is worn primarily during the day, should not have <i>techelet</i> attached to it, lest one wear it during the night.
This also sheds light on a more involved issue. There is a difference of opinion among the Rabbis if the exclusion of wearing tzitzit at night applies to all tzitzit, or if it applies only to garments which are worn primarily at night. According to the latter opinion, garments worn primarily at night do not require tzitzit, even when worn during the day. In contrast, a garment which is worn primarily during the day requires tzitzit, even during the night and one does not transgress the prohibition against <i>sha'atnez</i> when wearing it at that time.
By altering the terminology used by the Talmud, the Rambam indicates his acceptance of the first perspective. Rabbenu Asher is the primary exponent of the second position. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 18:1) mentions both views without reaching a conclusion.

The contention that the obligation is on the child himself is supported by <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 5:15-16, which states that an adult who has eaten only a small meal can fulfill his obligation to recite the grace by answering ""Amen"" to the blessings recited by a child who has reached the age of education.

This perspective is not accepted by Ashkenazic authorities.

There are Sages who maintain that tzitzit is an obligation that depends on the garment - i.e., the mitzvah is completed by placing tzitzit on every garment which requires them. The other opinion states that tzitzit are an obligation incumbent on a person, that a person is required to attach tzitzit to his garments. The Rambam rephrases the latter opinion as follows:

Only when a person desires to wear a garment that requires tzitzit is he obligated to fulfill the mitzvah.
This conception represents a change of position for the Rambam. Rav Yitzchak Alfasi, whose decisions the Rambam frequently followed, maintains that each person is obligated to wear tzitzit, apparently indicating that tzitzit, like tefillin, are an obligation which a person is required to fulfill.
The Rambam apparently held this view himself at one time. Therefore, in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, at the conclusion of the listing of the positive commandments, he lists tzitzit (together with tefillin) as one of the positive commandments whose observance we must pursue. Here, his choice of phraseology indicates that, although the mitzvah is incumbent on the person, it does relate to the garment. Only when a person wears a garment which requires tzitzit is he obligated to fulfill the mitzvah.

Accordingly, the people took to wearing the smaller <i>tallit katan</i>, which could be accommodated to other styles of dress more easily.
There is no explicit mention of a <i>tallit katan</i> in the Talmud, although a story related in <i>Menachot</i> 44a appears to indicate that such garments were worn in that era as well.

The <i>Pri Chadash</i>, however, differentiates between the liability of the worshiper (for which a sprinkling that spatters is not required) and the prohibition of the worship of the deity (for which it is).
</i>, because throwing a staff is not considered equivalent to sprinkling blood. The staff remains as it was<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> a single whole entity
</i>, while the blood spatters [in different directions]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since the reason that these services are considered significant even though the deity is not normally worshiped in this manner is that these services were performed in the Temple, the analogy must be complete. Thus, the entity poured or thrown before the deity must spatter, as blood spatters when sprinkled on the altar (<i>Avodah Zarah</i>, ibid.).

A sacrifice is only brought when one performs a deed in violation of the Torah's command (<i>Hilchot Shegagot</i> 1:2).

Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.5,"Anyone who serves a false god through its accepted mode of service - even if he does so in a derisive manner<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., both the act he performs and his intent in performing it is to abuse the false deity
</i> - is liable<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for a sacrifice, as will be explained. This is an extension of the principle stated in Halachah 2.
</i>. What is implied? When a person defecates before Pe'or to repudiate it, or throws a stone at Marculis to repudiate it - since this is the manner of serving them - the person is liable and must bring a sacrifice [to atone for] his inadvertent transgression<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Although he consciously performed an act which is considered to be worship of these gods, since his intent was not to serve them, he is not considered to be one who willfully serves idols. Hence, he is not punished by the court for his deed, nor is he obligated for <i>karet</i> by God. Since he, nevertheless, did perform an act of worship to these gods, he must bring a sacrifice for atonement.
The above represents the <i>Kessef Mishneh's</i> interpretation of this halachah. Many other authorities (see <i>Tosafot, Sanhedrin</i> 64a) disagree, and maintain that even in such circumstances, one could be held liable for capital punishment. For example, two witnesses who knew the law were present and warned the person against repudiating the idol in this fashion. He ignored their warning and performed the derisive act of worship. Although his intent was not to serve the deity, since he performed an act of worship despite the warning he was given, he is liable for execution.
Rav Kapach brings support for the <i>Kessef Mishneh's</i> view from the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 7:6. There, the Rambam discusses a similar situation and states that a person who performs such service ""is liable for a sin offering."" In the original texts of that commentary, the Rambam stated that the person ""is liable."" The addition of the words ""for a sin offering"" appear to indicate that he is liable only for an offering, but not for punishment by the court. Note also <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 5:4, where the Rambam states that a person who unknowingly worships a false god is not liable for his deeds.

Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.6,"[The following rules apply when] a person serves a false deity out of love - i.e., he desires an image because its service is very attractive<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The commentaries note that the Rambam interprets ""out of love"" differently from ""out of fear."" ""Out of love"" refers to a love for the image and its service, while ""out of fear"" means fear of what the deity can do to the person.
Rav Kapach explains the Rambam's position, justifying the need for such a difference in interpretation. Most idolaters do not worship their images out of a genuine conviction that they are the true god, but rather for the benefit they feel this service will bring them. Therefore, were a person to serve an idol with this intent in mind, the Rambam would hold him liable. In contrast, were he to serve out of fear, he is not considered to be acting on his own volition, and hence is not held responsible.
</i> - or when one serves it out of his fear of it - i.e., he fears that it will harm him - as the [idol] worshipers fear [their deities as sources of] benefit and harm:<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Chapter 1, Halachot 1-2.
</i> If he accepts it as a god<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and serves it as an act of worship

</i> or through one of the four services [mentioned above]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in Halachah 3,
</i>, he is not held liable<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> since he did not accept the deity as a god.
Although the Rambam's opinion is questioned by many other authorities, it is based on an established tradition of Talmudic interpretation. This halachah is based on <i>Sanhedrin</i> 61b. That passage is also quoted in <i>Shabbat</i> 72b. Rabbenu Chanan'el, one of the foremost commentators in the generations between the Geonim and the Rambam, interprets the latter passage using the same concepts _ and almost the same phraseology _ as employed by the Rambam here.
The Ra'avad and others challenge the Rambam's interpretation and explain that ""out of love"" and ""out of fear"" mean: motivated by the love or fear of the person who tries to influence one to worship the false deity. The Rambam cannot accept this interpretation, because in <i>Hilchot Yesodei Torah</i> 5:4, he states that a person who is forced to serve false gods is not held liable for his deeds (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).
The fact that a person is not held liable for such service does not at all minimize the seriousness of the prohibition involved. In no way is one allowed to serve false gods for such reasons. Even with regard to the Ra'avad's interpretation ""out of fear"" - i.e., out of fear of a person - the Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 150:3) prohibits performing any act that might be interpreted as idol worship - e.g., bowing to a ruler who is wearing an image.
</i>.<br>One who embraces a false deity, kisses it, sweeps before it, mops before it, washes it, anoints it, dresses it, places shoes upon it, or performs any similar act of deference violates a negative commandment, as [implied by Exodus 20:5]: ""Do not serve them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This commandment is described in Halachot 2 and 3.
</i>."" Such acts are also ""service."" The offender is, nevertheless, not<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that punishment is not given because this prohibition is a לאו שבכללות - i.e., it includes many different forbidden acts. Lashes are not given for the violation of such a prohibition, as stated in <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 18:2-3.
To explain: The prohibition, ""Do not serve them,"" is twofold in nature. It prohibits the worship of a false deity through its accepted modes of service, as stated in Halachah 2. This is a sin punishable by death. The same prohibition also forbids these expressions of affection or reverence. These deeds are not, however, punishable by death because they are not acts of worship.
Since violation of this prohibition incurs a penalty of execution, it is not associated with the punishment of lashes. Since, in essence, this prohibition is not associated with lashes, even the many transgressions of a lesser nature which are also included within this prohibition are also not punishable in this manner (Rav Kapach).
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> executed, as is one who worships a false deity, nor is he
</i> liable for lashes, because [these services] are not [mentioned] explicitly [by the Torah].<br>If one of the above services<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> kissing, and the like
</i> was the accepted mode of worship [of a particular deity] and a person performed this service as an act of worship<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and not merely as an expression of emotion. The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> questions the addition of the words ""as an act of worship,"" noting that in Halachah 5, the Rambam holds one liable for performing the service with which Pe'or or Marculis was worshiped, even though one's intent was to repudiate the idols. Thus, it appears that once a person performs a service which is the accepted mode of worship, his intent is no longer significant.
The <i>Pri Chadash</i> resolves this difficulty, explaining that the extent of liability is different. In the previous halachah, the offender was liable for a sin offering alone, while here,
</i>, he is liable [for execution]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as stated in Halachah 2.

Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.7,"If a splinter becomes stuck in a person's foot before an idol, he should not bend down to remove it, because it appears that he is bowing down to the idol<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">) is forbidden even in a person's most private chambers.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 12a states that if the person turns his back or side to the idol, his bowing would not be considered to be an act of deference, and no prohibition is involved.

He resolves that difficulty, explaining that in Halachah 5, the person intended to throw the stone at the idol. Since that act constitutes worship of this deity, he is held liable. In contrast, in our halachah the person did not bow down to the idol at all. The only reason the bowing is prohibited is that a mistaken impression might be created.

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that Rav Yitzchak Alfasi also omits this law, and explains that it was not contained in their text of the Talmud. (This is somewhat unlikely, since it is found in Rabbenu Chanan'el's text of <i>Avodah Zarah</i>.)

The commentaries have noted a slight difficulty in the Talmud's (and thus, the Rambam's) phraseology. The opening clause describes the statues as merely ""located before false deities,"" while from the latter clause it appears that the statue itself is the false deity.

Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.9,"A person who has a false god made for himself - even though he, himself, did not actually fashion it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., he commissioned another person to make the idol for him.

He explains that since the craftsman fashions the idol on behalf of the person who commissioned him, he is considered to be the latter's agent. Therefore, the one who commissioned him is held responsible for his deed.
The commentaries question this explanation, noting that - with the exception of a few specific instances - the Torah never holds a person who commissions another individual to commit a sin liable, since the person who actually committed the sin is responsible for his actions. Also, the Rambam's phraseology here implies that one is held liable regardless whether the craftsman is a Jew or gentile, and a gentile is never given the halachic status of an agent.
The following are among the resolutions offered to this difficulty:<br>
a) A hired worker's actions - whether positive or negative - are always attributed to his employer (<i>Machaneh Efrayim, Hilchot Shutafim</i> 8).<br>
b) The verse prohibiting this act reveals that this is one of the few exceptions to the general rule mentioned above, and in this case, the person who commissioned the agent is held liable (<i>Darchei HaMelech</i>).<br>
c) Commenting on <i>Hilchot Sechirut</i> 13:2, the <i>Mishneh LaMelech</i> explains that if it is possible to violate a particular prohibition by committing a deed, one is punished by lashes even when one violates it without committing a deed. The same concept can be applied here (<i>S'deh Chemed</i>).<br>
d) The deed for which one is punished is not the command to make the idol, but rather its purchase or acquisition (<i>Merchevat HaMishneh</i>, Alfandari).

Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.10,"It is prohibited to make images for decorative purposes, even though they do not represent false deities<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 4) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 39) consider this to be one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.

This refers even to images of gold and silver which are intended only for decorative purposes, lest others err and view them as deities<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's statement sheds light on an interesting Rabbinic debate. The Sages of the Talmud often established ""fences around the Torah"" - i.e., safeguards to prevent the violation of Torah law. (See <i>Avot</i> 1:1.) There is a question whether the Torah itself instituted prohibitions for such a purpose - i.e., are there mitzvot that are instituted without a self-contained goal of their own, but merely to prevent the violation of other prohibitions? (See <i>Lekach Tov</i> 8.)
From the Rambam's statements here (see also <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> 7:8), it appears that he accepts such a premise. It appears that there is nothing intrinsically wrong in making statues per se. Nevertheless, since if such statues are made, the possibility exists that they may be worshiped, the Torah forbids us to make them.
</i>.<br>It is forbidden to make decorative images of the human form alone<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As explained in the following halachah, this prohibition also applies to the sun, the moon, and other celestial beings. It is permitted to make an image of all creations of our world aside from man.
<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 43b derives this from the above verse. The Hebrew words translated as ""Do not make with Me..."" can also be rendered, ""Do not make Me..."" - i.e., do not make images in the human form, the form in which God has revealed himself (<i>Siftei Cohen, Yoreh De'ah</i> 141:21).
</i>. Therefore, it is forbidden to make human images with wood, cement, or stone<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> or any other material. The Rambam mentioned these materials because they were commonly used in his time.

This [prohibition] applies when the image is protruding - for example, images and sculptures made in a hallway and the like<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 141) states that we are forbidden to make only a complete human statue. A bust of a head alone or a statue which is lacking any one of the body's limbs is not forbidden. Though the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (141:7) does not accept this view, it is shared by the Ramah.
</i>. A person who makes such an image is [liable for] lashes<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> but not by execution, since these statues were not worshiped as idols.
</i>.<br>In contrast, it is permitted to make human images that are engraved or painted - e.g., portraits, whether on wood or on stone - or that are part of a tapestry<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though the images on a tapestry protrude slightly, since they are not a fully formed statue, there is no prohibition involved in making them.

</i>.<br>Similarly, it is forbidden to make an image of the sun, the moon, the stars, the constellations<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Our understanding of the Rambam's statements here can be enhanced by referring to his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 3:3:
This does not mean a sphere which represents the sun or a hemisphere which represents the moon, but rather the images which the astrologers [i.e., those following Greek mythology] attribute to the stars,... e.g., Saturn is represented as an old dark man of venerable age, Venus is represented as a a beautiful maiden adorned with gold, and the sun is represented as a king with a diadem sitting in a chariot.<br>
[These are forbidden because] they are falsehoods and the nature of falsehood is that it will surely spread.
Rav Kapach supports this interpretation by quoting <i>BeMidbar Rabbah</i> 2:6, which describes the pennant of the tribe of Issachar as having a picture of the sun and the moon. Were these images forbidden, it would be unlikely that Moshe would have told the tribe to depict them. Even if the decree was instituted in the later generations, it is not probable that the Rabbis would forbid images that had previously been used for a Torah purpose.
The Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 141:3) quotes the Rambam's opinion. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 141:13 and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 141:8, however, note that the Rambam's statements which were quoted above (and the Ramah's statements) refer to a question whether one is allowed to keep images of the sun or moon that he finds. Here, the question is whether one is allowed to make such images oneself. From the discussion of the question in <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 43b, where the Sages question how Rabban Gamliel possessed forms of the moon, it would appear that there is a prohibition against making images of the sun and the moon themselves.
This interpretation, however, is also somewhat problematic, because the Rambam writes that there is no prohibition against making images of animals, and some of the constellations of the Zodiac are represented and referred to as animals. For example, one of the Zodiac constellations is a fish and <i>Gittin</i> 36a describes Rav as making a drawing of a fish. Another is a lion, which is one of the most popular images found in Jewish art.
</i>, or the angels<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As the Rambam writes in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 2:3-5, the angels have no body or form. Hence, here, he is obviously referring to a form which a man has conceived of as appropriate for a particular angel. Alternatively, it could refer to the metaphoric imagery used by the prophets.
</i>, as [implied by Exodus, ibid.]: ""Do not make with Me [gods of silver...]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam (quoting <i>Avodah Zarah</i>, ibid.) mentions the above Biblical proof-text in connection with this prohibition. It would appear, however, from the fact that making such images is not punishable by lashes, that the prohibition is only Rabbinic in nature. The reference to the verse must be understood as an <i>asmachta</i> (use of the Biblical verse as a support for a Rabbinic decree).
</i>"" - i.e., do not make images of<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This refers to the celestial beings and the angels. (See Chapter 1, Halachah 1, and <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 2:3.)

</i> My servants, those who serve before Me on high. This [prohibition]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> is more severe than the prohibition against making human images, and

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> According to the Rambam's statements in his Commentary on the Mishnah, the difference between the prohibition against making these images and those of humans can be explained as follows: The prohibition against making human statues is Biblical in origin and is defined by the Torah itself. In contrast, the prohibition of making images of the celestial beings was a safeguard instituted by the Rabbis against Greek and Roman culture. It, therefore, applies to all images, whether pictures or statues, because both could influence people to stray from the Torah's ways.
According to the simple interpretation of the terms ""sun"" and ""moon,"" the difference can be explained as follows: The sun and the moon, as we perceive them, appear against the background of the sky. Therefore, for a representation of them to be forbidden, it also need not protrude (<i>Tosafot, 14Avodah Zarah</i>, ibid.).
</i>.<br>The images of animals and other living beings - with the exception of men - and similarly, the images of trees, grasses, and the like may be fashioned. This<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> leniency
</i> applies even to images which protrude<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> From these two halachot, particularly according to the Rambam's understanding as reflected in his Commentary on the Mishnah, we see that there is no conflict between Torah law and aesthetics. There are only two restrictions: realistic human statues (and according to some authorities, these must be complete, full-bodied statues) and depictions of pagan gods. Even according to the other opinions which forbid depictions of the sun, the moon, and the like, there is no prohibition against abstract portrayals of these entities. No other restrictions apply at all.
There is definitely a divergence between the approach to life that spawned much of the art forms of Western culture and a Torah lifestyle. Perhaps for that reason, many religious Jews have traditionally shunned participation in and patronage of the arts. In the present generation, however, a number of our Torah leaders have urged religious artists to dedicate themselves to expressing Torah ideas and values in a variety of art forms, explaining that:<br>
a) Through these media, it is possible to reach many Jews who might never enter a synagogue or Torah center;<br>
b) Everything in the world was created to be used by the Jews for a Torah purpose (Rashi, Genesis 1:1 . This also applies to art. Using these art forms for Torah purposes expresses the true intent for their creation and endows them with a depth of meaning and inspiration - and in its deepest sense, a new wellspring of creativity.
According to Kabbalah, God's presence is more manifest in the <i>sefirah</i> of <i>Tiferet</i> (""Beauty"") than in any other <i>sefirah</i>. Thus, the challenge confronting a Torah artist today is to use beauty as a medium to express Godly truth.

The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 150:5 notes that many communities are not stringent in the observance of this law and quotes sources which explain that since buildings owned by gentiles are often taller than the synagogue, the synagogue is not likely to be the tallest building in the city in any case. Therefore, other Jewish houses may also be built higher than the synagogue. His own opinion, however, is not to seek leniency in this regard.

<i>Tosafot</i> disagrees, maintaining that the condition has no effect while the synagogue is standing and applies only after it has been destroyed. Thus, were a synagogue to be built with such a condition, as were the synagogues in Babylonia in Talmudic times, mundane activities could be carried on within its premises after it was destroyed.

In his Commentary to the Mishnah, the Rambam writes that one is permitted to pull the grass out and leave it in its place. The published text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> (which we have quoted) appears to imply that one should pull them out (i.e., it is imperative to do so). However, the version of the halachah found in authoritative manuscripts is closer to the understanding in the Commentary to the Mishnah.

Perhaps here the Rambam is speaking about a question that arose after the fact, once the Torah scroll has already been sold, while in <i>Hilchot Sefer Torah</i>, he is describing an a priori condition. Alternatively, he may be referring to circumstances where the new Torah scroll has already been written and all that is necessary is to pay for it.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.15,"Similar [principles apply] if a congregation collected money to build a house of study or a synagogue or to purchase an ark, a mantle or a case [for a Torah scroll], or a Torah scroll, and desired to change [the purpose for which] all the [funds] had been [originally] collected<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Just as it is forbidden to sell sacred articles in order to purchase articles of lesser sanctity...

If the inhabitants of a city collected money for the construction of a synagogue and a matter involving a mitzvah arises, they may use the money for it. If they already bought stones and beams, they should not sell them for the sake of another mitzvah, except for the redemption of captives.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 153:6) states that a synagogue - and even a Torah scroll - may be sold for the purpose of supporting Torah studies or for other needs associated with mitzvot. Nevertheless, this measure should only be taken when there is no other way to cover these expenses (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 153:24). See also <i>Siftei Cohen</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 252:1) which explains that one is only allowed to sell a synagogue for such purposes if the buyer will continue to have it used as a synagogue.
</i> except from a matter of lesser sanctity to one of greater sanctity<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rav Moshe Cohen questions the Rambam's decision, asking why it is forbidden to make a change of this nature. Even bricks intended for use in constructing a synagogue can be used for other purposes as long as they have not been actually built into the synagogue (See <i>Megillah</i> 26b).
The <i>Turei Zahav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 153:2) explains that money collected for the purchase of religious articles does not possess the sanctity of those articles. However, since the donors intended that the money be used to purchase religious articles, its use is constrained by the terms of an implicit vow that it be used for this purpose. Despite this limitation, the congregation may use these funds for another purpose associated with a mitzvah and substitute other funds to accomplish the purpose for which these funds were originally collected. (Note the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 153:5, who does not accept the latter conclusion.)
The <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> (153) supports the <i>Turei Zahav's</i> position based on <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 1:20, which states that a sacred utensil made with the intent that it be used in the Temple is not considered as ""sacred"" until it has actually been used for its intended purpose.

Our Sages placed certain restrictions on the sale of the components of a synagogue. In <i>Hilchot Matnot Ani'im</i> 8:6, the Rambam writes:
If someone donates a light or a candle to a synagogue, it is forbidden to exchange it [for something else]. If [the sale] concerns a matter which is a mitzvah, it may be exchanged.... If the name of the donor has been forgotten, it is permitted to exchange [the object] even for a mundane matter.
In <i>Hilchot Sefer Torah</i> 10:4, the Rambam states that the platform ""has no sanctity at all."" However, this statement should be interpreted to mean that the platform is not considered a ""sacred article"" like the others mentioned in that halachah.

According to this understanding, a synagogue in a small village where large trade fairs are held is bound by the same laws as the synagogues of a large city. By the same token, a synagogue used by a private group of people in a large city may be comparable to a village synagogue. An example of such a case, cited by the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i>, is the custom once common that craftsmen of different professions would build synagogues for themselves.

Our Sages' use of that term merely implies that the governing communal body should not be a small group. Since the number seven is often used in the Bible, our sages employed it in this context.
In the same responsum, the Rambam defines the expression 18יבוט ריעה to mean ""sages, men of Torah and good deeds, [people of whom it can be said] 'pleasant are the words spoken by those who fulfill them.'
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The translation of the Hebrew, בית המים, is based on Rashi's commentary to <i>Megillah</i> 27b. He also offers an alternate translation, ""a latrine."" The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> favors the translation ""laundry"" since the prohibition against using the synagogue as a latrine is self-evident. Nevertheless, in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 153:9), Rav Yosef Karo mentions a latrine, but not a laundry.
The sanctity of the synagogue is transferred to the money received from its sale and the building itself is no longer considered as ""holy."" Nonetheless, using the premises for such purposes is considered degrading.
As support for the prohibition against using premises that had previously served as a synagogue for such purposes, the <i>Or Sameach</i> cites II Chronicles 8:11: ""I will not have a woman dwelling in the house of David... for the [places] where the ark of God has come are holy."" Although the ark had already been placed in the Temple, it was not becoming to the ark for Pharaoh's daughter to be allowed to live in a place where it had been kept.

When it is sold in this manner, it can be ""used even as a tavern.""
The Meiri explains the rationale for this decision as follows: Even if an explicit statement was not made to the effect that the synagogue could be used for an unbecoming purpose, it is understood that the village's inhabitants consecrated the synagogue with the understanding that it be subject to the decisions of the community's officials. Therefore, they have the right to sell the synagogue for whatever purposes they wish.
The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's decision and maintains that the license granted by <i>Megillah</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) only applies to the money received from the sale, while the building that was used as a synagogue can never be used for a purpose which is unbecoming. Though the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) quotes the Rambam's view, the <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> suggests following the Ra'avad's decision, quoting the law (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 21:2), which forbids using a <i>tallit</i> for an unbecoming purpose even after its <i>tzitzit</i> have been removed.
Rav Moshe Feinstein (Responsa, <i>Orach Chayim</i>, Vol. II, 45) mentions this halachah in regard to the sale of synagogues in neighborhoods where Jews no longer live. Unfortunately, the natural clients for the purchase of an abandoned synagogue are churches. Rav Moshe states that selling a synagogue for use as a church is definitely forbidden. Using a synagogue for such purposes is more demeaning than using it for the purposes mentioned by the Talmud. He maintains that even according to the Rambam, selling a synagogue for this purpose could not be permitted.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.18,"Similarly, if the seven officials of the community made a condition in the presence of the entire community that [after the community accomplished the purpose for which they sold the synagogue], the remainder of the funds could be used for mundane purposes, they may be used for such purposes<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 153:7) accepts the opinion of Rashi, the Ra'avad, and Rabbenu Asher, who differ with the Rambam and maintain that the entire proceeds from the sale of a synagogue can be used for mundane purposes if the sale was carried out in the above manner.
In his <i>Kessef Mishnah</i>, Rav Yosef Karo explains the difference between these positions as follows. These authorities do not accept the Rambam's interpretation of <i>Megillah</i> 26a-b mentioned in the previous Halachah, and maintain that a certain measure of sanctity always remains in the synagogue. The Rambam maintains that the sanctity is transferred to the money received for the synagogue. Therefore, the condition made by the city officials can never effect the entire sum of money. Rather, the major portion must always be used for a sacred object.
[Interestingly, in his <i>Kessef Mishnah</i>, Rav Yosef Karo points out the advantages of the Rambam's position. However, in his<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, he accepts the decisions of the other authorities.]

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 11.20,"Just as it is permitted to sell a synagogue<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in a village, and afterwards, use the premises for mundane purposes

The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 153:26 states that the gift must be made by the community officials in the presence of the inhabitants of the village. However, the <i>Pri Megadim</i> does not require these conditions. Since the Rambam equates giving the synagogue as a present to a sale, it is not likely that he would make such limitations.
<i>Megillah</i> 26b states, ""a gift is like a sale,"" because
</i>. If the community had not received any benefit from giving it as a gift, it would not have given it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This principle is also reflected in questions of business law, e.g., <i>Hilchot Gezeilah</i> 9:9.
The Ritbah states that even when the community has not yet received any benefit from a person, it may give him a synagogue in the expectation of receiving such benefit.
</i>. However, it cannot be rented or given as security<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In the Talmudic era, when property was given as security, the person who received the property would have the right to use it throughout the term of the loan. [This practice raises questions in regard to the prohibition against taking interest. See <i>Hilchot Malveh U'Loveh</i>, Chapters 6 and 7.]
When a synagogue is sold, its sanctity is transferred to the money received for it and does not remain within the building itself. However, if a synagogue was rented or given as security, there is nothing to which the sanctity is transferred. Hence, it remains within the building and the person who rents it or receives it as security is forbidden to use it for his own purposes.
Note the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 153:11) who states that the prohibition only applies when the person who receives the synagogue wants to use it for mundane purposes. If he continues to use it as a synagogue there is no difficulty.
Similarly, when a synagogue is being torn down so that it can be rebuilt, - Note Halachah 12 which states that the new synagogue must be built before the old one is torn down.
</i>.<br>Similarly, when a synagogue is being torn down so that it can be rebuilt, it is permitted to sell the bricks, timber, and soil, exchange them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> even if the articles given in return are received later (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 153:68)

Though the community officials have the power to nullify the sanctity of a synagogue as mentioned in Halachot 17 and 18, that provision only applies when they do so completely. In this instance, since the building materials have to be returned, their sanctity is not nullified. Hence, no one has the right to lend them to anyone for mundane use.

and ma'amadot, - The mention of <i>ma'amadot</i> in this context in <i>Megillah</i> 26a (the source for this halachah), and here, in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, has raised questions. In <i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i> 6:1-2, the Rambam describes the <i>ma'amadot</i> as follows:
The early prophets ordained that honest people who fear sin should be chosen to stand over the sacrifices. They are called <i>anshei ma'amad</i>. They were divided into 24 different watches....<br>
Each week, the <i>anshei ma'amad</i> of that watch would gather together. Those who lived in Jerusalem or close to it would come to the Temple.... Those who lived far away... would gather together in the synagogues of their locale.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.1,"Anyone who intentionally eats an olive's size<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Whenever the Torah uses the verb אכל (eat) in the context of a mitzvah or a prohibition, it refers to the consumption of at least a minimum amount, established by <i>Eruvin</i> 4b as the size of an olive.
It must be emphasized that the measure of a כזית (an olive's size) cannot be determined by measuring an average olive today. Rather, it is dependent on the measure established by the Sages and this is the subject of debate by the Rabbinic authorities. The <i>Pri Chadash</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 486) explains that the Rambam considers an olive as one third the size of an egg (כביצה, a more familiar Talmudic measure). In terms of modern measurements, this olive size would be between 16.6 and 24 grams, according to various Halachic opinions.
<i>Tosefot</i> (<i>Chullin</i> 103a) differs, and defines a כזית(the size of an olive) as one half the size of an egg (between 25.6 and 36 grams according to the various opinions). With regard to the practical application of the law (<i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i>), the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 486) advises that in all questions of Torah law, <i>Tosefot's</i> opinion should be followed.

In his commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 9:6, the Rambam emphasizes that premature death does not represent the totality of the retribution these individuals will receive. In addition, ""their souls will be cut off.""
In <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 8:1, the Rambam elaborates on the latter dimension:

The good that is hidden for the righteous is the life of the world to come... The retribution of the wicked is that they will not merit this life. Rather, they will be cut off and die.

Chizkiyah states: What is the source from which we learn that it is forbidden to derive benefit from chametz? [Exodus 13:3] states: ""Do not eat (לא יאכל) chametz""; i.e., it is not permitted [to be used to derive benefit that leads to] eating.
His decision is based on the fact that the Torah uses the expression לא יאכל. Had the Torah not written יאכל לא, we may presume that a prohibition against eating would be implied, but not a prohibition against deriving benefit.
This contradicts the opinion of R. Abahu who states: Wherever the Torah states לא תאכל, לא יאכלor לא תאכלו, a prohibition against eating and deriving benefit is implied.

The Rambam's statements in this Halachah quote the opinion of Chizkiyah. However, in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 8:15, he quotes the opinion of R. Abahu as accepted halachah.
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> resolves the contradiction, explaining that in the halachah at hand, there is no difference in law between Chizkiyah and R. Abahu. Therefore, although the Rambam generally accepts R. Abahu's opinion, in this instance he quotes Chizkiyah's statements because the manner in which the latter derives the concept is more explicit.

</i> for [transgressing the prohibitions] not to have [chametz] seen [in his possession] and not to have [chametz] found [in his possession] unless he purchased chametz on Pesach<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Tzafnat Paneach</i> emphasizes that this law applies only to chametz purchased from a gentile. However, once chametz belonging to a Jew becomes prohibited, that Jew no longer has the authority to sell it. Thus, the purchaser will never really become the legal owner of the chametz (See Rashi, <i>Sukkah</i> 35a; <i>Tosefot, Chullin</i> 4b).
The <i>Or Sameach</i> questions how a person can become liable even for chametz purchased from a gentile, but resolves the issue based on the commentary of Rabbenu Nissim (<i>Avodah Zarah</i>, Chapter 3).
</i> or [caused flour] to become leavened, and thus committed a deed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Mishneh LaMelech</i> raises a significant question: A person is not liable for lashes for violating any prohibition which he can correct by fulfilling a positive commandment (לעשה לאו הניתק): For example, if a person violates the prohibition against taking both a mother bird and her eggs, he can free himself from the punishment of lashes by sending away the mother bird.
<i>Tosefot</i> (<i>Pesachim</i> 29b) states that the prohibition against chametz being seen in one's property falls into the above category, because one can correct the violation of this prohibition by fulfilling the positive commandment to destroy chametz. Thus, it appears that a person can never be held liable for lashes for this transgression.
Among the resolutions offered to this difficulty is that of Rav Chayim Soloveitchik, who explains that <i>Tosefot's</i> statements apply only according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah, who maintains that chametz must be destroyed by burning. However, according to the Sages (whose opinion is accepted by the Rambam, Halachah 3:11), who maintain that chametz can be destroyed by any means, not necessarily burning, the prohibition against possessing chametz is not considered a לאו הניתק לעשה.
What is the essential difference between these opinions: Rabbi Yehudah maintains that the fundamental aspect of the mitzvah to destroy chametz revolves upon the article itself (חפצה); it is a mitzvah to destroy chametz. In contrast, the Sages maintain that the mitzvah centers on the person (גברה); he is commanded to remove all chametz from his possession.
According to Rabbi Yehudah, since the commandment revolves around the chametz itself, its destruction directly ""corrects"" the sin of its possession. In contrast, according to the Sages, the positive commandment of ridding one's house of chametz is merely a reinforcement of the prohibition against its possession, and the fulfillment of the positive commandment does not have the power to ""correct"" the violation of the prohibition.
</i>.<br>However, if he possessed chametz before Pesach, and when Pesach came he did not destroy it and left it in his possession, e<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sh'vuot</i> 21b states: ""The transgression of any prohibition which does not involve a deed is not punishable by lashing.""
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> However, should he remove it from his possession (by giving it to another person or declaring it ownerless), he is not liable even if he does not actually destroy the object.

A person liable for lashing according to Torah law receives a uniform number of 39 lashes unless he is physically incapable of bearing that number. In contrast, the number of lashes given to a person liable for ""stripes for being rebellious"" is left to the discretion of the court.
<i>Chullin</i> 14b states that this punishment is also inflicted upon those who violate a Torah prohibition that is not punishable by lashing.

The <i>Tzafnat Paneach</i> explains that the debate between Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Shimon (who maintains that the Torah does not forbid benefiting from chametz after Pesach) revolves around an abstract concept. Rabbi Yehudah maintains that once Pesach comes, chametz itself becomes forbidden and, therefore, can never become permitted again. In contrast, Rabbi Shimon maintains that the prohibition does not affect the essence of the chametz itself.

A thief stole chametz from a person before Pesach and returned it to him after the holiday. Even though the person had no opportunity to destroy it before Pesach, it is forbidden.
In that responsum, the <i>Nodah BiYhudah</i> also raises the following question: A person died on the fourteenth of Nisan without nullifying or selling his chametz. Are his heirs forbidden to benefit from that chametz or not? He maintains that although the Rambam would probably prohibit benefiting from this chametz, there are rationales on the basis of which its use may be permitted. [Other authorities (note <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Kuntres Acharon</i> 435) do not accept this conclusion.]

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.5,"If, on Pesach<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rabbenu Asher and the <i>Sefer Mitzvot Gadol</i> maintain that this principle does not apply until the holiday itself actually begins. Thus, even if chametz became mixed with other substances on the fourteenth of Nisan, after the time chametz is forbidden, the mixture is bound by the laws regarding the nullification of forbidden objects (ביטול איסורים) that apply throughout the entire year.
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> maintains that a simple interpretation of the Rambam's statements leads to the conclusion that he accepts this opinion. Though others, among them the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, do not accept this view, it is accepted as Halachah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 447:2).

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> When the prohibited substance is of a different kind from the permitted (e.g., forbidden fats mixed with grain), the prohibition is ordinarily nullified if the taste of the forbidden article is not discernible, or the quantity of the permitted substance is at least 60 times as great as the forbidden article (ibid. 15:1, 6).
</i>, [the entire mixture] is forbidden<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The above principles do not apply with regard to chametz on Pesach. Even the slightest mixture of chametz may not be eaten, nor may benefit be derived from it. In <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> (15:9), the Rambam explains that this stringency is instituted because chametz is a דבר שיש לו מתירין (a substance which later will become permitted).
A דבר שיש לו מתירין which becomes mixed together with a permitted substance of its own kind is never permitted to be used because of the following rationale: Since its use in its entirety will later become permitted, there is no need to grant a leniency allowing it to be eaten when forbidden.
Similarly, with regard to chametz on Pesach: There is no prohibition against using a mixture of chametz after Pesach. Hence, there is no need to grant permission to eat such a mixture on Pesach itself, even though the quantity of the permitted substance far surpasses that of the chametz.
Furthermore, there is a stricter dimension to chametz than to any other דבר שיש לו מתירין. Generally, a דבר שיש לו מתירין is permitted if it becomes mixed with a substance of another kind to the extent that its taste can no longer be discerned. However, this leniency is not granted regarding mixtures of chametz. Since Exodus 12:20 states: ""You must not eat any leaven,"" the severity of the prohibition obligates additional stringency.

Nevertheless, the latter point should not be misinterpreted. Should such a mixture be discovered on Pesach, we are obligated to destroy it (<i>Ramah, Orach Chayim</i> 447:1). Nevertheless, if either intentionally or unintentionally, the mixture was not destroyed on the holiday itself, it may be used afterwards.

Nevertheless, this decision is a matter of debate among the commentators. The Ramban (<i>Hasagot</i> to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>) does not accept the Rambam's view, and explains that a person who consumes an olive size of chametz within the specific time period (פרס כדי אכילת) described below should be liable for כרת as described in Halachah 1. See also Halachah 4:8 and commentary.
The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> supports the Ramban's view, noting that in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 15:3, the Rambam himself explains that any person who eats a mixture containing an olive size of a forbidden food within this time period is liable, just as if he had eaten the forbidden food itself.
Based on the explanation of the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 442), the <i>Drisha</i> and the <i>Pri Chadash</i> interpret the Rambam as referring to a mixture to which the chametz does not impart any flavor and is added only for consistency and color.
The <i>Tzafnat Paneach</i> offers a different interpretation, explaining that were chametz to be mixed with other foods, a person eating the mixture would be liable for כרת as the Ramban states. However, the Rambam is talking about an instance when flour was mixed with another substance and became leavened as part of the mixture, without ever becoming a distinct entity of its own. The Torah considers this as a different category of chametz and holds a person who eats it liable for a lesser punishment.

Just as the Torah requires a specific quantity, the size of an olive, as regards many of the mitzvot and prohibitions concerning eating, it also specifies a limited period in which this amount of food must be consumed: אבילת פרס כדי.
This measure is also a point of Rabbinic controversy. The Rambam defines it as the time it takes to eat three eggs (<i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 14:8). Rashi (<i>Pesachim</i> 44a) takes a more lenient view, defining it as the amount of time it takes to eat four eggs. As regards this matter as well, the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 612:4) advises that whenever a question of Torah law is involved, the more stringent opinion should be observed. However, in questions of Rabbinic law, the more lenient view can be relied on.
In converting this figure to modern measures of time, there is also a difference of opinion. The shortest opinion limits this period to two minutes. The most commonly accepted view is four minutes and there are opinions of seven and eight minutes as well.

<i>Likkutei Sichot</i> (Vol. 11) explains that the question is dependent on a difference of opinion between the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds. The Babylonian Talmud (<i>Kiddushin</i> 29a) derives the mitzvah from the verse (Genesis 21:4 , ""And Avraham circumcised his son, Isaac."" This indicates that the mitzvah is primarily the father's (although after the son reaches adulthood, he also becomes responsible). In contrast, the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Kiddushin</i> 1:7) quotes as a proof-text for the mitzvah (Leviticus 12:3 , ""On the eighth day, the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised."" The <i>Korban Eidah</i> explains that this implies the mitzvah is the son's. Since he is not able to perform it himself as a youth, however, his father is given the responsibility while the child is a minor.
<i>Likkutei Sichot</i> continues, explaining that the Rambam's position is obvious from his discussion of the blessings recited for the mitzvot in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i>, Chapter 11. In Halachah 11 of that chapter, the Rambam explains that if one performs a mitzvah on one's own behalf, one should use the form, ""who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us </i>, and a master, his slaves<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Here, the responsibility for the mitzvah is surely the master's. This circumcision is one of the stages in the process by which the slave attains the status of <i>eved C'na'ani</i>, an intermediate rung between a gentile and a Jew. He is obligated to fulfill all the negative commandments and all those positive commandments that are not associated with a specific time. (See <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 12:11.)
</i>. This applies both to those who are born in his home<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., a non-Jewish maidservant gave birth to a male child
</i> and to those purchased by him<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Genesis 17:27, which relates that Abraham circumcised both these categories of servants.
</i>. If the father or the master transgressed and did not circumcise them, he negated the fulfillment of a positive commandment<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 19:6):
If a person transgressed and did not circumcise his son or his servants born in his home... on the eighth day, he transgresses a very great and severe mitzvah, to which there is no comparison among the other mitzvot. He can never compensate for [the lack of fulfillment of] this mitzvah.<br>
His sin is much more severe than a person who did not build a sukkah on Sukkot, or one who did not eat matzah on Pesach.
</i>. He is not, however, punished by <i>karet</i>, for <i>karet</i> is incurred only by the uncircumcised person himself. T<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Kiddushin</i>, loc. cit., interprets Genesis 17:10, ""You must circumcise every male,"" as a charge to the Jewish court, making them responsible for circumcising every member of the people.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is obvious from the proof-text quoted above.
</i>he court is obligated to circumcise that son or slave at the proper time and should not leave an uncircumcised male among the Jewish people or their slaves."
Circumcision 1.2,"We may not circumcise a person's son without his knowledge<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See <i>Hilchot Chovel UMazik</i> 7:13-14, where the Rambam describes the prohibition against ""stealing"" the performance of a mitzvah from a colleague, and the fine of ten gold pieces for doing so. The Ramah (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 382:1) explicitly associates this concept with circumcising a person's son without his knowledge.
</i>, unless he has transgressed and did not circumcise him<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's phraseology has raised questions among the halachic authorities. Is his intent that once the father has allowed the eighth day to pass, the obligation falls on the court, or is his intent that only after the father makes it obvious that he does not want to circumcise his son that they become responsible? Similarly, the question has been raised what should be done if the father is unaware that a son has been born to him, or is prevented from carrying out the circumcision by factors beyond his control. Should the circumcision be carried out on the eighth day, or should the family wait until the father returns? See <i>Avnei Nezer</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i>, Responsum 318) and Rav Kapach's commentary.
</i>. [In such an instance,] the court must circumcise<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the obligation mentioned in the previous halachah falls upon them
</i> [the child] against [the father's] will<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Even if he protests, the mitzvah should be performed.
</i>.<br>If the matter does not become known to the court and they do not circumcise him, when [the child] reaches <i>bar mitzvah</i>, he is obligated to circumcise himself. W<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Some of the manuscript editions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> state, ""It is as if he negates a commandment."" The mitzvah of circumcision is not negated until the person dies without fulfilling it. Unlike tefillin or tzitzit, where each day a person performs a different mitzvah, there is only one mitzvah of circumcision (Rav Kapach).
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Tzafenat Paneach</i> explains that there are three aspects to the mitzvah of circumcision:
a) to remove the foreskin;<br>
b) to be circumcised;<br>
c) not to be uncircumcised. (See Chapter 2, Halachah 1.)&lt; /p&gt;
The first aspect involves a single deed. The second and third dimensions, however, are ongoing qualities that a person continues to possess even after the deed of circumcision is completed. Thus, the <i>Or Zarua</i> quotes <i>Menachot</i> 43b, which relates that when King David entered the bathhouse, he was upset for he was ""naked,"" without mitzvot. When he remembered that he was circumcised, he relaxed, realizing that he was still involved with the performance of a mitzvah.
This indicates that, even years after his circumcision, he was considered to be fulfilling the mitzvah. In contrast, with regard to the mitzvot of tefillin and tzitzit, although he had just removed them, he was no longer considered to be involved in the performance of these mitzvot.
</i>ith each and every day that passes after he has reached <i>bar mitzvah</i>, he negates a positive commandment. He is not, however, liable for <i>karet</i> until he dies uncircumcised, h<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> but not if he was unaware of the mitzvah or was prevented from fulfilling it by forces beyond his control
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned above, there are two dimensions to the punishment of <i>karet</i>: premature death and the cutting off of the soul. According to the Rambam, a person who does not circumcise himself is liable only for the second aspect of this punishment, since until he dies, it is not known whether he will perform the mitzvah or not (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).
The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's statements, stating that each day he does not perform the mitzvah, he is liable for <i>karet</i> and is worthy of premature death. (Even according to the Ra'avad, were the person to circumcise himself, he would no longer be liable for <i>karet</i>).
</i>aving intentionally [failed to perform the mitzvah]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's phraseology raises the question whether a person is liable for <i>karet</i> if he initially failed to perform the mitzvah intentionally, and then was prevented from fulfilling it by forces beyond his control.

Circumcision 1.3,"A master is obligated to circumcise both a slave who was born as the property of a Jewish owner<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., the ""home-born slave"" mentioned in Genesis 17:12
</i> and a slave purchased from the gentiles<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Such servants are also mentioned in the above verse.
</i>. [There is, however, a difference between the two.] A home-born slave should be circumcised on the eighth day [of his life]. I<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since Genesis 17:13 repeats the commandment, ""Circumcise all home-born [slaves] and those purchased with your money,"" we can assume that there are slaves who are to be circumcised immediately (Rashi, loc. cit.).
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as is a Jewish child. The above verse states that ""all those born in your house"" - i.e., also slaves - should be circumcised on the eighth day (Rashi, <i>Shabbat</i> 135b).
</i>n contrast, a slave who is purchased should be circumcised on the day he was purchased. If he was purchased on the day he was born, he should be circumcised on that day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> provided, of course, that the surgery will not affect the infant's health. (Note the Guide to the Perplexed, Vol. III, Chapter 49, which explains that both physically and spiritually, a child is not prepared for circumcision until the eighth day.)
</i>."
Circumcision 1.4,"There are, however<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> certain exceptions to the rules mentioned in the previous halachah that are also mentioned in <i>Shabbat</i> 135b. There are some
</i>, slaves that are purchased who should be circumcised on the eighth day [of their lives]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as explained in this halachah
</i>, and<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> some
</i> home-born slaves who should be circumcised on the day they are born<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as explained in the following halachah.
</i>.<br>What is implied? Should one purchase a maidservant and purchase [the rights to] her fetus [separately]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is possible when the maidservant herself belonged to one master and the fetus to another (Rambam in his responsa).
</i>, when she gives birth, the baby should be circumcised on the eighth day. Although the fetus itself was purchased separately, since [the master] purchased his mother before the child was born, h<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> relates that, according to the Rambam, even if the master at first purchased only the rights to the fetus, and then purchased the mother, since she gave birth while in his domain, the slave is considered ""home-born,"" and is circumcised on the eighth day.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the child is considered ""home-born"" and
</i>e should be circumcised on his eighth day."
Circumcision 1.5,"If a person purchased a maidservant for her offspring<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his responsum cited above, the Rambam compares this to a person who buys a tree for its fruit - i.e., he is not the actual owner of the tree, but is entitled to all the fruit it produces. Similarly, in this instance, the master is not the owner of the maidservant; what he has purchased is the right to her offspring. Therefore, none of the offspring are considered ""home-born,"" and must be circumcised immediately.
</i>, or purchased a maidservant with the intent of not immersing her as a slave<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Through immersion in a <i>mikveh</i>, a female maidservant becomes a <i>shifchah C'na'anit</i> and attains the intermediate status mentioned in the Commentary on Halachah 1.
As the Rambam mentions in the following halachah, it is possible to purchase a gentile slave and maintain possession of him or her without changing his or her status in the above manner.
</i>, even though her offspring is born in his domain, the child should be circumcised on the day he was born<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The first instance mentioned does not require explanation. With regard to the second category, the Rambam elaborates:
</i>.<br>[This ruling was granted, because] this child is considered as if he alone has been purchased [by his master], and it is as if he purchased him this day. His mother is not included among the maidservants of the Jewish people, so that the child could be considered ""home-born."" I<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This shows that the stipulation that she need not be immersed (see the following halachah) is nullified and considered of no consequence. Therefore, she is considered to be part of the household, and
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In the responsum cited above, the Rambam explains that the concept of a ""home-born"" slave is derived from God's commandment to Abraham. All the members of Abraham's household had accepted his beliefs and way of life. In contrast, a slave who is unwilling to accept the mitzvot cannot be considered part of a Jewish household, and her children are not ""home-born.""
</i>f his mother immersed herself after she gave birth, the child should be circumcised on the eighth day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's decision and maintains that unless the mother immerses herself before giving birth, the child should be circumcised immediately. Rabbenu Nissim, in his notes to <i>Shabbat</i> 135b, supports the Rambam's decision, explaining that the Sages did not reach a final ruling on the matter, and hence the more stringent approach should be taken.
</i>."
Circumcision 1.6,"When a person purchases a slave from the gentiles and the slave does not consent<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note the difference of opinion in <i>Yevamot</i> 48b, whether this leniency is granted if the slave refuses outright to be circumcised.
</i> to be circumcised, we may be patient with him for twelve months<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> lest he change his mind and accept his status within the Jewish people.
</i>. It is forbidden to maintain him for any longer period while he remains uncircumcised, and one must sell him to gentiles<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> He must, however, agree to accept the seven universal laws mentioned below. Otherwise, he should be slain (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).
</i>.<br>If, at the outset, while the slave was still in the possession of his gentile master, he made a stipulation that he would not be circumcised<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rav Kapach maintains that the stipulation was made by the slave's master. Since the slave is considered to be chattel, his own say is of no concern.
</i>, it is permissible to maintain him although he is not circumcised, provided he accepts the seven universal laws commanded to the descendants of Noah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The prohibitions against idol worship, cursing God, murder, theft, adultery, eating flesh taken from a living animal, and the obligation to establish a court system. (See <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 9:1-2.)
</i> and becomes a resident alien<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 10:6, the Rambam writes that it is forbidden to allow gentiles who do not accept these seven laws to dwell in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. Therefore, a gentile who does is called a resident alien - i.e., a non-Jew who may dwell among us.
</i>.<br>If he refuses to accept these seven laws<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The slave must formally accept the performance of these mitzvot in the presence of a Rabbinic court.
</i>, he should be killed immediately<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam's decision depends on his statement (<i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 8:9) that we must do everything in our power to influence the gentiles to observe these seven laws.
The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's statement, explaining that in the present era, we may not kill any gentiles for refusing to observe these seven laws. The commentaries differ whether the Rambam would accept the Ra'avad's decision (and his statement here is, like many of the other laws he states, reflective of the Messianic era), or whether permission is granted to kill a slave for refusing to follow these laws in the present age as well.

A resident alien may be accepted only in the era when the laws of <i>yovel</i> a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Jubilee must be observed only when the entire Jewish people are dwelling in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.

Circumcision 1.7,"When a convert enters the congregation of Israel, he is obligated to undergo circumcision first<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 13:1-4 states:
With three acts, Israel entered into a covenant [with God]: circumcision, immersion [in the mikveh], and [the offering of] sacrifices.... Similarly, with regard to future generations, when a gentile wants to enter into the covenant, take refuge under the wings of the Divine Presence, and accept the yoke of the Torah, he must undergo circumcision, immersion, and the offering of a sacrifice.
The phrase ""accept the yoke of the Torah"" indicates that before performing these deeds, the prospective convert must resolve to fulfill the mitzvot.
</i>. If he had been circumcised while he was a gentile<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and not by a Jew for the purpose of conversion. Note <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 13:7 which relates that even if a gentile circumcises himself for the purpose of conversion, it is insufficient.
</i>, it is necessary to extract the blood of the covenant<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> a superficial cut is made on the shaft of the penis, and a small amount of blood extracted.
The expression ""blood of the covenant"" is derived from the interpretation of Exodus 24:8, ""This is the blood of the covenant which God established with you,"" in certain texts of <i>Nedarim</i> 31b and the <i>Mechilta's</i> interpretation of Zechariah 9:11, ""Because of the blood of your covenant, I have sent forth your prisoners from the pit.""
</i> on the day that he converts<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 268:2) states that one should wait until the wound of the circumcision is completely healed before immersing in the mikveh and completing the process of conversion.
</i>.<br>Similarly, a child who was born without a foreskin<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Our Sages mention this as a sign of a high spiritual level, citing Moses and Shem (Noah's son) as examples of children born without a foreskin.
</i> must have blood extracted for circumcision<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Were we to be sure the child did not have a foreskin, there would be no need for the extraction of blood. The blood is extracted lest the child have a thin foreskin that is not readily noticeable (<i>Shabbat</i> 135a). Note the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 263:4), which requires the extraction of blood and states that we must inspect such a child carefully - but gently - to see whether he possesses a thin foreskin or not. (Perhaps the expression ""thin foreskin"" refers to the membrane removed by <i>pri'ah</i>.)
It must be noted that there are <i>Rishonim</i> (see Rashi,<i>Shabbat</i> 134a) who maintain that the extraction of the ""blood of the covenant"" is not a by-product of a search for a thin membrane, but rather serves an independent purpose: The Jews' covenant with God is established through their blood.
</i> on the eighth day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note Chapter 3, Halachah 6, which states that a blessing is not recited for this activity.
The Ramah mentions several other instances when blood must be extracted: a child who was circumcised before the eighth day (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 262:1), circumcised at night ( loc. cit.), or circumcised by a gentile ( loc. cit., 264:1) should have blood extracted for the sake of fulfilling the mitzvah. (Note also the commentary on Chapter 2, Halachah 1.)
</i>. An androgynous, a child with both male and female sexual organs<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Androgynous</i> is a combination of the Greek words meaning ""man"" and ""woman."" (See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 2:24.) Note also <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 12:4, which states:
The status of a <i>tumtum</i> and an <i>androgynous</i> is doubtful. Therefore, the stringencies of both a man and a woman are applied to them, and they are obligated by all [the mitzvot]. If, however, they transgress, they are not [punished by] lashing.
Because of this unique status, an <i>androgynous</i>
</i>, must be circumcised on the eighth day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> lest he be obligated to undergo circumcision.
See <i>Tiferet Yisrael</i> (<i>Shabbat</i> 19:3), who writes:
There are those who say there is no such thing as an <i>androgynous</i>. Their statements are false.... I beheld such a phenomenon with my own eyes. Twelve years ago, I myself circumcised a child with this condition.
</i>. Similarly, a child born by Caesarian section<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Shabbat</i> 135a explains as follows: The commandment for circumcision on the eighth day (Leviticus 12:3  is stated directly after the verse that relates that a woman who gives birth becomes ritually impure. Since a woman does not contract ritual impurity when she gives birth by Caesarian section, one might think that the child need not be circumcised on the eighth day. Therefore, the Rambam clarified the matter. (See also Halachah 11.)
</i> and a child who has two foreskins<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This refers to a birth abnormality. Rashi (<i>Shabbat</i> 135b) mentions two interpretations: a person with a single penis that is covered by two foreskins; alternatively, a person with two penises.
</i> should both be circumcised on the eighth day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Nevertheless, as explained in Halachah 11, none of the individuals mentioned in this halachah are circumcised on the eighth day if it falls on the Sabbath.

Circumcision 1.8,"Circumcision is performed only during the day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This applies to all circumcisions - those of children, servants, and converts

Although according to the Rambam, the day extends until the appearance of the stars, circumcision should be carried out before sunset (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i> 266:9).
The proof-text quoted mentions the eighth day. Nevertheless, <i>Yevamot</i> 72b uses the rules of Biblical exegesis to demonstrate that

Thus, we see that the Rambam intends that the person to be circumcised fully regain his health, and then wait an additional seven days.
</i>.<br>When does the above apply? When he recovers from high fever<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Our translation is based on the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>.
</i> or from a similar illness<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., an illness that affects a person's entire body (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i> 262:2)
</i>. If, however, a person's eyes hurt, as soon as his eyes heal he may be circumcised immediately<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., on the same day of his recovery. Note the <i>Turei Zahav</i> 262:3, which explains that since the circumcision has been postponed, it may be further delayed and should not be carried out on Thursday or Friday, so that the child will not have pain on the Sabbath.
</i>. The same applies in all similar circumstances<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., sicknesses in which the person's entire body is not affected.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.1","The term ""the frond of the date palm"" employed by the Torah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Leviticus 23:40.
</i> refers to the branches of a date palm<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Tzafenat Paneach</i> questions whether or not the tree from which the lulav is taken must actually produce dates.
</i> as they sprout, before their leaves separate<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Thus, if the leaves spread out and were later bound together by human activity, it is not acceptable (Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 645:2).
</i> and spread out in various directions<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Periodically, the date palm sprouts forth new branches. Initially they are closed, and as time passes they spread out to a fanlike shape. The Torah requires that they be used for the lulav while they are still in their initial state.
This obligation is derived from the fact that the Torah spells the word כפת, without a ו, implying that the date branch should appear to be a single entity (<i>Sukkah</i> 32a).
There is a homiletic aspect to using the lulav while its leaves are closed. <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 30:12 emphasizes how the mitzvah of lulav and etrog expresses the unity and oneness which pervade the Jewish people. Not only is this unity expressed by the combination of the four species into a single mitzvah, it is reflected in each of the species themselves. Thus, the lulav is used while its leaves are together as one, before they separate into distinct entities.
</i>. Rather, they should appear as a scepter<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Here, too, our Sages have emphasized the homiletic lesson to be derived from this shape. Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur are days of judgement. The lulav can be considered as the Jews' scepter of victory, acknowledging that they have prevailed (<i>Medrash Tanchumah, Emor</i>).
</i>. This is called a lulav.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">

A Kosher Willow

The ""fruit of the beautiful tree"" mentioned in the Torah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Leviticus, ibid.
</i> is the etrog<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 35a explains that this term is used to refer to the etrog because of a unique quality possessed by this fruit. The taste of the tree itself resembles the taste of the fruit. Alternatively, the word הדר can be interpreted to mean ""which dwells,"" and thus refer to the etrog, which can grow on the tree for an entire year.
</i>.<br>The ""boughs of covered trees"" mentioned in the Torah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Leviticus, ibid.
</i> refer to the [species of] myrtle whose leaves surround its branch;<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> thus, covering the branch
</i> i.e., there will be three or more leaves in each ring<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> on the same level.
Our translation follows the interpretation of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, who requires that the three leaves be on the same level over the entire length of the myrtle. However, other opinions interpret the Rambam's words to mean that a myrtle may be used if the leaves of merely one ring are on the same level. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> (and similarly, the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 646:5) maintain that a myrtle is kosher if the leaves grow properly over three handbreadths (its minimum size), or at least the majority of that distance.
</i>. However, if there are two leaves on one level, with a third leaf slightly higher than them, that is not considered to be ""covered<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> but rather from a different species of tree. Hence, it can never be used in the lulav (<i>Or Sameach</i>).

A Kosher Myrtle

"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.3","The term ""willows of the brook"" mentioned by the Torah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Leviticus, ibid.
</i> does not include just any plant that grows by a brook, but rather a particular species, which is called the ""willows of the brook<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> That species is defined as follows:
</i>.""<br>Its leaf is extended as a brook<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., it comes to a point, rather than being rounded (<i>Sukkah</i> 33b).
This characteristic is also quoted as an explanation of the name ""willows of the brook"" (Rabbenu Asher).
</i>, its edge is smooth<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> rather than jagged (<i>Sukkah</i> ibid.).
</i>, and its stem is red. It is called a willow. The majority of this species grow near brooks. Therefore, it is called the ""willows of the brook<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> However, the use of that name is not meant to be exclusive...
</i>."" Even if this species grew in the desert or on a mountain, it would be kosher<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for the fulfillment of this mitzvah.
</i>."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.4","There is another species which resembles the willow. However, its leaf is rounded, its edge resembles a saw<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., its edge is very jagged, with large protrusions
</i>, and its stem is not red<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> but white (<i>Sukkah</i> 34a).
</i>. This is called a <i>tzaftzefah</i>. It is unfit [to be used for the mitzvah].<br>T<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> is also extended
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for it is not considered to be merely a different type of willow, but rather another species entirely.
</i>here is another type of willow, whose leaf does not have a smooth edge, but it is not like a saw. Rather, it has tiny juttings, like the edge of a small sickle. It is kosher<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 647:6 mentions that willows are frequently picked by young children who are not learned and may mistake a non-kosher species for a kosher one. Hence, the purchaser should carefully examine the willows before purchasing them.
</i>.<br>All the above definitions were explained according to the oral tradition transmitted by Moses, our teacher<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Indeed, in his introduction to his Commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam uses the definitions of the four species as examples of how the oral tradition is explained in the Talmud:

The explanations which we have received from Moses are not contested at all. Throughout all the ages, from Moses' time until the present, we have not heard of a dispute started by a Sage whether... the expression ""a fruit from a beautiful tree"" refers to the etrog. Nor have we heard of a dispute that the ""covered tree"" refers to the myrtle...
Concerning these and the like, it has been said: ""The entire Torah, [both the mitzvot] in general, and all their particulars were given to Moses on Mount Sinai."" Though the tradition was received and there is no dispute about it, one can also derive these definitions through the accepted processes of exegesis.
Thus, when the Talmud debates and discusses a concept and offers a suggestion...that perhaps, ""the fruit of the beautiful tree"" is a pomegranate...[and does not resolve the matter] until they bring proof from the exegesis of the verse..., one should not conclude that the matter was left in doubt until this point of exegesis was discovered.
Rather, from the time of Joshua onward, we saw that the etrog was the species taken with the lulav and there is no debate about that. They were merely investigating how they could find support from the Torah for the interpretation that had been transmitted.

</i>."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.5","These four species are considered to be one mitzvah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In contrast to putting on the head tefillin and<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> therefore,...
</i> the arm tefillin, which are considered to be two mitzvot. Here, taking all four species is considered to be a single mitzvah...
</i>, and each one<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> of the species...
</i> is required for its performance<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and only then is the mitzvah performed. Nevertheless, as explained in Halachah 6, the species need not be bound together; it is sufficient to take them one after the other.
This statement is taken from the Mishnah, <i>Menachot</i> 3:6, which includes the four species of the lulav in a long list of mitzvot in which all the particular elements that make up the mitzvah are required for its performance to be acceptable.
</i>. All of them [together] are called the mitzvah of lulav<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since the lulav is the tallest of all the species, the entire mitzvah is referred to by this name (<i>Sukkah</i> 37b).
</i>. One may not diminish them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> doing so violates the commandment בל תגרע (Deuteronomy 13:1 , which forbids diminishing the Torah's commandments.
</i> or add to them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> doing so violates the commandment תוסיף בל (Deuteronomy 13:1 , which forbids adding to the Torah's commandments.
</i>. If one of the species cannot be found, a similar species<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> e.g., a <i>tzaftzefah</i> for the willow, or a lemon for the etrog
</i> may not be substituted for it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rather, the mitzvah cannot be fulfilled at all. Nevertheless, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 651:12) recommends taking the species that are available, as a remembrance of the mitzvah. However, in such circumstances, a blessing should not be recited.
</i>."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.6","The most desirable way of performing the mitzvah is to bind the lulav, myrtle, and willow together, thus making a single, unified entity from the three of them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 11b explains that binding the three species together is considered more attractive than taking them each individually. Thus, taking the species in this manner conforms to the general directive requiring us to perform the mitzvot in the most esthetically appealing manner possible.
<i>Sukkah</i> 34b mentions an exegetic teaching that explains why the etrog is not bound together with the other species.
</i>.<br>Before one takes them to perform the mitzvah, he should recite the blessing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for the blessings should always be recited before the performance of the mitzvot.
</i> on the mitzvah of taking the lulav<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Our translation follows the commentary of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, who notes that in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:15, the Rambam states that if one recites the blessing before taking the lulav in his hand, he should conclude the blessing <i>...v'tzivanu litol lulav</i>. The blessing should be concluded <i>...v'tzivanu al netilat lulav</i> only if one has already taken the lulav in his hands.
</i>, for all the others are dependent upon it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned in the previous halachah and commentary, since the lulav is the tallest of all the species, its name is used to refer to the entire mitzvah.
</i>.<br>Afterwards, he takes this bound entity in his right hand and the etrog in his left hand<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since three of the four species are bound together, they are held in the hand which the Torah considers of greater prominence (<i>Sukkah</i> 37b).
</i>. He must take them as they grow<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 45b derives this concept from Exodus 26:15, which states: ""upright beams of acacia wood."" Implied is that all mitzvot fulfilled with agricultural products must be performed while they are in an upright position. (See also Halachah 9.)
</i> - i.e., their roots below towards the earth, and their heads upward towards the sky<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Even though the etrog hangs from the tree with the <i>pitam</i> downwards, its ""upright"" position is when the <i>pitam</i> faces upward (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 651:12).
</i>.<br>If a person did not bind them together, but rather took them one by one, he has fulfilled his obligation, provided he possesses all four species<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 11b states that it is a mitzvah to bind the three species together, but one may fulfill the mitzvah even when one has not done so.
This law is accepted as halachah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 651:12). The preference of the Rabbis for binding the species together is so great that if one has not bound them together before the beginning of the festival, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 651:1) recommends binding them together with a loop on the holiday rather than taking each one individually.
</i>. However, if he has only one species or he is lacking one species, he should not take them until he acquires the remaining species<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as explained in the previous halachah.

</i> branches so that the bundle will be larger, he may. Indeed, it is considered to be an adornment of the mitzvah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The latter statement can be understood to be an explanation of the former. In contrast to the other species, the myrtle is considered an adornment of the mitzvah. Since the extra myrtle branches are viewed as adornments, they are not considered to be an intervening substance separating the person from the mitzvah. (See the commentary on Halachah 11.) Nor is including them considered to be adding to the mitzvah (and thus, a violation of בל תוסיף). (See also Rabbenu Nissim and the Rashba, Vol. I, Responsum 535.)
There are some authorities who allow additional myrtle branches to be included even though they do not meet the requirement of having all three leaves on the same level. However, others do not accept this leniency (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 651:15).
</i>. However, it is forbidden to add to or reduce the numbers of the other species<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> because they are not considered to be ""adornments.""
</i>. If one adds to or reduces their number, it is not acceptable<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Ra'avad objects to this statement, arguing that the adding to the numbers of the other species does not nullify the performance of the mitzvah. Rav Avraham, the Rambam's son, writes that, based on <i>Sanhedrin</i> 88b, the Rambam amended his own manuscript copy of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> to state ""it does not nullify it"" (<i>Birkat Avraham</i> 31).

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.8","What is the required length of each of these species?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 650:8 states that if the species are smaller than the minimum limits established, they may not be used throughout the festival. Though certain leniencies are granted after the first day, they do not apply regarding this matter.
</i> The lulav may not be less than four handbreadths<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:1) describes the length of the lulav as ""three handbreadths [and more], so that it can be shaken,"" implying that, like the other species, it should be three handbreadths in length. However, since all three handbreadths of the lulav must be shaken (see the following two halachot) an additional handbreadth was required for the person to hold the lulav in his hand (Rambam, Commentary on the Mishnah).
[Rashi and most other commentaries based on <i>Sukkah</i> 32b consider the handbreadth of the lulav that extends beyond the myrtle and the willow as the addition included ""so that it can be shaken."" From the latter clauses of this halachah, it appears that the Rambam may have also adopted this interpretation.]
A handbreadth is 8 centimeters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, and 9.6 centimeters according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>. In his commentary on the above Mishnah, the Rambam emphasizes that the measure refers to three full handbreadths, each four fingerbreadths in length. This is necessary to negate the opinion of certain authorities (see the Ra'avad), who state that here the intent is three ""small"" handbreadths, so that the total length is only 10 fingerbreadths.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 650:1) accepts the Ra'avad's opinion. Nevertheless, the Ramah suggests following the Rambam's view if possible.
</i>. [Beyond that,] regardless of its length, it is kosher<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Menachot</i> 42a states that a lulav has a minimum length, but no maximum length.

If most of [the myrtle's] leaves dried out, but three fresh leaves remain, it is kosher.
Rav Chisda said: ""Provided they are at the top of each branch.""

The Rambam maintains that the same principles can also be applied to the willow.
[Note the commentary on Halachah 8:5, which mentions certain relevant principles. Indeed, in general, this clause appears to be more closely related to the principles mentioned in the following chapter, where the Rambam mentions the characteristics that disqualify the various species, rather than in this chapter, where he relates the fundamental requirements of each one. Based on <i>Sukkah</i> 34a, which relates that myrtles which are not dry (a factor still common in many Diaspora communities today) are very difficult to find, we can interpret this as an almost parenthetical expression teaching that freshness is not among the fundamental requirements for a myrtle.]

He interprets <i>Sukkah</i> 42a, ""If he lifted it up in an opposite manner, he did not fulfill his obligation,"" as referring to such a circumstance. Nevertheless, the Rambam (and similarly, most halachic authorities, including the Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 651:3) interpret that statement as referring to lifting them up opposite to their natural pattern of growth.

In the <i>Beit Yosef</i>, Rav Yosef Karo quotes the following story from the Recanti. The latter dreamed that he saw a particular pious individual writing God's name with a space separating the last ה from the first three letters. He could not comprehend the dream at all until the next day, when he saw that individual holding his etrog separate from his lulav (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 651:21).

When shaking the lulav downward, one should not turn it upside down, for this is opposite its natural pattern of growth. (See Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 651:9.)

The Ramah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 651:9) explains that passing the lulav back and forth is itself considered to be shaking it.

The Rabbis question why the Sages differentiated between the lulav and the shofar, and (as explained in Halachah 2:6), nullified the mitzvah of hearing the shofar when Rosh Hashanah fell on the Sabbath. As explained in our commentary on that halachah, in Rabbenu Nissim's commentary on the tractate of <i>Sukkah</i>, he states that this decree was instituted only because in most Jewish communities, the people were not aware of the date the court had established for Rosh Hashanah.

</i>o take the lulav on the Sabbath on the first day of Sukkot.<br>[This was instituted] because of the inhabitants of the distant settlements, who were not aware of when the new month had been declared. Thus, a uniform guideline was established, rather than having some take the lulav on the Sabbath and some not<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Sages did not want confusion to arise because of a difference in local custom. Accordingly, they were willing to decree that many Jews forego the performance of a mitzvah from the Torah, in order to establish uniformity throughout the Jewish people.
</i>. [The guiding principle was] that the obligation [of taking the lulav] on the first day applies in all places<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and the people in the distant communities could not take the lulav when the first day fell on the Sabbath because of the doubt involved
</i>, and there is no longer a Temple to use as a point of distinction<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., while the Temple was standing, the difference in practice between the people living in places where the date of the month was known and those where it was not known could be explained because everyone knew that the lulav was taken on the first day in the Temple. However, when the Temple was destroyed, there was no point of distinction, and the Sages established a totally uniform practice.
The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> questions why Sages did not institute the celebration of the second day of each festival in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> as well. If their desire for uniformity of observance was so great, why did they not establish a single practice in this regard as well?
He explains that the Sages were more reluctant to exercise their authority when they had to establish a new practice (קום ועשה) - celebrating an additional day as a festival - than when all that was necessary was to have the people refrain from the performance of a mitzvah (שב ועל תעשה), as in the case of the lulav.
Another concept can be derived from this halachah. The Hebrew word translated as Temple - מקדש - is used by the Rambam to refer to the entire city of Jerusalem. Thus, we can infer from the statement ""there is no longer a מקדש"" that this distinction is conferred on the holy city only while the Temple is standing.

</i>.<br>As explained<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in Halachah 13,

Rashi and <i>Tosafot</i>, (<i>Sukkah</i> 43b) explain that the mitzvah of the willow branch was only performed by the priests for only they were allowed to approach the Temple altar where the branches were arranged. However, from halachah 22, it appears that the Rambam does not share this opinion.
<i>Sukkah</i> 44a, b also mentions that outside the Temple there was a custom of established in the time of the prophets requiring the taking of the willow by all Jews. (See also <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:16.)

The Willow Branches Placed Around The Temple Altar

How was this mitzvah performed?<br>On each of the seven days [of the festival], branches of willows were brought a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> from Motza, a small town slightly west of Jerusalem (<i>Sukkah</i> 45a).
</i>nd stood upright near the altar w<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> These willow branches were eleven cubits high and were placed on the base of the altar.
Afterwards, they would be taken by the people, as stated in the following halachah. Rabbenu Manoach maintains that the priests would take the willow branches and give them to the people because Israelites were not allowed to approach the altar, as above. However, he notes that Rav Yitzchak ibn Giat's description of the mitzvah could be interpreted to mean that the Israelites themselves were permitted to approach the altar on this occasion.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> From this fact, Rashi and <i>Tosafot</i> conclude that the willows were taken by priests only because Israelites were not allowed to approach the Temple altar.
</i>ith their tops bent over the altar. When they would bring them and arrange them [near the altar,] a series of [shofar blasts] - <i>teki'ah, teru'ah,</i> and <i>teki'ah</i> - were sounded.<br>W<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> on the Sabbath, since the mitzvah of lulav was negated on such an occasion (Halachah 13). Indeed, in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 4:3), the Rambam writes that the reason the mitzvah of taking the willow on the Sabbath was negated was so that people would not extend the leniency and take the lulav as well.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as an expression of happiness (<i>Tosafot, Sukkah</i>, ibid.). The shofar was also sounded in connection with the communal sacrifices and other rites carried out in the Temple.
</i>hen the Sabbath fell in the midst of the festival, the willows would not be arranged [near the altar] unless the seventh day fell on the Sabbath<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The seventh day of Sukkot falls on the Sabbath only when Rosh Hashanah is celebrated on Sunday. Since the Sages attempted to prevent the latter occurrence (<i>Hilchot Kiddush Hachodesh</i> 7:7) - indeed, it is impossible according to today's fixed calendar - it was rare that the seventh day of Sukkot would fall on the Sabbath.
</i>. [On such an occasion,] the willows were arranged [near the altar]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and the willows were taken as during the week. Though the mitzvah of lulav would not be performed on such an occasion, an exception was made regarding the willows, in order...
</i>, to publicize the fact that [taking] them is a mitzvah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since the willows were placed near the altar by the priests, and the performance of the mitzvah was under the supervision of the court, there was no need to worry about people carrying willows in the public domain (<i>Sukkah</i> 43b).
In a related context, <i>Sukkah</i> 43b relates that the followers of Boethus, who did not respect the Oral Law, once tried to prevent the people from following the mitzvah of the willow branches on the Sabbath. Indeed, precisely because the source for the mitzvah is the oral tradition alone, the Sages made a point of allowing it to be observed on the Sabbath at least under such circumstances (Rabbenu Manoach).
The actual performance of the mitzvah on the Sabbath is described in the following halachah.
</i>."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.22","How would they fulfill [this mitzvah on the Sabbath]?<br>They would bring [the branches] to the Temple on the Sabbath eve and place them in golden containers, so their leaves would not dry out. O<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note the commentary on the previous halachah.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Some commentaries explain that the golden vessels were used as an expression of respect for the mitzvah. However, the <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> explains that, in comparison to containers made of other metals, golden ones are more beneficial in preserving the willows' freshness.
</i>n the following morning, they would be placed next to the altar and the people would take them in the same manner as they did each day.<br>Since the willow is not explicitly mentioned in the Torah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Maggid Mishneh's</i> text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> reads: ""it is not explicitly [an obligation] from the Torah."" Accordingly, he and the other commentators debated whether the Rambam considers a halachah conveyed by Moses from Mt. Sinai as a Torah obligation or not. In <i>Hilchot Tum'at Meit</i> 2:10, the Rambam specifically states that a halachah conveyed by tradition has the power of Torah law.
</i>, it is not taken on each of the seven days of the festival as a remembrance of the Temple<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as is the lulav (Halachah 15).
</i>. Rather, at present it is taken only on the seventh day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Hoshanah Rabbah.
</i>.<br>What is done? One takes one<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> willow
</i> branch or many branches<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> At present, it is customary to take five.
</i> in addition to the willow of the lulav, and hits the ground o<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> According to Kabbalah, the custom is to hit the ground five times.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Zohar</i> mentions this practice
</i>r a utensil with them two or three times. No blessing is recited, because this practice is a custom instituted by the prophets<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 4:3), the Rambam writes: ""The willow is a halachah conveyed by Moses....It was a custom of the prophets to take it without a blessing.""
However, in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:15, he writes:

Every practice which is a custom - even if it a custom of the prophets (e.g., taking the willow on the seventh day of the festival)... - [does not require] the recitation of a blessing.

It is possible to reconcile the two statements as follows: A blessing was never recited upon taking the willow in the Temple (though it could have been), because of the custom of the prophets mentioned in his Commentary on the Mishnah. There was never any reason to recite a blessing over taking the willow outside the Temple because it was only a custom.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.23","On each day of the festival<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in the Temple

(See also <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 664:4.)
</i> in their hands, reciting: ""Please, God, save us. Please, God, grant us success<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i> notes that this recalls the miracle of the conquest of Jericho.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Many manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> state ""Please, God, save us"" twice, repeating that verse as is our custom in the recitation of <i>Hallel</i>.
</i>"" [Psalms 118:25]. On the seventh day, they would walk around the altar seven times.<br>It has become universally accepted Jewish custom to place the ark in the center of the synagogue<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> From <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 11:3, it appears that in addition to the main ark of the synagogue, there was a small movable ark that was positioned in the center of the synagogue. The present custom is to hold the Torah scrolls on the reader's platform in the center of the synagogue. This is also mentioned in the <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>: ""The <i>chazan</i> stands as an angel of God, holding the Torah scroll in his arm.""
</i> and walk around it each day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> once, and seven times on <i>Hoshanah Rabbah</i>.
</i>, as they walked around the altar in remembrance of the Temple [service].<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
</i>"
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 7.24","The following custom was observed in Jerusalem<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as an expression of the dearness with which the people regarded the mitzvah:
</i>: A person would leave his house in the morning [carrying] his lulav in his hand<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 652:1) states that ""the eager"" fulfill the mitzvah of lulav early in the morning. Afterwards, the lulav would be carried - while open, without a carrying case - throughout the day.
</i>. He would enter the synagogue with it in his hand; pray while it was in his hand<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Even though one should not ordinarily hold any objects in one's hands while praying, lest one's concentration be distracted, since holding the lulav is a mitzvah dear to a Jew's heart, it will not become a distraction.
</i>; go to visit the sick and comfort the mourners with it in his hand<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for there is no difficulty in carrying the lulav while fulfilling those mitzvot.
</i>.

Nevertheless, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 653:1) recommends refraining from smelling the etrog, because of the doubt regarding the proper blessing to recite.

Therefore, because of the doubt, that mitzvah was also observed on the eighth day. In contrast, outside of Jerusalem there was never a mitzvah from the Torah to take the lulav for seven days. Hence, that mitzvah need not be observed on the eighth day.
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> adds a further point. It is forbidden to carry the lulav for no purpose on the eighth day, the holiday of Shemini Atzeret. No such prohibition applies regarding the use of the sukkah.

<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 32:63 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 32:189 mention that the width and length of the base of the <i>tefillin</i> should be more than one fingerbreadth. Preferably, the width and length of the head <i>tefillin</i> should be two fingerbreadths.

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 3.5","What is the order of the passages? For the head <i>tefillah</i>, the final passage, <i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i>, i<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rashi also prescribes this order for the passages of the <i>tefillin</i>, and this is the order that is accepted as halachah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 34:1). Many other Torah authorities (among them Rav Hai Gaon and Rabbenu Tam) suggest a different order, placing the two passages that begin <i>V'hayah</i>, <i>V'hayah ki y'viacha</i> and <i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i> in the center, <i>Shema</i> on the right side of the person wearing the <i>tefillin</i>, and <i>Kadesh Li</i> on his left side.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The order of the passages chosen by the Rambam - when read by a person facing the person wearing the <i>tefillin</i> - reflects their order in the Torah (<i>Menachot</i> 34b).

Thus, the Rambam (and similarly, Rabbenu Tam and those who follow his opinion) considered that the order of the passages be calculated from the perspective of a person standing opposite the person wearing the <i>tefillin</i>. In contrast, there are other opinions (<i>Shimusha Rabbah</i> and the Ra'avad) who maintain that the order of the passages should be calculated from the perspective of the person wearing the <i>tefillin</i>. (This produces two further perspectives regarding the order of the <i>tefillin</i>. The <i>Shimusha Rabbah</i> follows the same order as the Rambam except that <i>V'hoyoh im Shamoa</i>, is placed in the first compartment on the left side of the person putting on the <i>tefillin</i>, not on the right side. Similarly, the Ra'avad shares Rabbenu Tam's view, but reverses the sides.)

If their order is altered, they are not acceptable<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> For this reason, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 34:2) suggest that a God-fearing person put on both a pair of <i>tefillin</i> that follow the opinion of the Rambam and Rashi, and a second pair, that follow the opinion of Rabbenu Tam. Though the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> mentions certain reservations in this regard, in many communities it has become widespread practice to wear both pairs of <i>tefillin</i>.

Accordingly, they maintain that, after the fact, if the passages are not wrapped in this parchment, the <i>tefillin</i> may still be used (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 32:68; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 32:205).
The difference between the Rambam and the Ashkenazic authorities depends on their interpretation of a passage from the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Megilah</i>, Chapter 1). This difference in interpretation is also reflected in the laws regarding correcting a torn Torah scroll. See Chapter 9, Halachah 15.

The difference of opinion of whether it is necessary to wrap the <i>tefillin</i> in parchment has created a difficulty with regard to this obligation. The opinions which do not require that the <i>tefillin</i> be wrapped in parchment require that this hair be wrapped around the passages themselves. In contrast, the Rambam, who maintains that it is necessary to wrap them, obligates the hair to be placed around that wrapping.
In practice, it is customary to satisfy both opinions and wrap the hair around the passages, cover them with a parchment, and then wrap the same hair around the parchment as well (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 32:69, <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 32:209).

At present, after the compartments of the <i>tefillin</i> are fashioned into a single block, a sinew is passed between the compartments. Afterwards, they are glued together, and then the entire block is shaped into a square. The grooves we see do not represent the real divisions between the blocks, but are merely external impressions.
This process is employed, because were the compartments not to be glued together, it would be difficult to form the <i>tefillin</i> into a square. Even if that were possible at the outset, problems might arise over the course of time, because the compartments might spread further apart, and thus prevent the square shape from being maintained. Though it is acceptable to use <i>tefillin</i> made in the present manner, the Rabbis suggest using those in which the separation between the compartments remains openly visible afterwards.

a) the arrangements of one's own priorities and goals in life;<br>
b) the order in which people must be given honor and respect.

Torah Study 3.3,"None of the other mitzvot can be equated to the study of Torah. Rather, the study of Torah can be equated to all the mitzvot<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cites <i>Pe'ah</i> 1:1 as the source for this statement. That Mishnah lists a number of mitzvot whose ""benefits are enjoyed in this world, though the principle [reward] remains for the world to come"" and concludes ""the study of Torah is equivalent to them all.""
However, the <i>Lev Shlomo</i> notes that the antecedents of the phrase ""them all"" are the various mitzvot which are mentioned previously in the mishnah and not ""all the mitzvot of the Torah."" Hence, he refers to the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Pe'ah</i> 1:1), which states: ""All the mitzvot of the Torah are not worth one word of the Torah.""
</i>, because study leads to deed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for without study, one will never know how to fulfill the mitzvot properly.
</i>. Therefore, study takes precedence over deed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Chapter 1, Halachah 3, and the commentary on it.
Though there is a similarity between the halachah cited above and the present one, the two are not redundant. That halachah deals with the course of action proper for a person whose father has not instructed him in Torah study. Thus, the Rambam tells him that rather than ignore Torah study and devote himself to the performance of good deeds alone, he should study.
This chapter centers around the principle that Torah study is the highest rung a person can reach. Accordingly, the advice in this and the following halachah applies to even a person who has established a basis of Torah knowledge. It teaches him to seek personal fulfillment in study rather than in deed. Similarly, it advises us that the most propitious way to use each moment of spare time is to devote these moments to Torah study.

Torah Study 3.4,"[The following rules apply] when a person is confronted with the performance of a mitzvah and the study of Torah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and the performance of the mitzvah would cause him to interrupt his studies.
</i>: If the mitzvah can be performed by another individual, he should not interrupt his studies<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cites the following narrative from the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Pesachim</i> 3:7):
Rabbi Abahu sent his son to study in Tiberias. When he came to visit him, the local people praised his son for his piety in burying the dead. When he heard this, Rabbi Abahu rebuked his son severely, ""Is it because there are no graves in Caesarea that I sent you to Tiberias?""
<i>Mo'ed Katan</i> 9b derives the priority of study over the performance of mitzvot as follows:
Proverbs 3:15 states: ""None of your desires can be equated to it [the Torah],"" implying that ""your desires"" - i.e., things which man wants - cannot be equated to Torah study, but ""God's desires"" - i.e., the mitzvot - can be equated with it.
In contrast, Proverbs 8:11 states: ""No desire"" - seemingly implying even God's desires, the mitzvot - ""can be equated to it."" How can the two be resolved? When it is possible for the mitzvah to be performed by another individual, nothing takes precedence over Torah study. However, if there is no one else to perform the mitzvah, the performance of the mitzvah is given priority.
</i>. If not<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> If there is no way the mitzvah can be performed by another person - e.g., paying honor to a deceased person or collecting for charity, when one's position will cause one's words to have a greater effect than those of other people...

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 17a teaches: ""The ultimate of knowledge is Teshuvah and good deeds."" Similarly, the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 1:2) states that it would be preferable for a person who studies without performing the mitzvot never to have been created. Thus, the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Shabbat</i> 1:2) relates that Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, who would not interrupt his studies even for prayer, would stop studying to build a sukkah and to bind his lulav.

Torah Study 3.5,"The first aspect of a person's judgement [in the world to come] will center on Torah study. Only afterwards will his other deeds [be considered]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The statement is based on <i>Sanhedrin</i> 7a. Other sources (<i>Shabbat</i> 31a) state that the first question posed to a person in the world to come will be: ""Did you deal faithfully in business?""
<i>Tosafot, Sanhedrin</i> <i>ibid.</i>, offers two possible resolutions to this apparent contradiction:<br>
a) A person who never studied at all is judged first regarding Torah study. However, one who studied, but did not establish fixed times for study is judged first regarding his business affairs;<br>
b) Even though the first question that the soul is asked centers on his business affairs, the first retribution he will receive will result from his neglect of Torah study.
</i>.<br>Accordingly, our Sages<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See <i>Pesachim</i> 50b, <i>Sotah</i> 22b, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 105b.
</i> would say: ""A person should always occupy himself in Torah study, whether for God's sake or even if not for God's sake<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam elaborates further on the definition of these concepts in <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 10:4-5:
The Sages of the previous generations declared: Should one say: ""I will study Torah in order that I become wealthy, in order that I be called a Rabbi, or in order that I receive reward in the world to come?"" The Torah teaches [Deuteronomy 11:13]: ""[If you are careful to observe My commandments...] to love God;"" [implying] that all that you do should be done only out of love.<br>
The Sages also said: [Psalms 112:1 instructs:] ""Desire His commandments greatly."" [Desire His commandments] and not the reward [that comes from] His commandments...<br>
Anyone who occupies himself with the Torah in order to receive reward or in order to protect himself from retribution is considered as one who is not occupied for God's sake.<br>
[In contrast,] anyone who occupies himself with it, not because of fear, nor to receive a reward, but rather because of his love for the Lord of the entire earth, Who commanded it, is one who occupies himself for God's sake.
</i>, for from [the study of Torah which] is not carried out for God's sake<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 17a) and <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Ta'anit</i> 7a) note that the Talmud is extremely critical of those who do not occupy themselves with the Torah for God's sake.
<i>Ta'anit</i> 7a declares that whenever a person does not study Torah for God's sake, the Torah becomes a deadly potion for him. <i>Berachot</i> 17a states that it would have been better for a person who does not study Torah for God's sake not to have been born. In resolution, the commentaries explain that there are two levels of occupying oneself with Torah that is not for God's sake:
a) to gain wealth, honor, or other benefits, as implied by the Rambam here;<br>
b) in order to vex a colleague.
Our Sages suggest occupation with Torah study even if it is not intended for God's sake, if one has the former motives. However, if one's motives are the latter, then our Sages' harsh words of criticism apply.
</i> will come [the study of Torah which] is carried out for God's sake<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The introduction to <i>Eicha Rabbah</i> (2) quotes God as saying: ""Would that Israel abandon Me and keep the Torah...for its light would ultimately return them to the good."" If a Jew frequently occupies himself with Torah, the inner Godly nature of Torah will eventually have an effect upon him and motivate him to serve God with the proper intentions.
There is a deeper aspect to this statement: The Hebrew <i>mitoch</i>, translated as ""from,"" also can be interpreted as ""from the inner part."" Every element of a Jew's life is motivated by his Godly potential. Though he may think he is performing a mitzvah for selfish intent, the inner core of that service, its <i>toch</i>, is the Jew's desire to cling to God without any ulterior motive.
The Rambam elaborates on the principle that selfish desires can be used as motivation for involvement in Torah in his Commentary on the Mishnah, in his introduction to the tenth chapter of <i>Sanhedrin</i>:
When a young child is brought to a teacher to be taught the Torah, this is the greatest good for him, [allowing him] to attain fulfillment. However, because of his youth and underdeveloped intellect, [the child] does not comprehend this good...<br>
Therefore, it is necessary for the teacher...to motivate him to his studies with things that he loves...<br>
He should tell him: ""I will give you nuts, figs, or a little honey."" It is out of this motivation that the child [begins to] study. [The child studies] not because of the essence of the study, for the child has no comprehension of that, but because of the food. Eating these delicacies is more important to him than the actual study...<br>
When he becomes older and his intellect grows to the point where he realizes the worthlessness of these items, he should be encouraged and motivated to learn by the promise of things he holds dear. His teacher should tell him: ""Study and I will buy you nice shoes or beautiful garments."" Thus, he will study, not for the sake of the study itself, but for the garment, the garment becoming more valuable for him than the Torah...
The Rambam continues mentioning other factors that may be employed to motivate older children - e.g., money or honor. He concludes:
All this is degrading. Nevertheless, because of the limits of a person's intellect, it may be necessary to make the goal of wisdom something other than wisdom.
In <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam also emphasizes how a teacher must slowly mold a child's character and lead him, step by step, to an appreciation of the proper motives for the service of God:
As their knowledge grows and their wisdom increases, this secret [service of God for His sake] should be revealed to them [slowly,] bit by bit. They should become accustomed to this concept gradually, until they grasp it and know it and begin serving [God] out of love.

Torah Study 3.6,"A person whose heart inspires him to fulfill this mitzvah in a fitting manner<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As explained in the commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 8, the Rambam's statements imply that there are two aspects of Torah study:<br>
a) The obligation to study Torah, which is incumbent on every individual: the establishment of fixed times for Torah study (Chapter 1, Halachah 8).<br>
b) A commitment to devote oneself to Torah study that has no limitations.
The first aspect reflects a commitment that takes into consideration man's perspective, and, hence, is limited in scope. However, when a person views the Torah from God's perspective and appreciates its infinite nature, he will be inspired to make an unbounded commitment to Torah study. See also the commentary on the halachah mentioned above.

</i>.<br>[Rather,] this is the path of Torah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam does not advocate ascetic penances. (See <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> 3:1.) Nor does he necessarily stipulate that ""a life of difficulty"" is a prerequisite for complete involvement in Torah study. However, it is often the only path with which one can attain that goal.
Frequently, earning enough to live a life of comfort takes so much time that one will not be able to devote himself to Torah study in a fitting manner. Furthermore, indulgence in comfort often leads a person to preoccupation with his own needs and desires. Suddenly, he becomes faced with an entire host of ""necessities,"" without which he cannot continue.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This statement and the others in this halachah are a combination of quotes from <i>Avot</i> 6:4, 2:17 and 5:23.
</i>: Eat bread with salt, drink water in small measure, sleep on the ground, live a life of difficulty, and toil in Torah.<br>The task is not incumbent upon you to complete<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> If a person contemplates the totality of Torah knowledge which there is to grasp, he may be intimidated and unwilling to begin such an undertaking. Hence, he is counselled that he is not expected to complete its study. However,...

</i>. If you have acquired much Torah, you have acquired much reward<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Mishnah continues to explain that the reward for the righteous will be in the world to come.
It is difficult to understand why the Rambam emphasizes the aspect of reward, when in the previous halachah he stressed how one should not study Torah for ulterior motives. Included in the latter is also the reward in the world to come.
</i>, and that reward is commensurate with the difficulty [invested]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his Commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam interprets this to mean: ""Your reward will be commensurate with the effort invested in Torah study."" See also Halachah 12, which elaborates on the nature of the effort a person must invest in his Torah studies.
In his introduction to <i>Avot</i>, Chapter 6, the Rambam offers a slightly different interpretation: ""A person's reward will be commensurate with the effort necessary to overcome his natural inclination.""
</i>."
Torah Study 3.7,"Perhaps, one will say: ""[I will interrupt my studies] until after I gather money, and then I will return and study, [I will interrupt my studies] until after I buy what I need, and then, when I can divert my attention from my business, I will return and study<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note Chapter 1, Halachah 5, which counsels studying Torah before marriage, so the yoke of financial responsibility will not interfere with one's studies.
</i>."" If you consider such thoughts, you will never merit the crown of Torah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The commentaries have offered two reasons why such an individual will never merit ""the crown of Torah:""<br>
a) Desire is never satisfied. ""Whoever possesses one hundred, desires two hundred; whoever possesses two hundred, desires four hundred"" (<i>Kohelet Rabbah</i> 1:34). Once a person has given his material concerns priority over Torah study, it is very difficult for him to reverse his pattern and devote himself completely to Torah study.<br>
b) The time which he lost while involved in business cannot be recovered, and thus, he will never reach the heights of Torah knowledge that he could have attained beforehand.
</i>.<br>Rather, make your work secondary, and your Torah study a fixed matter<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Avot</i> 1:14, the Rambam writes:
Make your Torah study of primary importance and all your other affairs secondary. If they come your way, it is good, and if not, there is no loss in their absence.
Similarly, in <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> 2:7, the Rambam quotes <i>Avot</i> 4:10, ""Minimize your business involvement and occupy yourself with Torah.""
Nevertheless, a person need not fear that involvement in Torah study will prevent him from achieving prosperity. <i>Berachot</i> 35b relates:
The Sages of the previous generations made their Torah study primary and their business affairs secondary, and achieved success in both. We have made our business affairs primary and our Torah study secondary, and have not achieved success in either.
Do not say: ""When I have free time, I will study,"" for perhaps, you will never have free time. - In his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Avot</i> 2:5, the Rambam also associates this statement of Hillel's with the statement of Shammai quoted above.
</i>. Do not say: ""When I have free time, I will study,"" for perhaps you will never have free time."
Torah Study 3.8,"It is written in the Torah [Deuteronomy 30:12, 13]:<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rav Kapach renders this: ""It is written about the Torah,"" emphasizing that according to the Rambam, the antecedent of the pronoun ""it"" in the above verse is Torah study and not Teshuvah, as explained by the Ramban and others.

[This implies:] ""It is not in the heavens"" - i.e., it is not found in the proud spirited<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and self-centered. Such an attitude runs contrary to the spirit of Torah and, ultimately, prevents one from grasping it, as explained in the following halachah.

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for business purposes. In contrast, one is advised to travel to study Torah, as <i>Avot</i> relates: ""Exile yourself to a place of Torah.""

Torah Study 3.9,"The words of Torah can be compared to water, as [Isaiah 55:1] states: ""Behold, all who are thirsty, come to the water<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., the nature of such a personality does not allow an individual to grasp the words of Torah. As obvious from the contrast with the humble, pride prevents one from grasping Torah for two reasons:<br>

b) Pride often leads a person to material desire, whose pursuit will take a person away from devotion to Torah study.

Torah Study 3.10,"Anyone who comes to the conclusion that he should involve himself in Torah study without doing work and derive his livelihood from charity, desecrates [God's] name, d<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See the commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 7, which quotes the Rambam's commentary on <i>Avot</i> at length, strongly decrying the deriving of material benefit from one's Torah knowledge.
These convictions are also expressed in <i>Hilchot Matnot Ani'yim</i> 10:18, which states:
Even a dignified Sage who becomes poor should work in a profession, even a degrading profession, rather than seek public assistance. It is better to skin the hides of dead animals than to tell the people, ""I am a Sage, support me.""<br>
Our greatest Sages were wood-choppers, porters, water-drawers... They did not ask anything from the public and refused to accept anything that was given to them.
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> takes issue with the Rambam's statements and states that there is no prohibition against a Torah Sage receiving support from others. Though the Rambam quotes many examples of sages who performed simple labors to earn their livelihood, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains how none of them can be taken to be conclusive proof of the Rambam's position.
For example, the Rambam quotes <i>Yoma</i> 35b, which relates how Hillel would do simple work to earn his sustenance. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Talmud's statements about Hillel were made before his greatness was appreciated. There is no proof that he continued working as a common laborer afterwards.
The practice of taking payment for Torah study has its source in <i>Tosafot, Ketubot</i> 106a, which relates that individuals who give up the opportunity to earn their livelihood in other professions so that they can teach Torah or serve as judges are able to receive remuneration, because, in essence, they are not receiving payment for their Torah, but for their time.
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> concludes:
It is possible to explain that our master's intention is that a person should not cast off the yoke of labor in order to receive his livelihood from others in order to study. Rather, first, he should learn a profession with which he can sustain himself. If that is sufficient for him, it is good. If not, he may receive his livelihood from the community...<br>
Even if this is not our master's intention, as apparent from his Commentary on the Mishnah, whenever one is in doubt about the halachah, one should follow the custom. We have seen all the Sages of Israel, both before and after our master, accepting their livelihood from the community.<br>
Furthermore, even if the halachah followed our master..., it is possible that all the sages of the [previous] generations agreed to do so because...if the livelihood of the scholars and the teachers were not available, they would not be able to labor in Torah as is fitting, and the Torah would be forgotten, Heaven forbid. Since it is available, they are able to study, ""and Torah is magnified and becomes stronger.""
These ideas are quoted as halachah by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> and the Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 246:5). It must be noted that even the Rambam (Chapter 6, Halachah 10, Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>ibid.,Hilchot De'ot</i> 6:2) allows a person to give a sage money to invest, or to afford him other benefits in commerce and trade.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i>, Chapter 5, and <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 1:4, the Rambam mentions the severity of the sin of desecrating God's name.

Also, they commanded and declared:<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Avot, ibid.</i> The Rambam reverses the order of the statements in the Mishnah, perhaps, because the first clause is more explicit. Alternatively, because chronologically, Hillel, the author of the latter clause, preceded Rabbi Tzadok, the author of the former.

Also, they commanded and declared: ""Love work and despise Rabbinic positions<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his commentary on that Mishnah, the Rambam writes: ""Without work, it will be difficult for him for him, and he will steal and cheat.

Similarly, <i>Avot</i> 2:2 teaches:

U<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The commentaries cite <i>Kiddushin</i> 29a: ""Whoever does not teach his son a profession is as if he taught him to steal,"" as the source for the Rambam's statements.

Torah Study 3.11,"It is a tremendous advantage for a person to derive his livelihood from his own efforts<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> One of the rationales given by many of the Rabbis who permit scholars to derive benefit from their studies is that performing menial work will cheapen the common man's appreciation of them, and thus minimize the honor given to the Torah.

[to mean that] the Torah cannot be permanently acquired except by a person who gives up his life in the tents of wisdom.<br>S<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> When you minimize your involvement in Torah because of difficulties, then ""your strength"" - your Torah knowledge - will be ""small"" - will not remain with you (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>).
Others cite <i>Berachot</i> 63a: ""Anyone who applies himself feebly to the words of Torah will not have the strength to stand in a day of adversity.""
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Our Sages frequently associated the expression ""tents"" with houses of study. (See the commentaries on Genesis 25:27 and Deuteronomy 33:18.)
</i>imilarly, Solomon said in his wisdom [Proverbs 24:10]: ""If you faint in the day of adversity, your strength is small."" He also said [Ecclesiastes 2:9]: ""Also, my wisdom remained with me."" [This can be interpreted to mean:] The wisdom which I learned in anger<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Hebrew word <i>af</i> can have both meanings - ""even"" and ""anger.""
</i>, this is what remained with me<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The commentaries interpret this as a reference to the anger displayed by the teachers during their instruction. (See <i>Matnat K'hunah, Kohelet Rabbah</i> 2:9.) This continues the theme that the dedication to Torah study beyond one's nature is the key to acquiring Torah as one's own.
In his commentary on <i>Avot</i> 5:19, the Rambam quotes this verse and interpretation, and associates it with the advice he gives teachers in Chapter 4, Halachah 5, to cast fear into the hearts of the students.
</i>.<br>Our Sages declared:<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 5:1
</i> A covenant has been established that anyone who wearies himself in Torah study in a house of study<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Many manuscripts substitute ""in a synagogue,"" as is the text in the Jerusalem Talmud.
</i> will not forget it quickly<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., the fact that study is carried out in a house of study itself contributes to its retention by the students. Accordingly, our Sages highly recommend that one study in a house of study (or at least in a synagogue) whenever possible. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>, Hilchot Talmud Torah 4:10.)
</i>. Anyone who wearies himself in Torah study in private will become wise, as [Proverbs 11:2] states: ""To the modest will come wisdom<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> It must be noted that <i>Berachot</i> 63b severely criticizes those who study Torah alone (when they have the opportunity to study with others). Similarly, in the following chapter, when the Rambam discusses the actual process of study, he continually refers to a teacher studying with many students.
</i>.""<br>Whoever raises his voice during his studies<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 5:1, emphasizes that one should not raise one's voice overly loud.

The <i>Tanya</i>, Chapter 38, explains that a person who studies out loud and invests his energy in Torah study elevates his body and natural life force.
<b>In contrast, one who reads silently will forget quickly. -</b> It is difficult to ignore the contrast between secular study, which is carried out in a silent library, and the study of Torah carried out in a noisy house of study, each person verbalizing the subject matter which he is studying.
Based on <i>Berachot</i> 15b and the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 62:3, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 2:12) states that the study of Torah is comparable to other mitzvot associated with speech. A person cannot fulfill his obligation through mere thought, and must either vocalize the words himself or hear from someone else who reads out loud.
</i>. In contrast, one who reads silently will forget quickly."

The term ""wisdom"" is interpreted as a reference to those aspects of Torah study described as <i>Gemara</i> or <i>Talmud</i> (Chapter 1, Halachah 11). At night, when a person is removed from his daytime pressures, he is able to concentrate more on these abstract subjects.

[Conversely,] a person who neglects Torah study because he is prosperous and, therefore, is busy eating, drinking, and seeking pleasure, will ultimately become poor to the extent that the reason he neglects Torah study will be his pursuit of his daily bread.

Torah Study 2.1,"Teachers of small children should be appointed in each and every land, in each and every region, and in each and every village.<br>If a village does not have children who study Torah, its populace is placed under a ban of ostracism until they employ teachers for the children.

Though our text of that passage differs slightly from the statements here, in the various commentaries and codes (e.g., the <i>She'eltot</i> of Rabbenu Achai Gaon, the <i>Halachot</i> of Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi), we find various versions of that passage. Hence, it is possible to assume that the Rambam's statements are a quote from his text of the Talmud.

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
This practice was continued in the subsequent generations. Even though the dispersion of the Jewish people and the subjugation to the gentile powers made the management of their communal affairs more difficult, throughout the ages we find references to the establishment of communal programs of education in both the codes of Jewish law and the chronicles of Jewish history. (See Ramah, <i>Choshen Mishpat</i>, 163:3; <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 1:3.)
Originally, it was customary for the community to impose taxes to pay for the education of all the children, whether their parents were rich or poor. However, at present it has become customary for each parent to pay for his own child's education. However, if he lacks the financial means to do so, the community is obligated to accept this burden.
If a village does not have children who study Torah, the city's populace is placed under a ban of ostracism - See Chapter 7, Halachah 5 for a precise definition of this term.

Torah Study 2.2,"Children should be brought to study [under a teacher's instruction]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 6 and the commentary on it, even before a child reached that age his father would teach him particular verses from the Torah.

</i>, according to the child's health and build<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This would determine when he would be able to begin the long and rigorous study program described in this halachah.
</i>. Below the age of six, he should not be brought [to a teacher]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for he will not be able to absorb his studies (<i>Bava Batra</i>, <i>ibid.</i>).
At present, it is customary to send children to school at much earlier ages. They are not subjected to such a rigorous schedule and much of the time is devoted to activities other than actual study. Nevertheless, their presence in school is important to develop their character and commitment to Jewish values.
</i>.<br>A teacher may employ corporal punishment to cast fear upon [the students]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The advice that Proverbs 13:24 gives a father: ""He that spares the rod, hates his son,"" also applies to a teacher. Indeed, <i>Makkot</i> 8a equates a teacher to a father in this respect.
<i>Makkot</i> 22b relates that Zechariah 13:6, ""What are these wounds?...Those which I was wounded in the house of my beloved,"" refers to the beatings administered to school children.
See also Chapter 3, Halachah 12 and Chapter 4, Halachah 5.
</i>. However, he should not beat them cruelly, like an enemy<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note the parallel of this expression to Jeremiah 30:14. Note also Chapter 4, Halachot 4-5, which recommend restraint and patience on the teacher's part.
</i>. Therefore, he should not beat them with a rod or a staff, but rather with a small strap<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
From Rav's words, we can infer that corporal punishment may be employed to try to motivate a student to be more attentive. However, if it does not prove to be a successful tool, it should not be used further, lest it create a permanent aversion to Torah study.
[The teacher] should sit and instruct them the entire day and for a portion of the night, to train them to study during the day and night. - So that as adults, they will be accustomed to fulfilling the obligation mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 8.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Bava Batra</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) relates that Rav instructed Rav Shmuel bar Shilat (a well known teacher of children):
</i>.<br>[The teacher] should sit and instruct them the entire day and for a portion of the night, to train them to study during the day and night. The children should not neglect [their studies] at all, except at the end of the day on the eve of the Sabbaths and festivals<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., they should study on the mornings of these days, but not in the afternoons.
The commentaries have questioned the source for the Rambam's statements. Some have pointed to <i>Sukkah</i> 28a, which praises Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai for never leaving the house of study except on the eve of Pesach and the eve of Yom Kippur. Similarly, <i>Pesachim</i> 109a applies such praise to Rabbi Akiva. However, it is difficult to say that these are the sources for the Rambam's statements. Firstly, the passages refer to adults and not to children. Also, the fact that these passages cite the behavior of these Sages as worthy of praise seems to imply that it was exceptional and not the rule followed by most.
</i> and on the festivals themselves<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for study might disturb a child's conception of the air of rejoicing and celebration that must accompany the festivals. It must be noted that the Rambam suggests that adults use some of their time on the festivals to study (<i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Yom Tov</i> 6:19).
</i>. On the Sabbath<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> They should not cease their studies. Nevertheless...
</i>, they should not begin new material<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for grasping it may involve difficulty and strain, which should be avoided on the Sabbath. (See <i>Nedarim</i> 37a.)
</i>. However, they should review what was learned already<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for this does not involve tremendous strain.
</i>.<br>The children should never be interrupted from their studies, even for the building of the Temple<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Shabbat</i> 119b makes this statement in the context of its description of the great merit of the children's study, as mentioned in the previous halachah. Indeed, this appears to be the Rambam's logic in the entire halachah. Since children's study is so important, no unnecessary interruptions should be made.

Torah Study 2.3,"A teacher of children who leaves the children and goes out<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Bava Batra</i> 8b relates that Rav once found Rav Shmuel bar Shilat strolling in a garden. He reproved him: ""Have you abandoned your faithfulness?""

</i>, or [remains] with them but performs other work<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The commentaries have explained the source for this halachah as follows:
The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>D'mai</i> 7:3) relates that Rabbi Yochanan encountered a teacher who looked emaciated. When the Sage enquired about him, his colleagues explained that he fasted. Rabbi Yochanan was very critical: ""If a normal hired worker is forbidden to undergo penances lest he not produce as much as desired, how much more so does this apply to someone doing God's work.""
Accordingly, since we find that a person hired to do one job should not perform another at the same time (<i>Tosefta, Bava Metzia</i> 4:7), it can be assumed that a teacher should refrain from doing so.

Some authorities maintain that these prohibitions apply only to the classrooms of previous generations, which were often private and quite secluded. In contrast, they maintain that no prohibition exists in today's large schools. However, it is questionable if that conclusion can be reached in view of the text of <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i>.

<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 1:3) states that the above applies only to instruction in the Written Law. Instruction in the more complicated realms of study requires even smaller classes. However, a parent cannot demand that such instruction be provided from communal funds.
As explained in the commentary on Halachot 1:12, 2:2, today the goals of study differ from those of the previous generations.

In the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 245:19), he concludes that it is preferable to take the latter teacher.

The Rambam interprets that statement to mean that once the practice of employing qualified teachers in each community was instituted, there was no longer a need to transfer a child from his home town to another city.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.1","[These are the rules governing] the four species: the lulav, the myrtle, the willow, and the etrog. If one of them was:

In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:1), the Rambam explains that any of the species which are stolen may not be used for the mitzvah, because a sin may not serve as the medium with which a mitzvah will be performed (מצוה הבאה בעבירה). (See also <i>Hilchot Chametz U'matzah</i> 6:7; <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbe'ach</i> 5:7, 5:9.)
<i>Sukkah</i> 29b-30a mentions this reason, but also a second explanation: because, as stated in Halachah 10, on the first day of the festival a person must own the four species he uses for the mitzvah. (See the commentary on Halachah 9 for a further discussion of this matter.)

Fruit or branches that are dried out do not fit the latter description.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 645:5, 646:7) defines ""drying out"" as losing all its green and fading to a whitish color. The Ramah mentions an even more lenient opinion.

Even according to the second opinion, the despair over recovering the article is not sufficient to allow the thief to use it, as is obvious from <i>Hilchot Gezeilah</i> 2:1, where the Rambam writes:

A stolen article whose form has not changed...even though its owner has despaired of its recovery...must be returned to its owner.

Thus, the article is not considered to belong to the thief, and he may not use it to fulfill the mitzvah. However, if the thief performed a deed which changed the appearance of the lulav or any of the other species, he is considered to have acquired it and may fulfill the mitzvah with it. Nevertheless, he should not recite a blessing before performing the mitzvah with such a lulav (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 649:1).

In these instances, the nullification of the <i>ashera</i> will not cause it to be permitted for use; rather, it must be totally destroyed. Hence, it is considered to have no size at all, and, therefore, may not be used for the mitzvah (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>). (See also the Commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 3.)
Alternatively, since the <i>ashera</i> itself was worshiped, it may no longer be used for a mitzvah. A parallel can be found in <i>Hilchot Tzitzit</i> 1:11, which relates that the wool of a sheep that was worshiped may not be used for tzitzit, although that wool does not become prohibited.

Though the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:2) states that such a myrtle is unacceptable, the Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 34b) states that the halachah follows Rabbi Tarfon, whose opinion is quoted by the Rambam in this halachah.
In his commentary on this halachah, the Ra'avad states:

For a number of years, the spirit of prophecy has been present in our chamber of study, and we have determined that [such a myrtle] is not acceptable.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 646:10) quotes the Rambam's opinion. However, the Ramah writes that it is proper to adhere to the Ra'avad's view if possible.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 646:4) quotes the <i>Maggid Mishneh's</i> statements as halachah. In contrast, Rabbenu Manoach's interpretation is not accepted.

The Ra'avad objects to this statement and maintains that some of the etrog's substance must also be lacking for it to be deemed unacceptable. The difference between these two opinions depends on a difference in the text of the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:6). The Rambam's text reads:

If [an etrog] was perforated, peeled, cracked, or lacking even the slightest amount of its substance, it is unacceptable.

In contrast, the Ra'avad's text read:

If [an etrog] was perforated, peeled, cracked: when it lacks even the slightest amount of its substance, it is unacceptable.

Though the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 649:5 quotes the Rambam, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> (649:17) and the <i>Taz</i> (649:9) quote the other view.
</i> or because they were stolen or taken by force<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Pri Megadim</i> explains that even according to the Rambam, a blessing should not be recited when performing the mitzvah in this fashion.
</i> are [disqualified for use] only on the first day of the festival<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 1, there are two explanations why a stolen lulav may not be used on the first day:
a) a sin may not serve as the medium with which a mitzvah will be performed (מצוה הבאה בעבירה);
b) as stated in Halachah 10, on the first day of the festival a person must own the four species he uses for the mitzvah.
The commentaries explain that the Rambam follows the latter rationale. However, those who follow the first opinion (the Ra'avad, the Ramban, Rabbenu Asher) forbid the use of stolen species on the later days as well. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid.) quotes the Rambam, while the Ramah follows the other view.
[Though the above explanation is frequently used, it is difficult to accept. First, in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:1), the Rambam mentions the reason of מצוה הבאה בעבירה. Also, in <i>Hilchot Chametz U'matzah</i> 6:7 and in <i>Hilchot Issurei Mizbe'ach</i> 5:7 and 5:9, he forbids the use of stolen articles for the performance of a commandment. In addition, he has not yet mentioned the halachah requiring one to own the lulav used on the first day.
The <i>Taz</i> (649:15) clarifies the matter slightly further by explaining that since taking the lulav on the second day is only a Rabbinic commandment, using a stolen lulav is allowed even though it is a מצוה הבאה בעבירה.]
</i>. On the second day of the festival<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The literal translation of the Rambam's words are ""from the second holiday,"" implying that these leniencies are granted even in the Diaspora, where the second day is celebrated as a holiday. Though all the laws of the holiday apply on the second day as well as the first, this applies only to the laws of the holiday itself. In contrast, in other contexts, since we follow a fixed calendar and know that the holidays fall on their appropriate dates, the restrictions applying to the first day do not apply on the subsequent days (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).
Rabbenu Asher differs and maintains that all the restrictions that apply to the lulav on the first day must also be observed on the second day as well. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 649:5) writes that all the species disqualified on the first day may be taken on the second day, but a blessing should not be recited.
</i> and on the other days<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Chol Hamo'ed</i>, when all opinions agree that...
</i>, they are all kosher.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
</i><br>Those which are disqualified because of the association with idol worship<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> mentioned in Halachah 1
</i> or because the etrog is forbidden to be eaten<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as mentioned in Halachah 2
</i> are unacceptable both on the first day and on the later days."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.10","On the first day of the festival<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> It appears from the Rambam's statements that even in Jerusalem, where Torah law requires that the mitzvah be fulfilled for all seven days of the festival, the obligation to own the lulav applies only on the first day.
</i>, a person cannot fulfill his obligation by using a lulav that belongs to a colleague and was borrowed from him<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As explained in the commentary on the previous halachah, the Biblical source for the mitzvah of taking the four species, Leviticus 23:40, states: ""On the first day, take for yourself<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for seven days."" In this context, only a stolen sukkah is disqualified and a borrowed sukkah is permitted (<i>Sukkah</i> 27b).
Since in both cases, the source for the exclusion is the same phrase, one might ask why the laws pertaining to each are different. Many explain that since, as explained in the commentary to that halachah, the Torah includes a special verse to teach us that a borrowed sukkah is permitted, the scope of the exclusion implied by ""for yourself"" is limited.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 637:3 explains that since the person owning the sukkah grants his colleague the use of it, the borrowed sukkah can be considered ""as his own."" Since a person has to treat a sukkah as his permanent dwelling for the seven days of the holiday, it follows that the sukkah was lent for that purpose. Thus, while a person is using it, he may consider it ""as his own,"" i.e., just like his own dwelling. See <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 19.
</i> the fruit of a beautiful tree..."" The phrase ""for yourself"" implies that a person must own the species he uses for the mitzvah (<i>Sukkah</i> 41b).
As mentioned in Chapter 5, Halachah 25, a borrowed sukkah may be used on the holiday. Though Deuteronomy 16:13 states ""Celebrate the Sukkot holiday </i>, unless the latter gives it to him as a present<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though there are certain restrictions against the transfer of property on a holiday, it is permitted to give a colleague a present (Rambam, Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 3:11).
</i>.<br>If [the owner of the lulav] gives it to him as a present on the condition<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The use of the Hebrew term על מנת frees one from certain obligations in phrasing the terms of the conditional agreement. (See <i>Hilchot Zechiyah Umatanah</i> 3:8.)
</i> that he return it, he may fulfill his obligation with it and return it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See <i>Hilchot Zechiyah Umatanah</i> 3:9.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There are authorities who require that the owner specifically state that he is giving the lulav to his colleague on the condition that the latter return it. However, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 658:5) states that even if the owner gives a colleague a lulav without making such a statement, it is assumed that the lulav was given subject to this condition.
</i>, because a present given on condition that it be returned is considered a present. If he does not return it, he does not fulfill his obligation, because it is as though it were stolen<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., by failing to fulfill the condition under which the present was given, the recipient nullifies the legal transfer of ownership. Thus, although he was in physical possession of the article, it did not belong to him. Hence, it is considered to be stolen and, thus, not eligible to be used for the mitzvah (<i>Sukkah</i>, ibid.).
</i>.<br>[On the first day,]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> before all the adults who desire to use it have fulfilled the mitzvah (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, ibid. 6)
</i> a lulav should not be given to a minor<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The definition of the term ""minor"" in this context has been the subject of debate among the Rabbis. From the Rambam's phraseology, it appears that he includes all minors in this category. However, Rabbenu Nissim writes that a child of six or seven can transfer property and, hence, his return of the lulav is valid.
Support for Rabbenu Nissim's position is brought from the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:10), which relates that Rav Nachman bar Ya'akov gave his etrog as a present to his son and told him: ""When you take possession of it and fulfill the mitzvah, return it to me."" Nevertheless, the passage does not serve as conclusive proof, because the possibility exists that his son had already reached majority. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid. 6) follows the Rambam's view.
</i>, since, according to Torah law, a minor can acquire articles<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> which are given to him by others who consciously desire that the minor acquire the property, in contrast to ownerless articles, which he cannot acquire according to Torah law (<i>Maggid Mishneh, Hilchot Zechiyah Umatanah</i> 4:7).
</i> but cannot transfer them to others<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The transfer of the ownership of an article requires a conscious decision. Torah law maintains that a child lacks intellectual maturity (דעת), and thus is incapable of making such a decision.
</i>. Thus, [the minor's] return of the article is not considered to be a return [from a legal perspective]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., although he has physically returned the article, the child still remains the legal owner.
The <i>Machaneh Ephraim</i> (<i>Hilchot Meshichah</i> 2) notes that according to Rabbinic law, a child can transfer property that he owns to another. Thus, the Rambam's statements seem to imply that any of the four species that are acquired only according to Rabbinic law may not be used for this mitzvah.
A very practical point can be derived from this concept. According to Torah law, property that is purchased changes ownership only after it has been paid for. The completion of a transaction when the property are taken by the purchaser (<i>meshichah</i>) is a Rabbinic institution. Accordingly, if a person purchased a lulav and etrog on the condition that he pay for it after the holiday - even though the seller willingly consented - the purchaser has only acquired the lulav and etrog according to Rabbinic law. Thus, based on this halachah, he would not be able to use it for the mitzvah.

</i> unless his colleague gives him his portion as a present<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is the case mentioned in <i>Bava Batra</i> (ibid.), from which the above principle is derived. In such an instance, the estate is considered to be the mutual property of all the brothers concerned.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The principles mentioned in the previous halachah regarding giving a lulav as a present also apply to giving a share of it as a present.
The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> mentions a very frequent application of this concept: a lulav and etrog purchased by a synagogue for the use of all of its members. He quotes the Rashba, who explains that since the etrog was purchased with the intent that it be used by each member of that community, implicit in their agreement is that, on the first day, it will belong to each individual entirely at the time he uses it to fulfill the mitzvah.
The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 648:7) quotes this statement as halachah. However, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 648:10 raises questions concerning it and suggests that each member of the community should grant his colleague his share as a present.
</i>.<br>Should brothers purchase etrogim from the funds [of their father's] estate, which they have not divided yet: If one of them takes an etrog with the intent of fulfilling his obligation, [the following rules apply:] If he could eat it without the other brothers objecting<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> it is considered to be his own. Hence,...
</i>, he has fulfilled his obligation. If they would object<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and require that an equal division of the property be made before it was used, he cannot be considered to be the full owner of the etrog. Hence,...
</i>, he does not fulfill his obligation until they give him their share [in the etrog] as a present.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
The above principles apply only when the funds of the estate were used to purchase a number of etrogim. Since many fruits of the same species were purchased with the money from the estate, it is possible that the other brothers will not object to one brother's taking an etrog for his own use. However, if the money of the estate was used to buy a number of different species of fruit - e.g.,...
</i><br>If one brother bought an etrog and another a quince, or together they bought an etrog, a pomegranate, and a quince from the funds [of their father's] estate, which they have not divided yet<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> we assume that the brothers would desire to have the property formally divided before using it. Hence, they are all considered to be mutual owners of the fruit. Thus,...
</i>, one cannot fulfill one's obligation with the etrog until the others give him their share [in it] as a present, even though they would not object to his [use of it].<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.12","Even though it is a mitzvah to rejoice on all the festivals<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as Deuteronomy 16:14 teaches: ""And you shall rejoice on your festivals."" Though that verse is mentioned with regard to Sukkot, Deuteronomy 16:11 states with regard to Shavuot: ""and you shall rejoice before God,"" and <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 4b explains that an analogy is established to include Pesach as well.
</i>, there was an additional celebration in the Temple on the festival of Sukkot<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's words present a question: The Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 5:1) refers to this celebration as <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i>, connecting it with the drawing of water for the water libation. (See <i>Hilchot T'midim Umusafim</i> 10:6-10.) Indeed, the Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 50b; see also the Rambam's commentary on the above-mentioned Mishnah) emphasizes that connection, quoting Isaiah 12:3: ""And you shall draw water with happiness."" However, here, the Rambam makes no mention of that water at all!
We are forced to say that the Rambam views the verse from Isaiah as a mere <i>asmachtah</i> (an allusion from the Bible with which our Sages connected a verse to an independent concept) and that the celebration came about because of the unique nature of the Sukkot festival. Though this celebration was associated with the water libation, the latter is not the source for the practice. Indeed, the choice of the name <i>Simchat Beit HaSho'evah</i> (the celebration of the house of drawing the water), and not <i>Simchat Hasho'evah</i> (the celebration of the drawing of the water) allows for such an interpretation. (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XVII).
</i>, as [Leviticus 23:40] commands: ""And you shall rejoice<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
</i> before God, your Lord<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., in the Temple
</i>, for seven days<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Although this verse is used to derive the requirement of taking the lulav in Jerusalem for each of the seven days of the festival (Chapter 7, Halachah 13), its simple meaning remains.
Nevertheless, this charge is not considered to be an independent commandment, but rather an extension (and an intensification) of the mitzvah of celebrating on the festivals. Thus, in <i>Sefer Hamitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 54), the Rambam describes that mitzvah and explains that it includes ""to celebrate with musical instruments and to dance in the Temple....This is <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i>.""
This explanation resolves another question: <i>Mo'ed Kattan</i> 8b teaches that one celebration should not be interposed upon another. For this reason, weddings are not held during the festivals so that the wedding celebrations should not clash with those of the festival.
Thus, were one to consider the celebration of <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i> as associated with the water offering, one might ask why the Sages instituted such a celebration which might appear to overshadow the celebration of the festival itself. However, the above explanation resolves this difficulty as well, for as stated above, the <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i> celebration is an extension of the festival celebrations and not an independent matter. (See <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, ibid.)
</i>.""<br>What was done? On the eve of the first day of the festival<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Two reasons are given why the courtyard was not set up during the festival itself:
a) It involved construction, which is forbidden on Chol Hamo'ed (<i>Knesset Hagedolah</i>)
b) Preparing the courtyard before the festival would allow the celebrations to begin immediately after the departure of the festival (<i>Kinat Eliyahu</i>).
</i>, they would set up a place in the Temple<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in the open courtyard before the entrance to the Temple courtyard proper. This was called <i>Ezrat Nashim</i> - the women's courtyard - because in contrast to the Temple courtyard, women were allowed to enter the <i>Ezrat Nashim</i> even when they were not offering sacrifices. The Rambam describes the <i>Ezrat Nashim</i> in <i>Hilchot Beit Habechirah</i> 5:7.
</i> where women [could watch] from above, and men from below, so they would not intermingle with each other<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Originally, the men and the women would stand in separate sections on the same level. However, the Sages feared that, particularly during a time of celebration, such closeness might lead to frivolous interaction between the sexes, and decided to have a balcony constructed for the women (<i>Sukkah</i> 51b).
</i>.<br>The celebration would begin on the night after the first day of the festival<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since, as explained in the following halachah, the celebration was not held on the first night of the festival.

There were golden candelabras....There was not a courtyard in Jerusalem that was not illuminated with the light of <i>Beit Hasho'evah</i>.

</i>.<br>This celebration does not supersede either the Sabbath or the festival [prohibitions]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since, as explained above, the celebration involved musical instruments, it would not be held on the first night of the festival (or on the Sabbath), when playing such instruments is forbidden (<i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 23:4).
The celebration is an extension of a Torah commandment, while the above prohibition is only Rabbinic in nature. Furthermore, it was held in the Temple, where Rabbinic prohibitions of this nature were usually suspended (אין שבות במקדש, <i>Pesachim</i> 65a). Nevertheless, since there is no specific Torah obligation to celebrate in this manner, the celebrations were suspended because of the Rabbinic prohibition (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, ibid.).

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.14","It is a great mitzvah to maximize this celebration<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for the experience of genuine Torah happiness is a fundamental and necessary element of our service of God, as explained in the following halachah.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 8.15","The happiness with which a person should rejoice in the fulfillment of the mitzvot and the love of God who commanded them is a great service<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> By mentioning this concept at the conclusion - but as part - of the these halachot, the Rambam emphasizes how the celebration of the festivals is not just an isolated experience, but rather is intended to influence the totality of our service of God. The rejoicing of the festival of Sukkot enables us to appreciate true happiness in all aspects of our Torah service.
</i>. Whoever holds himself back from this rejoicing is worthy of retribution, as [Deuteronomy 28:47] states: ""...because you did not serve God, your Lord, with happiness and a glad heart<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This verse comes after the full description of the curses and retribution which God will visit upon the Jewish people for their sins. From the Rambam's statements, it appears that it is the lack of happiness in the service of God, and not the sins themselves, which brought about this punishment.
The <i>Ari</i>, Rabbi Yitzchak Luria, explains that even though the punishment comes for the sins, had the Jewish people served God with true joy and happiness, that happiness would have caused Him to overlook those transgressions, regardless of how serious they were. In contrast, a lack of happiness in the performance of the mitzvot demonstrates a deficiency in the person's awareness of the connection to God established thereby.
</i>.""<br>Whoever holds himself proud, giving himself honor, and acts haughtily in such situations is a sinner and a fool<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for he is concerned with himself, rather than with God.

</i>.""<br>[In contrast,] anyone who lowers himself and thinks lightly of his person in these situations<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> transcending his self-consciousness and committing himself to God totally, without any restrictions

</i>. Thus, David, King of Israel<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The mention of David's position further emphasizes the concept explained. Alternatively, a king has a connection to each of his subjects. Thus, mentioning the example of the king of Israel emphasizes how each Jew has a potential to achieve this rung of service.
</i>, declared [II Samuel 6:22]: ""I will hold myself even more lightly esteemed than this and be humble in my eyes,"" because there is no greatness or honor other than celebrating before God, as [II Samuel 6:16] states: ""King David was dancing wildly and whistling before God<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> When Michal, Saul's daughter, witnessed David's recklessness and total lack of inhibitions, she reproved him for conduct unbefitting a king. David answered her sharply, explaining that it is precisely this ability to give oneself totally over to Godliness which characterizes a Jewish monarch and makes him fit to lead the people in the service of God.
Though the Rambam stresses how an approach of humility and happiness befits people of honor - as is obvious from the nature of the Sages' celebration of <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i> - these ideas also apply to every Jew. When an individual is conscious of God's constant presence, he will naturally be infused with these two emotions. He will feel his own smallness in God's presence, yet he will also feel real joy at the knowledge that God is with him at every moment, and that through his service of Torah and mitzvot, he can develop a greater connection with Him.
May our service of God with joy hasten the time when ""crowned with eternal joy"" (Isaiah 35:10 , we will be able to ""rejoice before God, your Lord, for seven days,"" in the Messianic Temple. May we merit it, speedily, in our days.

Fasts 3.3,"If these [fasts] pass without [their prayers] being answered<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> By choosing this wording (quoted from <i>Ta'anit</i> 1:6), the Rambam teaches us a lesson in the service of God. It could have said, ""If these fasts pass without rain having descended."" The Rambam and the Mishnah, however, want to emphasize that the ultimate reason why rain descends or does not descend is not dependent on natural factors, but rather on God's mercies.
</i>, the court should decree an additional three communal fasts<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> of a more severe nature.
There are some texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> that read ""[starting on] a Monday, [and continuing on] the [following] Thursday, and the [following] Monday,"" and other texts read ""[starting on] Thursday, [and continuing on] the [following] Monday, and the [following] Thursday.""
The difference between these two versions depends on the difference of opinion mentioned in the commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 5, concerning the question: Should the second series of fasts begin on a Thursday or not?
</i>. On these fasts, we eat and drink while it is still day [on the day before the fast], as on the fast of Yom Kippur<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> I.e., as on Yom Kippur, we are forbidden to eat and drink after sunset. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 575:2, however, explains that unlike Yom Kippur (<i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Esor</i> 1:6), there is no obligation to begin the fast before sunset.
</i>.<br>The men serving in the [weekly] priestly watch should fast for part of the day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> because these fasts are more severe and also because, at the beginning of the day, it was less likely that they be called to assist in the Temple service
</i>, but should not complete the fast<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> lest they become weak and be unable to serve in the Temple when called.
</i>. The men of the <i>beit av</i> - those individuals who are involved in the Temple service that day - should not fast at all.<br>O<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> concluded his meal
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for the above reason.
</i>n a fast for which we are required to cease eating while it is still day, once a person has ceased eating and decided not to eat any more<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for this is considered as if he accepted the fast upon himself
</i>, he may not change his mind and eat, even though there is still time during the day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Ramban and the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> differ with the Rambam on this point and maintain that as long as one has not made an explicit statement to the fact that one has accepted the fast, one is allowed to change one's mind and eat. The rationale for their ruling is that, as explained above, on these fasts, in contrast to Yom Kippur, there is no obligation to begin the fast before sunset.
With regard to the laws of Tish'ah B'Av - and from there we can extrapolate to the instance at hand - the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 553:1) accepts the Ramban's ruling. The <i>Mishneh Berurah</i> 553:2, however, states that a mental resolve to accept the fast is also sufficient to cause one to be forbidden to eat further.
</i>."
Fasts 3.4,"On these three fasts, all people are forbidden<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As the Rambam mentions in Chapter 1, Halachah 4, all the fasts mentioned in this text are Rabbinic in origin. The only fast mentioned in the Torah is Yom Kippur. Accordingly, when the Sages instituted communal fasts, they used Yom Kippur as a paradigm. Therefore, just as it is forbidden to perform work, wash, anoint oneself, engage in sexual relations, or wear shoes on that holy day, these activities were also forbidden on other fast days.
Nevertheless, on fast days other than Yom Kippur, certain leniencies were instituted, and these restrictions were not enforced to the same degree as on Yom Kippur.
</i> to perform work during the day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Ta'anit</i> 12b brings support for this concept from the exegesis of Joel 2:15: ""Sanctify the fast day; call an assembly, and collect the elders."" The word for ""assembly,"" עצרה, resembles the Biblical name for the holiday of Shavuot, עצרת. Just as it is forbidden to work on Shavuot, so too, it is forbidden to work on a fast day.
</i>, but they are permitted during the [previous] night<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Ta'anit, ibid.</i>, continues using exegesis to show that, in contrast to Shavuot, working on the night of a fast day is permitted.
</i>. It is forbidden for a person to wash his entire body in hot water<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> but one may wash one's body with cold water (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 575:3).
</i>, but one may wash one's face, hands, and feet<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> even in hot water (<i>loc. cit.</i>).
</i>. For this reason, the bathhouses are closed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> to ensure that this prohibition is observed.
</i>.<br>It is forbidden to anoint oneself<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for the sake of pleasure.
</i>. One may, however, do so to remove filth<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> or for medicinal reasons (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 575:7).
</i>. Sexual relations are forbidden<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This applies even on the night of a woman's ritual immersion (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 575:8).
</i>, as is wearing shoes in a city. One may, however, wear shoes on a journey<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for making a journey without proper shoes is extremely uncomfortable.
</i>. We pray in the synagogues<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As opposed to the following sequence of fasts, whose prayer services are held in the streets of the city, as explained in Chapter 4.
</i>, cry out [to God], and make supplications as is customary on all fasts<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The trumpets, however, are not sounded.
</i>."
Fasts 3.7,"There are additional dimensions [of severity] to these [fasts]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The first four points mentioned in this halachah are described at length in Chapter 4.
</i>: it is on these alone that we sound the trumpets<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as required in a time of distress (Chapter 1, Halachah 1). In Chapter 4, Halachot 14-17, the manner in which the trumpets are sounded is explained.
</i>, pray in the street of the city<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Chapter 4, Halachah 1
</i>, call on an elder to admonish the people [and motivate] them to repent from their [evil] ways<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Chapter 4, Halachah 2
</i>, add six blessings in the morning<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Chapter 4, Halachot 7-14
</i> and afternoon prayers<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Although the Talmud does not mention that these six blessings were added in both prayer services, were this not to be the case, it would have been proper to state that they were added only in the morning service (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).
</i> - thus, we recite twenty-four blessings<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> More precisely 25. The Rambam is quoting the Mishnah (<i>Ta'anit</i> 2:2), which refers to the era before the nineteenth blessing was added to the daily <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. (See <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 2:1.)
</i>, and close the stores<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> with the leniencies to be mentioned. The stores are closed to intensify the people's consciousness of the fast (Rashi, <i>Ta'anit</i> 14b).
</i>.<br>On Mondays, the doors of the stores<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> From the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 575:4), the Ramah, and other commentaries, it appears that the leniencies mentioned here refer only to stores that sell food, but not those that carry other merchandise.
</i> are left slightly ajar towards evening<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> but they should not be opened completely
</i> and they may be opened [for business]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> to allow people to purchase food for the evening meal. There are, however, certain restrictions; for example, the products in the store may not be taken out to the store's display area (Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Ta'anit</i> 1:6).
</i>. On Thursdays, [the stores] may be opened the entire day [to allow people to purchase food] in honor of the Sabbath<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The following restriction should be adhered to:
</i>. If a store has two entrances, one entrance should be opened and the other closed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> From the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), it appears that this restriction applies on Mondays as well as on Thursdays.
</i>. If the store has a display area<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> a bench for the storekeeper and/or customers to sit and a place for merchandise to be placed
</i> in front of it, it may be opened in the normal manner on a Thursday without concern [for the above restriction]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rashi, <i>Ta'anit</i> 14b, explains that the display area prevents the entrances to the store from being seen. Hence, there is no difficulty in leaving them both open.
</i>."
Fasts 3.8,"If these [fasts] pass without [their prayers] being answered<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> no other communal fasts are ordained, as explained in the following halachah. The fact that no other fasts are called does not mean that the community may return to their ordinary pattern of conduct. Quite the contrary: the period is regarded as one of Divine disfavor. Hence,
</i>, we should minimize our commercial activity<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The restrictions that follow were instituted to reduce joy. In contrast, this restriction appears to include all commercial activity, even that which is not directed associated with happiness (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>). Seemingly, the intent is that since the time is not favorable, it is unwise to invest money and effort in commercial endeavors (<i>Kinat Eliyahu</i>).
There are, however, authorities who maintain that here also, the restriction involves only commercial activity associated with joy - e.g., preparing for a child's wedding or purchasing valuable articles, but ordinary business activities are permitted (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 575:18).
</i>, construction projects associated with joy - e.g., those involving decorative patterns on the ceilings and walls<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Ta'anit</i> 1:7), the Rambam states that this refers to ornate buildings erected by the wealthy. There is, however, no restriction on ordinary building projects necessary for one's everyday purposes.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 575:7) describes the prohibition as applying to ""buildings of joy."" The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 575:18 (based on the <i>Tur</i>) explains that this refers to all buildings that are unnecessary and are constructed for beauty and comfort.
</i>, plantings<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In this instance, the differences between Hebrew and English have caused our translation to be non-literal. In Hebrew, the word נטיעה refers to both planting trees and setting up tents.
</i> associated with joy - e.g., that of myrtle trees<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam explains that this refers to spice and flower gardens planted for pleasure. One may, however, plant orchards for the purpose of growing fruit. There are no restrictions on such activity.
</i>, and the erection of tents<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This also refers to tents set up for festive purposes; there is no restriction against pitching tents for ordinary purposes.
</i>.<br>We also minimize betrothals and marriages<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 575) interprets this to mean that a person who has fulfilled the mitzvah of fathering children should not become betrothed or marry at all.
</i>, unless one has not fulfilled the mitzvah of being fruitful and multiplying<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This involves fathering a son and a daughter. (See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 15:4.)
</i>. Whoever has fulfilled this mitzvah is forbidden to engage in sexual relations in a year of famine<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Ta'anit</i> 11a derives this concept from Genesis 41:50, which states that Joseph's children were born before the famine. One can infer that during the famine he did not engage in relations.
This restriction was instituted because it is proper to reduce our indulgence in pleasure in a time of communal distress.
</i>.<br>We also reduce the exchange of greetings, and the Torah sages should not exchange greetings at all<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Needless to say, frivolity and jests are also forbidden.
</i>. Rather, [they should conduct themselves as people] who have been rebuffed and ostracized by God<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> A person under a ban of ostracism is forbidden to greet others or to return greetings. Hence the above prohibition.
<i>Ta'anit</i> 14b states that it is proper to cover one's head with a cloak as mourners do. Nevertheless, neither the Rambam nor the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> quotes this obligation (perhaps because even mourners did not generally observe this custom after the Talmudic era).
</i>. When a common person greets them, they may return the greeting<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> lest the person become offended (Rashi, <i>Ta'anit</i> 14b); but when doing so, they should respond
</i> in a weak and concerned tone<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> so that he will appreciate that the greeting was not in place.
</i>."
Fasts 3.9,"The Torah scholars alone continue to fast<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The commentaries do not mention whether it is preferable that all the students of the Torah join in these fasts, as was stated in Halachah 1. One might presume, however, that they should. Indeed, the entire community should have been required to observe these fasts, and it is only because the Rabbis thought that this would be too difficult for them that they were released from this obligation.
</i>, [beginning on the next] Monday, [and continuing on the following] Thursday and Monday<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned in the commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 5, and in Halachah 3 of this chapter, there are opinions that maintain that if a cycle of fasts ends on Monday - as does the cycle of the seven communal fasts - the next cycle of fasts may be started on the Thursday of that week. Other opinions - and these are followed by the standard published text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> - maintain that all cycles of fasts begin on Monday. Hence, if a cycle of fasts ends on Monday, the next cycle begins on the following Monday.
This difference of opinion involves much more than one day, for these fasts are decreed in series of three. Thus, according to the opinion followed by the standard texts, the scholars would fast three days in every two weeks for the duration of the period. The other view, in contrast, would require them to fast on every Monday and Thursday.
</i> [in this manner] until the month of Nisan<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Ta'anit</i> 1:7 states that these fasts should continue ""until Nisan passes."" In the Jerusalem Talmud's explanation of this Mishnah, it is explained that this refers to Nisan
</i> - as determined in relation to the spring season<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> which always begins in the month of Nisan. In <i>Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh</i> 9:3, the Rambam defines the beginning of spring as the time the sun enters the zodiac constellation of the goat. This is the beginning of April according to the secular calendar.
</i> - passes. This is not, however, required of the community. No more than these thirteen communal fasts are decreed because of a lack of rainfall<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Ta'anit</i> 14b considered thirteen fasts as the maximum a community should be required to undertake for this reason. More fasts would be considered an excessive burden. (Significantly, according to Kabbalah, the number thirteen is identified with God's attributes of mercy.)
As mentioned in the commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 4, this limit applies only regarding fasts decreed because of a lack of rain. When communal fasts are decreed because of other distressing circumstances, we should continue fasting until our prayers are answered.
</i>.<br>When these individuals fast until Nisan passes, they are allowed to eat at night<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., the fast begins at dawn. See Chapter 1, Halachah 8.
</i> and are allowed to perform work, to wash, to anoint themselves, to engage in sexual relations, and to wear shoes as on other fast days<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> These restrictions apply only on Yom Kippur, Tish'ah B'Av, and the latter ten fasts decreed because of a lack of rain.
</i>. They do not fast on Rashei Chodashim, nor on Purim<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 9, an individual should not fast on these days. Although many individuals may participate in these fasts, they are still deemed individual - and not communal - fasts.
</i>.<br>After the month of Nisan, as determined in relation to the spring season, passes - i.e<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> one month after the spring season begins
</i>., when the sun enters the sign<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., the zodiac constellation
</i> of the bull<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is at the beginning of the secular month of May.
</i> - they should cease fasting. Since no rain has descended from the beginning of the year, rain in this season would be a sign of a curse<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since the land has already become parched, the rain will be of no benefit. For God to display His beneficence at such a time, after the time had passed when the rain could have helped, is a further sign of Divine disfavor (Rav Ovadiah of Bertinoro).
</i>."
Human Dispositions 6.1,"It is natural for a man's character and actions<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As the Rambam emphasizes in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive mitzvah 8), man's ethical makeup is a combination of character and action.
</i> to be influenced by his friends and associates and for him to follow the local norms of behavior<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> People are, by nature, social beings and there is a constant give and take between the individual and the people with whom he associates (See Guide To the Perplexed, Vol. I, Chapter 31).
</i>. Therefore<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This sociological truism implies the following course of action.
</i>, he should associate with the righteous and be constantly in the company of the wise<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Avot</i> 1:4 advises: ""Let your house be a meeting place for the wise."" See the following halachah.
</i>, so as to learn from their deeds<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In Halachah 2, the Rambam states that it is a mitzvah to associate with the righteous, while here he describes the need for such association as morally compelling. Note our commentary to that halachah.
</i>. Conversely, he should keep away from the wicked who walk in darkness, so as not to learn from their deeds<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Avot</i> 1:7 states: ""Stay away from a bad neighbor and do not become a friend of the wicked."" (See also the Rambam's commentary to that Mishnah.)
</i>.<br>This is [implied by] Solomon's statement (Proverbs 13:20 : ""He who walks with the wise will become wise<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezar</i> (Chapter 25) explains this verse with an analogy of a person who spends time in a perfumery. Some of the pleasant fragrance attaches itself to him, even though he does not purchase anything.
</i>, while one who associates with fools will suffer<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezar</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) continues the analogy: Conversely, when a person spends time in a tannery, the unpleasant odor of the tannery imparts a foul smell even though he did not take anything from there.
</i>."" Similarly, [Psalms 1:1] states: ""Happy is the man who has not followed the advice of the wicked<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The verse from Proverbs supports the previously stated concept that a person is influenced by his environment. The verse from Psalms introduces the concept which follows; that bad company should be avoided.
A person who lives in a place where the norms of behavior are evil and the inhabitants do not follow the straight path should move to a place where the people are righteous - <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XXIII, states that this restriction does not apply to a person who settles in a community for the expressed purpose of spreading Torah. He need not worry about being influenced by his surroundings, because, to borrow a concept from <i>Yoreh De'ah</i>, Chapter 69, out of context, ""one who is preoccupied with giving will not receive.""
</i>.""<br>A person who lives in a place where the norms of behavior are evil and the inhabitants do not follow the straight path should move to a place where the people are righteous and follow the ways of the good<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See the commentary to Chapter 1, Halachah 4.
In <i>Iggeret HaShmad</i>, the Rambam states that even when the difference between the two is relative, ""a person who fears God is obligated to move from a country whose norms are not so proper to a good country.""
If all the places with which he is familiar and of which he hears reports follow improper paths, as in our times, - One can only guess what the Rambam would say about our present society.
</i>.<br>If all the places with which he is familiar and of which he hears reports follow improper paths, as in our times, or if he is unable to move to a place where the patterns of behavior are proper, because of [the presence of] bands of raiding troops, or for health reasons<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam apparently does not suggest risking one's life to make such a move. However, note the passage from <i>Iggeret HaShmad</i> quoted below.
</i>, he should remain alone in seclusion<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The obligation to find a proper society is not offered simply as a suggestion. The Rambam makes it a firm directive, incumbent upon us even if great difficulty must be endured to ensure that the improper society be avoided.
</i> as [Eichah 3:28] states: ""Let him sit alone and be silent.""<br><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
</i>If they are wicked and sinful and do not allow him to reside there unless he mingle with them and follow their evil behavior, he should go out to caves, thickets<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This phrase is borrowed out of context, as is frequently the Rambam's practice, from I Samuel 13:6: ""and the people hid in the caves and crannies.""
and deserts [rather than] follow the paths of sinners - In <i>Iggeret HaShmad</i>, the Rambam also discusses this question, albeit in connection with more extreme circumstances, addressing himself to people who live in countries whose governments do not allow them to follow Torah and mitzvot:
The advice which I give myself... my friends, and all those who seek counsel from me is to leave those places and go to a place where he can establish his faith and follow the Torah without interference or fear...<br>
He should try to do this even if it involves danger... It has already been expressed by the prophets that whoever dwells among the nonbelievers becomes like them as implied by the statements of King David of blessed memory (I Samuel 26:19 : ""You have driven me away from dwelling in the heritage of God, telling me, 'Go serve other gods;' i.e., [King David] equated his living among the gentiles with idol worship.
</i>, and deserts [rather than] follow the paths of sinners as [Jeremiah 9:1] states: ""Who will give me a lodging place for wayfarers, in the desert<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The conclusion of this verse: ""I will leave my people and go from them for they are all adulterers, a faithless band,"" demonstrates that the Rambam was not merely borrowing Biblical phraseology, but rather, quoting a verse that addresses itself specifically to the problem of living within a corrupt society.

Human Dispositions 6.2,"It is a positive commandment<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive mitzvah 6) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 434) include this as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.
In Halachah 1, the Rambam described the association with the wise as a moral imperative and, here, he states that it is a Torah commandment. We saw a similar pattern in Chapter 1. First, he outlined his theory of the middle path of behavior as the optimal moral position. Only afterwards, did he equate it with the commandment to ""walk in His ways.""
This approach demonstrates that the Torah does not impose a Divine Will upon man which he cannot grasp or understand. Rather, it reflects rules and principles that can be conceived by human thought and explained in terms of human nature. Thus, the workings of the Halachah can be seen as having been instituted as an organic part of the makeup of the world at large and man in particular. (See the Guide to the Perplexed, Vol. III, Chapter 48.)
</i> to cleave unto the wise and their disciples in order to learn from their deeds<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as explained in the previous halachah.
</i> as [Deuteronomy 10:20] states: ""and you will cling to Him.""<br><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
</i>Our Sages<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Ketubot</i> 111b, <i>Sifri</i>, Deuteronomy 11:22.
</i> [questioned the nature of this command for] is it possible for man to cling to the Divine Presence?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since He transcends the reaches of our emotions and intellect, the commandment cannot be interpreted literally.
</i> They [resolved the difficulty,] explaining this commandment to mean: Cleave unto the wise and their disciples<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This interpretation does not contradict the simple meaning of the verse. Since the Sages fulfill the command ""Know God in all your ways"" (See Chapter 3, Halachah 3), they are in constant connection with Him. Hence, a person can also establish a bond with his Creator by ""clinging"" to them. See also <i>Tanya</i>, Chapter 2.
</i>.<br>Therefore<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., implied by ""cleaving"" is that
</i>, one should try to marry the daughter of a Torah Sage and marry his daughter to a Torah Sage<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Pesachim</i> 49a states: ""At all times, a man should sell all his possessions [in order to] marry a daughter of a wise man and marry off his daughter to a wise man.""
</i>, eat and drink with Sages<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 64a states: ""Anyone who partakes of a meal at which a Torah Sage is present is considered like one who has benefited from the radiance of the Divine Presence.""
</i>, do business on behalf of Sages<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., the Torah Sage may be a silent partner who puts up a share of the capital in a partnership and the other person takes care of the actual buying and selling.
The Rambam harshly criticizes individuals who try to derive material benefit from their Torah knowledge (See <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 3:10-11). Therefore, though <i>Ketubot</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the source for these statements, also mentions ""granting a Sage benefit from one's possessions,"" the Rambam omits this clause. Nevertheless, he does allow one to do business on behalf of a Sage as described above. See also <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 6:10.
</i>, and associate with them in all possible ways as [Deuteronomy 11:22] states: ""to cling to Him.""<br><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
</i>Similarly, our Sages<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Avot</i> 1:4
</i> have directed [us], saying: ""Sit in the dust of their feet and drink in their words thirstily.""<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
</i>"
Human Dispositions 6.3,"Each man is commanded to love each and every one of Israel as himself<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his commentary on the Torah, the Ramban questions how one can possibly have the same degree of love for another person as one has for himself. However, since all Jews share the same Godly essence, when one relates to that essence, there is really no difference between loving another person and oneself (<i>Tanya</i>, <i>ibid.</i>).
</i> as [Leviticus 19:18] states: ""Love your neighbor as yourself<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The question often raised in connection with this mitzvah is: How can one command feeling? Therefore, certain commentaries have stated that the mitzvah merely requires us to perform deeds which would normally be motivated by feelings of love. However, in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (<i>Shoresh</i> 9), the Rambam specifically states that this mitzvah involves our emotions. Therefore, it must be interpreted to mean that we are commanded to bring ourselves to a state of mind that will inspire feelings of love.
Though the mitzvah involves our feelings, it also requires a specific course of behavior as the Rambam continues:
Therefore, - i.e., the following are the applications of this mitzvah in the ethical realm. However, since ""'Love your neighbor as yourself' is a great general principle in the Torah"" (<i>Sifra</i>, Leviticus 19:18 , there are also applications of this principle in many other spheres.
Thus, <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 14:1 states:
It is a positive mitzvah ordained by the Rabbis to visit the sick, comfort mourners, participate in a funeral or a wedding, accompany guests, arrange for all the needs of burial..., and to bring joy to a bride and a groom and assist them with all their needs.<br>
These are deeds of kindness performed with one's person for which there is no measure.<br>
Although these are Rabbinic commands, they are included in [the commandment, ""Love your neighbor as yourself,"" [which implies that] all the things that you would like others to do for you, you should do for your brother in Torah and mitzvot.
The Rambam also mentions this commandment in connection with choosing a bride (<i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 3:19), ransoming captives (<i>Hilchot Matnot Ani'im</i> 8:10), and even determining the proper manner of execution (<i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 15:1).

In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) the Rambam also emphasizes that the sacrifices a convert made in coming to Judaism are the reason ""God has offered him additional love and created an additional mitzvah for him.""
A number of the Rambam's responsa are also dedicated to strengthening the spirits of converts. He wrote to a convert named Ovadiah, that although the Jews trace their lineage to Abraham, the converts' connection to Judaism is dependent on God, Himself and is, therefore, more praiseworthy. Similarly, he praises another convert for ""leaving his father and homeland...pursuing God... and reaching such heights.""

Human Dispositions 6.6,"When one person wrongs another, the latter should not remain silent and despise him<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Halachah 9.

Nevertheless, Avshalom is criticized for not making his ill feelings known and failing to try to resolve his differences with Amnon peacefully.
The choice of this example appears to be the Rambam's own for the commentaries have not cited any sources which he quotes. Perhaps the Rambam cites this instance to demonstrate the negative effects of such hatred. Ultimately, Avshalom slew Amnon, triggering a series of unfortunate events which culminated in a bitter civil war and his own death.
Rather, he is commanded - <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive mitzvah 205) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 239) include this as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. This commandment has two dimensions:<br>
a) to bring the complaints one has against a colleague into the open as stated in this halachah; b) to rebuke a sinner as stated in the following halachah.
</i>.""<br>Rather, he is commanded to make the matter known and ask him: ""Why did you do this to me?"", ""Why did you wrong me regarding that matter?"" as [Leviticus 19:17] states: ""You shall surely admonish your colleague<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Leviticus 19:17-18 states:
(17) Do not hate your brother in your heart. You must surely admonish your neighbor and not bear a sin because of him. (18) Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against the children of your people. Love your neighbor as yourself.
Each of the clauses in these two verses is halachically significant. The first verse informs us that hatred of a fellow Jew is prohibited (Halachah 5). Then, it explains how one should respond if negative feelings towards a colleague arise (Halachah 6, here). Afterwards, it teaches that one's negative feelings must be expressed in a manner that does not embarrass one's fellow Jew (Halachah 8). Thus, the verse can be rendered: Do not bear hate in your heart, instead, inform your fellow Jew of your complaint, but do so in a manner that is not sinful. (Note the Ramban's commentary on the verse.)
The second verse teaches that vengeance or bearing a grudge is forbidden (Chapter 7, Halachot 7-8) and then, concludes with a positive statement obligating us to love our fellow Jew (Halachah 3).
</i>.""<br>If, afterwards, [the person who committed the wrong] asks [his colleague] to forgive him, he must do so<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See <i>Yoma</i> 87a which gives several examples of Sages who went out of their way to create circumstances that would allow a person who had wronged them to ask for forgiveness.

It is forbidden for a person to be cruel and refuse to be appeased. Instead, he should be easily pacified and difficult to anger. When the person who wronged him asks for forgiveness, he should forgive him with a full heart...<br>
This is the path of the seed of Israel... In contrast, the insensitive gentiles..., their wrath is preserved forever. Similarly, because the Gibeonites did not forgive... [II Samuel 21:2] describes them as follows: ""The Gibeonites were not among the children of Israel.""

The previous halachah dealt with this concept in terms of our interpersonal relationships. Our halachah deals with this concept within the context of a person's relationship with God. <i>Pesachim</i> 113a teaches we must hate a sinner. As a preventive measure, the Torah offers us an alternative, admonishing him, which hopefully will cause him to correct his behavior and thus, do away with the need for such hatred (<i>Sefer Yeraim</i>).
A person who rebukes a colleague - whether because of a [wrong committed] against him - as mentioned in the previous halachach

</i> - should rebuke him privately<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> to prevent the person being rebuked from becoming embarrassed. However, note the latter portion of the following Halachah.
The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (608:3) states that we are only required to administer a rebuke privately for a sin committed in private. If a person sees a colleague commit a sin in public, he should immediately rebuke him to prevent <i>chillul HaShem</i>.
</i>. He should speak to him patiently and gently<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for we are all naturally defensive when our actions are being criticized. We must demonstrate more consideration for a fellow Jew's feelings if we wish our statements to be effective.
The <i>Sifri</i> derives the need for privacy and gentleness from the manner in which God rebuked Miriam and Aharon for speaking against Moses.
</i>, informing him that he is only making these statements for his colleague's own welfare<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and has no intention of causing him harm, but wishes, instead,

</i>, he should rebuke him a second and third time<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam quotes the <i>Sifra</i> which mentions repeating a rebuke four or five times. <i>Bava Metzia</i> 31b states one must rebuke a colleague even one hundred times.
</i>. Indeed, one is obligated to rebuke a colleague who does wrong until the latter strikes him<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Arachin</i> 16b mentions a second limit, when the transgressor curses the one who rebukes him. The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 608:2) accepts this view as halachah. Nevertheless, in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam specifically writes: ""even if one is cursed or belittled, he should not slacken or cease admonishing until he hits him.""
The Ramah also mentions that the obligation to rebuke a colleague an unlimited number of times only applies when the rebuke is being given to a single individual. When one is admonishing many people for transgressing together, a single rebuke is sufficient.
</i> and tells him: ""I will not listen<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam (<i>Hilchot Shivitat Esor</i> 1:7) states:

It is better to allow them to remain unaware [of this transgression than risk] their willful violation of it.<br>
The same applies concerning similar cases.
Commenting on this law, the Ramah (<i>ibid.</i>) mentions that a person should not rebuke a colleague for the inadvertent transgression of a Torah law if he knows that the transgressor will not listen. However, this only applies regarding instances like the obligation to add to the Yom Kippur fast which are not explicitly mentioned in the Torah.

<b>for he had the opportunity to rebuke the [sinners] -</b> and perhaps, had he rebuked them, the sin would not have been committed.

The <i>Avodat HaMelech</i> states that when a person feels that a colleague wronged him, he should admonish the latter gently. If the person admonished does not respond, he may speak to him in harsher terms and even embarrass him in private. However, under no circumstances may he embarrass him publicly for his own personal reasons.

In his commentary to this mishnah, the Rambam states that, generally, when a person dies amidst suffering, his death atones for his sins and he is granted a share in the world to come. In this case, even the person's suffering and death does not bring about atonement. See also <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:14.
Therefore, a person should be careful not to embarrass a colleague - whether of great or lesser stature - Alternatively, ""whether an adult or a minor."" <i>Bava Kama</i> 86b relates that even minors and fools can suffer from public embarrassment.

Human Dispositions 6.10,"A person is obligated to show great care for orphans and widows because their spirits are very low and their feelings are depressed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> These people tend to be oversensitive and the smallest harshness or slight might cause them pain and thus, constitute a transgression of the prohibition mentioned below.

He placed his own money above and below theirs so that he would suffer any possible loss and not they. Similarly, many leniencies and provisions have been instituted within Torah law to protect the interests of orphans. For example, a person who collects a debt from an estate left to orphans must take an oath that the debt had not been repaid even though, had the debtor remained alive, the oath would not have been required.
See also <i>Hilchot Nachalot</i>, Chapter 11.

The commentaries have questioned why, in fact, the minimal punishment of lashes is never given. Though punishment is not given for a transgression that does not involve a deed as mentioned in Halachah 5, it is possible that a person will commit a deed that aggravates a widow or orphan. Why does he not receive lashes in such an instance?
The <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> states that since the nature of the prohibition is very subjective, the Torah does not specify any punishment. The <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> quotes an opinion which maintains that any prohibition that can be violated by speech or thought alone (as is possible in this case) is not liable for lashes even when it is transgressed with a deed. The <i>Avodat HaMelech</i> states that the reason one does not receive lashes is stated by the Rambam himself, namely:
</i>, the retribution one suffers for its [violation] is explicitly stated in the Torah (<i>ibid.</i> 22:23): ""I will display My anger and slay you with the sword<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and this punishment is more severe than lashes. Hence, the lesser punishment is not administered.

There is a covenant between them and He who spoke and created the world<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> When people lose a loved one, they often despair and feel that the world is run in a random and arbitrary manner. Perhaps the Rambam uses this term for God - ""He who spoke..."" - to stress how He is the One who brought the world into being and controls every facet of its existence.
</i> that whenever they cry out because they have been wronged, they will be answered as [<i>ibid.</i>:22] states: ""When they cry out to Me, I will surely hear their cry<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The use of a Biblical prooftext generally indicates a quote from a Talmudic or Midrashic source. However, though the concept the Rambam mentions is also alluded to in <i>Bava Kama</i> 93a, the exact expression he uses is not mentioned there.
This instance supports an opinion frequently expressed by certain commentaries, i.e., that the Rambam had at his disposal midrashic sources which are not available to us. Alternatively, we are forced to say the Rambam takes the liberty of developing Halachic interpretations of Biblical verses on his own. Scholars of the post-Talmudic period would rarely make such interpretations.
When does the above apply? When one causes them suffering for one's own purposes. However, it is permitted for a teacher to cause them suffering while teaching them Torah, or a craft, or in order to train them in proper behavior. - This point is mentioned explicitly in the <i>Mechilta</i> of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. The <i>Mechilta</i> which is most commonly quoted is that composed by Rabbi Yishmael. Many of the Rabbis who have devoted themselves to the study of the sources used by the Rambam note his partiality for the <i>Mechilta</i> of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his frequent use of it as a source.

Rav Kapach notes that manuscript copies of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> do not include the word שנאמר - ""as it states."" Accordingly, he maintains that the Rambam was merely borrowing the phrasing of a verse (as is his frequent custom), but not quoting it as a prooftext.

Thus, it is clear that one must deal with his spiritual obligations before fulfilling his physical needs.
Note Chapter 5, Halachah 2, where the Rambam states that one who is hungry or thirsty is considered sick and must eat or drink before prayer in order to pray with proper intention. For this reason, medicines also present no problem and may be taken before <i>Shacharit</i> (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 89:3).
The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (89:22) grants permission to drink tea or coffee before prayer, if this will help one's concentration during prayer. However,he suggests not putting sugar into the drink. The <i>Aruch Hashulchan</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 89:23) allows one to add sugar to tea and even suggests that adding milk is permissible.

Nevertheless, the Talmud explains that this prohibition only applies to going to a friend's house to greet him. Greeting him in the street is permitted.

Here, he states that even a snack is forbidden. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that eating a כביצה (the equivalent of an egg, 52 or 100 cubic centimeters, according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i> and the <i>Chazon Ish</i>, respectively) of fruit, or a כזית (an olive size, approximately 26 or 50 cubic centimeters, according to the same references cited) of bread constitutes <i>achilat ari’ai</i> which we have translated as a snack.

In his commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam states:
Even if the case is finished and the judges have heard the claims of the adversaries in the case, and have deliberated [and reached a verdict], and need only announce their final decision, the judge should not sit to render this decision close to the time of <i>Minchah</i>, lest he see the case in a different light and be required to start again, or the adversaries restate their claims and the matters drag on until the time [for <i>Minchah</i>] passes.
</i>.<br>Similarly, one should not sit in a barber's chair, even for a regular haircut<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as opposed to the especially intricate haircut given the High Priest, called the haircut of ""ben Elasa"" (<i>Shabbat</i> 9b). (See also <i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i> 5:6)

He should not enter a tanning house close to <i>Minchah</i> before he has prayed, lest he see a deficiency in his work which he will deal with, and [thereby] be delayed from praying<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Even if he began after the time of <i>Minchah Gedolah</i> and, therefore, his beginning was a transgression (<i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i>).
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam explains, in his commentary on the Mishnah, that if one sees a deficiency in the skin he will attempt to stop further damage, and his involvement in this work could last until after the end of the time for <i>Minchah</i>.
The Rambam's interpretation of the mishnah is not accepted by other authorities. <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Shabbat, loc. cit.</i>) rules that only complicated activities are forbidden and simple acts, e.g., a snack or a normal haircut are permitted.
This disagreement finds expression in the rulings of the later authorities. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 232:2) quotes the Rambam's view. The Ramah brings a third opinion (of the <i>Ba'al HaMa'or</i>) which rules that even a large meal is permissible before <i>Minchah Gedolah</i>, and that a snack is permissible even before <i>Minchah K'tanah</i>. He adds that perhaps the reason for this leniency is that since it was customary to call people to synagogue, it is unlikely that they would not forget to go. However, he advises following the more stringent view when praying alone.
</i>.<br>If he begins doing one of these things, he need not stop, but may finish and then recite <i>Minchah</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This leniency is also based on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat, loc. cit.</i>). After listing all the activities that are forbidden once <i>Minchah Gedolah</i> arrives, the Mishnah concludes: ""And if he starts, he need not stop.""
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that this is the case only if he will be able to recite <i>Minchah</i> before the conclusion of the appropriate time. To emphasize this point, the Rambam mentions explicitly: ""and then recite <i>Minchah</i>"" - i.e., after he finishes doing whatever it is that he has started doing. However, if there will not be time to pray afterwards, he must stop and pray. Only then may he resume his activity.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 232:2, follows this interpretation of the Rambam and adds that if there will not be time afterwards, one must stop what he is doing immediately. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> points out that this means that even if it is still relatively early, if one is eating and expects the meal to continue until after the time of <i>Minchah</i>, he must stop immediately and pray, rather than wait until sometime later before the end of the day.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.6,"When is the beginning of a haircut?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In Halachah 5, the Rambam taught us that if one had already begun his involvement in any of these activities, he need not stop in order to recite <i>Minchah</i>. Therefore, it is necessary to understand what constitutes involvement in these activities.
</i> When he puts the barber's cloth over his knees<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The מעפורת is an apron used to collect the hairs falling from one's head during a haircut, so that they do not fall onto his clothes. (<i>Shabbat</i> 9b) In his commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam states that one who has put the cloth over his knees ""is prepared for a haircut."" From that point on, even though no hair has actually been cut, he is considered involved in the haircut, so that he need not stop to pray.

This is based on the Rambam's interpetation of <i>Shabbat</i> 9b: ""When he removes his מעפרתו from himself."" Rashi, in his commentary on that passage, offers a different interpretation - one's outermost garment, i.e., the first garment removed. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 232:2) rules in line with Rashi's position.

When he ties the apron between his shoulders, as is the way of artisans<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rashi explains that the judges wore their <i>talleisim</i> in court in order to focus their attention on the serious nature of the matter at hand. <i>Shabbat</i> 10a states: ""Any judge who adjudicates a judgment of absolute truth ..., is considered by the Torah to be a partner with God in the creation of the world.""
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rashi explains that the custom in Babylonia was to wear their belts particularly tight, necessitating that they be loosened prior to eating. This was not the case in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.
It is interesting to note that in his commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam mentions only the halachah of washing one's hands. Since the Mishnah was written in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, its interpretation must be in line with the customs and realities of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. However, in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Rambam focuses on the actual halachah. Hence, he defines the beginning of eating in line with both positions, one relevant to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and the other to Babylonia.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Shabbat</i> 9b records a disagreement between Rav and Rabbi Chanina. Rav states that washing one's hands constitutes the beginning of eating, whereas Rabbi Chanina is of the opinion that loosening one's belt before eating is the beginning of the meal. The Talmud concludes that there is no real argument. Rav described the halachah for inhabitants of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, and Rabbi Chanina, for those of Babylonia.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Shabbat</i> 9b states simply: ""When he ties between his shoulders."" In his commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam explains that it is when he ties his belt in order to work with the skins. Evidently this means the belt around his apron. There is a version of the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah which mentions also that he begins working with the skins. This is, however, hard to understand in light of his commentary here in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.

Rather, he should [first] pray, and afterwards he may eat, drink or sleep.<br>I<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 4b discusses the decree of the Sages requiring the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> before midnight even though its actual time lasts until dawn (See <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 1:9.). That passage states:
The Sages produced a support for their words in order that a person not come in from the field in the evening and say: ""I shall go home, eat a little, sleep a little and then recite the <i>Shema</i> and pray,"" lest he be overcome by sleep and sleep all night.<br>
Rather, he should come from the field in the evening and enter the synagogue. If he is accustomed to recite the <i>Shema</i> immediately, he should. If he is accustomed to study Torah first, he should study, recite the <i>Shema</i>, pray and then eat his bread and recite grace.
In contrast to the restrictions mentioned in the previous halachah in regard to the afternoon prayers...
It is permissible to have a haircut or enter a bathhouse before the Morning Prayer. [The Sages] only established their decree before <i>Minchah</i>, since it is common for most people to go there during the day. However, in the morning, [these actions] are uncommon. Hence they did not establish a decree. - Since the Mishnah cited above mentions only ""close to <i>Minchah</i>,"" the Rambam assumes that the halachot apply only to מנחה and not to שחרית for the reason he explains.
The Rambam does not mention going to the tanning house or eating in this halachah, because they are included in Halachah 4 regarding working or eating before the Morning Prayer, both of which are prohibited.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.8,"A person who is involved in the study of Torah when the time for prayer arrives must stop and pray<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 9b) states that one must stop for <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, but not for prayer. The Talmud (11a) explains that this refers to one involved in the study of Torah.
</i>. If the study of Torah is his full-time occupation and he does not work at all<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 3:3, the Rambam states: ""There is no commandment among all the commandments that is equal to the study of Torah. Rather, the study of Torah is equal to all the other commandments, since study brings one to action. Therefore, study comes before action at all times.""
A person involved in Torah study achieves a level of unity with God that is unparalleled by any other activity. One's intellect and God's wisdom become inextricably linked, until they are indistinguishable during the moments of one's actual involvement in study. On this basis, we can understand the description of Torah with the metaphor of bread (Proverbs 9:5, <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 4:13). After bread is consumed by a person, it becomes assimilated into his blood and becomes part of the person himself. Similarly, when Torah is studied, it becomes absorbed into the person's character and becomes an integral part of his being (<i>Tanya</i>, Chapter 5).
As explained in the introduction to this text, prayer focuses on our attempt to relate to the Godliness that permeates our worldly existence. Though this is an extremely significant service, the connection established through Torah study is more complete. Thus, <i>Shabbat</i> 10a records how Ravvah rebuked Rav Hamnuna for neglecting his Torah studies to prolong his prayers. By doing he was ""abandoning eternal life for transcient life."" Therefore, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his colleagues whose commitment to Torah was all encompassing were not required to interrupt their studies for prayer.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Shabbat</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) continues:
This applies only to Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his colleagues, whose full time occupation was the study of Torah, but we stop studying to recite the <i>Shema</i> and to pray.
Rashi explains that anyone who interrupts his studies in order to work, must also interrupt his studies in order to pray.
</i>, and he is involved in the study of Torah at the time of prayer, he need not stop, since the commandment of the study of Torah is greater that the commandment of prayer.<br>Anyone involved in efforts for the welfare of the community is like one involved in Torah study<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., he can be compared to one whose full time occupation is the study of Torah. Therefore, he is exempt from the <i>Amidah</i> at that time.
This comparison of community work to the study of Torah is found in the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 5:1. However, there it is taught in the context of praying in the midst of words of Torah. (See Chapter 4, Halachah 18.) Community work is also considered like Torah, so that one may pray after such work and it is considered as if he prayed in the midst of words of Torah.
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam derives this law from the continuation of the Talmudic passage (<i>Shabbat</i> 11a) cited above. The Talmud states that one involved in the decision of whether or not to proclaim a leap year (עיבור שנה) need not stop to pray, even though Torah study is not his full-time occupation. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> posits that the Rambam views involvement in עיבור שנה as community work. On this basis, he concludes that one need not stop in order to pray if he is involved in such activities.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.9,"One is forbidden to interrupt his <i>Amidah</i> except in a situation where his life is endangered. E<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> fail to understand the concept explained above and...
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 29b) states: ""Even if the king greets him, he may not answer."" The Talmud explains that this applies only to a Jewish king, but not to a foreign king. A Jewish king is expected to appreciate the seriousness of prayer and realize that a person's unwillingness to interrupt his prayers is not intended as an insult to the king's authority, but rather, submission to an even greater authority.
It is interesting to note that this halachah is taught in the Mishnah within the context of halachot stressing the serious nature of the <i>Amidah</i> and the high level of concentration necessary. Just as we learned that the level of intention necessary for the <i>Amidah</i> is greater than that necessary for <i>Kri'at Shema</i> (see Chapter 5, Halachah 8 and the commentary there), so too, the halachot regarding interruptions are stricter, as mentioned.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 2:15-17, we discussed the various situations in which one is allowed to interrupt his recitation of the <i>Shema</i>. Here, the Rambam teaches that the laws regarding the <i>Amidah</i> are much more strict. Only a threat to one's very life is considered sufficient cause to interrupt the <i>Amidah</i>.
</i>ven if the King of Israel greets him, he must not answer him. However, he may interrupt [to answer] a non-Jewish king, lest he kill him<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as a rebel against the king.
<i>Berachot</i> 32b-33a relates the following story which shows that the Sages did not always avail themselves of the leniency granted:
A righteous man was once praying on the road. A minister approached him and greet him. However, he did not respond.<br>
[The minister] waited until he had finished praying and said to him: ""Empty one! Is it not written in your Torah: 'Take heed and watch yourself carefully' (Deuteronomy 4:9 , and 'Guard yourselves very carefully' (Deuteronomy 4:15 .""<br>
""When I greeted you, why didn't you answer? If I had cut off your head with my sword, who would have sought vengeance for your life?""<br>
He said to him: ""Let me appease you with words. If you were standing in front of an earthly king and your friend came and greeted you would you answer him?""<br>
[The minister] said: ""No.""<br>
""And if you did answer him what would they do to you?""<br>
He replied: ""They would cut off my head!""<br>
He said: ""And is it not reasonable that if you [would not interrupt] while standing in front of an earthly king who is here today and in the grave tomorrow, so too I, standing in front of the King of Kings, the Holy One blessed be He, who is eternally present, all the more so [should I not interrupt in order to return greetings].""<br>
The minister was appeased immediately, and the righteous person returned home in peace.""
</i>.<br>A person standing in the [midst of the] <i>Amidah</i> who sees a non-Jewish king or tyrant approaching him should shorten [his prayer]. I<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 32b offers these two alternatives.
Rabbenu Yonah maintains that if possible, one should move slightly in order to avoid confronting the king or tyrant, and thus avoid the need to talk.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rabbenu Yonah explains that this means simply to recite the beginning and end of each blessing. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> also agrees with this explanation.
In Chapter 2, Halachot 2-3, the Rambam mentions the text for a shortened prayer. However, there is not necessarily a contradiction between this opinion and that law.
</i>f unable to do so, he may stop. Similarly, if one sees snakes or scorpions approaching him in a place where their bite is fatal, he should stop [praying] and flee. If they are not fatal, he should not stop<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 29b) states: ""...and even if there is a snake curled around his ankle, he should not interrupt [his <i>Amidah</i>]."" The Talmud (33a) mentions that a snake does not cause an interruption, but a scorpion does. Rashi explains that though snakes are not likely to bite, scorpions are likely to sting. Thus, the passage raises questions on the Rambam's decision, for he does not distinguish between snakes and scorpions.
The Rambam's statements appear to be based on the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 5:1, which states that one ignores a snake only if it is simply curling around his leg. However, were the snake to approach him in a menacing fashion, appearing likely to bite, he may flee from the snake.
It is important to note that there is no actual need to interrupt his <i>Amidah</i> in the case of the dangerous creatures. He need simply leave that spot, find a safe place and continue praying.
<i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> points out that in all the cases mentioned, even if he did actually speak in the middle of <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, he need only start again at the beginning of the blessing in which he stopped. If, however, he interrupted himself during the first or last three blessings, he should return to the beginning of the beginning of the first of the three blessings.

Rashi and <i>Tosafot</i> explain that the distinction between <i>Kri'at Shema</i> and the <i>Amidah</i> is based on the fact that the recital of the <i>Shema</i> is a Torah obligation. Some commentaries explain that this explanation would even be acceptable according to the Rambam. Though he holds that the <i>Amidah</i> is also a Torah obligation (see Chapter 1, Halachah 1), it is only necessary to pray once daily in order to fulfill one's Torah obligation. Therefore, one may be more lenient in granting an exemption from the <i>Amidah</i>, since the Torah obligation may have already been fulfilled or may be fulfilled by another <i>Amidah</i> later in the day.
However, the Rambam, himself, offers a different explanation in his commentary on the Mishnah. There, he states that since one is troubled (לבו טרוד) by the burial, he is exempt from the <i>Amidah</i>. This seems to be a function of the greater need for intention in the <i>Amidah</i> rather than its non-Torah status.

When they heard their teacher declare, ""Do not serve the master for the sake of receiving a reward,"" they were upset, since they thought that he was implying that no reward would be given for the performance of mitzvot. They spoke about the matter between themselves and decided to reject the Torah.
They began splinter groups which rejected the core of Jewish practice, and coveted material wealth. They found that they could not convince the majority of the people to reject the Torah entirely, so they adopted a different tactic. They claimed that they were true to Torah, but the only Torah that was Divine was the Written Law. The Oral Law was merely a human invention.
This thesis was only a ruse to sway the people from the performance of the mitzvot. Accordingly, the Sages would frequently refer to all those who deny the Torah and its tradition to be Sadducees (""followers of Tzadok"") or Baithosees (""followers of Baithos"").

If he writes with his left hand, the <i>tefillin</i> should be placed on the right.
Rav Shlomo Kluger, the <i>Tzemach Tzedek</i>, and other later authorities have dealt with questions concerning people who are ambidextrous to varying degrees. Frequently, they have advised that such a person wear <i>tefillin</i> on one of his arms during the prayer service, and afterwards place them on the other arm, to make sure that he fulfills the mitzvah.

Though the Sages of the Talmud may have used certain verses from the Torah as allusions to these instructions, the fulfillment of the mitzvot began at Sinai (or shortly afterwards, depending on the mitzvah). The people did not need the allusions from the Torah to tell them how to fulfill the mitzvot, since they had already received this information orally from Moses.
To relate these concepts to the present context: Although the Sages mentioned several exegetical references to the places where <i>tefillin</i> are worn, it is not that the Sages discovered the proper position for <i>tefillin</i>. Rather, directly after they were given the commandment to put on <i>tefillin</i>, the Jews placed them on their arms and heads.

In that initial version, the Rambam explains (based on <i>Menachot</i> 44a) that the Sages feared that if a person were given license to wear only one <i>tefillah</i>, he might hesitate from purchasing the other one. Therefore, they allowed one to wear a single <i>tefillah</i> only when he already possessed the second one.

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 4.5","When does the above apply?

</i>, one recites only a single blessing, ""...to put on <i>tefillin</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This phrase can also refer to putting on the head <i>tefillin</i>, since both mitzvot share the same intent. Hence, if no interruption is made between the two, it is unnecessary - and therefore, we are forbidden - to recite a second blessing.
This ruling is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 25:5) and is followed by all Sephardic authorities and some Ashkenazic authorities. The majority of the Ashkenazic community follows the opinion of Rabbenu Asher (quoted by the Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) which maintains that the two blessings should be recited even when no interruption is made between putting on the two <i>tefillin</i>.
This opinion agrees that the blessing ""...to put on <i>tefillin</i>"" also applies to the head <i>tefillin</i>. Therefore, even according to this opinion, it is forbidden to make an interruption between putting on the two <i>tefillin</i>; nevertheless, the Sages instituted a second blessing in recognition of the unique importance and holiness of the head <i>tefillin</i>.
The later authorities have added that because of the possibility that the second blessing is being recited in vain, one should recite the phrase <i>Baruch shem kavod malchuto le'olam va'ed</i>.
</i>.""<br>One should tie the <i>tefillin</i> on one's arm<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rabbenu Asher and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 25:11) write that one should put on the head <i>tefillin</i> directly after tying the <i>tefillin</i> to the arm, before continuing to wind the straps around the hand. Thus, no interruption at all will be made between the fulfillment of the two mitzvot.
There are, however, certain opinions (see the commentary of Rav David Arameah) that maintain that since tying the arm <i>tefillin</i> around the middle finger is an essential element of the mitzvah, this should be done before putting on the head <i>tefillin</i>.
Our present practice follows the <i>Ari zal</i> who would wind the <i>tefillin</i> straps around his forearm, put on the head <i>tefillin</i>, and then, tie the straps around his hand (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 25:24, <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 25:38).

Other interruptions - e.g., to signal to a colleague or to wink at him - are also forbidden. They do not, however, require a second blessing.
</i> - even to respond to a greeting from one's teacher<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam chooses this example because a person is required to show deference to his teacher. Accordingly, although normally one is forbidden to interrupt the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>, one may do so to greet his teacher or return his greetings, according to the rules outlined in <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 2:15-16.
The comparison to a teacher is also significant from a different perspective. <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) discusses when one may interrupt one's prayers ""because of fear"" - e.g., when one encounters a gentile king. Whenever an interruption is allowed in deference to such a king, one may also respond to <i>Barchu, Kedushah,</i> or <i>Kaddish</i>, for they are expressions of deference to the King of kings (<i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 66).
From the fact that the Rambam mentions the prohibition against talking between putting on the two <i>tefillin</i> in the context of deference to one's teacher, one might assume that he would allow an interruption in the above situations when deference to God is involved. Though this opinion is accepted by many early and later authorities (Rabbenu Tam, Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi), the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 25:10) forbids making such an interruption.
</i> - until he puts on the head <i>tefillin</i>. If he talks, it is considered to be a transgression<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> since, by doing so, he obligates himself to recite a second blessing that would otherwise not be required. Reciting an unnecessary blessing violates the prohibition, ""Do not take the name of God, your Lord, in vain"" (Exodus 20:7 .
Based on Deuteronomy 20:8, the Sages explained that the Jewish army should be composed only of righteous men. Any sinners were excused from military service. Significantly, there are opinions which consider this transgression significant enough for a person to be included in this category (<i>Sotah</i> 44b).

Afterwards, the later Rabbis discovered a statement of the <i>Zohar Chadash</i> (<i>Shir HaShirim</i> 1:3), which severely criticizes those who wear <i>tefillin</i> on these days, and the custom of not wearing <i>tefillin</i> spread.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 31:1) forbids wearing <i>tefillin</i> on <i>chol hamo'ed</i>. The Ramah (<i>loc. cit.</i>) maintains that they should be worn and a blessing recited. At present, even those who wear <i>tefillin</i> on <i>chol hamo'ed</i> generally do not recite a blessing (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 31:8). In the Sephardic and Chassidic communities and, similarly, in all communities in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, it is customary not to wear <i>tefillin</i> on these days.

(See also the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah: <i>Eruvin</i> 10:1; <i>Beitzah</i> 1:10.)

As mentioned in <i>Menachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), there is a debate whether the verse, ""And you shall observe this statute..."" applies to <i>tefillin</i> or the Pesach.
Rabbi Yosse HaG'lili interprets the verse as referring to <i>tefillin</i>, and explains that it teaches that <i>tefillin</i> should not be worn at night, nor on Sabbaths and holidays. Rabbi Akiva differs, and interprets the verse as referring to the Paschal sacrifice. Though he maintains that <i>tefillin</i> should be worn at night, he agrees that they should not be worn on Sabbaths and holidays, and derives that concept from the verse, ""And they shall be a sign....""
The Rambam quotes the proof-texts cited by both the differing opinions because each one clearly alludes to the halachic principles he seeks to express (Radbaz, Vol. V, Responsum 1693). For this same reason, he sees no difficulty in quoting the verse, ""And you shall observe these statutes..."" in <i>Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh</i> 1:7 according to the interpretation of Rabbi Akiva.

According to the Rambam, the prohibition against wearing <i>tefillin</i> at night stems from the Torah. A blessing, nevertheless, is not required when removing them.

On the contrary, in Talmudic times (see Halachah 25), <i>tefillin</i> would be worn throughout the day, even during one's involvement in mundane affairs.
Accordingly, the Rabbis (see <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 28:1; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 44:3) explain that here, by ""diversion of attention,"" the Rabbis meant that a person's mind should not become focused on frivolous matters or on his bodily needs to the extent that he forgets about the fear of God. Thus, the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 38:4) states that a person who cannot control himself from thinking about lewd things should not put on <i>tefillin</i>, and <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 38:8 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 38:30 free a person who is troubled by cold from the obligation of wearing <i>tefillin</i>.

We saw the <i>Geonim</i>, the heads of the court, and the giants of the previous generations... who would not remove their <i>tefillin</i> until after... the <i>Shema</i> of the evening service.
Nevertheless, at present, even Torah scholars have accepted the practice of wearing <i>tefillin</i> only during the morning prayers. This practice was instituted since <i>tefillin</i> require ""a clean body"" (Halachah 15) and one cannot divert his attention from them (Halachah 14), and most people cannot meet these requirements (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 37:2).

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 4.1","These are the required measurements of a sukkah: Its height<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> I.e., the height of its inner space, without including the height of the <i>s'chach</i> (<i>Eruvin</i> 3b)
</i> should not be less than ten handbreadths<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> anything less is not considered to be a dwelling fit for human habitation (See <i>Sukkah</i> 4a.) <i>Sukkah</i> 4b-5a derives the concept as follows: The ark and the <i>kaporet</i> covering it were ten handbreadths high. This constituted a line of demarcation between the place where the <i>Shechinah</i> was manifest and the area below it. Thus, we see that a height of ten handbreadths is sufficient for an independent area.
Rabbenu Manoach establishes a closer relationship between the above concept and a sukkah, noting that Exodus 25:20 describes how the wings of the cherubs ""shall shield the <i>kaporet</i>,"" using the verb סככים, which has the same root as the word <i>s'chach</i>. The beginning of the height of the cherub's ""shield,"" ten cubits, is the minimum of the height for our <i>s'chach</i>.
</i> nor more than twenty cubits<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Any structure more than twenty cubits high can only be built as a permanent dwelling. Hence, it is unfit to serve as a sukkah, which must be of a temporary nature. (See <i>Sukkah</i> 2a and the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah.)[ It must be noted that any structure less than 20 cubits high can serve as a sukkah even if its walls are of a permanent nature.]
A cubit is 48 centimeters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i> and 57.6 centimeters according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>.
</i>. Its area should not be less than seven handbreadths by seven handbreadths<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the minimum size necessary to contain a person's head, the majority of his body [6 handbreadths by six handbreadths], and a small table [a handbreadth by a handbreadth] (Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Sukkah</i> 2:8). A handbreadth is 8 centimeters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, and 9.6 centimeters according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>.
The Rambam explains the requirement of seven handbreadths by seven hand breadths as follows: The first three hand breadths are not of consequence because of the principle of <i>l'vud</i> and four additional handbreadths are required since the smallest area of halachic consequence is four cubits by four cubits (Commentary, to the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 1:1).
If the sukkah is not seven handbreadths in either length or width, it is invalid, even if its area equals 49 square handbreadths. If it is round in shape, it must be sufficiently large to encompass a square seven by seven (See Halachah 7). This size is required because if either of the dimensions were less, it would not be considered a dwelling fit for human habitation (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 634:1-2; <i>Magen Avraham; Taz</i>).

 i<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 16b teaches that whenever there is a gap of three handbreadths or less between two entities, the principle of <i>l'vud</i> applies. The gap is considered to be closed and the two parts connected. Thus, the third wall is considered to be more than four handbreadths long, hence spanning more than half of the length required for the third wall. Therefore, it is acceptable (Rabbenu Nissim).
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rabbenu Manoach notes that a <i>gamma</i> has the same shape as the Hebrew letter <i>dalet</i> (see accompanying drawing) and asks why the Sages did not use that letter to refer to the intended shape. He explains that the very letters of the Hebrew alphabet are endowed with holiness. Hence, the Sages did not want to use them as an example to refer to a mundane matter.

The Rabbis have posed an abstract question: Is the minimum requirement for a sukkah three walls (including one which is incomplete), or must a sukkah have four walls, however, the Torah was lenient enough to consider a sukkah of this nature as comparable to one of four walls.
The <i>Marcheshet</i> brings support for the latter view, quoting <i>Sukkah</i> 7b, which states that since the third wall only a handbreadth in size is considered to be a wall with regard to the laws of sukkah, it is also considered to be a wall with regard to the laws regarding a private domain on the Sabbath. In the latter instance, four walls are necessary.

The <i>Bayit Chadash (Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 430) explains that the requirement of a ""likeness of an entrance"" is a Rabbinic ordinance, and, according to Torah law, a sukkah is acceptable as long as the third wall is a handbreadth as required.

</i>, it is kosher, and one may ascend to it on the festival<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., on the first day of Sukkot in Eretz Yisrael and on the first and second days in the diaspora.
</i>. If one constructs it on the treetops or on a camel's back, it is kosher<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 23a explains that Rabbi Yehudah objected to the use of such a sukkah, explaining that since it was not fit to be used on all seven days of the holiday (because of the prohibition against using it on the first day), it should not be used at all.
Our halachah follows Rabbi Meir's opinion. He accepts Rabbi Yehudah's motivating principle, but explains that in the case at hand, there is no inherent difficulty with using such a sukkah throughout the holiday. The only reason it is not used on the first day is an external factor - a Rabbinic decree - which should not affect the halachic status of the sukkah itself.
</i>, but one may not ascend to it on the festival<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Surely, this prohibition also applies on the Sabbath.
From the Rambam's words, it appears that the restriction applies when the floor of the sukkah is actually in the tree. In contrast, Rashi (<i>Shabbat</i> 154b), <i>Tosafot, Sukkah</i> 22b and the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explain that even if the sukkah is on the ground and only the <i>s'chach</i> is supported by the tree, it is forbidden to use such a sukkah on the festival, lest one place utensils on the <i>s'chach</i>, and thus make use of the tree.
The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (628:6) quotes this opinion, but states that at present it is no longer customary to place articles on the <i>s'chach</i>. Therefore, it is permitted to use such a sukkah. His opinion is quoted by <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 628:7, and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 628:17, with one qualification. At the outset, it is desirable not to use an article as support for <i>s'chach</i> unless it is, itself, fit to be used as <i>s'chach</i>. Hence, since the trees themselves are not fit to be used as <i>s'chach</i>, they should not be used as its supports.
</i>, because climbing on a tree or animal is forbidden on a festival<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Beitzah</i> 5:2 relates:

All the [prohibitions] which we are obligated [to observe as] <i>sh'vut</i>...on the Sabbath, we are obligated [to observe] on a festival. These are [the activities prohibited] as <i>sh'vut</i>: We do not climb a tree; we do not ride an animal...

In his commentary on that Mishnah, the Rambam writes:

""We do not climb a tree"" - a decree lest we uproot [it];
""we do not ride an animal"" - a decree lest we break off a branch to lead it.

</i>.<br>If some of the walls were the result of human activity and some were trees, we consider [its structure]. We may ascend to any [sukkah] where, if the trees were taken away, it would be able to stand with the walls that were built by man alone<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam quotes this general principle from the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 23a. The Mishnah adds examples to express the concept more clearly:

Two [walls] that were the result of human activity and one [wall] from the tree, or two [walls] from the tree and one [wall] that is a result of human activity.

<b>Diagram A</b>

A sukkah that does not possess a roof is invalid<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> because a dwelling even of a temporary nature must have a roof.
</i>. To what does this refer? A sukkah whose walls are joined to each other like a hut<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rashi (<i>Sukkah</i> 19b) explains that this is a reference to a hunter's hut. See Diagram A;
</i>; alternatively, when the side of the sukkah is placed against the wall<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Diagram B.
</i>. However, if it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the sukkah
</i> has a roof, even only a handbreadth in width<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> between the two walls, as depicted in Diagram C. As long as it has a roof at least a handbreadth wide, the remainder of the roof may be slanted.
</i>, or if one lifted the side of the sukkah close to the wall a handbreadth above the ground<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rabbenu Manoach, and others explain that though leniency is taken and such a sukkah is allowed, it must still possess all the dimensions required of a kosher sukkah mentioned in Halachah 1 of this chapter. Accordingly, at least six handbreadths of the slanted roof must itself be kosher for use as <i>s'chach</i>, and it must be more than 16 handbreadths long, so that it will be of the required height. When the Sukkah meets these qualifications, one is permitted to eat and sleep within it. (See also Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 631:10.)

<br>A round sukkah - if its circumference is large enough to contain a square seven handbreadths by seven handbreadths, it is kosher even though it has no corners<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 7b records an opinion which disqualifies such a sukkah because it is not fit for use as a permanent dwelling. Nevertheless, the halachah does not follow this view.
On this basis, we can understand the placement of this law. On the surface, it would be more appropriate to state this law as part of Halachah 1, which describes the dimensions of a sukkah. However, the Rambam structured the order of his halachot according to their motivating principles. Thus, the first clause of the halachah describes the construction of a sukkah whose shape causes it to be deemed unacceptable even as a temporary dwelling. In contrast, this clause describes a sukkah whose shape is abnormal, but acceptable for temporary purposes.

S'chach Placed Over An Alley<br><br>
A) The Lechi

Should a person place <i>s'chach</i> over an alleyway which possesses a <i>lechi</i> o<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 17:27 states:

When a total of eight <i>pasim</i> [partitions] are constructed around a well, two connected to each other at each of its corners, they are considered to be walls. Thus, even though on each side the open portion exceeds the closed, since the four corners are closed, it is permitted to fill up water from the well and to water an animal.
What is the height of each of these <i>pasim</i>? Ten handbreadths; their length must be at least six handbreadths and between each <i>pas</i>, there should be...no more than thirteen and one third cubits.

Thus, there are no complete walls to this structure, and without the special provision granted by this halachah, it would not be acceptable.
<i>Sukkah</i> 7b explains that each of these situations possesses an advantage over the other: The alley possesses an advantage in that it has two complete walls. In contrast, the well possesses an advantage in that it has partitions of some sort on each of its four sides. Hence, it is necessary to state both these laws, and neither could be derived from the other.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 17:2 states:

How is one permitted [to carry articles] in a closed alleyway?
One constructs a <i>lechi</i> (vertical pole) [at the entrance] to the fourth side or one lays a beam (<i>korah</i>) across [the span of the fourth side].

Rabbenu Manoach explains that although the alleyway is closed on three sides, were it not for the special provisions mentioned in this halachah, it would not be acceptable, because in this instance the <i>s'chach</i> is placed more than four cubits away from the end of the alleyway. Hence, generally, as explained in Chapter 5, Halachah 14, such a sukkah would not be acceptable.

S'Chach Placed Over Poles Erected At
The Corners Of A Roof

Should a person implant four poles in the four corners of the roof and place <i>s'chach</i> upon them, i<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> because of the principle of גוד אסיק מחיצתא, it is considered as if the walls of the house have been extended upward, as explained in Halachah 5.
This halachah is based on the statements of <i>Sukkah</i> 4b. There are differences in the versions of the relevant passage possessed by the Rambam and Rav Sherirah Gaon, on the one hand, and those possessed by other Sages, on the other hand. Because of those textual differences, the Ra'avad, Rabbenu Manoach, and others have questioned the Rambam's decision. (See <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>.)
These differences caused the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 630:6) to reject the Rambam's decision. The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 630:31 states that even according to the Rambam, the poles must be placed exactly at the edge of the roof. If they are placed further in, even when they are within three handbreadths of the edge, the sukkah is not acceptable.

The Magen Avraham</i> 630:1 explains that regarding the laws of sukkah, this principle applies only when one constructs four walls. However, if the sukkah has only three walls, the principle of <i>l'vud</i> cannot be applied, to consider spaces less than three handbreadths in length to be closed.
</i> exceeds the closed portion, provided there is no opening larger than ten cubits<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 7a states:

[The laws governing] a wall of a sukkah resemble [those governing] the wall [of an enclosure] on the Sabbath...There is an additional [stringency to the laws] of the Sabbath that does not apply to a sukkah. On the Sabbath, [a wall] is permitted only when the enclosed portion is greater than the open portion. This does not apply to a sukkah.

The Rambam describes the laws governing a wall on the Sabbath as follows (<i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 16:16):

Every wall whose open portion exceeds its enclosed portion is not considered to be a wall. However, if the open portion is equal to the closed portion, it is permitted, provided that none of the open portions exceeds ten cubits.

Based on the above, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explain that just as concerning the laws of the Sabbath, the closed portion of a wall must exceed its open portion, so, too, concerning two of the walls of the sukkah. The leniency allowing a wall of the sukkah to be counted as a wall even though the open portion exceeds the closed portion applies only concerning the third wall. Just as other leniencies (see Halachot 2 and 3) are granted concerning the third wall, this leniency is also allowed.
Others explain that the intent is that even when the open portion of all four walls exceeds the closed portion, the sukkah is kosher, while on the Sabbath such an enclosure is not acceptable. This interpretation of the Talmud's statements is advanced by Rabbenu Asher and is quoted as halachah by the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 630:5.
</i>.<br>If there is an opening larger than ten cubits, it is necessary that the closed portion exceed the open portion, even though [the opening] is constructed in the form of an entrance.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> (ibid.) states:

If the open portion is constructed in the form of an entrance, even if it is more than ten cubits long it does not negate the wall, provided the open portion does not exceed the closed portion.

However, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 362:10, 630:5) follows the opinion of <i>Tosafot</i> and other authorities, who are willing to accept a wall as kosher even though it has a wide opening, provided it is constructed in the form of an entrance.
The <i>Sefer Hashlamah</i> presents a third view, accepting an open portion more than ten cubits long in the form of an entrance as part of the wall of a sukkah, but not concerning the laws of the Sabbath.
The Ramah concludes his discussion of this halachah by stating that since these laws are somewhat complicated, it has become customary to build whole walls without any open portions. If one has only a minimum amount of wood, it is preferable to build three complete walls, rather than to construct four walls leaving open spaces.

Although it is forbidden to create an enclosure on the Sabbath, since the person serving as the barrier is unaware of what he is doing, no transgression is involved. It is his intention, and not that of the person using the sukkah, which is significant (Ra'avad). In contrast, when the person serving as the wall is conscious of his acts, it is considered as if he has created a structure of substance (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 630:19).

Accordingly, when a spring that is worshiped provides water for only one person, we fear that it was quarried out for these purposes. In contrast, when many people benefit from a spring, we do not harbor such suspicions, even when the spring is worshiped.
[In their commentaries on <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 145:1, the <i>Turei Zahav</i> and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> reject this premise and maintain that as long as the water is attached to the spring, it is not forbidden, despite its being worshiped.

Though the halachah follows the <i>Beit Yosef's</i> opinion, the <i>Or Sameach</i> offers a different interpretation of the Rambam's words, explaining that his statements are explicit, and neither Jew nor gentile can cause his colleague's property to become forbidden.
<b>slaughtered a colleague's animal for the sake of a false deity, or exchanged it for an idol, it does not become forbidden, because a person cannot cause an article that does not belong to him to become forbidden. -</b> According to the <i>Or Sameach</i>, this is a blanket statement, applying under all circumstances. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, however, cites <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i> 2:21 (which is based on <i>Chulin</i> 41a), where the Rambam clarifies the rationale for this decision, explaining that the person presenting the offering is only performing the act to ""cause his colleague discomfort.""
The phrasing of the present halachah appears to indicate that a person has no potential to cause his colleague's property to become forbidden. From <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i>, however, it appears that were he to, in fact, desire to sacrifice an animal to an idol, he would cause it to become forbidden. Leniency is granted only because his intent is not to do so, and he appears to do so merely to cause his colleague suffering.
The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 145:8 (based on the passage from <i>Chulin</i>) rule that if a person was warned against offering the sacrifice to an idol and acknowledged the warning, it is forbidden to benefit from the animal. See also Halachah 3 and the commentary.
When a person bows down to virgin earth, he does not cause it to become forbidden - because the earth cannot be manipulated, nor was it made by man, as above.
<b>If he digs pits, channels, and caverns in it for the sake of a false deity, it becomes forbidden. -</b> From the Rambam's statements, it appears that if these diggings were carried out for the sake of an idol, they are automatically forbidden. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) differs and maintains that one must worship the land after the digging is completed. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>, 145:7) quotes the Rambam's statement.

The Ra'avad disputes the Rambam's decision, basing his opinion on <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 47a, which states: ""Water that belongs to the many is never prohibited."" Accordingly, he explains that the water can become prohibited only if it is the private property of a single individual. If it belongs to the public at large, it remains permitted even if it was picked up by human hands and worshiped.
The Rambam interprets the passage from <i>Avodah Zarah</i> differently, and maintains that once water is picked up by an individual, it is considered to be his property, and hence can become prohibited. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> does not mention this law, leading to the conclusion that it accepts the Ra'avad's view. The later authorities (e.g., <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 145:2), however, follow the Rambam's view.
[Note the comments of the <i>Turei Zahav</i> 145:3, who explains that the Rambam mentions ""Springs which provide water for many people"" in the previous halachah only to negate the Ra'avad's opinion. By making such a statement, the Rambam clarifies that water belonging to many people remains permitted at all times when it is a ""spring."" If separated from its source by human activity, it can become forbidden.]

The Ra'avad objects to this decision as well, noting that the matter is debated by the Sages in <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 46a, and no decision is reached. Since this is a question of Torah law, it would seem appropriate to follow the more stringent view.
The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 145:1) explains that the Rambam's decision is based on the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 3:6), which rules that these rocks are permitted.

According to the <i>Or Sameach</i>, who maintains that a gentile cannot cause property belonging to a Jew to become forbidden, this law can be explained as follows: Although the gentile's actions would not generally cause the brick to become forbidden, since the Jew indicated his desire to worship the brick, we assume that he is pleased with the gentile's act. Therefore, it becomes forbidden.
According to the <i>Beit Yosef's</i> opinion (see <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 145), which maintains that a gentile can cause a Jew's property to become forbidden, this passage teaches us that the Jew's act is considered sufficient to cause the brick to become forbidden.

Rashi explains that the question is whether standing up an egg is, like standing up a brick, a significant act, or whether, because an egg is much smaller than a brick, standing it up is of no significance. Because the question is left unresolved, the Rambam follows the more severe view.
This and the previous law indicate that for a Jew's acceptance of idol worship to be significant in this context, it is necessary for him to perform a deed; a verbal statement or thought is of no consequence.

Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 8.6,"How must one destroy a false deity<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The placement of this halachah appears problematic. On the surface, it would have been more appropriate to relate it after Chapter 7, Halachah 1, which mentions the commandment to destroy idol worship, or after the following halachah, which completes the description of the types of articles that are forbidden because of their association with idol worship.
Perhaps, since the prohibition against benefiting from the coating of an idol is considered to be a mitzvah in its own right, the Rambam concludes his discussion of the mitzvah to destroy prohibited articles before entering that subject (<i>Kinat Eliyahu</i>).

This objection is not accepted, since the fertilizer is not the only factor causing the crops to grow (see the commentary on Chapter 7, Halachah 14, which describes the concept of 18הז םרוגáהזו), and it was not intentionally used for this purpose (<i>Tosafot, Avodah Zarah</i> 43a).
</i>, or burn them and deposit the ashes in the Dead Sea<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See the commentary on Chapter 7, Halachah 5, which explains why the Dead Sea is mentioned.
The <i>Merchevat HaMishneh</i> cites <i>Hilchot Chametz UMatzah</i> 11:3, which states:
How must chametz be destroyed? It may be burned, crumbled and tossed to the wind, or thrown to the sea.
On this basis, he explains that there are three options to destroy a false deity: grinding and tossing it to the wind, burning (where the article must be destroyed), and throwing it into the Dead Sea. Since the Dead Sea is a barren place, which is not frequented by ships, the article need not be destroyed. Even if it is left whole, we assume that no benefit will come from it to man.
This interpretation is not accepted by all authorities. <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) maintains that even an idol tossed into the Dead Sea must be destroyed first.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 146:15) mentions letting an idol sink ""in the sea"" (not ""the Dead Sea""), without requiring that it be destroyed first. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> (145:13) and the <i>Turei Zahav</i> (145:11), however, require an idol to be destroyed before it is deposited in any sea other than the Dead Sea.

Thus, it comments, ""Which is the source from where we learn that a gentile can nullify his deity? 'You must burn the statues of their gods.'""
<i>K'nesset HaGedolah</i> notes a difficulty in this halachah, based on the principle that two new concepts cannot be derived from the same verse. <i>Avodah Zarah</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, mentions that the same phrase is quoted as the source for both this concept and the law stated in Chapter 7, Halachah 4.

<i>K'nesset HaGedolah</i> and the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> explain - using this as an example for a principle that applies throughout the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> - that the Rambam's goal was to present the laws in the manner which it could be most easily appreciated by a reader, even if in doing so he did not follow all the principles of Biblical exegesis accepted by the Talmud.

Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 8.9,"A false deity belonging to a Jew can never be nullified<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> From <i>Hilchot Sha'ar Avot HaTum'ah</i> 6:7, it appears that this decision applies only to foods which were offered to a false deity.

</i>. Rather, it is forbidden to benefit from it forever, and it must be entombed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
<i>Avodat HaMelech</i> explains that since the concept is derived from a Biblical proof-text, there is no difficulty. It is all a matter of Divine decree. In one instance, God desires that the false deities be destroyed, while in another instance He desires that they be entombed.
Similarly, when a false deity - Note that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 146:2) distinguishes between a false deity itself and its accessories and adornments, stating that the latter may be nullified by a gentile even after they have been acquired by a Jew.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 52a derives this from Deuteronomy 27:15: ""Cursed be the man who makes an idol... and places it in a secret place."" We can infer: What must be done with an idol made by a Jew? It must be placed in a ""secret place"" - i.e., entombed.
</i>.<br>Similarly, when a false deity belonging to a gentile enters the possession of a Jew, and then is nullified by a gentile, the nullification is of no consequence<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 146) explains that this is a Rabbinic decree.
</i>, and it is forbidden to benefit from it forever<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Therefore, whenever a Jew wants to take possession of a false deity, he must have it nullified by a gentile before he assumes ownership of it.
A Jew cannot nullify a false deity - An idol can be nullified as a divinity only by a person who once attached importance to it. Since a Jew is, in essence, a believer in the true God, his attachment to idols is merely superficial. Hence, his acts can have no effect upon them.
</i>.<br>A Jew cannot nullify a false deity even when it is in the possession of a gentile<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that this decision applies even when the gentile gives the Jew permission to nullify it.
</i>. A gentile who is a minor or a fool cannot nullify a false deity<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 43a relates the following narrative:
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi related: Once I was following Rabbi Elazar HaKappar the Great on a road. He found a ring with the imprint of a <i>d'rakon</i> (see Chapter 7, Halachah 8) on it. He passed a gentile child without saying anything to him. Afterwards, he met a gentile adult and asked him to nullify it. He refused. Rabbi Elazar struck him and he nullified it.<br>
We learn from this three things: a) a gentile can nullify an idol whether it belongs to him or to his colleague; b) a gentile who is knowledgeable about idol worship can nullify it, while one who is not knowledgeable cannot nullify it; c) a gentile's nullification of idol worship is effective even if he is compelled to do so.
Neither a minor nor a fool is considered ""knowledgeable about idol worship."" hence, their nullification is not acceptable.
When a gentile is forced to nullify a false deity - whether it belongs to him or to other gentiles - even when he is forced to do so by Jews, the nullification is of consequence.
The gentile who nullifies idol worship must himself be an idolater. - It does not, however, matter whether the idolater worships the particular idol he nullifies or not. For example, a worshiper of Pe'or can nullify a shrine of Marculis (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 64b).

When a gentile is forced to nullify a false deity - whether it belongs to him or to other gentiles, even when he is forced to do so by Jews - the nullification is of consequence.<br>The gentile who nullifies idol worship must himself be an idolater. If he is not an idolater, his nullification is of no consequence<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Avodah Zarah</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) states that a <i>ger toshav</i> - a gentile who accepts the observance of the seven universal laws given to Noach and his descendants - cannot nullify an idol.
As stated in Chapter 10, Halachah 6, a <i>ger toshav</i> must formalize his acceptance of these laws before a Rabbinic court. Also, the laws of a <i>ger toshav</i> apply only during the era when the Jubilee year is observed. Nevertheless, from <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 11:7 and 13:11, it appears that even a gentile who observes the seven Noachide laws cannot nullify an idol in the present era. There, the Rambam explains that the Moslems are not considered to be idolaters regarding the laws of <i>yayin nesech</i>. Thus, it can be assumed that their nullification of idol worship would not be of consequence.
See also the statements of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 124:2) and the Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 124:5), which appear to accept this decision.

Rabbi Yochanan does not accept this opinion and maintains that even when an idol is broken it is revered. <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 49b states that the gentiles would even worship the broken pieces of an idol. (See also the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 3:3.)

Thus, we are forced to say that this law is speaking about an instance where the stone is presently being used as a platform. It can be interpreted as applying when the damage happens as a matter of course. The Rambam is teaching us that even though the stone is being used as a platform at present, since it will soon be replaced, it is permitted.

Rabban Gamliel's colleagues did not agree with this approach, and when Rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah was appointed in his place, these restrictions were lifted. That day, hundreds of students streamed into the house of study, and even Rabban Gamliel felt the need to reconsider his approach. (See <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>.)

Furthermore, if the student seeks very earnestly to study, even though he has not changed his behavior, he should be instructed, the teacher carefully balancing his reproofs with positive reinforcement.

The Talmud continues, explaining that only a sage of stature who can ""suck a pomegranate and discard its shell"" may follow such a course of behavior. Most people should refrain from studying under such teachers.
Accordingly, the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> concludes that the Rambam did not quote the passage from <i>Chaggigah</i> because, at present, there are none who are of a stature great enough not to be influenced by a teacher of improper character.
The <i>Sefer Kovetz</i> notes that the Rambam mentions this verse in the beginning of his introduction to the Guide to the Perplexed, alluding to the fact that, in composing that work, he had to follow Rabbi Meir's example and study under teachers whose behavior he would not desire to emulate. Nevertheless, this did not represent a contradiction to his omission of this teaching in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. We find that under extraordinary conditions, it is permitted to follow a minority opinion in the Talmud. Hence, when the Rambam saw the need to compose a text like the Guide to the Perplexed, he felt that under such conditions, he should follow Rabbi Meir's example.
</i>. If he does not, do not seek Torah from his mouth."
Torah Study 4.2,"How is [Torah] taught? The teacher sits at the head and the students sit around him, so that all can see the teacher and hear his words<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Keritot</i> 6a states: ""When you sit before your teacher, look at his face, as [implied by Isaiah 30:20]: 'And your eyes shall behold your teachers.54
</i>.<br>The teacher should not sit on a chair, [while] his students [sit] on the ground. Rather, either everyone should sit on the ground<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Mo'ed Katan</i> 16b praises King David for forgoing his royal honor and sitting on the floor to study together with the Rabbis.
</i> or everyone should sit on chairs<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Megillah</i> 21a notes that God told Moses (Deuteronomy 5:28 : ""stand together with me."" Since God neither stands nor sits, the verse obviously refers to the proper approach to instruction, where no distinction is made between the teachers and the students.
Rabbenu Nissim and other commentators cite certain Talmudic passages which appear to contradict this principle. He explains that sometimes the teacher would sit in an upraised position, so that the students could hear his words more easily. Alternatively, when a sage possessed <i>semichah</i>, the distinct Rabbinic ordination conveyed in a line from teacher to teacher, stretching back to Moses, he was granted greater privileges.
Originally, the teacher would sit and the students would stand. - The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> notes that this appears to be a direct contradiction to the principle of equality mentioned beforehand. However, he explains that the teachers were allowed to sit in order to be able to relax and transmit the subject matter more clearly. Hence, adopting that position does not represent any superiority over the students.
</i>.<br>Originally, the teacher would sit and the students would stand. [However,] before the destruction of the Second Temple, everyone followed the practice of teaching while both they and the students were seated<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Megillah</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) states:
From the time of Moses, our teacher, until Rabban Gamliel, people studied Torah only while standing; after Rabban Gamliel died, sickness descended on the world and they would study Torah while seated.
This refers to Rabban Gamliel the elder. <i>Sotah</i> 9:16 relates that when he died: ""The honor of the Torah was nullified."" Commenting on that Mishnah, the Rambam associates the nullification of the Torah's honor with the practice of studying while seated.

Torah Study 4.3,"If the teacher [desires] to instruct the students personally, he is entitled to do so. If he [desires to] teach through the medium of a spokesman<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There is a difference of opinion between the commentaries regarding the function of this individual. Rashi, <i>Yoma</i> 20b, considers him to be a translator, and, indeed, that is the literal meaning of the term <i>metargaman</i>. In Babylon and even in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, the popular spoken language was Aramaic, while many of the Sages preferred to teach in Hebrew. Therefore, they would speak to the spokesman in a hushed tone in Hebrew, and he would translate the teachings to Aramaic and teach them to the public in a loud voice.
Others maintain that the spokesman was no more than a ""human microphone."" Rather than have the sage weary himself in speaking in a tone which all could hear, he would speak softly, and the spokesman would speak in a tone that all could hear. This opinion is supported by certain passages (e.g., <i>Kiddushin</i> 31b), which refer to the spokesman as <i>amoriyah</i>, which is the Aramaic for <i>metargaman</i>.
The Ra'avad mentions a third perspective, explaining that the spokesman also communicated the teacher's words in a manner that could be understood and grasped by the students. Rabbi Shalom Dovber of Lubavitch follows a similar, but not identical, view. In <i>Yom Tov Shel Rosh Hashanah</i> 5666, he elaborates on this concept in detail, explaining that the teacher was on too high a level to explain his ideas in a manner which the common people could understand. Therefore, he would employ a spokesman, who, though he was able to comprehend the teacher's statements, was on a level that his explanations would not be too sophisticated for the people to grasp. (See also <i>Kohelet Rabbah</i> 7:12, 9:24.)
The use of a spokesman was also a sign of honor and respect for the teacher. (See Rashi, Deuteronomy 32:44.)
</i>, the spokesman should stand between him and the students. The teacher speaks to the spokesman<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in a hushed tone
</i> and he announces the teaching to all the students<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in a manner in which they could hear. (See <i>Sotah</i> 40a, <i>Chullin</i> 15a, from which we can derive a picture of the process of instruction.)
</i>.<br>When they ask the spokesman a question, he asks the teacher<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in a hushed tone, as explained.
</i>. The teacher, [in turn,] replies to the spokesman<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in a hushed tone
</i> and the spokesman replies to the questioner<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> out loud, so that others can hear.
</i>.<br>The teacher should not raise his voice above that of the spokesman<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cites <i>Berachot</i> 45a, which quotes the manner in which Moses relayed God's words at the giving of the Torah (Exodus 19:19  as the source for this concept. Nevertheless, others note that the passage in <i>Berachot</i> refers to a <i>metargaman</i> who translates the Torah reading for the people, and is not necessarily relevant to the situation at hand. Rather, they suggest that the descriptions of the use of spokesmen in the passages cited above serve as the source for this idea.
</i>. Similarly, when the spokesman asks a question of the teacher, he should not raise his voice above that of the teacher<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as a mark of respect and deference.
</i>.<br>The spokesman is not allowed to detract from, add to, or change [the teacher's words]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's statements are quoted from the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Megillah</i> 4:10. The Ra'avad differs, and quotes a narrative from <i>Yoma</i> 20b, which relates how Rav served as a spokesman for Rav Shilat and altered the connotation of his words. The Ra'avad explains that since Rav's scholarship was greater than Rav Shilat's, he was entitled to do so.
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that the Rambam did not mention such a possibility, because it is very improbable that a greater sage would serve as a spokesman for a sage of lesser stature.
</i>, unless he is the teacher's father or teacher<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rabbenu Nissim explains that a teacher or father is allowed to serve as a spokesman for his students, since they will not be jealous of the honor afforded him. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> relates that the Rambam's phraseology indicates a situation which is <i>bidievad</i> (after the fact), and ideally, neither a father or teacher should serve in this position.
There is one exception to the above principle, and, in the following situation, the spokesman should alter the teachers words...
</i>. If the teacher tells the spokesman: ""My teacher told me the following..."" or ""My father and teacher told me the following...,"" when the spokesman relates the teaching to the people, he should quote the statement in the name of the sage [who authored it]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., the teacher's father or teacher
</i>, mentioning the name of the teacher's father or teacher, saying: ""So and so, the sage, said the following<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Kiddushin</i> 31b relates that when Rav Ashi's son lectured, he would tell the spokesman: ""This is what my father and teacher said...,"" and the spokesman would say: ""This is what Rav Ashi said...""
</i>..."" [This is allowed] despite the fact the teacher did not mention the sage's name, because it is forbidden to refer to one's teacher or father by name<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Kiddushin</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) mentions this concept within the context of the laws governing the respect due to one's father. (See <i>Hilchot Mamrim</i> 6:3.) This concept is also quoted in Chapter 5, Halachah 5, as an expression of the proper respect due a teacher.

Torah Study 4.4,"If the teacher taught [a concept] and it was not grasped by the students, he should not become upset with them and display anger<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note the Mishnah, <i>Avot</i> 2:5, cited by the Rambam in the following halachah. <i>Soferim</i> 16:2 states: ""One should teach the Talmud with a pleasant countenance and the <i>aggadah</i> with a patient countenance.""
</i>. Rather, he should repeat and review the matter, even if he must do so many times, until they appreciate the depth of the halachah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Deuteronomy 31:19 states that Torah must be placed in a student's mouth. <i>Eruvin</i> 54b interprets this as a charge to teachers, requiring them to review the subject matter with their students until the latter comprehend it fully. The passage continues, praising Rabbi Pereidah for teaching one of his students each point four hundred times.
Though patience is generally required of a teacher, there are times when he should display anger as explained in the following halachah.
</i>.<br>Similarly, the student should not say ""I understood"" when he did not understand<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Derech Eretz Zuta</i>, Chapter 2, states: If you desire to study, Do not say ""I have comprehended it,"" when you have not.

Rather, he should ask again and again, even if he requires several repetitions<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The teacher's patient devotion to his students must be reflected by them. They must dedicate themselves to understanding their teacher's words and steadfastly apply themselves to their study until they comprehend.

It is necessary that I study, and my powers of comprehension are weak<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Megillah</i> 28a relates that Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi gave such a reply to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korchah after the latter impatiently rebuked him for what seemed an irrelevant question.

He continues (<i>ibid.</i> 2:5) explaining how a teacher should instruct the students ""in a composed and pleasant manner, without shouting."" Here, as well, he does not center on the negative aspects of anger in its own right, but rather its impropriety as an educational technique.

The Rambam interprets the lesson as more general in nature and applies it to the relationship between every teacher and student.

Torah Study 4.7,"A person should not ask a question while standing, nor should a person respond while standing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for a person is more composed when seated. <i>Berachot</i> 27b and <i>Tosafot, B'chorot</i> 36a mention instances when questions were asked while standing. The <i>Beit HaMelech</i> explains that matters which do not require intense thought may be asked while standing, but matters which require concentration should be discussed when both the questioner and the teacher are seated.
<i>Avodat HaMelech</i> explains that the Rambam does not intend to imply that the student should not stand. On the contrary, were he to stand, that would be a sign of respect. Rather, he means that questions should not be addressed to a teacher while the latter is standing.
</i>. One should not ask from a high place, from far away, or from behind the elders<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is not a sign of respect for the teacher.

In this halachah, the Rambam teaches that even within the general subject of the Sabbath laws, while studying the laws of one <i>melachah</i> (forbidden act), a student should not inquire regarding another.
Many of the manuscript versions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> state <i>k’inyan</i> (to the point), rather than <i>b’inyan sheheim koreim bo</i> (regarding the subject they are reading). According to these texts, there is no redundancy. Rather, this halachah teaches that a student's questions should be direct, without mentioning any extraneous matters.
</i>. A question should be asked only with an attitude of awe<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Just as the Jews received the Torah on Mount Sinai with fear and awe, similarly, our study of Torah must be charged with similar emotions (<i>Berachot</i> 22a).

Just as a person's own statements, which do not obligate him to pay a fine [and hence, can be considered a minor premise], obligate him to take an oath, the testimony of witnesses, which does obligate him to pay a fine [and, hence, can be considered a major premise,] should also obligate him to take an oath.

When a common word or phrase is found in two separate verses, an analogy is established between them, and concepts applicable to one can be related to the other.

A person is able to derive a <i>kal vichomer</i> on the basis of his own process of reasoning. In contrast, since a <i>gezeirah shaveh</i> is not the product of one's own thought process, it is more likely to be forgotten. Hence, it is given precedence.

He also quotes <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:15, which emphasizes that ""from the moment a person resolves in his heart to nullify it, the mitzvah of destroying [chametz] is fulfilled.""
</i> and to consider it as dust, and to resolve within his heart that he possesses no chametz at all: all the chametz in his possession being as dust and as a thing of no value whatsoever."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.3,"According to the Sages' decree<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As explained in the previous halachah, according to the Torah, chametz may be within a person's property as long as he declared it ownerless. Nevertheless, the Sages forbade such practices and required all chametz to be removed from one's property.
Two reasons are given for this decree:
a) The nullification of chametz is dependent on the feelings of a person's heart. A person may possibly have difficulty totally removing all thoughts of ownership over the chametz from his heart (Rabbenu Nissim, <i>Pesachim</i> 2a).
b) In contrast to other prohibited substances, chametz is used throughout the year. Thus, were he allowed to leave chametz within his property, he might accidentally forget about the prohibition and eat it on Pesach (<i>Tosefot, Pesachim</i> 2a).
In addition to the restriction against possessing chametz, the Sages further expanded the scope of
</i>, [the mitzvah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> to destroy chametz so that it
</i> involves] searching for chametz<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> It must be emphasized that the obligation to search for chametz is Rabbinic in nature only when a person nullifies his chametz when required. Otherwise, the obligation stems from the Torah, for the prohibitions against possessing chametz and the commandment to destroy it require such a search. The <i>Tzafnat Paneach</i> quotes a number of examples that demonstrate how the existence of a Torah commandment obligates a person to check and search to see that it is being fulfilled correctly.
</i> in hidden places and in any holes [within one's house]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as clarified in Halachah 6, the obligation to search applies only to those holes and crevices in which chametz is usually placed.

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The destruction of chametz at night refers to the statement חמירא כל, in which we nullify all the chametz of whose possession we are unaware. The chametz that we know about is either eaten or destroyed the next morning.
</i>t the beginning of the night of the fourteenth [of Nisan]. [They instituted the search at that time]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in contrast to the day of the fourteenth, when the prohibition against possessing chametz begins (<i>Pesachim</i> 4a).

Rav Yosef Karo accepts his opinion, but the Ramah does not. However, the <i>Taz</i> explains that leniencies may be made for public study sessions. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> go further and allow public study sessions even after nightfall, provided the subject matter is not overly involving.

Similarly, a wise man should not begin to study at this time, l<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> mentions that it is also improper to begin a meal at this time. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 431:2) also prohibits beginning work. Communal prayer is allowed.

a) it is appropriate to carry out a mitzvah as soon as possible;
b) at the beginning of the night, there is still some daylight left, which will facilitate the search (Ra'avad, Commentary on the <i>Rif</i>).

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.4,"We do not search [for chametz] by the light of the moon, the light of the sun<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> if one searches by day; i.e., either one forgot to search on the night of the thirteenth and had to carry out the search the following day. Alternatively, one decided to search for chametz before the fourteenth of Nisan with the intention of keeping the room chametz-free afterwards (Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Pesachim</i> 1:1). The light of the sun is insufficient to check indoor areas carefully.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.7,"We do not suspect that a weasel dragged chametz into a place where it is not usually brought.

Hence, the Sages decided to ignore this possibility entirely.

Nevertheless, a new search is required, for it is also possible that some chametz was left within the house (<i>Pesachim</i> 9a).
As mentioned in Halachot 2 and 3, according to Torah law we need not do anything more than negate our ownership over our chametz. Nevertheless, the Sages also required that we search for chametz and destroy it completely. However, when a person does not nullify his chametz, the obligation to search takes on the severity of a Torah commandment.
This and the following halachot (8 through 13) deal with circumstances which raise questions whether a second search is required. Throughout these halachot, the Rambam makes no mention of whether the owner of the house previously nullified his chametz or not. This fact is extremely important, for different principles apply to an obligation required by Torah law from those that apply to one instituted by the Rabbis. Indeed, other Rabbinic authorities (some of whom are quoted in the commentaries to the various halachot) devote much attention to this issue, clarifying at length whether the laws apply:

a) only when a person had already nullified (or can still nullify) his chametz, or;
b) even when the search for chametz is required by Torah law.

Since the Rambam does not explicitly state his opinion on this matter, it is impossible to be sure which perspective he adopts. However, when the chapter is considered in its entirety, it appears that these halachot describe a situation where chametz has already been nullified. Unless specified to the contrary, this should be assumed to be the case. Nevertheless, certain of the leniencies are also applicable even when the search takes on the severity of a Torah obligation.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 439:7) relates that he may stop the second search as soon as one loaf is found. He may presume that this was the loaf that he originally put aside.
</i>or definitely it was taken by a weasel or mouse.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
In contrast, the Rambam interprets the statement as applying before the search. There is no need to suspect that perhaps a rodent took chametz from a place where chametz is usually kept to a place where it is not usually brought. The Kessef Mishneh emphasizes that the two interpretations are not contradictory and both are halachically applicable.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.8,"Similarly, a person who saw a mouse enter the house with chametz in its mouth after he searched [for chametz] must search a second time<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In this instance as well, there is an obvious reason for the suspicion that chametz has been brought into the home.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.10,"Nine piles of matzah and one of chametz were placed [aside]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> For example, after the search for chametz, a person will still have some chametz in his property for use the following morning. However, he may already bring out his Passover matzot.

</i> were present in equal amounts<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The probability that the mouse took from the matzot is considered no greater than the probability that he took from the chametz.
This is a classic Talmudic case. <i>Pesachim</i> 9b draws a parallel to the following passage:

Nine butcher shops which all sell ritually slaughtered meat and one which sells meat which has not been slaughtered properly: should a person take meat from one of them without knowing from which he took (i.e., without knowing whether he purchased kosher or non-kosher meat), he must consider [the meat] forbidden because of the doubt involved.

In both cases, the permitted and forbidden substances remain in one place, and their existence is therefore considered as fixed (קבוע). In such instances, the fact that there is a much higher probability that the article in question was taken from the permitted substances is not considered significant, and the more stringent perspective is taken. See also <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot</i> 8:11.
Nevertheless, the Ra'avad and other authorities take issue with this halachah, explaining that the Talmud only made such a statement when a person has not nullified his chametz, and the responsibility to search the house stems from the Torah itself. However, if the person already nullified his chametz, the search is only a Rabbinic obligation. Hence, it should be judged more leniently.
The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that even though leniencies may generally be taken when doubts arise concerning Rabbinic obligations, the search for chametz is an exception. The entire obligation was instituted even when there was no definite knowledge that chametz existed. Hence, even in this case, a search must be made.
Though the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 439:1) accepts the Rambam's opinion, the Ramah and the other Ashkenazic authorities make the following qualification: If the person had already nullified his chametz and if the bread was small enough for the mouse to have eaten it entirely, a second search is not required.
</i>."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.11,"There were two piles: one of chametz and one of matzah, and two houses: one that had been searched and one that had not been searched. Two mice came; one took chametz and one took matzah [and they entered the houses] without our knowing which house the mouse holding the chametz entered<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In such an instance, we presume that the mouse holding the chametz entered the unchecked house, and the mouse holding the matzah entered the checked house. Comparable decisions are found in <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 13:14, <i>Hilchot Issurei Biyah</i> 9:29 and <i>Hilchot Mikvaot</i> 10:3.
<i>Pesachim</i> 10a emphasizes that this leniency is only rendered because once a person has nullified ownership over his chametz, the search is only a question of Rabbinic law. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 439:4) agrees to this principle, but offers an addition leniency: Even if the owner did not nullify his chametz, a second search is not required when the bread the mouse was holding is small enough to be eaten at once.
</i>...<br>Similarly, there were two houses which had been checked, with one pile of chametz before them. A mouse took [from the pile and entered a house]. However, we do not know which house he entered<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Each of the homes is judged individually. Since we do not definitely know that chametz was not brought into either of the homes, we need not change our original presumption and consider each one as free of chametz.
<i>Hilchot Sha'ar Avot HaTum'ah</i> 19:2 mentions a similar case, but reaches a more stringent conclusion. Leniency is only offered when the two people in question approach the Rabbis separately. If they come together, the case is judged more severely.
The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> both note this matter and explain that since the search for chametz is a question of Rabbinic law, greater leniency can be taken. Nevertheless, the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 439:2) and other Ashkenazic authorities do not accept this decision and require a second search, should the owners of both homes approach the court together.
</i>...<br>or we saw which one he entered, a person followed him, checked [for chametz], and did not find anything<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Pesachim</i> 10a compares this to a case in which a corpse was presumed to be found in a field. Though Rabbi Meir maintains that the field is considered ritually impure until the corpse is found, the halachah follows the Sages, who maintain that all that is necessary is to carry out a thorough search. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 439:6) states that this law applies even when the owner of the house had not nullified his chametz, and the search is required by Torah law.
</i>...<br>or he checked and found bread<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> we presume that this was the bread the mouse had taken. <i>Pesachim</i> 10a compares this to a case where a field was suspected to contain a grave; the field was searched, and a grave discovered. Though Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel requires the entire field to be searched, Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi maintains that no further search must be made.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (ibid.) emphasizes that this leniency should only be followed when the owner of the house has nullified or can still nullify the ownership over his chametz. Otherwise, he must thoroughly search the entire house.
</i>...<br>Similarly, when there were nine piles of matzah and one of chametz, and a loaf became separated from the piles, and we do not know whether it was chametz or matzah: If a mouse took the loaf that became separated and entered the house that had been checked<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The passage from <i>Pesachim</i> 9b concerning the ten butcher shops quoted in the commentary on the previous halachah, continues:

[If meat from these shops] is found, follow the majority.

The principle of קבוע - judging the permitted and forbidden substances as if they were equal - applies only when the doubt concerning the identity of the substance arises in the place where the presence of the forbidden substance has become fixed. Thus, since the meat has become separated (פירש) from its original place, this principle no longer applies and, as in most cases of mixtures, the decision depends on whether there is a greater number of kosher or non-kosher stores.
Similarly, in the case at hand: Since the loaf became separated from the piles before being taken by the mouse, there is no question of a prohibited substance having a fixed identity (קבוע). Hence, we follow the majority, and thus do not require a further search. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> emphasize that this leniency applies even if the owner of the house had not nullified the ownership over his chametz.
</i>:<br>In all of these cases, there is no need to check a second time<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> emphasizes that this is a complete thought in its own right.
</i>, because the presence of the forbidden substance is not fixed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> According to the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, this statement applies only to the final instance mentioned in the halachah as explained.
</i>."
Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.12,"A person who placed chametz in one corner and discovered it in another<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Pesachim</i> 10b explains that the Sages felt that it was likely that the chametz discovered was not the chametz lost. Rather, different chametz was placed in the other corner, and the first chametz, deposited elsewhere throughout the house. Hence, a new search is required (See also <i>Hilchot Mitamei Mishkav U'Moshav</i> 12:16.)
The Shulchan Aruch HaRav (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 439:9) states that if the same amount of chametz that was lost is found there is no need to search further if the owner had already nullified the ownership over his chametz. The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> grants an even greater leniency and frees the owner of the necessity to search, without placing any qualifications on the chametz discovered, as long as he has nullified his chametz.
</i>...<br>or who put aside nine loaves and found ten<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Pesachim</i> 10a compares this to the following case: ""A person put aside 100 dinars of money designated as <i>ma'aser sheni</i> (the second tithe, to be used only to purchase food in Jerusalem) and discovered two hundred.""
In <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 6:3, the Rambam declares that none of the money is considered as <i>ma'aser sheni</i>. In both instances, we suppose that the substance put aside was taken away and a new substance substituted for it. Accordingly, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> emphasizes that the owner cannot cease his search until he finds nine piles of chametz. This law applies even if the owner has nullified his ownership over the original nine piles of chametz.
</i>...<br>or a mouse came and took the chametz, and there is a doubt whether he entered this house or not<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Pesachim</i> 10a likens this to a case when a person traveled through a valley in which one of the fields was known to possess a grave. Though he is unsure of whether he entered the field containing the grave or not, he must consider himself ritually impure (See <i>Hilchot Sha'ar Avot HaTum'ah</i> 20:9.)
The Ra'avad's text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> contained an additional clause:

or there were nine piles of chametz and one pile of matzah: A loaf became separated from them and it is not known whether it was chametz or matzah. A mouse came and took it into a checked house.

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> rejects the inclusion of this clause because in the previous halachah, the Rambam had already stated that once a substance is separated from its original place, its identity is determined on the basis of the majority.

However, the <i>Tzafnat Paneach</i> differentiates between the two cases, explaining that our halachah refers to a pit to which a person could descend if required.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 442:28) explains that dough which has not become stuck to the cracks of the kneading trough must be removed. However, leniency may be taken regarding dough stuck in the cracks of the kneading trough, even though it does not serve a purpose. Should the owner nullify his ownership over his chametz, that dough need not be destroyed if:

a) the entire kneading trough contains less than an olive size of chametz stuck to its sides;

They argue that the only reason for leniency is that when the dough is stuck to the walls of the house, it is considered as part of the house and not as an entity in its own right.

The above represents the law itself. However, the Jews are holy and have customarily accepted greater stringencies upon themselves. They scrape away even the slightest amount of chametz, even if it is stuck to the walls of a home or utensil. They have accepted the stringency of scraping down all benches, chairs, and walls that have come into contact with chametz.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 2.17,"A person who rents out a house on the fourteenth [of Nisan]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> One might suppose that the sequence of this halachah and the following halachah should be reversed. First, the Rambam should state who is obligated to search for chametz, and only then the fact that we can rely that this search was properly carried out. Indeed, <i>Pesachim</i> 4 and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> follows that sequence when discussing these laws.
Possibly, the Rambam's choice of sequence can be explained as follows: The motivating principle of many of the previous halachot is that once a person has nullified the ownership over his chametz, the search is merely a Rabbinic obligation. Hence, many leniencies can be taken.
Because of that same principle...
</i>: Behold, [the tenant may operate] under the presumption that it has been searched<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Pesachim</i> 4b questions whether we can rely on this presumption or not and does not arrive at a conclusion. Nevertheless, the Rambam's statements can be understood in light of the <i>Pesakim</i> of Rabbenu Asher.

However, if he cannot possibly ask the owner, he need not search the house. However, this applies only when the tenant has the opportunity to nullify his ownership over any chametz that may be found within the home.
</i>.<br>[Furthermore,] even if we must assume that the person who rented out the house did not search [it]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and we know that before Pesach, chametz had definitely been kept within the home (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i>)

Otherwise, the statement of a woman or child may not be relied upon.
Generally, a woman's statements are accepted even as regards Torah prohibitions. However, an exception is made in this case because the search for chametz involves much effort. Hence, our Sages worried that perhaps a woman might state that she had made a thorough search even though she had merely made a superficial inspection (<i>Tosefot, Pesachim</i> 4b)

a) a child who does not need his mother to help him after he relieves himself;
b) a child who does not wake up in the night and call out: ""Mommy! Mommy!""

Nevertheless, based on <i>Eruvin</i> 82a, the Rambam provided us with a more definite guideline...
</i> - i.e., a child of five or six - is obligated [to fulfill the mitzvah] of sukkah according to Rabbinic decree<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> According to Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 48a) and the Ramban (<i>Milchamot Hashem, Berachot</i> 20b), there is no obligation incumbent on the child himself. The child's father is obligated to educate him. If he has no father, the obligation falls on his mother and on the local Rabbinic court (<i>Terumat Hadeshen</i> 99).
<i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 48a) differs and explains that the Sages placed the obligation on the minor himself. From the Rambam's phraseology, it appears that he accepts this view.
Support for this premise can be derived from the Rambam's decision in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 5:15-16, which states that an adult who ate a small meal can fulfill his obligation by listening to a child reciting the grace after meals (for both are obligated by virtue of Rabbinic decree). Though others object on the grounds that the child himself is not obligated in the mitzvah, the Rambam states that such a practice is acceptable.

</i> are freed from [fulfilling the mitzvah] of sukkah. This applies not only to a person who is dangerously ill<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> who is free from the obligation to perform all mitzvot, even those as severe as the Sabbath or Yom Kippur;
</i>, but also to one with a headache<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> or any other minor illness (Rambam, Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 2:4).
This leniency is granted because of one of the basic principles related to the mitzvah of sukkah. Leviticus 23:42 states: ""You shall dwell in sukkot (תשבו בסכת)."" On that verse, <i>Sukkah</i> 26a comments: תשבו כעין תדורו - i.e., dwelling in the sukkah is comparable to living in one's own home. Thus, a person is not required to dwell in a sukkah under circumstances which would cause him to leave his own home.
Since a person who is sick would seek the most comfortable lodgings possible and would not camp outside, he is not obligated to do so to fulfill the mitzvah of sukkah (Rabbenu Manoach).
</i> or a sore eye<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 26a relates that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel was granted permission to sleep outside the sukkah for this purpose.
The Torah's prohibitions are suspended not only when a person's life is in danger, but also when a particular limb might be lost. Though this premise is accepted by the Rambam (see <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 2:4), it does not appear that he is referring to it here. Rather, it seems that he means a minor ailment comparable to a headache. See also <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Sukkah</i>, ibid.).
</i>.<br>A person who is uncomfortable [when dwelling in the sukkah] is freed from the obligation [to fulfill the mitzvah] of sukkah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> based on the principle of תשבו כעין תדורו, as explained above. Just as a person would seek out a comfortable permanent dwelling, he is obligated to dwell only in a sukkah which does not cause him unpleasantness.
Rabbenu Manoach states that this leniency does not apply on the first night of Sukkot, on which there is a binding obligation to eat in the sukkah. (See Halachah 6.) The Ramah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 640:4) quotes this statement as halachah.

However, a sukkah which is constructed in a place where the discomfort will surely come is considered to be unfit to dwell in and is unacceptable for the performance of the mitzvah.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.3","A mourner<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The term אבל refers to a person in the seven days of mourning which follow the burial of a father, mother, wife, brother, sister, son, or daughter. An אונן (a person in mourning for these relatives before their burial) is freed from the obligation of sukkah, because he is absolved of the duty to perform all mitzvot (<i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 4:6).
It must be noted that none of the mourning rites should be followed during a festival. If a close relative dies before the festival, the <i>shiv'ah</i> (seven days of mourning) is completed at the festival's commencement, even though all seven days have not passed (<i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 10:3, 8).
</i> is obligated [to fulfill the mitzvah] of sukkah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 25b explains that a mourner (אבל) is obligated to fulfill all the mitzvot. Nevertheless, one might suppose that just as a person who is uncomfortable is freed from the obligation of sukkah, a mourner would also be absolved. Therefore, the Talmud includes a special teaching to emphasize the mourner's obligation, explaining that one is absolved only for discomfort which comes from external factors. In this case, the mourner brings discomfort upon himself. He should compose himself and concentrate his attention on the mitzvah.
Nevertheless, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (640:13) writes that if dwelling in a sukkah will cause a mourner more discomfort than dwelling in his home, he is allowed to choose the latter alternative.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.4","Emissaries charged with a mission involving a mitzvah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> e.g., to study Torah, to greet a Sage under whom one studied Torah, or to redeem captives (Rashi, <i>Sukkah</i> 25a).

</i> both during the day and at night<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rashi (<i>Sukkah</i> 25a, 26a) states that this applies even when they are lodging overnight. Since, at night they are also involved with thinking about how to fulfill the mitzvah, they are still considered as occupied with the performance of a mitzvah and are not required to seek out a sukkah. An example of this principle quoted by the Talmud supports this interpretation:

When Rav Chisda and Rabbah bar Rav Huna would attend [the lecture delivered] at the home of the exilarch on the Sabbath of the festival, they would sleep along the river banks of Sura.
They explained: ""We are emissaries involved in a mitzvah"" (<i>Sukkah</i> 26a).

Though these Sages were visiting a city which served as a center of Jewish life and surely could have found a sukkah to lodge in, they did not see the necessity for doing so. (See also <i>Sukkah</i> 10b.)
Nevertheless, <i>Tosafot, Sukkah</i> 10b, interprets the passage differently and explains that leniency is granted these emissaries only when dwelling in the sukkah would in some way prevent them from carrying out the mitzvah which they set out to perform. If it is possible to do both - perform the mitzvah they set out to do and fulfill the mitzvah of sukkah - one must endeavor to do so.
The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam shares Rashi's view. However, the final halachic position followed by most Ashkenazic authorities is closer to <i>Tosafot</i>'s position: i.e., these emissaries are not obligated to trouble themselves to find a sukkah. However, if there is a sukkah available, they should make use of it. Nevertheless, if sleeping in the sukkah would prevent them from getting proper rest, and thus hold them back from fulfilling their mitzvah in a proper manner, they are not required to sleep in a sukkah (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 640:18; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 640:38).
(Abstractly, it is possible to differentiate between the two positions as follows. According to Rashi, there is no obligation of sukkah incumbent on this person whatsoever. In contrast, <i>Tosafot</i> would maintain that the person is obligated to perform the mitzvah. However, at all times he is bound by another commitment which takes precedence.)

The Rambam's intent is that after the meal there is no necessity to keep one's plates in the sukkah, because they are not attractive and are generally stored in pantries outside the home. In contrast, it is customary in many communities not to bring pots into the sukkah, even while eating (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 639:5). [Needless to say, plates that must be washed must be removed from the sukkah.]
The printed (as opposed to certain manuscripts) text of Rashi (<i>Sukkah</i> 29a) also shares the Rambam's interpretation. <i>Tosafot</i> explains the passage slightly differently, rendering ""utensils used for food"" as ""utensils used in the preparation of food"" - i.e., pots and pans.

However, if the sukkah is small, it should be left outside the sukkah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> lest it cause a fire (<i>Tosafot, Sukkah</i>, ibid.). This differs from Rashi's interpretation of <i>Sukkah</i>, ibid., which explains that the Talmud is referring to an earthenware lamp. Thus, we may assume that it should not be brought into the sukkah because it is unattractive. This, appears to justify the statements of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, who writes that the lamp should not be brought into the sukkah when it is not burning. Both opinions are quoted by the later halachic authorities (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 639:3; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 639:7-8).

At times, even a rest of a few moments can have a major effect on a person. (See <i>Sukkah</i> 26a; Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Sukkah</i> 2:5.)
At present, there are many communities where leniency is taken in this regard. In some climates, the cold will cause everyone to consider sleeping in the sukkah as uncomfortable and, hence, they are freed of that obligation. Furthermore, in many communities, there is also a danger involved. In addition, if a husband would sleep in a sukkah, he would deprive his wife of some of the happiness and satisfaction that should accompany a festival. (See Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 639:2.)

There is a difference of opinion among the later halachic authorities if this decision also applies when one sits down to a party centering on drinking wine (קובע עצמו לשתות). Some (the <i>Bach</i> and <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 639:12) require that such drinking be carried out in a sukkah.

<i>Sukkah</i> 27a relates that Rabbi Elazar ben Shamu'a ate dates and grapes outside the sukkah, because ""fruit does not require a sukkah.""
Rabbenu Manoach and some other commentaries maintain that this leniency applies only to fruit. In contrast, meat, fish, cheese, and other substantial foods which form the basis of a meal must be eaten in a sukkah. While many later halachic authorities do not accept this view, some maintain that one should not sit down with company to a meal of such foods outside a sukkah. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 639:11; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 639:15.)

Similarly, on Sukkot one may eat foods that do not require consumption within a sukkah.
However, according to most authorities, his choice of words is not exact. The mitzvah of sukkah differs from that of matzah. In the latter instance, there is no mitzvah involved in eating matzah after the first night of the holiday. In contrast, every activity performed in the sukkah constitutes a further fulfillment of the mitzvah.
Accordingly, after the first night of the festival no special blessing is recited before partaking of matzah. In contrast, as stated in Halachah 12, a blessing is recited every time we make use of the sukkah. See also the Moznaim publication of <i>Hilchot Chametz U'Matzah</i> 6:1.

Similarly, one is required to eat festive meals on the first day of Sukkot in honor of the holiday. These meals must be eaten in the sukkah.

Rabbenu Nissim questions how the Sages' decree can negate the fulfillment of a mitzvah, and thus explains the last phrase to mean: ""You have never fulfilled the mitzvah as desired by our Sages.""

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.10","If rain descends, a person may enter his home<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The descent of rain on Sukkot implies that our actions are not desired by God. The Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 2:8) compares the matter to a servant who came to serve his master drink and the latter poured the pitcher in his face.
<i>Tzafenat Paneach</i> explains that there is a fundamental difference between this law and the case of a person who is uncomfortable while in the sukkah. In the latter instance, in essence, the person is obligated to fulfill the mitzvah. However, because of his discomfort, his obligation is temporarily waived. In contrast, when rain descends it is impossible to fulfill the mitzvah at all, because the sukkah is not fit to dwell in. Hence, there is no obligation whatsoever.
There is a practical difference between these two abstract positions regarding the question whether a person is obligated to eat in the sukkah on the first night of the holiday even when it rains. (See the commentary on Halachah 7.) According to the <i>Tzafenat Paneach</i>, under these circumstances there is no mitzvah which one is required to fulfill. Thus, one may eat at home. In contrast, most authorities do not differentiate between rain and other uncomfortable situations. Thus, since eating in the sukkah on that night is a binding obligation, they require a person to fulfill the mitzvah.
There is a further aspect to this concept. The Maharil explains that a person who eats in a sukkah when he is not obligated to do so is a simple person and receives no reward for his ""piety."" On this basis, in many communities, people make no effort to stay in the sukkah when it rains. In contrast, there are some communities where people will continue to eat in the sukkah despite pouring rain.
What is the difference between these two approaches? The first approach follows the perspective that, during the rain, there is no mitzvah to dwell in the sukkah whatsoever. Hence, there is no need to strain oneself to remain there. In contrast, the second perspective does not differentiate between rain and any other uncomfortable circumstances, but maintains that, in essence, dwelling in the sukkah is a mitzvah even under such circumstances. Accordingly, they remain in the sukkah, because while they are involved in fulfilling God's will they do not feel even the slightest trace of discomfort.
</i>. When is one permitted to leave [the sukkah]?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> We need not wait until the food actually spoils. As soon as enough rain descends to spoil the food, one is free to enter one's home (Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 639:5).

They are not stringent and allow the person to remain sleeping at home until he wakes up. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 639:7) quotes the Rambam's statements verbatim. However, the Ramah includes this leniency.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.12","Whenever a person enters a sukkah with the intention of sitting down throughout the seven [days of Sukkot], he should recite the following blessing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note the commentary on Halachah 7, which explains the difference between this law and the rules governing the blessing recited before eating matzah.
</i> before sitting<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam maintains that by sitting or doing any other activity which one would perform in one's home in the sukkah, one fulfills the mitzvah. Hence, the blessing is recited before one performs the mitzvah, as required by <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:2.
The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> questions why the blessing is not recited before one enters the sukkah, noting that the interpretation of the command לישב בסוכה is ""to dwell in the sukkah,"" not ""to sit in the sukkah."" However, the <i>Taz</i> 643:2 explains that merely passing through the sukkah is not part of the mitzvah. Rather, one must perform an activity that reflects ""dwelling."" Hence, the blessing is not recited until one sits down, because previously it is not obvious that one wants to perform a significant activity in the sukkah.
The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's decision, maintaining that one should recite the blessing only before partaking of a meal in the sukkah. This reflects the decision of the Ashkenazic authorities, who maintain that though the performance of all one's activities in the sukkah is a mitzvah, it is not customary to recite the blessing except when eating. When reciting the blessing on that occasion, one should intend to include all other activities. (See <i>Tur</i> and <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 639:8.)
</i>:

[Blessed are You...] who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to dwell in the sukkah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that there is no limit to the number of times one recites the blessing each day. Nevertheless, if one left the sukkah for a brief interval or left with the intent of performing an activity which would improve the sukkah, that departure is not considered an interruption and no blessing is required upon one's return.
</i>.

On the first night of the festival, one should first recite the blessing on the sukkah, and then the blessing for the occasion<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., the blessing <i>shehecheyanu</i>, which thanks God for enabling us to reach this occasion. This blessing is recited whenever one performs a mitzvah that can be fulfilled only from time to time (<i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:9).
That halachah and, similarly, <i>Sukkah</i> 46a, imply that, at the outset, one should recite the blessing <i>shehecheyanu</i> upon construction of the sukkah. Though the Rambam makes no mention of that concept here, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 641:1) states that one should have the construction of the sukkah in mind when reciting <i>shehecheyanu</i> at night.
</i>.<br>One should recite all the blessings over a cup of wine<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as did Rav Kahana (<i>Sukkah</i> 46a).

(See <i>Bnei Binyamin</i>.)
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though one might presume that <i>shehecheyanu</i> would be recited first, since it is more frequent, precedence is given to <i>leishev basukkah</i>, because it is ""the mitzvah of the day"" (Rabbenu Manoach).

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.13","At present<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in the Diaspora and in certain places in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> (<i>Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh</i>, Chapter 9)
</i>, when we celebrate holidays for two days<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> because originally, the messengers sent by the Sanhedrin could not reach there in time to notify them when the holiday should be celebrated. Hence, even now, when we follow the fixed calendar, we continue to follow this custom. (See <i>Hilchot Kiddush Hachodesh</i>, Chapters 3 and 5.)
</i>, we dwell in the sukkah for eight days<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In deference to the possibility that the festival could have begun on the second day and the seven days should be counted from then.
The commandment בל תוסיף (Deuteronomy 13:1  forbids adding to the mitzvot of the Torah. Indeed, in Halachot 11 and 14, we find certain safeguards instituted because of this commandment. Nevertheless, dwelling in the sukkah on the eighth day does not constitute a violation of this commandment, because the time when the mitzvah is to be performed has already passed. Placing a fifth passage in one's tefillin during the day violates this commandment, because we are obligated to perform the mitzvah at this time. However, once the seven days of Sukkot pass, there is no mitzvah associated with the sukkah whatsoever (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 28b).
Nevertheless, many Ashkenazic authorities would carry out additional safeguards regarding this matter. For example, the <i>Tur</i> relates (though he opposes this practice himself) that some follow the custom of eating in the Sukkah only on the day of Shemini Atzeret, but not the night. Many of the Rabbis who would sleep in the Sukkah throughout the festival refrain from doing so on Shemini Atzeret. (See <i>K'tav Sofer</i>, Responsum 120.)

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> because as the Rambam explains, a blessing is not recited when a mitzvah is performed only because of a doubt.
<i>Sukkah</i> 47a relates that ""Rav Huna bar Bizna and all the great Sages of the generation dwelled in a sukkah on the eighth day - which might have been the seventh day - [of the festival], but did not recite a blessing.""
</i>imilarly, a <i>tumtum</i> and an <i>androgynous</i> never recite the blessing <i>leishev basukkah</i>, because their obligation [to perform the mitzvah is based] on doubt, a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This follows the rationale that when there is a doubt concerning one's obligation in matters required by the Torah itself, one must follow the more stringent view. However, regarding obligations of a Rabbinic nature, one may opt towards leniency. Since the mitzvah is required by the Torah, even a person in doubt must perform it. However, the blessing is a Rabbinic requirement; hence, there is no necessity in reciting it. Furthermore, by reciting the blessing when one is not required, one uses God's name in vain.
This perspective is not accepted by all authorities. As explained in the commentary on Chapter 2, Halachah 1, the Ashkenazic practice is to allow women and others who are not obligated in the performance of a mitzvah to recite a blessing when fulfilling it.
The above applies only regarding the doubts concerning the obligations of a <i>tumtum</i> and an <i>androgynous</i>. However, on Shemini Atzeret, when there is a doubt concerning the obligation of the entire Jewish people even the Ashkenazic authorities would agree that a blessing should not be recited.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.15","A person who did not construct a sukkah [before the holiday] - whether intentionally or unintentionally<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 27b explains that not only a person whose sukkah fell down in the middle of the festival should reconstruct it, but even one who never built a sukkah at all is entitled to do so.

The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 2:7) explains that Rabbi Eleazar wanted to forbid a person who purposely did not build a sukkah from doing so during the festival, as a punishment for his failure to prepare for the festival. However, the Sages did not accept that premise.
A sukkah may not be constructed on the first day of the festival, even if the walls are already built and all that is necessary is to spread <i>s'chach</i> over it. However, even though certain types of work are forbidden on Chol Hamo'ed, there is no prohibition in this instance (<i>Bi'ur Halachah</i> 637).

One should even construct a sukkah on the final moments of the seventh day, because its mitzvah lasts throughout the seventh day.<br>The wood with which the sukkah was constructed is forbidden [to be used for other purposes]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> e.g., for use as a toothpick. This prohibition applies even in the event the sukkah falls. Also, in contrast to the decorations, as mentioned in the following halachah, this prohibition cannot be nullified by making a condition that one desires to use them for one's own purposes (Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 638:1).
</i> on all eight days of the festival<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 9a derives the prohibition against using the wood of the sukkah for other purposes throughout Sukkot from Leviticus 23:34: ""The Sukkot festival shall be seven days unto God."" The latter term is used also regarding the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering sacrificed on the festival. Thus, its use in this context implies that the entities which enable us to celebrate the Sukkot festival must be consecrated ""unto God"" like those sacrifices.
The reason why the wood of the sukkah may not be used on the eighth day is explained below.

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rabbenu Asher differs and explains that the essential element of the sukkah is its <i>s'chach</i>. Hence, the prohibition applies only to the <i>s'chach</i> and not to the sukkah walls. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 638:1) quotes the Rambam's opinion. However, the <i>Taz</i> (638:1) explains that the prohibition against using the walls is only Rabbinic in nature.
Rav Chayim Soloveitchik explains that though the word sukkah as used by the Torah refers to the <i>s'chach</i> and not to the walls, a different principle is involved in this instance. The Torah teaches us that all the entities which enable us to fulfill the mitzvah of sukkah may not be used for other purposes. Since the sukkah walls also serve that purpose, because a sukkah is not kosher without walls, they are also included in that prohibition.

As mentioned in the commentary on Halachot 17 and 18, the sukkah decorations are not considered an independent entity, but rather as part of the sukkah itself. Furthermore, employing articles used to decorate a mitzvah for other purposes demonstrates lack of respect for the mitzvah (Rabbenu Nissim, <i>Beitzah</i>).

The Ramban and the Ramah differ, and require that the person stipulate that he will not refrain from using the decorations during the entire period of <i>beyn hash'mashot</i> of each of the eight days of the festival.

In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Keilim</i> 18:8), the Rambam also mentions <i>tefillin</i> of the head in which four separate compartments are sewn together. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 32:58 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 32:172 write that <i>tefillin</i> made in this manner or by gluing the four compartments together are acceptable. They nevertheless suggest that it is preferable to purchase <i>tefillin</i> that are made from a single piece of leather.
[At present, frequently, <i>tefillin</i> which are made from four compartments that are either sewn or glued together are referred to as <i>peshutot</i> and sold for a substantially lower price than <i>tefillin</i> made from a single piece of leather. The difficulty in purchasing them extends beyond one's willingness to opt for the more lenient opinion mentioned in the above sources.

Since there is a difference between <i>tefillin</i> and a Torah scroll - in a Torah scroll, there are many other passages between <i>Shema</i> and <i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i> - the <i>tefillin</i> are not disqualified if <i>V'hayah im shamo'a</i> is written as <i>p'tuchah</i>.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states that the Rambam's opinion should be followed. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:26) offers a compromise, which satisfies, according to his interpretation, both the Rambam's and Rabbenu Asher's views. His interpretation, however, is not accepted by all authorities.

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 2.3","One must be careful regarding [the spelling of the words in these passages] with regard to the short or full form<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There are times when the Hebrew vowels <i>cholam</i> and <i>shuruk</i> are written with a letter <i>vav</i>, and times when that letter is omitted. Similarly, there are times when the vowel <i>chirik</i> is written with a <i>yud</i>, and times when that letter is omitted.
The expression, <i>malei</i>, rendered as ""full form,"" refers to the form which includes the extra letter. <i>Chaseir</i>, rendered as ""short form,"" refers to the form which lacks the extra letter.
</i>. [The manner in which] these four passages are written [in <i>tefillin</i>] should resemble the manner they are written in a Torah scroll that has been checked [for accuracy in this regard]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In this context, note the comments of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:20) and <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (32:33), which elaborate on the responsibility of a scribe.
</i>.<br>When one writes a word which requires a short form using a full form, it is invalid until one erases the extra letter<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned above, every letter of the four passages in the <i>tefillin</i> must be written in order. Nevertheless, although an entire passage was written, correcting a word by erasing an extra letter is not a contradiction to this principle.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:23) mentions that a problem may arise if the letter to be erased is in the middle of a word, since, when it is erased, the space left will cause the word to appear divided. The commentaries explain that the difficulty can sometimes be corrected by extending a letter, for example, writing a <i>resh</i> with an extended upper line.
</i>. If one writes a word which requires a full form using a short form, it is invalid and may not be corrected<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Because the additional letter will not have been written in the proper order.
</i>.<br>These are [the correct spellings of the words that could present difficulties] with regard to the short and full forms in these four passages<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's inclusion of these particulars in the next four halachot is a clear expression of the desire he expressed in his introduction to the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, to compose a text that will serve as ""a compilation of the entire Oral Law,"" that would allow a person to ""comprehend the entire Oral Law from it without having to study any other text."" He saw the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> as a guide to the performance of the mitzvot, and therefore included in it details that would allow every individual to understand - and thus carry out - the minute particulars involved in the fulfillment of each mitzvah.
1. The Rambam does not use the expression, ""short form,"" because the <i>chirik</i> of the <i>alef</i> possesses a <i>yud</i>. Similarly, the Rambam states ""without a <i>vav</i>"" or ""without a <i>yud</i>"" in several other instances in these halachot, because the form of the word is neither short or full in its entirety.<br>
 2. Generally, the word is written ידך. <i>Menachot</i> 37a explains that this departure from the norm was intended to teach us that <i>tefillin</i> are worn on the left hand, as explained in the commentary on Chapter 4, Halachah 2.<br>
 3. There are three sizes of letters in the Torah - the normal size, an enlarged size, and a reduced size - as mentioned in Chapter 7, Halachah 8. The <i>Baal HaTurim</i> notes that <i>ayin</i> and <i>dalet</i> spell the word <i>eid</i>, which means ""witness."" The <i>Shema</i> describes God's oneness. By reciting this verse and placing it in their <i>tefillin</i> and <i>mezuzot</i>, the Jews serve as witnesses, testifying to that oneness.<br>
 4. The Rambam also discusses the subject of crowns in Chapter 7, Halachot 8-9. When discussing this matter, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 36:3) mentions the obligation to place crowns on the letters, שעטנ""ז ג""ץ. The obligation of placing crowns on these letters is explicitly mentioned in the Talmud, <i>Menachot</i> 29b. Hence, they are regarded with greater stringency.
Afterwards, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> also states that there are scribes who customarily place crowns on other letters. Significantly, even in Yemen, where the Rambam's directives are usually adhered to precisely, an exception is made in this instance, and there are different customs with regard to the crowns placed upon letters.
5. <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (36:5) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (36:15) require that one add any crowns that are lacking in the passages. This refers, however, to the crowns on the letters, שעטנ""ז ג""ץ, and not to the crowns required by the Rambam.

[The <i>Shulchan Aruch's</i> directive and the importance of checking <i>tefillin</i> today must be emphasized, because many scribes, particularly those who write inexpensive <i>tefillin</i>, are not experts. Very frequently, people have purchased <i>tefillin</i> only to find that the passages are not acceptable. For this reason, the Rabbis have suggested buying only <i>tefillin</i> that have been written and inspected by an expert.]

Though this decision is quoted in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 39:10), a qualification is already made. A pair of <i>tefillin</i> which is not worn on a regular basis should be checked twice in seven years. The later authorities (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 39:11 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 32:26) suggest checking even <i>tefillin</i> that are worn regularly. At present, perhaps because of the differences in the way the compartments are made or in the parchment or ink that is used, it is very common for letters in <i>tefillin</i> to smudge, fade, and crack. The <i>Mateh Efrayim</i> suggests that each person have his <i>tefillin</i> inspected every year. Even authorities who are not that stringent recommend periodic checks.

Alternatively, a person will be far more motivated to study in a new scroll which he produced himself.
</i>. If a person writes the scroll by hand, it is considered as if he received it on Mount Sinai<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Taking the effort to write the scroll oneself indicates that, had the person lived at the time the Torah was given, he also would have joined the Jews in traveling to Mount Sinai to receive it (<i>Nimukei Yosef, Menachot</i>).
</i>. If he does not know how to write<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> a scroll according to all the particular halachic requirements
</i> himself, [he should have] others write it for him<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., he should hire a scribe or purchase a Torah scroll. <i>Menachot</i> 30a states: ""A person who purchases a Torah scroll in the public market is like someone who grabs a mitzvah in the marketplace."" Rashi maintains that purchasing a Torah scroll fulfills a mitzvah, but the mitzvah is not as complete as if one had written the scroll oneself. The Ramah, however, states (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 270:1) that if a person merely purchases a Torah scroll without checking it, he does not fulfill the mitzvah at all.
Note the statements of the <i>Tevuot Shor</i>, which explain that if another person can perform a mitzvah in a more complete manner than one is able to do oneself, it is preferable to commission him to do so as one's agent. In this instance, since most people cannot write a Torah scroll as attractive and halachically accurate as a professional scribe, it is preferable to hire the latter to write one's scroll.
</i>.<br>Anyone who checks even a single letter of a Torah scroll is considered as if he wrote the entire scroll<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Unless the scroll is checked, it cannot be used (See Halachah 12). Checking also involves effort.
In his <i>Hilchot Sefer Torah</i>, Rabbenu Asher explains that, at present, this mitzvah is also fulfilled by writing <i>chumashim</i>, texts of the Talmud, and other books of Torah law. This concept is also quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 270:2).
The <i>Turei Zahav</i> (270:4) explains that Rabbenu Asher's intention was not that there is no longer a mitzvah in writing a Torah scroll (for it is impossible that a change in circumstance will nullify a Biblical command), but that the original mitzvah has been extended to include these other texts.
Since even according to Rabbenu Asher's view, there is a mitzvah for each person to write a Torah scroll for himself, it is difficult to comprehend why we do not see many individuals trying to fulfill this mitzvah. This question is particularly pertinent in light of the Rambam's statements at the conclusion of the list of positive commandments in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, where he describes the writing of a Torah scroll as a mitzvah which a person is obligated to fulfill.
It is possible to explain that since many people are not capable of actually writing a Torah scroll themselves and do not have the financial resources to purchase one and check it, they fulfill this mitzvah through purchasing letters in a Torah scroll written by the community (<i>Pit'chei Teshuvah</i> 270:1; <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 24).

</i>, one is obligated to hire a teacher for one's son<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> questions the source for this ruling. He quotes Rav Yosef Kolon, who explains that since we find that the teachers of children are allowed to charge for their services (Halachah 7), it is obvious that the fathers are required to pay them. Others explain that since the obligation is placed upon a father's person, we may assume that it extends to his financial resources as well.
Since a person is obligated to pay for his children's studies, he cannot deduct those costs from the tithe he is required to give to charity. Nevertheless, there is no need to stint in fulfilling this obligation. <i>Beitzah</i> 16a relates that a person's income for the entire year is fixed, with the exception of the money he spends to prepare for the Sabbaths and festivals, and that spent in teaching his sons Torah. With regard to these matters, if he spends more, he will be granted more, and if he spends less, he will be granted less.
In addition, once children pass the age of six, the cost of their living expenses can be deducted from one's tithes if their time is being devoted to Torah study (<i>Hilchot Matnot Ani'im</i> 10:16).
The commentaries question whether the obligation to pay for a teacher applies to one's grandson as well. The Maharshal and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) impose such a requirement, while the Radbaz frees one of the obligation.
</i>, while one is not required to undertake any expense to teach a colleague's son<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as part of one's obligation to teach Torah. Nevertheless, every Jew is obligated to give charity, and one of the most important priorities (particularly, at present) for charity is the education of children. (See Ramah, <i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 163:3; <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>, <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 1:3.)

</i>Similarly, in every place, one finds that study takes precedence over deed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., the performance of mitzvot. <i>Kiddushin</i> 40b relates that:
Rabbi Tarfon and the elders were dining in the loft of Bet Nitzah in Lod. This question was asked before them: Is study greater or is deed greater?<br>
Rabbi Tarfon replied: ""Deed is greater.""<br>
Rabbi Akiva replied: ""Study is greater.""<br>
All of them replied: ""Study is greater...""
</i>, for study brings about deed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The commentaries explain that Rabbi Tarfon maintains that a Jew's ultimate goal in life is the fulfillment of God's will as revealed in the mitzvot. By performing the mitzvot, a person steps beyond his humanity and performs Godly acts, thus establishing a connection with God's essence.
Rabbi Akiva maintains that study is also a mitzvah, and thus, by doing so, one also fulfills God's will. Furthermore, through study a person can internalize his connection to Godliness and reveal the connection to Him, not only in the realm of deed, but also in thought.
The Sages maintain that a person must be complete in both deed and study. Therefore, study has an advantage, for study leads to deed. In particular, this applies to a person who has never studied (see <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Kiddushin</i>, <i>ibid.</i>) for, unless he studies, he will never be able to perform the mitzvot properly.

The recitation of these verses refines his power of speech and makes lasting impressions on his thinking processes, even though he is unaware of their intellectual message.

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> 2:2 explains that this decision is no contradiction to the Mishnah in <i>Avot</i> quoted above. The latter can be interpreted to mean ""after completing five years"" - i.e., at the beginning of the sixth year. However, the <i>Sefer Mitzvot Gadol</i> (Positive Commandment 12) interprets the injunction from <i>Avot</i> to mean that when the child becomes five, his father teaches him to read at home, and when he becomes six or seven, he is taken to school. It is also possible to interpret the Rambam's words in this fashion.
[Indeed, that interpretation is more likely. Thought the above mentioned mishnah states: ""at eighteen, one should marry,"" the Rambam (<i>Hilchut Ishut</i> 15:2) states a man is obligated to marry at the age of seventeen. Thus, we see that he interprets the different clauses of the Mishnah to mean ""in his ...th year, one should...""]

</i> written Torah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Karo notes that the Rambam's language implies that this constitutes the totality of a father's obligation, and he is not obligated to instruct his son in the Oral Law. In the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 245:6), he explains that a father's obligation also includes arranging for his son's instruction in the Oral Law, unless his financial situation is too pressing to allow him to do so.

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Nedarim</i> 37a relates that the wage a teacher receives is not for his actual tutelage, but rather for the effort involved in caring for the children. Alternatively, the money can be taken for teaching the proper cantillation notes. [At that time, there were few if any written texts, and the students were taught the entire Torah by heart.]

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his commentary on <i>Nedarim</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, Rabbenu Nissim quotes the Jerusalem Talmud, which allows a teacher of Torah to receive compensation for the fact that were he not to teach, he could occupy himself in another profession which would yield him profit. The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> develops this matter further, noting that <i>Ketubot</i> 106a relates that the Temple treasury would pay people to instruct the priests regarding the laws of ritual slaughter. He also notes that authors of works of Torah scholarship are allowed to demand pay for their services. These ideas are quoted as halachah by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> and the Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 246:5).
Nevertheless, it is highly unlikely that the Rambam would accept such an opinion. In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i>), he writes:
According to our Torah, it is in no way permitted to take a wage for teaching any one of the Torah's professions...<br>
I am amazed at the men of stature who, aroused by desire, denied the truth and had wages designated for themselves for Torah decisions and teachings, using flimsy supports.

Thus, it can be derived that it is forbidden to charge to teach Torah even though one's teacher charged to instruct him<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his Commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam interprets <i>Avot</i> 4:7, which states: 'Do not make it (the Torah) an axe to chop with...' do not consider it a medium with which to derive a livelihood."" He continues elaborating on how it is both undesirable - and forbidden - to derive benefit from Torah study or its instruction:
Some people thought foolishly that it is obligatory and fitting to support the wise men and students...who occupy themselves in Torah study...This is all erroneous. No source in the Torah or in the words of the Sages can be found to...support it.<br>
Among the Sages [of the Talmud], one does not find that they asked for money from other people. They did not receive any funding for their precious and glorious Yeshivot...<br>
Heaven forbid to say that those generations were not generous and did not give charity. Had a poor person stretched out his hand, they would have filled it with gold and pearls. But the poor person did not do so; rather, he was satisfied with what he could earn in his profession, whether a little or a lot...<br>
Hillel the Elder was a wood-chopper who would study before Shemayah and Avtalion and live in extreme poverty. He was so great that his students were compared to Moses and Aaron...There is no doubt that if he had taught the people to give him benefit, they would not have allowed him to continue chopping trees...<br>
The Sages would not allow themselves to take money from people. They considered taking such funds as a desecration of God's name in public, because the people would thus consider Torah as similar to any other profession and come to scorn it.

In contrast, Rabbi Eleazar ben Chersom was extremely wealthy:
His father left him one thousand villages on land and one thousand ships at sea.

However, even a person who does not make such an all-encompassing commitment to Torah must find time for study despite his family responsibilities.
</i>, he must establish a fixed time for Torah study during the day and at night, as [Joshua 1:8] commands: ""You shall think about it day and night<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There are two aspects to Torah study:<br>
a) One which requires total devotion, dedicating all of one's time and effort to Torah, because ""the study of Torah has no limit."" Though it is fitting for each Jew to apply himself to Torah study in this fashion, such a practice cannot be required of a person. Rather, this remains a voluntary decision to be made by a person, to quote Chapter 3, Halachah 6, ""whose heart inspires him to fulfill this mitzvah in a fitting manner and to become crowned with the crown of Torah.""<br>
b) The establishment of fixed times for Torah study. Regardless of the responsibilities and difficulties a person may have, he is obligated to set aside a certain portion of his day for Torah study.
On Psalms 119:126: ""It is a time to act for God. They have made void Your Torah,"" our Sages commented: ""Those who have established fixed times for Torah (i.e., ""a time to act for God"") have 'made void your Torah.
The <i>Sh'lah</i> (<i>Masechet Shavuot</i>) questions that statement, noting that the establishment of fixed times for Torah is considered of fundamental importance. He resolves the contradiction by explaining that a person who is overburdened by financial responsibilities can be expected only to ""establish fixed times for Torah study."" However, someone who is free of financial burdens must devote himself totally to Torah study. For him, keeping to fixed times represents ""making void the Torah.""
<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 3:4) mentions these concepts, but also emphasizes a person's potential for achievement. An individual who has the potential to achieve in Torah study should devote himself to this goal. In contrast, a person whose abilities are limited should establish fixed times for Torah study and devote his energies to business affairs, using that income to support Torah scholars.
The above concepts can be related to a more general discussion in <i>Berachot</i> 35b. The Talmud notes the apparent contradiction between Joshua 1:8, which commands ""This Torah shall not depart from your mouth"" and Deuteronomy 11:14, which relates how ""you will collect your grain, your wine, and your oil,"" implying an involvement in work and commerce.
Rabbi Yishmael explains that a person should follow ""the way of the world,"" involving himself in work and devoting only part of his energies to Torah study. In contrast, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai exclaims: ""If a person will plow in the plowing season, sow in the sowing season,...what will happen to the Torah! Rather, when the Jews do God's will, their work is performed by others.""
The Talmud concludes: Many followed Rabbi Yishmael's advice and were successful. Many followed Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai's advice and were not successful.
Though the complete and total dedication demanded by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai is beyond the reach of all at present, the passage is useful in order to appreciate two different approaches to the obligation of Torah study:<br>
a) That of Rabbi Yishmael, who sees it as a responsibility to be considered within the context of our daily activities;<br>
b) That of Rabbi Shimon, who sees Torah study as the paramount aspect of a person's life, to which he should be devoted without considering the demands of his financial position.

According to <i>Siftei Cohen, Choshen Mishpat</i> 25:7, the term <i>Mishnah</i> applies to the halachic decisions of contemporary authorities as well. Thus, today, study of texts like the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> would fulfill this goal.

Similarly, by understanding the process by which a halachic concept is developed, one can understand how similar laws could be derived.

</i>he matters referred to as <i>Pardes</i> are considered part of the <i>Gemara</i>.<br>T<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam offered this explanation to resolve the apparent contradiction between the commonly accepted practice of devoting most of one's time to the study of the Babylonian Talmud, and the injunction to divide one's study time in three. In response to the same question, <i>Tosafot, Kiddushin</i> 30a explains that the study of the Babylonian Talmud also fulfills that directive, because it combines all three areas of study in a single text.
At present, this pattern of study is not followed even in the early stages of a child's learning. Note the Maharal of Prague, <i>Tiferet Yisrael</i>, Chapter 56, and the <i>Sh'lah, Masechet Shavuot</i>, who complain that the advice given in <i>Avot</i> 5:22: ""At five, to the study of the Written Law; at ten, to the study of the Mishnah; and at fifteen, to the study of the Gemara"" is not generally followed.
The basis for this departure can be explained in terms of two differences that exist between our contemporary circumstances and the situation which prevailed in Talmudic times:<br>
a) During the Talmudic era, written texts were rare, and it was necessary for a student to commit all his subject matter to memory. Thus, the emphasis was on teaching students by rote.<br>
b) Hebrew was a spoken language and, therefore, it was not necessary to spend time teaching the children the meaning of the subject matter.
At present, the major emphasis is on teaching learning skills and developing a student's powers of comprehension with the understanding that once one knows how to study, since the texts are easily available, he will be able to apply himself to the actual study at his convenience. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 1:6, 11; <i>Eglei Tal</i>, Introduction.)

Torah Study 1.13,"A woman who studies Torah will receive reward<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for her efforts.
</i>. However, that reward will not be [as great] as a man's, since she was not commanded [in this mitzvah].

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Tosafot, Kiddushin</i> 31a explains that a person who is commanded to perform a mitzvah will be more conscious of his obligation and try to fulfill it more fastidiously than a person who performs the same act voluntarily.
</i>.<br>Even though she will receive a reward, the Sages commanded that a person should not teach his daughter Torah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There is no explicit source for the Rambam's statements, though one may draw such a conclusion from <i>Sotah</i> 20a. That passage relates that one prominent sage, ben Azzai, did not share this opinion.
As mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 1, the Rabbis require a woman to study the laws governing the mitzvot which she is obligated to fulfill. Based on that decision, many commentaries explain that the Rambam's statements refer only to intensive study of the subject matter described as <i>Gemara</i> in the previous halachot.
</i>, because most women<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Commentaries have mentioned that by adding the word ""most,"" the Rambam implies that if a father sees that his daughter is capable of such study, he should afford her the opportunity.
</i> cannot concentrate their attention on study, and thus transform the words of Torah into idle matters because of their lack of understanding<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> notes the contrast between the first clause, ""A woman who studies,"" and the command the Sages gave ""a father."" He differentiates between study that a woman undertakes voluntarily, which is considered desirable, and a father's training his daughter in matters which are not necessarily relevant to her.
</i>.<br>[Thus,] our Sages declared:<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sotah</i> 21b
</i> ""Whoever teaches his daughter Torah is like one who teaches her tales and parables<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Sotah</i> 3:3). From <i>Sotah</i> 21b, it would appear that <i>tiflos</i> (translated as “idle matters”) could be understood as ""romance."" The Meiri renders it as ""vanity,"" explaining that a woman who has studied will boast of her achievements.
</i>."" This applies to the Oral Law. [With regard to] the Written Law: at the outset, one should not teach one's daughter. However, if one teaches her, it is not considered as if she was taught idle things<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though the Rambam's statements are quoted in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 246:6), the source for his statements has been questioned.
Some point to the Mishnah, <i>Nedarim</i> 3:3, which, in passing, mentions a daughter's study of the Written Law. However, the Rambam's own text of that Mishnah lacks the words ""or daughter."" Others point to <i>Chaggigah</i> 3a (and more specifically, to the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>ibid.</i> 1:1), which describes the reading of the Torah by the king during the <i>Hakhel</i> celebration, which women were also required to attend. Nevertheless, there is a difference between study of the Written Law in its entirety and hearing the reading of a few inspirational passages. (See <i>Taz</i> 246:4.)
In this context, it might be noted that the <i>Tur's</i> text of the Rambam reverses these statements and mentioned teaching women the Oral Law as preferable to the Written Law. This can easily be reconciled with the opinions mentioned above, which require a woman to learn the laws governing the mitzvot she is obligated to fulfill. In contrast, the Written Law is a less closely defined field of study. There, a greater possibility exists that a woman who is not gifted may misinterpret the teachings.

The commentaries maintain that, according to the Rambam, Rav Nachman was telling the exilarch that if the doors were not attached before the <i>mezuzah</i> was affixed, it is invalid. Since an entrance without doors does not require a <i>mezuzah</i>, affixing it before the doors would create a problem: as explained in Chapter 5, Halachah 8, the doors must be affixed first.

The Temple is not ""your home,"" a private dwelling, and therefore does not require a <i>mezuzah</i>.
The <i>Chatam Sofer</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i>, Responsum 281) asks: Since the Chamber of Parhedrin was the only portion within the Temple Courtyard used as a person's dwelling, why does the Rambam state that these entrances do not require <i>mezuzot</i> because they are consecrated? Since they are not used as a dwelling, why would one think they require a <i>mezuzah</i>?
The <i>Chatam Sofer</i> explains that the Temple is a dwelling - in fact, the ultimate dwelling, the resting place of the Divine Presence. Nevertheless, since it is not a dwelling for humans, it does not require a <i>mezuzah</i>.

The Gate of Nicanor required a <i>mezuzah</i> because it was the gate directly before the Chamber of Parhedrin. As explained in Halachah 8, the gate of a courtyard which leads to a dwelling requires a <i>mezuzah</i>. Based on this rationale, Rav Kapach asks why the gates before the Gate of Nicanor did not require a <i>mezuzah</i>, since they led to a gate which led to a dwelling.

He does explain, however, that the Rambam's version is acceptable: Since all these gates lead to the Chamber of Parhedrin, they therefore require a <i>mezuzah</i>.
Rav Kapach supports this interpretation, noting that the Chamber of the Hearth also served as a dwelling for the priests, and hence, the gate to it would require a <i>mezuzah</i>. According to this interpretation, this gate is also included, while according to our text of the Talmud, it is not.

A house requires a <i>mezuzah</i> only when a person dwells in it. Accordingly, since these structures are not used for that purpose, they do not require a <i>mezuzah</i>.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.1,"A person who prays must be careful to tend to [the following] eight matters<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The specific laws regarding these eight categories are discussed by the Rambam in the ensuing halachot of this chapter.

In the previous chapter, the Rambam listed five categories which are of absolute necessity for prayer. A person who fails to fulfill any of those requirements must repeat his prayers. These eight categories are לכתחילה (at the outset) necessary for the <i>Amidah</i>, but, do not disqualify the prayer if they were not tended to.
The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> points out that even Chapter 4 refers to certain actions which were only problematic לכתחילה, such as burping and sneezing. Nevertheless, they are included in that chapter because, from a topical perspective, it is more appropriate to discuss them within the context of the general categories mentioned there.

From this discussion, we may conclude that, under these circumstances, it is acceptable for one to remain seated during the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> if doing so will contribute to one's ability to concentrate.

Rav Chiya and Rabbi Shimon bar Rebbe were sitting together.

The other said that one's eyes should be pointed upwards, as [Eichah 3:41] states: ""Let us lift up our hearts with our hands [towards God in Heaven].""<br>
Rabbi Yishmael, the son of Rabbi Yossi, came and asked them what they were doing. They answered that they were discussing the <i>Amidah</i>. He [Rabbi Yishmael] said: My father said: One praying should set his eyes downwards and his heart upwards in order to fulfill both of those verses.

Rashi explains that in these instances as well, one will fear that they will fall and injure him or become lost or ruined.
Based on Rashi's statements, there are authorities who rule that a person may hold an object which would not present a danger or causes worry if it falls, e.g., a notebook. Rabbenu Yonah, however, forbids the holding of any object except the lulav, which is explicitly mentioned in the Talmud. This is also the position of <i>Terumat Hadeshen</i>. (Even according to the latter view, one may hold a prayerbook.)
<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 96:1) rules that one may also hold other objects (in line with Rashi's position), but states that the optimum manner of performing the mitzvah is not to hold anything, so that his hands may be clasped together over his heart, as the Rambam mentions in Halachah 4.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.6,"Proper place: What is implied?<br>One should stand in a low place a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 5b bases this law on Isaiah 38:2: ""And Chizkiyahu turned his face towards the wall and prayed.""
In his responsa, the Rambam explains that the intent of this law is that one should not have anything before him that will disrupt his concentration on the <i>Amidah</i>. (See <i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 90)
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> and the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 90:21) discuss this concept. Among their conclusions are that people do not constitute a separation between a person praying and the wall, nor do small objects less than 10 handbreadths (approximately 80 centimeters) tall.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 10b bases this law on the premise, ""there is no loftiness before God, as [Psalms 130:1] states: 'From the depths, I call out to you, God.'”

In his responsum, the Rambam mentions that this halachah applies only to a house, as explicitly mentioned in the Talmud and not necessarily to a synagogue. However, the <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) quotes the <i>Zohar</i> (Vol. II, p. 251a), which requires a synagogue to have 12 windows, which correspond to the 12 <i>seraphim</i> in the Heavenly Court. He also quotes this law in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 90:4).
Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 34b) explains that windows are an aid to concentration, as one looks heavenward and is humbled. Rabbenu Yonah suggests that the light has a calming effect, allowing one to concentrate on his prayers.
</i> that face Jerusalem and pray opposite them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in keeping with the obligation to face Jerusalem mentioned in Halachah 3.

</i>.""<br>A person should establish a fixed place where he always prays<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 6b states: ""Anyone who establishes a fixed place for his prayer will be assisted by the God of Abraham."" Abraham is mentioned because, as can be inferred from Genesis 19:27, he had a fixed place for prayer.
The Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 4:4, states that even in a synagogue, a person should have a fixed place for prayer and should not move from place to place.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 90:19 quotes this law. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> adds that within four cubits (approx. six feet) of one's place is also considered acceptable, since it is impossible to be in exactly the same spot at all times. Therefore, a person who finds a colleague sitting in one's place in the synagogue, may pray within four cubits of his place. This is preferable to embarrassing the person sitting in his seat, who might very well be a visitor and not be aware of which seats are occupied by regular congregants.
</i>. One should not pray in a destroyed building<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This halachah is derived within the context of the following narrative (<i>Berachot</i> 3a):
Rabbi Yossi said: Once I was walking on the road and I entered one of the destroyed buildings of Jerusalem in order to pray. Eliyahu [the Prophet] of blessed memory came and waited for me by the entrance until I had finished praying.<br>
After I finished my prayer, he greeted me: ""Peace unto you, Rebbe.""<br>
I replied to him: ""Peace unto you, Rebbe and teacher.""<br>
He asked me: ""My son, why did you enter this destroyed building?""<br>
I answered him: ""To pray.""<br>
He told me: ""You should have prayed in the road.""
The Talmud mentions that one should never enter a destroyed building on any account. Nevertheless, since the Talmud made this statement regarding Rabbi Yossi's prayer, the Rambam teaches the laws concerning destroyed buildings here in <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).
</i>, nor [should one pray] behind a synagogue, unless he turns his face towards the synagogue.<br>I<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 31b refers to Chanah's prayers for a son and her subsequent remarks to Eli, the priest: ""I am the woman who stood here with you"" (I Samuel 1:26 . This verses indicates that Eli, as well as Chanah, was standing at the time.
Rabbenu Yonah also mentions that this applies only to a person sitting idly, but one studying or reciting the <i>Shema</i> need not worry and may continue to sit.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 6b states: ""Anyone praying behind a synagogue is called wicked,... this applies only when he faces away from the synagogue, but if he faces the synagogue there is no problem.""
Rashi (in <i>Berachot</i> 6b) states that by facing away from the synagogue when one prays, one appears to deny God who is worshiped within. Therefore, even if facing the synagogue requires one to turn away from Jerusalem, it is desirable.
<i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Eruvin</i> 18b, explains that this refers to a person standing on the side of the door facing away from the synagogue, and thus towards the opposite direction of those worshipping inside. Therefore, he must simply turn the other way and solve the problem. <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> suggests that “behind a synagogue” may even refer to standing on the side of the synagogue and looking away.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 90:7) mentions all these possibilities and rules that one should refrain from praying in any of these places.
</i>t is forbidden to sit down next to someone in the midst of the <i>Amidah</i> or to pass in front of him<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for walking in front of someone will disrupt that person's concentration.
Rabbenu Yonah (commenting on <i>Berachot</i> 27a) explains that this refers only to ""in front of him,"" but not to the side.
The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 102:5) points out that the <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Parshat Chayei Sarah</i>) mentions that passing on the side is also forbidden.<br>
The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 102:5 mentions a practical application of this halachah:
If one completes his <i>Amidah</i> when a colleague is praying behind him, he is forbidden from taking his three steps [backwards] until the person behind him finishes his <i>Amidah</i>. Were he to [step backwards], he is like one passing before another in the midst of the <i>Amidah</i>. One must be especially careful in this, even if the last one began his <i>Amidah</i> after the first person.

[Similarly, he should not pray while standing] on a bed, bench, or chair<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The special mention of these objects requires explanation, since presumably, they would be included in the general category of a place three handbreadths or more high. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 90) quotes Rabbi Yitzchak Abuhav as suggesting that it is forbidden to pray while standing on these objects even if they are less than three handbreadths high. Even at this low height, a person may be unable to concentrate out of fear that he might fall.
The <i>Prisha</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 90) maintains that it is unlikely that a person would fear falling from such a low height and offers a different rationale. He explains that these objects constitute a separation between the person and the ground. In the Temple, the sacrificial service could be performed only while one was standing directly on the ground. Therefore, our prayers must be recited in a similar manner.

The difference is that, in the <i>Shema</i>, intense concentration is only required when reciting the first verse, while the entire <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> should be recited with such intention. Hence, it is likely that in such precarious positions, the fear of falling will prevent a person from maintaining his concentration for this prolonged period. See also <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i>, Chapter 2, Halachah 4.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 2:4, the Rambam explains the meaning of the word נדבך as follows:
The custom of those building a wall of earth (as opposed to bricks or stones) was to set up two large boards of wood and throw the earth in between them. They would pack it tight with wooden tools until it had the shape of a wall, and then tie [the two boards together.] Afterwards, they would remove the boards from the structure they had built...
בראש הנדבך means ""on top of the wall at the time that they are packing (the earth) between the boards that are called נדבכים.""
</i>r wall when the time of the <i>Amidah</i> arrives must descend in order to pray, and then return to their work<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., though they are hired workers and thus, their time is not their own, nevertheless, they are granted the time to fulfill their fundamental religious obligations in the proper manner. However, after discharging those duties, they must return to work immediately.
</i>. If they were at the top of an olive or fig tree, they may pray where they are, because of the excessive effort [involved in descending].<br>W<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) arrives at this differentiation based on an apparent contradiction between two <i>beraitot</i>, one stating that workers must recite the entire <i>Amidah</i>, and the other stating that the abridged version is sufficient.
Those working for daily wages are in effect paid by the hour and must use their time for their employer in the fullest manner possible. In contrast, implicit in an agreement to work for meals is that a high rate of productivity is not expected from such a worker. Hence, he is granted greater leniency.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 16a differentiates between these trees and those of other species. Rashi explains that the danger of falling from these trees is minimal because of their thick branches, and, therefore, one may stand there firmly and pray.
The Rambam, based on the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 2:5, explains that the wide branches make the descent problematical, and, therefore, the workers may pray in the trees themselves.
</i>hat is it that they pray? If they are working for meals alone, they recite three prayers of 19 blessings. If they are working for wages, they recite ""Give us understanding<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., the abridged version of the <i>Amidah</i>, discussed in Chapter 2, Halachot 2-4.
</i>."" In either case, they do not lead the congregation<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> nor participate in communal prayer because of the additional time involved. Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 16a) also agrees that this applies even to one working for meals.

This clause teaches that one should not even speak in a normal tone of voice.
Both of these laws are based on <i>Berachot</i> 24b:
One who makes his voice audible during the <i>Amidah</i> is among those of little faith (i.e., he seems to indicate that it is necessary to speak loudly in order that God should hear him - Rashi).<br>
One who raises his voice in the <i>Amidah</i> is among the false prophets. (Rashi explains that this is based on I Kings 18:28, which describes the actions of the false prophets of Ba'al: ""And they called out loudly."")
<i>Lechem Yehudah</i> notes that the mention of both these halachot is somewhat unnecessary. The prohibition of making one's voice audible alone would appear to be sufficient. However, since that prohibition is lifted on occasion as explained below, the Rambam mentioned also the first law which is followed regardless of the circumstances involved.

On these days, people devote more concentration to their prayers. Also, they generally pray from a prayerbook. Therefore, they are less likely to be disturbed by someone else's voice. Nevertheless, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> notes that the Zohar suggests praying in a hushed tone even on these days.

Rashi explains that the High Priest and King bow down more because a person who occupies a position of greatness must lower and subjugate himself before God. The Maharal (<i>ibid.</i>) mentions that bowing is a natural response to one's feelings of closeness to God. Therefore, these two men, closer than others to God, bowed more frequently.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.11,"Why should one take leave from the left first?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as stated in the previous halachah

Ravva saw that Abbaye took leave from his right side first. He said to him: ""Do you think this refers to <i>your</i> right? It refers to your left, which is the right side of the Holy One, blessed be He.""
The <i>Zohar</i> (II p. 32a) makes similar statements:

In his <i>Seder Tefilot kol HaShanah</i>, the Rambam writes: ""It is our custom to make supplication while prostrated with these statements and verses; sometimes, mentioning them all and sometimes, mentioning only some of them.""
Thus, though there was a basic text for these prayers (which is, to a large extent, included in the extended <i>Tachanun</i> recited on Mondays and Thursdays), what a person actually said was still left to his own creative impulse.
There are two different versions of תחנון today. The תחנון of <i>Nusach Ha'ari</i> is based on Psalm 25, whereas that of <i>Nusach Ashkenaz</i> and <i>Nusach Sefard</i> is based on Psalm 6.

The <i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 131, explains that the reason for prostrating oneself after <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> is that by doing so, one prays in all three positions of prayer employed by Moses:
sitting (during the verses of Praise), - ""...and I sat on the mountain 40 days and 40 nights"" (Deuteronomy 9:9 ,<br>
standing (during <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>) - ""And I stood on the mountain as on the first day for 40 days and 40 nights"" (Deuteronomy 10:10 ,<br>
prostration - ""And I fell down before God, as at first, for 40 days and 40 nights"" (Deuteronomy 9:25 .
The <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Parshat BaMidbar</i>) explains that after prayer, a person should feel as if he has returned his soul to God and has no life-energy left. Thus, he falls to the ground where he receives new spiritual power.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 5.14,"When uttering the supplication<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., the prayer recited after <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. In Hebrew, the Rambam uses the term נפילת אפים, which means literally ""falling on the face.""

There, the Rambam explains that it was a normal practice of idolators to place stones down in order to prostrate themselves upon them. He states that the Biblical prohibition - (Leviticus 26:1 : ""You shall not place a paved stone in your land to bow upon it"" - refers to השתחואה alone, as opposed to simply bowing, which although forbidden, does not obligate punishment. See also <i>Sefer Hamitzvot</i>, Negative Commandment 12.
The Rambam also notes that prostration was permitted in the Temple, since the above verse mentioned only ""your land"". Similarly, because of this prohibition, it is customary to lie rugs or mats on top of the stone floors in most synagogues.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Megillah</i> 22b indicates that this variance in custom existed even in Talmudic times.
It is interesting that in Halachah 13, the Rambam mentioned only <i>histachavah</i>, prostrating oneself, as the proper method for נפילת אפים. Perhaps, he considered it the most preferable position.
</i>t is forbidden to prostrate oneself on stones except in the Holy Temple, as we have explained in <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i>.<br>An important person is not permitted to fall on his face unless he is certain that he is as righteous as Yehoshua<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Megillah</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) relates:
An important person is not permitted to fall on his face unless he will be answered like Yehoshua bin Nun, as [Joshua 7:10] states: ""God said to Yehoshua: 'Get up and go. Why is it that you have fallen on your face?'”
Rashi explains that a person of stature would be subjected to ridicule if his prayer were not answered as Yehoshua's was.
The Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Ta'anit</i> 2:6, restricts the application of this Halachah. According to one version, the limitation exists only to יחיד על הציבור (an individual who is praying on behalf of the community). Another version states יחיד בציבור (an individual in a congregation).
In these cases, there might be cause for embarrassment if he was not answered. However, there is no such restriction when an individual prays by himself. See also <i>Tosafot, Megillah</i> (<i>ibid.</i>).

Rather, he should tilt his face slightly, but not press it to the ground<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> maintains that this can be derived from the following narrative in <i>Megillah</i> (<i>ibid.</i>). Rav came to a synagogue in Babylonia, but did not fall to the ground after the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> as they did. One of the explanations offered by the Talmud for his behavior is that there was a stone floor in front of Rav, but not in front of the other congregants. The Talmud then asks: ""Why didn't Rav move to their place?"", obviously implying that one may offer this supplication in a place other than one's place of prayer.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Megillah</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) derives this law from the actions of Ravvah and Abbaye, who followed this practice instead of falling to the ground in accordance with the above rule.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 131:8) rules in accordance with the Rambam. The Ramah adds that no one should prostrate himself on the floor even if it is not stone. Therefore, the custom today is that everyone rests their heads on their arms while reciting <i>Tachanun</i>.

The <i>Ginat Veradim</i> suggests that the Rambam requires only that the order of the two passages not be reversed, but is not concerned with the order of the letters within the passages themselves. This perspective, however, is not accepted by other authorities, who explain that surely, the Rambam requires order within the passages.

Because of the doubt involved, the Rambam rules that in situations where the question of their holiness is raised, one should always take the more stringent perspective. Therefore, in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 23:27, the Rambam rules that they should not be saved from a fire on the Sabbath if the violation of even a Rabbinic transgression is involved (accepting the possibility that they have not become consecrated).

A person who whispers an incantation over a wound and then recites a verse from the Torah, who recites a verse over a child so that he will not become scared, or who places a Torah scroll or <i>tefillin</i> over a baby so that it will sleep, is considered to be a soothsayer or one who casts spells. Furthermore, such people are included among those who deny the Torah, because they relate to the words of the Torah as if they are cures for the body, when, in fact, they are cures for the soul, as [Proverbs 3:22] states: ""And they shall be life for your soul.""
The inclusion of these people among ""those who do not have a portion in the world to come"" is based on <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:8, which makes such a statement about ""those who deny the Torah.""

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> resolves this difficulty explaining that, although a <i>mezuzah</i> affords Divine protection, that protection comes, in and of itself, in reward for the fulfillment of the mitzvah. There is no need for any additions on man's part. Indeed, a person who makes additions to the <i>mezuzah</i> in an attempt to increase its influence demonstrates that he is concerned with ""his own benefit"" and ""the vanities of the world"" and not with the fulfillment of God's mitzvah. Therefore, he deserves the Rambam's severe words of criticism. See <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 19.<br>

With regard to the blessings, see <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:8, which states:
For every mitzvah whose performance fulfills one's obligation, one recites the blessing when one performs it. Whenever a mitzvah has a further commandment involved after its performance, one should not recite a blessing until one performs the latter commandment. For example, when one makes a sukkah, a lulav,... <i>tefillin</i>, or a <i>mezuzah</i>, one does not recite a blessing when one makes them.... When does one recite the blessing? When one dwells in the sukkah, shakes the lulav,... wears the <i>tefillin</i>, or affixes the <i>mezuzah</i>.

The vegetables are not considered to be non-kosher <i>s'chach</i>, which would invalidate the sukkah if they take up four handbreadths, as explained in Halachah 14.

Rav Kapach mentions two possible extensions of the difference of opinion between the Rambam and the Ra'avad:
a) paper or carton - According to the Rambam, it may not be used because it no longer resembles a plant produced from the earth. According to the Ra'avad, it might be acceptable, since it is not subject to contracting ritual impurity.
b) cotton wool - It may be used for the purposes mentioned by the Ra'avad and thus, according to his opinion, would be subject to contracting ritual impurity. Nevertheless, its natural form is preserved. Hence, according to the Rambam's opinion, it would be acceptable.

Thus, they explain that the Talmud is referring to a small mat. However, because it is made of thick tassels, rather than woven, it is not comfortable to lie on, and hence would most likely be used for shade. According to this opinion, any woven mat, even if it is large, is unfit to be used as <i>s'chach</i>. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 629:6) quotes the Rambam's interpretation.

I<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> A person might think: ""What is the difference between the sukkah and my house - they are both covered with boards?"" This is surely a false assumption. As explained in the following halachah, since the boards of a roof were not placed there for the purpose of shade, but rather to be part of the permanent structure of the house, they cannot be considered to be <i>s'chach</i> (<i>Sukkah</i> 14a; Rabbenu Manoach).

Thus, it could be considered to be an extension of the wall (דופן עקומה), as explained in Halachah 14. However, if it is in the midst of the sukkah, it is not acceptable. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that this law can apply even in the midst of a sukkah, provided the sukkah already possesses its minimum size. His decisions in the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 632:1 follow this interpretation.

There were boards that were four handbreadths wide, but less than four handbreadths thick. A person turned them on their side so that they would not be four handbreadths wide to use them as s'chach. This is not acceptable, because a board is unacceptable for use as s'chach whether one uses its width or thickness. - <i>Sukkah</i> 14b explains that after the Sages forbade the use of such boards, they are considered to be equivalent to iron poles.
The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 629:22 writes that at present it is customary not to use boards as <i>s'chach</i>, even if they are less than four handbreadths wide. However, if there is no other <i>s'chach</i> available, one may use boards for that purpose even if they are more than four handbreadths wide.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.8","A roof which is not covered by a ceiling - i.e., the plaster and the stones - but rather has only boards fixed in place, is not acceptable, since they were not placed there for the purpose of a sukkah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as required by the following halachah

The only difficulty was the intention with which they were originally placed. A change of mind without an act is not sufficient, since, as explained in the commentary on the following halachah, we are required to ""make"" a sukkah and not use one which has already been made.
</i>. [This applies provided] that each board is not four handbreadths wide<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as explained in the previous halachah. Rabbenu Asher states that in such a situation, the sukkah is acceptable even though the boards are more than four handbreadths wide.
He explains that in the previous instance, the reason the Sages forbade using such boards was to differentiate between them and the boards of a house. In the present instance, the fact that the person took apart the roof of his house obviously implies that he realizes that it may not be used as a sukkah. Hence, there is no need for such a decree. This opinion is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, ibid.
</i>.<br>Similarly, it is kosher if one removed a board from between two others and replaced it with kosher <i>s'chach</i>, with the intention [that it serve] as a sukkah."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.9","A sukkah that was made for any purpose whatsoever - even if it was not made for the purpose of [fulfilling] the mitzvah - if it was made according to law<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 8b quotes a <i>baraita</i> which contains the latter statement and questions: ""What does 'according to law' mean?...That it was made for the purpose of shade.""
It appears that the Rambam uses the same expression, but with different implications. Since he explicitly states that the sukkah must be constructed for the purpose of shade, one might infer that the expression ""according to law"" is intended to include other concepts. Thus, it can be a reference to the requirements for a sukkah's size and the nature of the materials used for the <i>s'chach</i>, as mentioned in this and the previous chapter.
</i>, it is kosher<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 1:1, states:

An old sukkah: The School of Shammai deems it unacceptable, while the School of Hillel rules it kosher.

The commentaries explain that the term ""an old sukkah"" refers to any sukkah that was constructed for purposes other than the fulfillment of the mitzvah.
In its discussion of this law, the Jerusalem Talmud requires that one must make an addition or change to the <i>s'chach</i>. Though that decision is not quoted by the Rambam, Rabbenu Asher mentions it and it is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 636:1). Nevertheless, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 636:1 explains that this is a desirable and proper step, but the sukkah is acceptable even though no changes have been made.
</i>. However, it must be made for the purpose of shade<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Isaiah 4:6 states: ""It shall be a sukkah for shade from the heat...,"" thus defining the purpose of such a structure. A sukkah constructed for the purposes of modesty is not acceptable (Rabbenu Manoach).
</i>. Examples of this are sukkot made for gentiles, sukkot made for animals, and the like<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> which are outside the entire framework of mitzvot. <i>Sukkah</i> 8b also mentions the sukkot made for shepherds and watchmen. Though the latter are obligated to keep the mitzvah of sukkah, they did not necessarily construct their sukkot with that intent in mind.
</i>.<br>In contrast, a sukkah that came about on its own accord<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> e.g., branches fell over a frame, and of course, any time a roof is covered for other purposes - e.g., the construction of a home, as mentioned in the previous halachah...
</i> is unacceptable, because it was not made for the purpose of shade.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
</i> Similarly, when a person hollows out a place in a heap of produce and thus makes a sukkah, it is not considered to be a sukkah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Ba'al Hamaor</i> writes that if, originally, a person were to pile produce with the intention that later he would hollow out a sukkah, the sukkah would be acceptable. However, this opinion is not accepted by other authorities.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkot</i> 12a explains that there is an added factor involved in this example. Deuteronomy 16:13 states: ""Make a [celebration of] the Sukkot holiday for seven days."" This refers to the construction of the sukkah and teaches that we must ""make"" a sukkah and not use what was already made. Therefore, despite the fact that the person hollowed out the space for the purpose of shade, the sukkah is not acceptable, because the produce was not originally placed there for that purpose.
We find a similar principle concerning <i>tzitzit</i>. Deuteronomy 22:12 states: ""Make yourself tassels on the four corners of your garments."" On the basis of this command, <i>Menachot</i> 40b teaches that it is unacceptable to tie <i>tzitzit</i> to a three-cornered garment and then cut a fourth corner, since we are required to make <i>tzitzit</i>, and not use what is already made.
</i>, because the produce was not piled there for this purpose. Accordingly, were one to create a space one handbreadth [high]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> We find the measure of one handbreadth considered to define a structure with regard to the laws of ritual impurity. Accordingly, it is given significance in this context as well. (See <i>Sukkah</i> 16a.)
</i> and seven [handbreadths]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> by seven handbreadths
</i> in area for the purpose of a sukkah, and afterwards hollow it out till it reached ten [handbreadths]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the minimum height of a sukkah, as explained in Chapter 3, Halachah 1.
</i>, it is kosher, since its <i>s'chach</i> was placed for the purpose of shade.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and then, the original structure was merely expanded.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.10","We may not use bundles of straw, bundles of wood or bundles of reeds as <i>s'chach</i>. T<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> by the Sages (<i>Sukkah</i> 12a)...

The Rambam bases his statements on the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 1:6). Though the Ra'avad maintains that a bundle may be composed of even a smaller number of units, the Rambam's opinion is accepted as halachah by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 629:15.

Small bundles<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> questions the reason for the addition of the adjective, noting that if the bundles contain fewer than twenty five units, they are permitted, as stated in the previous halachah. Others mention that this refers to bundles of small branches.
</i> that were tied together [to be sold] by number<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> to be untied immediately thereafter (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 629:16).
</i> may be used as <i>s'chach</i>.<br>S<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> However, if one were to add even one branch and then tie them together, it would be considered to be a bundle (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 629:15).
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Ba'al Hamaor</i> questions whether this principle applies only with regard to <i>s'chach</i>, where it is logical to assume that a more lenient position would be taken, since the entire question revolves around a Rabbinic decree, or whether it also applies in all cases where Torah law itself requires a bundle.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 13b relates that bundles of this nature were frequently used in Sura, and that the Sages permitted them to be used as <i>s'chach</i>.
</i>imilarly, if one cuts off the top of a date palm and the branches are bound to it, it may be used as <i>s'chach</i>, because elements that are bound naturally are not considered to be bundles. Furthermore, even if one tied the tops of the branches from one side, and they thus appear to be a single bundle with one of its two ends bound naturally and the other bound as a result of human activity, it may be used as <i>s'chach</i>. A single tree which is bound up is not considered to be a bundle, but rather a single piece of wood, since [the branches] are bound together naturally.<br>Similarly, any knot which is not strong enough to hold when carried is not considered a knot [and the resulting bundle may be used as <i>s'chach</i>].<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 13b mentions this principle when explaining why bundles of willows whose upper tie was loosened could be used as <i>s'chach</i>.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.12","A person who constructs his sukkah under a tree is considered as though he built it within his home<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and the sukkah is unacceptable. This applies only when the shade the tree produces exceeds the open area. However, if there is more open space under the tree than shade, the sukkah may be kosher.
The determination of whether such a sukkah is kosher depends on a number of principles, based on the interpretation of <i>Sukkah</i> 9b and 11a. The Rambam's interpretation of that passage, and thus the ground rules he establishes, differ from those accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 626:1-2).
In the following halachah, the Rambam deals with the resolution of the question when no effort has been made to correct the problem of the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i>. As will be explained, there his interpretation is contested by other authorities. In this halachah, the Rambam describes the rulings which govern the situation when an effort has been made to rectify the situation by detaching the branches from their source of nurture. These are based on the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 11a, and are also accepted by other Rabbinic authorities. (See the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 626:2.)
</i>.<br>If one draped the leaves and branches of trees [over the sukkah], and then placed <i>s'chach</i> over them, and only afterwards detached them, [t<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned in Halachot 1 and 2, branches are fit to be used for <i>s'chach</i> only after they have been detached from their source of nurture.
</i>he following rules apply:]<br>If the amount of [kosher] <i>s'chach</i> exceeded [the branches], it is kosher. I<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the presence of the branches remains halachically significant. Hence,...
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though at present, the branches would be acceptable as <i>s'chach</i>, as explained in the commentary on Halachah 9, the Torah requires that when <i>s'chach</i> is originally put in place, it must be kosher. Otherwise, it is unacceptable even though steps were taken to correct the disqualifying factors. This is based on the principle that one must make a sukkah and not use one which is already made.
Nevertheless, since the prohibition against using these branches as <i>s'chach</i> does not relate to their essential nature, their presence may be nullified when there is a majority of kosher <i>s'chach</i>. This conforms to the principle of ביטול ברב.
</i>f the amount of <i>s'chach</i> which originally was kosher did not exceed [the branches], one must move them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., each of the branches individually (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, ibid.)
</i> after detaching them, so that they will have been put in place for the purpose of a <i>sukkah</i>.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Moving the branches negates their previous placement, and afterwards they are considered to be kosher <i>s'chach</i>, which was put in place for the purpose of creating a sukkah.

Ravva said: ""The above applies only to a tree whose shade is greater than its open space. However, if its open space is greater than its shade, it is kosher.
What difference does it make if its open space is greater than its shade, the substance not acceptable as <i>s'chach</i> will be combined with the kosher <i>s'chach</i> [and therefore, the sukkah will not be acceptable]?
Rav Pappa said: בשחבטן.

The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, the Ra'avad, and Rabbenu Manoach explain that the Rambam renders בשחבטן as ""when he separated them."" Thus, when the two substances were combined, the Rambam's opinion would be that the sukkah is not kosher, as explained in this clause of the halachah. When they are separate, the sukkah may be kosher according to the stipulations mentioned in the following clause of this halachah and the halachot to come.
(The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam renders בשחבטן as ""when he severed them."" However, that difference in interpretation does not result in a difference in halachah.)
Rashi and others interpret בשחבטן as ""when he lowered them (and mixed them together with the kosher <i>s'chach</i>)."" Thus, according to this opinion, the sukkah is acceptable when the kosher and non-kosher <i>s'chach</i> are mixed together. Thus, this view is diametrically opposed to the Rambam's, who maintains that such a mixture is of no avail.
As noted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 626:1), there are two ways of understanding this interpretation of the passage. However, since both of them are not acceptable to the Rambam, their explanation will not be included here.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The presence of the substance which is not acceptable as <i>s'chach</i> is not nullified according to the principles of ברב ביטול, because it exists as a separate entity which can be distinguished from the kosher <i>s'chach</i>.
Rav Avraham, the Rambam's son, notes the apparent contradiction between this decision and Halachah 3, which states:

[When one uses] branches from a fig tree which contain figs,...We see if the waste is more than the food; then we may use them as <i>s'chach</i>.

That halachah also mentions kosher <i>s'chach</i> - the branches - and substances which are not acceptable as <i>s'chach</i> - the figs. However, if there is a greater quantity of branches, the presence of the figs is nullified. In contrast, in this halachah, that concept is not applied.
Rav Avraham distinguishes between the two. In Halachah 3, the person does not intend to use the fruit for the purpose of shade; he merely wants to save the effort of removing it from the branches. Therefore, their presence may be nullified. In contrast, in this halachah the substances which are not acceptable as <i>s'chach</i> are being employed for the purpose of shade itself. Hence, their presence cannot be nullified.

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam's decision is based on the fact that there is no way that there will not be some tiny open spaces within the kosher <i>s'chach</i> of a sukkah. Accordingly, even if the kosher <i>s'chach</i> is equal in area to the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i>, the tiny spaces between the kosher <i>s'chach</i> will tip the balance in favor of the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i>.

The above applies only with regard to placing the <i>s'chach</i>. However, afterwards, even when the <i>s'chach</i> is thick, a person should have no compunctions about using such a sukkah.
Though thick <i>s'chach</i> is kosher, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 631:2 notes that if it is so thick that rain will not enter the sukkah, the sukkah is unacceptable, because then it resembles a house and not a temporary dwelling made for shade.

It allows this uneven roof to be considered to be a single straight entity. The same principle is also applied in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 15:25 and <i>Hilchot Tum'at Meit</i> 16:5.
</i>. [This applies] provided it is aligned opposite the edge of the lower portion<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., that the upper portion could be lowered into the space left open by the lower portion. However, if it would not fit exactly in between the spaces, this principle does not apply (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, noting the Rambam's decision in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i>, explains that even if the lower space is wider than the upper portion, as long as they do not overlap, it is acceptable.
The <i>Merchevat Hamishneh</i> explains that the law differs here from <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i>, because there is a principle that two halachot received from Moses on Mount Sinai cannot be used simultaneously to have a sukkah considered to be kosher.
In the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 631:5), Rav Yosef Karo quotes the opinion he stated in the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>. However, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (631:7) and others follow the view of the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>.

Though the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> attempts to justify the use of the term, his arguments seem forced. However, it must be noted that most manuscripts and printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> as well as the Rambam's and most other texts of the source for this halachah - the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 1:2 - include this word.

However, if the <i>s'chach</i> of the lower sukkah alone produces enough shade to permit the use of the sukkah, it is kosher even though the <i>s'chach</i> of the upper sukkah is more than 20 cubits high.
He continues to explain that even though the presence of non-kosher <i>s'chach</i> nullifies the kosher <i>s'chach</i> below it, that applies only when the substance used is by nature not acceptable for use as <i>s'chach</i>. In this instance, the <i>s'chach</i> of the upper sukkah is fit to be used; the only difficulty is its position: its placement above the maximum height of the sukkah.
(Though this concept is found in <i>Tosafot, Sukkah</i> 9b, no allusion to it appears in the Rambam's statements. Indeed, the simple meaning of the Rambam's words implies the very opposite. Furthermore, in his commentary on the Mishnah [<i>Sukkah</i> 1:1], the Rambam explains that the reason <i>s'chach</i> placed higher than 20 cubits is unacceptable is that it makes the sukkah into a permanent dwelling. Thus, according to the Rambam, such <i>s'chach</i> can be compared to the boards of a house, which though originally kosher for use as <i>s'chach</i>, are disqualified because they became part of a permanent structure.)

A bed [with a canopy placed] inside a sukkah: If [the canopy] is more than ten handbreadths high<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the minimum height for a dwelling to be considered to be an independent structure (<i>Sukkah</i> 20b).
In this and the following instances mentioned in this halachah, the ten handbreadths are measured from the ground to the canopy (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 627:2-3; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 627:5).

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 2:1 relates:

An incident occurred concerning Tavi, Rabban Gamliel's slave. He would sleep under a [canopied] bed [in the sukkah]. Rabban Gamliel told the Sages: ""See my slave, Tavi. He is well-learned and knows that slaves are free of the obligation of [dwelling in] the sukkah. Hence, he sleeps under a bed.""

</i>, because it is considered to be a sukkah within a sukkah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> even if it has no walls (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 627:1)

</i> If it is ten handbreadths high, one may not sleep<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> or perform any other activity required to be performed in a sukkah. (Perhaps the Rambam mentions sleeping because it is an activity that may be performed only within a sukkah. Even a short nap should not be taken outside the sukkah. In contrast, a snack may be eaten outside a sukkah.)

This halachah depends on the Rambam's interpretation of the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 1:3. However, <i>Tosafot, Sukkah</i> 10b and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 627:3) interpret the passage differently and forbid spreading a canopy over bedposts which are permanently affixed to the four corners of a bed, even if the canopy is less than ten handbreadths above the ground.
</i>."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.24","In contrast, should one spread a sheet over two pillars<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Tosafot</i> (ibid.) and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid.) differ with this decision as well, and explain that if these pillars are ten handbreadths high and permanently affixed to the bed, it is forbidden to spread a sheet over them.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.25","A borrowed sukkah is fit [to be used on the holiday]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Although, as stated in Chapter 8, Halachah 10, a person cannot fulfill the mitzvah of lulav as prescribed by the Torah with a lulav belonging to a colleague, that concept does not apply with regard to a sukkah.
<i>Sukkah</i> 27b explains the derivation of this concept as follows: Leviticus 23:42 states: ""Every citizen of Israel shall dwell in sukkot."" The latter word is written סכת, implying one sukkah. This prompted our Sages to declare: ""All Israel are fit to dwell in a single sukkah.""
In his commentary, Rashi explains that the cost of such a sukkah would not be high enough to require every individual to pay a penny's worth. Hence, we must assume that some people would be using a borrowed sukkah, and, nevertheless, our Sages said that it was kosher.
</i>. Similarly, a stolen sukkah is also fit [for use]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There is a slight imprecision with the Rambam's statements. A stolen object which the thief is obligated to return cannot be used to perform a mitzvah, because it is considered a mitzvah that came about through a sin (מצוה הבאה בעבירה). However, in the instances cited by the Rambam, the sukkah itself is never considered stolen property. Hence, the use of such a sukkah is not forbidden. However, in a number of instances (see below), the sukkah itself is considered to be stolen property and must be returned. Hence, it cannot be used to fulfill the mitzvah.
</i>.<br>What does the latter imply? If a person attacked a colleague, forced him to leave his sukkah, stole it, and dwelled in it, the attacker has fulfilled his obligation, because landed property cannot be stolen<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Hilchot Gezeilah</i> 8:14 relates that ""landed property is never acquired by a thief, but rather remains in the possession of its owner forever.""
Since the sukkah is built on the land, it is considered part of the property and the above rule applies to it as well. Thus, the sukkah is still considered to be the property of its original owner and the thief is viewed as merely ""borrowing"" the sukkah from him. As mentioned above, use of a borrowed sukkah is permitted.
</i>.<br>[Similarly,] if he stole wood and made a sukkah from it, he has fulfilled his obligation<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 31a relates that a woman once came to Rav Nachman complaining that the exilarch's servants had stolen wood from her to build his sukkah.
Rav Nachman answered that they had, nevertheless, fulfilled their obligation...
</i>, because the Sages ordained that the owner of the wood is entitled only to the monetary worth of the wood<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> but not the wood itself. Thus, the sukkah itself is the property of the thief. Though he is obligated to pay the owner for his wood, that obligation does not prevent the sukkah from being considered as his.
<i>Hilchot Gezeilah</i> 1:5 explains this principle by stating:

Anyone who steals is obligated to return the stolen property itself... If it was lost or changed, he is obligated to return its monetary value...
Even if one steals a beam and builds a mansion [using it], since [the beam] has not been changed, the Torah law would require him to destroy the entire building and return the beam to its owner.
Nevertheless, the Sages instituted a decree [to encourage] those who repent; they ordained that all that is necessary is for him to return [the beam's] monetary value, and thus he will not forfeit his building.

Rabbenu Manoach asks: Since the mitzvah of sukkah is commanded by the Torah, and Torah law regards these boards as stolen, how can the Sages' decree change their status in this context?
He explains that, as implied by the principle הפקר הפקר בית דין, the Torah has granted the Sages the right to determine the status of property. Their decree can alter entirely a person's rights to its title. Thus, in the present case, since Rabbinic law entitles the thief to use of the boards, he is permitted, according to Torah law, to use them as a Sukkah.
The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (637:5) writes that if the thief refuses to pay for the wood, it is considered to be the property of its original owner, and the thief does not fulfill his obligation.
</i>. Even if one stole boards and merely put them in place without attaching them or changing anything about them, he has fulfilled his obligation<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is a special leniency granted out of respect for the mitzvah of sukkah (<i>Sukkah</i>, ibid.). Since the thief has not made any changes in the wood itself or built a permanent structure from it, the Rabbinic decree mentioned above would not apply. Thus, during the rest of the year (and even in this case, after the Sukkot festival), the wood would have to be returned. During the festival, the Sages considered it to be the property of the thief and he is allowed to use without any constraints throughout the festival (<i>Hilchot Gezeilah</i>, ibid.).
Nevertheless, in his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 637:3), Rav Yosef Karo gives two examples of a stolen sukkah which one is forbidden to use: a sukkah that had been constructed on a ship or one that had been constructed on a wagon. Since the thief did not build anything, the abovementioned Rabbinic decree does not apply; nor are they affixed to land, and hence the principle that landed property cannot be stolen is not relevant.
</i>.<br>If a person constructs his sukkah in the public domain<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though the Jewish inhabitants of the city would surely not object to use of public property for this purpose, the gentile inhabitants of the city would. Since they also have a share in this property, building a sukkah there is equivalent to stealing from the public (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 637:3).
Nevertheless, since the theft of land is involved...
</i>, it is acceptable<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for the reasons mentioned above. Note the <i>Magen Avraham</i>, ibid. and the <i>Bi'ur Halachah</i>, who discuss whether or not it is permitted to recite a blessing when using such a sukkah.

We are obligated to bless [God] for undesirable occurrences in the same manner as we bless [Him] for desirable occurrences. [This is implied by Deuteronomy 6:5]: ""And you shall love God, your Lord with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might.""<br>
""With all your heart"": with both your inclinations; the good inclination and the evil inclination;<br>
""With all your soul"": even if it takes your soul;<br>
 ""With all your might"": with all your money. Alternatively, the expression בכל מאדך [can be associated with the words בכל מדה and interpreted to mean] for every measure that He deals you be very, very thankful to Him.
On this Mishnah, the Rambam comments:
[The Mishnah] states: In the same manner as one blesses Him for good... [i.e.,] he should accept them with happiness, overcome his feelings, and compose his mind when reciting the blessing <i>Dayan ha'emet</i> to the extent that he should appear in the same state as when reciting the blessing <i>hatov v’hameitiv</i>.<br>
Our Sages declared... ""Everything Heaven does is for good.""... Although many matters may originally look unfavorable, ultimately they will bring great good. Conversely, there are many things which, at the outset, appear good, and ultimately are very bad. Therefore, an understanding person should not become aggrieved when beset with difficulties... because he does not know the ultimate outcome.<br>
A person should concentrate his thoughts [on the following objective] and ask God [for it to be realized]: That everything that happens to him in this world, both positive and unfavorable occurrences, should be with the intent of bringing him the ultimate happiness, [a portion in the world to come].

<i>Berachot</i> 37a states, ""A person who chews [kernels of] wheat should recite the blessing <i>borey pri ha'adamah</i>."" Even though the grain has been cooked, since the kernels were not processed at all, it does not warrant a blessing of greater importance (<i>Kessef Mishnah</i>).
The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 208:3-6 discusses the question of grains that are cooked whole, but are cooked for a long period until their shell dissolves. There are authorities who recommend that unless the kernels have been cooked to the extent that they stick together as a single mass, whole grains should be eaten only in the midst of a meal containing bread. See also Halachah 4.

Furthermore, even the blessing <i>borey pri ha'adamah</i> is not recited, because generally people do not eat flour (Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi, See also <i>Berachot</i> 36a).<br>
1. I.e., it resembles a porridge.<br>
2. Because of the importance of the five species of grain, the Sages ordained the recitation of a special blessing before and after partaking of them. Since this mixture is considered a food and not a beverage, it warrants the recitation of these blessings.<br>
3. Since this mixture is considered a beverage and not a food, it does not warrant the recitation of these blessings.<br>
 4. <i>Berachot</i> 37b relates that any food that is made from the five species of grain but is not considered bread requires the blessing <i>al hamichyah</i>. Since these foods are cooked in a pot, they are not considered bread. See also note 6.<br>
5. Since the grain kernels have been processed slightly, they are considered worthy of the special blessings ordained for foods from the five species. As mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 2, the later authorities suggest that the grains be cooked to the point that they stick together as a single mass before these blessings should be recited. If, however, both the shell of the kernel has been removed and they have been crushed, the blessing <i>al hamichyah</i> may be recited even when the kernels do not stick together (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 208:15).<br>
6. As mentioned in Halachah 6, as long as the grain is included to add flavor, it is considered the primary element in the mixture, and the blessing <i>al hamichyah</i> should be recited, even though quantitatively, the dish contains a majority of other substances. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 208:2.)<br>
 7. The definition of foods as primary and secondary depends on the person's intention and not the quantity of the foods included in the mixture.<br>
8. This principle is quoted from the Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 6:7.<br>
9. Thus producing a single food, as exemplified in Halachah 6.<br>
10. In this instance, the two foods remain separate, yet the secondary food is included in the blessing recited over the primary one, as exemplified in Halachah 7.<br>
 11. The Rambam is quoting <i>Berachot</i> 39a, which states that this law applies even to turnips that require a large amount of flour.<br>
12. <i>Beitzah</i> 38a states, ""Anything added for flavor is never considered negligible.""
The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 204:25 and the <i>Chacham Tzvi</i> (Responsum 129) explain that the Rambam's (and the Talmud's) statements apply only to products from the five species of grain. Whenever they are added to flavor foods, they are considered of primary importance even when, quantitatively, they are less than the other ingredients of a particular dish. In contrast, when two or more types of foods other than grain products are mixed together in a single dish and both are intended to add flavor and/or satiate the person eating, the food which is greater in quantity is considered as the primary ingredient.
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> adds that if the starch was added for flavor, the mixture would require the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i>. He continues, explaining that when other foods - e.g., fruits which are not usually eaten raw, are cooked in sugar to produce jam, the fruits are considered of primary importance. Hence, the blessing <i>borey pri ha'etz</i> should be recited. See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 204:11.<br>
 14. By adding the clause, ""so that the heavy brine...,"" the Rambam explains the source for this ruling, <i>Berachot</i> 6:7, and clarifies a problem posed by the commentaries.
Although the Mishnah mentions the example of bread serving as a secondary food when it accompanies salted foods, the Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 44a) protests, and explains that in almost all situations bread would be considered the primary food. The Mishnah is describing a specific instance: people who eat fruit that originates in the area around Lake Kineret.
In his Commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam explains that this refers to people who work as watchmen in orchards. They eat large quantities of fruit. Hence, in order to help their digestion, they also must partake of brine. Since the brine itself could be harmful, they eat bread with it.
Here, also, the Rambam is referring to a case where the person has no desire to eat bread and does so only to protect his throat. If, however, a person wanted to eat salted fish on bread and desired both the bread and the fish, he must recite the blessing <i>hamotzi</i> and recite grace. (See <i>Turei Zahav</i> 212:1-2.)
<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 212:2 gives another example: A person who eats bread to weaken the taste of an alcoholic beverage.<br>
<br>
 16. A <i>k'zayit</i>. In contemporary measure, it is equivalent to 28.8 cc according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i> and 33 cc according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>.<br>
17. Out of faithfulness to the Rambam's text, we have translated his words literally, although they have caused the commentaries great difficulty. On the surface, there is an open contradiction between the first clause and the second clause. From the first clause, it appears that a piece of bread less than the size of an olive which resembles bread warrants the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>. In contrast, the latter clause appears to indicate that the bread must both be the size of an olive and have the appearance of bread to warrant the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>.
Because of this difficulty, the Radbaz (Vol. V, Responsum 1393) and <i>Sefer HaBatim</i> have suggested amending the text and rendering the latter clause, ""If they are not the size of an olive and no longer resemble bread because of the cooking process."" Furthermore, even without amending the text, this interpretation can be accepted, since, as the Rambam's own descendant, Rabbi Yehoshua, explains, there are times when the Hebrew או can be rendered as ""if."" Thus, the passage would read, ""If they are not the size of an olive, if....""
Rav Yosef Karo was aware of the text's difficulty and the suggestions to amend it. Nevertheless, both in his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 168:10), he seeks to justify the Rambam's choice of phraseology, explaining his statements as follows:
When one cooked pieces of bread or mixed them into soup, if they are the size of an olive, one should recite the blessing <i>hamotzi</i> although they no longer resemble bread. If they are less than the size of an olive but resemble bread, one should recite this blessing when they have been mixed into soup. If, however, they have been cooked, and although it is obvious that these pieces came from a loaf of bread, they no longer have the appearance of bread, only the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> should be recited.
To summarize: when one breaks bread into pieces and puts them into soup, since the pieces still resemble bread they may not be eaten unless one recites the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>. If the pieces of bread were cooked completely to prepare a different food and less than a <i>k'zayit</i> remains whole, the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> should be recited. According to most authorities, if one cooks with bread crumbs or matzah meal, the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i>, should be recited on the foods produced.
</i></sup><i class=""footnote""> The blessing usually recited after partaking of foods other than those from the seven species for which <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> was praised. The same rationale mentioned above applies. Since the kernels were served without being processed, they do not warrant a blessing of greater importance.

Blessings 3.9,"Before partaking of dough baked over the ground<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Significantly, the Rambam's definition of the term כובא דארעא, discussed by our Sages, <i>Berachot</i> 38a, differs from that of Rashi, whose interpretation is quoted in the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 168:15).

When the wood had burned until all that remained was glowing coals, they would remove them and fill the hole with dough.

[The Rambam's conception is significant since other halachic authorities - e.g., the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 168:40 - maintain that<i>hamotzi</i> should not be recited because this dough is soft, like pancakes.]
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and not <i>hamotzi</i>
</i>ecause it does not have the appearance of bread. If, however, one uses it as the basis of a meal<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> eating the quantity mentioned above of this grain product either alone or together with other foods (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 168:13)
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Based on <i>Berachot</i> 42a, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 168:6) interprets this to mean ""a measure that others would usually use as the basis for a meal even though, personally, one is not satisfied from it.""
Quantitatively, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 168:8 states that the intention is a full meal, an <i>isaron</i>. [He arrives at this calculation as follows: In the desert, the Jews received an <i>omer</i> of manna for two meals each day. An <i>omer</i> is twice the quantity of an <i>isaron</i>.] This is approximately 22 <i>k'beitzot</i>, or 1266 cc according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, and 1452 cc according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>. This figure includes not only the grain product, but also other foods - e.g., meat, fish, or vegetables - that are eaten together with it.
Nevertheless, there are more stringent opinions, and accordingly, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 168:24 suggest not eating a meal consisting of more than four <i>k'beitzot</i> of food with such ""bread"" as its base.
</i>, one should recite the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>.<br>S<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states that all three opinions may be accepted as halachah, and none of these three types of foods requires the blessing <i>hamotzi</i> or grace, unless it is eaten as the basis of a meal.
There are, however, several difficulties with the application of this decision in contemporary situations, particularly with regard to ""<i>mezonot</i> bread."" Surely, when one eats a complete meal, serving such bread does not free one of the obligation of washing and reciting grace. Furthermore, there are difficulties even when one eats only a snack with such bread. First, some authorities - e.g., Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi in his <i>Piskei Siddur</i> - state that a meticulous person should not each such bread without having recited <i>hamotzi</i> on other bread first.
Second, when one eats sandwiches using such bread or eats it with other foods, one may easily eat more than four <i>k'beitzot</i> of food, and that, as explained above, is problematic according to certain authorities.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 168:7) states that all that is necessary is to mix enough of these ingredients into the dough so that their taste is felt. The Ramah and the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 168:16 differ and maintain that the amount of these ingredients must exceed the quantity of water used. Support for their ruling can be drawn from the Rambam's statements in <i>Hilchot Chametz UMatzah</i> 5:20.
The above is significant with regard to what is popularly called today <i>mezonot</i> bread, which is produced by using apple juice instead of (or together with) water. According to the Ramah, the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> should not be recited:<br>
a) if the dough is made with more water than juice,<br>
 b) if one uses this bread as the basis for a large meal.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 168:8 states that the blessing <i>hamotzi</i> was designated for bread to indicate its importance as a satisfying food and the foundation of our diet. Hence, it was instituted only for breads that are usually served for such a purpose. If, however, a person decided to serve another food made from flour and resembling bread with a similar intent, it is also appropriate that he recite <i>hamotzi</i>.

Blessings 3.10,"Before eating rice<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In this halachah, we have translated אורז as ""rice"" and דוחן as ""millet,"" based on the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Shvi'it</i> 2:7. There is, however, debate concerning this manner among the halachic authorities. Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 37a) and the Maharil interpret אורז as ""millet."" With respect to these opinions, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 208:9 and the <i>Turei Zahav</i> 208:11 suggest partaking of rice or millet only in the midst of a meal including bread. If either are eaten separately, the blessing <i>shehakol</i> should be recited beforehand because of the doubt involved.
In contrast, the <i>Sha'ar Tziyun</i> 208:31 rules that the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> should be recited before partaking of rice. He explains that there are opinions that the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> should be recited on all satisfying food. Since rice serves this purpose, it can be given this blessing.

This applies only when no other ingredients are combined together with the rice<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Thus, the law regarding rice differs from that regarding cooked foods made from the five grains. As explained in Halachot 4-6, although quantitatively a food may contain a mixture of other ingredients, as long as the grain was intended to add flavor to the food, it is considered the primary ingredient. In contrast, the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> is recited on a mixture of rice and other foods only when rice is quantitatively the primary element of the mixture. See <i>Shulchan Aruch (</i>14Orach Chayim13 208:7).
The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 208:9, however, maintains that the Rambam's words should be interpreted literally. Thus, the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> should be recited only when rice is prepared by itself and not when eaten in combination with even a minority of other foods.
</i>.<br>In contrast, before eating bread made from millet<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rabbenu Asher and many other Ashkenazic authorities differ with the Rambam and maintain that since millet, like rice, is a sustaining food, it warrants the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i>.

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Kitniyot</i> is generally translated as ""legumes."" In halachic literature, however, it is used to refer to a far wider scope of agricultural products, particularly with regard to the laws of Pesach. (See <i>Hilchot Chametz UMatzah</i> 5:1.)

<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 21, explains that <i>Shemot Rabbah</i> states that the remembrance of the Sabbath is זכר למעשה בראשית, ""a commemoration of the work of creation."" The remembrance of the exodus, it continues, must also emphasize the wonders and miracles that God performed.
What is the common point between the Sabbath and the exodus? Both emphasize how God is above nature and, hence, can change nature according to His will.

A Jew steps beyond his weekday activities and devotes his energies to spiritual activites bond with God.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.4,"One must begin [the narrative describing our ancestors'] base [roots] and conclude with [their] praise<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This principle is taken from the Mishnah, <i>Pesachim</i> 116a. The commentaries offer several rationales in its explanation. Among them:
a) The contrast between our nation's humble roots and the majestic level they reached through the Exodus make us more conscious of God's great kindness (<i>Tosefot Rid</i>).
b) Mention of our roots prevents us from becoming overly haughty (<i>Maharshah</i>).
</i>. What does this imply? One begins relating how originally, in the age of Terach<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Abraham's father
</i>, our ancestors denied [God's existence]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam is alluding to the passage ""Originally, our ancestors were idol-worshipers.""
</i> and strayed after vanity, pursuing idol worship<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 1:1-3.
</i>. One concludes with the true faith<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The redemption from Egypt representing the birth of the Jews as a nation and the beginning of their service of God as a people.
</i>: how the Omnipresent has drawn us close to Him, separated us from the gentiles, and drawn us near to His Oneness<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> by giving us the Torah.
</i>.<br>Similarly, one begins by stating that we were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt and [describing] all the evil done to us<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's statements are based on <i>Pesachim</i> 116a, which mentions a debate between Rav and Shmuel concerning the interpretation of ""One must begin [the narrative describing our ancestors'] base [roots] and conclude with [their] praise.""
Rav maintains that it is proper to begin from ""Originally, our ancestors were worshipers of idols,"" placing the emphasis on our degrading spiritual roots. Shmuel (according to the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, Ravvah) maintains that we should begin from ""We were slaves to Pharaoh, stressing the humble material origins from which our people stem. Customarily, we follow both opinions in our recitation of the Haggadah (Rav Yitzchak Alfasi), and hence the Rambam includes both opinions in this halachah.
There is, nonetheless, a certain difficulty with the Rambam's statements. All texts of the Haggadah begin with ""We were slaves,"" and then relate the passage ""Originally, our ancestors were idol worshipers."" Here, the Rambam reverses that order. Perhaps he made this choice because the Talmud uses this order when mentioning these two opinions. Alternatively, chronologically, our ancestors' worship of idols preceded the Egyptian exile.
</i>, and concludes with the miracles and wonders that were wrought upon us, and our freedom<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> relating the story of the Exodus.

<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XII, notes that the following halachot emphasize how the obligation of recalling the Exodus applies, not only to the recitation of the Haggadah, but to all the practices performed on Pesach. Since we must recite the Haggadah to others, as implied by the question-and-answer approach required by Halachah 3, the manner in which a person performs all the other Passover practices must also demonstrate to others his personal experience of the Exodus.

Since the Rambam is addressing people who may never have seen the physical land of Egypt, it is not possible to demand that they feel as if they left that country, but rather, that they left backbreaking slavery as experienced by our people in Egypt.

Regarding this manner, God commanded in the Torah: ""Remember that you were a slave [Deuteronomy 5:15]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> It is necessary to quote this verse in addition to the one mentioned previously.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.7,"Therefore, when a person feasts on this night<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The meal served at the Seder should be festive. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 472:2, states that a person should set the table with the most attractive utensils he can afford.
</i>, he must eat and drink<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Talmud mentions two practices as characteristic of freedom: reclining and drinking four cups of wine<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Most halachic authorities require that this wine have some alcoholic content. Hence, grape juice alone should not be used.
</i>. The Rambam mentions the general principles applying to these obligations in this halachah, and explains each of the practices in particular in the following halachot.
</i> while he is reclining<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> on couches
</i> in the manner of free men<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Even a person who has difficulty drinking wine must observe this practice. <i>Nedarim</i> 49b relates that Rabbi Yehudah bar Illai would have to bind his sides from Pesach to Shavuot because of the aftereffects of the four cups of wine he drank at the Seder. Nevertheless, each year he fulfilled the mitzvah.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Pesachim</i> 10:1), the Rambam relates that this was the practice of ""kings and great people.""
The commentaries quote the Rambam's expression as a proof that reclining (הסיבה) is not merely a particular law, describing the manner in which the matzah and the four cups of wine must be eaten and drunk, but rather a unique requirement on its own. Therefore, as explained in the following halachah, it is praiseworthy for a person to eat the entire Seder meal while reclining.
</i>. Each and every one, both men and women<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Generally, woman are not bound to fulfill any mitzvot that have a specific time limitation. However, an exception to this principle is made regarding the mitzvot associated with the Seder night. Since the women had a full share in the miracles of the Exodus - indeed, <i>Sotah</i> 11b states that the redemption came about because of their merit - they must participate fully in the commemoration of the Exodus (<i>Pesachim</i> 108b).
It is curious that the Rambam does not mention whether wine should be given to children below Bar-Mitzvah age. Many authorities maintain that it is unnecessary for the Rambam to mention this fact, for we can assume that the all-encompassing obligation to educate one's children in Torah practice applies in this regard as well. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 472:15 and <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 472:25)
Other commentaries, however, maintain that the omission is significant. They note that in <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> 4:12, the Rambam writes that wine is harmful to young children. Hence, they maintain, the Rabbis would not require a father to train his children in Torah practice at the expense of their health.

Alternatively, it is suggested that they refer to:

the four cups mentioned in the narrative of Pharaoh's butler;
the four exiles in which the Jews will suffer;
the four cups of retribution God will force the gentiles to drink in the Messianic age; and,
the four cups of consolation He will offer to the Jews after their redemption.

In Halachah 8:10, the Rambam also mentions a fifth cup of wine. See the commentary on that halachah.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.8,"Even one of Israel's poor should not eat until he [can] recline<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The word ""even"" is used to include people who one would presume would not be obligated. <i>Tosefot, Pesachim</i> 99b, explains that it obligates even a poor person who cannot afford a couch or pillows to lean on. He also must try to recline to the best of his ability - e.g., leaning on a colleague's side. See <i>Magen Avraham, Orach Chayim</i> 472:3.
</i>. A woman need not recline<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rabbenu Manoach and other commentators explain that this refers only to a woman in the presence of her husband.

Since he must eat with his right hand, it would be uncomfortable for him to recline on that side (Rashbam, <i>Pesachim</i> 108a).

</i>. Neither is reclining on one's back or forwards<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Pesachim</i> 108a explains that פרקדן is not considered as a desirable manner of reclining. Most commentaries explain that refers only to leaning on one's back. However, even leaning forward is not acceptable, since this is not a comfortable manner of eating and cannot be regarded as a symbol of freedom and liberation.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, Orach Chayim 472:7, writes that a person who ate matzah or drank from the four cups of wine without reclining is not considered to have fulfilled his obligation and must repeat the act.
The Ramah qualifies this law, explaining that since, in the Ashkenazic community, certain opinions do not require reclining at present, one need not drink another cup of wine if the third and fourth cups of wine were drunk without reclining. However, he suggests that a person repeat the eating of matzah and the drinking of the first two cups of wine if they were consumed without reclining. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (and the subsequent authorities) declare that the drinking of the first cup should also not be repeated.
</i>. While eating and drinking at other times<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> during the Seder meal
</i>: if one reclines, it is praiseworthy<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for, as mentioned in the previous halachah, reclining is one of the signs of freedom and liberation, and thus, has an importance of its own, independent of its connection to the eating of matzah and the drinking of the four cups of wine.
</i>; if not, there is no requirement<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for, in particular, reclining was obligated only for those acts that were specifically instituted as symbols of our liberation. One should not recline while eating the maror, for it was ordained as a remembrance of our people's oppression and not of their liberation (<i>Pesachim</i> 108a).

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.9,"These four cups [of wine] should be mixed with water so that drinking them will be pleasant<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In Talmudic times, the wines were very strong and had to be mixed with water before being drunk. At present, most commercially produced wines have already been diluted with water. Nevertheless, in many communities, it is customary to mix a small amount of water with the wine when pouring the cup, to fulfill the obligation of mixing the wine with water oneself.
</i>. [The degree to which they are mixed] all depends on<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the strength of
</i> the wine and the preference of the person drinking<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Nevertheless, the Sages placed some limits on the extent to which wine may be diluted.
</i>. [Together,] these four [cups] should contain at least a quarter<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
[of a log] of pure wine. — i.e., the sum total of pure wine contained in all four cups must be at least a quarter of a <i>log</i> at least 3.35 fluid ounces, as explained above. A person may thus add three times this quantity of water to the wine to produce four cups, each containing a quarter of a <i>log</i> of mixed wine.
We may not dilute the wine any further. <i>Shabbat</i> 77a states: ""Any wine that is less than a third of the quantity of the water [mixed in] is not considered wine.""
This factor is significant at present, when the wines commercially produced are substantially diluted with water in the factories. Hence, when adding water to them at the table, one must take care not to exceed the above limits.

</i> has fulfilled the obligation to drink wine in a manner expressive of freedom, but has not fulfilled the obligation of four cups of wine<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rabbis ordained that the cups be drunk in the prescribed order. (Note the following halachah.) A person who does not drink them in this order does not fulfill his obligation.
</i>.<br>A person who drank the majority [of the cup] from each of these [four] cups has fulfilled his obligation<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Taz</i> (472:7) explains that it is desirable for a person to drink the entire cup of wine if possible. Accordingly, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> suggests using smaller cups, so that it is easy to drink the entire contents. Some opinions maintain that even if a person is using a very large cup, he is obligated to drink the majority of the cup. However, the prevailing opinion (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 472:19) is that for the first three cups, it is sufficient to drink the majority of a quarter of a <i>log</i> (i.e., at least 1.68 fluid ounces of wine). For the final cup, one should drink an entire quarter of a <i>log</i>.
The source of the latter law is <i>Pesachim</i> 108a, which mentions a person who drinks wine from his cup and then gives to his children and the members of his household. The Talmud concludes that he fulfills his obligation if he drinks the majority of the cup. The Rambam quotes only the conclusion of this statement, for he maintains that all adult members of the household, both men and women, should be given their own cups of wine and he does not mention the obligation of giving wine to children.

Generally, when one continues drinking wine in one sitting, only one blessing is recited in the beginning. However, in this instance, since each of the four cups was ordained as a specific mitzvah, it requires a blessing of its own.
The <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> quotes Rav Avraham, the Rambam's son, as stating that after each of the four cups, his father also required the recitation of the blessing על הגפן (the blessing recited after drinking wine).

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This statement represents a change of opinion by the Rambam. <i>Pesachim</i> 10:3 states: ""The <i>charoset</i> is not a mitzvah.

According to Rabbi Eliezer ben Tzadok, who maintains that <i>charoset</i> is a mitzvah, one is obligated to recite a blessing ""...who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us regarding the eating of <i>charoset</i>."" This is not the halachah.

A change of opinion of this nature is not extremely uncommon. However, the question can be raised: why does the Rambam not require a blessing to be recited over the <i>charoset</i>? Among the answers given is that the <i>charoset</i> is considered secondary (טפל) to the substances which are dipped in it. Hence, we follow the principle of reciting a blessing upon the essential item (the maror or the matzah) and not on the <i>charoset</i> (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>).

However, since there is no Torah mitzvah to eat maror, merely that one should use it to embellish the Paschal sacrifice, that measure is not required by the Torah.
[Perhaps, this thesis may be questioned on the basis of Halachah 8:6, which requires a separate blessing for maror when it is eaten alone. As in Halachah 8:2, a blessing would not be required on a measure less than a כזית.]

Furthermore, in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 56), the Rambam explains that if it is impossible to obtain bitter herbs, it is still a mitzvah to partake of the Paschal sacrifice. However, there is no mitzvah to partake of bitter herbs alone. (See also <i>Hilchot Korban Pesach</i> 8:2.)

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 7.13,"The bitter herbs referred to by the Torah are Romaine lettuce<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> — <i>Pesachim</i> 39a explains that even though the leaves of this species are sweet, it is preferable to fulfill the mitzvah of bitter herbs with this species than with any other. Just as the Egyptian exile began in a favorable way and ended in bitter oppression, similarly the leaves of this plant are sweet, but its root bitter. Furthermore, its Aramaic name, חסא, also means compassion and alludes to God's mercy for our people. From a halachic perspective, it is easiest to consume the required measure of maror when using this species.

Since the consumption of maror is a Rabbinic commandment, the more lenient view - in terms of modern measurements, between 16.6 and 24 grams, depending on different halachic opinions - may be relied upon.

Fasts 1.1,"It is a positive Torah commandment<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 59), which mentions this in the reckoning of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.
Significantly, however, the Rambam's appreciation of this mitzvah differs in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> from that in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>. To explain: Following the verse quoted here by the Rambam as a proof-text, the Torah continues [Numbers 10:10]: ""On the days of your rejoicing, on your festivals, and on your new moon [celebrations], you shall sound the trumpets<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In the Temple, these were made of silver (<i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i> 3:5). Josephus describes them as being approximately a cubit long, slightly thicker than an ordinary flute, and having a bell-like end. It is questionable whether it was necessary for them to be silver outside the Temple as well.
See also the Ramban (<i>Drashot l'Rosh HaShanah</i>), who mentions an opinion that the shofar, and not a trumpet, should be sounded in time of communal distress. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> also notes this opinion and states that either instrument, a shofar or a trumpet, is acceptable, but that - outside of the Temple premises - only one of the two should be used in time of distress. Some support for this position can be drawn from Halachah 6.
</i> for your burnt offerings and for your peace offerings.""
In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam writes:

We are commanded to sound the trumpets in the Temple when offering sacrifices that are offered only at appointed times.... [Also,] we are commanded to sound the trumpets at a time of distress and difficulty when we pray to Him.

In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (and similarly in <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, Mitzvah 384), the emphasis of the mitzvah is clearly on the sounding of the trumpets during the sacrifices. In the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, when listing the 613 mitzvot at the beginning of the text, the Rambam mentions the sounding of the trumpets both for the sacrifices and in times of distress. Nevertheless, further on in the beginning of the text, when delineating the mitzvot according to subjects, he places the emphasis on crying out to God at a time of distress (seemingly, including crying out verbally and crying out with the trumpets in the same mitzvah). Significantly, in <i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i>, Chapter 3, where the Rambam mentions the practice of sounding the trumpets in connection with the offering of the sacrifices, he does not mention it as a component of this or any other specific mitzvah.
(Note also the commentary of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, which questions why these two different rites were included as a single mitzvah at the outset. Even in the Torah, they are included in two separate verses.)
</i> to cry out<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in prayer. Our Sages (<i>Sifre, VaEtchanan</i>) explain that זעקה is one of the ten verbs used for prayer.
</i> and to sound<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The verb להריע refers to the sounding of a series of staccato notes referred to as <i>teru'ah</i>. See <i>Hilchot Shofar</i> 3:2-4. Significantly, although in practice, both types of notes were sounded, with regard to the sounding of the trumpets at the offerings, the Torah uses the verb ותקעתם, which refers to sounding a <i>teki'ah</i>, a single long note.
</i> trumpets in the event of any difficulty that arises which affects the community, as [Numbers 10:9] states: ""[When you go out to war... against] an enemy who attacks you and you sound the trumpets....""<br>[T<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., it does not apply to war alone, as might be understood from the verse.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As obvious from Halachah 4, this practice was observed throughout <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, and not only in the Temple. Nor is its observance dependent on the existence of the Temple, nor does the Rambam specify that it must be fulfilled only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. (In this regard, there are differing opinions; see <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 576:1) Accordingly, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 576:1 questions: Why is the rite of sounding the trumpets (or shofarot) not observed at present?
The resolution of this question lies in the Rambam's words, ""any difficulty that arises which affects the community."" This rite should not be observed when an individual, or even a group of individuals, are in distress, but only when a ""community"" is affected.
<i>Pesachim</i> 54b explains that communal fasts are possible only within <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. There is no concept of taking such a unified communal act of this nature in the diaspora. Therefore, this mitzvah was not relevant in all the generations of our people's existence in the diaspora. (See also the <i>Drashot l'Rosh HaShanah</i> of the Ramban.)
A question arises, however, with regard to the situation at present, with the renewal of the Jewish settlement in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. As explained in the commentary on Chapter 3, Halachah 11, there are opinions (see the gloss of the <i>Birkei Yosef</i> to the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 575) that maintain that at present, the concept of community also applies in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.
According to this view, without entering into the discussion regarding the halachic status of the present government, it would appear that it would be proper for this mitzvah to be observed, since its observance is not dependent on the Temple.
</i>his commandment is not restricted to such a limited scope; rather] the intent is: Whenever you are distressed by difficulties - e.g., famine, plague<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note <i>Ta'anit</i> 22b, which states that the trumpets should not be sounded in the case of a plague even during the week. Since a plague is a very severe matter, were the trumpets to be sounded during the week, they might also be sounded when a plague took place on the Sabbath, and thus a prohibition would be violated. The Rambam discusses this question in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Ta'anit</i> 3:3). Similarly, in Chapter 2, Halachah 1, the Rambam rules that the trumpets are sounded when a plague occurs.
</i>, locusts, or the like<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., circumstances that cause distress to the community as a whole.
</i> - cry out [to God] because of them and sound the trumpets<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 2:6, where the Rambam gives the assurance that if the Jews cry out to God as a community, He will surely heed their prayers.

Fasts 1.2,"This practice is one of the paths of repentance<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Temurah</i>, where the Rambam writes that although all the mitzvot of the Torah are Divine decrees and thus unfathomable in nature, we should meditate upon them and, to the fullest extent of our potential, try to explain them. Similarly, with regard to the mitzvah under discussion, without claiming to be able to fathom it in its entirety, the Rambam gives a rational explanation for the practice.
</i>, for when a difficulty arises, and the people cry out [to God] and sound the trumpets, everyone will realize<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The very sound of the trumpets will have a startling effect, arousing the people to inspect their conduct. Similarly, in <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:4, the Rambam writes:

Although the sounding of the shofar on Rosh HaShanah is a mitzvah, it also contains an allusion. [It is as if the shofar is saying,] ""Wake up you sleepy ones.... You who forget the truth in the vanities of time... look to your souls and improve your conduct.""

</i> that [the difficulty] occurred because of their evil conduct, as [Jeremiah 5:25] states: ""Your sins have turned away [the rains and the harvest climate]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 9:1, where the Rambam explains that God has instituted a cycle of causation into the world in which performing a mitzvah brings an individual - or a community - blessing and prosperity, which enable them to perform more mitzvot. Conversely, the failure to observe mitzvot brings about misfortune, which, in turn, makes it even harder to observe mitzvot.
</i>."" This [realization] will cause the removal of this difficulty<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> For when the Jews turn to God in repentance, He will remove their hardships.
</i>."
Fasts 1.3,"Conversely, should the people fail to cry out [to God] and sound the trumpets, and instead say, ""What has happened to us is merely a natural phenomenon and this difficulty is merely a chance occurrence,"" this is a cruel conception of things<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Misfortune is definitely not pleasant. Nevertheless, when one conceives of it as a message from God, intended to motivate a change in one's conduct, one can appreciate that, ultimately, its intent is mercy. In contrast, when one does not appreciate God's hand, one is left with a conception of an existential and cruel world in which there is no force working for man's benefit.

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Tum'at Tzara'at</i>, where the Rambam explains that when a person remains indifferent to the punishment God gives him, God brings more severe punishment upon him.
</i>.<br>This is implied by the Torah's statement [Leviticus 26:27-28]: ""If you remain indifferent to Me, I will be indifferent to you with a vengeance."" The implication of the verse is: When I bring difficulties upon you so that you shall repent and you say it is a chance occurrence, I will add to your [punishment] an expression of vengeance for that indifference [to Divine Providence].<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rather than seeing their difficulty as part of a Divinely structured plan to motivate their repentance.

Fasts 1.4,"In addition<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> to the obligation to cry out and sound the trumpets incumbent upon us from the Torah
</i>, it is a Rabbinic ordinance to fast<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Or Sameach</i> mentions that this practice has its source in Biblical times. II Chronicles 20:3 relates that Yehoshafat called a communal fast when beset by war.

</i> once when a distressing situation occurs. Instead, we are obligated to continue fasting until God shows us His mercies and eliminates the source of distress.
<i>Ta'anit</i> 14b quotes a Rabbinic opinion that maintains that no more than thirteen communal fasts should be ordained because of a difficulty. The Talmud, however, explains that this statement was made with regard to drought alone. With regard to other difficulties, we should continue to fast until our prayers are answered. This conclusion is alluded to by the Rambam's choice of wording in Chapter 3, Halachah 9, and is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 575:6).
</i>.<br>On these fast days, we cry out in prayer, offer supplications, and sound the trumpets<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> blow a series of <i>teru'ah</i> notes

Were a communal ordinance that could not be observed by the majority of the community to be instituted, the people's observance, not only of that particular ordinance, but of the Torah as a whole, would be weakened.
</i>.<br>A communal fast should be ordained only on a Monday<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See the commentary on the following halachah, which deals with the question of communal fasts being instituted on days other than Monday or Thursday.

In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Ta'anit</i> 2:9), the Rambam explains that communal fasts should be held first on Mondays, because were they to be held on Thursday, the shopkeepers would assume that the possibilities for famine are great - for otherwise why would a public fast be instituted before the Sabbath - and they would raise the prices of foodstuffs.
(This rationale differs slightly from Rashi's interpretation of the Mishnah. Significantly, many of the traditional commentaries on the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> do not mention the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah. See the <i>Sefer HaKovetz</i>.)
</i>. This pattern - Monday, Thursday, Monday - should be followed until [God manifests His] mercies<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> From the wording of this halachah, it would appear that the second Thursday should be skipped, and the second series of three fasts begun on the third Monday. The commentaries note that although there is justification for this position in the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Ta'anit</i> 2:13), the Babylonian Talmud (<i>Ta'anit</i> 15b) rules that there is no need to interrupt the sequence of fasts on the second Thursday. This ruling is also borne out by the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>) and some authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. There are, however, other Rabbinic opinions - which are also supported by different manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> (see the commentary on Chapter 3, Halachah 3) - that maintain that a series of communal fasts should always begin on a Monday.

Fasts 1.6,"A communal fast should not be decreed on a Sabbath, nor on a festival<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for the reasons mentioned above.
The <i>Merchevat HaMishneh HaSefaradit</i> raises a question regarding this statement. From the previous halachah, it would appear that a communal fast is ordained only on Mondays and Thursdays, and from this halachah one might assume that, since it is necessary to exclude the Sabbath, such a fast might be ordained for other days.
In resolution, it is explained that the previous halachah refers only to the thirteen communal fasts instituted when the rains fail to descend. When a difficulty of another nature arises, a fast may be instituted on a day other than Monday or Thursday. Alternatively, it can be explained that if the difficulty is not a matter of immediate emergency, the fast is put off for a Monday, as mentioned above. In the case of an immediate emergency, however, a fast may be held on any day other than those mentioned in this and the following halachah.
</i>. On these days, neither a shofar nor a trumpet should be sounded, nor do we cry out [to God] or offer supplications in prayer<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Because of the atmosphere of rest and pleasure that permeates the Sabbath, it is improper to make requests about matters that are not immediate necessities.

In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Karo brings support for the omission of this phrase, noting that in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 2:24 and 30:12, where the Rambam discusses praying to God in the event of such imminent disasters on the Sabbath, he does not mention fasting. Hence, when mentioning appealing to God with regard to these difficulties on the Sabbath in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (288:9, 576:12), Rav Yosef Karo omits the mention of fasting.

According to the authorities who maintain that we may fast on the Sabbath (and even according to some who forbid fasting), this refers to the blessing <i>Anenu</i> added to the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>). According to the other opinions, it refers to the seven blessings mentioned in Chapter 4 that begin ""May He who answered... answer you"" (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).

He explains that, in this instance, the term refers to children past the age of majority. Males are not obligated to observe fasts of this nature until they are 18, nor females until they are 15.
The <i>B'nei Binyamin</i> offers another explanation, noting that on Yom Kippur children should be trained to fast by withholding food from them for several hours (<i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i> 2:10). This practice need not be observed on these fast days.

The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 564:1) state that if, before going to sleep, a person stipulates that he desires to rise before dawn and eat, he is allowed to eat, and yet his fast is still considered to be a fast.

Nevertheless, <i>Ta'anit</i> 8b gives advice regarding such a situation as well, counselling one to vow to fast in the future. This will be considered as if the person fasted already, as implied by Daniel 10:12, ""From the day on which you first <i>considered</i>... fasting before your Lord, your words were heeded.""

Note the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, which raises questions about this decision, citing <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 3:9, where the Rambam states:

If a person vowed to fast for several days, and those days included Chanukah and Purim, his vow is nullified and he should not fast. [The celebration of] these days was instituted by the Rabbis, and hence, it should be reinforced.

One might infer that on the other days that should be celebrated because of the Torah's decree, a vow to fast takes precedence. Some commentaries, however, differentiate between a vow to fast and a commitment to fast made in the afternoon service of the preceding day, as mentioned in the following halachah. In practice, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 578:1) rules that one should not fast on these days.

Fasts 1.10,"Whenever an individual did not accept a fast [on the previous day] before sunset, it is not considered to be a fast<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Ta'anit</i> 12a describes a person who fasts without having made such a commitment to be ""a bellows full of air"" - i.e., he receives no reward for refraining from eating. Note the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, who questions why such a person does not receive at least the reward of an hourly fast, as mentioned in Halachah 13.
He explains that since the person desired his fast to be considered as a full day fast, it is impossible for him to receive the merit of an hourly fast. (See also <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 562:42.)
</i>.<br>How does one accept a fast? After reciting the afternoon prayers<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., after reciting the verse, <i>Yih'yu l'ratzon</i>, but before concluding one's prayers entirely.
Significantly, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> notes that some texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> state that one should make this commitment in the blessing <i>Shome'a Tefillah</i>, reciting the prayer <i>Anenu</i>. Although the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and others take issue with this concept, its authenticity is borne out by two responsa ascribed to the Rambam.
In practice, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 562:6 mentions both possibilities, while the Ramah states that it is preferable to make this statement after the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. Interestingly, the <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 127:2 fuses together both options, stating that one should make a mental resolve while reciting the blessing <i>Shome'a Tefillah</i>, and a verbal statement after reciting the verse, <i>Yih'yu l'ratzon</i>.
</i>, one states, ""Tomorrow I will fast,"" and resolves to do so<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> From the Rambam's statements, it appears that a mental resolve is not sufficient. This is borne out by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 563:1). Note the ruling of the <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 563:3, which state that, after the fact, it is sufficient to have made a mental resolve for one's commitment to fast to be binding.
</i>. Although one eats at night, this does not detract from one's commitment to fast<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In contrast to what might be inferred from the Rambam's statements and the ruling of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) also mention that, after the fact, it is not necessary for the commitment to be made in the afternoon service. As long as it was made during the previous day, whether before the service (according to the <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> only) or afterwards (according to both sources), it is binding.
</i>.<br>Similarly, if one resolved to fast for three or four days consecutively and accepts such a fast upon oneself, the fact that one eats each night does not detract from his fast<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> provided that in the daylight hours one refrains from eating.
</i>. It is unnecessary for him to state his intent on the afternoon before each succeeding day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 562:8) questions whether this applies only when one intends to fast on several consecutive days. If, however, one intends to fast on several non-consecutive days - e.g., on a Monday, on the following Thursday, and on the following Monday - perhaps one is required to make a separate commitment for each day.
With regard to the fasts of <i>B'hav</i> (the Monday-Thursday-Monday sequence of fasts which follow the festivals), the authorities agree that a single statement of intent is sufficient. In other instances, however, the <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 127:1 and others require a separate commitment.
The <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 127:3 mentions another leniency in this instance. Were a person to desire to retract his commitment to fast on the subsequent days, he is allowed, since he did not make an explicit statement to the effect that he would fast.
This view is not, however, accepted by all authorities. The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 162:39 cites opinions that require him to honor his commitment on the subsequent days as well.

Fasts 1.12,"A person who has a disturbing dream must fast<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., the Rambam sees this as an obligation. Other authorities differ, as mentioned in the <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 127:18.

<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 288:3 explains that such a person is allowed to fast on the Sabbath, because the disturbing nature of his dream will prevent him from appreciating the Sabbath pleasures. It is fasting and not indulgence that will bring such a person satisfaction.
Note that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 288:5) explains that at present, it is customary to fast on the Sabbath only for certain disturbing dreams, since we are not as aware of the proper interpretation of dreams as were the Sages of the previous generations.

Although one is obligated (or at least advised) to fast on the Sabbath, one is not absolved from the mitzvah of Sabbath pleasure. Hence, one must fast again in atonement.

Fasts 1.13,"A person may fast for several hours<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., although a person did not undertake a full day fast, the fact that he refrains from eating for several hours can be considered to be a fast. Although his merit is less than that of a person who undertakes and completes a full day fast, he still receives reward for his conduct.
</i> - i.e., that he not eat anything for the remainder of a day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This phrase has its source in <i>Ta'anit</i> 12a and serves as a point of difference between the Rambam and other authorities (among them, the Ra'avad and the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>). The others maintain that it should be rendered ""provided he has not eaten anything the entire day."" Based on the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Nedarim</i> 8:1), the Rambam maintains that even if a person has eaten, if he does not eat for the remainder of the day, he receives merit for fasting.
</i>. What is implied? A person was involved with his affairs and tended to his concerns without eating until noon or until three in the afternoon<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Although the person actually fasted for the entire day, it is considered only an hourly fast, since he did not make a commitment on the previous day.

</i>ecause he accepted the fast before the hours of the fast. Similarly, if a person ate or drank and then began to fast for the entire day, it is considered to be a fast for several hours<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned above, this is a point of difference between the Rambam and other commentaries. In his responsa (Vol. I, Responsum 6), the Rashba writes that the Rambam altered his opinion in his later years and accepted the majority view. The majority opinion is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 562:10).
Significantly, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> also mentions a more stringent view (that of Rabbenu Asher). According to this opinion, even an hourly fast has to be accepted on the previous day. Thus, an hourly fast refers to an instance when a person previously made a commitment to fast for half a day, and then decided to extend the fast for the entire day.
It must be noted that at present, when individuals find fasting difficult, it is customary for a community to declare an hourly fast. In these instances, the members of the community make a commitment not to eat until the afternoon. They recite the afternoon service early, and each individual recites <i>Anenu</i> (Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 562:1; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 562:6). This passage is not, however, recited in the repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> by the <i>chazan</i> (Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 562:1).

Fasts 1.16,"When a community is fasting for the sake of rain, and it begins to rain before noon, the people should not complete their fast<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This teaching, quoted from the Mishnah (<i>Ta'anit</i> 3:9), conveys an important lesson. We must always be ready to praise God for His mercies and to do so with joy.

<i>Pesachim</i> 118a explains that this psalm is given this title because it contains the verse, ""He grants bread to all flesh, His kindnesses are everlasting."" This is the greatest praise of God, that although He utterly transcends our world, He provides each creation with its needs.

</i>, they should complete their fast<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> From this explicit teaching regarding rain, the Rambam infers that
</i>. Similar [rules apply] if [a community]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in contrast to an individual, as mentioned in the previous halachah
</i> was fasting because of a distressing situation and the distress passed, or because of a harsh decree and the decree was nullified: [I<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Ra'avad objects to this decision, explaining that the leniency of stopping a communal fast applies only with regard to the fasts associated with rain. In other instances, it is impossible to be certain that the distressing situation has entirely passed before noon.
The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> justifies the Rambam's ruling, explaining that although the Ra'avad's rationale is generally applicable, if - in fact - the distressing situation passes before noon, the fast may be halted.
The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> also states two reasons for the difference between an individual fast and a communal fast:
a) Leniency was granted to the community because of the greater scale of the difficulty involved in such a fast;
b) When the court called the communal fast, it had in mind that were the community's prayers to be answered, the fast could be terminated.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 569:1) rules that if the Torah scholars and the majority of the members of the community desire to continue the fast, all the members of the community are obligated to abide by their decision.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 569:5 quotes a difference of opinion among the Rabbis whether the leniency to be mentioned applies if the prayers of the community were not answered, but the reason for which they are fasting ceases to become relevant. For example, the people were fasting for the recovery of a sick person and he died.
</i>f this occurred] before noon, they need not complete their fast; after noon, they should complete their fast<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There are opinions which rule that if the community receives word after noon that the difficulty for which they are fasting was averted before noon, they need not continue their fast.

Sabbath 9.4,"When one person brought fire, another brought wood<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As the Ra'avad mentions, <i>Beitzah</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) interprets this as referring to a situation where a new pot is used. Thus, heating the pot hardens it as would heating in a kiln. This is is also a derivative of the labor of cooking. (See Halachah 6 and <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Yom Tov</i> 3:11.)
According to the explanation of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> mentioned above, this is unnecessary. Since the pot was brought together with the other elements for the sake of cooking, the person bringing it is liable, even if it is an old pot.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's ruling is based on <i>Beitzah</i> 34a and the <i>Tosefta, Shabbat</i> 12:4. There are, however, slight differences between the wording chosen by the Rambam and the wording of those sources. Furthermore, the Talmud implies that the person who brought the fire is liable, not for performing a derivative of the labor of cooking, but for the labor of kindling. (See Rashi, <i>loc. cit.</i>) This is definitely not the Rambam's intent.
In resolution of this difficulty, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> quotes his teacher, Rav Ya'akov bei Rav, who explains that the first clause describes a situation in which all the individuals performed their act virtually simultaneously, with a shared intent. Hence, since the end result of their activity is the performance of a forbidden labor, all are held liable as if they had performed the labor themselves.
</i>, another brought a pot, another added water<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Even those who do not accept the explanation of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> would hold such a person liable, since a person is liable for heating water, as explained in Halachah 1.
</i>, another put in meat<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Here too, the obligation is clear, for the person is cooking food.
</i>, another put in spices<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since the spices contribute flavor to the food, adding them to the pot is sufficient to make one liable for cooking, even according to the opinions that do not accept the explanation of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>.
</i>, and another stirred it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
If, by contrast, one put down the pot, another came - According to the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, this is the key phrase in understanding the difference between the first clause and the second. ""Another came"" - i.e., he came after, and without any connection, to the first individual. Hence, the responsibility is not shared by the entire group. Accordingly, since the actions of the persons mentioned first could not bring about cooking in their own right, they are not held liable.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for stirring hastens the cooking process. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 318:18) emphasizes that one is liable for stirring only when the food is not completely cooked. Once it is cooked, there is no prohibition against stirring.
The Ramah (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states that even after food is completely cooked, one should not stir it. The later authorities emphasize that although there is reason to follow this stringency with regard to stirring, there is no difficulty in removing food from the pot if it is already cooked and removed from the fire. (While the pot is cooking this is forbidden, for in the process of taking out the food, one will stir the remaining food.) See Chapter 3, Halachah 11.
</i>, all are liable for cooking. For anyone who performs an activity that is necessary for cooking is considered as [having performed that forbidden labor].<br>If, by contrast, one put down the pot, another came and added water, another came and added meat, another came and added spices, another came and brought fire<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The person bringing the fire would probably be liable for kindling, but that is not the Rambam's concern in this halachah. He is not liable for cooking, for without the wood the flame would burn out in the near future.
</i>, another came and placed wood on the fire<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Once the wood begins to burn, the fire will have the potential to cook the meat. Hence, the person who brings it is liable.
</i>, and another came and stirred<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since the person stirred the food after it began to cook, he is liable. Although he acted independently of the others, the act he performs in its own right is sufficient to incur liability.

Blessings 2.1,"This is the order of the blessings of the grace after meals:<br>
The first blessing [thanks God for providing our] sustenance;<br>

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As the Rambam explains, this blessing was a later addition. The Rambam includes the full text for these blessings in ""The Order of Prayers for the Entire Year,"" which is found at the end of this text.

</i>; the third by King David<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> who solidified the kingdom of Israel and conquered Jerusalem. He instituted the blessing thanking God, ""for Israel, Your people, and Jerusalem, Your city"" (<i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>).
</i> and his son, Solomon<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) relates that the Sages instituted this blessing on the day the Romans granted permission for the dead of Beitar to be buried. This city had served as the capital of Bar Kochba's revolt against Rome and had exacted a heavy toll of legionnaires while making a valiant defense. When the city finally fell, the Romans slew hundreds of thousands mercilessly, the extent of the carnage staggering all chroniclers. As a further measure of punishment to its inhabitants, they refused to allow them to be buried.
Years passed before such permission was granted. When the Romans finally granted the Sages permission to bury these people, they were amazed at the wondrous miracle their eyes beheld. The corpses had remained whole. They had neither rotted, nor been eaten by predators. In appreciation of this Divine kindness, the Sages instituted this blessing, praising God for being ""good"" (for preventing them from rotting) and ""doing good"" (for allowing the corpses to be buried).
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> who built the Temple and added to the blessing instituted by his father, acknowledgement of ""the great and holy house on which Your name is called"" (<i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>).
There is a slight difficulty with these statements. The first three blessings are considered to have been instituted by the Torah. If so, how can the authorship of the latter two of them be attributed to Joshua, David, and Solomon, who lived in later generations?
The Ramban in his <i>Hasagot</i> explains that, although the fundamental obligation to recite these blessings originates in the Torah, the basic form of the text of these blessings was ordained by each of these prophets in his time. Beforehand, each person would recite the grace in his own words. (See also the commentary on the following halachah.)
The Ramban also explains that, after the destruction of the Temple, a prayer that it be rebuilt was included in the third blessing. In this context, it is also worthy to question whether Ezra and the Men of the Great Assembly also made any changes in the grace when they arranged all the prayers and blessings, as mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 5 and commentary. (See <i>Kochba d'Shavit</i>.)
</i>; and the fourth by the Sages of the <i>Mishnah</i>."
Blessings 2.2,"When workers are employed by an employer and eat a meal of bread, they should not recite a blessing before eating<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The obligation to recite the blessing before eating is Rabbinic in origin. In certain situations, the Sages did not institute such a requirement.
</i>. Similarly, they should recite only two blessings after eating<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> combining the second and third blessings and omitting the fourth.
<i>Tosafot, Berachot</i> 16a, states that although the third blessing is required by the Torah, it is not recited because the Sages have the power to withhold the fulfillment of a Torah precept. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> offers a different rationale, explaining that the Rambam did not state that the Torah requires that a specific number of blessings be recited for grace.
The <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> clarifies the matter further, explaining that the Rambam maintains that the Torah requires us to mention three concepts in grace: appreciation for the sustenance God grants us, appreciation for <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, and appreciation for Jerusalem. According to the Torah, it does not matter how these three concepts are mentioned, whether in one blessing (as in <i>al hamichyah</i>), two blessings (as in this law), or three blessings (as is the usual case).
</i> so that they do not neglect their employer's work<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> From this we learn two concepts:<br>
a) that it is forbidden to work while reciting grace (Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 2:5; <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 183:12);<br>
b) how important it is for a worker to devote himself faithfully to his work. See the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Sechirut</i>.
</i>.<br>[In such an instance,] the complete text of the first blessing should be recited<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rashi, <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), explains that this distinction is made because the latter two blessings resemble each other, and hence can be combined with little difficulty. In contrast, the first blessing focuses on a different theme.
</i>. In the second blessing, they should begin with the text of the blessing for <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, include aspects of the blessing for the building of Jerusalem, a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> One should recite:
We offer thanks to You, God, our Lord, for having granted our ancestors a precious, good, and spacious land, and Jerusalem, Your city. May You rebuild it speedily in our days (Rabbenu Manoach).
It may be presumed that one should also include the aspects of the second and third blessings that Halachot 3 and 4 consider as absolute requirements (<i>Kinat Eliyahu</i>).
</i>nd conclude using the standard conclusion of the second blessing.<br>If they do not receive a wage, but only meals in return for their services or if they eat together with their employer, they should recite the full text of the four blessings as others do<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The fact that their employer joins them can be interpreted as license to take the leisure of reciting the full text of grace.
At present, it is assumed that employers allow their workers greater leniency and, in all instances, workers are required to recite the entire grace (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 191:2).
</i>."
Blessings 2.3,"The blessing for <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> should include an acknowledgement of thanks [to God] at its beginning and at its conclusion. I<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is a single expression of thanks, acknowledging God's gift of ""a land which produces sustenance"" (<i>Berachot</i> 49a).
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In ""The Order of Prayers for the Entire Year,"" the Rambam relates that this blessing begins, ""We offer thanks to You, God, our Lord..."" and states, shortly before its conclusion, ""For all these, God, our Lord, we give thanks to You."" An omission of the second mention of thanks, however, does not require the repetition of grace (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 187:4).
</i>t should conclude: ""[Blessed are You, God,] for the land and for the sustenance."" Whoever does not include the phrase ""a precious, good, and spacious land<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This expression is a combination of the praises of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> mentioned in Jeremiah 3:19 and Exodus 3:8.
</i>"" in the blessing for <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> does not fulfill his obligation.<br>A<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 48b) explains that the mitzvah of circumcision is connected with God's promise of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> to Abraham, as Genesis 17:8-10 states: ""I will give you and your descendants... the entire land of Canaan.... You shall keep My covenant.... Circumcise every male.""
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Unless one mentions these qualities, one has not adequately expressed one's appreciation for <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. The omission of this phrase requires the repetition of the grace. See Halachah 12.

The phraseology used by the Rambam indicates that he does not require the repetition of the grace if either of these points is omitted. Other authorities (including the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 187:3) differ and require the repetition of grace in such an instance.
</i>, mentioning the covenant before the Torah. [The reason for this order<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> which gives priority to the covenant
</i> is] that the covenant mentioned in the blessing for <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> refers to the covenant of circumcision, concerning which thirteen covenants [are mentioned in the Torah]. I<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> notes that there are several other verses that refer to a covenant with regard to the Torah. These three, however, are unique in that they refer to the establishment of a covenant regarding the bond between the Jews and the Torah.<br>
1. <i>Berachot</i> 49a mentions both these possibilities. In ""The Order of Prayers for the Entire Year,"" the Rambam quotes the former expression.<br>
2. The beginning of a blessing must share the same theme as its conclusion. Nevertheless, the rebuilding of Jerusalem shares a connection with God's showing mercy to the people of Israel, since the rebuilding of Jerusalem is an expression of God's mercy to the Jewish people (<i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>).<br>
3. Although <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions that two different concepts should not be mentioned in the conclusion of a blessing, this version of the blessing does not contradict that rule. The intent is a single request that Israel be granted the ultimate comfort, the rebuilding of Jerusalem.<br>
4. Rashi, <i>Berachot</i> 48b, mentions another reason for the mention of the House of David. It was David who conquered Jerusalem and established the holiness of the city.<br>
 5. Since an integral element of our celebration of the Sabbath and festivals is eating festive meals, the sacred element of the day should be mentioned in the grace recited after partaking of those meals. Nevertheless, the uniqueness of the day does not require a blessing in its own right, nor is it made the essential element of the third blessing. Therefore, one begins and concludes that blessing in the same manner as is done during the week (Rashi, <i>Tosafot, Berachot</i> 48b).<br>
6. The order in which these alternatives are mentioned in this halachah is the reverse of that mentioned in the previous halachah. It can be explained that in the previous halachah, the Rambam mentioned the text he considered most appropriate first. The order he mentions in this halachah, however, is closer to the expression used by our Sages in <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the source for this halachah.<br>
7. Pesach, Shavuot, and Sukkot. With regard to Rosh HaShanah, see the commentary on Halachah 13.<br>
8. <i>Shabbat</i> 24a explains that since an additional sacrifice (<i>korban musaf</i>) is offered on these days, they possess an element of sanctity that is worthy of mention. As obvious from the contrast of Halachah 12 to Halachah 13, however, there is a difference between the obligation to mention these days and the obligation to mention Sabbaths and festivals.<br>
 9. Since Chanukah and Purim are Rabbinic holidays which are not associated with an additional sacrificial offering, they are not mentioned in the third blessing. The second blessing is more appropriate for the mention of the miracles of these holidays, since it is an expression of thanks to God (<i>Shabbat</i> 24a).
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> note that from <i>Shabbat</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), it would appear that while permission is granted to mention Chanukah and Purim in the second blessing, it is not an obligation to do so. In contrast, the Rambam requires that they be mentioned. They explain that since the Sages of the Talmud were wont to mention these holidays in grace, and the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 7:6) considers their mention a binding obligation, the Rambam established their mention as a requirement. See also Halachah 13 and commentary.<br>
10. Precedence is given to the Sabbath because it occurs more frequently than the festivals and is on a higher spiritual level (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>
 11. ""Blessed are You, God, our Lord, 16King13 of the Universe, the God, who is our Father and our 16King13... the 16King13 who is good."" The reason for this stress on God's sovereignty in this blessing is that the blessing recited previously mentions the sovereignty of the House of David, and the Sages wanted to emphasize how all earthly kings are subordinate to a higher authority (<i>Berachot</i> 49a).<br>
12. The blessing mentioned is quoted from <i>Berachot</i> 46a. That source also contains additions to the blessing that Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi would recite.<br>
 13. The Rambam's words are quoted from <i>Berachot</i> 46b, which relates that Mar Zutra recited this blessing.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 379:14) relates that this blessing should be recited throughout the seven days of mourning by the mourners and by all who recite grace together with him when there is a <i>zimun</i>. Other opinions (based on <i>Ketubot</i> 8a) state that this blessing should be recited only when ten people recite grace together. The <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 207:7 writes that it is Ashkenazic custom to rely on this opinion, and hence, this blessing is generally not recited.<br>
14. <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) relates several additions Mar Zutra made on the above occasion.<br>
15. In ""The Order of Prayers for the Entire Year,"" the Rambam includes several requests beginning with the word <i>Harachaman</i> (May the Merciful One...) in his text of grace. These requests were additions to the grace made by the Geonim, who lived in the era subsequent to the Talmud.<br>
 16. This refers to the final blessing quoted in Halachah 11.<br>
17. <i>Nisu'in</i> (marriage) is marked by the entry of a bride and groom into a private chamber together. This ceremony is referred to as <i>chuppah</i> and is accompanied by a celebration. See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i>, Chapter 10, and commentaries.
As mentioned at the conclusion of the following halachah, according to the Rambam this blessing is recited only when ten adult males are present. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 62:4) differs and maintains that it should be recited even when fewer than ten people are present. Note the Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 62:7) who states that today this blessing is never recited alone. If ""new faces"" - people who had not attended the wedding celebrations previously - are present, all seven blessings are recited. If no ""new faces"" are present (although ten males are), the meal is considered like a meal eaten by the bridegroom alone, and the blessing is not recited.<br>
18. The same laws applying to a widow or widower apply to a person who has been divorced. Significantly, in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 10:12, the Rambam states that even if a woman has been married before, her husband should celebrate with her for three days.<br>
19. Surely, this also applies when neither the bride nor groom have been married before. <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states: ""The Sages ordained that everyone who marries a maiden should celebrate with her for seven days.""
The differences between the time limits mentioned in this halachah and those mentioned in Chapter 5, Halachah 5, are worthy of comparison. See the commentary on that halachah.<br>
20. <i>Ketubot</i> 8a states that after the first day of the wedding celebrations, Rav Ashi would recite the wedding blessings only when ""new faces"" were present. In his responsa, the Rambam's son states that his father required only two ""new faces."" Note the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 64:7 who requires only one ""new face."" The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> write that on the Sabbath the presence of new guests is not necessary, since the Sabbath itself is considered as ""guests.""<br>
21. <i>Ketubot</i> 7b derives this rule from the account of the wedding between Ruth and Boaz. Ruth 4:2 relates that Boaz invited ten men to witness the marriage.<br>
<br>
 22. Only six blessings are mentioned below; the seventh blessing is the blessing over the wine. (See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 10:4.)<br>
23. Rashi (<i>Ketubot</i> 7b) explains that this blessing is in praise of the creation of Adam, the first man.
In <i>Hilchot Ishut</i>, where the text of the wedding blessings is repeated, this blessing follows the blessing ""who has created all things for His glory."" This order is the sequence in which these blessings are recited today. It appears more appropriate, particularly according to Rashi's commentary (<i>loc. cit.</i>), which explains that the blessing ""who has created all things..."" is not directly connected to the wedding itself, but rather is recited in appreciation of the guests who have come to celebrate together with the new couple.
[The repetition of the text of the blessings in two separate halachot, something very out of character for the Rambam in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, has aroused the attention of the commentaries. Some have gone so far as to suggest that the text of the blessings here was added by the printers, and not by the Rambam himself.]<br>
24. Despite the fact that this blessing follows two (or three) blessings which begin with ""Blessed...,"" it also begins with ""Blessed...."" Among the explanations offered is that the first blessings are short, and if the line ""Blessed..."" were not mentioned, they would appear as a single blessing (<i>Tosafot, Ketubot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>).<br>
25. Rashi (<i>loc. cit.</i>) interprets this as a reference to the creation of woman, who was created from man (""his own self""), and gives him the potential for reproduction (""a structure that will last for all time"").<br>
26. ""The barren one"" refers to Jerusalem. Psalms 137:6 states: ""Let my tongue cleave to my palate if I do not place Jerusalem above my highest joy."" Thus, at the height of the wedding celebration, we recall the holy city and pray that it be rebuilt.<br>
 27. This is a prayer that the bride and groom enjoy the happiness experienced by Adam in Eve before the first sin.
Several manuscripts and early printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> mention a different conclusion for this blessing, ""Blessed are You, God, who brings joy to His people, Israel, and rebuilds Jerusalem."" (In this context, note the commentary of the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>.)<br>
28. The blessing joins our wishes for the happiness of the particular couple with our hope for the Messianic redemption and the rebuilding of Jerusalem. The ultimate marriage relationship is the bond between God and the Jewish people, which will be realized in the Messianic age. Thus, the two themes, marriage and redemption, share an intrinsic link.<br>
29. Rashi, <i>Ketubot</i> 8a, explains the difference between the last two blessings. The fifth of the blessings concludes with a request that the bride and groom enjoy a lifetime of happiness and success together. The sixth and final blessing concludes with a request that they find happiness in each other, that their wedding joy be extended throughout their lives. Alternatively, the final blessing is a blessing for the Jewish people as a whole who find fulfillment in married life.

</i>, he should recite the following:<br>
On the Sabbath: B<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Significantly, throughout this halachah, the Rambam does not differentiate between the first two meals of the Sabbaths and festivals and any subsequent ones. As will be explained, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 188:8) does make such a distinction with regard to the repetition of grace. Nevertheless, if a person remembers his omission in time to add the special blessing, even the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:7) requires it to be recited after any and all meals on Sabbaths and festivals.

On the festivals: Blessed [are You, God...]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Our text follows the position of the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, who emphasizes that this blessing contains God's name and the phrase ""King of the universe,"" as do other blessings. This view is not shared by the <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> and several other commentaries, who point to the fact that neither <i>Berachot</i> 49a nor the Rambam explicitly mentions God's sovereignty. Nevertheless, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:6) shares the <i>Lechem Mishneh's</i> position.
</i> who has granted festivals to His people Israel for rejoicing and for happiness. Blessed are You, God, who sanctifies Israel and the seasons.<br>Afterwards, one should begin the fourth blessing and conclude grace<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> without any further changes.
</i>. If he [does not] remember [the omission of the special passages until after] he begins the fourth blessing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., even if he merely mentions the first word, <i>Baruch</i>, as explained above
</i>, he should cease [his prayers]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Based on <i>Berachot</i> 49b, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:8) mentions a difference between the first two meals on the Sabbath and festivals and any subsequent ones. We are obligated to eat only two meals that require grace on these holy days. One may fulfill his obligation for the third meal with other foods, without eating bread on the Sabbath, whereas on festivals one is not obligated to eat a third meal at all.
Accordingly, although there is a dimension of holiness connected with all the Sabbath and festival meals, the need to mention this dimension in grace is considered significant enough to require repetition of all the blessings only when an omission is made in the first two meals of the day.
It must be noted that neither the Rambam nor <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) make such a differentiation explicitly. This has led the <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> and others to postulate that the Rambam maintains that an omission of the Sabbath or festivals in grace is sufficient to require repetition of the blessings in any meal eaten on these holy days.
</i> and return to the beginning [of grace], the blessing for sustenance<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> If three people ate together and made the same omission, however, they do not repeat the <i>zimmun</i> (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>:9).
The Ra'avad challenges the Rambam's decision, calling attention to a law quoted by the Rambam in <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 10:10. When a person omits <i>Ya'aleh v'yavo</i> in the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, he is required to repeat the entire <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. Nevertheless, if he is accustomed to recite prayers of supplication after <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> before withdrawing from his place of prayer, and remembers while in the midst of those supplications, he is not required to repeat <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. All that is necessary is to return to the blessing <i>R'tzey</i>.
Similarly, the Ra'avad argues, the blessing <i>Hatov v'hametiv</i> resembles the supplicatory prayers recited after <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. Accordingly, one should return to the third blessing of grace and not recite the other two.
This opinion, although respected for its sound reasoning, is not accepted by most authorities. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:6) and others quote the Rambam's view.

Blessings 2.13,"[The following rules apply when a person who is reciting grace] on <i>Rosh Chodesh</i> [concludes the third blessing and] forgets to recite <i>Ya'aleh v'yavo</i>:<br>I<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as mentioned in the commentary on the previous halachah, this means after one has recited even a single word of the blessing.

<i>Berachot</i> 49a mentions that the Sages were unsure of whether this blessing should include a <i>chatimah</i> or not. Therefore, to avoid the possibility of mentioning God's name in vain, the <i>chatimah</i> is omitted.

He need not repeat [the entire grace]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 49b explains that although in prayer (see <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 10:10), the omission of <i>Ya'aleh v'yavo</i> warrants a repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, on <i>Rosh Chodesh</i> its omission does not warrant a repetition of grace. The difference between the two is that prayer is an obligation, while eating a meal of bread is not. Since there is no obligation to recite grace on <i>Rosh Chodesh</i>, failing to mention it in grace is not sufficient cause to warrant its repetition.
</i>. The same rules apply on <i>Chol HaMo’ed</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> since we are not obligated to eat a meal of bread on these days.
Within this context, it is worthy to mention the laws regarding the recitation of <i>Ya'aleh v'yavo</i> on Rosh HaShanah. Neither the Rambam nor the Talmudic sources which deal with this subject (<i>Berachot</i> 49a-b and <i>Shabbat</i> 24a) mention adding <i>Ya'aleh v'yavo</i> to grace on Rosh HaShanah. Nevertheless, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> (188:7) takes it for granted that such an addition should be made.
Furthermore, if one becomes conscious of the omission of that addition before beginning the fourth blessing, one should add a special blessing to mention Rosh HaShanah. If, however, one has already begun the fourth blessing, one should continue grace without mentioning Rosh HaShanah, since there is no obligation to eat festive meals on that day. On the contrary, fasting is allowed.

Nevertheless, since there is no indication in the Babylonian Talmud of such an obligation (indeed, <i>Shabbat</i> 24a does not require even the recitation of <i>Al hanisim</i>), the Rambam does not accept that ruling.
It has, however, become customary to add <i>Al hanisim</i> among the paragraphs beginning <i>Harachaman</i> at the conclusion of grace if one forgets to recite it in its proper place (Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 187:4).

Therefore, Ezra instituted a special Torah reading for them on the Sabbath, when work is prohibited.

The difference between the two opinions is that the Rambam considers the blessings to be associated with the Torah portion and not with the reader. In contrast, Rabbenu Asher considers the blessings as the personal responsibility of the reader in preparation for reading from the Torah.
Rabbenu Asher's opinion is accepted by the later authorities. Even in communities where a person other than the one who recites the blessings reads from the Torah, this law applies (Ramah).

However, one is permitted to leave between <i>aliyot</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> provided there are ten others who will remain to hear the Torah reading, and one has fulfilled (or will be able to fulfill) one's obligation to hear the Torah.

See <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 1:4, which states that the mitzvah of Torah study takes precedence over all other commandments. Based on this principle, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his disciples would not interrupt their studies even for prayer (<i>Shabbat</i> 11a - see Chapter 6, Halachah 8). However, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i> 106:3) states that this applies only to scholars like Rabbi Shimon, who never interrupt their studies at all. However, at present, even scholars whose occupation is Torah must interrupt their studies for prayer, for they make other interruptions as well.
The Rabbis question whether the law under discussion applies only to scholars of Rabbi Shimon's level, or whether it is also relevant to scholars of the present day. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that the citation of the behavior of Rav Sheshet as a source for this halachah appears to support the latter opinion. Rav Sheshet, like the other Amoraim of the Talmudic period, was not considered to be on the same level as Rabbi Shimon.

The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 145) writes that even in Talmudic times, it was not customary to translate the Torah in all communities. He explains that, in his age, the custom of translating the Torah had already been ceased because the people did not understand the Aramaic translation traditionally used. The rabbis did not want to translate the Torah into the languages which the people did understand, because of the possibility of error and misinterpretation. Such fears had not existed in regard to the Aramaic translation, since it had been composed with <i>Ruach Hakodesh</i> (Divine inspiration).
[The <i>Tur</i>, however, also mentions the opinion of Rav Natrunai Gaon, who maintains that the translation should be done freely, so that the people can understand, without referring to the traditional text.]
The <i>Tur</i>'s opinion is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 145:3) and in nearly all contemporary Jewish communities, the custom of using a translator during the Torah reading is no longer practiced. For this reason, rather than present a running commentary on Halachot 11 and 12, we have limited our comments to short footnotes.<br>
1. <i>Berachot</i> 45a states that this principle is derived from the giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai. God, ""the Reader,"" did not lift his voice over that of Moses, ""the translator.""
It was also customary to use a מתורגמן in teaching the oral law. Hence, parallels to many of the laws mentioned in this halachah can also be found in <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 4:3.<br>
2. The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Megillah</i> 4:1) mentions that we should approach the Torah reading with awe, reflecting the awe experienced by the Jews at Mount Sinai.<br>
3. Rabbenu Nissim maintains that this prohibition only applied before Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi permitted the oral tradition to be recorded. Afterwards, it was permitted for the translator to use a written text. Rabbenu Nissim's position is somewhat difficult to accept, since the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Megillah</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>), the source for this law, was written several hundred years after Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi granted this leniency. Nevertheless, Rabbenu Nissim's view was widely accepted.<br>
4. The <i>Tosefta, Megillah</i> 3:21, cites the example of Aharon, who served as a spokesman for Moses. See also <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>.<br>
5. Genesis 35:22. The direct translation of this verse would be unbecoming to both Reuven and Jacob (Rashi, <i>Megillah</i> 25a).<br>
6. The third of the priestly blessings states: ""May God turn His countenance to you...."" This appears to be a direct contradiction to the description of God (Deuteronomy 10:17  as ""not turning His face...."" Though our Sages resolved that difficulty (<i>Berachot</i> 20b), a problem might come up in a simple translation of the verse.
Rav Kapach notes that the Yemenite texts of Targum Onkelos lack a translation for the three verses of the priestly benediction.<br>
7. Were the common people given the opportunity of hearing the full story of the golden calf, they might believe that it had spiritual power (Rashi, <i>loc. cit.</i>). Alternatively, the narrative places a major burden of responsibility on Aharon (<i>Tosafot, Megillah</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>).<br>
8. The commentaries note that this passage is not read as a <i>haftarah</i> at present. Rav Kapach states that the need to make this statement indicates that in Talmudic times, the passages that were read as haftarot were not fixed and there was some room for choice.<br>
9. Verses from the Torah cannot be skipped in a public Torah reading. However, it is permitted to skip verses from the prophets while reading the <i>haftarah</i> (<i>Tos'fot Yom Tov, Megillah</i> 10:3).

(See Chapter 2, Halachah 11.)
<i>Shabbat</i> 24b questions whether Rosh Chodesh should be mentioned in this blessing. On one hand, when Rosh Chodesh falls during the week, the <i>haftarah</i> is not read. Hence, one might assume that there is no connection between the two and, hence, there is no need to mention Rosh Chodesh in the blessings. However, on the other hand, we find that when Yom Kippur falls on the Sabbath, the Sabbath is mentioned in the <i>Ne'ilah</i> service, despite the fact that the <i>Ne'ilah</i> service would otherwise not be recited on the Sabbath.
Though Rashi and Rav Yitzchok Alfasi interpret the passage in the same manner as the Rambam, Rabbenu Asher and Rabbenu Nissim rule that no mention should be made of Rosh Chodesh in this blessing. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 284:2 follows the latter position.

Rav Kapach relates that in the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Megillah</i> 4:6), he originally accepted a child as one of the seven, but not as one of the three.

a) Many people who do not know how to read from the Torah would be embarrassed;<br>
b) People who do not know how to read correctly would claim that they do know how to read, and arguments might crop up between them and the synagogue officials.
Nevertheless, since there is a question whether it is acceptable for a person to recite the blessings when he does not actually read from the Torah, it is desirable that the person who recites the blessings read along with the <i>chazan</i> in an undertone. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 141:2, and commentaries.) Yemenite custom, even at present, is that each person called to the Torah reads himself.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 12.18,"In all of these [Torah] readings, a priest reads first;<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though our practice has its origins in the decrees of the Sages as explained below, there is also a Torah command (see <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, Positive Commandment 32) to give precedence to a priest regarding the Torah reading. However, according to the Torah, this commandment applies only when the two are equal in wisdom (as mentioned below).

However, strife and contention would frequently break out concerning the designation of the person deserving of that honor.
</i>. It is common custom at present<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> However, in Talmudic times, if a sage was obviously of a higher stature than the priests who were present, he was called first. Thus, <i>Megillah</i> 22a relates that Rav would receive the first <i>aliyah</i> in the presence of Shmuel, although Shmuel was a priest and Rav was not.
</i> that even a priest who is a common person is given precedence and allowed to read before a wise man of great stature in Israel<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Gittin</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam writes:
Know that the practice which is widely accepted everywhere, that a priest reads first in the synagogue regardless of whether he is a sage or a commoner, regardless of whether there is someone of greater stature there or not, is a matter which has no basis in the Talmud.... I wonder where this blemish came from....
The Rambam continues to explain that even at present, it is proper to call a sage of greater stature to the Torah before a priest of lower stature. Though the Rambam's opinion has been supported by many commentaries, in practice the commonly accepted custom has been allowed to be continued. The reason for this is quite clear. The strife and contention that existed in Talmudic times would surely return (<i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 135).

Apparently, the Rambam interprets this statement as referring to the person who receives the final <i>aliyah</i>, or on Sabbath and festivals, the one who reads the <i>haftarah</i>. He should also roll the Torah closed. The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (147:5-6) quotes a different view, explaining that the term גולל refers to the person who lifts the Torah up (what we refer to as <i>Magbiah</i>). It is customary that the person who receives this honor need not read from the Torah beforehand.
</i>. Therefore, even the person of the greatest stature in the community can receive the concluding <i>aliyah</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Because of the principles mentioned above, one might think that the sage of greatest stature should receive the third (or the first) <i>aliyah</i>. However, since the reward received by the גולל is greater, the sage may be given this honor.

</i>On days when the <i>haftarah</i> is read and there is a <i>Musaf</i> service<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., Sabbaths and festivals

The Rambam does not state whether the Torah scroll should be returned before the morning service or afterwards. In one of his responsa, he writes that there is no advantage to one practice over the other, and everything depends on local custom.

The Torah warns us about this, saying [Deuteronomy 4:19]: ""Lest you lift your eyes heavenward and see the sun, the moon, and the stars... [and bow down and worship them], the entities which God apportioned to all the nations."" - As mentioned in the previous chapter, there are some authorities who, using this verse as a proof-text, do not prohibit gentiles from worshiping false gods with this intent. However, all authorities agree that Jews may not worship in this manner.

The fifth fundamental principle is that it is fit to serve God alone... and not the entities who are below Him: the angels, the stars, the spheres, or the fundamental elements.<br>
This is because they all perform their functions because of their inherent nature. They have no control or choice, but merely [fulfill] God's will.<br>

Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.3,"All these prohibitions<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> mentioned in this and<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> there are

The Rambam's statements here are used as support to negate the opinion of the <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 345), which states that lashes are never given for the violation of a prohibition that can be transgressed without performing a deed, even when one violates it by committing a deed.
</i> that reflects his concern with [idol worship] receives lashes [as punishment]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Punishment is administered only for the violation of prohibitions by actual deeds. In this instance, the prohibition can be violated by thought alone - in which case no punishment is administered. There are, however, also instances when deed - and thus punishment - is also involved.
<i>Eruvin</i> 17b notes that even though the proof-text for this prohibition mentions the word אל rather than לא, it is no different from other Torah prohibitions, and its violation is also punished by lashes.
</i>.<br>The worship of false gods is not the only subject to which we are forbidden to pay attention<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note the Introduction to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (<i>Shoresh</i> 9), which states that there are mitzvot of thought, of feeling, of speech, and of deed.
</i>; rather, we are warned not to consider any thought which will cause us to uproot one of the fundamentals of the Torah. We should not turn our minds to these matters, think about them, or be drawn after the thoughts of our hearts<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
The Rambam explains the reason for these prohibitions:
In general, people have limited powers of understanding, and not all minds are capable of appreciating the truth in its fullness. - See also <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 2:12, 4:11,13, where the Rambam mentions the restrictions placed on the study of deeper spiritual concepts lest one err in his conception.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 47) defines this mitzvah as follows:
</i>.<br>In general, people have limited powers of understanding, and not all minds are capable of appreciating the truth in its fullness. [Accordingly,] were a person to follow the thoughts of his heart, it is possible that he would destroy the world because of his limited understanding<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There are several ways to understand the expression used by the Rambam: ""destroy the world."" On the most obvious level, it is a figurative expression, not to be interpreted literally. On a deeper level, it can be seen as a reference to his statements in <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:4 that a person should always ""see himself and the entire world as equally balanced between merit and sin. If he commits one sin, he tips his balance and that of the entire world to guilt and brings on destruction.""
Today, we can appreciate the Rambam's words in a very literal sense. Society as a whole is plagued by irrational acts of violence. and on a global level it is possible for utter destruction to be brought about if a few individuals act irresponsibly.
</i>.<br>What is implied? There are times when a person will stray after star worship<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and consider it beneficial
</i>, and times when he will wonder about God's oneness: Perhaps He is one, perhaps He is not?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 7:1, the Rambam states: ""It is [one] of the foundations of [our] faith that God communicates by prophecy with man."" Similarly, the Rambam lists the concept of prophecy as the sixth of his Thirteen Principles of Faith.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Our translation is based on Rashi's interpretation of <i>Chaggigah</i>, <i>ibid.</i>
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Chaggigah</i> 11b states: ""It would have been better for someone who considers the [following] four matters never to have been created."" The passage continues by mentioning the four questions quoted by the Rambam here.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his Commentary on the Mishnah (Introduction to the Tenth Chapter of <i>Sanhedrin</i>), the Rambam lists the oneness of God as the second of his Thirteen Principles of Faith. See also <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:7, 2:10.
</i> [He might also wonder:] What exists above, [in the heavenly realms]? What exists below [them]? What was before time? What will be after time? Similarly, [one might wonder about] prophecy: Perhaps it is true, perhaps it is not? And [one may also wonder] about the Torah: Perhaps it emanates from God, perhaps it does not?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's statements should be interpreted, not as a restriction of one's thinking processes, but rather a call to structure our thoughts according to the guidelines provided for us by the Torah.
In this context, it is worthy to refer to <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 4:13:
I maintain that it is not proper for a person to stroll in the <i>Pardes</i> (study Torah's mystic secrets) unless he has filled his belly with bread and meat. ""Bread and meat"" refer to the knowledge of what is permitted and what is forbidden, and similar matters concerning other mitzvot. Even though the Sages referred to these as ""a small matter"" - since our Sages said: ""'A great matter,' this is <i>Ma'aseh Merkavah</i>. 'A small matter,' this is the debates of Abbaye and Ravva"" - nevertheless, it is fitting for them to be given precedence, because they settle a person's mind.
Thus, the Rambam teaches that a person should not embark on the study of deep spiritual questions until he has gained the intellectual maturity which comes from Torah study. Even after a person gains such maturity, there is no need for him to concern himself with the study of idol worship because there is no value which he can derive from such study.
<b>The Torah has warned about this matter, saying [Numbers 15:39]: ""Do not stray after your hearts and eyes, which have led you to immorality"" -</b> <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 47) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 387) counts this as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.
<b>i.e., each one of you should not follow his limited powers of understanding and think that he has comprehended the truth. -</b> Instead, he should follow a structured pattern for intellectual growth and development prescribed by a Torah master.
<b>Our Sages -</b> <i>Sifre, Sh'lach</i>. (See also <i>Berachot</i> 12b.)
<b>[interpreted this warning]: ""After your hearts,"" this refers to heresy -</b> For a more precise definition of the term <i>minut</i>, see Halachah 5 and the commentary.
<b>""after your eyes,"" this refers to immorality. -</b> In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam explains:
Their intent in mentioning ""immorality"" was the pursuit of pleasure and physical desire, [to the extent that] one's mind is constantly preoccupied with such thoughts.
<b>This prohibition - though [severe,] causing a person to be prevented [from attaining a portion] in the world to come -</b> In <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:8, the Rambam includes among the categories of those who have no portion in the world to come: ""nonbelievers, heretics, those who deny the Torah,... those who cause the many to sin, and those who depart from the ways of the community."" Following the whims of one's heart can lead to the transgression of these prohibitions.
<b>is not punishable by lashes -</b> because it does not involve a deed.
There is some difficulty with the Rambam's statements. The transgression of both of the prohibitions mentioned in this halachah involves thought and can also involve deed. Just as the commentaries suggested several deeds which violate the first prohibition, similar acts could be performed which violate the latter prohibition. The Rambam, however, appears to imply that there is no way that the latter prohibition could be transgressed in a manner warranting punishment.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As the eighth of his Thirteen Principles of Faith, the Rambam states: ""The Torah which we have was given by Moses our teacher... and emanates - in its entirety - from the Almighty."" He explains that this also applies to the oral law. He reiterates this concept in his introduction to the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.
</i><br>Since he may not know the guidelines with which to evaluate [ideas that will lead him] to the truth in its fullness, he may come to heresy. The Torah has warned about this matter, saying [Numbers 15:39]: ""Do not stray after your hearts and eyes, which have led you to immorality"" - i.e., each one of you should not follow his limited powers of understanding and think that he has comprehended the truth.<br>Our Sages [interpreted this warning]: ""After your hearts,"" this refers to heresy; ""after your eyes,"" this refers to immorality.

Note the <i>Tanya</i>, Chapter 20, which explains that the two mitzvot, the acknowledgement of God and the negation of idol worship, are the foundation of all Torah practice. Therefore, the entire Jewish people heard God proclaim these two mitzvot on Mount Sinai. Every act a person performs can be seen as either the acknowledgement of God or the acknowledgement of a set of values aside from His, equivalent figuratively to the acceptance of another god.

Herein, there is a lesson regarding the nature of the conflict between the Greeks and the Jews. The Greeks were not anxious to stamp out Judaism entirely. They were prepared to accept Judaism as one of the cultures of the Mediterranean area, which they would incorporate into an all-encompassing collection of knowledge and values; i.e., the sacraments of Judaism would remain, but they would become impure, tainted by Greek culture.
</i>.<br>The Jews suffered great difficulties from them, for they oppressed them greatly until the God of our ancestors had mercy upon them, delivered them from their hand, and saved them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> By calling attention to the Divine origin of the Jews' victory before mentioning the Hasmoneans, the Rambam emphasizes the miraculous and spiritual nature of the miracle.
</i>. The sons of the Hasmoneans, the High Priests, overcame [them], slew them, and saved the Jews from their hand<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The valiant struggle of the Hasmoneans who were able to defeat the most powerful armies of the world with guerilla forces is recounted in many sources.

There are many Rabbinic authorities who are highly critical of the Hasmoneans for assuming the kingship of the Jewish people. (See the Ramban's commentary on the Torah, <i>Parashat Vayichi</i>.) Although in <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 1:7-8, the Rambam writes that King David's descendants have an eternal right to the monarchy in Jerusalem, his description here of the Hasmoneans as kings does not have the slightest intimation of criticism; if anything, the contrary is true.
Several laws regarding the nature of kingship are derived from the Hasmonean kings and others, even from the kings of Herod's dynasty, who ruled after them.

Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 3.3,"Accordingly, the Sages of that generation<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Shabbat</i> 21b states that the celebration of the holiday was ordained in the year following the miracle.

As the Rambam explains in <i>Hilchot Purim</i>, Chapter 2, ""happiness"" is associated with feasting. In this context, the <i>Yam shel Shlomo, Bava Kama</i> 7:37, explains that according to the Rambam - in contrast to the rulings of the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 670:2) - the festive meals customarily served on Chanukah can be considered to be feasts associated with a mitzvah.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There are many who question why the holiday is celebrated for eight days, since the miracle was only for seven (for there was enough oil for the Menorah to burn for a single day). The Rambam's words seem to allude to a resolution of this difficulty. The miraculous lighting of the <i>Menorah</i> began on the twenty-fifth of Kislev and continued for eight days.
[Note, however, the <i>Pri Chadash</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 670:1), who explains that, according to the Rambam, the first day of the celebration was instituted in appreciation of the military victories, while the remaining seven came in recognition of the miracle of the <i>Menorah</i>.]

This certainly does not express the Rambam's view. <i>Megillat Ta'anit</i> associates Chanukah with <i>chanukat hamizbe'ach</i>, the rededication of the altar in the Temple, but there is no mention of this event by the Rambam here.
</i>. It is forbidden to eulogize and fast on them, as on the days of Purim<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned in the commentary on Chapter 2, Halachah 13, the prohibition to eulogize and fast applies only on the days of Chanukah themselves, and not on the preceding or succeeding days.
Significantly, unlike Purim, there is no prohibition against work on Chanukah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 670:1).
</i>. Lighting the candles on these days is a Rabbinic mitzvah, like the reading of the Megillah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This emphasizes the Rambam's perspective that the allusion to the obligation to read the Megillah in the Megillah itself does not change the status of this mitzvah. (See also the commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 1.)

Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 3.6,"It is not the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> on Chanukah alone that is a Rabbinic ordinance, b<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Ra'avad notes that the Sages (see <i>Pesachim</i> 95b, <i>Arachin</i> 10b) consider Isaiah 30:29, ""This song shall be to you as the night of the sanctification of the festivals"" to be a reference to the recitation of <i>Hallel</i>. Because of this association with a Biblical verse, he considers the obligation to recite <i>Hallel</i> as different in status from other Rabbinic commandments. Indeed, the <i>Halachot Gedolot</i> considers this obligation to be one of the 613 mitzvot. This runs contrary to the position the Rambam mentions in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (General Principle 1), where he states that even those mitzvot ordained by the prophets are considered to be Rabbinic commandments.
The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the verse in Isaiah reflects a command to recite <i>Hallel</i> in appreciation whenever God redeems us from difficulties. (For this reason, it is customary in certain communities to recite <i>Hallel</i> on the anniversary of a miraculous deliverance.) The custom of reciting <i>Hallel</i> on festivals, however, was established afterwards.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since Chanukah is a Rabbinic holiday, one might think that the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> on those days is Rabbinic in origin, while the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> on the festivals has its source in the Torah itself. This is not the case.

T<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rosh HaShanah is a day of happiness. Thus, Nechemiah 8:10, ""Eat sumptuous foods and drink sweet beverages... for the happiness of God is your strength,"" is interpreted as a reference to Rosh HaShanah. Nevertheless, it is not a day of ""extra celebration<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Arachin</i> 10b relates:

The ministering angels enquired before the Holy One, blessed be He: ""Master of the world: Why do the Jews not recite songs [of praise] before You on Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur?""
He told them: ""Is it proper that the King should sit on the throne of judgment with the book of life and the book of death open before Him and the Jews should recite songs [of praise]?""

The order of the psalms themselves, however, may be altered. This view, however, is not accepted by most authorities, and the prevailing practice is to follow their ruling.
See also <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 2:11, where the Rambam states that it is not absolutely necessary to read the different passages of the <i>Shema</i> in order. On the other hand, there the Rambam explains his decision, stating that the passages of the <i>Shema</i> are not found in this order in the Torah.

As mentioned in the commentary on that halachah, the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 65:1) rules that should a person be forced to refrain from completing the <i>Shema</i> because the place in which he is located contains filth, he does not fulfill his obligation if he waited the amount of time required to recite the <i>Shema</i> in its entirety.

The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, however, is more restrictive and allows interruptions only when there is a need.
In their analysis of <i>Berachot</i> 14a (the source for this halachah), Rabbenu Asher and other commentaries differ and compare the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> to the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>.

Making an interruption is significant when a blessing is recited. When a blessing is not recited, what does it matter whether one makes an interruption or not?
Although this explanation may be acceptable according to the Rambam's view, according to the <i>Shulchan Aruch's</i> ruling mentioned below, a different rationale must be applied. (See <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 422.)

One may, however, greet a person one must honor and respond to greetings given by anyone.

Torah Study 6.1,"It is a mitzvah to respect<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and stand up in deference to him as implied by the verse quoted
</i> every Torah sage<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 209), the Rambam counts this as one of the Torah's 613 mitzvot. (See also <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, Mitzvah 257.)
In the Guide to the Perplexed (Vol. III, Chapter 36), the Rambam explains the motivating principle for this mitzvah: If respect is not shown to the Sages, their teachings will not be upheld and Torah study will be neglected.
</i>, even if he is not one's teacher<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in which case more severe measures of honor are necessary, as mentioned in the previous chapter.
The Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 244:1) states that this obligation applies only to another sage who surpasses oneself in knowledge.
</i>, as [Leviticus 19:32] states: ""Stand up before a white-haired [man] and respect an elder."" [The word] <i>zakein</i>, [translated as ""elder,"" alludes to the Hebrew words<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>zeh shekanah chochmah,</i>
</i> meaning] ""one who has acquired wisdom<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> even if he is young.
The definition of a Torah sage is a matter of question. <i>Kiddushin</i> 49b states:
""On the condition that I am a student"" - we do not say that he must be comparable to Shimon ben Azzai or Shimon ben Zoma. Rather, anyone who can be asked about any matter in the area where he is studying and can reply...<br>
""On the condition that I am a wise man"" - we do not say that he has to be like the Sages of Yavneh....Rather, anyone who can be asked about any Torah subject and can reply...
The Rambam quotes this statement in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i>. Nevertheless, since he does not specify such a definition here, in <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i>, one may therefore assume that in this context, he does not limit himself to that definition. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 244:2) addresses himself to this issue and explains that here we are referring to a Torah sage who possesses a prodigious amount of knowledge and is considered unique within his community.
</i>.""<br>When is one obligated to stand before him? When he approaches within four cubits of him<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Kiddushin</i> 33a states that once the sage comes this close, standing before him can easily be appreciated as a sign of respect. Note the contrast between this halachah and the measure of respect due one's own teacher, as mentioned in Chapter 5, Halachah 7.

Torah Study 6.2,"One should not stand before [a sage] in a bathhouse<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., in the inner rooms where people stand undressed. The general principle followed is: in the places where it is permitted to recite words of Torah, one must honor a sage; where one may not recite words of Torah, one should not honor a sage (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).
</i> or toilet, for it is stated [<i>ibid.</i>]: ""Stand up...and respect...,"" [implying] standing up that conveys respect.<br>C<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This law is not mentioned with regard to one's own teacher, since, as stated in Chapter 5, Halachah 6, one may not enter a bathhouse together with one's teacher (Rav Kapach).
Craftsmen are not obligated to stand before the Torah Sages while they are involved in their work - The commentaries disagree whether a craftsman may interrupt his work to show a sage this token of respect or not. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that a craftsman is permitted to do so, and rules accordingly in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 244:5). In contrast, Rabbenu Nissim (<i>Chulin</i> 54b) maintains that a craftsman is not permitted to stand, because the general impression that will be created - i.e., some craftsmen standing in honor of the sage and some not - will not be favorable.
This difference of opinion exists only with regard to craftsmen working independently. All authorities agree that a craftsman hired by others may not stand. His time is not his own, and by standing, he steals time from his employer.
for it is stated: ""Stand up...and respect...."" [It can be inferred that] just as showing respect does not involve a financial loss, standing need not involve a financial loss. - The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> objects to these statements, noting that the Rambam's phraseology is not an exact quote from <i>Kiddushin</i> 33a, which is his source. Nevertheless, it can be explained that the Rambam is not quoting that Talmudic passage, but rather explaining a concept that can be inferred from it.
</i>raftsmen are not obligated to stand before the Torah sages while they are involved in their work, for it is stated: ""Stand up...and respect....""

Rather, this implies that it is forbidden for one to turn away when he sees the sage approaching from afar, so that when the latter approaches, he will not be obligated to stand.
</i> It is written [<i>ibid.</i>], ""and you shall fear your God."" With regard to all matters dependent on one's conscience, the Torah states: ""and you shall fear your God<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> who probes man's heart and understands his inner feelings.

Torah Study 6.3,"It is not proper for a sage to trouble the people and position himself before them so that they will have to stand for him<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Kiddushin</i> 33b derives this concept through the exegesis of the verse from Leviticus quoted above.
</i>. Rather, he should take shortcuts and have the intent that they should not see him, so that he will not trouble them to stand<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Kiddushin</i> 33a promises a sage long life for following this practice.

The <i>Bnei Binyamin</i> notes an apparent contradiction between the Rambam's statements and <i>BaMidbar Rabbah</i> 15:17. There, the <i>Midrash</i> relates that Rav Abba Cohen would always avoid crowds, lest he trouble them by causing them to rise. When he mentioned this to Rabbi Yosse, the son of Rabbi Zevida, the latter reprimanded him, explaining that he would be doing them a great favor by having them stand before him, because this would lead to the fear of God, as implied by Leviticus (<i>ibid.</i>): ""Stand up before a white-haired [man]...and you shall fear your God.""
The <i>Bnei Binyamin</i> explains that everything depends on the sage's intention. A righteous man who is not at all motivated by self-interest may appear before crowds. However, a person who is concerned with his own pride should avoid them.

Torah Study 6.4,"Riding is considered to be walking<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., we do not say that since the sage is seated on his beast, it is not considered as if he is walking. However, in other contexts - see <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 2:2-3 - the Rambam considers riding as comparable to sitting.
</i>. Just as one stands before [a sage who is] walking, so one should stand before one who is riding<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Kiddushin</i> 33a relates that Abbaye would stand as soon as he saw the donkey of Rav Yosef, his teacher, approach.

The <i>Pri Chadash</i> and other commentaries question the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>'s interpretation. One point of difficulty with the halachah in general is that it appears to refer to one's personal teacher, and thus it would more appropriately have been mentioned in the previous chapter.

Torah Study 6.6,"One who sees a sage need not stand in deference to him until he reaches within four cubits of him; once he has passed, he may sit<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This halachah in its entirety is quoted from the <i>Midrash Hagadol, Shemot</i> 33:8. (With slight textual differences, it also appears in <i>Kiddushin</i> 33b.) Nevertheless, the question arises: Why does the Rambam mention this particular clause? It appears redundant in light of Halachah 1. Perhaps his intent was to emphasize the contrast between an ordinary Sage and others of greater stature.
</i>.<br>Should one see the <i>av beit din</i>, o<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The sage second in stature to the <i>nasi</i>, and who acts as the latter's assistant (<i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 1:3).
The laws regarding a <i>nasi</i> and an <i>av beit din</i> are also quoted in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 244:13-15), which, in contrast to the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, mentions only those halachot that are applicable in the present age. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> (244:11) questions that inclusion, noting that today's <i>rashei yeshivot</i> and <i>avot batei hadin</i> are not paid the same tokens of respect as the <i>nasi</i> and <i>av beit din</i> mentioned here.
</i>ne should stand in deference to him from the time he sees him - as far away as he can see<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., as soon as the <i>av beit din</i> appears on the horizon

</i>.<br>Should one see the <i>nasi</i>, o<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as explained with regard to the <i>av beit din</i>.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam describes this position as follows:
The wisest sage among them is appointed to be the head. He is the Rosh Yeshivah. He is the person whom the Sages referred to as <i>nasi</i> in all the sources, taking the place of Moses, our teacher.
</i>ne should stand in deference to him from the time he sees him<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the <i>av beit din</i>
</i> - as far away as he can see. He may not sit until he has reached his place or passed [beyond his field of vision] and is hidden<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Kiddushin</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) derives this from Exodus 33:8, which relates that:
Whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people would rise. Each person would stand near his tent, gazing at Moses until he came to the tent.
Should a nasi [desire to] waive the honor due him, he may forgo it. - i.e., although people are obligated to honor the <i>nasi</i>, should he desire to forgo those honors, there is no objection. In contrast, a king may never forgo his honor and must constantly be treated with reverence. (See <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 2:3.)
<i>Kiddushin</i> 32b relates the following discussion of this law:
An incident occurred when Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Yehoshua, and Rabbi Tzadok were participating in the wedding feast of Rabban Gamliel's son, and Rabban Gamliel poured drinks for them. He offered a cup to Rabbi Eliezer, and he refused to accept it. He offered a cup to Rabbi Yehoshua and he accepted it.<br>
Rabbi Eliezer told him: ""Yehoshua, what is this? We are sitting and Rabban Gamliel is pouring drinks for us!""<br>
He replied to him: ""We find [a precedent when] a person of greater stature served others. Abraham surpassed all others in his generation, yet [Genesis 18:8] relates that 'he stood over them [to serve them']. Do not think that he thought they were angels; he thought they were Arabs. If so, why shouldn't we let Rabban Gamliel serve us?""
The above laws refer to instances when a sage is sighted in the public thoroughfare. The following laws apply when he enters the house of study (<i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i>). (See <i>Horayot</i> 13b.)
</i>.<br>Should a <i>nasi</i> [desire to] waive the honor due him, he may forgo it.<br>When the <i>nasi</i> enters, a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as a sign of respect to him.

</i>. When the <i>av beit din</i> enters, t<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> At present, when we are used to auditoriums with fixed seats, the setting for this law is difficult to picture. However, in Talmudic times, the people would sit on the floor. When the <i>av beit din</i> arrived, the people sitting between the entrance and his place would stand and create a path for him two rows wide.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the house of study

<i>Horayot</i> 13b relates that, originally, the people would show the same token of respect to the <i>av beit din</i> and other sages as to the <i>nasi</i>. In order to preserve the authority of his office, Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel, the <i>nasi</i>, ordained that a lesser degree of respect be shown to all other sages.

Therefore, they are allowed to proceed to their places at the front of the house of study, even if doing so is somewhat discourteous to the people who have already taken places.
In this vein, <i>Yevamot</i> 105b states: Those who are required by the holy nation may step over the heads of the holy nation. However, how dare one who is not required by the holy nation step over the heads of the holy nation!
</i>.<br>It is not praiseworthy for a sage<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Indeed, <i>Berachot</i> 43b lists this as one of six undesirable tendencies that a sage should guard himself against acquiring.

</i>. If one leaves to tend to his needs<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., to use the toilet (<i>Horayot</i> <i>ibid.</i>). Alternatively, the term <i>litzorech</i> can be translated as ""for a necessary purpose"" - i.e., for a purpose that benefits the people at large (<i>Tosafot, Yevamot</i> 105b).
</i>, he may return to his place<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Forcing the people to stand for him a second time, or the sage's stepping over them is not considered to be discourteous, since he was compelled to leave by forces beyond his control.

Torah Study 6.9,"We should stand before an old man of exceedingly advanced age<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 244:1) explains this as referring to a man of seventy. Others, emphasizing that the Rambam uses the term ""exceedingly advanced age,"" see that as a reference to <i>Gittin</i> 28a, which describes a person ninety years old with such terminology.
</i>, even if he is not a sage<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 244:1) emphasizes that there is no obligation to stand before a wicked man.
The commentaries have raised questions concerning this law, noting that it reflects a difference of opinion between two Talmudic sages, and yet the Rambam's statements do not conform exactly to either position.
<i>Kiddushin</i> 32b states:
""Stand up before a white-haired [man]."" Does this apply even with regard to a common person of advanced age? The Torah continues [mentioning] ""an elder."" [The term] ""elder"" refers only to a wise man, as implied by [Numbers 11:16]: ""Assemble seventy of Israel's elders.""<br>
Rabbi Yosse Hag'lili states: [The word] ""elder"" means ""one who has acquired wisdom...""<br>
Issi ben Yehudah states: ""Stand up before a white-haired [man]"" - Every white-haired man is included therein.
The Talmud explains that although the first opinion is similar to that of Rabbi Yosse Hag'lili, there are minor differences between them.
From the Rambam's statements in Halachah 1, it would appear that he follows Rabbi Yosse Hag'lili's position. However, this halachah appears to echo Issi ben Yehudah's view.
</i>. Even a sage who is young is obligated to stand before an old man of exceedingly advanced age. Nevertheless, he<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., the sage of youthful age

Torah Study 6.10,"Torah sages should not personally take part<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> However, the sages must bear their share of the cost of such projects (<i>Hilchot Sh'chenim</i> 6:6). The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 243:1-2) adds that they are obligated to pay only the cost of the raw materials. They need not hire workers to take their place. This applies only when the work is performed by the members of the community. However, if workers are hired by the community to complete the task, the sages must also pay their share.

</i>. [The same applies regarding] a present to be offered to the king<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The order in which this law is taught is somewhat questionable. <i>Bava Batra</i> 8a, the source for these laws, mentions a sage's lack of obligation to contribute to a present for the king as part of his absolution from taxes, and not as a leniency granted to him because ""his Torah protects him.""
</i>.<br>Similarly, they are not obligated to pay taxes - neither [their share in] a tax levied on the city as a whole nor a head tax levied on each individual<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Bava Batra</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) also mentions that Artashta, the Persian king who sent Ezra to rebuild Jerusalem, freed all those involved in this holy work from all forms of taxes and tribute. (See Ezra 7:24.)
The Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 243:2) states that even if the gentile government levies taxes on a Torah sage, the community is obligated to pay the tax on his behalf.
The commentaries question whether there are sages today who are worthy of these benefits. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 243:2) explains that these privileges should be extended only to those sages who devote the majority of their time to Torah study and limit their business involvement to the minimum necessary to earn a livelihood. Other authorities have voiced other opinions, some stricter and some more lenient. (See <i>Siftei Cohen, Yoreh De'ah</i> 243:7; <i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 163:14.)
</i> - as [Hoshea 8:10] states: ""Although they will give among the nations<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> an allusion to the payment of taxes

Similarly, if a Torah sage has merchandise to sell, he is allowed to sell it first, and no other person at the marketplace is allowed to sell until he does. - Although the Rambam harshly forbade a Torah sage from taking money from charity because of his knowledge (see Chapter 1, Halachah 7 and Chapter 3, Halachah 10), he allows a sage these privileges in earning his livelihood.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 243:4) states that this law applies only when the market is controlled by Jews. However, if there are gentiles who will sell their goods regardless, the other Jewish merchants are not obligated to risk suffering a loss.
</i>.""<br>Similarly, if a Torah sage has merchandise to sell, he is allowed to sell it first, and no other person at the marketplace is allowed to sell until he does. Similarly, if he has a legal matter<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., a case to be tried at court
</i> and stands among many other litigants, he is given priority<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sh'vuot</i> 30a relates:
Rav Olah, the son of Rav Ellai, was involved in a judgment before Rav Nachman. Rav Yosef sent [Rav Nachman a message:] ""Olah is our colleague in Torah and mitzvot.""<br>
Rav Nachman said: ""Why did he send this [notice] to me? To curry favor before me."" Afterwards, he said: ""[His purpose was] so that I try his case first.""
<i>Tosafot</i> questions this teaching, noting that there is a positive commandment to try every case in the order that it comes before the court. Two resolutions are offered:<br>
a) If both cases come to the court at the same time, the court should try the case of the sage first;<br>
b) The positive commandment to honor a sage overrides this positive commandment. Hence, the sage's case is tried first, even if it came before the court later.
The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 15:1) accept the latter position. (See also <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 21:6.)

[Also,] he is allowed to sit<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sh'vuot</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) states: 'And the two men shall stand' (Deuteronomy 19:17 : it is a mitzvah for the litigants to stand."" Nevertheless, as a token of respect for the sage, he is invited to sit.
The same privilege is also granted to the litigant opposing him, because otherwise, this gesture would be considered to be an unfair advantage granted to the sage. It is worthwhile to note that in <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 21:5, the Rambam writes that, at present, it is customary to seat all litigants, ""for we do not have the potential to carry out the judgments of the Torah in the proper way."" These laws are quoted in the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat</i> 17:2-3.

It is interesting to note that the Rambam's interpretation differs from that of Rashi - who equates the Sages with ""His prophets"" - and of the Maharsha, who interprets ""the messengers of God"" as the reference to the Sages.

The decision has already been rendered that whoever embarrasses a sage - even with words alone - is fined...eight and three quarter <i>sela'im</i> of gold.<br>
It is an accepted tradition that this fine is collected everywhere, whether in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> or in the Diaspora. Decisions of this nature were frequently rendered before us in Spain. Some sages would forgo payment, and that is commendable. Others would demand payment, but accept a compromise. However, the judges would tell the person who caused the embarrassment: ""you are obligated to give him a <i>litra</i> of gold.""
The Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 243:7) states that, at present, there are no sages whose stature is that great that they are to be awarded ""a litra of gold,"" if they are publicly shamed. However, a person who embarrasses a sage is obligated to pay damages.
This is the general opinion of most authorities at present. However, in the generations before the Ramah - and in certain communities, even after his decision - this fine was, in fact, imposed if someone publicly embarrassed a sage.
Even - The use of this term implies that this is a lesser transgression than embarrassing a sage in his lifetime (Rivash, Responsum 120).

<b>If the sage desires to forgive him -</b> Note Chapter 7, Halachah 13, which explains that this is the general practice of Torah sages, who are willing to forgo insults to them. However, that halachah specifies that such leniency can be granted only when the insult was made in private.

</i> apply? When the ban was imposed because he acted disrespectfully<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> notes that a ban can be imposed only because of disrespectful behavior. However, this punishment may not be administered for failing to honor the sage.
</i> to a Torah sage<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Many commentaries have noted the difficulty in the Rambam's words. This statement implies that there is a certain leniency with regard to a ban imposed because of the embarrassment of a Torah sage. However, the first of the 24 reasons the Rambam lists for imposing a ban of ostracism that must be observed by every Jew is disgracing a Torah sage. (See <i>Avodat Hamelech</i>.)
Among the resolutions of the difficulty offered is that there is a difference between a ban imposed by a court according to Torah law and a ban issued by a sage individually to protect his own honor.

A significant number of reasons are also mentioned in the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Mo'ed Katan</i> 3:1); however, the majority of the reasons mentioned by the Rambam below were gathered by him from many different passages throughout the Talmud.
</i><br>
a) a person who disgraces a sage<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as explained above
</i>, even after his passing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 19a relates that a ban was imposed on a person for disgracing the sages Shemayah and Avtalion, even after their passing.

b) a person who embarrasses a messenger of a court<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Kiddushin</i> 70b relates that Rav would impose a ban of ostracism for this reason.
</i>;<br>
c) a person who calls a colleague a slave<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See <i>Kiddushin</i> 28a.
</i>;<br>
d) a person who was ordered [to appear before] a court at a specific time and did not come<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See <i>Bava Kama</i> 112b and also <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 25:8.
</i>;<br>
e) a person who treats even one point of Rabbinic law with disrespect<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Eduyot</i> 5:6 relates that Eliezer ben Chanoch was placed under ban for raising difficulties regarding the practice of washing one's hands, a Rabbinic ordinance.
</i>; needless to say, this applies regarding [matters of] Torah law<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that the Rambam uses the expression, ""treats with disrespect."" If a person transgresses a command, he is punished by other means. However, ostracism is imposed for causing others to view a Torah or Rabbinic law disparagingly.
</i>;<br>
f) a person who refuses to comply with the decisions [rendered by a court] is placed under ban until he complies<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Bava Kama</i> 113a serves as the source for this law. Note the slight difference between the Rambam's statements here and those in <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> <i>ibid.</i>
<b>g) a person who possesses an entity that can cause damage - e.g., a dangerous dog or a faulty ladder - is placed under ban until he removes that entity -</b> This concept, with these two examples, is quoted from <i>Bava Kama</i> 15b.
<b>h) a person who sells land to a gentile is placed under ban until he accepts responsibility for any damages which the gentile may cause his Jewish neighbor -</b> <i>Bava Kama</i> 112a mentions this point.
<i>Tosafot</i> postulates that this restriction applies only when a Jewish colleague is prepared to pay the same amount as the gentile. However, if the gentile offers more than the Jew, the owner is not liable to sustain the loss. However, in <i>Hilchot Sh'chenim</i> 12:7, where the Rambam quotes this law, he does not make such a provision. Furthermore, in several of his responsa, he forbids selling property that borders on the property of a fellow Jew to a gentile, even when substantial losses are involved (Rav Kapach).
<b>i) a person who testifies against a Jewish colleague in a secular court and causes money which Torah law would not [require him to pay] to be expropriated from him is placed under ban until he repays [that amount] -</b> See <i>Bava Kama</i> 113b. In <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 26:7, the Rambam writes:
Whoever has his case judged by gentile judges and courts...is wicked and is considered as if he cursed...the Torah of Moses....<br>
If gentiles rule his society and his fellow litigant is strong-willed, and it is thus impossible to collect [one's due] from him according to Jewish law, he should call him to a Jewish court first. If he refuses to come, he should receive the court's permission to preserve his property through secular law.
<b>j) a butcher who is a priest -</b> but not a priest who slaughters for his personal use (<i>Hilchot Bikkurim</i> 9:8)
<b>and does not separate the priestly gifts -</b> the foreleg, jaw, and the maw, which must be given to a priest from every animal slaughtered. (See Deuteronomy 18:3; <i>Hilchot Bikkurim</i>, Chapter 9.)
<b>and give them to another priest is placed under ban until he gives them -</b> <i>Chulin</i> 132b
<b>k) a person who violates the sanctity of the second day of the festivals in the Diaspora -</b> See <i>Pesachim</i> 52a.
<b>even though [their observance] is only a custom -</b> The <i>Or Sameach</i> explains that the Rambam added this clause because he had already stated that a person who disgraces a Rabbinic ordinance is liable to be banned. Hence, he clarifies that, at present, since we use a fixed calendar, the observance of the second day of the festivals is no longer considered to be a Rabbinic decree and is only a custom. (See <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Yom Tov</i> 6:14.)
<b>l) a person who performs work on Pesach eve after noon -</b> Pesach eve is singled out because the Paschal sacrifice was offered at that time. (See <i>Pesachim</i> 50b; <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Yom Tov</i> 8:17.)
<b>m) a person who takes God's name in vain or takes an oath casually -</b> See <i>Nedarim</i> 7b; <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 12:9.
<b>n) a person who causes the many to desecrate God's name -</b> This is derived from the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Mo'ed Katan</i> 3:1), which quotes how, in a time of drought, Choni HaM'agel drew a circle on the ground and called out to God: ""I will not move from here until You provide rain.""
Shimon ben Shetach told Choni that his act warranted ostracism, because if God had not answered his prayers, many of the people would have lost faith. Nevertheless, Shimon ben Shetach did not enforce that punishment after he saw how God answered Choni's prayers.
<b>o) a person who causes the many to eat sacrificial food outside [its proper place] -</b> <i>Berachot</i> 19a relates how Todus of Rome instituted the custom of roasting lambs on Pesach eve in a manner similar to the Paschal sacrifice. The sages told him that, were it not for his other personal qualities, he would have been placed under ban, for it is possible that someone would actually consider his lamb as a Paschal sacrifice.
<b>p) a person who calculates the years [and declares a leap year] or fixes the day of the new month in the Diaspora -</b> <i>Berachot</i> 63a relates that Isaiah 2:3: ""Out of Zion will come forth the Torah..."" implies that the above decisions must be made in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, and prescribes this punishment for someone who makes them in the Diaspora.
<b>q) a person who causes the blind [ - i.e., the morally unaware - ] -</b> Note the commentaries to Leviticus 19:14 and also <i>Sefer Hachinuch</i> (Mitzvah 232).
<b>to stumble -</b> <i>Mo'ed Katan</i> 17a relates that Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi's maidservant issued a ban of ostracism on a father who physically beat his son after the latter had reached adulthood. By doing so, he was goading his son into rebelling against his father. This ban was respected by all the sages.
<b>r) a person who prevents the many from performing a mitzvah -</b> See the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Mo'ed Katan</i> 3:1. See also <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 4:1.
<b>s) a butcher who sold non-kosher meat -</b> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> quotes <i>Sanhedrin</i> 25a as teaching that Rav Nachman administered such a punishment. However, in our texts of the Talmud, that passage does not mention ostracism specifically.
<b>t) a butcher who does not inspect his knife in the presence of a sage -</b> See <i>Chullin</i> 18a. In <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i> 1:26, the Rambam states that this halachah applies even if later the knife was inspected and found to be kosher. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that leniency is taken in this matter, because it has become customary for ritual slaughter to be performed only by experts. (See <i>Tur, Yoreh De'ah</i> 18.)
<b>u) a person who intentionally causes himself to have an erection -</b> <i>Niddah</i> 13b; for by doing so, he leads himself to immodest thoughts, at the very least. (See also <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 21:18.)
<b>v) a person who divorced his wife, and then entered into a partnership or business dealing with her which requires them to come into contact. When they come to court, they are placed under ban -</b> After divorce, a couple should have as little contact together as possible, lest the familiarity they previously enjoyed lead them to sexual behavior outside the bounds of marriage. (See also <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 21:27.)
<b>w) a sage whose reputation is unsavory -</b> <i>Mo'ed Katan</i> 17a relates how Rabbi Yehudah passed a ban of ostracism on a sage for this reason.
<b>x) a person who places a person under ban when the latter does not deserve [such punishment] -</b> <i>Mo'ed Katan</i> 17a relates the following episode: Resh Lakish was employed as a watchman and noticed a thief. Although he shouted at him, the thief did not stop. Therefore, Resh Lakish proclaimed: ""You are under a ban of ostracism.""
The thief replied: ""Although I am obligated to repay him, I am not obligated to be ostracized. You should be ostracized.""
When the matter was related in the House of Study, the sages stated that Resh Lakish's ban was not justified, but the thief's was.
The Ra'avad and other commentators mention other acts in which a ban of ostracism is in order. Indeed, in a number of cases (e.g., <i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 13:20), the Rambam himself mentions this punishment. The commentaries explain that the Rambam limits himself to 24 instances, because that is the figure mentioned in the Talmud. However, these can be considered to be general categories including other instances as well.

</i>.<br>Nevertheless, it is necessary to construct a partition at least ten handbreadths high in front of chametz belonging to a gentile<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> A similar partition is not required when a gentile entrusts other forbidden objects to a Jew. As mentioned above, greater stringencies are taken regarding chametz than other forbidden substances, since the use of chametz is permitted during the entire year.
</i>, lest one come to use it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that in Halachah 3:8, the Rambam considers covering the chametz with a utensil as a sufficient measure to prevent the use of the chametz. Two explanations are offered why, in the present instance, a more stringent measure is required:
a) the amount of chametz the gentile entrusted for safekeeping is probably too large to be covered by utensils;
b) covering the chametz with a utensil is only a temporary measure, intended to be effective only until the end of the day of the festival. Once that day is concluded, the chametz must be destroyed. In contrast, in this instance the chametz will remain in the Jew's possession throughout the entire holiday. Hence, more severe measures must be taken.
The Ramban and the <i>Ba'al HaItur</i> do not accept this requirement and maintain that if a Jew does not accept responsibility for the chametz, he is not obligated to construct a partition. All that is necessary is that the chametz be placed out of the way. Nevertheless, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 440:2) and the later halachic authorities all follow the Rambam's opinion.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 4.3,"A gentile who entrusted his chametz to a Jew: Should the Jew accept the responsibility of<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> caring for the chametz as a watchman would, and
</i> paying for the worth of the chametz if it is lost or stolen<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> due to factors other than his personal negligence. Rashi and Rabbenu Asher obligate a Jew to destroy any chametz belonging to a gentile for which he has accepted responsibility, even if his responsibility is less than that specified above. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 440:13,16) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> advise following the latter opinion.

</i>. Since he accepted responsibility for it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and would have to pay for it if it is lost.
<i>Pesachim</i> 5b offer two possible explanations why the chametz is considered as if it belongs to the Jew. One opinion maintains that throughout the Torah, an article that causes financial liability is considered as one's responsibility.
Another opinion maintains that in this instance, since the Torah adds a special commandment ""leaven should not be found,"" extra stringency must be taken. From this discussion, we see that the responsibility to destroy this chametz stems from the Torah itself, and is not merely a matter of Rabbinic decree.
</i>, it is considered as though it were his<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and, hence, must be destroyed. <i>Tosefot, Pesachim</i> 6a maintains that if a Jew designates a specific place within his home for the gentile and tells him to place his chametz there, he is not obligated to destroy it even though he accepted responsibility for it. Rashi does not accept this position. From the Rambam's omission of the matter, we may assume he also follows Rashi's view (<i>Lechem Mishnah</i>).
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 440:1) quotes the Rambam and hence, requires the acceptance of the more stringent position. However, the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (440:16) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (440:3) mention certain leniencies based on <i>Tosefot's</i> position.
</i>.<br>If he did not accept responsibility for it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the gentile's chametz
</i>, he may keep it in his domain<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> without transgressing the prohibitions against possessing chametz
</i> and may eat from it after Pesach<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in contrast to chametz possessed by a Jew during Pesach which is forbidden to be used (Halachah 1:4)
</i>, for it was in the gentile's possession<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Pesachim</i> 6a mentions a situation where a gentile brings chametz that he wishes to entrust to a Jew, and the latter designates a particular portion of the house for him to put the chametz. Under such circumstances, there is no need to destroy the chametz.
There are some authorities who explain that the Talmud is speaking about a situation in which the Jew accepted responsibility for the chametz. Nevertheless, since he told the gentile to put it in one specific place, it is considered as if that place belongs to the gentile, and thus the chametz is not found in the Jew's possession.
The Rambam does not accept this interpretation and requires the gentile's chametz to be destroyed whenever a Jew accepts responsibility for it. Though the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> mention the more lenient opinion, they require that the more stringent approach be followed.

</i>. This applies if the date specified was before Pesach<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> more specifically, before the sixth hour on the fourteenth of Nisan.
The Ra'avad disagrees with this law and maintains that if this stipulation was included, the chametz is considered as belonging to the gentile even if the date mentioned is after Pesach. The Rambam maintains that since the Jew has the right to redeem his chametz during Pesach, it is still considered his (Rabbenu Ephraim). In this instance, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 441:1) accepts the Ra'avad's view.
Nevertheless, this leniency applies only when the Jew willingly foregoes any right to the chametz and considers to have repaid his loan with it. Should the Jew decide to redeem his chametz after Pesach, he is retroactively considered the owner and is liable for possessing chametz throughout the holiday.
</i>.<br>However, if he did not tell him: ""you acquire the chametz [retroactively] from the present moment<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> even if the day of payment is fixed before Pesach
</i>,"" that chametz is<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> not considered as repayment for the loan. Rather, it is
</i> considered as an article entrusted to the gentile<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> to ensure payment. Hence, it is still considered as the Jew's property
</i>, and it is forbidden to benefit from it after Pesach<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as stated in Halachah 1:4.
The Ra'avad disagrees with this point as well, maintaining that if the date mentioned is before Pesach, the chametz becomes the gentile's property, and the Jew does not transgress the prohibitions against possessing chametz.
The difference between the Rambam and the Ra'avad revolves around the principle of <i>Asmachtah</i>, an agreement which was never intended to be fulfilled. The Ra'avad maintains that, generally, the fact that a borrower does not specify that the security would retroactively become the lender's property implies that he never really intended to sell it to him and always considers it as his own. Thus, were such a transaction to be carried out between Jews, the Ra'avad maintains that the security would never become the lender's property. However, he explains that this law applies only regarding business dealings carried out between Jews, and not to those involving gentiles. Therefore, in this instance, the chametz given as security becomes the gentile's property.
In contrast, the Rambam does not consider such an agreement an <i>Asmachtah</i>. However, he does not accept a gentile's right to an article given as security. Hence, though the date for repayment passes before Pesach, he still considers the article as belonging to its original Jewish owner.
In this matter, the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> follows the more stringent view if the chametz is worth more than the loan, and forbids its use after Pesach. However, if it is not worth more than the loan, that text and, similarly, the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i>, require the Jewish borrower to redeem his chametz before Pesach. However, if he fails to so, they allow people to rely on the Ra'avad's opinion and benefit from the chametz.
Different laws apply to chametz given to a Jew as security by a gentile or by another Jew. In the former instance, a Jew is considered the owner of the chametz if the agreement included the clause specifying retroactive ownership, even though the time for payment is not fixed until after Pesach. If the agreement lacked that clause, and the Jew is not held responsible for the chametz (see Halachah 3 above), the Jew is not liable for that chametz (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>). Nevertheless, other authorities do not accept this decision.

b) assure the Jewish owner of receiving the goods in return, or their monetary equivalent

The above restrictions apply even if the condition is phrased in a manner in which, once the gentile fulfills the condition, he retroactively becomes the owner of the chametz from the time the agreement was originally made. We fear that, perhaps, the gentile will not fulfill his commitment, and thus the Jew will remain the owner of the chametz.

Rav Moshe HaCohen maintains that even the possession of a smaller amount violates these prohibitions. Rav Yosef Caro supports this view in the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>.

Rav Chayim Soloveitchik (<i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 15:1) differentiates between the two cases as follows. Chametz itself is a forbidden substance. Hence, it must be spoiled to the point that a dog cannot benefit from it. In contrast, the other substances are merely mixtures of chametz. They are only forbidden because they contain the taste of chametz. Hence, once that taste is no longer suitable for human consumption, there is no reason why they should remain forbidden.
He continues relating that, as stated in Halachot 11 and 12, chametz that is obviously designated for purposes other than food can be used even though it has not become spoiled.

A priest who served false gods, even if he was compelled to do so - See <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 5:2-4, which states that a person should sacrifice his life rather than submit to pressure to worship false gods.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 15.4,"[Lack of] maturity: What is implied? A young priest should not recite the priestly blessings until he grows a full beard<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned in the commentary on Chapter 8, Halachah 11, the expression ""grows a full beard"" is a primarily measure of age, whether the person actually grows a beard or not.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 128:34), based on <i>Tosafot, Chulin</i> 24b, states:
A minor who has not manifested signs of physical maturity should not recite the priestly blessing alone. However, he may recite the blessing together with his brethren, the priests, to learn and become educated.<br>
If he has manifested signs of physical maturity, he may recite the priestly blessing even while alone. However, he should do so only as a temporary measure, and not as a fixed practice, until he grows a full beard.
Intoxication: - The Hebrew יין literally means wine. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 128:55 notes that the Rambam speaks only about wine and does not mention other alcoholic beverages. Accordingly, he explains that a person who becomes drunk from other alcoholic beverages may recite the priestly blessing, unless he is so drunk that he has no control of himself.
It is significant that in Chapter 4, Halachah 17, when speaking about the prohibition against an intoxicated person praying, the Rambam states: ""A person who is drunk should not pray.... When is a person considered drunk? When he cannot speak before a king."" See also <i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 1:1-2, where the Rambam describes the prohibition against serving in the Temple while intoxicated and mentions, albeit with differences between them, both a person who drank wine and one who became intoxicated from other alcoholic beverages.
The <i>Magen Avraham's</i> decision is not accepted by all authorities. (See <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 128:141.)

Because of the prohibition against reciting the priestly blessing while intoxicated, it is customary on Simchat Torah in Ashkenazic communities to recite the priestly blessing in the morning service and not during <i>Musaf</i>.

He maintains that this choice of language was intended to imply that if a priest washed his hands in the morning, he need not wash them a second time unless they have become ritually impure. He also quotes a responsum of Rav Avraham, the Rambam's son, who explicitly states that a priest may rely on his morning washing.
Nevertheless, in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 128:6), Rav Yosef Karo quotes the opinion of Rashi and <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Sotah</i> 39a), who require the priests to have their hands washed a second time as an additional measure of holiness.

Who should they bless? Their brethren in the north and the south - i.e., those outside the synagogue. Even though they were unable to attend the synagogue, since they were prevented by forces beyond their control, they are included within the blessing.
The Rambam's statements are taken from <i>Sotah</i> 38b and the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 5:4. However, the Rambam's choice of phraseology is more restrictive, mentioning only ""the people in the north and the south,"" while these sources state, ""their brethren in the fields.""
According to his grandson, Rav Yitzchak HaNagid, this restriction was intentional. Since in the Rambam's time the Jews lived mostly to the east or west of Jerusalem, in most synagogues the <i>heichal</i> would be pointed in that direction, and thus, depending on the location of the synagogue, the people standing in one of these directions would be standing behind the priests. Therefore, they would not be included in the blessing.

Thus, the failure to bless the people is considered as nullifying the observance of three commands.
In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (<i>Shoresh</i> 9), the Rambam cites this teaching as a classic example of a fundamental principle regarding the reckoning of the 613 mitzvot. Though the Talmud often states that many mitzvot are involved in the performance or transgression of a particular commandment, this does not mean that the mitzvah should be counted as more than one mitzvah when calculating the 613 mitzvot of the Torah. Rather, the Talmud means to say that the performance of this mitzvah is considered as important as if many mitzvot were involved.

By quoting the verse from Genesis, “and I will bless those who bless you,” Rabbi Akiva emphasizes that the blessings bestowed upon the priests - as well as the blessing conveyed by the priests - stem from God's infinite goodness (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 10).

</i>.<br>[The source for this distinction is Deuteronomy 12:3, which] states: ""And you shall destroy their name from this place<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. The opening verse of the Biblical passage cited states: ""These are the statutes... you must heed... in the land that God... is giving you.""

This raises a question regarding the churches that exist in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> today. Should their existence be tolerated, or are we, as a people and as individuals, obligated to destroy them?

Though taking possession represents a formal transfer of ownership in dealings with a gentile, the transaction was made in error.

Therefore, they must be destroyed (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 53a, 71b). (See also <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 1464.)
Our commentary follows the interpretation of Rav Kapach. It must be noted that many of the classic commentaries on the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> have questioned why the Rambam mentions the concept of a transaction made in error only in the case when the Jew took possession and did not pay, but not when he paid and did not take possession. They have offered several possible resolutions, including a sweeping statement by <i>Avodat HaMelech</i> that our Sages nullified the effectiveness of monetary payment as an effective means of finalizing the transfer of property (<i>kinyan</i>), not only with regard to transactions between two Jews (see <i>Hilchot Mechirah</i> 3:1,4-5), but also with regard to transactions between a Jew and a gentile.
(Interestingly, though the Rambam's phraseology has raised such problems, it is quoted verbatim by the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i> 146:3.)
When stating that a forbidden object must be destroyed, our Sages frequently used the expression:
</i>, he must take [the idols] to the Dead Sea.<br>Similarly, when a gentile and a convert [divide] the estate of their father - a gentile<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In which case, the idols have never come into the convert's possession and, hence, he is not considered to have benefited from their exchange.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The problem in this instance is that it is forbidden to exchange an idol for other property. Hence, before taking possession of the inheritance,
</i> - the convert may tell the gentile, ""Take the idols and I will take the money,"" ""Take the forbidden wine and I will take the produce."" Once [idols] come into the possession of the convert, however<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> they are considered to be idols belonging to a Jew, and
<b>they are forbidden -</b> and must be destroyed.
In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>D'mai</i> 6:10), the Rambam writes that were a similar situation - an inheritance containing property from which one heir would be allowed to benefit from and one would be forbidden - to occur among Jews, the leniencies mentioned above would not be permitted.
The difference between the two cases is that when a Jew inherits property from his father, the transfer of ownership is immediate, and from the moment of his father's death, the forbidden property belongs to the heir, who must take responsibility for it. In contrast, a convert's inheritance of his gentile father's estate is a Rabbinic decree, instituted in consideration of the convert. According to the Torah, once he converts, he has no connection to his natural parents. The Sages extended the leniency they granted in allowing him to acquire the inheritance to include the right to barter these forbidden articles before they actually become his property. (See also <i>Siftei Cohen, Yoreh De'ah</i> 146:5.

In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Avodah Zarah</i>, ibid., based on <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 40-41), the Rambam explains that although Rabbi Meir maintained that all gentile images were forbidden because they would be used for different pagan rites, the Sages disagreed and laid down the following general rules.

This phrase implies that this clause refers to a limb broken from an idol. The authoritative manuscripts state ""should one find a hand... which is the form of a deity.""
In his Commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam states that this clause (found both in the mishnah and in this halachah) does not refer to a limb that is broken from an idol, but rather to an instance where the limb itself is worshiped. The Rambam explains that since the previous clause states that broken limbs of statues are permitted, this clause must be speaking about a different concept.
</i>.<br>In contrast, should one find a hand, a foot, or another limb from the form of one of the constellations or celestial signs, it is forbidden to benefit from it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though the fact that it was abandoned in a scrap heap could be considered as an indication that it was nullified,

Thus, according to the Talmud, the interpretation of these laws is as follows: If one finds an idol that was obviously purposefully broken (Shmuel's law), it is permitted to benefit from it. If, however, the idol was not destroyed with an obvious destructive intent, it is forbidden to benefit from it, as Rabbi Yochanan states.

</i> other cups, the the [entire second mixture] is permitted<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and other commentaries question the Rambam's decision, noting that the text of <i>Zevachim</i>, ibid., appears to indicate that it is necessary for there to be three mixtures. Indeed, in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 16:10, when discussing the prohibitions of a דבר חשוב (a forbidden substance whose importance prevents it from ever being nullified in a mixture), the Rambam himself appears to follow this view, stating:
If one pomegranate from a mixture [containing a forbidden pomegranate] falls together with two other pomegranates... and from these three, one pomegranate falls together with other pomegranates, the latter [mixture] is permitted.
Indeed, on the basis of the statements in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i>, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 140) deviates from the Rambam's opinion and requires three mixtures.
This approach, however, is not followed by all commentaries. Rashi and <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Zevachim</i>, ibid.) explain that even with regard to a דבר חשוב, only two mixtures are necessary. These views are quoted as halachah by the <i>Turei Zahav</i> and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> in their glosses on the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 110:8).
Among the suggestions made by the commentaries to resolve the difference between the Rambam's statements here and those in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> are the following:<br>
a) Most people are careful regarding the prohibition against benefiting from any object connected with idol worship. Therefore, there is no need to reinforce the prohibition. In contrast, the prohibition against benefiting from a דבר חשוב is far less known. Hence, the Rabbis added severe safeguards to make sure that it be observed (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>
b) Here, the Rambam is speaking about a prohibition against benefiting from a forbidden object (איסור הנאה). In contrast, <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> is concerned with partaking of forbidden foods, where the prohibition is more severe (<i>Siftei Cohen</i>, <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 110:52).
Even the authorities who permit the second mixture to be used do not allow a single individual to partake of the entire mixture at one time. In such an instance, there would be only a single doubt whether he used the forbidden object or not.
The Rabbis (<i>Zevachim</i>, 74b) mentioned another example of a mixture which is permitted because of circumstances which create a doubt whether our original suspicion continues to apply:
<b>Should a ring [used to adorn] an idol become mixed together with one hundred other rings, and -</b> they would thus all be forbidden according to the above principles. However, if
<b>then two of them fall -</b> accidentally. If one intentionally throws one into the sea, the leniency does not apply (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i> 110:7).
<b>into the Mediterranean Sea -</b> and are thus lost. If two merely become separated from the group, the others remain prohibited (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, ibid.). (Note the <i>Kessef Mishneh's</i> comments that here, the Dead Sea is intended.)
<b>it is permissible to use all of them. -</b> i.e., all the rings that remain. The prohibition does not continue to apply, because
<b>We presume that the [forbidden] ring was among the two -</b> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that when stating a similar law in <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 15:2, the Rambam required only a single barrel of wine to be lost. The difference between these two laws can be resolved by taking into account the nature of the prohibited substances: Rings are small, and the loss of a single ring does not make a substantial difference to the entire group. In contrast, barrels of wine are large, and the loss of even one will attract attention.
[which fell]. - The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 140) limits this leniency, stating that it is forbidden to use a single ring alone, nor may one person benefit from the entire group of rings at once.
The Rabbis (<i>Zevachim</i>, ibid.) mentioned a third example of a mixture which is permitted because of circumstances which create a doubt whether our original suspicion continues to apply:
<b>Should [a forbidden ring] become mixed together with a hundred others and -</b> they would thus be forbidden according to the above principles. However, if
<b>then [the group] becomes divided, forty -</b> i.e., the minority
<b>being separated in one group, and sixty -</b> i.e., the majority
<b>in another, and then the entire [group of] forty fall into another group of rings, it is permissible to use all of them -</b> the second mixture.
<b>We presume that the forbidden ring remained among the majority. -</b> There is a doubt whether the forbidden ring was among the forty. Even if it had been included within that forty, perhaps the ring one chooses from the second mixture is not the forbidden one.
In this instance, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 140) does not accept the Rambam's view, and forbids the second mixture. Even according to the Rambam, it is not permissible to eat the entire second mixture at one time, for then there would be only a single doubt.
<b>If the -</b> entire
<b>[group of] sixty fall into another group of rings, they are all forbidden. -</b> Should, however, only a portion of the sixty fall into another mixture, the Rambam (but not the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>) would permit their use. In such an instance, their status would parallel that of the second mixture of goblets mentioned above.
</i>.<br>Should a ring [used to adorn] an idol become mixed together with one hundred other rings, and then two of them fall into the Mediterranean Sea, it is permissible to use all of them. We presume that the [forbidden] ring was among the two [which fell].<br>Should [a forbidden ring] become mixed together with a hundred others and then [the group] becomes divided, forty being separated in one group and sixty in another, and then the entire [group of] forty fall into another group of rings, it is permissible to use all of them.

It is, however, permissible to sit under the shade of its branches and its leaves. - This decision has been questioned by other authorities, who wonder why the Rambam distinguished between the tree's trunk and branches. On the surface, the same prohibition should apply to both of them.
The Rambam's decision is based on his interpretation of <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 48b, which is derived from the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 3:8). The Talmud explains that even though the shade of an <i>asherah</i> is forbidden, צל הצל, literally, ""the shade of its shade,"" is permitted. The Jerusalem Talmud interprets 18לצ לצה as shade produced by the parts of the tree which would not touch the trunk if they fell.
[Rashi offers a different interpretation of <i>Avodah Zarah</i>, ibid. His view is accepted by most commentaries. When quoting this law, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 142:9) does not differentiate between the shade produced by the trunk and that of its leaves.
If a person has another route - to reach his desired destination, which is no longer than the one which passes under the <i>asherah</i>. If the alternate route is longer, the person is not required to deviate from the path leading under the <i>asherah</i> (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, ibid.).

Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 7.12,"Chicks which do not need their mother and nest in [an <i>asherah</i>] are permitted. I<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Even though these chicks are permitted, <i>Me'ilah</i> 14a does not allow one to climb up the tree and take them in a normal manner. Rather, one must knock the chicks down with a stave, and then collect them. The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> (and the <i>Turei Zahav, Yoreh De'ah</i> 142:12) explain that climbing on the tree or using it as support for a ladder would involve deriving benefit from the forbidden tree.
The Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Me'ilah</i> 3:9, suggests a different interpretation. There, the Rambam specifically writes that when taking the nest - as stated in the final clause of this halachah - it permissible to climb up the tree in the normal manner. Therefore, it appears that one should knock down the chicks to see if they are capable of flying on their own or not. This explanation also clarifies why the Rambam does not mention in this halachah the need to knock down the chicks. By stating that only those which do not need their mother are permitted, he implies that one must determine whether or not the chicks need their mother (Rav Kapach).
</i>n contrast, the chicks and eggs which need their mother are forbidden for the <i>asherah</i> is considered as if it is a base for them.

The Ra'avad states that one must explicitly know that the birds built their nest from other wood. <i>Avodat HaMelech</i> explains that the Rambam does not require such knowledge, because of the following Talmud principle: When there is a question whether a substance came from the most probable source (רוב) or the closest source (קרוב), we presume it came from the most probable source.

Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 7.13,"It is forbidden to benefit from wood which one takes from it. Should a person have heated the oven with such wood, he must cool it off<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note the contrast between the Rambam's statements here and those in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 16:22, where the Rambam states that if an oven is heated with the shells or peels of fruit which is forbidden (because it is either <i>orlah</i> or <i>kil'ei hakerem</i>), it is sufficient to remove the wood which is burning. The coals and the heat produced by the initial fire, however, are not forbidden and one may bake with them. He does not make such statements here, because, as stated in Halachah 10, even the coals and ashes of an <i>asherah</i> are forbidden.
[Curiously, when mentioning these laws in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (142:4), Rav Yosef Karo quotes the Rambam's statements in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i>, substituting forbidden wood for <i>orlah</i>, without distinguishing between the different prohibitions. Accordingly the commentaries on the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Turei Zahav</i> 145:5, <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 145:10) object to his decision.]

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 3:9), the Rambam explains that the above decision applies whether the oven is new or old.
The Mishnah states that if such wood is used in a new oven, the oven may never be used again. In Talmudic times, the ovens were made of clay and the clay would not harden sufficiently until the oven was kindled once. Thus, since kindling the oven for the first time prepared it to be used on all subsequent occasions, some Rabbis forbade its use when this first kindling was made with a forbidden substance. This opinion is, nevertheless, not accepted as halachah. The Rambam's view is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i>, ibid. (See the explanation of זה וזה גורם in the following halachah.)
Furthermore, this prohibition is extended beyond the oven:
</i>hould he bake bread in [an oven heated in this manner] without cooling it, he is forbidden to benefit from the bread<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> because the beneficial effect of the forbidden wood preceded the influence of the permitted wood.

[This mixture of bread can be differentiated from the mixtures mentioned in Halachah 10. Those mixtures involved objects which were themselves used as accessories for idol worship, while here the loaf itself was never used for such purposes. Hence, the severe laws mentioned there do not apply in this instance.]

He does, however, suggest selling the loaf to a gentile (less the value of the forbidden wood) in a manner in which one could be sure that it would not be resold to a Jew.
</i>. The other loaves, however, are permitted<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> even to be eaten. In other similar situations, one is permitted to benefit from a forbidden mixture (e.g., sell it to a gentile), but partaking of it oneself is prohibited.

Rabban Gamliel was bathing in the bathhouse of Aphrodite (the Greek goddess of beauty) in Akko, and Praclus ben Paluslus asked him: ""Why are you bathing in Aphrodite's bathhouse? Does your Torah not command: 'Let nothing which is condemned cling to your hand'?<br>
He responded: ""One does not reply in a bathhouse."" After he had departed, he told him, ""I did not come into her territory, she came into mine. One does not say, 'This bathhouse is becoming to Aphrodite.' One says, 'Aphrodite is becoming to the bathhouse.' Furthermore, no matter how much money you were offered, you would not enter your idol's temple naked... and urinate before it."" (The mishnah continues, mentioning the interpretation of Deuteronomy 12:2 quoted by the Rambam.)
[Significantly, Rashi (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 44b) interprets the mishnah differently from the Rambam. They explain that rather than the idol being located within the bathhouse, the bathhouse was located within premises belonging to the idol.]
</i>, because it is placed there for aesthetic purposes and not to be served<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is the Rambam's interpretation of Rabban Gamliel's first point. He did not enter a place where the statue was served (Aphrodite's territory). Rather, he entered a bathhouse (his territory) where a statue had been placed as an adornment.
[The Rambam's interpretation is also found in the <i>Tosafot Rid</i> and the <i>Eshkol</i>. Rashi and others interpret Rabban Gamliel's statements differently.]

Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 7.19,"It is permitted to benefit<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> interprets the Rambam's phraseology as implying that although, after the fact, the meat is not forbidden, at the outset (לכתחילה), it is forbidden to slaughter an animal with such a knife. Other authorities, however, do not share this opinion, and maintain that there is no prohibition against using such a knife. (See Ramah, <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 142:2 and the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i>, 10:1, which accept the latter view as halachah.)
</i> from [an animal] slaughtered using a knife [forbidden because of its connection to] idol worship, because one is detracting from [the animal's] value<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> While an animal is alive, it can be used for work and for breeding, and is therefore of greater value.
</i>. If the animal is in danger [of dying], it is forbidden, because one is enhancing its value<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> If the animal dies naturally, a Jew will not be permitted to eat its meat. Thus, the animal's slaughter enhances its value.
</i>, and this improvement involves benefit from an accessory of idol worship<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Hence, it is forbidden, as stated in Halachah 2. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that, based on Halachot 12 and 13, it would appear that the Rambam maintains that all the meat from the animal is forbidden, and there is no way one may benefit from it. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> does not accept that view, and argues that it is sufficient to destroy an amount of meat equivalent to the value of the knife.
Similarly, it is forbidden to cut meat - i.e., cut large pieces of meat into smaller ones
</i>.<br>Similarly, it is forbidden to cut meat with [such a knife], because one is enhancing its value<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> making it fit to be sold or cooked. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 142:6) relates that if one cut pieces of meat with such a knife, even the Rambam would not forbid use of the meat entirely. It would be necessary, however, to destroy an amount of meat equivalent to the value of the knife.

There are three types of blessings: blessings associated with [deriving] satisfaction, blessings associated with mitzvot, and blessings of thanksgiving which are a process of praise, thanksgiving, and request so that we will continually remember the Creator and fear Him.
In <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 10:1, the Rambam writes that the blessings associated with the prayer service are included in the category of blessings of thanksgiving. This position is not accepted by all authorities. For example, the <i>Avudraham</i> considers the blessings associated with the prayer service as a separate category of blessings.

This text is found in the Siddur of Rav Amram Gaon. The Vilna Gaon, in his emendations to the Talmud, suggests that these requests were not originally included in the Talmud and were added later by Rav Amram Gaon.

As we go to sleep at night in a dark world, we express our thanks for the Divine light that constantly fills the world.
The recitation of a blessing for sleep is based on our Sages' conception of sleep as one of God's greatest gifts because it allows man to rest and awake refreshed, able to serve his Creator with renewed energy and vigor. In <i>Bereishit Rabbah</i> 9:8, Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar interprets the words uttered by God at the end of the sixth day of creation, ""and behold it was very good"" (Genesis 1:30 , as referring to the creation of sleep.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.2,"[Then,]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 60b states that one first recites <i>Kri'at Shema</i> and then, the blessing of <i>hamapil</i> (the blessing discussed in Halachah 1). This opinion is quoted by the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 239:1). However, this order is only followed in Nusach Ari. Both Nusach Ashkenaz and Nusach Sephard follow the order stated by the Rambam.
The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 1:1) relates that Rav Zeira was accustomed to recite the <i>Shema</i> over and over until he fell asleep. This indicates that the <i>Shema</i> is the last thing said at night before sleeping (<i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> in the name of Rabbenu Nissim Gaon).
</i> one reads the first section<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is consistent with our text of <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) which states that, before going to sleep, one recites ""from <i>Shema</i> until <i>V'haya im shamoa</i>."" This is the opinion followed in most communities at present.
Rabbenu Chananel rules that one recites the first two sections of <i>Shema</i> since both contain the phrases ""with all your heart"" and ""while laying down"" (See the commentary below). Rabbenu Asher also follows this position.
The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (239:1) quotes the <i>Ari</i>, Rabbi Yitzchok Luria, as requiring the recitation of all three sections of the <i>Shema</i> so that the 248 words it contains will guard the 248 limbs of the body during sleep. According to the opinion of Rashi mentioned below, it is also necessary to read all three sections.

[T<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This line does not appear in either the Oxford or Yemenite manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. See <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 3:<i>ibid.</i> which permits the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> while touching one's wife because one is familiar with her.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 4b explains that ""it is a mitzvah"" to recite the <i>Shema</i> before retiring. These statements are based on Psalms 4:5: ""Tremble, but do not sin. Speak in your heart upon your bed and be still."" Our Sages interpreted ""Speak in your heart"" and ""upon your bed"" as allusions to the phrases ""with all your heart"" and ""upon your bed"" in the<i>Shema</i>.
That Talmudic passage implies that the reason for reciting the <i>Shema</i> before retiring is to protect oneself from undesirable influences during the night. According to Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 2a) and others who allow the evening service to be recited before sunset, the recitation of <i>Shema</i> before retiring enables us to fulfill the mitzvah of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night. According to the writings of the Ari, the reciting of the <i>Shema</i> before retiring is a service of spiritual preparation for the soul's ascent from the body during sleep.
Since <i>Berachot</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) mentions that ""it is a mitzvah"" to recite the <i>Shema</i> before retiring, it was customary in certain communities to recite a blessing before reciting the <i>Shema</i> as is customary before performing other mitzvot. In his responsa (<i>Pe'air HaDor</i> 100), the Rambam specifically rules against reciting such a blessing. [However, note the <i>Kolbo</i> (29) who quotes the Rambam as stating in a responsa that such a blessing is required.]

Abbaye says: ""Even a Torah scholar must recite at least one verse describing God's mercy, for example: 'Into Your hand I entrust my spirit, You will redeem me, God, God of truth' (Psalms 31:6 .
<i>Sh'vuot</i> 16b mentions that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi would recite Psalm 91 as protection against unfavorable influences at night. Other verses that have a similar intent have been included by Kabbalistic authorities in the text of the <i>Shema</i> recited before retiring.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.3,"When a person awakes after concluding his sleep<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> I.e., in the morning when he has completed his night's sleep.
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> points out that although <i>Berachot</i> 60b states that one recites this blessing upon arising, the Rambam specifies that it be said only after concluding one's sleep. This makes it clear that a person who wakes up in the middle of the night and intends to return to sleep, need not recite this blessing.
</i>, while still in bed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rabbenu Yonah (in his commentary to the <i>Halachot</i> of Rav Yitzchok Alfasi) takes issue with this statement. He writes:
This is difficult to understand. Since [upon waking] one's hands are not clean, how is it possible that [the Rambam] says that one should recite these blessings [while still in bed]. The Talmud mentions this [practice. However, this is because the Sages] were particularly holy. They would wash their hands [at night before sleep] and would be able to maintain a state [of purity] such that they could recite the blessings in the morning in cleanliness. We, however, are unable to maintain this state of cleanliness. Therefore, it is proper that we recite them only after נטילת ידים (the washing of the hands).
This position is widely accepted and is the basis of our practice today. See the commentary to Halachah 9.
</i>, he says:
My Lord, t<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Each morning, we renew our thanks for the soul which God has returned to us, refreshed and revitalized.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:1, the Rambam writes:
All of the blessings begin with <i>Baruch</i> and conclude with <i>Baruch</i> except the final blessing of the blessings associated with the <i>Shema</i>, a blessing which follows directly after another blessing, and a blessing over fruit, those [blessings] which resemble it, or a blessing for mitzvot.
Given this statement, the commentaries wonder why this blessing does not begin with <i>Baruch</i>. Furthermore, in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 1:5, the Rambam writes that, unless a blessing follows another blessing, it must mention God's sovereignty over the world and no such mention is made in this blessing.
The <i>Meiri</i> in his commentary to <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) offers the following resolution to these difficulties: Despite the fact that the entire period of a person's sleep divides between the recitation of <i>hamapil</i> and <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i>, the sleep is not considered as an interruption and <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i> is considered as following directly after <i>hamapil</i>. Accordingly, it is not required to begin with <i>Baruch</i> or mention God's sovereignty.
Other commentaries who follow different halachic perspectives than the Rambam offer these resolutions:<br>
1) <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i> is a blessing of praise and prayer and does not require an opening phrase of blessing, in the same way that the blessing recited before travelling does not (<i>Tosafot, Pesachim</i> 104b).<br>
2) <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i> is generally recited immediately after the blessing of אשר יצר and therefore can be considered as a blessing which follows another blessing.
</i>he soul that You have placed within me is pure<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Despite his lowly physical state, man possesses an innate spirituality, a pure Godly soul, which is the source of all his positive actions and thoughts.
</i>. You have created it, You have formed it, You have breathed it into me<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The three verbs used in this blessing correspond to three different descriptions of the creation of man in the Torah:<br>
1) ויברא א-להים את האדם - ""And the Lord created man"" (Genesis 1:27 .<br>
2) א-להים את האדם וייצר ה' - ""And God, the Lord, formed man"" (Genesis 2:7 .<br>
3) ויפח באפיו נשמת חיים - ""And He blew into his nostrils the soul of life"" (<i>ibid.</i>).
These three verbs also relate to the three components of the soul, נפש, רוח, ונשמה (<i>Maharsha, 14Berachot</i> 60b).
In Kabbalah, the three verbs are understood as referring to the three worlds: עולם הבריאה - the world of creation, עולם היצירה - the world of form, and עולם העשיה - the world of physical action. The word טהרה - ""pure"" refers to עולם האצילות - the world of emanation, the highest of the four worlds. Thus, this prayer traces the descent of man's soul from God's Throne of Glory into the physical world.
</i> and You preserve it within me<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Although the natural inclination of the soul is to return to its Source, God preserves its presence within the body in order that the person may serve His Creator in this world (<i>Midrash Tehillim</i> 62).

</i> within me, I am thankful before You, O God, my Lord, Master of all works<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Some siddurim add the phrase, ""Lord of all souls,"" at this point so that the concluding phrase of the body of the blessing will correspond to the wording of the blessing itself.
</i>. Blessed are You, God, who restores souls to dead bodies<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 57b compares sleep to 1/60 of death. Therefore, waking can be compared to the resurrection of the dead (Rabbi Ya'akov Emden in his commentary on the siddur).

Therefore, one should not recite ""Amen"" after hearing a colleague recite the opening sentence of the blessing (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 46:1). <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 46a) states that one should say ""and may it be..."" to emphasize that the prayer is a single blessing.
<b>my Lord and Lord of my fathers, that You accustom me -</b> The Rambam, and similarly the <i>Tur</i>, use the first person singular, thus, making the prayer an individual statement. However, most siddurim use the first person plural, ""us.""

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There are slight, but significant, differences between the text of the blessing here and its source in <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>).
</i> Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who gives the rooster understanding to distinguish between day and night<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since the crowing of the rooster generally heralds the dawn, the Sages established this blessing in response to it.
The word שכוי is translated as ""rooster"" based on <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 26a which refers to Job 38:36: ""Who has put wisdom in the inward parts and [given] understanding to the rooster (שכוי).""
Rabbenu Asher (in his halachic commentary to <i>Berachot</i>) interprets שכוי as ""heart."" The heart is the source of understanding which allows man to distinguish between day and night.

On a deeper level, it also expresses our cognizance of the sanctity of physical modesty.
</i>.<br>When he puts his cloth on his head<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This blessing is also mentioned in <i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i> The Rambam interprets it as referring to an ordinary head covering. In contrast, Rabbenu Yitzchok Alfasi interprets the Talmud's statement as referring to donning the <i>tallit</i>.
<i>Tosafot</i> and other Ashkenazic authorities maintain that this blessing should be reciting upon putting on a hat, yarmulke, or other headcovering.
</i>, he recites: Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who crowns Israel in glory<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 46) associates this blessing with the prohibition of walking four cubits with one's head uncovered (<i>Shabbat</i> 118b; See <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> 5:6). Covering our heads symbolizes Israel's fear and awe before God's presence. This is their glory, as Isaiah 62:3 states: ""You shall be a crown of glory in the hand of God.""
</i>.<br>When he passes his hands over his eyes<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In order to cause sleep to pass from their eyes, people often rub them vigorously.
Our text of <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states when ""one opens his eyes."" Many authorities favor this version over the text quoted by the Rambam (and Rav Yitzchok Alfasi) because <i>Shabbat</i> 108b warns of the dire consequences of touching one's eyes before washing one's hands in the morning. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 46:2) suggests that people might have avoided the problem by cleaning their eyes with a cloth or rubbing their eyes with closed eyelids (<i>Sha'arei Teshuvah</i>).
</i>, he recites: [Blessed...] who opens the eyes of the blind<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This blessing is based on Psalms 146:18 and can be interpreted as a statement of gratitude for more than our physical eyesight. We thank God for the ability to see His greatness in creation. These are our metaphorical ""eyes of reason.""
</i>.<br>When he sits up in his bed, he recites: [Blessed...] who unties those bound<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> thanking God for the ability to move our limbs after sleep.
</i>.<br>When he lowers his feet from the bed and rests them on the ground, he recites: [Blessed...] who spreads the earth over the waters<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This blessing is based on Psalms 136:6: ""[Give thanks] to the One who spread the earth over the waters, for His lovingkindness is eternal.""
</i>.<br>When he stands up, he recites: [Blessed...] who straightens the bowed<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is based on Psalms 146:8. This blessing expresses gratitude for the uniquely human characteristic of upright posture. It may also be interpreted as giving thanks to God, the source of salvation for those bowed and downtrodden.
The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 46) states that if one recites this blessing before the blessing ""who unties those bound,"" he should refrain from reciting the latter blessing. Though there is some difference of opinion about the matter, most later authorities accept the <i>Tur's</i> decision.
</i>.<br>When he washes his hands<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 6:2, the Rambam specifically states that one should recite this blessing before washing one's hands so that the blessing will precede the performance of the mitzvah (<i>Pesachim</i> 7a). Rabbenu Yonah states that one should not recite this blessing until after washing one's hands because until one has washed his hands, he is not in a fit state to mention God's name (See <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 4:2). (According to others, the recitation of this blessing should be delayed until after drying one's hands.)
The Rambam obviously does not accept this rationale since he requires many blessings to be recited before the washing of the hands as above.
</i>, he recites: [Blessed...] who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Although this washing was instituted by the Rabbis, this wording is appropriate, as is explained in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>).
</i> regarding the washing of hands<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This washing is required in preparation for the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> and the morning service.
Based on the <i>Zohar</i> (Vol. I, 169b, 184b), the Rabbis rule that, on washing in the morning, one pours water over his hands three times alternately, i.e., once over the right hand, once over the left hand, once more over the right, etc. This is done in order to remove the spirit of impurity that remains after sleep.
</i>.<br>When he washes his face<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note Chapter 4, Halachah 2, which states that a person must wash his face in the morning as a preparation for prayer.

May it be Your will, God, my Lord and Lord of my fathers, that You accustom me to the performance of [Your] commandments and do not accustom me to sins or transgressions. Cause the positive inclination to rule over me and not the evil inclination. Strengthen me in Your commandments and grant my portion in Your Torah. Allow me to find favor, lovingkindness, and mercy in Your eyes and the eyes of all who see me and bestow upon me benevolent kindnesses. Blessed are You, God, who bestows benevolent kindnesses."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.5,"Whenever one enters the toilet<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This halachah is dealt with among the morning blessings, since a person generally relieves himself shortly after arising. Nevertheless, its instructions apply whenever one relieves himself.
[Note, however, the opinion quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 6:1, which maintains that the blessing, אשר יצר, can be considered as one of the morning blessings and should be recited even if one does not relieve oneself.]

The <i>Midrash Tanchuma</i> (<i>Shemini</i>) relates:

The <i>Darchei Moshe</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 6) explains that the wonders spoken of in this blessing refers to the maintenance of our spiritual soulsáwithin ouráphysical bodies. This may explain the accepted order of the blessings in which א-להי נשמה (Halachah 3) is recited immediately after this blessing, אשר יצר.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.6,"When one fastens his belt<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam accepts the interpretation most commentaries have given to the words מייניה אסר in <i>Berachot</i> 60b, the source for this blessing. The Ra'avad interprets the Talmud as referring to putting on one's trousers.
</i>, he recites: [Blessed...universe,] who girds Israel w<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Avodat Yitzchok</i> explains that a belt or girdle protects a person's body and affords him greater strength. Rav Asher of Lunil explains that this blessing refers to the spiritual strength granted to Israel through Torah study.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Taz</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 46) points out that, of the morning blessings, only this and the blessing uttered after covering one's head (עוטר ישראל בתפארה) mention Israel. The other blessings praise God for kindnesses enjoyed by all people. In contrast, these two blessings highlight actions performed by the Jewish people as an expression of modesty. The belt is intended to separate the heart from the lower half of the body (See <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 2:7 and 3:17). The covering of one's head signifies one's awareness of the Divine Presence, as stated above (See Halachah 4).
The <i>Avudraham</i> notes that this blessing is conceptually rooted in Jeremiah 12:11: ""'As a girdle clings to a man's loins so have I caused the whole of the House of Israel and the House of Judah to cleave unto Me,' says God; 'that they might be unto Me, a people, a name, a praise and a glory.'”

The same text is also quoted by Rav Yitzchok Alfasi and Rabbenu Asher.
However, our text of <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the source for this blessing, reads: שעשה לי כל צרכי - ""who provides me with all my needs<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Several different explanations are given for the association of this blessing with the putting on of one's shoes. The <i>Avudraham</i> states simply that a person is unable to move about freely without shoes. Therefore, putting on shoes enables him to acquire whatever he needs.
Rav Shlomo Kluger cites our Sages' statement, ""A person should sell everything he owns and buy shoes,"" as evidence that a person who has shoes to wear has acquired that which is most necessary.
The <i>Sh'loh</i> quotes the Maharshal as explaining the source for this blessing as Psalms 8:6-9.
You have made him [man] a little lower than angels.... You have given him dominion over the works of Your hands. You have put everything under his feet, all sheep and oxen, and also the beasts of the field, the birds of the sky and the fish of the seas.
Wearing leather shoes demonstrates the way in which the animal kingdom has been placed ""under man's feet"" and makes us aware that the dominion we have been granted over all creation allows us to acquire ""all our needs.""
</i>""; referring to God in the third person rather than in the second person. This version is found in most siddurim today. It is also found in the authoritative Oxford manuscript of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> and many Yemenite manuscripts.
</i>ith all my needs.<br>When he walks to depart on his way, he recites:<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Our text of <i>Berachot</i> 60b and similarly, most contemporary siddurim, place this blessing before the previous one. Nevertheless, Rav Yitzchok Alfasi and Rabbenu Asher follow the same order as the Rambam.
</i> [Blessed... universe,] who prepares the steps of man.<br>[A<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Based on <i>Menachot</i> 43b, the following three blessings are recited daily as an expression of thanks for the renewal of our being. Some authorities require a person to have seen a gentile, woman, or slave before reciting the appropriate blessing. However, the Rambam maintains that the blessing should be recited each morning unconditionally (The Responsa of Rav Avraham, the Rambam's son).
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This blessing is based on Psalms 37:23: ""The steps of man are ordered by God"" and Proverbs 20:24: ""The steps of man are from God,"" both of which imply that in addition to giving man the ability to walk, God also guides the direction of his steps.
</i>lso,] every day, a person should recite:<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has not made me a non-Jew<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> We thank God for creating us with the opportunity to relate to Him through the Torah and mitzvot which were given only to the Jews.
<i>Menachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) uses a positive statement for the formula of this blessing: ""Blessed... who has made me a Jew."" Rabbenu Asher quotes this text. The Rambam's version is found in the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 9:2. Rabbenu Yitzchok Alfasi also follows the Jerusalem Talmud.
The <i>Levush, Orach Chayim</i> 46, explains the reason for reciting the blessing in the negative: <i>Eruvin</i> 13a states that it would have been better for man not to have been created than to have been created (i.e., man's soul was in a higher state before its descent into the world than it is while in this world). Therefore, we do not express thanks for being created. Nevertheless, having been created, we thank God for not creating us as gentiles since gentiles have a far lesser number of commandments to fulfill.
The <i>Bayit Chadash</i> explains that the negative formula was chosen for the following reason. Our Sages required that we recite three blessings each morning. Torah law states that whenever a single blessing covers two different circumstances, the second blessing may not be recited. Therefore, since a statement thanking God ""for making me a Jew"" would make the blessing for ""not making me a servant"" superfluous, it is preferable to recite this blessing using the negative formula.
</i>.<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has not made me a woman<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> A woman is not obligated to fulfill all the positive mitzvot whose performance is limited to a specific time. As a result, a man has many more mitzvot to fulfill and recites this blessing thanking God for that privilege.
The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 46) mentions that a woman should recite a blessing thanking God ""for making me according to His will.""
</i>.<br>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has not made me a servant<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., a Canaanite servant who is not a full member of the Jewish people (see <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 13:11). Like women, a Canaanite servant is exempt from all the positive mitzvot whose performance is limited to a specific time.
The published text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> and <i>Menachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) list these blessings in this order. However, the authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, Rav Yitzchok Alfasi, and most siddurim today reverse the sequence of the last two blessings. This order reflects an ascending hierarchy, with women who are endowed with the holiness of the Jewish people, placed after servants.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.7,"These eighteen blessings<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Only seventeen blessings are recited in the morning. The eighteenth blessing is <i>hamapil</i>, the blessing recited before retiring at night. Nevertheless, as explained in the commentary to Halachah 3, the Rambam views it as connected to the morning blessings.
The eighteen blessings correspond to the eighteen blessings of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, and also to the number of times God's name is mentioned in Psalms 29, in the song sung by the Jewish People after the splitting of the Red Sea (Exodus 15:1-19), and in the three sections of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. (See also our commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 4.)

Rather, one recites each of them in response to the condition for which the blessing was instituted, at the appropriate time<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's statements in this and the following two halachot are all based on the idea that these blessings are ברכות הודאה - ""blessings of thanks."" Therefore, a person who does not receive the benefit associated with a particular blessing does not recite the blessing thanking God for that particular condition.
Rav Natrunai Gaon and Rav Amram Gaon differ with the Rambam. They consider these blessings to be ברכות שבח - ""blessings of praise"" for the goodness which God has granted the world as a whole and not thanks for benefit which one has derived as an individual. This opinion is accepted by the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 46) and other Ashkenazic halachic authorities. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> and the Sephardic authorities accept the Rambam's view with certain reservations.
</i>.<br>What is implied?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As the Rambam explained, each blessing is recited in response to a particular action generally carried out each morning. Therefore, should these actions be performed in a different order, the sequence of the blessings is changed correspondingly.
</i> One who fastens his belt while still in his bed recites [the blessing] ""who girds Israel with strength<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Although in Halachah 6, the Rambam stated that this blessing should be recited after one has gotten off his bed, if one fastens his belt while still in bed, he recites the appropriate blessing at that time.
</i>."" One who hears the voice of the rooster recites [the blessing] ""who gives understanding to the rooster<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This halachah is restated here as a prelude to the law that follows, i.e., that one not obligated in a blessing should not recite it. According to the Rambam, one who did not hear a rooster in the morning does not recite the blessing of הנותן לשכוי בינה.
</i>.""<br>Any blessing in which one is not obligated<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> because one has not personally derived the benefit associated with the mitzvah
</i> should not be recited<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned above, this is one of the differences between the Rambam's conception of the morning blessings and that of the other Geonim, who maintain that the blessings should be recited regardless. In consideration of the Rambam's position, the <i>Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chayim</i> 46:8<i>)</i> suggests reciting the blessings without mentioning God's name. The Ramah maintains that one should follow the other opinion.
Even among those who accept the Rambam's conception of these blessings, some authorities would disagree regarding this particular blessing. With this blessing, we are not thanking God for hearing the rooster's crow itself, but for the benefit which we receive from the daylight which the rooster discerns. (See <i>Tosafot</i> and Rabbenu Asher, <i>Berachot</i> 60b.)

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.8,"What is implied?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This halachah exemplifies the final principle mentioned in the previous halachah, that a person should not recite a blessing if he does not derive the benefit associated with it.

On Yom Kippur and the ninth of Av, when one does not wash, - Washing is one of the five afflictions forbidden on these two days. See <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i> 1:5 and 3:1-6 and <i>Hilchot Ta'aniot</i> 5:10.
</i>.""<br>On Yom Kippur and the ninth of Av, when one does not wash, one does not recite the blessing <i>al netilat yadayim</i>, n<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> which is associated with washing one's face. Since washing in this manner is prohibited on these days, one does not recite this blessing.
This ruling is also questioned by other halachic authorities. The Ra'avad states that since it is permissible to clean one's face if it is dirty, one may clean the dirt that collects in one's eyes overnight and recite the blessing associated with this washing.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 613:4 rules that one who is particularly fastidious may wash his face with water on the morning of Yom Kippur. The Ramah adds that the custom is to be very strict in this regard and not even to wash the eyes. The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (basing himself on the <i>Bayit Chadash</i>) permits one to moisten his fingertips and clean the dirt from his eyes. All of these laws regarding Yom Kippur also apply to the ninth of Av.
One who does not relieve himself - in the morning.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor 3:2, the Rambam qualifies the prohibition against washing by stating: ""One [who is] soiled from excrement or dirt may wash the dirty area in the normal fashion without worry."" He also allows a woman to wash her hands in order to feed her child.
The source for the Rambam's statements, <i>Yoma</i> 77b, explains that the reason for this leniency is the presence of <i>shivta</i> on her hands. Rashi interprets this as רוח רעה, the spirit of impurity which rests on our hands before the morning washing.
<i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Yoma</i>, <i>ibid.</i>) rules that one does wash his hands upon rising in the morning on Yom Kippur since רוח רעה is considered like any filth and may be removed in its normal fashion. As apparent from the previous halachot, the Rambam does not consider רוח רעה as a significant factor and forbids such washing. (See <i>Lechem Mishneh, Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i>.)
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 613:2) accepts <i>Tosafot's</i> opinion and states:
One washes his hands in the morning [on Yom Kippur] and recites על נטילת ידים. One should be careful to wash only the ends of the joints of his fingers.
The Ramah adds: ""And he should not intend to enjoy the washing, and do so [only] to remove the רוח רעה from his hands.""
</i>or the blessing ""who removes the bonds of sleep....""<br>One who does not relieve himself does not recite the blessing, ""who created man in wisdom<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as part of the morning blessings.
</i>...."" The same applies regarding the remainder of the blessings<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though Ashkenazic authorities do not accept the Rambam's ruling as explained above, we do find a law which parallels the Rambam's stance here. Even according to the Ashkenazic authorities, one should not recite the blessing ""who has provided me with all my needs"" on Yom Kippur or Tish'ah B'Av, since it is forbidden for everyone to wear shoes on these days.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.9,"It is the custom of the people in the majority of our cities to recite these blessings one after another in the synagogue, whether or not they are obligated in them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This practice has its source in the opinions of the other Geonim mentioned above. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 46) explains the custom:
Since one's hand are not clean [upon rising], the [rabbis] instituted the practice of reciting the [blessings] in order in the synagogue. [Another reason for the institution of this practice is that] many of the common people do not know how to recite the [blessings] and when they are recited in the synagogue, they can answer ""Amen"" afterwards, and thus, fulfill their obligation.
This is a mistake and it is not proper to follow this practice. One should not recite a blessing unless he is obligated to. - The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam sees two difficulties in this practice:<br>
a) The blessings are not recited at their proper time, i.e., immediately after the action to which they are a response;<br>
b) In the synagogue, all the blessings are recited and it is improper to recite a blessing that one is not obligated to recite.
In answer to the first objection, Rabbenu Asher and Rabbenu Yonah explain that there is no problem with reciting these blessings after the actions to which they relate have been completed. The only blessings that must be recited in direct conjunction with the deed with which they are associated are those recited before fulfilling commandments. However, blessings of thanks or praise may be uttered later. This opinion is accepted by all Ashkenazic authorities.
Today, many people recite these blessings at home after washing and dressing. In certain communities, they are recited communally in the synagogue. In all cases, however, each individual who is able to read the blessings from a siddur or knows them by heart should recite the blessings himself every morning.
</i>.<br>This is a mistake and it is not proper to follow this practice. One should not recite a blessing unless he is obligated to."
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.10,"One who rises to study Torah, whether the Written or Oral Law<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There is debate in the Talmud about this matter. Some Sages did not require the recitation of a blessing for the study of certain portions of the Oral Law (See <i>Berachot</i> 11b). Nevertheless, the decision quoted by the Rambam is accepted by all halachic authorities. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 47:2 explains the reason for this decision, ""They [all portions of the Oral Law] are all Torah and were given to Moses at Mount Sinai.""
</i>, before he recites the <i>Shema</i>, s<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 11b states:
Once one has recited the <i>Shema</i>, he need not recite a blessing [for Torah study] since he has fulfilled his obligation with <i>Ahavah Rabbah</i> (the second blessing before the <i>Shema</i>).
This blessing praises God for teaching our ancestors ""the laws that bring eternal life"" and includes our prayers that He ""grant our hearts understanding... to learn and to teach... all the teachings of Your Torah."" Therefore, <i>Ahavah Rabbah</i> is considered as comparableáto the blessings recited before Torah study (Rashi, <i>Berachot</i>, <i>ibid.</i>).
Rabbenu Asher quotes an opinion in the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 5:1) which states that the blessing of <i>Ahavah Rabbah</i> can replace the blessings before the study of the Torah only when one studies immediately after reciting the <i>Shema</i> and <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. The Ra'avad and the Rashba, however, maintain that the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> is also considered as Torah study. Therefore, if one recites the <i>Shema</i> after <i>Ahavah Rabbah</i>, one is considered to have fulfilled his obligation.
The Rambam appears to follow the latter opinion, however, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47:8) accepts Rabbenu Asher's view.
should wash his hands beforehand, - to fulfill the obligation of נטילת ידים upon rising in the morning.
</i>hould wash his hands beforehand, recite [the following] three blessings, and then study<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Both here and in Halachah 11, the Rambam states that one must study immediately after reciting these blessings. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47) explains the motivating principle: All blessings recited before the performance of a commandment must be followed immediately by the fulfillment of the commandment.
This position is, however, not universally accepted. <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 11b), Rabbenu Yonah, and the Mordechai disagree and do not require the repetition of the blessings even if an interruption was made between their recitation and Torah study. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>,:9) warns against making such an interruption.
[The comparison of the blessings before Torah study to the blessings of the mitzvot is not universally accepted. In addition to the opinion of the Ramban mentioned in the following halachah, the <i>Levush</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47) compares the blessings before Torah study to the blessings recited before partaking of food. Just as one thanks God for the satisfaction granted from food and other physical things, one blesses Him for the satisfaction derived from Torah study. See also <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 47:1, <i>Likkutei Sichot</i> Vol. 14.]
</i>.<br>[These blessings] are:
[Blessed... universe,] who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us concerning the words of Torah.<br>
A<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The presence here of the Hebrew letter <i>vav</i> (ו) which is generally translated as ""and"" is the subject of much discussion among the Rabbis.
<i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 46a) explains that, according to <i>Rabbenu Tam</i>, any blessing that follows another blessing of only a single line must itself begin ""Blessed are You..."" and cannot be included in the phrase ""Blessed are You..."" in the first blessing. Therefore, since this paragraph does not begin ""Blessed are You...,"" it appears to be a continuation of the first blessing and not a blessing of its own. The <i>vav</i> - ""and"" - indicates the connection between the two paragraphs.
The Rambam, however, clearly states that the second paragraph is considered as a blessing in its own right and not a continuation of the first blessing. The <i>vav</i> would, therefore, appear to be superfluous. Though most printed texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> include a <i>vav</i>, the authoritative Oxford manuscript of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Yemenite manuscripts, and the Ramah's text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> all lack a <i>vav</i>. (Note <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 47:5, which explains that even according to the opinion that the second paragraph is a separate blessing, adding the <i>vav</i> is in place.)
The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 47:6 rules that the <i>vav</i> should be recited. The Ramah adds that although the custom is not to say it, it should be said. Most siddurim of <i>Nusach Ashkenaz</i> and <i>Sefard</i> include the <i>vav</i>.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There are two different versions of this blessing:<br>
a) one which has its source in the published text of the Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 11b, and concludes: לעסוק בדברי תורה - ""to occupy [ourselves] in the words of Torah.""<br>
b) the version quoted by the Rambam: על דברי תורה - ""concerning the words of Torah."" This version is also found in the siddur of Rav Amram Gaon and the <i>Halachot</i> of Rav Yitzchok Alfasi.
The siddurim of the Sephardim, Yemenites and Nusach Ari follow the Rambam's text, whereas Nusach Ashkenaz reads לעסוק בדברי תורה.<br>
[
In both versions, this blessing contains thirteen words corresponding to the thirteen principles of Biblical exegesis that apply to the Torah (יºג מדות שהתורה נדרשת בהן, <i>Shulchan Tahor</i>).]

However, this version is not included in many siddurim.
</i>, and the offspring of Your people, be knowers of Your name and among those who occupy themselves with Your Torah. Blessed are You, God, who teaches Torah to His people, Israel<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This version is found in the published texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> and the published texts of <i>Berachot</i> 11b, the source for this blessing. However, in his responsa, the Rambam suggests a different conclusion for this blessing: ""Blessed are You, God, the Giver of the Torah."" He explains the reasons why he favors the latter version:
This [wording] alludes to our recognition that God gave us the Torah so that we will learn to do everything it states. [The blessing is a request] that He open our hearts to the study of Torah, for this was the reason it was given to us as a heritage.<br>
However, to conclude [the blessing with] ""who teaches Torah..."" is incorrect, for God... does not teach us the Torah. Though in His love for us, He separated us from the gentiles and gave us the Torah of truth, the actual performance of the mitzvah is left to us and doing His will is in our hands.
</i>.<br>
Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has chosen us from among all the nations and given us His Torah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The designation of Israel as God's chosen people is associated with His giving them the Torah on Mount Sinai (<i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 47).
</i>. Blessed are You, God, who gives the Torah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) refers to this as ""the most exalted of these blessings"" because it contains thanks to God and praise of Israel and the Torah (Rashi).
Rabbenu Yonah points out that although this blessing follows directly after another blessing, it departs from the normal pattern of such blessings and begins ""Blessed are You...."" He explains that this is because this blessing is also often recited in isolation, before the reading of the Torah in the synagogue.
The recitation of the blessings of the Torah is very important. <i>Bava Metzia</i> 85a states that Eretz Yisrael was destroyed because the Jews forsook the Torah. Our Sages clarified that statement, explaining that it means that the people would study Torah without reciting the blessings before it. A person who studies Torah without reciting the blessings fails to realize its holiness and sanctity, therefore, it is considered as if he """"forsook the Torah.''

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.11,"One is obligated to recite these three blessings<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The nature of this obligation is debated among the commentaries. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47) and others understand the Rambam as considering these blessings similar to any other blessing recited before the performance of a mitzvah and hence, of Rabbinic origin.
Nevertheless, <i>Berachot</i> 21a and <i>Yoma</i> 37a state that the obligation to recite a blessing on Torah study stems from the Torah itself. In keeping with this view, the Ramban (<i>Hosafot</i> to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, positive commandment 15) reckons the recitation of the blessings of the Torah as a separate mitzvah.
</i> every day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Perhaps with the words ""every day,"" the Rambam is implying that these blessings should be recited even if one does not sleep at night. See <i>Magen Avraham</i> 47:11.
The blessings are recited only once a day. In contrast to the blessings recited over other mitzvot, even if one interrupts his study and occupies himself with other matters, one need not recite a second blessing. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 4:7 gives two reasons for this difference:<br>
1) The blessings before the Torah resemble the other morning blessings. A person enjoys the benefits associated with the morning blessings intermittently throughout the day, yet he only recites the blessings once in the morning. Similarly, though one may study at several different occasions in a single day, the blessings are recited only once daily.<br>
2) The obligation to study Torah is incumbent upon one throughout the entire day and, at all times, one's attention should be on one's studies.
</i>. Afterwards, one should read a few words of Torah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> If these blessings are comparable to other blessings recited before the performance of mitzvot, the mitzvah (studying Torah) must also be fulfilled immediately after the recitation of the blessing (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).
</i>. [To fulfill this obligation,] the people adopted the custom of reading the Priestly Blessing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Priestly Blessing is found in Numbers 6:22-27. <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 11b) also mentions the custom of reciting the Priestly Blessing each morning and Rav Amram Gaon includes the Priestly Blessing in his siddur.
The <i>Avudraham</i> mentions that the recitation of these verses arouses Divine blessing for the Jewish people. The <i>Even Yarchi</i> notes that the verses of the Priestly Blessing contain 60 letters, corresponding to the 60 tractates in the Talmud.
</i>. In certain places, they recite [the passage, (Numbers 28: 1-9)]: ""Command the children of Israel...,"" a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In the Order of the Prayers for the Entire Year found at the conclusion of <i>Sefer Ahavah</i>, the Rambam includes both these passages, with the verses describing the sacrifices preceding the Priestly Blessings.
The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47:9) both understand the Priestly Blessing to be a fulfillment of the requirement to study Torah after the blessings. The verses of the Daily Sacrifice are recited later, with the intention that our recitation of these verses will compensate for our inability to actually offer these sacrifices (<i>Ta'anit</i> 27b, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 48).
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> These verses describe the morning sacrifice offered daily in the Holy Temple. The <i>Machzor Vitri</i> (an early siddur of French origin) does not include the Priestly Blessing and mentions these verses instead.
</i>nd there are places where they read both of them.<br>Also, [it is proper] to read chapters or laws from the Mishnah and the <i>Beraitot</i>.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> so that we will have studied passages from the written law, the Mishnah, and the Talmud and thus, emphasize how our obligation to study Torah applies to all three. Note <i>Kiddushin</i> 30a and <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 1:11, which advises one to divide his Torah study, a third in the Written Law, a third in Mishnah and a third in Talmud.
In his Order of Prayers, the Rambam lists the following passages from the oral law after the the Priestly Blessings:
These are the precepts for which no fixed limit is prescribed: <i>Pe'ah</i> (the corners of the field left unharvested for the needy, Leviticus 23:22 , <i>Bikkurim</i> (the first fruits, Exodus 23:19 , <i>HaRei'on</i> (the pilgrimage offerings, Deuteronomy 16:16-17), acts of kindness and the study of Torah. [A Mishnah, <i>Pe'ah</i> 1:1.]<br>
These are the precepts, the fruits of which a person enjoys in this world, while the principle remains [for him] in the world to come: Honoring one's mother and father, acts of kindness, concentration during prayer, visiting the sick, waking early to go to the study hall, hospitality to guests, bringing peace between man and his fellow man, and the study of Torah, which is equivalent to them all. [A <i>beraita</i>, <i>Shabbat</i> 127a]<br>
Rav Zeira says: ""Jewish women imposed a stringent practice upon themselves. Even if they saw a drop of [vaginal] blood the size of a mustard seed, they would count seven clean days after it."" [An example of Torah law, <i>Berachot</i> 31a, <i>Nidah</i> 66a, and <i>Megillah</i> 28b]<br>
It was taught in the School of Elijah: Whoever studies Torah law every day is assured of life in the world to come [as implied by Chabakuk 3:6]: ""<i>Halichot</i> (the paths of) the world are his."" Do not read <i>halichot</i>, but <i>halachot</i> (Torah laws) [<i>Megillah</i> 28b].<br>
Rabbi Eliezer said in the name of Rabbi Chanina: Torah scholars increase peace in the world as [implied by Isaiah 54:13]: ""And all your children will be students of God and great will be the peace of your children."" [<i>Berachot</i> 64a.]

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.12,"The Sages praised<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rav Kapach notes that at the beginning of this chapter, the Rambam attributes the order of the prayers to the <i>Anshei K'nesset HaGedolah</i>. Therefore, we can assume that they also instituted the practice of reciting verses of praise before the blessings of the <i>Shema</i>. (Note the statement of Rabbi Simlai, <i>Berachot</i> 32a, which suggests praising God before reciting the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>.) Though from the passage from <i>Shabbat</i> quoted below one might infer that the recitation of these verses was instituted later, perhaps this refers to the designation of the specific verses to be recited, while the practice of reciting verses itself had already existed.

Rabbi Yossi said: ""May my portion be with those who complete [the recitation of] <i>Hallel</i> every day.""<br>
That cannot be. Behold, the master taught that one who recites <i>Hallel</i> every day is considered as a blasphemer and abuser.<br>
In regard to what did [Rabbi Yossi] make his statement? In regard to פסוקי דזמרא - the verses of song.
The Rambam understands פסוקי דזמרא as referring to the last six chapters of Psalms (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). This definition is also accepted by Rav Yitzchok Alfasi and Rabbenu Asher.

It has become customary to read verses before and after them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his Order of Prayers for the Entire Year, the Rambam mentions a series of verses from Psalms and from I Chronicles 29:10-14 which are recited before and after these six Psalms. See <i>Soferim</i> 17:11. These verses are customarily recited today in both Ashkenazic and Sephardic communities.
They instituted a blessing before the [recitation of the] songs, Baruch She'amar..., - Tradition states that the <i>Anshei K'nesset HaGedolah</i> received this blessing and the blessing,<i>Yishtabach</i>, from Heaven. Therefore, our custom is to recite these blessings standing (<i>Or Zerua</i>).
The <i>Pri Chadash</i> takes issue with this view and maintains that these blessings were instituted by the <i>Geonim</i> after the conclusion of the Talmud. Though the <i>Or Zerua's</i> opinion is based only on ""tradition,"" the fact that the Jerusalem Talmud refers to these blessings, as mentioned below, indicates that they were recited during the Talmudic era.
</i>.<br>They instituted a blessing before the [recitation of the] songs, <i>Baruch She'amar</i>..., and a blessing after [concluding] them, <i>Yishtabach</i>. A<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 1:5-8.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> explain that the blessings, <i>Baruch She'amar</i> and <i>Yishtabach</i> are considered a single unit. Therefore, <i>Yishtabach</i> is considered a blessing which follows directly after another blessing - despite the verses recited between the two blessings. Accordingly, it does not begin ""Blessed are You, God....""
Though the verses of פסוקי דזמרא are not considered an interruption between the blessings, idle conversation certainly would be. Thus, the Jerusalem Talmud rules that anyone who talks between <i>Baruch She'amar</i> and <i>Yishtabach</i> has transgressed and is not fit to be part of the Jewish army (which must be composed only of righteous men).

Among Sephardic Jews, there is a custom to recite <i>Ha'azinu</i> in place of the Song of the Sea on the Tish'ah b'Av because of the verses of reproof contained in it (<i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i>).
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> It is improper to make an interruption between <i>Yishtabach</i> and the blessings of the <i>Shema</i>.

Note the custom of reciting <i>Shir hama'alot</i> at this point in prayer during the Ten Days of Repentance.
Today, we recite the Song of the Sea before <i>Yishtabach</i>. <i>Sefer HaBatim</i> suggests that this is because it is also praise of God and thus, is appropriate within the context of פסוקי דזמרא.

The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> quotes an opinion that allows the blessings recited on the reading of the Torah and haftorah to be included in the calculation of the 100 blessings. This yields another 27 blessings. For this reason, <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> suggests that the blessings on the Torah should be recited loudly so that those present are able to answer ""Amen.""

See also Chapter 8, Halachah 4, and Chapter 9, Halachah 5 for a discussion of the text of <i>Kedushah</i>.)
In this halachah, the Rambam equates all three recitations of the <i>Kedushah</i> in the morning service. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 59) cites Rav Natrunai Gaon as also sharing this opinion. There is no specific Talmudic or Midrashic source to this effect. However, the <i>Zohar</i> (Vol. II, 129b, 132b) also considers all three recitations of <i>Kedushah</i> to be bound by the same rulings.
Rabbenu Yonah quotes the opinion of the Ashkenazic authorities who distinguish between these recitations of <i>Kedushah</i>. They maintain that since, in the repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, we liken ourselves to the angels and recite the same praises, a <i>minyan</i> is necessary. However, the other <i>Kedushot</i> are simply narrative descriptions of the praises uttered by the angels and therefore, do not require a <i>minyan</i>.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 59:3) quotes the Rambam's position. The Ramah concludes that even an individual should recite the blessing without deleting the <i>Kedushah</i>.
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> writes that Rabbi Avraham, the Rambam's son, states that his father later changed his position regarding this halachah and wrote in a responsum that one should recite <i>Kedushah</i> even without a quorum of ten. This is also recorded by <i>Orchot Chayim</i>, Rashba, and Rabbenu Manoach. However, there are other responsa which indicate that the Rambam did not change his mind.

However, that passage includes the <i>Kedushah</i> and hence, according to the opinion mentioned above, should only be recited in communal prayer. Therefore, an individual recites only the supplications found at the end of that prayer.
In his Order of Prayers, the Rambam also mentions the custom of reciting the ""song of the day"" and of <i>eyn k'e-loheinu</i>.
<b>and departs to his own affairs. -</b> The <i>Tur</i> and <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 155:1) quote <i>Berachot</i> 64a which states that after prayer, one should proceed to Torah study. It is unclear why the Rambam does not mention this point.

It is unclear whether the Rambam is here referring to the practice of falling on one's face (<i>nefilat apayim</i>) or merely the recitation of supplicatory prayers (<i>tachanun</i>). Rav Amram Gaon records that in Babylonia, it was the custom to recite such prayers every night except Friday.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.2,"With regard to these five species of grain: If [flour from these species] is kneaded with fruit juice alone without any water, it will never become leavened. Even if [flour] is placed in [these juices] the entire day until the dough rises, it is permitted to be eaten [on Pesach]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This halachah is a matter of controversy among the commentators. In his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Pesachim</i> 3:1), the Rambam makes similar statements. However, in the Oxford manuscript of that text, the words ""permitted to be eaten"" are crossed out and replaced with the words ""one is not obligated for כרת."" However, it appears that this emendation was made by Rav Avraham, the Rambam's son, and not the Rambam himself.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 462:1) permits the use of fruit juice. However, the Ramah (462:4) states that it is Ashkenazic custom not to use fruit juice for matzah on Pesach out of the fear that some water might perhaps be mixed together with it (see below). Nevertheless, he does allow leniency for people who are ill or sick and have difficulty eating normal matzah.
Among the present day applications of this concept is commercially produced ""egg matzah."" According to the above guidelines, in the Ashkenazic community, such matzah:

a) cannot be used in the Seder, as explained in the commentary to Halachah 6:2;
b) must contain only eggs and fruit juice, with no water whatsoever;
c) even so, should be eaten only by those with medical problems that prevent them from eating normal matzah.

If any water is mixed with them, they cause [the flour] to become leavened<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Indeed, when water is mixed with these juices, the dough becomes leavened much faster than if it had been mixed with water alone. Generally, dough can be left eighteen minutes before it becomes leavened, but the limit for dough made from a mixture of these liquids and water is much less (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 462:2).

This law is the basis of the widely practiced leniency of cooking and baking with matzah meal. Nevertheless, certain Ashkenazic communities refrain from using matzah meal because of the custom of שרויה<i>, gebruks</i>. Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi (Responsum VI; see also <i>Sha'arei Teshuvah, Orach Chayim</i> 460:10) writes that it is possible that some of the dough was not baked thoroughly and some flour remaining in it could become chametz when cooked again.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.9,"[Exodus 12:17] states: ""Keep watch over the matzot<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Some ancient manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> include these two lines in the previous halachah, but all published texts follow this division.
</i>"" - i.e., be careful of the matzot and protect them from any possibility of becoming chametz<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Furthermore, as evident from Halachah 6:5, this verse also implies that the flour and the matzot made from it must be watched with the specific intent that they be used for the mitzvah of eating matzah on Pesach.
The above is the source for the practice of eating <i>shemurah matzah</i>, matzah made from grain which has been watched to ensure that it did not become chametz and prepared with the intent that it be used for the mitzvah of eating matzah. The use of such matzah during the Seder is an absolute requirement (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 460), and it is advisable to use it throughout the holiday.

Therefore, our Sages declared: A person must be careful regarding the grain which he eats on Pesach<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Pesachim</i> 40a relates that Ravvah would tell the harvesters cutting wheat for Pesach: ""Have the intent that this grain be used for the mitzvah of matzah.""

</i> after it has been harvested<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Based on the above passage from <i>Pesachim</i>, Rav Yitzchak Alfasi and the Rambam require that the grain be watched from the time of harvesting onward. Nevertheless, Rabbenu Asher follows a more lenient policy and does not require the wheat to be watched until it is ground. [Rabbenu Nissim explains that even Rav Yitzchak Alfasi only recommended watching the matzah from harvesting as a pious measure, and not as an absolute rule.]
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 453:4) explains that it is preferable to use grain that has been watched from harvesting; as a minimum requirement, one must use grain that has been watched from the time it has been ground into flour. If there is no other alternative, one may buy flour in the marketplace and begin watching from the time the dough is kneaded.
The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> clarifies the latter point explaining that where grain is washed or submerged in water before grinding it into flour, such grain may not be used for matzah. (This practice is still common in many communities.) In practice, most <i>shemurah matzah</i> made at present is watched from the time the grain was harvested.

The <i>Rokeach</i> mentioned that in his age, baking conditions had changed from Talmudic times. More people were involved in the process and the ovens were larger and baked matzot more quickly. Therefore, leniency was taken as regards the restriction of the size of the dough. However, the Shulchan Aruch HaRav and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> both recommend adhering to the former practice.

That halachah specifically states that a sick person may be given chametz to eat as a remedy.
Furthermore, that halachah explains that if the sick person does not benefit from the forbidden substance in the normal manner, it may be used as a remedy even if there is no danger to life or limb. The Rambam gives the example of including chametz in a compress.
On that basis, Rabbenu Manoach questions why wheat cannot be used as a poultice as stated in our halachah. However, he resolves the issue by explaining that, in our case, the wheat would become chametz before it was applied to the wound.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 466:5 (and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i>) emphasize that it is permitted to use grain as a remedy for a wound only if there is a question of danger to life or limb. Furthermore, this leniency is qualified as follows:
a) it must be an established medical fact that the remedy works;
b) effort must be made to reduce the chance of the grain becoming leavened to the greatest extent possible (e.g., preparing grain by boiling it in fruit juice which does not become leavened).

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.20,"It is permissible to place spices<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Nevertheless, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 455:6) advises against placing spices in dough.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (455:5) explicitly advises against placing salt into dough<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for this mixture will not cause the dough to become chametz. In describing the meal offerings which cannot become leavened (<i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 12:17), the Rambam also states that they may be seasoned in a similar manner.
The <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Pesachim</i> 2:13) and the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Pesachim</i> 2:4) go further and state that such matzah may even be used at the Seder. Though some halachic authorities accept this opinion, the later authorities counsel against using such matzah on that occasion.

Similarly, it is permissible to knead the dough with water and oil, honey or milk, or to baste with them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This statement has raised controversy. In Halachah 2, when the Rambam described the use of מי פירות, he explained that they will not cause grain products to become leavened when used alone. However, if they are mixed with water, they can cause the grain products to become leavened. Indeed, the commentaries relate that the mixture of these liquids with water speeds up the leavening process.
Therefore, the Ra'avad and other authorities question the leniency granted by the Rambam. In practice, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 462:2) advises against, but does not forbid, mixing these liquids with water. The Ramah (and accordingly, Ashkenazic custom) prohibits such a mixture entirely.
It must be noted that the <i>Maggid Mishneh's</i> text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> substitutes the word יין (wine) for מים (water). According to such a rendition, there is no difficulty.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.21,"All earthenware vessels<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In this and the following five halachot, the Rambam discusses how dishes and cooking utensils that were used for chametz during the entire year may<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> only

This safeguard was only instituted for earthenware vessels, since the chametz absorbed in substances of metal or wood may be purged through הגעלה.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 451:22) does not recognize this prohibition at all and allows such utensils to be used for matzah even when hot. However, this is merely from an abstract halachic perspective. In practice, that text continues to explain, Jews are accustomed not to use any earthenware utensils or dishes that had been previously used for chametz on Pesach. This custom was already accepted in the days of Rav Yitzchak Alfasi and Rabbenu Asher.

</i> כלי ראשון - e.g., pots and stew pots<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 451:5) requires that the surface of the pot be smooth and free of nicks or cracks for this manner of purging to be effective.

Once that prohibition takes effect, even the slightest amount of chametz can cause a larger mixture to be prohibited. (See Halachah 1:5.) Hence, were the process carried out at that time, the residue of chametz absorbed in the walls of the utensils would cause all the water to be considered as mixed with chametz.

Thus, a similar description of this process is found in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 17:4.
The basic principle governing the kashering of utensils is כבולעו כך פולטו - ""In the same manner as a [forbidden substance] is absorbed [by a utensil], so, too, is it released."" Thus, since these utensils were used in hot water, the process of boiling is employed to cause them to release any chametz they might have absorbed.
</i> until they release [what they absorbed]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This phrase is taken from the <i>halachot</i> of Rav Yitzchak Alfasi. However, it is omitted in some of the Yemenite manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. In practice, there is also debate about this issue. In his responsum, the Rashbah explains Rav Yitzchak Alfasi's view, stating that a person should leave the utensil submerged until he feels that all the absorbed chametz has been released. However, the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 121) and the <i>Pri Chadash</i> do not require waiting any substantial amount of time. Their view is accepted by the later authorities. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Orach Chayim</i> 452:4.)
</i>. Afterwards, they should be washed off with cold water<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in order to cleanse them of any forbidden matter that might remain on their surface (Rabbenu Manoach). The source for this requirement is the description (<i>Zevachim</i> 97a) of the way the priests would purge the Temple pots used to cook the sin offerings after the previous day's service. Though some authorities do not require this stage, the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (452:5) states that it is customary to follow this practice.

Similarly, [with regard to] knives, the blade — <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 17:7 states: ""A person who acquires a knife from a gentile must burn it out in fire."" A similar decision is rendered by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 121:7). Nevertheless, the authorities suggest that chametz may be purged from knives by boiling. However, they do not permit this leniency in the following instances:
a) when the knives are rusty;
b) when they have serrated edges;
c) when the handle is separate from the blade and enclosed around it, allowing for the possibility for residue to collect between them.
In the latter instance, even ליבון (exposing the knife to open fire) is insufficient. Since most knives today are made in this manner, they should not be kashered for Pesach or for ordinary use after having been used with prohibited foods. Both the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> state that purchasing new knives for Pesach is the most desirable manner of fulfilling the mitzvah.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 5.25,"All earthenware utensils that were used for chametz in hot water<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In contrast to utensils made of other substances, the process of הגעלה cannot remove the forbidden matter absorbed in the walls of an earthenware vessel.

<i>Pesachim</i> 30b explains that this concept is derived from the Torah itself. Leviticus 6:21 states that any pot in which meat from a sin offering has been cooked must be broken. A sin offering can only be eaten for one day. Once that time has passed, the taste of the meat absorbed in the pot is considered as נותר (sacrificial meat which has been kept past its required time), and thus forbidden.

Based on the above, the text <i>Galia Masechta</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 3) explains that the essential element of the mitzvah is the <i>teru'ah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> a blast which is interrupted into shorter sounds, as described in Halachot 2-4.

In this halachah, the Rambam explains the reason for Rabbi Abahu's action.
The Rambam's statements are accepted by Rabbenu Asher, Rabbenu Nissim, and most other authorities. Nevertheless, it is significant that Rav Hai Gaon, one of the major authorities who preceded the Rambam, offers a different explanation for Rabbi Abahu's actions.
Rav Hai Gaon maintains that it is impossible that a doubt existed among the Jewish people concerning such an important manner as sounding the shofar. Since the shofar was sounded each year, surely the tradition could have been maintained. Hence, he explains that all the different manners of sounding the shofar were acceptable and that Rabbi Abahu's contribution was the establishment of a uniform custom that included all the different practices common among the Jewish people. By mentioning the ""many years"" and ""exiles,"" the Rambam addresses himself to the question raised by Rav Hai Gaon.

The commentaries have emphasized the homiletic aspects of these halachot. On Rosh Hashanah, a Jew must concentrate on the coronation of God as King of the world. He may feel internal distress when he meditates on how his daily behavior does not reflect the proper relation between a subject and his king. Ultimately, this may motivate him to sigh and even to cry.

It must be noted that from the passage on <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 34a it seems that Rabbi Abahu instituted the series of three <i>teru'ot</i> before the series of three <i>shevarim</i>.
</i>e repeats this pattern [until he completes] three series<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in order to have heard the three series of blasts required by Halachah 1.
Although the pattern of shofar blowing described by the Rambam has become universally accepted among the Jewish people, it is unclear when this practice was first instituted. One of the fundamental texts of the period directly following the conclusion of the Talmud, the <i>Sh'eltot</i> of Rav Achai Gaon (note 171), mentions a different practice.
Three series of blasts from each pattern are not blown directly after each other. Rather, after sounding three series of <i>teki'ah, shevarim, teru'ah, teki'ah</i>, three series of <i>teki'ah, shevarim, teki'ah</i>, and then three series of <i>teki'ah, teru'ah, teki'ah</i> is sounded.
</i>.<br>[Then,] he sounds a <i>teki'ah</i>; afterwards, a <i>teru'ah</i>; and afterwards, a <i>teki'ah</i>. H<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as explained above.

</i>e repeats this pattern [until he completes] three series<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> to fulfill the obligation explained in Halachah 1.
</i>.<br>Thus, there are a total of thirty shofar blasts<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> 18 <i>teki'ot</i>, six <i>shevarim</i>, and six <i>teru'ot</i>.
From the Rambam's expression, it appears that he considers the <i>shevarim</i> and <i>teru'ah</i> sounded in the first series as two separate blasts. From this, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> derives a halachic insight, maintaining that according to the Rambam, one may take a breath between the two. (The <i>Mayim Chayim</i> supports this conclusion, noting that, regarding this series, the Rambam states that one should blow ""three <i>shevarim</i>, and afterwards, a <i>teru'ah</i>."") Nevertheless, the Ramban and other authorities do not permit this leniency.
Regarding <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i>, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 590:4) suggests adhering to the more stringent view regarding the <i>teki'ot</i> required by Torah law. However, the Ramah maintains that this is unnecessary. Both the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 590:9, 10 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 590:20 suggest adhering to whichever practice is customarily followed in one's local community. However, if there is no accepted custom, the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> suggests accepting the more stringent practice.
</i>, in order to remove any doubt<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as mentioned in the previous halachah.
Though all three sounds would be included in the series of <i>teki'ah, shevarim, teru'ah, teki'ah</i>, it would be insufficient for such a series alone to be sounded. According to the opinions that maintain that a <i>teru'ah</i> is either sobbing or crying alone, there would be another sound interrupting between either the <i>teki'ah</i> which precedes or that which follows the <i>teru'ah</i> (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 34a).

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.4","The required length of a <i>teru'ah</i> is that of two <i>teki'ot</i>. T<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., the length of the three <i>shevarim</i> should resemble a series of <i>teru'ot</i>.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> These statements are the source of much controversy among the Rabbis. The Mishnah (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 33b) states: ""The required length of the <i>teki'ah</i> is three <i>teru'ot</i>; a <i>teru'ah</i> is three sobs.""
The Talmud questions:

Behold, the <i>baraita</i> has taught: ""the required length of a <i>teki'ah</i> is that of a <i>teru'ah</i>!""
Abbaye replied: ""The author of the Mishnah considered the length of all the <i>teki'ot</i> in comparison to the length of all the <i>teru'ot</i>. The author of the <i>baraita</i> considered the length of each blast. There is no difference of opinion between them.""

In his commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam interprets the above to mean: ""The required length of all six <i>teki'ot</i> is equivalent to the required length of all three <i>teru'ot</i>,"" thus establishing each <i>teru'ah</i> as twice the length of a <i>teki'ah</i>. Hence, according to the Rambam, the length of the <i>teki'ot</i> are dependent on the length of the <i>teru'ot</i>.
Rabbenu Nissim objects to the Rambam's interpretation, explaining that the word והעברת, the verb mentioned in the commandment to blow the shofar, implies a long blast, and hence the measure mentioned by the Rambam would not be appropriate.
Similarly, the Ra'avad does not accept the Rambam's interpretation, and explains that the Mishnah establishes an independent measure for the length of a <i>teki'ah</i> - three <i>teru'ot</i> - with each <i>teru'ah</i> being equal to three short sobs. Thus, the measure of a <i>teki'ah</i> is equivalent to nine short sounds. The Ramban and the Rashba also subscribe to this view.
Rashi and most Ashkenazic authorities accept the simple meaning of the Mishnah and explain that a <i>teki'ah</i> is equal to the length of a <i>teru'ah</i>. However, as explained in the previous halachot, there are three different interpretations of the definition of a <i>teru'ah</i>. Thus, the required length for the <i>teki'ah</i> varies accordingly.
Regarding <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i>, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 590:3) mentions the views of Rashi and the Ra'avad, but not that of the Rambam.

a) because of the cacophony of sounds, the listener is unable to properly distinguish any one;
b) As stated in the previous halachah, one must hear the shofar blasts in the proper order, a <i>teki'ah</i> preceding and following a <i>teru'ah</i>; that requirement is not fulfilled in this instance.
Rashi, in his commentary on <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 34b, disagrees with the Rambam's decision, explaining that <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 27a states that even though two people blow the shofar simultaneously, since the mitzvah is dear to the hearer, he will concentrate sufficiently to differentiate between the sounds. Furthermore, the <i>Tosefta</i> 2:12 states specifically that one does fulfill one's obligation in this manner.
<i>Tosafot</i> disagrees with Rashi, mentioning the second reason stated by Rabbenu Manoach. It appears that the Rambam goes further and discounts Rashi's opinion entirely. According to <i>Tosafot</i>, the listener will have heard at least the first <i>teki'ah</i>, while the Rambam explicitly states ""he has not fulfilled his obligation for a single blast."" (See <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>.)
The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 588:3 quotes the Rambam's decision as halachah. The Ramah quotes the law from <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 27a, allowing a person to fulfill his obligation even though he heard two people blowing the shofar at the same time, provided he heard the blasts in the proper order.

Nevertheless, if a person knows how to sound both <i>teki'ot</i> and <i>shevarim</i>, he should sound three series of such blasts even if he does not know how to sound a <i>teru'ah</i>. Since it is possible that the mitzvah may be fulfilled by these series (as explained in Halachot 2 and 3), at the very least they should be sounded (Rabbenu Nissim, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 593:2).

The Sages explain (ibid., 32b) that it would have been appropriate to institute the shofar blowing in the morning service. However, the Romans desired to stamp out the performance of the mitzvot and sent guards to make sure that the mitzvah was not fulfilled. After midday, the guards left, and then, in the musaf service, the shofar would be sounded.
Originally, the Sages' decree involved determining the place of the service when the mitzvah required by the Torah would be fulfilled and this halachah must be interpreted in that context. However, as explained in Halachot 11 and 12, it became universally accepted Jewish custom to blow the shofar before the musaf prayers to fulfill the Torah's commandment, and thus ""confuse the Satan"" even before the beginning of our prayers, and then to sound the shofar again in the midst of those prayers to fulfill the Rabbinic decree.

Among the resolutions offered to this difficulty is that chronologically, the Psalms were written before the prophecies quoted (<i>Tosafot, Rosh Hashanah</i> 32a).
Examples of the verses recited are mentioned in the following halachah and commentary.
</i>. One concludes with a verse from the Torah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> because of the dearness of the Torah. <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 32b explains that this was the custom of the experienced Sages of Jerusalem.

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> However, one should preferably conclude with a verse from the Torah. This is our present practice.
From the statements of the Rambam and the relevant passages from the Mishnah and Talmud, it would appear that originally there was no standard text containing universally accepted verses for these blessings. Rather, certain verses were commonly accepted and would be recited by almost all those who prayed. Others were left to the preference of each individual.
(One must remember that machzorim were uncommon in this period, and most of the prayers were recited by heart. Thus, the verses chosen by an individual might often have been those which he had been able to commit to memory.)
</i>.<br>Should a person recite only one verse from the Torah, one from the sacred writings, and one from the prophets<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Thus mentioning three verses in each blessing, one from each division of the <i>T'nach</i>
</i>, he fulfills his obligation. Even if he states: ""In Your Torah, God, our Lord, it is written..."" and recites one verse from the Torah and concludes, nothing further is necessary<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The commentaries have questioned the Rambam's statements, which appear self-contradictory. In the previous clause, he stated that one must recite three verses - one from the Torah, one from the prophets, and one from the writings - to fulfill one's obligation, while this clause implies that the recitation of one is sufficient.
The source for the difficulty is the following quotes: The Mishnah, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 32a, states:

One should not recite fewer than ten verses for <i>Malchuyot</i>, ten for <i>Zichronot</i>, and ten for <i>Shofarot</i>. Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri says: ""If one recites three - three of each - one fulfills his obligation.""

<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 35a quotes Rav Chanan'el as saying in the name of Rav:

Even if he states: ""In Your Torah, it is written..."" [and recites one verse], nothing further is necessary.

From the Talmud, it appears that both these statements are accepted as halachah. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam interprets Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri's requirement of three verses as the total for all three blessings. Thus, for each blessing, one must state ""In Your Torah, it is written..."" and recite a single appropriate verse. [This surely differs from the Rambam's statements in his commentary on the Mishnah.]
The Ramban, Rabbenu Nissim, and others explain that Rav Chanan'el agrees with Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri and thus, in addition to ""In Your Torah, it is written...,"" he also requires one to say: ""In Your holy writings, it is recorded...,"" and: ""by your prophets, it was proclaimed...,"" mentioning an appropriate verse in each instance. (This opinion is quoted by <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 586:8 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 591:11.)
Alternatively, one may explain the Rambam's position as follows: Ideally, one should recite ten verses for each blessing; after the fact, three are sufficient, as stated by Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri. When does this apply? Once one has recited at least one verse from the Torah. However, if one has not recited any verses, it is sufficient to say ""In Your Torah, it is written..."" and recite a single verse from the Torah, as Rav Chanan'el said in the name of Rav.
The flexibility regarding the number of quotes in each blessing was only granted in the previous generations. Since at present we have adopted a standard set of blessings, a person should not delete verses at will (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 591:6; <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 591:8).

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.9","One should not recite [verses for] <i>Malchuyot, Zichronot</i>, and <i>Shofarot</i> which describe [Divine] retribution; f<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> It is uncertain why the Rambam mentions a verse for <i>Zichronot</i> before one of <i>Malchuyot</i>.

The Talmud objects to this verse because it is of an individual nature. Though it continues to resolve that difficulty, explaining that God's granting providence to Sarah effected the future of the entire Jewish people, the Rambam nevertheless avoided the problem by choosing the verse which is clearly of general import.

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Despite this decision, only the latter verse is included in the text of the blessings we recite on Rosh Hashanah.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The meaning of פקד is often ""remember."" Indeed, the Targum of the cited verse in Genesis is דכיר, the Aramaic for ""remembered."" Furthermore, the Talmud mentions that Rabbi Yosse allowed verses using the verb פקד, and although Rabbi Yehudah objected, in differences of opinion between the two, Rabbi Yosse's position is generally favored. Nevertheless, since there are many verses that use the verb זכר, there is no difficulty in establishing a practice that will be accepted by all opinions (<i>Beit Yosef</i> 591).
</i>ne may mention verses that refer to retribution to be visited upon the gentile nations - for example, [Psalms 99:1]: ""God is King, the nations will tremble...""; [Psalms 137:7]: ""Remember, O God, against the Edomites, the day of Jerusalem""; or [Zechariah 9:14]: ""God, the Lord, will sound the shofar and proceed in a southerly storm-wind.""<br>All the following verses: [Deuteronomy 6:4]: ""Hear Israel, God is our Lord, God is one""; [Deuteronomy 4:35]: ""To you, it has been revealed that you may know...""; and [Deuteronomy 4:39]: ""And you shall know today and draw it close to your heart..."" express the concept of God's sovereignty. Even though [these verses] do not explicitly mention His kingship, they are equivalent to [Exodus 16:18]: ""God will rule forever and ever""; and [Deuteronomy 33:5]: ""When He became King in Jeshurun<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Shemot Rabbah</i> 48:4 states that this verse refers to Moses. Though the Rambam accepts the principle that Moses served the people as a king (see <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 6:11), he does not necessarily view this verse as the source for that concept.
The verses which have been accepted in the standard text for these blessings are as follows:
<i>MALCHUYOT</i>
Torah

And you shall know today and draw it close to your heart that God is the Lord in the heavens above and the earth below. There is nothing else (Deuteronomy 4:39 .
God will rule forever and ever (Exodus 15:18 .
He does not look at iniquity in Jacob or see wrongdoing in Israel; God, his Lord, is with him and the desire of the King is in him (Numbers 23:21 .
And there was a King in Jeshurun and the heads of the people assembled, together with all the tribes of Israel (Deuteronomy 33:5 .

<i>Psalms</i>

For sovereignty is God's and He rules over the nations (22:29).
God is King. He has clothed Himself with grandeur; the Lord has girded Himself with strength. He has established the world firmly so that it will not falter (93:1).
Lift up your heads, O gates; be upraised, eternal doors, so the glorious King may enter. Who is the glorious King? God, strong and mighty, God, mighty in battle. Lift up your heads, O gates; be upraised, eternal doors, so the glorious King may enter. Who is the glorious King? The God of hosts. He is the glorious King for eternity (24:7-10).

<i>Prophets</i>

Thus said God, King and Redeemer of Israel, the God of hosts, ""I am the first and I am the last. Aside from Me, there is no God"" (Isaiah 44:6 .

God will be King over the entire earth. On that day, God will be One, and His name, One (Zechariah 14:9 .

<i>Concluding Verse</i>

Hear Israel, God is our Lord, God is One (Deuteronomy 6:4 .

<i>ZICHRONOT</i>
<i>Torah</i>

And God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the livestock that were with him in the ark. And God caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters were calmed (Genesis 8:1 .
God heard their outcry. And God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob (Exodus 2:24 .
I will remember My covenant with Jacob, also my covenant with Isaac, and also My covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land (Leviticus 26:42 .

<i>Psalms</i>

He has made a remembrance of His wonders, gracious and merciful is God (111:4).
He provides sustenance to those who fear Him. He will remember His covenant forever (111:5).
For them, He remembered His covenant and He relented in accordance with His abundant kindness (106:45).

<i>Prophets</i>

Go and call out in the ears of Jerusalem, saying: ""Thus said God, 'For you, I remember the devotion of your youth, the love of your bridal days, as you went after Me in the desert, in an uncultivated land' (Jeremiah 2:2 .
I will remember My covenant with you [made] in the days of your youth, and I will fulfill it for you as an everlasting covenant (Ezekiel 16:60 .
""Is Ephraim not My beloved son? Is he not a precious child? For whenever I speak of him, I recall him even more. The inner parts of my being stir for him. I will surely have compassion on him,"" says God (Jeremiah 31:19 .

<i>Concluding Verse</i>

For them, I will remember the covenant with their ancestors, whom I took out from the land of Egypt before the eyes of the nations to be their Lord. I am God (Leviticus 26:45 .

<i>SHOFAROT</i>
Torah

And it was on the third day, at dawn. There was thunder and lightning and a heavy cloud on the mountain. The sound of the shofar was very strong and all the people in the camp trembled (Exodus 19:16 .
And the sound of the shofar proceeded, becoming stronger. Moses spoke and God answered Him out loud (Exodus 19:19 .
And all the people saw the voices and the flames, the sound of the shofar and the mountain smoking. The people saw and recoiled and stood off from afar (Exodus 20:15 .

<i>Psalms</i>

The Lord ascends through <i>teru'ah</i>, God through the sound of the shofar (47:6).
Sound off with trumpets and the call of the shofar before the King, God (98:6).
Blow the shofar on the new moon, on the appointed time of our sacred day. For it is a statute for Israel; an ordinance of the Lord od Israel (81:4-5)
Praise God. Praise the Almighty in His holiness. Praise Him in the firmament of His strength. Praise Him for His mighty acts. Praise Him according to His abundant greatness. Praise Him with the call of the shofar. Praise Him with harp and lyre. Praise Him with timbrel and dance. Praise Him with stringed instruments and flute. Praise Him with loud cymbals. Praise Him with resounding cymbals. Let every being with a soul praise God. Halleluyah (150).

<i>Prophets</i>

All those who inhabit the world, who dwell on earth: When the banner is raised on the mountain, you will see. When the shofar is sounded, you will hear (Isaiah 18:3 .
And it shall be on that day, that a great shofar will be sounded, and those who were lost in the land of Asshur and those who were banished in the land of Egypt shall come and bow down to God on the holy mountain in Jerusalem (Isaiah 27:13 .
And God will appear over them and His arrow shall go forth like lightning. God, the Lord, will sound the shofar and proceed in a southerly storm-wind (Zechariah 9:14-15).

<i>Concluding Verse</i>

And on the days of your rejoicing; on your holidays, and on your Rosh Chodesh days, you shall sound the trumpets over your burnt-offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings, and they shall be a remembrance for you before your Lord. I am God, your Lord (Numbers 10:10 .

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.10","The following is the commonly accepted custom for blowing the shofar on Rosh Hashanah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned in Halachah 7 and the commentary, the Sages had originally ordained that a person hear the shofar blasts required by the Torah in the midst of the musaf service. However, as evident from <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 16a-b, even in Talmudic times the custom mentioned by the Rambam was already the general practice.
</i> in the communal services:<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The laws pertaining to an individual are mentioned at the conclusion of Halachah 12.
</i><br>After the Torah is read<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 13:10 states:

The common custom is to read on the first day: ""And God showed providence to Sarah..., and on the second day: ""And God presented a trial to Abraham...""

As stated in that halachah, the haftarah is recited after the Torah reading is concluded.
</i> and returned to its place<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though at present, Ashkenazic custom is to blow the shofar in the presence of the Torah scrolls, the Rambam's son, Rav Avraham, supports his father's decision in the <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i>, explaining that it is not proper to make any interruptions between the shofar blowings which precede musaf and those within the prayer service.
</i>, the congregation is seated<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This practice is mentioned in <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 16a and the <i>Sh'eltot</i> of Rav Achai Gaon. However, today it is Ashkenazic custom to stand when hearing these shofar blasts. Nevertheless, based on this original practice, these are still referred to as <i>teki'ot meiyoshav</i> - ""the <i>teki'ot</i> sounded while seated.""
</i>. One person stands<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rabbenu Manoach questions the need for the person blowing the shofar to stand. He offers two possible explanations:
a) as a mark of deference to the community;
b) in respect for the blessing recited, as implied by Nehemiah 8:4.
The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> quotes the Jerusalem Talmud (the location of the source in the Jerusalem Talmud is a matter of question) as drawing an analogy (גזרה שוה) between the blowing of the shofar and the counting of the Omer. Hence, just as the Omer must be counted while standing, the shofar should be sounded in a similar position.
</i> and recites the blessing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as required before the fulfillment of any positive commandment (<i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:1,2,8).
</i>:

Blessed are You, God, Lord of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to hear the sounding of the shofar<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 1, the fundamental aspect of the mitzvah is hearing, not blowing, the shofar. Nevertheless, the <i>Sh'eltot</i> suggests concluding the blessing ""to blow the shofar"" and the <i>Sefer Mitzvot HaGadol</i> advises the text ""concerning the blowing of the shofar.""
</i>.

The entire congregation responds ""Amen."" He then recites the blessing <i>shehecheyanu</i>, a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as explained in Halachah 3.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as is necessary before the fulfillment of any mitzvah performed infrequently (<i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:9).

Thirty shofar blasts are sounded in the proper order.<br>Kaddish is recited<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> ""The chazan always recites Kaddish before and after every prayer service (Rambam, <i>Seder Tefillot kol Shanah</i>).""
</i>. The congregation stands<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and remain standing during the repetition of the the <i>Amidah</i> as well. Therefore, the shofar blasts sounded during these prayers are referred to as <i>teki'ot m'umad</i> (the shofar blasts sounded while standing).
</i> and recites the musaf service<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in a hushed tone.
The <i>Tur</i> relates that there were varying customs regarding the recitation of the musaf service in a hushed tone. In certain communities, it had been customary for the congregation to recite the musaf prayers as on other festivals without reciting <i>Malchuyot, Zichronot</i>, and <i>Shofarot</i>. Only the chazan would recite the latter. However, even in the <i>Tur's</i> time, the prevailing custom was that even the congregation recited these three blessings.
The <i>Sh'lah</i> records the custom of sounding the shofar for <i>Malchuyot, Zichronot,</i> and <i>Shofarot</i> while the congregation recites the <i>Amidah</i>. However, this custom is not accepted in all communities.
</i>. After the chazan completes the fourth blessing - i.e., <i>Malchuyot</i> - a <i>teki'ah</i>, three <i>shevarim</i>, a [series of] <i>teru'ot</i>, and a <i>teki'ah</i> are sounded once.<br>H<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The rationale for this practice and the different customs associated with these shofar blasts are discussed in Halachah 12 and its commentary.
In the text of prayers with which the Rambam concludes <i>Sefer Ha'ahavah</i>, he also mentions the recitation of the prayer <i>Hayom Harat Olam</i>.
</i>e then recites the fifth blessing - i.e., <i>Zichronot</i>. After he completes the blessing, a <i>teki'ah</i>, three <i>shevarim</i>, and a <i>teki'ah</i> are sounded. He then recites the sixth blessing - i.e., <i>Shofarot</i>. After he completes the blessing, a <i>teki'ah</i>, a [series of] <i>teru'ot</i>, and a <i>teki'ah</i> are sounded once, and he concludes the prayers."

</i> while they stand<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rav Hai Gaon also mentions this practice. The <i>Kolbo</i> explains that it is appropriate, since ""when a person begins a mitzvah, we tell him to complete it"" (Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 1:8). Nevertheless, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 592:7 writes that in many communities, it has become customary to divide the honor of shofar blowing between two individuals.
</i>. He<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., the person blowing the shofar. Rabbi Yitzchak Alfasi and Rabbenu Asher write that not only he, but the entire congregation should refrain from speaking.

</i>."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.12","It is logical that each series of shofar blasts should be sounded three times for every blessing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Because of the doubt mentioned in Halachah 3, it would be proper for us to blow three series of blasts - i.e., <i>teki'ah, shevarim, teru'ah, teki'ah; teki'ah, shevarim, teki'ah</i>; and <i>teki'ah, teru'ah, teki'ah</i> - at the conclusion of each blessing.

</i> satisfied every possible doubt<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> regarding the proper manner of blowing the shofar, as explained in Halachah 3.
</i> [by hearing] the shofar while seated, there is no need for the congregation to repeat them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> these shofar blasts
</i> in their entirety during the order of blessings. Rather, it is sufficient for them to hear one series for each blessing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and fulfilled the requirement of the Sages mentioned in Halachah 7.
In practice, a number of different customs are followed regarding this matter. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 592:1) suggests following the pattern described by the Rambam, but sounding each series three times, rather than once. The Ramah writes that Ashkenazic custom is to sound one series - <i>teki'ah, shevarim, teru'ah, teki'ah</i> - after each blessing. However, the <i>Sh'lah</i> suggests blowing three series of blasts - i.e., <i>teki'ah, shevarim, teru'ah, teki'ah; teki'ah, shevarim, teki'ah</i>; and <i>teki'ah, teru'ah, teki'ah</i> - at the conclusion of each blessing.

</i>, and they will thus have heard the shofar during the order of blessings.<br>All of the above applies only to a congregation<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as specifically stated in Halachot 7 and 10.
</i>. However, there is no [set] custom regarding an individual. He fulfills his obligation whether or not he hears [the shofar blasts] during the order of blessings<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Some authorities object to the permission granted by the Rambam for an individual to interrupt his recitation of the the <i>Amidah</i> in order to hear the sounding of the shofar.

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As explained in the notes on Chapter 1, it is ""purposeful work,"" מלאכת מחשבת, which the Torah has forbidden.

<b>They are alluded to by [the statement of] the prophet [Malachi 2:3]: ""I will spread dung on your faces, the dung of your feasts."" -</b> We have translated the verse in keeping with the interpretation of our Sages quoted below. However, in its original context, the verse refers to those who bring the festival offerings without proper intent.
<b>Our Sages -</b> <i>Shabbat</i> 151b
<b>explain: These are the people who eat and drink and make all their days like feast days. -</b> Though it is a mitzvah to celebrate the Sabbaths and festivals with feasts, here we are referring to those who feast:<br>
a) self-indulgently and without a commitment to fulfill God's will; and<br>
b) constantly and not only on select occasions.
<b>They say, ""Eat and drink for tomorrow, we will die.""</b> This statement is found in Isaiah 22:13. However, the Rambam is not quoting the verse as a support, he is merely borrowing the expression to exemplify an existential search for pleasure.
<b>This is the food of the wicked. It is these tables which the verse censures, saying: ""For all tables are full of vomit and excrement; there is no room"" (Isaiah 28:8 . -</b> The final word of the verse, <i>makom</i>, can also refer to God and thus, implies that God's presence is also lacking. Eating for the sake of indulgence is the direct opposite of the approach of ""Knowing God in all your ways"" described previously.
<i>Avot</i> 3:3 also quotes this verse and the Rambam alludes to that mishnah in the following halachah.
In contrast, a wise man eats only one dish or two, eating only enough to sustain him. That is sufficient for him. - As a source for eating two dishes, the commentaries have suggested <i>Derech Eretz Rabbah</i>, Chapter 7:
It happened that Rabbi Akiva served a meal to his students. [The servants] brought two dishes before them... they ate and were satisfied.
As a source for eating one dish, they point to (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 94b):
""And may the name of the righteous be blessed (Proverbs 3:33 "" - this refers to Hezekiah, king of Judah, who ate [only] a <i>litra</i> of greens for a meal.
These sources notwithstanding, it appears that the Rambam is merely stating that a Sage should confine himself to simple and modest fare; he may not have had a specific source in mind.
<b>This is alluded to by Solomon's statement: ""The righteous man eats to satisfy his soul"" (Proverbs 13:25 . -</b> Note the Rambam's use of this verse in Chapter 1, Halachah 4.

Human Dispositions 5.2,"When the wise man eats the little which is fitting for him, he should eat it only in his own home, at his table. H<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Kol Ya'akov</i> notes that this store may even be one specifically designated for eating, e.g., a restaurant, coffee-shop, or the like.

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The previous halachah discussed the quantity of food and the attitude with which it was to be eaten. The present halachah concerns itself with the place and the company in which the wise should eat. It revolves around the principle that a person should be modest while eating and refrain from doing so in public. (See the Guide to the Perplexed, ibid.)
</i>e should not eat in a store or in the marketplace<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Ma'aserot</i> 3:2 mentions this prohibition in reference to a Torah Sage, the Babylonian Talmud, <i>Kiddushin</i> 40b condemns even a common person for such behavior, stating: ""Whoever eats in the marketplace is like a dog."" The passage in <i>Kiddushin</i> continues to explain that such a person is unacceptable as a witness and the Rambam quotes that law (<i>Hilchot Edut</i> 11:5).
The commentaries have attempted to resolve this difficulty in different ways: For example <i>Tosafot, Kiddushin</i> (ibid.) explains that a common person is condemned only if he eats a full meal in the market place, while a wise man should not eat anything at all in public. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> (<i>Hilchot Edut</i>) differentiates between eating in a crowded place - which is forbidden for everyone - and eating in a quiet corner - which is deemed improper only for a Sage. The <i>Bach</i> (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 34) explains that a common person is censored only for eating while walking through the market place, while the wise man should not eat in public even while standing in one place.
Nevertheless, it must be noted that in this halachah, the Rambam uses the expression <i>chacham</i> (a wise man), his ideal for a person with a developed personality, and not <i>talmid chacham</i> (a Torah Sage). Apparently, he does not differentiate between a Torah Sage and a common person in this matter and requires a refined, highly developed standard in meeting our physical needs from everyone.

However, if the Sage derives benefit from the common person, he will come to regard the Sage like an earthenware shard.
Note <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 5:11, where the Rambam equates the dining of a learned and pious man together with the unlearned with the desecration of the Name of God. See also <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> (25:4) where he rules that communal leaders and judges should not eat and drink with the common people.

[When] three eat at one table and do not speak words of Torah there, it is as if they eat from sacrifices to the dead [i.e., idols] as [Isaiah 28:8] states: ""For all tables are full of vomit and excrement; there is no room.""
In his commentary to this mishnah, the Rambam writes:
Previously, the verse dealt with eating and drinking while forsaking the Torah and those who study it. Therefore, all of these tables are considered as if excrement and filth; i.e., the foods of idol worship, are eaten upon them.
Furthermore,...
</i>."" He should not eat frequently in other places<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> outside his own home; i.e., the wise man, even when he eats in a private home and in the proper company, should limit the number of homes that he frequents (<i>Pesachim</i> 49a).
</i>, even in the company of wise men, nor should he eat where there is a large gathering<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The reason for these restrictions is, as the Rambam expresses in the Guide to the Perplexed (ibid.), a basic desire for a person, particularly when he relates to others, to emphasize the refined and developed aspects of his being and not those which he shares with other animals. Therefore, even when there is no danger of subjecting himself to undesirable influences or disgracing the Torah with which he is identified, he should refrain from performing a physical activity like eating in the presence of others.

<i>Erusin</i> translated as ""betrothal,"" refers to the first stage of the marriage process, i.e., giving the woman the wedding ring. In Talmudic and post-Talmudic times, this ceremony was carried out before the actual wedding (<i>nisuin</i>). At present, we perform the two stages of the wedding, <i>erusin</i> and <i>nisuin</i> together. Thus, reference to what we term engagement as <i>erusin</i> is technically a misnomer.

The Torah gives examples of the degrading effects of drunkenness (Noah, Genesis, Chapter 8; Lot, Genesis, Chapter 19). There are specific prohibitions against drinking - e.g. a priest is not allowed to perform the priestly services while under the influence of alcohol (Leviticus 10:9-11). Similarly, numerous passages throughout the Prophets and Sacred Writings castigate drunkenness. These are also paralleled in the rabbinic literature, e.g. <i>Sanhedrin</i> 70a, <i>VaYikra Rabbah</i> 12.

Woe to those judges who act with such affront to the Torah of Moses, who disgrace its laws and reduce it to the earth, bring it down to the dust and cause evil to themselves and their descendants in this world and the next.
Most commentaries cite <i>Pesachim</i> 49a as the source for the Rambam's statement, however, that passage does not mention intoxication. The <i>Zohar</i>, Vol. I, 110a, specifically associates drunkenness with the desecration of God's name.

Human Dispositions 5.4,"Although a man's wife is permitted to him at all times, it is fitting that a wise man behave with holiness<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though a Jew's commitment to holiness must encompass every aspect of his behavior, the Torah and our Sages have always emphasized the importance of this quality in regard to sexuality. There is no more powerful expression of man's basic, instinctual nature than sex. Therefore, precisely in this area, a Jew must reveal that his nature is not only material, that he possesses a spiritual dimension that lies at the core of his being and seeks expression.
For this reason, the Jewish marriage bond is referred to as <i>Kiddushin</i>, emphasizing how <i>kedushah</i>, holiness, is a fundamental element in marriage. Similarly, Leviticus 20:7, proclaims ""Sanctify yourselves and be holy, for I am God, your Lord,"" as a preface to the laws proscribing forbidden intimate relations. <i>Sh'vuot</i> 18b interprets the above verse as also including a command to conduct oneself in a holy manner within permitted relationships.
The quality of holiness involves not only restraint, as mentioned in the ensuing statements, but also the manner in which relations are carried out. The Rambam elaborates on this aspect in <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 21:9 and in his commentary to the Mishnah, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 7:4.

In <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 21:11, the Rambam also elaborates on this matter, calling frequent intimate relations a severe blemish and boorish behavior which was frowned upon by the Sages.

Rather, [he should limit his relations to once a week]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Ketubot</i> 62a,b describes the frequency with which people involved in different occupations should engage in intimate relations (See also <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 14:1-4.).

When he speaks - The Rambam quotes this euphemism for intimate relations from <i>Nedarim</i> 20b.
</i>.<br>When he speaks with her, he should not do so at the beginning of the night, when he is sated and his belly [is] full, nor at the end of the night, when he is hungry; rather, in the middle of the night, when his food has been digested<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note Chapter 4, Halachah 19. <i>Iggeret HaKodesh</i> explains that both during the time food is being digested and when a person is hungry, his emotional balance is somewhat disturbed and it is difficult for him to develop the proper attitude and spiritual awareness necessary to make intimate relations a Godly act.
<i>Nedarim</i> 20b emphasizes that the midnight hour also allows a person to rest from all his worldly involvement. The quiet of the hour prevents him from being disturbed by other thoughts and he is able to concentrate on his wife alone.
Despite the advantages of having relations at midnight, many contemporary authorities suggest that a couple not hold to this as a binding rule. If a couple have already begun thinking of sex, they should not be forced to wait until midnight to fulfill their desires.
He should not be excessively lightheaded, - Previously (Chapter 2, Halachah 7), the Rambam cited a mishnah (<i>Avot</i> 3:16) which links lightheadedness and immorality.
</i>.<br>He should not be excessively lightheaded, nor should he talk obscene nonsense even in intimate conversation with his wife<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Chagigah</i> 5b
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though a man should talk to his wife to prepare her for intimacy, he must be careful of what he says. Note the comments of <i>VaYikra Rabbah</i> 24:7.
""And your camp shall be holy, that He see no lewd things in you"" (Deuteronomy 23:15 . The latter refers to unseemly speech. Rav Shmuel bar Nachman said: Lewd speech is obscenity.

</i>.<br>[At the time of relations,] they should not be drunk<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> For intimate relations to be a meaningful act, each of the partners must have all his faculties at his command.
As mentioned in the following halachah, a proper attitude toward intimate relations will cause one to father children who are refined and attractive. The converse is also true. If parents engage in intimate relations in a coarse manner or if there is friction and lack of harmony between them, the children born of their union will have undesirable character traits.
In particular, <i>Nedarim</i> 20b describes ten situations in which relations are forbidden and states that the children born of such unions are endowed with extremely negative tendencies. One of the undesirable states at the time of relations is drunkenness. See also the following halachah and <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 21:12.

<b>Rather, [the relations should take place] amidst their mutual consent and joy. He should converse and dally with her somewhat, -</b> <i>Chagigah</i> 5b describes how the Sage, Rav, would abandon all formalities and inspire an atmosphere of relaxed happiness before intimacy. (Note the description of Rav in Chapter 2, Halachah 4.)
<b>so that she be relaxed. -</b> <i>Iggeret HaKodesh</i> states:
<b>You should motivate her with words that move her heart and settle her mind and make her happy so that your mind will be fused with hers, and your intent with her intent.<br>

<b>He should be intimate [with her] modestly and not boldly, and withdraw [from her] immediately. -</b> The commentaries note that the Rambam's statements are based on the following passage from <i>Nedarim</i> 20b:
They asked Ima Shalom (the wife of Rabbi Eliezer): ""Why are your children so attractive?""<br>
She replied to them: ""He only engages in relations with me... at midnight. During intimacy, he uncovers a handbreadth and covers a handbreadth (i.e., engages in intimacy modestly) and it appears that a demon is pressuring him"" (i.e., he would withdraw after completing the act of intimacy).
</i>, against her will. Rather, [the relations should take place] amidst their mutual consent and joy. He should converse and dally with her somewhat, so that she be relaxed. He should be intimate [with her] modestly and not boldly, and withdraw [from her] immediately."

Human Dispositions 5.6,"Torah Sages conduct themselves with exceptional modesty<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> With this statement, the Rambam establishes a connection with the previous halachah and sets the motif for what follows. Modesty is not simply a matter of dress, (this is discussed in halachah 9), but rather, an awareness of God which causes a person to cover head and body out of respect for the Divine Presence. The Rambam expands upon this concept in the <i>Guide for the Perplexed</i> (Vol. III, Chapter 52):
He is constantly with us, observing us, as [Jeremiah 23:24] proclaims: 'Can a man hide himself in the secret places and I not see him,' says God."" Understand this well.<br>
Know that when perfect men comprehend this, they achieve such humility, such awe and fear of God and a sense of shame before Him... that their private behavior with their wives and in latrines is like their public conduct with other people.<br>
Know that they have forbidden a man to walk with an erect carriage, because: ""the entire world is filled with His glory"" (Isaiah 6:3 ... We are always in His presence... Thus, the greatest among the Sages found it difficult to bare their heads because the Divine Presence constantly hovers over man.
</i>. They do not demean themselves and do not bare their heads<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Kiddushin</i> 30a relates that Rabbi Chiya bar Abba once saw Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi taking his son to school while wearing a makeshift hat. When Rabbi Chiya asked him the reason he was wearing such a head-covering, he explained that he was forced to leave his home in a hurry and was not able to arrange his turban. Nevertheless, he found it preferable to wear even a makeshift head-covering, rather than go out bareheaded.
<i>Kiddushin</i> 31a quotes Rav Huna, the son of Rav Yeshoshua, as explaining that he would not walk four cubits bareheaded out of respect for ""the Divine Presence which is above my head."" (See also <i>Zohar</i>, Vol. III, p. 245b.) Similarly, <i>Shabbat</i> 156b relates that an astrologer told Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak's mother that he was destined to be a thief. From his earliest childhood, she trained him to avoid this fate. She would constantly tell him to cover his head ""so that the fear of God will be upon you.""
</i> or their bodies<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (2:1) lays down the following general rule: Any portion of our bodies which is usually covered should not be revealed unless there is a specific reason for doing so.
Modesty, as understood in the present context, results from the awareness of the Divine Presence. The ordinary man experiences such awareness while at prayer when ""he is as if standing before the Divine Presence"" (<i>Hilchot Tefilah</i> 4:16) and then he is required not to bare his head (ibid. 5:5) or various parts of his body; e.g., his chest (ibid. 4:7) and his feet (ibid. 5:5). As emphasized in Chapter 3, Halachah 3, a wise man should try to be conscious of the Divine Presence at all times and places. As a result, he will constantly be modest.
Though in Talmudic times and in the Rambam's era, personal modesty and covering one's head were considered the signs of a Sage (<i>Kiddushin</i> 8a) and a unique and special merit (<i>Shabbat</i> 118b), at present, both practices have been accepted as ordinary behavior for all observant Jews.
Even when one enters a latrine, he should be modest and not uncover himself until he is seated. - <i>Tamid</i> 27b quotes Rav as giving his son the following advice: ""Sit and reveal yourself. Cover yourself and stand.""
</i>.<br>Even when one enters a latrine, he should be modest and not uncover himself until he is seated. He should not wipe himself clean with the right hand<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Since the right hand is used to tie <i>Tefillin</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 62a) and is given priority over the left hand regarding service in the Temple (<i>Zevachim</i> 24a), the installation ceremony of priests (Leviticus 8:23 , and other ritual manners, it is not proper that it be used for this function.
Many authorities maintain that this restriction only applies when one is cleaning oneself with one's hand alone, but not when one uses toilet paper.
</i>.

Though it is forbidden to delay relieving oneself (<i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 17:31), our Sages did not give this prohibition precedence over the dictates of modesty (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 3:11).
</i>. If<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> no latrine is available and

</i>r for which one is obligated to bring a sin offering if one commits the transgression unknowingly, there are primary categories and [their] derivatives<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 7:2), the Rambam explains that the primary categories are so defined because ""they were part of the work of the Sanctuary, which is termed <i>melachah</i> [the term used for the Torah for forbidden labor]."" The Rambam clarifies the definition of what constitutes a primary category and what constitutes a derivative in Halachot 2-6.
See <i>Yereim</i> (249) who notes that the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Shabbat</i> 7:2) derives the existence of thirty nine categories of work from the exegesis of Exodus 38:2. There is a question if this difference in sources creates a difference in law as well. See also the preface to <i>Eglei Tal,</i> which questions whether the definition of the categories of forbidden labor are taken from the activities necessary for the offering of the sacrifices in the Sanctuary, or merely the activities necessary for construction of the Sanctuary. (In this context, see Rashi, <i>Shabbat</i> 73a, which states that the forbidden labor of baking<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This also includes cooking, roasting, or the like. In the construction of the Sanctuary, cooking was necessary for the preparation of dyes. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 1.)
<b>shearing -</b> This and the following twelve labors are necessary for the preparation of fabric. Shearing involves removing hair or wool from an animal, whether dead or alive. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 7.)
<b>whitening -</b> After the wool is removed from the animal, it is washed to remove dirt. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 10.)
<b>beating -</b> Unlike Rashi and others who interpret as combing the wool, in the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah he translates the word into an Arabic term meaning ""beat it with a stick."" This activity is necessary as a preliminary stage of the preparation of flax to be spun into linen. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 12.)
<b>dyeing -</b> for most of the fabrics used in the curtains and roof-coverings of the Sanctuary were dyed. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 13.)
<b>spinning -</b> intertwining the fibers to make thread. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 15.)
<b>making heddles -</b> The Hebrew, literally means ""house of string."" In the weaving process, it refers to the following practice: Weaving involves passing the threads of the woof over and under each of the consecutive threads of the warp. In order to facilitate this process, two frames are made, each possessing many threads with a loop (referred to as a ""heddle"") in the middle of these threads. The threads of the warp are passed through these loops, one from one frame, and the next from the other, consecutively. When this is completed, the weaver lifts the two frames alternately. As he raises one up, he passes the woof through. In this manner, he is able to thread the woof through the entire warp at one time. (See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Shabbat</i> 7:2; <i>Keilim</i> 21:1.)
<b>mounting the warp -</b> See Chapter 9, Halachah 17-18, where the Rambam describes how a loom is set up. First, the threads of the warp are extended to the desired length and width. They are then attached to a rod on either side, and held taut. This is the activity referred to by this term.
<b>weaving -</b> passing the threads of the woof between the threads of the warp. (See Chapter 9, <i>loc. cit.</i>)
<b>undoing woven fabric -</b> See Chapter 9, Halachah 20.
<b>tying -</b> This refers to a permanent knot whose tying requires professional expertise. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 1.) In the construction of the Sanctuary, the <i>chilazon</i> which were used for dye were caught with nets that had to be tied (<i>Shabbat</i> 74b).
<b>untying -</b> This also includes untying only such knots. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 7.)
<b>sewing -</b> at least two stitches. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 9.)
<b>tearing -</b> in order to sew. Otherwise, one is not liable. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 10.) If a hole was found in one of the curtains of the Sanctuary, it was cut open and sewn close (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 302:4).
<b>building -</b> any structure; similarly, leveling the ground is included in this category. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 12.) The <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> gives as an example, the placement of the boards of the Sanctuary in their sockets.
<b>demolishing -</b> Here also the intent must be a constructive one: demolishing in order to rebuild. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 15.)
<b>beating with a hammer -</b> The <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> points to the fashioning of the <i>menorah</i> in the Sanctuary.
A craftsman finishing the fashioning of a utensil concludes his work by giving several taps with a hammer to smooth the utensil's surface. Thus, this labor also includes all activities performed to apply the finishing touch to an object - e.g., polishing and shining. (See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>loc. cit.,</i> and Chapter 10, Halachah 16.)
<b>trapping -</b> The Mishnah mentions the following seven categories as activities necessary to write a scroll. Leather hides were used to cover the roof of the Sanctuary. (See also Chapter 10, Halachah 19.)
<b>slaughtering -</b> Although this term is usually used to refer to ritual slaughter, the intent here is taking a life through any means. (See Chapter 11, Halachah 1.)
<b>skinning -</b> the hide of an animal to use for leather. (See Chapter 11, Halachah 5.)
<b>processing [hides] -</b> into leather. (See Chapter 11, <i>loc. cit.</i>) Significantly, the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 7:2) also includes salting the hides as a separate category of labor. <i>Shabbat</i> 75b, however, includes this activity in the category of processing hides and includes ruling parchment as the thirty-ninth category of labor.
<b>removing hair -</b> For leather or parchment, smooth skin is required. (See also Chapter 11, Halachah 5, 6.)
<b>cutting [leather] -</b> This refers to making an exact cut, so that the leather can be used for a purpose. Cutting indiscriminately is a destructive activity. Hence, one is not held liable. (See Chapter 11, Halachah 7.)
<b>writing -</b> two letters. This activity was necessary in the Sanctuary, for a mark was made on the boards so that the same boards could be matched to each other each time they were attached together. (See Chapter 11, Halachah 9.)
<b>erasing -</b> For if the builders of the Sanctuary erred in making a sign, they would erase it and write another in its place. In this instance as well, one is held liable only when one erases with the intent of writing two letters in this place. (See Chapter 11, <i>loc. cit.</i>)
<b>ruling lines -</b> For proper writing is possible only on ruled lines. (See Chapter 11, Halachah 17.) In the Sanctuary, this labor was performed to prepare the hides to be cut.
<b>kindling a flame -</b> This was necessary to cook the dyes. As the Rambam explains in Chapter 12, Halachah 1, one is liable for kindling a flame only when when desires to cook with it, use it for light, or desires ash. Otherwise, it is considered a destructive activity.
<b>extinguishing a flame -</b> Here also, one's intent must be constructive - e.g., to use the charcoal produced. In the Sanctuary, this was necessary to produce an even flame for the fashioning of the metal utensils (See Chapter 12, Halachah 2.)
<b>transferring from one domain to another. -</b> All the materials necessary for the construction of the Sanctuary were brought from the private domain to the public domain (<i>Shabbat</i> 96b). This forbidden labor is discussed in great length. (See Chapters 12-19.)

They were necessary to prepare the herbs used as dyes for the curtains of the Sanctuary. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 1.)
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The commentaries question why the Rambam (and his source, <i>Shabbat</i> 7:2, use this expression, rather than merely stating ""thirty-nine."" Some draw attention to the parallel found in the Mishnah's description of the number of lashes given a transgressor (<i>Makkot</i> 3:10). Others explain that this expression indicates that there is a fortieth activity - the spiritual service of prayer and study - which must be performed on the Sabbath day.

1) plowing,<br>
<br>
2) sowing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Significantly, plowing is mentioned before sowing in the Mishnah. <i>Shabbat</i> 73b explains that this was done to teach that if the earth is hard, and it is necessary to re-plow the land after the first plowing, one is liable for the second plowing as well. The Rambam, however, follows the usual order of activities. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 2.)
</i>,<br>3) reaping<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As explained in Chapter 8, Halachah 3, this refers to reaping with a utensil. Severing produce by hand is considered merely a derivative. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 3.)
</i>,<br>4) collecting sheaves<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam mentions that the reapers usually gather the grain in small sheaves. Others follow who collect these sheaves into larger bundles. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 5.)
According to one opinion in <i>Shabbat</i> 96b, there is an explicit reference to the prohibition of this labor on the Sabbath. Numbers, ch. 15, relates that a person was executed for collecting wood on the Sabbath. As the Rambam states Chapter 21, Halachah 11, this labor includes only the collection of produce. Gathering other substances - e.g., salt - is not included. It is, however, forbidden by Rabbinic decree.
</i>,<br>5) threshing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> applying pressure to grain to extract the kernel from its husk. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 7.)
</i>,<br>6) winnowing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> casting the mixture of kernels and husks to the wind. The wind will blow away the chaff, while the kernels that are heavier will fall to the ground.

Nevertheless, because they represent three different activities performed in the construction of the Sanctuary, each one is considered a separate primary category of forbidden labor.

Reading the Shema 3.1,"One who recites the <i>Shema</i> should wash his hands with water<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rabbi Yochanan says: A person who wants to accept upon himself the kingship of Heaven in the most complete fashion should see to his bodily needs, wash his hands, put on <i>tefillin</i>, recite the <i>Shema</i> and pray. Rav Chiyya bar Abba equates this process with the building of the altar and the bringing of sacrifices, based on the verse in Psalms 26:6: ""I wash my hands in innocence and I encompass Your altar, O God"" (<i>Berachot</i> 14a-15a).
</i> before reciting it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is the case even if one's hands are not obviously dirty, because hands tend to touch the covered parts of one's body, and thus, require the washing of hands.
The Rambam holds that a blessing is recited after one washes one's hands before <i>Kri'at</i> Shema. (See <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 6:2.) The requirement to wash our hands upon rising in the morning was established by the Sages as a preparation for <i>Kri'at</i> Shema and the <i>Amidah</i>. A blessing was instituted for this act and, therefore, a blessing is recited every time that one washes his hands before <i>Kri'at</i> Shema or the <i>Amidah</i>. (Rabbenu Asher also shares this position. See his notes to the ninth chapter of <i>Berachot</i>.)
The Rashba explains, however, that the blessing על נטילת ידים was instituted as one of the many blessings that one recites upon rising in the morning (ברכות השחר). In response to receiving anew his soul from Heaven, one is obligated to praise and thank God. In that context, the Sages also instituted the requirement that he sanctify himself for his day's worship, just as the priests in the Temple did - i.e., by washing his hands with water from a vessel. There is, however, no intrinsic connection between the washing of hands, and <i>Kri'at</i> Shema and the <i>Amidah</i>. Therefore, the blessing is recited only in the morning upon rising.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 92:5 and 233:2 agrees with the Rashba and does not require a blessing upon washing hands in preparation for <i>Kri'at</i> Shema and the <i>Amidah</i>. (See also <i>Beit Yosef</i> on <i>Tur Orach Chayim</i> 7, <i>Magen Avraham</i>, the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> on <i>Orach Chayim</i> 4:1, and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Orach Chayim</i> 4:1.)
</i>.<br>If the time for reciting the <i>Shema</i> arrives<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Chapter 1, Halachah 11. According to the Rambam's position, this refers to ten minutes before sunrise. The differing opinions will interpret it to mean that the third hour of the morning will soon pass.
</i> and he cannot find water, he should not delay his recitation in order to search for water<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In contrast, in <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 4:2 and 4:3, the Rambam obligates one to travel a substantial distance (up to 4 kilometers) to find water in order to wash his hands before the <i>Amidah</i>. Rabbenu Manoach explains that, in the latter instance, the law is stricter because there is a longer time during which one may recite the <i>Amidah</i> - until the end of the fourth hour. Hence, we need not worry that he will miss the proper time.
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> adds that we are stricter regarding the time of <i>Kri'at</i> Shema since it is a Torah obligation. Were a person obligated to travel great distances in search of water, he might miss the proper time of <i>Kri'at</i> Shema simply in order to fulfill the Rabbinic ordinance regarding washing his hands.
</i>. Rather, he should clean his hands with earth, a stone, or a beam [of wood]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 15a explains that Psalms 26:6, the verse from which the obligation to wash is derived, does not state ""I wash my hands in water,"" but rather <i>binikayon</i>, in innocence or cleanliness. Thus, anything useful for cleaning the hands may be used, although water is most preferable.
</i> or a similar object, and then recite<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 15a uses the expression “anything that cleans.” Therefore, rough clothing is also useful for this purpose (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>), as is cleaning one's hands by rubbing them against the wall (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 92:6).
</i>."
Reading the Shema 3.2,"One should not recite the <i>Shema</i> in a bathhouse<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> When describing the proper environment for an army camp, Deuteronomy 23:15 states: ""He shall not see any nakedness among you."" Implied is that nakedness, and also a place where people undress even if no naked people are there, is not appropriate for ""God to walk among you."" Hence, neither <i>Shema</i> nor the <i>Amidah</i> can be recited there. See halachot 16-19.
</i> or latrine - even if there is no fecal material in it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 26a and <i>Shabbat</i> 10a explain that even without the presence of fecal matter, a latrine is not a fit place for prayer.
</i> - nor in a graveyard or next to a corpse<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 18a. Proverbs 17:5 states: ""The one who mocks the poor (<i>rash</i>) reproaches his Creator."" The Talmud also explains that this term also refers to the dead and derives many halachot regarding conduct in the presence of a corpse from this verse. It is forbidden to wear <i>tefillin</i> or carry a Torah scroll in a graveyard, since one would, in a certain sense, be mocking the dead, who are unable to perform mitzvot. This is the case regarding <i>Kri'at</i> Shema also.
</i>. If he distances himself four cubits from the grave or the corpse, he is permitted to recite it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sotah</i> 43b teaches us that a corpse ""occupies"" a space of four cubits regarding <i>Kri'at</i> Shema.
</i>. Anyone who recites in an improper place must recite the <i>Shema</i> again<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam's position is based on the notion of קנסוהו רבנן i.e., that the Rabbis disallowed the <i>Kri'at</i> Shema even in a case where one was unaware of the impropriety of the place, so that people would exercise greater care in this matter.
The Ra'avad differs with one aspect of the Rambam's decision. He maintains that although it is certainly forbidden to read the <i>Shema</i> in the presence of a corpse or in a graveyard, the violation of this prohibition does not override the fact that one did recite the <i>Shema</i>. Therefore, he need not repeat it. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 71:7, agrees with the Rambam. (See the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> also.)

Reading the Shema 3.3,"The <i>Shema</i> may be recited facing, but not inside, a latrine that has been newly built, but not used as of yet. [I<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rav Adda bar Ahava states: ""One may pray in a bathhouse."" The Talmud explains that he was referring to a new bathhouse. Rashi explains that this means that it has been designated as such but no one has ever bathed there (<i>Shabbat</i> 10a).
The Sages felt the stigma attached to a bathhouse was not as severe as that attached to a latrine and hence, were more lenient.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The designation alone of a building for such a purpose attaches a stigma to it such that it is unfit for the <i>Shema</i> to be recited inside it.
<i>Shabbat</i> 10a raises the question of praying in such a building and does not resolve the issue. The Ra'avad therefore disagrees with the Rambam and feels that such a doubt should be dealt with leniently - i.e., that we should allow one to pray inside such a building.
</i>n contrast,] the <i>Shema</i> may be recited in a new bathhouse.<br>In the case of two buildings, one of which was designated for use as a latrine and, concerning the other, the owner said: ""And this..."" - a doubt remains regarding the latter: whether it also was appropriated for a similar use or not<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Nedarim</i> 7a mentions this case within the context of the Talmudic concept of <i>yad</i> (“a handle”) of a vow or other significant utterance. This term refers to expressions that are not completely self-explanatory and leave room for doubt. Just as the handle of a cup is not the essential part of the cup, and yet when one grabs the handle the whole cup itself follows, so, too, a statement can be made which in itself is incomplete or unclear, but seems to contain within it an intimation of a complete idea. In our case, it is unclear whether the word וזה refers also to a latrine or to another idea altogether.
</i>.<br>Therefore, one should not deliberately recite the <i>Shema</i> there<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> since perhaps the expression וזה does indeed make it appear as if he actually said the word ""latrine.""
</i>. However, after the fact, if he recited it there, he has fulfilled his obligation<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rav explains that this is based on the idea of ספק דרבנן לקולא (that a doubt concerning a rabbinic ordinance is dealt with leniently).
</i>.<br>If the owner said: ""Also this,"" both have been designated for this use, and the <i>Shema</i> may not be recited in them.<br>I<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In contrast to the previous cases in this halachah, this applies to the courtyard of a bathhouse which is being used.

</i>t is permissible to recite the <i>Shema</i> in the courtyard of the bathhouse, i.e., the place where people stand clothed.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Shabbat</i> 10a distinguishes between the middle room where some people are clothed and others naked, and the courtyard of the bathhouse, where everyone is clothed. Only there, in the courtyard, is one permitted to recite the <i>Shema</i>.In the middle room one is prohibited from reciting <i>Kriat</i> Shema even if there are no naked people there at the time (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav Orach Chayim</i> 84:1).

The Talmud then asks how he could have done such a thing, since such thought is forbidden. They explain that a state that is unavoidable (<i>anus</i> is different.
Rashi explains that Rabbi Elazar was so immersed in his Torah study that he thought about it even against his will. Rabbenu Manoach quotes the Ra'avad as saying that in such a case, thoughts of Torah are permitted when at the latrine. <i>Sefer Chassidim</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>.) advises that people should force themselves to think of mundane matters in order to avoid thoughts of Torah in unclean places. (See <i>Magen Avraham, Orach Chayim</i> 85.)

Reading the Shema 3.5,"Secular matters may be discussed in a latrine, even in Hebrew<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 85) quotes <i>Sefer Chassidim</i> (994) which states that one should accustom oneself to act piously and not speak Hebrew at the latrine.

The Ra'avad disagrees with the Rambam and states that since this attribute is used as a name only in relation to God, it may not be uttered in the latrine. Rabbenu Yonah quotes Psalms 112:4 as a source that uses the term רחום in relation to a righteous person, thereby refuting the Ra'avad.

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> expresses surprise at the exclusion of the term שלום. <i>Shabbat</i> 10b explicitly mentions it as forbidden to be uttered in the bathhouse - all the more so at the latrine - since it is specifically used as a name of God (Judges 6:24 . The <i>Magen Avraham (Orach Chayim</i> 95) also forbids the utterance of שלום in such places.

One prohibits the <i>Shema</i> to be read near the excrement of dogs and pigs, and the other prohibits <i>Kri'at</i> Shema in the presence of these excrements only when skins are soaking in them. Ravvah prefers the second source, and the Rambam decides halachah in accordance with Ravvah's position.
Rashi explains that the idea of soaking skins applies only to the excrement of dogs and pigs, since it is a common practice to soak skins in them, but not to human feces, which is not used for such a purpose.

In terms of modern measurements, this olive size would be between 16.6 and 24 grams, according to various Halachic opinions.
<i>Tosefot</i> (<i>Chullin</i> 103a) differs, and defines a 18תיזכ (the size of an olive) as one half the size of an egg (between 25.6 and 36 grams according to the various opinions).

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Talmud on which the Rambam based his decision most probably mentioned donkey dung (as mentioned in the previous comment) and not donkey urine. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 79:6 reflects the position of the Ra'avad.
Rabbenu Asher points out that the Rambam mentions animal urine alone as not being problematic, thereby indicating that animal dung (e.g., cow or horse excrement) would be problematic. Rabbenu Asher himself sees no room to prohibit animal dung, since it is never mentioned in the Talmud as problematic. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> holds that the Rambam's position is that animal dung is prohibited only if its smell causes discomfort, and that the extent of this discomfort is somewhat subjective. Therefore, the Rambam did not mention it explicitly.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 79:4 rules in accordance with this understanding of the Rambam. (This is not surprising, since the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> were both written by Rav Yosef Karo.)
</i>ne need not distance oneself from the feces or urine of a child unable to eat the weight of an olive of grain cereal<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There are five types of grain cereal - wheat, barley, oats, spelt and rye (See <i>Hilchot Chametz U'Matzah</i> 5:1).
</i>, in the time in which an adult could eat an amount equivalent to the weight of three eggs<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This measure (אכילת פרס in Hebrew) is significant in halachah. Just as the Torah requires a specific quantity, the size of an olive, as regards many of the mitzvot and prohibitions concerning eating, it also specifies a limited period in which this amount of food must be consumed: 18ידכ סרפáתליכא - the time it takes to eat this measure.
This measure is also a point of Rabbinic controversy. Here and in <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 14:8, the Rambam defines 18תליכא סרפ as three eggs. Rashi (<i>Pesachim</i> 44a) takes a more lenient view, defining it as four eggs.
This halachah is based on the principle that it is unnecessary to distance oneself from a child's feces or urine which does not have a foul odor. Thus while a child's sole source of nourishment is nursing, there is no prohibition. However, grains emit a foul odor after being digested (Rashi on <i>Succah</i> 42b). Therefore, once the child begins eating them, the <i>Shema</i> may not be recited in the soiled child's presence.

The Rambam equates ""its being at the side"" with ""behind him."" The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> suggests that this only applies when it is impossible to move in front of the feces. However, if he is able to walk in front of them, he must. Nevertheless, the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 79:1 states simply that ""to its being at the side"" is equated with ""behind him.""
The <i>Magen Avraham</i> quotes the statement of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and mentions that if the feces were at his side and slightly in front of him, they would be considered as if they were in front. Therefore, one would be required to move until they were out of sight.

Hence, the Rambam associates the two halachot.
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> mentions that, based on the Rambam's position, one should be careful not to recite the <i>Shema</i> or pray in a house with a foul odor, even if the odor is emanating from a different house. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 79:2 quotes this, but also mentions the positions of Rabbenu Yonah and Rabbenu Asher, that a separation is sufficient even if an odor remains.
The <i>Magen Avraham</i> suggests that it is best to be strict in such a case. However, he grants one leniency. Generally, one must distance oneself from an odor even if he himself cannot smell it. However, in this instance, a lack of smell would be enough to permit the reading of the <i>Shema</i>.

Rabbenu Asher explains that this applies when there is actual substance on the person's skin, but it is covered by his clothing. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 76:4 reflects the understanding of Rabbenu Asher. However, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> favors the Rambam's position.

The Rambam explains that this applies if there is any contact between the shoe and the feces. However, the Ra'avad maintains that this only applies when the feces are actually stuck to the shoe. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>.) 76:2 supports the Rambam's position.

The Rambam holds that the halachah follows Rav Huna. In the previous halachah, the Rambam also supported Rav Huna's position, since Rav Chisda was a student of Rav Huna and thus, of lesser stature.

Reading the Shema 3.13,"It is forbidden to recite the <i>Shema</i> while facing moving excreta<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Some <i>Rishonim</i> distinguish between moving feces and a stationary substance since in the former case, the feces will continue to proceed further. This would appear to be the Rambam's opinion as obvious from the contrast between a stationary substance emitting a foul odor where we are required to distance ourselves until it is out of sight (Halachah 8) and this Halachah.
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that there is no Talmudic source for this distinction. Therefore, he explains that there is no difference between stationary and moving feces and that this halachah only applies to feces which are behind one. If the feces are in front of one, the <i>Shema</i> cannot be recited until they move out of sight.
In the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 76:2, Rav Yosef Karo follows his explanation in the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>. However, the <i>Bach</i> and the <i>Magen Avraham</i> (76:2) make the distinction between moving and stationary feces.

[The Babylonian Talmud is so full of disagreements between these two Torah scholars that it is called the book of the arguments between Ravvah and Abbaye. Among all these arguments, the halachah reflects Abbaye's position only six times. Here, also, the halachah is in line with Ravvah's opinion.]

The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> both explain that in this case, the Rambam supports the position of Rav Chisda over that of Rav Huna (as opposed to Halachot 12 and 13), because many other sages of the Gemara also accept the opinion of Rav Chisda.

Therefore, one is obligated to stop if he remains. In contrast, a person studying Torah needs his books and therefore, cannot continue studying if he leaves the room. Accordingly, he need not interrupt his studies.
This also explains the distinction between his own gas and that of a colleague. In the case of his gas, a person may leave for a moment and then return, but as the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 79:9 explains, we will not obligate a whole study hall to stop studying because of the gas of a few. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 79:11) adds that this is considered as a factor beyond one's control, and, therefore, does not require the interruption of study.
The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (79:15) mentions that perhaps, if a person was studying alone and could leave the room in order to avoid the foul odor, he should do so. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>, however, makes no such distinction and also allows one to continue studying.

With regard to what? With regard to gazing at it. Behold, Rav Sheshet says that anyone who stares even at the little finger of a woman is like one staring at her most private parts. Rather, it refers to his wife and to <i>Kri'at</i> Shema.
Rashi interprets this to mean that a man may not recite the <i>Shema</i> next to his wife if a handbreadth of her body is uncovered. Rabbenu Asher explains that this refers to any part of his wife's body that is usually covered and clothed.
<i>Berachot</i> also mentions a woman's hair and her voice as <i>ervah</i>.
The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> interprets this passage to mean that since these restrictions were established with respect to one's wife, any part of the body of a woman other than his wife would be problematic. Thus, the <i>Shema</i> should not be recited in her presence.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 75:1 does not distinguish between a man's wife and another woman and forbids the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> if a handbreadth of their bodies which is usually covered is uncovered.

<i>Berachot</i> 25b reports a disagreement as to whether a heel may ""see"" or touch ערוה, and rules that though the heel may see ערוה, it cannot touch it. The rationale for this distinction is that the Torah was not given to angels. Rashi explains that this implies that we cannot be expected to maintain such a formidable level of care, because we were created with physical nakedness against our wills.
Rabbenu Asher and Rabbenu Yonah suggest that no part of the body may touch one's genitalia during <i>Kri'at</i> Shema, and that the heel is given only as an example. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 74:5 accepts this position.

The Rambam and the vast majority of <i>Rishonim</i> follow the second position, because the first opinion does not take into account the rule “One's heart shall not see his nakedness.” If one is sleeping with no clothes on, he may separate the top half of his body from the lower half.

It is interesting to note that there is a clear dispute between the great rabbis of Spain and North Africa (Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi, the Rambam and their disciples) and the great rabbis of Germany and France (<i>Tosafot</i>, Rabbenu Asher, and their disciples) concerning this halachah.
The Rabbis of France rule that even when sleeping in the same bed as one's wife one must make a separation with the sheet before reciting the <i>Shema</i>. Rabbi Yitzchak explains that the halachah is not according to either Shmuel or Rav Yosef and it is reasonable to be particularly strict based on a <i>beraitot</i> quoted in the <i>Berachot</i> 24a. In contrast, the Rabbis of Spain follow the Rambam's view.
Generally, in such instances, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> will rule in accordance with the Rabbis of Spain, and the Ramah with the Rabbis of France. In this instance, the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 73:2, after quoting both positions, suggests that it is fitting to follow the ruling of the Rabbis of France.

Both agree (as the Rambam states later in this halachah) that when sleeping in the same bed with his wife, one need only turn his face away from her in order to recite the <i>Shema</i>. However, Shmuel is of the opinion that this same halachah applies even if he were sleeping with a person other than his wife, while Rav Yosef feels that this dispensation is only granted in regard to one's wife.

Hence, he also includes in this work the text of all necessary prayers and legal documents.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The main body of the Haggadah was composed early in our nation's history. Some authorities attribute it to the <i>Anshei Knesset HaGedolah</i>, who composed it together with the other prayers and blessings they authored. Large portions of the Haggadah are found verbatim in the Mishnah, <i>Pesachim</i>, Chapter Ten, and reference is made there to other sections that are not explicitly quoted.
However, as obvious from the discussion in that chapter, the precise text of the Haggadah was a matter of debate and question throughout the Talmudic period. A few centuries after the completion of the Talmud, Rav Amram Gaon composed a text of the Haggadah that was accepted internationally, throughout all Jewish communities. Approximately sixty years later, his successor, Rav Saadia Gaon, composed a Haggadah with some changes and emendations. These two texts served as the <sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The use of the word מקום as a name for God is based on <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 68:9: ""He is the place of the world and the world is not His place.""
<b>who has given the Torah to Israel; blessed be He --</b> Our text of the Haggadah employs a slightly different version, mentioning four expressions of blessing to parallel the four sons.
<b>The Torah speaks of four sons --</b> This passage is found with certain emendations in the Jerusalem Talmud and in the Mechiltah.
<b>that God, our Lord, has commanded you --</b> Both the aforementioned sources state ""has commanded us,"" preventing comparison between the wise and wicked sons. Nevertheless, the Rambam (as well as Rav Amram Gaon and Rav Saadia Gaon) found it more appropriate to quote the verse from the Torah verbatim.
<b>reply to him, [teaching him] the laws of Pesach... --</b> Our text of the Jerusalem Talmud includes this as the answer to the simple son. Other commentaries (See <i>P'nei David, Simchat HaRegel</i>) give this as the answer to the wicked son.
<b>dessert --</b> The literal meaning of the Greek word <i>afikoman</i>--see the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah, <b>Pesachim</b> 10:8.
<b>you should blunt his teeth and tell him...-</b> Exodus 12:27 states that the question asked by the wicked son should be answered differently: ""It is the Passover service to God..."" The <i>Zevach Pesach</i> explains that the Haggadah implies, in addition to the reply given in the Torah, that he be reprimanded strongly, ""blunt his teeth...""
<b>The simple son --</b> the Jerusalem Talmud uses the expression: ""the foolish son.""
<b>""You shall tell your son on that day."" --</b> This verse, both the answer to the son who does not know how to ask and the source for the mitzvah to relate the story of the Exodus, serves as a transition between the passage of the four sons and the narrative of our redemption. (See also Halachah 7:1.)
<b>""it is because of this."" --</b> The word זה (this) is always used to refer to a clearly visible entity, as <i>Menachot</i> 29a comments on Exodus 12:2. Similarly, in this context, ""this"" refers to a situation where symbols of the Exodus, the matzah and the maror, are visibly present before us.
<b>In the beginning, our ancestors were worshipers of other gods --</b> <i>Pesachim</i> 115a quotes this passage as reflecting the principle that the narrative of the Exodus must begin by relating our people's roots. (See Halachah 7:4.) It must be noted that the Rambam chooses slightly different phraseology from that employed in other Haggadot.
<b>Blessed be He Who keeps His promise to Israel --</b> This passage is found in the Haggadot of Rav Amram Gaon and Rav Saadia Gaon. However, its origins are unknown.
<b>the Holy One, blessed be He, calculated the end of [our bondage] --</b> i.e. counting the 400 years of oppression from the birth of Isaac, for during that entire time, the Jews were ""strangers in a land that is not their own."" The Egyptian exile itself lasted only 210 years. See Rashi, Exodus 12:40.
<b>""An Aramean sought to destroy my father..."" --</b> This and the verses that follow are part of the וידוי ביכורים recited when the Jews would bring their first fruits to Jerusalem. <i>Pesachim</i> 116a requires the person reciting the Haggadah to ""expound from 'An Aramean sought to destroy my father' until he completes the entire passage."" This implies that the exegesis of the verses found in the Haggadah was already extant at that time.
The commentaries quote the <i>Sifri</i> as the source for these interpretations though our text of the <i>Sifri</i> contains only portions of this passage. [The passage is found in the <i>Mechiltah d'Rashbi</i> in its entirety. However, some authorities maintain that it was a later addition.] Nevertheless, other early collections of Midrashim, such as <i>Lekach Tov, Midrash HaGadol,</i> and the <i>Yalkut Shimoni</i>, include the complete text.
<b>""I made you as numerous as the plants of the field..."" --</b> Though the verse has no explicit connection to the Exodus, the commentaries explain that it describes the situation of the Jews in Egypt in metaphoric terms.
Many texts of the Haggadah also include the previous verse from Ezekiel: ""And when I passed by you, I saw you weltering in your blood..."" Rav Ya'akov Emden relates that he and his father, the <i>Chacham Tzvi</i>, would recite this verse even though he did not find it in other texts. (His statement is slightly questionable. There are some earlier texts of the Haggadah, such as <i>Siddur HaAri zal</i>, which do include it.)
<b>""I will pass through... and I will slay... I will execute... I, God."" --</b> Our text of the Haggadah contains a further elaboration of this verse, showing how each use of the word ""I"" is intended to exclude God's use of an intermediary to execute judgement.
<b>Rabbi Yehudah coined abbreviations for them: detzach, adash, b'achav. --</b> This concludes the exegesis of the verses of the וידוי ביכורים in the <i>Sifri</i>.
Our Haggadot (and similarly, those of Rav Amram Gaon and Rav Saadia Gaon) continue with a number of other passages:
a) Statements by Rabbi Yossi HaG'lili, Rabbi Eliezer, and Rabbi Akiva concerning the number of plagues with which the Egyptians were punished;
b) Passages recounting the extent of God's generosity to the Jewish people.
The first group of statements have their source in the <i>Mechiltah</i>. Rav Avraham, the Rambam's son, relates that his father did not include them in his text of the Haggadah because they were not popularly known. Nevertheless, it was his custom to recite them at the Seder.
The source for the second grouping of passages is less clear. They are not explicitly found in any Midrash.
<b>Rabban Gamliel would say --</b> This passage and the remaining passages until the blessing, <i>asher ge'alanu</i>, are explicitly mentioned in the Mishnah, <i>Pesachim</i> 116a,b. (See also Halachot 7:5, 8:4 and the commentary, which mentions the change in the order there.)
<b>has not fulfilled his obligation --</b> to relate the story of the Exodus. See Halachah 7:5.
<b>In every generation --</b> This passage is found in <b>Pesachim</b> 116b. However, in contrast to the Talmud and our text of the Haggadah, the Rambam's text omits quoting Exodus 13:8: ""And you shall tell your son..."" Apparently, the Rambam had a different text of the Mishnah, which omitted this verse. This difference in texts is also the source for the Rambam's statements, Halachah 7:6: ""In every generation, a person is obligated to present himself..."" See the commentary on that halachah.
<b>He brought us out from there --</b> Ravvah, <i>Pesachim</i>, ibid., requires reciting this verse.
<b>Therefore, we are obliged to thank, praise, laud, glorify, exalt, magnify, adore, and give eternal praise --</b> With slight textual differences, this entire passage is found in <i>Pesachim</i> 116b. (See also Halachah 8:5).
<b>Halleluyah! Servants of God,... [one continues reciting the Psalms] until...</b> the flintstone into a stream of water — The Hallel was recited both while slaughtering the Paschal sacrifice and while eating it. To commemorate the latter recitation, we recite the Hallel at the Seder.
We divide the Hallel into two portions (see <i>Pesachim</i>, ibid. and Halachah 8:5):
the first, containing Psalms referring to the Exodus from Egypt, we recite before the meal;
the second, containing Psalms referring to the Messianic redemption (see <i>Pesachim</i> 118a), is recited after the meal.
<b>Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who redeemed us and redeemed our ancestors... --</b> This blessing is quoted from <i>Pesachim</i> 116b. The first portion was also recited while the Temple was standing.
<b>So too, God, our Lord and Lord of our fathers, enable us to reach --</b>This portion of the blessing, composed by Rabbi Akiva, represents a prayer for our redemption and the rebuilding of the Temple. (See <i>Pesachim</i>, ibid., Halachah 8:5.)
<b>other festivals --</b> The word ""other"" can also imply ""of a different nature""--i.e., we pray for the Messianic redemption, when our festivals will be of an entirely different nature.
<b>we shall eat of the sacrifices --</b> the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering
<b>and of the Paschal offerings --</b> The <i>Chaggigah</i> offering was not sacrificed when Pesach began on Saturday night. Accordingly, it is our custom to reverse the order of these sacrifices on such an occasion. However, the Rambam does not mention such a practice.
<b>Then, we shall sing a new song for our redemption --</b> The <i>Mechiltah</i> (see also <i>Tosefot, Pesachim</i>, ibid.) notes that the Bible mentions nine songs sang by the Jewish people as a collective entity. In each case, the Hebrew for song, שירה, is used in the feminine gender, for our redemption was not complete. In contrast, the song to be sung to greet Mashiach will be a
שיר חדש, a new song. The masculine gender is used because the Messianic redemption will represent the complete and ultimate liberation of our people. May it come speedily in our days.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This phrase is not mentioned in our text of the Haggadah. Its inclusion answers a question frequently raised: Why does the Haggadah mention this concept, which deals with the mitzvah to recall the Exodus from Egypt each day, on the Seder night? The recollection of the Exodus at the Seder is of a different nature entirely.
However, this addition clarifies the issue: This was one of the subjects discussed by the Sages in Bnei Brak.

In contrast to the rest of the Haggadah, this passage is recited in Aramaic. Among the explanations for this practice are:
a) This enabled the passage to be understood by all participants, since Aramaic was the common language of the time (<i>Tosefot Rid, Manhig</i>). Accordingly, the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 473:6) relates that he would translate the passage into Yiddish at his Seder.
b) The angels do not understand Aramaic, and hence they will not accuse us of being unworthy of redemption (Ritbah).
c) The demons do not understand Aramaic, and thus they will not accept our invitation to the Seder (Rashi, <i>HaPardes</i>). This reason is questioned, because Pesach is a ליל שימורים (a protected night), on which the demons have no power to harm a Jew.

The hypothesis that the obligation lies on the child is supported by Halachah 16, which states that a child may fulfill the obligation of grace for a person who did not eat to the point of satisfaction (and, therefore, is obligated to recite grace only by Rabbinic decree). Were the Sages to have placed the obligation to educate the child on his father and not on the child himself, the child would not be able to fulfill the mitzvah on behalf of another person.
Nevertheless, it is possible to explain that the Sages placed the obligation on the father. This obligation, however, encompasses the child and, hence, causes him to be considered as obligated in the mitzvah (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 17).

In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 7:1, based on <i>Berachot</i> 47b), the Rambam states that this refers to a gentile who has already made a decision to convert and has been circumcised for that reason. Nevertheless, if he has not immersed himself in the mikveh, he is not considered a Jew, and may not be included in a <i>zimmun</i>.<br>
14. This ruling is not accepted by many other authorities, including Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi and Rabbenu Asher. Because of the difference of opinion, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 197:3) rules that, at the outset, an attempt should be made to follow the Rambam's decision. If, however, the third person does not desire to eat bread, he may be included in the <i>zimmun</i> as long as he partook of a<i>k'zayit</i> of other foods.<br>
15. The commentaries note that the Rambam does not quote <i>Berachot</i> 48a (the source for this halachah) exactly. The Talmud states ""dipped his food in brine with them."" The Rambam's choice of phraseology is particularly difficult since, as the Rambam himself writes in <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i> 2:5, brine is generally not eaten alone as a food.<br>
16. The commentaries have noted the apparent redundancy in the Rambam's expressions. The <i>Kol ben Levi</i> offers a possible resolution, explaining that, in the opening clause, the Rambam states that these people are not required to make a <i>zimmun</i>. In the final clause, he states that they are not allowed to do so.<br>
 17. <i>Tosafot, Berachot</i> 47a, writes that if they have already decided to recite grace, the third person may not be included in a<i>zimmun</i> with them. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 197:1) accepts this ruling.<br>
18. According to the Rambam's opinion mentioned in the previous halachah, the third person must partake of bread. According to the other opinions mentioned above, if the third person partakes of other foods, the first two may include him in a <i>zimmun</i>.<br>
19. <i>Berachot</i> 47a relates that Rav Simai bar Chiyya joined Rav and Shemuel in a meal after the latter had completed eating. They ate another side dish together with him, and then recited the <i>zimmun</i>.<br>
20. Note the <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 197, which states that they are obligated to recite the <i>zimmun</i>.<br>
21. He may, however, convey this privilege on another person if he desires (<i>Tosafot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>; <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 201:1).
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions that if a guest is present, he should be given the privilege of reciting the<i>zimmun</i>, so that he will be able to recite a blessing for the host, as mentioned in Chapter 2, Halachah 7.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:2) also mentions that a priest who is a Torah sage should be given the privilege of reciting the <i>zimmun</i>. (See <i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i> 4:2 and <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 12:18.)
22. Although a sufficient number of people to recite grace with a<i>zimmun</i> will remain, each individual is personally obligated to participate in the <i>zimmun</i> and may not recite grace alone.<br>
23. Enough people remain in each group to allow them both to recite grace with a <i>zimmun</i>. There is, however, no obligation to separate. If the people desire, they may recite grace in a single group (Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 193:1).<br>
24. Until there are twenty people, separation will prevent - at the very least - the people who separate from reciting grace with God's name.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 193:1, based on<i>Berachot</i> 50a) states that, at a meal attended by many people, if there is a difficulty or inconvenience preventing an individual from participating in the <i>zimmun</i> in which God's name is mentioned, he may recite grace with a <i>zimmun</i> of three.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Magen Avraham</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>, explains why such a decision is granted with regard to a <i>zimmun</i> and not with regard to <i>kaddish, barchu, kedushah</i>, and the like. The latter prayers are obligations incumbent on a person each day, and may be fulfilled only with a quorum of adult men. In contrast, since each person may fulfill his obligation to recite grace without a <i>zimmun</i>, leniencies were granted in counting the people included.
Rabbenu Asher and the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 199:10) do not accept this distinction, and rule that a child may not be counted in a <i>zimun</i> until he is thirteen years of age and has exhibited signs of physical maturity.

Blessings 5.11,"When three people who each came<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> It is possible to explain that this is referring to three individuals who each began eating with a separate group in the same large room. Afterwards, they joined together and ate at the same table.
Alternatively, the halachah is speaking about three groups that ate on the same table, and one remained from each group (<i>Merchevat HaMishneh</i>), or the three individuals came from different groups, but left their original group inadvertently or because of forces beyond their control (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 193:25).

</i> [join together]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> even when they themselves do not eat together (<i>loc. cit.</i>). According to the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, this applies when they eat together. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 193:5) states that, in either instance, the following law applies.
</i>, they should not separate [without reciting grace with a <i>zimmun</i>]. I<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., although they desired to continue eating, they responded to the<i>zimmun</i> and listened to the first blessing of grace (<i>Tosafot,</i> <i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>; Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 200:1)
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Ideally, they should not have separated from their first company. See the <i>Rishon LeTzion</i>; Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 193:6). After the fact, since they all have still not recited grace and are all obligated to participate in a <i>zimmun</i>, they should do so.

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This expression implies a different concept. If a fourth person joined the two remaining in the original group and a <i>zimmun</i> was recited, the obligation of a <i>zimmun</i> is no longer incumbent on the person who left the group. Therefore, a <i>zimmun</i> may not be recited in the new group of three (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 193:6).
If the three people in the new group eat together as a company, they may recite a <i>zimmun</i> (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 193:33).
</i>hen three people sit down [together] to eat bread, they may not separate even though each person eats from his own food<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> It is the intent to sit down together at a single table that establishes them as a company, and not the fact that they share food.
25. This halachah describes a large feast, at which many people eat at different tables. Nevertheless, they all came together for the same purpose, and thus are considered a single group. (See the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 7:5; and <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 195:2).
In contrast, in a restaurant, although many people eat in the same room, since they did not come with the intention of eating together, they are considered as a single group. 26. The Rambam is quoting the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 7:5). Rabbenu Asher and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 195:1) state that the same principles apply if the feast is held in two separate rooms (or houses), as long as they are not separated by a street.<br>
27. Similarly, if a single group is large enough to prevent the words of the blessings from being heard, people should recite the <i>zimmun</i> in smaller groups (<i>Kessef Mishneh; Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 193:1).<br>
 28. He must also respond (<i>Berachot</i> 45b; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 194:6).<br>
29. He fulfills his obligation for <i>zimmun</i>, but not for grace.<br>
30. It is only proper that God's name be mentioned when the ten people are in the same room (<i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>).<br>
 31. If, however, two people from a group of three recite grace alone, a <i>zimmun</i> may not be recited (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 194:1).<br>
32. The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 194:1) states that this law only applies when the individual has not answered to a <i>zimmun</i> previously. If, however, he answered to the <i>zimmun</i> of a previous group, he may not be included in this <i>zimmun</i>.<br>
33. He should respond as usual.<br>
34. <i>Zimmun</i> should precede grace. Once a person has recited grace, he can no longer fulfill his obligation for <i>zimmun</i>

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.1,"In the days of Rabban Gamliel<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The commentaries question which Rabban Gamliel the Rambam refers to. <i>Seder Hadorot</i> points to Rabban Gamliel, the elder, grandson of Hillel the Elder, who lived in the first half of the first century of the Common Era. <i>Dorot Harishonim</i>, however, believes this to refer to the latter's grandson, who headed the Rabbinical court in Yavneh from 80 CE, after it was established there by Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai following the destruction of the Second Temple.
</i>, the numbers of heretics among the Jews increased<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:8, the Rambam describes a heretic (<i>apikoros</i>) as one who denies the notion of prophecy or the idea that knowledge could be transmitted from the Creator to human beings, one who refutes the prophecy of Moshe Rabbenu, or one who denies God's omniscience regarding the actions of human beings.
Some manuscript editions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> use the word <i>min</i> (non-believer) instead of <i>apikoros</i>. In <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:7, the Rambam describes the <i>min</i> as one who does not believe in God, whereas the heretic denies not God, but Torah.
Historically, this could refer to the Saducees and other Jews with assimilationist tendencies that began to multiply at this time. Though they were definitely a minority among the people, their number was signficant enough to warrant concern. Others interpret this as a reference to the early Christians who launched many missionary campaigns to attract the Jews.

Since he saw this as the greatest need of the people, - for the devotion to Torah is the backbone of our people's continuity
</i>.<br>Since he saw this as the greatest need of the people, he and his court established one blessing that contains a request to God to destroy the heretics. He inserted it into the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> so that it would be arranged in the mouths of all. C<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
<i>Olat Re'iah</i> explains why this Sage was chosen: All of our great and wise Sages were able to compose the other blessings of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> which are full of love and giving. The blessing of the heretics differs for it appears full of hate and destruction.
The composition of this blessing required great care, since the content must not imply the hatred of people per se, but a righteous indignation, born out of love for God and the pain felt when His Majesty is not honored. Shmuel HaKatan authored the famous statement: ""Refrain from joy at the fall of your enemies"" (<i>Pirkei Avot</i> 4:19). Thus, he was most worthy to author this blessing. His zealousness bore no trace whatsoever of hate, but was a true reflection of his unbounded love for God and His Torah.
Consequently, there are nineteen blessings in the Shemoneh Esreh. - We do, however, still call the prayer the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, based on its original eighteen blessings.

Rabbi Akiva says that if the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> is fluent in his mouth he should recite all eighteen blessings; and if not, the abbreviated version of the eighteen blessings.

The Zohar explains that all blessing and bounty enters the world through <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and from there it is apportioned to the rest of the world. Jerusalem and the Holy Temple serve as the repositories for Divine grace and act as the meeting point between Heaven - the source of the bounty - and earth, the recipient of this blessing.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.4,"When does the above apply? In the summer<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Only then, may one recite the abbreviated version of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> mentioned in the above two halachot.

</i>...,"" since he must mention ""the petition<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for dew and rain that is included...
</i>"" in the blessing for material wealth<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This petition is recited only in the winter as explained in Halachot 16 and 17. The omission of this petition would render the abbreviated <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> incomplete.
<i>Berachot</i> 29a suggests that perhaps the petition for dew and rain could be added to the abbreviated version of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> at the appropriate time of year, but rejects this idea. Because of the infrequency with which one would normally recite this blessing, any change in the text would confuse people and result in errors.
</i>.<br>Similarly, on Saturday nights and the nights after a holiday, one should not recite ""Give us knowledge...,"" since one must say <i>Havdalah</i> in [the blessing of] the One who bestows knowledge.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> to differentiate between the previous holy day and the upcoming day. This prayer is added in the first intermediate blessing of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>: חונן הדעת (""the One who bestows knowledge"") as explained in Halachah 12.
<i>Berachot</i> 29a also suggests adding the <i>Havdalah</i> prayer in the abbreviated summary of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, distinguishing between the inclusion of <i>Havdalah</i> and the petition for rain, which could not be mentioned in the abbreviated version of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> as explained above.
They explain that <i>Havdalah</i> is recited in the first of the intermediate blessings and would therefore be easy to remember and not cause errors, whereas the petition for rain is in the middle, when concentration is more difficult.
The question is left unresolved in the Talmud and therefore, some authorities allow it to be included in the abbreviated version. However, most do not. Rabbenu Yonah explains that it is omitted because its mention would create the impression that <i>Havdalah</i> was a blessing in its own right, just as all the other statements in this version of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> are shortened versions of individual blessings.

On the festivals, he concludes with ""who sanctifies Israel and the appointed times<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As opposed to the conclusion of the blessing on Sabbath, the blessing of the holidays first mentions the sanctification of Israel and then of the specific time. The sanctification of the holidays is determined by the Jewish people since the exact date of each festival is based on the establishment of Rosh Chodesh (the first day of the month) of that particular month.
In <i>Hilchot Kiddush Hachodesh</i> 2:10, the Rambam explains that we are obligated to rely on the day established Rosh Chodesh by the Jewish court. This matter was handed over to them completely. God, who commanded the observance of the holiday, commanded us to rely on them.
This concept is based on the verse in Leviticus 23:4: ""These are the appointed days of God, sacred days, that you shall designate them in their appointed time."" The word אתם, <i>otam</i>, translated as “them,” may, with a different pronunciation mark be read as <i>otam</i>, “you,” indicating that “you,” the court on the earthly plane, is responsible for the establishment of the times of the festivals based on their designation of the day of Rosh Chodesh.<br>

If [Yom Kippur] falls on the Sabbath, one concludes [this blessing in] each service with: ""the King over all the Earth, who sanctifies the Sabbath, Israel and the Day of Atonement."" - I.e., as for the rest of the holidays, the word Sabbath is simply inserted into the <i>chatimah</i> of the blessing after מקדש (who sanctifies).

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.9,"Before the first blessing of each and every Amidah-prayer, one states: ""God, open my lips, and my mouth will utter Your praise"" [Psalms 51:17]. Upon concluding the prayer, he says<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 9b mentions that just as King David wrote this verse after eighteen chapters of praise (it appears in Psalm 19), we recite it after eighteen blessings of prayer.

Proper intention during the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> is a very difficult matter (See Chapter 4, Halachah 15). Therefore, at the end of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> we ask God to heed our words in any case:
""May the utterances of my mouth..."" - meaning to say: May the words which I uttered in the midst of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> be accepted by You even if my intention was not complete and my mouth acted independently of my heart and mind. ""... and the meditations of my heart...""; i.e., those lofty thoughts and desires which burn in my heart, but I cannot express, may they also be heard by You and received favorably.

</i>.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See <i>Berachot</i> 4b which quotes Rabbi Yochanan as requiring this verse to be recited before every prayer.
Rabbenu Yonah explains that this verse must be understood in conjunction with the verse that follows it: ""You do not desire that I offer sacrifices; a burnt offering, You do not want:"" (Psalms 51:18 . After his relations with Bathsheva, King David realized that he could not attain forgiveness by offering a sacrifice, since a sacrifice is accepted only after an act done unwittingly. Therefore, he asked that God assist him in finding the proper means of expression through prayer to achieve atonement.
We, too, are in a similar situation for we have no Temple and our prayers were instituted in the place of our sacrifices. (See Chapter 1, Halachah 5.) Accordingly, we ask God to assist us in our desire to utter His praises, and request our needs in such a way that it will be desirable to Him.
<i>Berachot</i> 4b raises a question regarding the recitation of this verse before <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. Rabbi Yochanan himself states that one who starts the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> immediately after the blessing after <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, גאל ישראל (Who redeemed Israel) is called a person of the World to Come. (See Chapter 7, Halachah 18, where the Rambam mentions this halachah.)
Why is the recitation of this verse not considered an interruption between the blessing and the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>? The Talmud answers that this verse is considered as an integral part of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, and thus, is viewed as a ""long prayer.""

The source for this addition is <i>Shabbat</i> 24a which states that on Chol HaMo'ed and Rosh Chodesh we should ask God to remember us favorably and to bless us with mercy and lovingkindness on this special day of sanctity. Rashi (<i>Shabbat</i> 24a) explains that we should request mercy for Israel and Jerusalem in order to restore the daily sacrifices to the Temple.

Both Rashi and Rabbenu Nissim interpret ""concluding with Sabbath"" to mean that the <i>chatimah</i> of the middle blessing should be ""... who sanctifies the Sabbath,"" with no mention of Rosh Chodesh or the relevant festival. In contrast, the Rambam maintains that this refers to the text of the blessing itself and not the <i>chatimah</i>.
[It is interesting to note that the position which states that in the <i>chatimah</i> of the blessing one need mention only Sabbath does have halachic importance. The <i>Bi'ur Halachah, Orach Chayim</i> 487, rules that a person who forgets to insert the end of the <i>chatimah</i> ""...Israel and the appointed times"" on the Sabbath of Chol HaMoed and only mentions the Sabbath fulfills his obligation בדיעבד - i.e., after the fact, the mention of Sabbath alone is enough. Rabbi Moshe Feinstein discusses this issue in the fourth volume of <i>Orach Chayim</i> in <i>Iggerot Moshe, siman</i> 21:3.

<i>Berachot</i> 33a,b explains that originally <i>Havdalah</i> was established to be recited in the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. When the Jewish people began to prosper, the Sages then required that it be said over a cup of wine. (Rashi explains that the original decree that it be mentioned in prayer was forgotten.) Then the fortunes of the Jewish people declined again, and the Sages reinstituted the obligation to recite <i>Havdalah</i> in prayer. They also ruled that after <i>Havdalah</i> in the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, one must also recite the <i>Havdalah</i> service over a cup of wine. A parallel is drawn to Friday night when we mention <i>Kiddush</i> in prayer and then make <i>Kiddush</i> over a cup of wine afterwards.
The Rambam begins his discussion of <i>Havdalah</i> within the context of the halachot of the specific prayers recited on various holidays. Therefore, he first mentions the halachot of <i>Havdalah</i> recited on a holiday and only, afterwards, mentions the halachot of <i>Havdalah</i> recited in the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> every Saturday night though seemingly, the latter would be given priority.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.13,"On Chanukah and Purim, one adds ""For the miracles<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Both Chanukah and Purim are commemorated with the same basic prayer, על הניסים. This prayer begins with a statement of thanks for the miracles and redemption relevant to these days, and then a paragraph describing the events of the holiday is recited.
<i>Shabbat</i> 24a, which discusses the laws of Chanukah, is the source for this prayer. However, this Talmudic passage mentions only Chanukah, and not Purim. However, Rav Yitzchak Alfasi quotes a <i>Tosefta</i> from <i>Berachot</i> which equates Chanukah and Purim.
<i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> quotes Rav Amram Gaon that על הניסים is not recited at night on Purim because we have not yet read <i>Megillat Esther</i>. This position is not accepted. It is, however, interesting that a difference was made, according to Rav Amram, between the על הנסים of Chanukah and that of Purim.

</i>.<br>On the Sabbath that occurs during Chanukah, one mentions ""For the miracles,..."" in the <i>Musaf</i> Prayer, just as he does in all the other prayers<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Shabbat</i> 24a asks whether <i>v’al hanisim</i> is mentioned in the <i>Musaf</i> Prayer or not. Rav Huna and Rav Yehudah are of the opinion that it should not be mentioned, since <i>Musaf</i> is not usually recited on Chanukah, and, therefore, there is no need to refer to Chanukah during the <i>Musaf</i> prayer of the Sabbath. Rav Nachman and Rabbi Yochanan hold that since <i>Musaf</i> is simply one of the prayers of the day, and על הנסים is recited on this day, its inclusion in <i>Musaf</i> is in place.
The Talmud ultimately decides in favor of the position of Rav Nachman and Rabbi Yochanan. This is supported by the fact that on Yom Kippur which falls on the Sabbath, reference is made to the Sabbath in the <i>Ne'ilah</i> prayer, even though <i>Ne'ilah</i> is not normally recited on the Sabbath.
The Rambam does not mention this halachah with regard to Purim, since it is only in rare cases that Purim occurs on the Sabbath. Purim is generally celebrated on the fourteenth of Adar, which never occurs on the Sabbath according to our fixed calendar. However, cities which were walled at the time of Joshua's conquest of Israel celebrate Purim on the fifteenth of Adar (<i>Shushan Purim</i>). Nevertheless, there are very few such cities.
Jerusalem is, however, one of them, and there, Purim can fall on the Sabbath. In such a case, על הנסים is said on the Sabbath, even though most of the other commandments of Purim are fulfilled either on the Friday before or the Sunday afterwards. (See the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 688:6 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> there.)

Rashi explains that this is <i>aneinu</i> (Answer us...), a prayer of supplication asking God to look down upon us with favor and not hide His countenance from us because of our wrongdoing.
</i>..."" in ""the One who hears prayer<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> I.e., the last of the intermediate blessings of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. <i>Ta'anit</i> 13b states:
Rav Yehudah taught his son Rav Yitzchak, who said: ""An individual who accepts a fast upon himself recites the prayer of fast days. And where does he say it? Between גואל לרופא - i.e., the blessing of redemption and that of healing!""<br>
Rav Yitzchak asked upon this position: ""Can an individual establish an extra blessing for himself?"" Rather, Rav Yitzchak is of the opinion that it should be inserted into the blessing of ""the One who hears prayer."" Rav Sheshet is also of this opinion.
Although the Talmud refers specifically to one who accepted a fast upon himself, it is clear from the continuation of the discussion there that the same halachah applies to the silent <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> recited by everyone on a public fast day also.
It is interesting to note that the Rambam obligates one to add עננו in all the prayers recited on a Fast Day. This is in line with <i>Shabbat</i> 24a which states: ""On fast days...in the Evening, Morning, and <i>Minchah</i> Prayers, one adds a mention of the particular day in 'the One who hears prayer.' However, the <i>Tur</i> quotes the Geonim that one should recite עננו only in the <i>Minchah</i> Prayer. Since one could be overcome by terrible hunger and break the fast, if one recited עננו earlier he would have spoken falsely when he mentioned the fast day. Therefore, according to this position, this prayer should be mentioned only in the <i>Minchah</i> service at the end of the fast days.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 565:3) quotes the <i>Tur's</i> position, but distinguishes between the four public fast days that occur every year (i.e., those mentioned above in our commentary) and other public fast days. On the four main public fasts, he obligates the individual to mention עננו in all his prayers. Since the Sages declared it a public fast, even were he to eat later on, he would not have spoken falsely in his prayer.
The Ramah ( <i>ibid.</i>), however, mentions that it is customary to recite עננו in <i>Minchah</i> only. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> explains that even one reciting <i>Minchah</i> in the early afternoon should add עננו, because even if he eats later on, at least he fasted until midday. (See Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 562:1.) Sephardim follow the custom of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, and Ashkenazim follow the ruling of the Ramah and therefore recite עננו only in <i>Minchah</i>.
</i>.""<br>The leader of the congregation recites it as an independent blessing between ""the One who redeems Israel"" and ""the One who heals...,"" and concludes with ""the One who answers in times of trouble."" Thus, he recites 20 blessings<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is based on the passage from <i>Ta'anit</i> 13b quoted above. A clear distinction is made between the silent <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> uttered by all the congregants and the repetition recited aloud by the שליח ציבור (leader of the congregation). The שליח ציבור does establish for himself, as representative of the community as a whole, an independent blessing relevant to the fast day. Therefore, he recites 20 blessings, as explained by the Rambam: 19 blessings as on any day, and one extra that is particular to the fast day.
There is no disagreement regarding the obligation of the שליח ציבור to recite עננו in the Morning Prayer. He is praying on behalf of the entire community. Therefore, we need not worry about the possibility of the fast being broken, since it is not possible that a number from among the congregants will not fast the whole day (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 565:3). (See the <i>Bi'ur Halacha</i> who holds that at least ten people must intend to fast in order for the שליח ציבור to recite עננו.)

</i>, one adds [the following] to the blessing of ""the One who rebuilds Jerusalem<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., the eleventh intermediate blessing of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. It is appropriate that the addition regarding the ninth of Av be placed in this blessing, which speaks of rebuilding Jerusalem.
Despite this logic, there is some question regarding the inclusion of this prayer in this blessing. The source for this addition is the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Ta'anit</i> 2:2). That passage questions whether the addition should be made in the עבודה (the first of the last three blessings in the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>) or the הודאה (the second of the last three blessings). It explains that as a general rule commemorative prayers are mentioned in הודאה, while prayers regarding the future are placed in עבודה.
Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi quotes this passage, but adds that the custom is to recite the addition in בונה ירושלים (the blessing of Jerusalem). He explains that this decision is based on <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 8a which states that even though normally, we add special requests in the blessing of שומע תפילה (the One who hears prayer), one is able to make a request relevant to one of the blessings of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, in that blessing itself. Therefore, our prayers and supplications regarding the rebuilding of Jerusalem may rightfully be placed in the blessing of בונה ירושלים. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 557:1.)
</i>"": ""Have mercy on us, God, our Lord, and on Your people, Israel, and Jerusalem, Your city, the mourning city<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Hebrew term is רחם עלינו. This version appears in the Jerusalem Talmud. However, in both Rabbenu Asher's and Rabbenu Yitzhak Alfasi's quotes of that passage, the terms used is נחם (Console us...). This version is found in most siddurim, although the version of Yemenite Jewry is רחם, as in the Rambam.
There is also a question regarding when this prayer is recited. The Rambam seems to indicate that רחם (or נחם) is to be recited in every prayer on the ninth of Av. However, the Ramah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 557:1) states that it should only be recited in <i>Minchah</i>, just like עננו on fast days.
The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 557) quotes the custom of saying רחם in the Evening and Morning Prayers, and נחם during <i>Minchah</i>. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 557:1) rules that נחם should be recited in all three prayers of the day. This is the custom of Sephardim, though Ashkenazim follow the ruling of the Ramah mentioned above. (See the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 557:1.)
The Ramah explains that the rationale behind his decision is that the fire which destroyed the Temple broke out on the afternoon of the ninth of Av. Hence, we ask for comfort at that time specifically. Alternatively, the Ritba explains that only in the afternoon are we able to be comforted. Until then the pain of our loss is too real.

Nevertheless, if one desires to mention them, he may. Ashkenazim do include משיב הרוח in the winter, because of the mention of the rains which are necessary.

Rabbi Yehudah says: ""[When] one leads the congregation on the last holiday of Sukkot: the last one (i.e., the one who leads the congregation in Musaf) mentions it; the first one (the one who leads the Morning Prayer) does not mention it.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 114:2) adds that one may not begin to mention the rain until the שליח ציבור has mentioned it. Therefore, before Musaf on Shemini Atzeret, there is a custom to remind the congregation to mention the rains in order to allow everyone to say משיב הרוח ומוריד הגשם in their silent prayer.
The Ra'avad, quoted in <i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 114, explains that the שליח ציבור must announce משיב הרוח ומוריד הגשם (or מוריד הטל in the summertime), and then the congregation may utter it in their silent prayer. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> points out, however, that a simple reminder is enough, so that everyone will remember and recite the same words. Therefore, one may recite 18בישמ חורה in his silent prayer even though the שליח ציבור does not make the ""official"" announcement until his repetition of Musaf.

The halachah follows Rabbi Yehudah's position. Even though the beginning of Sukkot is also the beginning of the rainy season, we do not mention rain until the end of Sukkot, since rain on Sukkot is a bad omen. <i>Sukkah</i> 28b-29a draws a comparison to a servant who brings his master wine only to have the wine spilled in his face - i.e., we build our sukkot in order to serve our Master, but He causes the rain to fall, as if to say that He does not desire our service and requests that we leave His presence.

Until when does one request rain? Rabbi Yehudah says: ""Until Pesach has passed."" Rabbi Meir says: ""Until Nisan has passed...""
<i>Ta'anit</i> 4b interprets Rabbi Yehudah's statements to mean that one requests rain until the conclusion of Musaf on the first day of Pesach (i.e., the fifteenth of Nisan).

As the diaspora of the Jewish people spread beyond the Mediterranean region, questions regarding this law were raised. Rabbenu Asher (See <i>Tur</i> and <i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 117) raised the question of praying for rain in the summer in Spain or Germany when the climate of the land requires it. Similarly, since the crops in his area would be seriously damaged if rains were not to fall until late November, he lauds the practise (followed in Provence) which begins petitioning for rain in Marcheshvan. At present, the question has become more sensitive when many Jews live in the Southern hemisphere whose rainy season coincides with our summer.
Nevertheless, Rav Yosef Karo rules that all places outside of Eretz Yisrael should follow the practice observed in Babylonia. This position is accepted halachically. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim</i> 117:1 and <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> which discusses this issue at length.)
One begins the petition for rain in the Evening Prayer of the sixtieth day (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, ibid.). Both the day of the Equinox and the sixtieth day are included in the counting of sixty days. Thus, one actually starts to petition in the first week of December (Beit Yosef ibid.).

Rabbenu Manoach points out the difference between the regular <i>chatimah</i> - מלך אוהב צדקה ומשפט - and that recited during the 10 Days of Repentance - המלך המשפט. The regular <i>chatimah</i> indicates God's desire that his creations act in a just and righteous manner. The special one, however, relates to God's judgement of the world.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.19,"There are places that are accustomed during these ten days to add in the first blessing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., the ten days from Rosh Hashanah to Yom Kippur, inclusive.

One does not make any special mention of remembrances in the first three or last three [blessings], except on the holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur themselves alone. And even on these days, they allowed it only with difficulty.
The """"remembrances"" referred to in the Mishnah are the very additions mentioned by the Rambam in this halachah.

However, the general practice is to add these special prayers on all ten days. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 602.)
The difficulty regarding these additions stems from <i>Berachot</i> 34a which states that one may not add any special requests in the first three or last three blessings of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. (See Chapter 6, Halachah 3.) However, Rabbi Yitzchak ibn Gayut explains that since these remembrances are relevant to the needs of the entire community, they may be recited in the first three and last three blessings. <i>Berachot</i> (ibid.) prohibits only requests made by an individual for his personal needs.

One is liable only when one shaves with a razor, as [implied by Leviticus 19:27]: ""Do not destroy the corners of your beard."" [We can infer that this applies only] to shaving which utterly destroys [one's facial hair]. Therefore, a person who removes his beard with scissors is exempt. - From the Rambam's expression, it appears that the removal of facial hair with scissors is forbidden. One is not, however, punished for such an act (<i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, <i>ibid.</i>; <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i>). The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 181) differs, and maintains that it is permitted to remove one's facial hair as long as one does not use a razor.
In addition, as mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 1, the <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> and <i>Sefer HaKovetz</i> explain that by mentioning the fact that gentile priests remove their facial hair, the Rambam implies that removing such hair violates the prohibition of following ""the paths of the gentiles."" (See Chapter 11, Halachah 1.) In the context of this prohibition, the means used to remove the facial hair are of no consequence.
Other authorities (Rashba, Vol. IV, Responsum 90; <i>Shibbolei Leket</i>; <i>Tzemach Tzedek, Yoreh De'ah</i>, Responsum 93) forbid the removal of one's facial hair within the context of the prohibition against a man's adorning himself in the same manner as a woman.

Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 12.14,"This commandment also includes [a prohibition]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 45), the Rambam explains that the interpretation which follows is an allegory, and the simple meaning of the verse is to prohibit gashing oneself in grief. Nevertheless, it is significant that the Rambam includes this ""allegory"" in a text which is, as he states in his introduction, ""halachot, halachot."" Thus, he emphasizes how important unity is to the Jewish people.
There is an important halachic dimension to the Rambam's explanation in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>. One of the principles of Torah law is that punishment is never administered for the violation of a לאו שבכללות (""a prohibition which includes within it several different injunctions;"" see <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 18:2-3). If this allegorical interpretation of the mitzvah were considered to be included in the simple meaning of the mitzvah, this principle would also apply regarding this mitzvah, and lashes might not be administered when one gashed oneself in mourning (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).
</i> against there being two courts which follow different customs in a single city, since this can cause great strife<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This decision has been the subject of much discussion among the Rabbis, because it appears to run contrary to one of the accepted principles of halachah.
The Rabbis concluded that whenever there is a difference in opinion between Abbaye and Ravva, the halachah follows Ravva, with the exception of six specific instances (יעל קגם). In the present case, the Rambam quotes Abbaye's opinion even though Ravva differs, stating that the prohibition applies only when one follows a divergent opinion without the support of a formal Rabbinical court (<i>Yevamot</i> 14a). When, however, there is a Rabbinical court which advocates each of the differing opinions - e.g., the differences of opinion between the School of Shammai and the School of Hillel - there is no prohibition against following either view until the halachah is determined by the supreme <i>Sanhedrin</i>.
Many authorities have advanced different explanations for the Rambam's decision. The most straightforward is that of the Radbaz (Vol. V, Responsum 1384), who explains that the Rambam favored Abbaye's view because of the emphasis on unity. Furthermore, selecting it over Ravva's in this instance does not represent a break with the accepted tradition, since the difference of opinion here does not center on positions adopted by Abbaye and Ravva independently, but rather on their interpretation of Resh Lakish's statements.
</i>. [Because of the similarity in the Hebrew roots,]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Hebrew גדד means both ""gash"" and ""group.""
</i> the prohibition against gashing ourselves [can be interpreted] to mean: ""Do not separate into various different groupings<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> It must be noted that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> does not quote this halachah as law. It would appear that while many of the subsequent Rabbis appreciate the ideal of unity this halachah espouses, they felt that compelling people to conform to a uniform standard would create more strife than would result from the existence of different views.
One of the practical applications of the issues under discussion is the issue of differences between Sephardic and Ashkenazic religious practices (and similarly, the variety of different approaches that exist within these two major groupings). All of the contemporary authorities agree that it is desirable for each group to adhere to its native customs without change. This plurality of halachic perspectives is an expression - and not a negation - of the all-encompassing unity that permeates Torah Judaism. (See <i>Ezrat Cohen</i>, Responsum 103.)

Though the Ashkenazic community follows his view, in Egypt and in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> the priests have always fulfilled the mitzvah of blessing the people every day. Many Ashkenazic authorities, among them Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi and Rav Shlomo Kluger, desired to introduce this practice in the Ashkenazic community. However, they were not successful in doing so.

Accordingly, just as a priest is forbidden to serve in the Temple while intoxicated (Leviticus 10:9 , he is also forbidden to recite the priestly blessings in such a state (<i>Ta'anit</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>).

All the Sages agree that the priestly blessing is not recited during an ordinary <i>Minchah</i>. However, Rabbi Meir requires the priestly blessing to be recited on a fast day. On the other hand, Rabbi Yosse follows the view quoted by the Rambam. His position is accepted by the other Halachic authorities as well.

The <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> explains that the priests recite <i>Y'varechecha</i> - the first word of the priestly blessings - directly after concluding the blessing (see Halachah 12) recited before blessing the people, without being prompted by the reader. They take the initiative, so that an interruption is not made between the recitation of the blessing before the performance of a mitzvah and its actual performance.
Study of the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) shows that the Rambam himself had questions about this matter. In the first manuscripts, the Rambam writes that ""the leader of the congregation recites <i>Y'varechecha</i>, and the priests read after him."" This is also the reading in the popularly published edition of that text. However, in the later manuscripts of the Commentary on the Mishnah (see Rav Kapach's edition of that text), the Rambam changes his mind and states that the priests begin reciting <i>y'varechecha</i>.
In his <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 128), Rav Yosef Karo mentions these different views, and in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (128:13) rules that the priests begin on their own initiative. The Ramah differs and states that it is Ashkenazic practice that this word is also recited in response to the <i>chazan</i>.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Compare to the practice in the Temple mentioned in Halachah 9.
</i>, and begin reciting, <i>Y'varechecha</i>....<br>The leader of the congregation reads [the blessing] to them, word for word, and they respond after him [as can be inferred<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See the <i>Sifre</i> on the verse below.
</i> from Numbers 6:23: ""This is how you should bless the children of Israel:] 'Say to them...;’” [i.e., the priests do not bless until one] ""says to them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The fact that the priests merely repeat the blessing emphasizes the concept (Chapter 14, Halachah 7) that the blessing is God's, and the priests do no more than convey that blessing to the people (<i>Kinat Eliyahu</i>).
When [the priests] conclude the first verse, all the people answer ""Amen."" - The <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> states that responding ""Amen"" to the priestly blessings is an obligation from the Torah.
Note the difference between this law and the ruling when the <i>chazan</i> recites the priestly blessings in the absence of any priests (Chapter 15, Halachah 10). Note also the contrast to the people's response to the priestly blessings in the Temple, (Halachah 9).
<b>The leader of the congregation reads [the priests] the second verse, word for word, and they respond after him until they complete the second verse. -</b> The Ramah (<i>loc. cit.</i>:45) mentions the custom of the priests chanting during the recitation of the blessings. This practice is followed only on holidays. In <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, the priests do not chant when the priestly blessing is recited on other days.
<b>The people respond ""Amen."" The same applies regarding the third verse. -</b> <i>Berachot</i> 55b states that a person who has a dream which requires explanation should stand before the priests when they bless the people. Accordingly, it is customary to recite a prayer regarding dreams during the priestly blessing. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> <i>loc. cit.</i>; 130:1 and commentaries.)

These textual differences reflect a difference of interpretation. The standard text relates that the <i>chazan</i> should not begin reading the blessing to the priests until one no longer hears the Amen which the congregation recited in response to the blessing recited by the priests (Halachah 12) before blessing the people.
According to the texts which read כהנים, the halachah teaches us that the <i>chazan</i> should not call the priests until the Amen recited by the congregation in response to the blessing <i>Modim</i> can no longer be heard.

Nevertheless, he should not recite ""Amen,"" because he may become confused and begin reading the wrong blessing to the priests.
Note that in Chapter 15, Halachah 10, the Rambam writes that if the <i>chazan</i> is the only priest present in a community, he should not bless the people, lest he become confused and err in his prayers. However, if he is sure that he will not make a mistake, he may bless the people. In the present halachah, the Rambam does not make such an allowance.
Perhaps the difference is that in Chapter 15, there is the possibility that the recitation of the priestly blessing will be nullified entirely. Hence, greater leniency is shown. In this halachah, the congregation as a whole will not suffer if the <i>chazan</i> does not respond ""Amen"" to the priests' blessings. Though the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i> 128:19) quotes the Rambam's decision, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (128:31) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (128:71) state that particularly at present, when the blessings are recited from a siddur, the <i>chazan</i> should respond Amen.

The Rambam addresses himself to this question in one of his responsa and explains that there is nothing wrong with another member of the congregation calling the priests. However, there is no obligation to have this done.

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is a slightly problematic statement.

There, the Levites would stand and accompany the Temple service with songs and music. No mention is made of the priests standing there. Also, in Halachah 14, the Rambam mentions that the priests would bless the people while standing on the steps of the Temple building.
The Radbaz (Vol. II, <i>Leshonot HaRambam</i>) offers a resolution to this difficulty, noting that priests with disqualifying physical deformities may not stand on the Temple steps (<i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 7:20). Thus, the majority of priests would stand on the Temple steps, and those with deformities would stand on the <i>duchan</i>.
The <i>Tiferet Yisrael</i> (<i>Middot</i> 2:4) states that most of the priests would stand on the Temple steps. If there was no room there, they would stand on the <i>duchan</i>.

However, since the priests themselves are forbidden to add to the priestly blessings (see Halachah 12), ""Blessed be God..."" would be recited by the people, and not by the priests.
Alternatively, because the people had already responded ""Blessed be the name..."" in response to each of the three recitations of God's name in the priestly blessings, then, when the blessings are concluded, they recite ""Blessed be God..."" (<i>Rishon Letzion, Berachot</i>).

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that it refers to a person who was not circumcised because his brothers died because of circumcision. A Jew who intentionally fails to circumcise himself, however, should not be allowed to circumcise others. Rav Yosef Karo also quotes this ruling in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 264:1).

This ruling revolves around the conception that there are two dimensions to circumcision:
a) the mitzvah of actually cutting off the foreskin;
b) the effect of that cutting, that the person is circumcised.
There are, however, other explanations of the Rambam's ruling. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the decision revolves upon whether or not circumcision must be carried out <i>lishmah</i>, for the sake of the fulfillment of the mitzvah.
The Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 264:1) rules that although a second circumcision is not required, blood should be extracted. This is the accepted practice today. Some authorities maintain that even the Rambam requires such a step.

God promised iron that, in recognition of its act on behalf of the Jews, they would use it for a positive purpose in future generations.

Today, there are authorities who suggest the use of a pipette because of the danger that the <i>mohel</i> could contract AIDS.

It is forbidden for a person to sell a Torah scroll even if he has nothing to eat<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's words (quoted from <i>Megillah</i> 27a) should not be taken absolutely literally. Surely, if a person is in danger of dying of hunger, he may sell a Torah scroll. Rather, this refers to an instance when a person lacks a source of income and is required to sustain himself from charity (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). (See also Ramah, <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 270:1; <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 270:2.)

[This prohibition applies] even if he possesses many scrolls or if he [desires to] sell an old scroll in order to purchase a new one<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rabbenu Manoach explains that the reason for the latter ruling is that, despite one's resolve, circumstances may arise, and ultimately, one may never buy the new scroll. Accordingly, if the new scroll has already been completed and an agreement concluded, the old scroll may be sold. The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 270:3, however, forbids a sale even under these circumstances. (Compare to <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 11:12.)

There are certain versions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> that state: ""until he moves four cubits away from the corpse, bathhouse, or lavatory."" Since the Rambam does not mention the obligation of moving away from a bathhouse in Chapter 4 or in Chapter 3 of <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i>, we can assume that he does not feel that it is necessary, and that as soon as one steps outside of the bathhouse he may recite words of Torah.

Noting the difficulty with the simple interpretation of this statement, the Talmud interprets it to mean, ""buried naked of the merit of this mitzvah.""
Our translation follows the <i>Bnei Binyamin</i>, who interprets ""naked"" as modifying ""a person,"" and not the scroll. There are authorities who interpret the Talmud's statement to mean that one should not hold a Torah scroll while the scroll is uncovered. See the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 147:1). Note also the <i>Noda BiYhudah</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i>, Responsum 7), who discusses the Rambam's perspective on this law.

When he discovered it, he recoiled in shock as if facing a snake.
The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 282:8 relates that this law does not apply if the Torah scroll is placed on another article that lifts it up at least a handbreadth (three handbreadths is more desirable) above the couch.

This is dependent on the discussion (See commentary, Halachah 2) regarding the extent of the obligation to read <i>Shema</i> required by the Torah. Rabbi Meir understands intention to be absolutely necessary only for the first verse and this opinion is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 60:5.
</i>ithout intention, does not fulfill his obligation<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Needless to say, it is not desirable to read the <i>Shema</i> in this manner and, at the outset, one should attempt to read the entire <i>Shema</i> with proper concentration.

</i>. [One who recites] the rest without intention<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The definition of the term ""intention"" is the subject of much discussion by the Rabbis.
There is a dispute among the <i>Rishonim</i> regarding whether the performance of commandments requires intention, i.e., must a person have in mind that he is performing the required act in fulfillment of God's command or not? The Rambam (See <i>Hilchot Shofar</i> 2:4 and note <i>Hilchot Chametz U'Matzah</i> 6:4, and the commentary of the Moznaim editions of those Halachot) maintains that it is necessary to have such an intention. This opinion is also supported by Rabbenu Yitchak Alfasi and Rabbenu Asher and is accepted as Halachah by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 60:4, 598:8). [The dissenting opinions are held by the Rashba and others.]
However, concerning the first verse of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, an extra level of concentration is required. In addition to the intent to carry out God's command, the <i>Shema</i> must be read in fear and awe, trembling and trepidation. One accepts upon oneself the kingship of Heaven and proclaims the unity of God. It is unthinkable that at such a time, one would not focus his attention on the words he is uttering, but would rather think of mundane matters. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 60:5.)
Each day one should imagine that he is reciting <i>Shema Yisrael</i> for the first time, and not as if he had heard it many times before (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 61:1,2).
<i>Kri'at Shema</i> contains 248 words (245 of the three sections, plus the three extra words of <i>Ado-nai Elo-heichem Emet</i> repeated upon completion of the third section). This corresponds to the 248 positive commandments in the Torah and the 248 limbs of the human body (<i>Midrash Ne'elam</i>; quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 61:3.) Thus, the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>, with its affirmation of God's kingship and Unity, imbues the totality of one's being with these fundamental concepts.

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that intention of any kind is necessary for only the first verse and, afterwards, one could continue studying or proofreading in a normal fashion, provided he reads the words properly. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> also supports this position (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 60:5).

Reading the Shema 2.3,"A person who is walking on foot must stop for the first verse<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in order to concentrate his attention.
<i>Berachot</i> 13b mentions two opinions regarding the extent of the <i>Shema</i> one must recite before he may continue on his way:<br>
that of Rav Yehudah which requires the first two verses of the <i>Shema</i> to be recited standing;<br>
and that of Rabbi Yochanan which requires the entire <i>Shema</i> to be recited in a stationary position.
Rav Yitzchak Alfasi explains that the actual halachah does not follow either of these positions, but rather is in accordance with the view of Rabbi Meir that only the first verse requires absolute intention. (See Halachah 1.)
The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 63:3 also accepts this decision.

If one is sleeping, we should disturb him by awakening him until he reads the first verse<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot, op. cit.,</i> explains that one unavoidably overcome by sleep after having recited the first verse has fulfilled his obligation. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that the majority of the <i>Rishonim</i> hold that this is the case on the condition that he nevertheless manages to recite the rest of the <i>Shema</i>, albeit in a drowsy state.
Thus, our halachah mentions the necessity of alertness for the first verse within the context of the halachot of the intention required to read the <i>Shema</i>. In Halachah 12, the Rambam discusses sleepiness within the context of the need for proper enunciation of the words of the <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. That halachah supports the <i>Kessef Mishneh's</i> position that one fulfills one's obligation only if he also recites the rest of the <i>Shema</i>.
</i>. From that point on, if he is overcome by sleep, we are not obligated to disturb him<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> A careful reading of the Rambam’s words leads one to support the position of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> just mentioned. After the first verse, the Rambam mentions only that we need not disturb the person, but he does not write that we should not awaken him. This could mean that although we are not obligated to disturb him to such an extent that he is aroused to a state of full alertness, we are obligated to awaken him so that he can finish <i>Kri'at Shema</i> before going back to sleep. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 63:5.)

Reading the Shema 2.4,"A person who is involved in work must stop while he recites the whole first section<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rav Yitzchak Alfasi explains that this applies even according to the halachically accepted position of Rabbi Meir, that utmost concentration is necessary for the first verse only.

The obligation to have proper concentration and the necessity that one's recitation of the <i>Shema</i> not appear haphazard are two different halachic requirements.

Rabbenu Manoach holds that only the workers may remain in the tree. In contrast, a foreman who is there to encourage his work force, must descend from the tree and recite it on the ground. The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 63:8 both disagree with this and allow both of them to recite it while in the tree.

Reading the Shema 2.5,"A person who is studying Torah when the time to recite the <i>Shema</i> arrives should stop to recite the <i>Shema</i> w<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See the commentary at the end of the previous halachah.

This refers even to Sages like Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai who would never interrupt their Torah study except to perform mitzvot which could not be performed by others. The acceptance of the yoke of God's kingship in the <i>Shema</i> is fundamentally necessary even for a person with such an all encompassing commitment to Torah.
Similarly, as stated above, <i>Berachot</i> 10b states that the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> at its proper time is preferable to the study of Torah.

Rabbi Yehudah says: Once I was following Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah. The time of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> arrived (but they did not perform the mitzvah). I was under the impression that they felt unable to. They were, however, involved in community matters.

</i>"
Reading the Shema 2.6,"A person who is eating, is in the bathhouse, is having a haircut, is working with skins<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 9b) prohibits one to start eating, have a haircut, work skins, etc., close to the time of the afternoon prayer. However, the Mishnah adds that were one to start doing one of these prohibited actions, he need not stop. The Rambam also applies these principles to <i>Kri'at Shema</i> (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>). The Ra'avad (based on <i>Sukkah</i> 38a) differs and holds that a person must interrupt his meal in order to read the <i>Shema</i>.
</i> or is involved in court<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., if he is one of the judges.

There is an apparent difficulty with the Rambam's statements. Halachah 5 states that one must interrupt Torah study in order to recite the <i>Shema</i>, and yet, in this halachah, such mundane matters as eating and haircuts are deemed sufficient reasons to postpone <i>Kri'at Shema</i>.
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the study of Torah is interrupted, since, indeed, the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> need not be understood as an interruption at all. Since <i>Kri'at Shema</i> is in itself a section of the Torah, its reading can be likened to the study of Torah. However, in the case of the mundane activities mentioned in our halachah, <i>Kri'at Shema</i> would involve a complete interruption. Therefore, it is not necessary to stop.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There is a question whether the Rambam refers to 6 minutes before sunrise, the optimum time to recite the <i>Shema</i>, or the end of the third hour of the day beyond which one does not fulfill the mitzvah (See Chapter 1, Halachah 11-13). According to other authorities, the latter view would be followed.

One who stops reciting in such a place is praised, and Deuteronomy 32:47 says about him ""... in those words, your days will be lengthened"".

Rashi, in his commentary to Genesis 46:29, relates that when Jacob was first reunited with Joseph he made no response because he was reciting the <i>Shema</i> at that time.

If he reads, but does not enunciate clearly: Rabbi Yosse says that he has fulfilled his obligation. Rabbi Yehudah says that he has not.
The Talmud concludes (<i>ibid.</i> 15b) that the halachah is in accordance with the lenient position in both cases - i.e., the anonymous opinion in the first case and Rabbi Yosse in the second.
Rav Yitzchak Alfasi adds that this is only after the fact. A priori (לכתחילה), one must read in such a way as to be audible to himself and enunciate the letters clearly. The Rambam follows this view.
Nevertheless, one must at least mouth the words of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, even if he does not pronounce them loudly enough that they are audible to himself. Thought is not regarded like speech. (See the commentary on Halachah 3.) Therefore, one who does not even move his lips, but just thinks about the words as he ""reads"" them, does not fulfill his obligation (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 62:3).
</i>.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Yoma</i> 19b distinguishes between the first section of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> and the second in this regard, forbidding these activities only during the recitation of the first section. Indeed, in Halachah 4 which also deals with a ""haphazard"" recitation of the <i>Shema</i>, the Rambam, himself makes such a distinction.
Indeed, the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam relies on his statements in Halachah 4. Rabbenu Manoach explains that the Rambam did not clarify the matter explicitly lest he cheapen the value of the second section in the eyes of his reader. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> adds that although making such gestures in the second section is not as ""improper"" as during the first, doing so is, nevertheless, prohibited.

It must be emphasized that the elongation of the <i>dalet</i> and the <i>chet</i> should not distort the proper pronunciation of the word.

Rav Yirmiah was sitting before Rav Chiyyah bar Abba and noticed that he severely lengthened [his <i>dalet</i>]. He said to him that once he had proclaimed God, King above and below and to the four directions of the Heavens, he need not continue [to prolong the <i>dalet</i>].
The Maharsha mentions that the <i>chet</i> (numerical value of eight) corresponds to the Earth and the seven levels of Heaven, and the <i>dalet</i> (numerical value of four) corresponds to the four directions.

There are other cases in <i>Kri'at Shema</i> where this problem arises, such as <i>veahavta et</i> (Deuteronomy 6:5 . In all these cases care must be exercised to separate the words clearly.
It is interesting to note that the Rambam mentions one example from each of the three sections of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, in order to teach us that enunciation is equally important in all the sections.

Reading the Shema 2.10,"A person may recite the <i>Shema</i> in any language he understands. O<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., although a person is allowed to read the <i>Shema</i> in a foreign language, he must still fulfill all the halachic requirements of enunciation, and, therefore, careful translation, as prescribed in Halachah 9 (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).
The Ra'avad disagrees with the Rambam and prohibits one from reading the <i>Shema</i> in a foreign language. Since any translation is a commentary, he feels that it is impossible to read with the necessary care. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 62:2 quotes the Rambam's opinion as halachah.
Nevertheless, the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (62:3) points out that although the halachah is indeed that one may recite the <i>Shema</i>, grace after meals, the silent Amidah, and Kiddush on Shabbat in any language, at present, it is highly preferable to say them all in Hebrew. This is even the case for someone who does not understand Hebrew since a proper translation is very difficult, and the true meaning of the prayers will be lost. He points out that certain words (e.g., <i>totafot</i>) are indeed impossible to translate.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 13a records a disagreement between Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi, who holds that the <i>Shema</i> must be read as it is - i.e., in <i>lashon hakodesh</i> - and the Sages, who hold that it may be recited in any language. The latter explain that the word <i>Shema</i> - literally, ""hear,"" - indicates the acceptability of any language that one hears - i.e., understands.

In contrast, the repetition of <i>Shema</i> [or <i>Modim</i> (We thank You) - the examples cited explicitly in the Mishnah - appears to indicate that one is paying respect to two kings, 18וóח.
Rabbi Moshe Feinstein points out (<i>Iggerot Moshe, Orach Chayim</i>, Vol. II, Responsa 22) that even in the course of singing prayers, one should not repeat words as cantors are prone to do, even though it does not constitute an interruption per se.

In his commentary on that Mishnah, the Rambam explains that the one who reads intermittently fulfills his obligation even if he pauses long enough to finish the whole <i>Megillah</i>.
<i>Berachot</i> 24b applies that halachah not only to the reading of the <i>Megillah</i>, which is a Rabbinic ordinance, but also to the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>, which is a Torah obligation. See also <i>Hilchot Shofar</i> 3:5.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 65:1 quotes the Rambam's statements as halachah. The Ramah adds, however, that were one to be unavoidably detained during the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> for a period long enough to finish the entire <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, he must recite it again. Such an interruption is considered significant, since even if he had wanted to finish the <i>Shema</i>, he would have been unable to do so.
The <i>Magen Avraham</i> points out that the Ramah's position would apply only in the case that one were unavoidably detained by the need to relieve himself, or that he suddenly found himself in a place unfit for the recitation of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>.

Reading the Shema 2.13,"One who is unsure whether or not he recited the <i>Shema</i>, s<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rashba in Responsum 320 explains that although the blessings are of Rabbinic origin and, therefore, we should not require one to say them in a situation of doubt (see above, לקולא ספק דרבנן), the proper recitation of the <i>Shema</i> is inseparable from its blessings. Therefore, since we obligate one in doubt to recite the <i>Shema</i>, this entails the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> in its normal fashion - i.e., with its blessings. (See <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>.)

Rabbi Elazar says that he must recite the <i>Shema</i> in such a situation of doubt because <i>Kri'at Shema</i> is a Torah obligation. Therefore, the principle - ספק דאורייתא לחומרא [a doubt regarding a Torah Law leads to a strict response] - should be followed.

Rashi explains that returning to the first section means to the pause between the first two sections, i.e., one would begin reading from <i>ViHayah Im Shamoa</i>, the second section in <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. The <i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 64 also explains the halachah in this fashion.
The Rambam, however, understands that the Gemara obligates one to return to the beginning of the first section. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> explains that both Rashi and the Rambam agree that one must return to the point of the first pause in <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. The Rambam, however, holds that the first pause one makes while reading the <i>Shema</i> is not between the first two sections. Rather, it is after the recitation of ברוך שם כבוד מלכותו לעולם ועד. This signifies the transition between one's acceptance of the kingship of Heaven and the beginning of the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 61:14 states the halachah that one must pause between ברוך שם and ואהבת. However, its decision regarding the law under discussion (<i>ibid.</i> 64:3) reflects Rashi's position.

These halachot are based on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 13a):
""Between sections, one may initiate greetings out of respect, and respond. In the middle [of a section], one may initiate greetings out of fear, and respond,"" these are the words of Rabbi Meir.<br>

Reading the Shema 2.16," If one is in the middle [of a section], he may stop and initiate an exchange of greetings only with someone of whom he is afraid - e.g., a king or tyrant<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The term מפני היראה (out of fear) used in the abovementioned Mishnah refers to a king or tyrant - i.e., someone of whom one is physically afraid.
Rashi explains fear as referring to someone who one is afraid will kill him. Rabbenu Asher takes issue with Rashi's explanation of fear. He points out that it is unnecessary for the Mishnah to inform us that in the case of פיקוח נפש (a life-threatening situation), one may interrupt <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. Even violation of the Shabbat is permitted in such instances.
Therefore, Rabbenu Asher explains ""out of fear"" as referring to one's father or rabbi: איש את אימו ואת אביו תיראו (Every person must revere his mother and father) (Leviticus 19:3 . We also learn in <i>Pirkei Avot</i> 4:12 and <i>Pesachim</i> 108a that the fear of one's rabbi is similar to the fear of Heaven. See also <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 5:1.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 66:1 accepts Rashi's position regarding honor and Rabbenu Asher's interpretation of fear. He also mentions the Rambam's understanding of ""out of fear,"" as referring to a king or tyrant - this refers to one who is likely to cause pain or sorrow (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).

The <i>Mishnah Berurah, Orach Chayim</i> 66:1 explains that at present, one should never greet [or return greetings of] anyone during <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, or even during פסוקי דזמרא, the verses of praise that precede <i>Kri'at Shema</i> and its blessings, unless it is clear that such a person will be insulted. Since people do not expect one to interrupt <i>Kri'at Shema</i> in order to greet them, such an insult is extremely rare indeed.
One should, however, interrupt at any point [except in the middle of the verses שמע ישראל and ברוך שם כבוד] in order to respond to <i>Kaddish</i> (יהא שמיה רבא), <i>Kedushah</i> (קדוש קדוש קדוש), <i>Barchu</i> and <i>Modim</i>. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 66:3, the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> there and <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Orach Chayim</i> 66:2.)
In his responsa, the Rambam also forbids the inclusion of hymns within the blessings [as is Ashkenazic custom on festivals], considering them as an interruption.

Reading the Shema 4.1,"Women<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 20b relates:
A woman's exemption from <i>Kri'at Shema</i> is obvious. It is a time-oriented commandment [i.e., the <i>Shema</i> must be recited at specific times and is thus classified as ""time-oriented"" (see Chapter 1, Halachot 9 to 13)], and women are exempt from all such commandments.<br>
What might I have thought? That since [<i>Kri'at Shema</i>] contains the acceptance of the sovereignty of Heaven [even women would be called upon to recite it.<br>
It [i.e., the Mishnah] teaches that this is not so and that women are indeed exempt from <i>Kri'at Shema</i>.
In terms of actual halachic ruling, the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 70:1 rules that although women have no obligation, even rabbinic, to recite the <i>Shema</i>, it is proper that they do so in order to accept upon themselves the yoke of the sovereignty of Heaven.
Women are also exempt from the blessings before <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, but are obligated to recite the blessings after it, because there is a mention of the Exodus from Egypt, which women are also obligated to remember and mention (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 70:1).
The <i>Aruch Hashulchan</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 70:1) also mentions that women may recite all the blessings of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> and adds that the women of his area (Russia in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century) were accustomed to do so, and that they should be blessed for their meritorious actions.
The responsa, <i>Yabia Omer</i> (2:6), states that women of Sephardic origin are not accustomed to recite the blessings. However, <i>Kaf HaChayim</i> rules that they may.
slaves - This refers to Canaanite slaves who have been sold to a Jewish owner and are obligated by all the commandments that women are obligated to perform. A halachic comparison between the two is found in <i>Chaggigah</i> 4a and <i>Kiddushin</i> 23a.
The Jerusalem Talmud quotes a separate source for the exemption of slaves: ""Hear O Israel, God our Lord, God is One"" (Deuteronomy 6:4 . He who has no master other than the Almighty [is obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i>], thus exempting the slave, who has another master.
<i>Chaggigah</i> 4a also derives the halachah in a similar fashion, albeit from a different verse.

Rather, the child's father is obligated to educate him. If he has no father, the obligation falls on his mother and on the local Rabbinic court (<i>Terumat Hadeshen</i> 99).
<i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 48a) differs and explains that the Sages placed the obligation on the minor himself. Support for this premise can be derived from the Rambam's decision in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 5:15-16, which states that an adult who ate a small meal can fulfill his obligation to recite grace by listening to a child reciting those blessings (for both are obligated by virtue of Rabbinic decree). Though others object on the grounds that the child himself is not obligated in the mitzvah, the Rambam states that such a practice is acceptable.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The latter point represents a difference in opinion between Rashi and the Rambam. The Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 20a, states that children are free from the obligation to recite the <i>Shema</i>. Rashi states that they are entirely free of obligation even according to Rabbinic law because their parents may not be available at the specific times at which the <i>Shema</i> must be recited.
The Rambam and Rabbenu Tam differ and maintain that the mishnah is only referring to the obligations according to Torah law, but according to Rabbinic decree they are obligated. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 70:2 rules in accordance with the Rambam and Rabbenu Tam.

</i>, including <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. T<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 16a, explains the derivation of the bridegroom's exemption. The phrase ובלכתך בדרך - ""and as you go in your way"" implies that the obligation to recite the <i>Shema</i> only applies to someone going on ""your way,"" i.e., involved in his own personal affairs and not preoccupied with the fulfillment of a mitzvah as is a bridegroom. [In his commentary on that Mishnah, the Rambam mentions that the bridegroom is involved in the mitzvah of being fruitful and multiplying.]
Rashi explains that this concept could not be derived from the phrase בשבתך בביתך - ""and while you are sitting in your house"" because if there were only one verse, one would have thought that only one who is actually involved in the performance of a commandment is exempted. Thus, an additional phrase is necessary to exempt a bridegroom, who though not immediately involved in the performance of the mitzvah is in an anxious state, because of the possible problems inherent in the overall situation.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> I.e., even though it contains an acceptance of the yoke of the sovereignty of Heaven, he is still exempt.
The phrase, Deuteronomy 6:7, ובשבתך בביתך (and while you are sitting in your house) implies that the obligation is only incumbent on someone who is involved in his own personal affairs - ""your house."" Thus, it excludes one who is involved in the performance of a mitzvah (<i>Berachot</i> 11a and 16a).

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as explained above. Rabbenu Manoach writes in the name of the Ra'avad that the bridegroom is exempt from <i>Kri'at Shema</i> only if he is able to have relations with his wife. However, if she is menstruating or sick, he is obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i>.
Rabbenu Manoach also discusses the different views regarding the bridegroom's obligation to recite the <i>Shema</i> during the day if he does not engage in relations the first night. He concludes that he should be obligated since ""the Jews are a holy people and the bridegroom will be able to divert his thoughts from his wife and concentrate on reciting the <i>Shema</i>.""
</i>.<br>However, if he delays until Saturday night after the wedding and does not have relations with her, he is obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i> from that time onward, since his mind has settled and he is familiar with her even though they have not consummated the marriage<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> I.e., he is no longer nervous and distracted and can be expected to recite the <i>Shema</i> with the proper intention. In his commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam mentions that by this time, his all-consuming desire to consummate the marriage has passed.
In this instance, the actual halachah does not reflect the Rambam's position. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 70:3, mentions that bridegrooms were originally exempt from <i>Kri'at Shema</i> the first three days (i.e., days and nights) after the wedding. However, today, because of the general lack of intention that everyone has regarding <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, even the bridegroom is obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i>.
The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (70:14) adds that a bridegroom who does not recite the <i>Shema</i> appears haughty, because his actions appear to imply that he usually has a high level of intentions. The bridegroom is also obligated to recite the blessings before and after <i>Kri'at Shema</i> and to pray as usual (<i>Magen Avraham; Mishnah Berurah</i>). These positions are based on <i>Tosafot</i> in <i>Berachot</i> 17b.

The Talmud (<i>ibid.</i> 18a) explains that any relative waiting to be buried is considered to be ""lying in front of him."" This is derived from Abraham's characterization of Sarah as being in front of him (Genesis 23:4 , even though her body was not physically present.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and all the other mitzvot of the Torah (<i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 4:6).

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> I.e., even if he is not necessarily involved in dealing with the arrangements for the burial or the burial itself, he is exempt, because his mind is distracted (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).
The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 3:1) derives this halachah from Deuteronomy 16:3: ""to remember the day you left Egypt all the days of your life."" This implies ""days that you are involved with the living and not days in which you are involved with the dead."" Since the obligation to remember the Exodus (an integral part of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> - see Chapter 1, Halachot 2 and 3) does not apply on those days when one is involved in dealing with the burial of one's loved ones, one is also exempted from reciting the <i>Shema</i>.
<i>Sukkah</i> 25a explains that the exemption of a mourner cannot be derived from that of a bridegroom mentioned in Halachah 1. A bridegroom's lack of concentration stems from his involvement with a mitzvah. In contrast, the mourner's inability to concentrate is a personal matter. Rashi elaborates: Though mourning is a mitzvah, the pain associated with mourning is not.
The Jerusalem Talmud notes that a mourner should not voluntarily recite the <i>Shema</i>. It is a sign of disrespect to the departed for their relatives to recite the <i>Shema</i> before they have been buried.

His exemption is also based on the principle that one involved in a commandment is exempt from another. The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 71:5) points out that even while he is resting for a few moments, the gravedigger is still exempt, because his resting is also part of the mitzvah, since by resting he gains strength to continue his task.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As opposed to the actual mourners, the guards are obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i> if they are able to. Their exemption is not based on their distracted condition, but on their involvement in the commandment. Therefore, if another is able to guard the body for a few moments, the guard must recite the <i>Shema</i>. However, if there is no one to relieve the guard, he is not allowed to recite the <i>Shema</i> (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> on the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 71:3).
The watchers must remove themselves in order not to recite the <i>Shema</i> within 6 feet of the dead person. (See Chapter 3, Halachah 2 and commentary.)

Reading the Shema 4.4,"A body should not be taken out for burial close to the time for reciting the <i>Shema</i>, u<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, questions the above statement, noting that when Rav Yosef died he was taken out for burial close to the time of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. The Talmud answers that a great man is different - i.e., for a man of Rav Yosef's stature, even <i>Kri'at Shema</i> is postponed in order to honor his greatness.
Neither Rav Yitzchak Alfasi or Rabbenu Asher mentions this passage, indicating that they do not feel that it is halachically relevant. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 72) mentions the Rambam's view, but adds that his father, Rabbenu Asher, did not differentiate between important and normal people.
The <i>Beit Yosef</i> explains that, at present, there is no person of a stature that we would not delay his burial in order to recite the <i>Shema</i> at its proper time. Therefore, the halachah is not in force. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> also omits reference to it.
The <i>Magen Avraham</i> mentions that the prohibition against burying someone close to the time of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> relates only to <i>Kri'at Shema</i> in the morning. However, in the early evening, one should first bury the body and then recite the <i>Shema</i>, or recite the <i>Shema</i> early enough to allow the burial to take place before nightfall so that the person will be buried as close to the day of his death as possible.

The people are accompanying the body simply as a token of honor for the dead person, but are not occupied in the performance of a mitzvah such that they would be exempt from <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 72:1 and <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 358:1 quote the Rambam's position.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 17b, states:
The bearers of the coffin, their replacements and those who in turn will relieve the replacements, the ones before the coffin and the ones after the coffin - the ones who are before it and are required to [carry] the coffin are exempt. Those who are after it, even if they are required to [carry] the coffin, are obligated [to recite the <i>Shema</i>].""
This certainly seems to differentiate between those before and after the coffin, and indicates clearly that those who have already carried the coffin are indeed obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i>, unlike the halachah written by the Rambam.
Rashi explains that those who have already carried the coffin are obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i>, even though they may be needed to carry it again, because they have already fulfilled their obligation.
There is, however, another version of the Mishnah. See <i>Tosafot</i> in <i>Berachot</i> 17b and most printed versions of the Mishnah (Rabbinic edition, Kahati, Mossad Harav Kook edition of the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah). It states:
The bearers of the coffin and their replacements and those who in turn will relieve the replacements, the ones before the coffin and the ones after the coffin - the ones who are required to [carry] the coffin - are exempt. And those who are not required to [carry] the coffin are obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i>.""
The Mishnah in this form can serve as the source for the Rambam's halachah. The ""are exempt"" term in the halachah refers back to all the cases written before it, including ""the ones after the coffin.""
The difference in the original Hebrew versions of the Mishnah is simply one word. Rashi's version:<br>

the Rambam's version:<br>

The Ra'avad understands, however, that the words ""inner line"" in the <i>beraita</i> refer to the inner circle - i.e., the family of the mourners. It is the Rambam's position which is most widely accepted.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rabbenu Yonah explains that not only the burial of the dead, but also the consoling of the mourners is part of the commandment of גמילות חסדים (acts of lovingkindness). In his commentary on <i>Mishnah Pe'ah</i> 1:1, the Rambam divides acts of lovingkindness into two categories: a) those one does with his money, such as charity,<br>
b) those one does with his body - e.g., comforting mourners and accompanying the dead to burial.
Rabbenu Yonah states explicitly that this is a Torah commandment. The Rambam, however, is of the opinion that burying the dead, comforting the mourners, and all acts of lovingkindness are Rabbinic commandments. In <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 14:1, he writes:
It is a positive commandment of Rabbinic origin to visit the sick, comfort those mourning, take out the dead, bring in the bride, accompany guests [from your house] and to involve oneself in those things necessary for burial - i.e., to carry [the coffin] on his shoulders, to walk before him, to eulogize him, to dig [the grave] and to bury him.
The Rambam's classification of these commandments as of Rabbinic origin creates a problem for us. How are we to understand the halachot we have just learned?
The Rambam has taught us that those involved in the burial of the dead and the comforting of the mourners are exempt from reciting the <i>Shema</i>, based on the principle that those involved in the performance of one commandment are exempt from another. According to Rabbenu Yonah, who understands גמילות חסד (acts of lovingkindness) to be Torah commandments, this is easily comprehended. However, according to the Rambam, how can involvement in a Rabbinic commandment exempt one from the fulfillment of a Torah obligation, especially one as central as <i>Kri'at Shema</i>?
The answer to this question depends on the continuation of <i>Hilchot Eivel</i>, <i>ibid.</i>:
Even though all these commandments are of Rabbinic origin, they are included [in the command] ואהבת לרעך כמוך (Love your fellow as yourself, Leviticus 19:18 . All those things that you would want others to do for you in the realm of Torah and commandments, you should do for your colleague.
Thus, the Rabbinic commandments regarding acts of lovingkindness are the specific ways established by the sages to express the Torah commandment of ""Love your fellow as yourself."" Accordingly, although these commandments are Rabbinic in origin, since their ultimate source is found in a Torah commandment, the rule that ""one performing one commandment is exempt from another"" applies to them as well.

Afterwards, they offer their condolences one by one, as they pass before the mourners (<i>Hilchot Aivel</i> 13:1,2). Others interpret the שורה as two lines facing each other. The mourners then walk between these two lines, and as they pass, the people offer their condolences.

The Rambam follows the majority position of the Sages. Rabbenu Asher accepts the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. However, <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>ibid.</i> 17b) explains that at present, our level of concentration has changed and all bridegrooms should recite the <i>Shema</i>. Any bridegroom who does not recite the <i>Shema</i> would be acting haughtily by intimating that usually he has a very high level of concentration. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 70:3 accepts <i>Tosafot's</i> position. (See also the commentary on Halachah 2.)
As mentioned above, a mourner should not recite the <i>Shema</i> for it is disrespectful to the deceased to imply that one could still concentrate on the <i>Shema</i> despite their passing.

This explanation is significant. The Mishnah (<i>Eduyot</i> 1:5) teaches us that a court does not have the jurisdiction to override the ruling of another court unless it is greater in wisdom and number - i.e., unless the scholars are of a greater stature and more numerous. There was no later court with the stature of Ezra's, and, therefore, no one had the authority to abolish Ezra's ruling (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).

R<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> I.e., even one in a state of ritual impurity may involve himself in Torah study and prayer, because the Torah is unaffected by his impurity (<i>Berachot</i>, <i>ibid.</i>).
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> differentiates between physical filth, which renders the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> impossible (as we learned in Chapter 3), and ritual impurity, which does not affect it.
Our awareness of the presence of physical filth produces a subjective response to its somewhat disgusting nature. This response, in turn, has ramifications regarding the honor of the Torah studied in such a place. Ritual impurity is, however, a wholly metaphysical reality, and that particular reality has no ability to affect the Torah.
<b>Rather, they stand in their state of purity forever, as [Jeremiah 23:29] states: ""Are not my words like fire, declares the Lord."" -</b> Thus, the differentiation made above has its basis, not on human logic, but on Divine decree. Deuteronomy 23:13 teaches: ""And your camp shall be holy,"" forbidding the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> in the presence of physical filth. In contrast, the verse from Jeremiah quoted above clearly implies the inability of ritual impurity to exert its influence over the words of Torah (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).
<b>Just as fire is incapable of becoming ritually impure, so, too, the words of Torah are never defiled. -</b> This decision alludes to a fundamental concept regarding the nature of Torah study. On one hand, we see Torah study as being associated with the student, as obvious from the law, <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 5:11, that allows a Torah scholar to forgo the honor due him. Although that honor is not being paid to him personally, but to the Torah knowledge he possesses, that Torah is considered his to the extent that he can forego the honor. Nevertheless, even while Torah is associated with the person studying it, its essential Godly nature remains intact to the extent that it cannot contract ritual impurity.

</i>.<br>This, too, is a bad path and it is forbidden to walk upon it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam explains that, at certain times, many of the pious adopted ascetic practices as a safeguard against excessive involvement in materialism. However, they never regarded such practices as a goal in their own right. Others observed their behavior and mistook asceticism for an end rather than a means to achieve the middle path.
From the Rambam's statements in <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, it would appear that there are two drawbacks to asceticism:<br>
a) It might lead a person to poor health, illness, and a lack of strength which would prevent him from serving God as the Rambam states in Halachah 3.<br>
b) A person might err and feel that he has fulfilled his obligation to serve God through these ascetic practices. As a result, he may never feel the need to dedicate himself to the service of God as He prescribed in the Torah.
There is a third disadvantage that is stressed heavily by the teachings of Kabbalah and Chassidut and may be hinted at by the Rambam's statements in the following halachot.
The <i>Zohar</i> (Vol. II, p. 42b) states that God created the world ""in order to let Himself be known."" Similarly, <i>Tanya</i> (Chapter 33) explains that God created the world because He desired to have a dwelling place in the lower worlds. Thus, a person who tends to otherworldliness and asceticism, defeats God's purpose in creation.
</i>. Whoever follows this path is called a sinner [as implied by Numbers 6:11's] statement concerning a nazarite: ""and he [the priest] shall make an atonement for him, for his having sinned regarding [his] soul<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> A nazarite is forbidden to become impure through any contact with a dead body for the extent of his nazarite vow. If he contracts such impurity, he is required to bring a special sin offering. See Numbers, Chapter 6, <i>Hilchot Nezirut</i>, Chapters 6-8.
</i>."" Our sages declared:<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Ta'anit</i> 11a. [Interestingly, the author of this statement, Rabbi Eliezer HaKfar, is also the author of the statement (<i>Avot</i>, <i>ibid.</i>) that ""envy, desire, and the pursuit of honor, drive a person from the world.""]
</i> If the nazarite who abstained only from wine requires atonement, how much more so does one who abstains from everything.<br><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
</i>Therefore, our Sages directed man to abstain only from those things which the Torah denies him and not to forbid himself permitted things by vows and oaths<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> One should not conclude that the Rambam completely disapproves of vows and oaths. At the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> (13:23), the Rambam states: ""Whoever takes a vow in order to stabilize his temperaments and correct his deeds, is zealous and praiseworthy.""
In <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i>, he gives examples of people who were excessively inclined to a particular quality who take vows to correct their faults (in a manner reminiscent of his advice in the beginning of Chapter 2 of these halachot). Rather, what the Rambam criticizes in our halachah is abstention for the sake of abstention.
</i> [of abstention]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Kiddushin</i> 4:12:
Rav Chizkiyah the priest said in the name of Rav: ""A person will ultimately be called to judgment for everything which his eye saw and which he did not taste.""<br>
Rav Lazar was concerned because of this teaching. He saved his pennies and would [purchase] and eat from every fruit once a year.
</i>. Thus, our Sages stated:<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Nedarim</i> 9:1
</i> Are not those things which the Torah has prohibited sufficient for you that you must forbid additional things to yourself?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam prefaces this statement with the following comment: ""Our Sages have made statements about this subject which are more marvelous than any others that I have ever seen.""
This general statement also refers to those who fast constantly. - In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, the Rambam also criticizes excessive fasting. He quotes the prophet, Zechariah, who questions the motives of the Jews' fasts (7:5): ""Was it for Me that you fasted?"" and exhorts them to ""Practice true justice, and show kindness and mercy every man to his brother"" as the proper service of God. To underscore this point, he concludes with the prophecy (<i>ibid.</i> 8:19) that even the public fasts will ultimately be transformed into festivals and days of rejoicing.
</i><br>This general statement also refers to those who fast constantly. They are not following a good path, [for] our Sages<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Ta'anit</i> 11a
</i> have forbidden a man to mortify himself by fasting<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The phrase ""to mortify himself"" is significant here. The Rambam (<i>Hilchot Ta'anit</i> 1:4; 1:9) himself mentions that the Sages commanded both the community and the individual to fast in times of distress.
The Rambam's statements have been questioned by the Rashba (Responsa 431 and 688) and by the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> based on <i>Nedarim</i> 10a. However, the commentaries note that Shmuel, the author of the statement in <i>Ta'anit</i>, also states (<i>Bava Kama</i> 91a) that one may fast. Here, the Rambam's statements are directed against self- mortification and asceticism and not against fasting per se.
Nevertheless, it must be noted that in <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i>, when the Rambam describes ""the paths of Teshuvah"" (3:4), he makes no mention of fasting.
</i>. Of all the above, and their like, Solomon directed and said: ""Do not be overly righteous and do not be overly clever; why make yourself desolate?"" (Ecclesiastes 7:16 <sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The midrashic works have not interpreted this verse in the manner suggested here. However, we find other Spanish Jewish Sages who followed this interpretation. See Duties of the Heart 3:25, Ibn Ezra in his commentary to Ecclesiastes.
Note that this verse uses the two terms - the righteous (<i>tzadik</i> and the wise (<i>chacham</i>) - which the Rambam has used to designate the man with a ideal traits.
The placement of this halachah raises questions. One might have expected it to appear in the previous chapter which deals with other excesses and deviations from the middle path. However, it is possible to explain that, in its present position, it serves as a preface to the following halachot which explain how our service of God and connection to Him can be established within the context of our material reality. Thus, when viewed as a totality, this chapter emphasizes how Judaism desires that religious fulfillment be found within the context of our day to day life, rather than in otherworldly ""spiritual"" activities.

Human Dispositions 3.2,"A person should direct his heart and the totality of his behavior to one goal<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, Chapter 5, the Rambam addresses himself to many of the concepts mentioned in this and the following halachah. He begins that chapter with the declaration:
A person must control all the powers of his soul with [his] intellect... and concentrate on a single goal at all times: To comprehend God, blessed be He, to the extent that man can know Him.<br>
All of his activities: what he does, the way he rests, and what he says should lead to this goal.
</i>, becoming aware of God, blessed be He<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Literally, the term means ""The Name,"" but obviously, it refers to the Master of The Name.
</i>. The [way] he rests, rises, and speaks should all be directed to this end<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In the previous Halachah, the Rambam condemned asceticism and otherworldliness. In this Halachah, he stresses the desired intent of our worldly involvement, to know God.
In Chapter 1, Halachah 6, the Rambam introduced a religious component into the development of an ethical personalty, pointing out that we must ""imitate"" God's qualities. In this halachah, he adds a further point. All of man's actions are to be taken in an atmosphere of God-awareness.
The concept of knowing God recalls the opening Halachah of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>:
The fundamental [principle] upon which all fundamental [principles are based] and the pillar of the wisdoms is to know that there is a Primary Being.
In both halachot, the Rambam emphasizes how the knowledge of God is not an abstract, intellectual past-time, but rather an all- encompassing commitment, embracing every aspect of our experience. Torah living does not confine God to the synagogue or the house of study, but provides us with a means to relate to Him within every dimension of our lives (<i>Al HaTeshuvah</i>).
For example: when involved in business dealings or while working for a wage, he should not think solely of gathering money. - i.e., he should not view the acquisition of money as an end in its own right.
</i>.<br>For example: when involved in business dealings or while working for a wage, he should not think solely of gathering money. Rather, he should do these things<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as a means...
</i>, so that he will be able to obtain that which the body needs - food, drink, a home and a wife<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam has just laid down the principle that all of man's actions are to be carried out in a framework of awareness of God. Yet, to exemplify this principle, he speaks not of awareness of God, but of avoiding indulgence and maintaining one's health. The Rambam introduces the maintenance of health as an immediate - and intermediary - goal which will provide us with a program of concrete action.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> However, as the Rambam continues in the following Halachah, the maintenance of physical well-being is also not an end in its own right. Rather, it is also only a means for the service of God.
Similarly, when he eats, drinks and engages in intimate relations, he should not intend to do these things solely for pleasure - In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam also uses the expression ""solely for pleasure,"" indicating that the Rambam does not advocate a life without physical pleasure. (Note also the passage from the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 7:4, quoted below.)
There is nothing wrong with enjoying food, for example, as long as one does so within the framework of maintaining health. Indeed, in <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, the Rambam emphasizes how one may use pleasure to encourage himself to perform the acts necessary to maintain his health.
</i>.<br>Similarly, when he eats, drinks and engages in intimate relations, he should not intend to do these things solely for pleasure to the point where he will eat and drink only that which is sweet to the palate and engage in intercourse for pleasure. Rather, he should take care to eat and drink only in order to be healthy in body and limb.<br>Therefore, he should not eat all that the palate desires like a dog or a donkey<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam states: ""In such an activity, a person is just like an animal. It is not an action man undertakes because he is a man, but rather, one that he undertakes because he is an animal.""
</i>. Rather, he should eat what is beneficial for the body, be it bitter or sweet. Conversely, he should not eat what is harmful to the body, even though it is sweet to the palate<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam gives a full list of proper eating habits in the following chapter. Here, he cites only selected examples:
</i>. For example: a person with a warm constitution should not eat meat or honey, nor drink wine, as Solomon has stated in a parable: The eating of much honey is not good (Proverbs 25:27 . One should drink endive juice, even though it is bitter, f<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> this is given as a remedy for a warm liver constitution (Maimonides' Medical Aphorisms).
</i>or then, he will be eating and drinking for medical reasons only, in order to become healthy and be whole - for a man cannot exist without eating and drinking.<br>Similarly, he should not have intercourse except to keep his body healthy<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Chapter 4, Halachah 19, for a discussion of this matter.
</i> and to preserve the [human] race<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Ra'avad mentions a third reason for intercourse - granting one's wife her conjugal rights The Rambam does not mention that issue here because, in these chapters he focuses on those behaviors in which a person engages voluntarily as an expression of his personal desires. He discusses a man's conjugal obligations later in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i>, Chapter 14 (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).
</i>. Therefore, he should not engage in intercourse whenever he feels desire<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See also Chapter 5, Halachah 4, which discusses the frequency of intimate relations.
</i>, but when he knows that he requires a seminal emission for medical reasons or in order to preserve the [human] race.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his commentary to the mishnah, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 7:4, the Rambam writes:
The intent of intimate relations is the preservation of the species and not only pleasure. The aspect of pleasure was only introduced in order to arouse the creations toward that ultimate goal...<br>
The proof of this is that desire and pleasure cease after ejaculation for this was the entire goal for which our instincts were aroused. If the goal were pleasure, satisfaction would continue as long as man desired.
</i>"
Human Dispositions 3.3,"A person who accustoms himself to live by [the rules of] medicine does not follow a proper path if his sole intention is that his entire body and limbs be healthy<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam puts the maintenance of health mentioned in the previous halachah into proper perspective. It is not to be pursued as a goal in its own right. Rather, it should be appreciated as merely a means to enable one to reach an awareness of God. The Rambam develops this idea at length in <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> Chapter 5. There, he states:
A person should have the intention while eating, drinking, having intercourse, sleeping, awakening, moving, and resting, [that he does so] for the purpose of his physical health alone.<br>
His intention in [seeking] physical health should be to prepare for the soul healthy and sound vessels to acquire wisdom and intellectual and emotional advantages until he reaches the goal of [knowing God].
</i> and that he have children who will do his work and toil for him<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., though procreation is a valid reason for intimate relations, one's intent in procreation should not be selfish.
</i>. Rather, he should have the intent that his body be whole and strong, in order for his inner soul to be upright so that [it will be able] to know God<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam also elaborates on the interrelation between the attainment of physical health and spiritual achievement in the Guide to the Perplexed, Vol. III, Chapter 27.
Heath is necessary as part of one's process of striving to know God...
</i>. For it is impossible to understand and become knowledgeable in the wisdoms when one is starving or sick, or when one of his limbs pains him<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Maggid of Mezeritch would say: ""A small hole in the body creates a large hole in the soul.""
</i>. [Similarly,] one should intend to have a son [with the hope that] perhaps he will be a wise and great man in Israel.<br>T<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is the desired goal in procreation - to perpetuate the nation, not only physically, but also spiritually.
Thus, whoever walks in such a path all his days will be serving God constantly; even in the midst of his business dealings, even during intercourse for his intent in all matters is to fulfill his needs so that his body be whole to serve God. - In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam associates such behavior with Deuteronomy 6:5: ""Love God, your Lord, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might."" The course of action described enables us to dedicate every aspect of our being toward the love of God as prescribed by this verse.
Even when he sleeps, if he retires with the intention that his mind and body rest, lest he take ill and be unable to serve God because he is sick, then his sleep is service to the Omnipresent, blessed be He. - Perhaps, the Rambam uses this name for God to convey the concept that just as God's presence pervades all existence, our service of Him must encompass all aspects of our lives.
On this matter, our Sages - <i>Avot</i> 2:15
</i>hus, whoever walks in such a path all his days will be serving God constantly; even in the midst of his business dealings, even during intercourse for his intent in all matters is to fulfill his needs so that his body be whole to serve God.<br>Even when he sleeps, if he retires with the intention that his mind and body rest, lest he take ill and be unable to serve God because he is sick, then his sleep is service to the Omnipresent, blessed be He.<br>On this matter, our Sages have directed and said: ""And all your deeds should be for the sake of Heaven<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam elaborates upon this statement as follows:
Our Sages included this entire concept in the most succinct expression possible... When one meditates on this concise statement, one wonders how they could describe in its entirety an idea so awesome that many books were written about it without encompassing it totally. Without a doubt, [the statement] was made with Divine inspiration.
The commentaries note that <i>Beitzah</i> 16a stated concerning Hillel: ""All of his deeds were for the sake of Heaven,"" and associates that with the following narrative in <i>VaYikra Rabbah</i> 34:3.
Hillel bid his students farewell. They asked him where he was going He told them that he was going to perform a mitzvah. They discovered that he was going to the bathhouse and asked him to explain his previous statements. He told them: Since the human body is created in the image of God, it is a mitzvah to wash oneself.
</i>."" This is what Solomon declared in his wisdom: ""Know Him in all your ways<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Avot D'Rabbi Natan</i> 17:7 also associates the above statement with this Biblical quote. <i>Berachot</i> 63b describes this verse as: ""A small passage upon which all the fundamentals of Torah depend."" Note also the Rambam's comments in <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, <i>ibid.</i>
<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. III, notes that the rules of Torah scholarship would have called for the quotation of the Biblical verse before the quote from our Sages. However, the Rambam chooses this sequence because it reflects a progression in the service of God.
""All of your deeds should be for the Sake of Heaven"" implies that the deeds are not themselves holy, merely that they are directed toward a Godly intent. ""Know Him in all your ways"" implies that a bond with God can be established within the context of our physical activity itself.
</i> and He will straighten your paths"" (Proverbs 3:6 <sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Iggerot HaKodesh</i>, the Ramban interprets the state described in this clause as a natural product of the elevated rung of service mentioned in the previous clause. When a person develops an all encompassing bond with God, Divine light will illuminate all his paths.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.1","It is a positive commandment from the Torah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sefer Hamitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 170) and <i>Sefer Hachinuch</i> (Mitzvah 405) count this mitzvah as one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.
</i> to hear the sounding of the shofar<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The mitzvah is not the blowing of the shofar, as might be inferred from the verse, but rather listening to the blowing. The blessing recited before the fulfillment of this mitzvah, praising God for commanding us ""to listen to the sounding of the shofar (Chapter 3, Halachah 10),"" emphasizes this principle.
Accordingly, the Rambam writes (Chapter 1, Halachah 8) that a person who blows a shofar without hearing it does not fulfill the mitzvah. Conversely, he writes (Responsum 78) that if the mitzvah were the blowing of the shofar, a person who heard it being blown, but did not blow it himself, would not fulfill his obligation.
It must be noted that the published text of the siddur of Rav Amram Gaon states that the mitzvah is ""to sound the shofar."" Also, concerning the blowing of the shofar in the <i>yovel</i>, the Rambam himself writes that: ""it is a positive mitzvah to blow the shofar on the tenth of Tishre... (<i>Hilchot Shemitah V'Yovel</i> 10:10).""

</i>s a bent ram's horn. All shofarot other than that of a ram are unacceptable<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's opinion is based on the statement of Rav Levi (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 26b), who declares: ""The mitzvah of Rosh Hashanah is to be performed with bent [shofarot],"" implying the use of a sheep's or ram's horn for that is their natural shape.
The Ra'avad, Rabbenu Asher, and many other Rishonim maintain that Rav Levi desired to designate the type of shofar which is most preferable to use, but did not intend to disqualify the horns of other animals. Their view is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 586:1), which states that it is desirable to use the horn of a ram. However, if that is not possible, the horn of any animal may be used. The only exceptions are the horns of a cow and some wild animals whose horns are single, solid entities (Ramban).
</i>.<br>Even though the sounding of the shofar on Rosh HaShanah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The above verse merely mentions יום תרועה - ""a day of sounding"" - without stating what must be sounded.
</i> is not explicitly mentioned in the Torah [it was derived by our Sages in the following manner]. Concerning the <i>yovel</i>, [Leviticus 25:9] states: ""You shall make a proclamation, sounding the shofar... you shall proclaim with the shofar."" The oral tradition e<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> An analogy (גזרה שוה) is drawn between the two verses, to teach that the same type of ""sounding"" is required on both occasions.

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 33b

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.2","In the Temple<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As will be explained in the commentary to Chapter 2, Halachah 8, and Chapter 7, Halachah 13, in certain contexts the Rambam interprets the expression במקדש - literally, ""in the holy place"" - as referring to the entire city of Jerusalem. (See also the Rambam's commentary to the mishnah, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 4:1.) However, in the present context, it refers to the Temple alone. Thus, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 27a states that the shofar was sounded in this manner only ""on the Temple Mount and at the eastern gate.""

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.3","<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Hilchot Me'ilah</i> 5:16, the Rambam writes:

Concerning the sound, sight, and smell of consecrated objects: We should not derive benefit from them. However, all the implications of the prohibition against using them for mundane purposes do not apply.

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The prohibitions forbidding use of consecrated articles for mundane purposes...
</i>At the outset, we should not blow a shofar of idol worship<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> For it is not appropriate to use such a shofar for a mitzvah.

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that this refers to a shofar belonging to a gentile that was used in the worship of idols, or a shofar which was itself worshiped as an idol. However, as will be explained, if the shofar of idol worship belonged to a Jew or if it was made from the horn of an animal that was sacrificed to an idol, even after the fact, its use is not acceptable.
</i>. [In contrast,] should one sound a shofar belonging to an apostate city, one has not fulfilled one's obligation<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 28a explains that the difference between a shofar of idol worship and one of an apostate city is that all the property within the latter must be destroyed. Since ultimately this shofar must be burnt, even before it is actually destroyed it is no longer considered to be an existent entity. Thus, we may not use it on Rosh HaShanah, because a shofar used for the mitzvah must be of a specific size - slightly larger than one's hand, as mentioned in Halachah 5 - and a nonexistent entity has no size at all.
A shofar of idol worship must also be destroyed. However, should the gentile negate its connection to idol worship before it is acquired by a Jew, it need not be destroyed, as stated in <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 8:8. Since there is a possibility that it will not have to be destroyed, it is considered to be an existent entity and may be used for the mitzvah.
This principle applies only to aspects of idol worship belonging to a gentile. It is impossible to negate the connection between an idol worshiped by a Jew and its forbidden nature. (See <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 8:9.) Hence, a Jew's shofar of idol worship may not be used. Similarly, if a Jew has acquired a shofar of idol worship that belonged to a gentile before the latter negated its connection to idol worship, the Jew is no longer capable of negating this connection. Therefore, such a shofar may not be used on Rosh HaShanah.
Also, once an animal has been sacrificed to an idol, there is no possibility of negating its connection to idol worship. Hence, its horn may not be used as a shofar.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 586:3-4) quotes all the above laws as halachah. The Ramah relates that certain authorities recommend not using even a gentile's shofar of idol worship unless we know that he negated its connection with idol worship before Rosh HaShanah begins.

Rabbenu Manoach and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cite other examples from <i>Nedarim</i> 13b-15a, where the Sages differentiate between sound and material entities.
The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:1) derives this law as follows:

Everyone agrees that a stolen lulav is unacceptable. What is the difference between a shofar and a lulav?
Rabbi Yosse responded: ""Concerning a lulav, [Leviticus 23:40] states: 'You shall take for yourself,' implying that only 'your own' is acceptable. In contrast, [Numbers 29:1] states: 'It shall be a day of blowing for you,' implying that regardless [of the nature of the shofar used, the blowing shall be 'for you']"".
Rabbi Eliezer explained: ""There, [concerning the lulav,] one must perform the mitzvah with the lulav itself. Here, [concerning the shofar,] one performs the mitzvah with its sound.""

Nevertheless, because a sin is associated with this mitzvah, Ashkenazic custom is that no blessing should be recited before blowing such a shofar (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 586:4).
</i>.<br>Similarly, a shofar from an<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> animal consecrated as an...
</i> <i>olah</i> offering should not be sounded, b<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> מעילה </i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Once an animal is consecrated as an <i>olah</i> offering, no part of its body may be used any other purpose. Therefore, we should not use such a shofar from such an animal for any purpose whatsoever.
This halachah applies before the blood from the sacrifice has been offered on the altar. Afterwards, the skin and horns of the animal become the property of the priests and may be used for mundane purposes (Rashi, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 28a).
</i>ut if one sounds it, he fulfills his obligation, because the laws of מעילה do not apply with regard to sound alone. If you ask: ""Behold, he has derived benefit from hearing [the shofar's] sound?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rashi (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, ibid.) states: ""the mitzvot were not given to the Jewish people for their enjoyment, but rather as a yoke.""
This concept has relevance in the ethical, as well as the halachic sphere. In the tenth chapter of <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i>, the Rambam writes:

One who serves [God] out of love occupies himself with the Torah and the mitzvot...for no ulterior motive, not because of fear that evil will occur, nor in order to acquire benefit...
The great Sages would command the more understanding and brilliant among their students in private: ""Do not be like servants who serve their master for the sake of receiving a gift. Rather, since he is the Master, it is fitting to serve Him""; i.e., serve [Him] out of love.

The above is not intended to imply that a person should not feel happy and fulfilled in the service of God. Quite the contrary; indeed, the Rambam concludes these halachot (Chapter 8, Halachah 15) with a description of the importance of happiness in the service of God. However, the intent is that the happiness should be a byproduct and not the goal of the service. We should be totally committed to fulfilling God's will, and the expression of that commitment should generate satisfaction and joy.
<b>Based on this concept -</b> that mitzvot were not given for our benefit;
<b>a person who vows not to derive benefit from a shofar may use it to blow the teki'ot required to fulfill the mitzvah. -</b> Doing so is not considered a violation of his vow.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 586:5) advises that the person who took the vow should not blow the shofar himself [because many consider that to be a pleasurable experience (<i>Taz</i>)]. Rather, he should hear the <i>teki'ot</i> from a colleague.
Also, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid.) notes that if a person specifically states that he vows not to listen to a colleague's <i>teki'ot</i>, he may not hear that person blow the shofar on Rosh HaShanah, because a vow (<i>neder</i>) can also negate a mitzvah. (See <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> 3:6-8.)
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though the laws of מעילה do not apply to sound, there is still a Rabbinic prohibition against benefiting from the sound of consecrated articles. Therefore, one might think that we would be unable to fulfill the mitzvah with such a shofar (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>). Accordingly, the Rambam explains:
</i>"" - mitzvot were not given for our benefit.<br>Based on this concept, a person who vows not to derive benefit from a shofar may use it to blow the <i>teki'ot</i> required to fulfill the mitzvah."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.4","Regarding a shofar to be used on Rosh HaShanah: It is forbidden to violate the festival laws to obtain it. This applies<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> not only when obtaining the shofar requires the violation of a <i>melachah</i> (forbidden labor) prohibited by the Torah, but

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 21:1, the Rambam defines <i>sh'vut</i> as a prohibition instituted by the Sages because a particular activity resembles one forbidden as a <i>melachah</i> by Torah law, or because performing it may cause one to perform a <i>melachah</i>.
Though these prohibitions are of Rabbinic origin, the Sages reinforced the power of their decrees and equated them with Torah law. Hence, just as one may not violate a <i>melachah</i> forbidden by the Torah to obtain a shofar, so, too, it is forbidden to violate a <i>sh'vut</i> forbidden by Rabbinic law (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). [Nevertheless, note the clarification of this principle in Chapter 2, Halachah 6.]

If there is a shofar in a treetop or across a river - and that is the only shofar available - one may not climb the tree or swim across the water to bring it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> lest one prepare a swimming aid (ibid., 23:5).

Since a craftsman's knife is not being used, cutting the shofar off is not forbidden by Torah law. Nevertheless, the Rambam uses the expression ""needless to say,"" because such an activity bears a closer resemblance to one forbidden by Torah law than those mentioned previously.

</i><br>[The rationale for the above is:] Blowing the shofar fulfills a positive commandment<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as stated in Halachah 1.
</i>, while [the observance of] the festivals fulfills both a positive and a negative commandment<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Yom Tov</i> 1:2, the Rambam writes:

Whoever rests from a <i>melachah</i> categorized as ""work"" on one of [these days] fulfills a positive commandment, because the Torah describes them as ""days of rest""... if one performs a <i>melachah</i> that is not intended to prepare food,... one negates the performance of a positive commandment and transgresses a negative commandment, as [Leviticus 23:8] states: ""You shall not perform any servile work.""

</i>. The observance of a positive commandment does not negate the observance of both a positive and negative commandment<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though the performance of a positive commandment overrides a negative commandment (<i>Yevamot</i> 3b), that applies only when the negative commandment is not reinforced by a positive commandment, as in the case at hand.

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is a quote from <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 27b. The Rabbis have noted that, in contrast to a crack along the shofar's width, in this context no minimum figure is mentioned with regard to the portion of the shofar remaining uncracked. Two contrasting interpretations are offered to explain the difference.
Some maintain that as long as the entire length (or the majority of the length) of the shofar is not cracked, the shofar is not disqualified. Others maintain that even the slightest crack along the length of the shofar disqualifies it, because the pressure of the blowing will cause the crack to grow until, ultimately, the entire shofar will be cracked (Rabbenu Asher; <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 586:8).
Concerning <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i>, both the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (586:8) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (586:43) write that when no other shofar is available, one may rely on the first opinion. Nevertheless, even the latter opinion does not disqualify a shofar that is cracked lengthwise if it is tied firmly so that the crack will not expand, or if the shofar is heated and the crack closed. Some opinions also allow such a shofar to be used if the crack is plugged closed with other substances.

This point is not accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid., 7), which emphasizes that if the hole is not plugged, the shofar is kosher even though its sound has changed.

Rabbenu Asher interprets the passage differently. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid.) favors the Rambam's interpretation, but states that under difficult circumstances, when no other shofar is available, one may rely on Rabbenu Asher's interpretation.
<b>If one [merely] perforated the insides of the horn, -</b> the bonelike tissue inside the horn

However, since this tissue is considered to be part of the horn itself, the shofar is acceptable.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid., 586:15) quotes this law, but also adds that if one removed this tissue from the horn and then hollowed it out, the tissue would be unacceptable for use as a shofar.

At present, there is a more common application of this principle. A person who hears the shofar through a microphone does not fulfill the mitzvah. In addition to the difficulties involved with the use of the microphone on a festival, there is a more essential problem. The listeners are not hearing the sound of the shofar, but rather a second sound, produced by a different mechanism. The microphone converts the sound waves of the shofar to electronic signals; these are then amplified and converted to a different set of sound waves. Hence, by hearing such a sound, we cannot fulfill the mitzvah obligating us to hear a shofar's call.

2. There are no fruits that are eaten as <i>terumah</i> according to Torah law. (It is wine and oil, not grapes and olives, which carry such an obligation.) Therefore, the Sages did not impose an obligation to wash before eating from such food if it was not consecrated (Rabbenu Yonah, <i>Berachot</i> 8).<br>
3. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 181:1), the Ra'avad, and others offer a different rationale for this washing, quoting <i>Berachot</i> 53a's interpretation of Leviticus 11:44: ""'Make yourselves holy,' this refers to the first washing; 'And you shall be holy,' this refers to the second washing.""

Blessings 6.4,"To what point should one's hands be washed? To the wrist<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Although Rabbenu Asher maintains that it is only necessary to wash to the point of connection between the fingers and the hand, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 161:4) accepts the Rambam's decision. Nevertheless, when a person has only a limited supply of water, he may rely on Rabbenu Asher's opinion (Shulchan Aruch HaRav 161:8; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 161:22).

The other authorities maintain that as long as the vessel from which the water is poured contains a <i>revi'it</i>, two people may have their hands washed from it. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160:13) accepts the latter view.
Significantly, the Rambam mentions washing the hands only once before partaking of food. In <i>Hilchot Mikveot</i> 11:3, where he mentions the washing of the hands within the context of ritual purity, he mentions the need to wash hands twice: once to purify the hands, and once to wash off the water used to purify them. (See Halachah 10 and commentary.) In these halachot, he makes no mention of a second washing, seeming to imply that it is unnecessary to do so. (Rav Kapach adds that it is customary in certain Yemenite groups to wash only once before meals, and bases this practice on the Rambam's decision.)
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> and the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 162:2) mention washing the hands two or three times before partaking of a meal. This is the accepted practice in almost all communities at present.

A <i>revi'it</i> is significant in this context because immersion in a <i>revi'it</i> of water is enough to restore ritual purity to a utensil according to Torah law. The Rabbis, however, obligated the use of a <i>mikveh</i> of 40 <i>se'ah</i> for all ritual immersions.

Any substance that intervenes [between one's flesh and the water] and disturbs one nullifies the immersion, even if it covers only a minor portion of one's flesh.... Any substance that covers the major portion of one's flesh nullifies the immersion, even though it does not disturb one.

5. I.e., whether before a meal or in preparation for prayer.<br>
6. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that this expression indicates that it is not necessary to wash one's hands a second time (see the commentary on the previous halachah) or to dry them before partaking of the food. When washing one's hands for food, this is required because the water used for the first washing that remains on the hands becomes ritually impure. In contrast, the water that remains on one's hands after immersion in a <i>mikveh</i> is pure. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 159:19.)<br>
7. A <i>mikveh</i> must have at least 40 <i>se'ah</i> of water that has flowed into it by natural means. In contemporary measurements, 331 liters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, and 648 liters according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>.
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that this applies only to water that does not emanate from a natural spring. When a person immerses his hands in such a spring, all that is necessary is that there be sufficient water to cover his hands. (See also <i>Hilchot Mikveot</i> 9:8.)
Significantly, Rabbenu Yonah maintains that it is acceptable to immerse one's hands in a <i>mikveh</i> containing even less than 40 <i>se'ah</i>. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 159:14) accepts this view, although the Ramah favors the Rambam's position.
8. The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, and maintains that one may immerse one's hands in water poured into a pool in the ground. He supports his position by referring to the immersion of a <i>ba'al keri</i> (see <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 4:4-5), which is acceptable even in such pool. (See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Mikveot</i> 8:1.) Nevertheless, most authorities accept the Rambam's decision. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 159:23; <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 159.)<br>
 9. See Halachot 7-9.<br>
10. See Halachot 4 and 10.<br>
11. See Halachot 11-12. The Rashba quotes the <i>Halachot Gedolot</i> as explaining that it is necessary to wash with a vessel, because the washing of hands is derived from the sanctification of the priest's hands in the Temple.<br>
12. See Halachot 13-14.<br>
13. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160) states that this concept is derived from the laws of the <i>ki'or</i> (the basin in the Temple from which the priests washed their hands). If its water changed color, it could no longer be used.<br>
14. E.g., ink or another coloring fell into it.<br>
15. It became rusty from a metal container. Note, however, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 160:1 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 160:22, which state that water that has become murky from mud or dirt is acceptable, because even this is often the color of natural stream water.
If after water was disqualified because of an abnormal color, its color reverts to the norm, it can be used to wash one's hands (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 160:1; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 160:5).
16. See <i>Hilchot Rotzeach USh'mirat HaNefesh</i> 11:6-16, which discusseshe prohibition of water left uncovered. This prohibition was enacted out of fear of the possibility that a poisonous snake or the like released venom into the water.<br>
17. <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 30b states that washing with such water could be dangerous lest the venom seep into cuts or sores or even through the body's pores. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160) notes that since the presence of poisonous snakes and the like is no longer widespread, the prohibition against drinking - and hence, washing with - such water need not be observed at present. This ruling is accepted by the later authorities.<br>
18. The Rambam is implying that the water in a <i>mikveh</i> or in a natural stream remains acceptable for washing although it was used for other tasks (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>
19. If, however, the bread fell into the water accidentally, the water is not disqualified (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 160:2; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 160:8).<br>
20. The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160:2) states that even if the baker washed his hands in the water, the water does not become unacceptable. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> (160:3) refutes this ruling. His opinion is accepted by the later authorities.<br>
 21. Slightly murky water is acceptable, as mentioned above. The determining factor is whether or not a dog will drink from the water.<br>
22. Since a <i>mikveh</i> containing such water is acceptable for the immersion of one's entire body, it is surely acceptable for the immersion of hands, which is only a Rabbinic commandment.<br>
23. These hot springs have a high mineral content and are very bitter.<br>
24. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> interprets this as referring to a stream that was diverted into a trench that does not contain forty <i>se'ah</i>. Although logically, this would be acceptable for the immersion of hands, the Sages forbade using such water, lest one also immerse one's hands in a container of water. Significantly, in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160:7), Rav Yosef Karo adds a further point, that the water was cut off from its source.<br>
25. I.e., the washing before partaking of bread.<br>
26. I.e., the washing after the meal (see Halachah 17); alternatively, the second pouring of water over one's hands, as mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 4. Note the explanation of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>.<br>
 27. In both instances, one must pour at least a <i>revi'it</i> of water over one's hands in a single pouring. In the first instance, while the water is being poured one gradually moves one's hands under the water, while in the second instance, one pours hurriedly, but forcefully, over the entire hand at once.<br>
28. I.e., several people stand with their hands outstretched, and a person passes in front of them pouring water over their hands.<br>
29. Although the water first passes over the hands of one person, it is still acceptable for the person whose hands are held below, because as long as it contains the required quantity and comes in one continuous stream, it does not become impure.
Nevertheless, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 160:16 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 160:68,72 state that the two people must originally have the intention to wash their hands as one, and must hold their hands close together. Otherwise, it is considered as if the second person washed with the water that was rendered impure by the first person's washing.
30. Note the difference of opinion on this issue between the Rambam and the other Halachic authorities mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 4.

Thus, they are no more than an axe in the hands of a wood-chopper, and should not worshiped or served.

The Rambam, however, does not mention this perspective in these halachot, nor in <i>Hilchot Melachim</i>, Chapter 9, where he discusses the prohibition against the worship of false gods as it affects gentiles. [In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive commandment 2), however, he states ""Israel is commanded regarding the unification of God""; from which it could be inferred that gentiles need not believe in this concept and can combine their worship of God with other powers.] All authorities agree that such worship is forbidden for Jews.

In the following halachah and in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 4:7), the Rambam mentions the second view. It is, however, unclear if this was the original intent of the star-worshipers or whether this was a later development.

He included philosophical and historical points only when they are halachot, directives for our behavior. In this light, this entire chapter seems unnecessary.
This difficulty can be resolved based on Chapter 2, Halachah 3, which states that it is forbidden to entertain thoughts of idol worship. Hence, in order to know which thoughts are forbidden, the Rambam feels it necessary to describe the entire thought process which led people to worship idols (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 20).
The phenomenon described by the Rambam does not belong entirely to the past. Although, at present, bowing down to the ""stars and spheres"" is not very common - although it has been renewed by some cultists - the theoretical premise that motivated the ancients to serve the stars is still followed by many. Is it all that uncommon to find people who compromise their service of God in expectation of receiving benefits by following what they perceive as the natural order?

Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 1.2,"After many years passed, there arose people - false prophets<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Thus, this represents a second stage in the spread of idol worship. At first - as explained in Halachah 1 - star worship was not institutionalized, but was practiced by individuals because of their mistaken conceptions.
The second phase involved the development of religious institutions and set modes of worship. The leaders, however, still recognized God and attributed the instructions to worship the stars to Him. In the third stage - as the latter portion of this halachah states - people would worship the stars and idols without any awareness of God.

See also the Guide for the Perplexed (Vol. II, Chapter 36) where the Rambam describes how people can be overcome by their powers of imagination to the extent that they - as do others who see them in such a trance - think of themselves as prophets, although, in fact, they received no Divine influence.

</i>.<br>He would inform them of a form that he had conceived, and tell them that this is the image of the particular star, claiming that this was revealed to him in a prophetic vision<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> With these statements, the Rambam explains how people began to worship statues and idols. Since the star was far away and could not be perceived as more than a twinkling dot in the sky, the people wanted a more tangible image which they could relate to. The ""prophets"" obliged and devised forms for statues to serve as talismans to bring down influence from these stars.

<b>Chanoch -</b> Note Genesis 5:22: ""And Chanoch walked with God.""
<b>Metushelach -</b> Though his righteousness is not mentioned explicitly in the Torah, it is mentioned by our Sages in a number of places - e.g., <i>Yalkut Shimeoni, Bereshit</i> 42, which states: ""Metushelach was a completely righteous man.""
<b>Noach -</b> See Genesis 6:9: ""And Noach was a righteous man, perfect in his generation.""

Though he was a child, he began to think [incessantly] throughout the day and night, wondering: How is it possible for the sphere to continue to revolve without having anyone controlling it?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note the <i>Midrash HaGadol</i> (<i>Parashat Lech Lecha</i>), which explains that Abraham questioned: Why should we bow down to idols, gods that we ourselves make? We should bow to the earth, for it produces crops that sustain us.
Therefore, he began to worship the earth. Then he saw that the earth needs rain, and began to worship the sky. Later, he saw that the most brilliant creation in the sky was the sun, and began to worship it. Afterwards, when the sun set and the moon rose, he began to worship the moon. When the sun rose the next morning, he did not know what to do. He did not see which was stronger: the sun or the moon. So Abraham continued in a quandary, questioning who was the true God.
</i> Who is causing it to revolve? Surely, it does not cause itself to revolve<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Interestingly, in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:5, the Rambam uses the same concept as a proof for the existence of God.
He had no teacher, nor was there anyone to inform him. -<i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 61:1 elaborates on the lack of instruction that was available to Abraham.
Note the Ra'avad and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, who question why Noach, Shem, and Ever (all of whom were alive at this time) did not try to nullify the worship of idols and why they did not instruct Abraham. They offer two explanations. The first is that they were afraid and hid from the idolaters. (See <i>Midrash Tehillim</i> 118. Note, however, teachings which state that these righteous men also protested the worship of false gods, <i>Tanna Devei Eliyahu Rabba</i>, Chapters 20 and 25.)
Alternatively, Shem and Ever lived in the land of Canaan, while Abraham lived in Babylon. The question remains, however, why did Abraham not seek out these righteous men (<i>Kinat Eliyahu</i>).
</i>.<br>He had no teacher, nor was there anyone to inform him. Rather, he was mired in Ur Kasdim among the foolish idolaters. His father, mother, and all the people [around him] were idol worshipers<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Indeed, our Sages relate that his father had a shop where idols were sold.
</i>, and he would worship with them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 39:8, which states that Abraham was always worried that God would not absolve him from his sin of worshiping idols.
</i>. [However,] his heart was exploring and [gaining] understanding.<br>Ultimately, he appreciated the way of truth a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> an ethical approach to behavior, which reflected his spiritual awareness
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> an awareness of God
</i>nd understood the path of righteousness through his accurate comprehension. He realized that there was one God who controlled the sphere, that He created everything, and that there is no other God among all the other entities<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> These are the fundamental principles of the Jewish faith, as explained in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:1-6.
</i>. He knew that the entire world was making a mistake. What caused them to err was their service of the stars and images, which made them lose awareness of the truth<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Their worship of idols dulled their sensitivity to spirituality to the point where they lost all awareness of God.
</i>.<br>Abraham was forty years old when he became aware of his Creator<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 64:4, which mentions two opinions regarding when Abraham became aware of God: one when he was three and one when he was forty eight. It is possible that the Rambam's text of the Midrash read ""forty"" instead of ""forty eight.""
As explained above, the opinions are not necessarily contradictory. Abraham's process of inquiry could have begun at age three, while at forty he gained greater understanding, and at forty eight, he achieved an even higher level of awareness.
<i>Avot</i> 5:21 states: ""At forty, one achieves understanding."" By associating Abraham's apreciation of the Creator with this age, the Rambam implies that this awareness can come as a product of our own thought and meditation.
</i>. When he recognized and knew Him<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Bereshit Rabbah</i> 39:1 explains Abraham's process of thought with a parable. A person saw a brightly lit palace. He wondered: Could this palace exist without an owner? Immediately, the owner revealed himself to him. Similarly, Abraham wondered: Is it possible for the world to exist without one who controls? Immediately, God revealed himself to him.
</i>, he began to formulate replies to the inhabitants of Ur Kasdim and debate with them, telling them that they were not following a proper path<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> by serving the stars and idols.
</i>.<br>He broke their idols and began to teach the people that it is fitting to serve only the God of the world<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Our Sages relate that after breaking his father's idols, he put a stick in the hands of the largest idol. When his father asked him why he destroyed the idols, he replied that he didn't do it; the idol holding the stick did.
His father curtly dismissed his reply: ""That idol is only metal. It cannot do anything,"" he roared at his son.
""If so, why do you worship it?"" Abraham replied.
</i>. To Him [alone] is it fitting to bow down, sacrifice, and offer libations, so that the people of future [generations] would recognize Him<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's words imply that the value of offering sacrifices at this time (before the Torah commanded that they be offered) was not as the acts of service of God, but in the educational effect they had on the people and the awareness of God they inspired.

[Conversely,] it is fitting to destroy and break all the images, lest all the people err concerning them, like those people who thought that there are no other gods besides these [images].<br>When he overcame them through the strength of his arguments, the king d<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Nimrod (<i>Pesachim</i> 118a)

Abraham would convert the men and Sarah would convert the women.""

<b>When the people would gather around him and ask him about his statements, he would explain [them] to each one of them according to their understanding, until they turned to the path of truth. Ultimately, thousands and myriads gathered around him. These are the men of the house of Abraham. -</b> The Rabbis question the fate of all these people. We do not find any mention of the perpetuation of their faith in God. Perhaps the cultural influences of the surrounding environment were too powerful. If the children of Israel themselves turned to idol worship after two generations in Egypt, could any more be expected from these individuals?
<b>He planted in their hearts this great fundamental principle, composed texts about it -</b> Most commentaries point to <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 14b, which relates that Abraham composed a four-hundred-chapter text against the worship of false gods. <i>Kinat Eliyahu</i> notes that here, the Rambam is not referring to the negation of idol worship, but to the propagation of the faith in one God. Therefore, he suggests that the reference is to the Kabbalistic tradition (<i>Zohar</i>, Vol. II, 275b) that <i>Sefer Yetzirah</i> was composed by Abraham. (See also <i>Kiryat Melech</i>.)

<b>[Jacob] taught others and turned [the hearts] of all those who gathered around him [to God]. He also taught all of his children. -</b> In contrast to Abraham and Isaac, all of Jacob's children were righteous. (See <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 1:4.)
<b>He selected Levi and appointed him as the leader. -</b> The Torah itself does not mention Jacob's selection of Levi as a leader. A number of sources in the oral tradition (<i>Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezer</i>, Chapter 39; <i>Shemot Rabbah</i> 15:27), however, reveal this concept.
<b>He established him [as the head of] the academy -</b> The <i>Midrash Tanchuma</i> (<i>Vayigash</i>) interprets Genesis 46:28: ""And Jacob sent Judah before him,"" to mean that he charged him with founding a yeshiva. Similarly, <i>Yoma</i> 28b states that this Talmudic academy continued throughout the Egyptian exile.
<b>to teach them the way of God -</b> Note <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> 1:7, which explains that the expression, ""the way of God,"" refers to ethics, emulating the qualities of spirit which God has revealed.
<b>and observe the mitzvot of Abraham. -</b> In this context, note the Rambam's statements in <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 9:1. After relating the seven universal laws given to Noach and his descendants, the Rambam states:
In addition to these, Abraham was commanded regarding circumcision. He instituted the morning prayer. Isaac separated tithes and added another prayer service towards evening. Jacob added the prohibition against eating the <i>gid hanasheh</i>, the ""displaced nerve,"" and instituted the evening prayers.
<b>[Jacob] commanded his sons that the leadership should not depart from the descendants of Levi -</b> Thus, the mantle of leadership passed to Kehat and then to Amram, Moses' father.
<b>so that the teachings would not be forgotten. This concept proceeded and gathered strength among the descendants of Jacob and those who collected around them, until there became a nation within the world which knew God. -</b> This describes the initial period of the Jews' stay in Egypt, when they prospered both spiritually and materially.
<b>When the Jews extended their stay in Egypt -</b> The entire period of the Egyptian exile lasted 210 years. As long as Jacob's sons were living, the Jews preserved the heritage of their fathers and were treated with honor by the Egyptians.
The last of Jacob's sons to die was Levi. After his death, the spiritual level of the Jews descended. Levi lived 127 years. He was 44 when he entered Egypt. Thus, this spiritual descent occurred 83 years after the Jews entered Egypt.
<b>however, they learned from the [Egyptians'] deeds and began worshiping the stars as they did -</b> When the Jews adopted Egyptian values - as a reflection of their spiritual state - they were enslaved by the Egyptians.
<b>with the exception of the tribe of Levi, who clung to the mitzvot of the patriarchs - the tribe of Levi never served false gods. -</b> The tribe of Levi was also the only tribe which perpetuated the mitzvah of circumcision (<i>Sifre, Berachah</i>). As a result of their spiritual fortitude, the tribe of Levi was never enslaved.
<b>Within a short time, the fundamental principle that Abraham had planted would have been uprooted and the descendants of Jacob would have returned to the errors of the world and their crookedness. -</b> Our Sages relate that, in the Egyptian exile, the Jews had descended to the forty-ninth degree of impurity. Had they descended another level, it would have been impossible for us ever to be redeemed.
<b>Because of God's love for us, and to uphold the oath He made to Abraham, our patriarch -</b> This is a reference to Deuteronomy 7:7-8: ""It is not because of your greatness over all the other nations that God desired you and chose you..., but it was because of God's love for you and because He kept the oath He swore to your fathers.""
<b>He brought forth Moses, our teacher -</b> Rav David Arameah notes that the word עשה, rendered as ""brought forth,"" literally means ""made."" He explains that from Moses' birth, God granted him the potential to develop unique spiritual awareness. Although the Rambam also accepts this concept (see the Guide for the Perplexed, Vol. II, Chapter 32), it is more likely that he chose this expression as a reference to I Samuel 12:6 (Rav Kapach).
<b>the master of all prophets -</b> See <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 7:6, where the Rambam elaborates on the advantages Moses had over all the other prophets. Indeed, in his Commentary on the Mishnah (Introduction to Chapter 10 of <i>Sanhedrin</i>), he includes belief in the supremacy of Moses' prophecy as the seventh of his Thirteen Principles of Faith.

<b>the judgement prescribed for idol-worship and all those who stray after it -</b> as will be explained in the subsequent chapters. The Rambam's elaboration on the negative experience of our people in Egypt and the giving of the Torah has the following implication. Although man can appreciate the futile nature of idol worship and the greatness of God with his own intellect, because man is fallable, it is necessary to have these principles institutionalized in an objective, unchanging religious code (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 20).

The Ra'avad disagrees with this point and maintains that one of the larger strands should be dyed in its entirety, thus producing two smaller strands that are dyed <i>techelet</i>. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 10) and other Ashkenazic authorities maintain that two of the four strands were <i>techelet</i> and two were white.
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> supports the Rambam's position, noting that Numbers 15:39 states, ""And you shall place on the tassels of the corner a strand (singular) of <i>techelet</i>."" Note also the commentary of the <i>Or Sameach</i>.
Significantly, archaeological excavations have uncovered tzitzit belonging to bar Kochba's soldiers. Only one of the eight strands was dyed <i>techelet</i>.

Note <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 11:12 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 11:30, which discuss the implications of this principle on the use of stolen wool for tzitzit.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 14:1) does not accept this opinion. The Ramah, however, states that it is preferable for women not to tie tzitzit.

The concept would be self-explanatory. Whenever a deed must be performed with a specific intention, a gentile's acts are not acceptable (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).
The Ashkenazic authorities do not accept this premise and maintain that, at the very least, the strands must be attached to the garment with the intent that they be used for the mitzvah. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 14:2.)
</i>.<br>Tzitzit that are made from those already existing are not acceptable<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This principle is explained and illustrated in detail in the following four halachot.
</i>."
Reading the Shema 1.1,"We [are obligated to] recite the <i>Shema</i> twice daily - in the evening and in the morning<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The obligation to recite the <i>Shema</i> at night is mentioned first both in the Mishnah,<i>Berachot</i> 1:1 and here in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, following the pattern mentioned in the verse quoted above: ""...when you lie down and when you rise.""
<i>Berachot</i> 3a understands this order as parallel to the creation of the world itself which began: ויהי ערב ויהי בקר (And then there was night and there was day..., Genesis 1:5 . (See also the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 1:1.)
i.e., when people are accustomed to sleep - this being the night - and when people are accustomed to rise - this being daytime. - The Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 10b) records a disagreement between the school of Shammai and the school of Hillel regarding the laws derived from the verse: ""... and when you lie down and when you rise.""
Both agree that the <i>Shema</i> is recited twice daily, once at night and once in the morning. However, based on the above verse, <i>Beit Shammai</i> obligates one to recline while reciting <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night, and to stand while reciting it in the morning. <i>Beit Hillel</i> holds that the verse simply establishes the general times at which the <i>Shema</i> is recited, as stated by the Rambam in this halachah; i.e., at the time that people sleep and at the time that they are accustomed to wake up.
</i> - as [Deuteronomy 6:7] states: ""...when you lie down and when you rise"" - i<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 10), the Rambam mentions the beginning of this verse, ודברת בם... (And you shall speak of them...) as the source for the mitzvah of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>.
Nevertheless, his statements in this halachah do not necessarily represent a change of mind. Here, the Rambam is not interested in the actual source for the mitzvah itself (which is the case in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>), but in stating our obligation to recite the <i>Shema</i> twice daily, once at night and once in the daytime. This is derived from the end of the verse, as mentioned by the Rambam.
</i>.e., when people are accustomed to sleep - this being the night - and when people are accustomed to rise, this being daytime."
Reading the Shema 1.2,"And what is it that one recites?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There are various opinions as to what constitutes the positive commandment of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Commandment 419) states clearly that the Torah obligates us to read only the first verse of the <i>Shema</i> - i.e., <i>Shema Yisrael</i>. The reading of the rest of the three sections was instituted by the Sages.
Rabbenu Yonah understands that the whole first section constitutes the Torah obligation. (See <i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 63 at the end.) There is also an opinion that the obligation to recite the first two sections originates in the Torah. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Orach Chayim</i> 58.) However, in practice, everyone ultimately agrees that one must recite all three sections mentioned by the Rambam in this halachah (<i>Berachot</i> 13a).
</i> These three sections:
""Hear O Israel..."" (Deuteronomy 6:4-9),<br>
""And if you will listen..."" (Deuteronomy 11:13-21),and<br>
""And God said..."" (Numbers 15:37-41).<br>W<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> For, as explained, each of these paragraphs contains fundamental concepts central to the Jewish faith.
Note <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Commandment 420) who quotes the Rambam, not to explain the order of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, but rather to clarify why the Sages included these three sections in the <i>Shema</i>.
we begin with the section of ""Hear O Israel..."" - <i>Berachot</i> 13a, 14b, offers two different explanations regarding the order of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. The Rambam, however, does not quote either explicitly, but rather seems to suggest his own reason.
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> holds that the Rambam's explanation of the order of the first two sections, ""Hear O Israel"" and ""And if you will listen,"" is in fact consistent with the Mishnah in <i>Berachot</i> 13a. Regarding the last section, the Rambam desired to supply us with both the reason for its inclusion and its placement after the second section (even though the third section precedes it in the Torah itself).
</i>e begin with the section of ""Hear O Israel"" since it contains [the concept of] the unity of God<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The statement ""God is our Lord, God is one"" implies not only that there is only one God, but all creation is one with Him. See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 61:6.
</i>, [the commandment of] loving Him<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> ""And you shall love God, your Lord, with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your strength"" (Deuteronomy 6:5 .
</i> and the study of Torah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> ""... and you shall teach your children and speak of them"" (Deuteronomy 6:7 .
It must be noted that in <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i>, the Rambam quotes Deuteronomy 11:19 (a verse in the second section of the <i>Shema</i>), as the source for the mitzvah of Torah study.
</i>, it being a fundamental principle upon which everything is based<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This refers to the concept of the unity of God. (See <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:6.)
</i>.<br>After it, [we read] ""And if you will listen...,"" since it contains the imperative to fulfill the rest of the commandments, a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> ""And if you will listen to all my commandments..."" (Deuteronomy 11:13 . This section also contains the commandment of loving God (verse 13) and the study of Torah (verse 19). It is, however, the mention of ""all the commandments"" which distinguishes this section as separate and unique from the first section.
and finally the portion of tzitzit, since it also contains the imperative of remembering all the commandments - ""And you shall see them (<i>tzitzit</i> - the fringes on the corners of four-cornered garments) and remember all the commandments of God and do them"" (Numbers 15:39 .
Rashi, in his commentary on the above verse, explains how <i>tzitzit</i> serve as a reminder of all the Torah's commandments. The numerical value of the Hebrew word ציצית is 600 (צ = 90 י = 10 צ = 90 י = 10 ת = 400) There are also eight strings and five knots. Therefore, by looking at the <i>tzitzit</i>, one is reminded of the 613 divine commandments.<br>

</i>nd finally the portion of <i>tzitzit</i>, since it also contains the imperative of remembering all the commandments."
Reading the Shema 1.3,"The commandment of <i>tzitzit</i> is not obligatory at night. N<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See <i>Berachot</i> 12b.
It is interesting to note that in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam does not count the mentioning of the exodus from Egypt as one of the 613 commandments in the Torah, nor does he mention it elsewhere in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.
The Rambam does, however, count the commandment of the telling of the story of the exodus on the fifteenth of <i>Nisan</i> - i.e., Passover night - as one of the mitzvot. See <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 157), <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 21), and <i>Hilchot Chametz U'Matzah</i>, Chapters 7 and 8.
According to some opinions, one can differentiate between the two obligations as follows: A person can fulfill his daily obligation with simply a thought about the exodus, whereas on <i>Pesach</i> night the mitzvah can be performed only through the verbal description of the redemption from Egypt. (See <i>Sha'agat Aryeh</i>, 13.)
This would explain the omission of this commandment from <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>. A commandment that can be fulfilled with a thought alone and not an explicit statement or action is not ""worthy"" of inclusion in the list of 613 commandments of the Torah. (See the Rambam's explanation of the commandment to remember Amalek: Positive Commandment 189).
The <i>Aruch HaShulchan</i>, however, disagrees with this opinion. In <i>Orach Chayim</i> 67, he states that even the daily obligation requires an explicit statement. Nevertheless, he explains that it was not chosen as one of the 613 commandments because the obligation to remember the exodus twice daily is not stated in the form of a command in the Torah to ""Remember,"" but rather, as a reason for another mitzvah (the mitzvah of <i>matzah</i>): ""In order that you shall remember..."" (Deuteronomy 16:3 .
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> ""I am God, your Lord, who took you out of the land of Egypt to be your Lord, I am God, your Lord"" (Numbers 15:41 .
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the mention of the exodus can itself be understood as the reason for the inclusion of this section in <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. The Rambam, however, mentions <i>tzitzit</i> as the basis for the presence of this section in <i>Kri'at Shema</i> (see Halachah 2), since it is the <i>tzitzit</i> that cause us to remember all the commandments.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Numbers 15:39 states: ""And you shall see them..."" - implying that <i>tzitzit</i> must only be worn when they can be seen, i.e., daytime. Accordingly, there is no obligation to wear <i>tzitzit</i> at night. See <i>Hilchot Tzitzit</i> 3:7-8.
</i>evertheless, we recite [the section describing] it at night because it contains mention of the exodus from Egypt.<br>We are commanded to mention the exodus both during the day and at night as [Deuteronomy 16:3] states: ""In order that you shall remember the day of your leaving the land of Egypt all the days of your life<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 1:5) mentions that the sections of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> also contain a reference to each of the 10 utterances of the revelation at Mount Sinai (Exodus 20:1-14), thus representing a complete statement of Jewish spirituality and values.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The word ""all"" includes even the nighttime.
The <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Parshat Vayakhel</i> 216b) explains the mystical significance of mentioning the exodus from Egypt after proclaiming the unity of God.
</i>.""<br>Reading these three sections in this order constitutes the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>."
Reading the Shema 1.4,"When reciting the <i>Shema</i>, after completing the first verse, one says quietly ""Blessed be the name of the glory of His Kingdom forever."" H<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., Why do we include this verse of ""Blessed be the name...,"" since it is not part of the section of the Torah beginning with ""<i>Shema Yisrael</i>...""
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This phrase is recited quietly because it is not part of the section of the <i>Shema</i> as it appears in the Torah, but rather was recited by Jacob in Egypt, as explained later in this halachah.
It is, however, pronounced loudly on Yom Kippur. <i>Pirkei D'rabbi Eliezer</i> explains that the angels praise God with this verse. On Yom Kippur, we are as pure as angels and thus, emulate their practice (<i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i>).
It is preferable to separate clearly between the end of ""Blessed be the name"" - i.e., the words לעולם ועד - forever, and the beginning of the next section, ואהבת (And you shall love...) (<i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 61).
</i>e then continues to read the first section in its normal fashion: ""And you shall love God, your Lord...""<br>Why do we read it in this fashion? It is our tradition that when the patriarch, Jacob, gathered all his sons together in Egypt close to his death<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Genesis, Chapter 49.
</i>, he commanded and urged them regarding the Unity of God and the path of God upon which Abraham and Isaac, his father, had tread<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This narrative can be found in <i>Pesachim</i> 56a.
</i>.<br>He asked them: ""My sons, perhaps there are dregs among you, one who does not stand with me in the Unity of God?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> What would cause Jacob to have such a doubt regarding his children? One of the greatest merits of Jacob is that he - unlike Avraham, who fathered Yishmael, and Yitzchak, who had Esau as a son - had only righteous children.
<i>Pesachim</i> (ibid.) explains that Jacob desired to reveal the secret of the end of days to his children, but that this knowledge suddenly left him. He was worried that perhaps his sudden lack of understanding was due to the imperfect state of his children and therefore, felt compelled to ask them about their faith in the One God.
The Rambam omits all these particulars, since they are not relevant to the matter at hand - namely, the source of the custom of saying ""Blessed be the name..."" after ""<i>Shema Yisrael</i>...""
</i>"" This is comparable to the manner in which Moses, our teacher, said to us: ""Lest there be among you a man or woman [whose heart turns this day from God...]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam adds this in order to teach us the nature of Jacob's doubts. He was not casting aspersions on the behavior of his sons, since he knew that their deeds were righteous. He was, however, worried that perhaps one of them had a mistaken understanding regarding the unity of God. This is in line with the verse the Rambam quotes. Moses is not chastising the Jewish people for their actions, but rather warning them of the possibility that there might be someone with a lack of faith that could lead to blasphemy later (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).
</i>"" (Deuteronomy 29:17 .<br>They all answered and said: ""Listen, Israel<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Jacob is also called by that name (Genesis 32:29 .
</i>, God is our Lord, God is One,"" i.e., listen to us, Israel, our father, God is our Lord, God is One.<br><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
</i>The wise elder responded:<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Praising God for the fortune of having righteous children;
</i> ""Blessed be the Name of the Glory of His Kingdom forever."" Therefore, the Jews are accustomed to utter the praise that Israel, the wise elder, uttered after this verse.<<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There are a total of seven blessings associated with the reading of the <i>Shema</i>, three in the day and four at night. The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 1:5) bases this on the verse ""Seven (times) in the day will I praise you"" (Psalms 119:164 .
The <i>Tanya</i>, Chapter 49, discusses the reasons for these blessings at length, noting that, on the surface, they are not related to the <i>Shema</i> at all. That text explains that the basic intent of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> is to attain the love for God as described in the verse, ""And you shall love God, your Lord, with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your strength.""
To reach such a level, one must first contemplate the greatness of God. Accordingly, in the first blessing, we outline the praises of God uttered by the angels, who are of supreme intelligence and spiritual wisdom. These lofty creatures proclaim God's greatness and abnegate themselves completely to Him, stating that He transcends even their ability to understand.
Then, in the second blessing, we describe God's great love for the Jewish people, as manifested by His giving us His Torah and choosing us as His people.
Having contemplated such ideas, we are prepared to reciprocate God's love for us by proclaiming our love for Him. We recognize His infinite Greatness and Unity, see His Providence in the events of our life, and internalize our intellectual understanding into an emotional outpouring for our Creator.

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> A blessing which immediately follows another as part of a series of blessings is not introduced with a <i>p'tichah</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 46a). The paragraphs of ""True and certain"" and ""True and faithful"" are also considered as blessings that follow another blessing, even though the <i>Kri'at Shema</i> itself would seem to constitute an interruption. Therefore, these blessings need not begin with a <i>p'tichah</i>, but simply conclude with the standard <i>chatimah</i>: Blessed are You, God (Rashi, <i>Berachot</i> 36a).<br>
[
The Rambam discusses only the concepts of <i>p'tichah</i> and <i>chatimah</i> and omits the second category of blessings mentioned in the Mishnah and <i>Tosefta</i> (i.e., long and short blessings). This seems to indicate that he equated a long blessing with that which has a <i>p'tichah</i> and a <i>chatimah</i>, and a short blessing with one that has only a <i>chatimah</i> (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). In fact, in his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 11a), the Rambam writes that even a long blessing has a <i>p'tichah</i> and <i>chatimah</i>, and a short one has only one of the above.
In contrast, Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 11a) holds that the distinction between long and short blessings is a matter of length only, irrespective of <i>p'tichot</i> and <i>chatimot</i>. He defines the blessing of אמת ואמונה - ""True and faithful"" - (the first blessing after <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night) as a long blessing, and ""Lay us down"" (the last blessing after <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night) to be a short blessing, even though they both have only a <i>chatimah</i> and no <i>p'tichah</i>.]

In <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> (1:5-6), the Rambam writes that a person who mentions the central ideas contained in the <i>p'tichah</i> - i.e., the name of God and His sovereignty - even were he to deviate from the set form of the blessing, would fulfill his obligation.
We must understand the present halachah in this context. Only when one deviates from the <i>p'tichah</i> or <i>chatimah</i> of a blessing does the Rambam require the recitation of another blessing. However, a person who maintains the nature of the <i>p'tichah</i> and <i>chatimah</i>, but changes the wording of the rest of the blessing, fulfills his obligation as long as the basic intent of the blessing remains.

Rashi explains that ויציב אמת, ""True and certain"" (which is recited after <i>Kri'at Shema</i> in the morning) is necessary, since it tells of God's infinite lovingkindness in taking our forefathers out of Egypt and splitting the Red Sea.
אמת ואמונה (True and faithful) (which is recited at night) chronicles our hopes and beliefs regarding our future, that God will fulfill His promise to redeem us from the exile and restore us to a vibrant life of freedom. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 66) explains that אמת ואמונה (True and faithful) could also refer to our faith that God will return our soul, which we put in His trust every night, to us.
</i> does not fulfill his obligation<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rav Hai Gaon holds that the blessings of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> are an integral and necessary part of the fulfillment of the commandment. Therefore, he explains <i>Berachot</i> 12a as saying that one who does not say <i>Emet v'yatziv</i> has not fulfilled his obligation of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> and must therefore recite it again. The Rambam appears to accept this opinion.
However, the vast majority of the <i>Rishonim</i> are of the opinion that a person can fulfill his obligation to recite the <i>Shema</i> even if he does not recite the blessings. The above passage, therefore, is to be understood as teaching that one has not performed the mitzvah in its proper fashion if he omits the blessings.
Both the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 66:10) reflect this understanding. They add the word ""properly"" at the end of this halachah: ""One who does not say <i>Emet v'yatziv</i>, etc., does not fulfill his obligation properly. He need not, however, recite the <i>Shema</i> again.""

Reading the Shema 1.9,"When is the [proper] time for the recitation of Shema at night? The commandment [starts] from the time of the appearance of the stars<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There are three positions recorded in the Mishnah in <i>Berachot</i> 2a regarding the time until which one may recite the <i>Shema</i> at night.
Rabbi Eliezer says until the end of the first of the three watches of the Temple - i.e., one third of the night, which is until approximately 9:30 pm. The Sages say until midnight, and Rabban Gamliel says until dawn. The Mishnah then explains that the Sages' opinion is, in effect, that one may recite the <i>Shema</i> until dawn, but that they mentioned midnight as a preferred time in order to distance people from transgression. This is the source of this halachah in the Rambam.
The <i>Rosh</i> and the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 235) hold that the halachah follows Rabban Gamliel's position, and that a priori (לכתחילה), a person may read the <i>Shema</i> at night until dawn. The Rambam sees the Sages' position as halachically valid, and therefore one may rely on Rabban Gamliel only after the fact (בדיעבד). The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 235:3 quotes the Rambam's position. (See also <i>Mishnah Berurah 235:34-35.)<br></i>
A person who transgresses and delays - the Rabbinic decree that the <i>Shema</i> should be read before midnight.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 2a) states that the time for the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> begins at the hour when a priest who has become ritually impure may immerse in a <i>mikveh</i> and resume eating <i>terumah</i>. The Talmud explains that this is the time when the stars appear.
<i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 2a) holds that the <i>Shema</i> may be recited earlier, during the last hour before sunset. This is based on the understanding that Rabbi Yehudah, who disagrees with the majority opinion regarding the proper time for the afternoon prayer, also disagrees about the proper time for the evening prayer and <i>Kri'at Shema</i> contained therein. (See <i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 235.) This will be discussed at length in <i>Hilchot Tefilah</i> 3:6.
There are several different positions regarding the precise definition of צאת הכוכבים (the appearance of the stars). It generally refers to the appearance of three medium-sized stars. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 235:1 requires the sighting of three small stars before reciting <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> explains that the basic halachah is indeed that three medium sized stars constitute the time of צאת הכוכבים, but that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> obligated one to wait for smaller stars in order to diminish the possibility of error regarding the recitation of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night.
There are three basic positions regarding the actual time of צאת הכוכבים (the appearance of the stars). <i>Shabbat</i> 34b determines that it refers to the time that it takes one to walk 3/4 of a <i>mil</i> after sunset.
The other two positions are found in <i>Pesachim</i> 94a: one defines צאת הכוכבים as the amount of time needed to walk four <i>mil</i> after sunset, and the other, as the time necessary to walk five <i>mil</i>.
There are two different methods of determining the time it takes to walk a <i>mil</i>. The Rambam, Commentary to the mishnah, <i>Pesachim</i> 3:2, maintains that it takes 24 minutes to walk a <i>mil</i>. However, the most widely held opinion - and the opinion accepted regarding <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i> - is that the measure of time is 18 minutes.
Therefore, according to <i>Shabbat</i> 34b, the appearance of the stars is 13 1/2 (3/4 x 18) minutes after sunset. Both the Vilna Gaon and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> maintain that צאת הכוכבים is determined in this fashion. Thus, the proper local time may be calculated by extrapolation based on the amount of light visible 13 1/2 minutes after sunset in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> on the day of the Equinox. Generally, people wait up to 36 minutes after sunset in order to be certain.
According to <i>Pesachim</i> 94a, the appearance of the stars will be either 72 (4 x 18) minutes or 90 (5 x 18) minutes after sunset. <i>Rabbenu Tam</i> strongly suggests adhering to the position that צאת הכוכבים takes place 72 minutes after sunset. Though some authorities support the 90-minute position, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein (<i>Iggerot Moshe, Orach Chayim</i>, Vol. 1, Siman 24), mentions only the position of the <i>Vilna Gaon</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>, on the one hand, and <i>Rabbenu Tam</i> on the other.
</i>...<br>A person who transgresses and delays fulfills his obligation if he recites [the Shema] before dawn<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 1:1), the Rambam defines dawn (עלות השחר) as the light that radiates from the east before sunrise.
There are three major positions regarding this time. All are based on <i>Pesachim</i> 94a which defines the time from dawn until sunrise as that in which a person can walk either 4 <i>mil</i> (according to one opinion) or 5 <i>mil</i> (according to the other).
As mentioned above, there are two opinions regarding the measure of time it takes to walk a <i>mil</i>: 18 minutes or 24 minutes. Thus, Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi defines dawn as 120 (5 x 24) minutes before sunrise. The most widely held view is that it is 90 (5 x 18) minutes before sunrise, while the <i>Beit Yosef</i> holds that dawn is 72 (4 x 18) minutes before sunrise. This is the opinion of the Rambam, as stated in his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 1:1.)
</i>. [The Sages established the limit] of midnight only in order to distance us from negligent wrongdoing."
Reading the Shema 1.10,"One who reads the <i>Shema</i> [of the night] after dawn, [but] before sunrise<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the last possible time that could be defined as night
</i>, does not fulfill his obligation unless he was unavoidably detained - e.g., drunk or sick, or in a similar situation<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai said in the name of Rabbi Akiva: ""Sometimes a person can recite the <i>Shema</i> twice in the day, once before sunrise and once after sunrise, and fulfill his obligation - once for the day and once for the night.""<br>
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: ""The law follows [the statement of] Rabbi Shimon in the name of Rabbi Akiva."" Rav Zeira says: ""This is so, provided that he does not say [the paragraph of] ""Lay us down"" (<i>Berachot</i> 8b-9a).
The Talmud explains that Rabbi Shimon's statement only applies when a person is unavoidably detained. The evening <i>Shema</i> must be recited ""when you lie down."" The Torah left the definition of that term to the Rabbis. The latter maintained that a person who intentionally delays the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> cannot recite it after dawn. However, they were more lenient in regard to a person who was unavoidably detained and gave him until sunrise.
</i>. A person who was so detained and reads [the <i>Shema</i>] at this time does not recite [the blessing of] ""Lay us down.""<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for this is not a time when a person lays himself down to sleep. Nevertheless, one does recite the other blessings related to <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night (two before and one after it).

Reading the Shema 1.11,"When is the proper time [for the recitation of the <i>Shema</i>] during the day? The commandment is that one should start to read before sunrise i<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., אמת ויציב (True and certain...), which concludes: Blessed are You O God, who redeemed Israel.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Mishnah, (<i>Berachot</i> 9b) records a disagreement regarding the time of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> in the morning.
An anonymous position sees the earliest possible time as when one can distinguish between <i>techelet</i> (blue-green) and white. Rabbi Eliezer says: Between green and blue-green - i.e., later - and that the time lasts until sunrise. Rabbi Yehoshua says that one may recite the <i>Shema</i> ""until three hours.""
The Talmud then adds various other opinions and quotes Abaye as saying that the <i>Shema</i> should be recited כותיקין - i.e., one should finish reciting the <i>Shema</i> as the sun rises, in order to start the silent <i>Amidah</i> with the sunrise.
The Rambam clearly prefers this position and establishes 6 minutes as a reasonable amount of time to recite the <i>Shema</i> and the blessing after it, in order to start the <i>Amidah</i> at the proper time. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (<i>Orach Chaim</i> 58:1) explains that all opinions agree that the commandment to recite <i>Shema</i> in the morning begins at dawn. The only disagreement revolves around the optimum time to recite <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. The Vilna Gaon differs and explains that the Rambam holds that Abaye's position states the actual time of the beginning of the commandment itself and that it may be recited earlier only in extraordinary circumstances.
</i>n order to conclude and recite the last blessing with the sunrise. This measure [of time] is one-tenth of an hour before the sun rises<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is based on the verse in Psalms 72:5, ""May they fear You with the sun"" - i.e., may they show their fear for You with the Amidah as the sun rises (<i>Berachot</i> 9b). The Talmud promises that anyone who recites the <i>Shema</i> and the Amidah at this time is guaranteed a place in the World to Come.
</i>.<br>A person who delays and reads the <i>Shema</i> after the sun rises fulfills his obligation, for the proper time is until the end of the third hour of the day f<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The use of the term ""transgresses"" (מי שעבר) is most striking in this context. We must say that the Rambam understands Rabbi Yehoshua's position as secondary and that, at the outset, one should recite the <i>Shema</i> 6 minutes before sunrise. Indeed, in his responsa, he writes that it it is preferable to read the <i>Shema</i> without a <i>minyan</i> before sunrise, than to wait until after sunrise to recite it together with a <i>minyan</i>.
The majority of <i>Rishonim</i> (see Rabbenu Asher on <i>Berachot</i> 9b and <i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 58) disagree with the Rambam and understand that although reciting <i>Kriat Shema</i> just prior to sunrise is the most desirable method of fulfilling one's obligation (מצוה מן המובחר), the actual commandment is from before sunrise (i.e., the time at which one can recognize his friend 6 feet away) to the end of the third hour. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 58:1 and the definition there regarding the proper time for the commandment.)
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> These do not refer to normal 60-minute hours, but are based on a different calculation. These hours are שעות זמניות - ""seasonal hours,"" i.e., 1/12 of the duration of the daylight hours. The day and night are each divided into 12 equal parts, and each ""hour"" is 1/12 of that time.
For example, if there were 18 hours of daylight and 6 hours of darkness on a given day, each ""hour"" of the day would be 18/12 hours (or 90 minutes), and each ""hour"" of the night would be 6/12 hour (or 30 minutes).
There is a disagreement regarding how to calculate the durations of daylight and nighttime. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> holds that daylight is divided into 12 equal parts from dawn until the appearance of the stars. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> and the <i>Vilna Gaon</i> hold that daylight is determined from sunrise to sunset.
Therefore, the end of the third hour according to the <i>Magen Avraham</i> is earlier than that of the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> and the <i>Vilna Gaon</i>, and even though each ""hour"" is longer, it is calculated from dawn, which is at least 72 minutes before sunrise. (See the commentary on Halachah 9.)

When a person reads the <i>Shema</i> at such a time...

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> questions why <i>Kri'at Shema</i> may be read in the daytime until only the end of the third hour.<br>
Just as the obligation to recite the <i>Shema</i> at night lasts the entire night because the entire night is a time of lying down, so too, the <i>Shema</i> of the daytime should be recited all day, since the entire day is a time of being up.
The <i>Taz</i> (58:6) distinguishes between the nighttime, all of which is indeed a time of lying down, and the daytime. There are many acts that one does during the day - e.g., walking, sitting and eating - while rising is generally done at the beginning of the day.

In conclusion, he quotes Rav Hai Gaon who states that one may recite the blessings only until the end of the fourth hour - i.e., one third of the day. Rabbenu Chanan'el is also of this opinion.
Rabbenu Manoach agrees with the Rambam and allows one to recite the blessings during the entire day. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 58:6 follows the position of Rav Hai Gaon.

The <i>Rivosh</i> explains that since eating is the most important use of chametz, it is considered <i>muktzeh</i> once it can no longer be eaten. However, the <i>Bach</i> considers ""the fourth hour"" a printing error and amends the Rambam's text to read ""the fifth hour."" All Ashkenazic halachic authorities decide accordingly. Nevertheless, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> justifies the Rambam's statements, explaining that they apply in a situation where there is no gentile or animal to give the chametz to.
In practice, the following procedure is suggested when Pesach falls on Saturday night. The transfer of chametz and Pesach pots, dishes, and cutlery is carried out on Thursday night or Friday, and no chametz is cooked afterwards. The Sabbath meals should be totally kosher for Pesach and prepared in the Pesach pots. Four small challot are kept in a special place for the evening and morning meals (two for each meal).
They are eaten away from the table, and afterwards, the crumbs are collected and flushed down the toilet. Otherwise, the meals are eaten as all the other meals of the Pesach holiday itself.
As mentioned, it is forbidden to eat chametz on the fourteenth of Nisan after the fourth hour of the day (usually around 9:20 AM). To complete the eating of the above-mentioned challot before this hour, certain synagogues may have to conduct their morning services at an earlier time than usual.

The obligation to search for chametz in the midst of the festival emphasizes that the Rambam conceives that the mitzvah to destroy chametz applies, not only before Pesach begins, but throughout the holiday. Indeed, this concept can be seen in the Rambam's words describing the mitzvah in the preface to this text. There, he explains that the mitzvah is to destroy chametz ""from"" and not ""on"" the fourteenth of Nisan.
[It must be noted that the adoption of such a position represents a change of mind for the Rambam. In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive mitzvah 156) and in the earlier handwritten texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Rambam writes that the mitzvah is to destroy chametz ""on the fourteenth.""]
The definition of the term ""in the midst of the festival"" is the subject of debate among the commentaries. Some define it as ""in the midst of Chol HaMoed,"" explaining that since chametz is <i>muktzeh</i> and cannot be moved or destroyed on the first day of the festival, there is no need to search for it at that time (Rabbenu Manoach).
Nevertheless, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 435:1) and the other Ashkenazic halachic authorities require a search on the first day of Pesach itself even though it is Yom Tov. Should chametz be found, it should be covered with a utensil.
</i>. If the festival passed without his having searched, he should search after the festival to destroy whatever chametz he might find which [he possessed] during Pesach, s<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as mentioned in Halachah 1:4.

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Pesachim</i> (ibid.) debates whether the blessing should state על ביעור חמץ (concerning the destruction of chametz) or לבער חמץ (to destroy chametz), and reaches the conclusion stated by the Rambam.
<i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 11:15 explains that it is not proper to state ""to destroy chametz,"" since from the moment the person decides to nullify the chametz, the mitzvah to obliterate chametz has been completed according to Torah law. Hence, the expression ""concerning the destruction"" is more appropriate.
The blessing mentions ""the destruction of chametz,"" for that is the ultimate aim of the search.
</i>e must check and search in all the places where chametz is brought in, as was explained.

The prohibitions against possessing, and hence the mitzvah to destroy, chametz are completed by the end of Pesach. This search is not considered as an end in its own right, but rather was instituted merely to prevent a person from eating the chametz, which is forbidden according to Rabbinic decree.
A parallel can be drawn to the following instance (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i> 57): Fowl were attacked by beasts of prey and wounded to the extent that they would not recover. Even though they did not die immediately, the Sages required that they be slain, lest another Jew not be aware of their wounds and slaughter them to eat as kosher birds. Needless to say, no blessing is required when killing them for these reasons (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>).

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.8,"Thus, a person who does not nullify [his chametz] before the sixth hour<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Ra'avad questions the phraseology used by the Rambam, noting that the prohibitions against owning chametz do not begin until the evening. On the day of the fourteenth of Nisan, there is only a positive commandment to destroy chametz.
Most commentaries explain that the Rambam himself intended this interpretation. However, some note that Rashi (<i>Pesachim</i> 4b) does maintain that the prohibitions against owning chametz begin on the fourteenth, and they maintain that the Rambam shares this view (See Responsa, <i>Nodah BiYhudah, Orach Chayim</i> 20).

Similarly, with regard to chametz, since one is forbidden to benefit from it, it is no longer considered in one's possession and cannot be sold, bartered, or given away. Nevertheless, the person retaining it is still liable for transgression of the prohibitions involved.
</i>herefore,] he is obligated to destroy it whenever he finds it. If he finds it on the day of a festival, he should cover it with a utensil until the evening, and then destroy it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This statement raises questions among many of the commentators. In Halachah 3, the Rambam also mentions covering chametz with a utensil. However, in that instance, the person had already nullified his possession of the chametz, and thus his possession of chametz violated only a Rabbinic prohibition.
In contrast, this instance describes chametz that has not been nullified, and thus the violation of a Torah prohibition is involved. Nevertheless, the Rambam considers the Rabbinic prohibition against <i>mukzteh</i> as important enough to override the fulfillment of a Torah commandment. Furthermore, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that since the person himself desires to destroy the chametz, and the only reason he fails to do so is the Rabbinic commandment, he is not considered to have violated the Torah's prohibitions against possessing chametz.
This view is not accepted by all authorities. Many explain that since three Torah mitzvot (the two prohibitions against possessing chametz and the positive commandment to destroy chametz) are involved, their observance overrides the prohibitions of <i>muktzeh</i>. Others maintain that even if the prohibition against <i>muktzeh</i> must be observed, the chametz can be destroyed by burning it in the place where it is located.
Nevertheless, in practice, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 446:2), the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>, and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> do not accept the latter view, and advise waiting to destroy the chametz until after the holiday. They explain that a person is allowed to light a fire on a festival only if doing so increases his festive joy. Hence, they prohibit burning the chametz in that manner. However, they mention that, if it is possible, a gentile may be asked to destroy the chametz. Furthermore, in the diaspora, a Jew is also allowed to destroy chametz he finds on the second day of a festival.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 3.9,"A person who left his house before the time for destroying chametz in order to fulfill a mitzvah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Mishnah (<i>Pesachim</i> 49a) mentions a person who goes out to slaughter the Paschal sacrifice or circumcise his son.

The above applies when the person can still nullify his ownership over the chametz. However, if the person recalls the possession of chametz after the beginning of the sixth hour, he must return to destroy his chametz even if he is involved in the performance of a mitzvah. The only exception is the burial of a corpse who has no one else to tend to him (<i>Magen Avraham, Orach Chayim</i> 444:11).

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> goes further and explains that saving the people's lives supersedes all matters. Hence, even if a person has time to return home to destroy the chametz, he should first deal with saving the lives, for that is the primary concern.
Though the primacy of saving lives is accepted by all authorities, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> qualifies the matter. If the person knows for sure that he will be able to return home, destroy his chametz, and still have time to save the people's lives, he must destroy his chametz first.

However, the Sages showed leniency, since the nullification of chametz is sufficient according to Torah law. They did not require a person to return to destroy chametz unless a quantity the size of an egg, the measure associated with ritual purity and impurity, was found.
</i>. If there is less than the size of an egg, it is sufficient for him to nullify it in his heart<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as required by Torah law. The above applies when the person can still nullify his ownership over the chametz. However, beyond the beginning of the sixth hour, if the person has not nullified his chametz he must return to destroy even an amount the size of an olive. However, should he possess less than an olive's size of chametz, there is no need especially to destroy the chametz.

The Rambam's choice of wording in this halachah is significant. Our Rabbis have offered two definitions of the mitzvah of resting on the Sabbath: In his commentary on <i>Yevamot</i> 6a, the Rashba states that the mitzvah is negative in nature: one refrains from performing prohibited labors. In contrast, in his commentary on Leviticus 23:24, the Ramban explains that the mitzvah possesses a positive dimension: to spend the day in a restful frame of mind, abstaining from all activities - even those that are not forbidden labors - which would disrupt this tranquility.
From the Rambam's choice of wording in this halachah, it would appear that he follows the first view. From his statements in Chapter 21, Halachah 1, however, it would appear that he accepts the second perspective. (See also <i>Tzafenat Paneach</i>.)

The Radbaz (Vol. V, Responsum 1510) notes that the Rambam uses the expression ""willingly, as a conscious act of defiance"" with regard to the transgressions of idolatry (<i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 3:1), the Sabbath laws, and the laws of Yom Kippur (<i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i> 1:1). With regard to all other transgressions punishable by כרת, the Rambam merely states ""as a conscious act of defiance.""
The Radbaz explains that it is possible that the Rambam mentioned the concept of ""willingly"" with regard to these three transgressions because they are the first cases of כרת mentioned in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. After mentioning the concept on these three occasions, he does not think further repetition is necessary.

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:8; <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 271:1) states that when placing the skin in lime at the beginning of the process of making it into parchment, one should explicitly say that one is processing it for these purposes.
<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (32:11) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (32:26-27) explain that parchment processed to be used as a Torah scroll may be used for <i>tefillin</i> (or for a <i>mezuzah</i>).

It is not that we suspect that the gentile will not listen to the person who hires him, and his act is therefore not acceptable. Rather, because his nature is to ""follow his own intentions,"" he is disqualified from performing any act that requires a sacred intention.
According to this interpretation, the question of whether a gentile's actions are accepted if he is supervised by a Jew must be understood as follows: The act of preparing the parchment for a Torah scroll is not, in and of itself, a sacred act, but merely a preparation for performing such an act. Accordingly, one might assume that it is sufficient for a Jew to command the gentile to process the scroll for the proper intent. The gentile would be considered like a machine which performs activities with no will of its own, and it would be as if the Jew performed the act himself. In conclusion, however, it is accepted that because the gentile acts independently, the intention of the Jew who hires him cannot be associated with his acts.

In other instances, the gentile must act according to the Jew's intent for a prolonged period of time. Here, it is absolutely necessary to have the intent to use the parchment for <i>tefillin</i> or a Torah scroll only at the moment it is placed in the lime. We can assume that if a gentile is given instructions to place it in the lime with that intent, he will do so with that intent.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> quotes both opinions in <i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:9. <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 271:1, however, mentions only the Rambam's opinion. In both places, the Ramah states that it is customary to follow Rabbenu Asher's opinion.
<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 32:12 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 32:28-29 quote Rabbenu Asher's statements that a Jew should be present at the time the parchment is placed in the lime and that he should explicitly tell the gentile to put it in the lime to be used for a Torah scroll. Afterwards, he should assist the gentile somewhat in the process of preparing the parchment.
</i>.<br>[The parchment used for] a <i>mezuzah</i> need not be processed with this purpose in mind<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Yoma</i> 3:6) states, ""Parchment which was processed for use as a talisman is acceptable for a <i>mezuzah</i>.""
In one of his responsa, the Rambam explains that the reason for the difference in law between a <i>mezuzah</i>, on the one hand, and a Torah scroll and <i>tefillin</i>, on the other, stems from the fact that a Torah scroll and <i>tefillin</i> are mitzvot which each person is obligated to fulfill. In contrast, the mitzvah of <i>mezuzah</i> is an obligation that is not incumbent on a person unless he dwells in a house that requires one. (It must be noted, however, that there are opinions which maintain that this responsum was not written by the Rambam.)
This ruling is not accepted by the other authorities. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 288:5) states that לכתחילה (at the outset), one must seek a <i>mezuzah</i> that was written on parchment processed with this intention in mind. Only if it is impossible to find such a <i>mezuzah</i>, may one use a <i>mezuzah</i> which was not processed with this intent. (Note also our commentary on Chapter 3, Halachah 15.)

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 1.12","It is a halachah transmitted to Moses on Mount Sinai that a Torah scroll or <i>mezuzah</i> should be written only [on parchment] which has been ruled<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The parchment should be ruled with a stylus or a reed. It is improper to use a substance that leaves a mark. Each line of the parchment should be ruled and a border made on both sides. If unruled parchment is used for a Torah scroll or for a <i>mezuzah</i>, it is unacceptable (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i> 271:5, 288:8).
</i>. [The parchment used for] <i>tefillin</i>, however, need not be ruled<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:6) states the top line of <i>tefillin</i> must be ruled because the Sages forbade writing more than three words from a verse from the Bible without ruling the line above them. See Chapter 7, Halachah 16, and also see the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 284:2).
In <i>Orach Chayim</i>, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> continues, explaining that a person who cannot write on a straight line without ruling the parchment should rule the parchment before writing <i>tefillin</i>. The Ramah states that it is customary for even the most competent scribes to write <i>tefillin</i> on ruled parchment. If, however, one wrote <i>tefillin</i> without ruling the parchment, the <i>tefillin</i> are acceptable even if the lines are crooked (<i>Mishneh Berurah</i> 32:21).
</i>, because they are covered<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This explains why although a verse from the Torah must always be written on ruled parchment, we are not required to do so for <i>tefillin</i>.
Even though a <i>mezuzah</i> is also covered, ruling the parchment is required because it can be removed from its covering easily and must be checked twice in seven years. In contrast, there is no obligation to check <i>tefillin</i> and the parchments are almost never removed from their compartments (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rabbenu Nissim).
</i>.<br>It is permissible to write <i>tefillin</i> and mezuzot without [looking at] an existent text, because everyone is familiar with these passages<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:20, 29), however, emphasizes that one should carefully check the passages of the <i>tefillin</i> to make sure that they were written correctly. One who does not know the passages by heart should write from an existent text.
</i>. It is, however, forbidden to write even one letter of a Torah scroll without [looking at] an existent text<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Even a person who knows the passages by heart may err, because sometimes the spellings of words are different from their pronunciations (<i>Megillah</i> 18b).
The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 274:3) quotes a difference of opinion among the Rabbis if, after the fact, it is permitted to use a Torah scroll that was not written from an existent text.

Though our texts follow the standard published texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the authoritative manuscripts substitute the word <i>min</i> for <i>apikoros</i>.
The difference between the two versions is significant. In <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:8, the Rambam defines an <i>apikoros</i> as a person who denies the Torah and/or the prophetic tradition, while in <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:7, he describes a <i>min</i> as a person who does not believe in God. When a <i>min</i> writes a Torah scroll, the names of God it contains do not possess any holiness, because he does not believe in God at all. In contrast, since an <i>apikoros</i> does believe in God, were he to write a Torah scroll the names he writes would possess a certain dimension of holiness.
</i>hould be burned. I<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> or Jewish property
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In <i>Hilchot Yesodei Torah</i> 6:8, the Rambam explains why burning such a scroll does not violate the prohibition against destroying God's name:
He does not believe in the sanctity of [God's] name and did not compose it for a sacred purpose. Rather, he considers this to be similar to any other text. Since this is his intent, the names [of God he writes] do not become holy.
Significantly, the Rambam does not state that we presume that the scribe had the intention that the name of God refer to a false deity. Note, however, the Rambam's statements in <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 2:5: ""[It can be assumed that] a <i>min's</i> thoughts are concerned with false gods."" <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 39:4 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 39:13 refer to the latter statement and explain that the passages should be burned, because the names of God refer to a false deity.
<i>Shabbat</i> 116a draws a parallel between the burning of such a Torah scroll and the scroll of a <i>sotah</i> (a woman accused of adultery). In the process of a <i>sotah's</i> trial, a scroll on which is written a passage containing God's name is blotted out. Our Sages conclude that just as God is willing to allow His name to be wiped out to establish peace between a man and his wife, so, too, He allows His name to be destroyed because of these individuals who disturb the peace that exists between Him and His people.

The severity of this transgression is emphasized by the Rambam, who includes a <i>moseir</i> in the 24 categories of individuals who do not have a portion in the world to come. (See <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 3:6,12.)
Similarly, in <i>Hilchot Chovel UMazik</i> 8:10, the Rambam states that a <i>moseir</i> may be killed to prevent him from betraying a Jew's life or property to gentiles. Because of the severity of this transgression, the Rambam considers such an individual equivalent to an outright nonbeliever.

At one point, the Samaritans converted and were considered to be Jews by the Sages. Towards the latter portion of the Second Temple period, it was discovered that they had remained idolaters. From that time onward, they were regarded as gentiles by the Sages, and the term <i>kuti</i> was used to refer to gentiles.

The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 39:16 explains that, at present, we can assume that the sacred articles are acceptable, because today a gentile would not know how to make them himself. Accordingly, we can assume that they were taken from a Jew.
Even the opinions which do not allow the sacred articles purchased from the gentiles to be used require that they be redeemed and entombed, because of our regard for the sacred articles and our fear that the gentiles would treat them sacrilegiously.
<b>We should not, however, purchase Torah scrolls, <i>tefillin</i>, or mezuzot from gentiles for more than they are worth -</b> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 39:7; <i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 281:1) suggests paying slightly more than their worth.

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 1.15","When a person writes a Torah scroll, <i>tefillin</i>, or <i>mezuzah</i> without having [the proper] intention<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 274:1) states that before a scribe writes a Torah scroll, he should state that he is writing it for the sake of the holiness of a Torah scroll. Making that statement at the outset is sufficient for the entire Torah scroll. If he fails to make this statement, the scroll is not acceptable. Similar rules apply to <i>tefillin</i> (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 32:19) and mezuzot.
Rav Chayim Soloveitchik notes that this is not the Rambam's view. The phrasing of this halachah clearly implies that the Rambam does not consider the lack of proper intention when writing a Torah scroll sufficient to render it unacceptable. Thus, with regard to preparing the parchment, one is required to have the intent that it be used for the mitzvah, while that intent is not necessary when one is actually writing the scroll.
Rav Chayim differentiates between the two deeds as follows: Preparing the parchment is, in essence, a mundane act. Accordingly, the dimension of holiness that makes the parchment fit for use as a Torah scroll must be added by our intentions. In contrast, writing the scroll is, in essence, a holy act. Accordingly, there is no need for anything to be added by our intention.

The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 32:19) also states with regard to writing God's name in <i>tefillin</i>, that, if the scribe made a verbal statement that he is writing the Torah scroll for the desired pupose, after the fact, it is sufficient merely to have had the desired intent in mind when writing God's name without expressing it verbally.

In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Yadayim</i> 4:5), the Rambam explains the latter opinion, stating that <i>Ashurit</i> means ""the finest and most choice."" This name was given to this calligraphy because:
It is the most choice calligraphy. Its characters are not interchangeable... nor do they resemble each other to the extent that doubt might arise.... This does not apply with regard to other scripts.
It was adopted by the Jewish people in the Babylonian exile after the destruction of the First Temple. In previous (and subsequent) generations, Hebrew was generally written with other characters.

"Tefillin, Mezuzah and the Torah Scroll 1.20","[The following rules apply to] parchment which has holes: One should not write over a hole<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rashi, <i>Shabbat</i> 108a, associates this ruling with the interpretation, וכתב תם, quoted from <i>Shabbat</i> 103b above. Writing which is ""perfect"" should not be broken by holes in the parchment.

[The latter principle has ramifications in contemporary society. Today, many scribes check mezuzot and <i>tefillin</i> using light tables and/or magnifying glasses. The cracks or perforations they find in this manner are not significant and cannot disqualify a parchment.]

There is no obligation that the letter be surrounded by parchment on the inside.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 32:15, quotes the Rambam's opinion, but also mentions a passage from the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Megillah</i> 1:9), which requires that the letter be surrounded by parchment on the inside as well. Most Ashkenazic halachic authorities suggest accepting the stringency of the Jerusalem Talmud's ruling.

Torah Study 5.1,"Just as a person is commanded to honor his father and hold him in awe<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Exodus 20:12 commands: ""Honor your father and mother."" Leviticus 19:3 commands: ""A man shall fear his mother and father."" (See <i>Hilchot Mamrim</i>, Chapter 6, for a discussion of these mitzvot.)
</i>, so, too, is he obligated to honor his teacher and hold him in awe<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> All the particulars of this halachah apply only regarding <i>rabo hamuzhak,</i> a teacher from whom one has learned the majority of one's wisdom (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 33a.) (See also the commentary on the next halachah.) However, every teacher under whom one has studied Torah deserves a certain measure of respect (Halachah 9).
</i>.<br>[Indeed, the measure of honor and awe] due one's teacher exceeds that due one's father. His father brings him into the life of this world<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., he sired him and provided him with his fundamental necessities
</i>, while his teacher, who teaches him wisdom, brings him into the life of the world to come<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> A person's Torah study and the mitzvot it motivates are the means through which he will attain a portion of the world to come.
The reason given by the Rambam has its source in <i>Bava Metzia</i>, <i>ibid.</i> <i>Keritot</i> 28a states a different reason: ""He and his father are both obligated to honor his teacher."" The Rambam quotes this in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Mitzvah 209).
</i>.<br>[Accordingly,] if he saw a lost object belonging to his father and one belonging to his teacher, the lost object belonging to his teacher takes precedence<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Therefore, he should tend to his teacher's article first.

If his father and his teacher are both carrying loads, he should relieve his teacher's load, and then his father's<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Keritot</i> 6:9, the Rambam equates removing a load with returning a lost article and redeeming a person from captivity in all respects. Accordingly, as explained below, if one's father is also a Torah sage, he should be given priority. However, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that where there is no danger to life or property, and only honor is involved, priority should be given to one's teacher, even if one's father is a Torah sage of equivalent stature.
</i>. If his father and his teacher are held as captives, he should redeem his teacher, and afterwards, redeem his father<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Note <i>Hilchot Matnot Ani'im</i>, 8:10-18, for a discussion of this important mitzvah.
</i>. However, if his father is [also] a Torah sage, h<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> even if he is not equivalent to his teacher (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>)
</i>e should redeem his father first.<br>[S<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The commentaries have noted the apparent contradiction between this statement and <i>Hilchot Aveidah</i> 12:2, which states:
[The following rule applies when] one sees a lost object belonging to his teacher and a lost object belonging to his father: If his father was equal in stature to his teacher, his father's [lost article] is given precedence. If not, his teacher's is given precedence.<br>
This applies only to a person's primary teacher, from whom he learned the majority of his wisdom.
The text of <i>Bava Metzia</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the source for this decision, is closer to the text in <i>Hilchot Aveidah</i>. Indeed, on that basis, the <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> and others maintain that our text contains a printing error. However, that conclusion is difficult to accept, since in his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Keritot</i> <i>ibid.</i>, the Rambam gives a father who is a Torah sage priority over a person's teacher, without requiring that the father be of greater stature.
The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> explains that our text refers to a situation when it is possible to retrieve both lost objects, and the only question is whose is given priority. In contrast, <i>Hilchot Aveidah</i> refers to a situation where it is possible to return only one of the lost objects.
Alternatively, the Tashbaytz (Responsa, Vol. III, 275) and the Radbaz (Responsa, Vol. V, 1493) explain that here we are referring to a father who has also instructed his son (albeit, not to the same degree as his teacher). In contrast, <i>Hilchot Aveidah</i> refers to a father who has not instructed his son at all.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This decision is disputed with regard to the return of a lost object, as explained below. Nevertheless, with regard to the redemption of captives, all agree that because of the life-and-death nature of the question, one's father is given priority if he has achieved some level of scholarship.
</i>imilarly,] if his father is a Torah sage - even if he is not equivalent to his teacher - he should return his lost article, and then that belonging to his teacher.<br>There is no greater honor than that due a teacher, and no greater awe than that due a teacher.

Torah Study 5.2,"What is meant by disputing the authority of one's teacher?<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned in the commentary on the previous halachah, Halachah 9 states:
When does the above apply? To one's outstanding teacher (<i>rabo hamuzhak</i> ), from whom one has gained the majority of one's wisdom. However, a person who has not gained the majority of his wisdom under a teacher's instruction is considered to be both a student and colleague. He is not obligated to honor him in all the above matters.
</i> A person who<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> studied under a teacher and then
</i> establishes a house of study [where] he sits, explains, and teaches<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and renders halachic decisions. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i> 242:7 (see also <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>) explains that the prohibition applies only to rendering halachic decisions on matters directly related to practice. There is no difficulty involved in teaching on a merely theoretical level. However, it is not clear whether the Rambam would accept this view.
The <i>Rishon Letzion</i> explains that this prohibition applies even to establishing a house of study under one's own direction, even though one does not render any halachic decisions.
</i> without his teacher's permission<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> A person granted permission by his teacher is allowed to render halachic decisions outside his teacher's presence. The Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 242:14) equates a teacher's granting permission to a student to render halachic decisions to the concept of <i>semichah</i> within its present context (in contrast to its definition in Talmudic times).
</i> in his teacher's lifetime<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> It is a mark of disrespect to one's teacher to set oneself up to be an equivalent authority.
<i>Eruvin</i> 62b relates that as long as Rav Huna was alive, Rav Chisda, his disciple, would not render any decisions, even those concerning as obvious a matter as dipping ""an egg in a mixture of sour milk and bread.""
After the teacher's death, there is no restriction, provided one is fit to render Torah judgments. (See Halachot 3 and 4.)
</i>. [This applies] even when one's teacher is in another country<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This can be derived from <i>Eruvin</i> 63a, which states that Rav Hamnuna would not render judgments in Rav Huna's lifetime, even though they lived in different cities.
Even though a person has been granted permission by his teacher to render halachic judgments...
</i>.<br>It is forbidden to ever render a halachic judgment<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> except in the instances mentioned in the following halachah. The Vilna Gaon explains that this includes even teaching a halachic concept incidentally, outside the context of a house of study.
</i> in one's teacher's presence<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam defines this term in the next halachah.
<i>Ketubot</i> 60b relates that, without considering the question of respect due one's teacher, there is an additional problem. Spiritual influences will cause a student who renders a halachic judgment in his teacher's presence to err.
The Maharik (Responsum 169) states that if a student has reached a stature approximate to that of his teacher, he is permitted to render halachic judgments even in his teacher's presence. He points to many Talmudic passages which record halachic decisions given by Resh Lakish in the presence of Rabbi Yochanan (his teacher).
<i>Siftei Cohen</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 242:12) explains that it is possible to say that the Rambam would accept this decision. However, there is no intimation of such a concept in the Rambam's words.
</i>. Whoever renders a halachic judgment in his teacher's presence is worthy of death<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Eruvin</i> 63a explains that Nadav and Avihu, Aharon's sons, died (Leviticus, Chapter 10) because of this sin. (See also <i>Berachot</i> 31b.)
Rendering a judgment outside one's teacher's presence without his permission and rendering a judgment in his presence with his permission, although forbidden, are not deserving of such a punishment.
It must be emphasized that today, when most of our Torah knowledge is gained from the study of texts and not from personal instruction, many authorities maintain that this entire concept does not apply. (See <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i>, <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, Halachah 5.) However, this opinion is not accepted by all authorities. (See Maharik, Responsum 169.)

(See also <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 20:9.)

When Rav Ashi saw this, he questioned Ravina, because the latter's actions appeared to be disrespectful. Ravina explained that since a transgression was involved (making use of a tree on the Sabbath), he was obligated to take these steps.

However, establishing oneself as a halachic authority to sit and reply to all who ask concerning halachic matters is forbidden<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for this clearly applies that the student considers his authority as equivalent (or at least, similar) to that of his teacher. Doing so without permission is considered to be an affront to his teacher's honor.

b) the student receives permission from his teacher.<br>Not everyone whose teacher dies is permitted to sit and render judgment concerning Torah law; only one who is a student worthy of rendering judgment<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 19b requires a student to be forty years of age before he is considered to be worthy of rendering halachic judgments. In summation of that entire passage, Rabbenu Nissim writes that a Torah sage is not entitled to render a halachic judgment until he reaches 40, unless there is no sage of equivalent status in his city. He questions why the Rambam makes no mention of this requirement.
Among the resolutions offered for the Rambam's decision are:<br>
a) The Rambam interprets the passage from <i>Avodah Zarah</i> to mean that only until he is forty years old can a worthy student hold himself back from rendering judgment because of his humility. He does not mention this law here, since the unworthy students have become so numerous, and at present, no worthy student should hesitate from rendering judgment at all (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>
b) The Talmud's decision refers only to a student who received his instruction from an individual teacher. At present, since students gain their knowledge from texts which are always available, there is no such restriction (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>).<br>
c) The Rambam places the entire emphasis on a student's capability and does not pay attention to the age factor (<i>Merchevat Hamishneh</i>).
Though the latter paragraph is included in this halachah in the published texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, many manuscripts include it in the following halachah.

Torah Study 5.4,"Any student who is not worthy of rendering halachic judgments and does so is foolish, wicked, and arrogant<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's statements are based on <i>Avot</i> 4:9, which uses these adjectives to describe a person who ""renders halachic judgments casually.""

In contrast, if [the sage] refrains because he knows that there is another individual fit to render halachic judgments, ""he is praiseworthy.""

Thus, if the teacher's name is common, it is permitted to refer by name to another person with the same name. Nevertheless, the Rambam's words raise questions concerning the commonly followed practice of naming a child after one's parent or teacher, even when that name is unique.
[A student] should not greet his teacher or respond to the latter's greeting, as is customary when two friends exchange greetings. - <i>Berachot</i> 27b states: ""A person who greets his teacher causes the Divine Presence to depart from Israel.""

It must be noted that the phrase <i>shalom elecha rebbe</i> has been given halachic significance in totally different contexts. For example, a person who takes an oath is allowed to retract his statements if he changes his mind <i>toch k’dei dibbur</i> (in the midst of speaking). What is considered ""in the midst of speaking""? The time it takes to say <i>shalom elecha rebbe</i> (<i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 2:17). Similar laws apply with regard to witnesses who want to retract testimony made in court.

Torah Study 5.6,"Similarly, he should not remove his <i>tefillin</i> in the presence of his teacher<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rav David Arameah notes that this law is found in the <i>Shimusha Rabbah</i>. His version of that text leads him to the interpretation ""before,"" rather than ""in the presence of"" - i.e., first, the teacher should remove his <i>tefillin</i>, and then the student. However, the <i>Shibbolei HaLeket</i> and others render the <i>Shimusha Rabbah</i> as translated here.
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cites <i>Sanhedrin</i> 101b, which forbids removing one's <i>tefillin</i> in the presence of a king. Since <i>Horayot</i> 13a relates that a Torah sage is more deserving of a honor than a king, there are those who quote this as a source for our halachah.

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Rashi, <i>Berachot</i> 27a, explains that doing so would be an expression of pride, implying a degree of equivalence to his teacher.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i> 242:16, states that there is no prohibition if one stands more than four cubits away from his teacher. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) also states that these restrictions apply only when praying as individuals and not when participating in communal prayer.

Torah Study 5.7,"A person is obligated to stand before his teacher from the time he sees him - as far away as he can see - until [he passes beyond his field of vision] and is hidden: his figure no longer visible. Then, [the student] may sit<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The above halachah states that as soon as the sage passes him, the person may sit. The requirement to show an extra degree of respect to one's own teacher can be derived from the example of Rabbi Eliezer, who showed such deference to his teacher, Rabbi Yochanan (<i>Yoma</i> 53a).
</i>.<br>A person is obligated to visit his teacher during the festivals<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sukkah</i> 27b relates:
An incident occurred concerning Rabbi Ellai, who journeyed to visit his teacher, Rabbi Eliezer, in Lod during a festival.<br>
He told him: ""Ellai, you are not one of those who rests on the festivals,"". Rabbi Eliezer would say: ""I praise the lazy ones who do not leave their homes during the festivals, because it is written: 'And you shall rejoice on your festivals.’“<br>
That is unacceptable, because Rabbi Yitzchak taught: What is the source for the obligation that a person has to visit his teacher on the festival, it is written: ""Why are you going to him today? It is not a day of rest or a new moon."" From this we can infer that on a day of rest and on the new moon, a person is obligated to visit his teacher.<br>
There is no difficulty: the [latter reference] applies when he can go back and forth in one day.
The Rambam interprets Rabbi Yitzchak's statement simply, because, in a number of other instances (<i>Sukkah</i> 10b, 26a), the Talmud relates how students would visit their teachers on festivals.
The <i>Nodah Biyhudah, Orach Chayim</i>, Vol. II, Responsum 94, notes that this law is not quoted by the <i>Tur</i> or the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>. Therefore, he explains that it applies only in the time of the Temple. In contrast, at present, since the Temple is destroyed and the festival pilgrimages are no longer made, it is improper to make a special visit to one's teacher. Doing so would imply that one is showing him greater deference than is shown the Divine Presence.
This view is not accepted by many commentators. Indeed, the Talmudic references to visiting one's teacher during the festival cited above took place in the period after the destruction of the Temple. Based on the statement quoted in Halachah 1, ""Your fear for your teacher should be equivalent to your fear of Heaven,"" <i>Kinat Eliyahu</i> explains that there is a parallel between a visit to one's teacher and a pilgrimage to the Temple.

When a student has the opportunity to appreciate not only the intellectual gifts of his teacher, but the totality of his behavior, he becomes aware of how a Torah lifestyle is an all-encompassing commitment, affecting every aspect of his daily activity. This leads to complete fear of heaven.

Torah Study 5.9,"[A student who] saw his teacher transgress the words of the Torah should tell him: you have taught us such and such.<br>Whenever he<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> a student

</i> presence, he should tell him: ""You have taught us the following, master<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Sanhedrin</i> 99b, 101a states:
Who is an <i>epicurus</i> (nonbeliever)?<br>
A person who relates a concept from another source that occurred to him while he was sitting before his teacher, and states: ""This is what is said there,"" rather than ""This is what you taught us, master.""
Similarly, <i>Mo'ed Katan</i> 7b relates that once Rabbi Chiyya mentioned a teaching before his teacher, Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi, and prefaced his statements with the expression: ""You have taught us the following, master.""
[From that passage, it appears that Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi had not actually made that statement, and Rabbi Chiyya's remarks were merely a polite token of respect.]
Even when a student is not in his teacher's presence...
He<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the student
</i> should not mention a concept which he did not hear from his teacher unless he mentions the name of the person who authored it. - In general, there is an obligation to mention a concept in the name of its author (<i>Megillah</i> 15a). However, in this instance, there is a particular obligation to do so, lest it be assumed that this teaching was authored by one's teacher.
The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 2:1) mentions the following incident: Rabbi Yochanan was walking, supported by Rabbi Ya'akov bar Iddi. Rabbi Yochanan complained to him that his student, Rabbi Eliezer, never made statements in his name.
Rabbi Ya'akov told him that there was a precedent to such behavior. Rabbi Meir would quote teachings in the name of Rabbi Yishmael, but would not quote teachings in the name of Rabbi Akiva, his teacher.<br>
Rabbi Yochanan answered that there was nothing wrong with that, because everyone knew that Rabbi Meir was Rabbi Akiva's disciple, and most of his teachings came from him.
Rabbi Ya'akov explained that the same concept applied at present: ""Everyone knows that Rabbi Eliezer is your disciple, and that most of his teachings are yours.""
Thus, were a student to mention a concept without mentioning its source, it is likely for the listeners to assume that it was authored by his teacher. If, in fact, it was authored by someone other than his teacher, and his teacher would not have approved of it, creating such an impression would not be respectful to his teacher.
</i>."" He should not mention a concept which he did not hear from his teacher unless he mentions the name of the person who authored it.<br>When his teacher dies, he should rend all his garments until he reveals his heart<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> With regard to the rending of one's garments until one's heart is revealed, see <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 8:3, 9:2 and <i>Mo'ed Katan</i> 22a.

On this basis, the Rambam concludes that the same principle applies regarding the extent one rends his garments.
The Rambam draws this comparison from Elisha's behavior at the death of Elijah, his teacher. II Kings 2:12 relates: ""He cried out, 'Father, Father, Chariot of Israel,'....He took hold of his clothes and rent them into two...."" (<i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 9:5).
[At present, it is very uncommon to see a student rend his garments at his teacher's passing. Among the rationalizations for the present custom is the opinion of the <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> and the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> mentioned above, that at present we derive most of our knowledge from books. Accordingly, the concept of a <i>rav hamuzhak</i> does not apply.]

</i>However, a person who has not gained the majority of his wisdom under a teacher's instruction is considered to be both a student and colleague<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> of the latter.
Rashi, <i>Eruvin</i> 63a, defines the term <i>talmid chavair</i> (a student and a colleague), as a sage of equivalent stature who has learned some concepts from the ""teacher.""

</i>, as he does for all the deceased for whom he is obligated to mourn<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., one's brother, sister, spouse, son, daughter, and parents.
Many commentaries note the apparent contradiction between this halachah, which implies that it is sufficient to rend one's garments a handbreadth, and <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 9:11, which states that one is obligated to rend one's garments over the passing of a sage (even if he is not one's outstanding teacher) until one reveals his heart.
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> writes that the law in <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> applies only to a sage accepted as a city's halachic authority, while the present halachah refers even to a personage of lesser stature. The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> writes that the law in <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> is incumbent on the common people, while a person who is himself a Torah sage is not obligated to make such a large gesture of mourning.

From the Rambam's statements, it appears that the additional light is kindled by the master of of the household and not by each of the members of the household themselves.

Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.4,"When a candleholder has two openings<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and a wick is kindled in both of them

This law is applicable to the <i>mehadrin</i> (see Halachah 1), who light a candle for each individual (Rashi, <i>Shabbat</i> 23b). Alternatively, this law is relevant for two people whose doorways are adjacent to each other or when two people live in the same house, but do not share in their household expenses (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).
The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 671:2 states that according to the Ashkenazic custom, in which each person lights his own candles, two people should not light candles using the same candleholder even on the first night. A passerby might see the two lights and instead of thinking they were lit by two different people, he might err and think that one person lit both candles because it is the second night of the holiday.
Since the purpose of lighting candles is <i>pirsumei nisa</i>, publicizing the Chanukah miracle, the impression created in an onlooker's mind is significant. Therefore, two people should not light candles in this manner.
</i>.<br>[The following rules apply when] one fills a bowl with oil and surrounds it with wicks: If one covers it with a utensil<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The flames from each of the lights will not merge together. Therefore,

In light of this halachah, the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 671:4) discusses the use of a circular candelabrum. The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 671:18 mentions that in such a candelabrum, each candleholder should be at least one fingerbreadth from the other.

Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.5,"The Chanukah candles should not be kindled before sunset<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Most commentaries interpret the Rambam's intent as the time when the sun disappears from the horizon. The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 672:1) interpret ""sunset"" in this context as referring to the time when there is no sunlight visible - i.e., the appearance of three stars. Many of the later authorities, however, accept the Rambam's ruling. (See the <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 672.)
The candles should not be lit before sunset, since their purpose is to publicize the Chanukah miracles. During the daytime, no one will notice them and this purpose will not be served.
</i>. Instead, [they should be kindled] at sunset<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is the ideal time to kindle them. Since the sun has already set, the candle's light will be noticed. On the other hand, since there is still some light outside, it is obvious that the candles are being lit for the purpose of publicizing the Chanukah miracle and not for one's individual needs.
</i>. One should not light later<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> At night, it is customary to kindle lights. Therefore, if a person lights the candles at this time, an onlooker may err and think that he is lighting for his own needs and not for the sake of the mitzvah. Nevertheless, on Saturday night, when there is no alternative, we light the candles after the appearance of the stars.
</i> or earlier<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 672:1) cites an opinion which states that from <i>plag haminchah</i> (an hour and a quarter before nightfall) onward, a person who is busy and will not have an opportunity later may kindle the Chanukah lights. He must, however, place enough oil within them for them to continue burning for half an hour after nightfall.
On Friday night, we all rely on this opinion and kindle the Chanukah lights shortly before sunset. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 679).
</i>.<br>Should one forget, or even if one purposely did not light at sunset<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> although the most appropriate time for fulfilling the mitzvah has passed
</i>, one may light afterwards until there are no longer any passersby in the marketplace<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Once the passersby no longer walk in the street, one will not be publicizing the Chanukah miracle by lighting candles.
</i>.<br>How long a duration of time is this? Approximately half an hour or slightly more than that<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Thus, according to the Rambam, after half an hour past sunset, kindling the candles no longer fulfills a mitzvah. The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 672:2) states that in the present age, since it is customary to light inside one's house (see Halachah 8 and commentary), the essential element of publicizing the Chanukah miracle is to involve one's own family in the candle lighting. Therefore, one fulfills the mitzvah as long as the members of one's household are awake.
The Ramah, nevertheless, counsels that at the outset, one should try to adhere to the stricter view. In light of these statements, the common practice of lighting the Chanukah candles well after nightfall should be examined. Is it correct to refrain willfully from fulfilling the mitzvah in the most desirable manner, and perhaps, according to the Rambam, not to fulfill it at all?
</i>. Should this time pass, one should not kindle the lights<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This appears to indicate that, according to the Rambam, it is undesirable to light the candles afterwards. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 672:2), however, quotes the opinion of the <i>Tur</i>, which states that if one did not light the candles at the proper time, one should light them throughout the night. (There is, however, a question about the recitation of a blessing.)
</i>.<br>One should place enough oil in the lamp<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> When one lights the candles, they should have the amount of oil mentioned. It is improper to light with a smaller amount of oil and add more afterwards. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 675:2.)
</i> so that it will continue burning until there are no longer any passersby in the marketplace<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> At present, in deference to the opinion that states that the time for candle lighting begins after nightfall, even when a person kindles Chanukah candles at sunset, enough oil should be placed in the candelabrum for the candles to burn until half an hour after nightfall.
</i>. If one lit it and it became extinguished, one need not light it a second time<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 673:2) prefaces this law by stating the principle, ""kindling fulfills the mitzvah."" Although the Chanukah candles should burn for half an hour, one fulfills the mitzvah only when lighting them. Thus, one must light them in a manner that - barring any unexpected events - they will be able to burn for a half an hour - e.g., they must have a sufficient amount of oil to burn for that period and they must not be placed where they could be extinguished by the wind. Once a person has taken these precautions, however, he has no further obligation.
Note, however, the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 673:27, which states that it is proper to relight the candles so that they will burn for the desired time.
</i>. If it remained burning until there are no longer passersby in the marketplace<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> there is no longer any purpose in having the candles burning. Thus the mitzvah is concluded and therefore
</i>, one may extinguish it or remove it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> While the candles are burning, however, they should not be moved. See also Halachah 9 and commentary.
</i> if one desires<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Kinat Eliyahu</i> notes that at the present time, it is customary for people to walk or travel at night after nightfall. For this reason, perhaps the Chanukah candles should be left burning for longer than a half an hour. For as long as they are burning, the intent of <i>pirsumei nisa</i>, publicizing the Chanukah miracle, is fulfilled.

Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.6,"All oils and all wicks are acceptable for use in the Chanukah lamps<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is a contrast to the Sabbath laws. As explained in Chapter 2 of the tractate of <i>Shabbat</i> and Chapter 5 of the Rambam's <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i>, there are certain oils and wicks that are unacceptable for use for the Sabbath candles.
</i>, even those oils that are not drawn after the wick<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is the primary reason one is not allowed to use these oils on the Sabbath. Since they are not drawn after the wick, their light does not burn brightly. A person might inadvertently tilt the lamp for the light to shine brighter, and thus transgress the Sabbath laws. There is no reason for caution in this regard on Chanukah, as explained below. Hence, there is no difficulty in using such oil.
Although all oils are acceptable for the Chanukah candles, the Rabbis have suggested using olive oil, for this was the oil used to light the Menorah in the Temple (Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 673:1, <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 673:4). If olive oil is not available, one should use beeswax candles.
</i> and even those wicks that do not hold the light well<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Here also, these wicks were forbidden for use for the Sabbath candles lest one tilt the light.
Although all wicks are acceptable, it is customary to use wicks of flax or of cotton (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 673:2).
</i>. Even on the Sabbath nights of Chanukah, it is permitted to light<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the Chanukah lights
</i> with oils and wicks that are forbidden to be used for the Sabbath lights<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Needless to say, the prohibition against using these candles for the Sabbath lights still remains in effect.
</i>.<br>[The reason for this leniency is that]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In addition to the reason cited by the Rambam in this halachah, <i>Shabbat</i> 21b mentions the principle stated in the previous halachah: If a Chanukah candle is extinguished, there is no obligation to light it again.
Thus, the reason these wicks and oils may be used on the Sabbath of Chanukah can be explained as follows: We are not worried about the candles being extinguished, because even in that eventuality, there is no obligation to relight the candles. Nor are we worried that one will tilt the Chanukah candles so that their light will shine brighter, because:
</i> it is forbidden to use the Chanukah candles [for one's own purposes]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> During the week, this prohibition applies only during the first half hour that the candles are burning. Afterwards, their mitzvah is completed, as stated in the previous halachah.
</i> whether on the Sabbath or on a weekday<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Sabbath candles were instituted to bring about <i>sh'lom bayit</i>, ""peace in the home,"" through the use of their light. In contrast, the Chanukah candles were instituted for <i>pirsumei nisa</i>, publicizing the Chanukah miracle. To emphasize this purpose, the Sages forbade using them for any other purpose.
Furthermore, the Chanukah candles were instituted to commemorate the miracle of the Menorah in the Temple. Thus, just as it is forbidden to use the Menorah's light for any worldly purpose, so too, the light of the Chanukah candles is prohibited (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 673:8).
</i>. It is even forbidden to use their light to inspect or count coins<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Shabbat</i> 22a relates that this prohibition was instituted so that the mitzvot would be viewed with respect. If a person were able to use the light of the Chanukah lamp for his own purposes, he would treat the mitzvah with little regard.
In this halachah, the Rambam is describing a situation when the Chanukah candles are lit outside the home (where it is unlikely that the light of the candles will be used for mundane purposes). In Halachah 8, he mentions the lighting of candles within the home (and it is likely that work will be carried out within the home at that time). Therefore, it is in that halachah that he mentions the custom of lighting another candle (the <i>shamash</i>) next to the Chanukah candles, so that if a person carries out an activity near the candles, he will be using the light of that additional candle.
See also the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), which questions whether it is permissible to use the Chanukah candles for a holy purpose - e.g., to study Torah by their light.
</i>."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.7,"It is a mitzvah to place<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As is obvious from Halachah 9, the Chanukah lamp should be placed outside before being lit.
""IR1200</i> the Chanukah lamp at the outside of the entrance to one's home<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned previously, the mitzvah of lighting Chanukah candles was instituted for the purpose of <i>pirsumei nisa</i>, publicizing the Chanukah miracle. Therefore, the candles should be placed at the outside of one's dwelling to attract the attention of the passersby in the public domain (Rashi, <i>Shabbat</i> 21b).
In a spiritual sense, this points to the potential possessed by the Chanukah candles to spread light beyond the normal limits of holiness. Generally, mitzvot are performed within a home or synagogue. In this instance, the nature of the mitzvah is to spread light to the public domain, to illuminate the darkness of the world at large.
""IX </i>, within the handbreadth that is closest to the doorway<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> If the candelabrum were placed any further away, it would not be obvious that the owner of the home placed it there for the purpose of kindling Chanukah lights (<i>ibid.</i>).
</i> on the left side as one enters the home<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Generally, mitzvot are associated with the right side; the left side, by contrast, is identified with the forces of evil. Lighting the Chanukah candle on the left indicates a potential to refine and elevate the forces opposed to holiness (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. V).
</i>, so that the mezuzah will be on the right side<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as is required (see <i>Hilchot Mezuzah</i> 6:12)

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 671:7) states that if there is no mezuzah in the doorway, the Chanukah candles should be lit on the right side.
</i>.<br>When a person lives in a second storey apartment<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>:5) qualifies this to mean a second storey apartment that does not have a private entrance to the public domain or a courtyard. If the apartment has such an entrance, the Chanukah lamp should be lit at that entrance.

</i> [above the ground], his actions are of no consequence<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., he is not considered to have fulfilled the mitzvah
</i>, because [the lamp] does not attract attention [at that height]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> We see a similar concept with regard to the <i>s'chach</i> of a sukkah and the <i>korah</i> of an alleyway. If they are placed above twenty cubits, they are not acceptable (<i>Hilchot Sukkah</i> 4:11; <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 17:15).
Although the Rambam does not address himself to this issue, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and similarly, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>:6), state that the Chanukah lights should be placed between three and ten handbreadths high.
</i>."
Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.8,"In a time of danger, a person may place a Chanukah lamp inside his house<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Shabbat</i> 21b mentions this leniency. According to <i>Tosafot</i>, the danger refers to the persecutions of the Jews of Babylon by the ruling Persians for lighting candles mentioned in <i>Shabbat</i> 45a. Needless to say, there have been countless other periods of persecution in Jewish history.
It is, however, significant that even in times when there was no obvious danger, the custom has been to light the Chanukah candles inside our homes. Even in the present day, when there is little danger of persecution in most places where Jews are located, it is not customary to light the Chanukah candles at the entrance to the home in most communities.
</i>; even if he lit it on his table, it is sufficient<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., there is no necessity to light near a doorway. The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 671:7) states that it is preferable that the Chanukah lights be positioned near a doorway.
</i>.<br>[Therefore,] another lamp must be burning in the house to provide light for one's [mundane] activities<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned in Halachah 6, it is forbidden to use the light of the Chanukah lamp for a mundane purpose. Since it is very likely that there will be some activity carried out in the house while the candles are burning, an additional light should be kindled. Note the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 673:14, which explains that the present custom is to kindle an additional light near the Chanukah candles, besides the light that is ordinarily burning in the room.
This light, called the <i>shamash</i>, should be placed apart from the Chanukah candles so that it can be distinguished from them (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 673:1). Often, many commercially produced Chanukah lamps fail to make a sufficient distinction between this candle and the Chanukah lights themselves.
</i>. If a fire is burning in the house<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> One can use the light it produces for one's mundane activities; therefore

Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.9,"A Chanukah lamp that was kindled by a deaf-mute, a mentally incapable person, a minor, or a gentile is of no consequence<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., it does not constitute fulfillment of the mitzvah. All these four individuals are not obligated to fulfill mitzvot. Therefore, their kindling of the Chanukah lamp cannot fulfill the obligation instituted by our Sages.
Rabbenu Nissim mentions that a minor who is of the age when he is obligated to be trained in the fulfillment of the commandments may kindle the Chanukah lamps on behalf of the household. This opinion is not, however, accepted by other authorities, although they do mention that a child should be trained in the observance of the mitzvah of Chanukah candles as part of his process of education (<i>chinuch</i>).
Although the Rambam does not mention the latter concept explicitly, nevertheless, it is expected that he would agree. (See <i>Hilchot Nachalot</i> 11:10.)

There are two dimensions to every mitzvah: the performance of the deed itself (the <i>po'al</i>) - in this instance, the deed of kindling the Chanukah lights - and the effect of that performance (the <i>nif'al</i>), the fact that these lights are burning. This principle emphasizes that it is the kindling of the lights which is the focus of the mitzvah.
This is significant, for one might think that since the purpose of the mitzvah is <i>pirsumei nisa</i>, communicating the Chanukah miracles, what is most important is the fact that the lights are burning; how they are lit is of no consequence. This principle shows, however, that for <i>pirsumei nisa</i> to take place, the Chanukah lights must be kindled as prescribed by our Sages (<i>Kinat Eliyahu</i>).
</i>"" (<i>Shabbat</i> 23a). Since the mitzvah is fulfilled when the Chanukah lamp is being lit, the person lighting the lamp must be obligated in the mitzvah.

This law differs from the others stated in this halachah, which depend on the principle, ""Kindling the lamp fulfills the mitzvah and not placing it down."" Indeed, <i>Shabbat</i> 22b cites this law in an attempt to refute this principle. Nevertheless, although the above-mentioned principle is accepted, this law is still valid. Thus, it can be assumed that the Rambam mentions this law in this halachah only because it is mentioned in this context in the Talmud.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Shabbat</i> 22b explains that even those opinions that do not accept the principle, ""Kindling the lamp fulfills the mitzvah and not placing it down,"" would accept this law, because it would appear that one is carrying the lamp as a torch and using it to light the way.
</i>. One must light it in its place<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Furthermore, as an extension of this law, it is proper not to move the Chanukah candles at all for the half an hour that they are required to burn (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 675:6).

If, however, one held it while lighting it and placed it down, one is considered to have fulfilled the mitzvah.
The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 675:7, however, quotes other opinions, which do not accept this principle, and states that one should light the candles when the candelabrum is positioned in its place.

The rationale for this decision - and most of the other laws mentioned in this halachah - is the following principle:
</i>. Kindling the lamp fulfills the mitzvah and not placing it down.<br>It is permissible to light one Chanukah candle<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 674:2) cites an opinion that states that this also applies to other candles that are lit for the purpose of a mitzvah - e.g., the Sabbath candles.
</i> from another Chanukah candle<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Chanukah candles may not be used for any mundane purpose, for doing so is an act of disrespect for the mitzvah. <i>Shabbat</i> 22a states that using them to light another Chanukah candle is acceptable, however, since this is obviously not an act of disrespect.
The Rambam states this law in the present halachah, which deals with the principle, ""Kindling the lamp fulfills the mitzvah and not placing it down,"" because <i>Shabbat</i> 22b associates the two. Since ""kindling the lamp fulfills the mitzvah,"" the act of lighting the lamp is the essence of the mitzvah, and, therefore, using another Chanukah candle is not considered an act of disrespect. If, however, placing the Chanukah candles down constituted the mitzvah, the kindling of another candle would not be a direct fulfillment of a mitzvah. Therefore, it would not be proper to use another Chanukah lamp for that purpose (see Rashi, <i>Shabbat, loc. cit.</i>).
[Note, however, <i>Tosafot (Shabbat</i> 23a) and the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 674:1), which state that it is customary not to light one Chanukah candles from another.]
Among the questions also discussed with regard to this law is whether one must light the second candle from the first, or if it is acceptable if one lights a match from the first candle and uses it to light the second candle. To state the matter in terms of a question relevant to us: If the <i>shamash</i> is extinguished and one intends to use it to light other candles, may it be relit from a Chanukah candle which is already burning or not? Both opinions are mentioned in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 674:1). According to the later authorities, it is definitely desirable to light only a candle to be used for a mitzvah itself from the Chanukah lights.

<i>Shabbat</i> 23a, the source for this halachah, concerns itself with <i>yeshivah</i> students.

This implies that the obligation of kindling Chanukah lights is associated with an individual's dwelling, as well as with his person. I.e., although as stated in Chapter 3, Halachah 4, the obligation to kindle Chanukah lamps is incumbent on each person, the mitzvah is that every Jewish dwelling should be illuminated. Therefore, if Chanukah lamps are being kindled in one's dwelling, one has no further obligation regarding the mitzvah even though one does not see those Chanukah lamps oneself.
The rationale for this decision is that the Chanukah candles were instituted for the purpose of <i>pirsumei nisa</i>. Thus, what is important is that the light of the Chanukah lamps is perceived by others.
Note the Ramah's decision (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 677:3) that if a person desires, he may light the Chanukah lamps in the place where he is staying. This is common practice in the Ashkenazic community at present.
The Ramah states that such a person may also recite the blessings. This ruling is not accepted by many other authorities, who suggest that he hear the blessings recited by another person (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 677:16).

Scroll of Esther and Hanukkah 4.14,"If [a person has the opportunity to fulfill only one of two mitzvot,] lighting a lamp for one's home [i.e., Sabbath candles]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Perhaps the Rambam uses the expression ""lighting a lamp for one's home,"" rather than the expression ""the Sabbath lamp"" to emphasize that the focus is on how the Sabbath lamp leads to peace in the home.
</i> or lighting a Chanukah lamp - or, alternatively, lighting a lamp for one's home or reciting <i>kiddush</i> - t<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Shabbat</i> 23b associates the Sabbath candles with peace, explaining that they prevent the members of the household from stumbling over obstacles, and also allow them to avoid the discomfort of sitting in darkness.
Significantly, in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 5:1, the Rambam mentions that the Sabbath candles contribute to the atmosphere of <i>oneg Shabbat</i>, Sabbath pleasure. Similarly, in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 30:5, he mentions them as being associated with activities carried out in honor of the Sabbath (<i>k'vod Shabbat</i>). In the laws of the Sabbath itself, the Rambam does not mention the connection between the Sabbath candles and peace within the home.
This relates to the concept mentioned previously, that the peace generated by the Sabbath candles relates to the Torah as a whole and not to the Sabbath in particular (<i>Likkutei Sichot, loc. cit.</i>).
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> It is questionable why the Rambam mentions the latter law in <i>Hilchot Chanukah</i> when both the mitzvot concerned relate to the Sabbath. Although <i>Shabbat</i> 23b, the source for this halachah, refers to the two items mentioned in this halachah together, there is no necessity for the Rambam to do so. On the contrary, the Rambam structured the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> subject by subject. Seemingly, it would have been proper for him to mention this law in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i>. [Indeed, the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 263:3) mention this law in connection with the laws of the Sabbath as well.]
By structuring his text in this manner, however, the Rambam indicates that the priority of kindling Sabbath candles stems not from a particular law associated with the Sabbath, but rather from a general principle - the importance of peace - which relates to the entire Torah as a whole (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XV).
</i>he lamp for one's home receives priority, since it generates peace within the home.<br>[Peace is of primary importance, as reflected by the mitzvah requiring] God's name to be blotted out<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i>, Chapter 6, blotting out God's name is a severe matter and constitutes a Torah prohibition. Nevertheless, this prohibition is waived
</i> to create peace between a husband and his wife<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam is referring to the process of testing a <i>sotah</i>, a woman suspected of committing adultery. A curse against her containing God's name is written on a scroll. The text is rubbed out in water, and the water is given to the woman to drink. If she indeed committed adultery, she will die. (See Numbers 5:11-31; <i>Hilchot Sotah</i> 3:8-10.)
</i>. Peace is great, for the entire Torah was given<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam's choice of wording is extremely precise. The Torah does not exist for the world. On the contrary, <i>Shabbat</i> 88b relates that the Torah existed even before the world came into being. I.e., the Torah represents spiritual truths that transcend our material existence. Nevertheless, the Torah ""was given,"" drawn down into the context of our material frame of reference for a purpose,
</i> to bring about peace within the world, as [Proverbs 3:17] states: ""Its ways are pleasant ways and all its paths are peace<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This concept shares an intrinsic connection to Chanukah (and is therefore chosen as the conclusion for <i>Hilchot Chanukah</i>), because the Chanukah candles are intended for the purpose of <i>pirsumei nisa</i>. They project the light of Torah into the world at large and make the world conscious of its Godly purpose. The spreading of the awareness of Godliness is associated with peace, as reflected by the Rambam's statements at the conclusion of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>:

In that era (the Era of the Redemption), there will be... neither envy nor competition.... The occupation of the entire world will be solely to know God.... ""For the world will be filled with the knowledge of God as the waters cover the ocean bed.""

May we merit the coming of that era in the immediate future.

We have omitted this line, for nowhere else is a division of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> into parts mentioned.</i>"
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 8.1,"Communal prayer is always heard. Even when there are transgressors among [the congregation], the Holy One, blessed be He, does not reject the prayers of the many<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 8a cites Psalms 55:19: ""He delivered my soul in peace from the battle against me, for there were many who strove with me,"" as the prooftext for this concept.

Therefore, a person should include himself in the community<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This phrase is quoted - somewhat out of context - from <i>Berachot</i> 29b-30a which explains why we recite our prayers in the plural.

The Rambam uses the word ישכים - to rise early. Perhaps he is alluding to <i>Berachot</i> 47b which states:
One should always rise early and go to the synagogue in order to merit being counted among the first ten present. Even if 100 people come after him, he receives the reward of all of them.
Alternatively, perhaps he is referring to his statement, <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 1:11, that one should recite the <i>Shema</i> before sunrise.

""In the place of song (i.e., the synagogue where the people sing God's praises - Rashi), prayer should be [recited].""
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> adds that based on this concept, one should pray in the synagogue even when he is praying alone. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> also rules that if one is unable to go to the synagogue he should, at least, attempt to pray at the same time as the community. He quotes both these concepts in his <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 90:9.
Though this and the following two halachot mention the importance of a synagogue, the synagogue is discussed here only within the context of the importance of communal prayer. In Chapter 11, the Rambam focuses on the sanctity of the synagogue as a subject in its own right.
</i>.<br>Anyone who has a synagogue in his city and does not pray [together] with the congregation in it is called a bad neighbor<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Berachot</i> 8a derives this concept based on Jeremiah 12:14: ""So says God regarding all my evil neighbors that touch the inheritance (i.e., the synagogues and houses of study) that I have bequeathed to My people Israel.""
When quoting this law, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 90:11) also quotes the continuation of the above Talmudic passage:
Furthermore, they cause dispersion to themselves and their children as [the verse in Jeremiah continues]: ""Behold, I will uproot them from their land.""

The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 90) explains that this refers to a distance of eight handbreadths.
The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> interprets the Talmud's statement, ""the measure of two doorways"" as a matter of time, not distance. One should wait a few moments after entering the synagogue before he starts to pray.
The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> also states that according to the interpretation that the ""measure of two doorways"" refers to actual distance, this requirement only applies when the synagogue is located near the public thoroughfare. If it is not, one may pray near the door. Rabbenu Yonah also mentions that a person whose fixed place for prayer in the synagogue is beside the door does not violate this requirement. It is obvious that he is sitting there not because of his desire to leave quickly, but because it is his seat in the synagogue.

However, he also mentions the opinion of Rabbenu Asher (See Responsum 4) who writes that if the scholars do not appear in the synagogue the common people will assume that their presence is also unnecessary. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 90:18) quotes the Rambam's position.
</i>"
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 8.4,"What is implied by [the term,] communal prayer? One [person] prays aloud and all [the others] listen<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> With this statement, the Rambam touches on a point debated both by the Sages of the Talmud and the later Rabbis. The mishnah, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 33b, states:
Just as the leader of the congregation is obligated [to pray], each individual is obligated. Rabban Gamliel states: ""The leader of the congregation fulfills the obligation on behalf of the community.""
The Talmud (34b) elaborates on the difference of opinion:
They asked Rabban Gamliel: ""According to your opinion, why does the community pray?""<br>
He replied: ""In order to allow the leader of the community to prepare his prayers.""<br>
Rabban Gamliel asked them: ""According to your opinion, why does the leader of the congregation pray aloud?""<br>
They replied: ""In order to allow those who are not knowledgeable to fulfill their obligation.""<br>
He told them: ""Just as he fulfills the obligation on behalf of those who are not knowledgeable, he fulfills it on behalf of those who are knowledgeable.""
The Sages of the Talmud continued to debate the issue. The ultimate decision accepted by Rav Yitzchok Alfasi, the Rambam (See Halachah 9), and Rabbenu Asher, is that during the entire year, the Sages' opinion is accepted. However, on Rosh HaShanah, because of the complexity of the blessings (See Halachah 10), Rabban Gamliel's opinion prevails.
Both Rabban Gamliel and the Sages agree that the practice of communal prayer involves two elements:<br>
a) the silent prayers of many individuals; and<br>
b) the <i>chazan's</i> repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>.<br>
They differ, however, as to which of these elements is considered of primary importance. According to the Sages, the essential element of communal prayer is that ten or more people recite the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> at the same time. According to Rabban Gamliel, the essential element of communal prayer is, as the Rambam states in this halachah, the prayer of the leader of the congregation.
[Note <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 24, which explains that their difference of opinion revolves around a more general issue: Which is of higher priority, quantity (the prayers of the many) or quality (the prayers of the leader of the congregation)?]
The Rambam's statement here is difficult to place in perspective. Though in Halachah 9, he accepts the Sages' view (See also Chapter 9, Halachot 2-3) in this halachah, his opinion follows that of Rabban Gamliel. In one of his responsa, the Rambam explains that after the Sages instituted the silent <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> to allow the leader of the congregation to prepare his prayers, even Rabban Gamliel would agree that all the individuals praying in a <i>minyan</i> also fulfill their obligation to pray by reciting their own prayers. Still it is difficult to understand why the Rambam would have the individuals forfeit the higher quality of communal prayer in order to pray individually.
In his notes to <i>Rosh HaShanah</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, Rav Chayim Soloveichik writes that to take into consideration the Rambam's statements in this halachah, after concluding his individual prayers, each person should stand and listen to the prayer of the leader of the congregation and thus, fulfill the mitzvah of communal prayer. Note <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, which compares answering to the <i>chazan's</i> prayer to reciting a voluntary prayer (See Chapter 1, Halachah 9). By doing so, one will have both the advantages of individual and communal prayer.
</i>. This should not be done with fewer than ten<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Halachot 4 and 5.
</i> adult<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Males who have reached the age of thirteen years and a day and manifested signs of physical maturity. (See <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 3:19.)
The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam derives this halachah from <i>Berachot</i> 47b-48a which allows for the inclusion of a child in the <i>zimmun</i> for the grace after meals. (See <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 5:7.) We assume that this leniency was granted only in regard to grace, but not in regard to prayer. See also <i>Bereishit Rabbah</i> 91:3.
Many Halachic authorities do not accept this conclusion. In his siddur, Rav Sa'adia Gaon rules that a child may be counted as the tenth in a <i>minyan</i>. Similarly, the <i>Ba'al HaMe'or</i> holds that even up to four minors may be counted in a <i>minyan</i> for prayer.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chayim</i> 55:4), rules that a minor may not be included in a <i>minyan</i> for prayer. The <i>Ramah</i> adds that under extraordinary circumstances, a minor may be counted. There are opinions that in such a case, the minor must be at least six years old, understand that prayer is service to God, and hold a <i>chumash</i> (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 55:5, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 55:5).
</i> free males<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., excluding a Canaanite slave. However, a Jewish slave (עבד עברי) may be counted as part of a <i>minyan</i>. <i>Berachot</i> 47b relates that once, Rabbi Eliezer entered the synagogue and finding only nine people there, freed his slave to complete the quorum of ten.
</i>. The leader of the congregation is [counted as] one of them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though there is no explicit source to this effect, a number of midrashim (e.g., <i>VaYikra Rabbah</i> 23:4) lead to this conclusion.
One of the communal rites listed in <i>Megillah</i> 23b which requires a <i>minyan</i> is ברכת אבלים - the blessing one utters to those in mourning. For the recitation of that blessing, the presence of ten men other than the mourner himself is required. (See <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 13:1.) Perhaps the Rambam feels that this statement is necessary to clearly distinguish between the different requirements of a <i>minyan</i> for prayer and ברכת אבלים.
</i>.<br>Even if some of them have already prayed and fulfilled their obligation, they can complete the [quorum of] ten<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">
Our Sages in the West say [that <i>Kaddish</i> and <i>barchu</i> may be recited] even with seven. They explain their position [based on Judges 5:2]: ""In the time of tumult in Israel when the people volunteered themselves, blessed be God."" [The number of people correspond] to the number of words [in the verse which describes the blessing of God].<br>
There are those who say only six [are required], since ברכו is the sixth word [of the above verse].
The Rambam differentiates between the ruling regarding prayer and his statements in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 5:8 where he writes that it is necessary that seven people out of ten eat bread in order to constitute a <i>minyan</i> for <i>zimmun</i>, for ""a noticeable majority"" is required.
There are two views quoted in the name of Rabbenu Tam (<i>Tosafot, Megillah</i> 23b); one, requiring a minimum of seven people who have not prayed for a <i>minyan</i> just as seven who have eaten bread are required for a <i>minyan</i> in regard to grace after meals and, another, requiring, only five. However, the Rambam's opinion is universally accepted as halachah.
Similarly, we should not recite Kedushah, - See Chapter 7, Halachah 17.
In the <i>chazan's</i> repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, it is customary to recite three verses in the <i>Kedushah</i>:<br>
a) ""Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Hosts; the entire earth is full of His glory"" (Isaiah 6:3 ;<br>
b) ""Blessed be the glory of God from His place"" (Ezekiel 3:12 ;<br>
c) ""The Lord shall reign forever, your God, O Zion, throughout all generations"" (Psalms 146:10 .
Only the first two of these verses are recited in the <i>Kedushah</i> of the blessings before the <i>Shema</i>. However, in the<i>Kedushah</i> recited at the end of the service, a verse similar to Psalms 146:10 is also included.
The commentaries debate the definition of <i>Kedushah</i> and therefore, question which passage the Rambam requires to be omitted when one prays alone. The Rambam's statements in Chapter 9, Halachah 5, appear to define <i>Kedushah</i> as only the first of these three verses.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though they do not pray together with the others, their presence in the room where the others pray can complete a <i>minyan</i>.

If people want to fulfill their obligation to recite the blessings associated with the <i>Shema</i> by answering ""Amen"" to the <i>chazan's</i> blessings instead of reciting those blessings themselves, a quorum of ten is required. See also Chapter 9, Halachah 1.
[Rabbenu Yonah supports this definition of פריסה based on the Targum Yonaton of I Samuel 9:13.]

The <i>chazan</i> may also repeat the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> out loud including <i>Kedushah</i>, but he should not recite the <i>Kaddish</i> after <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, since it is not part of the ""holy matter"" started while the <i>minyan</i> was present.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 55:2-3) rules that, in such an instance, though the blessings of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> may be recited without deviating from the normal practice, the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> with <i>Kedushah</i> should not be recited. If the repetition of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> was begun with ten, it may be completed including its <i>Kedushah</i>.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> 55:20 also mentions that even when the people in adjoining rooms cannot see each other, those in the outer room may respond to <i>Kaddish</i> and <i>Kedushah</i>. The rabbis differed as to whether a person praying in a separate room next to the room where a <i>minyan</i> is praying may be considered to have participated in communal prayer or not (See <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 55:58).

</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See Chapter 2, Halachah 6, and in greater detail, <i>Hilchot Shofar</i> 3:8-9. There, the Rambam explains that, on these days, one is required to recite three extra blessings:<br>
<i>Malchuyut</i> - which expresses the theme of God's sovereignty,<br>
<i>Zichronot</i> - which describes God's remembrance of His love for the Jews, and<br>
<i>Shofrot</i> - which praises the shofar as a means of manifesting the previous two concepts.
Each of these three blessings includes the recitation of ten verses that express these themes: four from the Torah, three from the prophets, and three from Psalms.
In Chapter 2, Halachah 8, the Rambam writes that on Yom Kippur of the Jubilee year, one recites exactly the same blessings as on Rosh HaShanah.

Most of the commentaries point to the mishnah (<i>Ta'anit</i> 2:2) as the source for the Rambam's statements. Though that mishnah deals with the appointment of the leader of communal prayer for a public fast, there is no reason to assume that the same principles should not apply to the appointment of a <i>chazan</i> at other times.

Throughout the generations, in their responsa, our Rabbis have chided the people for putting a pleasant voice at the top of their priorities for a <i>chazan</i>. [Note the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 53:5) who states that it is preferable to appoint a boy of thirteen who understands his prayers as <i>chazan</i> rather than an older man with a pleasant voice who does not know what he is saying. See also <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i>, 53:11).]
In particular, this applies regarding the High Holiday services. These days of sincere prayer should not be turned into concerts of ritual music. Instead, attempts should be made to find a <i>chazan</i> who can truly serve as a spiritual leader. If he also has a pleasant voice, it is obviously more desirable.

See also <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>ibid.</i> 53:8).
However, a beard is also considered a sign of commitment to Jewish practice. The Rambam (<i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 12:7) associates shaving with the practices of gentile priests. Many Rabbis have strongly encouraged growing a beard even when there is no question of violating the prohibition against shaving. (See <i>Sefer Mitzvot Gadol</i> 7, <i>Shibolei Leket</i> Vol. II, 41.)
However, in communities where removing one's facial hair in a permitted manner is an accepted practice, the lack of a beard is not considered as a deterrent against a person serving as a <i>chazan</i>.

The Radbaz and the <i>Pri Chadash</i> write that if these pronunciation errors are commonplace, even someone who pronounces a <i>chet</i> as a <i>hay</i> or a <i>shin</i> as a <i>sin</i> may serve as a <i>chazan</i>. See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 53:16, <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 53:37-38.
The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> also cites Chapter 15, Halachah 1, from which it appears that a person who stutters, lisps, or has another speech defect which prevents him from pronouncing the letters properly should not serve as a <i>chazan</i>.
A teacher may appoint one of his students to lead the prayers in his presence. - even if the student lacks the above qualities (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). Though the previous halachah stated that the leader of the congregation should be the man of the greatest stature in the community, the mishnah (<i>Megillah</i>, <i>ibid.</i>) and similarly, several sources throughout the Talmud (See <i>Berachot</i> 33b) indicate that a teacher could appoint a student to serve as a <i>chazan</i> instead of doing so himself.
The <i>Or Sameach</i> explains that this refers to a student who does not articulate the letters properly. Though such a person should not ordinarily serve as a <i>chazan</i>, if he is appointed by his teacher he may. Thus, we find that Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi appointed Rabbi Chiya as a <i>chazan</i> (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 85b) even though he would pronounce a <i>chet</i> as a <i>hay</i> (<i>Megillah</i> 24b).

This does not necessarily refer to wearing a <i>tallit gadol</i>, but rather to a cloak or jacket that covers his shoulders and arms (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 53:13).

The latter phrase is a reference to <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 30:4, which states:

A person may eat and drink [on Friday] until nightfall. Nevertheless, as part of the honor given to the Shabbat, a person should refrain from scheduling a meal from the time of Minchah onward.

Alternatively, certain texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> (and <i>Pesachim</i>, ibid.) read ""A person who swallows maror fulfills his obligation."" The proponents of this text maintain that it is impossible to swallow a piece of maror the size of an olive without feeling some bitterness. Nevertheless, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (475:3) quotes the former text.
</i>. A person who swallows matzah and maror together fulfills the obligation of matzah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as above. There is an added undesirable factor in eating matzah in this manner. Preferably, no other substances should be eaten with the matzah, so that only its taste will be sensed. (Indeed, were he to chew both the matzah and the maror, he would not fulfill his obligation (See <i>Pesachim</i> 115a).

The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam's intention is to explain why the person fulfills the mitzvah of matzah. One might argue that the maror, like the fibers mentioned in the following clause, would prevent one from fulfilling the mitzvah of matzah. Therefore, the Rambam explains that ""the maror is secondary...""
It must be noted that according to the second version of the text mentioned above, the passage reads with no difficulty whatsoever.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 6.3,"A person who eats matzah without the intention [to fulfill the mitzvah]<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This halachah touches on a question left unresolved by the Talmud (see <i>Pesachim</i> 114b), and which has become a source of debate and discussion among the Rabbis in subsequent generations. Does a person who performs the deed of a mitzvah, without the intention to carry out God's command, fulfill his obligation, or not?

Nevertheless, the commentaries qualify the Rambam's statements, based on <i>Hilchot Shofar</i> 2:4:

A person who occupies himself with blowing shofar to learn does not fulfill his obligation... one does not fulfill his obligation until both the person hearing [the shofar] and the one sounding it intend to fulfill the obligation.

In resolution, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that to fulfill his obligation, the person being forced to eat the matzah must know that today is Pesach, that he is obligated to eat matzah, and that it is matzah which he is eating. Rabbenu Nissim, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, and Rabbenu Manoach follow a different line of reasoning. They differentiate between eating matzah and hearing a shofar. In the former case, a person's body benefits from the activity regardless of his intention. To support this thesis, they draw a parallel to the following passage from <i>Keritot</i> 19b.
Generally, the Torah frees a person from liability if he commits a transgression while being only מתעסק (performing a deed without any thought). However, a person who eats forbidden foods or engages in forbidden sexual relations in this manner is liable, because he derived pleasure from his activities.
Similarly, in the present context, since the person derived physical satisfaction from eating the matzah, even though he was forced to do so, the action is attributed to him. In contrast, since his body did not benefit from hearing the shofar, he does not fulfill his obligation until he hears the shofar blown in the proper manner.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 475:4) quotes the <i>Maggid Mishneh's</i> opinion as regards <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i>, and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> adds the explanation mentioned in the name of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>. (It must be noted that the <i>Pri Chadash</i> and other commentaries do not accept this decision). In <i>Orach Chayim</i> 589:8, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> quotes the Rambam's decision concerning blowing the shofar, stating that a מתעסק does not fulfill the mitzvah. Similar decisions are rendered concerning <i>kriat shema</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 60) and lulav and etrog (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 651).

</i>: if it has the taste of grain<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Based on the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Challah</i> 3:5), the Ramban and Rabbenu Asher maintain that as long as the matzah tastes of grain, one may fulfill one's requirement even though the amount of wheat flour is not sufficient to produce a כזית (size of an olive) of wheat flour in כדי אכילת פרס (a quantity equivalent in volume to three eggs according to the Rambam, two eggs according to other authorities; see the commentary on Halachah 1:6).
They explain that when mixed with wheat, rice takes on the taste of the wheat to the point that its own flavor is not noticeable at all. Hence, there is no limit to the quantity of wheat required. In contrast, other <i>kitniyot</i> do not ""accept"" the flavor of wheat so easily (nor does rice ""accept"" the flavor of the other four species of grain). Hence, if they are mixed with wheat, there has to be a sufficient quantity of wheat (a כזית within פרס כדי אכילת) for one to fulfill his obligation.
The Ra'avad and the Rashbah do not accept the principle explained by the Ramban, and require a כזית in פרס כדי אכילת even when a dough is made of rice and wheat. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 453:2) quotes the Rambam's words exactly. The commentaries infer that this implies acceptance of the Ramban's view. The later authorities quote the Ra'avad's opinion and suggest adhering to it, though theoretically, they find the Ramban's view more acceptable.

If the shepherds do not eat from it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> and use it merely to feed the animals, it is not forbidden. Were it to be chametz, it would not be permitted to be used for that purpose since no benefit may be derived from chametz during Pesach. Nevertheless,

</i> by eating it, for it is not watched for the sake of eating matzah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as explained in Halachah 5:9, the matzah used to fulfill the mitzvah must be ""watched"" so that it does not become chametz. Furthermore, every stage of its preparation should be carried out with the intent that it be used to fulfill the mitzvah. Since this dough was made to be used only as food for dogs, surely this intent was lacking.

As mentioned above, it is Ashkenazic custom not to use such matzah on Pesach unless the person is incapable of eating ordinary matzah.
</i>. However, [the dough] should not be kneaded with wine, oil, honey, or milk, because of the requirement for poor man's bread, as explained above<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in Halachah 5:20. There is a slight difficulty with this statement. The halachah cited states that only water should be used for the matzah. The Radbaz (Vol. III, Responsum 1074) states that only the four liquids mentioned here may not be used, for only they change the taste of the matzah appreciably. However, the Ra'avad and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 462:1) forbid the use of matzah made with any liquid other than water for use at the seder.
</i>. A person who kneaded [dough with one of these liquids] does not fulfill his obligation<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Pesachim</i> 36a relates that Rabbi Yehoshua told his sons to make him matzah kneaded with milk throughout Pesach, except on the first night.

Hence, such a loaf is also considered as bread with regard to matzah.

They draw support from the Rambam's statements in Halachah 10 and maintain that he also accepts this restriction.
The <i>Magen Avraham</i> and the other Ashkenazic authorities favor the latter opinion. However, they do maintain that a sick person who could not eat a sufficient quantity of matzah soaked in water may soak his matzah in wine.

Matzah that was stolen: one may not recite a blessing upon it. Rav Oshiah states: This is derived from Psalms 10:3: ""The greedy's blessing revolts God.""
However, one might think this is true only in the beginning; ultimately (i.e., after eating the matzah), he is obligated to pay him money (and thus the matzah itself is no longer the property of the original owner.)
Rabbi Yochanan states: ""A mitzvah is not a sin."" Rabbi Yossi states: ""A sin is not a mitzvah."" Rabbi Illa said: ""Only when the mitzvot are performed as prescribed are they mitzvot.""

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 454:4) quotes the Rambam's statements exactly. Nevertheless, Rabbi Akiva Eiger maintains that since the stolen object no longer belongs to the original owners once it has been eaten, one may fulfill the mitzvah of matzah in this manner. All authorities agree that a person who stole grain or flour can fulfill his obligation with matzah made from it.
Rabbenu Manoach maintains that this instance is not dependent on the general rulings governing mitzvot performed with forbidden objects. Rather, <i>Pesachim</i> 38a draws an analogy between the mitzvot of matzah and Challah. Since there is an explicit teaching requiring a person to own the dough he uses for Challah, it thus follows that the matzah he uses must also be his undisputed property.

Indeed, some commentaries advise striking this phrase from the text, maintaining that it was a later addition which was not made by the Rambam himself.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> continues that the women should not recite a blessing before hearing the shofar. Those statements are based on the Rambam, <i>Hilchot Tzitzit</i> 3:9 and Chapter 6, Halachah 13 below. The rationale is that the blessing recited before a commandment praises God ""for commanding us to..."" There is no commandment, either from the Torah or the Sages, requiring women to hear the blowing of the shofar. Hence, they should not recite this blessing.
The Ashkenazic concept differs. The Ramah (based on <i>Tosafot, Rosh Hashanah</i>, ibid.) maintains that women may recite a blessing. Since our Sages explained that the women are granted reward for fulfilling these mitzvot, it is obvious that the commandment is relevant to them and they may say ""who commanded us.""

c) a slave belonged to two masters; one freed him and one did not.

Such a slave is considered as having two different natures included in the same person. Thus, the aspect of him which is a free man is obligated to hear the shofar, and the aspect which is a slave is not. See also Halachah 3.

The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's statement, noting that there is a difference of opinion among the Sages (<i>Yevamot</i> 83a) whether an <i>androgynous</i> is considered as half male and half female, or as a unique entity in his own right. The latter opinion is compatible with the Rambam's decision. However, according to the former opinion, it appears that an <i>androgynous</i> would resemble a person who is half slave and half free. As the following halachah states, such a person cannot blow the shofar even for himself, let alone for others.
The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> defends the Rambam's decision, explaining that the Rambam does not consider the difference of opinion in <i>Yevamot</i> as unresolved. Rather, he, as does Rav Yitzchak Alfasi (the Rif), maintains that the halachah follows the latter opinion.
Furthermore, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that even according to the former opinion, it is possible to differentiate between an <i>androgynous</i> and one who is half slave and half free, the former condition being brought about by God; the latter, by man.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> i.e., another <i>androgynous</i>

The aspect of his being which is a free man is obligated to hear shofar blown by one who is obligated to perform the mitzvah. Hence, the <i>teki'ot</i> he blows himself include the influence of his slave side, and are not sufficient to facilitate his performance of the mitzvah (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 29a).

The <i>Tzaphnat Paneach</i> explains that there is a difference between hearing the shofar and blowing it. Hearing the shofar is a complete act in and of itself. Hence, since the free side of the person has heard the shofar, he is considered to have performed the mitzvah. In contrast, the blowing of the shofar is merely the preparation for the fulfillment of the mitzvah. Hence, the free side of the person cannot fulfill his obligation by hearing <i>tekiot</i> which were produced by a person whose entire being was not obligated to perform the mitzvah.
Based on this explanation, we can understand how such a person fulfills the mitzvah of lulav, for there as well, the act of taking the lulav constitutes rather than prepares for, the fulfilment of the mitzvah.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.4","A person who occupies himself with blowing the shofar in order to learn<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> without the intention of fulfilling the mitzvah of hearing the shofar
</i> does not fulfill his obligation<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for he has heard an unacceptable shofar blast (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 589:5).
These laws relate to a question of a much larger scope: Must a person who performs a mitzvah have the intention of doing so or not? <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 32b, which is the source for these decisions, maintains that such intention is necessary. However, other Talmudic sources imply that there is no need for such intention. Whenever a person performs the deed of a mitzvah, he fulfills his obligation, regardless of his intention.
On the surface, the Rambam's own decisions regarding this question appear paradoxical. <i>Hilchot Chametz U'matzah</i> 6:3 states:

A person who eats matzah without the intention [of fulfilling the mitzvah] - e.g., if gentiles or thieves force him to eat - fulfills his obligation.

There, it appears that the Rambam does not require a person to have the intention to fulfill a mitzvah, for in this instance the only reason the person ate the matzah was the coercion of the gentiles.
The commentaries attempt to resolve the issue. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that to fulfill his obligation, the person being forced to eat the matzah must know that today is Pesach, that he is obligated to eat matzah, and that it is matzah which he is eating. Rabbenu Nissim, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, and Rabbenu Manoach follow a different line of reasoning. They differentiate between eating matzah and hearing a shofar. In the former case, a person's body benefits from the activity regardless of his intention. To support this thesis, they draw a parallel to the following passage.
Generally, the Torah frees a person from liability if he commits a transgression while being only מתעסק (performing a deed without any thought). However, a person who eats forbidden foods or engages in forbidden sexual relations in this manner is liable, because he derived pleasure from his activities (<i>Keritot</i> 19b).
Similarly, since the person derived physical satisfaction from eating the matzah, even though he was forced to do so, the action is attributed to him. In contrast, since his body did not benefit from hearing the shofar, he does not fulfill his obligation until he hears the shofar blown in the proper manner.
As regards <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i>, in <i>Orach Chayim</i> 589:8, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> quotes the Rambam's decision concerning blowing the shofar, stating that a מתעסק does not fulfill the mitzvah. Similar decisions are rendered concerning <i>Kri'at Shema</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 60) and lulav and etrog (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 651).
Concerning matzah, the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 475:4 quotes the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>'s opinion, and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> adds the explanation mentioned in the name of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>. (Even so, the <i>Pri Chadash</i> and other commentaries do not accept this decision.)

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.6","If the festival of Rosh Hashanah falls on the Sabbath<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> According to the fixed calendar we use, Rosh Hashanah never falls on Sunday, Wednesday, or Friday (<i>Hilchot Kiddush Hachodesh</i> 7:1). Thus, the second day of Rosh Hashanah will never fall on the Sabbath. However, it is not at all infrequent for the first day of Rosh Hashanah to fall on the Sabbath.
</i>, the shofar is not sounded in every place<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> However, it is sounded in certain places, as explained in Halachot 8 and 9. There is an allusion to this in the Torah itself. Though Numbers 10:10 describes Rosh Hashanah as a day of ""the sounding of the shofar,"" Leviticus 23:24 refers to it as a day of ""the remembrance of the sounding [of the shofar"" - i.e., this refers to Rosh Hashanah which falls on the Sabbath, when the shofar is not actually sounded (Rashi, <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 32a).
</i>. [This law was enacted] even though blowing [the shofar] was forbidden only as <i>sh'vut</i>.<br>I<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> A question can be raised, based on the Rambam's statements in Chapter 1, Halachah 4:

Regarding a shofar to be used on Rosh Hashanah: It is forbidden to violate the festival's laws to obtain it. This applies even when the forbidden practice is in the category of <i>sh'vut</i>.

The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> offers a number of resolutions to this difficulty. Among them:
a) Had the proper attention been paid to the matter before Rosh Hashanah, the <i>sh'vut</i> mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 4 with regard to obtaining the shofar would not exist. In contrast, the <i>sh'vut</i> involved in blowing the shofar cannot be avoided.
b) The <i>sh'vut</i> mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 4 must be violated before the mitzvah is performed. Hence, there is no way the prohibition can be relaxed in the mere expectation that a mitzvah will be performed. In contrast, in this instance, the performance of the mitzvah and the <i>sh'vut</i> occur concurrently.
However, the order of the halachot here suggests a different explanation. As the Rambam states in the following halachah, certain leniencies are taken regarding the <i>sh'vut</i> of sounding the shofar on Rosh Hashanah (since, as mentioned above, it is forbidden only because it is a ""weekday act""). In contrast, the activities mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 4 are of a more severe nature, and hence no leniency may be taken in their regard.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See the commentary on Chapter 1, Halachah 4 for a definition of the term <i>sh'vut</i>. <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 29b equates the blowing of the shofar with removing bread from the oven. It appears from <i>Shabbat</i> 117b that the removal of bread from the oven was forbidden only because it is ""a weekday act,"" not in the spirit of the Sabbath. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 588:4.)
</i>t would be appropriate for [the shofar] to be sounded, for a positive commandment of the Torah should supersede <i>sh'vut</i> instituted by the Sages. If so, why is the shofar not sounded?<br>Because of a decree [of the Sages] lest a person take it in his hands and carry it to a colleague so that the latter can blow for him, a<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 12:8 equates the two and explains the nature of this <i>melachah</i>. It must be noted that the phrase ""transfer it from one domain..."" is the Rambam's addition and does not appear in <i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, ibid. (Indeed, <i>Tosafot, Megillah</i> 4b explains that there is no suspicion that the latter prohibition will be violated.)
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam alters the expression used by <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 29b, which states: ""perhaps he will take it to a skilled person so that the latter will teach him."" Perhaps, the emendation was made because it is more likely that a person would desire that his colleague blow for him than begin to teach him on Rosh Hashanah itself.
</i>nd [in the process,] carry it four cubits in the public domain or transfer it from one domain to another, and thus violate a prohibition punishable by being stoned to death<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> as is the commission of all Shabbat <i>melachot</i> (<i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 1:1-2.)
</i>. [This is necessary because] all are obligated in the mitzvah of blowing the shofar, but not all are skilled in it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> A similar expression is also found in <i>Hilchot Megillah</i> 1:13, explaining why the Megillah is never read on the Sabbath. It must be noted that while the Temple was standing, a similar decree was not enacted on the first day of Sukkot which fell on the Sabbath, even though it is possible that a person would carry his lulav in a forbidden manner. Note our commentary on Chapter 7, Halachot 13 and 14, which explains the difference between the two festivals.
The fact that a Rabbinic decree can cause a mitzvah to be nullified - particularly as significant a mitzvah as the blowing of the shofar - has been the subject of much discussion by the Rabbis. In his commentary on the tractate of <i>Sukkah</i>, Rabbenu Nissim states that this decree was instituted only because in most Jewish communities, the people were not aware of the date the Rabbis had established for Rosh Hashanah. Hence, since the people could not be sure that they were in fact performing a mitzvah, the Rabbinic decree had the power to negate its performance. Even in the places where they were conscious of the proper date, they would not blow the shofar in such a year, so that great divisions in Torah practice would not be created among the Jewish people.
In <i>Likkutei Torah</i>, Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi explains the matter from a mystical perspective. He writes that the Sabbath itself generates spiritual influences which resemble those produced by the blowing of the shofar. Thus, there is no necessity to blow the shofar, and the Sages were therefore willing to allow such a decree to negate its observance.

The law stated here represents a reversal of the Rambam's understanding of <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 33a from that in his commentary on the Mishnah. Indeed, his change in interpretation caused the Ra'avad to object to this halachah. It is interesting to note that the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 4:9) and the primary interpretation mentioned in the <i>Halachot</i> of Rav Yitzchak Alfasi (the Rif) - sources which the Rambam relies upon heavily - follow the Rambam's initial approach.

However, it is forbidden for an adult to sound the shofar on Rosh Hashanah unnecessarily. Nevertheless, even a child who has reached the age when he is educated concerning the mitzvot need not follow this stringency (Ramah, ibid.).

However, that decree was not applied to places where the Sanhedrin, Israel's supreme court, held its sessions. The influence of the court would be felt throughout the entire city and its surroundings. Hence, the people would be more scrupulous in their observance of the mitzvot.

b) after the Temple's destruction, the Rambam maintains that the shofar was not sounded in Jerusalem, while the Ra'avad argues that it was.
The difference between the two depends on the Rambam's interpretation of the Mishnah (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 4:1):

When the festival of Rosh Hashanah fell on the Sabbath, they would sound the shofar in the <i>Mikdash</i>, but not in the country at large.

In his commentary on that Mishnah, the Rambam writes: ""We have already explained to you several times (see <i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 2:4, <i>Shekalim</i> 1:3, <i>Sukkah</i> 3:10) that the term <i>mikdash</i> refers to the entire city of Jerusalem<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There were a number of smaller villages surrounding Jerusalem which met all the requirements specified below.

The Talmud elaborates:

[After the destruction of the Temple,] Rosh Hashanah once fell on the Sabbath, and all the cities gathered together [in Yavneh]. Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai asked the family of Beteira: ""Shall we blow?""
""Let us consider the matter,"" they replied to him.
""Let us blow, and then consider the matter after having blown,"" he answered them.
""Let us consider the matter,"" they replied again.
He told them, ""The sounding of a horn has already been heard in Yavneh. Once a deed has been performed, no further discussion is entertained.""

</i>. Furthermore, the shofar is sounded on the Sabbath only in a court that has sanctified the new moon<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Originally, the months were sanctified by the courts after hearing the testimony of witnesses who saw the new moon.

</i>. However, the shofar will not be sounded in other courts, even though their judges have received<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>semichah</i>. - The Rambam's statements represent a middle road in a difference of opinion between the Rabbinical giants upon whom our understanding of the Talmud is based. Rashi (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 29a) states that the shofar was sounded on the Sabbath only in the presence of the Supreme Sanhedrin. Thus, this law applied only in Yavneh and in the few other cities where the Sanhedrin subsequently held its session.
Rav Yitzchak Alfasi (the Rif) quotes this law in his <i>Halachot</i> even though he quotes only those laws which are applicable in his age. From this it appears that he maintains that the shofar may be sounded in the presence of any court of stature on the Sabbath, even if its judges do not possess <i>semichah</i>. Indeed, the Ramban and Rabbenu Nissim write that Rav Yitzchak Alfasi would have the shofar sounded in his own court when Rosh Hashanah fell on the Sabbath. Similarly, the text <i>Haezer</i> records that the author saw a Sage from Damascus who stated that he saw the shofar blown on Rosh Hashanah which fell on a Sabbath.
(The Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, ibid., does not mention the need for the judges to possess <i>semichah</i>. Thus, it is possible that he also originally subscribed to this view.)
In the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Rambam's position lies in between these views. On one hand, unlike Rav Yitzchak Alfasi, he requires that the judges possess <i>semichah</i> and be of sufficient stature to have sanctified the new moon (thus, excluding any contemporary courts). Nevertheless, unlike Rashi, he allows the shofar to be sounded in the presence of any court that has those qualifications, and not the Supreme Sanhedrin alone.
</i> <i>semichah</i>. Also, the shofar is sounded only in the presence of a high court<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Our translation of בית דין גדול is based on the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, who explains that in this context the term refers to an established court of judges with <i>semichah</i>, and not the Supreme Sanhedrin, as is sometimes the case. Indeed, authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> from Yemen omit the word גדול from the above expression.
</i>.<br>It may be sounded during the entire time they are in session<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> but only while they are in session. If they have risen, the shofar can no longer be sounded. However...

</i> have begun preparing to rise - as long as they have not risen - the shofar may be sounded before them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Though the Sages (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 30a) raised a question on this matter and left it unanswered, the Rambam allows the shofar to be sounded under such circumstances. Since the question concerns a Rabbinic decree, the more lenient approach is taken (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).
</i>. However, outside the court, the shofar may not be sounded<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In this aspect, there was a difference between the sounding of the shofar on the Sabbath between Jerusalem and Yavneh. In Jerusalem, the influence of the Temple and the court was felt so strongly that even outside the presence of the court, the shofar could be sounded. In contrast, in Yavneh and other cities where courts were located, the shofar was sounded only in the presence of a court (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, ibid.).
</i>.<br>Why is the shofar allowed to be sounded in the court? Because the court is scrupulous [in the observance of the mitzvot] and, in its presence, those who blow the shofar will not carry the shofar in the public domain, for the court will warn the people and inform them<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>S'dei Chemed</i> derives a general principle from this law. <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 21:27 states that all Sabbath and festival prohibitions that were categorized as <i>sh'vut</i> were suspended in the Temple, because the priests were scrupulous in their observance of the mitzvot and there was no danger that any infringement of Torah law would occur. Similarly, the above text continues, all decrees of this nature may be suspended in the presence of a high court, because the court will ensure that the Torah's laws will be kept.
This logic runs contrary to a statement of Rabbenu Nissim, who writes that although Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai instituted the blowing of the shofar on the Sabbath in the presence of a court, he was not that lenient regarding the taking of the lulav and etrog. Thus, we see that the leniency mentioned here applies to the shofar alone and not to other cases.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 2.10","In the present age, when we celebrate Rosh Hashanah in the exile for two days<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There is a slight imprecision with the Rambam's statements. Rosh Hashanah was celebrated for two days throughout almost the totality of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> even while the Temple was standing. It was impossible to notify the people in most of the land (for the messengers were not allowed to travel more than two thousand cubits beyond Jerusalem) whether or not the court had substantiated the testimony of the witnesses on the day when Rosh Hashanah was expected to fall. (See <i>Beitzah</i> 4b-5a; <i>Hilchot Kiddush Hachodesh</i> 5:7-8.)
</i>, the shofar is sounded on the second day just as it is sounded on the first<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This refers to the actual sounding of the shofar. According to Sephardic custom, there is a difference concerning the recitation of the blessing <i>shehecheyanu</i> (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 499:3).
</i>.<br>If the first day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned above, according to the fixed calendar which we employ at present, it is impossible for the second day of Rosh Hashanah to fall on the Sabbath.
</i> falls on the Sabbath, those who were not in the presence of a court fit to blow the shofar on the Sabbath<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that there is some difficulty correlating this statement with that of the previous halachah, which implies that, at present, no courts are of sufficient stature to blow the shofar on the Sabbath. Among the possible resolutions to this difficulty are:
a) as the Rambam writes in <i>Hilchot Kiddush Hachodesh</i> 5:3, until the age of Abbaye and Ravvah, there were courts of judges who sanctified the new month based on the testimony of witnesses. Thus, the Rambam could be referring to such a court.
b) In <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 4:11, the Rambam discusses the possibility of the renewal of the practice of <i>semichah</i>. He could be referring to such an eventuality in the present instance.
</i> may blow the shofar on the second day alone<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is our practice at present.

Fasts 5.1,"There are days when the entire Jewish people<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> All healthy adult men and women
</i> fast<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> It appears that the Rambam considers these fasts to be obligatory in the present era. Based on his interpretation of <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 18b in his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 1:3, the Rambam explains that in the era of the Second Temple, these fasts were of an optional nature. After the destruction of the Temple, however, every Jew is required to observe them. This obligation is also explicitly stated by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 549:1, 550:1).
</i> because of the calamities that occurred to them then<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This is the intent of the fasts, and not merely refraining from eating. For this reason, the <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 121:1 harshly reproves those who fast, but spend their days taking pleasure strolls and being involved in other forms of leisure activity.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Here, the Rambam employs the same principle he developed at the beginning of this text regarding fasts instituted because of difficulties of an immediate nature, with regard to these fasts which were instituted for these national calamities.
Fasting in and of itself is not a purpose. Fasting can, however, serve
</i>, to arouse [their] hearts and initiate [them in] the paths of repentance. This will serve as a reminder of our wicked conduct and that of our ancestors, which resembles our present conduct and therefore brought these calamities upon them and upon us<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Although these tragedies took place in previous generations, we share the responsibility for them. The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Yoma</i> 1:1) states, ""Every generation in which the Temple is not rebuilt should consider it as if it was destroyed in its days.""
</i>. By reminding ourselves of these matters, we will repent<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The word נשוב, translated as ""we will repent,"" literally means, ""We will return."" <i>Teshuvah</i> involves a return to one's fundamental self, becoming aware of the fundamental Divine nature one possesses.
Such a process relates to these commemorative fasts, which on the surface are associated with undesirable elements, but possess a positive core, as reflected in the Rambam's statements at the conclusion of this chapter that in the era of the Redemption, all these fast days will be transformed into days of rejoicing and celebration.
</i> and improve [our conduct], as [Leviticus 26:40] states: ""And they will confess their sin and the sin of their ancestors<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 1:1-2, 2:2, where the Rambam associates the mitzvah of teshuvah with confession.
</i>."""
Fasts 5.2,"These days are the following:<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rambam lists these fasts, not in the order in which the events which they commemorate transpired, nor according to the order in which they are mentioned in Zechariah 8:19 (see Halachah 4), but rather in the order of the year, beginning from the month of Tishrei.
</i><br>The Third of Tishrei. This is the day on which Gedaliah ben Achikam<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The governor appointed by Nebuchadnezzar to supervise the land of Judah. The Jews who were not exiled rallied around him, and it appeared that there would be hope of maintaining a Jewish settlement in the land (Jeremiah, Chapters 40-41).
</i> was slain<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> According to the Radak (Jeremiah 41:1 , Gedaliah was slain on Rosh HaShanah. Because a fast could not be held on that sacred day, the commemoration of his murder was postponed until the first available weekday.
</i> and the ember of Israel that remained was extinguished, causing their exile to become complete<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> After Gedaliah's murder, the Jews remaining in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> feared the wrath of the Babylonians and fled to Egypt, leaving <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> devoid of Jewish leadership and possessing very few Jewish inhabitants. (See Jeremiah, Chapters 41-43.)
</i>.<br>The Tenth of Tevet. This is the day Nebuchadnezzar, the wicked, the King of Babylon, camped<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Hebrew term םמך, which the Rambam [and the prophet Ezekiel  24:2 ] employ, usually has a positive connotation, meaning ""support."" Perhaps this is also an allusion to the concept that ultimately these commemorative fasts have a positive intent, as mentioned at the conclusion of the chapter.
</i> against Jerusalem and placed the city under siege<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Our commemoration of this fast also marks two other undesirable events which occurred in the preceding days: the death of Ezra, the scribe, and the translation of the Torah into Greek at the demand of King Ptolemy (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 580).
</i>.<br>The Seventeenth of Tammuz. Five tragedies took place on this day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Ta'anit</i> 29a states: Undesirable events are gathered together on a day appropriate for them. The spiritual nature of the day is such, that the potential for such tragedies to occur is greater.
</i>:<br>a) The Tablets were broken;<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> When Moses descended with the Tablets of the Ten Commandments after being on Mount Sinai for forty days, he beheld the Golden Calf that the Jews had made. In wrath, or out of his concern for the Jewish people (see Rashi, Exodus 32:19 , Moses broke the Tablets.
</i><br>b) In the First Temple, the offering of the daily sacrifices<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>korban tamid</i> (Numbers 28:1-8)
</i> was nullified;<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Even during the siege of Jerusalem, the Jews would offer the daily sacrifices. Despite the famine in the city, they would offer two lambs each day as sacrifices. As the siege persisted, their supply of lambs dwindled, and on the Seventeenth of Tammuz, there no longer were any lambs to sacrifice (Rav Ovadiah of Bertinoro, <i>Ta'anit</i> 4:6).
Significantly, other commentaries (Rashi, <i>Tiferet Yisrael</i>) on the Mishnah identify the nullification of the sacrifices on the Seventeenth of Tammuz with different events in our history.
</i><br>c) [The walls of] Jerusalem were breached in [the war leading to] the destruction of the Second Temple;<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Jeremiah 39:2 states that in the destruction of the First Temple, Jerusalem's walls fell to the Babylonian conquerors on the ninth of Tammuz. Nevertheless, it is the destruction of the city by the Romans that we commemorate by fasting, because the effects of that destruction are more severe (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 549:2). The Rabbis did not institute a fast for the Ninth of Tammuz as well, for it was felt that this would be an excessive burden for the people (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 549:4).
Furthermore, according to the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Ta'anit</i> 4:8, because of the many difficulties suffered by the Jewish people, they miscalculated the date, and, even during the destruction of the First Temple, it was on the Seventeenth of Tammuz that Jerusalem's walls were breached.
</i><br>d) Apostmos, the wicked<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> a Greek official in the Second Temple era (Rav Ovadiah of Bertinoro)
</i>, burned a Torah scroll<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Meiri identifies this as the Torah scroll written by Ezra the Scribe. This scroll was kept in the Temple Courtyard and was used to check the precision of the other scrolls. In this manner, he attempted to undermine the entire Torah tradition.
</i>; and<br>e) He e<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Others interpret this as a reference to the idol erected by King Menasheh in the First Temple. (See the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Ta'anit</i> 4:6.)

</i>rected an idol in the Temple."
Fasts 5.3,"On the Ninth of Av, five tragedies occurred<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Here, also, we see the reflection of the concept mentioned above, that undesirable events are gathered together on a day appropriate for them.
</i>:<br>It was decreed that the Jews in the desert would not enter <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>;<br>T<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Ta'anit</i> 29a reconciles a seeming contradiction in chronology between II Kings 25:8-9 and Jeremiah 52:12-13, explaining that the Babylonians first entered the Temple on the seventh of Av. They reveled and wrought havoc there until the afternoon of the ninth of Av, when they set fire to the building. The fire continued burning throughout the tenth of Av.
The Sages (<i>ibid.</i>) do not cite a specific source for the tradition that the Second Temple was also destroyed on that day. Nevertheless, the tradition is universally accepted.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The spies sent by Moses returned to him on the eighth of Av, bearing a malicious report about <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. That night the Jewish people wept, fearful about their future. God told them, ""Tonight, you have wept without reason. I will designate this night as a night of weeping for generations"" (<i>Ta'anit</i> 29a).
</i>he First and the Second Temples were destroyed;<br>A large city named Betar was captured. Thousands and myriads of Jews inhabited it<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This was Bar Kochba's capital in his war against the Romans, 52 years after the destruction of the Temple.
</i>. They were ruled by a great king whom the entire Jewish people and the leading Sages considered to be the Messianic king<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> See the Rambam's comments concerning Bar Kochva, <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 11:3.
</i>. The city fell to the Romans and they were all slain, causing a national catastrophe equivalent to that of the Temple's destruction<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The extent of the carnage that accompanied Betar's fall was awesome. <i>Gittin</i> 57a states that rivers of blood flowed into the Mediterranean Sea, forty miles away.
</i>.<br>On that day designated for retribution, the wicked Tineius Rufus<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> a Roman officer
</i> plowed the site of the Temple and its surroundings<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> According to <i>Ta'anit</i> 29a, this took place while Rabban Gamliel was living, shortly after the destruction of the Temple.
</i>, thereby fulfilling the prophecy [Micah 3:12], ""Zion will be plowed like a field<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The citation of this prophecy communicates a fundamental point: that the destruction of Jerusalem was not an end in its own right. Just as a field is plowed to produce crops, Jerusalem was plowed to allow the city to blossom into its ultimate fulfillment in the era of the Redemption.
</i>."""
Fasts 5.5,"And the entire Jewish people follow the custom of fasting at these times and on the Thirteenth of Adar<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> interprets this phrase to mean that our obligation to fast on these days is a custom accepted by the Jewish people after the destruction of the Second Temple. As mentioned above, others interpret this obligation as stemming from the exegesis of the verse from Zechariah mentioned in the previous halachah, as found in <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 18b.
Our translation follows the standard published texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. Many authoritative manuscripts make a small change in the wording, which would cause the lines to be rendered as: ""And in these times, the entire Jewish people follow the custom of fasting on the Thirteenth of Adar.""
</i>, in commemoration of the fasts that [the people] took upon themselves in the time of Haman<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The Rabbis question precisely which fasts are being commemorated. Some maintain that since the Thirteenth of Adar was a day of battle on which the Jews waged war against their enemies, they fasted at that time to arouse Divine mercy (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>). Others maintain that it is improper to fast in a time of war, lest this sap one's strength, and instead the Jews merely vowed to fast, but conducted the actual fasts at a later time.
A third opinion maintains that this refers to the three-day fast that Esther called before approaching Achashverosh. Although this fast was held in the month of Nisan, it is commemorated in connection with the Purim holiday.
</i>, as mentioned [in Esther 9:31]: ""the matter of the fasts and the outcries<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> It is not postponed until after the Sabbath, because Purim is Sunday and the celebration of Purim cannot be postponed. Nor is it appropriate to hold this fast after Purim.
</i><sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 141:2 writes that the commemoration of this fast makes us conscious of how God ""hears each person's prayer in his time of distress when he fasts and repents... as He did on behalf of our ancestors in those days.""
The fast of the Thirteenth of Adar is also referred to as <i>Ta'anit Esther</i>, ""the fast of Esther.""
When the fast of Esther became a formal part of Jewish observance is a matter of question. It is not mentioned in the Talmud. Furthermore, <i>Megillat Ta'anit</i>, a text which mentions all the fasts and festivals observed in the Talmudic era, does not mention this fast and speaks of the thirteenth of Adar, the day on which the fast of Esther is observed, as a day of celebration, the Day of Nicanor, marking the defeat of the Greek general of that name in the Hasmonean wars. It was not until after the destruction of the Temple that the observance of the dates mentioned in <i>Megillat Ta'anit</i> was nullified. This would appear to indicate that the observance of the Fast of Esther was of later origin.
In contrast, there is evidence pointing to the establishment of the Fast of Esther early in the Talmudic period. The <i>Sheiltot</i> of Rav Achai Gaon, <i>Parshat Vayakhel</i> 67, speak of the observance of the Fast of Esther in the time of the Mishnah. Even if this teaching is not accepted as historical fact, we can glean from it that in Rav Achai's time, shortly after the conclusion of the Talmud, the fast was already a long-standing custom.
Significantly, because of the difference in status between it and the other commemorative fasts, the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 686:2) rules far more leniently in regard to this fast than in regard to the others.
</i>.""<br>If the Thirteenth of Adar falls on the Sabbath, the fast is pushed forward and held on Thursday, which is the eleventh of Adar<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As the Rambam mentions, if the date of a commemorative fast falls on Friday, the fast is held on that day. Nevertheless, it is improper for a fast that is not scheduled for such a day to be held then, since this is not proper reverence for the Sabbath (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).
</i>. If, however, any of the [dates of] other fasts fall on the Sabbath, the fasts are postponed until after the Sabbath<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Megillah</i> 5a states that the rationale is ""we do not bring close [the recollection of] Divine retribution.""
</i>. If [the dates of] these fasts fall on Friday, we should fast on Friday<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> According to the fixed calendar we follow at present, this is a rare occurrence. Only the Tenth of Tevet (in the northern hemisphere a relatively short fast) can fall on Friday. Even this does not happen frequently.

As mentioned there, on Tish'ah B'Av a different passage (beginning Deuteronomy 4:25  is read in the morning. Significantly, the Rambam does not mention the custom of reciting the <i>haftarah</i> in the afternoon service.
</i>.<br>On all these [fasts], with the exception of Tish'ah B'Av, we may eat and drink at night<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Similarly, on these days, work, wearing shoes, washing, anointing oneself, and sexual relations are permitted (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 550:2).

Fasts 5.6,"When the month of Av enters<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Significantly, the Rambam does not mention any restrictions from the period beginning the Seventeenth of Tammuz. During this period, it is the Askenazic custom (see Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 551:2,4; <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 122:1-3) to observe certain restrictions - e.g., prohibitions against marrying, against reciting the blessing <i>Shehecheyanu</i>, and against cutting one's hair. From the beginning of Av, however, other restrictions are also added.
</i>, we reduce our joy<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 551:1-2) state that the restrictions mentioned by the Rambam in Chapter 3, Halachah 8, are applicable during this period.
</i>. During the week of Tish'ah B'Av<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> from the Sabbath before the fast onward.
According to Ashkenazic custom, all the activities mentioned by the Rambam are forbidden from Rosh Chodesh Av onward.
</i>, it is forbidden to cut one's hair<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> or to shave, even in a manner permitted by halachic authorities (<i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 122:3)
</i>, to do laundry<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> it is customary to observe this prohibition even if one does not intend to wear the garment until after the fast<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> As mentioned in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 558:1) and commentaries, these and the following restrictions should be followed for a certain amount of time on the Tenth of Av, as well, to commemorate the fact that the Temple continued burning on that day as well.
According to the Ashkenazic custom, in which these practices are observed from Rosh Chodesh onward, there are certain leniencies, depending on one's community, with regard to wearing laundered and pressed clothes on the Sabbath before Tish'ah B'Av.
</i> (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 551:3).
</i>, or to wear a pressed garment<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> We have used a modern translation for the Hebrew term גהוץ. In Talmudic times, it referred to smoothing out the creases of a garment with a flat stone (<i>Aruch</i>).
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 551:3) also prohibits wearing clothes that are merely laundered, even if they have not been pressed. There are halachic authorities who will grant leniencies in this context with regard to underwear and the like.
</i> - even one of linen<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Linen garments will not appear as distinguished after washing as those of other fabrics (<i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 551).
</i> - until after the fast.<br>It has already been accepted as a Jewish custom not to eat meat<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> or fowl. <i>Bava Batra</i> 60b states that it would have been proper for the Jews to refrain from eating meat and drinking wine at all times in mourning over the loss of the opportunity to partake of the sacrificial meat and the loss of the wine libations. The Sages felt, however, that such a decree would be too stringent for the people to observe and hence, did not institute it.
</i> or enter a bathhouse during this week until after the fast<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The prohibition applies only to washing for pleasure. Needless to say, washing associated with a mitzvah - e.g., a woman in preparation for her ritual immersion or washing necessary for hygienic purposes - is permitted.
</i>. There are places that follow the custom of refraining from slaughtering from Rosh Chodesh Av until after the fast<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This custom has not been accepted throughout the Jewish community. Today, animals are slaughtered so that those who do not observe the restriction against eating meat will at least eat kosher meat, and so that meat will be available for others after the fast.

Fasts 5.7,"All [the restrictions of] Tish'ah B'Av<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> mentioned in Halachot 10 and 11
</i> apply at night as well as during the day. One may not eat after sunset [of the previous day];<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Similarly, if one resolved to accept the fast beforehand, one may no longer eat (Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Ta'anit</i> 4:6). The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 553:1) states that only when one makes a verbal statement to this effect is the resolution binding.
</i> [it is forbidden to eat] between sunset and the appearance of the stars<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> <i>Shabbat</i> 34b explains that the Sages were undecided whether this period of time, known as <i>beyn hash'mashot</i>, should be considered to be part of the night or the day. Hence, it is necessary to be stringent both at the entry and the departure of a day associated with halachic restrictions.
</i>, as on Yom Kippur<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>loc. cit.</i>, the Rambam writes that, as on Yom Kippur, we are obligated to include a certain portion of the previous day in all the restrictions observed on that day.
Significantly, some of the foremost commentators on the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> (the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and the Radbaz) either were not aware of this statement or maintained that the Rambam changed his mind on this issue, for they ruled that no such obligation applies in connection with Tish'ah B'Av. Their opinion is accepted as halachah at present (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 553:3).
</i>.<br>One should not eat meat or drink wine at the meal before the fast<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the <i>seudah hamafseket</i>. Even a person who does not observe the custom of refraining from these foods during the week of Tish'ah B'Av (or the Nine Days according to Ashkenazic custom), should refrain from partaking of them in this meal. This meal should be characterized by mourning and sadness, and these foods bring happiness.
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 554:25) associates Ezekiel 32:27: ""And their sins will be upon their bones"" with eating meat and drinking wine at this meal.
</i>. One may, however, drink grape juice that has not been left [to ferment] for three days<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> For it has no alcoholic content, and will not lead to happiness.
</i>. One may eat salted meat that was slaughtered more than three days previously<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The prohibition against eating meat was derived from the fact that with the Temple's destruction, the sacrifices were nullified. Since no sacrificial meat could be eaten on the third day and afterwards, this restriction does not apply to such meat (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 552:5).
It must be emphasized that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 552:2) and the later authorities explain that, at present, it is customary to refrain from partaking of even these foods at this meal.
</i>. One should not eat two cooked dishes<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> This restriction was instituted because when two or more dishes are served, a meal is considered important, and partaking of such a meal is inappropriate at this time (Rabbenu Asher).
The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 552:3-5) discusses in detail what is excluded by the phrase ""two cooked dishes.""
</i>."
Fasts 5.8,"When does the<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> need to observe the restrictions mentioned
</i> above apply? When one ate [this meal] in the afternoon on the day preceding Tish'ah B'Av<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> The governing principle for this and the previous and following halachot is that unlike the meal before the fast on Yom Kippur, the meal before the fast of Tish'ah B'Av is somber in nature. The atmosphere of mourning that prevails throughout the fast has already begun, and therefore, eating a normal meal should be out of the question.
</i>. If, however, one eats a meal before noon, although this is the last meal one eats before the fast, one may eat all that one desires<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> For then, one is still far removed from the fast itself.
</i>.<br>When the day before Tish'ah B'Av falls on the Sabbath<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the obligation to honor the Sabbath surpasses the need to commemorate the destruction of the Temple. Therefore,
</i>, one may eat and drink to the full extent of one's needs, and one may serve even a meal resembling Solomon's feasts at one's table<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> There are some authorities (<i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i>) who recommend observing certain practices associated with mourning at the third Sabbath meal. Their opinions are not, however, accepted as halachah.
There is, however, one aspect in which this third Sabbath meal differs from the way this meal is eaten throughout the year. Generally, we are allowed to continue this meal into the night. When the fast of Tish'ah B'Av begins on Sunday, however, we must cease eating at sunset. (See Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 552:10.)
</i>.<br>Similarly, when Tish'ah B'Av falls on the Sabbath<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> since the observance of the fast is postponed, there is no need to minimize one's Sabbath joy, and
</i>, one need not withhold anything at all<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Significantly, the Rambam does not mention any mourning rites in connection with such a day. In contrast, the decisions of the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 554:19) reflect the following principles. All expressions of mourning that would be noticed by the public should be forbidden. Those practices of mourning which are private in nature - e.g., the prohibition of sexual relations - should be observed.

Fasts 5.10,"Pregnant women and those who are nursing<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> although absolved from fasting on the other commemorative fasts

</i>.<br>[On this day,] it is forbidden to wash in either hot or cold water<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for the sake of pleasure. One may, however, wash one's hands to remove filth or for ritual purposes. (See the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> and commentaries, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 544:9-10.)

One may, however, pass through water to greet one's teacher or to watch one's crops (<i>ibid.</i>:12-13). Similarly, a woman is allowed to wash food that she will serve children, even though her hands also become wet (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 554:19).
The Rambam does not elaborate on these leniencies here, because he has already mentioned them at length with regard to Yom Kippur in <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i> 3:1-7.
</i>. Similarly, anointing oneself for the sake of pleasure<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> in contrast to anointment for hygienic or medicinal reasons

Fasts 5.11,"Torah scholars<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Indeed, this applies also the people as a whole. Torah scholars are mentioned because they are expected to be more sensitive to the tragedy of our loss on Tish'ah B'Av.
The Rambam's choice of wording is based on his interpretation of the <i>Tosefta, Ta'anit</i> 3:11, ""<i>Chaverim</i> should not exchange greetings on Tish'ah B'Av<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Nor should gifts or other social amenities be exchanged (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 554:41).
</i>,"" for the term <i>chaverim</i> is often used as a reference to Torah scholars. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 554:20), however, interprets <i>chaverim</i> in its literal sense, that it means ""friends.""
</i> should not exchange greetings on Tish'ah B'Av. Instead, they should sit in agony and frustration like mourners<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Nothing should be done to distract one's attention from the loss.
With the above expression, the Rambam also explains the rationale for these laws. When the Sages ordained the commemoration of Tish'ah B'Av, they structured its observance to resemble Yom Kippur in certain contexts, and to resemble the laws of mourning in others.
</i>. If a common person greets them, they should reply to him<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> lest he become upset, but this should be done
</i> weakly, in a somber tone<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> So that he also appreciates the nature of the day. See also Chapter 3, Halachah 8.
</i>.<br>On Tish'ah B'Av, it is forbidden to read from the Torah, the Prophets, or the Sacred Writings [or to study] the Mishnah, Torah law, the Talmud, or the Aggadic works<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Because ""the precepts of God... make the heart glad"" (Psalms 19:9 . Even this joy is inappropriate on Tish'ah B'Av (<i>Ta'anit</i> 30a).
</i>. One may study only<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> Torah works that are somber in nature - e.g.,
</i> Job<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> which recounts his grief and suffering over the tribulations which beset him
</i>, Eichah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> the Book of Lamentations for the Temple's destruction. This text is read communally on Tish'ah B'Av and may be studied by individuals as well.
</i>, and the prophecies of retribution in Jeremiah<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> In addition, one may study the Talmudic passages describing the Temple's destruction (from the chapter <i>Hanezikin</i>, <i>Gittin</i>, Chapter 5, in the Babylonian Talmud, and the last chapter of <i>Ta'anit</i> in the Jerusalem Talmud), the <i>Midrashim</i> on Eichah, the laws of Tish'ah B'Av, the laws of mourning, and other similar texts.
One should, however, recite all the passages from the Bible and the Talmud that are included in the daily prayer service.
</i>. Children should not study in school on this day<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> for they also derive happiness from their study (<i>Ta'anit, ibid.</i>).
</i>.<br>There are some sages who do not wear the head <i>tefillin</i>.<sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote""> A mourner does not wear <i>tefillin</i> on the first day of mourning (<i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 4:9). In particular, support for this custom is derived from Eichah 2:1, which states, ""He cast down the glory of Israel from the heaven to the earth."" ""The glory of Israel"" is a reference to <i>tefillin</i>.
The Rambam's choice of wording appears to indicate that the arm <i>tefillin</i> may be worn. Similarly, he does not mention any change in practice regarding the <i>tallit gadol.</i> The custom at present in most communities (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 555:1) is not to wear <i>tefillin</i> - neither the head <i>tefillin</i> nor the arm <i>tefillin</i> - nor to wear the <i>tallit gadol</i> in the morning service. A <i>tallit k'tan</i> is worn, but a blessing is not recited over it.
For the afternoon service, the <i>tallit gadol</i> and both the head and arm <i>tefillin</i> are worn.
