Blessings 4.7,"A person who decides not to continue eating or drinking, <sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cites <i>Pesachim</i> 103b, which states that once a person diverts his attention from drinking wine, he must recite another blessing when he begins drinking again.<br>The Ra'avad notes that the passage from <i>Pesachim</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions only drinking and does not discuss eating, and on that basis protests against the Rambam's equation of the two. From <i>Berachot</i> 42a, however, it appears that similar principles apply with regard to eating.</i> and afterwards changes his mind and [desires to] eat or drink, must recite another blessing <sup class=""footnote-marker"">2</sup><i class=""footnote"">before partaking of the food or drink. He is not, however, required to recite a blessing after the first food or drink. Rather, he is required to recite only a single blessing after he completes eating.</i> although he has not changed his place. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">3</sup><i class=""footnote"">As mentioned in Halachot 3-5, a person who changes his place while eating must recite both a blessing after the food he has eaten previously and a blessing over the food he plans to eat in his new place.<br>Many authorities do not accept the Rambam's decision with regard to a meal that includes bread. When a person sits down to such a meal, he is considered to have fixed his attention on eating. People frequently become drawn into eating more than they originally intended at such meals. Thus, a person's decision not to continue eating is not considered final, since it is quite possible that he will change his mind and decide to eat again. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 179:1).<br>Based on these principles, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 179:1) rules that, although once a person has decided to cease eating or drinking a new blessing is generally required, when partaking of a meal it is not sufficient to make a mental decision, and a person must wash before grace to be considered to have ceased eating.</i> If he did not decide [to cease] eating or drinking and had in mind to continue - even if he <sup class=""footnote-marker"">4</sup><i class=""footnote"">remained in the place in which he ate originally, and</i> made an interruption for the entire day <sup class=""footnote-marker"">6</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Rambam's terminology appears to be a stylistic exaggeration. If a person waits long enough for the food he has eaten to digest, it would appear that he is required to recite another blessing before beginning to eat again (<i>Kin’at Eliyahu</i>).</i> - he is not required to recite a second blessing. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">7</sup><i class=""footnote"">before partaking of more food or drink.</i>",5,did not decide [to cease] eating or drinking and had in mind to continue,eating at a later time

In contrast, the blood of the <i>Chaggigah</i> should be sprinkled on the two opposite corners of the altar.<br>Rabbi Yishmael maintains that בדיעבד (after the fact), were a person to pour the blood of the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering on the base of the altar, he would be considered to have fulfilled his obligation. Hence, the blessing for the Pesach offering can apply to the <i>Chaggigah</i> as well.<br>In contrast, Rabbi Akiva maintains that even ""after the fact,"" the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering is not acceptable if its blood is not sprinkled on the altar as prescribed. Accordingly, the blessing for the Pesach offering has no connection to the <i>Chaggigah</i> at all.<br>The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> questions the Rambam's decision. In <i>Hilchot P'sulei HaMukdashim</i> 2:2, the Rambam writes: ""Whenever [blood] is prescribed to be presented [on the altar] by sprinkling, and it was presented by pouring, one has fulfilled his obligation,"" accepting the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael. If so, his acceptance of Rabbi Akiva's opinion here appears to present a contradiction.<br>Rav Yechezkel Landau (<i>Tz'lach, Pesachim</i> ibid.) attempts to resolve the issue, explaining that the Rambam follows the interpretation of Rav Chayim HaCohen (<i>Tosefot, Pesachim</i> ibid.), who favored a different text of the Talmud and, accordingly, an alternate interpretation of the difference in opinion between the two Sages.<br>Rav Chayim maintains that Rabbi Yishmael considers the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering as secondary to the Paschal sacrifice. (See also Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Pesachim</i> 10:7.) Hence, reciting a blessing over the Paschal sacrifice, the essential element (עיקר) of the evening, also fulfills the requirement for the secondary element (טפל), the <i>Chaggigah</i>. Indeed, regarding the blessings recited over food, the Rambam writes (<i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 3:5) that whenever there are two foods, one essential and one secondary, it is only necessary to recite a blessing over the essential food.

Though in <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> (The Guide to the Perplexed) 2:40 the Rambam himself elaborates upon that idea, it can be said that here his intent is different. He is emphasizing the degree to which each individual's personality is a combination of different traits, which may be unrelated and even distant from each other. Anger, generosity, and modesty, for example, can be found together in the same person, much in the same way that tenants of all sorts - unrelated to each other - can be housed in a common building.<br>To illustrate these traits, the Rambam employs concrete examples of extreme personalities, so that the contrasts can be appreciated more easily.</i> others.<br>One type of man is wrathful; he is constantly angry.

Similarly, he should not desire <sup class=""footnote-marker"">10</sup><i class=""footnote"">This refers to physical desire.</i> anything other than that which the body needs and cannot exist without, as [Proverbs 13:25] states: <sup class=""footnote-marker"">11</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Rambam quotes supporting verses for only two of the ""intermediate traits;"" perhaps, because his description of the middle-of-the-road position for these traits might appear to veer toward one extreme. We might expect the intermediate point between gluttony and its opposite extreme to be eating to one's satisfaction. However, here we are told that we should desire only what is sufficient in order to exist.<br>However, the Rambam is not telling us to deny ourselves satisfaction. Deuteronomy 8:10 teaches: ""You shall eat and be satisfied, and bless God, your Lord."" Based on that verse, <i>Berachot</i> 48b explains that we are obligated to recite grace only when we feel physically satisfied. (The Rambam quotes this concept in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 1:1.) In Chapter 3, Halachah 1, and in <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, he elaborates on the negative aspects of asceticism.<br>Thus, his intent cannot be that we deny our desires, but rather that we school ourselves to desire and feel satisfied with what we need, without excess.

The commentaries note that the contrast between the two does not center on the quantity of food they eat, but on the attitude with which they eat it. Because the righteous are not given over to pursuit of gratification, they can be satisfied. Conversely, it is the gluttony of the wicked which actually causes their want.<br>Note also the Midrashic interpretations of this verse:<br>""The righteous..."" This refers to Eliezer, who said to Rebecca: ""Let me sip a little water"" (Genesis 24:17  - a single sip.""And the belly of the wicked will want."" This refers to Esau, who said to Jacob: ""Stuff me..."" (Genesis 25:30 . Rabbi Yitzchak ben Zeira said: he opened his mouth agape like a camel and said: ""I will open my mouth and you put it in"" (<i>Tanchumah; Pinchas</i> 13; <i>BaMidbar Rabbah</i> 21:18).</i> he shall not labor in his business except to gain what he needs for immediate use, as [Psalms 37:16] states: <sup class=""footnote-marker"">13</sup><i class=""footnote"">Here again, the Rambam quotes a Biblical verse, because his definition of an intermediate path may seem extreme. The verse also clarifies that the Rambam is not denigrating the idea of work, but excessive preoccupation with one's profession as a means of acquiring possessions.<br>It is highly unlikely that the Rambam would criticize work per se. Note Proverbs 6:6: ""Sluggard, go to the ant, see its ways and become wise;"" and <i>Berachot</i> 8a:<br>He who enjoys the toil of his hands is greater than one who fears God..., as it is stated: ""If you eat of the work of you hands, you are fortunate and will possess the good"" (Psalms 128:2 .""You are fortunate"" - in this life, and ""will possess the good"" - in the world to come.<br>The Rambam, himself, quotes the latter passage in <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 3:11.

Thus, the contrasting extreme would be freehandedness. <i>Yikabetz</i>, like <i>vikubatz</i> in Halachah 1, reflects miserly behavior, the opposite of which is being a spendthrift.

Human Dispositions 1.6,"[Our Sages] taught [the following] explanation of this <sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Rambam appears to be referring to the <i>Sifre, Ekev</i> 11:22, which he quotes in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (ibid.). That explanation is also paralleled in the <i>Mechiltah</i> (Exodus 14:2  and <i>Shabbat</i> 133b.<br>It must be noted that other Talmudic and Midrashic sources interpret the commandment to imitate God in a different light. Note <i>Sotah</i> 14a:<br>[Deuteronomy 13:5 states]: ""You shall walk after God, your Lord."" Is it possible for man to walk after the Divine Presence? Has it not been stated: ""Behold, God, your Lord, is a consuming fire"" (Deuteronomy 4:24 ?Rather, [it means] one should follow the qualities of God.Just as He dresses the naked..., you, too, should dress the naked;God visited the sick...; you, too, should visit the sick;God comforted the bereaved...;you, too, should comfort the bereaved;God buried the dead...; you, too, should bury the dead.<br>In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam mentions emulating both God's deeds and His qualities. Similarly, <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, in its description of this mitzvah, and the <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> in his commentary - both here in <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> and also in <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> - mention both deeds and qualities.<br>There is not necessarily a contradiction between these two emphases. As mentioned above, our actions reflect our personalities. Therefore, it follows that developing our characters in the manner outlined by the Rambam in this halachah will ultimately produce the good deeds mentioned by our Sages in the passage from <i>Sotah</i>.<br>Nevertheless, deed is often not a reflection of character. A person with many severe character faults may still do good deeds. Hence, for the ""resemblance of God"" to be complete, it is not sufficient merely to perform positive deeds.

To do so would limit Him and detract from His infinite and transcendent state of being.<br>Rather, the use of these titles must be understood as follows: God brings about activities, which, had they been carried out by man, would have been motivated by these emotional states. For example, instead of utterly destroying the Jews after the sin of the Golden Calf, God allowed our people to continue. Were such a deed to have been performed by a human ruler, we would describe him as ""slow to anger.""

Accordingly, some commentaries have explained that this decision applies only when the deity is worshiped by throwing staffs. The <i>Pri Chadash</i>, however, differentiates between the liability of the worshiper (for which a sprinkling that spatters is not required) and the prohibition of the worship of the deity (for which it is).</i> because throwing a staff is not considered equivalent to sprinkling blood.

Hence, he is not punished by the court for his deed, nor is he obligated for <i>karet</i> by God. Since he, nevertheless, did perform an act of worship to these gods, he must bring a sacrifice for atonement.<br>The above represents the <i>Kessef Mishneh's</i> interpretation of this halachah. Many other authorities (see <i>Tosafot, Sanhedrin</i> 64a) disagree, and maintain that even in such circumstances, one could be held liable for capital punishment. For example, two witnesses who knew the law were present and warned the person against repudiating the idol in this fashion. He ignored their warning and performed the derisive act of worship. Although his intent was not to serve the deity, since he performed an act of worship despite the warning he was given, he is liable for execution.<br>Rav Kapach brings support for the <i>Kessef Mishneh's</i> view from the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 7:6. There, the Rambam discusses a similar situation and states that a person who performs such service ""is liable for a sin offering."" In the original texts of that commentary, the Rambam stated that the person ""is liable."" The addition of the words ""for a sin offering"" appear to indicate that he is liable only for an offering, but not for punishment by the court.

He explains that since the craftsman fashions the idol on behalf of the person who commissioned him, he is considered to be the latter's agent. Therefore, the one who commissioned him is held responsible for his deed.<br>The commentaries question this explanation, noting that - with the exception of a few specific instances - the Torah never holds a person who commissions another individual to commit a sin liable, since the person who actually committed the sin is responsible for his actions. Also, the Rambam's phraseology here implies that one is held liable regardless whether the craftsman is a Jew or gentile, and a gentile is never given the halachic status of an agent.<br>The following are among the resolutions offered to this difficulty:a) A hired worker's actions - whether positive or negative - are always attributed to his employer (<i>Machaneh Efrayim, Hilchot Shutafim</i> 8).b) The verse prohibiting this act reveals that this is one of the few exceptions to the general rule mentioned above, and in this case, the person who commissioned the agent is held liable (<i>Darchei HaMelech</i>).c) Commenting on <i>Hilchot Sechirut</i> 13:2, the <i>Mishneh LaMelech</i> explains that if it is possible to violate a particular prohibition by committing a deed, one is punished by lashes even when one violates it without committing a deed. The same concept can be applied here (<i>S'deh Chemed</i>).d) The deed for which one is punished is not the command to make the idol, but rather its purchase or acquisition (<i>Merchevat HaMishneh</i>, Alfandari)."

This <sup class=""footnote-marker"">15</sup><i class=""footnote"">leniency</i> applies even to images which protrude. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">16</sup><i class=""footnote"">From these two halachot, particularly according to the Rambam's understanding as reflected in his Commentary on the Mishnah, we see that there is no conflict between Torah law and aesthetics. There are only two restrictions: realistic human statues (and according to some authorities, these must be complete, full-bodied statues) and depictions of pagan gods. Even according to the other opinions which forbid depictions of the sun, the moon, and the like, there is no prohibition against abstract portrayals of these entities. No other restrictions apply at all.<br>There is definitely a divergence between the approach to life that spawned much of the art forms of Western culture and a Torah lifestyle. Perhaps for that reason, many religious Jews have traditionally shunned participation in and patronage of the arts. In the present generation, however, a number of our Torah leaders have urged religious artists to dedicate themselves to expressing Torah ideas and values in a variety of art forms, explaining that:a) Through these media, it is possible to reach many Jews who might never enter a synagogue or Torah center;b) Everything in the world was created to be used by the Jews for a Torah purpose (Rashi, Genesis 1:1 . This also applies to art. Using these art forms for Torah purposes expresses the true intent for their creation and endows them with a depth of meaning and inspiration - and in its deepest sense, a new wellspring of creativity.<br>According to Kabbalah, God's presence is more manifest in the <i>sefirah</i> of <i>Tiferet</i> (""Beauty"") than in any other <i>sefirah</i>. Thus, the challenge confronting a Torah artist today is to use beauty as a medium to express Godly truth.</i>",14,,"In his Commentary on the Mishnah (ibid.), the Rambam describes this image as a fishlike man with fins and many scales, probably referring to the Greek god Neptune."

Large portions of the Haggadah are found verbatim in the Mishnah, <i>Pesachim</i>, Chapter Ten, and reference is made there to other sections that are not explicitly quoted.<br>However, as obvious from the discussion in that chapter, the precise text of the Haggadah was a matter of debate and question throughout the Talmudic period. A few centuries after the completion of the Talmud, Rav Amram Gaon composed a text of the Haggadah that was accepted internationally, throughout all Jewish communities. Approximately sixty years later, his successor, Rav Saadia Gaon, composed a Haggadah with some changes and emendations. These two texts served as the basis for the Rambam's Haggadah and for the subsequent texts published by other Sages. Only minor differences exist between the Haggadah we use today and that composed by Rav Amram Gaon."

In each case, the Hebrew for song, שירה, is used in the feminine gender, for our redemption was not complete. In contrast, the song to be sung to greet Mashiach will be a<br>שיר חדש, a new song.

Initially they are closed, and as time passes they spread out to a fanlike shape. The Torah requires that they be used for the lulav while they are still in their initial state.<br>This obligation is derived from the fact that the Torah spells the word כפת, without a ו, implying that the date branch should appear to be a single entity (<i>Sukkah</i> 32a).<br>There is a homiletic aspect to using the lulav while its leaves are closed. <i>Vayikra Rabbah</i> 30:12 emphasizes how the mitzvah of lulav and etrog expresses the unity and oneness which pervade the Jewish people. Not only is this unity expressed by the combination of the four species into a single mitzvah, it is reflected in each of the species themselves. Thus, the lulav is used while its leaves are together as one, before they separate into distinct entities.</i> Rather, they should appear as a scepter. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">5</sup><i class=""footnote"">Here, too, our Sages have emphasized the homiletic lesson to be derived from this shape. Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur are days of judgement. The lulav can be considered as the Jews' scepter of victory, acknowledging that they have prevailed (<i>Medrash Tanchumah, Emor</i>).</i> This is called a lulav.<br><br><br><img src=""data:image/jpg;base64,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""><br><br>",6,,This is called a lulav.

From this incident, our Sages concluded that, on the later days, even such an etrog is kosher.<br>According to the Rambam's opinion, the same applies to all other physical blemishes on the species.

However, those who follow the first opinion (the Ra'avad, the Ramban, Rabbenu Asher) forbid the use of stolen species on the later days as well. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (ibid.) quotes the Rambam, while the Ramah follows the other view.<br>[Though the above explanation is frequently used, it is difficult to accept.

In addition, he has not yet mentioned the halachah requiring one to own the lulav used on the first day.<br>The <i>Taz</i> (649:15) clarifies the matter slightly further by explaining that since taking the lulav on the second day is only a Rabbinic commandment, using a stolen lulav is allowed even though it is a מצוה הבאה בעבירה.]</i> On the second day of the festival <sup class=""footnote-marker"">4</sup><i class=""footnote"">The literal translation of the Rambam's words are ""from the second holiday,"" implying that these leniencies are granted even in the Diaspora, where the second day is celebrated as a holiday.

Indeed, the Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 50b; see also the Rambam's commentary on the above-mentioned Mishnah) emphasizes that connection, quoting Isaiah 12:3: ""And you shall draw water with happiness.""

Though this celebration was associated with the water libation, the latter is not the source for the practice. Indeed, the choice of the name <i>Simchat Beit HaSho'evah</i> (the celebration of the house of drawing the water), and not <i>Simchat Hasho'evah</i> (the celebration of the drawing of the water) allows for such an interpretation.

Thus, in <i>Sefer Hamitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 54), the Rambam describes that mitzvah and explains that it includes ""to celebrate with musical instruments and to dance in the Temple....This is <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i>.""<br>This explanation resolves another question: <i>Mo'ed Kattan</i> 8b teaches that one celebration should not be interposed upon another.

Rabbi Elazar struck him and he nullified it.We learn from this three things: a) a gentile can nullify an idol whether it belongs to him or to his colleague; b) a gentile who is knowledgeable about idol worship can nullify it, while one who is not knowledgeable cannot nullify it; c) a gentile's nullification of idol worship is effective even if he is compelled to do so.<br>Neither a minor nor a fool is considered ""knowledgeable about idol worship."" hence, their nullification is not acceptable.<br>When a gentile is forced to nullify a false deity - whether it belongs to him or to other gentiles - even when he is forced to do so by Jews, the nullification is of consequence.<br>The gentile who nullifies idol worship must himself be an idolater. - It does not, however, matter whether the idolater worships the particular idol he nullifies or not. For example, a worshiper of Pe'or can nullify a shrine of Marculis (<i>Avodah Zarah</i> 64b).</i> When a gentile is forced to nullify a false deity - whether it belongs to him or to other gentiles, even when he is forced to do so by Jews - the nullification is of consequence.<br>The gentile who nullifies idol worship must himself be an idolater. If he is not an idolater, his nullification is of no consequence.<br>When <sup class=""footnote-marker"">8</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Avodah Zarah</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) states that a <i>ger toshav</i> - a gentile who accepts the observance of the seven universal laws given to Noach and his descendants - cannot nullify an idol.<br>As stated in Chapter 10, Halachah 6, a <i>ger toshav</i> must formalize his acceptance of these laws before a Rabbinic court. Also, the laws of a <i>ger toshav</i> apply only during the era when the Jubilee year is observed. Nevertheless, from <i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 11:7 and 13:11, it appears that even a gentile who observes the seven Noachide laws cannot nullify an idol in the present era. There, the Rambam explains that the Moslems are not considered to be idolaters regarding the laws of <i>yayin nesech</i>. Thus, it can be assumed that their nullification of idol worship would not be of consequence.<br>See also the statements of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 124:2) and the Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 124:5), which appear to accept this decision.</i> [a gentile] nullifies a false deity, he also nullifies [the connection to idol worship of] its accessories. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">9</sup><i class=""footnote"">and it becomes permitted to benefit from them. The Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 146:13) states that this law applies even if a Jew had already taken possession of the accessories, so long as the false deity remained in the possession of the gentile.</i> When he nullifies [the connection to idol worship of] its accessories, it is permitted to benefit from the accessories. [The deity] itself, however, remains forbidden until it is nullified. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">10</sup><i class=""footnote"">On the contrary, the fact that the gentile did not nullify the false deity itself indicates that he still has some reverence for it.</i> [The connection to idol worship of] an object that was brought to an idol as an offering <sup class=""footnote-marker"">11</sup><i class=""footnote"">whether it was brought by a Jew or gentile</i> can never be nullified. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">12</sup><i class=""footnote"">From <i>Hilchot Sha'ar Avot HaTum'ah</i> 6:7, it appears that this decision applies only to foods which were offered to a false deity. If other articles were brought as offerings, different laws apply.</i>",3,"The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and others question why a Jew's idol should be entombed instead of destroyed, as required in Halachah 6. [Note that <i>Tosafot</i>, <i>Avodah Zarah</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, interpret the Hebrew <i>genizah</i> to mean ""destruction,"" rather than entombment, in this instance.]<br><i>Avodat HaMelech</i> explains that since the concept is derived from a Biblical proof-text, there is no difficulty. It is all a matter of Divine decree. In one instance, God desires that the false deities be destroyed, while in another instance He desires that they be entombed.<br>Similarly, when a false deity","Note that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 146:2) distinguishes between a false deity itself and its accessories and adornments, stating that the latter may be nullified by a gentile even after they have been acquired by a Jew."

Nevertheless, the Sages also required that we search for chametz and destroy it completely. However, when a person does not nullify his chametz, the obligation to search takes on the severity of a Torah commandment.<br>This and the following halachot (8 through 13) deal with circumstances which raise questions whether a second search is required. Throughout these halachot, the Rambam makes no mention of whether the owner of the house previously nullified his chametz or not. This fact is extremely important, for different principles apply to an obligation required by Torah law from those that apply to one instituted by the Rabbis. Indeed, other Rabbinic authorities (some of whom are quoted in the commentaries to the various halachot) devote much attention to this issue, clarifying at length whether the laws apply:a) only when a person had already nullified (or can still nullify) his chametz, or;<br>b) even when the search for chametz is required by Torah law.Since the Rambam does not explicitly state his opinion on this matter, it is impossible to be sure which perspective he adopts. However, when the chapter is considered in its entirety, it appears that these halachot describe a situation where chametz has already been nullified. Unless specified to the contrary, this should be assumed to be the case. Nevertheless, certain of the leniencies are also applicable even when the search takes on the severity of a Torah obligation.</i>",1,,"<i>Pesachim</i> 9a states: ""We do not suspect that a weasel dragged chametz from one house to another or from place to place."" Rashi explains that this statement applies after the search for chametz was carried out. Once we have searched our homes, we need not worry that rodents brought new chametz there.<br>In contrast, the Rambam interprets the statement as applying before the search. There is no need to suspect that perhaps a rodent took chametz from a place where chametz is usually kept to a place where it is not usually brought. The Kessef Mishneh emphasizes that the two interpretations are not contradictory and both are halachically applicable."

Based on that decision, many commentaries explain that the Rambam's statements refer only to intensive study of the subject matter described as <i>Gemara</i> in the previous halachot.</i> because most women <sup class=""footnote-marker"">5</sup><i class=""footnote"">Commentaries have mentioned that by adding the word ""most,"" the Rambam implies that if a father sees that his daughter is capable of such study, he should afford her the opportunity.</i> cannot concentrate their attention on study, and thus transform the words of Torah into idle matters because of their lack of understanding.<br>[Thus,] <sup class=""footnote-marker"">6</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> notes the contrast between the first clause, ""A woman who studies,"" and the command the Sages gave ""a father."" He differentiates between study that a woman undertakes voluntarily, which is considered desirable, and a father's training his daughter in matters which are not necessarily relevant to her.</i> our Sages declared: <sup class=""footnote-marker"">7</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Sotah</i> 21b</i> ""Whoever teaches his daughter Torah is like one who teaches her tales and parables."" <sup class=""footnote-marker"">8</sup><i class=""footnote"">Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Sotah</i> 3:3).

The Meiri renders it as ""vanity,"" explaining that a woman who has studied will boast of her achievements.</i> This applies to the Oral Law. [With regard to] the Written Law: at the outset, one should not teach one's daughter. However, if one teaches her, it is not considered as if she was taught idle things. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">9</sup><i class=""footnote"">Though the Rambam's statements are quoted in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 246:6), the source for his statements has been questioned.<br>Some point to the Mishnah, <i>Nedarim</i> 3:3, which, in passing, mentions a daughter's study of the Written Law. However, the Rambam's own text of that Mishnah lacks the words ""or daughter."" Others point to <i>Chaggigah</i> 3a (and more specifically, to the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>ibid.</i> 1:1), which describes the reading of the Torah by the king during the <i>Hakhel</i> celebration, which women were also required to attend. Nevertheless, there is a difference between study of the Written Law in its entirety and hearing the reading of a few inspirational passages. (See <i>Taz</i> 246:4.)<br>In this context, it might be noted that the <i>Tur's</i> text of the Rambam reverses these statements and mentioned teaching women the Oral Law as preferable to the Written Law. This can easily be reconciled with the opinions mentioned above, which require a woman to learn the laws governing the mitzvot she is obligated to fulfill. In contrast, the Written Law is a less closely defined field of study. There, a greater possibility exists that a woman who is not gifted may misinterpret the teachings.</i>",3,,"Chassidic thought explains the concept differently. The Hebrew word <i>mitzvah</i> (commandment) shares the same root as the word <i>tzavtah</i> (connection). Fulfilling the commandments establishes a transcendent bond with Godliness.

Another version states יחיד בציבור (an individual in a congregation).<br>In these cases, there might be cause for embarrassment if he was not answered. However, there is no such restriction when an individual prays by himself. See also <i>Tosafot, Megillah</i> (<i>ibid.</i>).</i> Rather, he should tilt his face slightly, but not press it to the ground.<br>One <sup class=""footnote-marker"">5</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Megillah</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) derives this law from the actions of Ravvah and Abbaye, who followed this practice instead of falling to the ground in accordance with the above rule.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 131:8) rules in accordance with the Rambam. The Ramah adds that no one should prostrate himself on the floor even if it is not stone. Therefore, the custom today is that everyone rests their heads on their arms while reciting <i>Tachanun</i>.</i> may pray in one place and offer this supplication in another",6,One may pray in one place and offer this supplication in another place.,"The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> maintains that this can be derived from the following narrative in <i>Megillah</i> (<i>ibid.</i>). Rav came to a synagogue in Babylonia, but did not fall to the ground after the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> as they did. One of the explanations offered by the Talmud for his behavior is that there was a stone floor in front of Rav, but not in front of the other congregants. The Talmud then asks: ""Why didn't Rav move to their place?"", obviously implying that one may offer this supplication in a place other than one's place of prayer."

Since he explicitly states that the sukkah must be constructed for the purpose of shade, one might infer that the expression ""according to law"" is intended to include other concepts. Thus, it can be a reference to the requirements for a sukkah's size and the nature of the materials used for the <i>s'chach</i>, as mentioned in this and the previous chapter.</i> - even if it was not made for the purpose of [fulfilling] the mitzvah - if it was made according to law, it is kosher. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">2</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 1:1, states:An old sukkah: The School of Shammai deems it unacceptable, while the School of Hillel rules it kosher.The commentaries explain that the term ""an old sukkah"" refers to any sukkah that was constructed for purposes other than the fulfillment of the mitzvah.<br>In its discussion of this law, the Jerusalem Talmud requires that one must make an addition or change to the <i>s'chach</i>.

principle applies only with regard to <i>s'chach</i>, where it is logical to assume that a more lenient position would be taken, since the entire question revolves around a Rabbinic decree, or whether it also applies in all cases where Torah law itself requires a bundle.</i> Furthermore, even if one tied the tops of the branches from one side, and they thus appear to be a single bundle with one of its two ends bound naturally and the other bound as a result of human activity, it may be used as <i>s'chach</i>. A single tree which is bound up is not considered to be a bundle, but rather a single piece of wood, since [the branches] are bound together <sup class=""footnote-marker"">5</sup><i class=""footnote"">However, if one were to add even one branch and then tie them together, it would be considered to be a bundle (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 629:15).</i> naturally.<br>Similarly, any knot which is not strong enough to hold when carried is not considered a knot [and the resulting bundle may be used as <i>s'chach</i>]. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">6</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Sukkah</i> 13b mentions this principle when explaining why bundles of willows whose upper tie was loosened could be used as <i>s'chach</i>.</i>",1,Small bundles,"The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> questions the reason for the addition of the adjective, noting that if the bundles contain fewer than twenty five units, they are permitted, as stated in the previous halachah. Others mention that this refers to bundles of small branches."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.12","A person who constructs his sukkah under a tree is considered as though he built it within his <sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">and the sukkah is unacceptable. This applies only when the shade the tree produces exceeds the open area. However, if there is more open space under the tree than shade, the sukkah may be kosher.<br>The determination of whether such a sukkah is kosher depends on a number of principles, based on the interpretation of <i>Sukkah</i> 9b and 11a. The Rambam's interpretation of that passage, and thus the ground rules he establishes, differ from those accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 626:1-2).<br>In the following halachah, the Rambam deals with the resolution of the question when no effort has been made to correct the problem of the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i>. As will be explained, there his interpretation is contested by other authorities. In this halachah, the Rambam describes the rulings which govern the situation when an effort has been made to rectify the situation by detaching the branches from their source of nurture. These are based on the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 11a, and are also accepted by other Rabbinic authorities. (See the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 626:2.)</i> home.<br>If one draped the leaves and branches of trees [over the sukkah], and then placed <i>s'chach</i> over them, and only afterwards detached them, <sup class=""footnote-marker"">2</sup><i class=""footnote"">As mentioned in Halachot 1 and 2, branches are fit to be used for <i>s'chach</i> only after they have been detached from their source of nurture.</i> [the following rules apply:]<br>If the amount of [kosher] <i>s'chach</i> exceeded [the branches], it is kosher. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">4</sup><i class=""footnote"">Though at present, the branches would be acceptable as <i>s'chach</i>, as explained in the commentary on Halachah 9, the Torah requires that when <i>s'chach</i> is originally put in place, it must be kosher. Otherwise, it is unacceptable even though steps were taken to correct the disqualifying factors. This is based on the principle that one must make a sukkah and not use one which is already made.<br>Nevertheless, since the prohibition against using these branches as <i>s'chach</i> does not relate to their essential nature, their presence may be nullified when there is a majority of kosher <i>s'chach</i>. This conforms to the principle of ביטול ברב.</i> If the amount of <i>s'chach</i> which originally was kosher did not exceed [the branches], <sup class=""footnote-marker"">5</sup><i class=""footnote"">the presence of the branches remains halachically significant.

For the final cup, one should drink an entire quarter of a <i>log</i>.<br>The source of the latter law is <i>Pesachim</i> 108a, which mentions a person who drinks wine from his cup and then gives to his children and the members of his household. The Talmud concludes that he fulfills his obligation if he drinks the majority of the cup.

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> offers a different rationale, explaining that the Rambam did not state that the Torah requires that a specific number of blessings be recited for grace.<br>The <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> clarifies the matter further, explaining that the Rambam maintains that the Torah requires us to mention three concepts in grace: appreciation for the sustenance God grants us, appreciation for <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, and appreciation for Jerusalem. According to the Torah, it does not matter how these three concepts are mentioned, whether in one blessing (as in <i>al hamichyah</i>), two blessings (as in this law), or three blessings (as is the usual case).</i> so that they do not neglect their employer's work.<br>[In <sup class=""footnote-marker"">3</sup><i class=""footnote"">From this we learn two concepts:a) that it is forbidden to work while reciting grace (Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 2:5; <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 183:12);b) how important it is for a worker to devote himself faithfully to his work.

Nevertheless, if a person remembers his omission in time to add the special blessing, even the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:7) requires it to be recited after any and all meals on Sabbaths and festivals.</i> Blessed [are You, God...] who has granted rest to His people Israel as a sign and a holy covenant.

We are obligated to eat only two meals that require grace on these holy days. One may fulfill his obligation for the third meal with other foods, without eating bread on the Sabbath, whereas on festivals one is not obligated to eat a third meal at all.<br>Accordingly, although there is a dimension of holiness connected with all the Sabbath and festival meals, the need to mention this dimension in grace is considered significant enough to require repetition of all the blessings only when an omission is made in the first two meals of the day.<br>It must be noted that neither the Rambam nor <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) make such a differentiation explicitly. This has led the <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> and others to postulate that the Rambam maintains that an omission of the Sabbath or festivals in grace is sufficient to require repetition of the blessings in any meal eaten on these holy days.</i> and return to the beginning [of grace], the blessing for sustenance. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">11</sup><i class=""footnote"">If three people ate together and made the same omission, however, they do not repeat the <i>zimmun</i> (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>:9).<br>The Ra'avad challenges the Rambam's decision, calling attention to a law quoted by the Rambam in <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 10:10. When a person omits <i>Ya'aleh v'yavo</i> in the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, he is required to repeat the entire <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. Nevertheless, if he is accustomed to recite prayers of supplication after <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> before withdrawing from his place of prayer, and remembers while in the midst of those supplications, he is not required to repeat <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. All that is necessary is to return to the blessing <i>R'tzey</i>.<br>Similarly, the Ra'avad argues, the blessing <i>Hatov v'hametiv</i> resembles the supplicatory prayers recited after <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. Accordingly, one should return to the third blessing of grace and not recite the other two.<br>This opinion, although respected for its sound reasoning, is not accepted by most authorities. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:6) and others quote the Rambam's view.</i>",5,"Blessed [are You, God...]","Our text follows the position of the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, who emphasizes that this blessing contains God's name and the phrase ""King of the universe,"" as do other blessings.

Once that day is concluded, the chametz must be destroyed. In contrast, in this instance the chametz will remain in the Jew's possession throughout the entire holiday.

In contrast, a convert's inheritance of his gentile father's estate is a Rabbinic decree, instituted in consideration of the convert. According to the Torah, once he converts, he has no connection to his natural parents.

It must be noted that many of the classic commentaries on the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> have questioned why the Rambam mentions the concept of a transaction made in error only in the case when the Jew took possession and did not pay, but not when he paid and did not take possession. They have offered several possible resolutions, including a sweeping statement by <i>Avodat HaMelech</i> that our Sages nullified the effectiveness of monetary payment as an effective means of finalizing the transfer of property (<i>kinyan</i>), not only with regard to transactions between two Jews (see <i>Hilchot Mechirah</i> 3:1,4-5), but also with regard to transactions between a Jew and a gentile.<br>(Interestingly, though the Rambam's phraseology has raised such problems, it is quoted verbatim by the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah</i> 146:3.)<br>When stating that a forbidden object must be destroyed, our Sages frequently used the expression:</i> he must take [the idols] to the Dead <sup class=""footnote-marker"">11</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Tosafot, Avodah Zarah</i> 43b, explain that one need not literally take the idols to the Dead Sea.

In contrast, a convert's inheritance of his gentile father's estate is a Rabbinic decree, instituted in consideration of the convert. According to the Torah, once he converts, he has no connection to his natural parents.

He explains that this is because this blessing is also often recited in isolation, before the reading of the Torah in the synagogue.<br>The recitation of the blessings of the Torah is very important. <i>Bava Metzia</i> 85a states that Eretz Yisrael was destroyed because the Jews forsook the Torah.

A person who studies Torah without reciting the blessings fails to realize its holiness and sanctity, therefore, it is considered as if he """"forsook the Torah.''</i>",5,And,"The presence here of the Hebrew letter <i>vav</i> (ו) which is generally translated as ""and"" is the subject of much discussion among the Rabbis.<br><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 46a) explains that, according to <i>Rabbenu Tam</i>, any blessing that follows another blessing of only a single line must itself begin ""Blessed are You..."" and cannot be included in the phrase ""Blessed are You..."" in the first blessing. Therefore, since this paragraph does not begin ""Blessed are You...,"" it appears to be a continuation of the first blessing and not a blessing of its own. The <i>vav</i> - ""and"" - indicates the connection between the two paragraphs.<br>The Rambam, however, clearly states that the second paragraph is considered as a blessing in its own right and not a continuation of the first blessing.

A similar decision is rendered by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 121:7). Nevertheless, the authorities suggest that chametz may be purged from knives by boiling. However, they do not permit this leniency in the following instances:<br>a) when the knives are rusty;<br>b) when they have serrated edges;<br>c) when the handle is separate from the blade and enclosed around it, allowing for the possibility for residue to collect between them.<br>In the latter instance, even ליבון (exposing the knife to open fire) is insufficient. Since most knives today are made in this manner, they should not be kashered for Pesach or for ordinary use after having been used with prohibited foods.

Rather, after sounding three series of <i>teki'ah, shevarim, teru'ah, teki'ah</i>, three series of <i>teki'ah, shevarim, teki'ah</i>, and then three series of <i>teki'ah, teru'ah, teki'ah</i> is sounded.</i> series.<br>[Then,] he sounds a <i>teki'ah</i>; afterwards, three <i>shevarim</i>; and afterwards, a <i>teki'ah</i>. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">10</sup><i class=""footnote"">in accordance with the opinion that maintains that a <i>teru'ah</i> resembles sighing.

When the shofar is sounded, you will hear (Isaiah 18:3 .<br>And it shall be on that day, that a great shofar will be sounded, and those who were lost in the land of Asshur and those who were banished in the land of Egypt shall come and bow down to God on the holy mountain in Jerusalem (Isaiah 27:13 .<br>And God will appear over them and His arrow shall go forth like lightning. God, the Lord, will sound the shofar and proceed in a southerly storm-wind (Zechariah 9:14-15).<i>Concluding Verse</i>And on the days of your rejoicing; on your holidays, and on your Rosh Chodesh days, you shall sound the trumpets over your burnt-offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings, and they shall be a remembrance for you before your Lord.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 3.12","It is logical that each series of shofar blasts should be sounded three times for every blessing, <sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">Because of the doubt mentioned in Halachah 3, it would be proper for us to blow three series of blasts - i.e., <i>teki'ah, shevarim, teru'ah, teki'ah; teki'ah, shevarim, teki'ah</i>; and <i>teki'ah, teru'ah, teki'ah</i> - at the conclusion of each blessing.</i> as [the shofar] was sounded while [the congregation] was seated. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">2</sup><i class=""footnote"">the shofar blasts sounded before musaf.</i> However, since they <sup class=""footnote-marker"">3</sup><i class=""footnote"">the congregation</i> satisfied every possible doubt <sup class=""footnote-marker"">4</sup><i class=""footnote"">regarding the proper manner of blowing the shofar, as explained in Halachah 3.</i> [by hearing] the shofar while seated, there is no need for the congregation to repeat them <sup class=""footnote-marker"">5</sup><i class=""footnote"">these shofar blasts</i> in their entirety during the order of blessings.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 592:1) suggests following the pattern described by the Rambam, but sounding each series three times, rather than once. The Ramah writes that Ashkenazic custom is to sound one series - <i>teki'ah, shevarim, teru'ah, teki'ah</i> - after each blessing. However, the <i>Sh'lah</i> suggests blowing three series of blasts - i.e., <i>teki'ah, shevarim, teru'ah, teki'ah; teki'ah, shevarim, teki'ah</i>; and <i>teki'ah, teru'ah, teki'ah</i> - at the conclusion of each blessing.</i> of the above applies only to a congregation. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">8</sup><i class=""footnote"">as specifically stated in Halachot 7 and 10.</i> However, there is no [set] custom regarding an individual. He fulfills his obligation whether or not he hears [the shofar blasts] during the order of blessings, <sup class=""footnote-marker"">9</sup><i class=""footnote"">Some authorities object to the permission granted by the Rambam for an individual to interrupt his recitation of the the <i>Amidah</i> in order to hear the sounding of the shofar.

(In this context, see Rashi, <i>Shabbat</i> 73a, which states that the forbidden labor of baking was not practiced in the Sanctuary although one of the offerings was the showbread which was baked each week.)</i> sum of all the primary categories of [forbidden] labor are forty minus one. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">5</sup><i class=""footnote"">The commentaries question why the Rambam (and his source, <i>Shabbat</i> 7:2, use this expression, rather than merely stating ""thirty-nine."" Some draw attention to the parallel found in the Mishnah's description of the number of lashes given a transgressor (<i>Makkot</i> 3:10). Others explain that this expression indicates that there is a fortieth activity - the spiritual service of prayer and study - which must be performed on the Sabbath day.</i> They include:<br><br><br>1) plowing,<br><br><br><br>2) sowing,<br>3) <sup class=""footnote-marker"">7</sup><i class=""footnote"">Significantly, plowing is mentioned before sowing in the Mishnah. <i>Shabbat</i> 73b explains that this was done to teach that if the earth is hard, and it is necessary to re-plow the land after the first plowing, one is liable for the second plowing as well. The Rambam, however, follows the usual order of activities. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 2.)</i> reaping,<br>4) <sup class=""footnote-marker"">8</sup><i class=""footnote"">As explained in Chapter 8, Halachah 3, this refers to reaping with a utensil. Severing produce by hand is considered merely a derivative. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 3.)</i> collecting sheaves,<br>5) <sup class=""footnote-marker"">9</sup><i class=""footnote"">In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam mentions that the reapers usually gather the grain in small sheaves. Others follow who collect these sheaves into larger bundles. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 5.)<br>According to one opinion in <i>Shabbat</i> 96b, there is an explicit reference to the prohibition of this labor on the Sabbath. Numbers, ch. 15, relates that a person was executed for collecting wood on the Sabbath. As the Rambam states Chapter 21, Halachah 11, this labor includes only the collection of produce. Gathering other substances - e.g., salt - is not included. It is, however, forbidden by Rabbinic decree.</i> threshing,<br>6) <sup class=""footnote-marker"">10</sup><i class=""footnote"">applying pressure to grain to extract the kernel from its husk. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 7.)</i> winnowing,<br>7) <sup class=""footnote-marker"">11</sup><i class=""footnote"">casting the mixture of kernels and husks to the wind. The wind will blow away the chaff, while the kernels that are heavier will fall to the ground.</i> separating,<br>8) <sup class=""footnote-marker"">12</sup><i class=""footnote"">separating stones and the like from the kernels of grain. This is usually done by hand.</i> grinding,<br>9) <sup class=""footnote-marker"">13</sup><i class=""footnote"">crushing the kernels into flour. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 15.)</i> sifting,<br>10) <sup class=""footnote-marker"">14</sup><i class=""footnote"">the flour with a sifter. <i>Shabbat</i> 74a (see also Chapter 8, Halachah 11) notes that the three labors - winnowing, separating, and sifting - are similar. Nevertheless, because they represent three different activities performed in the construction of the Sanctuary, each one is considered a separate primary category of forbidden labor.</i> kneading,<br>11) <sup class=""footnote-marker"">15</sup><i class=""footnote"">mixing the flour with water to create a dough. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 16.)</i> baking,<br>12) shearing,<br>13) whitening,<br>14) beating,<br>15) dyeing,<br>16) spinning,<br>17) making <sup class=""footnote-marker"">16</sup><i class=""footnote"">This also includes cooking, roasting, or the like. In the construction of the Sanctuary, cooking was necessary for the preparation of dyes. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 1.)<br><b>shearing -</b> This and the following twelve labors are necessary for the preparation of fabric. Shearing involves removing hair or wool from an animal, whether dead or alive. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 7.)<br><b>whitening -</b> After the wool is removed from the animal, it is washed to remove dirt. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 10.)<br><b>beating -</b> Unlike Rashi and others who interpret as combing the wool, in the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah he translates the word into an Arabic term meaning ""beat it with a stick."" This activity is necessary as a preliminary stage of the preparation of flax to be spun into linen. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 12.)<br><b>dyeing -</b> for most of the fabrics used in the curtains and roof-coverings of the Sanctuary were dyed. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 13.)<br><b>spinning -</b> intertwining the fibers to make thread. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 15.)<br><b>making heddles -</b> The Hebrew, literally means ""house of string."" In the weaving process, it refers to the following practice: Weaving involves passing the threads of the woof over and under each of the consecutive threads of the warp. In order to facilitate this process, two frames are made, each possessing many threads with a loop (referred to as a ""heddle"") in the middle of these threads. The threads of the warp are passed through these loops, one from one frame, and the next from the other, consecutively. When this is completed, the weaver lifts the two frames alternately. As he raises one up, he passes the woof through. In this manner, he is able to thread the woof through the entire warp at one time. (See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Shabbat</i> 7:2; <i>Keilim</i> 21:1.)<br><b>mounting the warp -</b> See Chapter 9, Halachah 17-18, where the Rambam describes how a loom is set up. First, the threads of the warp are extended to the desired length and width. They are then attached to a rod on either side, and held taut. This is the activity referred to by this term.<br><b>weaving -</b> passing the threads of the woof between the threads of the warp. (See Chapter 9, <i>loc. cit.</i>)<br><b>undoing woven fabric -</b> See Chapter 9, Halachah 20.<br><b>tying -</b> This refers to a permanent knot whose tying requires professional expertise. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 1.) In the construction of the Sanctuary, the <i>chilazon</i> which were used for dye were caught with nets that had to be tied (<i>Shabbat</i> 74b).<br><b>untying -</b> This also includes untying only such knots. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 7.)<br><b>sewing -</b> at least two stitches. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 9.)<br><b>tearing -</b> in order to sew. Otherwise, one is not liable. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 10.) If a hole was found in one of the curtains of the Sanctuary, it was cut open and sewn close (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 302:4).<br><b>building -</b> any structure; similarly, leveling the ground is included in this category. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 12.) The <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> gives as an example, the placement of the boards of the Sanctuary in their sockets.<br><b>demolishing -</b> Here also the intent must be a constructive one: demolishing in order to rebuild. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 15.)<br><b>beating with a hammer -</b> The <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> points to the fashioning of the <i>menorah</i> in the Sanctuary.<br>A craftsman finishing the fashioning of a utensil concludes his work by giving several taps with a hammer to smooth the utensil's surface. Thus, this labor also includes all activities performed to apply the finishing touch to an object - e.g., polishing and shining. (See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>loc. cit.,</i> and Chapter 10, Halachah 16.)<br><b>trapping -</b> The Mishnah mentions the following seven categories as activities necessary to write a scroll. Leather hides were used to cover the roof of the Sanctuary. (See also Chapter 10, Halachah 19.)<br><b>slaughtering -</b> Although this term is usually used to refer to ritual slaughter, the intent here is taking a life through any means. (See Chapter 11, Halachah 1.)<br><b>skinning -</b> the hide of an animal to use for leather. (See Chapter 11, Halachah 5.)<br><b>processing [hides] -</b> into leather. (See Chapter 11, <i>loc. cit.</i>) Significantly, the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 7:2) also includes salting the hides as a separate category of labor. <i>Shabbat</i> 75b, however, includes this activity in the category of processing hides and includes ruling parchment as the thirty-ninth category of labor.<br><b>removing hair -</b> For leather or parchment, smooth skin is required. (See also Chapter 11, Halachah 5, 6.)<br><b>cutting [leather] -</b> This refers to making an exact cut, so that the leather can be used for a purpose. Cutting indiscriminately is a destructive activity. Hence, one is not held liable. (See Chapter 11, Halachah 7.)<br><b>writing -</b> two letters. This activity was necessary in the Sanctuary, for a mark was made on the boards so that the same boards could be matched to each other each time they were attached together. (See Chapter 11, Halachah 9.)<br><b>erasing -</b> For if the builders of the Sanctuary erred in making a sign, they would erase it and write another in its place. In this instance as well, one is held liable only when one erases with the intent of writing two letters in this place. (See Chapter 11, <i>loc. cit.</i>)<br><b>ruling lines -</b> For proper writing is possible only on ruled lines. (See Chapter 11, Halachah 17.) In the Sanctuary, this labor was performed to prepare the hides to be cut.<br><b>kindling a flame -</b> This was necessary to cook the dyes. As the Rambam explains in Chapter 12, Halachah 1, one is liable for kindling a flame only when when desires to cook with it, use it for light, or desires ash. Otherwise, it is considered a destructive activity.<br><b>extinguishing a flame -</b> Here also, one's intent must be constructive - e.g., to use the charcoal produced. In the Sanctuary, this was necessary to produce an even flame for the fashioning of the metal utensils (See Chapter 12, Halachah 2.)<br><b>transferring from one domain to another. -</b> All the materials necessary for the construction of the Sanctuary were brought from the private domain to the public domain (<i>Shabbat</i> 96b).

Nevertheless, in practice, it is agreed that women should mention both these mitzvot, because the ultimate fulfillment of the creation of both men and women is when they marry. Therefore, a man and his wife are considered a single unit (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 187:7).</i> There is a doubt whether their obligation stems from the Torah, since [this is a positive mitzvah] that is not linked to a specific time, <sup class=""footnote-marker"">3</sup><i class=""footnote"">Women are not obligated to fulfill such mitzvot. See <i>Kiddushin</i> (1:7). Since the obligation to recite grace is constant, whether one eats during the day or at night, it would appear that women are obligated. Some commentaries point to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 19) and the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 3:3 and <i>Kiddushin</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) as indications that the Rambam supports the view that a woman's obligation for grace stems from the Torah.</i> or whether their obligation does not stem from the Torah. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">4</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Berachot</i> 20b explains this hypothesis: Since Deuteronomy 8:10, the proof-text requiring us to recite grace, states: ""You shall bless God, your Lord, for the good land that He gave you,"" one might think that only those who were given an inheritance in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> are required to recite grace, thus excluding women who were not given an inheritance.</i> Therefore, <sup class=""footnote-marker"">5</sup><i class=""footnote"">i.e., because of this doubt</i> they should not <sup class=""footnote-marker"">6</sup><i class=""footnote"">endeavor to</i> fulfill the obligation of grace on behalf of others. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">7</sup><i class=""footnote"">Since, as stated in Chapter 1, Halachah 11, a person can only recite a blessing on behalf of another person if he shares an equal obligation himself.</i> Children, <sup class=""footnote-marker"">8</sup><i class=""footnote"">Boys below thirteen and girls below twelve, or individuals above that age who have not demonstrated signs of physical maturity.</i> however, are obligated to recite grace <sup class=""footnote-marker"">9</sup><i class=""footnote"">This expression appears to indicate that the Sages placed the obligation on the child himself.

In contrast, since each person may fulfill his obligation to recite grace without a <i>zimmun</i>, leniencies were granted in counting the people included.<br>Rabbenu Asher and the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 199:10) do not accept this distinction, and rule that a child may not be counted in a <i>zimun</i> until he is thirteen years of age and has exhibited signs of physical maturity.</i> A gentile may not be included in a <i>zimmun</i>. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">16</sup><i class=""footnote"">even when we are certain that he will bless God.<br>In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 7:1, based on <i>Berachot</i> 47b), the Rambam states that this refers to a gentile who has already made a decision to convert and has been circumcised for that reason.

This ruling is not accepted by many other authorities, including Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi and Rabbenu Asher. Because of the difference of opinion, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 197:3) rules that, at the outset, an attempt should be made to follow the Rambam's decision.

The commentaries note that the Rambam does not quote <i>Berachot</i> 48a (the source for this halachah) exactly. The Talmud states ""dipped his food in brine with them."" The Rambam's choice of phraseology is particularly difficult since, as the Rambam himself writes in <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i> 2:5, brine is generally not eaten alone as a food.16. The commentaries have noted the apparent redundancy in the Rambam's expressions. The <i>Kol ben Levi</i> offers a possible resolution, explaining that, in the opening clause, the Rambam states that these people are not required to make a <i>zimmun</i>.

According to the other opinions mentioned above, if the third person partakes of other foods, the first two may include him in a <i>zimmun</i>.19. <i>Berachot</i> 47a relates that Rav Simai bar Chiyya joined Rav and Shemuel in a meal after the latter had completed eating.

The Rambam's choice of phraseology is particularly difficult since, as the Rambam himself writes in <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i> 2:5, brine is generally not eaten alone as a food.16. The commentaries have noted the apparent redundancy in the Rambam's expressions. The <i>Kol ben Levi</i> offers a possible resolution, explaining that, in the opening clause, the Rambam states that these people are not required to make a <i>zimmun</i>.

Rather, Rav Yitzchak is of the opinion that it should be inserted into the blessing of ""the One who hears prayer."" Rav Sheshet is also of this opinion.<br>Although the Talmud refers specifically to one who accepted a fast upon himself, it is clear from the continuation of the discussion there that the same halachah applies to the silent <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> recited by everyone on a public fast day also.<br>It is interesting to note that the Rambam obligates one to add עננו in all the prayers recited on a Fast Day. This is in line with <i>Shabbat</i> 24a which states: ""On fast days...in the Evening, Morning, and <i>Minchah</i> Prayers, one adds a mention of the particular day in 'the One who hears prayer.' However, the <i>Tur</i> quotes the Geonim that one should recite עננו only in the <i>Minchah</i> Prayer. Since one could be overcome by terrible hunger and break the fast, if one recited עננו earlier he would have spoken falsely when he mentioned the fast day. Therefore, according to this position, this prayer should be mentioned only in the <i>Minchah</i> service at the end of the fast days.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 565:3) quotes the <i>Tur's</i> position, but distinguishes between the four public fast days that occur every year (i.e., those mentioned above in our commentary) and other public fast days. On the four main public fasts, he obligates the individual to mention עננו in all his prayers. Since the Sages declared it a public fast, even were he to eat later on, he would not have spoken falsely in his prayer.<br>The Ramah ( <i>ibid.</i>), however, mentions that it is customary to recite עננו in <i>Minchah</i> only. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> explains that even one reciting <i>Minchah</i> in the early afternoon should add עננו, because even if he eats later on, at least he fasted until midday. (See Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 562:1.) Sephardim follow the custom of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, and Ashkenazim follow the ruling of the Ramah and therefore recite עננו only in <i>Minchah</i>.</i> leader of the congregation recites it as an independent blessing between ""the One who redeems Israel"" and ""the One who heals...,"" and concludes with ""the One who answers in times of trouble."" Thus, he recites 20 blessings.<br>On <sup class=""footnote-marker"">5</sup><i class=""footnote"">This is based on the passage from <i>Ta'anit</i> 13b quoted above. A clear distinction is made between the silent <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> uttered by all the congregants and the repetition recited aloud by the שליח ציבור (leader of the congregation). The שליח ציבור does establish for himself, as representative of the community as a whole, an independent blessing relevant to the fast day. Therefore, he recites 20 blessings, as explained by the Rambam: 19 blessings as on any day, and one extra that is particular to the fast day.<br>There is no disagreement regarding the obligation of the שליח ציבור to recite עננו in the Morning Prayer. He is praying on behalf of the entire community. Therefore, we need not worry about the possibility of the fast being broken, since it is not possible that a number from among the congregants will not fast the whole day (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 565:3).

It is appropriate that the addition regarding the ninth of Av be placed in this blessing, which speaks of rebuilding Jerusalem.<br>Despite this logic, there is some question regarding the inclusion of this prayer in this blessing. The source for this addition is the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Ta'anit</i> 2:2). That passage questions whether the addition should be made in the עבודה (the first of the last three blessings in the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>) or the הודאה (the second of the last three blessings). It explains that as a general rule commemorative prayers are mentioned in הודאה, while prayers regarding the future are placed in עבודה.<br>Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi quotes this passage, but adds that the custom is to recite the addition in בונה ירושלים (the blessing of Jerusalem). He explains that this decision is based on <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 8a which states that even though normally, we add special requests in the blessing of שומע תפילה (the One who hears prayer), one is able to make a request relevant to one of the blessings of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, in that blessing itself. Therefore, our prayers and supplications regarding the rebuilding of Jerusalem may rightfully be placed in the blessing of בונה ירושלים. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 557:1.)</i> ""Have mercy on us, God, our Lord, and on Your people, Israel, and Jerusalem, Your city, the mourning city,..."" <sup class=""footnote-marker"">8</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Hebrew term is רחם עלינו. This version appears in the Jerusalem Talmud. However, in both Rabbenu Asher's and Rabbenu Yitzhak Alfasi's quotes of that passage, the terms used is נחם (Console us...). This version is found in most siddurim, although the version of Yemenite Jewry is רחם, as in the Rambam.<br>There is also a question regarding when this prayer is recited. The Rambam seems to indicate that רחם (or נחם) is to be recited in every prayer on the ninth of Av. However, the Ramah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 557:1) states that it should only be recited in <i>Minchah</i>, just like עננו on fast days.<br>The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 557) quotes the custom of saying רחם in the Evening and Morning Prayers, and נחם during <i>Minchah</i>. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 557:1) rules that נחם should be recited in all three prayers of the day. This is the custom of Sephardim, though Ashkenazim follow the ruling of the Ramah mentioned above. (See the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 557:1.)<br>The Ramah explains that the rationale behind his decision is that the fire which destroyed the Temple broke out on the afternoon of the ninth of Av. Hence, we ask for comfort at that time specifically. Alternatively, the Ritba explains that only in the afternoon are we able to be comforted. Until then the pain of our loss is too real.</i>",1,"On Fast Days,","This includes the communal fast days (the third of Tishre, the tenth of Tevet, the thirteenth of Adar, the seventeenth of Tammuz, and the ninth of Av) and those fast days proclaimed in response to a specific time of trouble, such as a lack of rain.

Rabbenu Asher (See <i>Tur</i> and <i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 117) raised the question of praying for rain in the summer in Spain or Germany when the climate of the land requires it. Similarly, since the crops in his area would be seriously damaged if rains were not to fall until late November, he lauds the practise (followed in Provence) which begins petitioning for rain in Marcheshvan. At present, the question has become more sensitive when many Jews live in the Southern hemisphere whose rainy season coincides with our summer.<br>Nevertheless, Rav Yosef Karo rules that all places outside of Eretz Yisrael should follow the practice observed in Babylonia.

However, today, because of the general lack of intention that everyone has regarding <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, even the bridegroom is obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i>.<br>The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (70:14) adds that a bridegroom who does not recite the <i>Shema</i> appears haughty, because his actions appear to imply that he usually has a high level of intentions. The bridegroom is also obligated to recite the blessings before and after <i>Kri'at Shema</i> and to pray as usual (<i>Magen Avraham; Mishnah Berurah</i>). These positions are based on <i>Tosafot</i> in <i>Berachot</i> 17b.</i>",1,Women,"<i>Berachot</i> 20b relates:<br>A woman's exemption from <i>Kri'at Shema</i> is obvious.

Thus, a person who tends to otherworldliness and asceticism, defeats God's purpose in creation.</i> Whoever follows this path is called a sinner [as implied by Numbers 6:11's] statement concerning a nazarite: ""and he [the priest] shall make an atonement for him, for his having sinned regarding [his] soul."" <sup class=""footnote-marker"">6</sup><i class=""footnote"">A nazarite is forbidden to become impure through any contact with a dead body for the extent of his nazarite vow. If he contracts such impurity, he is required to bring a special sin offering. See Numbers, Chapter 6, <i>Hilchot Nezirut</i>, Chapters 6-8.</i> Our sages declared: <sup class=""footnote-marker"">7</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Ta'anit</i> 11a. [Interestingly, the author of this statement, Rabbi Eliezer HaKfar, is also the author of the statement (<i>Avot</i>, <i>ibid.</i>) that ""envy, desire, and the pursuit of honor, drive a person from the world.""]</i> If the nazarite who abstained only from wine requires atonement, how much more so does one who abstains from everything.<br>Therefore, our Sages directed man to abstain only from those things which the Torah denies him and not to forbid himself permitted things by vows and oaths <sup class=""footnote-marker"">9</sup><i class=""footnote"">One should not conclude that the Rambam completely disapproves of vows and oaths. At the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> (13:23), the Rambam states: ""Whoever takes a vow in order to stabilize his temperaments and correct his deeds, is zealous and praiseworthy.""<br>In <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i>, he gives examples of people who were excessively inclined to a particular quality who take vows to correct their faults (in a manner reminiscent of his advice in the beginning of Chapter 2 of these halachot). Rather, what the Rambam criticizes in our halachah is abstention for the sake of abstention.</i> [of abstention]. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">10</sup><i class=""footnote"">Note the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Kiddushin</i> 4:12:<br>Rav Chizkiyah the priest said in the name of Rav: ""A person will ultimately be called to judgment for everything which his eye saw and which he did not taste.""Rav Lazar was concerned because of this teaching.

He quotes the prophet, Zechariah, who questions the motives of the Jews' fasts (7:5): ""Was it for Me that you fasted?"" and exhorts them to ""Practice true justice, and show kindness and mercy every man to his brother"" as the proper service of God. To underscore this point, he concludes with the prophecy (<i>ibid.</i> 8:19) that even the public fasts will ultimately be transformed into festivals and days of rejoicing.</i> general statement also refers to those who fast constantly. They are not following a good path, [for] our Sages <sup class=""footnote-marker"">13</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Ta'anit</i> 11a</i> have forbidden a man to mortify himself by fasting. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">14</sup><i class=""footnote"">The phrase ""to mortify himself"" is significant here. The Rambam (<i>Hilchot Ta'anit</i> 1:4; 1:9) himself mentions that the Sages commanded both the community and the individual to fast in times of distress.<br>The Rambam's statements have been questioned by the Rashba (Responsa 431 and 688) and by the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> based on <i>Nedarim</i> 10a. However, the commentaries note that Shmuel, the author of the statement in <i>Ta'anit</i>, also states (<i>Bava Kama</i> 91a) that one may fast. Here, the Rambam's statements are directed against self- mortification and asceticism and not against fasting per se.<br>Nevertheless, it must be noted that in <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i>, when the Rambam describes ""the paths of Teshuvah"" (3:4), he makes no mention of fasting.</i> Of all the above, and their like, Solomon directed and said: ""Do not be overly righteous and do not be overly clever; why make yourself desolate?"" (Ecclesiastes <sup class=""footnote-marker"">15</sup><i class=""footnote"">The midrashic works have not interpreted this verse in the manner suggested here. However, we find other Spanish Jewish Sages who followed this interpretation. See Duties of the Heart 3:25, Ibn Ezra in his commentary to Ecclesiastes.<br>Note that this verse uses the two terms - the righteous (<i>tzadik</i> and the wise (<i>chacham</i>) - which the Rambam has used to designate the man with a ideal traits.<br>The placement of this halachah raises questions. One might have expected it to appear in the previous chapter which deals with other excesses and deviations from the middle path. However, it is possible to explain that, in its present position, it serves as a preface to the following halachot which explain how our service of God and connection to Him can be established within the context of our material reality. Thus, when viewed as a totality, this chapter emphasizes how Judaism desires that religious fulfillment be found within the context of our day to day life, rather than in otherworldly ""spiritual"" activities.</i> 7:16 .",8,,"If the nazarite who abstained only from wine requires atonement, how much more so does one who abstains from everything."
Human Dispositions 3.3,"A person who accustoms himself to live by [the rules of] medicine does not follow a proper path if his sole intention is that his entire body and limbs be healthy <sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Rambam puts the maintenance of health mentioned in the previous halachah into proper perspective. It is not to be pursued as a goal in its own right. Rather, it should be appreciated as merely a means to enable one to reach an awareness of God. The Rambam develops this idea at length in <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> Chapter 5. There, he states:<br>A person should have the intention while eating, drinking, having intercourse, sleeping, awakening, moving, and resting, [that he does so] for the purpose of his physical health alone.His intention in [seeking] physical health should be to prepare for the soul healthy and sound vessels to acquire wisdom and intellectual and emotional advantages until he reaches the goal of [knowing God].</i> and that he have children who will do his work and toil for him. Rather, he should have the intent that his body be whole and strong, in order for his inner soul to be upright so that [it will be able] to know God. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">3</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Rambam also elaborates on the interrelation between the attainment of physical health and spiritual achievement in the Guide to the Perplexed, Vol. III, Chapter 27.<br>Heath is necessary as part of one's process of striving to know God...</i> For it is impossible to understand and become knowledgeable in the wisdoms when one is starving or sick, or when one of his limbs pains him. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">4</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Maggid of Mezeritch would say: ""A small hole in the body creates a large hole in the soul.""</i> [Similarly,] one should intend to have a son [with the hope that] perhaps he will be a wise and great man in <sup class=""footnote-marker"">5</sup><i class=""footnote"">This is the desired goal in procreation - to perpetuate the nation, not only physically, but also spiritually.<br>Thus, whoever walks in such a path all his days will be serving God constantly; even in the midst of his business dealings, even during intercourse for his intent in all matters is to fulfill his needs so that his body be whole to serve God. - In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam associates such behavior with Deuteronomy 6:5: ""Love God, your Lord, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might."" The course of action described enables us to dedicate every aspect of our being toward the love of God as prescribed by this verse.<br>Even when he sleeps, if he retires with the intention that his mind and body rest, lest he take ill and be unable to serve God because he is sick, then his sleep is service to the Omnipresent, blessed be He. - Perhaps, the Rambam uses this name for God to convey the concept that just as God's presence pervades all existence, our service of Him must encompass all aspects of our lives.<br>On this matter, our Sages - <i>Avot</i> 2:15</i> Israel.<br>Thus, whoever walks in such a path all his days will be serving God constantly; even in the midst of his business dealings, even during intercourse for his intent in all matters is to fulfill his needs so that his body be whole to serve God.<br>Even when he sleeps, if he retires with the intention that his mind and body rest, lest he take ill and be unable to serve God because he is sick, then his sleep is service to the Omnipresent, blessed be He.<br>On this matter, our Sages have directed and said: ""And all your deeds should be for the sake of Heaven."" <sup class=""footnote-marker"">6</sup><i class=""footnote"">In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam elaborates upon this statement as follows:<br>Our Sages included this entire concept in the most succinct expression possible... When one meditates on this concise statement, one wonders how they could describe in its entirety an idea so awesome that many books were written about it without encompassing it totally. Without a doubt, [the statement] was made with Divine inspiration.<br>The commentaries note that <i>Beitzah</i> 16a stated concerning Hillel: ""All of his deeds were for the sake of Heaven,"" and associates that with the following narrative in <i>VaYikra Rabbah</i> 34:3.<br>Hillel bid his students farewell. They asked him where he was going He told them that he was going to perform a mitzvah. They discovered that he was going to the bathhouse and asked him to explain his previous statements.

Note also the Rambam's comments in <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, <i>ibid.</i><br><i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. III, notes that the rules of Torah scholarship would have called for the quotation of the Biblical verse before the quote from our Sages. However, the Rambam chooses this sequence because it reflects a progression in the service of God.<br>""All of your deeds should be for the Sake of Heaven"" implies that the deeds are not themselves holy, merely that they are directed toward a Godly intent. ""Know Him in all your ways"" implies that a bond with God can be established within the context of our physical activity itself.</i> and He will straighten your paths"" (Proverbs <sup class=""footnote-marker"">8</sup><i class=""footnote"">In <i>Iggerot HaKodesh</i>, the Ramban interprets the state described in this clause as a natural product of the elevated rung of service mentioned in the previous clause.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.2","In the Temple, <sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">As will be explained in the commentary to Chapter 2, Halachah 8, and Chapter 7, Halachah 13, in certain contexts the Rambam interprets the expression במקדש - literally, ""in the holy place"" - as referring to the entire city of Jerusalem. (See also the Rambam's commentary to the mishnah, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 4:1.) However, in the present context, it refers to the Temple alone. Thus, <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 27a states that the shofar was sounded in this manner only ""on the Temple Mount and at the eastern gate.""</i> on Rosh HaShanah, they would blow [the shofar in the following manner]: There was one shofar and two trumpets, [one on either] side. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">2</sup><i class=""footnote"">The verse from Psalms mentions ""the voice of the shofar,"" using the singular.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.3","At the outset, we should not blow a shofar of idol worship. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">For it is not appropriate to use such a shofar for a mitzvah.</i> However, if one sounded it, one has fulfilled his obligation. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">2</sup><i class=""footnote"">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that this refers to a shofar belonging to a gentile that was used in the worship of idols, or a shofar which was itself worshiped as an idol. However, as will be explained, if the shofar of idol worship belonged to a Jew or if it was made from the horn of an animal that was sacrificed to an idol, even after the fact, its use is not acceptable.</i> <sup class=""footnote-marker"">4</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 28a explains that the difference between a shofar of idol worship and one of an apostate city is that all the property within the latter must be destroyed. Since ultimately this shofar must be burnt, even before it is actually destroyed it is no longer considered to be an existent entity. Thus, we may not use it on Rosh HaShanah, because a shofar used for the mitzvah must be of a specific size - slightly larger than one's hand, as mentioned in Halachah 5 - and a nonexistent entity has no size at all.<br>A shofar of idol worship must also be destroyed. However, should the gentile negate its connection to idol worship before it is acquired by a Jew, it need not be destroyed, as stated in <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 8:8. Since there is a possibility that it will not have to be destroyed, it is considered to be an existent entity and may be used for the mitzvah.<br>This principle applies only to aspects of idol worship belonging to a gentile. It is impossible to negate the connection between an idol worshiped by a Jew and its forbidden nature. (See <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 8:9.) Hence, a Jew's shofar of idol worship may not be used. Similarly, if a Jew has acquired a shofar of idol worship that belonged to a gentile before the latter negated its connection to idol worship, the Jew is no longer capable of negating this connection. Therefore, such a shofar may not be used on Rosh HaShanah.<br>Also, once an animal has been sacrificed to an idol, there is no possibility of negating its connection to idol worship. Hence, its horn may not be used as a shofar.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 586:3-4) quotes all the above laws as halachah. The Ramah relates that certain authorities recommend not using even a gentile's shofar of idol worship unless we know that he negated its connection with idol worship before Rosh HaShanah begins.</i> [In contrast,] should one sound a shofar belonging to an apostate city, one has not fulfilled one's obligation.<br>Concerning a stolen shofar: <sup class=""footnote-marker"">5</sup><i class=""footnote"">one who blows it fulfills his obligation - Though in general, a mitzvah performed with a stolen article is not acceptable (see Chapter 8, Halachah 1; <i>Hilchot Chametz U'Matzah</i> 6:7), this case is an exception...</i> one who blows it fulfills his obligation, because the mitzvah is only to listen to the sound, <sup class=""footnote-marker"">6</sup><i class=""footnote"">Hence, a person who listens to the shofar being blown fulfills his obligation</i> even though the listener does not touch [the shofar] <sup class=""footnote-marker"">7</sup><i class=""footnote"">Based on this statement, the commentaries propose that, according to the Rambam, a person who blows a shofar without putting his lips to it fulfills his obligation.

Rabbenu Manoach and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cite other examples from <i>Nedarim</i> 13b-15a, where the Sages differentiate between sound and material entities.<br>The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 3:1) derives this law as follows:Everyone agrees that a stolen lulav is unacceptable. What is the difference between a shofar and a lulav?<br>Rabbi Yosse responded: ""Concerning a lulav, [Leviticus 23:40] states: 'You shall take for yourself,' implying that only 'your own' is acceptable. In contrast, [Numbers 29:1] states: 'It shall be a day of blowing for you,' implying that regardless [of the nature of the shofar used, the blowing shall be 'for you']"".<br>Rabbi Eliezer explained: ""There, [concerning the lulav,] one must perform the mitzvah with the lulav itself. Here, [concerning the shofar,] one performs the mitzvah with its sound.""Nevertheless, because a sin is associated with this mitzvah, Ashkenazic custom is that no blessing should be recited before blowing such a shofar (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 586:4).</i> alone.<br>Similarly, a shofar from an <sup class=""footnote-marker"">10</sup><i class=""footnote"">animal consecrated as an...</i> <i>olah</i> offering should not be sounded, <sup class=""footnote-marker"">11</sup><i class=""footnote"">Once an animal is consecrated as an <i>olah</i> offering, no part of its body may be used any other purpose. Therefore, we should not use such a shofar from such an animal for any purpose whatsoever.<br>This halachah applies before the blood from the sacrifice has been offered on the altar.

If you ask: ""Behold, he has derived benefit from hearing [the shofar's] sound?"" <sup class=""footnote-marker"">15</sup><i class=""footnote"">Though the laws of מעילה do not apply to sound, there is still a Rabbinic prohibition against benefiting from the sound of consecrated articles.

Accordingly, the Rambam explains:</i> - mitzvot were not given for our benefit.<br>Based <sup class=""footnote-marker"">16</sup><i class=""footnote"">Rashi (<i>Rosh Hashanah</i>, ibid.) states: ""the mitzvot were not given to the Jewish people for their enjoyment, but rather as a yoke.""<br>This concept has relevance in the ethical, as well as the halachic sphere. In the tenth chapter of <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i>, the Rambam writes:One who serves [God] out of love occupies himself with the Torah and the mitzvot...for no ulterior motive, not because of fear that evil will occur, nor in order to acquire benefit...<br>The great Sages would command the more understanding and brilliant among their students in private: ""Do not be like servants who serve their master for the sake of receiving a gift. Rather, since he is the Master, it is fitting to serve Him""; i.e., serve [Him] out of love.The above is not intended to imply that a person should not feel happy and fulfilled in the service of God. Quite the contrary; indeed, the Rambam concludes these halachot (Chapter 8, Halachah 15) with a description of the importance of happiness in the service of God. However, the intent is that the happiness should be a byproduct and not the goal of the service. We should be totally committed to fulfilling God's will, and the expression of that commitment should generate satisfaction and joy.<br><b>Based on this concept -</b> that mitzvot were not given for our benefit;<br><b>a person who vows not to derive benefit from a shofar may use it to blow the teki'ot required to fulfill the mitzvah. -</b> Doing so is not considered a violation of his vow.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 586:5) advises that the person who took the vow should not blow the shofar himself [because many consider that to be a pleasurable experience (<i>Taz</i>)].

Reading the Shema 1.9,"When is the [proper] time for the recitation of Shema at night? The commandment [starts] from the time of the appearance of the stars...<br>A <sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 2a) states that the time for the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> begins at the hour when a priest who has become ritually impure may immerse in a <i>mikveh</i> and resume eating <i>terumah</i>. The Talmud explains that this is the time when the stars appear.<br><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 2a) holds that the <i>Shema</i> may be recited earlier, during the last hour before sunset. This is based on the understanding that Rabbi Yehudah, who disagrees with the majority opinion regarding the proper time for the afternoon prayer, also disagrees about the proper time for the evening prayer and <i>Kri'at Shema</i> contained therein. (See <i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 235.) This will be discussed at length in <i>Hilchot Tefilah</i> 3:6.<br>There are several different positions regarding the precise definition of צאת הכוכבים (the appearance of the stars). It generally refers to the appearance of three medium-sized stars. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 235:1 requires the sighting of three small stars before reciting <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> explains that the basic halachah is indeed that three medium sized stars constitute the time of צאת הכוכבים, but that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> obligated one to wait for smaller stars in order to diminish the possibility of error regarding the recitation of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night.<br>There are three basic positions regarding the actual time of צאת הכוכבים (the appearance of the stars). <i>Shabbat</i> 34b determines that it refers to the time that it takes one to walk 3/4 of a <i>mil</i> after sunset.<br>The other two positions are found in <i>Pesachim</i> 94a: one defines צאת הכוכבים as the amount of time needed to walk four <i>mil</i> after sunset, and the other, as the time necessary to walk five <i>mil</i>.<br>There are two different methods of determining the time it takes to walk a <i>mil</i>. The Rambam, Commentary to the mishnah, <i>Pesachim</i> 3:2, maintains that it takes 24 minutes to walk a <i>mil</i>. However, the most widely held opinion - and the opinion accepted regarding <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i> - is that the measure of time is 18 minutes.<br>Therefore, according to <i>Shabbat</i> 34b, the appearance of the stars is 13 1/2 (3/4 x 18) minutes after sunset. Both the Vilna Gaon and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> maintain that צאת הכוכבים is determined in this fashion. Thus, the proper local time may be calculated by extrapolation based on the amount of light visible 13 1/2 minutes after sunset in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> on the day of the Equinox. Generally, people wait up to 36 minutes after sunset in order to be certain.<br>According to <i>Pesachim</i> 94a, the appearance of the stars will be either 72 (4 x 18) minutes or 90 (5 x 18) minutes after sunset. <i>Rabbenu Tam</i> strongly suggests adhering to the position that צאת הכוכבים takes place 72 minutes after sunset. Though some authorities support the 90-minute position, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein (<i>Iggerot Moshe, Orach Chayim</i>, Vol. 1, Siman 24), mentions only the position of the <i>Vilna Gaon</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>, on the one hand, and <i>Rabbenu Tam</i> on the other.</i> person who transgresses and delays fulfills his obligation if he recites [the Shema] before dawn. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">3</sup><i class=""footnote"">In his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 1:1), the Rambam defines dawn (עלות השחר) as the light that radiates from the east before sunrise.<br>There are three major positions regarding this time. All are based on <i>Pesachim</i> 94a which defines the time from dawn until sunrise as that in which a person can walk either 4 <i>mil</i> (according to one opinion) or 5 <i>mil</i> (according to the other).<br>As mentioned above, there are two opinions regarding the measure of time it takes to walk a <i>mil</i>: 18 minutes or 24 minutes. Thus, Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi defines dawn as 120 (5 x 24) minutes before sunrise. The most widely held view is that it is 90 (5 x 18) minutes before sunrise, while the <i>Beit Yosef</i> holds that dawn is 72 (4 x 18) minutes before sunrise. This is the opinion of the Rambam, as stated in his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 1:1.)</i> [The Sages established the limit] of midnight only in order to distance us from negligent wrongdoing. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">4</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Berachot</i> 1:1 lists other instances where the Sages established similar guidelines, e.g., partaking of sacrificial meat, burning sacrificial limbs.</i>",2,[and continues] until midnight,"There are three positions recorded in the Mishnah in <i>Berachot</i> 2a regarding the time until which one may recite the <i>Shema</i> at night.<br>Rabbi Eliezer says until the end of the first of the three watches of the Temple - i.e., one third of the night, which is until approximately 9:30 pm. The Sages say until midnight, and Rabban Gamliel says until dawn. The Mishnah then explains that the Sages' opinion is, in effect, that one may recite the <i>Shema</i> until dawn, but that they mentioned midnight as a preferred time in order to distance people from transgression. This is the source of this halachah in the Rambam.<br>The <i>Rosh</i> and the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 235) hold that the halachah follows Rabban Gamliel's position, and that a priori (לכתחילה), a person may read the <i>Shema</i> at night until dawn. The Rambam sees the Sages' position as halachically valid, and therefore one may rely on Rabban Gamliel only after the fact (בדיעבד). The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 235:3 quotes the Rambam's position. (See also <i>Mishnah Berurah 235:34-35.)<br></i><br>A person who transgresses and delays - the Rabbinic decree that the <i>Shema</i> should be read before midnight."

The transfer of chametz and Pesach pots, dishes, and cutlery is carried out on Thursday night or Friday, and no chametz is cooked afterwards.

Otherwise, the meals are eaten as all the other meals of the Pesach holiday itself.<br>As mentioned, it is forbidden to eat chametz on the fourteenth of Nisan after the fourth hour of the day (usually around 9:20 AM).

However, even according to the Rambam, the obligation to destroy the chametz before the Sabbath is not a hard and fast rule. On the contrary, our halachah itself states that one is allowed to keep all the chametz he needs for the Sabbath meals. Rather, this can be seen as good advice, facilitating the destruction of chametz, which is much easier before the Sabbath than on that sacred day."

However, some note that Rashi (<i>Pesachim</i> 4b) does maintain that the prohibitions against owning chametz begin on the fourteenth, and they maintain that the Rambam shares this view (See Responsa, <i>Nodah BiYhudah, Orach Chayim</i> 20).</i> and discovers chametz <sup class=""footnote-marker"">2</sup><i class=""footnote""><i>Tosefot</i> (<i>Pesachim</i> 21a) states that a person does not violate the prohibition against possessing chametz unless he becomes conscious of the chametz in his possession.

In Halachah 3, the Rambam also mentions covering chametz with a utensil. However, in that instance, the person had already nullified his possession of the chametz, and thus his possession of chametz violated only a Rabbinic prohibition.<br>In contrast, this instance describes chametz that has not been nullified, and thus the violation of a Torah prohibition is involved. Nevertheless, the Rambam considers the Rabbinic prohibition against <i>mukzteh</i> as important enough to override the fulfillment of a Torah commandment. Furthermore, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that since the person himself desires to destroy the chametz, and the only reason he fails to do so is the Rabbinic commandment, he is not considered to have violated the Torah's prohibitions against possessing chametz.<br>This view is not accepted by all authorities. Many explain that since three Torah mitzvot (the two prohibitions against possessing chametz and the positive commandment to destroy chametz) are involved, their observance overrides the prohibitions of <i>muktzeh</i>. Others maintain that even if the prohibition against <i>muktzeh</i> must be observed, the chametz can be destroyed by burning it in the place where it is located.<br>Nevertheless, in practice, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 446:2), the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>, and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> do not accept the latter view, and advise waiting to destroy the chametz until after the holiday. They explain that a person is allowed to light a fire on a festival only if doing so increases his festive joy. Hence, they prohibit burning the chametz in that manner. However, they mention that, if it is possible, a gentile may be asked to destroy the chametz. Furthermore, in the diaspora, a Jew is also allowed to destroy chametz he finds on the second day of a festival.</i> [If the chametz] was consecrated property, <sup class=""footnote-marker"">8</sup><i class=""footnote"">consecrated for use in the Temple;</i> there is no need to cover it with a utensil, for regardless, everyone shies away from its use. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">9</sup><i class=""footnote"">Property consecrated for use in the Temple may never be used for mundane purposes.

Since ""kindling the lamp fulfills the mitzvah,"" the act of lighting the lamp is the essence of the mitzvah, and, therefore, using another Chanukah candle is not considered an act of disrespect. If, however, placing the Chanukah candles down constituted the mitzvah, the kindling of another candle would not be a direct fulfillment of a mitzvah. Therefore, it would not be proper to use another Chanukah lamp for that purpose (see Rashi, <i>Shabbat, loc. cit.</i>).<br>[Note, however, <i>Tosafot (Shabbat</i> 23a) and the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 674:1), which state that it is customary not to light one Chanukah candles from another.]<br>Among the questions also discussed with regard to this law is whether one must light the second candle from the first, or if it is acceptable if one lights a match from the first candle and uses it to light the second candle. To state the matter in terms of a question relevant to us: If the <i>shamash</i> is extinguished and one intends to use it to light other candles, may it be relit from a Chanukah candle which is already burning or not? Both opinions are mentioned in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 674:1).
