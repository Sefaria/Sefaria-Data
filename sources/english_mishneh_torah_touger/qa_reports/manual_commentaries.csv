Blessings 4.7,"A person who decides not to continue eating or drinking, <sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> cites <i>Pesachim</i> 103b, which states that once a person diverts his attention from drinking wine, he must recite another blessing when he begins drinking again.<br>The Ra'avad notes that the passage from <i>Pesachim</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions only drinking and does not discuss eating, and on that basis protests against the Rambam's equation of the two. From <i>Berachot</i> 42a, however, it appears that similar principles apply with regard to eating.</i> and afterwards changes his mind and [desires to] eat or drink, must recite another blessing <sup class=""footnote-marker"">2</sup><i class=""footnote"">efore partaking of the food or drink. He is not, however, required to recite a blessing after the first food or drink. Rather, he is required to recite only a single blessing after he completes eating.</i> although he has not changed his place. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">3</sup><i class=""footnote"">As mentioned in Halachot 3-5, a person who changes his place while eating must recite both a blessing after the food he has eaten previously and a blessing over the food he plans to eat in his new place.<br>Many authorities do not accept the Rambam's decision with regard to a meal that includes bread. When a person sits down to such a meal, he is considered to have fixed his attention on eating. People frequently become drawn into eating more than they originally intended at such meals. Thus, a person's decision not to continue eating is not considered final, since it is quite possible that he will change his mind and decide to eat again. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 179:1).<br>Based on these principles, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 179:1) rules that, although once a person has decided to cease eating or drinking a new blessing is generally required, when partaking of a meal it is not sufficient to make a mental decision, and a person must wash before grace to be considered to have ceased eating.</i> If he did not decide [to cease] eating or drinking and had in mind to continue - even if he <sup class=""footnote-marker"">4</sup><i class=""footnote"">emained in the place in which he ate originally, and</i> made an interruption for the entire day <sup class=""footnote-marker"">6</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Rambam's terminology appears to be a stylistic exaggeration. If a person waits long enough for the food he has eaten to digest, it would appear that he is required to recite another blessing before beginning to eat again (<i>Kin’at Eliyahu</i>).</i> - he is not required to recite a second blessing. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">7</sup><i class=""footnote"">efore partaking of more food or drink.</i>",5,did not decide [to cease] eating or drinking and had in mind to continue,eating at a later time

However, the <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> quotes the Rambam's son, Rav Avraham, as relating that his father would always recite Psalm 136 after the Hallel prayers, and then conclude with the blessing without drinking a fifth cup. Accordingly, the <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> concludes that although it is permissible to drink a fifth cup, it is not proper to do so.<br><i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XXVII, suggests a different interpretation of this halachah, noting that the Rambam does not mention that the fifth cup is drunk. A fifth cup is mixed and placed on the table, and the ""great Hallel"" is recited over it. However, that cup should not be drunk. Thus, the fifth cup is not included as one of the four. Rather, it is a separate and independent obligation.<br>The Vilna Gaon (see <i>Ta'amei HaMinhagim</i> 551) associates the fifth cup with the cup of Elijah. The Talmud concludes the discussion of many unresolved questions with the statement: תיקו. Literally, the term is a shortened form of the word תיקום, ""let it remain"". However, it is also interpreted as an acrostic for the expression תשבי יתרץ קושיות ואביעות - ""The Tishbite (Elijah) will answer all questions and difficulties.""<br>Since the requirement of the fifth cup remains an unresolved question, the fifth cup is left for Elijah in the hope that he will come soon and resolve this question as well.<br>The homiletic aspects of this comment notwithstanding, from a halachic perspective a differentiation must be made between the two. The fifth cup is of Talmudic origin and may be poured for each individual. In contrast, Elijah's cup is an Ashkenazic custom of later origin, and a single cup is used for the whole family. Indeed, they are mentioned by halachists in different chapters of the Shulchan Aruch: the fifth cup by the Ramah in Chapter 481 and Elijah's cup by the <i>Chok Ya'akov</i> in Chapter 480.</i> may complete the Hallel wherever one desires, even though it is not the place where one ate. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">16</sup><i class=""footnote"">A number of different halachic questions would arise should a person decide to leave the home in which he is holding the Seder from the <i>kiddush</i> until the conclusion of the grace after meals.

Accordingly, the <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> concludes that although it is permissible to drink a fifth cup, it is not proper to do so.<br><i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XXVII, suggests a different interpretation of this halachah, noting that the Rambam does not mention that the fifth cup is drunk. A fifth cup is mixed and placed on the table, and the ""great Hallel"" is recited over it. However, that cup should not be drunk. Thus, the fifth cup is not included as one of the four. Rather, it is a separate and independent obligation.<br>The Vilna Gaon (see <i>Ta'amei HaMinhagim</i> 551) associates the fifth cup with the cup of Elijah. The Talmud concludes the discussion of many unresolved questions with the statement: תיקו. Literally, the term is a shortened form of the word תיקום, ""let it remain"". However, it is also interpreted as an acrostic for the expression תשבי יתרץ קושיות ואביעות - ""The Tishbite (Elijah) will answer all questions and difficulties.""<br>Since the requirement of the fifth cup remains an unresolved question, the fifth cup is left for Elijah in the hope that he will come soon and resolve this question as well.<br>The homiletic aspects of this comment notwithstanding, from a halachic perspective a differentiation must be made between the two. The fifth cup is of Talmudic origin and may be poured for each individual. In contrast, Elijah's cup is an Ashkenazic custom of later origin, and a single cup is used for the whole family. Indeed, they are mentioned by halachists in different chapters of the Shulchan Aruch: the fifth cup by the Ramah in Chapter 481 and Elijah's cup by the <i>Chok Ya'akov</i> in Chapter 480.</i> may complete the Hallel wherever one desires, even though it is not the place where one ate. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">16</sup><i class=""footnote"">A number of different halachic questions would arise should a person decide to leave the home in which he is holding the Seder from the <i>kiddush</i> until the conclusion of the grace after meals.

Though in <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> (The Guide to the Perplexed) 2:40 the Rambam himself elaborates upon that idea, it can be said that here his intent is different. He is emphasizing the degree to which each individual's personality is a combination of different traits, which may be unrelated and even distant from each other.

Similarly, he should not desire <sup class=""footnote-marker"">10</sup><i class=""footnote"">This refers to physical desire.</i> anything other than that which the body needs and cannot exist without, as [Proverbs 13:25] states: <sup class=""footnote-marker"">11</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Rambam quotes supporting verses for only two of the ""intermediate traits;"" perhaps, because his description of the middle-of-the-road position for these traits might appear to veer toward one extreme. We might expect the intermediate point between gluttony and its opposite extreme to be eating to one's satisfaction. However, here we are told that we should desire only what is sufficient in order to exist.<br>However, the Rambam is not telling us to deny ourselves satisfaction. Deuteronomy 8:10 teaches: ""You shall eat and be satisfied, and bless God, your Lord."" Based on that verse, <i>Berachot</i> 48b explains that we are obligated to recite grace only when we feel physically satisfied. (The Rambam quotes this concept in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 1:1.) In Chapter 3, Halachah 1, and in <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, he elaborates on the negative aspects of asceticism.<br>Thus, his intent cannot be that we deny our desires, but rather that we school ourselves to desire and feel satisfied with what we need, without excess.

The commentaries note that the contrast between the two does not center on the quantity of food they eat, but on the attitude with which they eat it. Because the righteous are not given over to pursuit of gratification, they can be satisfied. Conversely, it is the gluttony of the wicked which actually causes their want.<br>Note also the Midrashic interpretations of this verse:<br>""The righteous..."" This refers to Eliezer, who said to Rebecca: ""Let me sip a little water"" (Genesis 24:17  - a single sip.""And the belly of the wicked will want."" This refers to Esau, who said to Jacob: ""Stuff me..."" (Genesis 25:30 . Rabbi Yitzchak ben Zeira said: he opened his mouth agape like a camel and said: ""I will open my mouth and you put it in"" (<i>Tanchumah; Pinchas</i> 13; <i>BaMidbar Rabbah</i> 21:18).</i> he shall not labor in his business except to gain what he needs for immediate use, as [Psalms 37:16] states: <sup class=""footnote-marker"">13</sup><i class=""footnote"">Here again, the Rambam quotes a Biblical verse, because his definition of an intermediate path may seem extreme. The verse also clarifies that the Rambam is not denigrating the idea of work, but excessive preoccupation with one's profession as a means of acquiring possessions.<br>It is highly unlikely that the Rambam would criticize work per se. Note Proverbs 6:6: ""Sluggard, go to the ant, see its ways and become wise;"" and <i>Berachot</i> 8a:<br>He who enjoys the toil of his hands is greater than one who fears God..., as it is stated: ""If you eat of the work of you hands, you are fortunate and will possess the good"" (Psalms 128:2 .""You are fortunate"" - in this life, and ""will possess the good"" - in the world to come.<br>The Rambam, himself, quotes the latter passage in <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 3:11. Thus, the Rambam is not criticizing a person for working hard, but rather teaching us that work and its profits should not be our greatest priorities.</i> ""A little is good for the righteous man.""<br>He <sup class=""footnote-marker"">14</sup><i class=""footnote"">The verse in its entirety expresses a contrast: ""A little is better for the righteous man than the great wealth that many [of the] wicked possess.""

However, most manuscripts use the term: <i>yikabetz</i> (gather).<br><i>Yikfotz</i> recalls Deuteronomy 15:7: ""Do not close your hand from your needy brother."" Thus, the contrasting extreme would be freehandedness. <i>Yikabetz</i>, like <i>vikubatz</i> in Halachah 1, reflects miserly behavior, the opposite of which is being a spendthrift. The variant texts might reflect a difference of opinion as to which opposing extremes the Rambam had in mind.</i> nor spread his money about, but he should give charity according to his capacity <sup class=""footnote-marker"">16</sup><i class=""footnote"">See <i>Hilchot Arachin</i> 8:12-13, which places restrictions on the extent of one's generosity.<br><b>and lend to the needy as is fitting -</b> Lending is also a form of charity.

A person is obligated to accustom himself to these paths and [to try to] resemble Him to the extent of his ability.",8,Sometimes he will be merciful and generous to some people,"not because of his feelings and natural compassion, but because they are deserving of such treatment.Sometimes he will bear a grudge, seek revenge, and rage against certain people - not out of feelings of anger... - but in order to produce positive results....The ultimate ideal man can achieve is to imitate God according to his potential... i.e., to have our deeds resemble His deeds.For this reason, human behavior should not be motivated by the spontaneous expression of emotion. Rather, man's emotions should arise as the result of a deliberate process of thought.<br>This reflects themes brought out in the previous halachot of this chapter: that a person must constantly evaluate and review his emotions (Halachah 4); that it is a wise man who is able to appreciate the middle path (Halachah 5).<br>This is what is meant by the imitation of God: that a person not be controlled by the unchecked expression of his emotions. Rather, he should control his feelings and, motivated by his desire to resemble God, search to find the correct and proper quality, the middle path, appropriate to the situation at hand.<br>to the extent of his ability. - for man is ultimately finite in nature, and no true resemblance to God is possible."

Also, the Rambam's phraseology here implies that one is held liable regardless whether the craftsman is a Jew or gentile, and a gentile is never given the halachic status of an agent.<br>The following are among the resolutions offered to this difficulty:a) A hired worker's actions - whether positive or negative - are always attributed to his employer (<i>Machaneh Efrayim, Hilchot Shutafim</i> 8).b) The verse prohibiting this act reveals that this is one of the few exceptions to the general rule mentioned above, and in this case, the person who commissioned the agent is held liable (<i>Darchei HaMelech</i>).c) Commenting on <i>Hilchot Sechirut</i> 13:2, the <i>Mishneh LaMelech</i> explains that if it is possible to violate a particular prohibition by committing a deed, one is punished by lashes even when one violates it without committing a deed.

Were these images forbidden, it would be unlikely that Moshe would have told the tribe to depict them. Even if the decree was instituted in the later generations, it is not probable that the Rabbis would forbid images that had previously been used for a Torah purpose.<br>The Ramah (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 141:3) quotes the Rambam's opinion. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 141:13 and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 141:8, however, note that the Rambam's statements which were quoted above (and the Ramah's statements) refer to a question whether one is allowed to keep images of the sun or moon that he finds. Here, the question is whether one is allowed to make such images oneself. From the discussion of the question in <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 43b, where the Sages question how Rabban Gamliel possessed forms of the moon, it would appear that there is a prohibition against making images of the sun and the moon themselves.<br>This interpretation, however, is also somewhat problematic, because the Rambam writes that there is no prohibition against making images of animals, and some of the constellations of the Zodiac are represented and referred to as animals. For example, one of the Zodiac constellations is a fish and <i>Gittin</i> 36a describes Rav as making a drawing of a fish. Another is a lion, which is one of the most popular images found in Jewish art.</i> or the angels, <sup class=""footnote-marker"">7</sup><i class=""footnote"">As the Rambam writes in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 2:3-5, the angels have no body or form.

Alternatively, it could refer to the metaphoric imagery used by the prophets.</i> as [implied by Exodus, ibid.]: ""Do not make with Me [gods of silver...]"" <sup class=""footnote-marker"">8</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Rambam (quoting <i>Avodah Zarah</i>, ibid.) mentions the above Biblical proof-text in connection with this prohibition. It would appear, however, from the fact that making such images is not punishable by lashes, that the prohibition is only Rabbinic in nature. The reference to the verse must be understood as an <i>asmachta</i> (use of the Biblical verse as a support for a Rabbinic decree).</i> - i.e., do not make images of <sup class=""footnote-marker"">9</sup><i class=""footnote"">those who are ""with Me"" - i.e.,</i> My servants, those who serve before Me on high. This [prohibition] <sup class=""footnote-marker"">11</sup><i class=""footnote"">is more severe than the prohibition against making human images, and</i> applies even [to pictures] on tablets.<br>The <sup class=""footnote-marker"">12</sup><i class=""footnote"">According to the Rambam's statements in his Commentary on the Mishnah, the difference between the prohibition against making these images and those of humans can be explained as follows: The prohibition against making human statues is Biblical in origin and is defined by the Torah itself. In contrast, the prohibition of making images of the celestial beings was a safeguard instituted by the Rabbis against Greek and Roman culture. It, therefore, applies to all images, whether pictures or statues, because both could influence people to stray from the Torah's ways.<br>According to the simple interpretation of the terms ""sun"" and ""moon,"" the difference can be explained as follows: The sun and the moon, as we perceive them, appear against the background of the sky. Therefore, for a representation of them to be forbidden, it also need not protrude (<i>Tosafot, 14Avodah Zarah</i>, ibid.).</i> images of animals and other living beings <sup class=""footnote-marker"">13</sup><i class=""footnote"">with the exception of men - <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 42b also mentions a prohibition against making the image of a <i>d'rakon</i> which Rashi and others interpret as an animal similar to a serpent.</i> - with the exception of men - and similarly, the images of trees, grasses, and the like may be fashioned. This <sup class=""footnote-marker"">15</sup><i class=""footnote"">leniency</i> applies even to images which protrude. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">16</sup><i class=""footnote"">From these two halachot, particularly according to the Rambam's understanding as reflected in his Commentary on the Mishnah, we see that there is no conflict between Torah law and aesthetics. There are only two restrictions: realistic human statues (and according to some authorities, these must be complete, full-bodied statues) and depictions of pagan gods. Even according to the other opinions which forbid depictions of the sun, the moon, and the like, there is no prohibition against abstract portrayals of these entities. No other restrictions apply at all.<br>There is definitely a divergence between the approach to life that spawned much of the art forms of Western culture and a Torah lifestyle. Perhaps for that reason, many religious Jews have traditionally shunned participation in and patronage of the arts. In the present generation, however, a number of our Torah leaders have urged religious artists to dedicate themselves to expressing Torah ideas and values in a variety of art forms, explaining that:a) Through these media, it is possible to reach many Jews who might never enter a synagogue or Torah center;b) Everything in the world was created to be used by the Jews for a Torah purpose (Rashi, Genesis 1:1 . This also applies to art. Using these art forms for Torah purposes expresses the true intent for their creation and endows them with a depth of meaning and inspiration - and in its deepest sense, a new wellspring of creativity.<br>According to Kabbalah, God's presence is more manifest in the <i>sefirah</i> of <i>Tiferet</i> (""Beauty"") than in any other <i>sefirah</i>.

In <i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i> 6:1-2, the Rambam describes the <i>ma'amadot</i> as follows:<br>The early prophets ordained that honest people who fear sin should be chosen to stand over the sacrifices.

Many explain that since, as explained in the commentary to that halachah, the Torah includes a special verse to teach us that a borrowed sukkah is permitted, the scope of the exclusion implied by ""for yourself"" is limited.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 637:3 explains that since the person owning the sukkah grants his colleague the use of it, the borrowed sukkah can be considered ""as his own."" Since a person has to treat a sukkah as his permanent dwelling for the seven days of the holiday, it follows that the sukkah was lent for that purpose. Thus, while a person is using it, he may consider it ""as his own,"" i.e., just like his own dwelling. See <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 19."

Though that verse is mentioned with regard to Sukkot, Deuteronomy 16:11 states with regard to Shavuot: ""and you shall rejoice before God,"" and <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 4b explains that an analogy is established to include Pesach as well.</i> there was an additional celebration in the Temple on the festival of Sukkot, <sup class=""footnote-marker"">2</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Rambam's words present a question: The Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 5:1) refers to this celebration as <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i>, connecting it with the drawing of water for the water libation. (See <i>Hilchot T'midim Umusafim</i> 10:6-10.) Indeed, the Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 50b; see also the Rambam's commentary on the above-mentioned Mishnah) emphasizes that connection, quoting Isaiah 12:3: ""And you shall draw water with happiness."" However, here, the Rambam makes no mention of that water at all!<br>We are forced to say that the Rambam views the verse from Isaiah as a mere <i>asmachtah</i> (an allusion from the Bible with which our Sages connected a verse to an independent concept) and that the celebration came about because of the unique nature of the Sukkot festival. Though this celebration was associated with the water libation, the latter is not the source for the practice. Indeed, the choice of the name <i>Simchat Beit HaSho'evah</i> (the celebration of the house of drawing the water), and not <i>Simchat Hasho'evah</i> (the celebration of the drawing of the water) allows for such an interpretation.

Thus, in <i>Sefer Hamitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 54), the Rambam describes that mitzvah and explains that it includes ""to celebrate with musical instruments and to dance in the Temple....This is <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i>.""<br>This explanation resolves another question: <i>Mo'ed Kattan</i> 8b teaches that one celebration should not be interposed upon another. For this reason, weddings are not held during the festivals so that the wedding celebrations should not clash with those of the festival.<br>Thus, were one to consider the celebration of <i>Simchat Beit Hasho'evah</i> as associated with the water offering, one might ask why the Sages instituted such a celebration which might appear to overshadow the celebration of the festival itself.

Throughout these halachot, the Rambam makes no mention of whether the owner of the house previously nullified his chametz or not. This fact is extremely important, for different principles apply to an obligation required by Torah law from those that apply to one instituted by the Rabbis. Indeed, other Rabbinic authorities (some of whom are quoted in the commentaries to the various halachot) devote much attention to this issue, clarifying at length whether the laws apply:a) only when a person had already nullified (or can still nullify) his chametz, or;<br>b) even when the search for chametz is required by Torah law.Since the Rambam does not explicitly state his opinion on this matter, it is impossible to be sure which perspective he adopts. However, when the chapter is considered in its entirety, it appears that these halachot describe a situation where chametz has already been nullified. Unless specified to the contrary, this should be assumed to be the case.

There is no need to suspect that perhaps a rodent took chametz from a place where chametz is usually kept to a place where it is not usually brought. The Kessef Mishneh emphasizes that the two interpretations are not contradictory and both are halachically applicable."

Since, at night they are also involved with thinking about how to fulfill the mitzvah, they are still considered as occupied with the performance of a mitzvah and are not required to seek out a sukkah. An example of this principle quoted by the Talmud supports this interpretation:When Rav Chisda and Rabbah bar Rav Huna would attend [the lecture delivered] at the home of the exilarch on the Sabbath of the festival, they would sleep along the river banks of Sura.<br>They explained: ""We are emissaries involved in a mitzvah"" (<i>Sukkah</i> 26a).Though these Sages were visiting a city which served as a center of Jewish life and surely could have found a sukkah to lodge in, they did not see the necessity for doing so. (See also <i>Sukkah</i> 10b.)<br>Nevertheless, <i>Tosafot, Sukkah</i> 10b, interprets the passage differently and explains that leniency is granted these emissaries only when dwelling in the sukkah would in some way prevent them from carrying out the mitzvah which they set out to perform. If it is possible to do both - perform the mitzvah they set out to do and fulfill the mitzvah of sukkah - one must endeavor to do so.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam shares Rashi's view. However, the final halachic position followed by most Ashkenazic authorities is closer to <i>Tosafot</i>'s position: i.e., these emissaries are not obligated to trouble themselves to find a sukkah. However, if there is a sukkah available, they should make use of it. Nevertheless, if sleeping in the sukkah would prevent them from getting proper rest, and thus hold them back from fulfilling their mitzvah in a proper manner, they are not required to sleep in a sukkah (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 640:18; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 640:38).<br>(Abstractly, it is possible to differentiate between the two positions as follows.

Based on that decision, many commentaries explain that the Rambam's statements refer only to intensive study of the subject matter described as <i>Gemara</i> in the previous halachot.</i> because most women <sup class=""footnote-marker"">5</sup><i class=""footnote"">Commentaries have mentioned that by adding the word ""most,"" the Rambam implies that if a father sees that his daughter is capable of such study, he should afford her the opportunity.</i> cannot concentrate their attention on study, and thus transform the words of Torah into idle matters because of their lack of understanding.<br>[Thus,] <sup class=""footnote-marker"">6</sup><i class=""footnote"">i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> notes the contrast between the first clause, ""A woman who studies,"" and the command the Sages gave ""a father.""

(See <i>Taz</i> 246:4.)<br>In this context, it might be noted that the <i>Tur's</i> text of the Rambam reverses these statements and mentioned teaching women the Oral Law as preferable to the Written Law. This can easily be reconciled with the opinions mentioned above, which require a woman to learn the laws governing the mitzvot she is obligated to fulfill. In contrast, the Written Law is a less closely defined field of study. There, a greater possibility exists that a woman who is not gifted may misinterpret the teachings.</i>",3,,"Chassidic thought explains the concept differently.

One of the explanations offered by the Talmud for his behavior is that there was a stone floor in front of Rav, but not in front of the other congregants. The Talmud then asks: ""Why didn't Rav move to their place?"", obviously implying that one may offer this supplication in a place other than one's place of prayer."

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.9","A sukkah that was made for any purpose whatsoever <sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">even if it was not made for the purpose of [fulfilling] the mitzvah - if it was made according to law - <i>Sukkah</i> 8b quotes a <i>baraita</i> which contains the latter statement and questions: ""What does 'according to law' mean?...That it was made for the purpose of shade.""<br>It appears that the Rambam uses the same expression, but with different implications. Since he explicitly states that the sukkah must be constructed for the purpose of shade, one might infer that the expression ""according to law"" is intended to include other concepts. Thus, it can be a reference to the requirements for a sukkah's size and the nature of the materials used for the <i>s'chach</i>, as mentioned in this and the previous chapter.</i> - even if it was not made for the purpose of [fulfilling] the mitzvah - if it was made according to law, it is kosher. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">2</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 1:1, states:An old sukkah: The School of Shammai deems it unacceptable, while the School of Hillel rules it kosher.The commentaries explain that the term ""an old sukkah"" refers to any sukkah that was constructed for purposes other than the fulfillment of the mitzvah.<br>In its discussion of this law, the Jerusalem Talmud requires that one must make an addition or change to the <i>s'chach</i>. Though that decision is not quoted by the Rambam, Rabbenu Asher mentions it and it is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 636:1).

Deuteronomy 16:13 states: ""Make a [celebration of] the Sukkot holiday for seven days."" This refers to the construction of the sukkah and teaches that we must ""make"" a sukkah and not use what was already made. Therefore, despite the fact that the person hollowed out the space for the purpose of shade, the sukkah is not acceptable, because the produce was not originally placed there for that purpose.<br>We find a similar principle concerning <i>tzitzit</i>. Deuteronomy 22:12 states: ""Make yourself tassels on the four corners of your garments."" On the basis of this command, <i>Menachot</i> 40b teaches that it is unacceptable to tie <i>tzitzit</i> to a three-cornered garment and then cut a fourth corner, since we are required to make <i>tzitzit</i>, and not use what is already made.</i> because the produce was not piled there for this purpose. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">8</sup><i class=""footnote"">The <i>Ba'al Hamaor</i> writes that if, originally, a person were to pile produce with the intention that later he would hollow out a sukkah, the sukkah would be acceptable.

principle applies only with regard to <i>s'chach</i>, where it is logical to assume that a more lenient position would be taken, since the entire question revolves around a Rabbinic decree, or whether it also applies in all cases where Torah law itself requires a bundle.</i> Furthermore, even if one tied the tops of the branches from one side, and they thus appear to be a single bundle with one of its two ends bound naturally and the other bound as a result of human activity, it may be used as <i>s'chach</i>. A single tree which is bound up is not considered to be a bundle, but rather a single piece of wood, since [the branches] are bound together <sup class=""footnote-marker"">5</sup><i class=""footnote"">However, if one were to add even one branch and then tie them together, it would be considered to be a bundle (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 629:15).</i> naturally.<br>Similarly, any knot which is not strong enough to hold when carried is not considered a knot [and the resulting bundle may be used as <i>s'chach</i>]. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">6</sup><i class=""footnote"">i>Sukkah</i> 13b mentions this principle when explaining why bundles of willows whose upper tie was loosened could be used as <i>s'chach</i>.</i>",1,Small bundles,"The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> questions the reason for the addition of the adjective, noting that if the bundles contain fewer than twenty five units, they are permitted, as stated in the previous halachah. Others mention that this refers to bundles of small branches."
"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 5.12","A person who constructs his sukkah under a tree is considered as though he built it within his <sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">and the sukkah is unacceptable. This applies only when the shade the tree produces exceeds the open area. However, if there is more open space under the tree than shade, the sukkah may be kosher.<br>The determination of whether such a sukkah is kosher depends on a number of principles, based on the interpretation of <i>Sukkah</i> 9b and 11a. The Rambam's interpretation of that passage, and thus the ground rules he establishes, differ from those accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 626:1-2).<br>In the following halachah, the Rambam deals with the resolution of the question when no effort has been made to correct the problem of the non-kosher <i>s'chach</i>. As will be explained, there his interpretation is contested by other authorities. In this halachah, the Rambam describes the rulings which govern the situation when an effort has been made to rectify the situation by detaching the branches from their source of nurture. These are based on the Mishnah, <i>Sukkah</i> 11a, and are also accepted by other Rabbinic authorities. (See the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 626:2.)</i> home.<br>If one draped the leaves and branches of trees [over the sukkah], and then placed <i>s'chach</i> over them, and only afterwards detached them, <sup class=""footnote-marker"">2</sup><i class=""footnote"">As mentioned in Halachot 1 and 2, branches are fit to be used for <i>s'chach</i> only after they have been detached from their source of nurture.</i> [the following rules apply:]<br>If the amount of [kosher] <i>s'chach</i> exceeded [the branches], it is kosher. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">4</sup><i class=""footnote"">Though at present, the branches would be acceptable as <i>s'chach</i>, as explained in the commentary on Halachah 9, the Torah requires that when <i>s'chach</i> is originally put in place, it must be kosher. Otherwise, it is unacceptable even though steps were taken to correct the disqualifying factors. This is based on the principle that one must make a sukkah and not use one which is already made.<br>Nevertheless, since the prohibition against using these branches as <i>s'chach</i> does not relate to their essential nature, their presence may be nullified when there is a majority of kosher <i>s'chach</i>. This conforms to the principle of ביטול ברב.</i> If the amount of <i>s'chach</i> which originally was kosher did not exceed [the branches], <sup class=""footnote-marker"">5</sup><i class=""footnote"">the presence of the branches remains halachically significant.

One may fulfill his obligation for the third meal with other foods, without eating bread on the Sabbath, whereas on festivals one is not obligated to eat a third meal at all.<br>Accordingly, although there is a dimension of holiness connected with all the Sabbath and festival meals, the need to mention this dimension in grace is considered significant enough to require repetition of all the blessings only when an omission is made in the first two meals of the day.<br>It must be noted that neither the Rambam nor <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) make such a differentiation explicitly.

When a person omits <i>Ya'aleh v'yavo</i> in the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, he is required to repeat the entire <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. Nevertheless, if he is accustomed to recite prayers of supplication after <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> before withdrawing from his place of prayer, and remembers while in the midst of those supplications, he is not required to repeat <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. All that is necessary is to return to the blessing <i>R'tzey</i>.<br>Similarly, the Ra'avad argues, the blessing <i>Hatov v'hametiv</i> resembles the supplicatory prayers recited after <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. Accordingly, one should return to the third blessing of grace and not recite the other two.<br>This opinion, although respected for its sound reasoning, is not accepted by most authorities. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:6) and others quote the Rambam's view.</i>",5,"Blessed [are You, God...]","Our text follows the position of the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, who emphasizes that this blessing contains God's name and the phrase ""King of the universe,"" as do other blessings.

The Talmud mentions this [practice. However, this is because the Sages] were particularly holy. They would wash their hands [at night before sleep] and would be able to maintain a state [of purity] such that they could recite the blessings in the morning in cleanliness. We, however, are unable to maintain this state of cleanliness. Therefore, it is proper that we recite them only after נטילת ידים (the washing of the hands).<br>This position is widely accepted and is the basis of our practice today.

Furthermore, in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 1:5, the Rambam writes that, unless a blessing follows another blessing, it must mention God's sovereignty over the world and no such mention is made in this blessing.<br>The <i>Meiri</i> in his commentary to <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) offers the following resolution to these difficulties: Despite the fact that the entire period of a person's sleep divides between the recitation of <i>hamapil</i> and <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i>, the sleep is not considered as an interruption and <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i> is considered as following directly after <i>hamapil</i>. Accordingly, it is not required to begin with <i>Baruch</i> or mention God's sovereignty.<br>Other commentaries who follow different halachic perspectives than the Rambam offer these resolutions:1) <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i> is a blessing of praise and prayer and does not require an opening phrase of blessing, in the same way that the blessing recited before travelling does not (<i>Tosafot, Pesachim</i> 104b).2) <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i> is generally recited immediately after the blessing of אשר יצר and therefore can be considered as a blessing which follows another blessing."

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.10,"One who rises to study Torah, whether the Written or Oral Law, <sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">There is debate in the Talmud about this matter. Some Sages did not require the recitation of a blessing for the study of certain portions of the Oral Law (See <i>Berachot</i> 11b).

The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 47:2 explains the reason for this decision, ""They [all portions of the Oral Law] are all Torah and were given to Moses at Mount Sinai.""</i> before he recites the <i>Shema</i>, <sup class=""footnote-marker"">2</sup><i class=""footnote"">i>Berachot</i> 11b states:<br>Once one has recited the <i>Shema</i>, he need not recite a blessing [for Torah study] since he has fulfilled his obligation with <i>Ahavah Rabbah</i> (the second blessing before the <i>Shema</i>).<br>This blessing praises God for teaching our ancestors ""the laws that bring eternal life"" and includes our prayers that He ""grant our hearts understanding... to learn and to teach... all the teachings of Your Torah."" Therefore, <i>Ahavah Rabbah</i> is considered as comparableáto the blessings recited before Torah study (Rashi, <i>Berachot</i>, <i>ibid.</i>).<br>Rabbenu Asher quotes an opinion in the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 5:1) which states that the blessing of <i>Ahavah Rabbah</i> can replace the blessings before the study of the Torah only when one studies immediately after reciting the <i>Shema</i> and <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. The Ra'avad and the Rashba, however, maintain that the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> is also considered as Torah study. Therefore, if one recites the <i>Shema</i> after <i>Ahavah Rabbah</i>, one is considered to have fulfilled his obligation.<br>The Rambam appears to follow the latter opinion, however, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47:8) accepts Rabbenu Asher's view.<br>should wash his hands beforehand, - to fulfill the obligation of נטילת ידים upon rising in the morning.</i> should wash his hands beforehand, recite [the following] three blessings, and then study.<br>[These <sup class=""footnote-marker"">3</sup><i class=""footnote"">Both here and in Halachah 11, the Rambam states that one must study immediately after reciting these blessings.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>,:9) warns against making such an interruption.<br>[The comparison of the blessings before Torah study to the blessings of the mitzvot is not universally accepted. In addition to the opinion of the Ramban mentioned in the following halachah, the <i>Levush</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47) compares the blessings before Torah study to the blessings recited before partaking of food.

[The blessing is a request] that He open our hearts to the study of Torah, for this was the reason it was given to us as a heritage.However, to conclude [the blessing with] ""who teaches Torah..."" is incorrect, for God... does not teach us the Torah.

He explains that this is because this blessing is also often recited in isolation, before the reading of the Torah in the synagogue.<br>The recitation of the blessings of the Torah is very important. <i>Bava Metzia</i> 85a states that Eretz Yisrael was destroyed because the Jews forsook the Torah. Our Sages clarified that statement, explaining that it means that the people would study Torah without reciting the blessings before it. A person who studies Torah without reciting the blessings fails to realize its holiness and sanctity, therefore, it is considered as if he """"forsook the Torah.''</i>",5,And,"The presence here of the Hebrew letter <i>vav</i> (ו) which is generally translated as ""and"" is the subject of much discussion among the Rabbis.<br><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 46a) explains that, according to <i>Rabbenu Tam</i>, any blessing that follows another blessing of only a single line must itself begin ""Blessed are You..."" and cannot be included in the phrase ""Blessed are You..."" in the first blessing. Therefore, since this paragraph does not begin ""Blessed are You...,"" it appears to be a continuation of the first blessing and not a blessing of its own. The <i>vav</i> - ""and"" - indicates the connection between the two paragraphs.<br>The Rambam, however, clearly states that the second paragraph is considered as a blessing in its own right and not a continuation of the first blessing. The <i>vav</i> would, therefore, appear to be superfluous. Though most printed texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> include a <i>vav</i>, the authoritative Oxford manuscript of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Yemenite manuscripts, and the Ramah's text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> all lack a <i>vav</i>.

Human Dispositions 5.2,"When the wise man eats the little which is fitting for him, he should eat it only in his own home, at his table. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">The previous halachah discussed the quantity of food and the attitude with which it was to be eaten. The present halachah concerns itself with the place and the company in which the wise should eat. It revolves around the principle that a person should be modest while eating and refrain from doing so in public. (See the Guide to the Perplexed, ibid.)</i> He should not eat in a store <sup class=""footnote-marker"">2</sup><i class=""footnote"">i>Kol Ya'akov</i> notes that this store may even be one specifically designated for eating, e.g., a restaurant, coffee-shop, or the like. Indeed, we find the Hebrew, <i>chanut</i>, used to refer to a place of eating in <i>Bava Metzia</i> 83b.</i> or in the marketplace, <sup class=""footnote-marker"">3</sup><i class=""footnote"">Though the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Ma'aserot</i> 3:2 mentions this prohibition in reference to a Torah Sage, the Babylonian Talmud, <i>Kiddushin</i> 40b condemns even a common person for such behavior, stating: ""Whoever eats in the marketplace is like a dog."" The passage in <i>Kiddushin</i> continues to explain that such a person is unacceptable as a witness and the Rambam quotes that law (<i>Hilchot Edut</i> 11:5).<br>The commentaries have attempted to resolve this difficulty in different ways: For example <i>Tosafot, Kiddushin</i> (ibid.) explains that a common person is condemned only if he eats a full meal in the market place, while a wise man should not eat anything at all in public. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> (<i>Hilchot Edut</i>) differentiates between eating in a crowded place - which is forbidden for everyone - and eating in a quiet corner - which is deemed improper only for a Sage. The <i>Bach</i> (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 34) explains that a common person is censored only for eating while walking through the market place, while the wise man should not eat in public even while standing in one place.<br>Nevertheless, it must be noted that in this halachah, the Rambam uses the expression <i>chacham</i> (a wise man), his ideal for a person with a developed personality, and not <i>talmid chacham</i> (a Torah Sage).

Similarly, Leviticus 20:7, proclaims ""Sanctify yourselves and be holy, for I am God, your Lord,"" as a preface to the laws proscribing forbidden intimate relations. <i>Sh'vuot</i> 18b interprets the above verse as also including a command to conduct oneself in a holy manner within permitted relationships.<br>The quality of holiness involves not only restraint, as mentioned in the ensuing statements, but also the manner in which relations are carried out.

There is a question if this difference in sources creates a difference in law as well. See also the preface to <i>Eglei Tal,</i> which questions whether the definition of the categories of forbidden labor are taken from the activities necessary for the offering of the sacrifices in the Sanctuary, or merely the activities necessary for construction of the Sanctuary.

Numbers, ch. 15, relates that a person was executed for collecting wood on the Sabbath. As the Rambam states Chapter 21, Halachah 11, this labor includes only the collection of produce.

Shearing involves removing hair or wool from an animal, whether dead or alive. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 7.)<br><b>whitening -</b> After the wool is removed from the animal, it is washed to remove dirt. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 10.)<br><b>beating -</b> Unlike Rashi and others who interpret as combing the wool, in the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah he translates the word into an Arabic term meaning ""beat it with a stick."" This activity is necessary as a preliminary stage of the preparation of flax to be spun into linen. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 12.)<br><b>dyeing -</b> for most of the fabrics used in the curtains and roof-coverings of the Sanctuary were dyed.

In the weaving process, it refers to the following practice: Weaving involves passing the threads of the woof over and under each of the consecutive threads of the warp. In order to facilitate this process, two frames are made, each possessing many threads with a loop (referred to as a ""heddle"") in the middle of these threads. The threads of the warp are passed through these loops, one from one frame, and the next from the other, consecutively. When this is completed, the weaver lifts the two frames alternately. As he raises one up, he passes the woof through. In this manner, he is able to thread the woof through the entire warp at one time. (See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Shabbat</i> 7:2; <i>Keilim</i> 21:1.)<br><b>mounting the warp -</b> See Chapter 9, Halachah 17-18, where the Rambam describes how a loom is set up.

In contrast, when he lies with a person other than his wife, he must separate his body from that person's, lest the touching of their bodies distract him.It is interesting to note that there is a clear dispute between the great rabbis of Spain and North Africa (Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi, the Rambam and their disciples) and the great rabbis of Germany and France (<i>Tosafot</i>, Rabbenu Asher, and their disciples) concerning this halachah.<br>The Rabbis of France rule that even when sleeping in the same bed as one's wife one must make a separation with the sheet before reciting the <i>Shema</i>. Rabbi Yitzchak explains that the halachah is not according to either Shmuel or Rav Yosef and it is reasonable to be particularly strict based on a <i>beraitot</i> quoted in the <i>Berachot</i> 24a. In contrast, the Rabbis of Spain follow the Rambam's view.<br>Generally, in such instances, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> will rule in accordance with the Rabbis of Spain, and the Ramah with the Rabbis of France. In this instance, the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 73:2, after quoting both positions, suggests that it is fitting to follow the ruling of the Rabbis of France."

Therefore, he first mentions the halachot of <i>Havdalah</i> recited on a holiday and only, afterwards, mentions the halachot of <i>Havdalah</i> recited in the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> every Saturday night though seemingly, the latter would be given priority.</i>",4,[the following]:,This extra <i>Havdalah</i> prayer is added between the first and second paragraphs of the middle blessing.

And where does he say it? Between גואל לרופא - i.e., the blessing of redemption and that of healing!""Rav Yitzchak asked upon this position: ""Can an individual establish an extra blessing for himself?"" Rather, Rav Yitzchak is of the opinion that it should be inserted into the blessing of ""the One who hears prayer."" Rav Sheshet is also of this opinion.<br>Although the Talmud refers specifically to one who accepted a fast upon himself, it is clear from the continuation of the discussion there that the same halachah applies to the silent <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> recited by everyone on a public fast day also.<br>It is interesting to note that the Rambam obligates one to add עננו in all the prayers recited on a Fast Day. This is in line with <i>Shabbat</i> 24a which states: ""On fast days...in the Evening, Morning, and <i>Minchah</i> Prayers, one adds a mention of the particular day in 'the One who hears prayer.' However, the <i>Tur</i> quotes the Geonim that one should recite עננו only in the <i>Minchah</i> Prayer. Since one could be overcome by terrible hunger and break the fast, if one recited עננו earlier he would have spoken falsely when he mentioned the fast day. Therefore, according to this position, this prayer should be mentioned only in the <i>Minchah</i> service at the end of the fast days.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 565:3) quotes the <i>Tur's</i> position, but distinguishes between the four public fast days that occur every year (i.e., those mentioned above in our commentary) and other public fast days. On the four main public fasts, he obligates the individual to mention עננו in all his prayers. Since the Sages declared it a public fast, even were he to eat later on, he would not have spoken falsely in his prayer.<br>The Ramah ( <i>ibid.</i>), however, mentions that it is customary to recite עננו in <i>Minchah</i> only. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> explains that even one reciting <i>Minchah</i> in the early afternoon should add עננו, because even if he eats later on, at least he fasted until midday. (See Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 562:1.) Sephardim follow the custom of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, and Ashkenazim follow the ruling of the Ramah and therefore recite עננו only in <i>Minchah</i>.</i> leader of the congregation recites it as an independent blessing between ""the One who redeems Israel"" and ""the One who heals...,"" and concludes with ""the One who answers in times of trouble."" Thus, he recites 20 blessings.<br>On <sup class=""footnote-marker"">5</sup><i class=""footnote"">This is based on the passage from <i>Ta'anit</i> 13b quoted above. A clear distinction is made between the silent <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> uttered by all the congregants and the repetition recited aloud by the שליח ציבור (leader of the congregation). The שליח ציבור does establish for himself, as representative of the community as a whole, an independent blessing relevant to the fast day. Therefore, he recites 20 blessings, as explained by the Rambam: 19 blessings as on any day, and one extra that is particular to the fast day.<br>There is no disagreement regarding the obligation of the שליח ציבור to recite עננו in the Morning Prayer. He is praying on behalf of the entire community. Therefore, we need not worry about the possibility of the fast being broken, since it is not possible that a number from among the congregants will not fast the whole day (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 565:3). (See the <i>Bi'ur Halacha</i> who holds that at least ten people must intend to fast in order for the שליח ציבור to recite עננו.)</i> the ninth of Av, <sup class=""footnote-marker"">6</sup><i class=""footnote"">The fast day commemorating the destruction of the First and Second Temple, both destroyed on this date, approximately 500 years apart.

It is appropriate that the addition regarding the ninth of Av be placed in this blessing, which speaks of rebuilding Jerusalem.<br>Despite this logic, there is some question regarding the inclusion of this prayer in this blessing. The source for this addition is the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Ta'anit</i> 2:2). That passage questions whether the addition should be made in the עבודה (the first of the last three blessings in the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>) or the הודאה (the second of the last three blessings). It explains that as a general rule commemorative prayers are mentioned in הודאה, while prayers regarding the future are placed in עבודה.<br>Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi quotes this passage, but adds that the custom is to recite the addition in בונה ירושלים (the blessing of Jerusalem). He explains that this decision is based on <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 8a which states that even though normally, we add special requests in the blessing of שומע תפילה (the One who hears prayer), one is able to make a request relevant to one of the blessings of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, in that blessing itself. Therefore, our prayers and supplications regarding the rebuilding of Jerusalem may rightfully be placed in the blessing of בונה ירושלים. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 557:1.)</i> ""Have mercy on us, God, our Lord, and on Your people, Israel, and Jerusalem, Your city, the mourning city,..."" <sup class=""footnote-marker"">8</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Hebrew term is רחם עלינו. This version appears in the Jerusalem Talmud. However, in both Rabbenu Asher's and Rabbenu Yitzhak Alfasi's quotes of that passage, the terms used is נחם (Console us...). This version is found in most siddurim, although the version of Yemenite Jewry is רחם, as in the Rambam.<br>There is also a question regarding when this prayer is recited. The Rambam seems to indicate that רחם (or נחם) is to be recited in every prayer on the ninth of Av. However, the Ramah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 557:1) states that it should only be recited in <i>Minchah</i>, just like עננו on fast days.<br>The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 557) quotes the custom of saying רחם in the Evening and Morning Prayers, and נחם during <i>Minchah</i>. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 557:1) rules that נחם should be recited in all three prayers of the day. This is the custom of Sephardim, though Ashkenazim follow the ruling of the Ramah mentioned above. (See the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 557:1.)<br>The Ramah explains that the rationale behind his decision is that the fire which destroyed the Temple broke out on the afternoon of the ninth of Av. Hence, we ask for comfort at that time specifically. Alternatively, the Ritba explains that only in the afternoon are we able to be comforted. Until then the pain of our loss is too real.</i>",1,"On Fast Days,","This includes the communal fast days (the third of Tishre, the tenth of Tevet, the thirteenth of Adar, the seventeenth of Tammuz, and the ninth of Av) and those fast days proclaimed in response to a specific time of trouble, such as a lack of rain.

Rabbenu Asher (See <i>Tur</i> and <i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 117) raised the question of praying for rain in the summer in Spain or Germany when the climate of the land requires it. Similarly, since the crops in his area would be seriously damaged if rains were not to fall until late November, he lauds the practise (followed in Provence) which begins petitioning for rain in Marcheshvan. At present, the question has become more sensitive when many Jews live in the Southern hemisphere whose rainy season coincides with our summer.<br>Nevertheless, Rav Yosef Karo rules that all places outside of Eretz Yisrael should follow the practice observed in Babylonia.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 70:3, mentions that bridegrooms were originally exempt from <i>Kri'at Shema</i> the first three days (i.e., days and nights) after the wedding. However, today, because of the general lack of intention that everyone has regarding <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, even the bridegroom is obligated to recite the <i>Shema</i>.<br>The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (70:14) adds that a bridegroom who does not recite the <i>Shema</i> appears haughty, because his actions appear to imply that he usually has a high level of intentions. The bridegroom is also obligated to recite the blessings before and after <i>Kri'at Shema</i> and to pray as usual (<i>Magen Avraham; Mishnah Berurah</i>). These positions are based on <i>Tosafot</i> in <i>Berachot</i> 17b.</i>",1,Women,"i>Berachot</i> 20b relates:<br>A woman's exemption from <i>Kri'at Shema</i> is obvious.

That since [<i>Kri'at Shema</i>] contains the acceptance of the sovereignty of Heaven [even women would be called upon to recite it.It [i.e., the Mishnah] teaches that this is not so and that women are indeed exempt from <i>Kri'at Shema</i>.<br>In terms of actual halachic ruling, the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 70:1 rules that although women have no obligation, even rabbinic, to recite the <i>Shema</i>, it is proper that they do so in order to accept upon themselves the yoke of the sovereignty of Heaven.<br>Women are also exempt from the blessings before <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, but are obligated to recite the blessings after it, because there is a mention of the Exodus from Egypt, which women are also obligated to remember and mention (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 70:1).<br>The <i>Aruch Hashulchan</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 70:1) also mentions that women may recite all the blessings of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> and adds that the women of his area (Russia in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century) were accustomed to do so, and that they should be blessed for their meritorious actions.<br>The responsa, <i>Yabia Omer</i> (2:6), states that women of Sephardic origin are not accustomed to recite the blessings.

Reading the Shema 1.9,"When is the [proper] time for the recitation of Shema at night? The commandment [starts] from the time of the appearance of the stars...<br>A <sup class=""footnote-marker"">1</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 2a) states that the time for the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> begins at the hour when a priest who has become ritually impure may immerse in a <i>mikveh</i> and resume eating <i>terumah</i>. The Talmud explains that this is the time when the stars appear.<br><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 2a) holds that the <i>Shema</i> may be recited earlier, during the last hour before sunset. This is based on the understanding that Rabbi Yehudah, who disagrees with the majority opinion regarding the proper time for the afternoon prayer, also disagrees about the proper time for the evening prayer and <i>Kri'at Shema</i> contained therein. (See <i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 235.) This will be discussed at length in <i>Hilchot Tefilah</i> 3:6.<br>There are several different positions regarding the precise definition of צאת הכוכבים (the appearance of the stars). It generally refers to the appearance of three medium-sized stars. The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 235:1 requires the sighting of three small stars before reciting <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> explains that the basic halachah is indeed that three medium sized stars constitute the time of צאת הכוכבים, but that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> obligated one to wait for smaller stars in order to diminish the possibility of error regarding the recitation of <i>Kri'at Shema</i> at night.<br>There are three basic positions regarding the actual time of צאת הכוכבים (the appearance of the stars). <i>Shabbat</i> 34b determines that it refers to the time that it takes one to walk 3/4 of a <i>mil</i> after sunset.<br>The other two positions are found in <i>Pesachim</i> 94a: one defines צאת הכוכבים as the amount of time needed to walk four <i>mil</i> after sunset, and the other, as the time necessary to walk five <i>mil</i>.<br>There are two different methods of determining the time it takes to walk a <i>mil</i>. The Rambam, Commentary to the mishnah, <i>Pesachim</i> 3:2, maintains that it takes 24 minutes to walk a <i>mil</i>. However, the most widely held opinion - and the opinion accepted regarding <i>halachah l'ma'aseh</i> - is that the measure of time is 18 minutes.<br>Therefore, according to <i>Shabbat</i> 34b, the appearance of the stars is 13 1/2 (3/4 x 18) minutes after sunset. Both the Vilna Gaon and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> maintain that צאת הכוכבים is determined in this fashion. Thus, the proper local time may be calculated by extrapolation based on the amount of light visible 13 1/2 minutes after sunset in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> on the day of the Equinox. Generally, people wait up to 36 minutes after sunset in order to be certain.<br>According to <i>Pesachim</i> 94a, the appearance of the stars will be either 72 (4 x 18) minutes or 90 (5 x 18) minutes after sunset. <i>Rabbenu Tam</i> strongly suggests adhering to the position that צאת הכוכבים takes place 72 minutes after sunset. Though some authorities support the 90-minute position, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein (<i>Iggerot Moshe, Orach Chayim</i>, Vol. 1, Siman 24), mentions only the position of the <i>Vilna Gaon</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>, on the one hand, and <i>Rabbenu Tam</i> on the other.</i> person who transgresses and delays fulfills his obligation if he recites [the Shema] before dawn. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">3</sup><i class=""footnote"">In his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 1:1), the Rambam defines dawn (עלות השחר) as the light that radiates from the east before sunrise.<br>There are three major positions regarding this time. All are based on <i>Pesachim</i> 94a which defines the time from dawn until sunrise as that in which a person can walk either 4 <i>mil</i> (according to one opinion) or 5 <i>mil</i> (according to the other).<br>As mentioned above, there are two opinions regarding the measure of time it takes to walk a <i>mil</i>: 18 minutes or 24 minutes. Thus, Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi defines dawn as 120 (5 x 24) minutes before sunrise. The most widely held view is that it is 90 (5 x 18) minutes before sunrise, while the <i>Beit Yosef</i> holds that dawn is 72 (4 x 18) minutes before sunrise. This is the opinion of the Rambam, as stated in his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 1:1.)</i> [The Sages established the limit] of midnight only in order to distance us from negligent wrongdoing. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">4</sup><i class=""footnote"">i>Berachot</i> 1:1 lists other instances where the Sages established similar guidelines, e.g., partaking of sacrificial meat, burning sacrificial limbs.</i>",2,[and continues] until midnight,"There are three positions recorded in the Mishnah in <i>Berachot</i> 2a regarding the time until which one may recite the <i>Shema</i> at night.<br>Rabbi Eliezer says until the end of the first of the three watches of the Temple - i.e., one third of the night, which is until approximately 9:30 pm. The Sages say until midnight, and Rabban Gamliel says until dawn. The Mishnah then explains that the Sages' opinion is, in effect, that one may recite the <i>Shema</i> until dawn, but that they mentioned midnight as a preferred time in order to distance people from transgression. This is the source of this halachah in the Rambam.<br>The <i>Rosh</i> and the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 235) hold that the halachah follows Rabban Gamliel's position, and that a priori (לכתחילה), a person may read the <i>Shema</i> at night until dawn. The Rambam sees the Sages' position as halachically valid, and therefore one may rely on Rabban Gamliel only after the fact (בדיעבד). The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 235:3 quotes the Rambam's position. (See also <i>Mishnah Berurah 235:34-35.)<br></i><br>A person who transgresses and delays - the Rabbinic decree that the <i>Shema</i> should be read before midnight."

Therefore, it should not be considered <i>muktzeh</i> until that time.<br>The <i>Rivosh</i> explains that since eating is the most important use of chametz, it is considered <i>muktzeh</i> once it can no longer be eaten. However, the <i>Bach</i> considers ""the fourth hour"" a printing error and amends the Rambam's text to read ""the fifth hour."" All Ashkenazic halachic authorities decide accordingly.

The transfer of chametz and Pesach pots, dishes, and cutlery is carried out on Thursday night or Friday, and no chametz is cooked afterwards. The Sabbath meals should be totally kosher for Pesach and prepared in the Pesach pots. Four small challot are kept in a special place for the evening and morning meals (two for each meal).<br>They are eaten away from the table, and afterwards, the crumbs are collected and flushed down the toilet. Otherwise, the meals are eaten as all the other meals of the Pesach holiday itself.<br>As mentioned, it is forbidden to eat chametz on the fourteenth of Nisan after the fourth hour of the day (usually around 9:20 AM). To complete the eating of the above-mentioned challot before this hour, certain synagogues may have to conduct their morning services at an earlier time than usual.</i>",7,the Sabbath,"The Ra'avad notes that in <i>Pesachim</i> 49a, the majority opinion accepts this decision only as regards <i>Terumah</i>.

However, even according to the Rambam, the obligation to destroy the chametz before the Sabbath is not a hard and fast rule. On the contrary, our halachah itself states that one is allowed to keep all the chametz he needs for the Sabbath meals. Rather, this can be seen as good advice, facilitating the destruction of chametz, which is much easier before the Sabbath than on that sacred day."

On the day of the fourteenth of Nisan, there is only a positive commandment to destroy chametz.<br>Most commentaries explain that the Rambam himself intended this interpretation. However, some note that Rashi (<i>Pesachim</i> 4b) does maintain that the prohibitions against owning chametz begin on the fourteenth, and they maintain that the Rambam shares this view (See Responsa, <i>Nodah BiYhudah, Orach Chayim</i> 20).</i> and discovers chametz <sup class=""footnote-marker"">2</sup><i class=""footnote"">i>Tosefot</i> (<i>Pesachim</i> 21a) states that a person does not violate the prohibition against possessing chametz unless he becomes conscious of the chametz in his possession.

In Halachah 3, the Rambam also mentions covering chametz with a utensil. However, in that instance, the person had already nullified his possession of the chametz, and thus his possession of chametz violated only a Rabbinic prohibition.<br>In contrast, this instance describes chametz that has not been nullified, and thus the violation of a Torah prohibition is involved. Nevertheless, the Rambam considers the Rabbinic prohibition against <i>mukzteh</i> as important enough to override the fulfillment of a Torah commandment. Furthermore, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that since the person himself desires to destroy the chametz, and the only reason he fails to do so is the Rabbinic commandment, he is not considered to have violated the Torah's prohibitions against possessing chametz.<br>This view is not accepted by all authorities. Many explain that since three Torah mitzvot (the two prohibitions against possessing chametz and the positive commandment to destroy chametz) are involved, their observance overrides the prohibitions of <i>muktzeh</i>. Others maintain that even if the prohibition against <i>muktzeh</i> must be observed, the chametz can be destroyed by burning it in the place where it is located.<br>Nevertheless, in practice, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 446:2), the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>, and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> do not accept the latter view, and advise waiting to destroy the chametz until after the holiday. They explain that a person is allowed to light a fire on a festival only if doing so increases his festive joy. Hence, they prohibit burning the chametz in that manner. However, they mention that, if it is possible, a gentile may be asked to destroy the chametz. Furthermore, in the diaspora, a Jew is also allowed to destroy chametz he finds on the second day of a festival.</i> [If the chametz] was consecrated property, <sup class=""footnote-marker"">8</sup><i class=""footnote"">consecrated for use in the Temple;</i> there is no need to cover it with a utensil, for regardless, everyone shies away from its use. <sup class=""footnote-marker"">9</sup><i class=""footnote"">Property consecrated for use in the Temple may never be used for mundane purposes.
