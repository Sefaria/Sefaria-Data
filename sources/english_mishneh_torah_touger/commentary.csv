The<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, and others interpret this halachah as referring to the blessings before eating.

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> answers that those halachot describe a situation where the person has no desire to eat the secondary food in its own right and eats it only because of the primary food. In this halachah, the Rambam is speaking about an instance in which one desires to eat the other foods; nevertheless, they are included in the blessing recited over bread because bread includes all other foods.</p>\n<p>The <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> offers a different interpretation, which appears more appropriate to the context in which the laws are discussed.

The clearest resolution of the difficulty is offered by the <i>Rishon LeTzion</i>, who explains that the Rambam's decision is based on the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 6:5). When the passage from the Babylonian Talmud is studied in the light of the passage from the Jerusalem Talmud, the Rambam's ruling is no longer difficult.</p>\n<p>This relates to a concept frequently discussed by students of the Rambam: Does the Rambam accept the principle that when there is a difference of opinion between the Babylonian Talmud and the Jerusalem Talmud, the Halachah follows the Babylonian Talmud, or not?</p>\n</co:rambam_commentary>\n</div>\n</div>""]"

When a person sits down to such a meal, he is considered to have fixed his attention on eating. People frequently become drawn into eating more than they originally intended at such meals.

In contrast, the blood of the <i>Chaggigah</i> should be sprinkled on the two opposite corners of the altar.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yishmael maintains that בדיעבד (after the fact), were a person to pour the blood of the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering on the base of the altar, he would be considered to have fulfilled his obligation. Hence, the blessing for the Pesach offering can apply to the <i>Chaggigah</i> as well.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Rabbi Akiva maintains that even ""after the fact,"" the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering is not acceptable if its blood is not sprinkled on the altar as prescribed. Accordingly, the blessing for the Pesach offering has no connection to the <i>Chaggigah</i> at all.</p>\n<p>The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> questions the Rambam\'s decision. In <i>Hilchot P\'sulei HaMukdashim</i> 2:2, the Rambam writes: ""Whenever [blood] is prescribed to be presented [on the altar] by sprinkling, and it was presented by pouring, one has fulfilled his obligation,"" accepting the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael. If so, his acceptance of Rabbi Akiva\'s opinion here appears to present a contradiction.</p>\n<p>Rav Yechezkel Landau (<i>Tz\'lach, Pesachim</i> ibid.) attempts to resolve the issue, explaining that the Rambam follows the interpretation of Rav Chayim HaCohen (<i>Tosefot, Pesachim</i> ibid.), who favored a different text of the Talmud and, accordingly, an alternate interpretation of the difference in opinion between the two Sages.</p>\n<p>Rav Chayim maintains that Rabbi Yishmael considers the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering as secondary to the Paschal sacrifice. (See also Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Pesachim</i> 10:7.) Hence, reciting a blessing over the Paschal sacrifice, the essential element (עיקר) of the evening, also fulfills the requirement for the secondary element (טפל), the <i>Chaggigah</i>. Indeed, regarding the blessings recited over food, the Rambam writes (<i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 3:5) that whenever there are two foods, one essential and one secondary, it is only necessary to recite a blessing over the essential food. A blessing is not required for the secondary item.</p>\n<p>This interpretation itself presents a question: Since the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering was instituted only for the sake of the Paschal sacrifice and is not an obligation in its own right, it can be considered as ""secondary"" to the Pesach sacrifice. If so, what is the rationale for Rabbi Akiva\'s opinion?</p>\n<p>It can be explained that Rabbi Akiva never considers one mitzvah as secondary to another. We may use the labels ""primary"" and ""secondary"" in regard to matters dependent on our will, but not in regard to mitzvot which we fulfill in obedience to God\'s desires. Therefore, though the <i>Chaggigah</i> offering was instituted because of the Paschal sacrifice, once it has been instituted, it must be considered as a mitzvah in its own right, with its own importance. Hence, it requires a unique blessing of its own (R. Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitch Haggadah).</p>\n<p>', '[Conversely, the blessing for the Chaggigah] offering does not free one of [the obligation of the blessing for] the Paschal sacrifice. --</b> Both Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yishmael agree with this decision.</p>\n<p>This law can also be explained within the context of the discussion of ""primary"" and ""secondary"" mentioned above. Since the Paschal sacrifice follows the <i>Chagigah</i> offering, for the Paschal sacrifice should be eaten when satisfied, one might presume that it is considered as ""secondary"" to the <i>Chagigah</i>.

Human Dispositions 1.1,"['Each and every man possesses many character traits. Each trait is very different and distant from the others. -</b> Many commentaries assume that the Rambam is stating simply that there are many personality types, which he proceeds to describe: e.g., the angry man, the calm man, etc. They quote various sources in support of this viewpoint, among them <i>Berachot</i> 58a: ""Whoever sees a multitude of Jews recites the blessing: \'Blessed is...the wise who knows the hidden secrets,\' because just as their natures are not similar, neither are their faces.""</p>\n<p>However, by stating that the many character traits are possessed by ""each and every man,"" it is possible that Rambam is implying more than that there are people with different traits. Though in <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> (The Guide to the Perplexed) 2:40 the Rambam himself elaborates upon that idea, it can be said that here his intent is different. He is emphasizing the degree to which each individual\'s personality is a combination of different traits, which may be unrelated and even distant from each other. Anger, generosity, and modesty, for example, can be found together in the same person, much in the same way that tenants of all sorts - unrelated to each other - can be housed in a common building.</p>\n<p>To illustrate these traits, the Rambam employs concrete examples of extreme personalities, so that the contrasts can be appreciated more easily.</p>\n<p>', ""One type of man is wrathful; he is constantly angry. [In contrast,] there is the calm individual who is never moved to anger -</b> Obviously, anger or passivity are not these individuals' only traits. Surely, they share the full spectrum of human emotions.

This statement is difficult to comprehend since there appear to be many successful individuals who achieve their desires. Nevertheless, their accomplishments do not necessitate that their desires will be satisfied. As the <i>Midrash</i> continues: ""A person who possesses 100 silver pieces desires 200. One who possesses 200 desires 400.""<br/></b></p>\n<p>', 'Desire itself is never satisfied. Instead, it puts the person on a constantly moving treadmill, with ever-increasing aims.

For example, gluttony is stimulated and satisfied by taste. In contrast, the traits mentioned below - the desire for money or the lack of desire for it - do not involve the senses.</p>\n<p>"", 'There is the greedy man, who cannot be satisfied -</b> Literally, ""whose soul is not satisfied."" Perhaps the Rambam uses ""soul,"" both here and with regard to the man ruled by his sensual appetites, because it is the desire that characterizes the man, not the performance of an action as such. A man may never indulge his passion for food, or actually amass money and yet, be gluttonous or greedy. Though, in practice, his ability to gratify his ambitions may be limited by external factors, the desires of his soul are, nonetheless, unlimited.</p>\n<p>', 'with all the money in the world, as [<a href=""/16466#v9"">Ecclesiastes 5:9</a>] states: ""A lover of money never has his fill of money."" -</b> Here, the Rambam describes an example where the desire for money becomes a goal in itself. In contrast, a man who gathers money so that he can buy things or achieve power is not interested in money per se. Although he may be faulted for different reasons, he is not greedy for money. On the other hand, for the ""lover of money,"" money itself becomes his raison d\'etre.</p>\n<p>', '[In contrast,] there is the man who puts a check on himself; -</b> literally, he ""cuts himself short."" <a href=""/15925#v26"">II Kings 19:26</a> employs a similar usage of the root <i>ketzar</i>: ""And the inhabitants are broken, with shortened (i.e., weakened or useless) arms.""</p>\n<p>', 'he is satisfied with even a little, which is not enough for his needs, and he does not bother to pursue and attain what he lacks. -</b> This refers to a lazy person, who will not bestir himself even for that which is necessary. In Chapter 2, Halachah 7, this type is described clearly as: ""lazy and an idler."" This is the description, too, in the Rambam\'s Introduction to <i>Avot - Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4.</p>\n<p>', 'There is [the miser,] -</b> In contrast to the ""lover of money"" mentioned above, the miser is not as bent on acquiring new wealth as much as hoarding the money and possessions he has.</p>\n<p>who torments himself with hunger, gathering [his possessions] close to himself. - The terminology the Rambam uses emphasizes the miser\'s need to be close to his money and possessions. Similar, but not exactly correspondent, expressions are found in the Bible (<a href=""/16384#v11"">Proverbs 13:11)</a> and the Talmud (<i>Bava Kama</i> 80a).</p>\n<p>', 'Whenever he spends a penny of his own, he does so with great pain.

It follows that <i>chili</i> represents the opposite extreme. (See also Ibn Ezra, <a href=""/15963#v5"">Isaiah 32:5</a>.)</p>\n<p>The difference between this pair of traits and the miser-spendthrift pair mentioned above is that the latter refers to a person\'s conduct toward himself, while the former refers to his conduct with regard to others. The stingy man, unlike the miser, may spend money for his own needs, but is tightfisted when others are concerned. By the same token, a freehanded man need not necessarily indulge himself, though he is generous when giving charity. Though this may sound praiseworthy, when taken to extremes it can also prove dangerous, because a person may hurt himself in the process of giving excessively to another.

All who are neither stingy nor freehanded stand between them. They are all intermediate, whether they tend towards stinginess or freehandedness. Each point along this imaginary line stands apart - ""is distant"" - from the others on that line. In a diagram, this idea might be depicted as follows:<br/>\nX-----*-------*------*-------*----------*---------*X<br/>\nStingy intermediate points freehanded.</p>\n<p>However, it is highly unlikely that all the Rambam wishes to teach us is that there are many intermediate points of temperament between the extremes. After all, that is self-evident. Furthermore, in each set of associated temperaments - for example, stinginess and freehandedness - only three points on the line are of importance to the Rambam in clarifying his view of personality development: the two extremes and the midpoint. Why should he mention all the other intermediate possibilities?</p>\n<p>Thus, it appears that the Rambam is telling us that there is a midpoint temperament between each pair of contrasting extremes. Given the entire range of human temperaments, there are a number of midpoints which are not necessarily related to each other. For example, the midpoint for generosity may be very different from the midpoint for humility. Thus, in Halachah 1, the Rambam stated that our personality traits are ""different and distant;"" in this halachah, he makes a parallel statement about the midpoints.</p>\n<p>', 'With regard to all the traits: a man has some from the beginning of his conception -</b> i.e., the Rambam distinguishes between genetic traits and those that are acquired.</p>\n<p>', 'in accordance with his bodily nature. -</b> Here, we see an interrelation between body and soul.

Here, the Rambam focuses on good traits, while in <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, he emphasizes good actions.</p>\n<p>', 'Therefore, the early Sages instructed a man to evaluate his traits -</b> The Rambam appears to be referring to <i>Sotah</i> 5b: ""Whoever evaluates his paths in this world will merit and witness God\'s salvation.""</p>\n<p>', 'to calculate them and to direct them along the middle path -</b> At the conclusion of Chapter 4 of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, the Rambam writes:</p>\n<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">When a man weighs his actions constantly and directs them towards their midpoints, he will be on the most elevated human plane possible. He will thereby approach God and grasp His will. This is the most perfect path in the service of God.</p>\n<p>Constant introspection is a necessary element in any program of personal and spiritual growth. Even when a person has the highest goals, unless he frequently looks himself squarely in the mirror and examines his behavior, he may make gross errors.</p>\n<p>', 'so that he will be sound {of body}. -</b> We have enclosed the words ""of body"" with brackets because they are not found in authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> and are problematic. Though a properly balanced temperament may also lead to physical health, this does not appear to be the Rambam\'s intent.</p>\n<p>If the Hebrew <i>bigufo</i> is omitted as suggested, the meaning of <i>shaleim</i> would be altered from ""sound"" to ""complete"" or ""perfect.""</p>\n<p>', 'For example: he should not be wrathful, easily angered; nor be like the dead, without feeling, rather he should [adopt] an intermediate course; i.e., he should display anger -</b> Our translation is based on Chapter 2, Halachah 3. (Note also the commentary of the <i>Knesset HaGedolah</i>.)</p>\n<p>', ""only when the matter is serious enough to warrant it -</b> The Rambam appears to be referring to matters which evoke personal feelings. Nevertheless, the <i>Misrat Moshe</i> interprets this passage as referring to an instance in which Torah law would require a display of anger - e.g., a colleague's transgression of Torah law.</p>\n<p>"", 'in order to prevent the matter from recurring.<br/></b></p>\n<p>', 'Similarly, he should not desire -</b> This refers to physical desire.</p>\n<p>', 'anything other than that which the body needs and cannot exist without, as [<a href=""/16384#v25"">Proverbs 13:25</a>] states -</b> The Rambam quotes supporting verses for only two of the ""intermediate traits;"" perhaps, because his description of the middle-of-the-road position for these traits might appear to veer toward one extreme. We might expect the intermediate point between gluttony and its opposite extreme to be eating to one\'s satisfaction. However, here we are told that we should desire only what is sufficient in order to exist.</p>\n<p>However, the Rambam is not telling us to deny ourselves satisfaction. <a href=""/9972#v10"">Deuteronomy 8:10</a> teaches: ""You shall eat and be satisfied, and bless God, your Lord."" Based on that verse, <i>Berachot</i> 48b explains that we are obligated to recite grace only when we feel physically satisfied. (The Rambam quotes this concept in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 1:1.) In Chapter 3, Halachah 1, and in <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, he elaborates on the negative aspects of asceticism.</p>\n<p>Thus, his intent cannot be that we deny our desires, but rather that we school ourselves to desire and feel satisfied with what we need, without excess. This is a dominant theme in the sections on diet in Chapter 4, and those describing the conduct of a Torah sage in Chapter 5.</p>\n<p>', '""The righteous man eats to satisfy his soul."" -</b> The verse continues: ""But the belly of the wicked will want."" The commentaries note that the contrast between the two does not center on the quantity of food they eat, but on the attitude with which they eat it. Because the righteous are not given over to pursuit of gratification, they can be satisfied. Conversely, it is the gluttony of the wicked which actually causes their want.</p>\n<p>Note also the Midrashic interpretations of this verse:</p>\n<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">""The righteous..."" This refers to Eliezer, who said to Rebecca: ""Let me sip a little water"" (<a href=""/8219#v17"">Genesis 24:17)</a> - a single sip.<br/>\n""And the belly of the wicked will want."" This refers to Esau, who said to Jacob: ""Stuff me..."" (<a href=""/8220#v30"">Genesis 25:30)</a>. Rabbi Yitzchak ben Zeira said: he opened his mouth agape like a camel and said: ""I will open my mouth and you put it in"" (<i>Tanchumah; Pinchas</i> 13; <i>BaMidbar Rabbah</i> 21:18).</p>\n<p>', 'Also, he shall not labor in his business except to gain what he needs for immediate use, as [<a href=""/16258#v16"">Psalms 37:16</a>] states: -</b> Here again, the Rambam quotes a Biblical verse, because his definition of an intermediate path may seem extreme. The verse also clarifies that the Rambam is not denigrating the idea of work, but excessive preoccupation with one\'s profession as a means of acquiring possessions.</p>\n<p>It is highly unlikely that the Rambam would criticize work per se. Note <a href=""/16377#v6"">Proverbs 6:6</a>: ""Sluggard, go to the ant, see its ways and become wise;"" and <i>Berachot</i> 8a:</p>\n<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">He who enjoys the toil of his hands is greater than one who fears God..., as it is stated: ""If you eat of the work of you hands, you are fortunate and will possess the good"" (<a href=""/16349#v2"">Psalms 128:2)</a>.<br/>\n""You are fortunate"" - in this life, and ""will possess the good"" - in the world to come.</p>\n<p>The Rambam, himself, quotes the latter passage in <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 3:11. Thus, the Rambam is not criticizing a person for working hard, but rather teaching us that work and its profits should not be our greatest priorities.</p>\n<p>', '""A little is good for the righteous man."" -</b> The verse in its entirety expresses a contrast: ""A little is better for the righteous man than the great wealth that many [of the] wicked possess."" Note the commentary of ibn Ezra: ""The righteous man will be happier with his small lot than the wicked with their great wealth.""</p>\n<p>', 'He should not be overly stingy -</b> The printed editions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> have <i>yikfotz</i> (close his hand). However, most manuscripts use the term: <i>yikabetz</i> (gather).</p>\n<p><i>Yikfotz</i> recalls <a href=""/9979#v7"">Deuteronomy 15:7</a>: ""Do not close your hand from your needy brother."" Thus, the contrasting extreme would be freehandedness. <i>Yikabetz</i>, like <i>vikubatz</i> in Halachah 1, reflects miserly behavior, the opposite of which is being a spendthrift. The variant texts might reflect a difference of opinion as to which opposing extremes the Rambam had in mind.</p>\n<p>', 'nor spread his money about, but he should give charity according to his capacity -</b> See <i>Hilchot Arachin</i> 8:12-13, which places restrictions on the extent of one\'s generosity.</p>\n<p><b>and lend to the needy as is fitting -</b> Lending is also a form of charity. In <i>Hilchot Matnot Ani\'im</i> 10:7, the Rambam lists eight degrees of charity. The highest is the support of a fellow Jew who has become poor by giving him loans or the like.</p>\n<p><b>He should not be overly elated and laugh [excessively] -</b> Such expressive ""happiness"" is often a sign of inner discontent and suffering.</p>\n<p><b>nor be sad and depressed in spirit. Rather, he should be quietly happy at all times -</b> his joy should be a composed sense of satisfaction.</p>\n<p>[In this context, see the Ramah\'s conclusion of his notes to <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> (697:1) in which he quotes <a href=""/16386#v15"">Proverbs 15:15</a>: ""A good-hearted person is always celebrating.""]</p>\n<p><b>with a friendly countenance. -</b> In his commentary on <i>Avot</i> 1:14, the Rambam defines ""a friendly countenance"" as ""a spirit of will and gentility.""</p>\n<p><b>The same applies with regard to his other traits. -</b> In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam mentions many other ""intermediate traits.""

Human Dispositions 1.5,"['A person who carefully [examines] his [behavior] -</b> in an effort to achieve the desired intermediate path</p>\n<p>', 'and therefore, deviates slightly from the mean -</b> to compensate for a possible error in calculating that mean.</p>\n<p>', 'to either side is called pious. -</b> In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam explains that one can refine and correct his behavior by balancing a tendency for excess in one direction by intentionally forcing oneself to adopt the opposite extreme. (See Chapter 2, Halachah 2.) He continues:</p>\n<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">Therefore, the pious did not allow themselves to fix their traits at the midpoint, but would bend slightly to the side of excess or want as a hedge and a guard.</p>\n<p>He goes on to explain that, even for the pious, these extremes are not ends in themselves, but means to help them overcome natural tendencies. Thus, both the pious and a person of underdeveloped character may act in an extreme manner. However, the difference between them is that the behavior of the pious is carefully calculated with the intent of refining his personality, while the underdeveloped person does so without thought, as a natural response to his whims and fancies.</p>\n<p>', 'What is implied? -</b> i.e., how is this concept exemplified?</p>\n<p>', 'One who shuns pride -</b> At first glance, the choice of pride as an example is rather problematic, because in Chapter 2, Halachah 3, the Rambam states:</p>\n<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">There are traits for which it is forbidden for a person to follow an intermediate path.... Such a trait is pride...<br/>\nThe proper path is not that a person should merely be humble, but rather hold himself very lowly...<br/>\nTherefore, our Sages commanded: ""Be very, very humble of spirit.""</p>\n<p>It is possible to explain that because of the negative aspects of the quality of pride, the middle path that one should follow in regard to it does not resemble the middle paths of the other traits and may appear as an extreme. Pride represents one extreme, its converse being absolute lack of concern for self to the extent that one walks around in rags. Between these extremes are a number of intermediate points: modesty - which might normally be considered as the intermediate level; humility - which the Rambam considers as the true middle path; and extreme humility - which is pious behavior (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>). See also the commentary on the halachah cited above.</p>\n<p>Possibly, it is the exaggerated contrasts in this set of traits that make it the most fitting example to demonstrate the principle of the middle path that the Rambam espouses. These gross differences allow for the possibility of clear distinctions.</p>\n<p>', 'and turns to the other extreme -</b> The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> emphasizes that one need not actually adopt the other extreme, but rather, he should tend his behavior in that direction.</p>\n<p>', 'and carries himself lowly is called pious. This is the quality of piety -</b> which represents a deviation from the mean.</p>\n<p>', 'However, if he separates himself [from pride] only to the extent that he reaches the mean and displays humility, he is called wise. This is the quality of wisdom. -</b> In his commentary on <i>Avot</i> 5:6, the Rambam contrasts the wise and the pious:</p>\n<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">A boor is one who lacks both intellectual and ethical development...<br/>\nA wise man possesses both these qualities in a complete way, as is fitting.<br/>\n<i>A pious man is a wise man</i> who increases his piety - i.e., his emotional development - until he tends toward one extreme, as explained in Chapter 4 [of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>], and his deeds exceed his wisdom.</p>\n<p>Thus, the wise man is one whose ethical behavior has been developed to the point at which it reflects his intellectual sophistication. He is able to appreciate the mean of each trait and express it within the context of his daily life. The pious man also possesses this quality, but due to his desire for ultimate self-refinement, he is willing to sacrifice himself and tend slightly to the extreme in certain instances.</p>\n<p>Although in this halachah, the Rambam differentiates between the middle path - the path of the wise - and ""beyond the measure of the law"" - the path of the pious, in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 5:11 he describes how, ""according to the greatness of the Sage, should be the care he takes to go beyond the measure of the law."" Thus, it appears that a truly wise man will ultimately seek pious ways.</p>\n<p>', 'The same applies with regard to other character traits. -</b> i.e., there is a mean which is the path of wisdom, and a deviation from that course with a positive intent, which is the path of piety.</p>\n<p>', 'The pious of the early generations -</b> This expression is borrowed - out of context - from the Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 5:1.</p>\n<p>', 'would bend their temperaments from the intermediate path towards [either of] the two extremes. For some traits, they would veer towards the final extreme -</b> excess (<i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4)</p>\n<p>', 'for others, towards the first extreme -</b> lack (ibid.). Depending on the circumstances involved, deviation to either extreme can produce positive results.</p>\n<p>', 'This is referred to -</b> by our Sages...</p>\n<p>', 'as [behavior] beyond the measure of the law. -</b> We find this expression used in a number of Talmudic passages. For example, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 30b relates that Rabbi Yishmael, Rabbi Yossi\'s son, was on a journey. A porter traveling the same road asked him to help lift a load of wood. Rabbi Yishmael was a distinguished scholar, and, therefore, this base task would have been demeaning for him. Nevertheless, rather than refuse the porter entirely, Rabbi Yishmael purchased his entire load from him. This was considered as behavior beyond the measure of the law.</p>\n<p>See also <i>Berachot</i> 7a and 45b, <i>Bava Kama</i> 100a, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 24b. However, in these and other Talmudic passages where the term is used, the emphasis appears to be on the ethical or legal imperative involved, without stressing the aspect of character development. [Note <i>Hilchot Aveidah</i> 11:7, the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat</i> 259:3 and 263:3, and <i>Sefer Mitzvot Katan</i> (Positive Commandment 49), which mention our obligation to go beyond the measure of the law.]</p>\n<p>Thus, the Rambam appears merely to be borrowing the term used by the Sages without referring to any specific instance. The path of behavior prescribed by one\'s intellect corresponds to law, and an intentional deviation from that course for the sake of piety is ""beyond the measure of the law.""</p>\n<p>', 'We are commanded -</b> The <i>Sifre</i> (on <a href=""/9977#v5"">Deuteronomy 13:5)</a> states: \'You shall walk after God, your Lord\' - this is a positive commandment."" The <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Ki Tetze</i>, p. 270) also makes a similar statement. However, neither source elaborates.</p>\n<p>Among the <i>Geonim</i>, the <i>Ba\'al Halachot Gedolot</i> does list it as a commandment. Rav Sa\'adiah Gaon does not include it as a specific commandment.</p>\n<p><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive mitzvah 8) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 610) include this as one of the Torah\'s 613 mitzvot. However, the Rambam\'s inclusion of this commandment as one of the 613 mitzvot is somewhat problematic. In <i>Shoresh</i> 4 of his introduction to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, he states that he does not include any ""general mitzvah"" which does not involve a specific activity in his reckoning of the 613 mitzvot. For this reason, ""Observe My statutes"" (<a href=""/9920#v19"">Leviticus 19:19)</a> or ""Be holy"" (<a href=""/9920#v2"">Leviticus 19:2)</a> are not included in the 613 mitzvot. On the surface, the command the Rambam mentions here also seems to be an all encompassing charge to develop ourselves spiritually without any specific activity.</p>\n<p>Rav Avraham, the Rambam\'s son, was asked this question, and he explained that here the specific activity implied by this commandment is the development of our emotions and character traits. A somewhat deeper perspective can be gained from the Rambam\'s own description of the mitzvah. When listing the mitzvot at the beginning of these halachot, he states that the mitzvah is ""to imitate God\'s ways"" and in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, he defines the mitzvah as ""to imitate Him, blessed be He, according to our potential.""</p>\n<p>The implication of these statements is that man has a constant obligation to carry out all of his deeds and guide the progress of his emotional development with the intent of imitating God. (See <i>Likkutei Sichot, Tavo</i> 5748, and note the commentary on the following halachah.)</p>\n<p>', 'to walk in these intermediate paths -</b> Despite the Rambam\'s praise of piety, his very description of it as ""beyond the measure of the law"" implies that, though it is desirable, it cannot be considered as obligatory.</p>\n<p><b>and they are good and straight paths - as [<a href=""/9992#v9"">Deuteronomy 28:9</a>] states: ""And you shall walk in His ways."" -</b> The Rambam describes this mitzvah in the following halachah. Indeed, the authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> include the paragraph we have just explained as the beginning of Halachah 6.</p>\n<co:rambam_commentary halacha=""6"">\n<p>As emphasized in the introduction to this text, the Rambam has structured the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> with the intent of ""revealing all the laws to the great and to the small with regard to each and every mitzvah."" He does not mention philosophical and ethical concepts unless they are halachot - i.e., practical directives for our behavior.</p>\n<p>In this context, we can understand the structure of this chapter. The Rambam set out to describe the mitzvah of following God\'s ways. As stated in this halachah, he perceives this to mean developing our personalities by emulating the qualities which the Creator reveals. As he states in the following halachah, those qualities are identical with the middle path of human behavior. Therefore, in the initial halachot of this chapter, the Rambam sets out to describe the nature of human personality and the ideal temperaments - the middle path - that man should seek to achieve. Having laid down this foundation, he is able to define that mitzvah in this halachah and begin offering directives for its fulfillment in Halachah 7.</p>\n<p><b>[Our Sages] taught [the following] explanation of this mitzvah -</b> The Rambam appears to be referring to the <i>Sifre, Ekev</i> 11:22, which he quotes in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (ibid.). That explanation is also paralleled in the <i>Mechiltah</i> (<a href=""/9875#v2"">Exodus 14:2)</a> and <i>Shabbat</i> 133b.</p>\n<p>It must be noted that other Talmudic and Midrashic sources interpret the commandment to imitate God in a different light. Note <i>Sotah</i> 14a:</p>\n<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">[<a href=""/9977#v5"">Deuteronomy 13:5</a> states]: ""You shall walk after God, your Lord."" Is it possible for man to walk after the Divine Presence? Has it not been stated: ""Behold, God, your Lord, is a consuming fire"" (<a href=""/9968#v24"">Deuteronomy 4:24)</a>?<br/>\nRather, [it means] one should follow the qualities of God.<br/>\nJust as He dresses the naked..., you, too, should dress the naked;<br/>\nGod visited the sick...; you, too, should visit the sick;<br/>\nGod comforted the bereaved...;you, too, should comfort the bereaved;<br/>\nGod buried the dead...; you, too, should bury the dead.</p>\n<p>In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam mentions emulating both God\'s deeds and His qualities. Similarly, <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, in its description of this mitzvah, and the <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> in his commentary - both here in <i>Hilchot De\'ot</i> and also in <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> - mention both deeds and qualities.</p>\n<p>There is not necessarily a contradiction between these two emphases. As mentioned above, our actions reflect our personalities. Therefore, it follows that developing our characters in the manner outlined by the Rambam in this halachah will ultimately produce the good deeds mentioned by our Sages in the passage from <i>Sotah</i>.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, deed is often not a reflection of character. A person with many severe character faults may still do good deeds. Hence, for the ""resemblance of God"" to be complete, it is not sufficient merely to perform positive deeds. Rather, a person must undergo internal change by developing his character. Therefore, the Rambam focuses more on this aspect of the commandment.</p>\n<p><b>Just as He is called ""Gracious,"" you shall be gracious; Just as He is called ""Merciful,"" you shall be merciful; Just as He is called ""Holy,"" you shall be holy; -</b> Neither the <i>Sifre</i> nor the other sources quoted above mention the trait of holiness. Rather, the third trait mentioned is ""piety."" Perhaps, since the Rambam gave a specific definition for piety in the previous halachah within his conception of personality development, he does not mention it in the present context to prevent any possible confusion.</p>\n<p><b>In a similar manner, the prophets -</b> The Rambam\'s choice of words is somewhat surprising since many of these expressions are also found in the Torah as well as in the prophetic works. However, in the Torah these titles are mentioned by Moses or the other prophets. Perhaps this is the Rambam\'s intent.</p>\n<p><b>called God by other titles: ""Slow to anger,"" ""Abundant in kindness,"" ""Righteous,"" ""Just,"" ""Perfect,"" ""Almighty,"" ""Powerful,"" and the like. -</b> In <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:11-12 and in detail in <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> (Guide to the Perplexed), Vol. I, Chapters 53 and 54, the Rambam explains that these names are not descriptions of God, who cannot be defined by any specific quality. To do so would limit Him and detract from His infinite and transcendent state of being.</p>\n<p>Rather, the use of these titles must be understood as follows: God brings about activities, which, had they been carried out by man, would have been motivated by these emotional states. For example, instead of utterly destroying the Jews after the sin of the Golden Calf, God allowed our people to continue. Were such a deed to have been performed by a human ruler, we would describe him as ""slow to anger."" Though that term cannot serve as a description for God - for He cannot be described - the Torah and the prophets referred to Him by such terms with the following intent.</p>\n<p><b>[They did so] to inform us that these are good and just paths. -</b> i.e., God acted in ways which we identify with these qualities - and the Torah and the prophets mention these actions - because these are attributes which man should strive to achieve.</p>\n<p><b>A person is obligated to accustom himself to these paths and [to try to] resemble Him - <i>Likkutei Sichot</i> (ibid.) states that with the latter phrase, the Rambam is adding a new thought. As explained above, God cannot be described by any particular quality. If He manifests a quality, it is for a specific intent.<br/></b></p>\n<p><b>In <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> (ibid., Chapter 54), the Rambam mentions that the leader of a country should act in a similar manner.<br/></b></p>\n<p style=""padding-left:10px;""><b>Sometimes he will be merciful and generous to some people - not because of his feelings and natural compassion, but because they are deserving of such treatment.<br/>\nSometimes he will bear a grudge, seek revenge, and rage against certain people - not out of feelings of anger... - but in order to produce positive results....<br/>\nThe ultimate ideal man can achieve is to imitate God according to his potential... i.e., to have our deeds resemble His deeds.<br/></b></p>\n<p>For this reason, human behavior should not be motivated by the spontaneous expression of emotion. Rather, man\'s emotions should arise as the result of a deliberate process of thought.</p>\n<p>This reflects themes brought out in the previous halachot of this chapter: that a person must constantly evaluate and review his emotions (Halachah 4); that it is a wise man who is able to appreciate the middle path (Halachah 5).</p>\n<p>This is what is meant by the imitation of God: that a person not be controlled by the unchecked expression of his emotions. Rather, he should control his feelings and, motivated by his desire to resemble God, search to find the correct and proper quality, the middle path, appropriate to the situation at hand.</p>\n<p>to the extent of his ability. - for man is ultimately finite in nature, and no true resemblance to God is possible.</p>\n</co:rambam_commentary>\n<co:rambam_commentary halacha=""7"">\n<p><b>How can one train himself to follow these temperaments to the extent that they become a permanent fixture of his [personality]? -</b> Having established personality development as a mitzvah in the previous halachah, the Rambam begins his explanation of how this mitzvah is fulfilled.</p>\n<p><b>He should perform - repeat - and perform a third time -</b> Thus, a person\'s deeds will shape his character traits.</p>\n<p>In this process of personal change, the stress is on the repetition of an act, and not on its quantity or intensity. In his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Avot</i> 3:15, the Rambam writes that giving a thousand coins to one person at one time is not as effective in stimulating feelings of generosity as giving a single coin one thousand times.</p>\n<p>As mentioned in Halachah 4, though the Rambam\'s explanations in this chapter parallel those of the fourth chapter of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, the texts differ in stressing actions (as the opening lines of that chapter imply), or on character development, which is the theme of our text.</p>\n<p>For this reason, the two texts also perceive the process of causation differently. In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, the Rambam states: ""These actions [good actions] are produced as a result of these [the good] traits,"" while here he sees the traits being produced by the actions.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the two texts do not actually contradict each other. Both statements are true. Our deeds reflect our personalities, and they also help shape those personalities. Generally, this means that a person\'s behavior will reinforce and strengthen the character traits that motivated those very deeds. However, this chapter - and more particularly, this halachah - deals with a person who has made a commitment to change and refine his character. Therefore - based on his intellect and the directives of the Torah, rather than his spontaneous feelings - he chooses to perform deeds that will bring about this process of inner change.</p>\n<p><b>which conform to -</b> reflect and are motivated by...</p>\n<p><b>the standards of the middle road temperaments -</b> described in Halachot 4 and 5.</p>\n<p><b>He should do this constantly, until these acts are easy for him and do not present any difficulty. -</b> A trait possessed by a person produces activities naturally and spontaneously. However, if one has not acquired a trait as yet, certain actions will be foreign to his nature, and one must trouble himself to perform them.</p>\n<p>For example, a liberal man gives charity naturally; the miser must force himself to give. The action for each is the same, but not the inner feelings.</p>\n<p><b>Then, these temperaments will become a fixed part of his personality. -</b> If the miser continues to give frequently, he will find that he no longer feels like a miser, but has become liberal in heart as well as in hand.</p>\n<p><b>Since the Creator -</b> The Rambam uses the term <i>yotzer</i> - literally ""the One who forms"" - (which appears only one other time in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>: <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:7).</p>\n<p>The Rambam describes God as the Creator with reference to the Divine qualities he describes in these halachot. Before the existence of the world and man, there would be no purpose for God to reveal these qualities, for until man\'s creation, no one could learn from or emulate them.</p>\n<p>[The word <i>yotzer</i> may also be used because of its connection to the word <i>yeitzer</i>, meaning drive or inclination. (See Rashi, <a href=""/8166#v7"">Genesis 2:7</a>.)]</p>\n<p><b>is called by these terms and they make up the middle path which we are obligated to follow, this path is called ""the path of God."" -</b> As stated in the commentary on the previous halachah, ""the path of God"" involves controlling our emotions by using our intellect, so that our behavior is, to the extent that is possible for man, an objective response to a situation.

Human Dispositions 1.6,"['[Our Sages] taught [the following] explanation of this mitzvah -</b> The Rambam appears to be referring to the <i>Sifre, Ekev</i> 11:22, which he quotes in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (ibid.). That explanation is also paralleled in the <i>Mechiltah</i> (<a href=""/9875#v2"">Exodus 14:2)</a> and <i>Shabbat</i> 133b.</p>\n<p>It must be noted that other Talmudic and Midrashic sources interpret the commandment to imitate God in a different light. Note <i>Sotah</i> 14a:</p>\n<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">[<a href=""/9977#v5"">Deuteronomy 13:5</a> states]: ""You shall walk after God, your Lord."" Is it possible for man to walk after the Divine Presence? Has it not been stated: ""Behold, God, your Lord, is a consuming fire"" (<a href=""/9968#v24"">Deuteronomy 4:24)</a>?<br/>\nRather, [it means] one should follow the qualities of God.<br/>\nJust as He dresses the naked..., you, too, should dress the naked;<br/>\nGod visited the sick...; you, too, should visit the sick;<br/>\nGod comforted the bereaved...;you, too, should comfort the bereaved;<br/>\nGod buried the dead...; you, too, should bury the dead.</p>\n<p>In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam mentions emulating both God\'s deeds and His qualities. Similarly, <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, in its description of this mitzvah, and the <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> in his commentary - both here in <i>Hilchot De\'ot</i> and also in <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> - mention both deeds and qualities.</p>\n<p>There is not necessarily a contradiction between these two emphases. As mentioned above, our actions reflect our personalities. Therefore, it follows that developing our characters in the manner outlined by the Rambam in this halachah will ultimately produce the good deeds mentioned by our Sages in the passage from <i>Sotah</i>.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, deed is often not a reflection of character. A person with many severe character faults may still do good deeds. Hence, for the ""resemblance of God"" to be complete, it is not sufficient merely to perform positive deeds. Rather, a person must undergo internal change by developing his character. Therefore, the Rambam focuses more on this aspect of the commandment.</p>\n<p>', 'Just as He is called ""Gracious,"" you shall be gracious; Just as He is called ""Merciful,"" you shall be merciful; Just as He is called ""Holy,"" you shall be holy; -</b> Neither the <i>Sifre</i> nor the other sources quoted above mention the trait of holiness. Rather, the third trait mentioned is ""piety."" Perhaps, since the Rambam gave a specific definition for piety in the previous halachah within his conception of personality development, he does not mention it in the present context to prevent any possible confusion.</p>\n<p>', ""In a similar manner, the prophets -</b> The Rambam's choice of words is somewhat surprising since many of these expressions are also found in the Torah as well as in the prophetic works. However, in the Torah these titles are mentioned by Moses or the other prophets. Perhaps this is the Rambam's intent.</p>\n<p>"", 'called God by other titles: ""Slow to anger,"" ""Abundant in kindness,"" ""Righteous,"" ""Just,"" ""Perfect,"" ""Almighty,"" ""Powerful,"" and the like. -</b> In <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:11-12 and in detail in <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> (Guide to the Perplexed), Vol. I, Chapters 53 and 54, the Rambam explains that these names are not descriptions of God, who cannot be defined by any specific quality. To do so would limit Him and detract from His infinite and transcendent state of being.</p>\n<p>Rather, the use of these titles must be understood as follows: God brings about activities, which, had they been carried out by man, would have been motivated by these emotional states. For example, instead of utterly destroying the Jews after the sin of the Golden Calf, God allowed our people to continue. Were such a deed to have been performed by a human ruler, we would describe him as ""slow to anger."" Though that term cannot serve as a description for God - for He cannot be described - the Torah and the prophets referred to Him by such terms with the following intent.</p>\n<p>', '[They did so] to inform us that these are good and just paths. -</b> i.e., God acted in ways which we identify with these qualities - and the Torah and the prophets mention these actions - because these are attributes which man should strive to achieve.</p>\n<p>', 'A person is obligated to accustom himself to these paths and [to try to] resemble Him - <i>Likkutei Sichot</i> (ibid.) states that with the latter phrase, the Rambam is adding a new thought. As explained above, God cannot be described by any particular quality. If He manifests a quality, it is for a specific intent.<br/></b></p>\n<p>', 'In <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> (ibid., Chapter 54), the Rambam mentions that the leader of a country should act in a similar manner.<br/></b></p>\n<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">', ""Sometimes he will be merciful and generous to some people - not because of his feelings and natural compassion, but because they are deserving of such treatment.<br/>\nSometimes he will bear a grudge, seek revenge, and rage against certain people - not out of feelings of anger... - but in order to produce positive results....<br/>\nThe ultimate ideal man can achieve is to imitate God according to his potential... i.e., to have our deeds resemble His deeds.<br/></b></p>\n<p>For this reason, human behavior should not be motivated by the spontaneous expression of emotion. Rather, man's emotions should arise as the result of a deliberate process of thought.</p>\n<p>This reflects themes brought out in the previous halachot of this chapter: that a person must constantly evaluate and review his emotions (Halachah 4); that it is a wise man who is able to appreciate the middle path (Halachah 5).</p>\n<p>This is what is meant by the imitation of God: that a person not be controlled by the unchecked expression of his emotions. Rather, he should control his feelings and, motivated by his desire to resemble God, search to find the correct and proper quality, the middle path, appropriate to the situation at hand.</p>\n<p>to the extent of his ability. - for man is ultimately finite in nature, and no true resemblance to God is possible.</p>\n</co:rambam_commentary>\n</div>\n</div>""]"

Both statements are true. Our deeds reflect our personalities, and they also help shape those personalities. Generally, this means that a person\'s behavior will reinforce and strengthen the character traits that motivated those very deeds. However, this chapter - and more particularly, this halachah - deals with a person who has made a commitment to change and refine his character.

Many other authorities (see <i>Tosafot, Sanhedrin</i> 64a) disagree, and maintain that even in such circumstances, one could be held liable for capital punishment. For example, two witnesses who knew the law were present and warned the person against repudiating the idol in this fashion. He ignored their warning and performed the derisive act of worship.

Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 3.6,"['[The following rules apply when] a person serves a false deity out of love - i.e., he desires an image because its service is very attractive -</b> The commentaries note that the Rambam interprets ""out of love"" differently from ""out of fear."" ""Out of love"" refers to a love for the image and its service, while ""out of fear"" means fear of what the deity can do to the person.</p>\n<p>Rav Kapach explains the Rambam\'s position, justifying the need for such a difference in interpretation. Most idolaters do not worship their images out of a genuine conviction that they are the true god, but rather for the benefit they feel this service will bring them. Therefore, were a person to serve an idol with this intent in mind, the Rambam would hold him liable. In contrast, were he to serve out of fear, he is not considered to be acting on his own volition, and hence is not held responsible.</p>\n<p>', 'or when one serves it out of his fear of it - i.e., he fears that it will harm him - as the [idol] worshipers fear [their deities as sources of] benefit and harm: -</b> See Chapter 1, Halachot 1-2.</p>\n<p>', 'If he accepts it as a god -</b> and serves it as an act of worship</p>\n<p>', 'he is liable to be stoned to death -</b> as stated in Halachah 1.</p>\n<p>', 'If he serves it out of love or fear -</b> without accepting it as a god - even though he served it</p>\n<p>', 'through its accepted mode of service -</b> as mentioned in Halachah 2</p>\n<p>', 'or through one of the four services [mentioned above] -</b> in Halachah 3,</p>\n<p>', 'he is not held liable -</b> since he did not accept the deity as a god.</p>\n<p>Although the Rambam\'s opinion is questioned by many other authorities, it is based on an established tradition of Talmudic interpretation. This halachah is based on <i>Sanhedrin</i> 61b. That passage is also quoted in <i>Shabbat</i> 72b. Rabbenu Chanan\'el, one of the foremost commentators in the generations between the Geonim and the Rambam, interprets the latter passage using the same concepts _ and almost the same phraseology _ as employed by the Rambam here.</p>\n<p>The Ra\'avad and others challenge the Rambam\'s interpretation and explain that ""out of love"" and ""out of fear"" mean: motivated by the love or fear of the person who tries to influence one to worship the false deity. The Rambam cannot accept this interpretation, because in <i>Hilchot Yesodei Torah</i> 5:4, he states that a person who is forced to serve false gods is not held liable for his deeds (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</p>\n<p>The fact that a person is not held liable for such service does not at all minimize the seriousness of the prohibition involved. In no way is one allowed to serve false gods for such reasons. Even with regard to the Ra\'avad\'s interpretation ""out of fear"" - i.e., out of fear of a person - the Ramah (<i>Yoreh De\'ah</i> 150:3) prohibits performing any act that might be interpreted as idol worship - e.g., bowing to a ruler who is wearing an image.</p>\n<p>', 'One who embraces a false deity, kisses it, sweeps before it, mops before it, washes it, anoints it, dresses it, places shoes upon it, or performs any similar act of deference violates a negative commandment, as [implied by <a href=""/9881#v5"">Exodus 20:5</a>]: ""Do not serve them."" -</b> This commandment is described in Halachot 2 and 3.</p>\n<p>', 'Such acts are also ""service.""

Lashes are not given for the violation of such a prohibition, as stated in <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 18:2-3.</p>\n<p>To explain: The prohibition, ""Do not serve them,"" is twofold in nature. It prohibits the worship of a false deity through its accepted modes of service, as stated in Halachah 2. This is a sin punishable by death. The same prohibition also forbids these expressions of affection or reverence. These deeds are not, however, punishable by death because they are not acts of worship.</p>\n<p>Since violation of this prohibition incurs a penalty of execution, it is not associated with the punishment of lashes. Since, in essence, this prohibition is not associated with lashes, even the many transgressions of a lesser nature which are also included within this prohibition are also not punishable in this manner (Rav Kapach).</p>\n<p>', 'If one of the above services -</b> kissing, and the like</p>\n<p>', 'was the accepted mode of worship [of a particular deity] and a person performed this service as an act of worship -</b> and not merely as an expression of emotion. The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> questions the addition of the words ""as an act of worship,"" noting that in Halachah 5, the Rambam holds one liable for performing the service with which Pe\'or or Marculis was worshiped, even though one\'s intent was to repudiate the idols. Thus, it appears that once a person performs a service which is the accepted mode of worship, his intent is no longer significant.</p>\n<p>The <i>Pri Chadash</i> resolves this difficulty, explaining that the extent of liability is different.

In contrast, the prohibition of making images of the celestial beings was a safeguard instituted by the Rabbis against Greek and Roman culture. It, therefore, applies to all images, whether pictures or statues, because both could influence people to stray from the Torah\'s ways.</p>\n<p>According to the simple interpretation of the terms ""sun"" and ""moon,"" the difference can be explained as follows: The sun and the moon, as we perceive them, appear against the background of the sky. Therefore, for a representation of them to be forbidden, it also need not protrude (<i>Tosafot, 14Avodah Zarah</i>, ibid.).</p>\n<p>', ""The images of animals and other living beings - with the exception of men - <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 42b also mentions a prohibition against making the image of a <i>d'rakon</i> which Rashi and others interpret as an animal similar to a serpent.<br/></b></p>\n<p>"", 'In his Commentary on the Mishnah (ibid.), the Rambam describes this image as a fishlike man with fins and many scales, probably referring to the Greek god Neptune.<br/></b></p>\n<p>', 'and similarly, the images of trees, grasses, and the like may be fashioned.

There are only two restrictions: realistic human statues (and according to some authorities, these must be complete, full-bodied statues) and depictions of pagan gods. Even according to the other opinions which forbid depictions of the sun, the moon, and the like, there is no prohibition against abstract portrayals of these entities. No other restrictions apply at all.</p>\n<p>There is definitely a divergence between the approach to life that spawned much of the art forms of Western culture and a Torah lifestyle. Perhaps for that reason, many religious Jews have traditionally shunned participation in and patronage of the arts.

Similarly, the question has been raised what should be done if the father is unaware that a son has been born to him, or is prevented from carrying out the circumcision by factors beyond his control.

It is out of this motivation that the child [begins to] study. [The child studies] not because of the essence of the study, for the child has no comprehension of that, but because of the food. Eating these delicacies is more important to him than the actual study...<br/>\nWhen he becomes older and his intellect grows to the point where he realizes the worthlessness of these items, he should be encouraged and motivated to learn by the promise of things he holds dear. His teacher should tell him: ""Study and I will buy you nice shoes or beautiful garments."" Thus, he will study, not for the sake of the study itself, but for the garment, the garment becoming more valuable for him than the Torah...</p>\n<p>The Rambam continues mentioning other factors that may be employed to motivate older children - e.g., money or honor. He concludes:</p>\n<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">All this is degrading. Nevertheless, because of the limits of a person\'s intellect, it may be necessary to make the goal of wisdom something other than wisdom.</p>\n<p>In <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam also emphasizes how a teacher must slowly mold a child\'s character and lead him, step by step, to an appreciation of the proper motives for the service of God:</p>\n<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">As their knowledge grows and their wisdom increases, this secret [service of God for His sake] should be revealed to them [slowly,] bit by bit.

Torah law maintains that a child lacks intellectual maturity (דעת), and thus is incapable of making such a decision.</p>\n<p>', ""Thus, [the minor's] return of the article is not considered to be a return [from a legal perspective]. -</b> i.e., although he has physically returned the article, the child still remains the legal owner.</p>\n<p>The <i>Machaneh Ephraim</i> (<i>Hilchot Meshichah</i> 2) notes that according to Rabbinic law, a child can transfer property that he owns to another. Thus, the Rambam's statements seem to imply that any of the four species that are acquired only according to Rabbinic law may not be used for this mitzvah.</p>\n<p>A very practical point can be derived from this concept. According to Torah law, property that is purchased changes ownership only after it has been paid for. The completion of a transaction when the property are taken by the purchaser (<i>meshichah</i>) is a Rabbinic institution. Accordingly, if a person purchased a lulav and etrog on the condition that he pay for it after the holiday - even though the seller willingly consented - the purchaser has only acquired the lulav and etrog according to Rabbinic law. Thus, based on this halachah, he would not be able to use it for the mitzvah.</p>\n<p>"", 'The above applies to the lulav and to each of the other species of the four taken with it. -</b> The verse quoted above includes all the four species, and not only the lulav.

He quotes the Rashba, who explains that since the etrog was purchased with the intent that it be used by each member of that community, implicit in their agreement is that, on the first day, it will belong to each individual entirely at the time he uses it to fulfill the mitzvah.</p>\n<p>The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 648:7) quotes this statement as halachah. However, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 648:10 raises questions concerning it and suggests that each member of the community should grant his colleague his share as a present.</p>\n<p>', ""Should brothers purchased etrogim from the funds [of their father's] estate, which they have not divided yet: -</b> This is the case mentioned in <i>Bava Batra</i> (ibid.), from which the above principle is derived.

(See <i>Hilchot T\'midim Umusafim</i> 10:6-10.) Indeed, the Talmud (<i>Sukkah</i> 50b; see also the Rambam\'s commentary on the above-mentioned Mishnah) emphasizes that connection, quoting <a href=""/15943#v3"">Isaiah 12:3</a>: ""And you shall draw water with happiness."" However, here, the Rambam makes no mention of that water at all!</p>\n<p>We are forced to say that the Rambam views the verse from Isaiah as a mere <i>asmachtah</i> (an allusion from the Bible with which our Sages connected a verse to an independent concept) and that the celebration came about because of the unique nature of the Sukkot festival. Though this celebration was associated with the water libation, the latter is not the source for the practice. Indeed, the choice of the name <i>Simchat Beit HaSho\'evah</i> (the celebration of the house of drawing the water), and not <i>Simchat Hasho\'evah</i> (the celebration of the drawing of the water) allows for such an interpretation. (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XVII).</p>\n<p>', 'as [<a href=""/9924#v40"">Leviticus 23:40</a>] commands: ""And you shall rejoice</b></p>\n<p>', 'before God, your Lord -</b> i.e., in the Temple</p>\n<p>', 'for seven days."" -</b> Although this verse is used to derive the requirement of taking the lulav in Jerusalem for each of the seven days of the festival (Chapter 7, Halachah 13), its simple meaning remains.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, this charge is not considered to be an independent commandment, but rather an extension (and an intensification) of the mitzvah of celebrating on the festivals. Thus, in <i>Sefer Hamitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 54), the Rambam describes that mitzvah and explains that it includes ""to celebrate with musical instruments and to dance in the Temple....This is <i>Simchat Beit Hasho\'evah</i>.""</p>\n<p>This explanation resolves another question: <i>Mo\'ed Kattan</i> 8b teaches that one celebration should not be interposed upon another. For this reason, weddings are not held during the festivals so that the wedding celebrations should not clash with those of the festival.</p>\n<p>Thus, were one to consider the celebration of <i>Simchat Beit Hasho\'evah</i> as associated with the water offering, one might ask why the Sages instituted such a celebration which might appear to overshadow the celebration of the festival itself. However, the above explanation resolves this difficulty as well, for as stated above, the <i>Simchat Beit Hasho\'evah</i> celebration is an extension of the festival celebrations and not an independent matter.

He placed his own money above and below theirs so that he would suffer any possible loss and not they. Similarly, many leniencies and provisions have been instituted within Torah law to protect the interests of orphans.

The <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> quotes an opinion which maintains that any prohibition that can be violated by speech or thought alone (as is possible in this case) is not liable for lashes even when it is transgressed with a deed. The <i>Avodat HaMelech</i> states that the reason one does not receive lashes is stated by the Rambam himself, namely:</p>\n<p>', 'the retribution one suffers for its [violation] is explicitly stated in the Torah (<i>ibid.</i> 22:23): ""I will display My anger and slay you with the sword."" -</b> and this punishment is more severe than lashes.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 232:2) quotes the Rambam's view. The Ramah brings a third opinion (of the <i>Ba'al HaMa'or</i>) which rules that even a large meal is permissible before <i>Minchah Gedolah</i>, and that a snack is permissible even before <i>Minchah K'tanah</i>. He adds that perhaps the reason for this leniency is that since it was customary to call people to synagogue, it is unlikely that they would not forget to go. However, he advises following the more stringent view when praying alone.</p>\n<p>"", 'If he begins one of these things -</b> Even if he began after the time of <i>Minchah Gedolah</i> and, therefore, his beginning was a transgression (<i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i>).</p>\n<p>', 'he need not stop, but may finish and then recite <i>Minchah</i> -</b> This leniency is also based on the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat, loc. cit.</i>). After listing all the activities that are forbidden once <i>Minchah Gedolah</i> arrives, the Mishnah concludes: ""And if he starts, he need not stop.""</p>\n<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that this is the case only if he will be able to recite <i>Minchah</i> before the conclusion of the appropriate time. To emphasize this point, the Rambam mentions explicitly: ""and then recite <i>Minchah</i>"" - i.e., after he finishes doing whatever it is that he has started doing. However, if there will not be time to pray afterwards, he must stop and pray. Only then may he resume his activity.</p>\n<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 232:2, follows this interpretation of the Rambam and adds that if there will not be time afterwards, one must stop what he is doing immediately. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> points out that this means that even if it is still relatively early, if one is eating and expects the meal to continue until after the time of <i>Minchah</i>, he must stop immediately and pray, rather than wait until sometime later before the end of the day.</p>\n</co:rambam_commentary>\n</div>\n</div>']"
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.6,"['When is the beginning of a haircut? -</b> In Halachah 5, the Rambam taught us that if one had already begun his involvement in any of these activities, he need not stop in order to recite <i>Minchah</i>. Therefore, it is necessary to understand what constitutes involvement in these activities.</p>\n<p>', 'When he puts the barber\'s cloth over his knees -</b> The מעפורת is an apron used to collect the hairs falling from one\'s head during a haircut, so that they do not fall onto his clothes. (<i>Shabbat</i> 9b) In his commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam states that one who has put the cloth over his knees ""is prepared for a haircut."" From that point on, even though no hair has actually been cut, he is considered involved in the haircut, so that he need not stop to pray.</p>\n<p>', 'When is the beginning of a bath? -</b> i.e., when is he considered to be bathing, so that he need not stop to pray?</p>\n<p>', 'When he takes off his underclothes -</b> literally, ""the garments next to his skin."" This is based on the Rambam\'s interpetation of <i>Shabbat</i> 9b: ""When he removes his מעפרתו from himself."" Rashi, in his commentary on that passage, offers a different interpretation - one\'s outermost garment, i.e., the first garment removed. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 232:2) rules in line with Rashi\'s position.</p>\n<p>', 'When is the beginning of [work in the] tanning house? When he ties the apron between his shoulders, as is the way of artisans. -</b> <i>Shabbat</i> 9b states simply: ""When he ties between his shoulders."" In his commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam explains that it is when he ties his belt in order to work with the skins. Evidently this means the belt around his apron. There is a version of the Rambam\'s commentary on the Mishnah which mentions also that he begins working with the skins. This is, however, hard to understand in light of his commentary here in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.</p>\n<p>', ""When is the beginning of eating? For those who live in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, it is when one washes one's hands -</b> <i>Shabbat</i> 9b records a disagreement between Rav and Rabbi Chanina. Rav states that washing one's hands constitutes the beginning of eating, whereas Rabbi Chanina is of the opinion that loosening one's belt before eating is the beginning of the meal. The Talmud concludes that there is no real argument. Rav described the halachah for inhabitants of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, and Rabbi Chanina, for those of Babylonia.</p>\n<p>"", ""For the inhabitants of Babylonia, it is when they loosen their belts -</b> Rashi explains that the custom in Babylonia was to wear their belts particularly tight, necessitating that they be loosened prior to eating. This was not the case in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.</p>\n<p>It is interesting to note that in his commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam mentions only the halachah of washing one's hands. Since the Mishnah was written in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, its interpretation must be in line with the customs and realities of <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. However, in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Rambam focuses on the actual halachah. Hence, he defines the beginning of eating in line with both positions, one relevant to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and the other to Babylonia.</p>\n<p>"", 'When is the beginning of judgment?

That passage states:</p>\n<p class=""rambam_indented"">The Sages produced a support for their words in order that a person not come in from the field in the evening and say: ""I shall go home, eat a little, sleep a little and then recite the <i>Shema</i> and pray,"" lest he be overcome by sleep and sleep all night.<br/>\nRather, he should come from the field in the evening and enter the synagogue.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 6.8,"[""A person who is involved in the study of Torah when the time for prayer arrives must stop and pray -</b> The Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 9b) states that one must stop for <i>Kri'at Shema</i>, but not for prayer.

Rather, the study of Torah is equal to all the other commandments, since study brings one to action. Therefore, study comes before action at all times.""</p>\n<p>A person involved in Torah study achieves a level of unity with God that is unparalleled by any other activity. One\'s intellect and God\'s wisdom become inextricably linked, until they are indistinguishable during the moments of one\'s actual involvement in study. On this basis, we can understand the description of Torah with the metaphor of bread (<a href=""/16380#v5"">Proverbs 9:5</a>, <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 4:13). After bread is consumed by a person, it becomes assimilated into his blood and becomes part of the person himself. Similarly, when Torah is studied, it becomes absorbed into the person\'s character and becomes an integral part of his being (<i>Tanya</i>, Chapter 5).</p>\n<p>As explained in the introduction to this text, prayer focuses on our attempt to relate to the Godliness that permeates our worldly existence. Though this is an extremely significant service, the connection established through Torah study is more complete. Thus, <i>Shabbat</i> 10a records how Ravvah rebuked Rav Hamnuna for neglecting his Torah studies to prolong his prayers. By doing he was ""abandoning eternal life for transcient life."" Therefore, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his colleagues whose commitment to Torah was all encompassing were not required to interrupt their studies for prayer.</p>\n<p>', 'Anyone involved in efforts for the welfare of the community is like one involved in Torah study -</b> i.e., he can be compared to one whose full time occupation is the study of Torah. Therefore, he is exempt from the <i>Amidah</i> at that time.</p>\n<p>This comparison of community work to the study of Torah is found in the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 5:1. However, there it is taught in the context of praying in the midst of words of Torah. (See Chapter 4, Halachah 18.) Community work is also considered like Torah, so that one may pray after such work and it is considered as if he prayed in the midst of words of Torah.</p>\n<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam derives this law from the continuation of the Talmudic passage (<i>Shabbat</i> 11a) cited above. The Talmud states that one involved in the decision of whether or not to proclaim a leap year (עיבור שנה) need not stop to pray, even though Torah study is not his full-time occupation. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> posits that the Rambam views involvement in עיבור שנה as community work.

The Talmud explains that this applies only to a Jewish king, but not to a foreign king. A Jewish king is expected to appreciate the seriousness of prayer and realize that a person\'s unwillingness to interrupt his prayers is not intended as an insult to the king\'s authority, but rather, submission to an even greater authority.</p>\n<p>It is interesting to note that this halachah is taught in the Mishnah within the context of halachot stressing the serious nature of the <i>Amidah</i> and the high level of concentration necessary. Just as we learned that the level of intention necessary for the <i>Amidah</i> is greater than that necessary for <i>Kri\'at Shema</i> (see Chapter 5, Halachah 8 and the commentary there), so too, the halachot regarding interruptions are stricter, as mentioned.</p>\n<p>', 'However, he may interrupt [and answer] a non-Jewish king, lest he -</b> fail to understand the concept explained above and...</p>\n<p>', 'kill him -</b> as a rebel against the king.</p>\n<p><i>Berachot</i> 32b-33a relates the following story which shows that the Sages did not always avail themselves of the leniency granted:</p>\n<p class=""rambam_indented"">A righteous man was once praying on the road.

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> also agrees with this explanation.</p>\n<p>In Chapter 2, Halachot 2-3, the Rambam mentions the text for a shortened prayer. However, there is not necessarily a contradiction between this opinion and that law.</p>\n<p>', 'If unable to do so, he may stop. -</b> <i>Berachot</i> 32b offers these two alternatives.</p>\n<p>Rabbenu Yonah maintains that if possible, one should move slightly in order to avoid confronting the king or tyrant, and thus avoid the need to talk.</p>\n<p>', 'Similarly, if one sees snakes or scorpions approaching him in a place where their bite is fatal, he should stop [praying] and flee.

The Talmud (33a) mentions that a snake does not cause an interruption, but a scorpion does. Rashi explains that though snakes are not likely to bite, scorpions are likely to sting. Thus, the passage raises questions on the Rambam\'s decision, for he does not distinguish between snakes and scorpions.</p>\n<p>The Rambam\'s statements appear to be based on the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 5:1, which states that one ignores a snake only if it is simply curling around his leg. However, were the snake to approach him in a menacing fashion, appearing likely to bite, he may flee from the snake.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that there is no actual need to interrupt his <i>Amidah</i> in the case of the dangerous creatures.

Though he holds that the <i>Amidah</i> is also a Torah obligation (see Chapter 1, Halachah 1), it is only necessary to pray once daily in order to fulfill one\'s Torah obligation.

In Babylon and even in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, the popular spoken language was Aramaic, while many of the Sages preferred to teach in Hebrew. Therefore, they would speak to the spokesman in a hushed tone in Hebrew, and he would translate the teachings to Aramaic and teach them to the public in a loud voice.</p>\n<p>Others maintain that the spokesman was no more than a ""human microphone."" Rather than have the sage weary himself in speaking in a tone which all could hear, he would speak softly, and the spokesman would speak in a tone that all could hear.

Rabbi Shalom Dovber of Lubavitch follows a similar, but not identical, view. In <i>Yom Tov Shel Rosh Hashanah</i> 5666, he elaborates on this concept in detail, explaining that the teacher was on too high a level to explain his ideas in a manner which the common people could understand. Therefore, he would employ a spokesman, who, though he was able to comprehend the teacher\'s statements, was on a level that his explanations would not be too sophisticated for the people to grasp.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 6.10","['If rain descends, a person may enter his home. -</b> The descent of rain on Sukkot implies that our actions are not desired by God. The Mishnah (<i>Sukkah</i> 2:8) compares the matter to a servant who came to serve his master drink and the latter poured the pitcher in his face.</p>\n<p><i>Tzafenat Paneach</i> explains that there is a fundamental difference between this law and the case of a person who is uncomfortable while in the sukkah. In the latter instance, in essence, the person is obligated to fulfill the mitzvah. However, because of his discomfort, his obligation is temporarily waived. In contrast, when rain descends it is impossible to fulfill the mitzvah at all, because the sukkah is not fit to dwell in. Hence, there is no obligation whatsoever.</p>\n<p>There is a practical difference between these two abstract positions regarding the question whether a person is obligated to eat in the sukkah on the first night of the holiday even when it rains. (See the commentary on Halachah 7.) According to the <i>Tzafenat Paneach</i>, under these circumstances there is no mitzvah which one is required to fulfill. Thus, one may eat at home. In contrast, most authorities do not differentiate between rain and other uncomfortable situations. Thus, since eating in the sukkah on that night is a binding obligation, they require a person to fulfill the mitzvah.</p>\n<p>There is a further aspect to this concept. The Maharil explains that a person who eats in a sukkah when he is not obligated to do so is a simple person and receives no reward for his ""piety."" On this basis, in many communities, people make no effort to stay in the sukkah when it rains. In contrast, there are some communities where people will continue to eat in the sukkah despite pouring rain.</p>\n<p>What is the difference between these two approaches? The first approach follows the perspective that, during the rain, there is no mitzvah to dwell in the sukkah whatsoever. Hence, there is no need to strain oneself to remain there. In contrast, the second perspective does not differentiate between rain and any other uncomfortable circumstances, but maintains that, in essence, dwelling in the sukkah is a mitzvah even under such circumstances. Accordingly, they remain in the sukkah, because while they are involved in fulfilling God\'s will they do not feel even the slightest trace of discomfort.</p>\n<p>', 'When is one permitted to leave [the sukkah]? -</b> The Maharil writes that when a person is forced to leave the sukkah because of rain, he should depart with humility rather than with anger.</p>\n<p>', ""when enough raindrops descend into the sukkah so that they would spoil a cooked dish -</b> We need not wait until the food actually spoils.

Even though the grain has been cooked, since the kernels were not processed at all, it does not warrant a blessing of greater importance (<i>Kessef Mishnah</i>).</p>\n<p>The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 208:3-6 discusses the question of grains that are cooked whole, but are cooked for a long period until their shell dissolves. There are authorities who recommend that unless the kernels have been cooked to the extent that they stick together as a single mass, whole grains should be eaten only in the midst of a meal containing bread. See also Halachah 4.</p>\n<p>', 'Afterwards, he should recite the blessing borey nefashot rabbot. -</b> The blessing usually recited after partaking of foods other than those from the seven species for which <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> was praised. The same rationale mentioned above applies. Since the kernels were served without being processed, they do not warrant a blessing of greater importance.</p>\n<p>', 'Before eating flour -</b> which has not been cooked</p>\n<p>', 'a person should recite the blessing shehakol. Afterwards, he should recite the blessing borey nefashot rabbot. -</b> In this instance as well, the special blessings for grain products are not recited because the food was not prepared in the usual fashion. Furthermore, even the blessing <i>borey pri ha\'adamah</i> is not recited, because generally people do not eat flour (Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi, See also <i>Berachot</i> 36a).<br/>\n1. I.e., it resembles a porridge.<br/>\n2. Because of the importance of the five species of grain, the Sages ordained the recitation of a special blessing before and after partaking of them. Since this mixture is considered a food and not a beverage, it warrants the recitation of these blessings.<br/>\n3. Since this mixture is considered a beverage and not a food, it does not warrant the recitation of these blessings.<br/>\n 4. <i>Berachot</i> 37b relates that any food that is made from the five species of grain but is not considered bread requires the blessing <i>al hamichyah</i>. Since these foods are cooked in a pot, they are not considered bread. See also note 6.<br/>\n5. Since the grain kernels have been processed slightly, they are considered worthy of the special blessings ordained for foods from the five species. As mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 2, the later authorities suggest that the grains be cooked to the point that they stick together as a single mass before these blessings should be recited. If, however, both the shell of the kernel has been removed and they have been crushed, the blessing <i>al hamichyah</i> may be recited even when the kernels do not stick together (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 208:15).<br/>\n6. As mentioned in Halachah 6, as long as the grain is included to add flavor, it is considered the primary element in the mixture, and the blessing <i>al hamichyah</i> should be recited, even though quantitatively, the dish contains a majority of other substances. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 208:2.)<br/>\n 7. The definition of foods as primary and secondary depends on the person\'s intention and not the quantity of the foods included in the mixture.<br/>\n8. This principle is quoted from the Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 6:7.<br/>\n9. Thus producing a single food, as exemplified in Halachah 6.<br/>\n10. In this instance, the two foods remain separate, yet the secondary food is included in the blessing recited over the primary one, as exemplified in Halachah 7.<br/>\n 11. The Rambam is quoting <i>Berachot</i> 39a, which states that this law applies even to turnips that require a large amount of flour.<br/>\n12. <i>Beitzah</i> 38a states, ""Anything added for flavor is never considered negligible.""</p>\n<p>The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 204:25 and the <i>Chacham Tzvi</i> (Responsum 129) explain that the Rambam\'s (and the Talmud\'s) statements apply only to products from the five species of grain. Whenever they are added to flavor foods, they are considered of primary importance even when, quantitatively, they are less than the other ingredients of a particular dish. In contrast, when two or more types of foods other than grain products are mixed together in a single dish and both are intended to add flavor and/or satiate the person eating, the food which is greater in quantity is considered as the primary ingredient.</p>\n<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> adds that if the starch was added for flavor, the mixture would require the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i>. He continues, explaining that when other foods - e.g., fruits which are not usually eaten raw, are cooked in sugar to produce jam, the fruits are considered of primary importance. Hence, the blessing <i>borey pri ha\'etz</i> should be recited. See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 204:11.<br/>\n 14. By adding the clause, ""so that the heavy brine...,"" the Rambam explains the source for this ruling, <i>Berachot</i> 6:7, and clarifies a problem posed by the commentaries.</p>\n<p>Although the Mishnah mentions the example of bread serving as a secondary food when it accompanies salted foods, the Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 44a) protests, and explains that in almost all situations bread would be considered the primary food. The Mishnah is describing a specific instance: people who eat fruit that originates in the area around Lake Kineret.</p>\n<p>In his Commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam explains that this refers to people who work as watchmen in orchards. They eat large quantities of fruit. Hence, in order to help their digestion, they also must partake of brine. Since the brine itself could be harmful, they eat bread with it.</p>\n<p>Here, also, the Rambam is referring to a case where the person has no desire to eat bread and does so only to protect his throat. If, however, a person wanted to eat salted fish on bread and desired both the bread and the fish, he must recite the blessing <i>hamotzi</i> and recite grace. (See <i>Turei Zahav</i> 212:1-2.)</p>\n<p><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 212:2 gives another example: A person who eats bread to weaken the taste of an alcoholic beverage.<br/>\n<br/>\n 16. A <i>k\'zayit</i>. In contemporary measure, it is equivalent to 28.8 cc according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i> and 33 cc according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>.<br/>\n17. Out of faithfulness to the Rambam\'s text, we have translated his words literally, although they have caused the commentaries great difficulty. On the surface, there is an open contradiction between the first clause and the second clause. From the first clause, it appears that a piece of bread less than the size of an olive which resembles bread warrants the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>. In contrast, the latter clause appears to indicate that the bread must both be the size of an olive and have the appearance of bread to warrant the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>.</p>\n<p>Because of this difficulty, the Radbaz (Vol. V, Responsum 1393) and <i>Sefer HaBatim</i> have suggested amending the text and rendering the latter clause, ""If they are not the size of an olive and no longer resemble bread because of the cooking process."" Furthermore, even without amending the text, this interpretation can be accepted, since, as the Rambam\'s own descendant, Rabbi Yehoshua, explains, there are times when the Hebrew או can be rendered as ""if."" Thus, the passage would read, ""If they are not the size of an olive, if....""</p>\n<p>Rav Yosef Karo was aware of the text\'s difficulty and the suggestions to amend it. Nevertheless, both in his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 168:10), he seeks to justify the Rambam\'s choice of phraseology, explaining his statements as follows:</p>\n<p>When one cooked pieces of bread or mixed them into soup, if they are the size of an olive, one should recite the blessing <i>hamotzi</i> although they no longer resemble bread. If they are less than the size of an olive but resemble bread, one should recite this blessing when they have been mixed into soup. If, however, they have been cooked, and although it is obvious that these pieces came from a loaf of bread, they no longer have the appearance of bread, only the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> should be recited.</p>\n<p>To summarize: when one breaks bread into pieces and puts them into soup, since the pieces still resemble bread they may not be eaten unless one recites the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>. If the pieces of bread were cooked completely to prepare a different food and less than a <i>k\'zayit</i> remains whole, the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> should be recited. According to most authorities, if one cooks with bread crumbs or matzah meal, the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i>, should be recited on the foods produced.</p>\n</co:rambam_commentary>\n</div>\n</div>']"

To explain: Following the verse quoted here by the Rambam as a proof-text, the Torah continues [<a href=""/9938#v10"">Numbers 10:10</a>]: ""On the days of your rejoicing, on your festivals, and on your new moon [celebrations], you shall sound the trumpets for your burnt offerings and for your peace offerings.""</p>\n<p>In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We are commanded to sound the trumpets in the Temple when offering sacrifices that are offered only at appointed times....

In the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, when listing the 613 mitzvot at the beginning of the text, the Rambam mentions the sounding of the trumpets both for the sacrifices and in times of distress. Nevertheless, further on in the beginning of the text, when delineating the mitzvot according to subjects, he places the emphasis on crying out to God at a time of distress (seemingly, including crying out verbally and crying out with the trumpets in the same mitzvah). Significantly, in <i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i>, Chapter 3, where the Rambam mentions the practice of sounding the trumpets in connection with the offering of the sacrifices, he does not mention it as a component of this or any other specific mitzvah.</p>\n<p>(Note also the commentary of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, which questions why these two different rites were included as a single mitzvah at the outset. Even in the Torah, they are included in two separate verses.)</p>\n<p>', 'to cry out -</b> in prayer.

The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> also notes this opinion and states that either instrument, a shofar or a trumpet, is acceptable, but that - outside of the Temple premises - only one of the two should be used in time of distress.

Nor is its observance dependent on the existence of the Temple, nor does the Rambam specify that it must be fulfilled only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. (In this regard, there are differing opinions; see <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 576:1) Accordingly, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 576:1 questions: Why is the rite of sounding the trumpets (or shofarot) not observed at present?</p>\n<p>The resolution of this question lies in the Rambam\'s words, ""any difficulty that arises which affects the community.""

There are, however, other Rabbinic opinions - which are also supported by different manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> (see the commentary on Chapter 3, Halachah 3) - that maintain that a series of communal fasts should always begin on a Monday.</p>\n</co:rambam_commentary>\n</div>\n</div>""]"
Fasts 1.6,"['A communal fast should not be decreed on a Sabbath, nor on a festival -</b> for the reasons mentioned above.</p>\n<p>The <i>Merchevat HaMishneh HaSefaradit</i> raises a question regarding this statement. From the previous halachah, it would appear that a communal fast is ordained only on Mondays and Thursdays, and from this halachah one might assume that, since it is necessary to exclude the Sabbath, such a fast might be ordained for other days.</p>\n<p>In resolution, it is explained that the previous halachah refers only to the thirteen communal fasts instituted when the rains fail to descend. When a difficulty of another nature arises, a fast may be instituted on a day other than Monday or Thursday. Alternatively, it can be explained that if the difficulty is not a matter of immediate emergency, the fast is put off for a Monday, as mentioned above. In the case of an immediate emergency, however, a fast may be held on any day other than those mentioned in this and the following halachah.</p>\n<p>', 'On these days, neither a shofar nor a trumpet should be sounded, nor do we cry out [to God] or offer supplications in prayer. -</b> Because of the atmosphere of rest and pleasure that permeates the Sabbath, it is improper to make requests about matters that are not immediate necessities.

In his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Karo brings support for the omission of this phrase, noting that in <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 2:24 and 30:12, where the Rambam discusses praying to God in the event of such imminent disasters on the Sabbath, he does not mention fasting. Hence, when mentioning appealing to God with regard to these difficulties on the Sabbath in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (288:9, 576:12), Rav Yosef Karo omits the mention of fasting.</p>\n<p>', 'cry out [to God], and offer supplications on their behalf in prayer. -</b> <i>Ta\'anit</i> 14a states that this refers to the addition of the prayer <i>Anenu</i>. According to the authorities who maintain that we may fast on the Sabbath (and even according to some who forbid fasting), this refers to the blessing <i>Anenu</i> added to the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>). According to the other opinions, it refers to the seven blessings mentioned in Chapter 4 that begin ""May He who answered... answer you"" (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</p>\n<p>', '[The trumpets] should not be sounded -</b> Sounding a trumpet is not one of the forbidden Sabbath labors; it is, nevertheless, forbidden because of a Rabbinical decree (see <i>Hilchot Shofar</i> 2:7).</p>\n<p>', ""for them -</b> as an expression of prayer to arouse God's mercies.</p>\n<p>"", 'however, unless they are being sounded to gather together the people to help them and [try to] save them. -</b> I.e., they may be sounded as an alarm to call people to come to their assistance, for the Sabbath laws may be violated for the sake of saving lives (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</p>\n<p>Note Chapter 2, Halachah 14, which states that if a community\'s source of sustenance is threatened מתריעים (the verb that generally means ""we sound the trumpets"") on the Sabbath.

If so, how can the authorship of the latter two of them be attributed to Joshua, David, and Solomon, who lived in later generations?</p>\n<p>The Ramban in his <i>Hasagot</i> explains that, although the fundamental obligation to recite these blessings originates in the Torah, the basic form of the text of these blessings was ordained by each of these prophets in his time. Beforehand, each person would recite the grace in his own words. (See also the commentary on the following halachah.)</p>\n<p>The Ramban also explains that, after the destruction of the Temple, a prayer that it be rebuilt was included in the third blessing. In this context, it is also worthy to question whether Ezra and the Men of the Great Assembly also made any changes in the grace when they arranged all the prayers and blessings, as mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 5 and commentary. (See <i>Kochba d\'Shavit</i>.)</p>\n<p>', 'and the fourth by the Sages of the <i>Megillah</i>. -</b> <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) relates that the Sages instituted this blessing on the day the Romans granted permission for the dead of Beitar to be buried. This city had served as the capital of Bar Kochba\'s revolt against Rome and had exacted a heavy toll of legionnaires while making a valiant defense. When the city finally fell, the Romans slew hundreds of thousands mercilessly, the extent of the carnage staggering all chroniclers. As a further measure of punishment to its inhabitants, they refused to allow them to be buried.</p>\n<p>Years passed before such permission was granted. When the Romans finally granted the Sages permission to bury these people, they were amazed at the wondrous miracle their eyes beheld. The corpses had remained whole. They had neither rotted, nor been eaten by predators. In appreciation of this Divine kindness, the Sages instituted this blessing, praising God for being ""good"" (for preventing them from rotting) and ""doing good"" (for allowing the corpses to be buried).</p>\n</co:rambam_commentary>\n</div>\n</div>']"
Blessings 2.2,"['When workers are employed by an employer and eat a meal of bread, they should not recite a blessing before eating. -</b> The obligation to recite the blessing before eating is Rabbinic in origin.

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> offers a different rationale, explaining that the Rambam did not state that the Torah requires that a specific number of blessings be recited for grace.</p>\n<p>The <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> clarifies the matter further, explaining that the Rambam maintains that the Torah requires us to mention three concepts in grace: appreciation for the sustenance God grants us, appreciation for <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, and appreciation for Jerusalem. According to the Torah, it does not matter how these three concepts are mentioned, whether in one blessing (as in <i>al hamichyah</i>), two blessings (as in this law), or three blessings (as is the usual case).</p>\n<p>', ""so that they do not neglect their employer's work. -</b> From this we learn two concepts:<br/>\na) that it is forbidden to work while reciting grace (Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 2:5; <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 183:12);<br/>\nb) how important it is for a worker to devote himself faithfully to his work. See the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Sechirut</i>.</p>\n<p>"", '[In such an instance,] the complete text of the first blessing should be recited. -</b> Rashi, <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), explains that this distinction is made because the latter two blessings resemble each other, and hence can be combined with little difficulty.

Blessings 2.3,"['The blessing for Eretz Yisrael should include an acknowledgement of thanks [to God] at its beginning and at its conclusion. -</b> In ""The Order of Prayers for the Entire Year,"" the Rambam relates that this blessing begins, ""We offer thanks to You, God, our Lord..."" and states, shortly before its conclusion, ""For all these, God, our Lord, we give thanks to You.""

You shall keep My covenant....

Other authorities (including the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 187:3) differ and require the repetition of grace in such an instance.</p>\n<p>', 'mentioning the covenant before the Torah. [The reason for this order -</b> which gives priority to the covenant</p>\n<p>', 'is] that the covenant mentioned in the blessing for Eretz Yisrael refers to the covenant of circumcision, concerning which thirteen covenants [are mentioned in the Torah]. -</b> Note the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Milah</i>, where the Rambam enumerates these thirteen expressions.</p>\n<p>', 'In contrast, [the Torah mentions only] three covenants with regard to the Torah, as [<a href=""/9992#v69"">Deuteronomy 28:69</a>] states: ""These are the words of the covenant... in addition to the covenant He established with you at Chorev,"" and [<a href=""/9993#v9"">Deuteronomy 29:9</a>-11] states: ""You are standing... to establish a covenant."" -</b> The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> notes that there are several other verses that refer to a covenant with regard to the Torah. These three, however, are unique in that they refer to the establishment of a covenant regarding the bond between the Jews and the Torah.<br/>\n1. <i>Berachot</i> 49a mentions both these possibilities. In ""The Order of Prayers for the Entire Year,"" the Rambam quotes the former expression.<br/>\n2. The beginning of a blessing must share the same theme as its conclusion. Nevertheless, the rebuilding of Jerusalem shares a connection with God\'s showing mercy to the people of Israel, since the rebuilding of Jerusalem is an expression of God\'s mercy to the Jewish people (<i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>).<br/>\n3. Although <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions that two different concepts should not be mentioned in the conclusion of a blessing, this version of the blessing does not contradict that rule. The intent is a single request that Israel be granted the ultimate comfort, the rebuilding of Jerusalem.<br/>\n4. Rashi, <i>Berachot</i> 48b, mentions another reason for the mention of the House of David. It was David who conquered Jerusalem and established the holiness of the city.<br/>\n 5. Since an integral element of our celebration of the Sabbath and festivals is eating festive meals, the sacred element of the day should be mentioned in the grace recited after partaking of those meals. Nevertheless, the uniqueness of the day does not require a blessing in its own right, nor is it made the essential element of the third blessing. Therefore, one begins and concludes that blessing in the same manner as is done during the week (Rashi, <i>Tosafot, Berachot</i> 48b).<br/>\n6. The order in which these alternatives are mentioned in this halachah is the reverse of that mentioned in the previous halachah. It can be explained that in the previous halachah, the Rambam mentioned the text he considered most appropriate first. The order he mentions in this halachah, however, is closer to the expression used by our Sages in <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the source for this halachah.<br/>\n7. Pesach, Shavuot, and Sukkot. With regard to Rosh HaShanah, see the commentary on Halachah 13.<br/>\n8. <i>Shabbat</i> 24a explains that since an additional sacrifice (<i>korban musaf</i>) is offered on these days, they possess an element of sanctity that is worthy of mention. As obvious from the contrast of Halachah 12 to Halachah 13, however, there is a difference between the obligation to mention these days and the obligation to mention Sabbaths and festivals.<br/>\n 9. Since Chanukah and Purim are Rabbinic holidays which are not associated with an additional sacrificial offering, they are not mentioned in the third blessing. The second blessing is more appropriate for the mention of the miracles of these holidays, since it is an expression of thanks to God (<i>Shabbat</i> 24a).</p>\n<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> note that from <i>Shabbat</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), it would appear that while permission is granted to mention Chanukah and Purim in the second blessing, it is not an obligation to do so. In contrast, the Rambam requires that they be mentioned. They explain that since the Sages of the Talmud were wont to mention these holidays in grace, and the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 7:6) considers their mention a binding obligation, the Rambam established their mention as a requirement. See also Halachah 13 and commentary.<br/>\n10. Precedence is given to the Sabbath because it occurs more frequently than the festivals and is on a higher spiritual level (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br/>\n 11. ""Blessed are You, God, our Lord, 16King13 of the Universe, the God, who is our Father and our 16King13... the 16King13 who is good."" The reason for this stress on God\'s sovereignty in this blessing is that the blessing recited previously mentions the sovereignty of the House of David, and the Sages wanted to emphasize how all earthly kings are subordinate to a higher authority (<i>Berachot</i> 49a).<br/>\n12. The blessing mentioned is quoted from <i>Berachot</i> 46a. That source also contains additions to the blessing that Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi would recite.<br/>\n 13. The Rambam\'s words are quoted from <i>Berachot</i> 46b, which relates that Mar Zutra recited this blessing.</p>\n<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De\'ah</i> 379:14) relates that this blessing should be recited throughout the seven days of mourning by the mourners and by all who recite grace together with him when there is a <i>zimun</i>. Other opinions (based on <i>Ketubot</i> 8a) state that this blessing should be recited only when ten people recite grace together. The <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 207:7 writes that it is Ashkenazic custom to rely on this opinion, and hence, this blessing is generally not recited.<br/>\n14. <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) relates several additions Mar Zutra made on the above occasion.<br/>\n15. In ""The Order of Prayers for the Entire Year,"" the Rambam includes several requests beginning with the word <i>Harachaman</i> (May the Merciful One...) in his text of grace. These requests were additions to the grace made by the Geonim, who lived in the era subsequent to the Talmud.<br/>\n 16. This refers to the final blessing quoted in Halachah 11.<br/>\n17. <i>Nisu\'in</i> (marriage) is marked by the entry of a bride and groom into a private chamber together. This ceremony is referred to as <i>chuppah</i> and is accompanied by a celebration. See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i>, Chapter 10, and commentaries.</p>\n<p>As mentioned at the conclusion of the following halachah, according to the Rambam this blessing is recited only when ten adult males are present. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 62:4) differs and maintains that it should be recited even when fewer than ten people are present. Note the Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 62:7) who states that today this blessing is never recited alone. If ""new faces"" - people who had not attended the wedding celebrations previously - are present, all seven blessings are recited. If no ""new faces"" are present (although ten males are), the meal is considered like a meal eaten by the bridegroom alone, and the blessing is not recited.<br/>\n18. The same laws applying to a widow or widower apply to a person who has been divorced. Significantly, in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 10:12, the Rambam states that even if a woman has been married before, her husband should celebrate with her for three days.<br/>\n19. Surely, this also applies when neither the bride nor groom have been married before. <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states: ""The Sages ordained that everyone who marries a maiden should celebrate with her for seven days.""</p>\n<p>The differences between the time limits mentioned in this halachah and those mentioned in Chapter 5, Halachah 5, are worthy of comparison. See the commentary on that halachah.<br/>\n20. <i>Ketubot</i> 8a states that after the first day of the wedding celebrations, Rav Ashi would recite the wedding blessings only when ""new faces"" were present. In his responsa, the Rambam\'s son states that his father required only two ""new faces."" Note the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 64:7 who requires only one ""new face."" The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> write that on the Sabbath the presence of new guests is not necessary, since the Sabbath itself is considered as ""guests.""<br/>\n21. <i>Ketubot</i> 7b derives this rule from the account of the wedding between Ruth and Boaz. <a href=""/16456#v2"">Ruth 4:2</a> relates that Boaz invited ten men to witness the marriage.<br/>\n<br/>\n 22. Only six blessings are mentioned below; the seventh blessing is the blessing over the wine. (See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 10:4.)<br/>\n23. Rashi (<i>Ketubot</i> 7b) explains that this blessing is in praise of the creation of Adam, the first man.</p>\n<p>In <i>Hilchot Ishut</i>, where the text of the wedding blessings is repeated, this blessing follows the blessing ""who has created all things for His glory."" This order is the sequence in which these blessings are recited today. It appears more appropriate, particularly according to Rashi\'s commentary (<i>loc. cit.</i>), which explains that the blessing ""who has created all things..."" is not directly connected to the wedding itself, but rather is recited in appreciation of the guests who have come to celebrate together with the new couple.</p>\n<p>[The repetition of the text of the blessings in two separate halachot, something very out of character for the Rambam in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, has aroused the attention of the commentaries. Some have gone so far as to suggest that the text of the blessings here was added by the printers, and not by the Rambam himself.]<br/>\n24. Despite the fact that this blessing follows two (or three) blessings which begin with ""Blessed...,"" it also begins with ""Blessed...."" Among the explanations offered is that the first blessings are short, and if the line ""Blessed..."" were not mentioned, they would appear as a single blessing (<i>Tosafot, Ketubot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>).<br/>\n25. Rashi (<i>loc. cit.</i>) interprets this as a reference to the creation of woman, who was created from man (""his own self""), and gives him the potential for reproduction (""a structure that will last for all time"").<br/>\n26. ""The barren one"" refers to Jerusalem. <a href=""/16358#v6"">Psalms 137:6</a> states: ""Let my tongue cleave to my palate if I do not place Jerusalem above my highest joy."" Thus, at the height of the wedding celebration, we recall the holy city and pray that it be rebuilt.<br/>\n 27. This is a prayer that the bride and groom enjoy the happiness experienced by Adam in Eve before the first sin.</p>\n<p>Several manuscripts and early printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> mention a different conclusion for this blessing, ""Blessed are You, God, who brings joy to His people, Israel, and rebuilds Jerusalem."" (In this context, note the commentary of the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>.)<br/>\n28. The blessing joins our wishes for the happiness of the particular couple with our hope for the Messianic redemption and the rebuilding of Jerusalem. The ultimate marriage relationship is the bond between God and the Jewish people, which will be realized in the Messianic age. Thus, the two themes, marriage and redemption, share an intrinsic link.<br/>\n29. Rashi, <i>Ketubot</i> 8a, explains the difference between the last two blessings. The fifth of the blessings concludes with a request that the bride and groom enjoy a lifetime of happiness and success together. The sixth and final blessing concludes with a request that they find happiness in each other, that their wedding joy be extended throughout their lives. Alternatively, the final blessing is a blessing for the Jewish people as a whole who find fulfillment in married life.</p>\n</co:rambam_commentary>\n</div>\n</div>']"

Rabbenu Nissim\'s position is somewhat difficult to accept, since the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Megillah</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>), the source for this law, was written several hundred years after Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi granted this leniency.

Thus, were such a transaction to be carried out between Jews, the Ra'avad maintains that the security would never become the lender's property. However, he explains that this law applies only regarding business dealings carried out between Jews, and not to those involving gentiles. Therefore, in this instance, the chametz given as security becomes the gentile's property.</p>\n<p>In contrast, the Rambam does not consider such an agreement an <i>Asmachtah</i>.

However, if he fails to so, they allow people to rely on the Ra'avad's opinion and benefit from the chametz.</p>\n<p>Different laws apply to chametz given to a Jew as security by a gentile or by another Jew. In the former instance, a Jew is considered the owner of the chametz if the agreement included the clause specifying retroactive ownership, even though the time for payment is not fixed until after Pesach. If the agreement lacked that clause, and the Jew is not held responsible for the chametz (see Halachah 3 above), the Jew is not liable for that chametz (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>).

Indeed, in <i>Hilchot Ma\'achalot Asurot</i> 16:10, when discussing the prohibitions of a דבר חשוב (a forbidden substance whose importance prevents it from ever being nullified in a mixture), the Rambam himself appears to follow this view, stating:</p>\n<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">If one pomegranate from a mixture [containing a forbidden pomegranate] falls together with two other pomegranates... and from these three, one pomegranate falls together with other pomegranates, the latter [mixture] is permitted.</p>\n<p>Indeed, on the basis of the statements in <i>Hilchot Ma\'achalot Asurot</i>, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De\'ah</i> 140) deviates from the Rambam\'s opinion and requires three mixtures.</p>\n<p>This approach, however, is not followed by all commentaries. Rashi and <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Zevachim</i>, ibid.) explain that even with regard to a דבר חשוב, only two mixtures are necessary. These views are quoted as halachah by the <i>Turei Zahav</i> and the <i>Siftei Cohen</i> in their glosses on the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De\'ah</i> 110:8).</p>\n<p>Among the suggestions made by the commentaries to resolve the difference between the Rambam\'s statements here and those in <i>Hilchot Ma\'achalot Asurot</i> are the following:<br/>\na) Most people are careful regarding the prohibition against benefiting from any object connected with idol worship. Therefore, there is no need to reinforce the prohibition. In contrast, the prohibition against benefiting from a דבר חשוב is far less known. Hence, the Rabbis added severe safeguards to make sure that it be observed (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br/>\nb) Here, the Rambam is speaking about a prohibition against benefiting from a forbidden object (איסור הנאה). In contrast, <i>Hilchot Ma\'achalot Asurot</i> is concerned with partaking of forbidden foods, where the prohibition is more severe (<i>Siftei Cohen</i>, <i>Yoreh De\'ah</i> 110:52).</p>\n<p>Even the authorities who permit the second mixture to be used do not allow a single individual to partake of the entire mixture at one time. In such an instance, there would be only a single doubt whether he used the forbidden object or not.</p>\n<p>The Rabbis (<i>Zevachim</i>, 74b) mentioned another example of a mixture which is permitted because of circumstances which create a doubt whether our original suspicion continues to apply:</p>\n<p><b>Should a ring [used to adorn] an idol become mixed together with one hundred other rings, and -</b> they would thus all be forbidden according to the above principles. However, if</p>\n<p><b>then two of them fall -</b> accidentally.

If two merely become separated from the group, the others remain prohibited (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, ibid.). (Note the <i>Kessef Mishneh\'s</i> comments that here, the Dead Sea is intended.)</p>\n<p><b>it is permissible to use all of them. -</b> i.e., all the rings that remain. The prohibition does not continue to apply, because</p>\n<p><b>We presume that the [forbidden] ring was among the two -</b> The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that when stating a similar law in <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 15:2, the Rambam required only a single barrel of wine to be lost. The difference between these two laws can be resolved by taking into account the nature of the prohibited substances: Rings are small, and the loss of a single ring does not make a substantial difference to the entire group. In contrast, barrels of wine are large, and the loss of even one will attract attention.</p>\n<p>[which fell]. - The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De\'ah</i> 140) limits this leniency, stating that it is forbidden to use a single ring alone, nor may one person benefit from the entire group of rings at once.</p>\n<p>The Rabbis (<i>Zevachim</i>, ibid.) mentioned a third example of a mixture which is permitted because of circumstances which create a doubt whether our original suspicion continues to apply:</p>\n<p><b>Should [a forbidden ring] become mixed together with a hundred others and -</b> they would thus be forbidden according to the above principles. However, if</p>\n<p><b>then [the group] becomes divided, forty -</b> i.e., the minority</p>\n<p><b>being separated in one group, and sixty -</b> i.e., the majority</p>\n<p><b>in another, and then the entire [group of] forty fall into another group of rings, it is permissible to use all of them -</b> the second mixture.</p>\n<p><b>We presume that the forbidden ring remained among the majority. -</b> There is a doubt whether the forbidden ring was among the forty. Even if it had been included within that forty, perhaps the ring one chooses from the second mixture is not the forbidden one.</p>\n<p>In this instance, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De\'ah</i> 140) does not accept the Rambam\'s view, and forbids the second mixture.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.2,"[""[Then,] -</b> <i>Berachot</i> 60b states that one first recites <i>Kri'at Shema</i> and then, the blessing of <i>hamapil</i> (the blessing discussed in Halachah 1). This opinion is quoted by the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 239:1). However, this order is only followed in Nusach Ari. Both Nusach Ashkenaz and Nusach Sephard follow the order stated by the Rambam.</p>\n<p>The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 1:1) relates that Rav Zeira was accustomed to recite the <i>Shema</i> over and over until he fell asleep. This indicates that the <i>Shema</i> is the last thing said at night before sleeping (<i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> in the name of Rabbenu Nissim Gaon).</p>\n<p>"", 'one reads the first section -</b> This is consistent with our text of <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) which states that, before going to sleep, one recites ""from <i>Shema</i> until <i>V\'haya im shamoa</i>.""

Rabbenu Asher also follows this position.</p>\n<p>The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (239:1) quotes the <i>Ari</i>, Rabbi Yitzchok Luria, as requiring the recitation of all three sections of the <i>Shema</i> so that the 248 words it contains will guard the 248 limbs of the body during sleep.

Our Sages interpreted ""Speak in your heart"" and ""upon your bed"" as allusions to the phrases ""with all your heart"" and ""upon your bed"" in the<i>Shema</i>.</p>\n<p>That Talmudic passage implies that the reason for reciting the <i>Shema</i> before retiring is to protect oneself from undesirable influences during the night. According to Rashi (<i>Berachot</i> 2a) and others who allow the evening service to be recited before sunset, the recitation of <i>Shema</i> before retiring enables us to fulfill the mitzvah of <i>Kri\'at Shema</i> at night. According to the writings of the Ari, the reciting of the <i>Shema</i> before retiring is a service of spiritual preparation for the soul\'s ascent from the body during sleep.</p>\n<p>Since <i>Berachot</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) mentions that ""it is a mitzvah"" to recite the <i>Shema</i> before retiring, it was customary in certain communities to recite a blessing before reciting the <i>Shema</i> as is customary before performing other mitzvot.

They would wash their hands [at night before sleep] and would be able to maintain a state [of purity] such that they could recite the blessings in the morning in cleanliness. We, however, are unable to maintain this state of cleanliness. Therefore, it is proper that we recite them only after נטילת ידים (the washing of the hands).</p>\n<p>This position is widely accepted and is the basis of our practice today.

Furthermore, in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 1:5, the Rambam writes that, unless a blessing follows another blessing, it must mention God\'s sovereignty over the world and no such mention is made in this blessing.</p>\n<p>The <i>Meiri</i> in his commentary to <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) offers the following resolution to these difficulties: Despite the fact that the entire period of a person\'s sleep divides between the recitation of <i>hamapil</i> and <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i>, the sleep is not considered as an interruption and <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i> is considered as following directly after <i>hamapil</i>. Accordingly, it is not required to begin with <i>Baruch</i> or mention God\'s sovereignty.</p>\n<p>Other commentaries who follow different halachic perspectives than the Rambam offer these resolutions:<br/>\n1) <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i> is a blessing of praise and prayer and does not require an opening phrase of blessing, in the same way that the blessing recited before travelling does not (<i>Tosafot, Pesachim</i> 104b).<br/>\n2) <i>E-lohai Neshamah</i> is generally recited immediately after the blessing of אשר יצר and therefore can be considered as a blessing which follows another blessing.</p>\n<p>', 'the soul that You have placed within me -</b> Each morning, we renew our thanks for the soul which God has returned to us, refreshed and revitalized.</p>\n<p>', 'is pure. -</b> Despite his lowly physical state, man possesses an innate spirituality, a pure Godly soul, which is the source of all his positive actions and thoughts.</p>\n<p>', 'You have created it, You have formed it, You have breathed it into me -</b> The three verbs used in this blessing correspond to three different descriptions of the creation of man in the Torah:<br/>\n1) ויברא א-להים את האדם - ""And the Lord created man"" (<a href=""/8165#v27"">Genesis 1:27)</a>.<br/>\n2) א-להים את האדם וייצר ה\' - ""And God, the Lord, formed man"" (<a href=""/8166#v7"">Genesis 2:7)</a>.<br/>\n3) ויפח באפיו נשמת חיים - ""And He blew into his nostrils the soul of life"" (<i>ibid.</i>).</p>\n<p>These three verbs also relate to the three components of the soul, נפש, רוח, ונשמה (<i>Maharsha, 14Berachot</i> 60b).</p>\n<p>In Kabbalah, the three verbs are understood as referring to the three worlds: עולם הבריאה - the world of creation, עולם היצירה - the world of form, and עולם העשיה - the world of physical action.

Our Sages required that we recite three blessings each morning. Torah law states that whenever a single blessing covers two different circumstances, the second blessing may not be recited. Therefore, since a statement thanking God ""for making me a Jew"" would make the blessing for ""not making me a servant"" superfluous, it is preferable to recite this blessing using the negative formula.</p>\n<p>', 'Blessed are You, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has not made me a woman -</b> A woman is not obligated to fulfill all the positive mitzvot whose performance is limited to a specific time.

Like women, a Canaanite servant is exempt from all the positive mitzvot whose performance is limited to a specific time.</p>\n<p>The published text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> and <i>Menachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) list these blessings in this order. However, the authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, Rav Yitzchok Alfasi, and most siddurim today reverse the sequence of the last two blessings.

He explains the reasons why he favors the latter version:</p>\n<p class=""rambam_indented"">This [wording] alludes to our recognition that God gave us the Torah so that we will learn to do everything it states. [The blessing is a request] that He open our hearts to the study of Torah, for this was the reason it was given to us as a heritage.<br/>\nHowever, to conclude [the blessing with] ""who teaches Torah..."" is incorrect, for God... does not teach us the Torah.

He explains that this is because this blessing is also often recited in isolation, before the reading of the Torah in the synagogue.</p>\n<p>The recitation of the blessings of the Torah is very important. <i>Bava Metzia</i> 85a states that Eretz Yisrael was destroyed because the Jews forsook the Torah.

A person who studies Torah without reciting the blessings fails to realize its holiness and sanctity, therefore, it is considered as if he """"forsook the Torah.\'\'</p>\n</co:rambam_commentary>\n</div>\n</div>']"
Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 7.11,"['One is obligated to recite these three blessings -</b> The nature of this obligation is debated among the commentaries. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 47) and others understand the Rambam as considering these blessings similar to any other blessing recited before the performance of a mitzvah and hence, of Rabbinic origin.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, <i>Berachot</i> 21a and <i>Yoma</i> 37a state that the obligation to recite a blessing on Torah study stems from the Torah itself. In keeping with this view, the Ramban (<i>Hosafot</i> to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, positive commandment 15) reckons the recitation of the blessings of the Torah as a separate mitzvah.</p>\n<p>', 'every day. -</b> Perhaps with the words ""every day,"" the Rambam is implying that these blessings should be recited even if one does not sleep at night. See <i>Magen Avraham</i> 47:11.</p>\n<p>The blessings are recited only once a day. In contrast to the blessings recited over other mitzvot, even if one interrupts his study and occupies himself with other matters, one need not recite a second blessing. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 4:7 gives two reasons for this difference:<br/>\n1) The blessings before the Torah resemble the other morning blessings. A person enjoys the benefits associated with the morning blessings intermittently throughout the day, yet he only recites the blessings once in the morning. Similarly, though one may study at several different occasions in a single day, the blessings are recited only once daily.<br/>\n2) The obligation to study Torah is incumbent upon one throughout the entire day and, at all times, one\'s attention should be on one\'s studies.</p>\n<p>', 'Afterwards, one should read a few words of Torah. -</b> If these blessings are comparable to other blessings recited before the performance of mitzvot, the mitzvah (studying Torah) must also be fulfilled immediately after the recitation of the blessing (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</p>\n<p>', '[To fulfill this obligation,] the people adopted the custom of reading the Priestly Blessing. -</b> The Priestly Blessing is found in <a href=""/9934#v22"">Numbers 6:22</a>-27. <i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 11b) also mentions the custom of reciting the Priestly Blessing each morning and Rav Amram Gaon includes the Priestly Blessing in his siddur.</p>\n<p>The <i>Avudraham</i> mentions that the recitation of these verses arouses Divine blessing for the Jewish people.

Therefore, our custom is to recite these blessings standing (<i>Or Zerua</i>).</p>\n<p>The <i>Pri Chadash</i> takes issue with this view and maintains that these blessings were instituted by the <i>Geonim</i> after the conclusion of the Talmud. Though the <i>Or Zerua\'s</i> opinion is based only on ""tradition,"" the fact that the Jerusalem Talmud refers to these blessings, as mentioned below, indicates that they were recited during the Talmudic era.</p>\n<p>', 'and a blessing after [concluding] them, Yishtabach. -</b> The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> explain that the blessings, <i>Baruch She\'amar</i> and <i>Yishtabach</i> are considered a single unit.

Accordingly, it does not begin ""Blessed are You, God....""</p>\n<p>Though the verses of פסוקי דזמרא are not considered an interruption between the blessings, idle conversation certainly would be.

A Torah Sage -</b> Though the Rambam begins the chapter with the use of the term <i>chacham</i> (wise man), when he starts to speak of details, he employs the term <i>talmid chacham</i> (Torah Sage). Perhaps this implies that the peaks of character development epitomized by the <i>chacham</i> can only be achieved when one develops his wisdom in Torah study.</p>\n<p><b>should not be a glutton. Rather, he should eat food which will keep his body healthy, -</b> as described in the previous chapter. Furthermore, even when eating these foods, he should not overindulge.</p>\n<p><b>without overeating. -</b> In the previous chapter, Halachah 15, the Rambam warned against overeating from a health perspective. Now, he treats it as an ethical inadequacy and a departure from the desired middle path. See also Chapter 1, Halachah 4, Chapter 3, Halachah 2.</p>\n<p><b>He should not seek to fill his stomach, like those who stuff themselves with food and drink until their bellies burst. -</b> The Rambam underlines the negative aspects of the tendency to overindulge and gorge oneself on food by using an extreme example. See also the Guide to the Perplexed, Vol. III, Chapter 8, where he compares people who pursue gluttony to a slave who revels in dung.</p>\n<p><b>They are alluded to by [the statement of] the prophet [<a href=""/16220#v3"">Malachi 2:3</a>]: ""I will spread dung on your faces, the dung of your feasts."" -</b> We have translated the verse in keeping with the interpretation of our Sages quoted below.

However, the Rambam is not quoting the verse as a support, he is merely borrowing the expression to exemplify an existential search for pleasure.</p>\n<p><b>This is the food of the wicked. It is these tables which the verse censures, saying: ""For all tables are full of vomit and excrement; there is no room"" (<a href=""/15959#v8"">Isaiah 28:8)</a>. -</b> The final word of the verse, <i>makom</i>, can also refer to God and thus, implies that God\'s presence is also lacking. Eating for the sake of indulgence is the direct opposite of the approach of ""Knowing God in all your ways"" described previously.</p>\n<p><i>Avot</i> 3:3 also quotes this verse and the Rambam alludes to that mishnah in the following halachah.</p>\n<p>In contrast, a wise man eats only one dish or two, eating only enough to sustain him. That is sufficient for him. - As a source for eating two dishes, the commentaries have suggested <i>Derech Eretz Rabbah</i>, Chapter 7:</p>\n<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">It happened that Rabbi Akiva served a meal to his students.

Human Dispositions 5.2,"['When the wise man eats the little, which is fitting for him, he should eat it only in his own home at his table, -</b> The previous halachah discussed the quantity of food and the attitude with which it was to be eaten. The present halachah concerns itself with the place and the company in which the wise should eat. It revolves around the principle that a person should be modest while eating and refrain from doing so in public. (See the Guide to the Perplexed, ibid.)</p>\n<p>', ""[He should not eat] in a store -</b> <i>Kol Ya'akov</i> notes that this store may even be one specifically designated for eating, e.g., a restaurant, coffee-shop, or the like.

The passage in <i>Kiddushin</i> continues to explain that such a person is unacceptable as a witness and the Rambam quotes that law (<i>Hilchot Edut</i> 11:5).</p>\n<p>The commentaries have attempted to resolve this difficulty in different ways: For example <i>Tosafot, Kiddushin</i> (ibid.) explains that a common person is condemned only if he eats a full meal in the market place, while a wise man should not eat anything at all in public. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> (<i>Hilchot Edut</i>) differentiates between eating in a crowded place - which is forbidden for everyone - and eating in a quiet corner - which is deemed improper only for a Sage. The <i>Bach</i> (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 34) explains that a common person is censored only for eating while walking through the market place, while the wise man should not eat in public even while standing in one place.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, it must be noted that in this halachah, the Rambam uses the expression <i>chacham</i> (a wise man), his ideal for a person with a developed personality, and not <i>talmid chacham</i> (a Torah Sage). Apparently, he does not differentiate between a Torah Sage and a common person in this matter and requires a refined, highly developed standard in meeting our physical needs from everyone.</p>\n<p>', 'unless there is a very pressing need, lest he be viewed without respect by others.<br/></b></p>\n<p>', 'He should not eat together with the unlearned, -</b> <i>Sanhedrin</i> 52b states that, at the outset, a common person will consider a Torah Sage to be like a vessel of gold.

Therefore, even when there is no danger of subjecting himself to undesirable influences or disgracing the Torah with which he is identified, he should refrain from performing a physical activity like eating in the presence of others.</p>\n<p>', ""It is not fitting for him to eat at another person's [table] except at a feast associated with a mitzvah, -</b> <i>Chullin</i> 95b states that Rav would not partake of a meal in public unless it was associated with a mitzvah.</p>\n<p>"", 'e.g., a betrothal -</b> This decision is not accepted by all authorities.

There are specific prohibitions against drinking - e.g. a priest is not allowed to perform the priestly services while under the influence of alcohol (<a href=""/9911#v9"">Leviticus 10:9</a>-11). Similarly, numerous passages throughout the Prophets and Sacred Writings castigate drunkenness.

There is no more powerful expression of man\'s basic, instinctual nature than sex. Therefore, precisely in this area, a Jew must reveal that his nature is not only material, that he possesses a spiritual dimension that lies at the core of his being and seeks expression.</p>\n<p>For this reason, the Jewish marriage bond is referred to as <i>Kiddushin</i>, emphasizing how <i>kedushah</i>, holiness, is a fundamental element in marriage. Similarly, <a href=""/9921#v7"">Leviticus 20:7</a>, proclaims ""Sanctify yourselves and be holy, for I am God, your Lord,"" as a preface to the laws proscribing forbidden intimate relations. <i>Sh\'vuot</i> 18b interprets the above verse as also including a command to conduct oneself in a holy manner within permitted relationships.</p>\n<p>The quality of holiness involves not only restraint, as mentioned in the ensuing statements, but also the manner in which relations are carried out.

Modesty is not simply a matter of dress, (this is discussed in halachah 9), but rather, an awareness of God which causes a person to cover head and body out of respect for the Divine Presence. The Rambam expands upon this concept in the <i>Guide for the Perplexed</i> (Vol. III, Chapter 52):</p>\n<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">He is constantly with us, observing us, as [<a href=""/16020#v24"">Jeremiah 23:24</a>] proclaims: \'Can a man hide himself in the secret places and I not see him,\' says God.""

When Rabbi Chiya asked him the reason he was wearing such a head-covering, he explained that he was forced to leave his home in a hurry and was not able to arrange his turban. Nevertheless, he found it preferable to wear even a makeshift head-covering, rather than go out bareheaded.</p>\n<p><i>Kiddushin</i> 31a quotes Rav Huna, the son of Rav Yeshoshua, as explaining that he would not walk four cubits bareheaded out of respect for ""the Divine Presence which is above my head."" (See also <i>Zohar</i>, Vol. III, p. 245b.) Similarly, <i>Shabbat</i> 156b relates that an astrologer told Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak\'s mother that he was destined to be a thief.

The ordinary man experiences such awareness while at prayer when ""he is as if standing before the Divine Presence"" (<i>Hilchot Tefilah</i> 4:16) and then he is required not to bare his head (ibid. 5:5) or various parts of his body; e.g., his chest (ibid. 4:7) and his feet (ibid. 5:5).

The Rambam clarifies the definition of what constitutes a primary category and what constitutes a derivative in Halachot 2-6.</p>\n<p>See <i>Yereim</i> (249) who notes that the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Shabbat</i> 7:2) derives the existence of thirty nine categories of work from the exegesis of <a href=""/9899#v2"">Exodus 38:2</a>. There is a question if this difference in sources creates a difference in law as well. See also the preface to <i>Eglei Tal,</i> which questions whether the definition of the categories of forbidden labor are taken from the activities necessary for the offering of the sacrifices in the Sanctuary, or merely the activities necessary for construction of the Sanctuary. (In this context, see Rashi, <i>Shabbat</i> 73a, which states that the forbidden labor of baking was not practiced in the Sanctuary although one of the offerings was the showbread which was baked each week.)</p>\n<p>', 'The sum of all the primary categories of [forbidden] labor are forty minus one. -</b> The commentaries question why the Rambam (and his source, <i>Shabbat</i> 7:2, use this expression, rather than merely stating ""thirty-nine."" Some draw attention to the parallel found in the Mishnah\'s description of the number of lashes given a transgressor (<i>Makkot</i> 3:10). Others explain that this expression indicates that there is a fortieth activity - the spiritual service of prayer and study - which must be performed on the Sabbath day.</p>\n<p>', ""They include: plowing -</b> This and the ten labors that follow are described as <i>sidura d'pat</i>, the manner in which bread is baked.

The Rambam, however, follows the usual order of activities. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 2.)</p>\n<p>', 'reaping -</b> As explained in Chapter 8, Halachah 3, this refers to reaping with a utensil. Severing produce by hand is considered merely a derivative. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 3.)</p>\n<p>', 'collecting sheaves -</b> In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam mentions that the reapers usually gather the grain in small sheaves. Others follow who collect these sheaves into larger bundles. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 5.)</p>\n<p>According to one opinion in <i>Shabbat</i> 96b, there is an explicit reference to the prohibition of this labor on the Sabbath. Numbers, ch. 15, relates that a person was executed for collecting wood on the Sabbath. As the Rambam states Chapter 21, Halachah 11, this labor includes only the collection of produce. Gathering other substances - e.g., salt - is not included. It is, however, forbidden by Rabbinic decree.</p>\n<p>', 'threshing -</b> applying pressure to grain to extract the kernel from its husk. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 7.)</p>\n<p>', 'winnowing -</b> casting the mixture of kernels and husks to the wind. The wind will blow away the chaff, while the kernels that are heavier will fall to the ground.</p>\n<p>', 'separating -</b> separating stones and the like from the kernels of grain. This is usually done by hand.</p>\n<p>', 'grinding -</b> crushing the kernels into flour. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 15.)</p>\n<p>', 'sifting -</b> the flour with a sifter. <i>Shabbat</i> 74a (see also Chapter 8, Halachah 11) notes that the three labors - winnowing, separating, and sifting - are similar. Nevertheless, because they represent three different activities performed in the construction of the Sanctuary, each one is considered a separate primary category of forbidden labor.</p>\n<p>', 'kneading -</b> mixing the flour with water to create a dough. (See Chapter 8, Halachah 16.)</p>\n<p>', 'baking -</b> This also includes cooking, roasting, or the like. In the construction of the Sanctuary, cooking was necessary for the preparation of dyes. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 1.)</p>\n<p><b>shearing -</b> This and the following twelve labors are necessary for the preparation of fabric. Shearing involves removing hair or wool from an animal, whether dead or alive. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 7.)</p>\n<p><b>whitening -</b> After the wool is removed from the animal, it is washed to remove dirt. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 10.)</p>\n<p><b>beating -</b> Unlike Rashi and others who interpret as combing the wool, in the Rambam\'s Commentary on the Mishnah he translates the word into an Arabic term meaning ""beat it with a stick."" This activity is necessary as a preliminary stage of the preparation of flax to be spun into linen. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 12.)</p>\n<p><b>dyeing -</b> for most of the fabrics used in the curtains and roof-coverings of the Sanctuary were dyed. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 13.)</p>\n<p><b>spinning -</b> intertwining the fibers to make thread. (See Chapter 9, Halachah 15.)</p>\n<p><b>making heddles -</b> The Hebrew, literally means ""house of string."" In the weaving process, it refers to the following practice: Weaving involves passing the threads of the woof over and under each of the consecutive threads of the warp. In order to facilitate this process, two frames are made, each possessing many threads with a loop (referred to as a ""heddle"") in the middle of these threads. The threads of the warp are passed through these loops, one from one frame, and the next from the other, consecutively. When this is completed, the weaver lifts the two frames alternately. As he raises one up, he passes the woof through. In this manner, he is able to thread the woof through the entire warp at one time. (See the Rambam\'s Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Shabbat</i> 7:2; <i>Keilim</i> 21:1.)</p>\n<p><b>mounting the warp -</b> See Chapter 9, Halachah 17-18, where the Rambam describes how a loom is set up. First, the threads of the warp are extended to the desired length and width. They are then attached to a rod on either side, and held taut. This is the activity referred to by this term.</p>\n<p><b>weaving -</b> passing the threads of the woof between the threads of the warp. (See Chapter 9, <i>loc. cit.</i>)</p>\n<p><b>undoing woven fabric -</b> See Chapter 9, Halachah 20.</p>\n<p><b>tying -</b> This refers to a permanent knot whose tying requires professional expertise. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 1.) In the construction of the Sanctuary, the <i>chilazon</i> which were used for dye were caught with nets that had to be tied (<i>Shabbat</i> 74b).</p>\n<p><b>untying -</b> This also includes untying only such knots. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 7.)</p>\n<p><b>sewing -</b> at least two stitches. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 9.)</p>\n<p><b>tearing -</b> in order to sew. Otherwise, one is not liable. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 10.) If a hole was found in one of the curtains of the Sanctuary, it was cut open and sewn close (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 302:4).</p>\n<p><b>building -</b> any structure; similarly, leveling the ground is included in this category. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 12.) The <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> gives as an example, the placement of the boards of the Sanctuary in their sockets.</p>\n<p><b>demolishing -</b> Here also the intent must be a constructive one: demolishing in order to rebuild. (See Chapter 10, Halachah 15.)</p>\n<p><b>beating with a hammer -</b> The <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> points to the fashioning of the <i>menorah</i> in the Sanctuary.</p>\n<p>A craftsman finishing the fashioning of a utensil concludes his work by giving several taps with a hammer to smooth the utensil\'s surface. Thus, this labor also includes all activities performed to apply the finishing touch to an object - e.g., polishing and shining. (See the Rambam\'s Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>loc. cit.,</i> and Chapter 10, Halachah 16.)</p>\n<p><b>trapping -</b> The Mishnah mentions the following seven categories as activities necessary to write a scroll. Leather hides were used to cover the roof of the Sanctuary. (See also Chapter 10, Halachah 19.)</p>\n<p><b>slaughtering -</b> Although this term is usually used to refer to ritual slaughter, the intent here is taking a life through any means. (See Chapter 11, Halachah 1.)</p>\n<p><b>skinning -</b> the hide of an animal to use for leather. (See Chapter 11, Halachah 5.)</p>\n<p><b>processing [hides] -</b> into leather. (See Chapter 11, <i>loc. cit.</i>) Significantly, the Mishnah (<i>Shabbat</i> 7:2) also includes salting the hides as a separate category of labor. <i>Shabbat</i> 75b, however, includes this activity in the category of processing hides and includes ruling parchment as the thirty-ninth category of labor.</p>\n<p><b>removing hair -</b> For leather or parchment, smooth skin is required. (See also Chapter 11, Halachah 5, 6.)</p>\n<p><b>cutting [leather] -</b> This refers to making an exact cut, so that the leather can be used for a purpose. Cutting indiscriminately is a destructive activity. Hence, one is not held liable. (See Chapter 11, Halachah 7.)</p>\n<p><b>writing -</b> two letters. This activity was necessary in the Sanctuary, for a mark was made on the boards so that the same boards could be matched to each other each time they were attached together. (See Chapter 11, Halachah 9.)</p>\n<p><b>erasing -</b> For if the builders of the Sanctuary erred in making a sign, they would erase it and write another in its place. In this instance as well, one is held liable only when one erases with the intent of writing two letters in this place. (See Chapter 11, <i>loc. cit.</i>)</p>\n<p><b>ruling lines -</b> For proper writing is possible only on ruled lines. (See Chapter 11, Halachah 17.) In the Sanctuary, this labor was performed to prepare the hides to be cut.</p>\n<p><b>kindling a flame -</b> This was necessary to cook the dyes. As the Rambam explains in Chapter 12, Halachah 1, one is liable for kindling a flame only when when desires to cook with it, use it for light, or desires ash. Otherwise, it is considered a destructive activity.</p>\n<p><b>extinguishing a flame -</b> Here also, one\'s intent must be constructive - e.g., to use the charcoal produced. In the Sanctuary, this was necessary to produce an even flame for the fashioning of the metal utensils (See Chapter 12, Halachah 2.)</p>\n<p><b>transferring from one domain to another. -</b> All the materials necessary for the construction of the Sanctuary were brought from the private domain to the public domain (<i>Shabbat</i> 96b).

Reading the Shema 3.1,"['One who recites the <i>Shema</i> should wash his hands with water -</b> Rabbi Yochanan says: A person who wants to accept upon himself the kingship of Heaven in the most complete fashion should see to his bodily needs, wash his hands, put on <i>tefillin</i>, recite the <i>Shema</i> and pray. Rav Chiyya bar Abba equates this process with the building of the altar and the bringing of sacrifices, based on the verse in <a href=""/16247#v6"">Psalms 26:6</a>: ""I wash my hands in innocence and I encompass Your altar, O God"" (<i>Berachot</i> 14a-15a).</p>\n<p>', ""before reciting it. -</b> This is the case even if one's hands are not obviously dirty, because hands tend to touch the covered parts of one's body, and thus, require the washing of hands.</p>\n<p>The Rambam holds that a blessing is recited after one washes one's hands before <i>Kri'at</i> Shema. (See <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 6:2.) The requirement to wash our hands upon rising in the morning was established by the Sages as a preparation for <i>Kri'at</i> Shema and the <i>Amidah</i>. A blessing was instituted for this act and, therefore, a blessing is recited every time that one washes his hands before <i>Kri'at</i> Shema or the <i>Amidah</i>. (Rabbenu Asher also shares this position. See his notes to the ninth chapter of <i>Berachot</i>.)</p>\n<p>The Rashba explains, however, that the blessing על נטילת ידים was instituted as one of the many blessings that one recites upon rising in the morning (ברכות השחר). In response to receiving anew his soul from Heaven, one is obligated to praise and thank God. In that context, the Sages also instituted the requirement that he sanctify himself for his day's worship, just as the priests in the Temple did - i.e., by washing his hands with water from a vessel. There is, however, no intrinsic connection between the washing of hands, and <i>Kri'at</i> Shema and the <i>Amidah</i>. Therefore, the blessing is recited only in the morning upon rising.</p>\n<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 92:5 and 233:2 agrees with the Rashba and does not require a blessing upon washing hands in preparation for <i>Kri'at</i> Shema and the <i>Amidah</i>.

Rabbenu Manoach explains that, in the latter instance, the law is stricter because there is a longer time during which one may recite the <i>Amidah</i> - until the end of the fourth hour. Hence, we need not worry that he will miss the proper time.</p>\n<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> adds that we are stricter regarding the time of <i>Kri'at</i> Shema since it is a Torah obligation.

However, Shmuel is of the opinion that this same halachah applies even if he were sleeping with a person other than his wife, while Rav Yosef feels that this dispensation is only granted in regard to one's wife.</p>\n<p>"", ""Rashi explains the latter opinion as follows: Since a person is accustomed to being with his wife, lying with her will not prevent him from having proper intention while reciting the <i>Shema</i>.

Leavened and Unleavened Bread 1.1,"['The text --</b> As mentioned in the introduction, the Rambam composed the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> with the intention of providing our people with clear directives concerning the performance of all the mitzvot. Hence, he also includes in this work the text of all necessary prayers and legal documents.</p>\n<p>', ""the Haggadah --</b> The main body of the Haggadah was composed early in our nation's history. Some authorities attribute it to the <i>Anshei Knesset HaGedolah</i>, who composed it together with the other prayers and blessings they authored. Large portions of the Haggadah are found verbatim in the Mishnah, <i>Pesachim</i>, Chapter Ten, and reference is made there to other sections that are not explicitly quoted.</p>\n<p>However, as obvious from the discussion in that chapter, the precise text of the Haggadah was a matter of debate and question throughout the Talmudic period. A few centuries after the completion of the Talmud, Rav Amram Gaon composed a text of the Haggadah that was accepted internationally, throughout all Jewish communities. Approximately sixty years later, his successor, Rav Saadia Gaon, composed a Haggadah with some changes and emendations. These two texts served as the basis for the Rambam's Haggadah and for the subsequent texts published by other Sages. Only minor differences exist between the Haggadah we use today and that composed by Rav Amram Gaon.</p>\n<p>"", 'customarily recited...in the time of exile --</b> as stated in Halachot 8:3-5, there are certain differences between the text we recite and that recited when the Paschal sacrifice may be offered.</p>\n<p>', ""One begins, [pouring out] the second cup --</b> After reciting <i>kiddush</i>, washing one's hands, and partaking of the <i>karpas</i>, as mentioned in Halachah 8:1-2.</p>\n<p>It must be noted that the Rambam prescribes that <i>yachatz</i>, the breaking of the <i>afikoman</i>, be performed directly before eating the matzah and not before beginning the recitation of the Haggadah, as is our custom.</p>\n<p>"", 'In haste, we left Egypt --</b> This statement, half in Hebrew and half in Aramaic, refers to <a href=""/9980#v3"">Deuteronomy 16:3</a>.

Among the explanations for this practice are:</p>\n<p>a) This enabled the passage to be understood by all participants, since Aramaic was the common language of the time (<i>Tosefot Rid, Manhig</i>). Accordingly, the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 473:6) relates that he would translate the passage into Yiddish at his Seder.</p>\n<p>b) The angels do not understand Aramaic, and hence they will not accuse us of being unworthy of redemption (Ritbah).</p>\n<p>c) The demons do not understand Aramaic, and thus they will not accept our invitation to the Seder (Rashi, <i>HaPardes</i>). This reason is questioned, because Pesach is a ליל שימורים (a protected night), on which the demons have no power to harm a Jew.</p>\n<p>', 'This year --</b> Our Haggadot (and that of Rav Amram Gaon) state השתא, ""now.""

Rav Ya\'akov Emden relates that he and his father, the <i>Chacham Tzvi</i>, would recite this verse even though he did not find it in other texts. (His statement is slightly questionable.

Nevertheless, in practice, it is agreed that women should mention both these mitzvot, because the ultimate fulfillment of the creation of both men and women is when they marry.

This ruling is not accepted by many other authorities, including Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi and Rabbenu Asher. Because of the difference of opinion, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 197:3) rules that, at the outset, an attempt should be made to follow the Rambam\'s decision. If, however, the third person does not desire to eat bread, he may be included in the <i>zimmun</i> as long as he partook of a<i>k\'zayit</i> of other foods.<br/>\n15. The commentaries note that the Rambam does not quote <i>Berachot</i> 48a (the source for this halachah) exactly. The Talmud states ""dipped his food in brine with them."" The Rambam\'s choice of phraseology is particularly difficult since, as the Rambam himself writes in <i>Hilchot Sh\'vitat Asor</i> 2:5, brine is generally not eaten alone as a food.<br/>\n16. The commentaries have noted the apparent redundancy in the Rambam\'s expressions. The <i>Kol ben Levi</i> offers a possible resolution, explaining that, in the opening clause, the Rambam states that these people are not required to make a <i>zimmun</i>. In the final clause, he states that they are not allowed to do so.<br/>\n 17. <i>Tosafot, Berachot</i> 47a, writes that if they have already decided to recite grace, the third person may not be included in a<i>zimmun</i> with them. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 197:1) accepts this ruling.<br/>\n18. According to the Rambam\'s opinion mentioned in the previous halachah, the third person must partake of bread. According to the other opinions mentioned above, if the third person partakes of other foods, the first two may include him in a <i>zimmun</i>.<br/>\n19. <i>Berachot</i> 47a relates that Rav Simai bar Chiyya joined Rav and Shemuel in a meal after the latter had completed eating. They ate another side dish together with him, and then recited the <i>zimmun</i>.<br/>\n20. Note the <i>Be\'ur Halachah</i> 197, which states that they are obligated to recite the <i>zimmun</i>.<br/>\n21. He may, however, convey this privilege on another person if he desires (<i>Tosafot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>; <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 201:1).</p>\n<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions that if a guest is present, he should be given the privilege of reciting the<i>zimmun</i>, so that he will be able to recite a blessing for the host, as mentioned in Chapter 2, Halachah 7.</p>\n<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:2) also mentions that a priest who is a Torah sage should be given the privilege of reciting the <i>zimmun</i>. (See <i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i> 4:2 and <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 12:18.)</p>\n<p>22. Although a sufficient number of people to recite grace with a<i>zimmun</i> will remain, each individual is personally obligated to participate in the <i>zimmun</i> and may not recite grace alone.<br/>\n23. Enough people remain in each group to allow them both to recite grace with a <i>zimmun</i>. There is, however, no obligation to separate. If the people desire, they may recite grace in a single group (Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 193:1).<br/>\n24. Until there are twenty people, separation will prevent - at the very least - the people who separate from reciting grace with God\'s name.</p>\n<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 193:1, based on<i>Berachot</i> 50a) states that, at a meal attended by many people, if there is a difficulty or inconvenience preventing an individual from participating in the <i>zimmun</i> in which God\'s name is mentioned, he may recite grace with a <i>zimmun</i> of three.</p>\n</co:rambam_commentary>\n</div>\n</div>']"
Blessings 5.11,"['When three people who each came -</b> It is possible to explain that this is referring to three individuals who each began eating with a separate group in the same large room. Afterwards, they joined together and ate at the same table.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the halachah is speaking about three groups that ate on the same table, and one remained from each group (<i>Merchevat HaMishneh</i>), or the three individuals came from different groups, but left their original group inadvertently or because of forces beyond their control (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 193:25).</p>\n<p>', 'from a different group of three -</b> and thus were each personally obligated to participate in a <i>zimmun</i> (Rashi, <i>Berachot</i> 50a)</p>\n<p>', '[join together], -</b> even when they themselves do not eat together (<i>loc. cit.</i>). According to the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, this applies when they eat together.

See the <i>Rishon LeTzion</i>; Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 193:6). After the fact, since they all have still not recited grace and are all obligated to participate in a <i>zimmun</i>, they should do so.</p>\n<p>', 'If each of them already participated in a zimmun -</b> i.e., although they desired to continue eating, they responded to the<i>zimmun</i> and listened to the first blessing of grace (<i>Tosafot,</i> <i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>; Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 200:1)</p>\n<p>', 'they may separate. They are not obligated -</b> The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (193:5) states, ""They cannot...""; i.e., it is forbidden for them to participate in a <i>zimmun</i> again.</p>\n<p>', 'to participate in a zimmun again -</b> Even if the latter group of three eat together, since they did not begin their meal with the intention of eating as a company, they are not obligated to recite grace with a <i>zimmun</i>.</p>\n<p>', 'because a zimmun was already recited including them. -</b> This expression implies a different concept. If a fourth person joined the two remaining in the original group and a <i>zimmun</i> was recited, the obligation of a <i>zimmun</i> is no longer incumbent on the person who left the group. Therefore, a <i>zimmun</i> may not be recited in the new group of three (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 193:6).</p>\n<p>If the three people in the new group eat together as a company, they may recite a <i>zimmun</i> (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 193:33).</p>\n<p>', 'When three people sit down [together] to eat bread, they may not separate -</b> even though one of the three desires to recite grace before the others, they must recite the <i>zimmun</i> as a group (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 193:28).</p>\n<p>', ""even though each person eats from his own food. -</b> It is the intent to sit down together at a single table that establishes them as a company, and not the fact that they share food.</p>\n<p>25. This halachah describes a large feast, at which many people eat at different tables. Nevertheless, they all came together for the same purpose, and thus are considered a single group. (See the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 7:5; and <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 195:2).</p>\n<p>In contrast, in a restaurant, although many people eat in the same room, since they did not come with the intention of eating together, they are considered as a single group. 26. The Rambam is quoting the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 7:5). Rabbenu Asher and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 195:1) state that the same principles apply if the feast is held in two separate rooms (or houses), as long as they are not separated by a street.<br/>\n27. Similarly, if a single group is large enough to prevent the words of the blessings from being heard, people should recite the <i>zimmun</i> in smaller groups (<i>Kessef Mishneh; Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 193:1).<br/>\n 28. He must also respond (<i>Berachot</i> 45b; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 194:6).<br/>\n29. He fulfills his obligation for <i>zimmun</i>, but not for grace.<br/>\n30. It is only proper that God's name be mentioned when the ten people are in the same room (<i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>).<br/>\n 31. If, however, two people from a group of three recite grace alone, a <i>zimmun</i> may not be recited (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 194:1).<br/>\n32. The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 194:1) states that this law only applies when the individual has not answered to a <i>zimmun</i> previously. If, however, he answered to the <i>zimmun</i> of a previous group, he may not be included in this <i>zimmun</i>.<br/>\n33. He should respond as usual.<br/>\n34. <i>Zimmun</i> should precede grace.

After his relations with Bathsheva, King David realized that he could not attain forgiveness by offering a sacrifice, since a sacrifice is accepted only after an act done unwittingly.

They also ruled that after <i>Havdalah</i> in the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, one must also recite the <i>Havdalah</i> service over a cup of wine.

Prayer and the Priestly Blessing 2.13,"['On Chanukah and Purim, one adds ""For the miracles,..."" -</b> Both Chanukah and Purim are commemorated with the same basic prayer, על הניסים.

However, this Talmudic passage mentions only Chanukah, and not Purim. However, Rav Yitzchak Alfasi quotes a <i>Tosefta</i> from <i>Berachot</i> which equates Chanukah and Purim.</p>\n<p><i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> quotes Rav Amram Gaon that על הניסים is not recited at night on Purim because we have not yet read <i>Megillat Esther</i>.

Rav Huna and Rav Yehudah are of the opinion that it should not be mentioned, since <i>Musaf</i> is not usually recited on Chanukah, and, therefore, there is no need to refer to Chanukah during the <i>Musaf</i> prayer of the Sabbath. Rav Nachman and Rabbi Yochanan hold that since <i>Musaf</i> is simply one of the prayers of the day, and על הנסים is recited on this day, its inclusion in <i>Musaf</i> is in place.</p>\n<p>The Talmud ultimately decides in favor of the position of Rav Nachman and Rabbi Yochanan. This is supported by the fact that on Yom Kippur which falls on the Sabbath, reference is made to the Sabbath in the <i>Ne\'ilah</i> prayer, even though <i>Ne\'ilah</i> is not normally recited on the Sabbath.</p>\n<p>The Rambam does not mention this halachah with regard to Purim, since it is only in rare cases that Purim occurs on the Sabbath. Purim is generally celebrated on the fourteenth of Adar, which never occurs on the Sabbath according to our fixed calendar. However, cities which were walled at the time of Joshua\'s conquest of Israel celebrate Purim on the fifteenth of Adar (<i>Shushan Purim</i>). Nevertheless, there are very few such cities.</p>\n<p>Jerusalem is, however, one of them, and there, Purim can fall on the Sabbath. In such a case, על הנסים is said on the Sabbath, even though most of the other commandments of Purim are fulfilled either on the Friday before or the Sunday afterwards.

Rather, Rav Yitzchak is of the opinion that it should be inserted into the blessing of ""the One who hears prayer."" Rav Sheshet is also of this opinion.</p>\n<p>Although the Talmud refers specifically to one who accepted a fast upon himself, it is clear from the continuation of the discussion there that the same halachah applies to the silent <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> recited by everyone on a public fast day also.</p>\n<p>It is interesting to note that the Rambam obligates one to add עננו in all the prayers recited on a Fast Day. This is in line with <i>Shabbat</i> 24a which states: ""On fast days...in the Evening, Morning, and <i>Minchah</i> Prayers, one adds a mention of the particular day in \'the One who hears prayer.\' However, the <i>Tur</i> quotes the Geonim that one should recite עננו only in the <i>Minchah</i> Prayer. Since one could be overcome by terrible hunger and break the fast, if one recited עננו earlier he would have spoken falsely when he mentioned the fast day. Therefore, according to this position, this prayer should be mentioned only in the <i>Minchah</i> service at the end of the fast days.</p>\n<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 565:3) quotes the <i>Tur\'s</i> position, but distinguishes between the four public fast days that occur every year (i.e., those mentioned above in our commentary) and other public fast days. On the four main public fasts, he obligates the individual to mention עננו in all his prayers. Since the Sages declared it a public fast, even were he to eat later on, he would not have spoken falsely in his prayer.</p>\n<p>The Ramah ( <i>ibid.</i>), however, mentions that it is customary to recite עננו in <i>Minchah</i> only. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> explains that even one reciting <i>Minchah</i> in the early afternoon should add עננו, because even if he eats later on, at least he fasted until midday. (See Ramah, <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 562:1.) Sephardim follow the custom of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, and Ashkenazim follow the ruling of the Ramah and therefore recite עננו only in <i>Minchah</i>.</p>\n<p>', 'The leader of the congregation recites it as an independent blessing between ""the One who redeems Israel"" and ""the One who heals...,"" and concludes with ""the One who answers in times of trouble."" Thus, he recites 20 blessings. -</b> This is based on the passage from <i>Ta\'anit</i> 13b quoted above. A clear distinction is made between the silent <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> uttered by all the congregants and the repetition recited aloud by the שליח ציבור (leader of the congregation). The שליח ציבור does establish for himself, as representative of the community as a whole, an independent blessing relevant to the fast day. Therefore, he recites 20 blessings, as explained by the Rambam: 19 blessings as on any day, and one extra that is particular to the fast day.</p>\n<p>There is no disagreement regarding the obligation of the שליח ציבור to recite עננו in the Morning Prayer. He is praying on behalf of the entire community. Therefore, we need not worry about the possibility of the fast being broken, since it is not possible that a number from among the congregants will not fast the whole day (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 565:3). (See the <i>Bi\'ur Halacha</i> who holds that at least ten people must intend to fast in order for the שליח ציבור to recite עננו.)</p>\n<p>', 'On the ninth of Av, -</b> The fast day commemorating the destruction of the First and Second Temple, both destroyed on this date, approximately 500 years apart.

It is appropriate that the addition regarding the ninth of Av be placed in this blessing, which speaks of rebuilding Jerusalem.</p>\n<p>Despite this logic, there is some question regarding the inclusion of this prayer in this blessing. The source for this addition is the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Ta\'anit</i> 2:2). That passage questions whether the addition should be made in the עבודה (the first of the last three blessings in the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>) or the הודאה (the second of the last three blessings). It explains that as a general rule commemorative prayers are mentioned in הודאה, while prayers regarding the future are placed in עבודה.</p>\n<p>Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi quotes this passage, but adds that the custom is to recite the addition in בונה ירושלים (the blessing of Jerusalem). He explains that this decision is based on <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 8a which states that even though normally, we add special requests in the blessing of שומע תפילה (the One who hears prayer), one is able to make a request relevant to one of the blessings of the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, in that blessing itself. Therefore, our prayers and supplications regarding the rebuilding of Jerusalem may rightfully be placed in the blessing of בונה ירושלים. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 557:1.)</p>\n<p>', '""Have mercy on us, God, our Lord, and on Your people, Israel, and Jerusalem, Your city, the mourning city,..."" -</b> The Hebrew term is רחם עלינו. This version appears in the Jerusalem Talmud. However, in both Rabbenu Asher\'s and Rabbenu Yitzhak Alfasi\'s quotes of that passage, the terms used is נחם (Console us...). This version is found in most siddurim, although the version of Yemenite Jewry is רחם, as in the Rambam.</p>\n<p>There is also a question regarding when this prayer is recited. The Rambam seems to indicate that רחם (or נחם) is to be recited in every prayer on the ninth of Av. However, the Ramah (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 557:1) states that it should only be recited in <i>Minchah</i>, just like עננו on fast days.</p>\n<p>The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 557) quotes the custom of saying רחם in the Evening and Morning Prayers, and נחם during <i>Minchah</i>. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 557:1) rules that נחם should be recited in all three prayers of the day. This is the custom of Sephardim, though Ashkenazim follow the ruling of the Ramah mentioned above. (See the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 557:1.)</p>\n<p>The Ramah explains that the rationale behind his decision is that the fire which destroyed the Temple broke out on the afternoon of the ninth of Av. Hence, we ask for comfort at that time specifically. Alternatively, the Ritba explains that only in the afternoon are we able to be comforted. Until then the pain of our loss is too real.</p>\n</co:rambam_commentary>\n</div>\n</div>']"

Nevertheless, if one desires to mention them, he may. Ashkenazim do include משיב הרוח in the winter, because of the mention of the rains which are necessary.

Since the obligation to remember the Exodus (an integral part of <i>Kri\'at Shema</i> - see Chapter 1, Halachot 2 and 3) does not apply on those days when one is involved in dealing with the burial of one\'s loved ones, one is also exempted from reciting the <i>Shema</i>.</p>\n<p><i>Sukkah</i> 25a explains that the exemption of a mourner cannot be derived from that of a bridegroom mentioned in Halachah 1.

Rashi elaborates: Though mourning is a mitzvah, the pain associated with mourning is not.</p>\n<p>The Jerusalem Talmud notes that a mourner should not voluntarily recite the <i>Shema</i>.

In his commentary on <i>Mishnah Pe\'ah</i> 1:1, the Rambam divides acts of lovingkindness into two categories: a) those one does with his money, such as charity,<br/>\nb) those one does with his body - e.g., comforting mourners and accompanying the dead to burial.</p>\n<p>Rabbenu Yonah states explicitly that this is a Torah commandment. The Rambam, however, is of the opinion that burying the dead, comforting the mourners, and all acts of lovingkindness are Rabbinic commandments. In <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 14:1, he writes:</p>\n<p class=""rambam_indented"">It is a positive commandment of Rabbinic origin to visit the sick, comfort those mourning, take out the dead, bring in the bride, accompany guests [from your house] and to involve oneself in those things necessary for burial - i.e., to carry [the coffin] on his shoulders, to walk before him, to eulogize him, to dig [the grave] and to bury him.</p>\n<p>The Rambam\'s classification of these commandments as of Rabbinic origin creates a problem for us. How are we to understand the halachot we have just learned?</p>\n<p>The Rambam has taught us that those involved in the burial of the dead and the comforting of the mourners are exempt from reciting the <i>Shema</i>, based on the principle that those involved in the performance of one commandment are exempt from another. According to Rabbenu Yonah, who understands גמילות חסד (acts of lovingkindness) to be Torah commandments, this is easily comprehended. However, according to the Rambam, how can involvement in a Rabbinic commandment exempt one from the fulfillment of a Torah obligation, especially one as central as <i>Kri\'at Shema</i>?</p>\n<p>The answer to this question depends on the continuation of <i>Hilchot Eivel</i>, <i>ibid.</i>:</p>\n<p class=""rambam_indented"">Even though all these commandments are of Rabbinic origin, they are included [in the command] ואהבת לרעך כמוך (Love your fellow as yourself, <a href=""/9920#v18"">Leviticus 19:18)</a>. All those things that you would want others to do for you in the realm of Torah and commandments, you should do for your colleague.</p>\n<p>Thus, the Rabbinic commandments regarding acts of lovingkindness are the specific ways established by the sages to express the Torah commandment of ""Love your fellow as yourself."" Accordingly, although these commandments are Rabbinic in origin, since their ultimate source is found in a Torah commandment, the rule that ""one performing one commandment is exempt from another"" applies to them as well.</p>\n<p>', 'Those standing in the inner line - i.e., they can see the faces of the mourners - are exempt from Kri\'at Shema.

Although that honor is not being paid to him personally, but to the Torah knowledge he possesses, that Torah is considered his to the extent that he can forego the honor.

Thus, a person who tends to otherworldliness and asceticism, defeats God\'s purpose in creation.</p>\n<p>', 'Whoever follows this path is called a sinner [as implied by <a href=""/9934#v11"">Numbers 6:11</a>\'s] statement concerning a nazarite: ""and he [the priest] shall make an atonement for him, for his having sinned regarding [his] soul."" -</b> A nazarite is forbidden to become impure through any contact with a dead body for the extent of his nazarite vow. If he contracts such impurity, he is required to bring a special sin offering. See Numbers, Chapter 6, <i>Hilchot Nezirut</i>, Chapters 6-8.</p>\n<p>', 'Our sages declared: -</b> <i>Ta\'anit</i> 11a. [Interestingly, the author of this statement, Rabbi Eliezer HaKfar, is also the author of the statement (<i>Avot</i>, <i>ibid.</i>) that ""envy, desire, and the pursuit of honor, drive a person from the world.""]</p>\n<p>', 'If the nazarite who abstained only from wine requires atonement, how much more so does one who abstains from everything.<br/></b></p>\n<p>', 'Therefore, our Sages directed man to abstain only from those things which the Torah denies him and not to forbid himself permitted things by vows and oaths -</b> One should not conclude that the Rambam completely disapproves of vows and oaths. At the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> (13:23), the Rambam states: ""Whoever takes a vow in order to stabilize his temperaments and correct his deeds, is zealous and praiseworthy.""</p>\n<p>In <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i>, he gives examples of people who were excessively inclined to a particular quality who take vows to correct their faults (in a manner reminiscent of his advice in the beginning of Chapter 2 of these halachot). Rather, what the Rambam criticizes in our halachah is abstention for the sake of abstention.</p>\n<p>', '[of abstention]. -</b> Note the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Kiddushin</i> 4:12:</p>\n<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">Rav Chizkiyah the priest said in the name of Rav: ""A person will ultimately be called to judgment for everything which his eye saw and which he did not taste.""<br/>\nRav Lazar was concerned because of this teaching. He saved his pennies and would [purchase] and eat from every fruit once a year.</p>\n<p>', 'Thus, our Sages stated: -</b> The Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Nedarim</i> 9:1</p>\n<p>', 'Are not those things which the Torah has prohibited sufficient for you that you must forbid additional things to yourself? -</b> In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam prefaces this statement with the following comment: ""Our Sages have made statements about this subject which are more marvelous than any others that I have ever seen.""</p>\n<p>This general statement also refers to those who fast constantly. - In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, the Rambam also criticizes excessive fasting. He quotes the prophet, Zechariah, who questions the motives of the Jews\' fasts (7:5): ""Was it for Me that you fasted?"" and exhorts them to ""Practice true justice, and show kindness and mercy every man to his brother"" as the proper service of God. To underscore this point, he concludes with the prophecy (<i>ibid.</i> 8:19) that even the public fasts will ultimately be transformed into festivals and days of rejoicing.</p>\n<p>', ""They are not following a good path, [for] our Sages -</b> <i>Ta'anit</i> 11a</p>\n<p>"", 'have forbidden a man to mortify himself by fasting. -</b> The phrase ""to mortify himself"" is significant here. The Rambam (<i>Hilchot Ta\'anit</i> 1:4; 1:9) himself mentions that the Sages commanded both the community and the individual to fast in times of distress.</p>\n<p>The Rambam\'s statements have been questioned by the Rashba (Responsa 431 and 688) and by the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> based on <i>Nedarim</i> 10a. However, the commentaries note that Shmuel, the author of the statement in <i>Ta\'anit</i>, also states (<i>Bava Kama</i> 91a) that one may fast. Here, the Rambam\'s statements are directed against self- mortification and asceticism and not against fasting per se.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, it must be noted that in <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i>, when the Rambam describes ""the paths of Teshuvah"" (3:4), he makes no mention of fasting.</p>\n<p>', 'Of all the above, and their like, Solomon directed and said: ""Do not be overly righteous and do not be overly clever; why make yourself desolate?"" (<a href=""/16468#v16"">Ecclesiastes 7:16)</a> -</b> The midrashic works have not interpreted this verse in the manner suggested here. However, we find other Spanish Jewish Sages who followed this interpretation. See Duties of the Heart 3:25, Ibn Ezra in his commentary to Ecclesiastes.</p>\n<p>Note that this verse uses the two terms - the righteous (<i>tzadik</i> and the wise (<i>chacham</i>) - which the Rambam has used to designate the man with a ideal traits.</p>\n<p>The placement of this halachah raises questions. One might have expected it to appear in the previous chapter which deals with other excesses and deviations from the middle path. However, it is possible to explain that, in its present position, it serves as a preface to the following halachot which explain how our service of God and connection to Him can be established within the context of our material reality. Thus, when viewed as a totality, this chapter emphasizes how Judaism desires that religious fulfillment be found within the context of our day to day life, rather than in otherworldly ""spiritual"" activities.</p>\n</co:rambam_commentary>\n</div>\n</div>']"
Human Dispositions 3.2,"['A person should direct his heart and the totality of his behavior to one goal, -</b> In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, Chapter 5, the Rambam addresses himself to many of the concepts mentioned in this and the following halachah. He begins that chapter with the declaration:</p>\n<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">A person must control all the powers of his soul with [his] intellect... and concentrate on a single goal at all times: To comprehend God, blessed be He, to the extent that man can know Him.<br/>\nAll of his activities: what he does, the way he rests, and what he says should lead to this goal.</p>\n<p>', 'becoming aware of God, blessed be He. -</b> Literally, the term means ""The Name,"" but obviously, it refers to the Master of The Name.</p>\n<p>', 'The [way] he rests, rises, and speaks should all be directed to this end. -</b> In the previous Halachah, the Rambam condemned asceticism and otherworldliness. In this Halachah, he stresses the desired intent of our worldly involvement, to know God.</p>\n<p>In Chapter 1, Halachah 6, the Rambam introduced a religious component into the development of an ethical personalty, pointing out that we must ""imitate"" God\'s qualities. In this halachah, he adds a further point. All of man\'s actions are to be taken in an atmosphere of God-awareness.</p>\n<p>The concept of knowing God recalls the opening Halachah of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>:</p>\n<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">The fundamental [principle] upon which all fundamental [principles are based] and the pillar of the wisdoms is to know that there is a Primary Being.</p>\n<p>In both halachot, the Rambam emphasizes how the knowledge of God is not an abstract, intellectual past-time, but rather an all- encompassing commitment, embracing every aspect of our experience. Torah living does not confine God to the synagogue or the house of study, but provides us with a means to relate to Him within every dimension of our lives (<i>Al HaTeshuvah</i>).</p>\n<p>For example: when involved in business dealings or while working for a wage, he should not think solely of gathering money. - i.e., he should not view the acquisition of money as an end in its own right.</p>\n<p>', 'Rather, he should do these things, -</b> as a means...</p>\n<p>', 'so that he will be able to obtain that which the body needs - food, drink, a home and a wife. -</b> However, as the Rambam continues in the following Halachah, the maintenance of physical well-being is also not an end in its own right. Rather, it is also only a means for the service of God.</p>\n<p>Similarly, when he eats, drinks and engages in intimate relations, he should not intend to do these things solely for pleasure - In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam also uses the expression ""solely for pleasure,"" indicating that the Rambam does not advocate a life without physical pleasure. (Note also the passage from the Rambam\'s commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 7:4, quoted below.)</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with enjoying food, for example, as long as one does so within the framework of maintaining health. Indeed, in <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, the Rambam emphasizes how one may use pleasure to encourage himself to perform the acts necessary to maintain his health.</p>\n<p>', ""to the point where he will eat and drink only that which is sweet to the palate and have intercourse for pleasure. Rather, he should take care to eat and drink only in order to be healthy in body and limb. -</b> The Rambam has just laid down the principle that all of man's actions are to be carried out in a framework of awareness of God. Yet, to exemplify this principle, he speaks not of awareness of God, but of avoiding indulgence and maintaining one's health. The Rambam introduces the maintenance of health as an immediate - and intermediary - goal which will provide us with a program of concrete action.</p>\n<p>"", 'Therefore, he should not eat all that the palate desires like a dog or a donkey. -</b> In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam states: ""In such an activity, a person is just like an animal. It is not an action man undertakes because he is a man, but rather, one that he undertakes because he is an animal.""</p>\n<p>', 'Rather, he should eat what is beneficial for the body, be it bitter or sweet. Conversely, he should not eat what is harmful to the body, even though it is sweet to the palate. -</b> The Rambam gives a full list of proper eating habits in the following chapter. Here, he cites only selected examples:</p>\n<p>', 'For example: a person with a warm constitution should not eat meat or honey, nor drink wine - as Solomon has stated in a parable: The eating of much honey is not good (<a href=""/16396#v27"">Proverbs 25:27)</a>. One should drink endive juice, even though it is bitter, -</b> this is given as a remedy for a warm liver constitution (Maimonides\' Medical Aphorisms).</p>\n<p>', 'for then, he will be eating and drinking for medical reasons only, in order to become healthy and be whole - for a man cannot exist without eating and drinking.<br/></b></p>\n<p>', 'Similarly, he should not have intercourse except to keep his body healthy -</b> See Chapter 4, Halachah 19, for a discussion of this matter.</p>\n<p>', ""and to preserve the [human] race. -</b> The Ra'avad mentions a third reason for intercourse - granting one's wife her conjugal rights The Rambam does not mention that issue here because, in these chapters he focuses on those behaviors in which a person engages voluntarily as an expression of his personal desires. He discusses a man's conjugal obligations later in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i>, Chapter 14 (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</p>\n<p>"", 'Therefore, he should not engage in intercourse whenever he feels desire, -</b> See also Chapter 5, Halachah 4, which discusses the frequency of intimate relations.</p>\n<p>', 'but when he knows that he requires a seminal emission for medical reasons, or in order to preserve the [human] race. -</b> In his commentary to the mishnah, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 7:4, the Rambam writes:</p>\n<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">The intent of intimate relations is the preservation of the species and not only pleasure. The aspect of pleasure was only introduced in order to arouse the creations toward that ultimate goal...<br/>\nThe proof of this is that desire and pleasure cease after ejaculation for this was the entire goal for which our instincts were aroused.

Human Dispositions 3.3,"['A person who accustoms himself to live by [the rules of] medicine does not follow a proper path if his sole intention is that his entire body and limbs be healthy -</b> The Rambam puts the maintenance of health mentioned in the previous halachah into proper perspective. It is not to be pursued as a goal in its own right. Rather, it should be appreciated as merely a means to enable one to reach an awareness of God. The Rambam develops this idea at length in <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> Chapter 5. There, he states:</p>\n<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">A person should have the intention while eating, drinking, having intercourse, sleeping, awakening, moving, and resting, [that he does so] for the purpose of his physical health alone.<br/>\nHis intention in [seeking] physical health should be to prepare for the soul healthy and sound vessels to acquire wisdom and intellectual and emotional advantages until he reaches the goal of [knowing God].</p>\n<p>', ""and that he have children who will do his work and toil for him.-</b> i.e., though procreation is a valid reason for intimate relations, one's intent in procreation should not be selfish.</p>\n<p>"", ""Rather, he should have the intent that his body be whole and strong, in order for his inner soul to be upright so that [it will be able] to know God. -</b> The Rambam also elaborates on the interrelation between the attainment of physical health and spiritual achievement in the Guide to the Perplexed, Vol. III, Chapter 27.</p>\n<p>Heath is necessary as part of one's process of striving to know God...</p>\n<p>"", 'For it is impossible to understand and become knowledgeable in the wisdoms when one is starving or sick, or when one of his limbs pains him. -</b> The Maggid of Mezeritch would say: ""A small hole in the body creates a large hole in the soul.""</p>\n<p>', '[Similarly,] one should intend to have a son [with the hope that perhaps he will be a wise and great man in Israel. -</b> This is the desired goal in procreation - to perpetuate the nation, not only physically, but also spiritually.</p>\n<p>Thus, whoever walks in such a path all his days will be serving God constantly; even in the midst of his business dealings, even during intercourse for his intent in all matters is to fulfill his needs so that his body be whole to serve God. - In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam associates such behavior with <a href=""/9970#v5"">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>: ""Love God, your Lord, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might."" The course of action described enables us to dedicate every aspect of our being toward the love of God as prescribed by this verse.</p>\n<p>Even when he sleeps, if he retires with the intention that his mind and body rest, lest he take ill and be unable to serve God because he is sick, then his sleep is service to the Omnipresent, blessed be He. - Perhaps, the Rambam uses this name for God to convey the concept that just as God\'s presence pervades all existence, our service of Him must encompass all aspects of our lives.</p>\n<p>On this matter, our Sages - <i>Avot</i> 2:15</p>\n<p>', 'have directed and said: ""And all your deeds should be for the sake of Heaven."" -</b> In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam elaborates upon this statement as follows:</p>\n<p style=""padding-left:10px;"">Our Sages included this entire concept in the most succinct expression possible... When one meditates on this concise statement, one wonders how they could describe in its entirety an idea so awesome that many books were written about it without encompassing it totally. Without a doubt, [the statement] was made with Divine inspiration.</p>\n<p>The commentaries note that <i>Beitzah</i> 16a stated concerning Hillel: ""All of his deeds were for the sake of Heaven,"" and associates that with the following narrative in <i>VaYikra Rabbah</i> 34:3.</p>\n<p>Hillel bid his students farewell. They asked him where he was going He told them that he was going to perform a mitzvah. They discovered that he was going to the bathhouse and asked him to explain his previous statements.

Note also the Rambam\'s comments in <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, <i>ibid.</i></p>\n<p><i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. III, notes that the rules of Torah scholarship would have called for the quotation of the Biblical verse before the quote from our Sages. However, the Rambam chooses this sequence because it reflects a progression in the service of God.</p>\n<p>""All of your deeds should be for the Sake of Heaven"" implies that the deeds are not themselves holy, merely that they are directed toward a Godly intent. ""Know Him in all your ways"" implies that a bond with God can be established within the context of our physical activity itself.</p>\n<p>', 'and He will straighten your paths"" (<a href=""/16374#v6"">Proverbs 3:6)</a>. -</b> In <i>Iggerot HaKodesh</i>, the Ramban interprets the state described in this clause as a natural product of the elevated rung of service mentioned in the previous clause.

"Shofar, Sukkah and Lulav 1.3","['At the outset, we should not blow a shofar of idol worship. -</b> For it is not appropriate to use such a shofar for a mitzvah.</p>\n<p>', 'However, if one sounded it, one has fulfilled his obligation. -</b> The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that this refers to a shofar belonging to a gentile that was used in the worship of idols, or a shofar which was itself worshiped as an idol. However, as will be explained, if the shofar of idol worship belonged to a Jew or if it was made from the horn of an animal that was sacrificed to an idol, even after the fact, its use is not acceptable.</p>\n<p>', '[In contrast,] should one sound a shofar belonging to an apostate city, - עיר הנדחת. <a href=""/9977#v13"">Deuteronomy 13:13</a>-19 describes the laws governing a city in which the majority of the inhabitants have turned to idol worship.

(See also</b> <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i>, Chapter 4.)</p>\n<p>', ""one has not fulfilled one's obligation. -</b> <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> 28a explains that the difference between a shofar of idol worship and one of an apostate city is that all the property within the latter must be destroyed. Since ultimately this shofar must be burnt, even before it is actually destroyed it is no longer considered to be an existent entity. Thus, we may not use it on Rosh HaShanah, because a shofar used for the mitzvah must be of a specific size - slightly larger than one's hand, as mentioned in Halachah 5 - and a nonexistent entity has no size at all.</p>\n<p>A shofar of idol worship must also be destroyed. However, should the gentile negate its connection to idol worship before it is acquired by a Jew, it need not be destroyed, as stated in <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 8:8. Since there is a possibility that it will not have to be destroyed, it is considered to be an existent entity and may be used for the mitzvah.</p>\n<p>This principle applies only to aspects of idol worship belonging to a gentile. It is impossible to negate the connection between an idol worshiped by a Jew and its forbidden nature. (See <i>Hilchot Avodat Kochavim</i> 8:9.) Hence, a Jew's shofar of idol worship may not be used. Similarly, if a Jew has acquired a shofar of idol worship that belonged to a gentile before the latter negated its connection to idol worship, the Jew is no longer capable of negating this connection. Therefore, such a shofar may not be used on Rosh HaShanah.</p>\n<p>Also, once an animal has been sacrificed to an idol, there is no possibility of negating its connection to idol worship. Hence, its horn may not be used as a shofar.</p>\n<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 586:3-4) quotes all the above laws as halachah.

Here, [concerning the shofar,] one performs the mitzvah with its sound.""</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nevertheless, because a sin is associated with this mitzvah, Ashkenazic custom is that no blessing should be recited before blowing such a shofar (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 586:4).</p>\n<p>', 'Similarly, a shofar from an -</b> animal consecrated as an...</p>\n<p>', 'olah offering should not be sounded, -</b> Once an animal is consecrated as an <i>olah</i> offering, no part of its body may be used any other purpose.

In the tenth chapter of <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i>, the Rambam writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One who serves [God] out of love occupies himself with the Torah and the mitzvot...for no ulterior motive, not because of fear that evil will occur, nor in order to acquire benefit...</p>\n<p>The great Sages would command the more understanding and brilliant among their students in private: ""Do not be like servants who serve their master for the sake of receiving a gift. Rather, since he is the Master, it is fitting to serve Him""; i.e., serve [Him] out of love.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The above is not intended to imply that a person should not feel happy and fulfilled in the service of God. Quite the contrary; indeed, the Rambam concludes these halachot (Chapter 8, Halachah 15) with a description of the importance of happiness in the service of God. However, the intent is that the happiness should be a byproduct and not the goal of the service. We should be totally committed to fulfilling God\'s will, and the expression of that commitment should generate satisfaction and joy.</p>\n<p><b>Based on this concept -</b> that mitzvot were not given for our benefit;</p>\n<p><b>a person who vows not to derive benefit from a shofar may use it to blow the teki\'ot required to fulfill the mitzvah. -</b> Doing so is not considered a violation of his vow.</p>\n<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 586:5) advises that the person who took the vow should not blow the shofar himself [because many consider that to be a pleasurable experience (<i>Taz</i>)].

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160:13) accepts the latter view.</p>\n<p>Significantly, the Rambam mentions washing the hands only once before partaking of food. In <i>Hilchot Mikveot</i> 11:3, where he mentions the washing of the hands within the context of ritual purity, he mentions the need to wash hands twice: once to purify the hands, and once to wash off the water used to purify them. (See Halachah 10 and commentary.) In these halachot, he makes no mention of a second washing, seeming to imply that it is unnecessary to do so. (Rav Kapach adds that it is customary in certain Yemenite groups to wash only once before meals, and bases this practice on the Rambam's decision.)</p>\n<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> and the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 162:2) mention washing the hands two or three times before partaking of a meal. This is the accepted practice in almost all communities at present.</p>\n<p>"", 'Anything that is considered an intervening substance [and thus invalidates] a ritual immersion -</b> In <i>Hilchot Mikveot</i> 1:12, the Rambam provides this general rule:</p>\n<p class=""rambam_indented"">Any substance that intervenes [between one\'s flesh and the water] and disturbs one nullifies the immersion, even if it covers only a minor portion of one\'s flesh.... Any substance that covers the major portion of one\'s flesh nullifies the immersion, even though it does not disturb one.</p>\n<p>In Chapter 2 of those halachot, the Rambam mentions a long list of particular substances that nullify immersions, including filth, mud, and dough.</p>\n<p>', ""is also considered an intervening substance with regard to washing hands. -</b> This implies that one should clean one's hands before washing them for this ritual purpose. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i>, 161) discusses the particular laws regarding intervening substances.</p>\n<p>"", 'All liquids that may be included in the measure of a <i>mikveh</i> -</b> This includes substances like ice and snow, which can be used to make up the measure of a <i>mikveh</i> (<i>Hilchot Mikveot</i> 7:3).</p>\n<p>', ""may be included in the measure of the revi'it [necessary for washing hands]. -</b> Note the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> and the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160:12), which discuss the use of wine, beer, and fruit juices for washing hands.</p>\n<p>5. I.e., whether before a meal or in preparation for prayer.<br/>\n6. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that this expression indicates that it is not necessary to wash one's hands a second time (see the commentary on the previous halachah) or to dry them before partaking of the food. When washing one's hands for food, this is required because the water used for the first washing that remains on the hands becomes ritually impure. In contrast, the water that remains on one's hands after immersion in a <i>mikveh</i> is pure. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 159:19.)<br/>\n7. A <i>mikveh</i> must have at least 40 <i>se'ah</i> of water that has flowed into it by natural means. In contemporary measurements, 331 liters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, and 648 liters according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>.</p>\n<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that this applies only to water that does not emanate from a natural spring. When a person immerses his hands in such a spring, all that is necessary is that there be sufficient water to cover his hands. (See also <i>Hilchot Mikveot</i> 9:8.)</p>\n<p>Significantly, Rabbenu Yonah maintains that it is acceptable to immerse one's hands in a <i>mikveh</i> containing even less than 40 <i>se'ah</i>. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 159:14) accepts this view, although the Ramah favors the Rambam's position.</p>\n<p>8. The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, and maintains that one may immerse one's hands in water poured into a pool in the ground. He supports his position by referring to the immersion of a <i>ba'al keri</i> (see <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 4:4-5), which is acceptable even in such pool. (See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Mikveot</i> 8:1.) Nevertheless, most authorities accept the Rambam's decision. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 159:23; <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 159.)<br/>\n 9. See Halachot 7-9.<br/>\n10. See Halachot 4 and 10.<br/>\n11. See Halachot 11-12. The Rashba quotes the <i>Halachot Gedolot</i> as explaining that it is necessary to wash with a vessel, because the washing of hands is derived from the sanctification of the priest's hands in the Temple.<br/>\n12. See Halachot 13-14.<br/>\n13. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160) states that this concept is derived from the laws of the <i>ki'or</i> (the basin in the Temple from which the priests washed their hands). If its water changed color, it could no longer be used.<br/>\n14. E.g., ink or another coloring fell into it.<br/>\n15. It became rusty from a metal container. Note, however, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 160:1 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 160:22, which state that water that has become murky from mud or dirt is acceptable, because even this is often the color of natural stream water.</p>\n<p>If after water was disqualified because of an abnormal color, its color reverts to the norm, it can be used to wash one's hands (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 160:1; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 160:5).</p>\n<p>16. See <i>Hilchot Rotzeach USh'mirat HaNefesh</i> 11:6-16, which discusseshe prohibition of water left uncovered. This prohibition was enacted out of fear of the possibility that a poisonous snake or the like released venom into the water.<br/>\n17. <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 30b states that washing with such water could be dangerous lest the venom seep into cuts or sores or even through the body's pores. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160) notes that since the presence of poisonous snakes and the like is no longer widespread, the prohibition against drinking - and hence, washing with - such water need not be observed at present. This ruling is accepted by the later authorities.<br/>\n18. The Rambam is implying that the water in a <i>mikveh</i> or in a natural stream remains acceptable for washing although it was used for other tasks (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br/>\n19. If, however, the bread fell into the water accidentally, the water is not disqualified (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 160:2; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 160:8).<br/>\n20. The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160:2) states that even if the baker washed his hands in the water, the water does not become unacceptable. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> (160:3) refutes this ruling. His opinion is accepted by the later authorities.<br/>\n 21. Slightly murky water is acceptable, as mentioned above. The determining factor is whether or not a dog will drink from the water.<br/>\n22. Since a <i>mikveh</i> containing such water is acceptable for the immersion of one's entire body, it is surely acceptable for the immersion of hands, which is only a Rabbinic commandment.<br/>\n23. These hot springs have a high mineral content and are very bitter.<br/>\n24. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> interprets this as referring to a stream that was diverted into a trench that does not contain forty <i>se'ah</i>. Although logically, this would be acceptable for the immersion of hands, the Sages forbade using such water, lest one also immerse one's hands in a container of water. Significantly, in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160:7), Rav Yosef Karo adds a further point, that the water was cut off from its source.<br/>\n25. I.e., the washing before partaking of bread.<br/>\n26. I.e., the washing after the meal (see Halachah 17); alternatively, the second pouring of water over one's hands, as mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 4. Note the explanation of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>.<br/>\n 27. In both instances, one must pour at least a <i>revi'it</i> of water over one's hands in a single pouring. In the first instance, while the water is being poured one gradually moves one's hands under the water, while in the second instance, one pours hurriedly, but forcefully, over the entire hand at once.<br/>\n28. I.e., several people stand with their hands outstretched, and a person passes in front of them pouring water over their hands.<br/>\n29. Although the water first passes over the hands of one person, it is still acceptable for the person whose hands are held below, because as long as it contains the required quantity and comes in one continuous stream, it does not become impure.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 160:16 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 160:68,72 state that the two people must originally have the intention to wash their hands as one, and must hold their hands close together. Otherwise, it is considered as if the second person washed with the water that was rendered impure by the first person's washing.</p>\n<p>30.

They offer two explanations. The first is that they were afraid and hid from the idolaters. (See <i>Midrash Tehillim</i> 118.

This is derived from the end of the verse, as mentioned by the Rambam.</p>\n<p>', 'in the evening and in the morning -</b> The obligation to recite the <i>Shema</i> at night is mentioned first both in the Mishnah,<i>Berachot</i> 1:1 and here in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, following the pattern mentioned in the verse quoted above: ""...when you lie down and when you rise.""</p>\n<p><i>Berachot</i> 3a understands this order as parallel to the creation of the world itself which began: ויהי ערב ויהי בקר (And then there was night and there was day..., <a href=""/8165#v5"">Genesis 1:5)</a>. (See also the Rambam\'s commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 1:1.)</p>\n<p>i.e., when people are accustomed to sleep - this being the night - and when people are accustomed to rise - this being daytime. - The Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 10b) records a disagreement between the school of Shammai and the school of Hillel regarding the laws derived from the verse: ""... and when you lie down and when you rise.""</p>\n<p>Both agree that the <i>Shema</i> is recited twice daily, once at night and once in the morning. However, based on the above verse, <i>Beit Shammai</i> obligates one to recline while reciting <i>Kri\'at Shema</i> at night, and to stand while reciting it in the morning. <i>Beit Hillel</i> holds that the verse simply establishes the general times at which the <i>Shema</i> is recited, as stated by the Rambam in this halachah; i.e., at the time that people sleep and at the time that they are accustomed to wake up.</p>\n</co:rambam_commentary>\n</div>\n</div>']"
Reading the Shema 1.2,"[""And what is it that one recites? -</b> There are various opinions as to what constitutes the positive commandment of <i>Kri'at Shema</i>. <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Commandment 419) states clearly that the Torah obligates us to read only the first verse of the <i>Shema</i> - i.e., <i>Shema Yisrael</i>. The reading of the rest of the three sections was instituted by the Sages.</p>\n<p>Rabbenu Yonah understands that the whole first section constitutes the Torah obligation. (See <i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 63 at the end.) There is also an opinion that the obligation to recite the first two sections originates in the Torah. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Orach Chayim</i> 58.) However, in practice, everyone ultimately agrees that one must recite all three sections mentioned by the Rambam in this halachah (<i>Berachot</i> 13a).</p>\n<p>"", 'These three sections: ""Hear O Israel..."" (<a href=""/9970#v4"">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>-9), ""And if you will listen..."" (<a href=""/9975#v13"">Deuteronomy 11:13</a>-21) and ""And God said..."" (<a href=""/9943#v37"">Numbers 15:37</a>-41). -</b> For, as explained, each of these paragraphs contains fundamental concepts central to the Jewish faith.</p>\n<p>Note <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Commandment 420) who quotes the Rambam, not to explain the order of <i>Kri\'at Shema</i>, but rather to clarify why the Sages included these three sections in the <i>Shema</i>.</p>\n<p>we begin with the section of ""Hear O Israel..."" - <i>Berachot</i> 13a, 14b, offers two different explanations regarding the order of <i>Kri\'at Shema</i>. The Rambam, however, does not quote either explicitly, but rather seems to suggest his own reason.</p>\n<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> holds that the Rambam\'s explanation of the order of the first two sections, ""Hear O Israel"" and ""And if you will listen,"" is in fact consistent with the Mishnah in <i>Berachot</i> 13a. Regarding the last section, the Rambam desired to supply us with both the reason for its inclusion and its placement after the second section (even though the third section precedes it in the Torah itself).</p>\n<p>', 'since it contains [the concept of] the unity of God -</b> The statement ""God is our Lord, God is one"" implies not only that there is only one God, but all creation is one with Him. See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 61:6.</p>\n<p>', '[the commandment of] loving Him -</b> ""And you shall love God, your Lord, with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your strength"" (<a href=""/9970#v5"">Deuteronomy 6:5)</a>.</p>\n<p>', 'the study of Torah -</b> ""... and you shall teach your children and speak of them"" (<a href=""/9970#v7"">Deuteronomy 6:7)</a>.</p>\n<p>It must be noted that in <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i>, the Rambam quotes <a href=""/9975#v19"">Deuteronomy 11:19</a> (a verse in the second section of the <i>Shema</i>), as the source for the mitzvah of Torah study.</p>\n<p>', 'it being a fundamental principle upon which everything is based -</b> This refers to the concept of the unity of God. (See <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:6.)</p>\n<p>', 'After it [we read] ""And if you will listen...,"" since it contains the imperative to fulfill the rest of the commandments -</b> ""And if you will listen to all my commandments..."" (<a href=""/9975#v13"">Deuteronomy 11:13)</a>. This section also contains the commandment of loving God (verse 13) and the study of Torah (verse 19). It is, however, the mention of ""all the commandments"" which distinguishes this section as separate and unique from the first section.</p>\n<p>and finally the portion of tzitzit, since it also contains the imperative of remembering all the commandments - ""And you shall see them (<i>tzitzit</i> - the fringes on the corners of four-cornered garments) and remember all the commandments of God and do them"" (<a href=""/9943#v39"">Numbers 15:39)</a>.</p>\n<p>Rashi, in his commentary on the above verse, explains how <i>tzitzit</i> serve as a reminder of all the Torah\'s commandments. The numerical value of the Hebrew word ציצית is 600 (צ = 90 י = 10 צ = 90 י = 10 ת = 400) There are also eight strings and five knots. Therefore, by looking at the <i>tzitzit</i>, one is reminded of the 613 divine commandments.<br/>\n</p>\n</co:rambam_commentary>\n</div>\n</div>']"
Reading the Shema 1.3,"['The commandment of tzitzit is not obligatory at night -</b> <a href=""/9943#v39"">Numbers 15:39</a> states: ""And you shall see them..."" - implying that <i>tzitzit</i> must only be worn when they can be seen, i.e., daytime. Accordingly, there is no obligation to wear <i>tzitzit</i> at night. See <i>Hilchot Tzitzit</i> 3:7-8.</p>\n<p>', 'Nevertheless, we recite [the section describing] it at night because it mentions the exodus from Egypt -</b> ""I am God, your Lord, who took you out of the land of Egypt to be your Lord, I am God, your Lord"" (<a href=""/9943#v41"">Numbers 15:41)</a>.</p>\n<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the mention of the exodus can itself be understood as the reason for the inclusion of this section in <i>Kri\'at Shema</i>. The Rambam, however, mentions <i>tzitzit</i> as the basis for the presence of this section in <i>Kri\'at Shema</i> (see Halachah 2), since it is the <i>tzitzit</i> that cause us to remember all the commandments.</p>\n<p>', 'We are commanded to mention the exodus from Egypt both during the day and at night -</b> See <i>Berachot</i> 12b.</p>\n<p>It is interesting to note that in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam does not count the mentioning of the exodus from Egypt as one of the 613 commandments in the Torah, nor does he mention it elsewhere in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.</p>\n<p>The Rambam does, however, count the commandment of the telling of the story of the exodus on the fifteenth of <i>Nisan</i> - i.e., Passover night - as one of the mitzvot. See <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 157), <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 21), and <i>Hilchot Chametz U\'Matzah</i>, Chapters 7 and 8.</p>\n<p>According to some opinions, one can differentiate between the two obligations as follows: A person can fulfill his daily obligation with simply a thought about the exodus, whereas on <i>Pesach</i> night the mitzvah can be performed only through the verbal description of the redemption from Egypt. (See <i>Sha\'agat Aryeh</i>, 13.)</p>\n<p>This would explain the omission of this commandment from <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>. A commandment that can be fulfilled with a thought alone and not an explicit statement or action is not ""worthy"" of inclusion in the list of 613 commandments of the Torah. (See the Rambam\'s explanation of the commandment to remember Amalek: Positive Commandment 189).</p>\n<p>The <i>Aruch HaShulchan</i>, however, disagrees with this opinion. In <i>Orach Chayim</i> 67, he states that even the daily obligation requires an explicit statement. Nevertheless, he explains that it was not chosen as one of the 613 commandments because the obligation to remember the exodus twice daily is not stated in the form of a command in the Torah to ""Remember,"" but rather, as a reason for another mitzvah (the mitzvah of <i>matzah</i>): ""In order that you shall remember...""

Reading the Shema 1.4,"['When reciting the Shema, after completing the first verse, one says quietly: ""Blessed be the name of the glory of His Kingdom forever."" -</b> This phrase is recited quietly because it is not part of the section of the <i>Shema</i> as it appears in the Torah, but rather was recited by Jacob in Egypt, as explained later in this halachah.</p>\n<p>It is, however, pronounced loudly on Yom Kippur. <i>Pirkei D\'rabbi Eliezer</i> explains that the angels praise God with this verse. On Yom Kippur, we are as pure as angels and thus, emulate their practice (<i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i>).</p>\n<p>It is preferable to separate clearly between the end of ""Blessed be the name"" - i.e., the words לעולם ועד - forever, and the beginning of the next section, ואהבת (And you shall love...)

He was worried that perhaps his sudden lack of understanding was due to the imperfect state of his children and therefore, felt compelled to ask them about their faith in the One God.</p>\n<p>The Rambam omits all these particulars, since they are not relevant to the matter at hand - namely, the source of the custom of saying ""Blessed be the name..."" after ""<i>Shema Yisrael</i>...""</p>\n<p>', 'This is comparable to the manner in which Moses, our teacher, said to us: ""Lest there be among you a man or woman [whose heart turns this day from God...]"" -</b> The Rambam adds this in order to teach us the nature of Jacob\'s doubts. He was not casting aspersions on the behavior of his sons, since he knew that their deeds were righteous. He was, however, worried that perhaps one of them had a mistaken understanding regarding the unity of God. This is in line with the verse the Rambam quotes. Moses is not chastising the Jewish people for their actions, but rather warning them of the possibility that there might be someone with a lack of faith that could lead to blasphemy later (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</p>\n<p>', 'They all answered and said: ""Listen, Israel, -</b> Jacob is also called by that name (<a href=""/8227#v29"">Genesis 32:29)</a>.</p>\n<p>', 'God is our Lord, God is One,"" i.e., listen to us, Israel, our father, God is our Lord, God is One.<br/></b></p>\n<p>', 'The wise elder responded: -</b> Praising God for the fortune of having righteous children;</p>\n<p>', '""Blessed be the Name of the Glory of His Kingdom forever.""

The <i>Magen Avraham</i> explains that the basic halachah is indeed that three medium sized stars constitute the time of צאת הכוכבים, but that the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> obligated one to wait for smaller stars in order to diminish the possibility of error regarding the recitation of <i>Kri\'at Shema</i> at night.</p>\n<p>There are three basic positions regarding the actual time of צאת הכוכבים (the appearance of the stars). <i>Shabbat</i> 34b determines that it refers to the time that it takes one to walk 3/4 of a <i>mil</i> after sunset.</p>\n<p>The other two positions are found in <i>Pesachim</i> 94a: one defines צאת הכוכבים as the amount of time needed to walk four <i>mil</i> after sunset, and the other, as the time necessary to walk five <i>mil</i>.</p>\n<p>There are two different methods of determining the time it takes to walk a <i>mil</i>.

However, the most widely held opinion - and the opinion accepted regarding <i>halachah l\'ma\'aseh</i> - is that the measure of time is 18 minutes.</p>\n<p>Therefore, according to <i>Shabbat</i> 34b, the appearance of the stars <a href=""/15944#v1"">is 13 1</a>/2 (3/4 x 18) minutes after sunset. Both the Vilna Gaon and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> maintain that צאת הכוכבים is determined in this fashion. Thus, the proper local time may be calculated by extrapolation based on the amount of light visible 13 1/2 minutes after sunset in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> on the day of the Equinox. Generally, people wait up to 36 minutes after sunset in order to be certain.</p>\n<p>According to <i>Pesachim</i> 94a, the appearance of the stars will be either 72 (4 x 18) minutes or 90 (5 x 18) minutes after sunset. <i>Rabbenu Tam</i> strongly suggests adhering to the position that צאת הכוכבים takes place 72 minutes after sunset. Though some authorities support the 90-minute position, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein (<i>Iggerot Moshe, Orach Chayim</i>, Vol. 1, Siman 24), mentions only the position of the <i>Vilna Gaon</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i>, on the one hand, and <i>Rabbenu Tam</i> on the other.</p>\n<p>', ""[and continues] until midnight -</b> There are three positions recorded in the Mishnah in <i>Berachot</i> 2a regarding the time until which one may recite the <i>Shema</i> at night.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Eliezer says until the end of the first of the three watches of the Temple - i.e., one third of the night, which is until approximately 9:30 pm. The Sages say until midnight, and Rabban Gamliel says until dawn. The Mishnah then explains that the Sages' opinion is, in effect, that one may recite the <i>Shema</i> until dawn, but that they mentioned midnight as a preferred time in order to distance people from transgression. This is the source of this halachah in the Rambam.</p>\n<p>The <i>Rosh</i> and the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 235) hold that the halachah follows Rabban Gamliel's position, and that a priori (לכתחילה), a person may read the <i>Shema</i> at night until dawn. The Rambam sees the Sages' position as halachically valid, and therefore one may rely on Rabban Gamliel only after the fact (בדיעבד). The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 235:3 quotes the Rambam's position. (See also <i>Mishnah Berurah 235:34-35.)<br/></i></p>\n<p>A person who transgresses and delays - the Rabbinic decree that the <i>Shema</i> should be read before midnight.</p>\n<p>"", 'fulfills his obligation if he recites [the Shema] before dawn. -</b> In his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 1:1), the Rambam defines dawn (עלות השחר) as the light that radiates from the east before sunrise.</p>\n<p>There are three major positions regarding this time. All are based on <i>Pesachim</i> 94a which defines the time from dawn until sunrise as that in which a person can walk either 4 <i>mil</i> (according to one opinion) or 5 <i>mil</i> (according to the other).</p>\n<p>As mentioned above, there are two opinions regarding the measure of time it takes to walk a <i>mil</i>: 18 minutes or 24 minutes. Thus, Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi defines dawn as 120 (5 x 24) minutes before sunrise. The most widely held view is that it is 90 (5 x 18) minutes before sunrise, while the <i>Beit Yosef</i> holds that dawn is 72 (4 x 18) minutes before sunrise. This is the opinion of the Rambam, as stated in his commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 1:1.)</p>\n<p>', '[The Sages established the limit] of midnight only in order to distance us from negligent wrongdoing. - <i>Berachot</i> 1:1 lists other instances where the Sages established similar guidelines, e.g., partaking of sacrificial meat, burning sacrificial limbs.<br/></b></p>\n</co:rambam_commentary>\n</div>\n</div>']"

The evening <i>Shema</i> must be recited ""when you lie down."" The Torah left the definition of that term to the Rabbis. The latter maintained that a person who intentionally delays the recitation of the <i>Shema</i> cannot recite it after dawn. However, they were more lenient in regard to a person who was unavoidably detained and gave him until sunrise.</p>\n<p>', 'A person who was so detained and reads [the Shema] at this time does not recite [the blessing of] ""Lay us down."" -</b> for this is not a time when a person lays himself down to sleep.

The <i>Magen Avraham</i> (<i>Orach Chaim</i> 58:1) explains that all opinions agree that the commandment to recite <i>Shema</i> in the morning begins at dawn. The only disagreement revolves around the optimum time to recite <i>Kri\'at Shema</i>. The Vilna Gaon differs and explains that the Rambam holds that Abaye\'s position states the actual time of the beginning of the commandment itself and that it may be recited earlier only in extraordinary circumstances.</p>\n<p>', 'in order to conclude and recite the last blessing with the sunrise -</b> i.e., אמת ויציב (True and certain...), which concludes: Blessed are You O God, who redeemed Israel.</p>\n<p>', 'This measure [of time] is one-tenth of an hour before the sun rises -</b> This is based on the verse in <a href=""/16293#v5"">Psalms 72:5</a>, ""May they fear You with the sun"" - i.e., may they show their fear for You with the Amidah as the sun rises (<i>Berachot</i> 9b).

The day and night are each divided into 12 equal parts, and each ""hour"" is 1/12 of that time.</p>\n<p>For example, if there were 18 hours of daylight and 6 hours of darkness on a given day, each ""hour"" of the day would be 18/12 hours (or 90 minutes), and each ""hour"" of the night would be 6/12 hour (or 30 minutes).</p>\n<p>There is a disagreement regarding how to calculate the durations of daylight and nighttime. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> holds that daylight is divided into 12 equal parts from dawn until the appearance of the stars. The <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> and the <i>Vilna Gaon</i> hold that daylight is determined from sunrise to sunset.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the end of the third hour according to the <i>Magen Avraham</i> is earlier than that of the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> and the <i>Vilna Gaon</i>, and even though each ""hour"" is longer, it is calculated from dawn, which is at least 72 minutes before sunrise. (See the commentary on Halachah 9.)</p>\n<p>', 'for one who transgresses and delays. -</b> The use of the term ""transgresses"" (מי שעבר) is most striking in this context. We must say that the Rambam understands Rabbi Yehoshua\'s position as secondary and that, at the outset, one should recite the <i>Shema</i> 6 minutes before sunrise. Indeed, in his responsa, he writes that it it is preferable to read the <i>Shema</i> without a <i>minyan</i> before sunrise, than to wait until after sunrise to recite it together with a <i>minyan</i>.</p>\n<p>The majority of <i>Rishonim</i> (see Rabbenu Asher on <i>Berachot</i> 9b and <i>Beit Yosef, Orach Chayim</i> 58) disagree with the Rambam and understand that although reciting <i>Kriat Shema</i> just prior to sunrise is the most desirable method of fulfilling one\'s obligation (מצוה מן המובחר), the actual commandment is from before sunrise (i.e., the time at which one can recognize his friend 6 feet away) to the end of the third hour.

Since ""kindling the lamp fulfills the mitzvah,"" the act of lighting the lamp is the essence of the mitzvah, and, therefore, using another Chanukah candle is not considered an act of disrespect. If, however, placing the Chanukah candles down constituted the mitzvah, the kindling of another candle would not be a direct fulfillment of a mitzvah. Therefore, it would not be proper to use another Chanukah lamp for that purpose (see Rashi, <i>Shabbat, loc. cit.</i>).</p>\n<p>[Note, however, <i>Tosafot (Shabbat</i> 23a) and the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 674:1), which state that it is customary not to light one Chanukah candles from another.]</p>\n<p>Among the questions also discussed with regard to this law is whether one must light the second candle from the first, or if it is acceptable if one lights a match from the first candle and uses it to light the second candle.

Both opinions are mentioned in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 674:1).

Therefore, if Chanukah lamps are being kindled in one\'s dwelling, one has no further obligation regarding the mitzvah even though one does not see those Chanukah lamps oneself.</p>\n<p>The rationale for this decision is that the Chanukah candles were instituted for the purpose of <i>pirsumei nisa</i>.

According to Rabban Gamliel, the essential element of communal prayer is, as the Rambam states in this halachah, the prayer of the leader of the congregation.</p>\n<p>[Note <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 24, which explains that their difference of opinion revolves around a more general issue: Which is of higher priority, quantity (the prayers of the many) or quality (the prayers of the leader of the congregation)?]</p>\n<p>The Rambam\'s statement here is difficult to place in perspective. Though in Halachah 9, he accepts the Sages\' view (See also Chapter 9, Halachot 2-3) in this halachah, his opinion follows that of Rabban Gamliel. In one of his responsa, the Rambam explains that after the Sages instituted the silent <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> to allow the leader of the congregation to prepare his prayers, even Rabban Gamliel would agree that all the individuals praying in a <i>minyan</i> also fulfill their obligation to pray by reciting their own prayers. Still it is difficult to understand why the Rambam would have the individuals forfeit the higher quality of communal prayer in order to pray individually.</p>\n<p>In his notes to <i>Rosh HaShanah</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, Rav Chayim Soloveichik writes that to take into consideration the Rambam\'s statements in this halachah, after concluding his individual prayers, each person should stand and listen to the prayer of the leader of the congregation and thus, fulfill the mitzvah of communal prayer. Note <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, which compares answering to the <i>chazan\'s</i> prayer to reciting a voluntary prayer (See Chapter 1, Halachah 9). By doing so, one will have both the advantages of individual and communal prayer.</p>\n<p>', 'This should not be done with fewer than ten -</b> See Halachot 4 and 5.</p>\n<p>', ""adult -</b> Males who have reached the age of thirteen years and a day and manifested signs of physical maturity. (See <i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i> 3:19.)</p>\n<p>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam derives this halachah from <i>Berachot</i> 47b-48a which allows for the inclusion of a child in the <i>zimmun</i> for the grace after meals. (See <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 5:7.) We assume that this leniency was granted only in regard to grace, but not in regard to prayer. See also <i>Bereishit Rabbah</i> 91:3.</p>\n<p>Many Halachic authorities do not accept this conclusion. In his siddur, Rav Sa'adia Gaon rules that a child may be counted as the tenth in a <i>minyan</i>. Similarly, the <i>Ba'al HaMe'or</i> holds that even up to four minors may be counted in a <i>minyan</i> for prayer.</p>\n<p>The <i>Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chayim</i> 55:4), rules that a minor may not be included in a <i>minyan</i> for prayer. The <i>Ramah</i> adds that under extraordinary circumstances, a minor may be counted. There are opinions that in such a case, the minor must be at least six years old, understand that prayer is service to God, and hold a <i>chumash</i> (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 55:5, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 55:5).</p>\n<p>"", 'free males -</b> i.e., excluding a Canaanite slave. However, a Jewish slave (עבד עברי) may be counted as part of a <i>minyan</i>. <i>Berachot</i> 47b relates that once, Rabbi Eliezer entered the synagogue and finding only nine people there, freed his slave to complete the quorum of ten.</p>\n<p>', 'The leader of the congregation is [counted as] one of them. -</b> Though there is no explicit source to this effect, a number of midrashim (e.g., <i>VaYikra Rabbah</i> 23:4) lead to this conclusion.</p>\n<p>One of the communal rites listed in <i>Megillah</i> 23b which requires a <i>minyan</i> is ברכת אבלים - the blessing one utters to those in mourning. For the recitation of that blessing, the presence of ten men other than the mourner himself is required. (See <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> 13:1.) Perhaps the Rambam feels that this statement is necessary to clearly distinguish between the different requirements of a <i>minyan</i> for prayer and ברכת אבלים.</p>\n<p>', 'Even if some of them have already prayed and fulfilled their obligation, they can complete the [quorum of] ten -</b> Though they do not pray together with the others, their presence in the room where the others pray can complete a <i>minyan</i>.</p>\n<p>', 'provided the majority of the ten have not prayed. -<i>Soferim</i> 10:7 states:<br/></b></p>\n<p class=""rambam_indented"">Our Sages in the West say [that <i>Kaddish</i> and <i>barchu</i> may be recited] even with seven.

The Radbaz and the <i>Pri Chadash</i> write that if these pronunciation errors are commonplace, even someone who pronounces a <i>chet</i> as a <i>hay</i> or a <i>shin</i> as a <i>sin</i> may serve as a <i>chazan</i>.

Though the previous halachah stated that the leader of the congregation should be the man of the greatest stature in the community, the mishnah (<i>Megillah</i>, <i>ibid.</i>) and similarly, several sources throughout the Talmud (See <i>Berachot</i> 33b) indicate that a teacher could appoint a student to serve as a <i>chazan</i> instead of doing so himself.</p>\n<p>The <i>Or Sameach</i> explains that this refers to a student who does not articulate the letters properly. Though such a person should not ordinarily serve as a <i>chazan</i>, if he is appointed by his teacher he may. Thus, we find that Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi appointed Rabbi Chiya as a <i>chazan</i> (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 85b) even though he would pronounce a <i>chet</i> as a <i>hay</i> (<i>Megillah</i> 24b).</p>\n<p>', 'A blind person may recite the Shema publicly -</b> even though the first blessing before the <i>Shema</i> thanks God for creating light, a blind person also benefits from light (<i>Megillah</i> <i>ibid.</i>).</p>\n<p>', 'and serve as the leader of a congregation. -</b> Perhaps the Rambam thought it necessary to clarify this point because there was a difference of opinion among the Sages as to whether a blind person is obligated in all the mitzvot or not.

Rabbenu Nissim, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, and Rabbenu Manoach follow a different line of reasoning. They differentiate between eating matzah and hearing a shofar. In the former case, a person's body benefits from the activity regardless of his intention. To support this thesis, they draw a parallel to the following passage from <i>Keritot</i> 19b.</p>\n<p>Generally, the Torah frees a person from liability if he commits a transgression while being only מתעסק (performing a deed without any thought).

In contrast, the <i>sh\'vut</i> involved in blowing the shofar cannot be avoided.</p>\n<p>b) The <i>sh\'vut</i> mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 4 must be violated before the mitzvah is performed. Hence, there is no way the prohibition can be relaxed in the mere expectation that a mitzvah will be performed. In contrast, in this instance, the performance of the mitzvah and the <i>sh\'vut</i> occur concurrently.</p>\n<p>However, the order of the halachot here suggests a different explanation. As the Rambam states in the following halachah, certain leniencies are taken regarding the <i>sh\'vut</i> of sounding the shofar on Rosh Hashanah (since, as mentioned above, it is forbidden only because it is a ""weekday act""). In contrast, the activities mentioned in Chapter 1, Halachah 4 are of a more severe nature, and hence no leniency may be taken in their regard.</p>\n<p>', 'If so, why is the shofar not sounded?

Hence, since the people could not be sure that they were in fact performing a mitzvah, the Rabbinic decree had the power to negate its performance. Even in the places where they were conscious of the proper date, they would not blow the shofar in such a year, so that great divisions in Torah practice would not be created among the Jewish people.</p>\n<p>In <i>Likkutei Torah</i>, Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi explains the matter from a mystical perspective.

On one hand, unlike Rav Yitzchak Alfasi, he requires that the judges possess <i>semichah</i> and be of sufficient stature to have sanctified the new moon (thus, excluding any contemporary courts).
